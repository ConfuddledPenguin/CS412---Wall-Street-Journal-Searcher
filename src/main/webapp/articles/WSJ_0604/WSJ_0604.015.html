	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- There is no question that the American economy
faces daunting challenges -- a huge federal budget deficit,
the savings-and-loan debacle, sluggish growth, lackluster
productivity and rechanneling resources from military to
civilian needs. The list goes on and is ample reason for
concern about the U.S. economic outlook. But it appears a
good deal less intimidating when viewed within a global
context. Indeed, many of the larger U.S. worries seem almost
trivial compared to the difficulties besetting many other
nations.
   Consider inflation. High on the American list of worries
is that inflation, which has averaged close to 4.5% in each
of the last three years, may accelerate in coming months to
annual rates of 5% or perhaps 5.5%. Were a 5% rate to
persist, it would cut the dollar's buying power in half in
less than 15 years.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The U.S. inflation picture may seem a good deal less
worrisome, however, when placed within an international
framework. Data compiled by the International Monetary Fund
show that inflation on a worldwide basis reached 18% last
year, roughly four times the U.S. rate. Moreover, while
inflation in the U.S. has shown relatively little change in
the last three years, the global rate has accelerated
sharply. It was 9% in 1987 and more than 13% in 1988.</p>
<p>Much of this global price surge has occurred in countries
that the IMF classifies euphemistically as developing. In
truth, many are desperately poor nations whose living
standards are sinking further and further behind those in the
U.S. and other industrial countries.</p>
<p>In the developing countries as a whole, inflation reached
86% in 1989, up from 60% in 1988 and 35% in 1987. The
acceleration was most pronounced in the poorest developing
areas -- Africa, Asia and Latin America. The Latin American
showing was the most egregious, with inflation at 350% last
year, up from 218% in 1988 and 116% in 1987. The rate in
Latin America continued its swift acceleration in early 1990,
reaching 672% in the first quarter.</p>
<p>Many industrialized nations also show higher rates of
inflation than the U.S. In a recent six-month period,
according to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and
Development, consumer prices rose considerably more slowly in
the U.S. than in the 24 nations surveyed as a whole. Among
those with higher inflation than the U.S. were Italy,
Britain, Sweden and Switzerland. As recently as 1988, Swiss
inflation was less than half the U.S. rate.</p>
<p>Inflation tends, of course, to erode living standards.
While Americans worry that their living standards may be
beginning to edge down, living standards in many developing
countries have long been falling.</p>
<p>A recent study by the United Nations Development Programme
shows, for instance, that the per-capita gross national
product of 43 very poor countries that the agency classifies
as low-development areas fell at an average annual rate of 1%
between 1980 and 1987, the latest year available.</p>
<p>Only 11 of the 43 countries registered a GNP gain for the
period and many showed painfully steep rates of decline --
4.9% a year in Niger, 8.2% in Mozambique, 5.2% in Liberia,
5.6% in Zambia. Between 1965 and 1980, in contrast, the GNP
gauge for the same 43 countries rose 1.2% annually. In the
U.S., for perspective, per-capita GNP rose 2% annually in
1980-87, up from a gain of 1.8% in 1965-80. In 1987 alone,
according to the UN study, per-capita income in the poorer
countries amounted to only 6% of that in the more affluent
ones.</p>
<p>A recent IMF report underscores the U.S. position in
perhaps more meaningful terms. It shows that for every 1,000
Americans there are 572 automobiles, 650 telephones and 621
television sets. These numbers exceed the comparable ratios
in all of the other 19 nations surveyed, which include
several other relatively wealthy lands as well as many
considered less than affluent, but not poor.</p>
<p>After the U.S., the highest ratios are in West Germany,
where for every 1,000 individuals there are 446 cars, 641
telephones and 377 television sets. The comparable numbers
for Japan are 235 automobiles, 535 telephones and 250 TV
sets. Well down the list is the Soviet Union, where for every
1,000 people there are only 42 cars, 115 telephones and 300
televisions. Also well down the list is Mexico, with 65 cars,
90 telephones and 108 televisions.</p>
<p>Military outlays, it should be added, tend to distort
economic activity and depress living standards, as resources
are channeled from consumer-oriented industries to defense.
This distortion should diminish in the U.S. as well as
overseas with the recent easing of East-West tensions.</p>
<p>Even before this easing, however, the U.S. appeared freer
of such distortion than many countries. Accordingly, the U.S.
may encounter fewer difficulties than is widely supposed in
adjusting to a less defense-oriented economy.</p>
<p>In 1986, according to the UN Development Programme study,
military spending came to 6.7% of GNP in the U.S. This was
far below such comparable rates as 11.5% in the Soviet Union,
19.2% in Israel and 22.7% in Saudi Arabia. The U.S. rate was
also below the average of 7.5% for the 43 countries
classified in the study as very poor. The rate for industrial
nations as a whole, as well as for all 130 nations surveyed,
was 5.4%, not far below the U.S. figure.</p>
<p>Since 1986, U.S. military outlays have fallen to 5.6% of
GNP. In the same period, despite this decline, it is
encouraging to note that the percentage of working-age
Americans with jobs has risen to a record rate, unemployment
has declined and, of course, the economy has continued to
expand.</p>
