	<p class="article-leader">Lockheed's Advanced Development Projects (commonly known
as the "Skunk Works") has produced a series of top-secret,
highly advanced aircraft for the U.S. armed forces and
intelligence agencies since World War II. The P-80, U-2,
F-104, and SR-71 have been widely recognized as among the
most significant achievements of the aerospace industry.
Those aircraft were produced in an atmosphere of creativity
by engineers under the leadership of Clarence L. "Kelly"
Johnson.
   Mr. Johnson devised 14 basic operating rules for handling
small, sensitive projects. Many are applicable to other
business situations, both inside and outside the aerospace
industry. Mr. Johnson didn't base his rules on any formal
statistical data or on scientific observations, yet they are
more than just gut feelings. They worked for Mr. Johnson for
over 30 years, and they continue to work today.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>A few of Mr. Johnson's rules have been modified to
accommodate new technologies, concepts of operation and the
effects of government regulations. Yet these rules and the
management philosophy they fostered continue to guide today's
operations at the Skunk Works.</p>
<p>But a Skunk Works is not a panacea. It does not usually
work on large programs. A true Skunk Works encourages
mavericks -- men and women who go off on tangents and devise
highly creative solutions to seemingly insurmountable
problems. But in large organizations, mavericks are
surrounded by regulations and stifled by layers of
management. Try as hard as they can, mavericks cannot
bushwack the bureaucracy that is endemic in any large
business or governmental entity.</p>
<p>A Skunk Works performs best with small programs, such as
building prototypes, or for short production runs. In small
programs people get to know one another. They are not so hung
up with titles. They speak comfortably with one another. They
trade information freely.</p>
<p>The success of the F-117 "Stealth Fighter" program is the
most recent example of how a Skunk Works operation can
perform. Lockheed and U.S. Air Force team members followed
Mr. Johnson's basic principles on this program. A small
military project office and small Lockheed project office
diligently managed all elements of the program. There was
proper accountability as well as mutual trust every step of
the way. The cost and schedule performance on the program was
outstanding. Compared with similar non-Skunk Works
operations, the F-117 program achieved significantly lower
overhead costs and better overall communications.</p>
<p>The secret of the Skunk Works' success is that its
management style is no secret, but a unique culture within
the larger Lockheed Corp. that has been nurtured and
encouraged since its inception. The basic operating rules are
in black and white for anyone to read and to apply.</p>
<p>Is the Skunk Works a national asset? Perhaps. But the true
national asset are those leaders who are willing to embrace
Kelly Johnson's principles of management, efficiency,
accountability, integrity . . . and make them work. Such
leaders will help America realize the dreams made possible by
the end of the Cold War and the decline of communism. That
would provide a real peace dividend.</p>

<p>Mr. Rich is executive vice president and general manager
of Lockheed's Advanced Development Projects.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>   Basic Operating Rules Of Lockheed's `Skunk Works'</p>
<p>                                                                                                    

  1. The Skunk Works manager must be delegated practically
complete control of his program in all aspects. He should
report to a division president or higher.</p>
<p>                                                                                                    

  2. Strong but small project offices must be provided both
by the military and industry.</p>
<p>                                                                                                    

  3. The number of people having any connection with the
project must be restricted in an almost vicious manner. Use a
small number of good people.</p>
<p>                                                                                                    

  4. A very simple drawing and drawing release system with
great flexibility for making changes must be provided.</p>
<p>                                                                                                    

  5. There must be a minimum number of reports required, but
important work must be recorded thoroughly.</p>
<p>                                                                                                    

  6. There must be a monthly cost review covering not only
what has been spent and committed but also projected costs to
the conclusion of the program. Don't surprise the customer
with sudden overruns.</p>
<p>                                                                                                    

  7. The contractor must be delegated and must assume more
than normal responsibility to get good vendor bids for
subcontract work on the project.</p>
<p>                                                                                                    

  8. The inspection system as currently used by Advanced
Development Projects (ADP), which has been approved by both
the Air Force and Navy, meets the intent of existing military
requirements and should be used on new projects. Push more
basic inspection.</p>
<p>                                                                                                    

  9. The contractor must be delegated the authority to test
his final product in flight. He can and must test it in the
initial stages. If he doesn't, he rapidly loses his
competency to design other vehicles.</p>
<p>                                                                                                    

 10. The specifications applying to the hardware must be
agreed to in advance of contracting.</p>
<p>                                                                                                    

 11. Funding a program must be timely so that the contractor
doesn't have to keep running to the bank to support
government projects.</p>
<p>                                                                                                    

 12. There must be mutual trust between the military project
organization and the contractor, with very close cooperation
and liaison on a day-to-day basis. This cuts down
misunderstanding and correspondence to an absolute minimum.</p>
<p>                                                                                                    

 13. Access by outsiders to the project and its personnel
must be strictly controlled by appropriate security measures.</p>
<p>                                                                                                    

 14. Because only a few people will be used in engineering
and most other areas, ways must be provided to reward good
performance by pay not based on the number of personnel
supervised.</p>
