	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- The Securities and Exchange Commission is
trying to sack a former Robinson-Humphrey Co. broker for
allegedly misappropriating more than $1 million from at least
18 professional football players.
   In a complaint filed in federal court in Atlanta, the SEC
charged that broker Oscar Ayala of Marietta, Ga., defrauded
the players, who held accounts at the Shearson Lehman Hutton
Inc. unit from 1988 to the present. The SEC asks that he be
enjoined from such activity and seeks unspecified relief.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The agency alleges that Mr. Ayala, instead of purchasing
securities for his clients, misappropriated at least $1
million in funds for his personal use. A federal judge has
issued a temporary restraining order freezing Mr. Ayala's
bank and securities accounts and prohibiting the destruction
of any records relating to the transactions.</p>
<p>The agency's Atlanta regional administrator, Richard
Wessel, said Robinson-Humphrey brought the matter to the
attention of the SEC and other law enforcement agencies. Mr.
Ayala's lawyer, Gary Freed, said that his client also is
under investigation by the Justice Department for possible
criminal prosecution and that his client would be eager to
huddle with the SEC to settle the case. He added, "We feel
that all of the accusations are not accurate and are
exaggerated."</p>
