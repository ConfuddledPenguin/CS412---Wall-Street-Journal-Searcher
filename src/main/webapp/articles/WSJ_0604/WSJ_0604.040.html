	<p class="article-leader">DECATUR, Ill. -- Illinois Power Co. may have to suspend
payment of dividends to holders of its preferred stock.
   "I cannot say with certainty whether we will able to pay
the preferred dividend," Larry Haab, president and chief
financial officer of the electricity and natural gas concern,
conceded in an interview. "There is the potential for a legal
interpretation that when retained earnings are negative, we
cannot pay a dividend."</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Illinois Power, which already has eliminated common stock
dividends, is awaiting the outcome of a rate case pending
before the Illinois Commerce Commission. The regulator's
ruling, viewed as critical to the utility's short-term
financial health, is expected Wednesday. The company had
about $474 million face value of preferred stock outstanding,
as of May 23, according to Moody's Investors Service Inc.</p>
<p>On May 23, Moody's changed the direction of its review of
its rating on Illinois Power's preferred stock to "down" from
"uncertain." The rating concern cited an unfavorable
preliminary rate-order proposal from a hearing examiner in
the state commerce agency's case, a delay in a pending court
case on a previous agency order, and lower-than-anticipated
corporate earnings.</p>
<p>The pivotal issue in the current commerce commission case
is whether the regulators will declare Illinois Power's
Clinton nuclear power plant 100% "used and useful," Mr. Haab
said. State regulations restrict utilities to billing
customers for only as much of a plant's cost as is necessary
to meet the overall demand for power.</p>
<p>The seven-member commission ruled in March 1989 that only
27% of the plant was needed. Four members of the commission
have been replaced since then; how they intend to vote on the
Clinton issue isn't clear.</p>
<p>"It is vital to us to get it (the Clinton plant) declared
`used and useful,' even if it's not incorporated into rates
in one shot," Mr. Haab said. "There is a possibility of
having to write off that portion of Clinton which is not
declared `used and useful.'"</p>
<p>As of March 31, Illinois Power's retained earnings were
listed at $120.7 million. If retained earnings become
negative through a write-off, both the Federal Power Act and
the Illinois Public Utility Act stipulate interruption of
preferred stock dividends.</p>
<p>In November, the state commerce commission's staff
recommended that the Clinton plant be declared 100% "used and
useful," and that Illinois Power be granted $147 million of
its $215 million rate-increase request. The agency's hearing
examiner, who acts as a judge, later recommended that Clinton
be declared 42% "used and useful," and proposed a far smaller
rate increase of $27 million.</p>
<p>"My prediction is that what they'll get will be somewhere
between the staff's recommendation and the hearing
examiner's," Barry Abramson, an analyst at Prudential-Bache
Securities Inc., said.</p>
<p>Illinois Power's problems trace back to the commerce
commission's March 1989 refusal to allow the utility to use
100% of the Clinton plant. In the order, the commission also
said Illinois Power imprudently spent $666 million too much
on the plant. Following the 1989 order, the company took a
$346 million write-off.</p>
<p>At the time, analysts said, the commission's membership
was strongly consumer-oriented. With four new members on the
commission this year, Mr. Haab hopes for a ruling more
favorable for the utility.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Illinois Power is awaiting the result of the
lawsuit it filed, challenging the 1989 order. The case is in
Illinois's Third District Appellate Court, and a ruling is
expected this fall.</p>
<p>"The critical thing is that the appellate ruling be in our
favor," Mr. Haab said. "If we get a favorable decision from
the appellate court, there will be no write-off this year."</p>
<p>Such an outcome is unlikely, Mr. Abramson, the
Prudential-Bache analyst, said.</p>
<p>The court is expected to rule both on whether the utility
can use all of the Clinton plant and on whether it spent too
much money to build it.</p>
<p>"I don't see any scenario under which they're not going to
have to write off $248 million, after tax, for imprudent
spending," Mr. Abramson said. "Based on that assumption,
they'd have a negative retained income, which would preclude
them from paying preferred dividends for a time."</p>
