	<p class="article-leader">Prospect Park Financial Corp. said it will report a charge
against earnings for the fiscal fourth quarter ended April
30, and likely won't meet certain federal capital
requirements by July 1. The amount of the charge wasn't
specified.
   The bank holding company based in West Paterson, N.J.,
said the charge will reflect a further deterioration of the
New Jersey real estate market, where its Prospect Park
Savings Bank has made loans and where two of the bank's units
have pursued development projects.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>President Edward Gurak said he believes Prospect Park
Savings Bank won't meet regulatory requirements for
risk-based capital by July 1, when those requirements change
to account differently for banks' real-estate development
activities. The future regulatory compliance of the bank's
tangible and core capital isn't clear, he said.</p>
<p>If Prospect Park fails to meet any capital requirement, it
must file a plan with the federal Office of Thrift
Supervision showing how it will meet that requirement by Dec.
31, 1994, Mr. Gurak said.</p>
