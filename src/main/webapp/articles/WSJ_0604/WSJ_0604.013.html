	<p class="article-leader">SURE, COMPUTERS have produced success stories in the
office. But as companies increasingly embrace tomorrow's
technology, they ought to heed yesterday's horror stories as
well.
   There's the company, for instance, that bought more bells
and whistles than it needed, or bought stuff that quickly
became outdated, or never quite figured out how to use what
it bought. For every person who's a virtuoso at Lotus 1-2-3,
there's a guy who miscoded an electronic mash note meant for
his sweetheart and sent it to the whole office instead.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Consultants say most of the problems occur because
corporate buyers don't think through all the issues. Most
companies buy systems primarily based on the price of the
hardware, but that turns out to be only about 15% of the
total cost. Training, which gets little attention in budgets,
may actually be the biggest cost.</p>
<p>Gil Mann, chief executive officer of Learn-PC Video
Systems, a training company in Minneapolis, says a military
client that bought several dozen laptop computers initially
didn't budget anything for training. More than half the
machines, he says, never made it out of their boxes.</p>
<p>Amy Wohl, a consultant in Bala Cynwyd, Pa., says companies
often try to cut corners on silly things and end up buying
software that lacks crucial features -- such as the ability
to use Postscript typeface technology, which has become
important in desktop publishing.</p>
<p>"People say, `If I buy that other desktop publishing
package, I'll save $50,'" she says. "I say, `That's the
dumbest thing I ever heard. Would you please buy the standard
package with all the standard features and people who can
train you to use it, people who can answer your questions?'"</p>
<p>Almost every big company has run into trouble because it
bought its personal computers piecemeal; each department was
allowed to buy whatever it wanted. Now, the biggest trend
among users is to hook all the machines together and share
information, but many of the software packages can't talk
with each other.</p>
<p>With technology changing so fast, companies have also had
plenty of opportunities to head into blind alleys. Tony
Burdick, manager of computer systems at William Blair & Co.,
a brokerage firm in Chicago, had everyone using MDBS Inc.'s
KnowledgeMan data base. At one time KnowledgeMan was regarded
as a powerful package that had a chance of becoming the
industry standard. It faded, however, because MDBS never did
much to make it easier to use. So Mr. Burdick had to spring
for new software and retrain everyone to use a new data base.
He says it would take him eight weeks to write a program with
KnowledgeMan that he can do in a week with Borland
International Ltd.'s Paradox, the software he now uses.</p>
<p>Such problems will get worse before they get better; there
is more confusion than at any other time in recent memory
about what software will become the industry standard, and
anyone who makes the wrong move risks becoming a
technological orphan.</p>
<p>"This is the most confusing time I can remember in the
industry," Mr. Burdick says.</p>
<p>Even experts are confused or at least exasperated by the
bewildering array of changes. Peter McWilliams, author of
"The Personal Computer Book," acknowledges that he often
can't be bothered with the flood of new software he receives.</p>
<p>"By the time I get around to opening a software package I
want to use, I may realize there's a new version out," he
says. "So I put it on the shelf. But by the time I get the
new version, I've lost interest. So I put that on the shelf
next to the old version. I've done this several times."</p>
<p>Consultants say that's a common problem. As companies
upgrade to the latest version of spreadsheets and collect the
older ones, they find that up to half the boxes that
employees turn in may be unopened.</p>
<p>And it's not just the constant flow of new software; it's
the difficulty of understanding it, many experts say. "I
think software is actually getting harder to use," says
Donald Norman, a professor of cognitive science at the
University of California, San Diego. "Every new release gets
more and more features. And there still is very little
understanding in the software business about what it takes to
make a product usable."</p>
<p>Few people remember it, but Oliver North was tripped up
partly because he didn't understand a piece of software. When
he tried to wipe out all the messages he had sent about the
Iran-Contra affair, he didn't realize that International
Business Machines Corp.'s PROFs electronic-mail system made
an automatic backup, so he left an easy trail for
investigators to follow.</p>
<p>Even if companies buy all the right stuff, they could
still blunder. That's because they haven't thought about the
biggest obstacle: people's resistance to change. Eric Vogt,
president of MicroMentor, a computer training firm in
Cambridge, Mass., tells of an executive trying to learn how
to use a spreadsheet. The executive initially impressed Mr.
Vogt with a complicated spreadsheet that seemed to have every
number in the right place. Then he realized that the
executive had done all the work on a hand-held calculator and
had typed all the numbers into the boxes of the spreadsheet.</p>
<p>The problems can be compounded because mistakes happen so
quickly and irrevocably with computers. Philippe Kahn, chief
executive of Borland, the software company, says he once hit
the wrong key while on a public electronic-mail network and
misaddressed a note that was supposed to go to Borland's head
of product development. As a result, he sent a total stranger
his product plans for the following year and a half.</p>
<p>Many issues that seem to be simple technological matters
can also end up causing unintended cultural changes.
Electronic mail, for instance, seems to provide a simple way
of improving communication by letting people send notes and
documents to private computer "mailboxes" instantaneously.
One advantage is that people can easily send copies of memos
to anyone who might be interested. The problem is that people
do send copies to everyone who might be interested.</p>
<p>Mr. Norman, the California professor, says he gets 40,000
to 50,000 pieces of electronic mail a year, far more than he
can handle. Just sorting through it can easily take more than
an hour a day.</p>
<p>Mr. Kahn says he's always found it intriguing that the
Japanese use far fewer personal computers per person than
Americans and Europeans do -- yet the Japanese economy is
considered to be much more efficient.</p>
<p>Prof. Norman says that "the good news is that the personal
computer is catching on in Japan, so maybe they'll finally
slow down."</p>
