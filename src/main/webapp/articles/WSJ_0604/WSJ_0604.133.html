	<p class="article-leader">DALLAS -- Recognition Equipment Inc. said it delayed a
planned tender offer for $15 million to $20 million of its
stock for up to six more months while it works on improving
its business and continues to try to sell assets.
   The maker of document-processing equipment initially
agreed to purchase its stock when Prospect Group Inc., a New
York leveraged buy-out concern, made a $15 million loan to
the company. However, Prospect later agreed to let
Recognition use the funds for short-term working capital for
as long as four months after it made the loan in February.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Recognition said its board moved to further amend the
agreement with Prospect after considering the capital needs
associated with its plans to focus on its imaging equipment
and because planned asset sales are moving more slowly than
expected. It also cited pending settlement discussions with
the U.S. Federal Reserve Banks over a contract dispute
involving currency-processing systems.</p>
<p>The company said that delaying the tender offer until as
late as the end of November will allow it to look at its
results for the year ending Oct. 31. A spokeswoman said the
decision isn't the result of a liquidity problem, saying the
company had approximately $48 million in cash and equivalents
at April 30.</p>
