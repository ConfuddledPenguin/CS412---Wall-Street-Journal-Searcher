	<p class="article-leader">R. Gustav Niebuhr's April 25 page-one article "House
Divided" is a fine example of factual, unbiased journalism.
It is evident that Mr. Niebuhr has keen insight and a
thorough knowledge of his subject.
   Southern Baptists, since inception, have held tenaciously
to the rights to think, to question and to speak. Not so
slowly, but surely, these rights are being snuffed out within
the denomination. A great religious body is being torn
asunder and destroyed from within.</p>
