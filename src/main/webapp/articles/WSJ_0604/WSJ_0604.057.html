	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Lehman Brothers has been dead for six years,
its partners scattered throughout Wall Street. But the Lehman
mystique lives on.
   Now Shearson Lehman Hutton Holdings Inc. plans to
resurrect the 140-year-old Lehman Brothers name, and hopes to
bring more life to Shearson in the process.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Even to cynical Wall Streeters, the idea has some charm.
Many still talk about the House of Lehman and its famous
headquarters, once decorated with family portraits, at 1
William St. in lower Manhattan. The Lehman Brothers name
hasn't been used since Shearson bought the Lehman Brothers
Kuhn Loeb Inc. investment bank in 1984 and folded it into
what was then called Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc.</p>
<p>Shearson, a unit of marketing-minded American Express Co.,
is expected as early as this week to announce a
reorganization of its businesses that will combine Shearson's
investment banking and trading divisions under the Lehman
Brothers name. Shearson's stock-brokerage and
money-management businesses, meanwhile, would retain the
Shearson name.</p>
<p>But will the move by the country's second-biggest
securities firm work? Some people on Wall Street have their
doubts.</p>
<p>Says Lewis L. Glucksman, a Lehman partner for 25 years and
its last chairman: "Lehman stood for excellence, and we were
on the cutting edge of everything that was going on in
investment banking for 50 years." But Mr. Glucksman, now a
vice chairman of Primerica Corp.'s Smith Barney, Harris Upham
& Co. unit, adds: "Shearson will have its work cut out to be
able to assume that mantle. And they're not there now."</p>
<p>Lehman Brothers "was once a great name; to the people of
my generation it really stood for something," says Roy C.
Smith, a finance professor at New York University and limited
partner at Goldman, Sachs & Co., an investment bank that was
closely aligned with Lehman in the early 1900s before a
bitter breakup. "But the people who made Lehman Brothers what
it was are no longer there," cautions Mr. Smith. "Therefore,
going back to the name is nothing more than a marketing
device, and the real success of the firm will depend on what
the firm does."</p>
<p>The Lehman Brothers name symbolizes cockiness and success
at a time when Shearson investment bankers and traders are
smarting, several Shearson bankers say. They have weathered
months of management and financial problems that forced
American Express to pump more than $1 billion into Shearson
and pull it closer by buying back the Shearson common stock
it doesn't already own. Change is needed, even if it's
cosmetic to outsiders, say the bankers.</p>
<p>Although Shearson has a whole family of old names it could
choose from -- remnants of the array of brokerage firms it
bought in the 1980s -- Lehman Brothers is the premier one,
with the most history.</p>
<p>Founded by the Lehman brothers, immigrants from Bavaria,
in 1850, Lehman started as a Montgomery, Ala., commodities
house. To understand how long the Lehman Brothers name has
been around, the Lehman bank is on record as buying at least
one slave, a 14-year-old black woman named Martha, for $900
in 1854. About 30 years later, Lehman Brothers bought its
first New York Stock Exchange seat and became famous as one
of the Street's most aggressive investment banks.</p>
<p>Early in this century, the alliance of Lehman Brothers and
Goldman Sachs dominated Wall Street's new-issue market. From
1906 to 1924, the two houses co-managed a then-astounding 114
securities issues, beginning with the first public stock
offering by Sears, Roebuck & Co.</p>
<p>At the height of its influence after World War II, Lehman
was growing faster than any other investment bank. Lehman was
admired for its "integrity, philosophy, aggressiveness and,
above all, for its methods," wrote Joseph Wechsberg in his
book "The Merchant Bankers."</p>
<p>In the early 1980s, a civil war between Lehman's
investment bankers and its traders led to the 1984 sale of
the firm to Shearson for about $360 million. In making the
name switch, Shearson is reversing Wall Street convention.
Usually, brokerage firms kill off old names as they merge and
break up over the years.</p>
<p>But Shearson -- which retains about 1,000 Lehman veterans,
mostly brokers and administrative workers rather than former
Lehman partners -- thinks the Lehman name hasn't lost its
luster.</p>
<p>About the only top Lehman manager still at Shearson is
Richard S. Fuld Jr., Shearson's head of capital markets. He
is expected to be named co-head of the reorganized Lehman
Brothers operation. (Commodities head Jack Lehman III, the
only person at the firm who's named Lehman, isn't a family
member.) However, there are perhaps three dozen mostly
lower-ranked Lehman veterans who now have top jobs at
Shearson, including co-head of investment banking J. Tomilson
Hill; the head of merchant banking, James Stern; and the
heads of mergers and acquisitions, risk arbitrage, global
finance, fixed income, new products and international
operations.</p>
<p>Still, Samuel Hayes, a professor of investment banking at
Harvard Business School, says, "I think the reality is that
the Lehman Brothers investment bank that was such a
powerhouse in corporate finance has now been dispersed."
Fostering a separate identity for Shearson's investment
bankers "could be a morale-booster, but you don't have to
announce a reconstitution of Lehman Brothers to do that," the
professor says.</p>
<p>Shearson obviously doesn't agree.</p>
<p>While Shearson's top officials decline to comment about
the reorganization until after the announcement, industry
executives say Shearson did extensive research on the value
of the Lehman name, interviewing chief executives, financial
executives and competitors in the U.S. and Europe. They
apparently found high recognition and respect for the name.</p>
<p>The only U.S. brokerage firm bigger than Shearson, Merrill
Lynch & Co., already is organized into separate brokerage and
investment banking units. But Merrill now appears to be
taking the opposite approach from Shearson as far as
establishing identities; it is considering dropping the name
Merrill Lynch Capital Markets for its investment banking half
to de-emphasize, rather than emphasize, a separate identity
for its bankers.</p>
<p>Asked about Shearson's current plans, Jerome Kenney, head
of Merrill Lynch Capital Markets, is skeptical. The brokerage
and investment banking sides of securities firms must work
with each other, says Mr. Kenney. And "once you put different
names on it," he says, "it can result in less coordination if
not done right."</p>
