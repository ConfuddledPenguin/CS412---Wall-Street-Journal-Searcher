	<p class="article-leader">HOUSTON -- Meridian Oil Inc., a unit of Burlington
Resources Inc., said it completed tests of a large wildcat
discovery well in the Austin Chalk Trend in south central
Texas.
   Meridian said the well flowed at average daily rates of
12,254 barrels of oil, 4.9 million cubic feet of gas and
3,032 barrels of water through two 2 1/16-inch chokes at a
flowing tubing pressure of 300 pounds per square inch during
a four-hour test period. The well was drilled as a medium
radius, extended reach horizontal drainhole to a measured
depth of 11,368 feet.</p>

the Austin Chalk Trend has historically had a significant
production decline in certain areas. Meridian said it will
continue to evaluate the potential of its well.</p>
