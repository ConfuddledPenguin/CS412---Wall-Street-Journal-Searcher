	<p class="article-leader">LOS ANGELES -- Pathe Communications Corp. expects to
complete its $1.27 billion tender offer for MGM/UA
Communications Co. this week, although analysts cautioned
that unresolved financing issues could still trip up the
deal.
   Theodore Cohen, Pathe executive vice president and
assistant general counsel, said through a spokesman that he
thinks the $20-a-share offer will be wrapped up on schedule.
"At this stage, he is confident it will close Thursday," the
spokesman said.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>A spokesman for MGM/UA, based in Culver City, Calif., said
late Friday that "everything we have seen indicates that the
deal is still on track."</p>
<p>That optimistic view was bolstered last week after Pathe
disclosed a few more details of its financing arrangements,
which hinge on Luxembourg-based Comfinance S.A., the closely
held main vehicle for Pathe principal Giancarlo Parretti, and
on Time Warner Inc., the New York entertainment and
publishing company.</p>
<p>Time Warner had vaguely agreed in April to "arrange for or
provide" $650 million to Pathe "on a bridge loan basis" in
exchange for a lien against the UA film library. Time Warner
later indicated the loan might have a six-year term. But in a
filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission last week,
Pathe spelled out that Time Warner plans to make the loan
directly. A technical revision of the agreement calls for
Time Warner to pay the funds directly to Pathe, rather than
funnel them through MGM/UA.</p>
<p>However, the Time Warner financing pact was still being
negotiated late last week. One possible snag is that Time
Warner has insisted that the bulk of Pathe's remaining
financing be in the form of equity, not debt. Pathe has said
that Comfinance will provide $450 million from working
capital and available funds.</p>
<p>Raising a red flag, the filing states that "while {the
Comfinance} arrangement is technically structured as a loan
despite the requirement of the Time Warner agreement that it
be provided as equity, {Pathe} believes that the Comfinance
loan is equity for purposes of the Time Warner agreement
since the Comfinance loan may be repaid" with Pathe common
stock.</p>
<p>A Time Warner spokesman declined to speculate on how big a
stumbling block this might be, saying only that "we are
evaluating that funding arrangement."</p>
<p>Some analysts remain unconvinced that Pathe will complete
the acquisition, despite having put up $150 million in
earnest money. "I still have skepticism," said Jeffrey
Logsdon, an analyst at Crowell, Weedon & Co. in Los Angeles.
"It's difficult to obtain comfort that Comfinance has the
capability" to come up with the funds.</p>
<p>Mr. Logsdon and other analysts have speculated that Kirk
Kerkorian, who holds an 82% stake in MGM/UA, may provide some
of the needed equity. The MGM/UA spokesman reiterated Friday
that Mr. Kerkorian hasn't decided whether he will do that.</p>
