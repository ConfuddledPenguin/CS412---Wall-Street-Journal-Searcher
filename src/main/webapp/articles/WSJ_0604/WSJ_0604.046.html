	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Signs that the U.S. economy is losing its kick
won't undercut the resilient dollar any time soon.
   So say a number of currency analysts who point to the
dollar-boosting potential of economic and political
uncertainty in West Germany and elsewhere.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"I really wouldn't be looking to throw in the towel on the
dollar," says Victor Polce, head of corporate dealings at
Algemene Bank Nederland N.V. in New York.</p>
<p>Few traders gave up on the dollar Friday despite an
ominous sign in the government's employment report. The data
show that although the May unemployment rate fell to 5.3%
from 5.4% in April, non-farm payrolls increased by only
164,000 jobs, compared with the 253,000 economists expected.
Economic weakness can lead to lower interest rates, reducing
the dollar's appeal compared with other currencies.</p>
<p>Friday's data sparked only a short-lived setback for the
dollar, however.</p>
<p>Shortly after the report was announced, the dollar sank to
intraday lows of 1.6815 marks and 150.80 yen. But then the
currency strengthened.</p>
<p>In late dealings here, the dollar changed hands at 1.6980
marks and 151.85 yen, compared with 1.6965 marks and 152.10
yen at Thursday's close.</p>
<p>In Tokyo Monday, the dollar was trading soon after the
opening at 152.50 yen, up a bit from Friday's Tokyo close of
152.17 yen. Meanwhile, the U.S. currency was trading at about
1.7010 marks.</p>
<p>Although economists warn against reading too much into any
single report, the financial markets often move sharply on
the jobs figures. That's because they give hints about the
health of a number of sectors and sometimes encourage
adjustments in the Federal Reserve's monetary policy.</p>
<p>And even though the economy is still giving warning
signals of weak growth and there is persistent speculation
that Fed easing may be down the road, many traders believe
there will be continued demand for the dollar in the near
term.</p>
<p>"They're still looking to buy. People are skeptically
playing long dollar positions," says David Lapin, national
foreign exchange sales manager at Bank of America, Los
Angeles.</p>
<p>The dollar stumbled against a number of foreign currencies
recently, but the declines didn't last.</p>
<p>In dollar-yen dealings, buyers have been backing the
dollar even though sales by Japanese institutional investors
pounded it recently.</p>
<p>And in dollar-Swiss franc trading, the dollar has
weathered the selling that occurred because of the market's
enthusiasm about Switzerland's higher interest rates. High
rates generally boost a currency because they draw buyers to
investments denominated in the unit.</p>
<p>Despite the softness in the U.S. economy, investors still
have confidence in the dollar at a time when uncertainty
surrounds international politics and economics, currency
specialists say.</p>
<p>"What other currency are investors going to buy?" asks
Carl Weinberg, chief economist at High Frequency Economics
Ltd., an international consulting company in New York.</p>
<p>Mr. Weinberg rattled off a number of reasons dollar buying
is likely to continue: The mark is being held back by
concerns about German monetary union. The yen isn't seen as a
safe bet because the condition of Japan's economy and
financial markets is unclear. Canadian dollars are being
shunned because of Canada's constitutional impasse. Pound
buying is on hold because of uncertainties about the course
of British interest rates.</p>
<p>The dollar is "the first choice," he says, adding that it
is "pretty comfortable" in long-range trading bands of 1.65
to 1.75 marks and 150 to 160 yen.</p>
<p>Mr. Polce of Bank Algemene Nederland says the dollar has
the potential to hit 1.72 marks and 153.50 yen pretty soon.</p>
<p>Traders say the dollar probably won't have much trouble
building momentum against the mark because of the rocky road
to the monetary linkup between East Germany and West Germany,
which is scheduled to go into effect July 1.</p>
<p>Still unknown is how West Germany's powerful economy will
fare after its mark becomes the official currency of East
Germany. Furthermore, the military allegiances involved in
German reunification have yet to be sorted out.</p>
<p>On the Commodity Exchange in New York Friday, gold for
current delivery dropped $5.10 to $359.20 an ounce. The close
was the lowest since Sept. 9. Estimated volume was a moderate
3.8 million ounces.</p>
<p>In Hong Kong Monday, gold was quoted at $359.35 an ounce.</p>
