	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Economists' charts and graphs are flashing a
green light for the bond market, bolstering the case for
lower interest rates this summer.
   Economists now believe that yields on the Treasury's
benchmark 30-year bond could fall to between 8% and 8.25% --
about where they stood in January. They think this will
happen even if the Federal Reserve doesn't lower interest
rates -- although some are beginning to whisper that the Fed
might do so.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"The rally has just begun," said Philip Braverman, a
longtime bond market bull who is senior vice president at DKB
Securities Corp., a subsidiary of Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank Ltd.
He said recent economic data confirm that the economy is weak
and inflation is losing momentum, a situation that often
leads to lower interest rates.</p>
<p>Mr. Braverman isn't the only raging bull in the bond
market. Last week many economists trimmed their forecasts for
second-quarter economic growth, automatically heightening the
recent bullishness in a market that thrives on bad economic
news.</p>
<p>The speed at which bond prices rise will depend upon the
Federal Reserve. Economists are sharply divided over how the
Fed will react to the weak economic reports. A growing number
believe the Fed will push short-term rates lower in an effort
to stave off a recession. But a smaller group believes the
Fed will keep credit policy on hold, using the current
slow-growth environment to fight stubbornly high inflation.</p>
<p>Even without the Fed's help, economists say, bond yields
should continue to fall as the market retraces the sharp
spikes of January through April, when investors sold bonds on
signs that the economy and inflation were picking up. Now,
the economists are starting to view the four-month period as
an aberration in a longer-term decline.</p>
<p>Bond prices don't yet reflect prospects for Fed easing.
Samuel D. Kahan, chief financial economist, Fuji Securities
Inc., notes that yields on the Treasury's two-year notes
ended Friday at about 8.3% -- still above the 8.25%
federal-funds rate, which banks charge each other on
overnight loans. The Fed often uses the rate to signal
changes in credit policy. "If the yield on the two-year notes
dips below or matches the federal-funds rate, that would
signify that the financial markets have begun to incorporate
future declines in the federal-funds rate into the bond
market," he said.</p>
<p>Speculation that the Fed may choose to push rates lower
began on Friday, after the Department of Labor released the
May employment report. The government reported that nonfarm
employment rose by 164,000 in May, but most of that growth
reflected the hiring of temporary census workers. Moreover,
the labor statistics revealed that there has been virtually
no private-sector job growth in the past three months. The
unemployment rate declined slightly to 5.3% in May, but only
because 145,000 census workers were hired.</p>
<p>After the data were released, institutional investors
plunged into the bond market. The buying spree pushed prices
of the Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond 1 1/2 points higher,
or $15 for a bond with a $1,000 face amount. The yield on the
bond issue eased to 8.44%, the lowest rates on a benchmark
30-year bond since February.</p>
<p>Some economists were clearly alarmed by the weak
employment report. They fear that a sluggish economy could
prompt a wave of corporate bankruptcies (especially among
highly leveraged companies), exacerbate the credit crunch
that appears to be brewing and thwart the government's
savings-and-loan bailout efforts. They say the Fed's only
recourse is to lower interest rates.</p>
<p>"Only two months ago, some of the Fed Governors dissented
from a vote of unchanged policy for tighter policy; this new
set of data may convince the Hawks to at least swing back to
middle ground while some of the other members who would have
welcomed additional easing may now be wringing their hands
with worry," said economist Maria Fiorini Ramirez.</p>
<p>Joseph Liro, an economist at S.G. Warburg Securities Inc.,
said it's likely that the Fed will vote to ease credit
conditions in July at the next Federal Open Market Committee
meeting. Mr. Liro said the Fed will reduce rates because the
next batch of economic data-consumer prices, commodity
prices, retail sales and industrial products -- will reveal
weakness and confirm the findings in the employment report.</p>
<p>"If the Fed gets confirmation, that will set the stage for
a 1/4 percentage point decline in the federal-funds rate," to
about 8%, said Mr. Liro.</p>
<p>But economists at Salomon Brothers Inc., James Fralick at
Morgan Stanley & Co. and several others aren't ready to hit
the recession panic button just yet -- and they don't think
the Fed will either. These economists say that Fed officials
will use the slow economy to fight inflation.</p>
<p>"As long as they can continue to keep (real gross national
product) growing between 1.5% and 2%, they can continue to
damp inflationary pressures," said Mr. Fralick. "That is
their stated objective and that is their goal."</p>
<p>Donald Fine, chief market analyst at Chase Manhattan Bank,
said that if the Fed eases now, "they run the risk of having
the economy pick up more than they want." Mr. Fine said too
many people are overlooking signs that the industrial sector
is picking up strength.</p>
<p>One such indicator is an index compiled by the National
Association of Purchasing Managers. The index, which measures
overall health in the manufacturing industry, rose to 50.7%
during the month, the highest reading since April 1989. The
association says a reading above 50% signals the
manufacturing economy is generally growing. Last month the
index increased to 50.2%, the first time it had crossed the
50% threshold since May 1989.</p>
<p>Mr. Fralick notes that even the employment report
contained a few signs of economic strength. Although
employment in the key services and manufacturing sectors
declined, the number of hours worked in the manufacturing
industry rose. That suggests that manufacturers could be
gearing up again, although with fewer employees.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>Friday's Market Activity</p>
<p>Prices of Treasury bonds surged Friday on speculation that
interest rates are heading lower.</p>
<p>The Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond ended at a price of
103 8/32 to yield 8.44%, compared with Thursday's price of
101 24/ 32 to yield 8.57%.</p>
<p>Short-term rates were also lower. The discount rate on
three-month Treasury bills ended at 7.70% for a
bond-equivalent yield of 7.94%, down from 7.76% to yield
8.00% on Thursday. Rates on six month bills ended at 7.62% to
yield 8.01% , down from 7.74% to yield 8.15% on Thursday.</p>
<p>In the corporate market, falling rates prompted a handful
of corporations to issue new bonds.</p>
<p>More than $800 million of new debt was sold to the public,
including a total of $425 million of notes issued by Dayton
Hudson Corp. and Bellsouth Savings & Employee Stock Ownership
Trust.</p>
<p>In trading, most active investment-grade corporate bonds
surged as much as 1 1/4 points in tandem with gains in the
Treasury market.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, rising stock prices helped boost junk bonds,
which are speculative-grade corporate securities with low
credit ratings or no credit ratings at all.</p>
<p>Most actively traded cash-paying junk bonds climbed 1/4
point.</p>
<p>The pay-in-kind bonds of RJR Nabisco Inc., which pay
interest in the form of additional securities instead of
cash, also advanced strongly. RJR Nabisco's 14.07%
convertible pay-in-kind debentures, due in 2009, finished 5/8
point higher to close at 84 7/8 on the New York Stock
Exchange. The other widely held RJR issue, the 14.07%
exchangeable pay-in-kind debentures, maturing in 2007, ended
1 1/4 points higher to close at 71.</p>
<p>Despite the overall strength in the market, junk bonds of
Southland Corp. fell. Southland's 16 3/4% subordinated
debentures, maturing in 2002, shed 1/2 point to close at 4.
After the market closed Friday, Southland said it won't make
the June 15 pay-in-kind stock dividend on its 15% cumulative
exchangeable preferred stock.</p>
