	<p class="article-leader">Your May 4 editorial defending citizens who trade shares
on inside information, "Justice Reaches Into Allenwood," is
exactly right, but does not go far enough. Any citizen who
owns an asset, and who has no fiduciary responsibility over
its disposition, should be permitted to call anyone in the
world and ask for information on its prospects for
appreciation or depreciation -- and buy or sell on any
information gleaned.
   If I own shares or am thinking of buying shares in General
Motors, I am protected by the First Amendment to the
Constitution if I call the chairman of GM, the directors or
their investment bankers and ask them any question I can
imagine. And I can buy and sell on the information they
provide. Any laws that make it a crime for me to do so are
patently unconstitutional. The government can make it a crime
for me to own a particular asset, to sell an asset at a price
the government deems unfair. But the Constitution does not
permit the government to criminalize my communications in
inquiring as to its prospects.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The frenzied outrage over the fact that a lot of people
have made money buying and selling assets on Wall Street in
recent years should not obscure the fact that there are
fundamental rights we possess and should defend. Federal
prosecutors, judges and juries who have been swept up in this
frenzy over tales of untrammeled greed on Wall Street should
bear this in mind. In the Waldbaum case, you correctly point
out that Robert Chestman was convicted and jailed for a
"crime that he did not commit -- and that the judges ruled
does not exist."</p>
<p>Another egregious example in this vein was the conviction
of Robert Freeman of Goldman Sachs for trading on "inside
information." Mr. Freeman was actually indicted on a variety
of charges that were dropped when he agreed to plead guilty
to trading on the news that his "Bunny has a good nose."
Because Mr. Freeman had no fiduciary responsibilities
violated in the subsequent transactions, he thus pleaded
guilty to a crime that does not exist in order to give the
feds their pound of flesh. I suggest a new law, perhaps even
a capital crime, that prohibits U.S. citizens from pleading
guilty to crimes that do not exist.</p>
