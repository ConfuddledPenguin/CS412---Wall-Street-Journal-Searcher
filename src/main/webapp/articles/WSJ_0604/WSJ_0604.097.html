	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Kane-Miller Corp. said it may seek control of
Amrep Corp. through a proxy solicitation, tender offer,
merger or other transaction.
   Kane-Miller, a Tarrytown, N.Y., food processor, holds 8.1%
of Amrep, a builder of communities and international
distributor of magazines.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>On the news Friday, Amrep rose 25 cents to $7.625 in New
York Stock Exchange composite trading. At that price, Amrep's
about 6.6 million shares would cost about $50 million.</p>
<p>Howard W. Friedman, Amrep's chairman and chief executive
officer, declined to comment.</p>
<p>In a Securities and Exchange Commission filing,
Kane-Miller said that on May 30 it asked Amrep for a
shareholders list, to use if Kane-Miller should decide to
solicit proxies to gain control of Amrep's board.</p>
<p>Kane-Miller spoke with Amrep about board representation,
but the discussions were "uneventful," the filing said.
Kane-Miller said it has "extensively studied" public
information on Amrep and its plans might change.</p>
<p>Another substantial Amrep holder is Peter B. Bedford,
president of the Lafayette, Calif., real estate developer
Bedford Properties Inc. In January, Mr. Bedford disclosed a
5.2% stake and said he intended to raise it to as much as
10%. In late April, he said the stake had risen to 8.7%. A
spokesman for Bedford Properties wouldn't comment.</p>
<p>For the nine months ended Jan. 31, Amrep had a net loss of
$492,000, or seven cents a share, compared with net income of
$1.1 million, or 16 cents a share, in the year-earlier
period. Sales rose 5% to $70.3 million.</p>
