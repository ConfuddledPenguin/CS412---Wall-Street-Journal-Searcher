	<p class="article-leader">Federal regulators said the failure of Phoenix,
Ariz.-based Western Savings & Loan Association will add $1.7
billion to the bill for cleaning up the S&L mess, the single
costliest government rescue of a troubled thrift to date.
   Western's $3.5 billion in deposits, 61 branches and
certain assets were acquired last week by BankAmerica Corp.
for $81 million. Western reported negative shareholder equity
of $1.4 billion at year end, but on Friday the Resolution
Trust Corp. said the total cost of the collapse, including
paying off insured depositors and creditors, selling troubled
assets and resolving lawsuits, would approximate $1.7
billion.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Only Lincoln Savings & Loan Association, Irvine, Calif.,
and Miami-based CenTrust Bank are expected to cost more, at
least $2 billion each. Those cases haven't been finally
resolved.</p>
<p>The estimate for Western points up the depth of the
Arizona thrift problem, and its role in the overall bailout.
The state's boom-turned-bust real-estate business of the last
few years has claimed nearly every major thrift in the state
for government regulators. According to Miami thrift
consultant Kenneth Thomas, some 82% of the deposits of the
state's thrifts were in government hands at year-end 1989 by
virtue of seizures, far exceeding the rate in any other
state, including Texas, where a number of private rescues
were arranged a few years ago.</p>
<p>The Western sale to San Francisco-based BankAmerica, Mr.
Thomas said, "signals the start of the denationalization of
the thrift industry in Arizona."</p>
<p>Western had one of the largest portfolios of repossessed
real estate of any thrift in the country, an estimated $637
million at year end, and an additional $295 million in what
are considered highly speculative loans for land development
and acquisition, according to Mr. Thomas. Before it was taken
over by federal regulators last June, Western also held some
$46 million in junk bonds.</p>
<p>Western also took advantage of an Arizona state law that
permitted thrifts to own stock in other companies, although
that didn't turn out too well, either, according to Allan
Bortel, an investment banker specializing in thrifts for
Sutro & Co. in San Francisco. Among its ill-starred equity
ventures was an investment in a Washington state campground
operator, according to Mr. Bortel.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, a new study published by the Stanford Law and
Policy Review suggested that even sharply higher government
estimates made recently for bailing out the industry are far
too low. The journal, published by Stanford University, cited
a computerized financial model of the thrift debacle's total
costs, compiled by Sheshunoff Information Services Inc.,
Austin, Texas. The model includes costs often excluded by
administration officials, such as lost tax revenue and
interest on Treasury debt. It puts the cost of the bailout at
roughly $456 billion over 10 years, compared with a General
Accounting Office estimate of $325 billion to $500 billion
over 30 years. The Sheshunoff study asserted that total costs
will certainly exceed $1 trillion, including the interest due
on long-term Treasury bonds financing the bailout.</p>
<p>On Friday, when asked at a conference in Washington, D.C.,
how the government was proceeding in its effort to unload its
huge inventory of troubled institutions, Federal Deposit
Insurance Corp. Chairman William Seidman said: "Better than
you think and worse than you would like."</p>
