	<p class="article-leader">COLLEGEVILLE, Minn. -- For the first 21 years of his life,
Dave Durenberger lived here in the protective shadows of a
Benedictine monastery on the shores of Lake Sagatagan.
Brother Ed was the plumber, Father Alfred taught him English.
He explored Catholic theology and ethics with Father Emeric.
   The other morning, Father Vincent Tegeder talked about the
young man who grew up in the little lay community of
Flynntown on the abbey grounds and then went just up the hill
to St. John's University. Thumbing through an old St. John's
annual, Father Vincent found this prediction, both eerie and
ironic: "Dave intends to put Flynntown on the map by
reforming national politics."</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Instead, Mr. Durenberger is living out the final episodes
of an agonizing morality tale.</p>
<p>Since early 1989, the Minnesota Republican's personal
finances have been the subject of a Senate Ethics Committee
inquiry into a host of alleged ethical breaches and rules
violations. Next week, the committee begins two weeks of
public hearings -- probably televised in Minnesota -- in
which the senator faces potentially devastating testimony
from former aides and political supporters who helped
structure his complex and controversial deals.</p>
<p>And even if he manages to settle the case without
resigning or being expelled from the Senate, his career,
based in the clean-government oasis of Minnesota, is in
tatters. "People here are never going to support a guy who is
in the position of trying to cop a plea with the Ethics
Committee," says Hyman Berman, a University of Minnesota
historian.</p>
<p>Tall and trim with graying temples, 55-year-old Dave
Durenberger is Central Casting's idea of a senator. His fall
is like a film noir version of "Mr. Smith Goes to
Washington," with all the familiar ingredients of a political
career gone sour: power, money and sex. But unlike other
Washington scandals, this one has an unlikely, even tragic
protagonist: the first commanding officer of the St. John's
ROTC, protege of two reform governors of Minnesota, a man
once regarded as among the most promising Republican senators
of his generation.</p>
<p>"This," says former Republican Gov. Elmer L. Andersen, "is
the saddest political story I have ever seen."</p>
<p>Sen. Durenberger expresses hope that the ordeal will soon
be behind him, but his aides, after promising an interview,
decided that he shouldn't talk further about his case at such
a sensitive stage.</p>
<p>The unraveling of Dave Durenberger is the story of a man
whose life, once so pastoral, was roiled by tragedy, then
beset by inner doubt and finally tainted by scandal.</p>
<p>Mr. Durenberger, the oldest of five children, grew up in a
white clapboard house with olive shutters; his neighbors were
the abbey bus driver, the custodian and the manager of the
dairy herd.</p>
<p>His father, known universally as "Big George," had been a
revered St. John's football star, remembered for an 82-yard
punt. But he left his most enduring imprint as a coach and
athletic director for more than four decades. Father Emeric
Lawrence calls George Durenberger, who now lives in Florida,
"big, deeply Republican and very honest." The senator's
mother, Isabelle, a secretary, was the university's first
female employee.</p>
<p>Dave was an important figure on campus himself, a serious
student and avid participant in class discussions. Father
Emeric remembers his dissent over an article called "Inroads
of the Bourgeois Spirit," where the young man argued that the
dangers of the acquisitive urge were being overdrawn.</p>
<p>But St. John's and its ethos of work, study and prayer
left its imprint. "He was as much a part of St. John's as you
could be without wearing a habit," says Albert Eisele, a
former press secretary for Vice President Walter Mondale who
knew Mr. Durenberger at school.</p>
<p>Harold LeVander, a partner in former GOP Gov. Harold
Stassen's law firm, hired him right out of law school. "He
was young, aggressive, full of energy and personality,
idealistic -- just the kind of guy I was looking for," Mr.
LeVander says. In short order, Mr. Durenberger established
himself as a joiner, becoming a director of the Chamber of
Commerce, legal counsel of the Minnesota Young Republican
League, division chairman of the United Fund, state advocate
of the Knights of Columbus and a member of both the Elks and
the Lions.</p>
<p>When Mr. LeVander ran for governor in 1966, Mr.
Durenberger, seeking to exploit a contretemps over highway
funding, helped craft an early negative campaign ad that, in
the middle of the Batman television craze, proclaimed: "Holy
scandals, Batman]" When Mr. LeVander won, he took Mr.
Durenberger with him as executive secretary. Mr. Durenberger
put together the staff and worked with the legislature.</p>
<p>But his wife, Judy, developed cancer. Gov. LeVander and
his wife, Iantha, were at the hospital when she died in 1970
at age 31. Mr. Durenberger, 36, was left the sole parent of
four sons, the oldest just seven.</p>
<p>"He was totally devastated," says U.S. Judge Paul
Magnuson, a long-time friend. "It was upwards of a year
before he returned back to the normal Dave."</p>
<p>After Mr. LeVander decided against another term, former
Gov. Andersen, then the president of H.B. Fuller Co.,
recruited Mr. Durenberger to attend to the philanthropic
activities that that company took so seriously. "He really
cared about people, about being a factor," Mr. Andersen
recalls.</p>
<p>In 1978, Mr. Durenberger set his sights on winning the
governorship for himself. But then-Republican National
Chairman Bill Brock and party operative Charles Black
persuaded him to run instead for the Senate seat left open by
the death of Hubert Humphrey. Mr. Durenberger won his first
bid for office.</p>
<p>In Washington, his Mr. Clean image made him a natural for
the recently formed Senate Ethics Committee -- the very panel
that now is deciding his fate. And after just two years, he
became chairman of an important Finance subcommittee. He
plunged into Washington life with a relish, taking unusual
pleasure in the substance and small print of legislative
issues like Medicare and Social Security.</p>
<p>But the Democrats were gunning for him, their fervor
stoked by the conviction that no Republican should sit in
Hubert Humphrey's seat. In 1982, their candidate was Mark
Dayton, a department-store heir who spent over $7 million,
much of it his own money. In 1988, their candidate was state
Attorney General Hubert Humphrey III. Mr. Durenberger won
both elections, but they were bruising campaigns.</p>
<p>It was around the time of the first of these re-election
races that Mr. Durenberger began to depend ever more heavily
on special-interest money. Between 1983 and 1988, he
collected $1.8 million in political-action committee
contributions, more than all other senators but four in that
time.</p>
<p>While he was chairman or ranking Republican on the Finance
Committee's pivotal health subcommittee, Mr. Durenberger
received more medical and health PAC money than any other
senator. Still, contributors often know they are buying
access rather than votes from lawmakers, and indeed Mr.
Durenberger has bucked the powerful American Medical
Association, which has fed him both campaign contributions
and honoraria, on such issues as tighter Medicare cost
controls and physician payments.</p>
<p>Some Durenberger observers say they noticed a political
callousness in him after the difficult 1982 campaign. But he
was also capable of great emotional generosity. When his
legislative director, Ralph Neas, was stricken with a
paralyzing disease on a Minnesota trip and was hospitalized
for months, Mr. Durenberger spent hours at his bedside --
even though Mr. Neas, on a respirator, couldn't communicate.</p>
<p>"He tried hard to make me feel included in what was going
on back in Washington," says Mr. Neas, now the executive
director of the Leadership Conference on Civil Rights. "I'll
never forget that."</p>
<p>Within the Senate, Mr. Durenberger was something of a
loner. Some of his colleagues found more than a hint of
arrogance in his introspective, even scholarly demeanor. Even
so, he continued his rise, becoming co-chairman of the
powerful Senate Intelligence Committee. Outside the Senate,
Mr. Durenberger's life seemed to be falling apart.</p>
<p>Two of his children developed severe drug problems. His
second wife, Penny, a Vietnam-war widow who helped raise the
four Durenberger boys, never took to the rituals of politics.
"It was not an easy marriage at any time," says former Gov.
Andersen. The senator's office announced a separation in
early 1985, and he moved into The Cedars, a Christian retreat
residence in Arlington, Va.</p>
<p>At the same time, the newspapers were full of lurid
stories about Mr. Durenberger, including details of an affair
with a 28-year-old secretary who worked in his office. Mr.
Durenberger did not dispute the accounts. There was a petty
incident in which he was charged with disorderly conduct for
refusing to wait in an airport cab line. He publicly admitted
that he was undergoing a midlife crisis. The expense of
seeing a marriage counselor in the Boston area who
specialized in helping Christian couples preoccupied the
senator, as did the financial burden of college costs for his
sons.</p>
<p>Just as his personal and family problems were mushrooming,
however, his income was coming under pressure. In 1983, Mr.
Durenberger had collected a huge $93,750 in honoraria for
making speeches, bringing his total income to $163,550 that
year. As chairman of the Finance subcommittee on health, he
had a captive, special-interest audience of health care
providers, hospitals, medical groups and pharmaceutical
companies.</p>
<p>The next year, however, new Senate ethics rules took
effect, capping honoraria at 30% of salary. Mr. Durenberger's
income fell to $92,980 ($72,200 in salary; $20,780 in
honoraria).</p>
<p>In late 1984 Gary Diamond, a member of Mr. Durenberger's
health subcommittee, offered what must have seemed like a
perfect solution to his financial problems: He would publish
a book by the senator. Royalties and other income from books
fell outside the new income limits. "My reason for doing this
was to get a small publishing company off the ground," says
Mr. Diamond. "For the senator, it was a way to get his ideas
published in book form."</p>
<p>Although Mr. Diamond's previous book ventures were limited
to sports, including a volume on wrestling holds, he hoped to
lure other lawmakers to his new venture.</p>
<p>According to the agreement, Mr. Diamond would bear the
cost of publishing Mr. Durenberger's first book, a collection
of speeches and position papers on defense. The senator would
promote it before audiences that invited him to make
speeches. But the speaking fees would go to Mr. Diamond's
Piranha Press. Once Mr. Diamond's printing costs and profit
margin were covered, Mr. Durenberger would get a stipend for
helping to sell books.</p>
<p>The plan worked so smoothly at first that Mr.
Durenberger's first book, "Neither Madmen nor Messiahs," was
quickly followed by "Prescription for Change," on health
policy. Mr. Durenberger earned $38,375 from Piranha in 1985
and $62,500 in 1986, pushing his income back to its robust
pre-1984 level.</p>
<p>Nearly 100 companies, trade associations and lobbying
groups that invited him to speak in 1985 and 1986 sent
honoraria to Piranha Press, including Drexel Burnham Lambert,
Salomon Brothers and a host of health-care organizations.
Oddly, many of the health groups paid Piranha fees in 1985 --
even though the health book wasn't published until the
following year.</p>
<p>At some of the book promotion appearances, there weren't
even any books. Mr. Diamond says that his small company
wasn't equipped to handle distribution, and that some groups
didn't want to bother with transporting the volumes. "I
couldn't force them to take books," he says.</p>
<p>In addition, 40 of the groups that paid honoraria to
Piranha also supplied transportation and other services to
Mr. Durenberger, none of which were listed, as Senate rules
require, on his financial disclosure statements for 1985 and
1986. (Mr. Durenberger last July amended his disclosures to
include these gifts.)</p>
<p>He also accepted $5,000 in limousine services during his
many book-promotion speeches in Boston. (The ethics panel
investigated whether he might have pressured lobbying groups
to offer him speaking engagements in the Boston area as a way
of underwiting the costs of his marriage counseling, but
found insufficient evidence to pursue such charges.) On six
occasions, Mr. Durenberger made paid appearances on Senate
grounds, another apparent violation of the rules.</p>
<p>The ethics committee has also been investigating a
transaction involving a Minneapolis condominium Mr.
Durenberger owned and stayed in during trips back home. In
1984, he sold the condo to a partnership he formed with a
wealthy political supporter. The partnership agreement wasn't
signed until mid-1984, but records show that Mr. Durenberger
claimed rental-expense reimbursement from the Senate for
several months in 1983. Moreover, the partnership documents
were backdated to 1983 by a notary, a longtime supporter of
the senator's.</p>
<p>Mr. Durenberger has said that he wasn't aware the
documents he signed had been backdated, and last January he
repaid the Senate $11,005 after the Rules Committee decided
he wasn't entitled to expenses incurred when he stayed in the
condo during congressional recesses.</p>
<p>Although this isn't yet included in the Ethics Committee's
bill of particulars, the panel has also subpoenaed the
financial records of a foundation, Americans for Generational
Equity, that Mr. Durenberger helped create in 1984 and
chaired until last December. Also of potential interest to
the panel are nearly $1 million in loans the senator received
from a St. Paul bank over 10 years, some without collateral
and some at low interest rates, according to the Minneapolis
Star Tribune newspaper, which reported the loans in February.</p>
<p>Mr. Durenberger has admitted paying insufficient attention
to his personal finances. His close friends have different
theories of how the alleged breaches may have occurred. Some
blame his former top aides and attorneys for slipshod advice.
Others say he was preoccupied with fundraising for his
re-election campaigns or his personal problems.</p>
<p>Almost everyone who knows him says Mr. Durenberger isn't
money-hungry. "Getting rich never concerned him," says Roger
Ailes, the senator's media adviser since 1978. "He has the
kind of mind {that} he could be making a million a year at a
law firm. But he never wanted that."</p>
<p>Paul Hewitt, the senator's former aide, believes Mr.
Durenberger lost his emotional moorings in Washington.
"Everywhere a senator goes, people are giving them things and
reinforcing their sense of supreme importance," Mr. Hewitt
says. "For someone with a weak sense of identity, it can
change your personality. His sense of self was not enough to
withstand these pressures. He came to believe he was above
the rules. His own personal needs, wants and desires
{overwhelmed} other things."</p>
<p>But Mr. Durenberger himself said in a Wall Street Journal
interview in 1986: "There's a premise this office, by its
very nature, destroys people -- but I don't believe that. The
place and the office are given too much credit for the
deterioration of personal relationships, and the individual
is not given enough of the credit or blame."</p>
<p>Though he and his wife were reconciled in 1986, a friend
describes their relationship as "legally on" but still
troubled.</p>
<p>Sen. Durenberger was once formally criticized by the
Ethics Committee for the appearance of divulging national
security information at a 1987 Florida fund-raising event.
But the current case is much more serious. It is now in the
investigative trial phase, in which there is an open hearing
on the charges, and only two previous Ethics Committee
inquiries have gotten that far. In 1979, Democratic Sen.
Herman Talmadge of Georgia was formally denounced for
reprehensible handling of government money. Mr. Talmadge lost
his bid for reelection in 1980. In 1982, the Ethics Committee
recommended the expulsion of New Jersey Democrat Harrison
Williams for his role in the Abscam bribery case, but he
resigned before he could be kicked out.</p>
<p>As if those weren't bad enough omens, the ethics panel is
itself under pressure to look tough in the Durenberger case,
the first of an unprecedented seven investigations on its
agenda. After this case is resolved, the panel moves on to
the Keating Five -- the senators accused of improperly
intervening on behalf of savings-and-loan executive Charles
Keating. With so much of the Senate's ethical credibility on
the line, panel members don't want to be accused of
whitewashing.</p>
<p>According to several people close to the Durenberger
inquiry, the senator has conceded he would handle his
financial dealings differently if he could do them again, but
says any rules violations were unintentional. For the last
several weeks he and his chief lawyer, James Hamilton, a
veteran defense lawyer who was assistant chief counsel to the
Senate Watergate committee, have been negotiating a possible
settlement with the ethics panel.</p>
<p>The sources say that Sen. Warren Rudman of New Hampshire,
the Republican co-chairman of the six-member bipartisan
panel, is insisting on stiff terms -- something short of
expulsion but stronger than a reprimand. Mr. Rudman and other
members of the panel decline to comment.</p>
<p>Mr. Durenberger's personal problems were generally viewed
sympathetically in Minnesota, but the voters apparently are
having a much more difficult time overlooking the book and
real-estate deals. In January, the Star Tribune newspaper
published a statewide poll showing his approval rating
plummeting to 41% from 73% last fall. A few local papers have
called for his resignation.</p>
<p>Mr. Durenberger now is fighting a war on many fronts: in
the Ethics Committee; in his Senate duties, where he is
waging what one aide calls "an effectiveness campaign"; and
in Minnesota, where at Christmastime he flew around the state
to apologize publicly for "mistakes and bad lapses in
judgment on these matters."</p>
<p>Even so, he continued last year to accept large amounts of
honoraria for speaking to special-interest groups. Most of
the other senators facing ethics inquiries abstained from
taking honoraria.</p>
<p>Through it all, Mr. Durenberger has sought solace and
solutions in religion. "It doesn't surprise me that he should
retreat into religion at times of crisis," says Father
Emeric, his old St. John's religion teacher. "I wouldn't be
surprised if he felt more comfortable in that setting than in
the public life."</p>
<p>Last fall, he went on a Christian fellowship tour of 21
countries and met with Mother Teresa and the Dalai Lama. In
between meetings on the ethics case, he dashes to prayer
groups, sometimes more than once a day.</p>
<p>Former Democratic Gov. Richard Lamm of Colorado, an old
friend, acknowledges that Mr. Durenberger probably broke some
rules, but says, "In a world full of politicians who don't
stick their heads up, he was an exception."</p>
<p>Then Mr. Lamm adds: "In Washington, there's survival of
the unfittest."</p>
