	<p class="article-leader">SYDNEY, Australia -- Alan Bond's ambitions as a media
mogul were dashed during the weekend when the Australian
entrepreneur lost control of his nationwide television and
radio empire.
   Early Saturday, directors of Bond Media Ltd. agreed to
turn over control of the company to Kerry Packer, a publisher
and investor, who is the richest person in Australia.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Mr. Packer sold the top-rated Channel Nine television
network to Mr. Bond in 1987 for about A$1 billion (US$767.7
million). If Saturday's complex transaction is approved by
regulators, bank lenders and Bond Media shareholders, Mr.
Packer will regain control of the network at a fraction of
the price he sold it for.</p>
<p>The agreement came two days after two units of General
Electric Co., of Fairfield, Conn., offered to inject funds
into the debt-burdened company in return for a stake of about
15%.</p>
<p>The GE units -- National Broadcasting Co. and GE Capital
Corp. -- proposed to join Hellman & Friedman, a funds
manager, in investing A$200 million. Bond Media directors
Friday rebuffed the offer, saying it was "highly
conditional." But they said they would consider any revised
version.</p>
<p>Warren Jones, chairman of Bond Media, said Sunday on
Channel Nine that he will continue talks with the U.S. group,
although the chances "are slim" that a U.S. plan will
supersede Mr. Packer's.</p>
<p>Mr. Packer's agreement with Bond Media came about because
his closely held Consolidated Press Holdings Ltd. is owed
A$200 million from when Mr. Bond bought Channel Nine. Mr.
Packer demanded repayment of the debt and threatened court
action to liquidate Bond Media.</p>
<p>Under Saturday's accord, Mr. Packer will convert his debt
-- held in the form of preference shares and overdue interest
-- into ordinary shares of Bond Media. That effectively gives
him nearly 60% of the company, Mr. Jones said.</p>
<p>Bond Corp. Holdings, Mr. Bond's floundering flagship
company, will see its interest in the media concern diluted
to about 9% from 52%. A Bond family company will hold 3%,
while Bell Resources Ltd. -- run by Mr. Bond until he lost
control of its board in December -- will own as much as 20%.
Minority shareholders will hold the rest.</p>
<p>The proposal involves a reconstruction of Bond Media's
shares and an issue of rights and options. Mr. Packer
receives control of the board and will become chairman of the
company in August. The operation will chop A$300 million off
Bond Media's debt, which early this year was stated at A$699
million. A sale of radio stations will further lower the
figure.</p>
<p>Bond Media stock was sold to investors in 1987 at A$1.55 a
share. It closed Friday at 14 Australian cents.</p>
<p>Mr. Jones said directors didn't have much room to
maneuver. That became especially true when the Australian
government last month limited total foreign ownership in
television stations to 20% and the stake of any one foreign
investor to 15%.</p>
<p>To ward off Mr. Packer, Bond Media discussed possible
capital infusions with NBC, CBS Inc., Paramount
Communications Inc., and Television New Zealand Ltd. Mr.
Jones said Canberra's decision torpedoed those talks and
dropped Bond Media into Mr. Packer's lap.</p>
<p>But he conceded that Bond Media's link to Bond Corp.
complicated its efforts to attract funds. If Bond Media had
"a stronger parent company," he said, Mr. Packer likely
wouldn't have gained control.</p>
