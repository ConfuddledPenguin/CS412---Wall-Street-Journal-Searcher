	<p class="article-leader">When engineer Gerry Schwartz sought money to start a
business several years ago, luck was with him: He found some
angels.
   But later -- as his company failed -- he learned that
finding a moneybags who thinks your company has a wonderful
future can turn into a mixed blessing. Often neither
entrepreneur nor investor fully realizes the frustrations
ahead. Both sides end up sadder and wiser -- and poorer.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Yet companies depend more than ever on angels, as
individual investors -- usually wealthy ones -- are called.
For all the attention paid to venture-capital firms, private
investors back more than 30,000 start-up companies a year,
while venture funds back only about 2,000, says William E.
Wetzel, professor of management at the University of New
Hampshire.</p>
<p>Angels have become even more important now that
venture-capital funds have turned cautious. Shying away from
start-ups, the funds increasingly focus on financing
companies at later stages of development. And angels are
becoming more visible now; several organizations, such as
Venture Capital Network, Durham, N.H., have emerged to put
entrepreneurs in touch with individual investors.</p>
<p>Some angels -- often those who were entrepreneurs
themselves -- know as much about starting a company as
venture-fund managers who make their living financing
start-ups. But many angels don't anticipate the amount of
time and money it takes to build a company, says Prof.
Wetzel.</p>
<p>A typical disappointed angel is Gus Owen, a Southern
California real estate developer, who backed two of Mr.
Schwartz's ideas. Mr. Schwartz started his first company,
Voice Prints Inc., a Newport Beach, Calif., maker of
voice-recognition systems, with about $500,000 raised from
Mr. Owen and other investors.</p>
<p>Mr. Schwartz enjoyed a flying start, landing big contracts
with McDonald's Corp. and Amway Corp. The company even went
public. But developing the complex voice-recognition
equipment, which was used, for example, to order at drive-in
restaurants, "took longer than we thought, and we'd try to
make it up in volume and get behind in everything," Mr.
Schwartz says. The original investors declined to invest more
cash. And no institutional investor would come to the rescue.
In 1988, the company closed its doors.</p>
<p>Since then, Mr. Owen invested $300,000 over 14 months in a
second company started by Mr. Schwartz, Voice Command &
Control Inc. This San Clemente, Calif., concern makes
voice-verification software rather than the entire system.</p>
<p>After no return on his investment, Mr. Owen decided
against investing any more money. "We did not have the
experience to invest in high-tech companies, and it was
obvious to us after a period of time that we were out of our
league," he says. "I have finally realized that's it's best
for me to stay in real estate."</p>
<p>(However, Mr. Schwartz found another angel -- Pat
Anderson, an employee in the real estate company owned by Mr.
Owen's wife -- who helped VCCI to stay alive.)</p>
<p>Another problem is that entrepreneurs often need guidance
from investors as well as cash. Unlike venture capitalists,
who may have worked with start-ups for years, inexperienced
angels often can't help.</p>
<p>James M. Kormos, president of American Health Products
Inc., says the Orange, Calif., firm raised $8 million from
private investors. But in eight years of operation, it didn't
show a profit until last April.</p>
<p>Among other problems, the product -- a wireless,
light-weight monitor that tells when the wearer stops
breathing -- was redesigned to obtain health regulators'
approval. Originally intended for use only on infants, it was
modified for adult hospital patients as well. Besides, the
company was the target of an abortive takeover attempt last
year that halted business.</p>
<p>The company resumed operations last January. But Mr.
Kormos thinks he missed out by not having a venture fund
behind him. "Venture funds are in tune with the specific
markets that they invest in. They would have understood the
gestation period required for this type of product, probably
better then we did."</p>
<p>To be sure, seasoned angels know what to expect. If
investors "are going to get in, they have to sit around and
be prepared to double or triple what they put in and ride the
company through tough times," says Henry M. Morgan, who runs
Innovative Capital Partners a Waltham, Mass., company that
raises private capital.</p>
<p>Given the commitment frequently required, some think that
angels should simply steer clear of capital-intensive
businesses. "Can companies that need an ongoing capital
infusion really depend on individuals? My answer is, probably
not," says Jeffrey P. Parker, an entrepreneur who's now an
angel himself. He recommends that angels invest in companies
that can quickly turn out a product.</p>
<p>In 1980, Mr. Parker launched Technical Data Corp. -- which
published an electronic commentary on the government bond
markets -- with $100,000 raised from 15 individuals in
exchange for a 10% stake. When the company was sold in 1986,
the angels made a profit of more than $20 for every dollar
invested, Mr. Parker says.</p>
<p>But his second venture, started in 1982, was a
cash-guzzler. And the company, Business Research Corp. of
Boston, encountered a problem common to companies financed by
angels that later turn to venture-capital funds for
financing.</p>
<p>To keep going, the company "needed money every two
months," Mr. Parker says. But when the company tapped venture
capitalists, it found they placed a lower value on the
concern than the original backers had.</p>
<p>Angels often "overprice the deal," when they first come
in, says the University of New Hampshire's Mr. Wetzel. "So,
when a venture-capital firm does come in, there may be some
disgruntled early-stage investors who find that the venture
capitalists don't price the company as highly as they did.
Moreover, there's some dilution of their capital."</p>
<p>One way an entrepreneur can avoid a nasty shock in
later-stage financings is to play it safe the first time and
avoid "pie-in-the-sky" valuation, Mr. Parker says. And
investors can take hope from the fact that if the company
flourishes, so will its valuation. "If you've done it often
enough, you know that you have to ride the valuation back
up," says Mr. Morgan.</p>
