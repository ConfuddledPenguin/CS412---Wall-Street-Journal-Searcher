	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Takeovers and program trading lifted stocks
yesterday, adding some excitement to a sluggish trading day.
   The Dow Jones Industrial Average added 18.57 to 2899.26.
Volume totaled about 130,200,000 on the New York Stock
Exchange, where advancing issues barely stepped ahead of
declining shares 775 to 744.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The narrow breadth was reflected in the smaller rise of
broader market measures. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock
index gained 1.52 to 359.54, an advance equal to an 11-point
gain in the Dow industrials. Stock-index arbitrage buy
programs helped boost volume in a day of otherwise slow
trading, reflecting the approach of the July Fourth holiday.</p>
<p>Some takeover excitement returned to the stock market with
Forstmann Little & Co.'s $44.50-a-share, or $1.6 billion,
buy-out agreement with General Instrument Corp. General
Instrument's stock soared 8 7/8 to 45 1/8 on volume of 3.3
million shares. Also, Kay Jewelers received a $17-a-share, or
$328.1 million, offer from Ratners Group of Britain. Kay
Jewelers climbed 3 3/8 to 14 1/4 on 1.5 million shares. The
two stocks were the largest gainers in percentage terms on
the Big Board yesterday.</p>
<p>Traders said the acquisition offers enlivened takeover
speculators' interest in several other stocks. Avon Products,
for example, gained 5/8 to 37 3/8; McGraw-Hill rose 1 to 57
1/4, and American depositary receipts of Glaxo Holdings PLC
rose 1 to 30.</p>
<p>"I think we are seeing the beginning of takeovers in
industries like technology, where there is overcapacity and
opportunities for restructurings, mergers and
consolidations," Michael Metz, chief market analyst at
Oppenheimer & Co., said. "A lot of industrial companies are
underleveraged, and banks are looking for respectable
borrowers."</p>
<p>Outside of takeover speculation and futures-related
buying, investors bought auto and financial service stocks.
Ford gained 5/8 to 44 3/8. Federal National Mortgage
Association rose 1 1/8 to 41 3/4; Federal Home Loan Mortgage
rose 2 1/4 to 77 3/4.</p>
<p>Ralston Purina closed 1 1/2 higher at 93 3/8. A
Prudential-Bache Securities analyst, John McMillin, increased
his earnings forecast for the stock to $1.40 a share, on a
fully diluted basis, for Ralston's fiscal third quarter just
ended; the company earned $1.18 a year earlier. He raised his
full-year forecasts to $6.10 a share for fiscal 1990 ending
in September, and to $7 a share for all of 1991. "Operating
trends have been much more stable" at Ralston, Mr. McMillin
said. He added that the company is an "aggressive" buyer of
its own stock.</p>
<p>Shearson Lehman Hutton produced its 42nd annual list of
"Ten Uncommon Values in Common Stocks." Among the recommended
issues: Johnson & Johnson rose 1 7/8 to 69 5/8; Contel gained
1 1/4 to 27; Cable & Wireless gained 1 1/8 to 30 5/8; Acuson
added 1 3/4 to 40 1/2, and Unum went up 1 3/8 to 54 3/4.</p>
<p>Shearson's list also included Interpublic Group, which
went up 1/4 to 35; Newell, up 3/8 to 32 3/8; Nord Resources,
up 7/8 to 18 1/2, and Schlumberger, down 3/8 to 57 1/8. Adobe
Systems, the only over-the-counter stock to make the list,
gained 1 1/4 to 38.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, in its most recent look at corporate dividends,
Standard & Poor's Corp. found that 65 companies increased
dividends last month, down 26% from a year earlier. The
number of companies decreasing dividends rose to 14 in June,
compared with eight in the same month last year. Companies
omitting dividends doubled to 18.</p>
<p>"Corporations are wary of increasing dividends and are
husbanding cash because of the poor earnings environment,"
said Joseph Tigue, managing editor of the S&P "Outlook"
newsletter.</p>
<p>N.V. Philips dropped 7/8 to 16 7/8. The company projected
a loss of about $1.07 billion for the year, including
restructuring charges of about $1.44 billion that it plans to
take in the second half. Its restructuring proposal calls for
about 10,000 employees to be trimmed from the work force,
mostly in Europe.</p>
<p>Smith Corona fell 7/8 to 5 3/8. The company said that it
expects to report "a small loss" for the June quarter and
that its board will consider cutting the quarterly dividend
to about five cents a share from 15 cents.</p>
<p>Prime Motor Inns tumbled 1 1/8 to 7 7/8, after saying it
expects a "substantial" loss for the fiscal year ending next
June, including about $150 million in charges for additional
reserves and asset write-downs.</p>
<p>Elsewhere on the takeover front:</p>
<p>-- Rorer Group gained 1 3/8 to 70. Rhone Poulenc moved
another step closer to completing its merger with the
company, as the French firm received U.S. clearance to
proceed with an offering of contingent value rights to Rorer
shareholders.</p>
<p>-- Milton Roy climbed 2 5/8 to 25 1/2. On Friday,
Sundstrand disclosed that it holds a 14.99% stake in the
company, bought with a possible takeover in mind.</p>
<p>-- MGM/UA Communications dropped 5/8 to 16 5/8. Time
Warner, which previously decided against providing Pathe
Communications with $650 million in financing for its
proposed acquisition of MGM/UA, has filed a $100 million suit
against Pathe in a dispute growing out of the companies'
financing talks.</p>
<p>-- Kollmorgen slid 1/4 to 12. The company purchased all of
its common shares owned by Vernitron, which staged an
unsuccessful proxy fight for board seats in May, under a
10-year standstill agreement.</p>
<p>Also, Ferro fell 1/2 to 25 on volume of one million
shares, after soaring 4 3/8 points Friday on news that
investor Jon M. Huntsman received clearance to acquire as
much as 15% of its common shares.</p>
<p>Long Island Lighting gained 3/4 to 20 on volume of 1.6
million shares, following an appeals court decision, issued
late Friday, which upheld the company's agreement with
customers in 1989 to reduce electric rates by $390 million
over 10 years. The court rejected efforts to overturn the
settlement as too small.</p>
<p>Responding to the ruling, Kidder Peabody upgraded its
investment opinion on Lilco to the firm's top rating. Douglas
W. Preiser, an analyst, told Dow Jones Professional Investor
Report that the decision, in which the court also upheld a
lower court's overturning of a racketeering verdict, "removes
a big boulder" that had been hanging over the company.</p>
<p>Also, Prudential-Bache Securities and Salomon Brothers
reiterated "buy" recommendations on Lilco stock, following
the appeals court ruling, according to the investor report.
Analysts at all three firms said they expect the utility to
proceed later this summer with a 50% dividend increase
proposed under the settlement.</p>
<p>Several other utility stocks also were actively traded on
the Big Board, including SCEcorp, which was unchanged at 37
1/2 on 1.5 million shares; Pacific Gas & Electric, which
dropped 1/8 to 23 1/8; Teco Energy, which went up 1/2 to 29
1/2; Potomac Electric Power, which added 1/4 to 21, and
PacifiCorp, which closed unchanged at 21 1/4.</p>
<p>McDonnell Douglas gained 1 5/8 to 38 1/8. A group headed
by Menke Titola Capital, a San Francisco buy-out firm,
acquired the company's computer maintenance and distribution
business for $65 million.</p>
<p>The American Stock Exchange Market Value Index fell 1.07
to 360.14. Volume totaled about 9,850,000 shares, compared
with about 14,720,000 Friday. Advancing issues totaled 230
and declining issues 369, and 229 were unchanged.</p>
<p>American Science & Engineering fell 1/2 to 6 1/8. The
company reported a loss of 43 cents a share for its fiscal
fourth quarter, ended in March, compared with a slight profit
in the year-earlier period.</p>
