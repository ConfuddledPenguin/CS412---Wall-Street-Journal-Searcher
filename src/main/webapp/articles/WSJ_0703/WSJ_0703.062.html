	<p class="article-leader">MOSCOW -- Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev faced down
mounting criticism from left and right with a resounding
defense of his policies and a call for unity at the opening
of the Soviet Communist Party Congress.
   He defied the conservative charge that perestroika, or
restructuring, is to blame for the Soviet Union's social and
economic crises, calling it "nonsense." The situation
"dictates the imperative need to accelerate and radicalize
economic reform," he said.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"Either society goes along the road of the deep
transformations that have begun . . . or anti-perestroika
forces will get the upper hand, and then dark times are in
store for the country and the people."</p>
<p>Perestroika and glasnost, or openness, have guided the
country's changes since Mr. Gorbachev unveiled the twin
policies at the last nationwide party meeting in 1986. At
first, they sparked sudden and radical improvements in the
intellectual and economic life of the country. But in the
past year, people have grown almost blase about glasnost, and
Mr. Gorbachev himself admitted that perestroika hadn't
averted a sharp economic decline.</p>
<p>But Mr. Gorbachev said the leadership was learning from
its mistakes. "It is above all essential to bear in mind the
incompleteness of perestroika itself," he said. "We are in a
transitional period in which the dismantling of the old
system -- and still less the building of the new one -- has
not been completed."</p>
<p>The 4,700 delegates to this week's congress are deeply
divided over how the party can keep its power and public
support from eroding completely. Radical reformers have
threatened to split off if the congress doesn't change the
party fundamentally. Rightists demand a return to rigid
definitions of communism and some are even calling for the
resignation of Mr. Gorbachev as party head. Even before Mr.
Gorbachev spoke, a delegate from the Magadan region in
Siberia took the floor and demanded the Central Committee and
Politburo resign.</p>
<p>Mr. Gorbachev urged the delegates to work for unity and
abandon "petty passions." He said that a split would
strengthen other political forces such as nationalism, as
happened in the Baltics. He didn't mention the Baltic
independence movements specifically, but called for the
speedy creation of a new all-union treaty that would enable
the Soviet Union's 15 republics to become sovereign states
and still remain united.</p>
<p>Mr. Gorbachev has managed to stay in power and keep
divisiveness in bounds through a savvy playing off of right
against left. His two-hour speech yesterday was an artful
answer to the simmering anxieties of both sides. He called
for more and deeper reforms, including removing the party
from a management role in government and industry, a clear
nod to left and centrist members. At the same time, he
rejected a redesign of the party leadership that would
eliminate the all-powerful Politburo, saying the basic
structure should remain as it has been for decades.</p>
<p>Agitated members had demanded a complete accounting from
party leaders of what they had done in the past five years to
bring the nation to such a crisis. Mr. Gorbachev acknowledged
that he had made mistakes in carrying out his policies. But
he also pointed the finger at some of his closest allies and
harshest critics.</p>
<p>Mr. Gorbachev lashed out at Prime Minister Nikolai
Ryzhkov's most recent economic reform plan for the
"absurdity" of making price increases the first step,
although he himself surely signed off on the program at the
time. Then he took a swipe at conservative Politburo members
for sabotaging crucial agricultural reform for their own
ends.</p>
<p>He also took on hard-liners, including military leaders,
who have accused him of giving in to the West by withdrawing
forces from Eastern Europe. "Deep changes are taking place in
Eastern Europe. Some say it is a collapse of socialism, but
we counter: What socialism? A variety of the Stalinist
authoritarian and bureaucratic system that we ourselves have
abandoned."</p>
<p>The very ideology of Soviet socialism must change, Mr.
Gorbachev said, tackling one of the most emotionally
provocative themes of the meeting. The party, as he described
it, is "emphatically against dogmatic and pedantic reasoning
and in favor of a consistently creative approach. . . . " The
party's purpose, he said, is "humane and democratic
socialism."</p>
