	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- At first glance, Nashua Corp. seems to want
for focus.
   It has four seemingly unrelated and unglamorous
businesses, and though it has annual sales of more than a
half-billion dollars, few Wall Street analysts follow it.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>But those who do say its shares are cheap, and they would
seem to have a point. The Nashua, N.H., manufacturer is
selling at only 10 times estimated 1990 earnings.</p>
<p>"We have it rated as a good, strong solid buy," says
Prudential-Bache analyst Alex Henderson. "Cash flow is
strong. It has a quality balance sheet. And it doesn't take a
lot of reinvestment."</p>
<p>With many manufacturers, low share prices are the fruit of
too much debt. But Nashua has a balance sheet that would
qualify it for Debtors Anonymous. As of the end of 1989,
long-term debt as a percentage of capital was a cool 7.6%.</p>
<p>Even after its recent buy-back of roughly 30% of its
shares, Nashua's total debt is only about $20 million. It
could more or less pay that off with its cash on hand.</p>
<p>Nashua's cash cow is mail-order photofinishing -- which
produces high returns on assets and requires relatively
little reinvestment. Marketing under names such as York Photo
Labs, Nashua dominates mail-order photofinishing in the U.S.,
Canada and Britain. Its other strong business is
manufacturing hard disks for computers.</p>
<p>Nashua also makes office supplies, such as toners for
copiers and printers; and "coated products," such as
facsimile papers, pressure-sensitive tapes and labels. These
are slow growers.</p>
<p>But Nashua's businesses do have a tie that binds. In an
era when corporate America is hung up on financial
engineering, Nashua is hung up on nuts-and-bolts
manufacturing. Its chairman, Charles Clough, a 59-year-old,
33-year company veteran, is a devotee of W. Edwards Deming,
the quality-control guru who has been revered in Japan and
largely ignored at home.</p>
<p>Mr. Clough took the helm in 1983, when Nashua almost
bankrupted itself by trying to compete with the Japanese in
making copiers. Since then, Mr Clough says: "We probably have
a greater appreciation for the value of cash." He also has
developed a Japanese-like obsession with quality.</p>
<p>Mr. Clough is forever sermonizing about the need to
involve workers at every organizational level. "If you have a
product you should work on continuing to improve it, which is
what the Japanese do," he says. "So often, we and others,
after we fix a process, tend to ignore it."</p>
<p>Though the concept sounds cliched, analysts say it works.
"The tie that binds Nashua is that it's one of the best
manufacturers in the country," says Harry Wells, an analyst
with Adams Harkness & Hill. "They have put into practice all
of the buzzwords about quality control."</p>
<p>Nashua's earnings have, ironically enough, recently
suffered because of an equipment-maintenance failure at one
plant. Mr. Clough says that is proof merely of the need for
constant vigilance.</p>
<p>As evidence of its emphasis on quality, Mr. Wells notes
that Nashua exports computer disks to -- among other
countries -- Japan. And he says it has sufficiently reduced
inventories, a high-cost item, to have refurbished a former
warehouse into a corporate cafeteria.</p>
<p>Nashua's low share price might seem reasonable, given that
manufacturing is cyclical and sensitive to the economy.
However, in photofinishing and computer disks -- Nashua's two
businesses with the best potential for growth -- analysts say
demand is strong.</p>
<p>In 1990, Nashua's first-quarter net from continuing
operations was $3.6 million, up from $1.4 million a year
earlier. For the year, Prudential-Bache's Mr. Henderson
forecasts net of $3.90 a share (based on an estimated 6.3
million shares outstanding at year-end).</p>
<p>The disk business is cyclical and highly competitive, but
Mr. Clough, who tends toward understatement, says: "You can
safely say we are in an up cycle. This area should grow quite
significantly."</p>
<p>Last year, Nashua had free cash flow, after dividends, of
almost $20 million. Mr. Henderson says the figure should
easily top that this year. That is, one assumes, why a group
led by cash-sensitive Mario Gabelli recently acquired a 5.8%
stake in Nashua. It also begs a question: what will the
company do with its excess cash? Mr. Clough's cryptic
response is that "in this environment, cash won't be a
problem. I think it presents an opportunity." Certainly, an
acquisition by Nashua is possible.</p>
<p>Ordinarily, one would be concerned that Nashua's
hard-earned cash might be ill-spent. But, in the case of Mr.
Clough -- who Mr. Henderson calls "a nuts-and-bolts operating
guy who doesn't like taking risks" -- that seems unlikely.</p>
