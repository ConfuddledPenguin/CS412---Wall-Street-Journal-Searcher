	<p class="article-leader">The Los Angeles school board has relented to public
pressure and voted 6-1 to expel kids who bring guns to high
schools or junior highs. Knives and BB-guns are still not an
automatic cause for dismissal in the 610,000-student
district. Board member Rita Walters, from a central-city area
worst affected by campus violence, was a holdout to the end,
saying that firearm-toters should instead be taught to "write
and read and compute . . . so they have a sense of
belonging." Her constituents seem to have a better sense of
where those characters belong and don't belong.</p>
