	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- The Office of Thrift Supervision approved a
temporary relaxation of restrictions that last year's
savings-and-loan bailout law placed on the size of S&L loans
to an individual borrower.
   But the relaxation didn't satisfy industry groups that had
pushed for a broader change. Real estate, construction and
S&L industry groups had argued that the new rules were
forcing thrifts to turn away viable projects and loans.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The bailout law reduced the size of loans a thrift can
make to a single borrower to 15% of the thrift's capital, the
same limit that applies to banks. Previously, thrifts had
been allowed to loan as much as 100% of their capital to an
individual borrower. Critics said the higher level was risky
because big losses on a single loan could push a thrift
toward insolvency.</p>
<p>Under the relaxation, which was expected, thrifts that
meet the bailout law's capital requirements for 1995 will
have until the end of 1991 to meet the 15% limit. Through the
end of this year, the well-capitalized thrifts can loan as
much as 60% of their capital to a single borrower. Beginning
Jan. 1, 1991, the limit drops to 30%. Loans made under the
rule must be for U.S. residential housing and must be secured
by first liens on real estate. Currently, about 1,100 thrifts
meet the 1995 capital requirements and can take advantage of
the transition rule.</p>
<p>OTS Director Timothy Ryan said the rule was temporarily
relaxed because of the "potential adverse effects of such a
sudden reduction."</p>
<p>But industry groups said the transition rule actually
provides little relief. "It doesn't seem like they did much
of anything," said David Danovitch, regulatory counsel with
the National Council of Savings Institutions. He said the
bailout law already included a permanent exception for
well-capitalized thrifts to lend as much as 30% of their
capital for residential housing projects. Small businesses
and non-housing borrowers won't be helped by the rule.</p>
<p>"At small thrifts, one guy who's the local car dealer
might also want a loan for his house. That can approach 15%
pretty quickly," Mr. Danovitch said. "And there aren't always
other sources of credit."</p>
<p>But with Congress and bank and thrift regulators wary of
granting special treatment in the wake of the S&L crisis, the
OTS isn't likely to make any further moves to relax the 15%
limitation. Bank regulators have argued thrifts will have to
begin arranging syndications of loans as many banks do.</p>
