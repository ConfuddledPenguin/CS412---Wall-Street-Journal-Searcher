	<h3>With These Flags, All One Needs Is A Bridge or Gridiron --- Americans Are Keen to Set Marks, but Some Banners Are Too Big for Flagpoles</h3>

	<p class="article-leader">Some people's idea of the perfect American flag is one so
big no one would ever have to ask: "Oh, say can you see . .
.?"
   Len Silverfine, an East Coast adman, has twice held the
world record in the big-flag category. His first attempt, for
which he formed the Great American Flag Co., was a red, white
and blue job 50% bigger than a football field. Constructed by
a team of flag and sail makers, it had stars that were 11
feet across and stripes 15 feet high. The thing weighed 3,000
pounds and took 50 men to hoist.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Of course, no flagpole is big enough to support such a
behemoth. So Mr. Silverfine planned to hang his banner on the
Verrazano Narrows Bridge, to mark the nation's Bicentennial
in 1976. The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey
approved, and the makers of Arm & Hammer baking soda agreed
to underwrite the undertaking.</p>
<p>But during a trial run-up, disaster struck. A modest
breeze on New York Bay tore the thing to shreds. "I had tears
in my eyes," Mr. Silverfine recalls.</p>
<p>Such setbacks haven't deterred people who get stars in
their eyes when they think of the flag and like to do things
in a big way. Their interest hasn't flagged. Last year,
wholesale flag sales in the U.S. increased 15%, to an
estimated $60 million.</p>
<p>Flag makers are quick to point out that bigness isn't
necessarily bestness where Old Glory is concerned. The bigger
the banner, the harder it is to get it aloft, they say.
Furthermore, big flags make a racket when they flap in the
wind, and they are particularly vulnerable to damage and
destruction. So it can be said they cause a good deal of
free-floating anxiety.</p>
<p>Yet none of this seems to stop Americans who wish to
display their patriotism, not on their sleeve but by the
acre. Here are some stories for the Fourth about five such
creations.</p>
<p>Mr. Silverfine created this flag -- now said to be the
world's largest -- to replace the one that didn't fly on the
Verrazano Narrows Bridge. Made of polyester the quality of
grass-catcher bags and reinforced with seat-belt webbing,
this 7.7-ton beauty, 411-by-210 feet, was engineered to
withstand the elemental blows that felled his first flag. But
this one didn't even make it to the bridge: He couldn't raise
the million bucks he needed to rig and store it there.</p>
<p>So, on June 14, 1983 -- Flag Day -- Mr. Silverfine and his
supporters unloaded the flag at the White House as a gift to
the American people. With the flag spread out on the Ellipse,
near the White House lawn, President Reagan accepted it,
remarking, "Who could stand before this scene with Old Glory
unfurled in all its majesty across the area of two football
fields and not feel their heart fill with pride?"</p>
<p>Mr. Reagan might also have mentioned that traditional
respect (and the federal Flag Code) calls for it never to
touch the ground. But this flag is so big that there's little
else that can be done with it. This flag mainly has
languished in a faded, 40-foot-long, red, white and blue
trailer in a federal warehouse. The disappointed Mr.
Silverfine says he had hoped it would be hauled out and shown
off on the grass in front of the Washington Monument every
Flag Day, but that was not to be.</p>
<p>Ski Demski's Creations.</p>
<p>Ski Demski of Long Beach, Calif., is known for his flags
all over this blue-collar town. Day and night, he flies a
60-by-30-footer over the building where he lives and runs a
mail-order business in bumper stickers. (Flag etiquette calls
for flags to be taken down before sunset.) On holidays, Mr.
Demski runs up his 82-by-47-footer -- the one he had made in
1981 to celebrate the return from Iran of the Americans held
hostage there. He has a 300-by-160-footer, too, but he keeps
that one in a red, white and blue hearse.</p>
<p>He put up his 132-foot flagpole after seeing other such
constructions towering over auto dealerships along the San
Diego Freeway. His neighbors don't all share his enthusiasm.
City officials questioned whether such a tall pole should be
erected in a residential area, but they relented. Later, his
flag, snapping in the wind during a rainstorm, brought
complaints that he was disturbing the peace. He appeared in
municipal court on charges, later dismissed, that he was
violating noise laws.</p>
<p>The Hudson Flag</p>
<p>This standard, first displayed in 1949 by the J.L. Hudson
Co. department store in downtown Detroit, was considered the
biggest American flag on Earth. Still extant, it is a
235-by-104-foot affair -- little more than a quarter the size
of the Great American Flag. Weighing a ton, it once dangled
over the side of the now-shuttered building -- extending down
seven stories. Hudson put it up -- or, rather, down -- for
ceremonial occasions.</p>
<p>It finally was donated to the Smithsonian Institution in
1977. And it was such a handful for curators that it went
into storage, the most common location of very big flags.</p>
<p>Mary Jo Jansson, of Houston, has since saved it from
obscurity.</p>
<p>Ms. Jansson, a contralto who sings "God Bless America"
with the verve of Kate Smith, persuaded the Smithsonian to
let her borrow the Hudson flag for display on a federal
building on Flag Day in 1984. Later that year, the
Smithsonian gave it to her and her backers to keep.</p>
<p>Since then, Ms. Jansson has made appearances with the flag
at patriotic occasions and sporting events across the
country. She sings and seeks donations to establish a final
resting place for her flag and Mr. Silverfine's orphaned
emblem. Her main aim in her capacity as president of the
Great American Flag Association (Box FLAG, Flagtown, N.J.):
To raise $100 million and build an exhibition hall.</p>
<p>On the GW Bridge</p>
<p>A mere scrap compared with the others, this banner --
measuring 60-by-90 feet and weighing not all that much more
than a professional wrestler -- 450 pounds -- is actually
manageable. Owned by the Port Authority of New York and New
Jersey, it is stored in a tower of the George Washington
Bridge crossing the Hudson between Manhattan and New Jersey.
It is rigged for display on nine national holidays each year,
and will be up there tomorrow.</p>
<p>The Authority says it is the world's largest free-flying
flag -- which experts say isn't true. "Free-flying,"
according to the Authority, means it hangs in the air. But
the Guinness Book of World Records says Brasilia, the capital
of Brazil, boasts the biggest flag flown from a flagstaff. It
measures 328 feet by 230.</p>
<p>Learning of the Guinness entry, James Hinnigan,
maintenance supervisor of the bridge, refines the claim. His
is the largest free-flying American flag.</p>
<p>Flag experts agree that size doesn't matter. A little one
does the job just as well as a big one. "Any flag of the
nation speaks an eloquent message of freedom and liberty, no
matter how big or small it is," says George Cahill, president
of the National Flag Foundation, a Pittsburgh group devoted
to the frequent and proper display of the Stars and Stripes.</p>
