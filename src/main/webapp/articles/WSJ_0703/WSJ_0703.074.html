	<p class="article-leader">Virtually every American knows where he comes "from."
There are native Americans, of course -- Indians, Eskimos,
Hawaiians -- but most of us came here from someplace else.
   The lore of American families typically includes an
immigration experience -- their own or that of a
not-too-distant relative. For many of us, though, such
memories are fading. Today, only about 6% of the population
is foreign-born, compared with about 9% 50 years ago and
nearly 15% a century ago.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>On the eve of Independence Day, we asked 13 prominent
naturalized Americans to write a few words about their
experiences as immigrants. Here are their replies:</p>
<p>Madeleine Kunin</p>
<p>Governor of Vermont</p>
<p>Born: Zurich, Switzerland -- 1933</p>
<p>Naturalized: New York City -- 1947</p>
<p>On June 10, 1940, when we stepped off the SS Manhattan in
New York, we were greeted by our cousins, in all their
American finery. I well remember Irene Kahn, in her red hat,
red shoes and red handbag. I was dazzled. This is America.</p>
<p>Irene took one look at my straight bob and bangs, and
declared in her heavily accented Bronx English: "Mudlin, this
is America. You gotta have coils. In America, all the goils
have coils."</p>
<p>To be just like everybody else, that was what I wanted
most as an immigrant child. Cream cheese and jelly
sandwiches, on white bread with the crusts neatly cut off,
precisely like the sandwiches my friends' mothers made.</p>
<p>I remember being hushed in the subway when my brother and
I spoke in the Swiss German dialect. It was wartime, and any
sounds that resembled German provoked nasty looks, or worse
yet, confrontation. To correct the misunderstanding that
Swiss German was the same as German, my mother pinned Swiss
flags on our lapels. I felt confident that with this insignia
I would be secure.</p>
<p>My mother, who brought her two children to America alone,
in fear that Hitler would invade Switzerland, made us
impatient with her seemingly slow assimilation. I did not
fully appreciate until later that she gave us the vision of
the American dream.</p>
<p>Quite simply, she believed it: Anything was possible in
America. Horatio Alger was not a folk tale. It was history,
and it was expected that we would follow in his footsteps.</p>
<p>John Kenneth Galbraith</p>
<p>Economist, Harvard professor emeritus</p>
<p>Born: Iona Station, Ontario, Canada -- 1908</p>
<p>Naturalized: Boston -- 1937</p>
<p>In the late spring of 1934 I arrived in Washington, newly
endowed with a Ph.D., to view the New Deal. Economists, a
blessed matter, were in short supply in those exciting days.</p>
<p>A University of California professor of mine, now high in
the Agricultural Adjustment Administration, told me that I
was greatly needed and must go to work at once. In the next
day or two I emerged as an associate agricultural economist
in the AAA at the then-munificent salary of $3,200 annually.
No one asked was I a citizen, which I was not. I was asked if
I was a Democrat and this I strongly affirmed.</p>
<p>Thus the relation between a benign and civilized
government and its immigrants.</p>
<p>Alex Kozinski</p>
<p>Judge -- Court of Appeals, Ninth Circuit</p>
<p>Born: Bucharest, Romania -- 1950</p>
<p>Naturalized: Los Angeles -- 1968</p>
<p>Learning English for everyday use was one thing; mastering
its nuances was quite another. Matters were complicated by
the fact that my primary connection to American culture was
the TV and endless hours of "The Andy Griffith Show," "Father
Knows Best," "The Donna Reed Show" and "Leave It to Beaver."
Were real American families like that?</p>
<p>I got my chance to find out when a schoolmate, Andrew
Reineke, invited me home for dinner. Was this my chance to
meet Ward, June and Wally Cleaver? With some apprehension, I
accepted. No little Jewish boy with a thick Romanian accent
had ever shown up in Mayberry; there was no script for this
episode. I would have to wing it.</p>
<p>Andrew and I found Mr. Reineke in the rec room. "Tell me,
Alex," he asked, "why did your family come to America?"</p>
<p>I've heard that question a thousand times but I've never
figured out how to answer it. How do you explain the obvious?</p>
<p>"Are you pushing my leg, sir?" I replied. "We came to
America for the same reason as everyone -- because we could."</p>
<p>At dinner, after grace, plates of food were passed around
"American style," as I had seen on television. I was helping
myself to mashed potatoes when Mrs. Reineke confronted me
with a fateful question: "Would you like a glass of milk?"</p>
<p>"No, thank you, ma'am. I don't drink," I heard myself
answering. Had I just claimed to be a teetotaler or a camel?
I attempted a tactical retreat: "What I meant to say is that
we have plenty of milk at home."</p>
<p>"So, what do you plan to do?" Mr. Reineke growled, "run
home between courses?"</p>
<p>The rest of the dinner was uneventful. I said little, and
managed to avoid more verbal snakepits.</p>
<p>The school year was over soon, and Andrew and I parted
ways. I went back to my television and mused about how much
easier life in America would be if we all had scripts to
follow.</p>
<p>Mervyn Dymally</p>
<p>Congressman (D., Calif.)</p>
<p>Born: Cedros, Trinidad, British West Indies -- 1926</p>
<p>Naturalized: Los Angeles -- 1957</p>
<p>Nothing makes me prouder to be an American than when I
visit former British colonies in the Caribbean, Africa and
Asia and say to those who once were my fellow British
subjects. "Here I am, a former colonial, serving in the
greatest deliberative body in the world, the United States
Congress."</p>
<p>After the Watts riots, the State Department sent me (then
a California state assemblyman) to the Caribbean to talk
about how democracy was still alive in America. That
assignment took me back to St. Benedict's (Secondary)
College, where I had failed the senior exam.</p>
<p>After my lecture, a young man stood up and asked: "Mr.
Dymally, are there any opportunities for blacks in America?"</p>
<p>I replied: "If a black American were to come to Trinidad,
could he run for your Parliament and win?"</p>
<p>The young man paused and said: "Honestly, no."</p>
<p>I said: "Here I am a Trinidadian, a black man, who went to
the United States, ran for the California state Legislature
and won." I ended my speech.</p>
<p>Bob Hope</p>
<p>Comedian</p>
<p>Born: Eltham, England -- 1903</p>
<p>Naturalized: Cleveland -- 1910</p>
<p>I don't remember much about the trip from England to the
United States. It's been a long time since I was four years
old. And what I remember may really be the constant
recollections of my mother and brothers. I do remember
running around the ship and that it was hot and noisy. (We
occupied two steerage cabins directly above the main drive
shaft.)</p>
<p>Mahm carried a souvenir of the trip for her entire life,
thanks to me. When it was time for the customary vaccination
of all the immigrants on board, Mahm lined us all up for our
shots. When it came my turn I bolted and ran. They caught me
and held me and amid howling and squirming I got the needle.
Mahm reached down to comfort me and got some of the vaccine
on her left thumb and for the remainder of her life she
carried a cicatrix as a reminder of that incident.</p>
<p>My brothers used to tell me that on the train ride from
Ellis Island to Cleveland all the Hope boys sang -- and then
embarrassed Mahm by passing the hat for coins. But she got
even by washing our underclothes and hanging them out of the
window to dry.</p>
<p>Michael Blumenthal</p>
<p>Chairman of Unisys;</p>
<p>Limited partner, Lazard Freres</p>
<p>Born: Oranienburg, Germany -- 1926</p>
<p>Naturalized: Trenton, N.J. -- 1952</p>
<p>In one important respect, my immigrant experience
parallels that of others who have come to these shores: the
tradition of Americans accepting immigrants as individuals
who are judged by what they can do, rather than by their
family or background or on the basis of where they came from.
This was my experience when I arrived as a 21-year-old
immigrant in San Francisco in 1947.</p>
<p>On my third day here, with no more than $60 but lots of
ambition and dreams, I went job hunting. The man who hired me
told me at once that his own father had come here as a young
man and worked his way up from the bottom while attending
college at night. He said he'd give me a break so that I
could try to do the same. Only 14 years after arriving here,
and nine years after receiving my citizenship, I was
appointed a deputy assistant secretary of state and, soon
thereafter, sent abroad to represent my new country as a U.S.
ambassador. What better proof that this remains an open
society for immigrants?</p>
<p>Anthony Frank</p>
<p>Postmaster General</p>
<p>Born: Berlin -- 1931</p>
<p>Naturalized: Los Angeles -- 1943</p>
<p>I came here from Nazi Germany in 1937 at the age of six.
My parents, both Ph.D.s, had arrived a year earlier, with my
father having found employment as a messenger on Wall Street
and my mother as a professor at Bryn Mawr College. I often
ask my wealthy, highly educated friends if they could make
such a transition in middle age. We soon resettled in
Hollywood, Calif.</p>
<p>I remember my father, Dr. Lothar Frank, taking his exams
for citizenship: "How many members of Congress are there?"
"Five hundred forty-one," said my father. "Wrong," said the
examiner, "there are only 535." My father said: "You have
forgotten there are six observers from places such as the
Virgin Islands and the District of Columbia." "I didn't know
that," said the examiner.</p>
<p>I have attempted to fulfill my obligation to this country
by a number of public service positions, culminating in my
being the first immigrant to head the Postal Service. The
Postal Service, which employs one out of every 150 employed
Americans, is itself a melting pot and the gateway to the
middle class for hundreds of thousands of native-born and
immigrant Americans.</p>
<p>Ruth Westheimer</p>
<p>Sex therapist</p>
<p>Born: Wiesenfeld, Germany 1928</p>
<p>Naturalized: New York 1965</p>
<p>I was born in Germany, in 1928, was sent to an orphanage
in Switzerland during the war, and emigrated to Palestine in
1945, where I was a member of the Haganah, fighting for
Israel's independence. I later went to France to study at the
Sorbonne, and in the fall of 1956 I came to this country as a
tourist. I ended up staying.</p>
<p>I arrived on the liner Liberty, traveling in fourth class.
On the night before we came into New York harbor, I didn't
sleep a wink, fearing I would miss seeing the Statue of
Liberty. I took a room in Washington Heights, decided I
wanted to see Times Square, more than 100 blocks south, and
started to walk there. I had heard that Americans don't like
to walk, so I wasn't surprised when a large man, whom I
stopped to ask directions, tried to dissuade me, but it made
me laugh when he asked this person who had arrived here with
almost no money in her pocket why she didn't just drive
there.</p>
<p>As I walked around New York in those first days, it was
like being in a dream. Amazing sights were everywhere, but
one I remember very vividly was of strikers picketing Macy's,
smoking cigars. In Europe, cigars were only for the very
rich, yet here even men who weren't collecting a paycheck
could afford them.</p>
<p>One of my first major purchases was a second-hand sewing
machine; I thought I could support myself with it if need be.
I paid that machine off, a few dollars at a time, every week.
I still have it, but part of my personal American Dream is
the hope that I'll never have to use it again.</p>
<p>Ilena Ros-Lehtinen</p>
<p>Congresswoman (R., Fla.)</p>
<p>Born: Havana, Cuba -- 1952</p>
<p>Naturalized: Miami -- 1972</p>
<p>One of my sharpest memories about being a "Cuban refugee"
was standing in line in downtown Miami's Freedom Tower with
my family and hundreds of other newly arrived Cubans waiting
to receive U.S. government-issued boxes of powdered milk,
cheese and processed meat.</p>
<p>Those were confusing times for all Cuban families who came
to this country fleeing Fidel Castro and his communist thugs.
Many of us came with round-trip tickets, always thinking that
our stay in Miami would be momentary, merely a matter of days
or weeks. The weeks turned into months and the months into
years and now, 30 years later, we look through our dusty
closets searching to see if we still have the other part of
the round-trip ticket and wondering if we will ever get the
chance to use it.</p>
<p>Although I have come a long distance from that line for
giveaway food, part of me is still there. The lines are now
filled with Haitian and Nicaraguan faces, but on several
occasions I would swear I've seen a little girl who looks
just like me. May her 30 years in exile be as fulfilling as
they have been for me. And may she become the first Haitian
or Nicaraguan woman in Congress. The opportunity is there.</p>
<p>Henry Kaufman</p>
<p>Economist</p>
<p>Born: Wenings, Germany -- 1927</p>
<p>Naturalized: New York -- 1942.</p>
<p>I came to America when I was 10 years old. The question
before my family had been whether to leave our comfortable,
middle-class existence and cross the ocean to the unknown.
The decision was made for us one night when, following a
torchlight parade, the Nazis broke into our house.</p>
<p>Shortly after our arrival, I went to the local public
school. The principal tried to evaluate my English-language
skills. He pointed to his hand, fingers and nose and I
responded by saying the correct words because they were the
same in German. Of course, he quickly realized that I did not
know any English at all. I was put in the first grade, where
I was the oldest and the tallest child.</p>
<p>Going to college was assumed as a matter of course by my
parents. Because of the burden this would pose for them, I
pushed hard to complete my undergraduate work in 2 1/2 years
and then took just one year to qualify for a master's degree.
I earned my Ph.D. at night over seven years while I held a
full-time job. Later, I was fortunate that Charles Simon, a
partner at Salomon Brothers, recognized my work. He
introduced me to Sidney Homer, of the bond market research
department, who gave me my first job there.</p>
<p>This country gave me the opportunity first to survive and
then to succeed by obtaining an education that enabled me to
move along with the help of professors and business
associates. This is typical of what America provides
immigrants.</p>
<p>Saul Bellow</p>
<p>Novelist</p>
<p>Born: Lachien, Quebec, Canada -- 1915</p>
<p>Naturalized -- 1941</p>
<p>I was born in Canada in 1915, was brought to Chicago by my
parents in 1924 and became a citizen in 1941. My father
simply forgot to tell me that I had never been naturalized
and after Pearl Harbor I was astonished to learn that I was
still a Canadian, so I turned myself in to the immigration
service, filled in the necessary papers and was sworn in
together with 40-50 other greenhorns.</p>
<p>Rudy Boschwitz</p>
<p>Senator (R., Minn.)</p>
<p>Born: Berlin, Germany -- 1930.</p>
<p>Naturalized: New York -- 1942</p>
<p>We arrived in the U.S. on the last trip of the SS Majestic
on Dec. 23, 1935, and were scheduled to become U.S. citizens
on Dec. 9, 1941, two days after the U.S. entry into World War
II. Instead, the day before, we became enemy aliens, and not
long after the FBI came to check us out. I shared a room with
two brothers who were in their 20s and was already in bed
when the FBI arrived. They went through our home very
carefully and found one of my brothers' address books and
began reading off the names of young women; I gave them a
running commentary and evaluation.</p>
<p>We were never allowed to forget our immigrant status, and
it has not been a deterrent. It made us work harder, perform
better, never quit and when combined with some pretty tough
times, it enhanced what my family has contributed to society
and our country.</p>
<p>Stan Stephens</p>
<p>Governor of Montana</p>
<p>Born: Calgary, Alberta, Canada -- 1929</p>
<p>Naturalized: Havre, Mont. -- 1954</p>
<p>My experience as a Canadian immigrant varied considerably
from that of immigrants who must master a new language and
adapt to a different culture. There's very little difference
between life in Calgary, Alberta, and life in most Western
American communities.</p>
<p>When I settled into a career in broadcasting in Havre,
Mont., in the late '40s, most of my new friends were either
unaware, or found nothing extraordinary in my having been
born and reared in Canada. The U.S. Army, too, paid little
attention to the fact that I was a Canadian, because in 1951
it sent me a draft notice. I could have refused on the
grounds of being a foreign citizen. But because I had already
decided to apply for citizenship, I felt the same obligation
as any other American when called upon to serve.</p>
<p>Following service in Korea, I applied for citizenship.
This was granted by Montana District Judge C.B. Elwell in May
1954. On the appointed day, I appeared in court with the
other candidates. Judge Elwell, whom I knew quite well,
assumed I was there in my capacity as a radio newsman to
cover the proceedings. When I told him I was one of the
candidates for naturalization, his somewhat amazed response
was, "Well, Stan, I guess you'd better get in line with the
other foreigners."</p>
<p>One can always reflect on what might have been. In jest, I
have told my good friend, Al Shaver, sportscaster for the
Minnesota North Stars hockey team and with whom I started
broadcasting in Canada in 1948, that had I remained in Canada
I probably would be announcing the play-by-plays for the
Minnesota North Stars. To which Al has replied: "And had I
immigrated to the States, no doubt today I would be governor
of Montana."</p>
