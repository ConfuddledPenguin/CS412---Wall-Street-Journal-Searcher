	<p class="article-leader">PHILADELPHIA -- Arnold Staloff, former president of New
York's Commodity Exchange Inc., became president and chief
executive officer of a specialist and market making firm on
the Philadelphia Stock Exchange.
   The company, renamed Bloom Staloff Corp., from Bloom &
Co., was founded in 1985 by James Bloom, 46 years old, who
becomes chairman of the firm. Mr. Staloff will hold a
substantial equity interest in the new company.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Mr. Staloff, 45, was president of the Comex from August
1989 until his resignation in April. Previously, he was head
of marketing and new product development at the Philadelphia
exchange, and president of its Philadelphia Board of Trade
subsidiary. Mr. Staloff began his career at the Securities
and Exchange Commission in 1969.</p>
<p>During his 16 years with the Philadelphia exchange, Mr.
Staloff played a key role in the introduction of foreign
currency options and development of a stock index-like
product called Cash Index Participations (CIPs) that became a
bone of jurisdictional contention between the SEC and the
Commodities Futures Trading Commission.</p>
<p>"For me this is an opportunity to enter an
entrepreneurship mode and capitalize on my knowledge of the
market," said Mr. Staloff. He also added that he is delighted
to be re-entering the Philadelphia Stock Exchange community.
He said that he hopes to resume working with the exchange and
contribute ideas about new products through committee
assignments.</p>
<p>The new firm, Bloom Staloff Corp., will continue the work
of its predecessor, Bloom & Co., which was one of the largest
specialist firms on the Philadelphia exchange.</p>
