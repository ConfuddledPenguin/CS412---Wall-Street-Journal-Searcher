	<p class="article-leader">SEATTLE -- Forget Bonnie and Clyde. Lawmen here are
calling Jane Lunbeck and her all-woman Dumpster divers the
bank-robbery ring of the '90s.
   Ms. Lunbeck and her four other gang members didn't make
their money busting through bank doors brandishing machine
guns. They did it the hard way. "They'd go through the
Dumpsters behind the banks looking for stuff," says King
County Deputy Prosecutor Brenda Bannon.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>What they found would have made Willy Sutton smile.</p>
<p>"Loan applications, credit reports, signature cards,
deposit slips and thousands of checks," says Detective Denise
Pentony of the King County fraud unit. Detective Pentony says
the gang used the throwaways to tap bank accounts of
unsuspecting customers for at least $250,000. She adds that
several gangs are working the Dumpsters behind dozens of
banks in the Seattle area.</p>
<p>Ms. Lundbeck and another gang member told police they used
the checks and other material to make it seem they were
depositing funds. Then they asked for part of the bogus-check
proceeds in cash, using material from the trash to back up
the request. Ms. Bannon says banks rarely asked for proof of
identity.</p>
<p>The scheme came to light after customers began complaining
to banks about unauthorized withdrawals from their accounts,
police say.</p>
<p>Detectives say trash pickers line up to get at the most
popular Dumpster. "Word has gotten around that there's a gold
mine out there," says Detective Pentony.</p>
<p>Even Ms. Lunbeck says she was taken aback by the Dumpster
contents. Interviewed at the King County jail, where she has
been residing since she pleaded guilty last month to using
the trash to steal from banks, the 32-year-old says, "I was
surprised at what was in there." With charges pending in
several more counties, she declines to elaborate.</p>
<p>Police say one branch was so careless with its trash it
even threw out a memo from bank headquarters warning about
Ms. Lunbeck's activity. The women told police they stayed
away from the bank after they found the memo.</p>
<p>Police say they're frustrated by banks' lackadaisical
efforts to foil Dumpster divers. "It's going to take more
than a little lock on a Dumpster to stop these people," says
Kent, Wash., Detective Glenn Woods, who arrested Ms. Lunbeck.
"If you could take a bank for $1,200 a day without using a
gun, wouldn't you do it?"</p>
