	<p class="article-leader">GORBACHEV DEFENDED his policies as a Soviet party congress
got under way.
   The Soviet president faced down mounting criticism from
left and right with a call for unity at the opening of the
Communist Party forum in Moscow. He rejected conservative
criticism of his social and economic restructuring as
"nonsense." The situation "dictates the imperative need to
accelerate and radicalize economic reform," Gorbachev
declared. The 4,700 delegates to the congress are split over
how the party can retain power and prevent public support
from eroding.</p>

economic blockade completely following the republic's
decision to suspend its independence bid.</p>

<p>IMELDA MARCOS WAS ACQUITTED of all charges in her
racketeering trial.</p>
<p>A federal jury in New York acquitted the former Philippine
first lady of charges that she used $200 million allegedly
stolen from the Filipino government to buy jewelry, artwork
and real estate in the U.S. The jury also found Adnan
Khashoggi innocent of the charges against him. The Saudi
businessman was accused of helping to conceal ownership of
Marcos property. The lack of evidence -- and doubts that a
U.S. court was the proper venue -- hurt the prosecutors'
case, jurors said.</p>
<p>Marcos backers immediately claimed the verdict as a
victory not only for her, but as a vindication of her late
husband, Ferdinand, who died in September.</p>

<p>ABOUT 1,400 MOSLEMS DIED in a stampede of pilgrims in the
city of Mecca.</p>
<p>The people suffocated or were trampled in a pedestrian
tunnel leading to the Saudi Arabian city, witnesses said.
They said the stampede began when some pilgrims stopped in
the air-conditioned tunnel and there was a rush outside of
people pushing to escape the 112-degree heat. They also said
the ventilation system appeared to fail. According to one
diplomat, most of the victims were Malaysians and
Indonesians.</p>
<p>The stampede shattered what had been a peaceful observance
of the annual Hajj, or pilgrimage, and was the worst incident
in recent years.</p>

<p>East German factory workers staged a series of warning
strikes after the weekend economic merger with West Germany.
The protests were said to be aimed at getting better salaries
and working conditions, but some workers were also hoping to
apply pressure to prevent their plants from having to shut
down.</p>

<p>Bush met with aides in Maine to prepare for a NATO summit
he said will bring changes but no "bombshell" in the
alliance's military strategy. The president is expected to
urge NATO to overhaul its policy for repelling a Soviet
attack by making the use of nuclear arms an unlikely last
resort. The London summit begins Thursday.</p>

<p>Rebels surrounded Monrovia, cutting all major land routes
out of the Liberian capital and severing telephone and telex
links, according to guerrilla sources. Water and electricity
supplies to the city were halted last week after the
insurgent forces captured a waterworks and hydroelectric dam.</p>

<p>NASA engineers are focusing on a small misalignment of
fuel tanks on two space shuttles as they search for hydrogen
leaks that have grounded the shuttle fleet. The mystery of
the leaks is throwing the shuttle schedule into disarray and
is threatening to delay at least two missions that are
planned this summer, according to NASA officials.</p>

<p>Mandela addressed the Irish Parliament, alluding to
Ireland's fight against "unrelenting tyranny" to gain
independence from Britain in the 1920s. The black leader also
asked British leaders to follow the example of the Pretoria
government and not require a truce before talking with the
Irish Republican Army.</p>

<p>Panama has filed 16 criminal charges against toppled
dictator Noriega, including charges of murder, torture,
human-rights violations and drug trafficking, authorities
said. Noriega was ousted by a December U.S. invasion and has
been awaiting trial in Miami on drug-trafficking charges.</p>

<p>Israel's Shamir appealed to Egyptian President Mubarak to
take the initiative and work for Mideast peace. The Israeli
prime minister's statement, made in Jerusalem to a delegation
sponsored by U.S. lobbyists for Israel, coincided with an
Israel Radio report that Bush had written to Mubarak urging
an Israeli-Egyptian summit meeting.</p>

<p>Yugoslavia splintered further as the republic of Slovenia
adopted a declaration on full state sovereignty and another
republic, Serbia, battled an independence declaration by
ethnic Albanians in Kosovo province.</p>

<p>Provincial authorities will negotiate with Communist
rebels in the Philippines rather than use military force to
try to obtain the release of a U.S. Peace Corps member,
according to local officials. The 26-year-old volunteer was
kidnapped on June 13.</p>
