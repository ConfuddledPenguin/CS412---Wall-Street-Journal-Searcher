	<p class="article-leader">Monoclonal Antibodies Inc. said it is negotiating a
possible stock-for-stock merger with a larger, closely held
biotechnology firm. The other company wasn't identified.
   Monoclonal officials said they would remain as the
surviving entity in any resulting merger, but said that no
decision has been reached regarding details of the proposal.
The transaction would require approval by the boards of
directors and shareholders of Monoclonal and the other
concern, company officials said.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Such a merger would help provide Monoclonal with
much-needed capital without the company issuing more equity,
an analyst said. The Sunnyvale, Calif., biotechnology concern
has been plagued by class action and copyright-infringement
lawsuits that have deeply cut into the company's earnings
since 1987.</p>
<p>"This is not something we would have normally announced,
but we felt the disclosure was required for our report to the
Securities and Exchange Commission," said Thomas Glaze, the
company's chief executive officer.</p>
