	<p class="article-leader">Heritage Media Corp. of Dallas said a continuing legal
dispute could affect its $39 million offer to acquire the 43%
of New York-based POP Radio Corp. that it doesn't already
own.
   The owner of television and radio stations said it has
been informed that Thomas Dilk, a former POP Radio employee
and a plaintiff in one of two class action suits whose
settlement was a condition of the acquisition, hasn't
withdrawn his assertions that his attorney wasn't authorized
to enter the settlement agreement. The class action involving
Mr. Dilk arose from an earlier acquisition proposal by
Heritage, the company said.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Heritage said it believes the situation involves a dispute
between Mr. Dilk and his attorney. The company hasn't
concluded what action it will take in response to the
situation. Heritage said its current acquisition offer
expires Oct. 31.</p>
<p>POP Radio provides customized radio programs.</p>
