	<p class="article-leader">The highest-quality American-built car is . . . a Toyota?
   That's right, at least according to J.D. Power &
Associates, whose list of the "Top 10 Trouble-Free Cars" was
released yesterday. The big winner in this closely watched
survey -- which triggers a blizzard of advertising each year
-- was Toyota Motor Corp. It had:</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>-- The highest-ranking individual car, the 1990 Toyota
Cressida. Cressida owners reported fewer problems during
their first 90 days of ownership than owners of any other
model car.</p>
<p>-- The highest-ranking brand, Lexus. The two models sold
by Toyota's new luxury nameplate averaged fewer problems than
those of any other brand. The Toyota brand itself ranked No.
3, behind only Lexus and Mercedes-Benz.</p>
<p>-- The most trouble-free U.S.-built car, the compact
Toyota Camry. The Camry placed third overall, behind the
Cressida and the Mercedes-Benz E-series. Cressidas are built
in Japan and Mercedes-Benzes in Germany, but 85% of Camrys
sold in the U.S. are built in Georgetown, Ky.</p>
<p>For the second straight year, the top Big Three brand was
Buick, which ranked No. 5 overall. The Buick LeSabre ranked
sixth among individual cars, higher than any other Big Three
model.</p>
<p>Few Americans actually will see the details of the study
in this month's Power Report, which is a limited-circulation
newsletter. But consumers will hear a lot about it from the
car makers that fared well. The Power survey has become both
a closely watched report card on cars and nameplates, and a
powerful marketing tool.</p>
<p>"I'm not aware of anyone else who has the clout Power
has," says David Danzer, corporate marketing manager for
Toyota's U.S. sales arm. And Toyota plans to use that clout.</p>
<p>The Japanese auto maker will cite the Power surveys in
print advertising scheduled to make its debut next Monday.
What's more, says Mr. Danzer, Toyota will highlight its
strong showing in subsequent ads for the 1991 models due out
this fall.</p>
<p>Toyota isn't alone. Buick will continue to use its status
as the sole Big Three representative in the Power survey's
Top 10 to back up its slogan: "The new symbol for quality in
America." Says Darwin E. Clark, Buick's general marketing
manager: "It's a strategic advantage in the marketplace."</p>
<p>Buick should know. Last June, the LeSabre surprised the
auto industry by finishing second among individual models.
Sales of the somewhat boxy-looking sedan nearly doubled in
the next month as Buick trumpeted the LeSabre's status. Sales
of last year's top-ranked car, the Nissan Maxima, jumped 62%
last July in the wake of the Power study.</p>
<p>But Buick and Nissan are finding that the auto industry is
in a quality sprint. Buick actually cut the defect rate on
the LeSabre 8% this year to 82 problems per 100 cars,
according to the Power survey. That's fewer than one per
vehicle and would have earned it first place last year. But
the LeSabre lost ground because Toyota and Mercedes improved
scores on their models by as much as 34%. Maxima defects,
meanwhile, rose about 7%, dropping the model to No. 7.</p>
<p>Until this year, no car brand had averaged fewer than 100
problems per 100 cars. This year, four brands -- Lexus,
Mercedes-Benz, Toyota and Nissan Motor Corp.'s Infiniti
division -- broke that barrier.</p>
<p>The year-to-year improvement surprised even the study's
proprietor, J. David Power. Mr. Power, whose firm is based in
Agoura Hills, Calif., has been tracking automotive marketing
for more than two decades. "I thought they topped out last
year," he says. "It never ceases to surprise me."</p>
<p>Mr. Power's firm gets its information by asking consumers
who buy new cars early in the model year whether they
experienced any defects in the first three months of
ownership. The survey covers 12 categories, including engine
performance, rattles, leaks, finish, handling, and electrical
systems. For the 1990 survey, Power says it questioned some
26,100 people.</p>
<p>A brand need not place an individual model among the top
10 to achieve a high overall ranking. Honda Motor Co., for
example, ranked sixth overall. Its top individual models (the
CRX and Accord) finished 18th and 20th, respectively, but
Honda didn't have any lemons to drag down its brand average.</p>
<p>Power started with passenger cars, but now also has a
compact truck quality survey. The 1990 winner: Mazda, which
ranked No. 1 with its pickup and No. 2 with its MPV minivan.</p>
<p>J.D. Power isn't alone in using surveys and statistics to
amplify word-of-mouth quality information. Consumer Reports
magazine has done so for years, as have several firms that
work for auto makers. But Consumer Reports and most of the
other consulting services don't allow car makers to use their
findings in advertising. J.D. Power does.</p>
<p>That's why car makers pay so much attention to the Power
survey. Some Toyota plants in Japan actually put up banners
urging workers to strive for quality so the company could top
the J.D. Power list. Mr. Power says the response to his
quality survey "is beyond my greatest expectations. . . . We
have management's attention."</p>
<p>The survey isn't perfect. All defects count the same.
Thus, an engine that burns up at 10,000 miles is given the
same weight in the survey as a squeaky dashboard. What's
more, the poll doesn't reflect problems that arise after the
first 90 days.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, the survey has high credibility in the auto
industry, despite some surprising findings. It's predictable
that the top two models are a Lexus and a Mercedes-Benz, but
how did the Toyota Camry, a high-volume compact, rank No. 3?
The answer: Quality doesn't simply stem from price, or from
smart design and modern factories, auto industry officials
say. Sophisticated work-force management is a must.</p>
<p>"If you've got good people, put them in an environment
where quality is encouraged, and allow them to participate
{in factory management}, the result is this," says Alex
Warren, senior vice president at Toyota's Kentucky plant.
Toyota's methods sound simple: Workers are told "not to pass
on defects" to their "customer" -- the next worker on the
assembly line. Employees inspect their own work and can stop
the line if there's a problem.</p>
<p>Buick officials tell a similar story. Buick began
developing a "team approach" about a decade ago, Mr. Clark
says. Recently, that led a Buick employee to take a complaint
about a leaky LeSabre rear window straight to the engineers
and workers at the LeSabre factory. "They went to the robot
that applied the {window} sealer and within five minutes they
had it fixed," Mr. Clark says.</p>
<p>Buick's management is getting equally finicky. Earlier
this year, Buick delayed the launch of the 1990 Buick Regal
sedan because it didn't like the quality of the cars coming
out of the factory. Buick finally started selling the car
this month, but decided because of the delay to call it a
1991 model.</p>
<p>Mr. Power says this is how auto makers should react to the
survey. But his firm also has a business stake in the quality
survey's renown.</p>
<p>This year, Power is stepping up efforts to market the
quality survey's results. For the first time, the firm is
publishing the results in a single package. In the past, the
information was dribbled out in several issues of the firm's
newsletter.</p>
<p>Power also gives companies several ways to win: By being
tops among all brands, tops among all cars or trucks, or tops
in a specific market segment. The Chevrolet Lumina coupe is
the best "midsize specialty" car, though it had more defects
than the overall industry average.</p>
<p>The danger is that the Power stamp of approval will become
ubiquitous, and thus carry no weight. Mr. Power and his
underlings concede that they're concerned about this
possibility, but say they have taken steps to better control
the use of their name. For the most part, though, Power likes
its growing marketing clout.</p>
<p>The firm delayed the release of its latest survey until
yesterday to give car makers more time to build marketing
campaigns around the results. Power is ready to help them,
too. The company offers to make customized videos -- at $50
to $100 each -- that companies with vehicles in the Top 10
can distribute to dealers.</p>
<p>Power even does something for car makers that finish at
the back of the pack: It generally won't disclose the models
or makes that have more defects than the industry average.
Though concern about offending clients is a big factor, Power
officials prefer to say that accentuating the positive is a
better way to influence auto makers.</p>
<p>The survey "isn't done for consumers," Mr. Power says.
"It's done for manufacturers to help them improve."</p>
