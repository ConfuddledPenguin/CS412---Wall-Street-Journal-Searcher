	<p class="article-leader">Before the Budget Summiteers from the White House and
Congress get too far down the road to a national tax
increase, they might want to charter limousines up to New
Jersey to take the political pulse of a recently taxed
electorate. We realize that when Washington's politicians
start talking about raising taxes in the name of "responsible
government," it doesn't make too much difference what the
taxpayers themselves actually think. Still, someone in the
two national parties who still thinks voter sentiment counts
for something better check out the Garden State, which
appears ripe for the revival of a California-style tax
revolt.
   We'll set aside the purely partisan sentiments of the
thousands who jammed Trenton Sunday to demonstrate against an
imminent $2.8 billion package of sales and income-tax
increases. "Florio, Florio, you sold out," "Recall Florio,"
and "Flimflam Florio" refer to the New Jersey governor who
neighbor Mario Cuomo was boosting just last week for the
Democratic presidential nomination. More interesting than
this was the makeup of the crowd itself, which arrived in a
40-mile-long caravan of cars and trucks. A lot of them didn't
seem to be the "rich" who are supposed to be the target of
the Florio tax increases, but normal middle-class citizens.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>News reports quoted people identified as postal workers,
grade-school teachers, truck drivers, single working women,
carpenters, owners of small businesses. "Finally, the middle
class is saying enough," a carpenter's wife told the Newark
Star-Ledger. An angry postal worker complained to the
Associated Press, "They make promises and they don't keep
them."</p>
<p>An organization named Hands Across New Jersey seems to
have taken shape. A first-grade teacher who said, "I have
never done anything like this before," now says: "We want to
tell the politicians we're not taking it anymore. Whenever
government loses touch with its people, something is wrong."</p>
<p>Meanwhile in Washington, news reports say that the budget
summit is proceeding in a much more relaxed atmosphere now
that the Democrats have been liberated from the dreadful
curse of presidential opposition to new taxes. Maybe they
shouldn't relax too much. One New Jerseyan showed up at the
rally driving his tractor-trailer with a long banner tied to
the side, saying: "Read Our Lips."</p>
<p>Whatever he says now, George Bush may have created the
bumper sticker for a middle-class political movement that is
taking on a life of its own.</p>
