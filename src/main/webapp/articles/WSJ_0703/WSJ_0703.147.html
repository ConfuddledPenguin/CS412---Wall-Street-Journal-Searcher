	<p class="article-leader">Portland General Electric Co. said the staff of the Oregon
Public Utility Commission recommended increasing the Portland
General Corp. unit's 1991 revenue by $6 million, sharply less
than the $89 million increase the Portland, Ore., company had
requested.
   In March, the utility filed a request for the 11.4%
increase in estimated 1991 revenue and a return on equity of
13.5%. The electricity price increase proposal will be
negotiated during the next several weeks, and public hearings
are scheduled to begin Sept. 5.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>A spokesman for Portland General Electric, which serves
570,000 customers, said the company has requested a final
order to be issued in time for it to implement the new rate
structure on Jan. 1.</p>
