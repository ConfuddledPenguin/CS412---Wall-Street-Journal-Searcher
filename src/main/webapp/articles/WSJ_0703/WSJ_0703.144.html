	<p class="article-leader">RESEARCH TRIANGLE PARK, N.C. -- Glaxo Inc. said it filed
for approval to market its migraine treatment sumatriptan in
the U.S.
   The U.S. unit of Glaxo Holdings PLC said its application
to the Food and Drug Administration included safety and
efficacy data on its injectable form of sumatriptan. It said
its oral-form application for FDA approval is expected to be
filed later this year.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>A Glaxo spokeswoman said the filing means its FDA-review
process is "on schedule." As previously reported, Glaxo
Holdings said it hoped for British clearance this month but
said the FDA may not clear the drug until 1993.</p>
<p>In its data, the U.S. unit said, were the results of
testing of more than 3,000 patients in North America and
Europe. According to Dr. Charles A. Sanders, chief executive
officer of Glaxo, patients "reported rapid relief, with over
80% reporting little or no headache following treatment."
Glaxo said it believes sumatriptan acts on migraine and
cluster headaches by selectively constricting cranial blood
vessels that become enlarged during a migraine attack.</p>
<p>Glaxo said about 10% to 12% of the world's population
suffers from migraines, with women more prone to them. It
said men are more prone to cluster headaches, which are like
migraines but occur in separate, shorter durations.</p>
<p>Migraines are a complex, incurable disorder producing
severe headaches and nausea. Current medications often don't
work well or cause ill effects, limiting their global market.
Analysts have said sumatriptan could be big earner for Glaxo,
much like its ulcer medicine Zantac.</p>
