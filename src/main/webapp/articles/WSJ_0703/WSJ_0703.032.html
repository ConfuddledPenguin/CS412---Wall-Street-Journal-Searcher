	<p class="article-leader">ATLANTA -- Coca-Cola Co., in moves that turn the spotlight
on executive succession, named a rising star to perhaps its
toughest job, while deciding to keep its president at the
helm a while longer.
   Coke named M. Douglas Ivester to the high-profile post of
president of Coca-Cola USA, in charge of all domestic
soft-drink operations, fueling speculation that Mr. Ivester
is the front-runner to eventually become president of the
parent company.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Since Mr. Ivester joined Coca-Cola as assistant controller
in 1979, his career has rocketed. Just last year, the
soft-spoken 43-year-old executive landed the plum assignment
as president of Coke's burgeoning European operation. It is
widely believed that Mr. Ivester, who is well regarded by
Coke's top executives, was given that pivotal job, as well as
his latest assignment, to give him the front-line operating
experience he will need to leap into senior management.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Coca-Cola yesterday said that 63-year-old
Donald R. Keough, Coke's ebullient president and chief
operating officer, wouldn't retire in 1991 at 65, as is
customary. Rather, Mr. Keough, whose business acumen is
praised industrywide (even by senior executives at rival
PepsiCo Inc.), will continue in his current roles until the
fall of 1993, Coke said.</p>
<p>That decision, according to industry executives reading
the tea leaves, would buy Mr. Ivester -- or any other
contenders -- more time to develop executive potential. Mr.
Ivester wasn't available to be interviewed, and a Coke
spokesman wouldn't comment on the speculation. None of the
moves affect Chairman Roberto C. Goizueta, 58.</p>
<p>Shortly after Mr. Ivester joined Coke, original plans
called for him to work his way up to become Coke's chief
financial officer by this year. But those plans were quickly
scrapped in 1981, when the company's chief financial officer
died of a heart attack. By 1985, Mr. Ivester was already
chief financial officer.</p>
<p>A numbers man who spent a decade with accounting firm
Ernst & Whinney before joining Coke, Mr. Ivester impressed
his superiors at the soft-drink company as an extraordinarily
quick study. In the course of a decade, he developed creative
approaches to financing -- including sophisticated hedging
strategies for foreign currencies -- helped restructure
Coke's bottling operations and fine-tuned Coke's European
business in anticipation of the unified market in 1992.</p>
<p>"On paper right now, Doug Ivester has to be given the
most-valuable-player award at Coke," said Jesse Meyers,
publisher of Beverage Digest, a trade newsletter.</p>
<p>While acknowledging that Mr. Ivester has nabbed
front-runner status, Mr. Meyers and other industry experts
said the race is anything but over. In the past, Coke has
been known to appoint people considered long shots to top
jobs. "Ivester got the tentative anointment, but there are
other knights at the round table," said Mr. Meyers. Other
names frequently mentioned are John Hunter, 52, president of
Coke's Pacific Group, and E. Neville Isdell, 47, president of
the Northeast Europe-Africa Group.</p>
<p>Mr. Ivester succeeds Ira C. Herbert, known as Coke's
"Keeper of the Trademark" for his detailed oversight of the
company's image. At 62, Mr. Herbert will continue to oversee
Coke USA, however, through the position he keeps as as
president of Coke's North American Business Sector, which
includes the U.S. and Canadian businesses.</p>
<p>Mr. Herbert is expected to keep a close watch. The USA
division, the centerpiece of Coke's world-wide operations,
recently appointed an outsider, Theodore Host, as its senior
marketing executive. And Mr. Ivester, himself, is untested in
operating the U.S. business. Industry executives, therefore,
don't expect to see any wrenching departure from past
marketing practices. Mr. Herbert "will be the guiding hand,"
said one former Coke official.</p>
<p>In addition, Mr. Herbert now will oversee Coca-Cola's
foods division, which makes Minute Maid orange juice. The
division, which has struggled against strong competition, had
reported to Mr. Keough. Harry E. Teasley Jr. will continue as
president of the foods company. Mr. Herbert ran the foods
business in the late 1970s.</p>
<p>Coke also announced that Mr. Hunter, president of the
Pacific Group, will get added responsibilities as deputy to
John W. Georgas, 62, president of Coke's international
business. That appointment suggested to some industry
observers that Mr. Hunter will eventually succeed Mr. Georgas
as head of the overseas operations, which account for about
80% of Coca-Cola's profits.</p>
<p>Ralph H. Cooper, 50-year-old president of Coke's Northwest
European Division, will succeed Mr. Ivester as president of
the European Community Group.</p>
<p>The appointments take effect Aug. 1.</p>
