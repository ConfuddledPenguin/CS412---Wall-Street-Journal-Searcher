	<p class="article-leader">Once again, Uncle Sam is trying to tell companies how to
design retirement benefits that aren't slanted in favor of
the bosses.
   Job hoppers, mid-level executives and the young probably
are going to take it on the chin. Lower-level employees close
to retirement are apt to come out ahead. And executives at
the very top could well emerge unscathed.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>That's the opinion of benefit consultants who have pored
over the 300-plus pages of proposed retirement-plan
regulations recently issued by the Internal Revenue Service.</p>
<p>The rules are designed to carry out a policy goal first
enunciated by Congress almost 50 years ago and rewritten by
the Tax Reform Act of 1986: Tax-favored retirement plans must
not discriminate in favor of highly compensated employees.
For 1990, that means those earning more than $85,485 a year,
or $56,990 if they are in the top 20% of a company's earners.</p>
<p>The IRS has been working on the rules for three years.
Benefit experts say many companies should have little trouble
complying with the proposed new regulations. Most other firms
will get by with what Donald E. Sullivan, a vice president
and director of consultant Towers Perrin, terms "tinkering."</p>
<p>Such tinkering almost certainly will mean somewhat richer
pensions for older, lower-paid employees who are close to
putting in for their gold watch.</p>
<p>On the other hand, at companies aiming to hold overall
retirement costs where they are now, these boosts at the
bottom could be funded by somewhat smaller packages for
employees with bigger pay checks and those who switch jobs.
The highest paid certainly will be hit; the 1986 act puts a
limit, $209,200 for 1990, on the earnings that can be used in
computing tax-favored retirement benefits.</p>
<p>Still, employers anxious to attract and retain top
executives could move some of these lost retirement benefits
out of the qualified plans covered by the new IRS rules into
so-called nonqualified plans that, in most cases, are riskier
unfunded corporate IOUs.</p>
<p>But there is a Catch 22 that could hit mid-level
executives. Another piece of federal legislation, the
Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, or Erisa,
dictates that only the highest-ranked managers may be offered
unfunded retirement plans, Mr. Sullivan says. All other
employees must have pensions secured by squirreled-away
securities or cash. So, while top bosses could get back
through unfunded plans whatever the new rules cost them,
mid-level managers and professionals will have to content
themselves with only the tax-qualified plans that the
proposed regulations are likely to tilt in favor of the rank
and file.</p>
<p>Just who gains and who gets hit and how much depends on
how companies rewrite their retirement-plan formulas to
conform to the new rules and on how aggressively they push
Erisa definitions to broaden the coverage of unfunded plans,
says Ethan E. Kra, a managing director of William M. Mercer
Inc., a benefits consulting firm.</p>
<p>For companies aiming to maintain their current retirement
costs, he says, the list of potential losers could include
anyone earning something more than $50,000 a year (a likely
break point between those apt to get richer benefits under
the new rules and those likely to be cut) but less than
$85,000 a year (the lowest salary level to which even
aggressive employers are likely to extend unfunded retirement
plans).</p>
<p>At many companies, the losers could stretch to those
earning as much as $120,000 a year. And even the
highest-ranked managers could be forced to bear some of the
cost at corporations that decide now is not the time for
rampant executive greed.</p>
<p>Substantial tax benefits are offered to companies that
play by the new rules, known generally as the proposed
401(a)(4) regulations (though far more provisions of the
Internal Revenue Code are actually involved). A company in
compliance can take a deduction on its income tax return for
the money it pays into a qualified retirement plan. The
plan's earnings aren't taxed, and workers aren't subject to
any tax until they start receiving the benefits when they
retire or otherwise leave.</p>
<p>The nonqualified plans that Erisa allows for top managers,
by contrast, would be taxable to workers immediately if any
benefits were vested and fully secured in a trustee's hands.
But companies generally help their executives duck the tax
liability until they leave by offering cashless promises that
aren't backed by any secured trust.</p>
<p>The proposed 401(a)(4) rules and the other accompanying
new regulations, which are scheduled to become fully
effective next year but must be used as guidelines now, offer
companies seven "safe harbors" that the IRS says would "let
most pension plans comply with little or no difficulty."</p>
<p>Most defined-contribution plans, where companies add a
specific amount or percentage of pay or profits to a worker's
account each year, would fit into one of the safe harbors.
Also fitting this class would be 401(k) savings plans with
matching employer contributions.</p>
<p>More problematic are defined-benefit plans, particularly
those tied to Social Security benefits, that promise
employees a specific payment when they retire based on their
wages and years of service. At most major employers,
defined-benefit plans are the principal retirement vehicles.</p>
<p>The problem arises because the IRS has denied a safe
harbor for plans that promise workers a company-paid benefit
minus a portion of what they will receive from Social
Security, the approach adopted by many firms.</p>
<p>Thomas C. Butterworth, a partner at consultant Hewitt
Associates, says companies generally believe this offset for
Social Security is fair because "they contribute to Social
Security and want credit for it."</p>
<p>Social Security offset still is permitted, but companies
first will have to undertake some elaborate tests to confirm
that the nondiscrimination goal is met.</p>
<p>Companies with defined-benefit plans looking for a safe
harbor have two other basic formulas for ensuring they aren't
discriminating in favor of highly compensated employees.</p>
<p>According to James G. Durfee, a Towers Perrin vice
president, one formula allows an employer to promise a
pension based on pay minus a percentage of the average wage
base used in assessing Social Security taxes, all multiplied
by years of service. The second permitted formula adds a
percentage of the Social Security wage base to a percentage
of pay in excess of Social Security wages, also multiplied by
years of service.</p>
<p>Frederick W. Rumack, director of tax and legal services
for Buck Consultants, says switching from the old formula to
either of the newer ones could hit job switchers hardest
because the old pension tables generally permitted more
generous payments to early retirees and job hoppers than the
new rules would allow.</p>
<p>Similarly, increases in the Social Security wage base over
the years could hurt younger workers, says Solomon A.
Weinberger, a Mercer managing director.</p>
<p>Bottom-ranked workers could gain if companies establish
minimum pension payments to conform to the new
nondiscrimination rules or round up annuities for low-paid
workers.</p>
<p>But before settling who gets what, companies will have to
decide how big a retirement load they want to carry and
whether it is to be more than, less than or the same as they
are spending now. And that will determine how much retirees
will see in future pension checks.</p>
