	<p class="article-leader">Westwood One Inc. said its net loss in the second quarter
ended May 31 narrowed 42% to $3.8 million, or 26 cents a
share, from $6.6 million, or 45 cents a share, a year
earlier.
   Revenue increased 27% to $37.4 million from $29.5 million.
Operating profit was $1.7 million compared with an operating
loss of $3.2 million a year earlier.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>In a statement, William Battison, president and chief
financial officer, attributed the narrowed losses to added
productivity in "turnaround properties" acquired in the past
three years. He said the progress occurred despite increased
interest expense and good will amortization as a result of
these acquisitions.</p>
<p>Westwood One, based in Culver City, Calif., produces and
distributes radio programming that owns and operates the
Mutual Broadcasting System and NBC Radio Networks and owns or
has interests in several radio stations.</p>
