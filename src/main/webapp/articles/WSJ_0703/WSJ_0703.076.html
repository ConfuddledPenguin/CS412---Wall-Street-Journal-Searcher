	<p class="article-leader">TORRANCE, Calif. -- P. Leiner Nutritional Products Corp.
said it expects to report that net income fell
"substantially" in the fiscal first quarter ended Saturday. A
year earlier the nutritional products concern reported net
income of $929,000, or 18 cents a share.
   Revenue declined about 15% to about $27 million from $32.2
million a year earlier. Leiner attributed the decline to the
recall of L-tryptophan amino acid products, overall softness
in vitamin sales, and a delay in introduction of new products
and programs. The company previously said it expected lower
first-half results, and believes that sales should improve
during the second half of fiscal 1990.</p>
