	<p class="article-leader">MADISON, N.J. -- Schering-Plough Corp. said it completed
the sale of its Maybelline cosmetics business for $300
million to Maybelline Holdings Inc., a newly created
affiliate of Wasserstein Perella Partners L.P.
   The Wasserstein group agreed to the cash purchase a month
ago, after a similar accord with another group collapsed. The
first group was led by Playtex Family Products Corp. and
Playtex and Maybelline management. Schering put the unit up
for sale in December, saying it wanted to concentrate on
pharmaceuticals.</p>
