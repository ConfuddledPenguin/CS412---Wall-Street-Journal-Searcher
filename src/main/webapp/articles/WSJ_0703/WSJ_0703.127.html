	<p class="article-leader">Fluor Corp., Irvine, Calif., said it sold its iron ore
processing unit to St. Louis-based Big River Minerals Corp.
for about $12 million, resulting in a one-time after-tax gain
of less than 10 cents a share for the third quarter ending
July 31.
   Pea Ridge Iron Ore Co. had been carried on Fluor's books
as a discontinued operation since a 1987 reorganization when
Fluor began entertaining offers to buy it. Fluor in recent
years has sold off natural resources investments in gold,
zinc, oil and copper, and is entertaining inquiries about its
lead investments. Last March, Fluor said it had retained an
investment banking firm to explore options for its Massey
coal-producing unit.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The company, which earned $68 million or 40 cents a share,
in the second quarter ended April 30, is focusing on its core
business of engineering, construction and technical services.</p>
<p>Pea Ridge operates an iron ore mine and pelletizing plant
with about 250 employees near Sullivan, Mo. Big River is a
closely held investment company formed in 1988 by executives
of former Fluor unit St. Joe's Minerals Corp., including
former Fluor President John Wright. Big River produces coal,
zinc, precious metals and iron ore.</p>
