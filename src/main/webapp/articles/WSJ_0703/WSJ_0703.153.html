	<p class="article-leader">SIMSBURY, Conn. -- Kollmorgen Corp. said it agreed to buy
hostile suitor Vernitron Corp.'s stake and to settle all
litigation related to a proxy fight and failed merger accord.
   The settlement concludes Vernitron's effort to take over
Kollmorgen, which began about 18 months ago. The two
companies signed a standstill agreement prohibiting each of
them from buying the other's securities, participating in
proxy contests involving either company, or otherwise seeking
to control or influence the management of either company for
10 years.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Kollmorgen, a maker of motors and electro-optical systems,
purchased Vernitron's remaining 424,600 shares in Kollmorgen
for $12.125 a share, or about $5.2 million. Vernitron at one
point held 593,000 shares, or about 5.5% of the Kollmorgen
common. It bought the shares at an average cost of $14.04 a
share; average net proceeds of the sales were $11.76 a share,
a Vernitron spokesman said.</p>
<p>In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange
yesterday, Kollmorgen shares closed at $12, down 25 cents.</p>
<p>In addition, Kollmorgen paid Vernitron $2 million related
to litigation and other disputes. Vernitron, a Deer Park,
N.Y., closely held maker of motors and controls, had total
expenses of about $20 million on the takeover fight,
including the loss on the stock position, the Vernitron
spokesman said.</p>
<p>The companies said in a joint statement that the
settlement, which was "in the best interests of shareholders
and other constituencies" of both companies, would avoid the
expense and burden of litigation.</p>
<p>Vernitron had sought to take control of Kollmorgen through
a proxy fight this year.</p>
