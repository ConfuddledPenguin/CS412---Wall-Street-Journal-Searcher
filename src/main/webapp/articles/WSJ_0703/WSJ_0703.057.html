	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Food and Drug Administration will
require over-the-counter aspirin products to carry stricter
warnings advising women in the last three months of pregnancy
against using the products unless directed by a physician.
   The agency said the stronger warning on labels is being
required because aspirin can affect fetal circulation and
uterine contraction, which can harm the baby and cause
problems during delivery.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Aspirin products now carry a general warning that says:
"As with any drug, if you are pregnant or nursing a baby,
seek the advice of a health professional before using this
product."</p>
<p>Manufacturers have one year to add the stronger warning to
all oral and rectal over-the-counter products containing
aspirin, the FDA said.</p>
<p>The warning reads: "It is especially important not to use
aspirin during the last three months of pregnancy unless
specifically directed to do so by a doctor because it may
cause problems in the newborn child or complications during
delivery."</p>
<p>An advisory panel of medical experts had recommended the
stronger warning. A similar, third-trimester pregnancy
warning is already required on nonprescription products with
the pain-reliever ibuprofen.</p>
