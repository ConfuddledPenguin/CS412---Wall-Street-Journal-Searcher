	<p class="article-leader">OSLO -- A Norwegian oil workers' union said it resolved to
accept a government back-to-work order yesterday but did not
exclude the possibility of wildcat strikes on offshore
platforms.
   The central committee of the Norwegian Federation of Oil
Workers advised 4,000 striking workers to return to work
because compulsory arbitration ordered by the government
earlier yesterday is legally binding, said deputy leader
Oddleiv Tonnessen.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The union had considered defying the government order,
claiming it violates international trade union agreements.</p>
<p>A union official, speaking unofficially, said unsanctioned
wildcat strikes might break out at some offshore fields.</p>
<p>The 6,000 member union began shutting Norway's North Sea
production of 1.63 million barrels a day of oil and 63
billion cubic feet a month of natural gas at midnight
Saturday. Last-minute negotiations had failed to settle a new
contract.</p>
