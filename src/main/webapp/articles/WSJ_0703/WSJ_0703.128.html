	<p class="article-leader">SAN FRANCISCO -- International Rectifier Corp. said a
federal bankruptcy court in San Francisco didn't approve an
agreement with Siliconix Inc. that would have settled
patent-infringement litigation between the two companies.
   "The court feels it is premature to consider the agreement
separately from Siliconix's reorganization plan," said a
spokeswoman for El Segundo, Calif.-based International
Rectifier, which supplies power semiconductors and other
products.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Siliconix, Santa Clara, Calif., filed for bankruptcy-law
protection in April after a federal court held valid all five
of International Rectifier's patents on power-transistor
technology. Under terms of the settlement, Siliconix would
pay International Rectifier $12 million over a two-year
period and would acquire a royalty-bearing license under the
litigated patents.</p>
<p>A target date of July 15 has been set for filing the
reorganization plan with the court, said a Siliconix
spokesman. International Rectifier said it is evaluating the
effect of the bankruptcy-court decision.</p>
