	<p class="article-leader">LONDON -- Sales of new cars in Europe in May rose 3.8%
from a year earlier and 1.8% from April, but analysts said
the performance doesn't alter their view of underlying
sluggishness or their forecasts for continuing flat sales
this year.
   The April sales were down 4.3% from a year earlier. The
data are from industries and governments in the 12 countries
that normally account for 94% of noncommunist Europe's
passenger car sales.</p>
