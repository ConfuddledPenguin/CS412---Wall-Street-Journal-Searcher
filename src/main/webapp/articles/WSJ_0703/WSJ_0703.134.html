	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Bond prices were little changed in mostly
torpid trading as investors began their monthly ritual of
waiting for the employment report.
   For bond investors, the Department of Labor's monthly
report has become the most anxiously awaited of all
government economic indicators. It has the ability to sway
sentiment and move the markets, which explains why some
investors shy away from the market in the days before its
release. The June employment report will be released on
Friday.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The approaching July Fourth holiday, which falls in the
middle of the week, also kept many investors away.</p>
<p>"We're really playing with a half-staff on Wall Street,"
said Brian J. Fabbri, chief economist and managing director
at Midland Montagu Securities Inc. "The first half of the
week will be treated as if it is an extended holiday." He
said that traders, investors and investment advisers will
likely return on Friday, in time for the release of the June
employment report.</p>
<p>In the municipal market, traders kept close watch on bonds
issued by the city of Philadelphia. On Friday, Moody's
Investors Service Inc. downgraded about $1.35 billion of the
city's outstanding general obligation bonds to Ba from Baa,
citing a burgeoning budget deficit and continued
uncertainties surrounding the development of recurring
funding sources.</p>
<p>Bonds rated below Baa are considered junk bonds and
Philadelphia is now the only major U.S. city whose general
obligation bonds are rated in that category. However, several
city's have been rated non-investment grade in the past,
including New York, Cleveland and Detroit.</p>
<p>There wasn't a general consensus about how the
Philadelphia bonds moved. Traders at Butcher & Singer Inc.
said that some Philadelphia bonds fell between two and four
points, which amounts to losses of between $20 and $40 for
bonds with a $1,000 face amount. However, other traders said
the bonds were just slightly lower.</p>
<p>But all dealers said that trading activity was very slow
yesterday with only a handful of firms putting out lists for
the bid. When bids were taken on $150,000 of Philadelphia's
8.25% bond due 2009, investors sought yields of 8.20% and
higher. Those bonds were yielding about 8% on Friday. Bids
also were taken for $500,000 of Philadelphia's 8.10% of bonds
due 2000.</p>
<p>Trading activity in Philadelphia bonds could pick up
substantially in the weeks ahead as news of the downgrading
spreads. Although few analysts believe that Philadelphia will
default on its obligations, many institutional investors are
prohibited from holding fixed-income securities that are not
rated investment-grade.</p>
<p>Some traders see a silver lining in the clouds overhanging
the bonds, arguing that the response could have been much
worse Monday.</p>
<p>Market participants were "kind of prepared" for the
Moody's action, said W.M. Norris Jordan Jr., a trader at
Janney Montgomery Scott Inc. in Philadelphia.</p>
<p>Treasury Securities</p>
<p>Treasury bonds were little changed from Friday. The
benchmark 30-year bond was quoted late at a price of 103
23/32 to yield 8.40%, unchanged from Friday.</p>
<p>Trading in the Treasury market was actually brisk early
yesterday morning as prices declined in response to a weaker
dollar on foreign exchange markets, rising commodity prices
and news that the National Association of Purchasing
Management's index of business conditions rose to 51.1% in
June from 50.7% in May. The rise suggests that manufacturing
activity picked up slightly.</p>
<p>Short-term rates were lower when compared with last week
at the government's weekly auction of Treasury bills. The
government sold $17.6 billion of bills yesterday with an
average discount rate of 7.73% for three-month bills and
7.60% for six-month bills.</p>
<p>The rates were down from last week's auction when they
were 7.78% and 7.67%, respectively.</p>
<p>Here are details of yesterday's bill auction:</p>
<p>Rates are determined by the difference between the
purchase price and face value. Thus, higher bidding narrows
the investor's return while lower bidding widens it. The
percentage rates are calculated on a 360-day year, while the
coupon equivalent yield is based on a 365-day year.</p>
<p>                             13-Week          26-Week</p>
<p>Applications ........... $35,303,705,000  $25,258,875,000</p>

</p>

<p>Average price (Rate) ...  98.046 (7.73%)   96.158 (7.60%)</p>
<p>High price (Rate) ......  98.049 (7.72%)   96.168 (7.58%)</p>

<p>Coupon equivalent ......           7.99%            8.01%</p>
<p>Both issues are dated July 5, 1990. The 13-week bills
mature Oct. 4, 1990, and the 26-week bills mature Jan. 3,
1991.</p>
<p>Corporate, Junk Bonds</p>
<p>The junk bonds of Kay Jewelers Inc. rocketed higher on
news that the jewelry chain received a friendly takeover bid
from Ratners Group PLC, a major jewelry retailer in Britain.</p>
<p>In the proposed takeover, 12.4 million of outstanding Kay
Jeweler stock will be exchanged for new Ratners perferred
stock valued at $17 a share. The proposed acquisition is
contingent upon the ability of Ratners to purchase a majority
of Kay's junk bonds. Ratners said it will try to purchase
those bonds in the open market as well as launch a tender
offer for the bonds at 75% of face value.</p>
<p>Prices of some Kay junk bonds jumped 15 points, or about
$150 for bonds with a $1,000 face amount. Kay's senior notes
were quoted late in the day at a bid price of 75, although
some were being offered at 90. The wide spread between bid
and offer is a sign that some investors expect Ratners to
sweeten its offer for the bonds.</p>
<p>Frederick H. Taylor, high-yield analyst at Salomon
Brothers Inc., doubts that a price of 75 will appeal to
bondholders.</p>
<p>That price, he said, "seems inadequate in light of the
total value of the company and particularly in light of how
the equity is being valued. I expect bondholders to hold out
for a higher value."</p>
<p>In other trading, most corporate bonds, both junk and
investment grade, ended little changed.</p>
<p>Foreign Bonds</p>
<p>The value of the U.S. dollar declined sharply on foreign
exchange markets, boosting foreign currencies and sparking a
rally in most foreign bond markets.</p>
<p>On the first trading day after West and East German
monetary unification, the West German bond market was
surprisingly quiet.</p>
<p>Bond dealers attributed the market's somber tone to
anxiety about the first ever German Unity Fund bond offering,
scheduled to take place tomorrow. The proceeds from the issue
will be invested in East Germany. Market talk is that the
bonds will mature in 10 years and carry a coupon rate of
between 8.75% and 8.875%. The size of the bond offering is
expected to be between five billion or six billion marks
($3.01 billion to $3.61 billion).</p>
<p>In trading, West Germany's 8.75% bond due 2000 rose 0.22
point to a price of 100.50 to yield 8.67%.</p>
<p>Prices of Japanese government bonds finished firmer as the
yen rose sharply against the dollar. In Tokyo, the dollar
ended at 151.43 yen, down from 152.20 yen late Friday in New
York and from 152.88 yen in Tokyo on Friday.</p>
<p>As the value of the yen rose, Japanese government bonds
followed. At the 3 p.m. close of the Tokyo Stock Exchange,
the price of Japan's benchmark 4.8% 10-year bond was 86.43,
up 0.18 point, to yield 7.31%. In over-the-counter trades
after the Tokyo Stock Exchange closed, the yield traded as
low as 7.275%.</p>
<p>(Foreign government yields are quoted here in local terms
and therefore differ somewhat from yields calculated for
these markets by U.S. investment banks, which tend to use the
semiannual compound measure to compare yields across
markets.)</p>
<p>But British government bonds, called gilts, ended weaker
due to disappointing economic news. The British government
revised its growth estimate for May retail sales to 1.4% from
1.2%, suggesting that consumer demand was a bit stronger than
previously reported.</p>
<p>Municipal Bonds</p>
<p>In the absence of market-moving news, Philadelphia's
general obligation bonds were a focus of the sleepy municipal
bond market.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, actively traded municipal bonds closed flat to
1/4 point higher.</p>
<p>The New Jersey Turnpike Authority's 7.20% securities of
2018 finished 1/4 stronger at 98 3/4, yielding 7.30%. On
Friday, the bonds yielded 7.32%.</p>
<p>Mortgage-Backed Securities</p>
<p>Taking their cue from the stagnant U.S. Treasury market,
mortgage securities prices were unchanged to a shade firmer.</p>
<p>The primary market also was quiet, with one issue priced
-- a $350 million issue of Federal National Mortgage
Association real estate mortgage investment conduit
securities offered by First Boston Corp.</p>
<p>The offering is backed by new stripped mortgage securities
formed from Fannie Mae 9% 30-year mortgage-backed securities.
Stripped securities are formed by separating principal and
interest portions of a security, and then selling them
separately to investors.</p>
<p>Government National Mortgage Association 9.5% securities
for July delivery were 1/32 firmer on the day at 99 17/32;
Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp. 9.5% issues were up 1/32 at
98 27/32 and Fannie Mae 9.5% securities were also up 1/32 at
99 11/32.</p>
<p>In the 10% coupon issues, the Ginnie Maes were up 1/32 at
101 27/32, the Freddie Macs and Fannie Maes were unchanged at
100 25/32 and 101 9/32, respectively.</p>
