	<p class="article-leader">London -- Of all the world's great sporting events, the
championships at Wimbledon (the lawn tennis championships,
that is) surely are the most sedate. In a Day-Glo era,
"predominately white" apparel is prescribed for the players,
and gray pinstripes still are favored by males in the
All-England club's member-seating sections. The balls
cooperate, emitting only a discreet "pock" when striking the
greensward.
   Cutbacks in courtside standing areas here, an incongruous
offshoot of anti-football-hooligan legislation, has not only
slimmed the crowds but quieted them below their usual,
low-decibel levels. The man from the London Times, commenting
on the "subdued gentility" of the first week's proceedings,
concluded that "Wimbledon misses its promenaders."</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Happily, however, one aspect of the tournament remains
unsedatable. I speak of the ubiquitous throngs of teen-agers
who station themselves in front of the players' locker rooms.
Though well-behaved by international teen-age standards, they
nonetheless stand ready to react characteristically when
their favorites emerge to do battle.</p>
<p>Thus it was at about 3 p.m. yesterday, when Gabriela
Sabatini of Argentina sallied forth to meet France's Nathalie
Tauziat in an outer-court, fourth-round singles match. The
dark-eyed, long-limbed Sabatini might be down a notch in the
rankings of late, and at just-turned-20 a smidge elderly for
an activity whose recent headliners have been teens. But
she's still near the top of the Wimbledon squeal-o-meter.</p>
<p>"Gaby] Look over here]" said a young female, pointing her
camera in Sabatini's general direction. "She's so cool]" she
further shrieked.</p>
<p>Sabatini endured the attention with downcast eyes,
hurrying along in the company of gray-uniformed security
guards. The fan attention, she said in a previous interview,
is "nice, because it shows that the people like me." But, she
added, "I don't like it when they get very close."</p>
<p>Tennis observers have said that, perhaps, the reticent
Sabatini gets similiarly nervous when the uppermost reach of
her sport beckons, as it did last year. She denies this, but
allows that her "confidence" isn't always what she'd like it
to be. If winning can bolster that, this tourney should be a
tonic. She beat Tauziat, 6-2, 7-6, to move into the
quarterfinals, her best showing here in three years.</p>
<p>The women's tennis people dearly hope that Gaby is on an
upslope again, because while teen whizzes such as Monica
Seles (third-ranked at 16) and Jennifer Capriati (No. 13 at
14) have given their form a needed boost, there's no
substitute for glamour, and Sabatini has that in abundance. I
mean, sneaker endorsements are nice, but what other tennis
player has a perfume named for her? And what other player's
used match towels have fetched 10 pounds ($17), as hers did
for enterprising ball boys here a couple years back?</p>
<p>Time was that Gaby seemed ready to challenge for No. 1,
or, at least, No. 1 1/2. In the spring of 1989, she defeated
Chris Evert and top-ranked Steffi Graf in finals of
back-to-back tournaments in Florida, and a month later beat
Arantxa Sanchez to win the prestigious Italian Open.</p>
<p>Alas, that was to be her year's high point, and she'd win
just one more tourney. Included in her losses was a tough
three-setter, to Graf, in the U.S. Open semis, one Sabatini
recalls with particular regret.</p>
<p>Her 1990 began with an ankle injury that forced her to
withdraw from the Australian Open. She came back to win her
next outing, the Virginia Slims of Florida, but that has been
her only winner's check this year. Meantime Seles, the
grunting young Yugoslav, not only won, at Paris, the Grand
Slam glory that has eluded Sabatini, but passed her for No. 3
in the ratings, behind Graf and old-pro Martina Navratilova.
And Capriati, a very hard-hitting young lady, threatens from
behind, though she was a straight-sets loser to Graf on
Monday.</p>
<p>Sabatini says she applauds the advent of the terrific
teens because "they're good for the game," but does so a bit
wistfully. "When you're that young, you have no pressure,"
says she. "You can just hit your shots, and not worry. When
you get older, it's different. People want you to do more
things."</p>
<p>A tennis tourist since she left her native Buenos Aires at
13, she recalls, "I never even had to think about what I
wanted to do besides play. I never had to make a decision."</p>
<p>She has made a few decisions of late, reflecting her May
16 graduation from the teens. She fired Angel Gimenez, her
coach of 3 1/2 years, in favor of Brazilian Carlos Kirmayr,
saying she was in need of a change and new motivation. Long
seen only in the company of her parents, with whom she
travels, she fraternizes with fellow players more now, and
has been seen out with Fredrick Untermayer, a young German,
although she laughs that he's "a friend, not a boyfriend."</p>
<p>She has signed on a psychologist, Ted Loehr, who has told
her "that if I feel good as a person my tennis will go
better." She notes: "I do feel good, but I guess you can
always feel better."</p>
<p>Perhaps more to the tennis point, she has been working on
her serve and volley, which are about as important on
Wimbledon's slick grass as rackets and tennis balls, and says
she's seen improvement. And, indeed, against Tauziat she at
times came to the net voluntarily, something she was loath to
do in the past when her topspin forehand was her best -- and
sometimes lone -- offensive weapon.</p>
<p>She struggled against the smaller, 17th-ranked
Frenchwoman. Her service was broken three times in the second
set, and she muffed two match points at 6-5 before losing the
game and forcing the tiebreaker, which she won, 7-1.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, she was grateful in victory, something she
says she's also learned. "It's not good to worry too much
about the wins," she notes. "I try to save the worry for when
I need it."</p>
