	<p class="article-leader">PALO ALTO, Calif. -- Collagen Corp. said Bristol-Myers
Squibb Co. terminated a two-year partnership to jointly
develop a cell growth regulator used to treat skin disorders,
rheumatoid arthritis and cancer.
   The agreement, as originally written, was to be terminated
at the end of June; Bristol-Myers had an option to renew the
contract but chose not to, said Jim McKinley, Collagen's vice
president and chief financial officer. "We were surprised,"
said Mr. McKinley.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Collagen said it retains all proprietary rights to the
substance, called transforming growth factor beta-type 2, or
TGFb2. The company said it began testing the naturally
occurring peptide in humans at the University of Michigan
last January, after obtaining FDA approval. Mr. McKinley said
the companies are still working together on a bone graft
substitute called collagraft.</p>
<p>Collagen also said its board approved a plan to split the
company's Celtrix Laboratory into a new public entity.</p>
<p>Company officials said it was splitting off its laboratory
division to provide Collagen a more focused emphasis on
medical devices developed for use in plastic and oral
surgery, dermatology, urology, orthopedics and oncology. Dr.
Bruce Pharriss, Collagen's senior vice president of science
and technology, will become the chairman and chief executive
officer of the newly created subsidiary.</p>
<p>Collagen closed yesterday at $21.125, down $1 on trading
of 192,900 shares in national over-the-counter trading.</p>
