	<p class="article-leader">"Continental Lands in Managua," blared the 24-point
headline. We did a double-take. The reactivation of a new
Contra force? No, just the most hopeful sign yet that perhaps
things really are getting better in Central America. It was a
Continental Airlines' newspaper ad inaugurating a direct
flight to Managua from Houston. "We make getting down to
business in Nicaragua easy, and reliable," the ad explained.
We'd say that's exactly what the voters had in mind when they
voted the Sandinistas out of office last February.</p>
