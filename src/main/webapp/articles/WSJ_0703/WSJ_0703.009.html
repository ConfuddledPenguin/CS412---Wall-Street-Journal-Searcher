	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- The Bush administration isn't saying so
publicly, but it is looking for ways to trim the federal
insurance on deposits in banks and savings and loan
associations.
   One Treasury official privately predicts that the
department will recommend rolling back the official insurance
ceiling from $100,000 to perhaps $50,000. Says another
administration aide: "We have to find a way to limit the
costs to the taxpayer."</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>In a switch from the past, Congress, chastened by the cost
of the savings-and-loan disaster, is receptive to some type
of deposit-insurance revision, though not necessarily along
the lines Treasury plans to propose by year end. "Nobody
wants to even remotely believe we would have to face this
again," says Sen. Alan Dixon, an Illinois Democrat who sits
on the Senate Banking Committee.</p>
<p>Overhauling the system of "insuring," or guaranteeing,
deposits could be the most important aftershock of the $150
billion savings-and-loan bailout. It would be likely to
reshape U.S. financial institutions, most notably by causing
some big depositors to lose money and endangering many of the
country's 12,000 small banks and thrifts. But some say major
reforms are the last, best hope to prevent another S&L-type
blowout.</p>
<p>"I don't think the problems in the S&Ls are attributable
to anything other than deposit insurance," says Peter
Wallison, a banking lawyer who served as the top attorney at
the Treasury and the White House during the Reagan years.
Although that ignores the widespread fraud and the Reagan
administration's policy of deregulation without adequate
supervision, it's true that the problem would have been far
smaller without insurance on big deposits. And many agree
with Mr. Wallison's conclusion that "if we don't fix the
system, it will fail again in the banking industry."</p>
<p>Yet even tinkering with deposit insurance remains
politically explosive, and reforming it is far from a sure
thing.</p>
<p>The issue splits the banking industry bitterly. Two of the
three most important banking trade groups favor exposing
corporate or wealthy individual depositors to a loss in bank
failures. But the third, representing small banks, is
dead-set against it. Small banks fear that they will lose
many depositors and be crippled if deposit insurance is
slashed, so they are proposing instead that the government
openly insure all deposits, no matter how large. In
preparation for the looming confrontation, rival banking
lobbyists already are working Capitol Hill door-to-door.</p>
<p>"The battle for the soul of the Treasury is on," says
Kenneth Guenther, who runs the small-bank group, the
Independent Bankers Association of America.</p>
<p>The Treasury Department is contemplating turning around a
train that has been roaring in the same direction since 1934.
Congress responded to the failure in the early 1930s of more
than a third of the nation's 25,000 banks by protecting
$2,500 per account. Partly to adjust for inflation, Congress
gradually jacked up that amount, with the biggest increase,
from $40,000 to $100,000, in 1980. The program now covers
everyone from children to savvy investors who scour the
nation for the highest rates on "jumbo" deposits.</p>
<p>In the 1980s, $100,000 deposits flew like needles to a
magnet to get the highest yields, and thus many of them ended
up in the riskiest, most fraudulent S&Ls in the country.
Thrift executives drew giant salaries from the
taxpayer-backed deposits. Then they rolled the dice and
invested the rest in thousands upon thousands of crazy
real-estate projects, junk bonds, luxury-car dealerships and
expensive artwork. If the investments paid off, they made
more money. But the dice often came up snake eyes. And now
all the losing propositions are in the hands of those who
really paid for it -- the taxpayers.</p>
<p>By attracting deposits with above-market rates and a
government guarantee backing them up, "Thrifts were
essentially printing money through deposit insurance," says
William Seidman, chairman of both the Federal Deposit
Insurance Corp. and the new agency running the S&L cleanup,
the Resolution Trust Corp. Richard Breeden, a key architect
of the cleanup and now chairman of the Securities and
Exchange Commission, agrees: "The institutions that grew
2,000% or 3,000% weren't getting those funds because
investors thought they were well-run businesses. Deposit
insurance made those funds available."</p>
<p>Yet there's more to the Alice-in-Wonderland quality of
deposit insurance. Most important, the $100,000 insurance
ceiling is really an apparition. Since the then-ailing
Continental Illinois National Bank & Trust Co. was rescued in
1984 on the theory that its collapse might severely damage
the financial system and perhaps the whole economy, the
government -- under a policy dubbed "too-big-to-fail" -- has
covered almost all deposits by arranging sales of broke
banks. And, out of fairness to smaller banks, "too big to
fail" has been extended to protect virtually all depositors
from losing money. (In most cases, the only depositors cut
off at $100,000 are those in small banks that the government
can't sell and liquidates instead.)</p>
<p>The upshot: Deposit insurance is like an auto-insurance
fund where 16-year-old drunks and Sunday drivers pay the same
premium and everybody gets fully paid off in an accident.
Some are asking why anyone other than accident-prone people
should favor that.</p>
<p>Treasury's Tradeoff</p>
<p>Treasury officials don't. So they are preparing a package
that would rework deposit insurance and expand the businesses
that banks can enter. Treasury is also considering a call for
further dropping the barriers to interstate banking, aiming
to give the banking system more stability by spreading risk.
Although the outcome of their deliberations could be
influenced by political pressure, their basic thinking seems
set. "An industry that can't make profits is doomed to
operate in an unsafe and unsound condition," reasons a top
official overseeing the study.</p>
<p>He and other Treasury officials worry that big U.S. banks
could become shaky if they fall behind in competition with
foreign banks, many of which enjoy broad powers not permitted
U.S. banks, such as selling insurance, underwriting
securities and forging close links with commercial
businesses. "Diversifying the activities of banks can
decrease risk," he says.</p>
<p>Many banking experts agree, but the trouble is that this
smacks of financial deregulation, which rattles Congress
these days. Anticipating such fears, Treasury will probably
propose stringent rules to ensure that the deposit-insurance
safety net isn't stretched to include the new business
activities. So-called firewalls, for example, would prevent
insured money from being used in the areas to be opened to
banks.</p>
<p>In sum, Treasury is likely to propose to Congress a quid
pro quo: Prevent a future bailout by giving big banks broader
powers while cutting deposit insurance.</p>
<p>Conspicuously absent from that equation are small banks --
possibly the fatal flaw in the Treasury's approach. Big banks
wield huge financial clout, but small banks, with offices in
every congressional district, carry more political weight on
Capitol Hill. To thousands of small banks and thrifts across
the country, the Treasury proposal will look like a tradeoff
without a payoff. They are uninterested in getting new
powers. And they fear that a cutback in deposit insurance
would send their depositors running to big banks viewed as
"too big to fail" and thus 100%-insured, no matter what the
government says.</p>
<p>A `Haircut' for Depositors</p>
<p>So the banking industry has cooked up a compromise: Impose
a little "depositor discipline." The American Bankers
Association, which represents both big and small banks,
proposes shaving off a percentage -- say, 10% -- on
reimbursements beyond the first $100,000, which would be
fully covered. A person with $200,000 in a failed bank, for
example, would recover $190,000. The size of the haircut
would increase as bank failures increased.</p>
<p>The haircut idea appeals to a Congress fearful of
antagonizing politically potent bankers but eager to limit
the government's liability. "I feel too many people have been
made whole," says Sen. Jake Garn of Utah, the ranking
Republican on the Banking Committee.</p>
<p>The sticking point here is that small bankers simply don't
believe that regulators would force depositors in a big bank
to actually take a loss. They want Congress to make the
"haircut" mandatory. "That is kind of a linchpin," says
William Brandon, president of a small bank in Helena, Ark.,
and a member of the ABA committee on deposit insurance.</p>
<p>Small banks are right to be skeptical. Because of the
damage a big-bank failure might do, says Federal Reserve
Board Governor John LaWare, "I don't know how you can
altogether get rid of `too-big-to-fail.'"</p>
<p>Insuring Everything</p>
<p>If you liked the S&L mess, you'll love the small banks'
response to it. They want the government to insure
everything.</p>
<p>Actually, the idea isn't as crazy as it may seem. All it
would do is formally extend the too-big-to-fail doctrine to
all banks and thrifts. The Independent Bankers Association of
America, the small-bank group, is canvassing Capitol Hill for
full coverage, and although legislators aren't exactly lining
up to support the idea, some are sympathetic. "I think the
radical tinkering should be on the regulatory side," says
Rep. Jim Leach, an Iowa Republican. "Modest tinkering should
be considered for deposit insurance."</p>
<p>If Uncle Sam is on the hook for every dollar on deposit,
how can he prevent another bailout? Big banks fear that under
100% insurance, the public will start treating banks like
utilities. And, in fact, those who propose covering all
depositors suggest a slew of accompanying regulations.</p>
<p>Most important of such regulatory moves, the Fed's Mr.
LaWare says, "is effective supervision and effective
capitalization. That's better than cleaning up the mess after
the bank has failed."</p>
<p>Mr. LaWare and other regulators argue that as long as
banks maintain adequate capital -- the bank owners'
investment, which in a crisis is drained off before federal
deposit insurance is tapped -- major revisions in the
insurance may be unnecessary. The S&Ls, they assert, wouldn't
have risked those wild investments if the government hadn't
let them operate with little or no capital. Without much
investment at risk, thrift owners had every incentive to
gamble for high stakes. The regulators add that although
depositors now are being paid off in full, shareholders and
bondholders lose their investment, and they demand prudence
from bank managers.</p>
<p>But critics of that view say regulations can be peeled
back. If the thrift mess teaches us anything, they argue, it
is that bank and thrift owners will always press the
government to ease up, imperiling the deposit-insurance fund.
"The worst ones will squawk the most," contends Bert Ely, a
financial consultant. "That's the way the political process
works." In fact, even as the thrift bailout metastasized in
recent months, banks burdened with real-estate problems asked
regulators for forbearance on capital requirements, to
stretch out the period in which the banks have to recognize
real-estate losses. So far, regulators have rebuffed those
requests.</p>
<p>Wary of the entire deposit-insurance thicket, some in
Congress are looking for ways to tiptoe around it. Limiting
depositors to one insured account apiece is a popular idea on
the Hill, but no one has yet come up with a workable way to
do that.</p>
<p>Another idea is to link the premiums banks pay to the
riskiness of their assets. If a bank's managers took unusual
risks, the thinking goes, premiums would rise to the point
where its stock price and dividend would fall, and
shareholders would apply pressure to lower the risk.</p>
<p>But some question whether insurers can properly judge the
risk in a bank's portfolio. A decade ago, for example, many
experts were positive that the oil boom had nowhere to go but
up; but, of course, oil prices collapsed, taking down a lot
of Texas banks.</p>
<p>Even so, the idea is probably the least controversial
floating around Congress. Hoping to prod the Treasury to
think seriously about risk-based premiums, Sen. Dixon soon
will introduce a plan to require the FDIC to go to a private
insurer to back up a small slice of its liabilities. The
private insurer, with its own money at risk and presumably
immune to pressure from Congress, would look over the FDIC's
shoulder in setting premiums.</p>
<p>The wild card in the deposit-insurance debate is the
public, which really hasn't been heard from yet. Congress
could quickly lose its fervor for reform if depositors howled
about reduced coverage.</p>
<p>"As depositors, the public has been treated handsomely,"
says Carter Golembe, chairman of the Secura Group, a bank
consulting firm. "The government made a promise to
depositors, and it kept the promise. The question is: Is the
public more angry as taxpayers than it is happy as
depositors?"</p>
