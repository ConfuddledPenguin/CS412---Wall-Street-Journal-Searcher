	<h3>Politics & Policy: RTC Alters System for Real Estate Bids After Protests Over Random Selections</h3>

	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- When the savings-and-loan bailout agency set
out in the spring to award lucrative contracts to manage $2.6
billion in Houston real estate, it spun its wheel of fortune.
   Resolution Trust Corp. officials used a computer's random
number selector to narrow 3,000 eligible bidders down to 60.
The contracts, which are valued at millions of dollars, to
manage the real estate portfolio of University Savings of
Houston haven't been awarded yet.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Since then, howls of protest from real estate managers
have persuaded the agency to remove some -- but not all -- of
the element of chance from its bidding system. "We are
complaining about irrational bidding," says David
Fensterheim, a Washington attorney who represents a large
group of well-heeled thrift-asset managers, including NCNB
National Bank, Charlotte, N.C.; Chemical Banking Corp. of New
York; and Mellon Bank Corp., Pittsburgh, and a subsidiary of
New York financier Ronald Perelman's thrift, First Gibraltar
Corp., Dallas.</p>
<p>Under a new bidding system, the RTC is set to award 42
contracts to manage $7.4 billion in assets over the next two
weeks. The asset-management contracts are for "work-out
specialists," who will take control of properties of failed
S&Ls, fix them up and sell them, or manage difficult loan
portfolios.</p>
<p>Industry protests also spurred the agency to widen bid
solicitations for a nationwide computer system to track the
RTC's vast real estate holdings. Initially, just 30 firms
were invited to bid. "The word hit the street immediately,"
says Thomas Horton, in charge of the RTC contracting, "and we
had complaints everywhere." This past Wednesday, the agency
sent out solicitations to 204 firms.</p>
<p>The RTC, operating under procurement rules spelled out in
last year's S&L bailout law, can't just select the cheapest
bidder or the most experienced bidder. The agency must
include women and minority contractors and take pains to
allow every interested bidder at least a theoretical shot of
landing the work. The RTC had to hire, for example, an
American Indian consultant in North Dakota to help deal with
certain land in the Northwest. The agency must also screen
out individuals who have contributed to past S&L losses.</p>
<p>"It's obviously a contrived system," says Mr. Horton. "We
have to be fair and open, or we are accused of steering these
to inside favorites."</p>
<p>Under its new system, the RTC will send letters describing
particular contracts to every eligible bidder on its list of
potential contractors. Those who respond that they have
interest and experience will be put into a pool. From this
pool, 30 are selected to bid on each contract, with women and
minority contractors included, plus a mix of first-time and
experienced bidders. The final contract is awarded on price
and technical quality.</p>
<p>"It's a dramatic improvement from the previous approach,"
says Mr. Fensterheim. "But that doesn't mean they should give
up trying to get the best people, and eliminate the
irrationality."</p>
<p>So far, 7,313 contractors are on the RTC's list of
potential contractors, claiming expertise in one area or
another. The huge number, the RTC says, slows the bidding
process, because too few are actually experienced at
foreclosing on complex, and often fraud-ridden real estate
loans.</p>
<p>"Everybody and his brother is out there calling himself an
asset manager," says Lamar Kelly, director of the RTC's
division of asset and real estate management. "Frankly, we
are looking very hard at these start-up firms to see if they
have demonstrated experience in handling these problems."</p>
<p>This week, the agency will also begin awarding huge
contracts to manage the bulk of the RTC's residential real
estate. The agency will solicit bids to manage and sell
thousands of repossessed homes in San Antonio, Houston and
Dallas. The contracts will be worth millions over time, Mr.
Horton says.</p>
<p>On Friday, the RTC selected Lowe Enterprises, a Los
Angeles company, to manage one of the agency's largest single
real estate assets, the Banning-Lewis Ranch, Colorado
Springs, Colo., a $250 million property stretching across 13
miles. The contract is for $39,500 a month, and a sales price
percentage that declines over time.</p>
