	<p class="article-leader">A federal bankruptcy judge gave LTV Corp. another 120 days
to formulate a plan for repaying its creditors and emerging
from Chapter 11 bankruptcy reorganization.
   The Dallas company, which is approaching its four-year
anniversary under Chapter 11 protection, had sought the new
deadline for its reorganization plan prior to the U.S.
Supreme Court's ruling that the company is liable for funding
more than $2 billion in employee pension plans.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>LTV now has until Nov. 6 to present a reorganization plan
to U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Burton R. Lifland of New York. The
company had been scheduled to present its plan early next
week.</p>
<p>None of the parties to LTV's reorganization objected to
the extension.</p>
<p>The Supreme Court ruled June 18 that LTV couldn't pass its
liability for funding the pension plans to the federal
Pension Benefit Guaranty Corp., meaning that LTV's creditors
are likely to receive much smaller payouts under a
reorganization plan. The company, which filed for bankruptcy
protection in July 1986, stopped funding the pension plans in
1987.</p>
