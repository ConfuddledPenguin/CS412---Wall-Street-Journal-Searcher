	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- The Department of Health and Human Services
said that Medicare benefits have been expanded to help pay
for pap smears.
   Congress approved the new benefits last year in an effort
to reduce the death rate from cervical cancer in women over
65 years old. Effective Sunday, Medicare benefits cover one
pap smear every three years for most women, and more
frequently for women with a high risk of cervical cancer.
Forthcoming regulations will define the high-risk group.
Medicare pays 80% of approved charges.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The cure rate for cervical cancer, which is treated with
surgery and radiation, is relatively good if the disease is
found early. Over the last 15 years, the incidence of
invasive cervical cancer has fallen about 4% a year among
women 65 and older, primarily because of increased use of pap
smears.</p>
<p>But a study by the congressional Office of Technology
Assessment earlier this year found room for improvement. Only
about half the women over 65 had a pap smear within the last
three years, and at least 25% of all elderly women had never
had a pap smear. The American Cancer Society estimates that
among women 65 and older, there will be 3,700 new cases of
invasive cervical cancer this year and 2,500 deaths.</p>
<p>The government expects about 4.1 million claims for the
new benefit in 1991, the first full year of coverage, at a
cost of about $30 million.</p>
