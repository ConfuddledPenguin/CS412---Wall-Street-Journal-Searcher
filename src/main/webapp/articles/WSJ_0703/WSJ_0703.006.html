	<p class="article-leader">Do you know someone with unquestionable ethics, who's
financially savvy, a good record-keeper and sensitive to
others' emotional needs?
   Quick, get that person to agree to be executor of your
estate.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>After you've spent a lifetime accumulating your fortune
through hard work and careful investing, the executor is the
one who is supposed to make sure assets are distributed in
the way that you specify in your will.</p>
<p>But the qualifications of the executor you choose can make
a big difference in how much is distributed, to whom and how
fast. And it can affect family relationships for years to
come.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, many people simply name their spouse or
oldest child and forget about it. "The biggest mistake
{people make} is that they don't give it enough thought,"
said David W. Belin, a Des Moines, Iowa, estate lawyer.</p>
<p>The job is a lot more work than many people realize. An
executor is charged with assembling and valuing the
descendant's assets, filing income-tax and estate and
inheritance-tax returns and paying the taxes, distributing
assets to heirs and accounting for everything that's done.
There may be numerous meetings with attorneys and
accountants.</p>
<p>There's also a strong emotional component. The executor
has to deal with grieving family members soon after a death;
the relationship could continue for as long as two or three
years. Personal items, such as jewelry and household effects,
have to be distributed. There may be conflicts among family
members to resolve, particularly if there's a second spouse
or if assets aren't divided equally among several children.</p>
<p>It's the financial aspects of the job, however, that are
usually the most important, estate-planning professionals
agree. "It's very much of a fiduciary responsibility," said
Timothy Chase, a financial planner with Baltimore accountants
Walpert, Smullian & Blumenthal.</p>
<p>While the estate is open, the executor has to keep funds
invested. Some assets may need to be sold to pay taxes or for
other purposes, and the executor will have to decide which
ones and when. There may be a small business to be managed or
liquidated. It can be difficult to value stock in
family-owned or closely held companies.</p>
<p>Some estate specialists suggest turning over the job to a
bank trust department or other professional, especially for a
large, complicated estate with trusts and a business to
value. Richard Langer, an estate lawyer in Madison, Wis.,
said it doesn't necessarily cost more to use a pro because
executors' fees generally are set by state law.</p>
<p>Typically, executors' fees amount to between 2% and 5% of
the estate, although it's sometimes possible to negotiate
lower fees. Even children of the deceased often take the full
fee when they see the amount of work involved in settling an
estate, Mr. Langer said.</p>
<p>Naming a professional executor also takes the burden off
the family and removes the potential for conflict that can
arise when the executor is also one of the beneficiaries, he
added.</p>
<p>Other estate specialists say, however, that banks can be
impersonal and may not always have the time that some
families require. A solution may be co-executors, a bank
trust department and a family member. "That way you get the
expertise of a bank and the personal input of a family
member," said Tamara Telesko, a vice president in the U.S.
private banking group at New York's Chase Manhattan Bank.</p>
<p>If a significant portion of the estate is going into a
trust, financial advisers say, it may be helpful for the
executor and trustee to be the same individual or entity. The
trustee then knows that the necessary paperwork has been done
for the transfer of assets and already has a relationship
with the family or other beneficiaries.</p>
<p>But people who decide to name an executor who will also be
trustee should exercise great care, said Judy Walsh, national
director for executive financial planning at Deloitte &
Touche. "Look at their {money} management record," she
advised. "Then sit down with the trust officer and . . . see
how the chemistry works."</p>
<p>For smaller estates, a corporate executor may be
unnecessary, many financial advisers say. Indeed, bank trust
departments often won't take small estates. In such cases, a
family member or trusted friend may be a fine choice -- so
long as the individual has the qualifications and time for
the job. Certainly, if a spouse or adult child is sole
beneficiary of an estate, there's usually no reason to
deplete assets for executor fees, estate specialists say.</p>
<p>If the executor is "absolutely unqualified, doesn't know
anything about finance and has non-existent bookkeeping
skills," settling the estate "is a lot more work," said Mr.
Langer, the Wisconsin attorney. The result can be a longer
process and higher attorney's fees.</p>
<p>There are other things to watch out for. The executor can
be held personally liable if, for example, assets are
depleted without leaving sufficient amounts to pay taxes. If
the executor lives in another state, there's the cost of
travel and long-distance telephone calls to consider, and
some states require an out-of-state resident to be bonded or
otherwise insured.</p>
<p>Some grieving spouses may be overwhelmed by the
responsibility, while others find it therapeutic to be in
control. Giving one adult sibling control over others can
cause resentment, but professionals caution against naming
several children as co-executors unless there's a mechanism
for resolving disputes written into the will. "A lot depends
on the family situation," said Mr. Chase, the Baltimore
planner. "People have to know their families."</p>
<p>Worse than naming the wrong executor is naming no one at
all, said Judy Walsh of Deloitte & Touche. Most estates are
closed "within nine months to two years," she said. "You can
live with a toothache for that long." If there's no executor,
often because there's no will, she said, the courts will name
one, which is usually more costly and "may not satisfy the
family at all."</p>
