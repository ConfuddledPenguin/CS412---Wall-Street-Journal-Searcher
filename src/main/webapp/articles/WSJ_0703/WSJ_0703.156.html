	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- US Sprint Communications Co.'s international
unit and the Soviet Union's telecommunications authority have
formed a venture to provide data communications services in
the U.S.S.R.
   Ownership in the new company, Sprint Networks USSR, is
split evenly between Sprint and Central Telegraph of the
Soviet Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications. The venture
plans to begin operating a switching center by the fourth
quarter in Moscow to provide high-speed data communications
services, domestically and internationally.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The agreement would broaden European penetration by
Sprint, which has built many of Western Europe's public-data
networks and which has been trying to strengthen its presence
in overseas markets against the overwhelming dominance of
American Telephone & Telegraph Co. Moreover, many of Sprint's
potential corporate customers are U.S.-based companies that
are locating businesses in Moscow and are demanding more
data-communications services.</p>
<p>The joint venture still needs approval from the U.S.
Department of Commerce and the Paris-based Coordinating
Committee for Multilateral Export Controls (Cocom). While the
U.S. government has expressed a willingness to increase
exports of sophisticated telecommunications equipment to the
Soviet Union and Eastern Europe, it recently shot down a plan
by a consortium led by US West Inc., the Denver-based Bell
regional phone company, to build a giant fiber-optic
communications network linking the Soviet Union with Europe
and Asia.</p>
<p>Sprint, a unit of United Telecommunications Inc., filed
applications for licenses to export its technology last
March, when it announced it was holding discussions with the
Soviets. Susan Williams, Sprint's vice president of
international business development, said Sprint is confident
that its export requests will be approved.</p>
<p>"Our applications for export are going well, and we still
expect service to begin in the fourth quarter {of this
year}," she said. "Everything is ahead of schedule."</p>
<p>Sprint said the venture will link Soviet government
customers and the diplomatic corps in Moscow to the SprintNet
international data network, which ties databases and online
services in the U.S. and throughout the world. These
customers also will be able to get Sprint's Sprintmail
electronic mail service.</p>
<p>"The goal is to offer all data communications services to
residential customers in Moscow that our customers in
Cincinnati and Miami can get today," said Ms. Williams.
Eventually service will be extended to other parts of the
country as the Soviet Union upgrades its telephone
infrastructure. Overseas links will be provided via
satellite, she said.</p>
<p>A major portion of the agreement is potential future
orders for Sprint's Telenet data communications equipment.
Sprint added that installing Telenet transmission equipment
on customer sites in the country will end up "forming the
backbone of the Soviet Union's first data communications
network."</p>
<p>"The joint venture is a landmark in the development of the
U.S.S.R.'s data communications capability, joining our telex
systems with new technologies that will serve our country's
needs, and those of foreign interests based here, well into
the 21st century," said Viacheslav Rubtsov, general manager
of Central Telegraph.</p>
<p>The new company will be headed initially by Sprint
International's director of business planning and
development, Henry Radzikowski, while deputy managing
director will be Viktor Toor, who is currently the
second-ranked manager at Central Telegraph. The remaining
staff of 30 employees will be made up mostly of Soviet
nationals, said Ms. Williams.</p>
<p>In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday,
United Telecommunications stock closed at $40, up 37.5 cents.</p>
