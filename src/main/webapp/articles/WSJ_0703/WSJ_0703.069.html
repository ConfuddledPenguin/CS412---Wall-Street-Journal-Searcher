	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- A first-half earnings slump at Saks Fifth
Avenue may signal bad news for an Arab-led investment group
that completed its $1.6 billion purchase of the retailer
yesterday.
   The earnings news is disclosed in "Project Windows," a
confidential bank-financing memorandum drafted by Saks's new
owners, Investcorp International Inc. Investcorp acquired
Saks from B.A.T Industries PLC of Britain. About half the
purchase price was provided by Investcorp; banks lent the
rest.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The bank memo also provides a detailed look at
Investcorp's five-year strategy for Saks, one of America's
most prestigious department stores. According to the memo,
Investcorp plans to slash capital spending more than 50%,
opening just one new store from 1991 to 1995. Investcorp is
counting on tax breaks, job cutbacks and other
belt-tightening measures to help boost profitability.</p>
<p>Currently, Saks isn't performing as well as Investcorp had
expected. The bank memo shows that Saks's trading profit --
or net income plus interest expense, taxes and amortization
-- totaled $26.4 million for 1990's first half. That's 17%
below the levels that Saks management had predicted last
spring, and 20% below the level that Investcorp had forecast
when it bid for Saks.</p>
<p>Saks's profit will have to pick up fast if Project Windows
is to have much chance of succeeding. Investcorp is telling
bankers that it expects Saks to post a $73.5 million trading
profit for 1990's second half, and $147 million in trading
profit for all 1991. If that 1991 estimate is met, it would
represent a more than 50% leap in trading profit from 1990's
expected level, after five years of stagnant earnings at the
company. Last year, trading profit amounted to $110.5
million.</p>
<p>Bankers say Saks should get a boost from an expansion of
its flagship New York store that is coming on stream this
year, as well as a relocation this year of its Chicago store
to larger quarters.</p>
<p>After this year's growth, though, Investcorp has budgeted
for only minimal expansion. Capital spending is expected to
decline to $23 million in 1995 from a peak of $97 million
this year. Investcorp predicts that Saks will have 49 stores
open at the end of 1995, just one more than it currently
operates.</p>
<p>Investcorp does identify several ways it thinks it can
improve Saks's profitability. "We have reached the conclusion
that the company's non-store staff can be reduced
significantly," Investcorp says in its bank memo. It outlines
plans for cutting 270 people from Saks's headquarters staff
of 1,154.</p>
<p>Those cutbacks had drawn protests from top Saks managers
when they first were reported by The Wall Street Journal in
May. At that time, Investcorp had said the cutbacks were only
a possible option.</p>
<p>Robert Glaser, a member of Investcorp's management
committee, said yesterday that Saks managers will report back
by September on what job cuts they think are appropriate.
"Logic will prevail," Mr. Glaser said. "We aren't going to
tell them what they must do."</p>
<p>The tone of the bank memo, however, suggests that
Investcorp doesn't expect to give much ground.</p>
<p>Investcorp also is telling bankers that it expects its
fastest growth to come from Saks's catalog business, Folio,
and from its Texas stores. Nationwide, Investcorp said it
thinks it can improve Saks's profitability by using a "more
optimal mix of full-time and part-time sales help."</p>
<p>For the financial community, Investcorp's acquisition of
Saks already has paid off handsomely. The bank memo discloses
that the purchase price includes $115.6 million of
"transaction expenses." That's the term generally used to
refer to bank fees, lawyers' fees and any fee claimed by
Investcorp itself.</p>
<p>Aside from Saks's operations, Investcorp is counting on
some sizable tax breaks to help make its acquisition pay off.
Saks's new owners are increasing the book value of Saks's
assets more than $700 million, which will allow the company
to take a much bigger depreciation deduction from its tax
bill. The write-ups include $365.4 million for Saks's fixed
assets, $80 million for its inventory and $200 million for
its trade name.</p>
<p>Although such write-ups are a standard acquisition
maneuver, Investcorp in its bank memo is unusually blunt
about the consequences. "This will result in Saks paying only
minimal income taxes for the foreseeable future," Investcorp
told bankers.</p>
