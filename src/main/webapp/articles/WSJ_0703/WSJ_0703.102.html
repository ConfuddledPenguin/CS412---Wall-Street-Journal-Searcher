	<p class="article-leader">Smith Corona Corp. said it expects to post a "small loss"
for the fourth quarter ended June 30 and that officials will
recommend a dividend cut.
   G. Lee Thompson, chairman and chief executive officer,
said management will recommend that the quarterly dividend be
reduced to about five cents a share after a scheduled
15-cent-a-share dividend is paid Friday.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The New Canaan, Conn., maker of portable electronic
typewriters and personal word processors said the expected
loss reflects "charges relating to inventory write-downs and
nonrecurring provisions for major overhead expense reduction
programs."</p>
<p>Smith Corona, which went public at $21 a share a year ago,
has been reeling from a series of adverse developments,
including a 51% decline in fiscal third quarter net income.
The stock fell 87.5 cents yesterday to $5.375 in composite
trading on the New York Stock Exchange. Hanson PLC of Britain
holds 47.9% of Smith Corona.</p>
<p>In the year's first nine months, the company had net
income of $34.4 million, or $1.14 a share.</p>
