	<p class="article-leader">First Florida Banks Inc. said it signed a new merger pact
with Mid-State Federal Savings Bank that reduces the purchase
price for Mid-State to $48 million from up to $59.7 million
under an earlier pact.
   Tampa, Fla.-based First Florida said an examination of
Mid-State by federal regulators showed Mid-State has
inadequate loan-loss reserves -- a discovery that was adverse
enough to permit First Florida to void the earlier merger
pact.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Terms of the new agreement call for shareholders of Ocala,
Fla.-based Mid-State to receive $22.43 a share; the earlier
agreement called for its holders to get $25.07 a share and up
to an additional $2.34 a share contingent on Mid-State's
disposal of certain assets.</p>
<p>First Florida said the shortfall in Mid-State's reserves
surfaced when the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency
concluded Mid-State should have reserves of $8 million to $9
million instead of $1.3 million.</p>
<p>A special meeting of Mid-State shareholders to vote on the
new pact is expected to be held in September or October.</p>
