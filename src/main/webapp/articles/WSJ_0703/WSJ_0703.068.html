	<p class="article-leader">A libel suit involving a letter to the editor of a
scientific journal has emerged as a test case of whether New
York state, home to many of the nation's media companies,
will make statements of opinion immune from defamation suits.
   The state's highest court dismissed a libel suit filed by
Immuno AG concerning the letter to the editor. But the U.S.
Supreme Court threw out the decision last week and ordered
the state court to reconsider the case in light of its recent
ruling in Milkovich vs. Lorain Journal Co.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>In Milkovich, the Supreme Court ruled that under the First
Amendment of the U.S. Constitution there is no special
immunity from libel suits based on expressions of opinion.
But that doesn't prevent individual states' courts from
deciding that their own state constitutions implicitly offer
such immunity.</p>
<p>Courts in 36 states and the District of Columbia had ruled
that statements of opinion can't form the basis of libel
lawsuits, but in many instances it was unclear whether such
rulings were based on federal or state constitutional law.
The U.S. Supreme Court ruling will now force many of those
courts to explicitly determine whether or not state
constitutions afford such protection.</p>
<p>The current case arose from a letter published in the
December 1983 issue of the Journal of Medical Primatology
that criticized a plan by Immuno to set up a facility in
Sierra Leone to breed chimpanzees to use for the testing of
medical products. The letter was written by Shirley McGreal,
head of the International Primate Protection League, an
organization concerned with the welfare of primates. Immuno,
a multinational concern based in Vienna that manufactures
products derived from blood plasma, alleged that the letter
was false and defamatory. The only remaining defendant in the
case is Jan Moor-Jankowski, co-founder and editor of the
publication.</p>
<p>The stakes in the Immuno case are particularly high
because so many media companies are based in New York. In
addition, media defense lawyers said the New York court is
influential in libel law and its decision could affect how
other states resolve the issue.</p>
<p>Robert G. Sugarman of Weil, Gotshal & Manges, an attorney
for Dr. Moor-Jankowski, said he believes the New York
Constitution does provide protection from libel suits based
on opinions. He said he will ask the court to reaffirm its
earlier ruling as it previously determined that the facts
that formed the basis for the opinions in the letter were
true.</p>
<p>But Raymond S. Fersko of Tanner Propp Fersko & Sterner, an
attorney for Immuno, disagreed. He said: "I don't think
there's a basis for {stating} that what the framers of the
New York state Constitution had in mind was expanding First
Amendment protections in libel cases in a situation like
this."</p>

<p>TEENAGE MUTANT Ninja Turtles spawn court battle over
licensing.</p>
<p>A New York state court in Long Island will hear arguments
Thursday on whether to dismiss a $281 million lawsuit against
the licensing agent and creators of the Turtles, comic-book
characters who are the basis for an animated television
series and movie.</p>
<p>The characters have earned millions of dollars from
manufacturers that hold licensing agreements to put them on
everything from posters to frozen pizzas. They also appear as
action-figure toys and on T-shirts. The characters were
created by Peter Laird and Kevin Eastman, partners in Mirage
Studios, of Northampton, Mass. The licensing agent is Mark
Freedman, president of Surge Licensing Inc., Jericho, N.Y.</p>
<p>The suit was filed by Licensing Development Group Inc., a
New York company formed in 1987 to find products and license
them for manufacturing. It contends that Mr. Freedman
deceived it by secretly acquiring and exploiting the
licensing rights to the Turtles while he was serving as the
company's president and chief executive officer.</p>
<p>The suit alleges that Mr. Freedman should have been
seeking the licensing right on behalf of Licensing
Development Group, and that his actions breached his
fiduciary duty to the company. It also contends that Messrs.
Laird and Eastman induced him to violate his fiduciary
responsibilities. Playmate Toys Inc., a La Mirada, Calif.,
company that makes Ninja Turtle toys, also is named as a
defendant.</p>
<p>Jerome Halperin, a New York attorney for Mr. Freedman,
said he has asked the court to dismiss the suit. "It has no
merit either in law or fact," he said. "It's a worthless
lawsuit."</p>
<p>Frederick U. Fierst, an attorney in Northampton for
Messrs. Laird and Eastman, said the allegations are totally
without foundation. Richard Sallis, a senior vice president
of Playmate Toys, said he had never heard of LDG and didn't
know anything about the lawsuit.</p>

<p>SUIT AGAINST TRUMP over hiring of construction workers
goes to trial.</p>
<p>A class-action lawsuit on behalf of construction workers
went to trial in federal court in Manhattan. The suit alleges
that Donald Trump and others conspired to cheat the union's
pension and welfare funds by hiring immigrants without work
papers off the books and under-reporting the number of
employees on the job. The workers were hired for demolition
work to make room for the construction of the Trump Tower in
1980.</p>
<p>Milton S. Gould, of Shea & Gould, an attorney for Mr.
Trump and Equitable Life Assurance Society, which was a
partner in the project, said Mr. Trump was sued only "because
they needed somebody with deep pockets."</p>
<p>"There will be no proof that {Mr. Trump or Equitable}
dictated, suggested, or even hinted at who should or should
not be listed on any reports" of workers at the job site, Mr.
Gould said in his opening statement. "There is no proof that
{they} committed any act which furthered a breach of trust"
involving the funds.</p>
<p>Mr. Gould said the labor agreement under which the
demolition work was being done was between a contractor and
the workers. He said Mr. Trump had nothing to do with that
agreement.</p>
<p>The lawsuit, filed in 1983, seeks damages of $1 million.
The nonjury trial is being heard by federal Judge Charles
Stewart.</p>

<p>BANKRUPTCY JUDGE reluctant to approve contempt charges
against Kuhn.</p>
<p>U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Prudence B. Abram, in New York, said
she was reluctant to hold Bowie Kuhn and his lawyers in
contempt for proceeding with a suit against former partners
of Mr. Kuhn's now-defunct law firm, Myerson & Kuhn. But the
judge said she was concerned that the firm's bankruptcy
proceeding "go forward with some degree of orderliness."</p>
<p>Myerson & Kuhn's bankruptcy lawyers asked Judge Abram to
hold Mr. Kuhn and his law firm in contempt for allegedly
violating a restraining order that prohibited Mr. Kuhn and
his lawyers from "commencing, continuing or prosecuting
litigation" against former partners of the now-defunct firm.
Mr. Kuhn's lawyers at Kelley Drye & Warren say that neither
they nor Mr. Kuhn have violated the order.</p>
<p>Marine Midland Bank had sued Mr. Kuhn, the former baseball
commissioner, seeking to recover about $3 million in debt
that he had personally guaranteed for the firm. Mr. Kuhn, in
turn, sued his former partners for their share of the debt.</p>
<p>In a hearing about the contempt motion, Judge Abram
appeared impatient with Mr. Kuhn's lawyers and said "it is
possible for some people to turn anything into a three-ring
circus." But she said her main concern was to ensure that all
the parties understood what actions were barred by her
restraining order. The judge said she would take the contempt
motion "under advisement."</p>
<p>Richard Cohen, who represents Myerson & Kuhn in the
bankruptcy proceeding, said in an affidavit filed last week
that Mr. Kuhn's action against the partners had cost Myerson
& Kuhn more than $10,000 in legal fees that he should now
reimburse.</p>

<p>HEAVYWEIGHT BOXING fight gets set for round one in court.</p>
<p>James "Buster" Douglas, the heavyweight boxing champ,
claims promoter Don King sided with Mr. Douglas's opponent,
Mike Tyson, in their title fight last February. Thus, Mr.
Douglas says, he can drop out of his contract with Mr. King
and claim at least $10 million in monetary damages to boot.</p>
<p>Mr. King, who has promotion contracts with both Mr.
Douglas and Mr. Tyson, denies any unfair dealings and seeks
at least $25 million in damages from Mr. Douglas for reneging
on their deal. The bout is set to begin today in federal
court in New York.</p>

<p>COUDERT BROTHERS expands into Thailand.</p>
<p>The New York law firm has formed an affiliation with
Chandler & Thong-Ek, an 18-lawyer firm in Bangkok. Chandler
lawyers will act as local counsel for Coudert clients on
matters requiring knowledge of Thai law, and Coudert lawyers
will assist the Thai law firm. With 370 lawyers, Coudert has
offices in Tokyo, Beijing, Shanghai, Hong Kong, Singapore and
Sidney.</p>
<p>James B. Sitrick, Coudert's chairman, says the law firm
decided to form the affiliation because the partners believe
Thailand is on the verge of a business boom.</p>
<p>He said the law firm represents American, Japanense,
French and German companies who do business in Thailand.</p>

<p>LEAVING MCDONALD'S: Donald P. Horwitz, executive
vice-president for law and secretary of McDonald's Corp., is

handle corporate and franchise matters at the 270-lawyer
firm, which has been McDonald's principal outside counsel for
20 years. Mr. Horwitz, who was the Oak Brook, Ill., concern's
chief legal officer for 18 years, will remain as a director
of McDonald's.</p>
