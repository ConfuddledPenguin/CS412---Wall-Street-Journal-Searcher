	<p class="article-leader">La Coruna, Spain -- We buried him darkly at dead of night,
   The sods with our bayonets turning . . .</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>I thought everyone knew this stirring poem about the
secret burial of Sir John Moore here in 1808 after a bitter
espisode of the Napoleonic wars.</p>
<p>But no. My well-educated friend had never heard of it. We
were driving toward this weatherbeaten port on the
northwestern coast of Spain, through the soft, stony hills of
Galicia, where the fields are small, and the vineyards too,
and a farmer may own no more than a cow or a couple of sheep.</p>
<p>It rains here more than in any other place on the
peninsula. The people are of Celtic origin and speak their
own Iberian language, Gallego or Galician, which is even
taught in schools and spoken on a special television channel.
Like other Celts, they have the bagpipe. Theirs is small,
with a characteristic remote, mournful sound.</p>
<p>Moore's body was later removed from its rude grave to a
serene Roman sarcophagus now standing in the middle of a
walled garden that overlooks the port at the foot of the
Ciudad Vieja. Inscribed on one side is the poem itself, which
was written by Charles Wolfe. On the other is a pronouncement
of the Duke of Wellington as to the matchless bravery of
Spanish soldiers. Moore's army and his Spanish allies had
been caught in the snowy mountain passes inland and all but
cut to pieces by the French cavalry.</p>
<p>The garden is shrouded by elms and plane trees, date palms
and spidery hibiscus. Over the wall and down past the
barracks and fortifications, the harbor sweeps toward a Roman
lighthouse. From here the Invincible Armada set sail for
England in 1588, the priests chanting Mass and the incense
billowing as the soldiers dropped to their knees on the
galleon decks.</p>
<p>La Coruna is a big fishing port thick with ocean-going
trawlers, which is why The Correo Gallego carries a headline,
otherwise odd in a local paper, about a dispute over
territorial waters off southwest Africa. Galicians (Gallegos)
are famous in Spain for being tough and crafty. Francisco
Franco was a Gallego, and so were many Spanish immigrants to
America in the past century.</p>
<p>Around the corner from the Ciudad Vieja, with its little
palaces and its twisted, Romanesque church, rise the
apartment houses of the modern town, shuttered in glass
miradors that are the passive solar answer to the fierce
climate of the Bay of Biscay. We take the coast road to turn
the corner of the continent, but soon it turns into a
potholed asphalt track threading along and around the black
highlands, shadowed by pine and eucalyptus. We went inland,
in order to head roundabout for Cape Finisterre (literally
land's end), the westernmost point of Europe.</p>
<p>We reached the coast again south of the cape itself and
navigated a gale-beaten country. Little patches of bright
grass bearded with golden broom lay below solemn,
druidic-looking rocks. From time to time on the other side of
the road arcs of brilliant white beach flowed along the
shallows of cobalt and aquamarine.</p>
<p>Mile after mile the car followed the banks of the "rias,"
as the surging inlets are called. Once or twice there was a
village with a bus stop, a car or two, and, at Muros, a town
market. Far out on the flats left by the tide, men and women
worked for clams with rakes and baskets.</p>
<p>Now mountains rose along the coast, as the cape swung into
view, with white specks of houses below a smooth pale peak,
pale green and lavender in the stormy sun, and black in the
storms themselves. There were no sailboats, no pleasure craft
in the harbors, no tennis courts dug into the hills, no golf
courses, no swimming pools, no beach umbrellas, and not a
summer hotel angled to catch, or shelter from, the Atlantic
winds.</p>
<p>Far inland, in the countryside near Santiago de
Compostela, there is plenty of building and bustle, reminding
the traveller of prosperous and "European" Spain.</p>
<p>And along the roads, in a constant if unrealized process
of improvement and enlargement, every fifth or sixth car, it
seems, carries a rooftop sign signifying that yet another
person is learning to drive.</p>
