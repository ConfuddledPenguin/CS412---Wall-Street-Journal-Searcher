	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- The Securities and Exchange Commission said
it filed a plan in federal court for investors to receive
more than $19 million in profits allegedly obtained by
Stephen Sui-Kuan Wang Jr. and Chwan Hong Lee through insider
trading.
   In a 1988 complaint, the SEC charged Messrs. Wang and Lee
with violating insider-trading laws by trading in securities
of at least 25 companies. The suit alleged that Mr. Wang
obtained the nonpublic information while employed as an
analyst at New York-based Morgan Stanley & Co., a unit of
Morgan Stanley Group Inc.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Under the terms of a settlement of insider-trading charges
with the two men, the SEC said it obtained full disgorgement
of their allegedly illegal trading profits of more than $19
million.</p>
<p>The SEC's proposed plan calls for the money to be
distributed to investors who sold securities in the companies
named in the insider-trading suit on the same day or days
that Messrs. Wang and Lee purchased the securities.</p>
<p>The settlement also called for Mr. Lee to pay a fine of
$1,503,977, plus $4,560,472 in taxes owed from his allegedly
illegal trading activity, the SEC said. The commission said
Mr. Lee is now a fugitive from an indictment relating to the
illegal activities alleged in the SEC suit.</p>
<p>Mr. Wang earlier plead guilty to three felony charges
involving securities trading related to his employment at
Morgan Stanley. He was sentenced to eight months in prison
and has completed his sentence, the agency said.</p>
