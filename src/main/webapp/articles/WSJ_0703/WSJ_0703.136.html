	<p class="article-leader">Maxtor Corp. said it completed the acquisition of the
assets of the troubled Longmont, Colo.-based MiniScribe Corp.
   The San Jose, Calif., company said it created a subsidiary
called Maxtor Colorado Corp. to absorb the MiniScribe assets.
Maxtor appointed Taroon Kamadar, who managed the concern's
assets during bankruptcy proceedings, to head the company.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The company said the acquisition, announced in April, will
"provide us with the ability to serve the entire range of
markets, from laptops to personal computers to workstations
to mainframes." The accord makes Maxtor the world's
third-largest maker of data storage products, the company
said.</p>
<p>MiniScribe filed for protection from creditors under
Chapter 11 of the federal Bankruptcy Code in January after
alleging financial improprieties by its management.</p>
