	<p class="article-leader">Tate & Lyle PLC, a British sugar company, said it will not
proceed to bid for Berisford International PLC, a British
food, property and jewelry concern.
   In a statement, Tate and Lyle said its appraisal of some
of Berisford's non-sugar businesses showed a takeover would
be ill-advised. Berisford had no immediate comment on Tate &
Lyle's decision.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Last month, Britain's Department of Trade and Industry
ordered an investigation of the competitive impact of such a
merger on the country's sugar industry. Berisford and Tate &
Lyle together control about 95% of the country's sugar
supplies.</p>
<p>A Tate & Lyle spokesman said the investigation "led Tate &
Lyle to conclude that it didn't want to proceed with a bid
for the company."</p>
<p>The inquiry also found that an acquisition of Berisford
would jeopardize Tate & Lyle's cane sugar refining margins. A
Tate & Lyle spokesman said a merger with Berisford, a large
sugar beet refiner, might have led to an end to European
Community and U.K. government payments, which support Tate &
Lyle's cane sugar refining activities against competition in
the EC.</p>
