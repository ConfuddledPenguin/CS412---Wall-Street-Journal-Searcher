	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- Securities and Exchange Chairman Richard
Breeden asked five exchanges to settle their differences and
come up with a joint plan by Sept. 21 for having several
exchanges list options on individual stocks.
   He also asked, in letters to the heads of the exchanges,
that the exchanges extend until Oct. 1 a moratorium on
listing any options that were traded on another exchange
before Jan. 22 of this year. That moratorium expired
Saturday.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The move, which had been expected, came in response to two
plans submitted by the exchanges to create options-trading
networks. One plan -- supported by the Chicago Board Options
Exchange and the New York, American and Pacific stock
exchanges -- would create electronic links allowing options
to be bought and sold at the best price on any exchange, much
as stocks are traded.</p>
<p>Under another proposal, being pushed by the Philadelphia
Stock Exchange, when two exchanges show the same price for an
option, orders would automatically go to the exchange that
posted the price first.</p>
<p>Options, which are divided into puts and calls, permit
holders to buy or sell a stock at a specified price for a
limited period. A call is an option to buy, and a put is an
option to sell.</p>
<p>Currently, trading in most options is allocated by a
lottery system to a single exchange, and they then can be
traded only through that exchange. The SEC has argued that
these monopolies don't benefit the consumer.</p>
