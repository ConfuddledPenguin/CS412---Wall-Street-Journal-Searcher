	<p class="article-leader">DALLAS -- Integra-A Hotel & Restaurant Co., said that
Thomas J. Corcoran Jr. resigned as president and chief
executive officer but will remain on the board. He has been
succeeded by David R.A. Steadman, an Integra director for the
past year and president of Atlantic Management Associates
Inc.
   Mr. Corcoran's resignation came a day after Integra said
an agreement providing $10 million in new capital for the
company was terminated. The failed agreement also would have
allowed Hallwood Group Inc. to sell its 13% stake in Integra.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Company officials were unavailable to say whether Mr.
Corcoran's resignation was related to the failed agreement.</p>
