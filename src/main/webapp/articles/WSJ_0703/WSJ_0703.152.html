	<p class="article-leader">Broken Hill Proprietary Co. of Australia expects to
increase earnings this fiscal year ending May 31, 1991,
executives of the steel, oil and mining company said
yesterday.
   Brian Loton, BHP's chief executive, said the company "is
in excellent financial shape" and he predicts a
"satisfactory" year.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Last week BHP reported that operating profit after tax
rose 6.4% to 1.1 billion Australian dollars (US$872.1
million) in the fiscal year ended May 31 from A$1.04 billion
a year earlier.</p>
<p>Mr. Loton said one reason for stronger profits this fiscal
year is the expected start-up of BHP's 57.5%-owned Escondida
copper mine in Chile. Development of the mine is ahead of
schedule and it could start production in December.</p>
<p>"This mine will be one of the lowest cost operations in
the world and will produce around 4% of the world's copper
supplies. It is an extraordinarily large and rich deposit,"
Mr. Loton said.</p>
