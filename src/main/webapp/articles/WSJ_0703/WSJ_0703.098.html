	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- The Justice Department said it expanded its
investigation into possible antitrust violations by major
U.S. airlines.
   James Rill, the department's antitrust chief, said that
prosecutors are investigating a pricing arrangement between
two airlines whose names he declined to disclose.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The Justice Department is conducting four other
investigations of possible anticompetitive activity in the
airline industry. These involve the actions of major carriers
that dominate certain large airports, known as hubs; the
relationship between airlines and the industry's computerized
clearinghouse for fares; possible collusion related to
certain fare changes made in September 1989; and the buying
and selling of slots at Chicago's O'Hare airport by United
Airlines.</p>
<p>Individual airlines under Justice Department scrutiny have
denied any wrongdoing.</p>
