	<p class="article-leader">If you thought the Japanese were gaining on us now, just
wait. Should an advertising tax ever go into effect, U.S.
companies' competitiveness would really suffer. That's the
unabashedly scare-mongering conclusion of a study being
released today by the Leadership Council on Advertising
Issues.
   The study's findings aren't terribly surprising, given
that the Leadership Council, made up of advertisers and media
companies, proclaims its mission is "to preserve and enhance
the freedom to advertise." Nevertheless, the study is sure to
be devoured by advertisers attempting to fend off new ad tax
proposals that seem to be popping up as fast as old ones can
be swatted down.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Introducing a tax would choke spending on brand
advertising, the study contends. And with less advertising,
U.S. companies would lose the edge they have over their
foreign competitors, it warns. Stifling advertising in the
U.S., it implies, would be like doubling South Korea's labor
costs -- it would wipe out the country's competitive
advantage.</p>
<p>"It is clear to us that advertising is one of the last few
comparative advantages that American companies have in
international competition. By taxing it, you neutralize it as
a comparative advantage," says William Lilley III, president
of Policy Communications Inc. and a former CBS executive, who
co-wrote the study with Rudolph Gerhard Penner, a senior
fellow with the Urban Institute, a think tank.</p>
<p>The study contends that since U.S. companies spend
proportionately more on brand advertising than do foreign
competitors, any ad tax would hurt the U.S. companies that
much more. In 1986, for instance, U.S. companies spent 1.6%
of the country's gross national product on advertising.
European companies as a whole spent just 0.9% of the
continent's gross domestic product, while Japanese companies
spent a measly 0.7%. Among the U.S. advertisers most hurt,
the study adds, would be those that spend the largest
percentage of sales on advertising, including drug firms,
cigarette makers, toy companies and household products
makers.</p>
<p>For all its dire warnings, though, the study isn't likely
to carry much weight in Washington circles. Plenty of people
on Capitol Hill think U.S. companies already spend too much
on advertising -- the fluff, as they see it -- and not enough
on basic research and development. Any measure that curtails
U.S. companies' obsessive ad spending might not be such a bad
thing, in their view.</p>
<p>"We aren't spending enough on research and development,
equipment and machinery, compared with our competitors
overseas. Perhaps our spending allocations are misguided,"
suggests Rob Hartwell, chief of staff for Representative Dick
Schulze (R., Pa.), who has looked at the issue of
advertising's deductibility compared with the tax treatment
of equipment and machinery. "Maybe our {advertising} spending
is out of line compared with spending on equipment and
machinery."</p>
<p>But advertisers are sure to rally around the study. They
have to, considering that their industry is facing an
unprecedented attack by legislators. At least a dozen states
have considered introducing ad taxes in the past year, among
them Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Kentucky, New York, South
Dakota, Vermont, Connecticut, Massachusetts, Colorado,
Oklahoma, Missouri and Kansas. California and Florida have
considered legislation removing the deductibility of ad
spending for tobacco and alcohol. None of those initiatives
has yet been successful.</p>
<p>Even more frightening is the specter of a federal ad tax,
which emerged as a possibility in light of President Bush's
decision last week that he'll have to raise taxes after all.
Some government tax officials are contemplating a plan that
would cut the tax deduction for advertising expenses to 80%
from the current 100%. And in a long book of tax options
released earlier this year, the Congressional Budget Office
also included a measure reducing advertising's deductibility.</p>
<p>Mr. Lilley insists legislators simply don't understand
that advertising plays a role in international
competitiveness. By taxing ads or otherwise making it more
expensive, in turn forcing companies to cut back on it, "you
inadvertently blunt the skills of American companies versus
the skills of European and Asian competitors," who rely less
on brand ads, he says.</p>
<p>Not only would U.S. companies be hurt at home with an ad
tax, they would be killed abroad, too, the study contends. It
notes that U.S. firms often use brand names developed here to
expand into foreign markets. If the firms must cut back on
U.S. ads, it suggests, their brand names won't be as strong
and won't travel nearly so well.</p>
<p>Even worse, firms would divert ad dollars into short-term
promotions like coupons and sweepstakes in order to avoid the
tax, the study says. Ad industry executives have long railed
against promotions as short-sighted gimmicks that don't help
create brand images -- and in fact can undermine brands over
time.</p>
<p>Certainly, foreign companies such as the Japanese and
German auto makers already advertise heavily in the U.S., and
would be hit just as hard by an ad tax as their U.S.
counterparts. But in a number of other areas, the foreigners
just don't rely on ads the way U.S. companies do.</p>
<p>Black & Decker power tools, for one, maintains an edge
over major Japanese and German competitors that make
similar-quality products because it spends nearly 6% of sales
on ads, while its two top foreign competitors spend 2%, the
study says. Black & Decker's dominance "depends on
advertising," it says, but that dominance could well be
undermined if the company is forced to cut back on ad
spending.</p>
