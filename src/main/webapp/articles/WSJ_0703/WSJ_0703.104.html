	<p class="article-leader">Advance copies of Harold T.P. Hayes's posthumous "The Dark
Romance of Dian Fossey" (Simon & Schuster, 352 pages, $21.95)
come with an enthusiastic blurb from the man who created
Archie Bunker and helped destroy Robert Bork. According to
Norman Lear, "Harold Hayes delivers Ms. Fossey in an envelope
of compassion and understanding that derives from his own
25-year love affair with Africa. To top that off, his prose
is simply brilliant."
   Mr. Hayes's prose is pretty good, but the remark about
"compassion" made me wonder if Mr. Lear and I were reading
the same book. In "Dark Romance," Mr. Hayes methodically
demolishes the prettified image of the martyred gorilla lover
conveyed in the unstintingly dumb movie "Gorillas in the
Mist" and discusses in detail what the film -- and the
autobiography it was based on -- left out. In the place of
Sigourney Weaver's Radcliffe-Goes-to-Rwanda savior of
mountain gorillas, we now are face to face with a brute: a
vindictive, egomaniacal misanthrope whose love of the
endangered mountain gorilla eventually led her to flog
poachers' genitals, smear them with excrement, kidnap their
children, gun down peasants' livestock, and generally make
life unpleasant for anyone who fooled around with her
personal primates.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>She was not without grievance. Where the movie shows Ms.
Fossey merely being kicked out of the Belgian Congo during
its ferocious civil war of the middle 1960s, the book
investigates Ms. Fossey's oft-repeated assertion that she was
gang-raped by Congolese troops, shortly before three of her
young human proteges either were eaten or burned alive. This
would seem to explain, without condoning, her animosity for
Africans the rest of her life, an animosity so profound that
the greatest mystery about her unsolved murder in 1985 is not
who did it but why it took so long to happen.</p>
<p>"I told her that if she stayed, I fully expected she would
have her throat cut by the end of the year," her former
fiance, a white African, told Mr. Hayes. "It was absolutely
ludicrous to live on a mountain out there, harassing a bunch
of poachers and expecting to stay alive."</p>
<p>"Dark Romance" is a very fine book, but a very depressing
one. What makes it all the more depressing is that Mr. Hayes,
a former editor of Esquire who recently died of a brain
tumor, is no longer around to accept praise -- or fend off
attacks -- for a book sure to be unpopular with admirers of
the Sigourneyized Fossey. We read about an unglamorous,
reclusive, sexually unfulfilled physical therapist who had
spent 10 undistinguished years in Louisville, Ky., before she
decided to visit friends in Africa. There she fell in love
with the exceedingly rare mountain gorilla, and spent the
rest of her life in a suicidal war with poachers and farmers
determined to make the gorillas even more rare.</p>
<p>Along the way, there was her capture by the Congolese (Mr.
Hayes seems to doubt that she was raped, but others don't),
the murder of her assistants, two abortions, incessant health
problems, and no money. Meanwhile, poachers periodically were
chopping off the heads, hands and feet of her beloved
gorillas, whose number at one point had dwindled to around
210 (they are now back above 300). That she survived as long
as she did Mr. Hayes attributes to her convincing the locals
that she was a witch.</p>
<p>Most certainly, she was an extremely lonely woman who
invariably sought to bed down with the men who came to work
with her, then harassed them if they refused her advances.
Mr. Hayes portrays her as a manipulative back-stabber who
would do anything to get her way, though, considering the
line of work she was in, a bit of manipulative back-stabbing
hardly seems excessive. The gorillas were getting stabbed in
the front.</p>
<p>If the book has a failing, it is Mr. Hayes's insufficient
awe of Ms. Fossey's immense physical courage. But he is right
on target when he wonders about the wisdom of having
well-meaning white women from Louisville telling dirt-poor
blacks from one of the most densely populated countries in
Africa what they should be doing with their land, animals and
time. He particularly faults her for encouraging her staff to
fire on poachers. Once the shooting started, the locals
retaliated by killing off six gorillas. The man who started
the shooting, Alan Goodall, now laments: "It was as though
Rwanda had become our own private empire, with no sense of
responsibility on our part to those involved . . . I had the
feeling after I left that the African people wanted to see
all the gorillas killed so that all of us would leave."</p>
<p>Mr. Hayes also believes that Ms. Fossey was wrong to
reject appeals to turn the preserve into a tourist
attraction, arguing that the best way to save an endangered
species is by providing locals with a powerful economic
motive for keeping them alive. In fact, the only truly
humorous passage in the book concerns a young surfer from San
Diego who worked for a few months as a volunteer in Ms.
Fossey's camp, and who tried to convince her of the virtues
of free enterprise.</p>
<p>"I said, `Dian, this is nuts, man. You call up Yamaha and
Honda and you get them a deal that says you'll publicize
their equipment, and they'll give them (motorcycles) to you
for free. And you can do five days' work in four hours] You
don't have to walk a mile-and-a-half an hour up a vertical
hillside. You sit on a motorcycle, and putt-putt-putt, you're
there. That'll scare the hell out of the poachers."</p>
<p>No, it wouldn't.</p>
