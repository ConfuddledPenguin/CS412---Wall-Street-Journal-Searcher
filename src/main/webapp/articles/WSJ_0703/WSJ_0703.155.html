	<p class="article-leader">Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp. teamed with the state of
Michigan, lenders, mortgage insurers and community groups to
provide up to $500 million in loans for low-income and
moderate-income home buyers.
   Freddie Mac figures the program will help up to 10,000
people buy homes in Michigan and will serve as a prototype
for other states.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The program offers 30-year, fixed-rate, single-family
mortgage loans with a minimum 5% down payment through
participating lenders. Freddie Mac has agreed to buy $250
million of such loans over a two-year period beginning in
October, and the state can extend the program for one year
and expand Freddie Mac's purchases by an additional $250
million.</p>
<p>Under the program, borrowers whose incomes are close to or
below the state's median family income and can't qualify for
a conventional loan could spend up to 33% of their monthly
income on housing. Current guidelines allow for 28% with a 5%
down payment.</p>
<p>Also, up to 1% of the down payment can come from nonprofit
community organizations or governmental or community
agencies, and another 1% can come from "sweat equity" work
performed before a buyer goes to closing.</p>
<p>The program also includes counseling for potential
borrowers by community organizations that have been approved
by Freddie Mac and the state. And Freddie Mac said borrowers
without substantial credit histories can use records of
regular payments to power companies, telephone companies,
landlords and others. In addition, the program requires
mortgage insurance on at least 75% of the value; Freddie Mac
and Michigan said they would share losses that aren't covered
by insurance.</p>
<p>Freddie Mac, a federally sponsored, publicly traded
corporation based in Reston, Va., operates a secondary market
in mortgage loans, buying loans from lenders and packaging
them into securities for sale to investors.</p>
