	<p class="article-leader">Ralph M. Ingersoll II, battered by a heavy debt load and a
downturn in the newspaper industry, is relinquishing his
ownership in the U.S. publishing empire he built up over the
past two decades.
   Ingersoll Publications Co. said E.M. Warburg Pincus & Co.
will acquire all of Mr. Ingersoll's stock in his three U.S.
companies, which publish metropolitan daily newspapers in New
Haven, Conn.; St. Louis; Trenton, N.J, and elsewhere. Warburg
has been Mr. Ingersoll's partner for seven years, helping to
finance his ambitious acquisition drive in the 1980s.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Mr. Ingersoll will in turn acquire Warburg's 50% stake in
Ingersoll Publications Ltd., publisher of English and Irish
newspapers. After the split, both companies are expected to
have equity they value at between $200 million and $300
million each.</p>
<p>The dismemberment of the Ingersoll empire comes after a
year in which Mr. Ingersoll faced a worsening debt situation,
particularly at his Community Newspapers Inc. unit, whose
expansion in recent years was financed largely by junk debt
issued by Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. Mr. Ingersoll's other
unit, Ingersoll Newspapers Inc., had a loss of $30 million on
the St. Louis Sun, a start-up daily newspaper that folded
after seven months.</p>
<p>"This is a total collapse of Ralph's plan to build a giant
media company in the U.S. and Europe," said John Morton, an
analyst with Lynch, Jones & Ryan, Washington, D.C.</p>
<p>Mr. Ingersoll, for his part, said in an interview that he
welcomes the split because it will enable him to pursue what
he believes are greater opportunities in Europe. Though he
denied industry reports that his relationship with Warburg
had unraveled recently, he acknowledged there was a
"divergence of objectives" between him and the New York
venture capital and investment concern. Mr. Ingersoll said
Warburg Pincus wanted to put more money into the company and
own more equity. "I foresaw a whole succession of projects
like the (St. Louis) Sun that would make them uncomfortable,"
Mr. Ingersoll said. "I would rather put the burden on my
shoulders alone."</p>
<p>In a statement, Warburg Chief Executive Lionel Pincus said
"we are saddened that our long partnership with Ralph
Ingersoll has come to an end." Although analysts speculated
that Warburg will now try to sell off some of the Ingersoll
properties, Warburg said it has no plans at present to do so.
However, Mr. Ingersoll said negotiations were continuing for
the planned sale of This Week, a chain of 76 free weekly
newspapers on Long Island, N.Y.</p>
<p>After spending binges fueled by roughly $500 million in
junk-bond debt raised by Michael Milken, the junk-bond wizard
of the now-defunct Drexel, Mr. Ingersoll's three U.S.
companies carry bank and other long-term debt at face value
in excess of $700 million. Mr. Ingersoll's London-based
Ingersoll Publications Ltd. isn't as highly leveraged. It has
annual revenue of $178 million, cash flow of $40 million and
bank debt of $109 million.</p>
<p>Warburg Pincus will assume one of the sources of Mr.
Ingersoll's problems: debt payments on bonds issued by
Community Newspapers Inc. Warburg Pincus said Community
Newspapers wouldn't make a $7 million semiannual interest
payment due yesterday on its 13% senior subordinated "reset"
notes, and said CNI wouldn't be able to reset the bond's
interest rate by this Saturday's deadline, as was required.</p>
<p>The interest rates on CNI's bonds are to be reset so the
bonds trade at full face value. The CNI junk bonds, issued
originally in 1987 by Drexel, have traded as low as 35 cents
on the dollar this year. CNI would have been forced to pay a
prohibitively high interest rate to meet its reset
obligations. Bondholders have retained Smith Barney, Harris
Upham & Co. as independent advisers. Smith Barney executives
didn't return calls for comment.</p>
<p>Mr. Pincus said in his statement that he hoped "CNI would
be able to work out its financial problems with the holders
of its subordinated indebtedness . . . negotiations on those
matters have been in process for several months."</p>
<p>To date, CNI bondholders have resisted tender offers by
Ingersoll Newspapers, which offered holders of the senior
bonds 55 cents on the dollar.</p>
<p>Warburg Pincus will take control of three U.S. companies,
which include: Ingersoll Newspapers Inc., which publishes
nine dailies and 53 weekly newspapers; New Haven Acquisition
Co., publisher of the New Haven (Conn.) Register; and
Community Newspapers Inc., publisher of daily newspapers in
Ohio and Long Island. Robert Jelenic, currently president of
both CNI and INI, will become chief executive officer of
Warburg Pincus's U.S. newspaper properties.</p>
