	<p class="article-leader">FAIRFIELD, N.J. -- Prime Motor Inns Inc. said it expects
to post a "substantial" loss for the year ended June 30,
after adding to restructuring-related reserves and
write-downs totaling $150 million.
   In fiscal 1989, Prime had net income of $77.4 million, or
$2.35 a share, on revenue of $410.3 million.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The hotel company also said it completed the previously
announced sale of its Howard Johnson and Ramada franchise
businesses to an affiliate of Blackstone Capital Partners
L.P. for $170 million. Blackstone is an affiliate of
Blackstone Group, a New York investment banking firm.</p>
<p>Prime used proceeds of the sale primarily to pay down
debt, although part will be invested in developing Prime's
AmeriSuites and Wellesley Inn chains. Prime said the sale
would result in an estimated pretax gain of about $60 million
in the quarter ending Sept. 30. In the year-ago first
quarter, Prime had net of $20.8 million, or 63 cents a share,
on revenue of $104 million.</p>
<p>Prime also said its banks agreed to extend the maturity of
$60 million of demand loans beyond the due date of March 25,
1991. Prime said it has reduced its bank debt to less than
$130 million from about $350 million several months ago.</p>
<p>Prime said about $80 million of the $150 million in
reserves and write-downs relates to its investment in
Servico, a hotel operator. Last month, Prime extended to Dec.
31 the maturity of a $74 million loan it made to FCD
Hospitality Inc. last year as part of FCD's purchase of
Servico. Prime said it is continuing to work toward a
recapitalization of Servico.</p>
<p>The remaining charges relate primarily to Prime's mortgage
and notes receivable portfolio, an official said.</p>
