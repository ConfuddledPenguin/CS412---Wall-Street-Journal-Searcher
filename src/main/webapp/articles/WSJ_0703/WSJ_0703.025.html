	<p class="article-leader">SAALFELD, East Germany -- The chief pastor for this
industrial region stopped short Sunday when he saw a white
trailer, labeled Walter's Fast Food, parked outside the
15th-century walls of his church.
   "By whose authority are you here?" demanded Pastor Peter
Zimmermann of the bold entrepreneur. "Monetary union doesn't
mean I have to turn over the churchyard to dealers and money
changers."</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Despite the pastor's biblical allusions following last
weekend's German monetary union, capitalism is here to stay
in Saalfeld, an East German town of 35,000 near the border
with West Germany. Walter, of Walter's Fast Food, had the
proper city permit to serve bratwurst and libation to local
burghers lining up to withdraw their first West German marks
from the savings bank across Church Square. To the church's
relief, Walter moved his business to a more lucrative part of
the city once the bank rush was over.</p>
<p>The Protestant pastors of this region, who helped lead the
fight to bring down the old Communist regime, now complain
that the fight for democracy has become a triumph of
commercialism. Inside St. John's Church, Pastor Ardnt
Morgenroth warned his Sabbath congregation of approaching
unemployment, bankruptcies and crass commercialism. But only
50 worshippers, half the always small turnout, were there to
hear him. The rest were collecting their West German marks.</p>
<p>The church's ranks had already shrunk by 56 members who
withdrew their names in fear that they would now have to pay
West German church taxes. Now Pastor Morgenroth was urging
his remaining flock not to throw away 40 years of their hard
work to accept the ways and products of the West Germans. "Is
it really necessary to make ourselves so small?" he asked
from his pulpit. "Aren't there some things we can do better?"</p>
<p>The answer from most East Germans here would be: "Not
really." The large steel and chemical companies that were the
town's major employers have not only badly polluted the area
but are tottering financially and aren't likely to survive
once West German subsidies run out.</p>
<p>The fear of unemployment is widespread in East Germany.
Yesterday, the first business day after monetary unification,
as many as 15,000 East Berlin-area workers briefly put down
their tools to demand, among other things, guaranteed jobs,
union officials said.</p>
<p>In Saalfeld, new businesses that have opened won't provide
sufficient jobs to take up the slack, though their presence
already has made Saalfeld's streets more colorful and shows
how quickly some East Germans are adjusting. A travel office
offers the first package tours to Greece, Egypt and Majorca.</p>
<p>Two West German supermarkets provide shelves full of
Western products and bright sales signs outside. Four banks
are pushing new investment products, and taxi drivers offer
shiny silver Audis. Local pubs have signed contracts with
West German brewers who have given them brightly lit signs
that overshadow the pub names.</p>
<p>Down the road from downtown Saalfeld at the Golden Lion
pub, workers from the local chemical fiber company don't seem
fazed by the doubled prices for beer and wurst. They chug the
brew and wolf the meat as they watch West Germany's national
team defeat Czechoslovakia 1-0.</p>
<p>"If you are thirsty, then you pay whatever the beer
costs," says Andre Keller, a 27-year-old machinist at the
chemical factory. "I can only know how far my money will go
by spending it, so that's what I am doing." Yet the workers
here are worried. The factory already has cut Mr. Keller's
work month to 11 days, and he expects layoffs by the end of
the summer. And work is less fun. Lunch hours have been
reduced to a half hour; the twice-a-day coffee breaks have
been eliminated. "Everyone is afraid of being fired, and
taking a lunch-break that is 15 minutes too long might give
them the excuse they are looking for," he said.</p>
<p>All that stands between much of this region and
unemployment are transitional industrial subsidies from the
West German government and hopes that a foreign rescuer might
yet appear. And the mood is surreal. The workers have one
foot firmly planted in the past of low wages, bad work habits
and expectations that the state will provide. But the other
foot is being forced into a new world of higher prices,
greater work demands and uncertainty.</p>
<p>At the Saalfeld Savings Bank, employees say the local
citizenry is withdrawing less money than they had expected.
Unsure about prices, most Saalfelders bought several weeks
worth of groceries recently. Unsure about employment
prospects, many are simply saving their money until they
understand better precisely what it is worth.</p>
<p>Bank customers say the money they are withdrawing is often
specifically dedicated to buying goods many of them couldn't
afford before: washing machines, vacuum cleaners and, of
course, cars, for which East Germans once had to wait 15
years.</p>
<p>"The first five loan applications since Sunday are to buy
automobiles," says Christine Puetke, the 29-year-old credit
director. She already has extended 50 loans to local people
to either modernize or establish new businesses, but she
concedes that West German advisers help them make all
decisions. "Only they really understand what the chances are
for individual businesses," she says.</p>
<p>Sadly for Saalfeld, the company that is in the greatest
danger is its biggest employer: the Max Steel Works. Town
fathers say the company, which belonged to the Flick
industrial group until it was nationalized after the war, is
in such bad shape that the Flick family, now in West Germany,
doesn't want to exercise rights it may have over the
property. Other Western companies have balked at stepping in.</p>
<p>Part of the problem is that the company's directors, many
of them picked more for their Communist Party loyalty than
their business acumen, remain in place. They took few steps
to make the plant more profitable in the weeks ahead of
monetary union. New faces have been admitted at company
meetings where decisions are made about the future. But the
newcomers don't dare stand up to the directors, partly due to
fears that there is an underground of former party officials
and state security informants. And the threat of layoffs only
feeds this uncertainty.</p>
<p>"Max Steel Works has to figure that half or more of its
people will be let go, so everyone is afraid to speak," says
Horst Sterzik, the mayor of the factory town where many
laborers live. "My interest is to create new workplaces --
medium-sized and small companies to replace the jobs that
will be lost at the big plants."</p>
<p>But Mr. Sterzik finds that job difficult because of the
many unsettled property claims. He has many applications for
new businesses, but many of them require the purchase of
nationalized real estate whose ownership is in question. Many
previous owners are making claims and settlement could take
months.</p>
<p>One of the biggest unsettled questions for this region is
what will become of the three-mile-wide band along the border
from which 50,000 to 80,000 families were relocated. East
Germany's Communist leadership forcibly moved any individuals
they didn't consider reliable. West Germany now would like
the border area to be a zone of economic growth, but a new
organization has been formed to help those who were forced
out to get reparations.</p>
