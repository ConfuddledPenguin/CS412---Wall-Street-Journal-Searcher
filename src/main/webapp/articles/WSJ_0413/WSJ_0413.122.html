	<p class="article-leader">TOKYO -- A drop in imports last month caused Japan's trade
surplus to widen for the first time in 11 months, but
government officials and economists said the rise was due
largely to one-time factors.
   The March surplus, measured when goods passed through
customs, rose 7.2% to $7.09 billion from $6.61 billion a year
earlier, the Finance Ministry said. Exports fell 1.8% to
$26.01 billion from $26.49 billion, while imports dropped
4.8% to $18.92 billion from $19.88 billion. The widening of
the surplus was the first since April 1989, when it rose 7.7%
to $7.3 billion.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Officials said the year-on-year decline in imports came
about because of unusually high imports in March 1989, when
Japanese consumers and companies rushed to purchase goods
before imposition of a consumption tax that April; March 1989
imports jumped 30.3% from the year before. A Finance Ministry
official noted that last month's imports were actually higher
than February's $16.95 billion.</p>
<p>The March trade surplus with the U.S., meanwhile,
contracted 5.9% to $3.77 billion. Imports fell 2.2% to $4.54
billion, while exports dropped 3.9% to $8.31 billion. Imports
from the U.S. were boosted by a more than fivefold increase
in airplane purchases to $231.8 million, the government
official said. But Japanese car makers increased exports
11.3% to the U.S. in the month to $2.17 billion, mainly to
fill their self-restraining quota before the end of the March
31 fiscal year. Auto exports have dropped in recent months,
contributing to the steady decline in the trade surplus.</p>
<p>For the full fiscal year, Japan's global surplus
contracted 24.3% to $59.68 billion. Imports increased at a
double-digit pace for the third year in a row, rising 10.3%
to $213.96 billion. Exports rose only 0.3% to $273.64
billion.</p>
<p>But the fiscal year surplus with the U.S. narrowed at a
slower, 12.7% pace to $42.75 billion. The surplus with the
U.S. made up 71.6% of the total surplus, compared with 62.1%
a year earlier.</p>
<p>Economists expect the surplus to shrink again in April but
at a slower pace. That expectation is based primarily on the
recent strength of the dollar, which has been pushing down
the value of dollar-denominated exports. "The low yen during
the past year seems to have pushed up volume" of exports,
said Toshiaki Kakimoto, chief economist at Sumitomo Bank.
Export volume stayed level in the last few months of 1989 but
rose 2% in February from the year before and 4% in March. "As
the yen becomes lower," said Mr. Kakimoto, the surplus "won't
fall as it used to."</p>
<p>Import growth, caused by strong domestic demand, is also
slowing, said Matthew Berlow, an economist at Credit Lyonnais
Securities (Japan). The dollar's recent sharp rise against
the yen will mask the increase in export volume for a few
more months. But the surplus may expand more consistently
toward year end.</p>
<p>That would be bad news for the Japanese government, which
is under U.S. pressure to remove so-called structural
barriers that the U.S. says prevent the surplus from
shrinking even more. In negotiations that ended last week,
U.S. officials particularly pressed Japan to revise a rigid
law governing its retail system, so American companies can
have a better chance of selling their goods in Japan.</p>
<p>After seasonal adjustment, March's trade surplus stood at
$5.89 billion, up 3.2% from February's $5.71 billion.
Adjusted imports rose 7.5% to $18.75 billion from $17.44
billion, while adjusted exports rose 6.4% to $24.63 billion
from $23.15 billion.</p>
