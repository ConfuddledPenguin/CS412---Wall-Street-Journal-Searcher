	<p class="article-leader">I was troubled by your March 15 item "White Married
Mothers, Working for Better Life" in the People Patterns
column. I find the assumption of Penn State researchers David
Eggebeen and Alan Hawkins that "if a married mother's husband
earns enough to provide the family with an `adequate' income,
the wife must be working chiefly to make things still better"
both offensive and questionable. To analyze economic data and
make statements about women's motivations is simply not good
science. Women, like men, are motivated to work for many
reasons not reflected in census data, such as personal
fulfillment and a desire to contribute to one's job and one's
profession.

<p>Apparently the Penn State researchers don't believe that
career satisfaction or professional recognition applies to
people of the female sex with children. They also apparently
never heard of wives, even those with children, out-earning
their husbands. It is not always possible to tell who makes
the incremental income.</p>
