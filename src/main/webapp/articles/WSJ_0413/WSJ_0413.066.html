	<p class="article-leader">HONG KONG -- Robert Riley looks back on 1989 as a year of
shocks for his hotels. The managing director of Mandarin
Oriental International Ltd. ticks off the tremors: three
hotels affected by the June 4 killings in Beijing, one jarred
by a coup attempt in Manila, the Philippines and one swayed
by an earthquake in San Francisco.
   The disturbances, however, didn't keep the hotel chain's
profit from growing 12% last year to a record HK$392.8
million (US$50.4 million). And Mandarin Oriental isn't the
only Hong Kong-based company continuing to prosper amid
concern that the local business environment is declining.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Profits of most of the main companies listed on Hong
Kong's stock exchange grew in 1989 for the fifth consecutive
year, despite widespread worries that China's turmoil and the
colony's uncertain political future would damp corporate
performance. Two of Hong Kong's biggest conglomerates, Cheung
Kong (Holdings) Ltd. and Jardine Matheson Holdings Ltd.,
surprised analysts with profit increases of 33% and 42%,
respectively.</p>
<p>In fact, the rate of profit growth for all companies
making up the Hang Seng index slowed only slightly from the
previous year, to 21% from 21.4%, according to a survey by
brokerage firm Hoare Govett Asia Ltd. And while those rates
were well off the breakneck pace of 1986 and 1987 earnings
increases, Hong Kong's economy was booming during the earlier
period.</p>
<p>Analysts expect the colony's slowing economy and the
consolidation of past gains to lead to a significant drop in
profit growth this year. Hoare Govett projects a rise of only
12% for Hang Seng-index companies in 1990. Even so, there is
broad agreement that local companies are performing well in
difficult times.</p>
<p>"If Hong Kong is that resilient and can survive June 4,
maybe the risk of investing here isn't so high," says
Christopher Chong, an analyst at James Capel (Far East) Ltd.
(The killings of demonstrators by Chinese troops in Beijing
on June 4, 1989, caused a sharp deterioration in confidence
about Hong Kong's future.)</p>
<p>The strength of the latest results could inspire new faith
in many Hong Kong companies. Coming amid doubts that Hong
Kong can continue to prosper when it returns to Chinese
sovereignty in 1997, the corporate results may lift the
spirits of international investors and local businessmen, and
lend credence to analysts who have argued that political
meddling from Beijing won't directly affect businesses in
Hong Kong.</p>
<p>"These results should show people that Hong Kong isn't
going to collapse overnight," says Victor Kwok, an analyst at
Elders Roach Asia Ltd.</p>
<p>Indeed, anticipation of strong profits helped the Hang
Seng index rise 5.7% in the first quarter, despite persistent
turmoil in the New York and Tokyo markets. In the past, the
Hong Kong exchange usually has echoed sharp movements in
those major markets. The announcement of Jardine Matheson's
results, for example, pushed the market up 1.6% in a single
day.</p>
<p>The Hong Kong market did, however, get jolted on Monday by
a 6.6% drop in Tokyo's Nikkei average. The Hang Seng index
fell 63.28 points, or 2.1%</p>
<p>Hong Kong shares have long traded at prices well below the
value of their underlying assets, largely because investors
regard the colony's future as uncertain. A shift in that
perception, or a so-called rerating of Hong Kong stocks,
would probably lead to a sharp rise in share prices.</p>
<p>Not that there aren't several question marks hanging over
Hong Kong companies and the stock market. The flight of
skilled workers and managers is eroding the efficiency of
local businesses. A shortage of manual labor is keeping wages
and inflation high and stifling some businesses' growth.
Moreover, Hong Kong's economic growth slowed last year, and
many analysts believe corporate investment declined after
June 4.</p>
<p>"There won't be a significant improvement {in the stock
market} until there are signs that the economy is turning
around," says Phillip Niem, research director at Hoare
Govett.</p>
<p>In the short term, the dull economy may cloud investors'
perception of the stock market and keep down the share prices
of what many analysts regard as increasingly sound companies.
Analysts argue that companies that stood up to 1989's
difficulties aren't likely to crumble now.</p>
<p>"What we're seeing is the success of two themes," says
Niall Shiner, an analyst at BT Brokerage Asia Ltd. "The
movement to very high-quality earnings that can be
independent of the economy and an increase in international
earnings."</p>
<p>Underlying the earnings growth of many big companies is a
shift in strategy begun in the mid-1980s. For real-estate
companies in particular, the change in focus from property
development, where profit depends on often-volatile prices,
to retaining and renting out buildings is proving prudent.</p>
<p>"Property-investment companies now make up 9% of the Hang
Seng index," says Stuart Cook, an analyst at Baring
Securities (Hong Kong) Ltd. "Once a rental agreement is
signed, the company isn't subject to these political
hiccups."</p>
