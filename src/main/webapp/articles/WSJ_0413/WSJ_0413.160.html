West Germany.
   Legislators in East Berlin formally elected Christian
Democrat de Maiziere as prime minister and approved his
23-member coalition cabinet. The 400-member Parliament also
embraced the new government's rapid process for
reunification, which calls for the merger of German
currencies by July 1. The cabinet also agreed that a united
Germany should at least temporarily remain part of NATO. The
government also apologized to Jews for Nazi atrocities during
World War II, and recognized the legitimacy of Poland's
postwar borders.</p>
