	<p class="article-leader">PERTH -- Australian financier Kerry Packer withdrew a
hostile takeover bid for Bond Media Ltd., a national
television station operator that is part of Alan Bond's
beleaguered corporate empire.
   Mr. Packer sold the network to Bond in 1987 for around 1
billion Australian dollars (US$766 million). He still is owed
A$200 million from that transaction. When it looked as if the
cash-strapped Bond group couldn't repay the debt, Mr. Packer
began a takeover bid for Bond Media that valued the company
at just A$53 million.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Mr. Packer announced in December that he would offer one
share in a new company, Television Corp. of Australia, for
every 10 Bond Media shares. It valued Bond Media at 10 cents
a share -- the stock currently is trading at about 13 cents a
share -- and attracted few acceptances.</p>
<p>An underwriting agreement arranged by Packer for the bid
expires Sunday. Packer started wind-up, or liquidation
proceedings, on April 6 in the Western Australia state
Supreme Court against Bond Media. The action will be heard
May 2, with an application from Bond Media to have the
petition dismissed.</p>
<p>Bond Media, meanwhile, is trying to arrange a capital
injection from foreign television companies to reduce debt,
and wants to restructure its finances.</p>
<p>Separately, Bond Corp. International Ltd., a Hong Kong
unit of Mr. Bond's corporate group, said it concluded the
sale of its interest in Compania de Telefonos de Chile S.A.
for US$388.5 million.</p>
<p>The company announced in February a preliminary agreement
to sell its 53% stake in Chile's national telephone company
to T.I. Telefonica Internacional de Espana S.A. of Spain.</p>
<p>Bond Corp. is selling assets to reduce its total debt of
almost A$7 billion.</p>
