	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- President Bush has an "early" case of
glaucoma in his left eye and will be treated with eye drops,
White House physicians said after the president's annual
physical.
   Glaucoma is an eye ailment in which there is increased
pressure within the eyeball and a hardening of the eyeball.
It can lead to gradual deterioration of sight and can result
in blindness if not properly treated.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>In a written statement, the White House said that
"extensive visual testing" indicated that Mr. Bush hasn't
suffered any loss of sight because of the glaucoma. He will
begin taking eye drops to correct the condition and will take
the medication permanently, the White House said.</p>
<p>Otherwise, the four-hour exam indicated that Mr. Bush is
in "truly excellent health," Dr. Burton Lee, the White House
physician, said in the statement.</p>
