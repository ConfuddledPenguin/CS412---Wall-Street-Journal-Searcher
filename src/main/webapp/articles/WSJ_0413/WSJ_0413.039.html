	<p class="article-leader">HOWELL, N.J. -- Union Valley Corp. said it may miss a May
15 payment to certain of its debenture holders as it races
against the calendar to complete a revised bank-credit
agreement.
   The real estate concern also said a "liquidity deficiency"
has already caused it to default on a payment of $967,000
because of another creditor. In addition, the company has
missed interest payments to its lead lender, First Fidelity
Bank, for March and April. But the bank hasn't declared Union
Valley in default, though it also hasn't provided the company
with a written waiver.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>In making the disclosures, Herbert E. Wishnick, Union
Valley's president, said he couldn't offer assurances that
the company can restructure its senior debt or its 14 1/4%
subordinated debentures on which it owes the May 15 payment.</p>
<p>The disclosures were further signs of the company's
deepening financial woes. Union Valley previously announced
that First Fidelity Bank had declined to renew a $100 million
revolving credit agreement and had demanded repayment by Aug.
1 of $70.5 million outstanding. Union Valley said it has
relinquished all of its cash flow from its delivery of
housing units to Fidelity Bank since March 1, which hindered
its ability to pay other creditors.</p>
<p>Union Valley designs, builds and sells retirement and
pre-retirement communities, houses and commercial real estate
in New Jersey, Delaware and Pennsylvania. In 1989, it earned
$300,000, or eight cents a share, on revenue of $86.6
million.</p>
<p>"The company may encounter further difficulties in meeting
the payment terms of its outstanding debts until more
permanent sources of financing can be worked out or until
market conditions in the homebuilding industry improve," Mr.
Wishnick, the president, said.</p>
<p>He said that Union Valley and First Fidelity have agreed
on significant changes in the loan arrangement but that full
agreement is unlikely before June 30. As a result, Union
Valley is seeking interim financing, which it said will be in
place within a few days. This will allow the company to meet
some of its obligations, Mr. Wishnick said.</p>
