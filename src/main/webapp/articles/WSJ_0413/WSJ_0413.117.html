	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- The U.S. Trustee in Manhattan appointed a
shareholders' committee for Drexel Burnham Lambert Group
Inc.'s bankruptcy-law proceedings.
   The committee is made up of eight former Drexel employees
and a holder who was an original investor in one of the
firm's predecessor companies, said Deborah Midanek, the
committee's chairwoman. Ms. Midanek began organizing efforts
to form an equity committee in February, shortly after Drexel
filed under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. The
company has been selling its assets and plans to close all
its operations. Most of the company's stock was owned by
employees, who largely have lost their jobs since the
bankruptcy filing.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Ms. Midanek, who now works as an entrepreneur, said the
committee includes seven of Drexel's 100 largest
shareholders.</p>
<p>The U.S. Trustee's office, the Justice Department branch
that administers bankruptcy-court proceedings, began
contacting shareholders last month to see who was interested
in serving on the equity committee.</p>
<p>In Chapter 11 proceedings, a shareholders' committee
consults with the debtor on how the company conducts its
business and liquidation. Like the creditors' committee, it
also takes part in negotiating a plan for the company to pay
its debt and can seek the appointment of an examiner if it
opposes the debtor's actions.</p>
