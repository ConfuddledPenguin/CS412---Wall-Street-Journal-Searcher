	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Harper Collins Publishers, the book publishing
arm of Rupert Murdoch's News Corp., said it is putting J.P.
Lippincott Co. up for sale to reduce debt and focus Harper
Collins more tightly on book publishing.
   Publishing analysts said Lippincott, which publishes
specialized newsletters, journals and books on medical and
nursing topics, is believed to earn between $15 million and
$20 million a year on revenue of about $100 million. The
analysts said it could bring between $200 million and $250
million.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>George Craig, president and chief executive officer of
Harper Collins, declined to comment on the sum Lippincott is
expected to fetch. But he said that in combination with
several other divestures made recently Harper Collins will
collect about $500 million in all. News Corp. has said it
plans asset sales of about that much to reduce the publishing
subsidiary's debt, which totals nearly $1 billion.</p>
<p>Industry analysts said potential buyers include a number
of large, diversified media concerns, such as Paramount
Communications Inc. Paramount officials declined to comment.
Smaller publishing boutiques might also be buyers, such as
K-III Holdings, a year-old publishing concern headed by
William Reilly, ex-chief of Macmillan Inc., and financed by
Kohlberg, Kravis, Roberts & Co. "We're not in journals, and
we'd love to be," said Mr. Reilly. "It's a terrific
business."</p>
<p>Mr. Craig said other recent divestitures by Harper Collins
include Gordon & Gotch, a magazine distributor in New Zealand
and Australia, and the Angus & Robertson Bookshops, a chain
of about 100 stores in Australia. There were several other
small properties, he said, which he didn't identify.</p>
<p>Although Lippincott is quite profitable, "it is the
farthest away (of Harper's subsidiaries) from our mainstream
businesses," said Mr. Craig. "We've been evaluating our
portfolio recently and we decided to concentrate our efforts
on textbooks (elementary school through college), religious
books and general book publishing. We'll continue to grow and
we'll need money to grow."</p>
<p>News Corp. has quickly built a huge book-publishing
empire, piling up debt along the way. In 1987, it acquired
Harper & Row, a big but sleepy publishing house, for about
$300 million. News Corp. also bought a British publisher,
Collins; a religious publisher in the U.S., Zondervan; and
textbook publisher Scott, Foresman, for $407 million in
November.</p>
<p>Mr. Craig said the sale of Lippincott is being conducted
by investment adviser Munroe Pofcher of New York. The
Philadelphia-based publishing company, founded in 1792, is
regarded as an established name in an area of publishing that
is steadier than general-interest trade books. Harper & Row
bought Lippincott in 1978 for about $16 million and the
assumption of about $15 million in debt. Mr. Craig said it
has been quite profitable in recent years, growing in such
areas as electronic transmission of data to pharmacies.</p>
