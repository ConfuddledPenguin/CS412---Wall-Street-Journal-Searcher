	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Chemical Banking Corp.'s first-quarter net
income rose 29%, as the bank cut costs and its provision for
loan losses, while Bank of New York Co.'s net edged up 1.3%
despite a higher provision.
   Chemical's net climbed to $151.7 million, or $1.55 a
share, from $117.9 million, or $1.49 a share, in the
year-earlier period. Per-share profit reflected an offering
of 16.1 million shares in November.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Interest the bank received on loans declined 12% on
factors including lower payments from Brazil and Mexico on
medium-term and long-term loans.</p>
<p>Also, revenue from sources other than interest would have
been flat but for a $114.7 million gain before tax on the
sale of the bank's warrants and common stock in Florida
National Banks of Florida Inc.</p>
<p>Frank DeSantis Jr., analyst at PaineWebber Group Inc.,
noted that Chemical was able to pare expenses, and its
provision for loan losses dropped to $70 million from $90.7
million. The provision for loan losses at the Texas Commerce
unit took "a big positive swing" to $15 million from $39
million, he said.</p>
<p>Charge-offs of loans at the parent fell to $58 million
from $78.5 million, the bank said.</p>
<p>Fitch Investors Service Inc. cut its ratings on a number
of Chemical Banking's securities, including the senior debt
to triple-B-plus from single-A-minus. The downgrades,
affecting $540 million of debt and $200 million of preferred
stock, reflect "a weakened operating environment" in
Chemical's primary markets, the New York metro area and the
Northeast.</p>
<p>Bank of New York earnings rose to $102.3 million, or $1.38
a share, from $101.1 million, or $1.45 a share on fewer
shares a year earlier. The provision for loan losses climbed
to $63 million from $42 million in the year-earlier period.</p>
<p>The bank said the return on average assets in the latest
period was nearly flat at 0.86% compared with 0.85%. The
year-to-year quarterly comparisons are the first that fully
take into account Bank of New York's merger with Irving
Trust, which was completed in December 1988.</p>
<p>Chairman J. Carter Bacot said the company reduced loans
outstanding to less-developed countries to $552 million by
selling loans totaling $171 million, by reducing its Mexican
exposure by $86 million, and by charging off $31 million for
Argentine debt.</p>
<p>The loss allowance for less-developed-country loans is
$330 million, or about 60% of the total loans outstanding.
Nonperforming assets at March 31, 1990, totaled $1.19
billion, essentially unchanged from Dec. 31, 1989.</p>
<p>In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday,
Chemical Bank's stock rose $1, to $24.375 a share, while Bank
of New York's slipped 37.5 cents, to $31.375.</p>
