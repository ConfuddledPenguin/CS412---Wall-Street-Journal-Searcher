	<p class="article-leader">TUSTIN, Calif. -- Care Enterprises Inc., a nursing home
company that has been operating under bankruptcy-law
protection for two years, said that its reorganization plan
recently received court approval.
   Under terms of the plan, creditors holding about $75
million face amount of unsecured debt would receive 90% of
Care's equity; the rest would be retained by existing
shareholders. Care said its secured creditors, who are owed
about $32 million, would soon receive a $3 million initial
payment followed in about nine months by quarterly payments
for five years. At that time, the balance would be paid in a
lump sum.</p>
