	<p class="article-leader">SPOKANE, Wash. -- Key Tronic Corp. said it settled a
patent-infringement lawsuit brought against it by Real Time
Control PLC, London.
   Real Time filed the suit about a year ago in London,
alleging that certain Key Tronic products used in computer
keyboards infringed on Real Time patents. But Key Tronic said
the terms of the settlement allow it to make, use and sell
the product in Canada, the U.S. and Japan. "We consider it a
very favorable resolution," said David Powers, the company's
general counsel.</p>
