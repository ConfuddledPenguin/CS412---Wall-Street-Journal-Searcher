	<p class="article-leader">TORONTO -- John Kachmar resigned as president and chief
executive officer of Wharf Resources Ltd. after Goldcorp
Investments Ltd., a major shareholder, succeeded in a proxy
battle in replacing five of the eight Wharf directors with
its own nominees.
   The moves were expected following a similar shakeup a day
earlier at Goldcorp's Dickenson Mines Ltd. subsidiary, which
is Wharf's largest shareholder with a 36% stake. Goldcorp
directly owns 5% of Wharf.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Mr. Kachmar, 53 years old, said at the annual meeting that
his resignations from executive positions at both Wharf and
Dickenson were "part of an orderly and normal process." He
wouldn't elaborate. Wharf and Dickenson are gold mining
concerns based in Toronto.</p>
<p>The Wharf board later elected Robert McEwen, Wharf's
chairman, to the additional post of chief executive. Mr.
McEwen also is chairman and chief executive of Dickenson and
president of Goldcorp.</p>
<p>David Libby, previously Wharf's vice president, mining,
assumed the new titles of president and chief operating
officer. He holds similar positions at Dickenson.</p>
<p>Mr. McEwen led the proxy battle against a slate of
directors nominated by Wharf's management. Mr. McEwen said
the rival nominations were made to place more mining
engineers on the Wharf board.</p>
<p>Mr. Kachmar and Wharf's general counsel, Barry Fisher,
withdrew their own nominations to the board. Mr. Kachmar
remains a director of Dickenson.</p>
