	<p class="article-leader">First Interstate Bancorp, Los Angeles, said it is amending
a dividend reinvestment and stock repurchase plan because
arbitrage programs were causing First Interstate's stock to
dip around the time the company declares its dividend.
   The plan provides discounts to holders who want to
reinvest their dividends into purchasing stock or who want to
repurchase stock under certain conditions. First Interstate
said certain shareholders have been shorting the stock in the
period when the programs are in effect, driving down the
price so they can buy more shares and take greater advantage
of the plan's discounts.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Essentially, the bank-holding company reduced those
discounts and made certain other changes aimed at
discouraging the practice.</p>
<p>First Interstate's stock is having enough trouble without
the arbitrage problems. The bank has been hammered by a
string of huge losses.</p>
