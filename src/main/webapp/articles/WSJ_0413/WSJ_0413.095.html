	<p class="article-leader">SANTE FE, N.M. -- The New Mexico Public Service Commission
said it ordered a $2.9 million decrease in rates for Public
Service Co. of New Mexico.
   The commission said the action closes the book on three
years of deliberations involving the investment by PS New
Mexico in Palo Verde Nuclear Generating Station. This
decision is the last of three orders that have been issued by
the commission during the past year dealing with PS New
Mexico's excess capacity and investment in Palo Verde.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Originally, PS New Mexico had requested a $13.7 million
rate increase, which would have resulted in a 4.4% increase
for residential customers.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the commission authorized a $1.9 million rate
increase for El Paso Electric Co.</p>
<p>After the decision, PS New Mexico warned its shareholders
that they "will receive little or no return on their
investment over the next several years." The company said it
would evaluate "possible strategic options" and has hired an
investment banking firm to assist.</p>
