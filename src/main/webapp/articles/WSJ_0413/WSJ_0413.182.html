	<p class="article-leader">BOSTON -- BTR PLC launched a proxy fight to unseat the
board of Norton Co. and demanded it be allowed to inspect any
confidential information Norton is allowing other potential
bidders.
   BTR, a British conglomerate, nominated a slate of nine
directors for the April 26 annual meeting of Norton, which is
seeking to fend off an unsolicited $1.64 billion, or $75 a
share, bid by BTR. There are 12 directors on Norton's board,
but the board will be reduced to 11 at the meeting.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Norton, a maker of abrasives and engineering materials
based in Worcester, Mass., has said that BTR's offer is
inadequate. In demanding that BTR be allowed to review
confidential information, BTR Chief Executive John C. Cahill
said in a letter to Norton: "Ironically, at the same time
that management apparently feel it is in Norton's best
interests to ignore us . . . the board has authorized the
company to provide certain confidential information to
interested parties." It added, "The board, consistent with
its fiduciary duties, should provide us promptly with the
same confidential business and financial information."</p>
<p>Mr. Cahill reiterated that "BTR would be willing to
consider increasing its offer" if the confidential
information showed that a higher price is warranted.</p>
<p>Norton is appealing a federal court ruling requiring it to
hold its annual meeting April 26, as initially scheduled;
Norton's board had canceled the meeting and set a special
shareholders meeting for June 26 after BTR's bid was
announced. A U.S. appeals court granted an expedited hearing
of the Norton appeal of the lower court ruling.</p>
<p>A bill being considered by the Massachusetts Legislature
still could help Norton's defense, although it's unclear
whether it will be passed before the April 26 annual meeting.
The bill would require Massachusetts companies to have
staggered terms for directors, with one-third of the board
elected each year, unless the board votes otherwise. If the
bill were to take effect prior to the annual meeting, it
could prevent BTR from electing a majority to the board at
the meeting.</p>
