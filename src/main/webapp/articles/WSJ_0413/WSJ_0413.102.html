	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Crowthers McCall Pattern Inc. said it reached
a definitive agreement to be acquired by a Philadelphia
investment partnership for $45 million.
   Although the agreement advances reorganization efforts by
McCall, which has been in Chapter 11 bankruptcy-law
proceedings since December 1988, the pact leaves open the
question of how claims of creditors, who are owed $64.4
million, will be satisfied. The purchase agreement, with
Dimeling & Schreiber's MP Holdings Inc., is for all of the
assets of McCall, a maker of home-sewing patterns. McCall
intends to use the proceeds to pay for its reorganization
plan.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>An attorney for McCall creditors said the creditors expect
to make up the difference between the purchase price and the
debt through a $60 million lawsuit that is pending against
Reginald F. Lewis, an investor with a 20% equity stake in
McCall. Mr. Lewis led a group that purchased McCall Pattern
Co. in 1984 for $24.5 million. The group sold McCall for $63
million in June 1987 to an investor group controlled by John
Crowther PLC, a British textile company that was taken over
by Coloroll Group PLC.</p>
<p>In September, McCall sued Mr. Lewis and others, including
Shearson Lehman Brothers Group Inc. and a unit of Bankers
Trust New York Corp. McCall charged that Mr. Lewis's highly
leveraged purchase and sale of the company triggered its
bankruptcy-law filing. Mr. Lewis also is the subject of a
pending suit by Travelers Insurance Co., a unit of Travelers
Corp., seeking $35 million in damages from a senior note on
which Crowthers McCall defaulted in 1988.</p>
<p>As part of the agreement with MP Holdings, members of
McCall's management will acquire an equity stake, the size of
which officials didn't disclose. Bankruptcy court has
approved a breakup fee if McCall accepts a competing bid and
gives MP Holdings the right to change its offer if McCall's
receives competing bids. MP Holdings posted a $2 million
deposit.</p>
