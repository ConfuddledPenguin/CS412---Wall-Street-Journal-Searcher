	<p class="article-leader">These are days of intense reflection for much of the
Christian and Jewish population of the United States. In the
period of Passover and in the days from Holy Thursday through
Easter, it is common for men and women to measure the
profound and steadfast seriousness of these holy days against
events in the secular world. In doing so on a day such as
Good Friday, it is normal to grieve at the persistent
grimness that besets many of the world's people. It's
surprising, then, to consider how wondrously much of the
secular world has been transformed since this time last year.
More astonishing, perhaps, is how well the content of these
events -- the Berlin Wall broken, Eastern Europe freed,
democracies re-emerging -- reflects the essential message of
these holy days, which is renewal and liberation.
   It has been a long time since one could emerge from this
week's contemplative moments with cause for celebration. For
many years, for example, one could still find priests in old
Polish-American parishes who would end their Masses as they
had for 45 years -- with a firm, if seemingly hopeless appeal
for the conversion of Russia. So these old priests are a
little more hopeful than they were 12 months ago.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Ironically, the exhilarations of this sudden progress are
experienced simultaneously with continuing news of suffering
and conflict. Christians are slaughtering Christians in
Beirut. Moslems are murdering Moslems in Karachi, Pakistan.
In Peru, communist guerrillas attempt to break the will of
people who voted bravely in last Sunday's elections; in
recent days the guerrillas have hurled bombs at schools,
factories and housing projects. Yesterday, on Holy Thursday,
the government-sanctioned Russian Orthodox church accused the
Ukrainian Catholic church of fomenting "violence and
illegality." Vietnam's refugees fester in Hong Kong. In
China, with the anniversary of its democratic uprising
imminent, the government has restricted access to Tiananmen
Square. It has become China's dead ground.</p>
<p>This suffering is the traditional object of prayers and
sermons. But it would be good, we think, if among these
entreaties some mention were made of what has been
accomplished and what we have learned.</p>
<p>In the past, much human suffering has been the consequence
of the political illegitimacy of governments, the persistence
of philosophical errors such as statism, ethnic animosities
or deep and untended grievances. It is now clear that there
is an alternative to political systems that kill the spirit
and breed evil.</p>
<p>The alternative is self-determination. This is a
well-settled truth, but it has been remarkable in the past
year to watch the way self-determination works. It is as if
we have all been looking at a biology of politics regenerate.
Once born, self-determination seems to grow quickly into
discussion groups, newspapers and platform speeches, and then
spread into parties, candidates, elections and ultimately a
new government. Within months, prisoners had become
presidents and parliamentarians.</p>
<p>One of the most widely talked-about features of this
process as it unfolded in Poland, Hungary, Czechoslovakia and
East Germany is how few people have been killed. Presumably
they value their new political responsibility more highly
than retribution. That people are willing to risk much to
acquire the right of self-determination has been shown in El
Salvador, Nicaragua and Peru, where citizens braved the
threat of assault or death simply to cast a vote.</p>
<p>It is apparent that the spread of self-determination has
occurred so quickly and with such force that many of the
world's leaders are having some difficulty knowing how to
balance the competing interests of the new status quo.
Government-to-government policy-making is so much more
manageable, if by "the Soviets" one simply means a handful of
men, not the 15 Soviet Republics of 287 million citizens. Or
if "the Chinese" are four old men, instead of 1 billion
democrats.</p>
<p>But with the minds of men and women turned toward their
most firmly held beliefs this week, it is appropriate to
consider how we who have become accustomed to
self-determination can best ensure that those who have just
achieved it will keep it, and that those who want it can also
win its benefits. Spiritual and secular renewal are by no
means coincident, but both worlds surely prosper if they have
the means and freedom to coexist.</p>
