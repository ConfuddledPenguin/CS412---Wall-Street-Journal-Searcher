	<p class="article-leader">QUEBEC -- Canada's Francophone and Anglophone leaders have
about another month in which to try to cobble together a new
constitutional compromise.
   If they don't, Quebec Province returns to the limbo in
which it does not recognize the national constitution.
Failure also will reinforce a growing belief in the country's
two linguistic communities that, eventually, the province's
6.5 million mostly French speakers are going to go their
separate way. If they do, it will have a lot to do with the
growing cockiness in the French-speaking business community.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Unlike the period 10 years ago -- during which Quebeckers
voted to stay inside Canada -- this time independence is not
being preached only by politicians posing as left-wing
radicals. A small but growing part of the French-Canadian
business community has come out for leaving Canada. Perhaps
even more important, a larger part of Montreal businesses
don't regard independence as the unmitigated catastrophe they
were sure it would be in the 1970s. And the latest polls
indicate that independence has the support of 60% of
Quebeckers.</p>
<p>French-Canadian nationalism now is based as much on
economic grounds as it is on political, cultural and
psychological reasons. The nationalists say French-Canadian
entrepreneurs have proved their mettle, even in international
competition. Seventy-seven percent of Quebec's exports go
outside Canada, mostly to the U.S., and are rising at a more
rapid clip than Canada's as a whole.</p>
<p>Quebec nationalists claim that the English-speaking
companies frightened away to Toronto by Quebec terrorists
have been replaced by enterprising French-Canadian
businesses. A prime example they give is the blossoming
Quebec insurance industry that moved in behind Sun Life when
it departed for Toronto. And they say Quebec has developed a
special kind of government-private sector cooperation, with
technocrats moving back and forth between business and
government more like Washington than Ottawa.</p>
<p>They also argue that during the last four years Quebec was
a "donor" province, giving more to the federal government
than it got in return.</p>
<p>And, in a curious down-the-up-stairs analogy, Quebec
nationalists point to trade relations between Canada, the
U.S. and now, possibly, Mexico as the kind of integration
that is building the European Community. If the French,
Germans, British, etc., can get together and talk about a
common currency, why can't a viable, independent Quebec exist
parallel to a Canada that is entering a free-trade area with
the U.S.?</p>
<p>All of these rationalizations have led Quebeckers, some
other Canadians, and even Merrill Lynch (recently the lead
member of a Quebec Province Yankee bond issue), to pooh-pooh
the economic fallout from Quebec independence if it comes.
The truth is that whatever form Quebec independence takes, it
conjures up enormously complex negotiations, at least a
minimum period of instability, and new headaches for U.S.
policy makers and perhaps American businesspeople.</p>
<p>Here is only a brief menu:</p>
<p>-- Canada's national debt. It is running at about C$350
billion (about 15% higher than the U.S. debt on a per capita
basis). Perhaps Quebec simply would inherit C$90 billion of
that. Some Quebec nationalists would argue bitterly against a
simple per capita distribution, however.</p>
<p>-- Central banking and money. Unlike in the 1970s, most
Quebec nationalists argue for remaining inside the Canadian
monetary union (and here the European Community's ECU is
brought up). But the main beef of the Montreal business
community right now is the Bank of Canada's high interest
rates. They argue that they are being victimized to protect
the manufacturing sector in southern Ontario from inflation.
Francois Beaulnes, a former banker who advocates independence
as a member of the Parti Quebecois in Quebec's National
Assembly, wants to stay in, at least in a first stage. But he
calls for a "junior partner" role for an independent Quebec
in a newly constituted central bank, "and maybe a rule that
says that Canada's rates must not be more than 2% above the
Fed's."</p>
<p>-- Federal assets. Quebec would take over the post and
telegraph and other federal properties. But there are
problems: Quebec's northern territories are disputed with the
federal government. Its boundary with Newfoundland -- a
province that now is holding up approval of the latest
attempt to paper over differences between Quebec and Ottawa
-- is in dispute. And Hydro Quebec buys some 20% of its power
(at bargain rates) from Newfoundland's Labrador, which it
then resells to the U.S.</p>
<p>-- Free Trade Agreement. Quebec's business community and
the pro-independence politicians were among the strongest
supporters of the agreement to eventually wipe out all
restrictions with the U.S. But if, and when, the U.S. gets
down to business on the problem of subsidies, Quebec (perhaps
the most "dirigiste" government in North America) may sweat.
Take the provincial government's Caisse de Depot et
Deplacement -- the huge kitty composed of retirement funds of
government workers. Its C$30-plus billion has been used very
effectively by politicians to favor French-Canadian
businessmen, including the takeover of Steinberg's, and its
U.S. holdings, including A&P.</p>
<p>In all these complexities, one point is increasingly
clear: There is a growing consensus in Quebec that there must
be some resolution of the continuing crisis brought on by two
decades of agitation for separation. Premier Robert Bourassa,
until recently a strong opponent of independence, in January
slid over toward his opponents when he suggested some new
form of "association" among Canada's provinces. Meanwhile,
Jacques Parizeau, leader of the opposition Parti Quebecois,
now talks of another referendum.</p>
<p>Among English speakers there is a sense of betrayal that
former Prime Minister Pierre Elliot Trudeau's national
bilingualism has not been the solution he promised, and a
belief that Quebec keeps upping the ante in negotiations for
a revised federal structure.</p>
<p>Yet Quebec already is paying a price for its nationalism.
Province-owned Hydro Quebec bonds now yield about 30 basis
points over Ontario Hydro, up 20 points, marking growing
worries about instability. Pierre S. Pettigrew of the
brokerage house Samson Belari International Inc., a former
aide to a Quebec premier and an opponent of independence,
says: "What I really wish is that we could get on with the
economic challenges of the 1990s, the real problems of
productivity and competitiveness that all of Canada has to
face, instead of these problems of our past."</p>
<p>If Quebec independence really comes, Washington also may
be blamed by many Anglophones for encouraging Quebec
separatism through the Free Trade Act. The U.S. then may find
itself embroiled in complex legalities of splitting up the
pie instead of working at the very real problems of expanding
trade, productivity and security cooperation with our
northern neighbors.</p>
