	<p class="article-leader">SEOUL, South Korea -- South Korea's Export-Import Bank
plans to float 105 million European currency units ($126.9
million) of Eurobonds in May or June, bank officials said,
but declined to discuss terms for the issue, designed to
secure funds to help finance South Korean exports.
   The issue is subject to approval by the Finance Ministry,
which the officials said was expected soon.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The state-run Korea Development Bank also was reported to
be preparing to float foreign currency-denominated bonds for
a total of as much as $500 million in several issues in the
second half. Officials said the bank hasn't worked out a
schedule for the proposed issues. They didn't specify the
countries in which the bonds will be issued. The National
Assembly authorized the bonds to obtain lending funds to
finance South Korean enterprises' investment in manufacturing
production facilities.</p>
<p>The government recently eased curbs on issuing bonds
overseas.</p>
