	<p class="article-leader">SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico -- Carlos Romero Barcelo often flies
to Washington to argue that Puerto Rico should become the
51st state.
   Thousands of Puerto Ricans "have bled for their country,"
he told a Senate committee last year. For example, a young
Puerto Rican pilot was killed in the 1986 bombing raid on
Libya, he said, yet the pilot's mother has no right to vote
for the president who ordered the raid because she lives in
Puerto Rico.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>In Juncos, a hurricane-beaten town half an hour from here,
an excited crowd gathers to hear Mr. Romero Barcelo, a former
governor of Puerto Rico, preach his statehood message with a
different emphasis. To the triumphant strains of the theme
from "Rocky," he bounces onto a makeshift stage and
enumerates statehood's potential benefits:</p>
<p>A person who now receives a $90 monthly check for food
assistance would receive more than $130. Aid to families with
dependent children would more than double to $200 a month.
And, since a majority of Puerto Ricans make too little to pay
federal income tax, "just for filling out the income-tax
form, many people will get $910 back," the Yale-educated Mr.
Romero Barcelo says. Almost overcome by emotion, Juan
Hernandez, a retired accountant, shouts from the audience:
"If we were a state, billions of dollars would roll down the
street."</p>
<p>What is surprising in these days of U.S. budget deficits
is that Washington's biggest proponent of sending those
dollars rolling Puerto Rico's way is President Bush. (Just
last week, a study released by the Congressional Budget
Office said that under statehood, payments to Puerto Rico
under U.S. entitlement programs would increase by $1.7
billion in 1992.)</p>
<p>To the dismay of U.S. corporations here, Mr. Bush is
aligned with Mr. Romero Barcelo. It was Mr. Bush, a statehood
supporter since his days as ambassador to the United Nations,
who surprised everyone earlier last year by the last-minute
insertion of a plea for statehood in an address he read to
Congress. For President Bush, says Andrew Card, the White
House's assistant chief of staff, the debate about economics,
taxes and welfare is not the point. "It's more a
human-rights, a civil-rights issue," says Mr. Card.</p>
<p>The issue of Puerto Rico's status is once again red hot
here. Legislation moving through Congress would set a 1991
referendum on the island's future, giving voters a choice
among statehood, a version of the present commonwealth system
or independence. The issue has always deeply divided Puerto
Rico. But now the tide of statehood is slowly rising.</p>
<p>Sooner or later, the island will be knocking at Congress's
door. The question then will be: Is the U.S. ready to accept
as a state what is in essence a Latin American country --
densely populated, Spanish-speaking, culturally different and
poor?</p>
<p>In Washington, where few are paying close attention, even
fewer think Congress will act on the referendum bill this
year. But here the status question is an obsession. Not much
is heard about the principles of justice, democracy or
patriotism Mr. Romero Barcelo elaborated on before Congress.
Instead, the most talked-about question is money and who is
going to get it -- individuals or corporations.</p>
<p>Statehood advocates, for the first time in history ahead
of commonwealthers in the polls, promise a welfare bonanza.
They say the more than 50% of Puerto Rico's families that
receive money for food and other welfare assistance would get
a $2.3 billion yearly windfall.</p>
<p>Opponents of statehood -- including a Who's Who of big
multinationals that, although officially neutral, lobby
vigorously behind the scenes in Washington -- say statehood
would mean the end of what has been a corporate gold mine. It
would cost about 400 U.S. companies here federal tax
exemptions valued at about $1.9 billion, and that in turn
would mean a corporate exodus costing the island many of the
300,000 direct and indirect jobs the companies provide.</p>
<p>Like the statehooders, Gov. Rafael Hernandez Colon, the
chief of the pro-commonwealth forces, seeks a richer piece of
cake. He wants broadened powers for the commonwealth -- for
instance, the right not to apply certain federal laws to
Puerto Rico -- and more federal aid.</p>
<p>Mr. Hernandez Colon says his party probably won't go along
with the plebiscite unless the commonwealth option is assured
the same welfare payments available under statehood. He's
against paying federal taxes. The governor doesn't see any
problem with this, but Congress does.</p>
<p>The independentistas, a tiny minority who get only about
5% of the vote in gubernatorial elections, propose dual
Puerto Rican-U.S. citizenship for islanders born before
independence is granted.</p>
<p>The debate is illuminating the complex relationship that
ties the U.S. and Puerto Rico, which the U.S. seized at the
end of the Spanish-American War in 1898. Puerto Ricans,
citizens since 1917, have fought in all U.S. wars beginning
with World War I. Yet, they can't vote for president, and are
represented in Congress by a resident commissioner in the
House who votes in committee but not on the floor. They pay
no federal income taxes, but receive most federal benefits.
(Federal transfer payments make up 31% of an average Puerto
Rican's individual income. That's twice as high as the figure
for mainland citizens.) Most Puerto Ricans have relatives in
the U.S, and more than two million are in the U.S.</p>
<p>The island, with a population of 3.3 million, has a
per-capita income of $5,653, about half that of Mississippi,
the poorest state. But thanks to the U.S. factories lured
here by the tax-exemption program and the welfare
entitlements, the island, whose poverty once rivaled Haiti's,
is Fat City by Latin American and Caribbean standards.</p>
<p>Last year, Puerto Rico imported about $9.4 billion of U.S.
goods and exported $14.2 billion to the mainland. And among
other measures of wealth, it boasts one of the largest and
most-profitable shopping malls in the U.S. (The J.C. Penney
Co. store at the Plaza Las Americas mall chalked up sales
last year of more than $70 million and is the 1,700-store
chain's most-profitable location.)</p>
<p>Most Puerto Ricans agree that if it weren't for the U.S.
connection, the island, crowded and resource-poor, would be
locked into extreme poverty. "Puerto Ricans hang onto the
U.S. like a drowning man to a life preserver," says Alex
Maldonado, a political analyst here.</p>
<p>Almost to a man, the island's cultural and intellectual
elite are independentistas. But for the vast majority of the
population, independence is a dirty word.</p>
<p>Antonio Colorado, the commonwealth government's
development chief, worries about what life would be like if
statehood wins and the federal tax exemption, known as
Section 936, is repealed. He paints a grim picture --
unemployment could jump to 35% from the present 14% (low for
Puerto Rico), pushing one million Puerto Ricans to emigrate
to the U.S. in search of work.</p>
<p>Last week's Congressional Budget Office study said a
phase-out of Section 936 would hurt the island's development
and eliminate as many as 100,000 jobs by the year 2000. "The
economic situation in Puerto Rico would be black without
936," says Narmo Ortiz, the head of government relations for
American Cyanamid Co.'s Puerto Rico unit.</p>
<p>Beyond the dollars and cents of the status debate,
cultural issues are involved. Commonwealthers and
independentistas worry that statehood would spell the end of
Puerto Rico's distinct culture. "The question is, are people
ready to push the button that will spell the end of one of
the nationalities on the planet?" says Sen. Marco Rigau.</p>
<p>As it is, the island's culture already has been bent out
of shape by its close encounter with the U.S. Sometimes the
cultural clash takes on an absurdist tone. Luis Rafael
Sanchez, a Puerto Rican writer, remembers that in 1952 the
mayor of San Juan brought a planeload of snow to Puerto Rico
so the island's poor children could see snow first hand.</p>
<p>The snow, gathered by children in New Hampshire, was met
with great fanfare and escorted to a sports stadium. There,
children bused from the city's meanest slums made snowmen,
which in the hot Caribbean sun melted in the twinkling of an
eye.</p>
