	<p class="article-leader">SANTA CLARA, Calif. -- Intel Corp. reported that
first-quarter net income surged 48% to $144 million, or 73
cents a share, despite a prolonged slump that has hurt the
semiconductor industry.
   The results topped Intel's projection of two weeks ago,
when the company predicted it would earn about $130 million.
In the year-ago quarter, Intel had profit of $97 million, or
52 cents a share.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Revenue rose 25% to $894 million from $713 million.</p>
<p>The results were the latest in a string of strong
performances by Intel, particularly in light of industrywide
woes caused by Japanese competition and problems in some
basic fields served by chip makers, such as the automobile
industry. Recently, chip makers such as Advanced Micro
Devices Inc. have had losses or profit declines because of
the slump.</p>
<p>But Intel rolls on, primarily because of demand for its
latest microprocessor chips, used in many of today's personal
computers. Intel hasn't been able to keep up with demand for
its 80386 chip, causing shortages the company expects to last
into the second quarter. Its 80486 chip also is popular. Both
chips rely on what's known as "32-bit architecture," a chip
design that speeds up computing.</p>
<p>"The transition to 32-bit architecture has picked up
momentum in the past six months," said Andrew S. Grove,
president and chief executive officer. He said first-quarter
80386 chip shipments doubled from year-earlier levels.
"Further growth is expected in the second quarter," Mr. Grove
said.</p>
<p>An Intel spokesman said the results beat the company's
earlier projection because the company sold more
microprocessor chips, which have higher margins than its
other products.</p>
<p>In over-the-counter trading yesterday, Intel closed at
$42.50, down 25 cents.</p>
