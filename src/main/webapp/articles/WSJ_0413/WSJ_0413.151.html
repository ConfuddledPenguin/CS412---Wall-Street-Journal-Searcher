	<p class="article-leader">Par Pharmaceutical Inc. said it reached agreement with its
majority-owned subsidiary, Quad Pharmaceuticals Inc., to buy
out Quad management's 40% interest in the unit.
   Terms weren't disclosed.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Par, a Spring Valley, N.Y., genericdrug manufacturer under
federal investigation, said the transaction, which is subject
to a definitive agreement and approval by boards of both
companies, would result in Quad being wholly owned by Par.</p>
<p>In addition, Par said senior managers at
Indianapolis-based Quad, who are now on leaves of absence,
would resign once the transaction closes. Quad is currently
being operated by Par management.</p>
<p>Officials of both companies couldn't be reached for
comment.</p>
<p>In late March, Par said Quad had halted distribution of
all products subject to federal approval. That action, which
concerned findings the company might have made product
changes without following appropriate regulatory notification
or approval processes, came after Quad had recalled other
products.</p>
