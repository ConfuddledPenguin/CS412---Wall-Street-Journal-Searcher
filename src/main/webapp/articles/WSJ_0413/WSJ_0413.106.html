	<p class="article-leader">Former West Virginia Gov. Arch A. Moore Jr. agreed to
plead guilty to charges of extortion, obstruction of justice,
and tax and mail fraud in a scheme to extort money from a
coal operator and buy votes.
   Mr. Moore, 66 years old, faces up to 36 years in prison
and fines of as much as $1.2 million, said Larry Ellis, an
assistant U.S. attorney for the Southern District of West
Virginia. A sentencing date hasn't been set.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Yesterday's five-count indictment by a Charleston grand
jury accused Mr. Moore, a three-time Republican governor of
the predominantly Democratic state, of illegal activities
while campaigning and serving as governor.</p>
<p>John Campbell, an investigator with the Justice
Department, called the case unprecedented. "We know of no
other case of similar significance in election-related
crimes," he said.</p>
<p>In a prepared statement, Mr. Moore said: "This news will
be greeted with a great joy by some in the state of West
Virginia. There will be others who will be sincerely grieved
by reason of their devotion to me and my family. I know I
have their understanding and love. For that, I shall be
forever grateful."</p>
<p>This is the second time Mr. Moore was indicted for
campaign-related wrongdoings. He was charged and then
acquitted in an alleged 1972 scheme to extort money from a
Charleston savings and loan institution.</p>
<p>The latest indictments accuse Mr. Moore of illegally
diverting $100,000 in state funds to his 1984 election
campaign, which his supporters paid to voters in southern
West Virginia counties.</p>
<p>The extortion charge relates to a scheme in which he
agreed to use his influence as governor to refund $2.3
million from the state's black-lung fund to H. Paul Kizer,
owner of Maben Energy Corp. of Beckley, W.Va. Mr. Kizer,
whose concern is one of the state's top coal producers,
agreed to offer Mr. Moore 25% of the refund as kickbacks, the
indictment says. The black-lung fund is a coal
industry-funded pool of money that provides payments to
disabled miners who suffer from the disease.</p>
<p>Charleston attorney James Lees, who represents Mr. Kizer,
said his client was "a victim of extortion." Mr. Kizer hasn't
been charged, Mr. Ellis said.</p>
<p>The former governor is also charged with filing false
campaign finance statements and tax returns in 1984 and 1985.
In 1984, he allegedly failed to report contributions by a
lobbyist, Samuel D'Annunzio, and an unidentified agent
representing Island Creek Coal, a unit of Occidental
Petroleum Corp. In Lexington, Ky., a spokeswoman for Island
Creek said the company isn't aware of any payment that was
made on its behalf to Mr. Moore.</p>
<p>Mr. D'Annunzio, a former president of the West Virginia
Beer Wholesalers Association, committed suicide in 1988.</p>
<p>In the 1985 tax return, Mr. Moore allegedly failed to
report contributions from Marrowbone Development Co., a West
Virginia coal company. Several Marrowbone officials have
previously been convicted of tax and fraud felonies in an
investigation of Mingo County corruption. That investigation
led officials from the U.S. Justice Department and U.S.
attorney's office to Gov. Moore, Mr. Ellis said.</p>
<p>The obstruction-of-justice charge relates to Mr. Moore's
alleged attempts to influence the testimony of two witnesses,
Mr. Kizer and John F. Leaberry, Mr. Moore's 1988 campaign
manager, during the investigation.</p>
<p>Mr. Moore served three, four-year terms before he was
defeated in 1988 by a wide margin by current Democratic Gov.
Gaston Caperton.</p>
