	<p class="article-leader">AMSTERDAM, the Netherlands -- Elsevier N.V.'s chairman,
Pierre Vinken, said the Dutch publisher still regards a
merger with Pearson PLC as a long-term goal.
   Mr. Vinken also indicated that Elsevier, an
Amsterdam-based publisher of scientific journals, trade
publications and newspapers, is likely to show strong profit
growth again this year.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Elsevier and Pearson, which is based in London and owns
the Financial Times, announced an alliance in September 1988,
saying they might eventually merge. Last week, however, the
two companies confirmed that the idea of a merger had been
shelved.</p>
<p>Even so, Mr. Vinken emphasized in an interview this week
that the two companies remain "a happy, engaged couple,"
adding that they are looking "for ways to tie these companies
together, rather than to divorce them." For its part, Pearson
said recently that it still regards Elsevier as "our
long-term European partner."</p>
<p>Pearson owns about 23% of Elsevier, and the Dutch company
holds 9.3% of Pearson.</p>
<p>Mr. Vinken said merger considerations had been blocked at
least temporarily by "enormous technical problems." For
example, he said, a merger would give rise to huge
capital-gains taxes in Britain.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, a drop in the pound's value and a surge in
Elsevier's share price over the past two years has made the
Dutch company prohibitively expensive for Pearson, the two
companies have said. When the alliance was announced in 1988,
Pearson's market value was nearly twice that of Elsevier. Now
Elsevier is valued on the stock market at the equivalent of
about $2.7 billion and Pearson at around $2.9 billion, partly
reflecting the market's view that Pearson is no longer a
likely takeover target.</p>
<p>Another worry for the two companies is that a bid for
Elsevier from Pearson effectively would put the Dutch company
on the block, opening the way for a third party to make a
higher offer.</p>
<p>Thus, Mr. Vinken said, the two will need to seek
"creative" solutions in their effort to forge closer ties.
For the moment, he added, they are seeking ways to combine
their medical-publishing operations and are considering joint
acquisitions. The companies are particularly interested in
acquiring leading financial newspapers in European countries,
but none are on the market at present, Mr. Vinken said.</p>
