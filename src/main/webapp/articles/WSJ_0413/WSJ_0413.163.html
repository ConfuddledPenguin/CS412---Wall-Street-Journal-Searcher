	<p class="article-leader">GORBACHEV'S ECONOMIC proposals could free 70% of the
Soviet economy from state control, slash central planning and
raise most prices an average 100%, according to a key
adviser, Pavel Bunich. But the economist cautioned that the
plan still has many murky areas and isn't final.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The economic reforms may face strong opposition from the
Soviet public, especially if there is mass unemployment and
big price increases for basic goods, as economists expect.</p>

<p>Retail sales fell 0.6% in March, the first two-month
decline in over three years. Still, economists said retailers
are better off than the figures imply. Auto sales remained
weak, but most other sectors had minor declines.</p>
<p>Several mall retailers reported better-than-expected sales
last month, even though the Easter holiday season is in April
this year.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>Stock prices climbed, aided by a big buy program and an
upbeat earnings outlook for IBM. The Dow Jones industrials
closed up 22.07, at 2751.80. Bond prices eased in a shortened
pre-holiday session. The dollar rose.</p>
<p>World oil markets calmed, if only briefly, as OPEC
ministers tried to push up prices with talk they are
considering an emergency meeting.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>The SEC is expected next week to waive disclosure rules
for stock and bond offerings that are sold privately to big
institutions. The change could swell the $165 billion U.S.
market for privately placed securities.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>Household International debt totaling $9.5 billion was
placed under review by Moody's for possible downgrade, partly
due to concerns about the firm's real-estate holdings.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>Chase Manhattan is plunging into one of Wall Street's most
tarnished businesses: limited partnerships. The No. 2 bank,
putting its reputation on the line, plans to begin offering
public partnerships later this year.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>Brazil's anti-inflation plan was largely backed by the
country's Congress. But President Collor faces a more
difficult task of implementing the measures without
triggering a recession or reigniting inflation.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>Major tuna canners said they will stop buying and selling
tuna captured along with dolphins, a move long sought by
environmentalists. The move was led by Heinz's Starkist unit,
the world's biggest tuna canner.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>Winnebago Industries ousted another chief executive and
again named chairman and founder John Hanson to run the
motor-home maker. The latest shuffle comes amid signs of
growing problems at the company.</p>

<p>Hallmark's sweetened buy-back offer for $270 million of
its Univision unit's junk bonds was accepted by most
bondholders, averting a threatened Chapter 11 filing by
Univision.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>Japan's trade surplus grew 7.2% in March, the first
increase in 11 months. But the gain was mainly due to
one-time factors, analysts said. Japan's trade surplus with
the U.S. shrank 5.9% during the month.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>Chemical Bank's profit rose 29% in the first quarter,
reflecting reductions in costs and loan-loss provisions. Bank
of New York posted a 1.3% gain despite higher loss
provisions.</p>

financial troubles.</p>
