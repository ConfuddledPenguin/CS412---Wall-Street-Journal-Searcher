	<p class="article-leader">CAMBRIDGE, Mass. -- With my goggles and headphones
securely in place, I settle back into my chair and prepare
for the journey. I'm hooked up to a machine that is
bombarding my eyeballs with kaleidoscopic lights and my
eardrums with static. Billed as a sort of submarine of the
subconscious, the machine is supposed to help me run silent
and deep to the fertile inner canyons of my mind.
   Destination: the Zone.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"Words will become as friendly as they were to Hemingway"
once I've achieved the trance-like state of mind called the
Zone. My brain waves will resonate in sync with the planet.
Creative thoughts will bloom profusely. Or, at least, so says
my mind coach here at the Visconti 2000 Mind/Brain Fitness
Center.</p>
<p>Eager to think loftier thoughts, get better grades or
write best sellers, people are flocking to mind gyms such as
this one to plug themselves in to mind-stimulating machines.
They are "pioneers ushering in the New Age," says owner
Maryellen Krygowski-Visconti. "When you have access to your
creativity, it's like finding a hot-fudge sundae stand on a
Tuesday."</p>
<p>Such are the dreams of Jerome Edwards. A 24-year-old
railway clerk who is engaged to be married, he confesses "I
spend way too much time on my triceps and not enough on my
concepts." But he has vowed to reform. "I want the married
Mr. Edwards to be a new man," he declares. "He can't be
slothful or a drag. He must be well-read, mentally fit and
interesting as heck."</p>
<p>No sweat. Mr. Edwards stretches out comfortably on a
lounge chair and dons earphones and goggles. He flicks on the
MC Square, a light-and-sound machine similar to the Digital
Audio Video Integrated Device, the one I'm on, which is
called the David for short.</p>
<p>A half-hour later, he doesn't seem quite convinced he has
been transformed. "I feel mentally relaxed," he says, "but
not mentally energized." The Visconti's coaches counsel
patience: The benefits of a mental workout often may not be
evident for hours, or even days.</p>
<p>Most mainstream scientists put mind-stimulating machines
in the same category as miracle hair growers and bust
enhancing creams. "I think you can get smarter," says James
McGaugh, a brain researcher at the University of California
in Irvine, "through a little-used device called hard work."</p>
<p>Mrs. Visconti, the gym's owner, doesn't dispute the value
of hard work. But she firmly believes that mental performance
can be enhanced with the aid of machines. Every night, she
dons headphones and listens to self-improvement tapes as she
sleeps. One of her favorites is a tape on dream programming
which she says helps her pick dream topics and visualize
solutions to problems, such as the gym's decor. It was a
breakthrough, she says: minimalist. Black furniture, white
walls.</p>
<p>Trained as a nutritionist, Mrs. Visconti, 57, is the
author, and co-author, of several cookbooks, including The
Sensuous Salad and a collection of recipes based on A-1
Sauce. In the early 1980s, she began devoting more and more
of her time to the study of the mind, taking seminars and
reading scientific journals. Without any formal training in
the field of psychology, she began giving lectures and
seminars in creative thinking.</p>
<p>Polaroid Corp., the camera manufacturer, is considering
offering one of her seminars to its engineers. Says Walter
Chadwick, Polaroid's chief engineer: "Sometimes the
traditional methods of getting the creative juices going just
seem to come up dry."</p>
<p>Mrs. Visconti's vision of a mind gym was born a few months
ago during one of her workshops. And, with $5,000 she had
saved from writing recipes for magazines and food concerns,
she opened the gym in an upscale shopping mall, the
Cottonwood Porter Exchange, in November. Her gym is one of a
small but growing number of such outlets that offer
brain-boosting services or products.</p>
<p>Mrs. Visconti's limited budget hasn't allowed for
advertising, but it hasn't been all that necessary, either.
Curious passers-by often wander into the gym, ask a few
questions, and end up staying for hours. Rarely does she
manage to shut the doors at the gym's scheduled closing time
of 7 p.m. "I am amazed," she says, "at the turnout."</p>
<p>Mark Rossi, a 40-year-old stand-up comic from Boston, is a
regular. He says he was skeptical until he took a
standardized personality evaluation for $125. Among other
things, it suggested, correctly as it turns out, that he had
an unbalanced checkbook. Workouts help him write better
jokes, he says.</p>
<p>Victoria Hackett, a 25-year-old nursery school teacher who
is going back to graduate school, says she hopes her workouts
will help her be a better student. "When I think of graduate
school, I get scared," she says. "Will I get C's and D's all
over again like I did in college? That to me is frightening."</p>
<p>In five months, the gym, which is open six days a week,
has taken in revenue of about $30,000. (A half-hour session
on a mind-stimulating machine runs about $20.) Mrs. Visconti
has pumped most of the money into new equipment.</p>
<p>In addition to the $700 MC Square and the $3,000 David,
there's the Ideafischer, a sort of computerized idea
thesaurus, and the Mind's Eye, another light-and-sound
machine which offers a choice of noises: rainfall on a
thatched roof, rainfall on a sidewalk, electric power lines,
glaciers. Similar, though less sophisticated machines can be
purchased through catalogs for people who want to experience
inspiration by the jolt in the privacy of their homes.</p>
<p>At the Visconti 2000 Mind/Brain Fitness Center, the $8,000
Lumitron is especially popular. Users slide their heads and
shoulders into a white canvas bag and cinch it under the
armpits. What's inside looks like a television screen, and it
can be programmed to display a variety of colors from
throbbing red to violet. The red is supposed to excite the
brain; the violet is said to relax it. The machine's design
supposedly is based on theories that have grown up after
years of research by psychologists into the effect of color
on human behavior.</p>
<p>Kathy Noonan, a thirtyish special education teacher, is
here to take the violet cure. She says she can speed read
professional journals, "but give me a nice juicy novel and
I'm asleep in five minutes."</p>
<p>Over the last few months, she has spent a total of $500 on
sessions on the Lumitron. The workouts, she says, have given
her "inner core a sense of fluidity." (Translation: She feels
more relaxed.) She sees further evidence of her progress.
"The other day," she says, "I actually went down to the
library and came out with an armful of trashy novels."</p>
<p>Mrs. Visconti has several assistants she calls "mind
coaches." Like the bronzed jocks who put new recruits through
their paces at health clubs, these coaches show patrons how
to use the machines. My coach is Eli Goodman, who also works
as a substance-abuse counselor for a local health-care
agency. He warns me that many people are worrisomely close to
a mental meltdown.</p>
<p>"The circuits of our synapses run the danger of shorting
out," he says. "Our neuro-transmitters are on emergency
alert."</p>
<p>Like Mrs. Visconti, he believes workouts can boost
creativity and relieve stress. A few sessions on the David
and I could write like a Hemingway, he says. What aspiring
scribe could resist that?</p>
<p>So here we sit, buzzing our brains with sound and light.
Ten minutes into the journey, Mr. Goodman says he has reached
the Zone. But I'm still full of questions, which suggests I'm
nowhere near the place. "You're fighting the machine," Mr.
Goodman advises. "Just go with the flow."</p>
<p>The journey ends a short while later. Mr. Goodman is
serene, I am disappointed. Creatively speaking, Papa didn't
bag any big game on this trip.</p>
