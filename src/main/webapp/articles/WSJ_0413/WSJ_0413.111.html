	<p class="article-leader">Toyota Motor has selected OMON, a tiny New York agency
staffed by Australian creative executives, to develop a
corporate-image campaign.
   The account, which will bill about $10 million this year,
is a big victory for OMON, which beat out several larger
agencies for the business, including Saatchi & Saatchi.
OMON's parent agency in Australia is well regarded there, but
the New York office opened only a year ago and has only about
15 employees.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>OMON and Toyota, which has never done image advertising in
the U.S., declined to comment on the new campaign. Executives
close to Toyota said the auto maker is interested in, among
other things, promoting its record as a large employer of
Americans to gain favor with U.S. consumers. The campaign
will begin next month.</p>
<p>The other agencies that bid for the account were Ingalls,
Quinn & Johnson in Boston and Saatchi & Saatchi DFS/Pacific,
Toyota's main agency, which created the long-running "I Love
What You Do For Me" campaign.</p>
<p>OMON has announced only a few small business wins since it
opened. But earlier this year it scored a quiet coup when
Philip Morris invited it to pitch the $60 million Benson &
Hedges account in competition with four much larger agencies.
Philip Morris wound up retaining the account at Wells, Rich,
Greene, but OMON walked away with a significant consolation
prize that it didn't announce: the ad assignment for a new
cigarette brand.</p>
<p>In an interview last year, OMON executives said the agency
plans to hire some U.S. staffers, but said the creative
department would be led by Australians. Its co-creative
directors, George Betsis and Rodd Martin, opened the office
last April after holding the top creative spots at Mojo's New
York office.</p>
<p>But it is Joanne M. Davis, a former Wells Rich executive
tapped by OMON last June to be president, who is credited
with bringing in high-profile clients, industry executives
said. As head of new-business development at Wells Rich, she
led teams that helped win major business from International
Business Machines and MCI.</p>
<p>Executives say Ms. Davis and her colleagues have worked to
make the shop's Australian heritage a point of difference
from other agencies. It's not a conventional Madison Avenue
agency: At its arty headquarters in Manhattan's SoHo
district, staffers answer the phone with a rousing "It's a
great day at OMON]" greeting.</p>
<p>Shortly after it opened, OMON began a hunt for new
business by sending selected companies copies of their ads
that OMON judged to be of poor quality -- along with a note
about why they should hire OMON. On each ad, the agency
slapped a sticker with the headline, "It's quite possible
that we're the only ones who noticed this ad." Some
advertising people criticized the approach as brash, but
others commended the shop for taking a gutsy stand.</p>
<p>"They're not going to be the agency for everybody," said
Leslie Winthrop, president of Advertising Agency Register,
which helps clients with ad agency searches. "But I think
they'll probably bring opinions and ideas {to clients} that
haven't been done here. They're not suffering from the
Made-in-the-USA syndrome."</p>

<p>Chrysler Safety Campaign</p>
<p>Chrysler is launching an ad campaign that uses actual
crash survivors to endorse the company's air-bag-equipped
cars.</p>
<p>The campaign is the most aggressive step yet in the No. 3
U.S. auto maker's effort to make a marketing plus of
outfitting all its 1990-model U.S.-made cars with air bags.
Chrysler's campaign is unusual because it features
testimonials from customers who have survived wrecks. It even
shows pictures of smashed-up cars to dramatize the benefits
of air bags.</p>
<p>In one of the new television spots, Karen McGowan of
Columbia, Md., declares: "A Chrysler air bag saved my life."
Chrysler Chairman Lee A. Iacocca appears with her and says:
"I could give you a dozen reasons why you should consider a
Chrysler product. But today I'll give you just one: Karen
McGowan."</p>
<p>The television and print ads will continue the "Advantage:
Chrysler" theme begun earlier this year by pointing out that
a greater share of Chrysler cars come with standard air bags
than any major Japanese car maker. Bozell created the new
ads.</p>

<p>Ad Notes. . . .</p>
<p>WHO'S NEWS: Jack Taylor and Gene Case were named vice
chairmen at Jordan, McGrath, Case & Taylor. They were
executive vice presidents. The agency also appointed eight
executive vice presidents: Stephen Badenhop, Alice Bond, Tom
Finneran, Bruce Guidotti, Mark Itkowitz, Alex Ross, Ilon
Specht and Don Weir.

<p>LIFE MAGAZINE: In observance of Earth Day, Life Magazine's
May issue will drop its trademark red logo for a special
version in green. It's only the second time Life has changed
the logo's color for a cover. In 1963 after the death of
President Kennedy, the magazine ran a black logo.</p>
