	<p class="article-leader">TAIPEI, Taiwan -- Taiwan's booming economy shows signs of
a slowdown that could help cool off rampant stock and real
estate speculation and boost slackened industrial production,
officials said.
   But economists warned of an economic recession if the
government fails to take quick measures to stop an exodus of
industries hit by Taiwan's soaring wages, crime and
anti-pollution protests.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"The slowdown offers us a good chance to make many
economic and social adjustments," said Chang Hsiu Lien,
deputy director of the government Council for Economic
Planning and Development.</p>
<p>Taiwan's trade surplus in the first quarter dropped 34.6%
from a year earlier. The index of manufacturing industries'
output in the first two months declined 3% from a year
earlier.</p>
<p>An Economic Ministry forecast put the 1990 trade surplus
at US$7 billion, down sharply from last year's record $14
billion.</p>
<p>Mr. Chang said the surplus reduction could help ease
inflationary pressures and stabilize the Taiwan dollar, which
has appreciated more than 50% since 1986 under pressure from
the U.S. to reduce Taiwan's trade surpluses.</p>
<p>Officials also said they expect that the rampant stock
speculation of the past two years could ease.</p>
<p>The stock market index has already dropped about 20% in
the past two months to the 10,000-point level. The index
soared from 1,000 points in 1986 to 12,000 late last year, as
cash-rich Taiwanese rushed to make easy money from the
market.</p>
<p>Soaring land prices could cool off and make it easier for
industries to acquire land for new projects, officials said.</p>
<p>Officials hope that several important public projects,
including a Taipei mass-transit system and construction of
freeways that were delayed because of soaring land prices and
labor shortages, could be renewed and give the economy a
boost.</p>
<p>But economists said the 1990 economic growth rate could
fall below 5%, compared with a government-projected 7%.</p>
<p>"If things do not improve, we can even expect a recession
in a year or two," said Chen Wen Lan, an economist at the
Chunghwa Institute for Economic Research.</p>
<p>The deteriorating investment climate has triggered an
unprecedented exodus of industries.</p>
<p>Economists said the overseas relocation of labor-intensive
industries, such as footwear and textiles, could foster the
transition to high-technology industries that are pivotal to
Taiwan's future development. But they fear that other
industries, such as electronics and petrochemicals, also may
follow suit.</p>
