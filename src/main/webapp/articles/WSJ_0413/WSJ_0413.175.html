	<p class="article-leader">RIO DE JANEIRO -- Hughes Aircraft Co., in partnership with
Brazil's Promon Engenharia S.A., won a contract to supply
Brazil with a new generation of telecommunications
satellites, according to Telebras, the state
telecommunications company. Hughes Aircraft is a subsidiary
of General Motors Corp.
   McDonnell Douglas Corp. was defeated by France's
Arianespace in a separate bid to launch the two satellites,
Telebras said.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The two contracts have a combined value of $244.3 million
-- $155.5 million for the satellites and $88.8 million for
the launchers, Telebras added.</p>
<p>The awarding of the contracts caps over one year of
international lobbying, high-level diplomacy and internal
political disputes. The dispute became so fierce that there
was speculation that Brazil would simply reopen the bidding
rather than make a decision -- raising fears that the
country's telecommunications system could collapse.</p>
<p>The fight centered on who would supply Brazil with two
second-generation satellites having both civil
telecommunications and military applications.</p>
<p>To win the satellite contract, Hughes outbid a consortium
formed by Canada's Spar Aerospace, France's Matra S.A. and
Brazil's Victori International. While Hughes's price was
lower than the consortium's final offer, opponents said they
offered more generous technology transfer conditions.</p>
<p>The previous government avoided a decision and passed the
problem to the newly installed government of President
Fernando Collor de Mello.</p>
<p>In bidding for the launchers, Arianespace offered to sell
Brazil technology to produce large rocket engines. The U.S.
government asked France to provide assurances that these
engines would be used for peaceful purposes. Brazil said it
was interested in the engines to develop an independent space
business. McDonnell Douglas said that U.S. laws on technology
transfer barred it from matching Arianespace's offer.</p>
