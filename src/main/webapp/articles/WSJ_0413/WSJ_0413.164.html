	<p class="article-leader">Torchmark Corp. won the latest round in its fight to
acquire rival American General Corp. when a federal appeals
court stayed a preliminary injunction against Torchmark's
soliciting of proxies to elect a slate of directors to
American General's board.
   The Birmingham, Ala.-based insurer said it was pleased
with the ruling and intends to proceed with the solicitation
as soon as possible.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The latest ruling is an about-face from one last week in
which federal Judge David Hittner sided with Houston-based
American General. The company argued that Torchmark failed to
notify American General of its plans 60 days in advance of
the May 2 annual meeting as required by American General
bylaws.</p>
<p>Despite Judge Hittner's ruling, Torchmark earlier this
week began soliciting proxies in support of a resolution that
seeks to force American General's board to sell or merge the
company. Torchmark's resolution also calls for appointment of
a committee of independent directors to evaluate all
acquisition proposals. American General officials couldn't be
reached for comment.</p>
