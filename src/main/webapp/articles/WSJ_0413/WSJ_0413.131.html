	<p class="article-leader">Smiths Industries PLC, a British aerospace, medical
systems and industrial products company, said that despite
damaging disputes affecting two of its business units, pretax
profit for the six months ended Feb. 3 rose 6.3% to #50.1
million ($82.4 million) from #47.1 million a year earlier.
   Profit after taxes increased 6.2% to #33.1 million from
#31.1 million a year earlier. Per-share earnings rose 5.6% to
11.4 pence from 10.8 pence. Sales rose 3.5% to #317.8 million
from #306.9 million.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Smiths declared an 11% rise in the interim dividend to 3.6
pence from 3.25 pence a year earlier.</p>
<p>"The underlying businesses of each of the three operating
groups made good progress," Smiths said, "though the results
of the aerospace and defense group have been damaged by two
industrial disputes" at its Cheltenham plant and at
Seattle-based Boeing Co., which is Smiths' main civil defense
customer. Smiths said that without the industrial action,
profit for the latest six months would have improved.</p>
