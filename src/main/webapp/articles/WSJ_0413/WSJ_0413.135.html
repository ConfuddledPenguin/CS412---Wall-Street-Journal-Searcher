	<p class="article-leader">Westwood One Inc., Los Angeles, reported that its fiscal
first-quarter loss widened sharply on a rise in revenue
because of increased interest costs, increased investments in
programming, and good-will amortization related to its
acquisition of radio stations in New York and Los Angeles.
   The company, which recently said it is launching its
fourth major radio network, reported a net loss of $7.7
million, or 53 cents a share, compared with a year-earlier
net loss of $3.1 million, or 21 cents a share. Revenue for
the quarter, ended Feb. 28, increased 20% to $31.8 million
from $26.5 million a year earlier.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Because of the increased seasonality of its business,
Westwood One said it expected a "significant portion" of its
projected loss for the year to occur in the first quarter.
"As we move into our second quarter, we expect to see
increasing revenues and improved operating results for the
balance of fiscal 1990 from the company's radio networks and
station operations," said William Battison, president and
chief financial officer.</p>
