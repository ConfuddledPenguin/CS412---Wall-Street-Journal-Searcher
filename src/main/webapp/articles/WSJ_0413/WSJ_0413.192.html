	<p class="article-leader">LONDON -- British inflation jumped to 8.1% in March from
7.5% in February, and the rate for this month is expected to
climb to well over 9%.
   The rate -- the second-highest level since 8.2% in July
1989 -- isn't expected to trigger further tightening in
British base rates, as the trend results largely from earlier
mortgage rate increases and the government's community charge
introduced this month.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>But analysts warned that if the government is forced to
increase base rates beyond the current 15% level because of
external reasons, such as a decline in the value of the
pound, the inflation rate could reach double digits this
summer.</p>
<p>The government blamed the rise largely on the effect of
mortgage rate increases in February. But it said that with
the underlying inflation level, excluding mortgage rates,
rising to 6.3% from 6.2% in February, other factors were at
work, including higher seasonal food prices. It estimated
that annual food inflation alone rose to 8.7% in March -- the
highest level since May 1982 -- from 8.6% in February. Higher
food prices and the community charge, among other factors,
are expected to push inflation higher next month.</p>
<p>Other government data confirmed that while the economic
slowdown will soon lead to a rise in unemployment for the
first time in nearly four years, wage demands remain high.
Unemployment fell by 6,800 in February, as expected, but this
followed an unusually small decline of 1,700 in January. Wage
settlements continued to rise, with the underlying annual
rate of average earnings boosts jumping to 9.5% in February
from 9.25% in January; a rise to 9.75% is expected by
midsummer.</p>
