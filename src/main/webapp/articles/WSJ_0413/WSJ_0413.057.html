	<p class="article-leader">SYDNEY, Australia -- A leading index of the Australian
economy fell 1.4% in February, compared with January,
signaling a continuation of the economy's slowdown.
   The index is compiled by Westpac Banking Corp. and
Melbourne University's Institute of Applied Economic and
Social Research. Their coincident index of the current level
of economic activity also has started to decline, falling
0.6% in January from December.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>A Westpac official said that the gradual slowdown was
expected and that the index suggests this will be prolonged.
The leading index has declined in seven of the past 10
months.</p>
<p>A preliminary calculation of a lagging index of the
economy for January shows a 5% decline, confirming slower
economic growth and suggesting that imbalances in the
economy, caused by strong growth in the past two years, are
being overcome.</p>
