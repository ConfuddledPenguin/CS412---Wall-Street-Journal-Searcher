	<p class="article-leader">Barnett Banks Inc., as expected after a big addition to
its loan-loss reserves, said its first-quarter earnings fell
75% to $15.5 million, or 25 cents a share, from $62.4
million, or $1 a share, a year earlier.
   The latest results were hurt by a $66 million charge to
increase to $317 million the Jacksonville, Fla.,
superregional bank holding company's reserves for potential
losses from problem loans. Write-offs of problem loans
increased 34% to $47 million from $35 million a year earlier,
and, as expected, nonperforming assets -- including about
$310 million in problem loans -- increased to $455.8 million
from about $340 million. Nonperforming assets include
foreclosed loans and loans for which interest payments are 90
days past due.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Though first-quarter profit was at the lower end of
Barnett's target range, a spokesman said the company, with
assets of $29 billion, had strong loan growth of 14% and a
net interest margin that improved slightly to 4.76%.</p>
