	<p class="article-leader">When is a layoff not a layoff?
   When you're shown the door, but it's called something else
at Digital Equipment Corp., International Business Machines
Corp. or any of a dozen other corporate giants recently
forced to retreat from paternalistic traditions of lifetime
employment.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Intense competition increasingly has caused companies in
industries from banking to consumer products to reverse their
no-layoff policies. "It's impossible to maintain these
policies today," says James C. Cabrera, president of Drake
Beam Morin, a big New York-based outplacement firm. "The old
womb-to-tomb psychological contract has been broken."</p>
<p>The retreat at some of the nation's best-known firms
reflects the triumph of short-term thinking in American
business, says Prof. Oscar Ornati of New York University's
graduate business school. "Companies tend to view employees
as fixed costs that can be cut," he says. "More companies
today are focusing on short-term gains -- not building for
the long term."</p>
<p>Some of the companies ending no-layoff traditions go to
ridiculous lengths to claim they still never force people
out. Targeted workers are "redundant," "excessed" or
"transitioned" -- never laid off.</p>
<p>"It's a form of double-think," says Marc Schulman, an
analyst with UBS Securities. "They're trying to disguise
what's really going on." He was especially critical of
Digital for failing to disclose the full extent of planned
cuts -- which insiders assert could total 5,000 to 8,000 this
year -- that the company began making in a piecemeal fashion
last month. "Their salami-style approach is hard on
employees, who never really know when it will end," Mr.
Schulman says.</p>
<p>In addition to using euphemisms for layoffs, some
companies are heavy-handed in the way they send the signal to
employees.</p>
<p>At Digital, people who once wore suits and ties were put
to work in recent months painting hallways at a plant in
Salem, N.H. At a factory in Phoenix, Ariz., Digital in the
past loaned unneeded employees to the city, "sprucing up
parks, painting signs and other civic work," a former
executive recalls. "It didn't take people long to decide it
was time to go."</p>
<p>The end of some lifetime-employment policies is old news
for Peter Clavelle, mayor of Burlington, Vt., which will have
to absorb this year's loss of as many as 1,000 top-flight
manufacturing jobs at nearby IBM and Digital plants.</p>
<p>"These companies may claim they don't lay off workers, but
I don't take much comfort in that," he says. "The reality is
that as they reduce the work force, no matter how it's done,
the economic impact is the same. We still have a strong
economy, but it hurts."</p>
<p>Adds a Burlington-area employment agent, who didn't want
to be identified: "Morale is down at both plants. And out at
Digital, I'm not so sure people really have a choice about
leaving the company." So, even with a generous severance
payment, "that sounds like a layoff to me."</p>
<p>Still, Digital and IBM had long been the exceptions in the
computer industry, where quick and merciless cutbacks are
common.</p>
<p>Hewlett-Packard Co., too, had a lifetime-employment
reputation. But it laid off 440 workers last year at its
newly acquired Chelmsford, Mass.-based Apollo Computer unit.
"It's impossible today to have a cut-and-dried no-layoff
policy," says Marleen Somsak, a spokeswoman. "We offered
transfers to as many employees as we could. But we knew there
would be redundant jobs."</p>
<p>Computer makers aren't the only ones hurting, and some
companies had already abandoned lifetime-employment
traditions. "What happened to us is what happened to a lot of
big American companies in the 1980s," says a spokesman for
Eastman Kodak Co. Pressed by rising costs and intense
competition, 20,000 people left Kodak between 1983 and 1989.
And while most were able to take liberal, voluntary severance
options, "the sense of having your job for life -- which had
been a reality here for generations -- is gone," he says.</p>
<p>Some firms have held fast to their no-layoff policies.
Delta Air Lines has been known to put pilots temporarily to
work pitching luggage at their same salary when other
airlines are furloughing flight crews. "It's expensive, but
we believe it pays dividends," says spokesman James H. Lundy.
"As a service business, we need well-motivated, loyal people
on the front lines serving passengers."</p>
<p>Federal Express Co. feels the same. When its ZapMail
service failed, the company offered jobs elsewhere in the
company to the unit's workers. And no layoffs took place
after the buy-out of rival Tiger International last year,
despite concern the decision could hurt earnings.</p>
<p>A company's first-ever layoff sends a chill through the
ranks. "It's a culture shock," says Jay P. Stevens, an
analyst at Dean Witter Reynolds. "Some of these companies had
known nothing but double-digit growth. Now they're suddenly
facing hard reality."</p>
<p>Polaroid Corp., fending off hostile bidder Shamrock
Holdings in 1988, used voluntary severance to slim down by
1,700, or 15% of its U.S. work force. "No one got fired,"
says a spokesman. "It was all voluntary. It isn't written
policy, but it's part of our culture."</p>
<p>But voluntary severance plans are expensive. Workers at
IBM's Boca Raton, Fla., plant in 1988 were offered up to two
years' pay, with benefits, plus a $25,000 bonus. To stay on
the payroll, most had to move to North Carolina -- and forgo
the bonus and severance check. IBM wrote off $500 million in
the latest quarter to cover the cost of cutting its work
force by another 10,000 this year, mostly through severance
offers. The latest program -- two weeks' pay for each year of
service, up to 52 weeks' pay -- is far less generous than
past offers, a point that isn't lost on employees.</p>
<p>Digital is offering thousands of workers "voluntary
severance" packages of between 40 weeks and two years of pay,
plus benefits. But it says its plans are "evolving" and
hasn't publicly disclosed them. Analysts expect Digital to
cut at least 5,000 people from the work force of 125,900 and
to post a pretax charge of as much as $400 million in the
quarter ending June 30.</p>
<p>Some voluntary severance and early-retirement programs
backfire. IBM lost skilled, senior-level employees in past
rounds of cutbacks. This time, the computer giant is making
only manufacturing and some administrative employees eligible
for the program. Digital says it's determined not to make the
same mistake. Insiders say that specific jobs -- and in some
cases, people -- will be shown the door.</p>
<p>As wrenching as it is, many of these companies will
benefit from a leaner work force, analysts and others say.
"They've become bloated, and they're coming to the
realization that they will have to downsize to stay
competitive," says Prof. Martin K. Starr of Columbia
University's graduate business school. "And when they close a
plant, it costs jobs -- no matter how they try to finesse
it."</p>
