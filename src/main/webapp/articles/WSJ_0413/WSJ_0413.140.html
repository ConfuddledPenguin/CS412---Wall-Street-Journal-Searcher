	<p class="article-leader">Alcan Aluminium Ltd., hit hard by falling aluminum prices,
said in Montreal that net income for the first quarter
dropped 36% to $172 million, or 74 cents a share, from $269
million, or $1.16 a share, a year earlier.
   Revenue was $2.20 billion compared with $2.31 billion.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The latest quarter includes a one-time nonoperating gain
of $63 million, or 28 cents a share. The 1989 first quarter
includes a one-time nonoperating gain of $30 million, or 13
cents a share. Excluding the gains, net income dropped 54% to
$109 million, or 46 cents a share, from $239 million, or
$1.03 a share.</p>
<p>The steep drop in earnings was in line with analysts'
expectations.</p>
<p>Alcan said aluminum ingot prices in the latest quarter
were down 11% from the fourth quarter of 1989 and 30% from
the year-ago quarter. While order levels are improving in the
U.S. market "it's still too early to change our cautious view
of prospects for 1990," Alcan said.</p>
