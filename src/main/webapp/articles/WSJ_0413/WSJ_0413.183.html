	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Two Kirby brothers are at odds over just how
much anti-takeover protection their Alleghany Corp. financial
services company needs.
   Director Allan P. Kirby Jr., 58 years old, said in a
filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission that he
will solicit proxies for the April 27 annual meeting. He
opposes a proposal to extend an anti-takeover measure that
otherwise would expire after the meeting.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Mr. Kirby, who controls a bit more than 10% of the
company, said he wants only the flexibility "to vote my stock
in the future in concert with anyone I want to if I want to."</p>
<p>The Kirby family as of March 1 controlled about 39% of the
company's shares, valued at about $213 million. F.M. Kirby,
70 years old, Allan's brother, is chairman of the company,
which has made millions from investments and has made an
occasional high-profile acquisition.</p>
<p>In 1984, Alleghany sold Investors Diversified Services
Inc., the big mutual fund and investment company, to American
Express Co. for more than $700 million, at the time making
Alleghany the largest shareholder of American Express. In
1985, Alleghany was one of the final bidders seeking to buy
Consolidated Rail Corp. from the federal government. From
1954 until 1968, Alleghany owned a controlling interest in
the New York Central railroad, subsequently merged into the
Penn Central system which later collapsed and was taken over
by the government.</p>
<p>In recent years, Alleghany has expanded into financial
services, acquiring several title and other insurance
companies. It bought Sacramento (Calif.) Savings & Loan
Association in 1989 and also operates a steel fastener
business.</p>
<p>In July 1988 the SEC adopted a rule barring from national
stock exchanges the securities of any company that acts to
reduce unequally the voting rights of existing common
shareholders. But companies with such plans adopted before
mid-1988, such as Alleghany, were permitted to continue the
plans.</p>
<p>Alleghany's directors, other than Allan Kirby, have
proposed to extend the restriction to 1995. The company's
proxy statement says directors believe the restriction "is
still necessary to achieve the company's goals," and will
"deal with an active takeover environment in general and with
its possible disruptive consequences."</p>
<p>Allan Kirby's letter to shareholders asserts that keeping
the restriction could limit the market value of the company
and insulate directors and senior management from
"accountability to all stockholders."</p>
<p>He also noted that the company has in place a variety of
other measures to protect against unsolicited takeover
offers. Mr. Kirby stressed that he isn't part of an investing
group and doesn't want to see the company sold.</p>
