	<p class="article-leader">DALLAS -- Lone Star Technologies Inc. said the unsecured
creditors committee of its Lone Star Steel Co. unit is
seeking to recover $109.3 million from the parent on behalf
of the subsidiary.
   Lone Star said the committee filed an amended complaint in
federal court in Dallas seeking to recover expenditures made
by the unit at the parent's direction and to recover amounts
alleged to have been improperly transferred to the parent.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Previously, the committee sought to recover an
intercompany receivable valued at a minimum of $23 million on
behalf of the unit, which is operating under protection from
creditors under Chapter 11 of the federal Bankruptcy Code.</p>
<p>In the lawsuit, the creditors group alleges that the
parent orchestrated a series of transactions allowing it to
use the steel company's funds for its own benefit. The group
also seeks to recover assets it said were diverted from the
steel company to Conroe Pipe Co. and to recover the $11.5
million that the parent received from the sale of Conroe
facilities in December.</p>
<p>Lone Star Technologies said it will defend itself against
the claims.</p>
