	<p class="article-leader">For years, Pacific Gas & Electric Co. suffered the
corporate equivalent of a migraine: a $5.8 billion nuclear
plant reviled by environmentalists and criticized by
regulators.
   The Diablo Canyon facility, nearly 20 years in the making,
became a fixation at PG&E, preoccupying the company's
management and its board. "We were totally absorbed,"
confesses Richard A. Clarke, chairman and chief executive.
"We were worn out."</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>In a striking about face, the nation's largest
investor-owned utility has shed its woes lately, turned
potential financial disaster into a profit, and is trying
hard to rework its tarnished image.</p>
<p>Thanks to an unconventional pact with state regulators-in
which the company's revenue from Diablo Canyon depends on the
plant's performance rather than a fixed return on investment
-- PG&E last year coaxed $225 million in after-tax profit
from its one-time white elephant and may make more this year
if the plant continues its current output.</p>
<p>Moreover, the San Francisco-based utility is enjoying
considerable public good will from its quick restoration of
services after the city's Oct. 17 earthquake. The company
expects to recoup nearly all of its estimated $100 million in
earthquake-related outlays from insurance and from rates.</p>
<p>With regulatory treatment of Diablo Canyon settled, "we
feel liberated," says Mr. Clarke. Now PG&E is wooing the same
environmentalists who once hectored it. It's also striving to
operate Diablo Canyon efficiently and safely, and broaden
investments in non-regulated businesses with which it says it
feels familiar.</p>
<p>A number of utilities have enjoyed a similar burst of cash
flow, as heavy borrowing for nuclear construction suddenly
has reversed and become a stream of revenue when a plant
comes on line. The sudden wealth has been badly spent in some
cases. Pinnacle West Capital Corp., for instance, squandered
anticipated profits from its Palo Verde nuclear station by
investing in the thrift business, nearly bankrupting itself
in the process.</p>
<p>PG&E is determined to avoid such pitfalls, says Mr.
Clarke. "We're not diversifying; we're taking advantage of
the business that we know," he asserts.</p>
<p>Mr. Clarke says the company expects first-quarter net
income to be lower than the year-earlier 53 cents a share. A
scheduled refueling outage of the Unit 2 reactor at the
company's Diablo Canyon nuclear plant makes it "reasonable to
assume that our earnings will be lower than they were last
year," he said.</p>
<p>But the executive said 1990 net income likely will exceed
the $1.90 a share reported for 1989. However, he said an
average of analysts' estimates of $2.07 a share is "a little
high."</p>
<p>PG&E had net income of $244.4 million, or 53 cents a
share, in the 1989 first quarter on revenue of $2.11 billion.
Net income last year totaled $900.6 million, or $1.90 a
share, on $8.59 billion in revenue.</p>
<p>To expand its non-regulated business, Mr. Clarke said PG&E
may substantially boost its investment in natural-gas
exploration and production. The company's PG&E Resources Co.
subsidiary presently holds interests in exploration leases
covering about 600,000 gross acres in Texas, Louisiana,
Arkansas, California, and the Rocky Mountain region. The
holdings amount to about 220,000 acres, net of other
investors' interests.</p>
<p>"It's not infeasible that in resources you might see a
huge acquisition of reserves," Mr. Clarke added.</p>
<p>PG&E, late in 1988, acquired Wessely Energy Co.'s U.S. oil
and gas assets for about $100 million. At the time, it said
further acquisitions were planned. However, purchases haven't
materialized yet. Mr. Clarke said the company is constantly
reviewing possibilities.</p>
<p>In another gas-related venture, PG&E is opening refilling
stations for vehicles powered by compressed natural gas. The
company expects to have nine such stations open to the public
by the end of the year.</p>
<p>PG&E also plans to about double the capacity of a pipeline
that carries natural gas from western Canada to the Pacific
northwest and California, adding 900 million cubic feet daily
of new transmission capacity. Operation of the $1.5 billion
project is scheduled for 1993. Its capacity is already
contracted for, Mr. Clarke says.</p>
<p>Jointly, the three natural gas projects are part of an
overall strategy. "Our whole premise is that . . . gas is a
good business to be in," Mr. Clarke says.</p>
<p>PG&E's environmental thrust is focused on future power
developments, where the company is working at least as hard
on the generating capacity it won't build as that which it
will. Of about 3,300 megawatts of forecast potential new
demand over the next decade, PG&E thinks it can forestall at
least 2,500 megawatts -- roughly equal to the output of two
nuclear generating units -- through energy conservation.</p>
<p>The utility plans to spend about $170 million this year
and about $200 million annually after that on financial
inducements to reduce demand among a wide range of
electricity consumers. Plans include educational efforts for
energy-efficient lighting, inducements for industry to use
more efficient motors, and better residential insulation
programs.</p>
<p>The California Public Utility Commission currently is
considering proposals under which PG&E would receive a return
on these investments.</p>
<p>Mr. Clarke said about 800 megawatts of capacity not
achieved through customer efficiencies may be provided in
part by wind and solar power. A substantial portion, however,
likely will be come from updating existing gas and oil-fired
generating stations, he said.</p>
