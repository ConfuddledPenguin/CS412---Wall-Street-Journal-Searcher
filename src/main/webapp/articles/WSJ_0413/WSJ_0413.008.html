	<p class="article-leader">SOROAKO, Indonesia -- It takes a lot of heat to smelt
nickel, as the world's largest miner of the metal knows. But
Inco Ltd. of Toronto didn't know how badly it would get
burned before its Indonesian unit began to turn around.
   The company overcame much, however -- a decade of
technical problems, daunting costs and weak nickel prices --
and now is offering shares in a smelter that is producing
solid profits. The prospects for that offering, and for the
Indonesian operation's future as it expands, seem bright
enough to suggest that Inco will see some reward for its
years of struggle.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>On paper in the late 1960s, Inco's plan to mine and refine
huge deposits of nickel-laterite ore beneath a hilly forest
tract in remote Sulawesi appeared to be a winner. After
nearly $1 billion was spent and production began in the late
1970s, however, the plan proved to be a big loser. Sagging
nickel prices, high energy costs and other problems forced
the Soroako unit to borrow nearly $440 million from the
parent company.</p>
<p>Typical of the troubles encountered, the smelter itself
didn't work properly at first. The required heat -- as much
as 1,600 degrees Celsius -- was eating up the linings of the
giant furnaces.</p>
<p>The overall situation, recalls processing manager Andre
Daenuwy, "became desperate. You had to wonder: Are we ever
going to run this place? There were so many problems."</p>
<p>Today, P.T. International Nickel Indonesia is running
well. Nickel prices are comfortable and production has risen
while costs have been slashed. Furnace linings are no longer
suffering, nor is the Canadian parent. Inco Indonesia, as the
unit is known, has repaid all but $95 million of its debt to
the home office.</p>
<p>This month, Inco Indonesia faces a new test in convincing
investors that the Soroako operation is a good bet in spite
of nickel's historical price volatility. The company is
making the second-biggest offering to date on the Jakarta
Stock Exchange, as the parent sells 20% of its stake,
reducing its holding to 58%. (Inco originally held 98% of
Inco Indonesia, but sold 20% to Sumitomo Metal Mining Co. of
Japan in 1988.)</p>
<p>Having proved that its perseverance is paying off, Inco
Indonesia should find the offering oversubscribed. The
company that faced bad luck in the early years came into some
good luck before the share offer.</p>
<p>A year ago, when the issue was first planned, it seemed
certain that Inco Indonesia's offer wouldn't be open to
international investors because of a ceiling on foreign
ownership. However, a change made in Indonesian stock
regulations last August allows foreigners to take up 49% of
public share issues, except those by banks. Moreover,
Indonesians have wanted to buy shares attractive to foreign
funds; most foreign funds appear keen on Inco Indonesia.</p>
<p>Inco Indonesia executives expect the foreign portion to be
about three times oversubscribed. It's hard to project the
domestic demand, but it may be reasonably strong.</p>
<p>There's irony in the offering for the parent company.
Under Inco's 1968 contract with Jakarta, the company has
offered 20% equity to the Indonesian government -- 2% a year
during each year of the 1980s. But the cash-strapped
government wasn't interested.</p>
<p>Last year, authorities told Inco that rather than buy the
20%, they wanted it to put the same-size stake on the
emerging Jakarta Stock Exchange. So the company is having to
reduce its holding just when the operation is showing a
profit.</p>
<p>James Guiry, Inco Indonesia's president and managing
director, says given the early difficulties, Soroako would so
far be judged a "poor investment" for the parent concern. But
from here forward, he says, the smelter is a "cash
generator." Inco isn't happy to be giving up 20% now, but the
divestment discharges its contractual commitment with the
Indonesian government, Mr. Guiry adds.</p>
<p>During the offering, open from last Tuesday through April
20, Inco Indonesia is floating 49.7 million shares at 9,800
rupiah ($5.37) each, to raise a total of 487 billion rupiah.
In Toronto, the parent company said the net proceeds of $250
million will be used for repaying debt and general corporate
purposes.</p>
<p>Analysts say the issue was priced at the upper end of
price-earning ratios for mining stocks in the U.S. and
Australia, but still on the lower end of P-Es for initial
offerings in the pricey Jakarta market. (The P-E ratio, the
price of a share divided by earnings per share for a 12-month
period, is a common way of assessing a stock's underlying
value.)</p>
<p>Despite the expected appetite for the offering, analysts
note that Inco Indonesia is selling a pure play on nickel,
its only product -- which could damp some potential interest.</p>
<p>"Inco has done a great job resurrecting that project," one
foreign banker in Jakarta says, "but a commodity like this is
a gamble. Do you really want to take chances on a
single-product company where the price can nose dive?"</p>
