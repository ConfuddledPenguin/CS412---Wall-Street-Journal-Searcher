	<p class="article-leader">TOKYO -- Officials of West European and Japanese official
development banks expect that Eastern Europe's economic
changes will lead to faster growth in Western economies, a
Dutch banking official said.
   He added that funding for Eastern European economic
changes wasn't expected to crowd out other economic
activities.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>M.J.L. Jonkhart, president of Da Nationale
Investeringsbank of the Netherlands, said Eastern European
political and economic changes were one of the main topics
discussed in a conference this week of Western European and
Japanese institutions specializing in long-term credit.</p>
<p>Asked if funding of East European changes would crowd out
some other economic activities, he said, "I don't think so .
. . . The economic consequences are such that they have a
productive influence. They will in principle to a large
extent be self-financing."</p>
