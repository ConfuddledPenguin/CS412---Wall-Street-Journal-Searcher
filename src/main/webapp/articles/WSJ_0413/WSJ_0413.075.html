	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- The Federal Communications Commission
launched a crusade to rescue ailing AM radio.
   The commission, in a series of 5-0 votes, adopted a
package of engineering changes and proposals to improve the
quality of AM service, including opening new bandwidth,
1605-1705 kilohertz, for AM stations. With 5,000 stations, AM
radio has been plagued with congestion and interference,
particularly during nighttime hours, and has been battered by
competition from FM stations. The agency plans not only to
expand the bandwidth, but also to weed out the overgrown AM
garden over the next 10 years.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Adding bandwidth would require radio manufacturers to
modify their products because receivers on the market today
stop picking up signals between 1600 and 1620 kilohertz.
Manufacturers have already begun planning for the additional
bandwidth because the FCC signaled its intention to authorize
its use in the U.S., and Canada and Mexico have already
approved its use for AM radio, said William Hassinger,
assistant chief for engineering of the FCC's Mass Media
Bureau.</p>
<p>Under the proposals, the commission would encourage 25 to
30 existing AM stations nationwide that are causing the most
static to move into the expanded band. It would also give
broadcasters incentives to improve AM service, such as
allowing licensees to negotiate among themselves to reduce
interference. The commission suggested it could provide tax
breaks to AM licensees who receive payments from other
stations to reduce their service areas or turn in their
licenses.</p>
<p>Further, the FCC said it could ease its multiple-ownership
rules to allow licensees to own AM stations with overlapping
service areas if one of the stations cuts down its
interference with other AM stations. And it said it is
considering banning AM-FM simulcast stations.</p>
<p>Among other steps, the commission changed some rules to
improve AM reception, such as modifying the way it calculates
skywave and groundwave field strength. The new skywave model
-- a key to improving AM service during nighttime hours --
gives engineers more accurate information on the likelihood
of interference.</p>
<p>The FCC's actions drew immediate praise from the National
Association of Broadcasters, which called the proposals
"sweeping and historic." The NAB said broadcasters "are
encouraged by the FCC's far-reaching changes and proposals
and look forward to reviewing" the plans.</p>
<p>William Sanders, president of KICD/ KICD-FM, in Spencer,
Iowa, and chairman of the NAB's radio board, said the
commission's actions will improve all classes of AM stations.
The changes, he said, "look to the future of possibly radical
changes in the currently dense population of the AM band" to
reduce interference and make AM radio a more competitive
service.</p>
<p>For years, broadcasters have been complaining about
interference on the AM band. Earlier this year, the FCC
conducted a daylong hearing to explore ways to improve AM
service. Yesterday's proposals grew out of that hearing and
voluminous proposals from the industry.</p>
<p>The commission will accept public comments on all the
proposals before deciding on final rules.</p>
<p>FCC Chairman Alfred Sikes noted that Congress is also
taking up legislation to improve AM radio, and that the
agency "is looking forward" to working with lawmakers. As the
AM industry moves toward stereo broadcasting, he said, the
commission's actions help "set the technological stage." In a
competitive, high-tech market, the chairman warned, "being
second best isn't good enough."</p>
<p>Commissioner Andrew Barrett, a former state public
utilities regulator from Illinois, raised concerns about
shifting channels from the existing AM band to the expanded
AM band. "I understand the desire to remove interference and
congestion from the existing AM band," he said. "However, the
cure for AM may be the denial of opportunity for new
entrants, including minorities, women and public
broadcasters." The commission, he said, needs "to ensure that
minorities are not precluded from ownership opportunities as
this commission allocates new spectrum."</p>
<p>Commissioner Barrett said minorities own only about 3% of
the nation's 11,000 broadcast properties. Just what the FCC
can do to change this isn't clear. The FCC's
minority-preference programs, which gives members of minority
groups and women an edge in competing for broadcast licenses,
currently are under review by the Supreme Court.</p>
