	<p class="article-leader">State Street Boston Corp., bolstered by higher fee and net
interest income, reported a 14% rise in first-quarter
earnings.
   Net income in the quarter was $27.6 million, or 73 cents a
primary share, compared with $24 million, or 66 cents a
share, in 1989. Fully diluted earnings were 73 cents a share
compared with 64 cents a share.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The Boston bank-holding company said its gains would have
been even stronger without higher provisions for loan losses.
Provisions in the quarter rose to $10.4 million from $3.6
million. State Street derives most of its income from fees
from financial services such as back-office work for mutual
funds.</p>
<p>Fee revenue rose 17% in the quarter to $118.9 million from
$101.6 million. State Street attributed the gain in part to
growth in international and mutual fund assets under
management and expanded use of international asset-custody
services. Foreign exchange trading revenue rose 21% to $7.5
million from $6.2 million.</p>
<p>Net interest revenue rose 11% to $53.6 million from $48.2
million.</p>
