	<p class="article-leader">Newspaper publishers, facing one of the deepest declines
in newspaper advertising in a decade, are expected to report
modest to negative first-quarter results.
   New York Times Co., for example, cited a drop in ad linage
in reporting that net income fell 51%.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>While there are pockets of positive advertising growth,
largely in Southern California and Florida, newspapers face a
dismal year for advertising and earnings. One positive note
for most publishers is continued favorable newsprint-price
picture -- often a quarter of a newspaper's costs -- which
will hold down increases in operating expenses.</p>
<p>In the newspaper industry's three major sources of
advertising revenue, the outlook is bad. Continued
instability among the nation's retail chains and sluggish
retail sales in general are expected to lead to further
declines in retail linage. National advertising in newspapers
is expected to remain flat at best. Classified advertising
linage, robust in the late 1980s, is expected to decline,
largely because of declining help-wanted advertising, an
economic slowdown, and continued growth of low-cost
competitors such as community shoppers and weekly newspapers.</p>
<p>"This is the worst quarter for publishers in a long time,"
said Edward Atorino, media analyst for Salomon Brothers.
"Most newspaper stocks are underperforming. There's some good
long-term value there."</p>
<p>Lisa Donneson, analyst for County NatWest, said based on
reports for January and February, none of the major newspaper
companies showed year-to-year increases in total advertising
linage.</p>
<p>Like many companies with major newspapers in the
Northeast, New York Times Co. saw its earnings get pounded by
the drop in ad linage at its flagship newspaper, the New York
Times. Net fell to $16.6 million, or 22 cents a share, from
$33.5 million, or 42 cents a share, from a year earlier. The
year-ago quarter included profit of $2 million, or two cents
a share, from discontinued operations. Excluding the year-ago
gain, profit was off 47%. Revenue rose 2% to $431.2 million
from $423.1 million.</p>
<p>The company cited weakness in the New York region's
economy as a major factor for the decline. There was also an
eight-cent-a-share reduction in earnings caused by increased
depreciation and interest expense related to completion of
the building for the New York Times's new automated color
production and distribution facility in Edison, N.J., and a
new facility for the Gwinnett (Ga.) Daily News.</p>
<p>"The linage drop is worse than what any one expected,"
said Salomon Brothers' Mr. Atorino.</p>
<p>Tribune Co. is expected to report lower earnings for the
quarter, between 40 to 45 cents a share, compared with 49
cents a share a year earlier when net was $36.7 million on
revenue of $553 million. Growth in Tribune's broadcasting
operations was probably offset by declines in newsprint
profits and weakness in newspaper ad linage. In New York,
Tribune's Daily News linage has been dragged down by the
sagging New York City economy, and the situation could
worsen. The paper, now in the midst of crucial labor
negotiations, could be facing a strike soon.</p>
<p>Washington Post Co. is expected to report one of the few
per-share gains, more than $3.30 for the quarter, compared
with $3.22 a year earlier when net was $41.5 million on
revenue of $342 million. County NatWest's Ms. Donneson noted,
however, that linage for the company's flagship Washington
Post was off 5.6% in March. "They had a strong year last
year, but they were hurt by a late Easter this year," she
said. "The underlining tone of the Post's business is not
good."</p>
<p>As previously reported, Dow Jones & Co.'s first-quarter
net fell 88% to $24.9 million, or 25 cents a share, from $200
million, or $1.99 a share, a year earlier. The 1989 quarter
included a $164.1 million, or $1.63 a share, gain from sale
of an investment in a cable-TV system operator. Excluding the
gain, profit was off 31%.</p>
<p>Dow Jones, publisher of The Wall Street Journal, said
increases in operating profit from its business publications
segment were offset by a decline in operating profit from
information services. The decline was caused mostly by the
costs of introducing a foreign exchange trading service by
the Telerate Inc. subsidiary. Ad linage was down 3.9% at the
Journal, up 2.1% at Barron's magazine, and down 8.8% at the
23 daily community newspapers in the Ottaway Newspapers Inc.
unit.</p>
<p>At Times Mirror Co., earnings are expected to be about 40
cents a share, compared with 53 cents a share a year earlier
when net was $68.8 million on revenue of $846.9 million. The
company's major problem, analysts said, is its East Coast
papers, Long Island, N.Y.'s Newsday, Baltimore Sun, and
Hartford Courant, where classified and retail ad linage has
declined severely. Despite competition from Freedom Newspaper
Inc.'s Orange County Register, the Los Angeles Times' ad
linage has been on the rise.</p>
<p>Knight-Ridder Inc., buoyed by a recovery at the Miami
Herald and cost savings from the Detroit newspaper merger
involving its Detroit Free Press, is expected to report an
earnings increase to about 48 cents a share, compared with 39
cents a share last year when net was $20.5 million on revenue
of $541 million.</p>
<p>Gannett Co. is expected to remain flat or possibly show a
slight increase in per-share earnings to about 48 cents for
the quarter, compared with 47 cents a year earlier when net
totaled $75 million on revenue of $818 million. Despite
falling linage and flat revenue for Gannett's newspaper
group, analysts pointed to positive factors such as
termination of its joint venture with GTG Entertainment and
cancellation of its "USA Today on TV" show.</p>
