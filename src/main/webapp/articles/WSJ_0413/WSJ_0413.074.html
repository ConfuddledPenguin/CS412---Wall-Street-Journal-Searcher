	<p class="article-leader">SOFIA, Bulgaria -- After three months of wrangling with
the emerging opposition parties, the Bulgarian Communist
Party pledged itself to free multiparty elections in June and
renamed itself the Bulgarian Socialist Party on April 3. At
the same time, the Communist-controlled Parliament amended
the constitution so as to eliminate the words "socialist" and
"communist" from the text and elected Petr Mladenov, the
Communist leader who precipitated these reforms, to the new
position of president of the republic.
   But Bulgaria's success in reaching democracy depends not
on the goodwill of the old regime, but on the profusion of
democratic forces that have sprung up since Todor Zhivkov,
the man who ruled Bulgaria since 1954, was deposed on Nov.
10. Many of these forces can be found in a five-story
building on Sofia's Knyaz Dondukov Boulevard, where scores of
young Bulgarians briskly move from office to office. On one
floor is the near-libertarian Radical Democratic Party; on
another is the Social Democratic Party and its more militant
non-Marxist fraction.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>About a mile away, on Rakovsky street, in the former home
of the Bulgarian Industrial Society, is the office of the
United Democratic Front -- an umbrella group that has united
a broad coalition of democratic political parties,
environmental groups, student groups and free trade unions.
The Democratic Front's chairman, Zhelyu Zhelev, is
unabashedly optimistic about the prospects for democracy: "If
we hold together a broad coalition of all democratic forces,
we can change everything in Bulgaria within a few months of
taking power. By the end of the year, we will resolve all the
political and economic transformations necessary for
democracy."</p>
<p>The Front promises to restore private ownership excluding
only mineral resources, water, forests and pastures. Shares
in most state enterprises would be given to privately held
pension, insurance and health funds. Those bits of the state
sector that the Front does not intend to dispose of would be
transferred from the national government to the
municipalities. The minimum wage and unemployment insurance
would be retained; otherwise, the Front intends to plunge
into the market.</p>
<p>One of the country's most powerful democratic leaders is
Konstantin Trenchev, who heads Bulgaria's independent trade
union federation, Podkrepa (Support). Only last summer, Mr.
Trenchev was in jail. Today, with his movement grown to
150,000 members, Mr. Trenchev senses victory. "By the time
elections come in June, Podkrepa can have as many as 500,000
members. I am confident that we will win."</p>
<p>On the streets of Sofia, Mr. Trenchev is stopped every few
minutes by wellwishers, by those seeking help or by union
colleagues. In restaurants, his arrival turns heads. His
sharp interventions at televised roundtable discussions with
the authorities have made a celebrity of him.</p>
<p>Mr. Trenchev is a strong admirer of the free market. "When
we take power in June we must move decisively to dismantle
all the structures of totalitarianism. We have to make a dash
for the market, which is the normal state of economy. We must
move from a pathological system to a normal one. And the
social tension in the country is already enormous. I'm for
the Balcerowicz Plan," he says, referring to the program of
currency convertibility and subsidy elimination adopted by
Polish finance minister Leszek Balcerowicz.</p>
<p>Until the elections, the old authorities are still in
charge. Mr. Zhelev worries that outside Sofia and other major
urban centers, the opposition program is still not well
known. Party bosses still rule like lords over the small
peasant communities in the provinces. Above all, the party
retains control of the media: television through the state
monopoly, and the press through its control of newsprint
allocations. While the party's papers together print 3
million copies a day, the UDF paper, Democratsiya, had been
permitted to print only 70,000. After a March 12 rally for
more newsprint drew 150,000 protesters, the UDF was permitted
300,000 copies.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the communists' commitment to reform might
look more sincere if each successive act of liberalization
were not so obviously stamped "Made in the U.S.S.R." "If
Moscow passes land reform legislation or joint-venture laws,
Bulgaria passes similar legislation within a matter of days,"
a diplomat here observed.</p>
<p>Still, the secret police are not much in evidence and the
ordinary police now lackadaisically enforce the decrees that
restrict demonstrations, public meetings and street
merchants. The traffic police in their imposing watch towers
blithely pass the day reading newspapers where they once
flagged down drivers and pedestrians for the least
infraction.</p>
<p>The government's lingering attachment to central economic
controls is the opposition's ultimate weapon. Newsprint is
not the only item in short supply. Industrial output declined
by over 10% in the three months after the toppling of Mr.
Zhivkov. Price controls restrain nominal inflation to around
10%, but more and more basic foodstuffs -- sometimes milk and
at other times even bread -- are vanishing from shops for
weeks on end. Under these circumstances, the population is
likely to vote for change as soon as it gets the chance.</p>
<p>With some justice, it was the communists' campaign of
repression against the country's Turkish minority that
precipitated the economic crisis. Persecution persuaded more
than 300,000 Turks, most of them farmers, to flee Bulgaria
last year. Their fields were left unplanted and soil untilled
-- and the result was, soon enough, the food shortage from
which Bulgaria now suffers. This crisis provoked a wave of
industrial unrest, which in turn persuaded the authorities to
relax their control of daily life.</p>
<p>The opposition is eager for Western assistance: Election
observers to help ensure a fair count or a visit by a
prominent U.S. political figure -- such as Sen. Edward
Kennedy, or Jimmy Carter or Ronald Reagan. An entertainer
such as Stevie Wonder, Michael Jackson or Joan Baez might be
even better.</p>
<p>But the opposition, which is indignant over the
squandering of billions of dollars in Western loans by the
Zhivkov regime, also seems to agree that economic assistance
should come only after the democratic process has become
irreversible.</p>
