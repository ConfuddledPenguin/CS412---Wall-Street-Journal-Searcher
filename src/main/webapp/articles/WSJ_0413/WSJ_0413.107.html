	<p class="article-leader">Regulators are poised to usher in a new era of selling
bonds and stocks in the U.S. that could sharply swell the
$165 billion market for privately placed securities.
   After a 1 1/2-year debate, the Securities and Exchange
Commission next Thursday is expected to pass a rule that
could exempt billions of dollars in new securities offerings
from disclosure rules.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The chief beneficiaries will be big institutional
investors, corporate issuers and Wall Street investment
bankers. Individual investors, on the other hand, won't gain;
they will be barred from buying any of the expected crop of
new securities. And there are risks for buyers in a market
with less-stringent disclosure requirements.</p>
<p>The SEC's new Rule 144a would exempt U.S. and foreign
institutions from registration requirements for the sale of
bonds and stocks to any institution already holding at least
$100 million in securities.</p>
<p>These securities are sold in the private-placement market,
which is limited to institutions; individual investors are
shut out of this private market, which is largely used to
sell corporate debt.</p>
<p>In effect, the SEC is expected to allow large players to
trade among themselves without going back to the registration
and disclosure process. This step could vastly enlarge the
volume of bonds and stocks sold in the private-placement
market, although the market isn't likely to mushroom
overnight.</p>
<p>The rule would put a stamp of approval on a process that
the SEC has tacitly allowed over the years among many
institutions in the private market. By codifying these
informal practices, the SEC will create a safe harbor that is
expected to draw into the market institutions that had been
reluctant to venture forth without regulatory guidance.</p>
<p>"The whole character of the private-placement market will
change," says Sara Hanks, who until recently headed the SEC's
international corporate finance unit.</p>
<p>The rule has several important implications. It's expected
to attract droves of foreign companies to the U.S. markets to
raise capital; foreign concerns have largely avoided the
marketplace here because of stringent American disclosure
rules.</p>
<p>And the rule could make U.S. markets more competitive, by
lowering financing costs and keeping U.S. companies from
heading overseas to finance themselves.</p>
<p>Equally important, the rule is likely to bolster liquidity
-- the ease with which securities can be bought and sold in
the secondary, or resale, market for private placements.</p>
<p>But the rule will be no panacea. That's because
restrictions on snapping up private securities still exist
among many of the expected buyers.</p>
<p>Mutual funds generally can't invest more than 10% of their
assets in so-called restricted securities such as private
placements. And state law doesn't allow insurance companies
to buy private securities in a big way: New York state, for
example, prohibits insurance firms from putting more than 1%
of their assets in foreign securities. Until the restrictions
are lifted, some say, the rule's impact will be blunted.</p>
<p>"The $64,000 question is: How long is it going to take to
get buyers to come to the party, and how many will come once
they decide what the party is?" says Curtis Welling, a
managing director at First Boston Corp.</p>
<p>Says Robert Pozen, general counsel for Fidelity
Investments, the nation's biggest mutual-fund group: "It's
not going to be a huge revolution, but a modest evolution."</p>
<p>The rule may create yet another barrier for small
investors, who can't trade these securities. By greatly
expanding the market to which individual investors lack
access, critics say, it will allow the big boys to use their
size and clout to create even more favorable deals than they
already get.</p>
<p>There are risks, too: Just because an institution holds a
boatload of money doesn't necessarily make it a smart
investor. Many large thrifts proved that. And the money
that's at risk in a big pension fund ultimately belongs to
small investors.</p>
<p>As a result, SEC Chairman Richard Breeden is considering
seeking to impose an additional barrier for banks and
thrifts, by setting minimum net capital standards. Mr.
Breeden, a veteran of the thrift bailout, is said to be
concerned about the sophistication of banks and thrifts. The
SEC won't offer this proposal next Thursday, however.</p>
<p>Says Monte Wetzler, an attorney for Breed, Abbott &
Morgan, a New York law firm: "The underlying assumption is
that institutions are sophisticated enough to deal with the
lack of disclosure."</p>
<p>Despite a lack of regulation, there is often more
disclosure in the private market than for publicly traded
securities, some securities executives contend. Jerome
Greene, a managing director at Merrill Lynch & Co., says "the
very personal process" of negotiating deals in the private
market ensures that institutions receive adequate
information. Of course, institutions that want more
disclosure can demand a better rate or simply walk away.</p>
<p>The rule couldn't come at a better time for Wall Street.
Stung by a deep recession, securities firms hope the rule
eventually will be a shot in the arm. It also could help
revive the private-placement market by removing the
regulatory uncertainties that have deterred some companies
from using it.</p>
<p>After booming throughout the 1980s, private placements
have slowed recently amid the collapse of the junk-bond
market. Nearly 82% of the $165 billion in securities sold
through private placements last year was corporate debt,
according to IDD Information Services.</p>
<p>But there will be outcasts from this market under whatever
rule the SEC passes: companies whose stock or debt already is
listed on an exchange or quoted over the counter.</p>
<p>The result nevertheless will be a chance for institutions
to freely swap massive blocks of securities. "The impact is
already occurring, much like {preparations for} 1992 in
Europe," says John Miller, an executive vice president at
Equitable Capital Management Corp. in New York. "Foreign
issuers already are coming into the market more often. The
pace has picked up in the past year or so."</p>
<p>The firms most likely to benefit from the new rule will be
those with the biggest international presences, including
Morgan Stanley Group Inc., First Boston and Salomon Inc.,
specialists say.</p>
<p>Among other things, the new rule is ideal for sovereign
and semi-sovereign debt, executives say, because of the high
quality of the issues. A debt offering in the private market
likely to test the effect of the new rule is one by the State
Bank of India. Philip Bennett, a director for capital markets
at Salomon Brothers, says the India debt placement, and an
expected issue for the State Bank of South Australia, "will
be precursors of 144a offerings."</p>
<p>Moreover, the rule also might open up a market for easily
trading controlling interests in companies that have been
taken private in leveraged buy-outs. In that way, it could
provide an alternative for LBO owners who don't want to take
the companies public again to get their money out.</p>
<p>Frederick Zuckerman, vice president and treasurer at
Chrysler Corp., said he thinks finance companies could emerge
as the most frequent users of the new private market. He says
the market would be ripe for "the guys who come to the party
every other week for $100 million or so." He adds: "I just
think it makes life a little easier for people who use the
capital markets."</p>
<p>The New York Stock Exchange, meanwhile, may face pressure
to upgrade its trading systems. That's because the SEC also
is expected next Thursday to approve a new automated trading
system by the National Association of Securities Dealers that
the NASD hopes will serve as the central marketplace for
privately placed securities.</p>
<p>The system, dubbed Portal -- for Private Offerings,
Resales and Trading through Automated Linkages -- will be
able to handle any bond or stock exempted from SEC
registration under Rule 144a.</p>
