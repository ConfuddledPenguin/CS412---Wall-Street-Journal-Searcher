	<p class="article-leader">PITTSBURGH -- National Intergroup Inc. filed two suits
against dissident investors who have challenged it in a proxy
fight.
   The first suit, filed in U.S. District Court here, asks
that the investors, Centaur Partners and Walker Street
Associates, be forced to divest their holdings in National
Intergroup. Centaur holds 16.5% of NII; together, the two
groups own about 25% of the drug distribution and steel
concern, which is based here.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The suit alleges that the two groups have made materially
false and misleading statements in their solicitation of
proxies. The suit also claims that the two defendants may be
acting together as a group without making required
disclosures.</p>
<p>The second suit, filed in state court here, seeks a
declaratory judgment that share holdings owned by Walker
Street and its affiliates as well as Centaur's investment
bankers should be attributed to Centaur. If the state court
grants that judgment, National Intergroup said, it will
initiate a rights offering that would decrease the percentage
of its stock owned by the defendants.</p>
<p>Walker Street Associates had no immediate comment on the
suit. Centaur Partners said it's not acting as a group with
Walker Street or others. Centaur termed the suit an attempt
by National Intergroup to "intimidate us."</p>
