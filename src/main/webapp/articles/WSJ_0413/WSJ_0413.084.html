	<p class="article-leader">DALLAS -- Taxpayers shouldn't hold their breath waiting
for the perpetrators of thrift fraud to repay the millions of
dollars they stole, according to the top federal prosecutors
in Texas.
   "I don't think there's a lot of restitution to be had on
the criminal side," said U.S. Attorney Marvin Collins of
Dallas during testimony here yesterday before the House
Banking Committee.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Courts in Texas ordered about $100 million in restitution
last year from people convicted of fraud related to banks or
thrifts, or almost one-third of the $361.5 million in
restitution ordered nationwide, according to William S.
Sessions, director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation.
Mr. Sessions testified before the committee Wednesday.</p>
<p>But collecting on those orders is another matter. When the
money is available, restitution is often spread out over the
term of a defendant's probation, slowing collections. Of the
$2.2 million in restitution ordered in the Southern District
of Texas in 1989, for example, only $29,000 has been
collected, according to U.S. Attorney Henry Oncken of
Houston.</p>
<p>Besides, the restitution ordered is minuscule when
compared with the total cost of the thrift bailout, which, it
was estimated last week, would cost a minimum of $325
billion.</p>
<p>The committee members' questions about restitution were
the sharpest leveled during the two days of hearings on the
progress of prosecution in thrift-related fraud cases. "We
haven't had any S&L fraud in Delaware," said Rep. Thomas
Carper (D., Del.). "Yet we're having to help you pay for it.
We don't like it."</p>
<p>But Mr. Collins and his fellow U.S. Attorneys from Texas
offered little hope to Rep. Carper and intimated that long
prison terms were a higher priority for prosecutors. "People
in jail don't pay a lot of restitution," Mr. Collins said.
"Another complication is the length of time it takes for
these cases to come to investigation."</p>
<p>In the case of the defunct Sunbelt Savings Association of
Texas, which was singled out by the Banking Committee,
investigators have been worked for 2 1/2 years and won guilty
pleas from five officers of Sunbelt or affiliated companies.</p>
<p>But the investigation has yet to produce an indictment
against Sunbelt's former owner, Edwin T. McBirney III, who
was paid an annual salary of $252,000 on top of wildly
expensive perquisites, according to evidence given to the
House Banking Committee. Thrift regulators attribute almost
$20 million in Sunbelt losses to expenditures for airplanes,
parties, gifts and overdrafts on insiders' accounts.</p>
<p>Mr. Collins, when asked by Committee Chairman Henry B.
Gonzalez why Mr. McBirney hasn't been charged yet, said he
couldn't respond because of the secrecy of the grand jury
process. Mr. McBirney declined an invitation to testify
before the committee.</p>
<p>A civil suit to collect some of Sunbelt's losses is
currently being pursued against Mr. McBirney and other former
Sunbelt officers and directors by the Federal Deposit
Insurance Corp.</p>
<p>Such civil actions by the FDIC offer a better chance of
collecting restitution than criminal cases, Mr. Collins said.
He resisted Rep. Gonzalez's suggestion that U.S. Attorneys
take on more restitution chores through their civil sections.</p>
<p>"We cannot begin to match what the regulators spend" on
outside lawyers to pursue restitution, Mr. Collins said.</p>
