	<p class="article-leader">Chicago -- What's the difference between opening day of
the Major League Baseball season and day two? About 30,000
people. The Chicago Cubs opened Monday night in Wrigley Field
against the Philadelphia Phillies before a full house of
38,000, but were rained out. On Tuesday afternoon, they drew
7,800. Day two really was game one, because Monday night's
soggy two innings didn't count, but the point holds.
   The weather here Tuesday was cold (36 degrees), windy
(north, 26 mph), gray, raw, blustery, nasty and otherwise
unpleasant. The April calendar might have been in double
digits, but the wind-chill figure was in the singles. Given
those conditions, it was a wonder anyone showed up at all.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>You had to give the folks who came some credit; they took
advantage of available shelter. At 1:15 p.m., five minutes
before game time, there were, maybe, 1,000 people in the
stands, but as soon as the last two words of the
Star-Spangled Banner sounded ("Play ball]"), the main force
emerged from beneath the stands to huddle in their seats.</p>
<p>If a fans' boycott of the game had been contemplated,
Tuesday would have been the perfect day for it. But the
people of Chicago -- or the rest of America, for that matter
-- are not up for such displays, however darkly they muttered
during the three-week spring-training lockout that preceded
this season. That has been the pattern throughout the
numerous recent visits of labor strife to our playgrounds.</p>
<p>"The lockout didn't bother us. We've been die-hard Cub
fans since the '30s -- win, lose, or whatever]" whooped
Lorraine Madonia, a housewife from suburban Arlington Heights
at the ballpark with her quieter sister, Fran Tepps. Mrs.
Madonia said her only regret about anything was that the
inclement weather forced her and her sister to don parkas
that hid their Cubs sweatshirts, covered with pins and badges
proclaiming their loyalty to the team. "People from out of
town take our pictures when we have all our stuff showing,"
she declared.</p>
<p>A few rows away, Russ Schlosser, a real estate salesman
from Algonquin, Ill., was almost belligerent in rejecting
suggestions that off-field doings might affect his
spectating. "If they're playing baseball here, I'm watching.
The Cubs could swap their whole team for minor leaguers and
I'd still come out," said he.</p>
<p>It's worth noting that while Cubs fans may be sheep,
they're not cheap. I dug out my 1985 Cubs media guide and
compared the team's ticket prices then and now. A box seat
that sold for $9.50 then fetched $13 on Tuesday, while choice
grandstand seats had been hiked to $10 from $7.50 and
bleacher spaces (no seats there) to $5 from $3.50. I cite
those figures not to single out the Cubs for obloquy, but
from the conviction that their boosts are typical. Their
players, after all, are joining the plutocracy no quicker
than those of other clubs.</p>
<p>The next patron I encountered was bearded Kim Goudreau, of
Rockton, Ill., a community-college sociology teacher. In full
expectation of getting an earful about a credit-card
society's heedless embrace of hedonism, I asked what he made
of the public's willingness to paper the nests of their
sporting heroes, and those heroes' employers, with their
hard-earneds. Instead, he mumbled that baseball is a business
like any other, ticket prices aren't that big a deal to most
people, and -- hey] -- other things cost more, too. That's
what you get when a sociologist becomes a baseball fan.</p>
<p>In fact, you have to admire the skill with which baseball
arranged its latest labor-management set-to. You usually hear
that nobody wins such fights, but this was one that nobody
lost, unless you count motel keepers in Florida and Arizona
and municipalities in those states unwise enough to bankroll
splashy training facilities for clubs. The players didn't
miss a paycheck, and the owners stretched and twisted the
schedule so they could open their gates the usual 80 or so
times. I guess that's what they meant when they said they'd
preserved the season's integrity.</p>
<p>Sure, we had a truncated spring, but that will serve
mainly to give the players a creditable excuse for
early-season failures. "Why aren't you hitting, Slugger?"
"Didn't get enough whacks this spring." "Why can't you get
anyone out, Lefty?" "Couldn't work out the kinks in Florida."</p>
<p>The season began Monday with few deviations from the norm.
The Texas Rangers' Nolan Ryan held Toronto hitless for five
innings but was yanked after 90 pitches to preserve his
43-year-old arm, even as he might be in July. While the New
York Mets were opening against Pittsburgh at Shea, the
cross-town Steinbrennarians were trying to upstage them with
a press conference. This one announced that George had made
Don Mattingly baseball's highest-paid player, at $3.8 mil per
year for five.</p>
<p>The Cubs' opening-day lineup lacked their big bopper,
Andre Dawson, who's recovering from knee surgery, but the
cold had more to do with that than any training lacks. In his
absence, the team reverted to its "Rush Street Offense,"
consisting of lots of singles but little scoring. They strung
three singles to take a 2-1 lead in the bottom of the eighth
inning, then called in Mitch "Wild Thing" Williams, their
scary, left-handed reliever, to hold the Phils.</p>
<p>In last year's opener, also against Philadelphia, Williams
loaded the bases with none out in the ninth inning before
retiring the next three batters to get his save. This time,
bare-armed despite the cold, he put runners on first and
second bases, and messed up a possible double play by failing
to cover first on a ground ball, before getting pinch-hitter
Randy Ready to end things by popping out to right field. The
cheer that greeted that development was made up of equal
parts of joy and relief.</p>
<p>Asked later how he kept warm out there, Williams said he
"found the two biggest guys on the bench and sat between
them." When the questioner said he meant how he kept warm on
the mound, Williams shrugged. "I didn't think of cold or
warm, or anything else. I just pitched," he said.</p>
<p>Sounded to me like baseball as usual.</p>
