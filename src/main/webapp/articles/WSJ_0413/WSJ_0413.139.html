	<p class="article-leader">Despite a 57% boost in fiscal first-quarter sales, ICN
Pharmaceuticals Inc., Costa Mesa, Calif., reported a net loss
of $6.5 million, or 54 cents a share. A year ago, the company
reported net income of $2.9 million, or 19 cents a share.
   The company said it had an operating loss of $7.8 million,
due to unfavorable currency adjustments stemming from a weak
dollar, realized investment portfolio losses, increased
expenses due to its 1989 acquisition of Flow Laboratories,
and intensified marketing by pharmaceutical companies. A year
earlier, earnings from operations totaled $722,000.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>For the quarter, ended Feb. 28, the company reported
extraordinary credits of $1.3 million, compared with
year-earlier extraordinary credits of $2.2 million. Shares
outstanding declined to 11,984,000 from 15,299,000.</p>
