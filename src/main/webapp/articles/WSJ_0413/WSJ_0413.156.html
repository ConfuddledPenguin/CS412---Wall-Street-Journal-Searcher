	<p class="article-leader">McCaw Cellular Communciations Inc., Kirkland, Wash., said
LIN Broadcasting Communciations Inc. is negotiating with
Metromedia Inc. on a proposed modification in terms of LIN's
$1.9 billion proposed acquisition of certain Metromedia
cellular-phone interests in Philadelphia and New York.
   McCaw has a controlling interest in LIN.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>A McCaw spokesman declined to say why the talks started,
or who made the proposal. But McCaw, a cellular-phone
company, said the proposal calls for LIN to pay Metromedia
$1.05 billion in cash and $850 million in stock of a LIN
subsidiary. The proposal also calls for Metromedia to buy
from LIN a 1.01% interest in a cellular system serving
Philadelphia. LIN owns 51% of the system.</p>
<p>The original terms called for LIN to pay the full $1.9
billion in cash. McCaw said that if the new terms aren't
accepted, the original deal will remain unchanged.</p>
<p>In over-the-counter trading yesterday, LIN closed at
$68.50, up 50 cents.</p>
