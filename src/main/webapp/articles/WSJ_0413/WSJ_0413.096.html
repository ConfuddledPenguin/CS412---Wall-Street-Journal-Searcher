	<p class="article-leader">NEWARK, Calif. -- Ross Stores Inc. said its sales for the
five weeks ended April 7 rose 6% to $70 million from $66
million a year ago.
   Sales at stores open more than a year fell 6%. For the two
months ended April 7, the retail chain said sales rose 7% to
$113 million from $106 million. Sales at stores open more
than a year slipped 5% for the two months.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Ross said the decline in sales open more than a year was
partly due to the timing of the Easter holiday, which was in
March last year.</p>
