	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- Japan has offered to lower tariffs on some
wood products but not quickly enough to ensure the early
completion of an accord with the U.S. to eliminate Japanese
trade barriers in these commodities.
   U.S. officials, acknowledging Tokyo's increasing
flexibility on the tariff issue, said the chances of a
comprehensive forest-products accord currently "look a little
better" than they did when negotiations started in Tokyo this
week. But they also indicated that the talks may have to be
extended until after the Easter holidays.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Individuals in the forest-product industry, who are
following the talks closely, said the Japanese offer includes
the lowering of wood-product tariffs that currently range
from 5% to 20%. However, the reductions would be phased in
over periods of one to two years.</p>
<p>Sen. Max Baucus (D., Mont.), chairman of the Senate
subcommittee on international trade, said he is concerned
about the proposed "extremely long-term phaseout period."
U.S. producers, he added, want "meaningful and immediate
access to the Japanese market."</p>
<p>If the wood-products issue isn't settled by the middle of
June, the U.S. could impose trade sanctions on Japan under
the so-called Super 301 provision of the 1988 U.S. trade act.</p>
