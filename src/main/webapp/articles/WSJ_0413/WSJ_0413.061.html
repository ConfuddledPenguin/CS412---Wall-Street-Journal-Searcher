	<p class="article-leader">HAMBURG, West Germany -- The West German oil industry
plans to invest between seven billion and 10 billion Deutsche
marks ($4.19 billion to $5.98 billion) in East Germany,
according to the West German Petroleum Association.
   The trade group said that the money will be primarily
invested to expand the network of gasoline stations in East
Germany and to promote the use of heating oil as a cleaner
fuel source than soft coal, which is most frequently used.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The number of gas stations in the East German network
should be increased to about 3,000 from the current 1,250,
the association said.</p>
