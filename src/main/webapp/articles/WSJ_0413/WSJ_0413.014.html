	<p class="article-leader">THE HAGUE, the Netherlands -- The unification of the two
Germanys will help the Dutch economy continue to grow through
1991 with a subsequent reduction in unemployment, but the
government deficit will continue to widen, according to the
official economic forecast for 1991 issued by the Dutch
Central Planning Bureau.
   "For this year and the next, the economic prospects for
the Netherlands are fair. Economic growth is steady,
employment continues to increase, unemployment is on the wane
and inflation remains within limits. One note out of tune
seems to be the high real interest rate, associated in
particular with the happenings in Germany," the CPB wrote in
its annual spring forecast.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"Not only does it have negative consequences for
residential construction, it also combines with the effects
of the tax setback of 1989 to aggravate the financial
problems facing the government in 1991," the CPB said.</p>
<p>The country's total output of goods and services will
expand 3.25% in 1990 and will subsequently slow slightly in
1991 to a rate of growth of 3.0%, according to the CPB
projections. Employment, which is expected to increase by
100,000 jobs in 1990, is expected to grow by a further 75,000
jobs in the following year.</p>
<p>However, the CPB projected that the Dutch government will
fail in its efforts to reduce the government deficit.</p>
<p>In fact, because of shortfalls in taxes, a higher
interest-rate burden and no further income for the sales of
governmental stakes in businesses currently planned, the
public financing deficit is likely to expand as a percentage
of net national income, the CPB said.</p>
<p>Even though the overall Dutch economy will show healthy
growth through 1991, not all sectors of the economy will
benefit.</p>
<p>In particular, construction, agriculture and food
industries all are expected to show below-average expansion
through 1991, although for different reasons.</p>
