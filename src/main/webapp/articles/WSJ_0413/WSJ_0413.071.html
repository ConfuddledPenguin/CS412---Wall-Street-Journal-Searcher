	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- Marriott Corp. reported first-quarter
earnings dropped 39%, reflecting continued overcapacity in
the lodging industry.
   Sales for the first quarter increased 3.5% to $1.68
billion, from $1.63 billion.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Net income for the quarter ended March 23 fell to $28
million, or 27 cents a share, compared with $46 million, or
41 cents a share, a year earlier. Results for the
year-earlier quarter included profit from discontinued
operations of $8 million, or seven cents a share, for two
restaurant businesses that are being sold. That quarter also
included $5 million, or five cents a share, from airline
catering operations that were divested in December, and $8
million, or seven cents a share, in lodging transaction
gains.</p>
<p>Excluding effects of discontinued operations and one-time
gains, Marriott said profit from continuing operations
increased 14% during the 1990 first quarter. Per-share
earnings from continuing operations increased 23% in the
latest quarter, the company said.</p>
<p>J. W. Marriott Jr., chairman and president, said the
company expects to complete the sale of its Roy Rogers
fast-food restaurant during the 1990 second quarter, and has
received strong interest from potential buyers of its family
restaurant operations.</p>
<p>Mr. Marriott said lodging operating profit was up 11%,
excluding transaction gains in the year-earlier quarter.
Occupancy for comparable hotels increased 2% to the upper 70%
range. Contract services operating profit was up 19% in the
first quarter, excluding gains from divested airline catering
operations.</p>
