	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- Hostile federal regulators prevented Lincoln
Savings & Loan Association from raising capital even as they
criticized the thrift for being short of capital, the
chairman of Lincoln's former parent claimed in court
testimony.
   Charles Keating, chairman of Phoenix-based American
Continental Corp., also suggested that the hostility of the
regulators was fueled by a feud Mr. Keating had with a thrift
trade group executive who is the father of one of Lincoln's
regulators.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Lincoln, based in Irvine, Calif., was seized by the
government a year ago, and regulators say cleaning up the
thrift will cost the government about $2 billion. Mr. Keating
was testifying in his suit against the regulators to reverse
the takeover.</p>
<p>Mr. Keating said that under a 1988 agreement with
regulators, Lincoln was to raise $50 million to $150 million
in capital by offering subordinated debt. But when Lincoln
applied to offer the debt, the regulators "simply wouldn't
process it," Mr. Keating said. In December 1988, the
regulators told Lincoln they were $114 million short of
capital requirements, said a lawyer for Mr. Keating, John
Lundin.</p>
<p>When Lincoln tried to argue that a mathematical error by
the regulators had added $65 million to the shortfall, the
regulators wouldn't listen and forced Lincoln to issue a news
release about the capital problem that hurt the thrift's
value, Mr. Keating said.</p>
<p>"They complained we didn't have enough capital, but
wouldn't let us raise capital," Mr. Lundin said in an
interview.</p>
<p>But lawyers for the government said they held up the debt
offering because Lincoln intended to sell at least part of
the debt in $2,000 chunks in Lincoln offices, which might
attract unsophisticated investors. Customers might not have
known they were buying risky debt and not making insured
deposits, said James Murphy, an attorney for the regulators.
About $200 million of now-worthless American Continental debt
was sold through Lincoln branches.</p>
<p>Also, Mr. Murphy said, federal regulators had at that
point discovered the controversial tax-sharing agreement
under which Lincoln paid $94 million to American Continental
for tax payments that were never made. The regulators were
"suspicious of Lincoln" and wanted to finish an exam of
Lincoln before deciding on the debt offering, Mr. Murphy
said.</p>
<p>Mr. Keating also said he was surprised to learn in late
1988 that Kevin O'Connell, a regulator overseeing the 1988
exam of Lincoln, is the son of William O'Connell, a former
president of the U.S. League of Savings Institutions, an
industry trade group. William O'Connell had criticized Mr.
Keating for opposing a regulation limiting the amount of
direct investments in real estate that thrifts could make.
Mr. Keating had one of his attorneys write to the trade group
president and accused him of "defamatory comments."</p>
<p>Mr. Lundin, the Keating lawyer, said he wasn't directly
accusing Kevin O'Connell of a conflict of interest, but said
"it shows the atmosphere in which this all took place." Mr.
Lundin introduced a memo written by the younger Mr. O'Connell
just a week before the government takeover, that said of
Lincoln: "under every document is another scam," and that
regulators "finally understand what type of thieves we are
dealing with . . . ."</p>
<p>Kevin O'Connell, now an official of the Office of Thrift
Supervision, said "whether somebody is for or against a
regulation has nothing to do with whether I enforce it or
not." He said he hadn't been aware of the dispute between his
father and Mr. Keating.</p>
<p>Testimony in the trial is to continue next week.</p>
