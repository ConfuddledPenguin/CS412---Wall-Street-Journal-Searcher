	<p class="article-leader">Arbitration Settles
   A Lot, Unsettles a Few</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>THE VERDICT is still out on the booming field of "dispute
management," in which disagreeing parties go to an arbitrator
instead of the courts.</p>
<p>Robert Coulson, president of the American Arbitration
Association, calls dispute management "the buzz word for the
1990s."</p>
<p>With the heavy backlog in both federal and state courts,
it's not surprising that independent arbitration filings grew
to some 90,000 in 1989. The arbitration association, the
largest of some 600 socalled alternative dispute-resolution
groups, reported 55,520 case filings last year, a jump of
more than 36% from 1980.</p>
<p>Business arbitrations with the association almost doubled
to 12,220 last year from 6,140 in 1980, and represented $2.41
billion in claims and counterclaims. Disputes over
construction, securities, computer software, labor and
insurance make up the bulk of business cases. Increasingly,
contracts spell out that any dispute will go to arbitration.</p>
<p>Not everyone is excited about the rush to settle disputes
outside the courts. Judith Resnik, professor of law at the
University of Southern California, argues that independent
arbitration raises "serious questions about power and
justice" and that the privatization of justice doesn't
necessarily translate into the better administration of
justice.</p>
<p>Arbitration, she says, favors the well-to-do, such as
large companies, which "can afford to go out and hire an
arbitrator or set up a system of arbitration."</p>
<p>And studies recently done by Rand Corp. show that while
court-supervised arbitration programs are popular, they may
not actually save time or money, a key reason for avoiding
the courthouse in the first place.</p>
<p>Paralegal Jobs Thriving</p>
<p>In Atmosphere of Thrift</p>
<p>LAW FIRMS and corporate law departments continue to bring
paralegals on board at swift rates.</p>
<p>The number of paralegals, or legal assistants, in law
firms increased 18% in 1987 and 16% in 1988, says a study by
Ernst & Young's legal consulting group.</p>
<p>The 300 law firms surveyed had an average of one paralegal
for every four attorneys and paid paralegals an average
salary of $31,000. Paralegals logged an average of 1,350
billable hours a year, and clients were billed $41 to $60 an
hour for their time finding documents and carrying out other
tasks that don't require a lawyer.</p>
<p>With the dropoff in big-dollar mergers and other deals,
large law firms are facing a new economic reality, according
to Robert J. Berkow, national director of legal consulting
services for Ernst & Young and chief author of the study.
"Paralegals are a key ingredient in achieving savings in
cost, timeliness and even quality," Mr. Berkow says.</p>
<p>In corporate law departments, the number of paralegals
increased nearly 10% in 1988. Company legal departments
employ one paralegal for every two attorneys, perhaps because
of limits on the numbers of attorneys corporations can hire
and the more routine nature of corporate legal work, the
study theorizes.</p>
<p>Law Schools' Fall Down</p>
<p>On Minority Recruiting</p>
<p>DESPITE GUNG-HO recruiting efforts by the nation's law
schools, the number of black, Mexican-American and Puerto
Rican law students has increased only slightly in the past 12
years.</p>
<p>According to the American Bar Association, members of
these three minority groups account for only 7%, or 8,456, of
the 120,694 students enrolled at the 174 ABA-accredited law
schools.</p>
<p>While the number of black students rose about 5% in the
past six years to 6,321, and the number of Puerto Rican
students increased about 10% to 478, the number of
Mexican-Americans in law school actually dropped about 100
students to 1,657 from its peak in the early 1980s.</p>
<p>By contrast, the number of Asian-American students more
than doubled in the past decade, from fewer than 1,400 in
1977 to 3,133 in the '88-'89 school year.</p>
<p>Considering the much-ballyhooed recruitment efforts of
schools, what's the reason? Some law professors point to the
scarcity of minority faculty members at law schools, saying
it's a turnoff for prospective students. "Of the more than
7,000 law professors in the country, only 28 or 29 are
Chicano or Puerto Rican," says Richard Delgado, a law
professor at the University of Wisconsin at Madison.</p>
<p>Harvard Law School Prof. Derrick A. Bell says the dearth
of minority faculty members "is even greater at the so-called
elite law schools." The University of Chicago Law School, he
points out, "has no minority faculty presence whatsoever."</p>
<p>Kathryn R. Stell, an admissions dean at the school, says
the absence of minority faculty "may be a factor for some
students" in whether to attend the school. She is also quick
to point out that 35 of the schools 550 students are black,
up from 15 in the 1985-1986 academic year.</p>
<p>Odds and Ends</p>
<p>LAWYERS SHOULD be required to use recycled paper for state
filings, a Chicago public interest law group tells the
Illinois Supreme Court. Petitioning the court, Business and
Professional People for the Public Interest notes that the
panel already regulates the size and quality of paper filed.

<p>Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist calls for more postage
stamps featuring Supreme Court justices. The Postal Service
recently issued a stamp with Chief Justice John Marshall, his
fourth appearance. "When it comes to members of the court who
aren't John Marshall, the {stamp} pickings are pretty slim,"
Justice Rehnquist said recently.</p>
