	<p class="article-leader">CINCINNATI -- Midland Co.'s chairman, J.P. Hayden Jr.,
said first-quarter earnings were "significantly less" than
last year's quarter.
   In the year-earlier quarter, Midland had net income of
$3,050,000, or 91 cents a share. Revenue was $37,374,000.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Mr. Hayden said the company's property and casualty
operations experienced heavier than normal weather-related
losses, due to severe weather in Alabama and Mississippi in
February and March.</p>
<p>In addition, flooding along the Ohio and Mississippi
rivers and their tributaries hurt the company's barge
operations.</p>
<p>The company, a diversified insurance, finance and
transportation concern, expects to report first-quarter
results in about three weeks.</p>
