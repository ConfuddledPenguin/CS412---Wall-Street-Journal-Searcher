	<p class="article-leader">The crowds that cheer wildly when hostages are released
are joyful that the hostages' ordeal is over. Everyone shares
in that happiness. But France's dealings with Libya to gain
this release raise questions. Let us quickly note that the
French are not alone in having succumbed to the temptations
of over-sophisticated diplomacy. Some U.S. State Department
officials are so in love with their talks with the PLO they
are spinning in circles trying to turn a blind eye to recent
PLO terrorist activities. But the French are playing a
dangerous game by engaging in subtle minuets with the likes
of the Libyans, the Iranians, and the Iraqis. After the
Mirage shipments, a meeting with Yassir Arafat in Paris, a
friendly visit to Tehran and an offer to Iraq to help rebuild
the nuclear reactor Israel blew up in 1981, France's allies
have a right to wonder what all this subtle flirting is meant
to achieve. In France, the U.S. State Department, and
elsewhere, process is running policy. Those who try to cuddle
with beasts often end up with their hands bitten off.</p>
