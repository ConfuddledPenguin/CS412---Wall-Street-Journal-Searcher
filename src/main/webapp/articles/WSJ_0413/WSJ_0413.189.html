	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Fuji Heavy Industries Inc. should press
forward with its efforts to acquire all the shares of Subaru
of America Inc. that it doesn't already own, a top executive
of Nissan Motor Co. said.
   "I feel it is necessary for Fuji to have a wholly owned
subsidiary in the U.S. instead of an independent
distributor," said Atsushi Muramatsu, Nissan's executive vice
president for finance. "I feel Fuji should go forward with
this purchase."</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Mr. Muramatsu's remarks are significant because Nissan is
rapidly taking a greater role in the affairs of financially
ailing Fuji. Fuji recently announced that Isamu Kawai, a
former senior executive of Nissan, will become the new
president of Fuji, pending expected shareholder approval in
June. Nissan is Fuji's largest shareholder with a 5.9% stake.
Fuji and Nissan both are part of the industrial group led by
the Industrial Bank of Japan, which itself owns another 4.9%
of Fuji.</p>
<p>Speculation that Nissan might ask Fuji to back away from
its efforts to buy Subaru hammered Subaru's stock on
Wednesday, when it dropped 87.5 cents a share to close at
$5.625 in national over-the counter trading. Yesterday,
however, the stock recovered to close at $6.125, up 50 cents.</p>
<p>In January, Fuji offered to pay $147 million, or $6 a
share, for the 50.4% interest in Subaru of America that it
doesn't already own. Subaru said it would form a special
committee of non-Fuji directors to consider the offer, but
since then nothing has happened. Subaru, it's widely
believed, would like to draw a higher bid from Fuji.</p>
<p>Subaru's sales plunged 35% in the first quarter to 24,575
cars from 37,768. The company launched its new Legacy model
with high hopes last year. But the Legacy competes directly
against such popular cars as the Honda Accord and Toyota
Camry.</p>
<p>Subaru of America officials couldn't be reached for
comment.</p>
