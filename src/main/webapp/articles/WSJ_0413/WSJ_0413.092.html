	<p class="article-leader">The day a story on expanding regulation ran in this
newspaper last November, George Bush sat down at his
typewriter and tapped out a note to chief of staff John
Sununu.
   "Surely we're not re-regulating," the president wrote,
underlining the word for emphasis. "If" -- another underline
-- "it is happening," Mr. Bush added, "maybe I should mention
it at a cabinet meeting."</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Well, maybe he should do something.</p>
<p>Six months after that presidential warning shot, the Bush
administration's re-regulators are back at the barricades.
White House sources not easily given to alarm say they
haven't seen anything like it since the Carter years. Even
discounting for hyperbole, this doesn't sound like the kind
of policy favored by the man who, as vice president, presided
over a task force to slash government red tape.</p>
<p>The battle is being waged over one of those Washington
jobs that sounds obscure but has real power. It's the White
House Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs. During
the Reagan years, this was the administration's main traffic
cop for regulation, a sanity check on bureaucrats. George
Bush's own task force gave the cop political support in
fights with the Reagan Cabinet.</p>
<p>Yet in the Bush White House, the cop is off the beat. The
post has been vacant for six months. Budget director Richard
Darman controls the office, but has other things to worry
about. And Sen. John Glenn (D., Ohio) is now pushing
legislation that would strip the office of much of its power.</p>
<p>Why should anyone care? Consider the bright ideas now
bubbling up from the bureaucracy:</p>
<p>-- Pedestrians struck by cars are often killed when they
land on the metal hoods. One proposal being studied would
require a rubber hood to cushion the blow, with a sandpaper
surface to keep victims from bouncing far off. Why didn't
Detroit think of that?</p>
<p>-- The Environmental Protection Agency has ordered cities
to recycle 25% of everything that now goes into incinerators.
Since recycling is difficult and often unpopular, this means
fewer cities will rely on efficient incinerators to dispose
of garbage.</p>
<p>Instead they'll dump more into landfills, which are
filling up too fast anyway. In any case, isn't this a choice
for the local voters who'll have to do the recycling?</p>
<p>-- The Department of Transportation wants to require all
new city buses to have wheelchair lifts for the disabled.
Expensive but possibly worth it -- except that DOT also wants
to require cities to provide taxi or van service for any
disabled person who, for a wide variety of reasons, can't
take the bus. Naturally, almost everyone will insist the bus
is somehow inconvenient and opt for a cab.</p>
<p>-- Another EPA idea would tighten up the already tight
rules for disposing of low-level nuclear waste. This sounds
good, until EPA lists the benefits. It turns out the change
will save from three to 13 cancer deaths over 10,000 years,
with one cancer prevented in the first 500 years.</p>
<p>Wags have dubbed this the "Christopher Columbus rule,"
since if it had applied in 1492 we'd soon be saving our first
cancer victim.</p>
<p>-- With EPA Administrator William Reilly off giving
speeches, his minions have floated the possibility of
toughening the nation's "ambient" air-quality standards. One
critic says the new standard for sulfur dioxide pollution is
designed for "an asthmatic, exercising near a power plant,
without medication, during peak emissions."</p>
<p>-- Agriculture regulators are proposing new rules to
better treat animals in laboratories. Hundreds of millions of
dollars will be diverted from medical research in order to
build new cages and assure that air is recycled more times
each day than even human hospitals require.</p>
<p>The point isn't that all regulations are this silly.
Obviously many are useful. The point is that without a
traffic cop there's no incentive not to be silly. No
regulator ever got promoted for not regulating. Cabinet
members who show restraint end up being described as a
"disappointment."</p>
<p>With tax and spend out of fashion, members of Congress now
try to expand their influence through regulation. Every new
rule purports to serve some noble goal, so private-sector
opponents seem selfish. Without an institutional check in the
government, there's no incentive for any restraint at all --
no matter how much a regulation costs.</p>
<p>Mr. Bush should also be worried about the loss of his own
powers. Killing the regulation cop means reduced control of
the executive branch by the White House. No wonder many on
Capitol Hill want to strip the job of any real power. As just
one example: Sen. Glenn's bill would in effect cancel the
regulatory cop's current power to review paperwork demands
every three years.</p>
<p>Fortunately, the re-regulation binge is drawing political
flak. U.S. Chamber of Commerce President Richard Lesher
recently sent a letter to President Bush decrying the
"troubling" trend. A bipartisan group of 13 senators --
liberal Arkansas Democrat Dale Bumpers, for one -- has sent
Mr. Glenn a letter urging that the regulatory office not be
gutted. Some White House aides also want Vice President Dan
Quayle's competitiveness council to have the same status that
Mr. Bush's task force had in the Reagan White House.</p>
<p>Presumably, George Bush believes his work as the
deregulation vice president was worth something. Presumably,
he'd like to consolidate that legacy as president. But on the
evidence so far, he'll have to do more than mention the
subject at a cabinet meeting.</p>
