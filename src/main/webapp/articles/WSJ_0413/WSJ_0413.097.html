	<p class="article-leader">NEWARK, N.J. -- Exxon Corp. was sued by the U.S.
government in federal court here, seeking penalties and
interest from fines the oil giant failed to pay for four
small oil spills in area waterways.
   The civil complaint isn't related to much-larger spills
that occurred in the same area in recent months, the U.S.
attorney said.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>According to the U.S. attorney, Exxon's Exxon Co. U.S.A.
unit, Linden, N.J., refused to pay a total $1,350 of fines
the Coast Guard imposed from 1985 to 1987 because the oil
company claims the minor spills didn't harm the environment.
The spills occurred in the Kill Van Kull and Arthur Kill
waterways, which separate New Jersey from Staten Island, N.Y.</p>
<p>Exxon couldn't be reached for comment. The New York
company and its Exxon Shipping Co. unit recently pleaded
innocent to five-count criminal indictments, charging them
with violating various federal laws in the nation's worst oil
spill a year ago. The tanker Exxon Valdez ran aground in
March 1989, spilling nearly 11 million gallons of crude oil
into Alaska's Prince William Sound.</p>
