	<p class="article-leader">DETROIT -- General Motors Corp. said it is recalling
62,000 1988-89 model cars equipped with its high-tech Quad 4
engine to fix defective fuel lines linked to 24 engine fires.
   GM said the 1988-89 Pontiac Grand Am, Oldsmobile Cutlass
Calais and Buick Skylark cars equipped with the 16-valve,
four-cylinder Quad 4 engine have fuel lines that could crack
or separate from the engines. Although GM has received
reports of 24 fires caused by leaks attributable to the
faulty fuel lines, a spokesman says the company knows of no
injuries resulting from the incidents. GM sold about 312,000
cars equipped with Quad 4 engines in the 1988-89 model years.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>In another action, GM said it is recalling about 3,200 of
its 1990 Oldsmobile Cutlass Calais and Buick Skylark models
to fix fuel-line defects on three engines: the Quad 4,
3.3-liter V-6, and 2.5-liter four cylinder. GM isn't aware of
any fires or injuries related to the fuel line problems in
this group of cars, the spokesman said.</p>
<p>All repairs will be done free of charge to owners, the
company said.</p>
<p>Separately, the U.S. sales arm of Volkswagen AG's Audi
subsidiary said it is recalling 1,600 1990-model Audi 80, 90
and Coupe Quattro luxury cars to replace a defective bolt in
the assembly that locks the steering when the car is parked.
The defective bolt could break, causing the steering wheel to
remain locked even after the driver starts the car and begins
to move it, the company said.</p>
<p>Audi said it received one report of a broken bolt, but
knows of no accidents related to the defect. The company said
replacing the bolt will take "less than two hours" and be
done for free.</p>
<p>Another 100 of the 1990 Audi Coupe Quattro models are
being recalled to inspect a securing clip on the seat hinges
that may not be properly installed.</p>
