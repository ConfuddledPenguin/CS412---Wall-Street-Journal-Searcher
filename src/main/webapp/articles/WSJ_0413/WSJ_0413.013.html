	<p class="article-leader">LONDON -- Hoping to pare staff turnover, a British
supermarket chain recently gave some 70,000 check-out clerks
a 16.5%, one-year pay increase.
   More highly skilled workers, such as elevator technicians,
also are in strong demand. Rail unions have rejected an 8.5%
contract offer, raising concerns that London commuters face a
second summer in a row of occasional transport strikes.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Britain's labor market is undeniably tight, and it's
likely to remain that way for some time, analysts say.</p>
<p>A doubling in key interest rates since mid-1988 hasn't
slowed the economy enough to halt job market growth. Now,
with another general election looming by 1992 and the ruling
Conservative Party trailing badly in polls, a further
tightening of monetary policy seems unlikely.</p>
<p>Because monetary policy is relatively tight, the labor
market's expansion is slowing. But analysts don't anticipate
a sharp rise in unemployment or much moderation in labor
costs.</p>
<p>"Labor-market pressures are easing, but not enough to push
down wage settlements or earnings," says Don Smith, an
economist at Greenwell Montagu.</p>
<p>Underlying the strong labor market is a resilient economy.
Britain isn't in danger of recession, even with bank base
rates at a nine-year high of 15%, economists say. As
elsewhere, demographics also affect the job-market outlook.
Because fewer young people will be entering the market,
growth in Britain's work force may decline to just 0.2% in
1992, down from 0.8% last year, according to Greenwell
Montagu.</p>
<p>Employment growth is slowing, though. Monthly declines in
the jobless total averaged 23,000 a month during the past six
months, about half the average monthly drop in the same
period a year earlier.</p>
<p>During February, the jobless total fell a mere 1,700, its
smallest monthly decline in four years; in March it dropped
by 6,000. "We probably are some months away from an increase
in unemployment," says John Shepperd, a director of S.G.
Warburg Securities Ltd. "In the near term, it will fall
further."</p>
<p>Ultimately, sharply rising labor costs will prompt
employers to trim work rolls, economists say. That may be the
case especially in non-manufacturing businesses, which
account for nearly three-fourths of total employment.</p>
<p>But net job losses this business cycle will be
significantly less than in the last, says Mr. Smith of
Greenwell Montagu.</p>
<p>He projects the unemployment rate will edge up to only
6.1% next year, compared with February's and March's 5.6%
level, and then begin to fall again. British unemployment
reached a recent peak of 11.3% in 1986.</p>
