	<p class="article-leader">JOHNSON & JOHNSON (East Brunswick, N.J.) -- Standard &
Poor's Corp. said it affirmed this health care company's
triple-A senior debt and related ratings following
announcement of a $125 million charge against its Latin
American operations. S&P said the "largely noncash charge
reflects costs mainly incurred in Argentina and Brazil,"
while the company's global diversification "limits the impact
of any one economy."</p>
