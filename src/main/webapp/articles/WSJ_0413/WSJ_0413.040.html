	<p class="article-leader">Hong Kong -- When Hong Kong's only Western mime, Jane
Watson, first came to Asia two years ago, she never would
have dreamed of making an audience feel insecure.
   As a student in Paris under Jacques LeCoq and mime master
Etienne Decroux, who also instructed Marcel Marceau, Ms.
Watson was taught to worry constantly about the audience. "I
learned that I should show myself, show my character, show
the style, show where you are, and do it very quickly so the
audience feels secure in what it's watching." But next month,
in a unique combination of Western mime, Japanese dance and
modern music, Ms. Watson hopes to frighten as well as
entertain her audience.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The 25-year-old Englishwoman shunned traditional education
in favor of an audience at an early age. She began to study
ballet at the age of three, and five years later was
arranging garden fetes so she could perform dance and mime
skits. "I didn't know it was mime at the time; I just loved
it and felt completely comfortable in front of an audience."</p>
<p>After seven years of ballet and one year of training in
traditional dance at the Arts Education School in England,
she became frustrated by the limitations of choreography and
enrolled in a movement-theater course in London. Inspired by
the technique's emphasis on self-expression and creativity,
she moved to Paris, where she studied mime for four years.
While visiting a fellow performer in Japan, she decided to
move there. "I wanted exposure to different audiences so I
could sharpen my performance skills. And the Japanese
appreciate Western things, so I knew I could find work
there."</p>
<p>Only when performing in Tokyo did she learn that it's not
easy to bore an audience. "You don't have to be pushing
something at them all the time. You can sit still, you can
take a position, you can lie down for 10 minutes, and it's
still possible to hold the audience's attention," she says.</p>
<p>She also studied Bhuto, a form of Japanese avant-garde
dance that she says is "ugly, frightening and quite grotesque
to watch . . . but people always seem to enjoy watching it
because it takes them places; it's like moving pictures or
looking at a piece of abstract art."</p>
<p>The most interesting aspect of Bhuto, she says, is that --
unlike mime -- the performer has no ego. Creating images in
his mind, the Bhuto dancer moves quietly and slowly. Ms.
Watson gives the example of an actress creating the image of
insects crawling between her toes. The performer appears to
be uncomfortable but gives the audience no explanation. That
the performer appears to be taking no notice of the audience
scares people, she says. "Many people are frightened because
you can't see the dancers' eyes . . . you can't see where the
movements are coming from; it's as though they're {the
performers} possessed."</p>
<p>Ms. Watson believes she is the first performer to blend
Bhuto with Western movement theater. "It's possible to mix
these art forms because they both work on the use of images
and so it's a natural progression, to me anyway, to combine
them.</p>
<p>"I think people are interested in seeing something new and
a bit exotic," she says. "Because of television,
advertisements and films, audiences are constantly dealing
with images now . . . people's minds can work much more
quickly now."</p>
<p>"Doris Jones' Diary," which Ms. Watson will perform Feb.
1-2 at the Fringe Club Theatre here, aims to give the
audience a steady stream of such images. "I want it to be
like flipping through the pages of a scrapbook . . . image,
image, image."</p>
<p>Written by Ms. Watson and with directing assistance from
Patrick Neville, a British actor, the solo uses Western and
Asian performance arts to trace the highs and lows of Doris's
life: theater clown for the playful scenes from Doris's
childhood and energetic snippets from her adolescence; mime
to re-create street scenes as Doris goes to the city to work;
and Bhuto to convey Doris's painful failure as a nightclub
singer.</p>
<p>With clear blue eyes and sharp facial features, Ms. Watson
creates scenes of extreme pleasure and excruciating pain. A
brilliant selection of music includes pieces such as
"Cabaret" to accompany her "dress-up-for-a-party" scene and
Philip Glass's dissonant "Knee 5" for her mechanical
movements of marriage and motherhood. She uses minimal props
and stage equipment, and during costume changes the audience
sees slides such as a teddy bear with her glasses, a hand
half-painted with nail polish and a pair of shoes next to a
baby.</p>
<p>The key to making "Doris Jones' Diary" work will be
masking the differences in the art forms, Ms. Watson says.
"The show is episodic, and I'm trying to get it so that
people don't say, `Oh, that was a bit of mime, that was a bit
of Bhuto, and that was a bit of clown.'"</p>
<p>Ms. Watson's first full-length theater production, "One
Day, Maybe Tuesday," was written and directed with a British
actress and performed in Tokyo last year. Although pleased
with the audience's reception, she decided it was time to
leave Tokyo. "I was tired of marketing myself only as a
Western performer; the Japanese want to see the Westerners do
Western shows. In Hong Kong, people are more exposed to
Western things, so I can try something new."</p>
<p>Ms. Watson plans to take her show to the Singapore Fringe
Festival in June and to the Bangkok Club Med Festival later
this year. "If it works," she says, "this blend also should
give me an advantage when I decide to go back to Europe and
America."</p>
