	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Assets of the nation's 508 money market funds
fell $667.6 million, to $389.86 billion, in the week ended
Wednesday, according to the Investment Company Institute, a
Washington-based trade association.
   "Weekly changes in assets of particular categories of
money market funds have been very small in recent weeks as
yields on funds and other short-term instruments have also
fluctuated within a very narrow range," said Jacob Dreyer,
vice president and chief economist at the institute. "This
stability of assets is especially noteworthy during the month
of April when flows of individual tax payments and refunds
would tend to impart volatility to money-market fund
balances."</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Assets of 246 general purpose funds rose $285.1 million,
to $133.52 billion, while assets of 102 broker-dealer funds
fell $706.5 million, to $165.08 billion. Assets of 160
institutional funds fell $246.2 million, to $91.27 billion.</p>
