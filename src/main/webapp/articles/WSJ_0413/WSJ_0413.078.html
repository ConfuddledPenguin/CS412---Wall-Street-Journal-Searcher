	<p class="article-leader">The nation's second-biggest banking company is plunging
into one of Wall Street's most tarnished businesses: limited
partnerships.
   Putting its reputation on the line, giant Chase Manhattan
Corp. says it plans to offer public limited partnerships to
its customers, including more than nine million credit-card
holders, later this year.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The bank will also expand its roster of privately placed
partnerships for wealthy, supposedly sophisticated investors,
an area in which it says it has already raised about $75
million since 1988.</p>
<p>Chase's move comes as the limited-partnership business,
which boomed in the 1980s, continues to unravel.</p>
<p>With mounting investor lawsuits and arbitration claims
over partnerships that have soured, sales of new public
partnerships have dropped drastically. First-quarter sales
fell 41.6% from a year earlier, to $990.2 million -- the
worst quarterly figures in eight years, according to Robert
A. Stanger & Co., a Shrewsbury, N.J., partnership-research
firm.</p>
<p>Designed as long-term investments, partnerships are a way
for investors to put money in everything from real estate to
movies; investors are supposed to get some current income
plus profits when the partnership liquidates, usually in
about 10 years. The risks are substantial because an
investor's money is tied up for such a long period of time,
and there is no guarantee that an investor will get any money
back.</p>
<p>Some limited-partnership experts say they're surprised
that Chase, which is second in assets only to industry leader
Citicorp, is expanding activity in limited partnerships just
as chastened Wall Street brokerage firms are pulling back.</p>
<p>The timing couldn't be worse, says Scott G. Miller, a
Houston partnership analyst. "It would be like a manufacturer
going into the Hula-Hoop business because it's bottomed out.
They {Chase} haven't caught on that the {partnership}
syndication industry is dead. It's rotting in the coffin."</p>
<p>But Chase officials say that by being careful, they can
succeed in an industry in which Wall Street has stumbled.</p>
<p>"The fact of the matter is, the partnership is a very
efficient investment vehicle as part of an investor's
portfolio," says Joseph E. Vincent, a Chase vice president
who runs the bank's investment-products group. "There are
material advantages to owning an investment in this form that
aren't in other forms."</p>
<p>As Chase sees it, the partnership industry is
controversial and misunderstood these days, because Wall
Street and other purveyors of partnership investments sold
poorly designed products and made unjustified claims.</p>
<p>Bank officials say they are being "very selective" in the
products they offer. For example, the five deals the bank has
offered privately came from 100 that it reviewed.</p>
<p>Mr. Vincent says the uproar over partnerships -- which
recently caused Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc., formerly Wall
Street's top seller of partnerships, to stop originating new
offerings -- creates an opportunity for Chase. "Not many
people are called by banks offering to sell limited
partnerships," he notes.</p>
<p>"When you buy from a broker, there's an implied caveat
emptor. When you buy from a bank, there's an implied
warranty," says Mr. Vincent. But he stresses that Chase's
sales force won't make the mistake of implying to customers
that partnership investments are risk-free. "We make sure all
the risk factors are right up on page one," he says.</p>
<p>The Chase move is part of a trend in which commercial
banks are selling more and more investment products to
clients, as the regulatory walls between banks and brokerage
firms continue to crumble.</p>
<p>"Banks are trying to do everything else brokerage firms
are doing. They can register their people to sell
partnerships easier than they can to sell stocks," says
Fuhrman Nettles, a vice president of Stanger. Still, Chase
could face rough going, Mr. Nettles says. "Even if you had
the best replacement for bottled beer, it would be hard to
sell it with the barrage of information coming out, almost
all of it negative."</p>
<p>The private-placement limited partnerships that Chase has
offered so far require a $50,000 minimum investment. Its most
profitable deal, completed just this week, was LINC Income
Partners II, a medical-equipment leasing partnership in which
Chase raised $16.7 million acting as co-placement agent.</p>
<p>Chase says it may expand its private deal offerings to oil
and gas, commodity-futures, real estate, venture capital and
"media."</p>
<p>Public partnerships, meanwhile, will allow Chase to tap a
wider market, because they can be sold to small investors,
often at $5,000 to $10,000 a pop. Chase says it wants to sell
as many different products as possible, and partnerships
create opportunities to sell other products to its customers.</p>
<p>Mr. Vincent stresses, however, that his sales force
doesn't work for commissions as Wall Street brokers do, so
they won't be pushing products on unsuitable investors. He
says Chase won't get involved in "high-risk" deals -- which
the bank defines as those that promise an annual return of
more than 20% to 25%. And he says Chase "requires the general
partners we work with to have proven track records."</p>
<p>Mr. Miller, the Houston partnership analyst, says Chase's
equipment-leasing partnerships have been selling well only
because many investors don't understand them. Real estate
partnerships have received the most negative publicity, but
"leasing partnerships have always been worse. It's just a
more gradual death," Mr. Miller says. Fewer leasing deals
have returned "even the passbook savings rate than any other
kind of partnership."</p>
<p>Chase's Mr. Vincent says it's unfair to tar all
partnerships or a certain form because of past failures.
"There are good stocks and there's bad stocks, and junk bonds
and government bonds. And within any product, there's a range
of quality."</p>
<p>While leasing partnerships have high yields, much of that
is a return of investors' own principal, because the
equipment is depreciating in value over the partnership's
seven to 12-year life. In the end, when those assets are
sold, investors rarely see any profits.</p>
<p>Mr. Nettles of Stanger, however, is more optimistic about
Chase's timing. "If you've got a better mousetrap, I guess
you can sell it almost any time."</p>
<p>Despite the partnership industry's current woes, Mr.
Nettles predicts the business "will slowly turn around, but
when I don't know. Syndicators who haven't gotten into
trouble by now will probably survive, but they aren't
necessarily going to be as big as they were."</p>
