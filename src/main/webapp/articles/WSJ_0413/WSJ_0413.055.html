	<p class="article-leader">TOKYO -- Corporate bankruptcies in Japan stayed at low
levels both in March and in the fiscal year ended March 31, a
private credit research agency said, reflecting continuing
strong business performances despite the simultaneous tumble
of the yen and Japanese stock and bond prices since the
beginning of this year.
   The agency, Teikoku Data Bank Ltd., said bankruptcies fell
36% in March from a year earlier to 503 cases, marking the
63rd consecutive month of year-to-year declines. The number
of bankruptcies was up 13% from February, climbing above 500
cases for the first time in four months. But this increase is
unique to March, Teikoku said, as most Japanese companies
settle their accounts for the year on March 31.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The value of liabilities left behind by the failed
companies totaled 73.2 billion yen ($463.4 million), down 35%
from the previous year, and down 3.7% from the previous
month. The number of businesses that went bankrupt with debts
of more than one billion yen rose to 13 from 11 a year
earlier and fell from 16 in February. The average value of
liabilities was 145.5 million yen, slightly more than the
year-earlier 142.9 million yen.</p>
<p>The number of companies that went bankrupt in fiscal 1990
totaled 6,653, down 29% from a year earlier. The total amount
of liabilities declined 39% to 1.146 trillion yen. This was
the first time in 17 years that the total cases fell below
the 7,000 mark. The amount of total liabilities was also the
lowest level in 16 years.</p>
