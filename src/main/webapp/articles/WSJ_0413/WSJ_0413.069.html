	<p class="article-leader">Early this year, the House Ways and Means Committee
released a controversial study that was widely interpreted as
indicating that affluent families were not paying enough
income tax, while poor families were paying too much Social
Security tax. The study has obvious political importance,
since the chairman of the committee, Dan Rostenkowski (D.,
Ill.), has proposed a tax increase of nearly 18% on the
highest-bracket taxpayers. And Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan
(D., N.Y.) has also proposed cutting Social Security taxes.
   Robin Hoods in the press quickly focused on a theme
implicit in the report: that the poor are worse off than
before and the rich better off. But there are some problems
with the statistics on which this assertion is based. In
particular, the report understates the income of the poor,
and so overestimates their tax rate; it overstates the
increase in the incomes of wealthy Americans, and so
understates their tax rate.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The slanting starts with the portrait of America's poor.
The press paid a lot of attention to the "news" that many
low-income families now pay more of their income in Social
Security taxes than in income taxes, as though that were
somehow scandalous. Yet Social Security taxes are larger than
income taxes for the working poor only because many of the
poor pay no income tax at all] This is thanks to an expanded
earned-income tax credit and doubled personal exemption, both
Reagan administration changes.</p>
<p>In any case, those in the bottom fifth of the income
distribution range as a whole could not be badly damaged by
Social Security taxes, since the Congressional Budget Office
calculates that only 16% of them hold full-time jobs all
year. Even the Ways and Means study shows that half the
taxpayers "earning" less than $10,000 a year paid no Social
Security tax, for the obvious reason that they did not work.</p>
<p>The study also assumes that half of the corporate profits
tax is borne by consumers, in the form of higher prices. The
study concludes that corporate taxes account for 11% of all
the taxes supposedly paid by the poorest fifth of the
population, but only 10% for the richest fifth. This
arbitrary assumption ignores competitive restraints on
business; if a business passed along as much of the costs of
the tax to consumers as the study assumes, it would price
itself out of the market. If the assumption made sense, some
politician would surely be proposing to slash corporate taxes
as a way to alleviate tax burdens on the poor.</p>
<p>The Ways and Means study has another big problem. It
simply excludes 2.4 million people in "families with negative
or zero incomes." As there were 500,000 more families in that
seemingly awful situation in 1980 than in 1990, excluding
them means the number of families remaining in the poorest
fifth appears to increase faster than the rest of the
population, by 12.5% rather than 10.9%. This illusion of a
faster increase in the number of "poor" families reduces the
measured growth of income per family.</p>
<p>This raises the question, though, of how 2.4 million
family members could possibly survive with a zero or negative
income. One way is by receiving in-kind benefits, such as
food stamps and public housing. Another is by receiving cash
benefits, such as the earned-income tax credit.</p>
<p>In the Ways and Means study, however, in-kind benefits
don't count at all, and any cash benefits that are counted
are apparently just treated as a "negative tax" rather than
as income. The estimated individual income tax rate for those
who have jobs (and pay Social Security tax) in the bottom
fifth is minus 2.3%. That is, rather than saying that someone
who makes $1,000 has $1,023 of income, after receiving cash
from the government, the study says his income is $1,000 but
his tax rate is minus 2.3%.</p>
<p>It is also well known that much of the income that is
counted among the 18% of the households remaining in the
"bottom fifth" is vastly understated. Census Bureau surveys
acknowledge that about a fourth of the income from pensions
and from Aid to Families with Dependent Children is routinely
unreported. Since all in-kind benefits and many cash benefits
are not counted as income, Social Security, excise and
corporate tax rates on the bottom fifth of the population
appear larger than they really are. To pay excise taxes as
high as estimated by this study, for example, the poor would
have to devote a huge share of their budgets to liquor,
tobacco and gasoline. That would be quite impossible without
either uncounted cash subsidies or uncounted in-kind aid that
frees up cash that otherwise would be needed for necessities.</p>
<p>Nearly all of the exaggerated increase in tax rates among
the lowest fifth is concentrated among "non-elderly
households without children." Although the study repeatedly
refers to "families," these "non-elderly households" consist
mainly of young single people, some of them students, and
many with uncounted financial help from their parents.</p>
<p>Mr. Rostenkowski's report has also served as the basis for
a second major complaint: that the rich have become richer,
while their tax burden has been shifted to the poor. "For the
lowest 20% of the population," claims the study, "real income
fell by 3.2% {from 1980 to 1990}, while the total federal tax
rate rose by 16.1%. By contrast, for the highest 20% of the
population, real income rose by 31.7%, while the total
federal tax rate fell by 5.5%."</p>
<p>In reality, this grossly overstates the increase in
incomes of the most affluent fifth of families, and
understates their tax rate. One "trick" here is that capital
gains are included as income in the year during which assets
are sold. This vastly exaggerates regular income, because
homes and lifetime savings are often sold in large lumps only
once or twice in a lifetime, particularly at retirement. Such
one-time capital gains surely account for the study's finding
that the number of elderly households in the most affluent
two-fifths of the population supposedly increased by an
astounding 46.4% during the bull market of the 1980s.</p>
<p>Yet counting one-time gains from the sale of assets as
regular income (while also excluding rental losses) is not
nearly sufficient to account for the estimate that real
income is "expected to rise by 31.7 percent" before taxes for
the highest fifth. Instead, what mainly accounts for the
illusion of such a huge income gain is that the Ways and
Means study adopts a bizarre, purely relative definition of
real income. Estimated income in the top fifth, it argues,
rose from 8.6 times the poverty level in 1980 to 11.3 times
the poverty level in 1990. The difference between 8.6 and
11.3 equals 31.7%. That is, people in the most affluent fifth
of the population are 31.7% better-off relative to poverty
than they were in 1980. By that same standard, though, the
entire population was likewise 18.7% better-off.</p>
<p>With average income up 18.7% -- relative to the poverty
level -- and the top fifth up 31.7%, the top fifth might
nonetheless be said to have beaten the average by 13
percentage points. Yet this too does not mean what so many
politicians think it means. It is not that incomes for
one-fifth of the families have risen about 13% more than
average (much less 31.7%), but rather that so many families
are now earning so much more money that it now takes a 13%
higher real income to be counted among the top 20%.</p>
<p>The percentage of families earning more than $50,000, in
1987 dollars, soared from 17.5% in 1980 to 22.9% in 1987. It
is obviously impossible to stuff 22.9% of all families into
the "top 20 percent." So, the amount of income needed to
reach the "top 20 percent" had to be raised from $47,609 in
1980 (in 1987 dollars) to $52,910 in 1987. Since the incomes
of those earning between $47,609 and $52,910 were no longer
counted among the "top 20 percent," incomes of those
remaining in that top group were obviously higher -- by
definition -- since the average was no longer diluted by
incomes below $52,910. It is not that "the rich are getting
richer," but that so many couples have surpassed a level that
used to be called "rich" that they cannot all fit within the
top fifth.</p>
<p>Despite the interpretation many have given reports like
this one, the truth is that the share of all federal taxes
carried by the most affluent fifth of taxpayers is
nonetheless estimated to have increased from 55.7% to 58.1%
since 1980, while the estimated burden on the poorest fifth
remained unchanged at a trivial 1.6%. Only in the topsy-turvy
world of Washington, where the worst numbers are the best
political weapons, could it be considered "unfair" to lift
more and more families above what was once the "middle
class," so that they could afford to pay a larger share of
taxes.</p>
