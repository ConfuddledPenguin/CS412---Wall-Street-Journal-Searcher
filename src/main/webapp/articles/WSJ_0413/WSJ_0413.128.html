	<p class="article-leader">Tesco PLC said fiscal 1990 pretax profit rose 31%, largely
helped by the sale of several stores and strong performances
by the company's new outlets.
   The U.K. food retailer said pretax profit in the period
ended Feb. 24 climbed to #361.6 million ($594.8 million) from
#276 million a year ago, just edging past the upper end of
analysts' expectations of #360 million.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The pretax figure includes #35 million of property
profits, "substantially in excess of previous years," the
company said. Property sales brought in #10.7 million of
profit a year ago.</p>
<p>The group recommended a final per-share dividend of 2.89
pence, which would bring the final payout to 4.3 pence a
share, a 23% gain from the fiscal 1989 dividend.</p>
<p>Profit after tax rose 36% to #253.8 million from #186.3
million, as per-share earnings climbed 22% to 13.8 pence from
11.3 pence. Sales rose 15% to #5.73 billion from #5 billion.</p>
<p>During the year, Tesco opened 22 stores while closing 17.
The company said it plans to continue to expand, with 23
outlets set to open this year.</p>
<p>Tesco was bullish about fiscal 1991 prospects, saying
current trading conditions are "satisfactory" and predicted a
profitable year.</p>
