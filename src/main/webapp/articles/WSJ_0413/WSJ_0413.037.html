	<p class="article-leader">HONG KONG -- The government said payroll expenses far
outstripped inflation in December, providing fresh evidence
of Hong Kong's wage spiral.
   Monthly wages in the manufacturing sector, the colony's
largest, climbed 16% in December from a year earlier, or 5.3%
after accounting for inflation. The increase was even more
marked in the trading, restaurant and hotels field, climbing
17%, or 6.2% in real terms. Payroll costs in the financial
services sector lagged behind, rising 13% in nominal terms
and 3% after inflation.</p>
