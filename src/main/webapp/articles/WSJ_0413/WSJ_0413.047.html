	<p class="article-leader">VAN NUYS, Calif. -- Pinkerton's Inc. said it was sued by
competitor Guardsmark Inc., a Memphis, Tenn., private
security services firm, alleging that Pinkerton's engaged in
unfair and deceptive trade practices.
   The suit involves Pinkerton's use of a personality
assessment test to screen security personnel. Guardsmark
claims that it has licensed the test from University of
Minnesota and that Pinkerton's has no such license.
Pinkerton's is a security and investigation firm.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The suit seeks to enjoin Pinkerton's from using the test
or advertising its testing program. It also seeks corrective
advertising by Pinkerton's to notify customers and the public
that Pinkerton's hasn't been authorized to use the test.</p>
<p>Gerard S. Brown, Pinkerton's executive vice president and
general counsel, said, "We believe this lawsuit to be
entirely without merit. Pinkerton subscribes to the highest
standards in its advertising and psychological testing
programs. We expect that the ultimate outcome of this
litigation will vindicate our practices."</p>
