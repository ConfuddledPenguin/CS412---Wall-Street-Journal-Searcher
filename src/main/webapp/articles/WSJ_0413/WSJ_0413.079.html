	<p class="article-leader">When a retired Air Force officer dropped into the Veterans
Administration hospital in Dallas in 1985, he only wanted his
hearing aid checked. Instead, he became the focus of an
assault on coronary heart disease.
   The veteran, known in medical literature only as G.R., was
told he needed surgery to correct a hearing disorder, and
thus was given a pre-operative blood test. It showed an
abnormally high level of low-density lipoprotein (LDL), the
"bad" form of cholesterol that predisposes people to heart
attack or stroke. The finding led in turn to Mr. R's
volunteering for an experiment involving a then-obscure
cholesterol-lowering drug.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>That, he recalls, "was when they found out I had this
screwball thing" -- a previously unknown defect in his LDL
cholesterol. It was a finding that has helped scientists
understand how, in some cases, cholesterol comes to be
elevated.</p>
<p>To heart researchers, that was excitement enough. But over
the last several months scientists in Dallas and San
Francisco have made even more startling discoveries. Mr. R's
defect is inherited; he has four blood relatives with the
same defective LDL cholesterol. Other persons have been found
with the same flaw.</p>
<p>And, most recently, scientists have identified a minute
alteration in a gene that they think is responsible.</p>
<p>Researchers now are trying to measure the prevalence of
Mr. R's defect in the population. A conservative guess is
that it is found in one in every 500 Americans. These people
are at high risk to develop coronary heart disease, or
atherosclerosis, the gradual clogging of the arteries with
fatty deposits.</p>
<p>Mr. R's defect is thought to be just one of perhaps scores
of genetic flaws that leave people prone to atherosclerosis,
a condition that claims 500,000 lives a year. This
susceptibility "varies widely," and "the basis for it is
largely genetic," says Jan Breslow, a molecular geneticist at
Rockefeller University in New York.</p>
<p>Uncovering more of these genetic defects would give
scientists priceless insight on exactly how cholesterol in
the blood often leads to artery blockage. It would also point
the way to new therapies. At the least, discovery of more
such gene defects should soon make it possible to identify
early in life, perhaps at birth, people likely to get heart
disease decades later; then they could be taught from
childhood to eat a low-fat diet, avoid cigarettes, get a lot
of exercise and otherwise behave so as to retard
atherosclerosis.</p>
<p>For researchers on this trail, Mr. R's case is emerging as
a landmark. At the time he showed up at the Dallas VA
hospital, two University of Texas scientists associated with
the hospital had recently spotted the footprints of one of
these mysterious genetic defects during human experiments
with a cholesterol-lowering drug called mevinolin. Mevinolin,
later renamed lovastatin, has become one of Merck & Co.'s
biggest sellers under the brand name Mevacor. But for several
years following its 1978 discovery, Merck feared it might
cause harmful side effects, and abandoned human trials. "At
the time it looked like mevinolin would never get off the
ground," recalls Scott M. Grundy, of the University of Texas
Health Sciences Center in Dallas.</p>
<p>He was among a handful of researchers who felt Merck was
being unduly cautious. They thought the drug had promise for
treating a rare disorder known as familial
hypercholesterolemia (FH), an inherited form of high blood
cholesterol that leads to heart attacks early in life.</p>
<p>"We went to Merck and asked for the drug to try" on FH
patients, Dr. Grundy says. "They said they would give it to
us, but we would have to get our own clearance" from the Food
and Drug Administration. Another researcher, D. Roger
Illingworth at the Oregon Health Sciences University in
Portland, also decided to launch a clinical trial in FH
patients.</p>
<p>Where other drugs had failed, mevinolin worked; LDL
cholesterol dropped 30% to 40%. Prodded by the insistent
Dallas and Portland researchers, Merck resumed human trials
of the compound in 1984.</p>
<p>Dr. Grundy and a colleague, Gloria Lena Vega, next decided
to test it in more typical coronary patients, people who had
moderately high cholesterol levels but not FH. The results
were puzzling.</p>
<p>Mevinolin was known to work in FH patients by boosting the
activity of "receptors" on liver cells that pulled LDL
cholesterol out of the passing blood. In four of the first 10
non-FH patients they tested, mevinolin seemed to work: The
rate at which LDL cholesterol disappeared from the
bloodstream jumped sharply. But in the other six, no such
effect was seen; LDL cholesterol continued to disappear from
the blood only slowly.</p>
<p>Perhaps, the two Texas scientists speculated, there was
something strange about these volunteers' LDL cholesterol
that prevented it from sticking to the receptors on their
liver cells.</p>
<p>It was about this time that Mr. R checked into the VA
hospital for ear surgery. His checkup showed a total blood
cholesterol level of 323 milligrams (per deciliter), he
recalls, or about 100 higher than doctors thought advisable.
"After my operation, they {Drs. Grundy and Vega} called me
and asked me to get in this experiment," Mr. R says. He and
14 other patients soon found themselves spending two weeks in
a special ward.</p>
<p>The scientists first measured how fast the volunteers' LDL
cholesterol was cleared from the bloodstream. They then took
LDL samples from medical students who had normal cholesterol
levels, injected this presumably normal LDL into Mr. R and
his fellow volunteers, and measured how fast it cleared the
bloodstream.</p>
<p>Mr. R was one of five volunteers in whom there was a
marked difference in the clearance of the two LDL samples.
The donated cholesterol was rapidly cleared from Mr. R's
bloodstream, indicating the receptors on his liver cells were
functioning normally. But his own LDL cholesterol cleared far
more slowly. There had to be something peculiar about it.</p>
<p>Dr. Grundy described these intriguing results to a
conference in Australia in 1985. One listener who perked up
was Robert Mahley, director of the Gladstone Foundation
Laboratories at the University of California, San Francisco.
"We were both seated in the front row, and when Scott
finished his presentation he sat down beside me," Dr. Mahley
recalls. "I turned to him and said, `Scott, I think you have
the patients we've been looking for.' "</p>
<p>He and colleagues in San Francisco were deeply involved in
one of the molecular mysteries of LDL cholesterol: figuring
out the structure of its protein component. Since fat and
cholesterol don't mix with water, the body, in order to
transport them around in the bloodstream, wraps LDL
cholesterol packets in a protein that can be grabbed by the
watery part of the blood. The protein is known as
apolipoprotein B100, or simply apo B-100.</p>
<p>Over the years, scientists had seen strong hints that apo
B-100 wasn't identical in all humans -- that there might, in
fact, be a dozen or more different versions. They suspected
that some of these variations could explain why some people
had high LDL cholesterol levels and coronary disease. Like
all proteins, apo B-100 is the product of a gene, so the
variations in apo B-100 would reflect inherited variations.</p>
<p>Dr. Mahley and his colleagues wanted to look at an
inherited variation of apo B100 associated with high LDL and
see how it differed from other apo B-100. Perhaps one of Dr.
Grundy's volunteers had the variation they were seeking.</p>
<p>Mr. R, it turned out, was a prime candidate, partly
because he had living relatives -- a son, two brothers, three
nieces and a grandniece -- who could be tested to see if his
strange LDL cholesterol was passed through the family
according to the laws of inheritance.</p>
<p>At this point, Drs. Grundy and Vega encountered a social
problem that may become common as scientists uncover the
genetic susceptibilities to diseases like heart disease or
cancer: the question of genetic labeling. Some of Mr. R's
relatives provided blood samples only with great reluctance,
fearing their careers might be hurt if an employer found out
their family had a predisposition to coronary disease. (When
Mr. R was interviewed he had no objection to use of his name,
but Dr. Vega wanted him kept anonymous to protect the
relatives.)</p>
<p>Samples of the R family's LDL cholesterol were forwarded
to the Gladstone Laboratories in San Francisco. Scientists
there faced a formidable problem. Apo B-100 is an incredibly
long string of more than 4,500 simple amino-acid molecules,
making it one of the largest and most complex proteins known.
The Gladstone scientists had to find out where, along this
molecular superstring, there might be an alteration that
could account for Mr. R's high LDL.</p>
<p>In a test-tube experiment, they found that Mr. R's LDL
cholesterol barely stuck to liver-cell receptors. This
indicated the problem was in the portion of apo B-100 that
was supposed to bind to the receptor. Other experiments then
traced the defective "binding site" to a stretch of about 100
amino acids located about three-quarters of the way down the
amino acid string.</p>
<p>Mr. R's apo B-100 genes were then plucked out of a blood
cell by another Gladstone team. Like anyone, he had two
copies of the gene, one from each parent. The researchers
essentially laid the two copies side by side and began
sifting through them, molecule by molecule. One copy appeared
to be identical to what scientists had seen in others and
hence was presumed to be normal.</p>
<p>But in the other copy of the apo B-100 gene, researchers
found that a single molecule was different. This minute
defect caused the variant gene to produce a protein that was
also different, by a single amino-acid molecule. Mr. R, in
other words, had two types of apo B-100 circulating in his
blood that differed by only a single amino acid out of
thousands.</p>
<p>When the researchers probed through the genes of Mr. R's
seven living relatives they found four with the same
single-molecule difference in their apo B-100 gene and
protein. Mr. R and his two brothers had inherited the variant
copy of the apo B-100 gene from one of their parents,
probably the father, who died of pneumonia; "my mother lived
100 years," Mr. R says. A brother also had passed the gene to
one of his three daughters, who, in turn, passed it to her
daughter.</p>
<p>The evidence so far indicates strongly that about half of
the LDL cholesterol in Mr. R and his affected relatives is
unable to stick strongly to liver-cell receptors because of
this tiny variation. The liver can't pull the LDL out of the
blood quickly, and it backs up in the bloodstream. The
discovery indicates that the tiniest molecular change deep
inside a gene can sabotage the battle against coronary heart
disease.</p>
<p>The experiment to add the final bit of proof of this
theory is now under way, Dr. Mahley says. The Gladstone
biologists are trying to induce the single-molecule mutation
in cells in the test tube, to see if they will produce an apo
B-100 that fails to bind securely to the liver-cell
receptors.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the call is now out to U.S. and European
clinics to check for others who might have the same genetic
defect. "So far, none have been found in Scandinavia but a
few have been found in England," suggesting there may be
geographical or ethnic differences in the prevalence of the
defect, Dr. Grundy says.</p>
<p>Among the more than 1,100 people checked so far, 10 have
been found with the same defect as seen in Mr. R, and each
has one or more relatives with it, Dr. Mahley says. A random
sampling of the population to determine the defect's
prevalence is under way.</p>
<p>Mr. R himself hasn't yet had any signs of heart trouble,
but one brother had a heart attack several years ago and the
other more recently had a stroke. "I'm on two of these
lovastatin pills a day and I don't eat any eggs or fatty
meats," Mr. R says. His cholesterol level has dropped by 100
milligrams to the 220 to 230 range, reducing his odds of a
heart attack to the moderate to average risk range.</p>
