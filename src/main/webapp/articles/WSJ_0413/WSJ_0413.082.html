	<p class="article-leader">SUMMIT SNAG? Stiffer Soviet stances threaten to delay arms
agreements.
   Soviet concessions on long-range missiles have stopped,
U.S. officials say. Meanwhile, Soviet negotiators at talks in
Vienna on conventional forces appear to have gone without
instructions from Moscow for weeks. The result may be to slow
goals of wrapping up a strategic-arms treaty by the
Bush-Gorbachev summit in late May and a conventional-weapons
accord by November.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Baker and other Bush advisers remain upbeat. They dismiss
as bargaining tactics recent Soviet efforts to backtrack on
tough issues such as sea-launched U.S. cruise missiles. U.S.
officials predict easier going when Baker goes to Moscow for
a last round of strategic-arms negotiations in May.</p>
<p>Still, the White House begins sending out signals that a
full strategic-arms treaty wasn't expected by the summit.</p>
<p>DEFENSE CUTS are put on hold in the Senate until Nunn
takes the lead.</p>
<p>The Senate Armed Services Committee chairman carefully
avoids tipping his hand about which weapons he wants cut,
angering contractors and other lawmakers. Budget Committee
leaders wait for clear signals from him before voting to
shrink Bush defense proposals. Friends say the Georgia
senator is analyzing Pentagon data and taking political
soundings before acting.</p>
<p>Nunn's support for two mobile nuclear missiles may be
eroding. He urges the White House to trade away the
rail-based MX missile for Soviet concessions to stop
deploying their own versions. He is likely to seek cuts in
Bush's $3 billion request for the MX and Midgetman missiles.
He hints about trimming requests for Air Force F-16 jets and
Army anti-tank missiles.</p>
<p>NEW DOUBTS about the economy add to worries about the
deficit and S&Ls.</p>
<p>Recent signs of weakness mean the White House may have to
revise its economic forecast downward in July. If so, the
resulting budget cuts needed to fit the deficit target could
be so large that Congress will try to get around the
Gramm-Rudman law. A new survey of business economists finds
only 20% expect next year's deficit to actually end up below
the target.</p>
<p>A weaker economy also worsens the thrifts problem. Real
estate seized by the feds proves hard to sell. S&L deposits
grow slowly. And the government pays higher interest rates
than expected to borrow the billions needed for the bailout.
Heavy short-term borrowing for working capital will swell the
midsummer deficit forecast under Gramm-Rudman rules.</p>
<p>One possible deficit quick fix: The administration soon
may back a bill to exclude working capital from Gramm-Rudman
calculations.</p>
<p>IRAN-CONTRA PROSECUTOR Walsh plans a report to Congress
that could provide new insights about former President
Reagan's role in the scandal. Walsh is considering a broader
report than is required by law in an effort to shed light on
secret White House actions that remain murky despite seven
convictions.</p>
<p>ODD COMRADES: As conservative North Carolina Sen. Helms
seeks to suspend duties on an ingredient of the anti-ulcer
drug Zantac made in his state, Zantac's British-based
producer dickers to make the drug also in a Soviet factory in
partnership with state-owned Karl Marx Kombinate. The Helms
bill, an aide notes, affects only the U.S. unit that makes
the drug here.</p>
<p>CLASHES LOOM on the House Commerce Committee between
chairman Dingell and Rep. Waxman on responding to the
generic-drugs scandal. Waxman aides seek uniform penalties
for misdeeds by makers of generic and of brand-name drugs.
Dingell's staff, hoping to avert a fight with the
pharmaceutical industry, would limit rules to generic drugs.</p>
<p>CIVIL-RIGHTS GROUPS press Bush not to oppose a bill to
supersede five Supreme Court rulings making job bias harder
to prove because he objects to parts of the measure. Activist
Ralph Neas warns that Bush would join "Andrew Johnson and
Ronald Reagan as the only presidents in American history to
veto a civil-rights bill."</p>
<p>PENSION TENSIONS spur bills to head off a potential
S&L-like crisis.</p>
<p>Lawmakers, spooked by the S&L scandal, move to protect the
nation's $2.7 trillion in pension funds. A leading bipartisan
proposal by Sens. Kassebaum and Metzenbaum would restrict
employers' ability to terminate pension plans and to tap
excess funds for corporate use. Rep. Lantos considers a bill
to prevent companies from underfunding pension plans.</p>
<p>Chances are good for a planned enforcement bill based on
Labor Department proposals. It would increase pension-fund
audits and the fines for law violations. Currently, pension
funds are "highly vulnerable to fraud and abuse," warns
Raymond Maria, the department's acting inspector general.</p>
<p>But a bill by Sens. Kassebaum and Dole aimed at curbing
short-term stock trading by pension funds faces strong
opposition.</p>
<p>MINOR MEMOS: Texas pundits call Ann Richards's decisive
win in the state's nasty Democratic gubernatorial primary "a
mudslide." . . . Priorities: The same day the GAO raised the
S&L bailout's estimated cost to $243 billion, regulators at
the Federal Home Loan Bank of New York issued a news release
welcoming the baseball season. . . . Nyet to Maine? Bush
wants to take Gorbachev to his Kennebunkport vacation home,
but Soviet planners seem cool to the idea.</p>
