	<p class="article-leader">A big buy program and an upbeat earnings outlook for
International Business Machines put some sparkle into an
otherwise dull stock market, while bond prices eased in a
shortened pre-holiday session.
   The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 22.07 points to
2751.80. But the gains came on light volume and were
concentrated in blue-chip issues. Broader market averages
gained only modestly. For the week, the industrial average
rose 34.68 points. The stock market is closed today.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Bond trading was muted too, with little to drive the
market ahead of today's release of the March producer price
index, a measure of wholesale inflation. The bond market was
open only part of yesterday and is closed today for the Good
Friday holiday. The dollar ended narrowly higher in late
afternoon New York trading.</p>
<p>Analysts said a buy program early in the day boosted stock
prices sharply. But trading activity quickly waned after the
initial flurry, leaving prices stalled at the higher levels.
Speculation that IBM's first-quarter profit, to be reported
Monday, will be better than expected, helped sustain the
higher prices, as did demand for blue-chip oil stocks. Smith
Barney, Harris Upham raised its estimate of IBM's
first-quarter results by 10 cents a share to $1.70 a share
and reiterated a buy recommendation.</p>
<p>A report yesterday that retail sales in March fell 0.6%
had little noticeable impact on the stock and bond markets,
although economists had predicted sales would be flat.
Similarly, economists are looking for the March producer
price index to be about flat.</p>
<p>The dollar remained locked in a narrow trading range.
Rumors that the Bank of Japan might push interest rates
higher during the long weekend failed to depress the U.S.
currency against the yen. Traders said central-bank
intervention in the past week to support the yen against the
dollar hasn't had much effect. But they said a return to
normal trading volume next week will be necessary to
determine the underlying strength of the dollar.</p>
<p>In major market action:</p>
<p>Stock prices climbed in light trading. Volume on the New
York Stock Exchange totaled 142.5 million shares. Advancing
issues on the Big Board were ahead of decliners 908 to 573.</p>
<p>Bond prices slipped. The benchmark 30-year Treasury fell
less than a quarter of a point, or less than $2.50 per $1,000
face amount. The yield rose to 8.59%.</p>
<p>The dollar edged higher. In late New York trading, the
currency was quoted at 1.6724 marks and 158.18 yen, vs.
1.6715 marks and 158 yen Wednesday.</p>
