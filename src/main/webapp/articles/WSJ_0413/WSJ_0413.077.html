	<p class="article-leader">Alaskan shores contaminated by oil from the tanker Exxon
Valdez could have been cleaned far more effectively with a
new detergent-producing microbe than the hot water spray that
was used, according to a group of microbiologists.
   The researchers from the biotechnology division of the
U.S. Army Chemical Research and the University of Illinois
said the new microbe performed successfully in a test on
oil-soaked gravel and stones collected from Prince William
Sound, the site of the Exxon Valdez spill.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"Our results show that the microbial surfactant can remove
three times as much oil as water can," said A.M. Chakrabarty,
a microbiologist at the university, who led the experiment.
Mr. Chakrabarty, while at General Electric Co., developed the
first genetically engineered microbe to be patented.</p>
<p>The experiment with Valdez oil, however, didn't involve a
genetically altered microbe. A public unease over the release
of such man-made organisms in open environment has prevented
the use of such bacteria. The researchers instead used a
strain of natural bacteria, called Pseudomonas aeruginosa,
that was forced through a natural selection process to live
on solid and liquid hydrocarbons that are the building blocks
in oil.</p>
<p>Mr. Chakrabarty also said that by the time his group
finished its experiment Exxon was already far into its
cleaning process with warm water jet sprays and an army of
scrubbers. He said his team nevertheless suggested the
microbial solution to the oil company, but "we didn't get a
favorable response."</p>
<p>Robert Mastracchio, technical manager at Exxon Alaska
Operations in Anchorage, said that only 74 miles of the 1,089
miles of coastal lines Exxon cleaned last year were suitable
for biological remediation. The company has been using
special chemical fertilizers there to stimulate the local
bacteria to speed up the degradation nature does on its own.
He said that Exxon didn't think "it was necessary" to
introduce foreign bacteria. "It raises questions about what
impact it will have on the environment," he said.</p>
<p>The bacteria clean up the oil just as common dishwashing
soap pulls grease out of water. Oil is insoluble in water.
But the soap emulsifies the grease into tiny droplets that
can be grabbed by water molecules and dragged down the drain.
Using the same trick, the Pseudomonas aeruginosa first
releases a soap-like surfactant to emulsify the oil into tiny
droplets. That allows the bacteria to take up the oil, which
they then convert into carbon dioxide and water.</p>
<p>In their experiment, the researchers washed paired batches
of the oil-coated Alaskan gravels, one batch in each pair
with water and the other with a 1% solution of Pseudomonas
aeruginosa surfactant. They then repeated the process at
several different temperatures on a scale from 10 to 80
degrees Celsius. In their report, published in the latest
issue of Bio/Technology journal, the researchers said the
surfactant removed at least twice as much oil as did water at
every temperature tested.</p>
<p>The surfactant removed three and a half times as much oil
as water at 40 degrees, and 2.4 times at 50 degrees.</p>
<p>The report suggested that surfactant may be particularly
useful at low temperatures, which make oil dispersal with
water difficult. At 30 degrees, for instance, water removes
only 5% of the oil. At that temperature, the surfactant
solution removes three times as much oil within a minute
after contact. Mr. Chakrabarty said that higher concentration
of the microbial solution cleans more oil, but adds
significantly to the cost.</p>
<p>He said a big advantage the microbial surfactant has over
chemical surfactants is that it's nontoxic and biodegradable.
The oil released with warm water tends to go back into the
sea unless special measures are taken to contain it.</p>
<p>"We think that microbial surfactant is the only ecological
acceptable way to tackle oil spills in coastal areas," Mr.
Chakrabarty said.</p>
<p>The use of microbes to treat oil pollution and hazardous
waste, as well as for oil recovery from deep wells, is
getting increasing attention from researchers. That's because
traditional remedies, which involve chemical treatment or
incineration, are either expensive or environmentally unsafe.
But environmentalists and ecologists' fear that altered
bacteria, however natural, may upset the balance of nature.
The opposition is even more fierce to the use of genetically
engineered microbes, which can do specific tasks more
effectively than natural bacteria can.</p>
<p>Mr. Chakrabarty's genetically altered microbe, which won
the first patent in 1981 after a celebrated Supreme Court
decision, is languishing in a GE laboratory. Herman
Finkbeiner, manager of GE's biological sciences laboratory,
said GE decided to suspend further work on the microbe
largely because of public concern.</p>
