	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- Retail sales fell again in March, marking
the first time in more than three years they have fallen for
two consecutive months, the Commerce Department said.
   Sales dropped 0.6% during the month, after dipping 0.3% in
February. But economists, for the most part, insisted that
the retail sector is better off than the numbers imply.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"Consumer spending is doing quite respectably at this
point," said Robert Chandross, chief economist of Lloyds Bank
in New York. "There's not a lot of evidence of sustained
weakness here."</p>
<p>While auto sales continued to show troubling declines last
month, analysts said other retail purchases were slipping
only a bit after posting strong gains in January and
February.</p>
<p>"Excluding autos, sales were up 1.1% in January and 1.5%
in February, and down 0.4% in March," said Charles Lieberman
of Manufacturers Hanover Securities Corp. "With those kind of
increases in January and February, the March numbers
certainly aren't troublesome."</p>
<p>Nevertheless, every type of retailer except food stores
reported falling sales in March. Auto sales declined 1.4%
after plunging 6.5% in February. Hardware and
building-material purchases dropped 0.8% after jumping 2.5%
the month before. Furniture sales slipped 0.1% after growing
2.2%. Sales at general merchandise department stores shrunk
1% after growing 2.4%, and apparel sales declined 0.5% after
increasing 1.7%.</p>
<p>Rosalind Wells, chief economist of the National Retail
Federation, said the March figures don't "resemble reality."
She explained: "My reports from speaking to retailers were
that they were very happy."</p>
<p>Retail purchases totaled $148.55 billion in March, after
adjusting for seasonal fluctuations, 5.1% above the total for
March 1989.</p>
<p>Economists pointed out that the department revised its
initial calculation of February retail sales to show a far
smaller decline than the 0.8% drop it originally reported.
Analysts also speculated that March retail sales were hurt
because Easter doesn't come until mid-April this year.
Theorizing that many holiday-related purchases thus weren't
made in March, many expect a pick-up in sales this month.</p>
<p>"There isn't much of a hint here of anything traumatic
happening in the economy," Mr. Chandross said.</p>
<p>The government's retail sales estimates are based on a
relatively small sample of reports and frequently are revised
substantially as more data are collected. The numbers exclude
spending on services, which accounts for a large portion of
consumer outlays.</p>
<p>But retail sales account for about onethird of the
country's economic activity, so many economists pay close
attention to them. Last year, consumer spending slowed along
with the overall economy. Still, analysts say, the consumer
sector seems to be more vigorous than some other parts of the
economy, especially manufacturing.</p>
