	<p class="article-leader">The attorneys general of five Midwestern states urged the
U.S. Justice Department to step up antitrust enforcement in
the meatpacking industry.
   In a letter sent yesterday to U.S. Attorney General Dick
Thornburgh, the state prosecutors cited statistics that they
claim indicate dangerously high concentration of market share
in the meatpacking industry. For example, the state attorneys
general said that the four largest competitors in the
beefpacking industry control about 70% of the fed-cattle
market, up from 39% in 1980.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"For the past decade, antitrust has been the forgotten
area of federal law enforcement," Minnesota's attorney
general, Hubert Humphrey III, said in a statement
accompanying release of the letter. Mr. Humphrey signed the
letter along with his counterparts from Iowa, Montana, North
Dakota and South Dakota.</p>
<p>A Justice Department spokesman said Mr. Thornburgh hadn't
seen the letter, but that federal prosecutors have "looked at
the meatpacking industry because of the concerns of meat
producers about concentration in that market." The
department's "antitrust division is aware of the situation
and will continue to monitor it," the spokesman added.</p>
