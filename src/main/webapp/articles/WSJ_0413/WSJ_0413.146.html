	<p class="article-leader">General Development Corp., which recently filed for
bankruptcy-law protection, said it laid off another 138
employees.
   The troubled Florida developer said 81 employees came from
its Miami headquarters, while the remaining 57 were in field
offices. They were essentially the support staff for the
homesite-development division, which was closed earlier this
week, the spokeswoman said. That closing put 239 employees,
primarily in construction and engineering, out of work.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Last week, the company filed for protection under Chapter
11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code when it wasn't able to pay
more than $10 million in property taxes due April 1. In
recent months, General Development has laid off or fired
about 1,600 other workers, or more than one quarter of its
work force.</p>
<p>General Development's troubles stem from a grand jury
investigation of its selling practices. Last month, the
company pleaded guilty to a federal charge of conspiracy to
defraud about 10,000 homebuyers by charging inflated prices
based on improper appraisals. The company's former two top
executives pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy.</p>
