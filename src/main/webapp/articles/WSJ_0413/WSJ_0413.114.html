	<p class="article-leader">Moody's Investors Service Inc. said it lowered its ratings
on various Gulf Canada Resources Ltd. debt securities, citing
the oil and gas producer's "weak earnings and fixed-charge
coverage outlook" over the intermediate term.
   Moody's said its forecast for Calgary, Alberta-based Gulf
Canada, which is controlled by Toronto's Reichmann family,
reflects the company's high interest charges and preferred
dividend costs, a poor outlook for its drilling operations,
and falling domestic oil output.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The ratings downgrade, which Moody's said affects about
900 million Canadian dollars (US$774.4 million) of debt
securities, follows an announcement last month by the agency
that it had placed Gulf Canada under review for a possible
ratings cut.</p>
<p>Moody's said its downgrade affects Gulf Canada's senior
debentures, lowered to Baa-1 from single-A-2; Series 1
preferred shares, cut to Baa-2 from single-A-3; and a Gulf
Canada shelf registration, reduced to (provisional) Baa-1
from (provisional) single-A-2. Moody's also lowered Gulf
Canada's commercial paper rating to Prime-2 from Prime-1.</p>
<p>The agency said it expects Gulf Canada's ability to
comfortably service debt to "remain constrained over the next
several years" because of dividend requirements. As a result,
it said, "capital spending is likely to outpace net cash flow
generation, leading to increased financial leverage" without
an equity infusion or asset sales.</p>
<p>A Gulf Canada spokesman said, "We're disappointed
naturally, but that's their assessment. What else can I say?"</p>
<p>Moody's said it sees Gulf Canada's longer-term prospects
as sound in light of its big reserves in frontier areas, such
as the Beaufort Sea and off the east coast of Newfoundland.
It said Gulf Canada has also made "significant progress" in
extending its exploration prospects in Indonesia, where it
gained a major foothold with its 1988 acquisition of Asamera
Inc.</p>
<p>Moody's said this should help offset the company's
shrinking output from conventional fields in western Canada.</p>
<p>In American Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday,
Gulf Canada common stock closed at $13, unchanged.</p>
<p>Moody's said it also downgraded to Prime-2 from Prime-1
its rating on about C$160 million of short-term debt of
Olympia & York (Gulf Canada Square) Ltd., a unit of Olympia &
York Developments Ltd., the Reichmann family's wholly owned
flagship real estate concern.</p>
<p>The unit was formed to issue notes secured by the
corporate headquarters of Gulf Canada. A Moody's analyst said
the downgrade of the unit's debt doesn't affect ratings on
the debt of Olympia & York Developments or any of its other
units.</p>
<p>Moody's said the rating cut, which followed a similar
ratings downgrade last month by Canada's Dominion Bond Rating
Service Ltd., was "prompted by the fact that the company's
ability to meet its obligations depends largely on the
receipt of lease payments" from Gulf Canada, whose debt
ratings have been downgraded.</p>
