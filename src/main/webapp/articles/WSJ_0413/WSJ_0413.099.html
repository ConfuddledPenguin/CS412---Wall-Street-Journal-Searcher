	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- The Soviet military is showing growing signs
of stress and disintegration but is gaining clout in the
Russian government, according to U.S. military officials and
analysts.
   A report by Rand Corp. bolsters views by Bush
administration Moscow-watchers that the Soviet army, which
now stands almost alone in Eastern Europe as a result of the
collapse of the Warsaw Pact, is reeling from widespread
homelessness among retired officers, desertions among
draftees and turmoil within the ranks of its active officers.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"There is no doubt the Soviet military is under a great
deal of stress," says Henry S. Rowen, assistant secretary of
defense for international security affairs.</p>
<p>The upheaval comes as the Red Army is being asked to take
on a heavier burden in carrying out internal missions,
including controlling riots and other disturbances in ethnic
republics and protecting nuclear-weapons sites. Some U.S.
officials believe Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev's
growing reliance on the army to quell disturbances has given
the military a stronger hand in his government. For instance,
they believe dissatisfaction within the military is forcing
civilian leaders to resubmit military-backed proposals,
including proposed limits on sea-launched nuclear missiles,
and to slow talks in Vienna on conventional-arms control.</p>
<p>"Who would we turn to if we were told that Canada and
Mexico had just turned communist and the state of Florida was
about to secede?" asked one analyst, seeking an analogy to
Mr. Gorbachev's position.</p>
<p>Some U.S. officials question how much support the military
will give Mr. Gorbachev. The report says there are signs that
some officers have "increasingly tended to distance
themselves" from the Soviet leader, even though many of them
are younger officers who originally supported his reforms.</p>
<p>The report says a "staggering" number of officers are
homeless after leaving the military, many of them uprooted as
a result of Soviet cuts in forces in Eastern Europe and along
the Chinese border. The report also asserts, "a powerful
demographic shift" is filling the bottom ranks of the army
with Moslem draftees, many of whom speak little Russian.</p>
<p>Signs of the military's crisis, especially the officer
housing problems, have been appearing almost daily in the
Soviet military press. For example, retired Navy Captain V.
Shatskiy complained in the military newspaper "Red Star" last
month that he hasn't received his pension and can't find a
job. Because an apartment promised by the government never
materialized, Capt. Shatskiy said, "I am sitting on suitcases
with my two children and I do not know what to do." Since he
has no home, he added, local civilian authorities threatened
him and his wife with violating the Soviet Union's internal
passport law.</p>
<p>According to Red Star, there were 170,500 homeless
military families as of Jan. 1, including over 10,000 in
Moscow alone. The great majority of them were retired
officers' families.</p>
<p>"They literally don't know where to put them," says Murray
Feshbach, a demographer at Washington's Georgetown University
who specializes in the Soviet Union. The housing crisis and
growing ethnic problems, he says, are among the factors that
seem to be causing Soviet military planners to shift toward
favoring a much smaller, all-volunteer army. Ethnic turmoil
among the Armenians, Azerbaijanis and other nationalist
groups, Mr. Feshbach believes, will accelerate the shrinking
of the Soviet military because diverse groups will refuse to
serve in the same units.</p>
<p>Mr. Feshbach, who recently returned from talks with
officials in Moscow and in the Baltic states, predicts the
military that will emerge from the current upheaval will be
predominantly Russian. That would end a growing,
destabilizing split between the current officer corps, which
is mostly Russian or Slavic, and enlisted troops, close to
40% of whom now come from other ethnic groups.</p>
<p>The Rand report adds that Mr. Gorbachev has created a
"generational change" in the upper ranks of the military,
replacing most senior men with younger officers. The officer
corps now breaks down into two factions, according to Rand:
the "far easterners," led by Soviet Defense Minister D.T.
Yazov, men who spent many years serving together in Siberia,
Central Asia and in the Pacific Fleet; and a tier of younger
officers, slightly below them in rank, who served in
Afghanistan. This second group, according to Rand, is "likely
to play an important role for some time to come."</p>
<p>Some Rand analysts see the growing splits in the army as
reflecting general ethnic strife that could grow worse in the
years ahead. "You have most, if not all, the necessary
ingredients present for a civil war," says Jeremy R. Azrael,
a senior Rand Soviet specialist.</p>
<p>Such upheaval could affect U.S. security interests in a
number of ways, he says. For one thing, ethnic strife could
endanger the Soviet Union's nuclear arsenal, the majority of
which is in such outlying republics as Kazakhstan. Mr. Azrael
said he believes the chances are one out of three that a
civil war could break out in Russia within the next five
years.</p>
