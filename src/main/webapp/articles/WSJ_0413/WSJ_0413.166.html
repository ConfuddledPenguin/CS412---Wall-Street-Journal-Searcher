	<p class="article-leader">Credit Lyonnais, a French state-owned banking concern,
said its profit for 1989 jumped 52%, led by commercial
banking, leasing, and asset management operations in France,
as well as new acquisitions in Italy and Belgium.
   Consolidated profit after payments to minority interests
rose to 3.13 billion francs ($556.5 million) from 2.06
billion francs in 1988. The results just topped the half-way
mark toward the bank's goal set by last year of doubling
annual profit by 1992.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Part of the growth reflected acquisitions aimed at
expanding Credit Lyonnais's profitable retail network across
Europe in preparation for the unified market of 1992. These
included the purchase of just less than 50% of Bank Credito
Bergamasco of Italy and the first-time consolidation of a
Belgian retail bank network that Credit Lyonnais bought in
1988.</p>
<p>Customer loans rose 14% to 575 billion francs, and
equipment leasing activities increased 44% and real estate
leasing climbed 28%. Customer deposits climbed 13% to 464
billion francs.</p>
