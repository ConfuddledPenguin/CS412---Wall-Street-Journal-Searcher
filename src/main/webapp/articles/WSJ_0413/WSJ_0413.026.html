	<p class="article-leader">MINNEAPOLIS -- Norwest Corp. expects to report that
first-quarter profit exceeded the previous record of $61.1
million, or 65 cents a share, reached in the 1989 fourth
quarter, Lloyd P. Johnson, chairman and chief executive
officer, said.
   In an interview here, Mr. Johnson also said that the bank
holding company's nonperforming assets rose between $12
million and $15 million for the quarter from $145 million at
year end. That figure was equal to about 1.1% of total loans,
which compares favorably to most other big banks.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Mr. Johnson wouldn't elaborate on the first-quarter profit
expectations. In the year-ago period, Norwest reported profit
of $57 million, or 60 cents a share, adjusted for a 2-for-1
stock split paid last July.</p>
<p>Despite the continued profit growth and relatively low
level of problem loans, Mr. Johnson said he is concerned
about the weakness of real estate and other parts of the
economy, and that Norwest's troubled assets could increase
further during the year. He wouldn't make a projection,
however.</p>
<p>The company expects to add further to its reserves for
loan losses, which at year end were 164.3% of problem loans.</p>
<p>Mr. Johnson said Norwest has forgone profits -- in the
hope of avoiding big losses -- in recent years by not making
very large loans. While the company could conceivably lend a
single customer, under federal regulations, $200 million or
more, it has limited its exposure to any single customer to
amounts far less than that.</p>
<p>Richard M. Kovacevich, president and chief operating
officer, said that currently Norwest's biggest single loan is
$65 million.</p>
<p>Norwest Mortgage, which has had losses in recent years, is
expected to reach the corporatewide return-on-equity level of
close to 19% soon, Mr. Johnson said. To do that, the mortgage
unit must originate about $5 billion of mortgage loans this
year. It originated $4.4 billion last year, when it had
profit of $5.8 million, against a 1988 loss of $9.7 million.</p>
