	<p class="article-leader">CHICAGO -- Morton International Inc. expects to report
earnings of about $39 million, or 82 cents a share, for its
third quarter ended March 31, on sales of $450 million,
Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Charles S. Locke said in
an interview.
   Harsh winter weather that increased demand for
ice-controlling road salt, along with rising demand for the
company's automobile airbags, more than offset an earnings
drop at Morton's biggest segment, its specialty chemical
operation, Mr. Locke said.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>In the year-ago period, in which Morton took a variety of
charges associated with the July 1, 1989 divestiture of its
Thiokol Corp. aerospace operations, the company had restated
net income of $9.6 million, or 20 cents a share, on sales of
$400 million.</p>
<p>Thiokol has been hurt by its association with the fatal
explosion of the space shuttle Challenger, which used a
Thiokol-manufactured rocket motor. The spinoff has permitted
Morton to focus on its specialty chemical division, Mr. Locke
said, adding that he expects that operation will soon enjoy a
turnaround.</p>
<p>"Specialty chemicals is down. It seems to be getting a
little better . . . but we're still down," Mr. Locke said.
But the demand for road salt, "particularly in Canada," is
contributing to "clearly the best year ever" for Morton's
salt operations, Mr. Locke said.</p>
<p>For the third quarter, pretax operating profit in Morton's
salt business segment climbed to $30 million from the
year-earlier $23 million, he said.</p>
<p>After 15 years of researching and developing its airbag
business, the company is just beginning to realize a profit
from the operation, Mr. Locke said. He estimated that
third-quarter operating profit for the airbag segment totaled
$3.7 million, compared to a loss of $1 million last year.
Sales more than tripled in the latest period, to about $40
million from the year-earlier $12 million.</p>
<p>The recent growth in the airbag business, of which Morton
holds nearly a 50% market share, is due largely to new
federal safety regulations requiring automobile manufacturers
to include driver-side passive restraint systems in 1990
model cars. Regulations also call for restraint systems on
the passenger side in coming years.</p>
<p>Analysts estimate that Morton's airbag sales will rise
from about $150 million for the current fiscal year, ending
June 30, to about $350 million by fiscal year 1992.</p>
<p>Rising costs for raw materials, an electronics industry
that has been "flat on its bottom" and cuts in auto output
have caused the company's specialty chemical business to fall
off, Mr. Locke said.</p>
<p>For the third quarter, the company estimates specialty
chemical operating profit slipped to $36 million from $37
million the year earlier.</p>
<p>Morton's recent $220 million purchase of Whittaker Corp.'s
specialty chemical segment will raise the company's specialty
chemical sales to about $1.2 billion annually, Mr. Locke
said.</p>
