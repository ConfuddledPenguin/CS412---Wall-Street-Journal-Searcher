	<p class="article-leader">CHENGDU, China -- It is 8 a.m. and Tang Daqin, director of
the Sichuan No. 1 Knitting Mill, is staring down his first
crisis of the day. It's a big one: His factory has run out of
cash.
   In the daily meeting with his top aides, Mr. Tang devises
an emergency plan. One vice director will go to a nearby bank
to beg for a loan. Another will hit up a trading company for
repayment of a longstanding debt. Mr. Tang himself will lean
on the People's Construction Bank's local branch chairman, a
longtime personal friend.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>With a little luck, the soft-spoken factory boss tells his
assistants, the enterprise can raise enough money to keep
operating for at least another two weeks. Then the directors
can turn to other matters, like figuring out how to find
cotton supplies amid a shortage that has already forced
hundreds of textile companies to close.</p>
<p>The day's problems are serious, though hardly unusual. For
the men and women who run China's state-owned factories,
nearly every day brings new calamities. A national austerity
program has made working capital virtually unattainable.
Skewed pricing policies create crippling shortages of raw
materials and energy. Shifting political winds mean sharp
swings in economic policy. And, despite China's attempt to
modernize, it is still personal connections, not business
skills, that matter most in running an enterprise. For a
reform-minded factory director, operating efficiently in this
half-reformed economy is a daily struggle.</p>
<p>"I feel like I spend all of my time running around just
trying to find the money and materials I need to keep going,"
says the 46-year-old Mr. Tang. "It's hard to get anything
else done."</p>
<p>By the time Mr. Tang sits down at his desk at 8:30 a.m.,
he is already well into his first pack of Kents. The strain
of his job is evident in the way he handles his cigarettes:
He pinches them so tightly they sometimes go out. His office
is neat and spare. On the walls are clipboards of statistics
and a poster of a beach scene far removed from this drab
industrial city in central Sichuan Province. On Mr. Tang's
desk sits a phone, a photo of his family and a vase of garish
plastic flowers.</p>
<p>For the next few hours, his office maintains all the
decorum of a fast-food counter. All morning long, assistants
dash in and out, bringing problems that demand his "immediate
attention." A trade-union official wants to get Mr. Tang's
approval to buy red cloth for hanging political slogans in
the factory's meeting hall. A senior engineer comes to
discuss a scheme to invest in Fiji. A scruffy young vice
director runs in every 10 minutes with progress reports on a
Chinese businessman who has come to tour the factory.</p>
<p>A moment of quiet comes, finally, at 11, when Mr. Tang is
left alone to read the newspapers. He scans the business
sections of the major economic and trade papers for tidbits
on prices and supplies, jotting down the information in a
notebook.</p>
<p>"I've got to keep up with the needs of the market," says
Mr. Tang, who takes a week off each month to tour the
province and talk to customers and shopkeepers. "Nowadays, a
factory needs an edge."</p>
<p>Recognition of the market is one of the major results of
China's past decade of reform. In Mao's day, all was mandated
by the state. The life of the factory director was easy, if a
little dull. The state set output quotas, provided all raw
materials and bought up the factory's production. Workers
earned a set wage, and directors often held their jobs for
life.</p>
<p>A dash of liberal economics changed that. Today, directors
are held accountable for their factory's performance and can
lose their bonuses, or even their jobs, for poor results.
There is also competition now, largely from upstart rural
enterprises that operate outside the planned economy and
scavenge for the same customers and raw materials.</p>
<p>Sichuan No. 1 Knitting, whose 1,500 workers produce
T-shirts, underwear and sports suits, still gets most of its
raw materials from the state, but it pays a huge premium for
what it must buy on the free market. The factory, for
example, gets 90% of its supplies of "32-S" yarn at the
state-subsidized price of $2,265 a ton. But the remainder
must be bought on the open market, at a 55% markup.</p>
<p>Some materials are barely available at any price. Low
government prices have discouraged farmers from growing
cotton, and supplies have shrunk, throwing factories into
turmoil.</p>
<p>"At this point, all I can do is pray for good luck," says
Mr. Tang.</p>
<p>Even when raw materials are available, energy may not be.
China's energy shortage means factories often don't operate.
Mr. Tang recently installed two generators, at $35,000 each,
but the cost per kilowatt hour -- three times normal rates --
is prohibitive. For five months each year, the factory simply
closes half a day.</p>
<p>Mr. Tang, a high-school dropout, came to the factory as a
machine repairman at age 15. He quickly worked his way up the
ladder and, in 1981, the factory sent him to the Chengdu
University School of Business Management. There, he learned
theories that attempted to graft Western management technique
onto socialist ideology.</p>
<p>As factory director, a job he assumed in 1988, Mr. Tang
enjoys prestige but limited material gain. In the fledgling
private sector, enterprise bosses are getting rich, so rich
the state has begun re-emphasizing Maoist egalitarianism. But
for managers in the state sector, living conditions have
remained roughly constant.</p>
<p>Mr. Tang lives with his wife and son in a small three-room
apartment near the factory. The living-room centerpiece is a
bright green refrigerator, far too large for the closet-like
kitchen. "I don't dare give myself a bigger apartment," he
says. "My workers would complain."</p>
<p>Back at the factory, it is now 11:30, and Mr. Tang is
ringing up the chairman of the local branch of the
Construction Bank. He tells his banker friend that China's
tight credit policy is hurting business, and that many of his
customers aren't paying their bills. The factory, he says,
stands to lose the equivalent of $11,000 a day if it doesn't
get an injection of cash soon.</p>
<p>The debt problem results from the austerity measures China
imposed in late 1988 to cool the overheated economy and curb
inflation. The credit squeeze has created a mounting cycle of
debt. Customers owe Sichuan No. 1 Knitting $1.4 million in
all, about three times the normal level. The factory, which
in turn owes its suppliers about $1 million, has formed a
team of 10 managers who travel around the country hitting up
clients for repayment.</p>
<p>When he finally hangs up the phone, Mr. Tang breaks into a
big smile: He got his money. An aide will go to the bank in
the afternoon to pick up $81,000. "It helps to have
connections," he says.</p>
<p>The jubilation is soon broken, however, when a vice
director, Tang Jianchuan, comes in to report that the state
trading company he visited in the morning refused to pay the
$135,000 it owes. The company said that it had the money, but
that Bank of China wouldn't allow them to repay the factory.
The bank later said this wasn't true. "It's just a delay
tactic," the factory boss says, shaking his head.</p>
<p>At 12:30, Mr. Tang breaks for lunch, and factory workers
begin their two-hour break. Workers' time off is sacred.
Indeed, the right to xiuxi, or rest, is enshrined in the
Chinese constitution. Mr. Tang tries to motivate his workers
by combining individual incentives with appeals to a sense of
the collective. In Mao's day, workers got a guaranteed wage.
No one got rich, but no one got fired, and no one did much
work. Today, while wage scales fall within a narrow range,
hard-working laborers can increase their pay according to a
piece-rate system Mr. Tang introduced last year.</p>
<p>In extreme cases, Mr. Tang theoretically has the power to
fire poor performers. But he needs approval from the trade
union head and the Communist Party secretary, who generally
resist.</p>
<p>To reinforce the collective message, Mr. Tang has prepared
a series of elaborate posters, hung outside the main office
building, that graphically depict losses due to workers'
lapses. "If you just say something is bad, nobody listens,"
he says. "It's much more effective to show workers just how
much money the factory is losing because of their mistakes."</p>
<p>Money is used to motivate Mr. Tang, too. Like most of
China's state-run factories, his plant adopts the "director
responsibility system," which gives him a stake in the
factory's performance. Each year, Mr. Tang signs a contract
with a state agency that obliges his factory to meet a
certain production quota. The factory can sell any additional
output freely, and retain most of the profits.</p>
<p>It's an improvement on the old system, where everything
was set by the state. But as reforms go, it's half-baked.
Contracts are set through negotiation, and depend as much on
a director's relations with state officials as on business
acumen. Once a contract is signed, the plant has to meet its
quotas even if economic conditions or state policies change
drastically. The challenge of meeting this year's contract is
one reason Mr. Tang pinches his cigarettes.</p>
<p>As Mr. Tang begins his regular afternoon inspection of the
factory's workshops, where long wet strands of white cloth
are stretched from clattering machines, he explains to a
visitor the tangled web of incentives and state dictates he
must cope with. If Sichuan No. 1 Knitting matches the
previous year's profit of $540,000, Mr. Tang stands to earn a
bonus of $300, equal to about four months' salary. If the
factory doesn't make it, he not only won't get a bonus, he
will forfeit $270 of his own money put up as "risk"
insurance.</p>
<p>In recent years, the factory has met its goal, and Mr.
Tang has profited. But the economy has gone to pot in the
last year, and the system holds him responsible for a lot of
things he can't control. Besides the scarcities,
anti-inflation regulations limit the selling price of the
factory's garments, even while prices of raw materials soar.
The director isn't permitted to lay off redundant workers.</p>
<p>"This is the worst period we've ever experienced," Mr.
Tang says. He expects sales to tumble 10% this year. "It will
be very tough to make the contract."</p>
<p>At 5:30, Mr. Tang leaves the factory for home. The
seven-minute walk takes him past a large complex of workers'
apartments, built by Sichuan No. 1 Knitting. Sewage flows by
in narrow, open channels abutting the sidewalk.</p>
<p>Reflecting on the crises of the day, Mr. Tang becomes
philosophical. "Dealing with problems is part of being a
factory director in China," he says. "It's a challenge I
accept."</p>
<p>Nonetheless, radical shifts in national policy trouble
China's factory bosses. Since the massacre of pro-democracy
demonstrators in Beijing last June, the government has been
re-emphasizing the Maoist model, threatening to reduce the
independence of factory directors. Already there is more
emphasis on political work at Sichuan No. 1 Knitting, where
Mr. Tang spends six hours a week in study. He is supposed to
root out "bourgeois liberalization" at his factory, though he
concedes, "Frankly I'm not sure what bourgeois liberalization
is."</p>
<p>"I'm afraid the planning system will play an increasing
role in the economy for a long time," he says. "China is
moving very cautiously with reform."</p>
