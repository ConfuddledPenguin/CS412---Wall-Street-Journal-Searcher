	<p class="article-leader">Last May, two months before his death of cancer at 58,
Donald Barthelme completed the manuscript of a novel, "The
King" (Harper & Row, 158 pages, $16.95). It now joins his
stories, his three other novels, his children's book, his
parodies, the 14 volumes that made him a true descendant of
Joyce and Borges, Groucho Marx and Mallarme -- a master of
short fiction whose style was as distinctive (and
misapprehended) as Hemingway's, a literary collagiste as
accomplished in his juxtapositions as Duchamp, Max Ernst or
Joseph Cornell. "Fragments are the only forms I trust" was
Barthelme's credo, and out of that nostalgic and rebellious
paradox he created works of high literary art, comic and sad.
   This last novel should confound his enemies and comfort
his admirers. It is significantly less difficult than much of
his work: not a conventional novel by any means, but
something that has recognizable characters, a scene, and a
plot that can be glimpsed in the 39 short sections (mostly
dialogue) that comprise the work. It's much more friendly
than some of his stories or such novels as "Snow White" or
"The Dead Father."</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The king of the title is King Arthur -- not Elvis. This
isn't camp. And far from ragging the Arthurian tradition
(Camelot, Round Table, Grail, chivalry, romantic love),
Barthelme imaginatively salutes it. He sets the familiar
characters -- Arthur, Launcelot and Queen Guinevere, loyal
Sir Kay, treacherous Mordred -- down in England in the early
days of World War II (Dunkirk, the Battle of Britain, the
fall of Paris) and thus achieves a kind of historical double
exposure. The legendary knights in armor struggle with
dragons, villains, howitzers and nuclear fission. Over the
radio, Lord Haw-Haw broadcasts anti-British propaganda from
Berlin, and Ezra Pound spits anti-Semitic bilge from Rome.

Cathedral is bombed.</p>
<p>In this, medieval chivalry and the last hurrah of English
military heroism are conjoined. Arthur is unswervingly noble,
admired by all, courteous, long-suffering, generous, wise. He
refuses to bomb the civilian population of Milan, and when
confronted with the news that the Grail is really a
superweapon, the atomic bomb, he tears up the formulas that
Merlin has been sending him and announces, "We won't do it. .
. . I cannot allow it. It's not the way we wage war. . . .
The essence of our calling is right behavior, and this false
Grail is not a knightly weapon. I have spoken." He knows full
well, "I've done something rather awful . . . I've
surrendered an advantage . . . I said no. Because I thought
it immoral," but we're asked successfully to see this as an
act of tragic decency. Arthur may well be an anachronism, as
he's called, but he's a noble one. And we agree, without a
snicker.</p>
<p>Launcelot might sound like a toff out of Evelyn Waugh
("things were quite dicey there for a bit"), but he's full of
dumb pluck: "I spend my whole life hacking at things . . . Is
this the best way to exist in the world? . . . Hacking away,
day in and day out; get a thing properly hacked and there's
the next thing, begging for hacking. . . ." Guinevere is
promiscuous, but queenly withal: "The one is off God knows
where running the war, and the other pops in between dragons,
as it were. It's little consolation that they are both so
enormously noble and worshipful, when one's bed is empty
night after night. But perhaps I'm being crude." The lady
Lyonesse is pregnant by a commoner, but, then, she hates
queening: "It's rather terrible, being a queen. One has to
attend functions. One has to stand there smiling while the
local fellow explains how the peat is packaged. . . . To be a
queen, even a country sort of queen, is to know boredom as
few human beings have known boredom."</p>
<p>Though most of the medieval monikers come from Malory's
1485 "Le Morte d'Arthur" (Sir Lucan the Butler, Sir Ozana le
Cure Hardy), Barthelme's most conspicuous new character is
the gracious Sir Roger de Ibadan, the Black Knight, an
African from Dahomey, who is a fount of practical and
esoteric knowledge, thoroughly adept in both the medieval and
the modern world, and most nobly in love with the female
highwayman Clarice. Thus are both sexism and ethnocentric
prejudice exploded.</p>
<p>Barthelme makes comic use of his anachronisms, but the
cumulative effect is one of splendor. There are countless
echoes of Malory and Shakespeare. Rather than mocking stiff
antiquity or using literary allusions to take cheap shots at
shoddy modern life (or sermonizing on the horrors of war, or
leering about medieval filth and lechery a la Monty Python),
Barthelme has reclaimed and reinvented the Arthurian
tradition with great affection and achieved a verbal richness
that suggests Joycean affinities between late medieval or
Renaissance prolixity and modern polyphonic jargon, slang and
kitsch.</p>
<p>For much of his career Barthelme portrayed father figures
as monsters out of Kafka and Grimm: castrating,
guilt-inducing oppressors to be feared and satirized. In his
1975 novel "The Dead Father," 19 men dragged an immense
talking carcass ("dead, but still with us, still with us, but
dead") through the countryside and finally buried it in a
huge hole with bulldozers. In his early story "Views of My
Father Weeping," he depicted a son's botched revenge for the
murder of his father as a struggle with the dead hand of the
past. But in this last, crepuscular novel, Barthelme appears
to have made a separate peace with the past. For the king is
noble, the comedy autumnal, and the style is glorious indeed.</p>
