	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- The U.S. International Trade Commission
ruled that imports of photo-typesetting and image-setting
machines from West Germany may be injuring domestic
manufacturers of similar equipment.
   The preliminary ruling stems from a complaint filed under
the Anti-Dumping Act by Varityper Inc., a subsidiary of AM
International Inc., Chicago. The complaint contends that
Linotype AG and other West German manufacturers are exporting
this equipment to the U.S. at "unfairly" low prices. The
ruling means the Commerce Department and the ITC will
continue to investigate the complaint, which involves imports
from West Germany of about $50 million a year. The proceeding
could lead to duties on the imports.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>In its trade complaint, Varityper alleged that the West
German machines are reaching the U.S. market at prices
ranging from 6.3% to 17% below the home-market price for the
same products or below the foreign cost of production.</p>
