	<p class="article-leader">Service with a smile just isn't good enough anymore.
Instead, service with a computer is becoming the norm.
   Recent improvements in computer technology can provide
speedy response to telephone inquiries and provide customers
with answers at any hour of the day or night. Developments in
"expert" software systems and "image processing" shorten the
game of telephone tag and cut the number of times customer
calls get shunted around from person to person. Improvements
in laptop computers are sending more companies'
representatives into the field to speed the handling of
insurance claims, mortgage applications, elevator repairs and
even cocktail orders.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"Service is becoming the determining factor for
maintaining competitiveness in more and more businesses,"
says William Davidow, a venture capitalist and co-author of
"Total Customer Service, the Ultimate Weapon." And, although
service is widely considered to be so bad that the recent
developments can hardly be a panacea, companies are finding
that some of the improvements can give them an advantage over
their competitors.</p>
<p>Among the biggest breakthroughs have been systems that let
telephone switches and standard computers speak the same
language. That means someone calling with a question on, say,
a credit-card bill can punch in an account number while on
hold. The telephone switch would relay the number to the
computer, which would fetch the caller's records. The records
would be relayed back through the phone switch and would
appear on the customer-service person's computer screen as
soon as he answered the call.</p>
<p>Lee Figliuolo, a vice president at Progressive Casualty
Insurance Co., Cleveland, says such hybrid systems can be
especially important for callers when they get passed from
one person to another. The records simply become part of the
call. When the call is transferred, the files appear on the
computer terminal of the service representative who grabs it,
so the information doesn't have to be taken down all over
again.</p>
<p>"As the customer, I'm not repeating my account number or
name," Mr. Figliuolo says. "And with a name like mine, I
always have to spell it three or four times."</p>
<p>Mr. Figliuolo, who recently installed an International
Business Machines Corp. CallPath system at his company, says
the system also makes it easier to reroute phone calls.
Callers after business hours on the East Coast used to get a
recorded message, but now they're shifted to the West Coast
and answered by someone there. Moreover, the computers
automatically track all sorts of indicators -- how long the
caller was on hold, how many times he was transferred, etc.
-- so problem areas can be spotted quickly.</p>
<p>Using such systems, callers can get information on
accounts and so forth at any time, without waiting for an
operator. St. Joseph's Hospital and Medical Center in
Phoenix, Ariz., installed a system so that patients can get
information on bills by calling a computer and punching in
their account numbers. The system will also soon give
physicians their lab results.</p>
<p>Similarly, Thomas Powell & Associates, a software firm in
Boca Raton, Fla., that specializes in voice systems, recently
unveiled a system that lets golfers reserve tee-off times by
dialing a computer and following the voice prompts.</p>
<p>Image processing -- where documents are scanned by a
computer and stored electronically -- is also becoming widely
used to cut the time a customer spends on the phone with a
company.</p>
<p>A study by the Nolan Norton Institute, a research firm in
Lexington, Mass., found that, with image processing,
companies can more than halve the time it takes to respond to
an inquiry, because pulling files together electronically is
so much faster than fetching them from drawers. The study
says a big insurance company cut to 10 days from more than
six months the time it took to resolve complex claims. A
manufacturing company cut the parts-reordering process to an
average of three minutes from 20.</p>
<p>Philip LaKernick, chief executive of Maria Parham Hospital
in Henderson, N.C., says a new system from GeneSys Data
Technologies Inc. of Hunt Valley, Md., has cut the time it
takes to find a patient's chart to less than a minute from
half an hour. He says that's important in the middle of the
night, when nurses assume the task because medical-records
people aren't there 24 hours a day. He adds that the system
can be crucial in the emergency room, making medical
histories readily available.</p>
<p>Some companies are also beginning to use "expert" systems
-- which collect knowledge -- to help answer customers'
questions, especially on technical matters. Turnover in
customer-service operations can be high, and it can take a
long time to bring a new person up to speed, so companies use
the software systems to store answers as people uncover them
and build a base of expertise that won't walk out the door
when an employee does.</p>
<p>"We can often answer a question on the first call," says
Randy Fisher, vice president of customer support at Interleaf
Inc., a software company that recently began using a system
from Answer Computer Inc., in Sunnyvale, Calif. In the past,
he says, whoever answered the call might well have gone off
researching what someone else had already done.</p>
<p>Otis Elevator Co., a subsidiary of United Technologies
Corp., is using an expert system, together with laptop
computers, to speed repair. Otis has devices that, working
like airplane flight recorders, collect information on the
behavior of many of its elevators. When an elevator isn't
working, an expert system provides a list of possible
problems, which the repairman can call up on his portable
computer. Otis is also testing a system that would let him
call up the elevator's maintenance history.</p>
<p>As laptops have shrunk, systems such as NCR Corp.'s
"palmtop" order-entry system also have become available. The
computer lets a waiter take an order at a table and
immediately send it over a radio frequency to the bar or
kitchen, trimming the time people have to spend waiting for
that hard-earned first drink and those appetizers.</p>
<p>The march of technology isn't always seen as progress, of
course. Customers frequently complain about reaching a
computer when they're trying to call a company. Customers may
also get a sales pitch when they call for service, given that
consolidated data on the customer can alert the company to
what products a caller might need. Also, people who
appreciate being able to get a tee time late some night
wouldn't necessarily like having to walk through the same
series of voice prompts in the middle of the afternoon.</p>
<p>In many instances, however, these technologies really will
save customers a minute here, an hour there, maybe even a day
or two someplace else.</p>
