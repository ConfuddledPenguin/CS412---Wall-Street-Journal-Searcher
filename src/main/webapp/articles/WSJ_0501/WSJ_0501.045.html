	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Reuters Holdings PLC, London, appointed
Michael Sanderson president and chief executive officer of
Instinet Corp., its equities trading unit.
   Mr. Sanderson, 47 years old, who recently resigned as head
of Merrill Lynch & Co.'s Canadian operations, will succeed
Robert H. Reid, 61, who has managed Instinet since 1988.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Mr. Sanderson's appointment suggests Instinet "has been
doing well," said James Mendelson, an industry analyst at
Morgan Stanley & Co. "Instinet is showing healthy growth and
is finally profitable," he added.</p>
<p>Instinet, acquired by Reuters in 1987, traded 2.6 billion
shares of mostly over-the-counter securities in 1989, up from
the 922 million shares traded in 1986.</p>
<p>Analysts said that Mr. Sanderson will bring more of a
marketing orientation to Instinet. Mr. Reid, a former New
York Stock Exchange executive, had been responsible mostly
for expanding Instinet's roster of stocks traded. A Reuters
spokesman said Mr. Reid will work at Instinet "at least
through the end of the year" and will continue the expansion
of U.K. and other European securities on the Instinet system.</p>
