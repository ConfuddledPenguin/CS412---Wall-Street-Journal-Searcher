Sciences Inc., which markets First Response at-home pregnancy
and ovulation test kits, from Tambrands Inc. Terms weren't

   Carter-Wallace, a marketer of toiletries and

complement its existing line of Answer at-home pregnancy and
ovulation test kits and will make it the leading marketer of
such kits. Tambrands said that First Response, with annual
sales of about $28 million, has about a 25% market share of
the in-home test kit market, while Answer has about a 10%
market share.</p>
