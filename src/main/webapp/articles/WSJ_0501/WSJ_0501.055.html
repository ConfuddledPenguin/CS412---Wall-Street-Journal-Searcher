	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- A former top official in the Department of
Housing and Urban Development painted a grim picture of an
agency that was run largely by political motivations and
personal opportunism, rather than program merit.
   DuBois Gilliam, a HUD deputy assistant secretary from
April 1984 until September 1987, told a congressional panel
that "during the time during which I worked with Pierce," the
department operated "basically on political favoritism."</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Samuel Pierce headed the department during the entire two
terms of the Reagan administration. One year ago, disclosures
about widespread corruption, favoritism and mismanagement
began emerging through official and press reports and
congressional investigations. Mr. Gilliam's statements
yesterday, before the House Government Operations
subcommittee on employment and housing, was the most
revealing testimony to date and certainly the most damaging
to the department and Mr. Pierce.</p>
<p>Mr. Gilliam admitted taking about $100,000 in cash,
clothes, food and travel payoffs during his less than three
years at HUD, because he was corrupted by "just downright
power and greed." He is serving an 18-month prison sentence
for accepting payoffs to approve projects in two cases and
appeared before the panel with a grant of immunity from
further prosecution.</p>
<p>In contrast with Mr. Pierce's reputation as an aloof
secretary who was little involved in the department's
operations, Mr. Gilliam described a secretary who was closely
informed about, and personally made decisions on,
departmental projects -- sometimes conferring directly with
the White House. Mr. Gilliam also said Mr. Pierce insisted
that some be cleared while at least one other was stopped
because the secretary didn't like the congressman who wanted
it.</p>
<p>Mr. Pierce quashed a San Antonio, Texas, project favored
by Democratic Rep. Henry Gonzalez because, according to Mr.
Gilliam, Mr. Pierce never forgave Mr. Gonzalez for calling
the secretary "Stepin Fetchit."</p>
<p>He said Mr. Pierce specifically ordered funding for a
parking garage in Pittsfield, Mass., and a Hampton University
project in Virginia before the school's application had even
been submitted. Mr. Pierce was on the school's board of
trustees. But Mr. Gilliam added that "from the bottom of my
heart," he doesn't believe that Mr. Pierce "ever received any
sort of gratuity or kickback" while at HUD.</p>
<p>But Mr. Gilliam did say Mr. Pierce approved the transfer
of a HUD career employee who became suspicious about a
financial-commitment letter that Mr. Gilliam knew was
fraudulent as part of a funding package for a HUD-related
project. Mr. Gilliam said Mr. Pierce didn't know the letter
was phony. Nevertheless, the secretary allowed Mr. Gilliam to
transfer David Sowell from his duties as a senior development
director in the Urban Development Action Grant program,
because they feared Mr. Sowell would ask the department's
inspector general to investigate UDAG.</p>
<p>Mr. Sowell was restored to his position in April of last
year.</p>
<p>Mr. Pierce had four lawyers at the hearing who issued a
prepared statement at the conclusion saying Mr. Gilliam's
"unfortunate testimony simply represents the subcommittee's
latest attempt to vilify Mr. Pierce in a one-sided
proceeding." A special prosecutor currently is investigating
some of Mr. Pierce's activities while HUD secretary.</p>
<p>While Mr. Gilliam's testimony highlighted his personal
corruption, it also pointed to a more widespread system of
political favoritism in the way Washington works. He said it
was widely known that you couldn't get a job in the Reagan
administration unless you worked on its political campaigns.
He said his Republican Party work in Nebraska earned him a
place on the administration's "must-hire list."</p>
<p>"I should have never been hired by HUD," Mr. Gilliam said.
"I got in there because I was political."</p>
