	<h3>Clamor Builds For Automating Treasury's Sales</h3>

	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Momentum is building for Uncle Sam to automate
the huge auctions of U.S. Treasury securities.
   For the past 60 years, the sales of Treasury bills, notes
and bonds have been conducted mostly by hand by the Federal
Reserve Bank of New York, on behalf of the U.S. Treasury.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>This quaint procedure is increasingly irritating many of
the Fed's 44 primary dealers, the elite group of securities
firms that must bid at every Treasury debt sale in exchange
for the privilege of trading directly with Fed.</p>
<p>These dealers say the sales could easily be computerized,
providing results in minutes, instead of hours. The speedier
sales not only would help dealers avoid costly mistakes, they
say, but also would save the Treasury millions of dollars
annually in borrowing costs and lessen auction-day turmoil in
the world's largest bond market.</p>
<p>"It's an antiquated system and it ought to change in this
day and age," says E. Craig Coats Jr., a managing director at
First Boston Corp.</p>
<p>The Fed, as the Treasury's fiscal agent, conducts the
sales of Treasury securities, which totaled $1.25 trillion
last year, to fund the federal deficit. Tomorrow, the size of
the quarterly note and bond auction next week will be
announced, and it is expected to total about $30 billion.</p>
<p>Dealers say they have periodically pleaded with Treasury
and Fed officials to automate auction procedures, which have
changed little since three-month Treasury bill sales started
in 1929. Their requests prompted officials two years ago to
quicken existing procedures by encouraging the clerks
involved in sorting and counting the bids to work faster.
That effort shaved about 40 minutes off the wait for auction
results.</p>
<p>But even so, winners aren't notified of purchases until as
long as three hours after the 1 p.m. EDT bidding deadline.
The reason is that after the deadline has passed, the steel
boxes containing the bids are brought to the eighth floor of
the New York Fed for processing by hand. The preliminary
tally is then faxed to the Treasury for final compilation.</p>
<p>Traders envision computerized auctions that would enable
them to type in their bids on a keyboard and send them
directly to the New York Fed, just as the World Bank's
trading desk in Washington already does.</p>
<p>Bidders are concerned about market risk because auction
days -- especially those that involve infrequently offered
securities -- are among the most volatile days for the U.S.
bond market. The anxious wait for results breeds rumors that
can whipsaw prices of more than $100 billion of securities
that trade daily.</p>
<p>For example, consider the Treasury's attempts earlier this
year to sell 40-year bonds for the first time since the
1950s. The auctions of $5 billion of these securities in
January and $3.5 billion in April by the Resolution Funding
Corp., the agency created to fund the federal government's
rescue of the thrift industry, drew considerable interest
because of their novelty.</p>
<p>Around the bidding deadline at both auctions, rumors
surfaced about robust demand for the new "bailout" bonds,
which lifted the entire bond market. But results issued three
hours later showed that those rumors were false, and bond
prices fell a full point late in the afternoon on the day of
the first sale and half a point following the second auction.
"By having timely results, you would have avoided those
market slides," contends Joseph Liro, a money market
economist at S.G. Warburg Securities Co.</p>
<p>The latest attempt to lobby for electronic auctions began
in February when a trade group representing primary dealers
met with New York Fed officials and offered to shoulder some
of the costs of automation. The discussions initiated by the
Public Securities Association were widened early last month
to include senior staff at the Treasury. The result is that
the Treasury and the New York Fed have agreed to study the
possibility of computerizing the auctions.</p>
<p>The dealers are eager to move fast. "I would hope by the
fall we would have a working, automated auction system in
place," says Thomas Pura, chairman of the PSA's primary
dealer committee and a partner at Goldman, Sachs & Co.</p>
<p>But Michael Basham, deputy assistant secretary of federal
finance at the Treasury, cautions, "It's at least a year away
from implementation." The typically tight-lipped New York Fed
allows through a spokesman that "we are at a highly
preliminary point."</p>
<p>Well, says Mr. Pura, the effort "is tentative, but the
important thing is that we have the dealers, the Fed and the
Treasury working together. The biggest hurdle has been
overcome."</p>
<p>While all of the Fed's 12 regional banks and 25 branches
accept bids for the auctions, the New York Fed typically
collects 80% to 90% of the competitive offers because it is
close to the nation's largest brokerage firms and commercial
banks.</p>
<p>Until auctions enter the computer age, the Treasury will
pay a hefty premium to finance its borrowing, many automation
proponents assert. That is because bidders usually add a
little extra to the interest rates they offer to pay on the
securities to compensate for the risk involved in waiting for
results, they say. "It's almost like a bit of an insurance
premium," says Mr. Liro of S.G. Warburg.</p>
<p>In a volatile market, where prices can move a full point
in minutes, or $10 for every $1,000 face amount of a 30-year
Treasury bond, there is a chance that prices of the
securities offered at the auction will have edged lower by
the time results are announced. That trims the returns to
dealers, who resell most of these securities to customers or
in the secondary market. Of course, the opposite sometimes
occurs and prices move higher during the wait, earning the
firms a better-than-expected profit.</p>
<p>But whether bidders win or lose, it is the Treasury that
pays for their risk, those who favor automation say. The
auctions are "a costly process for the Treasury and a
difficult one for dealers," says James R. Capra, a senior
vice president at Shearson Lehman Government Securities Inc.</p>
<p>Mr. Capra says the premium built into auction bids is
about what a broker would charge a client for a very
short-term option to sell bonds at a fixed price. In this
case, the broker's "customer" would be the Treasury and the
"option" would give the federal government the right to sell
securities late in the afternoon of auction day at the market
price of three hours earlier.</p>
<p>On the day that the Treasury last sold 30-year bonds, Feb.
8, the cost of a three-hour option to sell a 30-year bond was
1/4 point, or $2.50 for a $1,000 face amount, according to
data of GFI Group Inc., a broker of over-the-counter Treasury
bond options. That option cost twice as much as on a typical
day because the bond sale made the market jittery. Using Mr.
Capra's estimate of bidders' "cushion," the hidden cost to
the Treasury for the $10 billion of 30-year securities sold
in February was $25 million.</p>
<p>With automation, "hundreds of millions of dollars could be
saved over the years by the U.S. government," says Mr. Pura
of the securities group.</p>
<p>The Treasury's Mr. Basham concurs: "Even if it saved a
fraction on the $1.25 trillion of securities that are
auctioned each year, that's a substantial savings."</p>
<p>Not everybody agrees with these projections. Some dealers
say the auctions are so competitive that there is little, if
any, risk premium. "The savings would be minuscule," says
Scott E. Pardee, co-chairman of the U.S. unit of Yamaichi
Securities Co. and a former senior official at the New York
Fed.</p>
