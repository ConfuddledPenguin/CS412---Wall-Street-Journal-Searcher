	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- The Consumer Confidence Index in April gave up
the gain it posted in March because of "growing uneasiness
about jobs," said the Conference Board, a nonprofit,
nonpartisan group that compiles the indicator.
   The index fell to 106, a low point for 1990 and down 4.6
points from the revised 110.6 level for March, when the index
rose 3.5 points. The index uses 1985 as a base of 100.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Fabian Linden, executive director of the Board's Consumer
Research Center, attributed the loss in confidence to
jobmarket concerns. Though the unemployment rate has remained
unchanged at about 5% for months, the number of new jobs
dropped sharply in March.</p>
<p>In fact, 19.7% of consumers surveyed in March felt
business conditions were "bad," up 1.6 percentage points from
February. In April, that number eased slightly to 19.4%, but
the percentage of respondents who said they felt business
conditions were "good" fell 1.6 percentage points to 23.3%</p>
<p>And the outlook for the next six months isn't optimistic.
Respondents planning to buy an automobile dropped two
percentage points to 6.1%, and intentions to purchase a home
also were down. Plans to buy appliances were unchanged.</p>
<p>The monthly survey, covering 5,000 households throughout
the U.S., is conducted for the Board by National Family
Opinion Inc. of Toledo, Ohio.</p>
