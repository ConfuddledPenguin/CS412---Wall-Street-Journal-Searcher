	<p class="article-leader">BOSTON -- New England, which had little more than a dozen
failures of banks and thrift institutions in the past two
decades, faces a wave of insolvencies that could surpass that
total in the next couple of years, according to bankers,
securities analysts and regulators.
   The first edge of the wave arrived Friday, as federal
thrift regulators took control of Home Owners Savings Bank in
Burlington, Mass., and a smaller Massachusetts bank disclosed
that it is seeking financial assistance from the Federal
Deposit Insurance Corp.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Regulators privately acknowledge that they will soon be
stepping in at more New England institutions.</p>
<p>At least a dozen more banks from Connecticut to Maine have
seen their capital shrink to perilously slim levels in recent
months, and even more could find themselves tottering at the
brink of insolvency if the region's anemic real estate market
doesn't pick up soon, analysts say. Gerard Cassidy, a bank
analyst at Tucker Anthony Inc.'s Portland, Maine, office,
predicts "a minimum of two dozen bank and thrift closures
over the next three to four years, when this {real estate
glut} finally washes out."</p>
<p>Some companies have issued warnings to shareholders in
recent weeks. One Bancorp, a Portland company with $2.3
billion in assets, told investors that its "ability to
preserve any value in its securities would remain in doubt,"
unless it carries out an ambitious capital-recovery plan.
Eliot Bank, Boston, reported a $13.8 million deficit in
shareholders' equity and warned that "if additional capital
is not raised, it is expected that . . . regulatory agencies
would take such actions as they consider appropriate,
including the possible appointment of a receiver for the
bank."</p>
<p>Bank of New England Corp., one of the region's largest
commercial banks with more than $20 billion in assets, is
working on a plan to recover from a $1.1 billion loss last
year. But company officials have acknowledged that the plan's
success may hinge on the health of the New England economy.</p>
<p>Veribanc Inc., a Wakefield, Mass., company that rates the
financial condition of banks, placed 24 Massachusetts banks
in its "red" category in last year's fourth quarter, up from
two in the 1989 first quarter. The classification covers
institutions with equity of less than 3% of assets, or with a
net loss such that it may become insolvent in less than a
year if the loss continues at the same rate. In New
Hampshire, red-rated institutions jumped to 13 from zero last
year, and the number in Connecticut climbed to eight from
one.</p>
<p>That isn't to say that New England faces anywhere near the
problems that the Southwest faced in the 1980s. Despite
growing concern about a possible credit crunch in the region,
most banks remain fairly well capitalized. A study by the
Boston office of Grant Thornton, the accounting firm, found
that average equity capital for Massachusetts banks with
assets from $25 million to $500 million was 8.98% of assets,
still above the 8.65% for comparable banks nationwide. And,
so far at least, only scattered incidents of executive fraud
have been uncovered in New England.</p>
<p>But after long enjoying a reputation as among the soundest
and most conservative in the nation, many New England
financial institutions now find themselves paying the price
for recklessly aggressive commercial real-estate lending in
the mid-1980s. Many of the region's mutual savings banks
cashed in on Wall Street's bull market and New England's
new-found cachet by converting to stock ownership and issuing
shares during those years. With real-estate values soaring
throughout the region, most promptly raced to lend the
proceeds to developers.</p>
<p>But as the economy cooled in the past two years, scores of
developers were driven into bankruptcy and banks found
themselves trying to collect on unsold condominiums and
half-vacant office buildings, structures that in some cases
are now valued at half the original appraisals.</p>
<p>Few were as aggressive -- or as controversial -- as Home
Owners. After converting from mutual to stock ownership, the
company bought up mortgage-banking firms and savings-and-loan
associations around the country. It also invested heavily in
arcane mortgage-related assets whose estimated value depended
on assumptions about interest-rate movements and other
factors. The company's assets soared to more than $4 billion
from $547 million in 1984. But critics called it a house of
cards built with 1980s accounting gimmickry.</p>
<p>Whether or not those charges were true, it was apparent by
last fall that Home Owners would have a hard time surviving
under the new, more conservative thrift regulations. Albert
Holgerson Jr., who led the company throughout the 1980s, was
forced out by federal regulators. Remaining company officials
said they would try to turn back the clock, returning to the
plain-vanilla business of taking deposits and making loans.
But a loss of nearly $130 million in the quarter ended Sept.
30 left the company badly crippled.</p>
<p>The Office of Thrift Supervision said it had placed Home
Owners under government conservatorship because it "was
operating in an unsafe and unsound manner." The agency also
noted that the company had negative tangible capital
amounting to $106.3 million at Dec. 31.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Home National Corp. of Milford, Mass., said it
expects a $4.8 million first-quarter loss to reduce its
shareholders' equity to a deficit of at least $4.1 million.
The company, which has $486 million in assets, said its Home
National Bank subsidiary has asked the FDIC for a capital
injection that would enable it to continue operating, a form
of government assistance that has been granted to some banks
in Texas and Oklahoma.</p>
