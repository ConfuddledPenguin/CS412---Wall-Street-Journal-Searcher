	<p class="article-leader">First Bank System Inc., Minneapolis, said it reached an
out-of-court settlement of a lawsuit filed in 1988 against
the company in connection with the investment strategies of
its bond portfolio, a major portion of which was sold in
1988.
   The bank-holding company said the agreement won't result
in a loss to First Bank or a cash benefit to shareholders
other than the six plaintiffs, who will receive "nominal
payments."</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>First Bank said its insurance carrier will pay $2.5
million to the company, which will be used primarily to pay
costs associated with the lawsuit.</p>
<p>As part of the agreement, First Bank said it agreed to add
an outside director who has senior investment-services
experience; revise and formalize guidelines and policies
relating to its remaining bond portfolio; and retain an
independent expert to advise it on the management of the bond
portfolio and balance sheet.</p>
