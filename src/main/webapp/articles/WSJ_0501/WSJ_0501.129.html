	<p class="article-leader">DALLAS -- A.H. Belo Corp. said the Federal Communications
Commission dismissed a complaint filed by the Dallas Times
Herald calling for Belo's Dallas television license to be
revoked.
   In a complaint filed last year, the Dallas Times Herald
charged that a recent agreement between Belo, owner of the
Dallas Morning News and WFAA-TV in Dallas, and Universal
Press Syndicate was intended to reduce media competition in
Dallas.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>As part of the Belo-Universal Press agreement, Universal
Press moved 26 features, including "Doonesbury," "The Far
Side" and "Dear Abby," to the Morning News from the Times
Herald. The agreement called for the two companies to study
developing television programs based on Universal's features
and to develop an advertising campaign for newspapers using
Universal's characters.</p>
<p>Belo said the FCC found that the Times Herald failed to
establish a case against it. The Times Herald, owned by DTH
Media Inc., couldn't be reached for comment.</p>
<p>A trial is under way in state court in Houston in which
the Times Herald has charged Belo and the Morning News with
violating antitrust laws and interfering with its contract.
Belo said a decision in that case is expected within a few
days.</p>
