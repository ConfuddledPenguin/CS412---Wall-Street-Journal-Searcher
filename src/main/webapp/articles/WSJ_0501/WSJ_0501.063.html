	<p class="article-leader">EMPLOYERS CASUALTY Co., Dallas, said its directors voted
to omit a quarterly cash dividend for June because of poor
operating results in the first quarter. The company last paid
a 10-cent dividend in March. The insurance concern reported a
loss of $9.1 million, or 91 cents a share, for the quarter. A
year earlier, the company reported net income of $5.5
million, or 55 cents a share. Separately, the company said
Ernest L. Proud Jr., formerly executive vice president, was
elected president and chief executive officer. Mr. Proud
succeeds Dewey Williams, who retired as president, and
assumes the duties of former Chief Executive Officer John F.
Stephens, who remains chairman.</p>
