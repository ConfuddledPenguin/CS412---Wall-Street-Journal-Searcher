	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- The quarterly Wall Street Journal-Wilshire
Associates study of asset allocation includes the 10
brokerage houses with the largest number of registered
representatives.
   Some companies publish more than one set of
asset-allocation recommendations. Within reason, they may
pick which set they want to be judged by, provided they
specify in advance. Two companies, PaineWebber Inc. and
Goldman, Sachs & Co., recently changed the asset-allocation
blend tracked in the study.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>PaineWebber formerly used a theoretical asset-allocation
model developed by Edward Kerschner and Charles Pradilla. Its
neutral reading calls for a 33.3% position in each of three
assets, stocks, bonds, and cash. As of Jan. 31, PaineWebber
asked to be judged, instead, on its advice for a typical
balanced portfolio, in which stocks normally have heavier
weight.</p>
<p>Goldman Sachs, previously judged on its advice to large
pension funds, has asked to be judged as of March 31 on its
advice for a smaller, aggressive pension fund. Strategist
Steven Einhorn said he believes this advice more closely
approximates what individual investors should follow.</p>
<p>Other companies with more than one asset-allocation blend
are tracked as follows:</p>
<p>Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. is judged on its
recommendations for a "small, aggressive fund"; A.G. Edwards
& Sons Inc. on a "growth and income" portfolio; Kidder,
Peabody & Co. on an "individual balanced" portfolio, and
Raymond, James & Associates Inc. on advice to "young urban
professionals."</p>
<p>The study disregards the cost of trading, mainly to make
the results comparable to market averages. In practice, of
course, people who often adjust their investment blends may
incur high commissions.</p>
<p>Each house's advice is mirrored in a theoretical
portfolio. Holdings are adjusted whenever the advice changes,
and also on the last day of each month, to keep assets in the
recommended ratio.</p>
<p>Investments are assumed to do as well as the following
indexes: the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index for stocks;
the Merrill Lynch corporate and government master bond index
for bonds; 90-day Treasury bills for cash; the National
Council of Real Estate Investment Fiduciaries/Frank Russell
Co. index for real estate; and the average monthly price of
gold for tangible assets.</p>
