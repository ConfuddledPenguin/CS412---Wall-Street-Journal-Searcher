	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- United Parcel Service faces possible federal
fines of $625,000 on charges of worker-safety violations
after a call from Nassau County, N.Y., police warned OSHA
that a UPS driver was injured by a hazardous chemical carried
by his delivery truck.
   The Labor Department's Occupational Safety and Health
Administration charged UPS with 312 willful record-keeping
violations at its Uniondale, N.Y., facility, including 310
instances of improper recording of employees on restricted
work activity. OSHA said it has issued numerous citations for
record-keeping violations by UPS over the past 16 years.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>United Parcel Service of America Inc., the closely held
package-delivery company based in Greenwich, Conn., said it
was studying the complaint and hadn't decided on a response.
Most of the citation, however, dealt with "alleged violations
of written procedures and guidelines," which are "complex and
subject to conflicting interpretations," UPS said.</p>
<p>The company also was cited for failure to develop an
emergency response plan, or to train all workers in how to
respond to an emergency involving hazardous materials, and
for not supplying a proper respirator for employees handling
hazardous-materials spills.</p>
<p>OSHA said its inspection of the Uniondale facility
resulted from a call from the Nassau County police
hazardous-materials team, after methylene chloride, a
suspected carcinogen, spilled from a box bound for delivery
in the truck. The driver touched the chemical, then put his
hand to his face, sustaining hand and facial injuries, OSHA
said.</p>
<p>UPS has 15 working days to contest the citations before
the independent Occupational Safety and Health Review
Commission.</p>
