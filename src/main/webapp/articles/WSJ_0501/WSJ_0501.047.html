	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Vernitron Corp. resurrected its bid for
Kollmorgen Corp., even though the two companies are suing
each other over a previous, collapsed merger agreement.
   Vernitron, a closely held motors and controls company
based in Deer Park, N.Y., said it is prepared to offer $15 a
share for Kollmorgen if it wins a proxy contest to control
Kollmorgen's board.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>A successful proxy solicitation and takeover offer would
win Kollmorgen at about half the price Vernitron was willing
to pay last year for the motors, controls and electro-optical
company.</p>
<p>The circumstances of Vernitron's abandoned bid last
September, just a week before it was to close, are in
dispute. Vernitron has asserted that Kollmorgen's business
"deteriorated dramatically" before the acquisition was to
take place, and that Vernitron became aware of other factors
that caused it to terminate the merger.</p>
<p>Kollmorgen, based in Simsbury, Conn., asserts Vernitron
violated its merger agreement.</p>
<p>A "standstill" agreement and certain court orders
preventing Vernitron from soliciting proxies or taking other
steps to arrange a purchase of Kollmorgen expired Sunday.</p>
<p>Vernitron, which holds a 5.54% interest in Kollmorgen,
said that if its proxy solicitation is successful, it will
seek to auction off the company. Vernitron will be among the
bidders, offering shareholders either $15 a share in cash or
a unit of one share of common in a merged company and the
right to receive a share of proceeds from sale of
Kollmorgen's Electro-Optical division.</p>
<p>At $15 a share, the new Vernitron offer would give the
Kollmorgen shares an indicated value totaling $160.5 million,
or about half the $320 million Vernitron agreed to pay to
acquire a larger company just a year ago. Earlier this year,
Kollmorgen sold its circuit board business and other assets
for about $50 million.</p>
<p>Stephen Bershad, Vernitron chairman and chief executive
officer, said Vernitron decided against making a hostile
tender offer because of Kollmorgen's shareholder rights plan,
and because of a strict New York anti-takeover law. He said
Vernitron has "already spent about $18 million on this
transaction," and that it plans to spend an additional $2
million. But he said Vernitron would give up if it loses the
proxy fight.</p>
<p>John L. Youngblood, Kollmorgen's chairman, president and
chief executive, said directors would review the latest
proposal.</p>
