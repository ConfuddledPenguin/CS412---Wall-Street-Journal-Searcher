	<p class="article-leader">Material Sciences Corp., which recently reported a big
loss for fiscal 1990, said its board is reviewing "various
strategic and financial alternatives" for the company.
   Last month, the maker of coatings and laminates said
charges from the sale of a unit and a write-down of some
assets led to a loss of $30.4 million, or $6.10 a share, for
the year ended Feb. 28. Sales were $152.7 million.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>A spokesman said the board is "very concerned" about the
value put on the Elk Grove Village, Ill., company by the
stock market. In American Stock Exchange composite trading
yesterday, the stock was unchanged at $9.25, its 52-week low.
The company's announcement came after the close of trading.
The spokesman said the board believes the company is "worth
much more than $45 million," the indicated market value based
on its nearly five million shares outstanding. The company
wouldn't say what alternatives it's exploring.</p>
