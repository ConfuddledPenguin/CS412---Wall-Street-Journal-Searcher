	<p class="article-leader">LONDON -- Allied Irish Banks PLC offered to buy Baltimore
Bancorp. for $217 million, expanding the big Irish bank's
U.S. presence and continuing the spate of U.S. bids by
overseas companies.
   The bid, made in a letter Friday to Baltimore Bancorp.'s
board from AIB's First Maryland Bancorp unit, is "unsolicited
but friendly," said Diarmuid Moore, director of strategy for
Dublin-based AIB. In a phone interview, he didn't rule out a
hostile bid if AIB's overture is rejected. But, he added, "we
are very anxious to conclude a friendly deal, and think the
offer represents full and fair value."</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Though Baltimore said its board will consider the
$17-a-share bid "in due course," the bank indicated yesterday
it considers the offer unwelcome. In a letter to First
Maryland, Baltimore Chairman Harry L. Robinson took "direct
issue with {First Maryland's} statement that the offer is
delivered `in a spirit of cordiality and goodwill.' " Mr.
Robinson said AIB didn't call to say the bid was coming, and
requested a response by tomorrow. Such moves "could have only
been designed to create a hostile atmosphere and to place
pressure upon us. Please rest assured that we will not be
cowed by these tactics."</p>
<p>AIB's First Maryland unit already has amassed a 4.9%
Baltimore stake for about $6.7 million. The offer values the
entire company's roughly 12.8 million common shares
outstanding at about $217 million.</p>
<p>At roughly a 47% premium to Baltimore Bancorp.'s Friday
close of $11.75 a share on the New York Stock Exchange, the
offer seems aimed at elbowing out other potential suitors. It
values Baltimore Bancorp. at 12.7 times 1989 earnings and
about 1.1 times tangible net worth, according to AIB.</p>
<p>People involved in the bid expect Baltimore to seek a
white-knight counterbidder, if the board chooses to fight.
Baltimore "would probably consider a white knight," said
AIB's Mr. Moore. "But we would be surprised if there is a
better offer. We didn't start on basis of pitching it {the
bid} low and trying to get it for free." Analysts added that
recent jitters in the U.S. financial industry because of
souring real-estate lending may keep interest low.</p>
<p>In March, Standard & Poor's Corp. lowered ratings on about
$72 million of Baltimore subordinated debt to double-B-plus
from triple-B, citing the firm's "substantial concentration"
in commercial real estate lending and volatile funding
sources.</p>
<p>In composite trading yesterday on the New York Stock
Exchange, Baltimore shares closed at $15, up $3.25.</p>
<p>Shares in AIB, which also announced a 1-for-6
share-purchase right to raise 162 million Irish pounds
($259.5 million) to help finance the purchase and for general
purposes, fell 14 pence to 235 pence on London's Stock
Exchange.</p>
<p>Baltimore would be a significant addition to AIB's network
in the mid-Atlantic states, and would continue an expansion
by big overseas banks in U.S. retail banking. Such banks as
National Westminster Bank PLC, Royal Bank of Scotland and
many Japanese banks already are amassing significant retail
presences on America's East and West Coasts as squeezed
margins at home are making the U.S. market seem more
alluring.</p>
<p>U.S. targets also seem reasonably priced, and the weakened
U.S. market for junk securities has hamstrung some domestic
U.S. bidders. Against that backdrop, overseas bidders have
been snapping up U.S. assets lately. More than $2 billion in
deals have been announced in the past week alone, including
the purchases of retailer Saks Fifth Avenue and industrial
group Norton Co.</p>
<p>AIB already is Maryland's second-biggest bank after
acquiring control of Baltimore's First Maryland Bancorp in
1988 for a total of $520 million. Buying fifth-largest
Baltimore Bancorp., also based in Baltimore, would boost its
asset base in the area by $3.4 billion to about $11 billion.
But it would still remain well behind leader MNC Financial
Inc., with about $23 billion in assets.</p>
<p>Analysts favor AIB to win the battle. Chris Wheeler, a
banking analyst at Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. in London
said, "I think they are going to win. AIB obviously is
offering a hell of a premium in what is a worrying banking
market." But, he added, "I think the reason they announced
now was they were worried someone else may be out there." en</p>
<p>Rodgin Cohen at Sullivan and Cromwell in New York, who is
representing Baltimore Bancorp., said this is the first time
a foreign bank has launched a hostile transaction.</p>
<p>"Because of the way it came, it has to be treated as a
hostile offer," Mr. Cohen said, noting that First Maryland
delivered a letter to his client late Friday afternoon and
then released it to the media soon afterwards. "You just
don't do things like that and call it a friendly deal."</p>
<p>He added that he has always advised foreign banks to avoid
hostile deals because the Federal Reserve increases its
scrutiny and forces them to play by the same rules as U.S.
banks, which can be more restrictive than foreign rules.</p>
