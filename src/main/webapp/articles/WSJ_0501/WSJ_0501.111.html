	<p class="article-leader">Kay Jewelers Inc., which had warned investors and analysts
that first-quarter results would be weak, reported a loss of
$5.6 million, or 45 cents a share.
   The loss exceeded the loss of $3.8 million, or 31 cents a
share, the Alexandria, Va.-based jewelry chain posted a year
earlier. Sales fell to $76.5 million from $79.4 million.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Company officials said higher interest costs from last
year's debt offering and higher borrowing to finance the
opening of new stores hurt results.</p>
<p>As part of a cost-containment program, openings of new
stores have been cut to limit expenses. Kay is slashing
annual operating expenses $14 million.</p>
<p>Sales remained sluggish in January, after a weak fourth
quarter. But the company said sales picked up a bit towards
the end of the quarter.</p>
