	<p class="article-leader">Imperial Chemical Industries PLC, a British chemical and
pharmaceutical concern, said first-quarter pretax profit fell
6% to #414 million ($677.1 million) from $442 million a year
earlier.
   But the results still were far better than market
expectations, which ranged from #340 million to #380 million.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Profit after taxes and minority interests fell 1.1% to
#265 million from #268 million a year earlier. Per-share
earnings eased 2.8% to 38.1 pence from 39.2 pence.</p>
<p>Sales rose 7.5% to #3.45 billion from #3.21 billion.</p>
<p>Chairman Denys Henderson said earnings were "relatively
encouraging in a period of considerable economic
uncertainty." Pretax profit was hit by declining profit
margins in general chemicals, petrochemicals and plastic
products, amid sagging demand world-wide, ICI said, but
strong sales in pharmaceuticals and agrichemicals helped
offset this decline.</p>
