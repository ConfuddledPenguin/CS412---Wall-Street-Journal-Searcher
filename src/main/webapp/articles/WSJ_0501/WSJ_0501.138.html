	<p class="article-leader">JACKSONVILLE, Fla. -- Cargill Inc. has been ordered by a
U.S. District Court judge to renew its contract with a
northern Florida chicken grower.
   Under such contracts, Cargill delivers baby chicks to
growers, who raise them and are paid per pound by Cargill for
the weight the chickens gain.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Cargill quit delivering baby chicks to Arthur Gaskins,
president of the Northeast Florida Broiler Growers'
Association, in August after that group filed a lawsuit
against the big, Minneapolis-based agribusiness concern. That
continuing lawsuit alleges, among other things, that Cargill
underpaid the chicken growers.</p>
<p>The case was discussed in a page one story in The Wall
Street Journal in January detailing the plight of chicken
growers around the country.</p>
<p>Mr. Gaskins had petitioned the court for a preliminary
injunction requiring Cargill to continue to do business with
the chicken farmer.</p>
<p>In his order granting a motion for preliminary injunction,
Judge John H. Moore ruled that Mr. Gaskins and the U.S.
Justice Department, which has joined the ongoing growers'
case, have a substantial likelihood of winning their case on
several claims, including the claim that Cargill terminated
Gaskins in order to discourage growers from supporting the
growers' organization.</p>
<p>A spokesman for Cargill said the company received the
order late yesterday and "will be studying the next
appropriate action on our part."</p>
