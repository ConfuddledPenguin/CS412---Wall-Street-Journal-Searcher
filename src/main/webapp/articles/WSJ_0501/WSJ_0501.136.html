	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- A U.S. Court of Appeals here ruled last week
that Chugai Pharmaceutical Co. didn't infringe a patent held
by Amgen Inc. when Chugai imported erythropoietin, an
anti-anemia drug, into the U.S.
   In January 1988, Amgen asked the U.S. International Trade
Commission to block Tokyo-based Chugai's importation of the
gene-spliced drug. A year ago, an administrative law judge at
the commission dismissed Amgen's request. Amgen appealed the
decision.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Technically, the commission dismissed Amgen's request on
the basis that the commission didn't have jurisdiction. The
appeals court ruled that the commission should have dismissed
Amgen's request for the reason that the request lacked merit
and not because the commission lacked jurisdiction.</p>
<p>In Thousand Oaks, Calif., an Amgen spokesman said the
ruling "leaves the door open" for further efforts to block
Chugai's importation of the drug. "We have a whole series of
applications pending before the patent office, which offer
the opportunity to go back to the {commission}."</p>
<p>Chugai has licensed its version of the drug from Genetics
Institute Inc., Cambridge, Mass. Amgen and Genetics Institute
are embroiled in separate legal actions over patent rights to
erythropoietin. Amgen's version, called Epogen, is the only
version that has been approved for sale by U.S. regulatory
authorities. Chugai's version is currently limited in the
U.S. to clinical tests only.</p>
