	<p class="article-leader">Diet Pepsi endorsers Mike Tyson and Robin Givens ended up
in divorce court. Beef shill Cybill Shepherd admitted she
doesn't eat meat. Let's face it: Why bother with troublesome,
potentially embarrassing human spokesmen when you can have
Bugs Bunny instead?
   That, at least, is the hope of Time Warner's Warner Bros.
unit, which is kicking off a big campaign to promote Bugs and
the rest of the Looney Tunes cartoons as commercial pitchmen.
Using Bugs Bunny's 50th birthday this year as a hook, Warner
is touting the endorsement potential not just of Bugs but of
his 100-plus fellow "toons." Among other things, Warner is
plugging the possibilities in 32-page advertising inserts in
five current Time publications, including a Fortune insert
headlined, "Why Warner Bros. Cartoon Characters Make
Excellent Business Partners."</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Warner's Looney Tunes join a growing list of cartoon icons
who are selling out. Mickey Mouse and Walt Disney's other
animated characters are almost everywhere, pitching
everything from Chevrolet's Lumina to Ultra Pampers diapers
to McDonald's. Snoopy, meanwhile, has gone commercial in a
big way this year as he celebrates his 40th birthday. As if
pitching Metropolitan Life insurance weren't enough, he's
added A&W Root Beer, Chex Party Mix, and General Electric for
its Miser light bulbs, among others.</p>
<p>"Disney and Snoopy both have been promoted widely," says
Dan Romanelli, president of world-wide merchandising for
Warner. "Looney Tunes have been underexposed for years, as
far as I'm concerned. We feel there's significant potential."</p>
<p>Warner is pursuing its mission with such zest, though,
that some ad executives question whether overkill can be far
behind. After all, this is the movie company that
merchandised "Batman" to such excess that a quick death for
the frenzied Bat-fad was inevitable. While Bat-paraphernalia
raked in an estimated $500 million in retail sales while it
was hot, it's stone-dead as a Pet Rock now. Last year's Bat
T-shirt is buried at the bottom of the closet, forgotten in
this year's frenzy to collect Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles
and Simpsons gear.</p>
<p>"The one thing that will kill a character in the long term
is overexposure in the short term," says Al Ries, a marketing
consultant with Trout & Ries. "You can go over the line, and
I think you'll find that ruins it -- just like Batman is dead
and I expect next year Teenage Ninja Turtles will be four
turtles floating belly-up."</p>
<p>Indeed, Warner may be courting overkill already. Its
licensing push has barely begun, and already it has awarded
about 150 licenses for its Looney Tunes characters, primarily
Bugs Bunny. Some of those licenses have been around for
years, such as those for Bugs Bunny merchandise. But a
growing number are product endorsements: Bugs will grace
General Mills' Cheerios boxes and ads through summer. He'll
appear on canisters of Brach's jelly beans. He and the other
Looney Tunes will sell a new line of kids' microwave dinners
from Tyson Foods, called Looney Tunes meals. Holiday Inn is
planning a promotion around Bugs and friends, as are Shell
and McDonald's.</p>
<p>With all that, Warner is trying to come up with even more.
"I don't think you can ever overexpose Bugs," insists
Warner's Mr. Romanelli.</p>
<p>He adds that endorsement offers for Bugs and the other
characters are screened carefully and that inappropriate
offers have been turned down.</p>
<p>Warner is so sure of Bugs's endorsement and merchandising
potential that it is predicting licensing revenue will double
by 1992 from about $50 million last year. That revenue
encompasses all of Warner's properties, including its movies.
Just a few years ago, licensing revenue from the Looney Tunes
characters was "fairly negligible," says Sandy Reisenbach,
Warner's executive vice president for marketing and planning.
Licensees typically pay anywhere from 1% to more than 5% of
wholesale sales for the privilege of using a character.</p>
<p>To get even more companies thinking about Bugs as a
pitchman, Warner placed the advertising inserts in Time,
People, Life, Entertainment Weekly, and Fortune. Each 32-page
insert was slightly different. A 64-page free-standing
magazine compiled from the inserts will be sold in movie
theaters this summer, when a new cartoon short, "Box Office
Bunny," will be running. The multimillion-dollar magazine
package was negotiated with Time's magazine unit before last
year's Time Warner merger, executives involved say.</p>
<p>While four of the five inserts are mainly consumer
oriented, the Fortune insert is geared specifically to sell
Bugs to corporations. It profiles Mr. Romanelli and
highlights Bugs merchandise such as watches (retailing at up
to $100), chess sets ($500) and gold charm bracelets ($600).
It boasts about endorsements Bugs has already lined up, such
as the Tyson Foods and Cheerios deals, and promotes "the
wisdom of pairing . . . consumer products with Warner Bros.'
popular and durable spokescreatures."</p>
<p>"We're looking to announce to the world, `Look what we've
got, guys,'" Mr. Reisenbach says. "We utilized the birthday
as a spearhead for the promotion" of the characters'
endorsement potential.</p>
<p>The magazine inserts are just the tip of a marketing
effort that includes Warner executives talking up scores of
companies on the appeal of Looney Tunes. Then there are the
special events surrounding Bugs's birthday, such as "Box
Office Bunny" and a prime-time TV special. Warner this fall
will also introduce a brand new cast of characters, Tiny
Toons -- basically baby versions of Bugs, Porky Pig and the
rest -- with a prime-time special and a new weekly series
executive-produced by Steven Spielberg. It's hoping Tiny
Toons will become another merchandising gold mine.</p>
<p>"You might well ask yourself, is this overkill? Is there
room for all of this?" says Henry Scott, director of
merchandise for the children's division of retailer J.C.
Penney. But Mr. Scott believes the Tiny Toons will be a hit.
And as for the rest of the Looney Tunes bunch, "It's got
great characters, and they're a viable media for any kind of
advertiser. There's been a lot of Mickey and a lot of Disney.
It may well be time for Looney Tunes to have a resurgence."</p>

<p>Thrifty Account Shift</p>
<p>Thrifty Rent-A-Car System, Tulsa, Okla., awarded its $7
million ad account to a joint venture of Advertising Inc. and
Ciociola & Co.</p>
<p>Advertising Inc., also based in Tulsa, previously handled
the account alone. Thrifty said it threw the account into
review "to find new creative avenues." The link with
Ciociola, a small New York shop, helped Advertising Inc. save
the business, a Thrifty spokesman said. The combined agency's
first campaign is expected in August.</p>
<p>Thrifty also heard presentations from GSD&M of Austin,
Texas, and Ross Roy in Detroit.</p>

<p>Ad Notes. . . .</p>
<p>NBC/GENERAL MOTORS: As expected, NBC said it signed a
multiyear agreement with General Motors that industry
executives said is worth well over $500 million over three
years. NBC, a unit of General Electric, wouldn't disclose the
terms of the agreement, except to say it represents the
largest commitment ever made by an advertiser in television
ad sales history.</p>
<p>BEAUTY TITLE: Conde Nast, New York, said its new beauty
magazine, set to be launched in March 1991, will be called
Allure.</p>
<p>SMIRNOFF RETURN: Heublein, whose Smirnoff vodka was
banished from Russia by the Bolsheviks, is trumpeting the
brand's return to Soviet duty-free shops with print ads in
the U.S. The ads, created by McCann-Erickson, carry the tag
line, "Back in the U.S.S.R."</p>
