	<p class="article-leader">The New York Stock Exchange said it is reviewing the
financial eligibility of Financial Corp. of Santa Barbara for
continued listing on the exchange, following last week's
seizure by federal regulators of the company's thrift unit.
   The Santa Barbara, Calif., concern, whose Santa Barbara
Savings & Loan Association is its main unit, didn't return
phone calls yesterday seeking comment. The parent expressed
surprise last Friday when regulators seized the weak thrift
and placed it in conservatorship.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Santa Barbara Savings is one of several of California's
biggest S&Ls that have failed recently, or are in danger of
failing, because of the latest wave of problems brought on by
ill-fated diversification, either outside the state or
outside traditional home-lending.</p>
