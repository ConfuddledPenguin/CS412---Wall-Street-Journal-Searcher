	<p class="article-leader">MIDLAND, Texas -- Insilco Corp. said it will file today
with the Securities and Exchange Commission a plan to swap
about $488 million in face amount of debt for new debt, cash
and stock.
   The holding company, which was taken private in 1988 in an
$812.8 million buy-out by Texas oil men Cyril Wagner and Jack
E. Brown, said in recent federal filings that if economic
conditions continue or worsen, its cash flow may not reach
desirable levels. It also said that current economic
conditions have led its management to believe that if a quick
liquidation of the company were required, it might not be
able to satisfy all its potential creditor claims.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Under terms of its exchange offer, Insilco said it plans
to offer $250 cash and $400 face amount of new 12% senior
subordinated notes due 1998 for each $1,000 face amount of
its $270 million of 15% senior subordinated notes due 1999.</p>
<p>It also plans to offer $63 face amount of new 12% senior
subordinated notes and 38 shares of convertible preferred
stock for each $724.91 in accreted value of its subordinated
discount debentures. The company has about $218 million face
amount of the zero-coupon bonds, which currently have an
accreted value of about $157 million.</p>
<p>Insilco said the cash for its exchange offer will come
from bank borrowings under its revolving credit facility and
the purchase of $20 million in convertible preferred stock by
its controlling shareholders.</p>
<p>Terms of the exchange offers also call for most of the
covenants of the old debt to be eliminated.</p>
<p>The company said the offer is contingent on at least 90%
of the face amount outstanding of each of the two debt issues
being tendered.</p>
<p>Insilco, which makes Rolodex office products, metal parts,
and electronics and communications equipment, had a net loss
of $43.4 million on sales of $762.2 million in 1989. Using
proceeds from assets sold during 1989 and early 1990, it said
it has repaid $121 million on its bank term loan, including
the total amount due this year.</p>
