	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Bond prices rose after Federal Reserve Board
Chairman Alan Greenspan spoke about the economy, which
provided a brief flurry of excitement in an otherwise dull
trading day.
   In a speech to purchasing managers in New Orleans, Mr.
Greenspan said recent economic data suggest there will be
"somewhere between modest and moderate growth in factory
output over the coming year."</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>His remarks were interpreted by some investors as a sign
that the Fed is comfortable with the current pace of economic
activity, and, therefore, isn't ready to raise interest
rates.</p>
<p>Mr. Greenspan "took some of the steam out of concerns that
the Fed might tighten over the near term," said David Jones,
a senior vice president and economist at Aubrey G. Lanston &
Co.</p>
<p>Although Mr. Greenspan didn't provide any new information
about the health of the economy, "the market seemed to be
heartened by his comments," said Elizabeth Reiners, a vice
president and money-market economist at Dean Witter Reynolds
Inc. She said bond prices had barely moved all day prior to
Mr. Greenspan's speech. But after his comments were reported
by wire services, "the market started to pop a little bit,"
she said.</p>
<p>The benchmark 30-year Treasury bond ended about 1/4 point
higher, a gain of about $2.50 for a bond with a $1,000 face
amount. Tax-exempt bonds and mortgage-backed securities
finished unchanged to as much as 1/4 point higher. But prices
of actively traded junk bonds were unchanged to as much as
two points lower.</p>
<p>Except for the brief flurry of trading after Mr.
Greenspan's remarks, the bond market was quiet. That partly
reflected the reluctance of investors to make investment
decisions ahead of today's release of the April index of the
nation's purchasing agents, tomorrow's announcement of the
size of the Treasury's next quarterly refunding and Friday's
data on April employment. Also, holidays in Japan and several
European countries kept many major foreign players away from
the market.</p>
<p>"People are gun-shy ahead of a lot of new information,"
said Ms. Reiners.</p>
<p>The purchasing agents' survey and the employment report
are viewed as significant because they will provide the first
look at how the economy fared at the start of the second
quarter.</p>
<p>The April index of the National Association of Purchasing
Management is expected to move up slightly to 48.9%,
according to the average of estimates of nine economists
surveyed by Dow Jones Capital Markets Report. The index rose
to 48.8% in March from 48.3% in February. An index below 50%
suggests a contracting industrial sector and an index above
50% suggests activity is expanding. The index has been below
50% for 11 straight months.</p>
<p>The Chicago purchasing agents' April index, which was
released yesterday, showed that Chicago-area business
activity fell to 54.2% in April on an unadjusted basis from
an unrevised 55.1% in March. The market shrugged off the
report.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, analysts expect the Treasury to increase the
size of next week's quarterly refunding by $500 million to as
much as $1 billion to help meet increased borrowing needs
tied to the thrift industry bailout.</p>
<p>Ms. Reiners expects a $31 billion refunding package, up
from the $30 billion sold at the last quarterly debt sales in
February. The economist expects the Treasury to sell $10.25
billion of new three-year notes, $10.25 billion of 10-year
notes and $10.5 billion of new 30-year bonds.</p>
<p>Corporate Issues</p>
<p>Concerns that insurance companies and the Resolution Trust
Corp. will begin to sell more junk bonds shook the $200
billion market, driving prices of most active high-yield,
high-risk issues as much as two points lower. The RTC is the
thrift bailout agency.</p>
<p>Traders said most of the selling came from dealers
scrambling to reduce their positions in anticipation of
further declines in the market.</p>
<p>American Standard's 12 7/8% senior subordinated
debentures, maturing in 2000, gave up a point to end at 94;
Duracell Holdings Corp.'s 13 1/2% subordinated debentures,
due in 2000, lost 1/2 point to close at 100 3/4; and Turner
Broadcasting Systems' 12% senior subordinated debentures,
maturing in 2001, shed a point to end at a bid price of 99
1/2.</p>
<p>Also hurt were the junk bonds of Trump Plaza Funding and
related entities. Trump Plaza's 12 7/8% bonds lost 3 1/2
points to close at 81 1/2 after weakening significantly
Friday. Trump Taj Mahal Funding also suffered bruising
losses, declining four points to finish at 69.</p>
<p>The bonds had begun to sink Friday on news that casino and
real estate developer Donald Trump may sell the Trump shuttle
and other major assets. Some members of the financial
community speculate that Mr. Trump is hoarding cash to meet a
future cash crunch. But Mr. Trump has denied that he is
suffering a cash-flow crisis.</p>
<p>Junk also has been hurt by attempts to rein in junk bond
investing by insurance companies. Under rule changes being
devised by the National Association of Insurance
Commissioners, insurance companies would be required to build
up larger statutory reserves faster than before for a
majority of their junk bond holdings.</p>
<p>The difference would be especially critical for about 400
speculative, single-B-rated bonds that had been treated as
"yes" bonds or solid investments under the old reserve
system.</p>
<p>In the investment-grade market, bond prices ended
unchanged to as much as 1/8 point higher.</p>
<p>Among new investment-grade issues, two subsidiaries of U S
West Inc., Mountain States Telephone & Telegraph Co. and
Northwest Bell Telephone Co., sold a total of $175 million of
10-year notes.</p>
<p>The debt offerings add to the relatively limited supply of
intermediate-term telephone issues. Like utilities, telephone
companies tend to sell long-term debt to finance extended
capital improvement projects.</p>
<p>Roger Fox, director of capital markets at U S West, said
the company decided to issue intermediate-term debt because
"it fit well with our existing maturity schedule. We don't
have anything maturing in or around the year 2000," he said.</p>
<p>Mr. Fox said the company may issue $100 million in
long-term debt later this year to refinance short-term debt.</p>
<p>Treasury Securities</p>
<p>The benchmark 30-year bond ended at a price of 94 26/32 to
yield 8.989%, compared with 94 17/32 to yield 9.02% on
Friday. The latest 10-year notes ended at 96 17/32 to yield
9.02%, compared with 96 13/32 to yield 9.04%.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, short-term interest rates moved higher at the
government's weekly Treasury bill auction.</p>
<p>The government sold $16.84 billion of three-month and
six-month Treasury bills. The average discount rate for
three-month Treasury bills was set at 7.91% for a
bond-equivalent yield of 8.18%.</p>
<p>The average discount rate for six-month bills was 8.03%
for a bond-equivalent yield of 8.49%. That was the highest
discount rate at an auction since June 19, 1989, when the
average rate was set at 8.08%.</p>
<p>Here are auction details:</p>
<p>Rates are determined by the difference between the
purchase price and face value. Thus, higher bidding narrows
the investor's return while lower bidding widens it. The
percentage rates are calculated on a 360-day year, while the
coupon-equivalent yield is based on a 365-day year.</p>
<p>                               13-Week        26-Week</p>

<p>Coupon equivalent .....            8.18%            8.49%</p>
<p>Both issues are dated May 3. The 13-week bills mature Aug.
2, 1990, and the 26-week bills mature Nov. 1, 1990.</p>
<p>Mortgage-Backed Securities</p>
<p>Mortgage securities ended 1/32 to 6/32 higher.</p>
<p>Government National Mortgage Association 9% securities for
May delivery ended at 93 19/32, up 6/32; 9 1/2% securities
were at 96 5/32, up 5/32; 10% securities were at 98 3/4, up
1/32; and Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp. 9 1/2% securities
were at 95 31/32, up 2/32.</p>
<p>The Ginnie Mae 9% issue was yielding 10.10% to a 12-year
average life assumption, as the spread above the Treasury
10-year note held at 1.09 percentage points.</p>
<p>In the derivative market, the Federal National Mortgage
Association issued a $300 million real estate mortgage
investment conduit backed by its 10% securities through
Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc.</p>
<p>There's talk that new Remics backed by Fannie Mae 9 1/2%
securities, Fannie Mae 10% securities, Ginnie Mae 9 1/2%
securities and Ginnie Mae 10% securities soon will be
announced.</p>
<p>Municipals</p>
<p>Actively traded bonds finished flat to 1/4 point higher
after a sleepy session in which municipals tracked the
Treasury market's every move.</p>
<p>Overall, traders said the nervous municipal bond market
remains jittery before the Treasury's refunding next week,
which is expected to bring at least $30 billion of new issues
to the market.</p>
<p>"People are still afraid of the refunding," said a New
York trader, adding that the market may not have much of an
appetite for municipal bonds for a while.</p>
<p>New Jersey Turnpike Authority's 7.20% issue of 2018
finished 1/4 point higher at 95 1/8 bid to yield 7.61%.</p>
<p>Foreign Bonds</p>
<p>Holidays in several European countries and Japan curbed
activity in most foreign bond markets yesterday. Several
foreign financial markets also will be closed today in
observance of May Day.</p>
<p>West German government bonds drifted slightly lower.
Bonn's 7 3/4% benchmark securities due in 2000 ended 0.10
point lower at 93.20 to yield 8.81%, while the 8% notes due
in 1995 were off 0.01 point to 95.84 to yield 9.095%.</p>
<p>British government bonds ended slightly higher. Britain's
benchmark 11 3/4% bond due 2003/2007 rose a little more than
1/8 point to 94 1/8 to yield 12.59%.</p>
