	<p class="article-leader">Edward J. Esber Jr. resigned yesterday as chairman and
chief executive officer of Ashton-Tate Corp., and executives
close to the once-dominant software company said it may be
for sale. However, a company official denied it was on the
block.
   Ashton-Tate, which has reported sinking sales and four
quarterly losses in a row, didn't immediately name a clear
successor to 37-year-old Mr. Esber, who held the top spot for
more than five years.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The company named Carmelo J. Santoro, 48, a board member
and chief executive officer of Silicon Systems Inc, a Tustin,
Calif., semiconductor company, to the position of chairman.
It also named William P. Lyons, 45, who was previously vice
president and general manager of AshtonTate's applications
group, to the positions of chief operating officer and
president.</p>
<p>People close to the company said Ashton-Tate retained
PaineWebber Inc. to solicit offers, but it hasn't made any
announcement that it is for sale. At least one serious buyer
surfaced, but backed off this month when it decided that
Ashton-Tate's price tag, reportedly $300 million, was too
high, according to individuals familiar with the talks.</p>
<p>Mr. Esber's departure may have changed any plans to sell
Ashton-Tate. The company has a current market capitalization
of about $300 million. At $300 million, though, Ashton-Tate
might still be a good buy to certain software companies
seeking to extend their product line. "Whoever buys Tate is
buying the database market," said Nancy McSharry, an analyst
at International Data Corp. Currently, Ashton-Tate holds an
estimated 42% of the personal-computer database market, down
sharply from almost 60% three years ago.</p>
<p>Mr. Lyons denied that Ashton-Tate is for sale, although a
spokeswoman for the company confirmed that PaineWebber has
been retained to "investigate proposals brought before it."</p>
<p>A 19-year veteran of International Business Machines Co.,
Mr. Lyons joined the company about two years ago. He said he
was "delighted" to take the helm of Ashton-Tate and promised
to improve the company's performance by introducing new
products in "regular, predictable releases."</p>
<p>That could be a tall order. Competitors have hired some of
Ashton-Tate's best technical people, and customers are tired
of seeing the company fail to meet promised deadlines for the
completion of new products.</p>
<p>"When will Ashton-Tate ship a product that lives up to
expectations? It has yet to be proven they will," said Scott
Smith, an analyst at Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette. "Talk is
cheap here. They have to deliver."</p>
<p>For years, Ashton-Tate dominated the business of selling
database software to users of personal computers, but
recently its position has slipped badly because it failed to
keep pace with technical changes in its field. The company
also faces continuing embarrassment from its inability to
ship a long-delayed new version of its flagship dBASE
product.</p>
<p>In recent months, Mr. Esber had suggested that Ashton-Tate
had almost completed work on a long-delayed revision of its
flagship product called dBASE. But industry sources now say
that the company won't have the revision out by June, as Mr.
Esber had hoped.</p>
<p>"I'd certainly say Ed Esber's resignation doesn't increase
my confidence in the imminent shipment of {a new} dBASE," Mr.
Smith said.</p>
<p>In an interview yesterday, Mr. Lyons said that Mr. Esber's
resignation had nothing to do with finishing work on the new
version of dBASE. He added that he was "very pleased with the
progress we're making" on dBASE and noted that on April 19
the company sent its sixth test version of the new product to
2,000 potential customers. However, he declined to estimate
when the company would ship the product.</p>
<p>Without a new version of dBASE, Ashton-Tate's sales have
slumped. For the first quarter, the company reported a loss
of $1 million on sales of $57 million. A year ago, it earned
$11.5 million on sales of $89.8 million. For all of 1989,
Ashton-Tate posted a net loss of $28.6 million on sales of
$265.3 million.</p>
<p>Various software companies have benefited from
Ashton-Tate's miscues, but analysts said the biggest winner
long-term seems to be Oracle Corp., which built its business
on sales of database software for minicomputers and is now
going after personal computers, too.</p>
<p>Mr. Esber served as Ashton-Tate's chief executive for
almost six years. Early in his tenure, the company grew
rapidly, but an acquisition strategy aimed at easing the
company's dependence on database sales was a failure, and the
departure of key engineers made it difficult for the company
to keep pace with technical advances in its core business.</p>
<p>Last year, sales tumbled when the company discovered
excessive inventory of some products and announced that a new
version of dBASE had fallen far behind schedule.</p>
<p>Mr. Esber will remain on Ashton-Tate's board. In an
interview yesterday, he said he believed his decision to
resign was "in the best interests of the company" and cited
personal reasons for his departure, including the birth of a
child last week.</p>
