	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Bank of New York Co., acting like a
prospective bridegroom with a serious case of wedding-bell
blues, is bickering ever louder with its fiancee of the past
seven years, Northeast Bancorp.
   Yesterday Northeast shares plunged 4 7/8 or 15% to close
at 28 1/4 as Bank of New York accused the Connecticut company
of breaking their merger pact by failing to maintain accurate
records. Unless the problem is corrected within 60 days, Bank
of New York said, it will terminate the deal.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Poppycock, responded Northeast, which said its books are
in order and accused Bank of New York "of a transparent
attempt to avoid its contractual obligations."</p>
<p>Up to now, some investors have been hanging on to
Northeast, believing that Bank of New York Chairman J. Carter
Bacot may simply be jawboning for a better price rather than
trying to kill the merger. But sentiment is growing among
analysts that Mr. Bacot really wants out of this deal.</p>
<p>As Felice Gelman at Dillon Read put it: "It doesn't sound
like they're negotiating to me. Bank of New York has made it
really tough for Northeast to conclude this transaction."</p>
<p>Nobody believes that Mr. Bacot, a black-belt
penny-pincher, is about to pay anything approaching $84 a
share (about $500 million) for Northeast, the parent of Union
Trust Co., Connecticut's third biggest commercial bank. Yet
on paper at least, Bank of New York is obligated to pay 250%
of Northeast's book value, which was $33.53 a share on March
30. The merger accord was stalled until Connecticut recently
changed its banking laws.</p>
<p>Mr. Bacot is a tightfisted guy. He had his Morgan Stanley
advisers pick up the tab for the champagne that flowed after
Bank of New York won a takeover fight for Irving Bank in
1988. He personally reviews all of the bank's charitable
contributions in excess of $50. Yet some investors assumed
the merger accord was ironclad and bid up Northeast shares as
high as 72 last year. The shares later slumped as Northeast
was wracked by losses in the fourth and first quarters,
reflecting heavy additions to reserves for possible loan
losses.</p>
<p>Recent changes in bank regulation have left Bank of New
York a potential escape hatch. Banks can't any longer count
good will -- an intangible asset arising from acquisitions --
as part of equity. Hence, the suitor would have to replace
with new capital any cash it paid in excess of Northeast's
book value. Raising capital by issuing new shares would
seriously dilute the interests of Bank of New York's current
holders. Bank of New York can scuttle the deal if regulators
impose "materially burdensome" conditions on it. The suitor
could argue that a new stock issue was burdensome.</p>
<p>So far there's no sign that Northeast is caving in to Mr.
Bacot's hardball tactics. Northeast yesterday reiterated that
it "will pursue all available legal remedies if Bank of New
York doesn't fulfill its contractual obligations."</p>
<p>Even before yesterday, Bank of New York was arguing that
Northeast's Dec. 31 book value was really only $12.31 a share
based on the outlook for its real estate loans. Northeast
scoffed. Bank of New York has even suggested that Northeast
seek other merger partners, an ironic turn because Northeast
did get a 1986 bid -- believed to be from Fleet/Norstar
Financial Group -- that prompted Bank of New York to boost
its price to 250% of book value from 180%.</p>
<p>Behind all the posturing, some analysts suspect Mr. Bacot
still wants Northeast. But if so, at what price? If not, will
somebody else buy it?</p>
<p>Union Trust has the premier retail banking franchise in
New York's well-heeled Connecticut suburbs, and would
complement Bank of New York's major presence in neighboring
Westchester County. The Irving acquisition hasn't sated Mr.
Bacot's appetite. In a development not previously reported,
Bank of New York early this year had serious discussions
about acquiring New Jersey's First Fidelity Bancorp. Mr.
Bacot was said to be keenly disappointed when First
Fidelity's board broke off talks and hired a new chief
executive officer.</p>
<p>A bank merger specialist without ties to either party
estimates that Mr. Bacot could pay $30 to $40 a share in cash
and securities without hurting his holders severely. On the
other hand, buyers aren't paying 250% of book value for banks
anymore, particularly in New England where real estate losses
are growing. Merger experts say a price of 150% to 180% of
book value is more in line with today's market -- with
payment in securities rather than cash and perhaps a
guarantee against bad loans exceeding a certain level.</p>
<p>If another bidder emerges, analysts expect it to be
foreign. They expect no sudden largesse from Bank of New
York. Says Lacy Shockley at Smith Barney: "I wouldn't want to
fool with Carter Bacot after seeing how incredibly foxy he
was on the Irving bid."</p>
