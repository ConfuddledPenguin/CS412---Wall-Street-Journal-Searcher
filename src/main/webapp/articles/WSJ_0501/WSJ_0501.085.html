	<p class="article-leader">It is a tragedy and a source of embarrassment that the
U.S. ranks 20th in the world in preventing infant mortality.
Singapore and Hong Kong, as well as Japan and most of Western
Europe, all do better. The statistics are particularly bad
for minority children: A black infant born in the District of
Columbia is more likely to die before the age of one than a
baby born in North Korea or Bulgaria. These shameful
statistics persist despite the 93 federal programs and $7
billion a year that the country spends to keep children
alive.
   Most thinking about infant mortality focuses on ways to
provide medical insurance for the one-sixth of all women who
are both uninsured and ineligible for Medicaid or to deliver
health care in their own neighborhoods to women who might be
intimidated by hospitals or clinics.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>But these proposals fail to address the most important
reason for America's high infant mortality: the behavior and
motivation of mothers themselves. The situation in the
District of Columbia exemplifies the problem. Mayor Marion
Barry has bragged that Washington's infant mortality campaign
is "the most comprehensive anywhere in the country," and he
is probably correct. In D.C., prenatal care is free to any
woman whose family income is less than $20,000. Eleven of the
city's 16 health clinics provide prenatal care and are
required to give a woman an appointment within two weeks (two
months is the average in many states). Convenient evening
hours make it even easier for women to reach a clinic, and
child care is also available. At the clinic, a woman can see
an obstetrician, a nurse, a WIC {Special Supplemental Feeding
Program for Women, Infants and Children} worker, a social
worker, even a dentist, and also be referred for drug
treatment.</p>
<p>D.C. has marketed its services well. A highly visible
media campaign, called "Better Babies," has posted ads on
buses and posters, and broadcast them on television and radio
around the city. The MOM van (Maternity Outreach Mobile
project) makes the rounds of the city's poorest neighborhoods
every day, finding pregnant women, reminding them of their
appointments and getting them there if they have no
transportation. Nor are private practitioners in short
supply: Unlike many other areas of the country, D.C. has
plenty of obstetrical care providers, many of whom cater to
the Medicaid clientele and are conveniently located
throughout the city. Altogether, D.C. spends $105 million on
its residents' health.</p>
<p>Despite all of this lavish attention, the District of
Columbia has the nation's worst infant mortality rate, 27 per
1,000 in early 1989, or nearly three times the national rate.
(In 1988, the most recent year for which there are data,
10,514 babies were born in D.C.)</p>
<p>Other cities with equally costly infant mortality programs
are achieving equally dismal results. Infant mortality in
Detroit is almost as bad as in D.C., even though the city
employs, at considerable expense, teams of specially trained
paraprofessional outreach workers to comb neighborhoods, find
pregnant women and bring them into the public health system.
Hartford, Conn., has offered similarly liberal prenatal care
for poor women, yet only a third of its teen-age mothers
sought care in their first trimester.</p>
<p>Why don't women in D.C. and other cities take advantage of
the prenatal care offered to them? Clearly, neither lack of
availability nor insufficient outreach is the answer. "Most
of the women I come into contact with know they can get free
care, but a lot of them don't really take prenatal care all
that seriously. Some of them say they didn't even know they
were pregnant until pretty late in the pregnancy," reports
one D.C. public health official.</p>
<p>Another explanation for high infant mortality rates lies
in the staggeringly high number of babies born to
substance-abusing women. Ethel Hawkins, director of social
services at D.C. General Hospital, estimates that "well over
60% of the babies born here are born to women who used drugs
or alcohol while they were pregnant." Another health care
worker placed the toll closer to 70%.</p>
<p>Even when these women are identified and counseled early
in the pregnancy, convincing them to stop destroying their
children often proves impossible, as the Infant Mortality
Research Program of the Department of Agriculture -- which
identifies pregnant women in D.C. by going door to door in
half the city's wards and distributing information in grocery
stores and laundromats -- has found. According to the
program's director, Lilly Munroe-Lord, "It's very difficult
to get through to the women who are using crack while
pregnant. They simply don't hear you. The ones who are casual
users can be convinced to stop during the remainder of the
pregnancy, but they usually go right back to it after the
baby is born."</p>
<p>Dr. George Graham, professor of human nutrition at Johns
Hopkins University, confirms these observations from the
field: "I don't know how spending more on prenatal care is
going to make any difference to the woman who uses crack. A
recent study found that nearly 30% of the babies born in New
York hospitals were addicted to crack. Use of drugs, not poor
nutrition, is the leading cause of low birthweight. You hear
a lot about how nutritional deficiencies, lack of funds of
WIC, etc., are responsible for low birthweight, but that's
simply false. Low birthweight in the U.S. is not caused by
poor feeding programs -- it's usually caused by the behavior
of the mother."</p>
<p>Teen pregnancy and illegitimacy are also important causes
of low birthweight and infant mortality. American Enterprise
Institute researcher Nicholas Eberstadt recently wrote in a
nationally syndicated column on Nov. 3, "If viewed as a
medical condition, illegitimacy would be one of the leading
killers of children in America." Mr. Eberstadt's work
suggests that a child born to poor, married parents has a
better chance of survival than a child born to a middle-class
single mother: Infant mortality rates, according to one 1982
study, can be higher for children of unmarried white college
graduates than for children of married white high-school
dropouts.</p>
<p>Not so coincidentally, D.C., which trails the nation in
infant mortality, also has the nation's highest percentage of
births to unmarried mothers. Fifty-eight percent of all
babies in the city are born to unmarried women-nearly three
times the national average.</p>
<p>Responsible maternal behavior may even compensate for
comparatively poorer prenatal care. A Japanese woman is four
times more likely to die during childbirth than an American
woman, because complex medical treatment is more likely to be
available here. Yet Japan has the world's lowest rate of
infant mortality -- about half that of the U.S. In Japan,
fewer than 1% of all mothers are either unmarried or
teenagers.</p>
<p>America's high rate of infant mortality is more of a
social than a medical problem. Spending more won't fix it.</p>
