	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- Mitsubishi Motors of America, the marketing
unit of Mitsubishi Motors Corp., will recall 102,000 of its
1986 passenger cars that exceed the federal emission standard
for carbon monoxide, the Environmental Protection Agency
said.
   The cars, equipped with 1.5-liter engines, are the
Mitsubishi Mirage, the Dodge Colt and Plymouth Colt. All were
built by Mitsubishi, but most were sold by Chrysler Corp.
Chrysler will fix the Dodge and Plymouth cars, the EPA said.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The repair, which will be free to car owners, consists of
modifying the carburetor, recalibrating the automatic choke
and, if needed, replacing the secondary air filter.</p>
<p>Carbon monoxide, which results from incomplete combustion
of fuel, disrupts the delivery of oxygen to the body's organs
and tissues and impairs heart function. It can be especially
harmful to people wih lung disease, anemia and peripheral
vascular disease.</p>
<p>Car owners will be notified of the recall by mail.</p>
