	<p class="article-leader">Ames Department Stores Inc., which last week filed for
bankruptcy-court protection, hired retailing consultant
Stephen L. Pistner to rescue the discount chain from the
financial misfortunes of its Zayre stores.
   Mr. Pistner, 58 years old, was named chief executive
officer and to the "office of chairman," a newly created post
he will share with James Harmon, who continues as chairman.
As chief executive, Mr. Pistner succeeds Peter B. Hollis, 46,
who resigned. Mr. Pistner's appointment is subject to
approval by the U.S. bankruptcy court.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Styled a turnaround artist, Mr. Pistner helped reverse
problems at variety-store operator McCrory Corp.,
department-store chain Montgomery Ward & Co. and at Dayton
Hudson Corp.'s Target discount chain since the late 1970s.
"He has the reputation of a contract executive," said Chriss
Street, bankruptcy specialist at Seidler Amdec in Los
Angeles. "He comes in, turns the company around and leaves."</p>
<p>But the hard-driving executive, once known for flying
planes under Mississippi River bridges, will need to pull
some stunts to pull Ames out of a tailspin.</p>
<p>Thursday, Ames filed for protection from its creditors
under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, after
disclosing that it expects to report a $228 million loss for
the year ended Jan. 27, largely because of problems at former
Zayre operations Ames acquired in 1988. The filing, along
with $250 million in new financing, allows Ames to buy badly
needed merchandise from its suppliers and continue to operate
while trying to work out a plan to repay its debts.</p>
<p>Mr. Pistner will attempt what Mr. Hollis, who himself was
described as a merchandising artist, was unable to accomplish
-- restoring profitability to the 680-store chain with annual
revenue of more than $4 billion.</p>
<p>"It's going to take some work," admitted Mr. Pistner, who
said he began looking at Ames's problems eight days ago. He
said he has given the task "some thought," but added it would
be premature to announce any strategic plan. "Basically, it's
a question of how to reposition the company. But that's my
skill," he said. "I specialize in turnarounds."</p>
<p>Ames's problems stem in part from poor marketing decisions
at the old Zayre stores. It tried to change the Zayre
philosophy of attracting discount hunters by advertising
bargains -- and even selling some merchandise at a loss -- in
hopes of getting shoppers into the stores to buy other goods
as well. Ames instead switched to an "every-day low price"
strategy. But many of Zayre's old customers who had been
programmed to buy heavily discounted items went elsewhere.
While sales at the old Ames stores continued to grow in the
5% range, this was more than offset by the double-digit
declines at its Zayre units.</p>
<p>Analysts note that Mr. Pistner must choose to continue on
the path already set by Mr. Hollis or revert to Zayre's
one-time successful formula of promotions. "It's like
navigating a boat in mid-stream," said Mr. Street.</p>
<p>Ames's new chief also faces another challenge -- all his
moves must be scrutinized by the bankruptcy court and lawyers
representing various interests, and funds to make changes
will be limited. "This already monumental assignment has to
be done with one hand tied behind his back," said Wayne Hood,
retail analyst for Prudential Bache.</p>
