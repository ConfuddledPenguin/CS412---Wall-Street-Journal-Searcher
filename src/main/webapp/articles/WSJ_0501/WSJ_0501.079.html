	<p class="article-leader">MUNICH, West Germany -- Allianz AG said that it has agreed
to merge its French insurance businesses with those of Cie de
Navigation Mixte to form a new joint-venture company that
will be one of France's largest private insurers, of which
the West German company will own 65%.
   Allianz, which also is Europe's largest insurance group,
said the planned merger of the respective French businesses
in effect expands an agreement last November, when Allianz
acquired 50% of Navigation Mixte's French insurance
operations.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"From the very beginning, the intention was to merge the
(company's French insurance operations) one way or another
under one holding company," an Allianz spokeswoman said. She
noted that an unsuccessful hostile takeover attempt of
Navigation by Cie. Financiere de Paribas last year had forced
her company and its French partner to delay talks on the
merger of the insurance lines in France until now.</p>
<p>Under West German accounting rules, the new joint
venture's sales and earnings will be consoldiated into the
annual accounts of Allianz.</p>
<p>Under the joint venture agreement, Navigation Mixte will
hold 34% of the new French company, which will have around 10
billion French francs ($1.78 billion) worth of premium income
annually. Allianz said third parties, which it didn't
identify, would hold the remaining 1% stake in the new joint
venture.</p>
