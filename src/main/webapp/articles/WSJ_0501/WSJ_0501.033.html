	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- At the White House early in January,
Canadian billionaire Albert Reichmann and New York investor
Zev Wolfson asked President Bush to intervene in behalf of a
privately funded Jewish education project in the Soviet
Union.
   No notice appeared on the president's daily schedule of
the meeting, at which the businessmen's request didn't go
unanswered. The following month in Moscow, Secretary of State
James Baker raised the matter in talks with Soviet Foreign
Minister Eduard Shevardnadze, putting a U.S. imprimatur on
the cause of the two businessmen.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Who was helping behind-the-scenes to arrange this coup? It
was Senate Republican leader Robert Dole, who within days
would plunge into a fight with a suggestion to cut U.S. aid
to Israel. The sequence of events demonstrates the many
levers Sen. Dole pulls to maintain his own leverage in
Washington. Even as he brought the businessmen to the Oval
Office, he presented himself as a populist champion against a
"selfish" pro-Israel lobby.</p>
<p>Mr. Dole's performance discloses his complex relationship
with pro-Israel forces, a major source of campaign
contributions. In the period he was helping the businessmen,
relatives of Mr. Reichmann, one of three brothers who run
Olympia & York Developments Ltd., and Mr. Wolfson gave
$10,000 to Mr. Dole's political-action committee, Campaign
America. Federal Election Commission records list $130,000
more in contributions from the New York business community
deposited on the same day in December. Mr. Wolfson denies
doing any fund-raising, but the senator acknowledges that he
and Mr. Wolfson have discussed fund-raising for his PAC.</p>
<p>"He kept saying `What can I do for you?'" says Mr. Dole,
recalling his conversations with Mr. Wolfson. "I said, `I
don't want anything but I've got a PAC, and maybe you can
raise some money.'"</p>
<p>Mr. Dole often reacts impulsively, but his voice is
important because he is the most visible and often-quoted
Republican in Congress and because of his skill at sensing
political change. Since his failed presidential campaign in
1988, Mr. Dole has been increasingly outspoken in challenging
the pro-Israel lobby, and his stance mirrors the growing
strain between the administration and Israel.</p>
<p>Within his own party, Mr. Dole has patched over
differences with House GOP Whip Newt Gingrich, who visited
Mr. Dole last week to make peace after criticizing the
senator for his comments on Israel. "As a United States
senator, he has the right to question, and I see nothing
wrong with that," says Sydney Sussman, a New Jersey developer
and Dole backer.</p>
<p>But how the questions are phrased troubles some. The
Senate GOP leader's record in almost three decades in
Congress can scarcely be described as anti-Israel, but his
sharp style can conflict with the nuances of foreign policy.</p>
<p>During his recent visit to the Mideast, press reports
quoted Mr. Dole as likening Israel to a "spoiled child." He
has portrayed the leadership of the American Israel Public
Affairs Committee as shortsighted. With at least the tacit
approval of Secretary Baker, he proposed to trim U.S.
assistance to Israel 5% -- a 5% solution to the foreign aid
crisis that he says the Israeli government could have held
out as a "great PR move." And after indicating support, he
turned cool to legislation promising $400 million in loan
guarantees to help Israel house newly arrived Soviet Jews.</p>
<p>Sen. Dole also was the victim of a sometimes-hostile
Israeli press during his Mideast visit. And he still suspects
that pro-Israel forces, who have a regional sympathy with the
Turks, helped block his resolution to commemorate the Ottoman
massacre of Armenians early in this century.</p>
<p>The failure of the resolution still pains the senator, who
feels emotional debt to an Armenian-American doctor who
treated his wounds from World War II. This may help explain
the stand he sometimes takes against the pro-Israel lobby.
"Bob is the kind of pol who says, "You beat on me, I'll beat
on you,'" says a House Democrat.</p>
<p>The testy relations were evident last fall in Israeli
Ambassador Moshe Arad's answer to a Dole letter regarding the
embassy's role on the resolution. "Thank you for your letter
dated November 2, which was received by this Embassy on
November 7, a couple of days after it had already appeared in
the Congressional Record," the ambassador wrote.</p>
<p>Even if Israel wasn't lobbying on the issue, some
pro-Israel forces in the U.S. were aligned with Turkey
against the resolution. Morris Amitay, a former AIPAC
director and a columnist for Jewish newspapers, worked as a
paid Turkish lobbyist on the issue. The Washington law firm
of Arnold & Porter is a registered foreign agent for the
Israeli Finance Ministry as well as for Profilo Holding A.S.
of Turkey. Paul Berger, a member of AIPAC who is a senior
partner of the law firm, has represented both clients and
escorted a Profilo executive who is a prominent member of the
Istanbul Jewish community, in lobbying against the
resolution.</p>
<p>Mr. Dole's alliance with Mr. Wolfson puts him alongside a
man who has sometimes brought trouble on his friends. The
experience of Sen. Daniel Inouye, the Hawaii Democrat, may be
instructive. In his quest to move up the ladder of Senate
leadership, he was wounded by publicity three years ago over
his sponsorship of a plan to funnel $8 million in U.S. aid to
build schools for North African Sephardic Jews in France -- a
proposal heavily backed by Mr. Wolfson and Mr. Reichmann's
brother Paul.</p>
<p>Mr. Reichmann, for his part, is an intensely private man
who appears to have relied on Mr. Wolfson's political
contacts to open doors, but who went on to mount an
extraordinary show of power tapping the highest levels of the
government.</p>
<p>Mr. Reichmann hosted a small dinner with Mr. Wolfson for
Mr. Dole in late November, and the senator subsequently
introduced him to Mr. Baker and gave him access to a
follow-up meeting with a senior Baker aide after the White
House discussions. Though the money for the schools and
cultural centers is private, the high-level diplomacy
encouraged the Soviets to tolerate an expansion of the
program, with each step designed to show U.S. backing at a
time of changing relations with Moscow.</p>
<p>At Mr. Wolfson's request, House Minority Leader Robert
Michel (R., Ill.) sponsored an unusual Capitol luncheon last
May so Mr. Reichmann could present his case to Soviet
Ambassador Yuriy Dubinin -- with the four top leaders of
Congress alongside him in the same room. "They'd like to . .
. unlock the key to Gorbachev," Rep. Michel explains. "That
would make it all the more profound, to make the point."</p>
