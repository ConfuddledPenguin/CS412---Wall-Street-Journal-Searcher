	<p class="article-leader">AMERICAN INDEMNITY FINANCIAL Corp. said directors voted to
slash its quarterly dividend 86% to two cents a share from 14
cents, to allow the Galveston, Texas, property and casualty
insurance concern to reinvest a greater part of its earnings.
The dividend is payable May 15 to stock of record May 11. The
quarterly payout was cut from 28 cents in July 1987. A
spokesman said the latest cut reflects disappointing results
for 1989 and the first quarter. American Indemnity posted a
first-quarter net loss of $1.3 million, or 65 cents a share,
compared with year-earlier profit of $1.1 million, or 57
cents a share. It cited unusually large fire and auto-related
claims in January and February, and said its premiums written
fell about 19% to about $17 million in the quarter, as part
of an effort to tighten underwriting standards and improve
its premium-to-surplus ratio.</p>
