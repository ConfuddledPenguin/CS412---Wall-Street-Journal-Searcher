	<p class="article-leader">MOUNT AIRY, N.C. -- Insteel Industries Inc. said Stelwire,
a Hamilton, Ontario-based unit of Stelco Inc., will become
the Canadian distributor for a new construction panel
produced by Insteel.
   The new system uses a welded wire frame integrated with an
expanded polystyrene insulating core. Concrete is poured on
each side of the unit after it is in place, producing a
steel-reinforced concrete sandwich wall.</p>
