	<p class="article-leader">Japonica Partners said it has lined up $425 million of
bank financing for its plan to reorganize Allegheny
International Inc., which is operating under Chapter 11 of
bankruptcy-law procedures.
   An attorney for Japonica, a New York investor group trying
to take over Pittsburgh-based Allegheny, said it has obtained
loan commitments of $175 million from Chase Manhattan Bank,
$175 million from Security Pacific and $75 million from
Midland Montague, an affiliate of Midland Bank PLC., a
British bank.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Japonica said previously the partnership would supply more
than $120 million of equity capital.</p>
<p>Allegheny, which produces Sunbeam and Oster appliances and
other consumer products, filed for bankruptcy court
protection in February 1988. Allegheny management has its own
plan for reorganizing the company, which involves paying
creditors mainly with stock.</p>
<p>With the bank commitments, cash that Allegheny has on hand
and the Japonica equity, Japonica said, it has the funds
needed to gain control of Allegheny and provide it with
working capital.</p>
