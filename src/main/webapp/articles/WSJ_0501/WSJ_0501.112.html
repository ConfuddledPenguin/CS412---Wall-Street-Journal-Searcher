	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- U.S. Trade Representative Carla Hills said
Japan still has barriers to U.S. construction companies, but
she declined to designate it as a country that denies "fair
and equal market opportunity" to U.S. companies seeking
public-works contracts.
   Mrs. Hills was required to decide by yesterday whether to
invoke provisions of U.S. law that might be used later to bar
Japanese companies from bidding for contracts to help build
or supply equipment for U.S. airports.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>She noted that Japan has taken some "helpful" steps to
open up its market, and that some new contracts for
public-works projects in that country have been awarded to
U.S. construction companies. She added that the U.S. early
next month will initiate a new round of talks with Japan on
"the whole range of problems related to access to the
Japanese market for construction services."</p>
<p>The U.S., she concluded, will continue to "monitor"
Japan's market-opening measures. If the next round of
bilateral negotiations prove to be "unsatisfactory," she
said, the Bush administration would consider "appropriate
action."</p>
