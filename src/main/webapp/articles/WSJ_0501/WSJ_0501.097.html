	<p class="article-leader">HO CHI MINH CITY, Vietnam -- After communist forces
toppled the U.S.-backed South Vietnamese government in 1975,
ethnic-Chinese businessman Chau Hon persisted in running his
private bakery as Hanoi sought to impose strict socialism on
the reunited country. Arrested during a nationalization drive
in 1978, he was sent to toil in the countryside for two
years. Digging canals, the authorities figured, he would
learn the value of labor and forget his bourgeois ways.
   While Mr. Hon and his family endured what he calls "a dark
time," most of his friends -- traders, shopkeepers,
manufacturers -- joined the flood of refugees from Vietnam.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Back in Saigon, renamed Ho Chi Minh City, Mr. Hon was
recruited in 1981 by daring Communist cadres who were
convinced that free enterprise was the only way to save the
impoverished nation. They supplied the flour, and he made the
bread to feed a hungry population -- at a profit. Over the
next few years, he narrowly escaped prison again, along with
his Communist Party backers, as the party went through a
fierce internal struggle to decide which economic system
would prevail.</p>
<p>Today, the outcome is beyond dispute. Mr. Hon, age 54,
owns six small factories that produce food products. He is
importing a $500,000 wafer-making machine from Austria and
has bought a $200,000 home for his wife and 10 children. He
also has opened a small department store and is seeking
approval to set up the country's first supermarket.</p>
<p>With many of his old business friends returning from
abroad to invest in Vietnam, Mr. Hon believes Deputy Prime
Minister Nguyen Co Thach's repeated statement that the
government's commitment to an open economic policy is
irreversible. "If they return to the old way," Mr. Hon says,
"we'll lose one but they'll lose 10."</p>
<p>Mr. Hon's experience parallels the country's fortunes
since the Communist takeover 15 years ago yesterday. With
their military victory, the Communists were able to realize
their dream of uniting Vietnam under a socialist banner. But
socialism didn't work.</p>
<p>It is openly admitted now that the main result was to make
the South almost as poor as the North. To rescue the economy,
Hanoi had to embrace the U.S.-promoted capitalist system it
once fought with religious fervor. And in search of
management skills, the government has had to turn to
technocrats of the defeated South Vietnamese regime and to
entrepreneurs like Mr. Hon who flourished under it.</p>
<p>Vietnam has a long way to go to overcome the double legacy
of war and socialism that has left it one of the world's
poorest nations. It also must contend with the international
economic embargo led by the U.S., which still doesn't
recognize Hanoi. The embargo severely limits Vietnam's
ability to attract much-needed private foreign investment and
loans from governments, multilateral lending institutions and
commercial banks.</p>
<p>According to local and foreign economists, Vietnam's
reforms have made it more market-oriented than any other
communist country. "Eastern Europe is trying to do what we've
already done," boasts Nguyen Xuan Oanh, a U.S.-trained former
deputy premier and central-bank governor of South Vietnam who
has been recalled to serve as an economic adviser.</p>
<p>If Vietnam's conversion to capitalism has escaped wide
attention, it is partly because it remains a one-party state
and Hanoi doesn't acknowledge its reforms as capitalism. It
prefers to call what is happening "doi moi," which translates
as "renovation."</p>
<p>Socialism remains the official ideology and long-term
objective. But what passes for socialism today bears no
resemblance to the Soviet model -- characterized by rigid
central planning, rapid industrialization, collectivized
agriculture and suppression of private enterprise --
introduced in North Vietnam and imposed on the whole country
in 1975.</p>
<p>The result was catastrophic. As northerners and
southerners alike resisted, the economy skidded and hundreds
of thousands of desperate people took to the seas in refugee
boats. To avert collapse, the government experimented with
market forces. For instance, it allowed farmers to sell in
the free market produce in excess of a state-fixed quota. But
the economy continued to stagnate.</p>
<p>The turning point came at the Communist Party's sixth
congress in late 1986, when pragmatic new leaders admitted
that the party had been on the wrong track, and pledged real
reform. The new policies aimed to reorient investment toward
agriculture, light industry and exports, rely more on the
marketplace and encourage private initiative.</p>
<p>To attract foreign companies, Vietnam adopted one of the
communist world's most liberal investment codes. In the past
three years, 140 projects representing a commitment of more
than $1 billion have been approved. Most are small, and most
are in the South. The bulk consists of just six contracts for
offshore oil and natural gas exploration.</p>
<p>The government has also granted autonomy to state
enterprises and lifted most restrictions on private business.
Goods and services are traded mostly at negotiated prices.
The central-planning apparatus has all but disappeared.</p>
<p>To stay afloat, state enterprises are issuing bonds,
taking on private partners and shedding staff. Some are
merging, recruiting skilled managers, or trying other ways to
upgrade their quality, marketing and efficiency. A few, such
as Hanoi-based Vietnam Airlines, the country's sole domestic
and international carrier for 15 years, face a double
challenge: It is expected to show a profit even as a
competitive airline springs up in the South to threaten its
monopoly and state subsidies run out.</p>
<p>When the bureaucrats of one district in Ho Chi Minh City
decided to open a garment factory to ease unemployment, they
recruited Nguyen Thi Son, whose family had been in the
garment business before 1975. Mrs. Son, 40, demanded -- and
got -- approval to be boss in practice as well as title. "I
hire and fire, fix salaries and make other decisions" without
interference, she says.</p>
<p>Three years later, her Legamex State Co. has 3,500 workers
in six units producing clothing, shoes and other leather
goods for local and overseas markets at a healthy profit.
Mrs. Son frequently visits customers abroad. One of her
management techniques: 40% of profit is distributed to staff
as a bonus.</p>
<p>The liberated private sector, meanwhile, has spread
rapidly. The pace is almost frenzied in Ho Chi Minh City. The
city's 5.5 million people clog the streets with cars,
motorbikes and bicycles. Every home appears to have a
pavement work shop where family members make household items
to be sold or bartered.</p>
<p>Stores are packed with Honda motorbikes, stereo equipment
and video movies from the West. Thousands of restaurants,
coffee shops, nightclubs, discos, billiard rooms and massage
parlors advertise with colored signs, flashing lights and
blaring pop music. Horse racing has resumed; a casino has
opened in nearby Vung Tau.</p>
<p>In Hanoi, with less than half Ho Chi Minh City's
population and an infrastructure little changed since the
French colonialists were forced to leave in 1954, the
transformation is more orderly but no less striking. The
front room of almost every ground-floor dwelling has been
converted into a tiny coffee shop or store, bringing life to
the threadbare capital.</p>
<p>One of the most eager investors is Nguyen Van Chan, 65,
who was jailed three times between 1960 and 1974 for selling
fountain pens, glue and bicycle tires he invented and made
from scrap. He recently recovered his confiscated property
and equipment and has opened a branch in Ho Chi Minh City.
"This regime has really changed," he says. "It's OK to be a
capitalist now."</p>
<p>In the countryside, where 80% of the 66 million population
lives, farmers have responded to incentives that have halted
and rolled back collectivization. Record grain production
last year enabled Vietnam to export 1.5 million metric tons
of rice. It was a dramatic turnaround from the near famine
conditions of 1988, when Hanoi appealed to the world for food
aid.</p>
