	<p class="article-leader">Reliance Group Holdings Inc. said it completed the
previously announced sale of its General Casualty Co.
subsidiary to Winterthur Swiss Insurance Co. for $630
million.
   As a result of selling the Sun Prairie, Wis., insurance
company, Reliance said it will post a pretax gain of about
$380 million in the current quarter.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>New York-based Reliance sold General Casualty at nearly
three times its book value. Standard & Poor's Corp., the
rating service, has said that the sale to the Swiss company
"will strengthen the statutory surplus of Reliance's
insurance operating subsidiaries" and improve its
consolidated financial leverage.</p>
<p>In the 1989 second quarter, Reliance posted a $6 million
net loss, including an after-tax charge of $8.6 million to
settle lawsuits.</p>
<p>Reliance shares closed yesterday in New York Stock
Exchange composite trading at $5.625, up 25 cents.</p>
