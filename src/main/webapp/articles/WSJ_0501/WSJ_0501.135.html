	<p class="article-leader">Tosco Corp. said it abandoned efforts begun late last year
to sell the company or its refining business.
   But the Santa Monica, Calif., oil refiner said discussions
would continue on the possible sale of its Seminole
Fertilizer Corp. unit, which it purchased last June for about
$135 million including expenses.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Tosco's chief executive officer, Thomas D. O'Malley, said
in a statement that offers received for the company didn't
"reflect the strategic position and earning power of the Avon
refinery. Therefore, we will continue to operate and improve
our refining assets and explore alternative methods to
maximize values for our shareholders."</p>
<p>Tosco also said it will resume its stock buy-back program,
which had been suspended after Tosco had acquired about $20
million of a possible $50 million of its own shares.</p>
<p>Tosco also reported a first-quarter loss of $6.9 million,
or 66 cents a share, compared with a loss of $8 million, or
$1.48 a share, a year earlier. Revenue rose to $477.2 million
from $274.7 million. The 1990 results include a $9.4 million
loss for the Seminole Fertilizer unit.</p>
