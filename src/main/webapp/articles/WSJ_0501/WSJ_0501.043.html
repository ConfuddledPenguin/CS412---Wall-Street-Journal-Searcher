	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Eugene R. McGrath was named chief executive
officer of Consolidated Edison Co., effective Sept. 1,
succeeding Arthur Hauspurg.
   Mr. Hauspurg, who will reach the big utility company's
mandatory retirement age of 65 in August, said he will
recommend to the board at its May 22 meeting that Mr. McGrath
also succeed him as chairman.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Mr. McGrath, 48, was named president and chief operating
officer of Con Ed last year, signaling to analysts that he
was in line to take over when Mr. Hauspurg retired.
Previously, Mr. McGrath, a 27-year Con Ed veteran, was
executive vice president, operations.</p>
<p>For the first quarter, Con Ed had net income of $128.8
million, or 56 cents a share, down 10% from $143.2 million,
or 63 cents a share. For 1989, net totaled $606.1 million, or
$2.49 a share, on revenue of $5.55 billion.</p>
<p>Analysts said the executive change comes at a critical
time for Con Ed. Mr. McGrath's "biggest challenge is to
forecast the future of New York City's economy given the
current uncertainties," said Gregory Enholm, an analyst at
Salomon Brothers Inc. "Will the 1990s be a repeat of the
1970s, which caused significant financial distress at Con Ed,
including a dividend omission? Or will the 1990s be a
continuation of the 1980s, when New York City's recovery
significantly improved Con Ed's financial health?"</p>
<p>Mr. Enholm said Con Ed may have to step up programs for
controlling demand or build new power plants if economic
growth continues. However, if the New York economy falters,
Con Ed will need to take action to buoy profits. "He needs to
make some big decisions that will affect Con Ed for the
1990s," said Mr. Enholm.</p>
<p>In his recent positions at Con Ed, Mr. McGrath has been a
strong advocate of incentives for major commercial customers
to use less energy in peak periods. Such demand-management
programs reduce the need for building expensive new power
plants.</p>
