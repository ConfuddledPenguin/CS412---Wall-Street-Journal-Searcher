	<p class="article-leader">President Bush was right to stop pressing NATO plans for a
new American short-range nuclear missile in Europe. Such a
missile is militarily unnecessary and politically infeasible.
But how the president and his NATO colleagues decide the more
fundamental issue of the future of nuclear weapons in Europe
is another matter.
   American nuclear weapons in Europe, and specifically in
West Germany, are crucial to the safety and stability of
Europe. Without them, Germany would face the nuclear-armed
Soviet Union with only non-nuclear forces. The result would
be a dangerous imbalance in the center of Europe. And,
whatever Germany may say or think today, this imbalance would
in time lead Germany to seek nuclear weapons of its own.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The French and British understand the implications of this
and have strongly supported a continuing American nuclear
presence on German soil. The Germans, given as they are to
romanticism, pacifism and self-absorption, aren't sure
whether they will allow American nuclear weapons to remain in
Germany much longer. Those Germans who don't want the
missiles seem to believe one of two things: Either that no
Soviet military threat exists any longer, or that even, if
they send us and our weapons packing, the U.S. will continue
to protect Germany with its American-based strategic weapons.</p>
<p>The signs from Germany are disquieting. A typical
statement is the one made by Count Otto Lambsdorff, the
leader of the Free Democrats, Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich
Genscher's party. Count Lambsdorff has said that Germany may
have to honor East German "obligations" even after
reunification. What this could mean is reimbursing Moscow for
the cost of keeping Soviet troops in Germany. With the
leading figure of a centrist party saying that, anything is
possible]</p>
<p>When President Bush recently leaked the decision to
reverse his earlier insistence on a missile to replace the
aging Lance missile now deployed in Europe, he let it be
known that a new arms-control policy was being readied to
make the most of his unilateral change. After all, he
reasoned, if the U.S. has got to give up short-range missiles
in Europe because the Germans won't accept them, let's see if
the Soviets can be made to give up theirs.</p>
<p>A treaty banning all short-range missiles would be a good
thing. But only if it covers all of them. A treaty that
allowed the Soviets to keep some limited number would be
hopelessly unverifiable. If they chose to cheat, there isn't
a prayer that we could know how many the Soviets had.</p>
<p>With a total ban on short-range missiles, however, we
could have substantially more confidence in Soviet
compliance. This is because the testing of short-range
missiles and the training of troops to fire them would also
be banned. Testing and training are much easier to verify
than the actual number of weapons. Weapons are easily hidden
while test and training activities are not.</p>
<p>Properly negotiated, the elimination of the entire class
of short-range missiles world-wide could have the added
advantage of taking them from the likes of Syria and Iraq,
both of whom possess Soviet missiles and the potential to use
them with chemical weapons. A treaty banning the missiles
should require the Soviets to retrieve any sent abroad.</p>
<p>Without any short-range nuclear missiles in Europe, the
U.S. would still have a sizable number of nuclear weapons in
Germany and elsewhere in Europe. These include bombs
deliverable by European-based aircraft and artillery shells,
some of which have been recently modernized. Moreover, the
U.S. is developing improved weapons for tactical aircraft,
the so-called "tactical air-to-surface missile."</p>
<p>There is a justifiable fear among British, French and some
American policy makers that a treaty eliminating short-range
missiles would intensify German pressure to remove the
remaining nuclear weapons from German territory, especially
the nuclear artillery. Presumably this is why President Bush
supported a successor to the Lance when he first took office
and why the administration has in the past argued -- wrongly
in my view -- for an unverifiable limit on short-range
missiles rather than a complete ban.</p>
<p>There is no doubt that the denuclearization of Western
Europe, a dream of Soviet foreign policy since Stalin's day,
would give the Soviets the military predominance they
consistently sought, but failed to achieve, during the long
twilight of the Cold War. It would be ironic indeed if
Western victory in the Cold War were to bring Moscow its most
elusive Cold War goal.</p>
<p>Yet the unnamed sources who leaked the president's
decision gave an argument which, more than any other, drives
the Germans toward denuclearization: That short-range weapons
can strike targets only on German territory. This idea,
expressed in the pernicious slogan "the shorter the range,
the deader the Germans," misses the central point: Nuclear
weapons with small, controllable yields would be used only
against invading forces (i.e. the Red Army) in the
battlefield. Properly developed, deployed and controlled,
tactical nuclear weapons would be used only against military
targets and, even then, only in the most extreme
circumstances. The probability of an invasion that would
warrant their use has always been slight. With the Cold War
now receding into history, it is smaller than ever. Thus the
principal purpose of American nuclear weapons in Germany
would be to deter the use of nuclear weapons against German
territory.</p>
<p>Which should we suppose to be the greater threat? That a
monopoly of theater nuclear weapons might one day tempt a
Soviet leader or that maintaining a small number of American
nuclear weapons in Germany might somehow lead to their
unacceptable use on German territory?</p>
<p>President Bush should go no further down the path of
changing American nuclear policy in Europe without an
understanding with the German government that would provide
for a continuing American nuclear presence there. This
probably means waiting until after the German elections in
December. A negotiation on these issues now would become
caught up in the emotional Sturm und Drang of German
electoral politics.</p>
<p>Even after the German elections, securing German approval
for a continuing nuclear presence on German soil will not be
easy. But the Germans can hardly expect the U.S. (or France
or Britain) to assume the risks entailed in a nuclear
guarantee for Germany if they opt for the illusory security
of a nuclear-free zone.</p>
<p>A continuing American nuclear guarantee for NATO would
mean a continuing American troop presence. The number of
troops could be substantially fewer than the 305,000 there
now. Almost any of the numbers now being discussed, from a
high of 225,000, to figures on the order of 100,000, should
be considered. Whatever number of troops remain though, the
U.S. should insist that they not face Soviet nuclear weapons
without nuclear weapons of a similar nature close at hand.
The issues of troops and weapons are inextricably bound up
together. Both are in turn woven deep in the fabric of NATO
strategy.</p>
<p>That strategy can and should adapt to the collapse of the
Soviet empire in Eastern Europe, and the disintegration of
the Warsaw Pact. Reciprocal force reductions are part of the
response. So is a reorientation of NATO's nuclear doctrine
away from a readiness to use nuclear weapons early in a war
to compensate for conventional weakness. But without a
continuing nuclear presence, there is no NATO strategy at
all.</p>
<p>The U.S. should take advantage of the movement toward
NATO-Soviet parity in Europe by redeploying tactical nuclear
weapons there. We should make the weapons more survivable by
pulling them away from the front lines to more secure and
flexible storage in the rear. This should go a long way
toward resolving the dilemma of the early use of weapons
deployed in spots where they would be overrun before their
use could be ordered.</p>
<p>The future of NATO's nuclear force and strategy is the
most sensitive issue to arise from the profound changes now
sweeping Europe. The U.S. had better take its time and get it
right. The Cold War was too important to be left to the
generals. The way the world organizes for peace is too
important to be left to the diplomats. And neither Cold War
nor present peace should be left to the Germans.</p>
