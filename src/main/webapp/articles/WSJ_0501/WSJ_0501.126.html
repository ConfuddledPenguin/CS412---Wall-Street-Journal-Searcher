	<p class="article-leader">Continental Airlines, a unit of Texas Air Corp., reported
first-quarter net income of $21.3 million, largely because of
a one-time gain from a lawsuit settlement. The carrier had a
net loss in the year-ago quarter of $16.5 million.
   Continental, based in Houston, was pushed into the black
by special items totaling $69.7 million, mostly from a hefty
settlement with UAL Inc.'s United Airlines on a computer
reservations system lawsuit. In the year-ago quarter
Continental had $30.6 million in special items, mostly from
sale-leaseback of aircraft.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Quarterly revenue was $1.27 billion, compared with last
year's $1.24 billion. Operating profit was $8.8 million,
compared with $19.8 million in 1989, although the loss before
income tax and special items was mostly unchanged. In 1990,
Continental's loss before special items was $48.4 million;
last year it was $47 million.</p>
<p>A spokesman for Texas Air said the parent would report its
earnings shortly.</p>
