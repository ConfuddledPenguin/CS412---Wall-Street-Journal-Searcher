	<p class="article-leader">Forest Oil Corp. said it will write down $84 million in
oil and gas reserves, reducing first-quarter earnings by $55
million and resulting in a loss for the quarter.
   Forest Oil said the write-down is primarily attributable
to a significant decrease in the spot market price of natural
gas between January and March. The Denver-based company said
it sells 80% to 90% of its natural gas on the spot market.
The company also attributed the write-down to a revision in
reserves and production-rate estimates on Gulf of Mexico
properties.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>In the first quarter last year, Forest Oil had net income
of $1.8 million, or 5 cents a share, on revenue of $63.9
million. Those earnings included a $12 million write-down of
oil and gas properties.</p>
