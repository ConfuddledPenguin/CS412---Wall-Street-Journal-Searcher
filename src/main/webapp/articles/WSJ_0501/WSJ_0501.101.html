	<p class="article-leader">The Tennessee Department of Commerce and Insurance ordered
Torchmark Corp. to halt its proxy battle with American
General Corp.
   The order requires Torchmark, a Birmingham, Ala., insurer,
to stop soliciting proxies unless it obtains regulatory
approval, a lengthy process that would be impossible to
complete before American General's annual meeting tomorrow. A
spokeswoman for the department said Torchmark would risk
possible felony charges if it violates the order.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>But some takeover specialists, while conceding that the
decision injects a new element of uncertainty into the proxy
fight, predicted Torchmark would obtain a court order
allowing it to continue.</p>
<p>Although American General shares plunged in the early
afternoon, they closed at $39, down only 62.5 cents in New
York Stock Exchange composite trading. Torchmark shares
closed on the Big Board at $43.625, up 25 cents.</p>
<p>Torchmark said it "strongly disagreed" with the ruling and
plans to immediately challenge its validity in court.
Torchmark added that its Tennessee counsel advised it that it
is free to continue to solicit proxies and that the Tennessee
order isn't effective until approved by a court.</p>
<p>American General, based in Houston, said it is "gratified"
and added that it plans to hold its annual meeting tomorrow
as scheduled.</p>
<p>The Tennessee decision, rendered by acting commissioner
Joe Huddleston, supported an earlier opinion by the
department's legal staff that Torchmark's actions constituted
an attempt to obtain control of American General without
proper regulatory clearance. Mr. Huddleston also ordered
Torchmark to drop its efforts to pass a nonbinding
shareholder resolution asking American General's board to put
the company up for sale.</p>
<p>Torchmark has argued that its efforts wouldn't enable it
to control American General, in part because it only
nominated five people for the insurer's 15-member board.
Torchmark also describes its nominees as "independent."
Torchmark, which previously made a $50-a-share, or $6.3
billion, offer for American General in late March and later
dropped it, said it will make another takeover proposal if it
wins the proxy fight.</p>
<p>But Mr. Huddleston, after hearing two days of testimony,
found that the department and American General "have
established by a preponderance of the evidence that Torchmark
will have control" of American General after the proxy
solicitation.</p>
<p>The decision brought to light new details of Torchmark's
bid for American General. According to the acting
commissioner, Torchmark requested its investment banker,
Morgan Stanley & Co., to evaluate a possible merger with
American General in late January or early February. Dubbed
"Project Patton," the takeover strategy was approved by
Torchmark's board Feb. 26, Mr. Huddleston said. In mid-March,
Torchmark developed a two-prong attack, the acting
commissioner found: Seek first to negotiate a merger, and if
that failed, launch a proxy contest.</p>
<p>Separately, Torchmark said an Indiana Superior Court judge
issued a preliminary injunction delaying a hearing on the
proxy solicitation before the Indiana insurance commissioner.
Judge Richard L. Milan delayed the hearing, scheduled for
today until Monday. In its lawsuit, Torchmark had alleged
that Indiana's insurance commissioner abused the office's
discretion and violated due process.</p>
