	<p class="article-leader">Dresdner Bank AG said it is holding talks with Deutsche
Kreditbank AG over a banking joint venture in East Germany.
   Dresdner confirmed a statement by Kreditbank President
Edgar Most that the two banks are holding talks.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>But West Germany's second-largest banking group declined
to disclose details of the negotiations, which Mr. Most said
involved the establishment of a joint banking network of
around 50 branches.</p>
<p>Frankfurt-based Dresdner has a stated strategy of
expanding broadly and swiftly into East Germany as soon as
regulations and the contemplated economic and monetary union
between the two Germanys allow.</p>
<p>Mr. Most, who is chief executive officer of East Germany's
first full-service, or universal, banking institution, didn't
disclose further details of the contemplated venture, other
than to say that Kreditbank expects to sign a letter of
intent soon to set up the joint venture. Mr. Most was quoted
as saying that one-month-old Kreditbank is aiming to broaden
its business ties with West German banks.</p>
