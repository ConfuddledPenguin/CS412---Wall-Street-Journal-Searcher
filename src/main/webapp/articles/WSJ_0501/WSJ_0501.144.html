	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- The Justice Department filed a $543,000 suit
against Superior Auto Sales Inc., an auto importer, charging
that the Buffalo, N.Y., company failed to install seat belts
or air bags as required by law.
   The company is believed to be the nation's largest "gray
market" importer of cars to the U.S., according to a
statement issued by the department.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The lawsuit, filed in federal court in Buffalo, was
brought by the Justice Department on behalf of the National
Highway Traffic Safety Administration. It is intended to
enforce a law requiring foreign-car importers to install
passive restraints. The law was passed in 1984 and took
effect on a phased-in basis. By last September, all imported
cars were required to comply with the safety regulations.</p>
<p>A Justice Department spokesman said the number of cars
involved wasn't known at this time. A company spokesman
couldn't be reached for comment.</p>
