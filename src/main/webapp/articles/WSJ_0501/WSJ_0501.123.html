	<p class="article-leader">Soybean futures prices declined on profit-taking,
following a sharp run-up in price last week.
   "There was massive commodity-fund buying last week; we
were due for a respite," said one analyst. Many commodity
fund managers follow price trends, so that their purchases on
the heels of rising prices fuel subsequent rallies.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Adding to the slump yesterday was a 30-to-90-day weather
forecast, released after the close of trading Friday, that
predicted moderate temperatures and normal moisture levels
across many U.S. growing regions. Some speculators last week
were buying soybeans on the belief that the forecast would
call for hot, dry weather, possibly leading to a
drought-induced crop shortage this year and higher crop
prices, analysts said.</p>
<p>Soybean futures for July delivery slid 2.5 cents a bushel
to close at $6.4850 a bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade.</p>
<p>Export demand and favorable weather forecasts buoyed corn
futures prices slightly. July corn futures gained 0.25 cents
a bushel to close at $2.83 a bushel on the Board of Trade.</p>
<p>The outlook for potential frost in certain winter-wheat
growing regions in coming days sent wheat futures prices
higher. Wheat futures for July delivery advanced 4.75 cents a
bushel to close at $3.4575 a bushel on the Board of Trade.</p>
<p>In other commodity markets yesterday:</p>
<p>ENERGY: Crude oil contracts were generally higher, though
trading was thin ahead of tomorrow's meeting of the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries. The market
opened strongly on anticipation that OPEC may agree to cut
back its production in May and June. Prices were then knocked
down by waves of selling, before they recovered late in the
session. Crude oil for June delivery actually ended
unchanged, at $18.54 a barrel on the New York Mercantile
Exchange, but outer-month contracts finished higher. July
crude, for instance, wound up seven cents higher, at $19.27 a
barrel. Heating oil rallied while spot prices for gasoline
plunged, both mainly for technical reasons. The expiring May
heating oil contract gained 2.79 cents a gallon to 56.53
cents. Gasoline for May delivery fell 0.95 cent to 60 cents a
gallon.</p>
<p>COPPER: Copper for May delivery fell 2.7 cents a pound, to
finish at $1.1690. Futures prices started off weak, recovered
and then settled back again. The April contract had expired
Thursday at a very high price because of tight supplies, and
"after an expiration like that, there is a tendency for the
market to pause and for prices to sag," said Robert Green,
president of Connecticut Minerals & Metals Inc., a Darien,
Conn., metals consulting and trading company. April's final
price of $1.35 a pound last week was 15 cents a pound above
the May contract's close, one of the biggest premiums traders
could recall. John Gross, president of J.E. Gross &
Associates Inc., a New City, N.Y., consultant to the copper
industry, said that when a spot month expires at a premium,
the next month usually rises to pick up the firmness or a
good part of it. "That didn't happen this time because the
April premium over May was so large," he said. Meanwhile in
Peru, a miners' and smelter workers' strike continues at
Southern Peru Copper Corp. despite recent indications that
union and management may be coming closer together, another
analyst said. "Management has made offers but none have been
accepted," he said. There has been talk that a national
miners' strike might be called next Monday if the strike at
Southern Peru Copper -- a walkout that began March 12 --
isn't settled by then.</p>
<p>PRECIOUS METALS: Futures prices rebounded from early
declines but ended mixed. June delivery gold was off $2.60 an
ounce at $371.40. At the day's low in early trading it dipped
to $367.70, just 70 cents above its life-of-contract low.
July silver ended higher, with a gain of 1.5 cents an ounce
at $5.0150, after dropping to a new life-of-contract low of
$497.00 (the previous low was $497.70.) July platinum
declined $1.50 an ounce at $474.10. At one point, July
platinum traded as low as $467.00. The early declines in
precious metals appeared to be influenced by active selling
earlier in Europe, according to Ian MacDonald, vice
president, Credit Suisse, New York. Many European traders
will be observing May Day today. Platinum was weaker than
gold mostly because platinum is a thinner market and tends to
exaggerate price movements more than gold, Mr. MacDonald
said. Gold's rebound was touched off by demand from Europe
and the Middle East when the metal dropped to its low for the
day, he said: "It was apparent that, as the June gold price
approached the $366 level, new demand was attracted."</p>
