	<p class="article-leader">MOSLEM MILITANTS FREED an American captive, the second in
eight days.
   Kidnappers in Beirut, putting pressure on Bush to
reciprocate with a goodwill gesture toward Iran, released
Frank Reed, who had been held since September 1986. The
57-year-old educator, who called his captivity "lonely" and
"boring," headed to West Germany after a stop in Syria.
Robert Polhill, freed April 22, delivered a message from his
captors to Bush, who hailed Reed's release and thanked Iran
and Syria. The president also said he'd have "no objection"
if Israel frees a Shiite Moslem cleric, as Tehran has
demanded.</p>

<p>A House Democratic task force said El Salvador's inquiry

<p>A citizens' group in Latvia demanded that the Baltic
republic emulate Lithuania and proclaim its independence from
the Soviet Union. The group, claiming to represent hundreds
of thousands of Latvians, termed the republic "an occupied
country." The call came as the legislature prepared to meet
this week to discuss secession.</p>
<p>About 20,000 Lithuanians gathered to mourn a man who
burned himself to death in Moscow last week to protest the
Kremlin's efforts to end the republic's independence bid.

republic was prepared to suspend its secession drive if
Moscow agrees to open negotiations.</p>

<p>West German leaders attempted to overcome Kremlin
opposition to a united Germany's membership in NATO, saying

negotiations Saturday in Bonn.</p>

for the Central American nation.</p>
