	<p class="article-leader">PepsiCo Inc. reported a 10% increase in first-quarter net
income, despite continued expenses from earlier acquisitions.
   The soft-drink, snack-food and restaurant concern's
earnings rose to $181.9 million, or 68 cents a share, from
$165.1 million, or 62 cents a share, a year earlier. The
latest quarter's earnings were diluted by a
higher-than-anticipated 12-cents-a-share expense from last
year's acquisitions, the company said.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Sales of the Purchase, N.Y.-based company rose 24% to
$3.68 billion from $2.96 billion last year.</p>
<p>Though some analysts expected Pepsi to earn closer to 70
cents a share in the period, Pepsi Chairman and Chief
Executive Officer Wayne Calloway said, "This is an excellent
start on what should be another year of record profits for
PepsiCo."</p>
<p>Most analysts seem to agree, pointing to Pepsi's hefty 22%
jump in operating profit, excluding acquisitions. "You can't
ignore the underlying strength of the operating businesses,"
said George Thompson, an analyst at Prudential-Bache
Securities Inc. "We should see some pretty strong profit
comparisons throughout the year."</p>
<p>Pepsi's stock rose $1.75 a share yesterday, to close at
$66.25 in New York Stock Exchange composite trading.</p>
<p>Overall restaurant earnings jumped 39% in the first
quarter. Pizza Hut and Taco Bell continued to turn in strong
performances of 37% and 48% growth in operating profit,
respectively. The big surprise came from a revitalized
Kentucky Fried Chicken, which posted a 37% increase in
operating profit, as promotional menu pricing and its new
"Hot Wings" product boosted customer traffic.</p>
<p>"These days, fast-food restaurants are competing more and
more on the basis of price, and Pepsi is leading the pack in
that regard," said Roy D. Burry, an analyst at Kidder,
Peabody & Co. "Its {restaurant} profits could outpace the
other two businesses this year."</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Pepsi's soft-drink operating profit rose 27% to
$151.5 million. The company said both the Diet Pepsi and
Mountain Dew brands showed double-digit growth in the
quarter. International soft-drink earnings were down,
however, from an unusually strong 1989 first quarter. In
addition, the company incurred seasonal losses in two
bottling operations recently repurchased in Greece and Japan.</p>
<p>Excluding last year's acquisition of Smiths Crisps and
Walkers Crisps, Frito Lay's international profit jumped more
than 50%. This offset slower domestic growth, which was
hampered by higher advertising and marketing expenses. In
addition, sales of Doritos declined from last year, because
the previous year's potato shortage boosted sales of
corn-based products.</p>
<p>Separately, Kentucky Fried Chicken's franchise association
proceeded with a lawsuit against the company. It alleges that
Kentucky Fried Chicken is violating renewal rights under the
existing contract, and that its proposed new contract takes
away certain franchisee rights, including territorial and
other protections. In response to the lawsuit, Kentucky Fried
Chicken President and Chief Executive John M. Cranor said,
"To be competitive, we need a new contract that matches the
specific performance requirements already found in the
contracts currently being used by our major competitors."</p>
