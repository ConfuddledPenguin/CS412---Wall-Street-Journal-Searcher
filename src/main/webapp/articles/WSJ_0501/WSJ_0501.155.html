	<p class="article-leader">Allied-Signal Inc., Morris Township, N.J., will expand its
international business in the 1990s, according to Chairman
and Chief Executive Officer Edward L. Hennessy Jr.
   Speaking at the company's annual meeting, Mr. Hennessy
noted that 36% of the company's revenue is generated outside
the U.S. and about 30% of the employees work in other
countries. He said, "I intend for these percentages to grow
in the 1990s as we improve our positions in markets
throughout the world."</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Mr. Hennessy said capital expenditures will rise this year
from $541 million in 1989.</p>
<p>Company-funded research, development and engineering will
fall this year from 1989 levels to "slightly more than $600
million," because of "some divestitures and a tighter focus
on our key development programs," Mr. Hennessy said. However,
a rise in customer-funded research, development and
engineering will keep total research spending at $1.2 billion
this year, the same as 1989, Mr. Hennessy said.</p>
