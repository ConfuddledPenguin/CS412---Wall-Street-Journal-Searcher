	<p class="article-leader">TOKYO -- When Japan earlier this year launched a $1
billion project to revolutionize the world's factories, it
expected praise from grateful Americans and Europeans.
   Instead, it got egg on its face.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The Intelligent Manufacturing System proposed by Japan is
a 10-year project to integrate existing factory technologies
from the major industrialized countries, to develop a
world-wide standard for future factory technologies, and to
pool international resources to create "21st century"
high-tech systems. The project, in the form of a consortium,
would include governments, companies and universities.</p>
<p>Cut from the famous Japanese industrial-policy mold, the
proposed consortium has intrigued U.S. companies that can't
get similar backing for such programs at home. But it has
triggered an uproar in the U.S. and Europe, where some
officials say it smacks of a Japanese Trojan horse to take
over the world economy.</p>
<p>Early last week, the Commerce Department hosted a
contentious meeting near Washington on the project with about
50 U.S. industry representatives. On Thursday, an assistant
secretary of commerce blasted the program at a congressional
hearing. Commerce officials plan to raise their concerns at
an annual meeting on bilateral science and technology
exchange this week.</p>
<p>"We are very disturbed by the way the Japanese approached
this," says a senior Commerce official. "They don't want a
level playing field. They want to target our industries."
European Community officials echo those sentiments.</p>
<p>The Japanese, who for years have been berated for keeping
research closed to outsiders, profess bemusement. "When we do
nothing, we are criticized. When we do something, we are
criticized," sighs Takeshi Isayama, director of the
industrial machinery division of the Ministry of
International Trade and Industry, or MITI, which is helping
fund the project.</p>
<p>As the governments feud, United Technologies Corp. and
Rockwell International Corp. are signing up for the project,
and others have indicated interest. With the Bush
administration dead set against anything that smacks of an
industrial policy, some companies say, Americans looking for
such assistance might as well get it from the Japanese.</p>
<p>"If our government isn't doing equally visionary things,
what would they have us do?" asks Stanley P. Krueger,
president of United Technologies' Japan office. "We can't sit
still in the U.S., turn off the lights and send our employees
home."</p>
<p>Leo Reddy, president of the National Coalition for
Advanced Manufacturing in Washington, says he has serious
concerns about the program, but adds: "They're putting up the
money, our government isn't. It's a metaphor for our time, a
Sputnik. It dramatically underlines the fact the Japanese are
taking manufacturing very seriously."</p>
<p>All these issues are likely to come up with growing
frequency, as the manufacturing consortium is just one of
many the Japanese government is opening up to foreign
companies. Last year, General Electric Co. and United
Technologies' Pratt & Whitney subsidiary signed up for a MITI
project to develop a high-speed jet engine. That raised
hackles about the possibility that the U.S. companies would
leak technology in a field where the U.S. still has the
advantage. But, remarkably enough, it also brought together
two longtime bitter rivals to work on a project.</p>
<p>The consortium was the brainchild of Hiroyuki Yoshikawa,
dean of Tokyo University's Faculty of Engineering and an
expert on manufacturing. The effort he began coordinating
last year now has 80 major Japanese companies on board.</p>
<p>Dr. Yoshikawa's philosophy, outlined in the program
brochure, is that international cooperation in manufacturing
becomes essential as the shortage of skilled labor world-wide
requires more factory automation and technology costs rise.
Among other things, standardization simplifies applying
know-how around the world.</p>
<p>Japan has long conducted industrial research this way.
Government-corporate-university consortia helped Japan catch
up in semiconductors and take the lead in high-definition
television. Such projects have been seen as vehicles for
national development, and closed to outsiders.</p>
<p>But foreigners' lack of access to Japanese research is a
source of international tension. In the West, the most
important scientific work takes place in open university
laboratories, something the Japanese have diligently taken
advantage of. But in Japan, most work is done in closed
corporate facilities, and in closed consortia.</p>
<p>A 1988 U.S.-Japan science and technology agreement was
meant to address such issues. Last year, Japan started the
Human Frontier Science Project, based in Strasbourg, France,
to fund international research. And Japan has been opening up
more of its own projects. Its superconductivity lab has nine
foreign corporate members. Last year, MITI opened all its
major consortia to foreign companies. In addition to the
engine project, it invited outsiders to help research
underground construction.</p>
<p>MITI and Japanese companies will put up $600 million for
the manufacturing consortium in the next decade, with $200
million each from the U.S. and Europe. An international
research center will be set up in Europe or North America.</p>
<p>Japanese researchers and government officials briefed
representatives of foreign companies and embassies in Tokyo
in January. The response was enthusiastic. But when word
filtered back to the U.S. and Europe, the reaction was
cooler.</p>
<p>U.S. Commerce officials say the way the Japanese have
pursued the project hints of trying to sneak around official
channels. While the Japanese made some low-level U.S.
government contacts, they mainly have approached U.S.
industry directly, signing up the Society of Manufacturing
Engineers as the U.S. coordinator. When Commerce officials
complained to the Japanese Embassy in Washington last month,
they were told it was a Japanese private industry project.</p>
<p>The European Community has had tighter control over direct
Japanese contact with companies. But it too has expressed
similar concerns. A few weeks ago, EC officials met with
Commerce officials to compare notes and responses.</p>
<p>To some Westerners, the Japanese have a reason for
avoiding government contacts: the project, they say, is
structured to allow Japanese companies to suck up advanced
Western know-how. While Japan may already use more robots,
they say, the West is ahead in systems integration and
computer software.</p>
<p>"It is directed at one of the few remaining areas where
the U.S. retains technological superiority," James L. Koontz,
president of Kingsbury Corp. and chairman of the National
Center for Manufacturing Sciences, testified before a Senate
commitee last month. "We would lose." Others argue that even
if everybody shares the technology, Japan will be the main
beneficiary because its companies are much quicker about
putting new techniques to use.</p>
<p>To the Japanese, the project is a noble gesture. After
all, they say, study after study proclaims the U.S. is losing
its manufacturing prowess, while Japan pulls further ahead.
In fact, Japanese officials say they had to fight to convince
Japanese companies to participate. Says MITI's Mr. Isayama,
"A lot complained: Why do we have to expose our technology to
outsiders?"</p>
