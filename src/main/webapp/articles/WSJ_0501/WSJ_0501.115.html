	<p class="article-leader">SEATTLE -- Nordstrom Inc. was sued in state court here by
a former salesman who claims the retailer illegally fired him
in 1988 because he tested positive for the AIDS virus.
   The former employee, Sean Mulholland, seeks unspecified
damages for emotional distress, lost compensation and other
factors. Mr. Mulholland described his firing in a page-one
story in this newspaper in February on working conditions at
the retail chain that is renowned for pampering customers.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>A spokesman for Nordstrom denied the allegations. "He was
terminated for legitimate reasons," which "have nothing to do
with the allegations in the lawsuit," the spokesman said.
When pressed, the spokesman added only that Mr. Mulholland
"was terminated as a direct result of not coming to work."</p>
<p>The spokesman branded Mr. Mulholland's suit part of a
negative publicity campaign by the United Food & Commercial
Workers Union, which is locked in a bitter contract dispute
with the company. Mr. Mulholland "was unable physically to
handle the demands of a full-time sales position" and "we
have continually tried to offer him opportunities (to work)
in other areas of the company," the spokesman said.</p>
<p>Mr. Mulholland's suit relating to acquired immune
deficiency syndrome was filed by Webster, Mrak & Blumberg,
the Seattle law firm that represents UFCW Local 1001 in legal
matters stemming from its contract dispute with Nordstrom.</p>
