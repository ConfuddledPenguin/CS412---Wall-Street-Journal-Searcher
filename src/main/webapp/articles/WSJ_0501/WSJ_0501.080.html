	<p class="article-leader">SAN FRANCISCO -- When money manager Claude Rosenberg Jr.
was blindsided by a plunge in Atari Corp. stock some years
ago, he vowed to stop relying on Wall Street analysts as his
eyes and ears in picking stocks.
   Atari's nosedive should have been easy to predict, Mr.
Rosenberg decided, if brokerage analysts had been doing their
jobs tracking a big buildup in inventories at the computer
company.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>So in 1984, Mr. Rosenberg organized Grassroots Research, a
private army of part-time researchers to make on-the-spot
inspections of corners of corporate America that Wall Street
analysts rarely visit.</p>
<p>Today, with nearly 250 part-time interviewers in the U.S.
and several foreign countries, Grassroots churns out about 50
research reports a month on topics as broad as the state of
the economy and as specialized as how Gillette Co.'s new
Sensor razor blade is selling in Europe. The reports go
exclusively to Mr. Rosenberg's investment advisory firm, RCM
Capital Management, which manages $16 billion, mostly for
pension-fund clients.</p>
<p>Mr. Rosenberg and his associates credit Grassroots with
turning up early data on the success of Levi Strauss & Co.'s
501 jeans, a 1985 rebound in property-casualty insurance
prices, the ebbs and flows of semiconductor orders and the
rise and decline of various U.S. cities. These and dozens of
other findings, big and small, have resulted in RCM buying
stocks in time for a sizable rise, or perhaps more
importantly, shrinking holdings before they decline.</p>
<p>"I can get (our) people in or out of a stock before
information becomes commonly known, and especially out
because Wall Street doesn't want to deal with bad
information," boasts Craig Gordon, the 35-year-old director
of the Grassroots operation.</p>
<p>While complaints about the slipping quality of Wall Street
research have been heard from clients since the 1987 stock
market crash, Mr. Rosenberg saw the decline well before that.
"We came to the conclusion early on that the Street was
shrinking, and with it, the research provided by the Street
would shrink," he says. And the research he expected "would
suffer the most, would be the getting out in the field and
kicking the tires" type.</p>
<p>Compared with the number-crunching and company forecasts
that are at the heart of traditional investment research, the
Grassroots operation collects its data from the likes of
cosmetics buyers, sneaker salesmen, travel agents and even
town landfill operators (who know if dumping fees are rising
to the detriment of waste disposal companies.) Company
officials are almost never queried.</p>
<p>Instead, Grassroots has built up a network of some 22,000
contacts in various industries that are questioned
periodically in face-to-face interviews conducted by 175
part-time survey-takers, mostly housewives with young
children. In recent days, part of this field staff did 530
in-store interviews nationwide looking for early signs of a
recession, a topic of major concern to RCM's portfolio
managers. (The survey turned up little evidence of
recessionary behavior among consumers.)</p>
<p>Grassroots doesn't replace RCM's traditional investment
research operation, which employs 34 full-time stock analysts
and support staff; they consume many times the annual
Grassroots budget of about $700,000.</p>
<p>"We're the second opinion," says Mr. Gordon, who worked
briefly as a newspaper reporter before turning to market
research and eventually forming Grassroots. "Forty-five times
out of 50, Grassroots is saying the same thing as Wall Street
research, and you can't do anything with it except feel more
confident about the information," he says.</p>
<p>But the times when Grassroots picks up something new or
contrary to Wall Street's thinking are still enough for the
operation to earn its keep, Mr. Gordon says. One example: a
store survey done right after the 1987 crash that found
consumers were still buying.</p>
<p>"It gave us the confidence that the world wasn't falling
apart," says Mr. Rosenberg, who made timely purchases for
RCM's stock portfolio, helping it outperform the overall
stock market in 1987. (RCM did so again last year, posting a
34.4% gain against 31.7% for the Standard & Poor's 500-stock
index.)</p>
<p>Mr. Gordon says that Grassroots' tougher assignments go to
journalists, often working for speciality publications and
doing tasks on the side for Grassroots. He says that a
health-care reporter who was asked by Grassroots last year to
survey cardiologists on the acceptance C.R. Bard Inc.'s
angioplasty catheters, an instrument used to help clear
blocked arteries as an alternative to bypass surgery, found
some doctors complaining of tips breaking off the devices.</p>
<p>The findings were passed to RCM's portfolio managers, who
decided to sell some of the firm's holding of Bard stock.
Bard later issued several recalls of its catheters and
reported lower earnings in 1989 for the first time in 16
years.</p>
<p>Grassroots pays a researcher $600 for a straight-forward
report on cosmetics sales, and $1,500 for a much broader
survey of 75 farm-equipment dealers. Another network of
"readers" send RCM about 2,000 clippings a week from local
newspapers, which are reviewed in hopes of spotting trends.
The final research is used only by RCM, although snippets are
sent to clients.</p>
<p>People who supply information to Grassroots interviewers
get a copy of finished surveys in which they participate,
which enoucrages them to reply to future polls.</p>
<p>Some of Mr. Gordon's discoveries draw yawns from the stock
market. He was excited when his field staff reported weeks
ago that two department-store chains carrying lawn mowers
with motors made by Tecumseh Products Inc. had quietly
started to add mower lines with motors made by Briggs &
Stratton Inc. But when Briggs & Stratton last week reported a
strong quarterly sales increase, the stock rose only
temporarily on the news and still remains below its 52-week
high.</p>
<p>Mr. Gordon says the stock market sometimes is slow to
digest information even when it's no longer secret. He also
acknowledges that collecting data from the field has its
failings. One is that focusing on sales can mean overlooking
a company's problems with costs.</p>
<p>Another is that Grassroots until recently sampled only the
U.S. marketplace, while many companies' fortunes hinge on
their international operations. Expanding Grassroots's
operations to include foreign markets is aimed at plugging
that hole.</p>
<p>Nor is Grassroots's view of the world accepted as gospel
by RCM's own portfolio managers or traditional analysts; they
sometimes react testily when Grassroots' findings contradict
their own. "I get into shouting matches with the
(traditional) analysts upstairs," Mr. Gordon says. "Sometimes
I win and sometimes I lose."</p>
<p>The problem, Mr. Gordon sniffs, is that "the analysts
upstairs are getting all their information from Wall Street."</p>
