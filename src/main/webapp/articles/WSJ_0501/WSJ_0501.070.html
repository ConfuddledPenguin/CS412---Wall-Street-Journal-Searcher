   Minority Opportunities</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>THE SAVINGS and loan bailout may give people of color a
bigger presence in the thrift business.</p>
<p>An amendment to last year's Financial Institutions Reform,
Recovery and Enforcement Act requires federal agencies to
help blacks, Hispanics and Asians increase their presence in
the restructured S&L industry.</p>
<p>John Harshaw, president of the American League of
Financial Institutions, a Washington-based organization of
minority-owned S&Ls, says that new bidding rules for the
government's S&L fire sale will keep failed minority-owned
thrifts in minority hands. Although minority investors
haven't succeeded in buying any of the 57 non-minority
thrifts the government has sold, Mr. Harshaw expects
minorities will ultimately pick up 10 of the approximately
354 S&Ls in U.S. hands.</p>
<p>The bailout also creates opportunities for minorities in
legal, accounting and other services. The Resolution Trust
Corp., created to sort out the thrift mess, recently set a 3%
price advantage for minorities and women bidding for
non-legal professional work.</p>
<p>Resolution Trust expects to spend up to $500 million on
outside legal services in 1990. In 1989, less than $2 million
of the $99 million spent on outside legal fees went to
minority or women-owned firms. But a Federal Deposit
Insurance Corp. official insists a new reporting system will
soon show an increase in fees paid to minority lawyers.</p>
<p>Another Magazine Aims</p>
<p>For Asian-Americans</p>
<p>THE OWNERS of A.D. magazine, set to premiere next month,
want the publication to be a vehicle for a new Asian-American
consciousness.</p>
<p>It won't be easy. There are unique obstacles to the
success of A.D. -- which stands for Asian Descent. The Asian
population in the U.S. grew 70% to about 6.5 million between
1980 and 1988, according to a Census Bureau report. Yet most
of the growth came from immigrants, who prefer Asian-language
media, says New York advertising consultant Joseph Lam.</p>
<p>Moreover, there's a traditional reluctance among
Asian-Americans to openly address issues of racial and
cultural identity, which A.D. will emphasize. Audrey Chin, a
financial analyst working on A.D.'s business plan, concedes
Asians are "very quiet" about such issues, including
discrimination. Still, she believes A.D. will provide "a
strong voice."</p>
<p>A.D. will target urban East Coast Asian-Americans. Two
similar magazines, Jade and Rice, have failed in the past
three years, and a third, Transpacific, has "just begun to
scrape the black" after four years, says Publisher Tom Kagy.
To make it, A.D. will have to convince skeptical advertisers
that there are many upscale young Asian-Americans who feel
the way editor Jeff Yang does: "Each of us once tried to be
the same, to fit in," he says. "But eventually we realized
that you can't escape the role of color in this country."</p>
<p>Seed Clouds Spread</p>
<p>Over Engineering Pool</p>
<p>CORPORATE CASH is starting to flow to the nation's
fastest-growing pool of engineering talent -- black and
Hispanic students.</p>
<p>General Electric Co. has committed $35 million over 10
years for minority students and faculty. And General Motors
Corp. has almost doubled its support for minority engineering
students since 1984 to $1.9 million last year. "We're trying
to make sure we have enough engineering talent," says Richard
O'Brien, a GM personnel official.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the National Action Council for Minorities in
Engineering, which distributes corporate funds to schools and
minority engineering students, says it's running $500,000
ahead of last year's $5 million budget.</p>
<p>In 1989, blacks received only 2,122, or 3%, of the 68,291
engineering degrees awarded, about the same share as Hispanic
students. On the bright side, U.S. engineering school
enrollments turned up last year after a seven-year slide,
with black and Hispanic students accounting for more than
half the increase.</p>
<p>Of course, some professionals believe corporations haven't
done enough. "Imagine at one point there was no money
running," says Tyrone Taborn, who publishes three magazines
for black and Hispanic engineers. "Now there is a trickle."</p>
<p>A Departure From Norm</p>
<p>In Airport Business
</p>
<p>AT THE NATION'S airports, minority entrepreneurs are
quietly making business connections.</p>
<p>In 1980, the Transportation Department began requiring
that more airport concessions be owned by minorities and
women because a study had found that neither of these groups
owned businesses at the top 21 airports. "It was almost a
closed industry, serviced by a handful of vendors," says
Clark Sharp, a Federal Aviation Administration civil rights
officer.</p>
<p>Now, airport authorities must build minority participation
into the bidding process for any new or amended concession
lease.</p>
<p>Marriott Corp.'s Host/Travel Plaza's division, a major
concessionaire, has had to give up some ground. So Host has
been expanding the role of minority partners. "We've tried to
work out ways to give minorities meaningful participation
opportunities," says a Host spokesman. "It's one of the facts
of business life today."</p>
<p>The rule helped Patrick Jones, a black Chicago venture
capitalist, snap up three car rental outlets, at airports in
Pittsburgh, Orlando, Fla., and Charlotte, N.C. One of the six
rental concessions at each of the airports was reserved for
minorities or women. "It's a sleeper," Mr. Jones says of the
little-publicized policy.</p>
