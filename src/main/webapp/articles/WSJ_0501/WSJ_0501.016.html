	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- The New York Mercantile Exchange named Robert
R. Davis, a member of the Commodity Futures Trading
Commission, as its senior vice president for planning and
development, effective May 21.
   Mr. Davis, 41 years old, who was appointed to the CFTC by
President Reagan in 1984, resigned as a commissioner
effective yesterday.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Until his resignation, Mr. Davis was chairman of the
CFTC's financial products advisory committee. He initiated
the revision of CFTC regulations on hedging and risk
management. He also reviewed and analyzed off-exchange
derivative instruments, such as swaps, for the CFTC.</p>
<p>R. Patrick Thompson, president of the New York Merc, said
Mr. Davis "brings to our exchange broad-based expertise in
international finance, strategic planning and negotiating,
and economic research and policy development, as well as a
deep understanding of the current regulatory environment."
The New York Merc is the nation's third-largest futures
exchange and the largest market for trading oil and other
energy futures contracts.</p>
<p>In an interview, Mr. Davis said the chief problem facing
all futures exchanges today is competition. "When I joined
the CFTC," he said, "the exchanges had no competition; today,
they must compete with foreign futures markets and
off-exchange products." He noted that three of the 11 largest
futures contracts based on volume now trade on foreign
exchanges. Mr. Davis also noted that while many of the
off-exchange products are complementary to exchange
contracts, some of them are directly competitive.</p>
<p>According to Mr. Davis, futures exchanges must play a role
in a world that is moving toward 24-hour trading for certain
contracts. "Maybe screen {electronic} trading will be the
most effective way to offer that service, but right now that
remains to be determined," he said. "For competitive reasons,
exchanges must remain the lowcost producers."</p>
<p>Prior to joining the CFTC, Mr. Davis was senior economist
for the Congressional Joint Economic Committee. Before that,
he served as a vice president and economist at the Harris
Trust & Savings Bank in Chicago.</p>
