	<p class="article-leader">BOSTON (AP) -- Aetna Casualty & Surety Co., a unit of
Aetna Life & Casualty Co. of Hartford, Conn., filed suit
against the state, claiming that Massachusetts laws
controlling withdrawal from the state's car insurance market
are unconstitutional.
   "The insurance commissioner sets the prices so price
competition is nonexistent," said John J. Martin, president
of Aetna's personal financing security division.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"Worse still, an insurer that decides to leave the private
passenger auto insurance market in light of such conditions
confronts a massive hurdle to any orderly exit from that
market because it must pay what amounts to extortion or lose
all its licenses to any other insurance business," Mr. Martin
said in a statement.</p>
<p>Dorothy Krenzer, a spokeswoman for the state Insurance
Division, said the agency wouldn't have any comment until
Commissioner Timothy Gailey has reviewed documents on the
suit.</p>
<p>John Hawkins, an Aetna spokesman, said the firm seeks to
exit from the Massachusetts car insurance market.</p>
<p>Mr. Hawkins said: "Over a period of years, we have either
lost money or made so little that it's not an acceptable
business environment for us."</p>
<p>Under state law, insurers must pay an assessment for eight
years in order to withdraw from the Massachusetts car
insurance market without losing their license to sell other
kinds of insurance.</p>
<p>The insurance commissioner also can revoke all licenses
granted an insurer if it pulls out of the car insurance
market because of the state's insurance laws.</p>
