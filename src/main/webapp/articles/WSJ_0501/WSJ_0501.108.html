	<p class="article-leader">The line-item veto is an idea born out of such common
sense that it resists every attempt to kill it. Last week,
the Senate Judiciary Committee voted 8 to 6 to approve two
versions of a constitutional amendment that would give
Presidents authority to veto individual spending items within
bills. It is the first time the committee has approved an
item-veto amendment since 1884.
   If anyone needs further evidence that a line-item veto is
needed to restore the integrity of the federal budget
process, he has only to look at what just happened to the
$800 million aid package for Panama and Nicaragua. Congress
stuffed it with more than $1 billion in unrelated domestic
spending. That's a good example of why after the committee
vote Senator Paul Simon said, "It keeps our hopes alive of
bringing some fiscal sanity into the budget process."</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>One of the two item-veto amendments approved by the
Judiciary Committee is sponsored by liberal Democratic
Senators Simon and Alan Dixon, both of Illinois. It would
help bring back the impoundment power that Congress took away
in the 1974 budget "reform" bill. Other Democrats, including
Fritz Hollings, Joe Biden, David Boren and Howell Heflin have
previously supported the concept. They all argue that 43
Governors have such veto power, and that Congress itself gave
the item veto to the Governors of Puerto Rico and the Virgin
Islands. If it was a good idea for them, why not for the
President?</p>
<p>The Simon-Dixon proposal would allow the President to
reduce or eliminate individual spending items. Congress could
override the veto with a simple majority in both houses.
Another version by Senator Strom Thurmond would empower the
President to kill items but not reduce them. A two-thirds
vote of both Houses would be required to override.</p>
<p>No one claims that the line-item veto would be a budgetary
cure-all. Much of the budget is in entitlements that few
politicians support cutting. Its power is that it turns the
President into a more active participant in the budget
process. Right now, the only way a budget is passed is if the
Congressional leadership buys most of the Members off with a
pet project or subsidy.</p>
<p>President Bush has been talking up the item veto recently.
"The President needs the power to make the tough calls on
spending, take the heat," he said last week, "and I'm
perfectly prepared to do that."</p>
<p>More Members, disgusted with a budget process that
resembles "The Price Is Right," have come to agree. As the
only elected official with a national constituency, a
President should have some oversight power over the parochial
interests.</p>
<p>Along with lawyer Stephen Glazier, we have argued that the
Constitution already gives the President the power to veto
every bill, order or resolution that Congress passes and that
includes individual appropriations whether they are called
"bills" or not. President Bush has said he is looking for
just the right case to test the item veto in court.</p>
<p>A President equipped with the line-item veto would be the
best insurance that the budget deficit would continue to
glide downward. It also would enhance accountability in
government. The Senate Judiciary Committee's favorable 8 to 6
vote indicates that opinion on Capitol Hill is beginning to
move in that direction.</p>
