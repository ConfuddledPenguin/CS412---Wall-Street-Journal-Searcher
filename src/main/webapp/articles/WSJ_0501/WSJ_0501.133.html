	<p class="article-leader">BOISE, Idaho -- Boise Cascade Corp. said it plans to seek
a buyer for its Vancouver, Wash., paper mill.
   The forest products concern said its intent to sell
reflects a decision not to focus on carbonless paper, which
is produced at the mill. The mill is the smallest of the
company's 10 paper-manufacturing plants.</p>
