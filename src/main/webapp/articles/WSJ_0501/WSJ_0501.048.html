	<p class="article-leader">SEOUL, South Korea -- Share prices on the Korea Stock
Exchange recorded their biggest single-day plunge on Monday,
partly because of nervousness about labor unrest following
violence at South Korea's biggest shipyard over the weekend.
   The Tokyo stock market was closed for a holiday. London
share prices closed mostly lower in lackluster dealings.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>In Tokyo Tuesday, the Nikkei index of 225 selected issues
fell 45.21 points to close the morning session at 29539.59.</p>
<p>In South Korea, protests by investors crippled operations
at stock trading offices in Seoul and at least six other
cities. Investors angry about the government's refusal to
support the sliding market forced several provincial
brokerage firms to keep their doors locked.</p>
<p>The Korea Composite Stock Price Index dived through the
700-point barrier in early trading and closed at 688.66, down
31.71, or 4.4%, from Saturday. Trading was weak, with volume
of 4.4 million shares valued at 63.7 billion won ($90.7
million). Losers far outnumbered gainers, 750 to two, while
nine issues closed unchanged. About 654 stocks fell to their
daily limit lows; the government sets a daily maximum for
each stock's price movements.</p>
<p>The index's closing level was the lowest since Oct. 13,
1988, when it hit 685.71. This year, the index has tumbled
219.93 points, or 24%, and it was near the low limit Monday.</p>
<p>Brokers said the main reason for the decline was weekend
comments by economic planners that the government wouldn't
prop up the market. Bearish sentiment was exacerbated by
labor unrest in the industrial city of Ulsan, where tens of
thousands of Hyundai Group workers on Monday stayed away from
work to protest the police storming of the company's main
shipyard on Saturday to evict strikers. Ulsan was reported
paralyzed by violent protests. About 15 branches of
securities companies in the southwestern city of Kwangju
refused to open their doors on Monday, the Yonhap news agency
reported. Yonhap said work stopped at seven brokerage firms
in Musan, in the southeast. Three people were arrested on
Monday in the southern port of Pusan, after causing serious
disturbances at securities branches last week. One of those
arrested led 150 investors into a branch of Cheil Securities
in the city. They screamed for President Roh Tae Woo to be
removed and damaged the property.</p>
<p>Tension was growing in other parts of the country, too, as
a major dissident labor federation plans to hold nationwide
general strikes on the Tuesday workers' holiday.</p>
<p>The stock market's plunge and the unrest forced President
Roh to convene an emergency meeting of his economic ministers
Monday night to review the nation's growing economic crisis,
news reports said. Mr. Roh met with economic advisers to
draft measures to curb inflation and spiraling land
speculation, and ordered formation of a special team to
consider ways to stabilize the real estate market, including
those that may encourage securities and insurance companies
to dispose of their land holdings.</p>
<p>In London, stocks were lower, though they shrugged off
bearish sentiment that had considerably damped the market
early in the session to post a gradual climb from midday
minimums.</p>
<p>Heartening first-quarter results from the British
industrial bellwether Imperial Chemical Industries PLC, as
well as some selective bargain-hunting, perked the market up,
dealers said. But traders said a bearish mood still hangs
over the market. With economic and political worries,
including local government elections Thursday and a likely
somber quarterly report from the Confederation of British
Industry on Tuesday, "Sentiment still doesn't feel too good,"
a dealer said.</p>
<p>The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 30-share index was off
5.1 points at 1653.6. Volume, on the first day of a new
trading account, was a dismal 363.3 million shares, compared
with 536.7 million on Friday. The 100-share index finished
down 3.2 points at 2103.4, slightly below its intraday high
of 2104.6 and well above the day's low of 2084.4, reached in
the first half-hour of trading.</p>
<p>ICI shares ended up 20 pence at #10.80 ($17.66), after the
company said its pretax first-quarter profit slipped to a
better-than-expected #414 million ($677.1 million) from #442
million a year earlier. "That helped pull the market all the
way back up," a dealer said.</p>
<p>In other earnings-related developments, the textile and
thread concern Tootal Group gained a penny to 87, after
posting a decline in full-year pretax profit to #35.7
million, at the bottom of analysts' expectations, from #42.3
million.</p>
<p>Oil stocks fared poorly. A trader said the sector is
susceptible to stock market movements and isn't "very
resilient." Burmah, which began trading ex-dividend Monday,
lost 19 to 560; Enterprise shed 9 to 555, and Lasmo fell 15
to 559.</p>
<p>Among brewers and distillers, Whitbread slipped 6 to 364,
after County Natwest recommended a switch from Whitbread into
Bass, Britain's largest brewing concern, which rose 20 to 935
and became one of the day's biggest gainers.</p>
<p>Rothmans International jumped 10 to 645. Royal Insurance
fell 14 to 424. The property company Hammerson sank 15 to
712, pushed down both by the market's tone and the property
sector's difficult conditions.</p>
<p>The electronics concern STC shed 11 to 234 on
profit-taking, dealers said. And Ranks Hovis McDougall, a
food company, slid 9 to 364; a trader cited a shift in
speculation that the company has been targeted for a hostile
bid by a Sir James Goldsmithled consortium, after the
entrepreneur gave up his quest for the tobacco and financial
services conglomerate B.A.T Industries last week.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, share prices closed lower in Paris, Frankfurt,
Zurich, Stockholm and Milan, and were mixed in Brussels. The
Amsterdam market was closed for a holiday. South African gold
stocks were down.</p>
<p>Stocks finished lower in Sydney, Hong Kong, Singapore,
Manila, Wellington and Taipei. The Sydney slump took the main
stock-price index down for the seventh consecutive session.
Hong Kong stocks fell 1.2% and Taipei shares tumbled 3.86%.
Manila's lower finish marked its ninth consecutive decline.
The Wellington index fell 1.7% to a two-year low.</p>
