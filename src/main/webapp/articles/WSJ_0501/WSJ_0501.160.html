	<p class="article-leader">SEABROOK, N.H. -- The Seabrook nuclear power plant, which
recently received a commercial operating license, will be
shut down for four to six weeks to modify a turbine.
   The plant has been in a phase-in period and was operating
at less than 10% capacity when it was shut down on Saturday
because readings indicated a shaft in the turbine could
vibrate beyond specifications.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The shutdown is the third for the plant since the Nuclear
Regulatory Commission issued the license in mid-March.
Critics of Seabrook called for an "independent construction
inpsection" of the plant, contending that the shutdowns are a
sign of poor workmanship and an indication that it isn't safe
to operate.</p>
<p>New Hampshire Yankee, which manages the plant for 11 New
England utilities that own a stake in Seabrook, has rejected
such criticism, noting that previous studies have determined
that Seabrook has been built to NRC guidelines. Regarding the
problems found while the plant is working up in stages to
full-power production, a spokesman for New Hampshire Yankee
said a purpose of the phase-in period is to find "areas where
improvements can be made."</p>
