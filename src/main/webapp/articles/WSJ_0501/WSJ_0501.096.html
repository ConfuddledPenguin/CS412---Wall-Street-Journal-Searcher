	<p class="article-leader">In reference to Stephen Morris's April 26 editorial-page
article about our Cambodia broadcast of Thursday night: Your
headline, "ABC Flacks for Hanoi," is provocative, but hardly
accurate.
   It is difficult to respond to someone who does not wish to
address the same subject as we did in our broadcast. The
broadcast intended from the outset to examine the American
relationship with the political-military coalition led by
Prince Sihanouk. By every assessment, including that of
Prince Sihanouk and the U.S. government, the murderous Khmer
Rouge are the most powerful factor in that coalition. How Mr.
Morris concludes from this distance that the Khmer Rouge are
"far from likely to seize {power} soon" simply escapes me. By
way of contrast, the Australian ambassador to Thailand (it is
the Australian plan for a peaceful resolution in Cambodia
that the U.S. supports) told us early this year that, "our
intelligence people say the Khmer Rouge is capable of rolling
over the PRK." The PRK means the present Cambodian
government. "Not if," he said, "but when. It's a question of
whether this is the right time."</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Mr. Morris says we make an "extraordinary statement" by
reporting that the Cambodian army, "without the Vietnamese,"
has "a real problem fighting" the noncommunist and Khmer
Rouge opposition, supported by the U.S. and China. Recent
reports of the Vietnamese returning to assist the Cambodian
army against the Khmer Rouge, to which Mr. Morris refers,
surely certify how vulnerable the Cambodian government feels.</p>
<p>Mr. Morris claims we did not tell our audience that the
present leadership in Phnom Penh is still made up of
"unrepentant" Khmer Rouge. We most certainly told our
audience of Prime Minister Hun Sen's history as a former
member of the Khmer Rouge who defected to the Vietnamese and
that he was widely regarded as a Vietnamese puppet. I have no
idea whether he and others are unrepentant.</p>
<p>Nor, I suspect, does Mr. Morris. We sought proof, not
merely innuendo, that the leadership is as Mr. Morris
describes it. We did not find proof and Mr. Morris does not
offer it. We did quote many sources, Cambodian and others who
felt that the political situation in Cambodia, with respect
to basic freedoms, was improving. Mr. Morris quotes Amnesty
International as reporting thousands of political prisoners
there in 1987. Perhaps he has missed the most recent Amnesty
report, which says that 430 people were detained for
political reasons in 1988; surely 430 too many, but an
improvement over thousands. Mr. Morris asserts that we
incorrectly report that there is cooperation on the
battlefield between the so-called noncommunist resistance and
the Khmer Rouge. It is, among others, Prince Sihanouk, the
leader of the coalition, who during our broadcast confirms
such battlefield cooperation. And then there is the question
of Col. Denny Laine. It has long puzzled many observers on
the Thai-Cambodian border, why a Special Forces colonel was
assigned as Mr. Morris states to worry about the "human
rights abuses in the {Khmer Rouge} refugee camps."</p>
<p>Col. Laine had agreed to speak with us on camera, but as
we noted during the broadcast, "the Pentagon said, No." We
continue to wonder why the Pentagon refuses to let an officer
speak to us if his only job is to be concerned with the human
rights of civilians in refugee camps. Col. Laine told us, and
we reported, that he had been ordered to leave the border
area pending our arrival there. Mr. Morris neglected to
mention this.</p>
<p>What I find insidious about Mr. Morris's commentary on our
broadcast is his personal, straight out of the '50s,
unsubstantiated attack on our producer Leslie Cockburn, to
whom he refers as a "committed left ideologue."</p>
<p>Ms. Cockburn, who has worked for CBS Reports, 60 Minutes,
West 57th, Front Line on PBS, and now on assignment for ABC
News, does have the reputation of a producer/reporter who can
make life difficult for people who do not tell the truth. In
this day and age, Mr. Morris's treatment of Ms. Cockburn
seems an anachronism at best. Upon reflection, it appears to
me that we and Mr. Morris are destined to remain on different
planets. Our intention was to examine what the U.S. is doing,
if anything, to prevent the Khmer Rouge from returning to
power, and whether U.S. recognition of and assistance to the
coalition, which includes the Khmer Rouge, is in fact making
it easier for them. We have believed from the beginning this
was an important subject to anyone concerned with what the
Khmer Rouge did to their fellow Cambodians the last time they
were in power. In some respects Mr. Morris reaffirms our
central theme. He continues to be so preoccupied with Vietnam
that he can't see the Khmer Rouge coming.</p>
