	<p class="article-leader">Bank Building & Equipment Corp. of America, St. Louis,
said it filed for protection from creditors under Chapter 11
of the federal Bankruptcy Code.
   Last autumn, the company disclosed that it had uncovered
financial irregularities at one of its divisions, and that it
expected the problems to reduce earnings by $3.3 million. It
subsequently launched a corporate "downsizing" and financial
restructuring.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>For the fiscal year ended Oct. 31, the company had a loss
of $10.4 million, which it said was attributable "primarily
to mismanagement and irregularities in the Loughman Cabinet
division."</p>
<p>Bank Building filed the petition for reorganization in
federal Bankruptcy Court in St. Louis. It said it plans to
sell off all its real estate, plant machinery and equipment
that won't be required for operations in the reorganized
concern, and that it expects all existing contracts to be
"completed as scheduled." Company officials couldn't be
reached for comment.</p>
<p>Bank Building plans, designs and constructs facilities for
financial and medical clients.</p>
