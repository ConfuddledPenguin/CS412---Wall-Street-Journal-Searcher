	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Stock prices finished mixed as a late round of
buying, spurred by a decline in interest rates and some
encouraging news from International Business Machines, pushed
blue-chip issues higher.
   But while the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 11.71 to
2656.76, the broad market proved unable to shake off the
effect of a broad-based sell-off that kicked off the session.
Declining stocks led advancers by 749 to 732 on the New York
Stock Exchange.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Big Board activity was the lightest since April 9 as
market players awaited this week's major economic reports,
including the April survey of corporate purchasing managers,
due for release today.</p>
<p>Volume totaled just 122,750,000 shares, compared with
130,630,000 shares Friday. Traders also attributed the
sluggish activity to a lack of business from overseas.
Japanese investors were observing the Greenery Day holiday,
and today's May Day observance kept many European investors
on the sidelines.</p>
<p>Among broader measures, Standard & Poor's 500-Stock Index
went up 1.69 to 330.80, the New York Stock Exchange Composite
Index gained 0.75 to 181.49, and the Dow Jones Equity Market
Index added 1.53 to 308.13.</p>
<p>Selling in the wake of Friday's market retreat, in which
the Dow industrial average tumbled 31.53, sent the average to
a double-digit loss shortly after the opening. In addition,
losers opened up an early lead of more than 2-to-1 over
gainers on the Big Board.</p>
<p>But the market stabilized above its early lows and then
drifted within a narrow trading range through midafternoon,
when the yield on the Treasury's bellwether 30-year bond
dropped below 9% and IBM stock began to attract buyers.</p>
<p>IBM climbed 1 5/8 to 109 in Big Board composite trading of
1.6 million shares. Chairman John F. Akers told the annual
meeting that the company anticipates "substantially improved
financial performance" this year and that restructuring
efforts should lead to an annual savings of $1 billion next
year.</p>
<p>Compaq Computer, during an appearance at a technology
conference in San Francisco, reiterated its forecast of 5% to
10% growth in the U.S. personal-computer market this year.
The firm's stock rose 2 1/8 to 99 1/2. Among other key
technology issues, Digital Equipment added 1 to 83, Cray
Research rose 1/2 to 42 1/2, and Tandem Computers rose 1 1/8
to 25 1/4.</p>
<p>The Treasury's long bond was up about 1/4 point, or $2.50
per $1,000 face amount, in late trading. The yield, which
moves in the opposite direction from the price, stood at
8.99% -- its first retreat below 9% since surpassing that
level Thursday for the first time in almost a year.</p>
<p>Buy programs resulting from stock-index trading
contributed to the late gains in stocks, just as some program
selling had figured in the early decline. In the final hour,
traders sold index-futures contracts and purchased baskets of
stocks in order to profit from price differences between
them. The process had gone the other way at the opening, as
traders bought the futures contracts and sold stocks.</p>
<p>Merrill Lynch, citing its concerns about recent earnings
reports, cut the stock portion of its model portfolio to 35%
from 40% and boosted the cash position to 15% from 10%. The
other 50% of the model portfolio remains in bonds.</p>
<p>Richard Bernstein, director of quantitative research, said
a model which takes current and projected earnings and
dividends into account indicates that stocks are overvalued
at their current price levels by about 20%.</p>
<p>Earnings concerns prompted the portfolio change, he said,
since many companies appear to be suffering from "squeezed
margins" as wages are on the rise. "So far we haven't seen
the ability of companies to pass on" higher wages through
price increases, Mr. Bernstein said.</p>
<p>PepsiCo, whose first-quarter earnings were in line with
analysts' forecasts, rose 1 3/4 to 66 1/4. The company's net
income went up about 10% from a year earlier to $181.9
million, or 68 cents a share. Coca Cola, its key rival in the
soft-drink business, added 1 to 76 1/4.</p>
<p>Boeing added 1 to 69 3/4 after reporting that its
first-quarter earnings from operations jumped nearly 87% from
the year-earlier level. The concern projected a 33% sales
increase in 1990. Also, the company raised its quarterly
dividend by 25% and declared a 3-for-2 stock split.</p>
<p>Nashua rose 7/8 to 40 3/4. The company boosted its
dividend by 20% and said it would begin a Dutch auction offer
later this week for about 30% of its common stock in a price
range of $39 to $44 a share.</p>
<p>Saatchi & Saatchi rose 1/2 to 4 7/8 after PaineWebber
raised its investment rating on the stock to "buy" from
"neutral." Analyst Alan Gottesman told Dow Jones Professional
Investor Report that the stock's price, which has been
steadily falling recently, fully reflects the company's
troubles.</p>
<p>Chase Manhattan placed first on the Big Board's list of
most active issues as a result of trades designed to capture
its next dividend payment. The stock, which has a dividend
yield of 9.8%, finished up 1/8 at 25 3/8 on 1.9 million
shares.</p>
<p>Texas Utilities rose 7/8 to 35 1/8 on 1.1 million shares
in the wake of its first-quarter earnings report. Its net
income rose 44% from a year ago and was on the upper end of
analysts' forecasts.</p>
<p>Gulf States Utilities lost 1/2 to 10 5/8 after Shearson
Lehman Hutton lowered its 1990 earnings estimate to 13 cents
a share from $1. Analyst Edward J. Tirello Jr. told the
investor report that the earlier projection was "out of line
with reality."</p>
<p>Baltimore Bancorp surged 3 1/4 to 15. The company received
a takeover bid of $17 a share from First Maryland Bancorp, a
unit of Allied Irish Banks.</p>
<p>Union Texas Petroleum Holdings climbed 2 5/8 to 20 1/2.
Its board agreed to explore the sale of the company and other
alternatives for boosting the value of the company's shares.</p>
<p>Computer Associates International advanced 1 to 14. As
expected, the company unveiled a software-development
strategy designed to unify the products it has acquired
through a recent takeover binge.</p>
<p>Better-than-expected earnings for the first quarter
boosted the shares of Imperial Chemical Industries, which
added 1 3/4 to 70 5/8. While the company's pretax profit fell
6% from the year-earlier period, analysts had expected a
sharper decline.</p>
<p>Lewis Galoob Toys tumbled 1 1/8 to 7 1/2 after reporting a
loss of 16 cents a share for the quarter. A year earlier, the
company posted net income of 25 cents a share.</p>
<p>Consolidated Freightways rose 3/4 to 17. The company,
which reported a first-quarter loss of $1.06 a share last
week, declared a regular quarterly dividend of 26.5 cents a
share.</p>
<p>The American Stock Exchange Market Value Index rose 0.46
to 343.10. Volume totaled 9,220,520 shares compared with
10,920,000 Friday.</p>
