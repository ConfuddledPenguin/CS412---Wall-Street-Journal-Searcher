	<p class="article-leader">ALBANY, Ga. -- Here in south Georgia, some of the best
investments are made for peanuts.
   Atlanta shopping-center developer John Varner rambles
around the countryside in a pickup, buying up swatches of
timberland and crop land. Total acquisitions: 40,000 acres.
"He's the Donald Trump of farming around here," says one
farmer, adding: "No, he's more like a Howard Hughes. He's
very reclusive."</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>But it is what came with much of the land that made it so
appealing: peanut quotas that amount to a government license
to sell millions of pounds of peanuts a year in the U.S.
market. Says Mr. Varner: "It's an added asset."</p>
<p>Peanut production is nearly a no-lose proposition. Even as
the U.S. faults Japan for protectionism, it maintains a
federal program that limits the number of farmers who can
sell peanuts in the U.S. and all but forbids peanut imports.
What's more, the government not only guarantees that the
quota owners will recoup their production costs each year, it
sees to it that the minimum selling price for their so-called
quota peanuts is about 50% higher than the world market.</p>
<p>The program costs the federal Treasury about $4 million a
year. But critics say the government isn't the only one that
has to shell out.</p>
<p>Who else pays? Every mother feeding her children
peanut-butter sandwiches, say peanut processors, and every
baseball fan munching on ballpark peanuts. One processor
estimate has consumers paying an extra $369 million a year --
a hidden subsidy to quota holders. The Agriculture
Department, using different assumptions, comes up with $190
million a year. Take away the subsidy, processors assert, and
consumers could save as much as 40 cents on an 18-ounce jar
of peanut butter priced at $1.79. Of course, much depends on
whether cost savings would ever get passed on to the
consumer.</p>
<p>But political forces now are building to challenge the
41-year-old peanut program, to the dismay of goober growers.
The Bush administration is pressing Congress to limit the
subsidies, and a coalition of conservative Republicans and
big-city Democrats intends to challenge the program when the
1990 farm bill reaches the floor this spring. Some peanut
processors want to end this quota system altogether. They
object to bureaucrats allotting production quotas each year
-- farm by farm, county by county, state by state --
throughout the Peanut Belt, which stretches from tidewater
Virginia to the New Mexico plateau.</p>
<p>"It's a blatant case of feudalism," asserts James
Hintlian, an Everett, Mass., processor. "It spawns and
protects privilege."</p>
<p>Not so, assert quota holders. It is a well-conceived
program that stabilizes the economy of peanut-growing areas,
maintains "the integrity of the family farm" and assures
consumers an ample supply of nutritious peanut products at
fair prices, says James Earl Mobley, the chairman of a
national peanut-growers group.</p>
<p>No place is more threatened by the political assault than
Early County, Ga., which leads the nation in peanut quotas
with an allocation of 73 million pounds. Planting peanuts has
been a way of life in the county since the 1920s, when cotton
farmers, devastated by the boll weevil, took the advice of
botanist George Washington Carver and tried the lowly legume.</p>
<p>Quota holders, many of them heirs to farmers who got
peanut allotments four decades ago, tend to regard the peanut
program as an entitlement, almost as their birthright. "Why
anyone should attack it, I don't know," says Guy Maddox, with
an unlit Dutch Master between his lips. "The consuming public
wants them cheaper, but it's out of the question. I think the
people here are entitled to make a living."</p>
<p>Peanuts have been good to 88-year-old Mr. Maddox, who, by
his own reckoning, is worth $4.5 million. He has a staff of
servants, a white-columned mansion and control of the biggest
bank in Blakely, the seat of government in Early County. He
used to own a big peanut mill in town, but these days he
sticks to banking. He rents the family quota of 874,000
pounds of peanuts to two grandsons for $70,000 a year.</p>
<p>More than a third of the nation's 44,000 quota owners
don't get their hands dirty farming; they rent their quotas
to farmers who do. Many owners are so-called allotment lords
living in distant cities, such as Greenwich, Conn., and West
Palm Beach, Fla. Says Gilbert Cooley, a Spokane, Wash.,
businessman whose wife inherited a peanut quota on about 35
acres in Oklahoma: "Oil wells would be better, but it isn't
too bad."</p>
<p>The fact isn't lost on investors, either. Miss Brown's
Busy Bee restaurant on the edge of Blakely is often abuzz
with talk of the big money moving in. Fred Wenzel, an
Anheuser-Busch Cos. director and the chairman of St. Louis
apparel maker Kellwood Co., bought the Kolomoki Plantation a
few years ago. That brought him a 1.2 million-pound peanut
quota. Growing peanuts "looks like a better investment than
any other crop you can raise," Mr. Wenzel says.</p>
<p>But Mr. Varner makes him look like small potatoes. The
shopping-center developer says he and his partner, Earl Bass,
own 12 million to 13 million pounds of quotas (worth $4
million according to agribusiness experts). Mr. Varner's
showplace: Wildfair Plantation, a quail-hunting preserve
south of Albany, Ga.</p>
<p>He commutes by private jet from Atlanta to oversee his
rural empire out of a hangar at the Albany airport, his
privacy protected by tight airport security and an
uncommunicative staff. Many perceive him as a city-slicker
bent on cornering the peanut market. The spectacle of 15
Varner-Bass mechanized peanut-pickers rumbling from one farm
to another, followed by a mighty fleet of trucks, can be
intimidating.</p>
<p>"People tell me it looks like a panzer division," says the
39-year-old Mr. Varner, who denies having monopolistic
intentions: "If some other commodity makes more sense, I'm
going to grow it. Peanuts just happen to be the best way to
maximize investment."</p>
<p>While the peanut program has prevented peanut gluts and
propped up quota-holders' income, critics say the success has
come at the cost of stifled industry growth, market
distortions and higher costs to consumers.</p>
<p>U.S. peanut consumption remains flat at 2.2 billion pounds
a year, with the industry barely making enough gains in sales
to offset market-share losses to cheaper snacks like
pretzels. In the meantime, unfettered California almond
growers and Hawaii macadamia-nut growers are expanding to
meet demand.</p>
<p>"We're captives of the program," complains Larry Pryor,
the top purchasing agent for snack-food maker Lance Inc., in
Charlotte, N.C. "We can only buy what's produced for quota,
and we can't really import peanuts." Only 1.7 million pounds
of imports -- a tiny fraction of U.S. consumption -- are
allowed in each year. "That might keep Skippy running for one
afternoon," says James Mack, lobbyist for the Peanut Butter
and Nut Processors Association. "It's a virtual embargo."</p>
<p>The peanut program benefits only peanut farmers who have a
"green card" -- government-issued proof of quota -- to flash
at peanut buyers and shellers. "That's their ticket to
happiness," says Mr. Hintlian, the processor. It entitles the
quota holders to the perks of the peanut program, and it
guarantees them a so-called support price for their crop that
is four times higher than the minimum given to farmers
without quotas.</p>
<p>Under current law, card-carrying farmers qualify for a
support price of $631.47 a ton, more than enough to cover
their average costs of production and ensure a profit of $100
to $200 a ton. If they can't get higher prices, the
government will buy their quota peanuts at that floor price.
If their production costs rise, the government raises the
floor price the next year.</p>
<p>As for the quota-less farmers, they are free to grow
so-called additional peanuts, but only for the lower-priced
export market for edible peanuts or the domestic market for
peanut oil and meal. The result: Foreigners can buy U.S.
peanuts a lot more cheaply than American consumers can.</p>
<p>If the growers of additional peanuts fail to sell their
crop, they must turn it over to the government at $149.75 per
ton -- too little for most quota-less farmers to make a go of
it. So, too, must quota holders who produce peanuts in excess
of their quotas.</p>
<p>The government has what amounts to a peanut-police to keep
people from diverting additional peanuts from their overseas
destinations and passing them off on the U.S. market as more
expensive quota peanuts. In Blakely, Ga., Lamar Lindsey of
Opp, Ala., an inspector for a marketing association deputized
to supervise the peanut program, is on the beat, hovering
over the bagging and shipping of 300 tons of government-owned
additionals at the Birdsong Inc. mill.</p>
<p>"If any of these peanuts move, the government wants to
know about it," the burly Mr. Lindsey shouts over the roar of
forklifts. "I've got to make sure they don't put {additional}
peanuts on a load of quota peanuts."</p>
<p>Critics contend that Congress, in repeatedly reauthorizing
the peanut program over the years, has legitimized cartels.
The right to grow peanuts for the U.S. market is still
limited to just those states and counties that were growing
peanuts in 1949 when allotments were passed out. Thus,
farmers in Maryland and Kansas don't grow peanuts today
because none of their fathers and grandfathers grew them in
the 1940s. And it is still against the rules for a farmer in
Georgia's Early County to sell his quota to a farmer in the
next county.</p>
<p>The law has thus entrenched Georgia, Alabama and Texas as
the dominant producers. About 15,000 Georgia farmers control
1.3 billion pounds of quota, or 41% of the national
allotment. In contrast, only two California farmers have
quotas.</p>
<p>While the Bush administration isn't intent on doing away
with the quota system, it does favor eliminating all
restrictions on the sale and transfer of quotas. The
administration also wants a 20% cut in peanut support prices
to bring them more into line with other subsidized commodity
prices.</p>
<p>The proposals have members of Congress from the Peanut
Belt fuming. At a recent hearing, several lawmakers wondered
why the administration would, as Republican Rep. William
Dickinson of Alabama put it, "want to fool around with a true
success story." Democratic Rep. Charles Rose of North
Carolina, chairman of the tobacco and peanuts subcommittee,
surmised that there must be some Marxist policy-making
"beavers" in the Agriculture Department trying to figure how
to "screw it up."</p>
<p>For these lawmakers and their constituents, few issues are
more important or emotional than protecting the status quo in
peanuts. Thomas "Gene" Miller, a Republican Party leader who
used to grow peanuts in Lumpkin, Ga., joined a 1981 effort to
kill the peanut program outright. For his audacity, he says,
he was "semi-ostracized" by his neighbors, and a suspicious
fire burned his barn.</p>
<p>Peanuts are a cash crop a farmer can count on -- and bank
on. The peanut quota is collateral a farmer can get a loan
with. The quota enhances land values and enriches the tax
base in rural counties. It gives farmers a sense of financial
security.</p>
<p>Says Rep. Bill Grant, a Florida Democrat who spent 20
years in banking before his election: "I foreclosed on a lot
of poor farmers growing corn and soybeans and just about
everything else, but . . . I never foreclosed on a peanut
farm, never, never did."</p>
