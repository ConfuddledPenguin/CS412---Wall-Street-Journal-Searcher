	<p class="article-leader">CHICAGO -- In one of the first regulatory attacks on
alleged abuses involving trades spanning two different
markets, the Chicago Board Options Exchange fined Susquehanna
Investment Group, a prominent program trading firm, $170,000
for alleged abusive trading in the stock and stock options
markets.
   The fine is part of the exchange's crackdown on alleged
intermarket trading abuses. Exchange critics have often
claimed that traders illicitly profit from buying or selling
stock-index options or futures, based on advance knowledge of
large stock trades their firms or customers intend to make.
Such a practice is known as intermarket front-running of
orders.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The Susquehanna fine is among the largest levied against a
CBOE member firm in recent years. Responding to congressional
concern about lax market regulation, the stock and options
exchanges have stepped up their efforts to ferret out
intermarket trading abuses in recent months.</p>
<p>Susquehanna submitted to the exchange findings and
censures without admitting or denying the allegations. But
the Philadelphia-based firm made its "compliance and
supervisory structure more stringent" following the events
cited by the CBOE, said Steve Bloom, a Susquehanna managing
director.</p>
<p>Susquehanna, known for its sophisticated computer-driven
trading strategies, has long been a source of suspicion and
envy on Wall Street. Founded by some former college
classmates about four years ago, the tiny firm consistently
ranks among the top 10 program traders in the New York Stock
Exchange's monthly reports. The firm trades only for its own
account.</p>
<p>A stock-index option is the right to buy (call) or sell
(put) the underlying value of a stock index, such as the
Standard & Poor's 100-stock index, at a specified price
within a certain time period. Stock index options are settled
in cash, rather than by the delivery of the stocks on which
the index is based. The CBOE is the nation's largest options
exchange. Stock-index trading accounts for the majority of
its trading volume.</p>
<p>The CBOE said that on Sept. 16, 1988, a Susquehanna trader
bought 935 stock-index options on the CBOE, while the firm
had already entered orders to buy more than 15 million shares
of stock as part of a program trade tied to the expiration
that afternoon of the CBOE options, which are based on the
Standard & Poor's 100-stock index. The orders to buy the 15
million shares apparently gave Susquehanna a nearly risk-free
profit on the 935 call options.</p>
<p>The CBOE said that the trader wasn't aware of the program
trade, but should have been.</p>
<p>Program trades involve the nearly simultaneous purchase or
sale of stock and stock-index options or futures to profit
from momentary price differences between these markets.</p>
<p>The CBOE fined Susquehanna $75,000 for the Sept. 16, 1988,
trade, which it said violated exchange rules, and fined
Susquehanna an additional $20,000 for the "potential gain"
stemming from the trade. The firm was fined another $5,000
for a trade made by a Susquehanna trader that same day, which
it said also violated exchange rules.</p>
<p>Susquehanna apparently profited on the 935 stock-index
options contracts when the firm's program trade involving the
purchase of more than 15 million shares of stock boosted
stock and stock index option prices in the final minutes of
trading that Friday.</p>
<p>For trades that involved only a single market, Susquehanna
was fined $70,000 for stock-index options trades made
December 13, 1988. The CBOE said that two Susquehanna traders
separately bought and sold the same number of the same
stock-index options for firm accounts "in a matter which
reduced or eliminated the risk otherwise inherent" in making
what are known as "spread" trades between different series of
options contracts.</p>
<p>The traders also failed to report the transaction times
for some of these trades, the CBOE said.</p>
