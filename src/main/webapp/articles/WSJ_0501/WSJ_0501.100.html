	<p class="article-leader">One evening last week, conventioneers from the American
Newspaper Publishers Association attended a Los Angeles
reception next door to the La Brea Tar Pits. That's where you
find fossils of extinct species -- not the best omen for the
owners or managers of the U.S. daily press.
   A sour advertising market was Topic ANPA, related as it is
to declining margins and lower stock prices. But if it were
just another cycle, that wouldn't be so bad. The industry
remains quite profitable and circulation totals are OK.
Rather, what's so bothersome is the progressive dissection of
the customer base by rival media that are able to "segment"
ads in ways general-interest papers don't. That particularly
hurts when growth sectors of the population aren't loyal
readers.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Newspapers want the public to pay them a call. Literally.
The phone is a powerful marketing device and publishers think
they offer a lot of information that would draw "readers"
into 900 lines and such. But as with electronic data
services, a sore spot for years, the broadsheet barons are
bumping heads with the "RBOCs" -- the Regional Bell Operating
Companies. Frank Blethen of the Seattle Times, interviewed
after chairing a panel that touched on the issue, said he and
his fellow publishers would like to team with the phone
companies.</p>
<p>But he alleged Baby Bells are neglecting their rightful
role in order to jockey for position in a market where they
don't belong. The publishers, who have had the federal judge
who runs the U.S. phone system on their side, want a
legislated ban on local Bells going it alone in data.</p>
<p>"Then it becomes clear to an R-BOC that their business is
going to be what they're good at and have always been good
at, and that's transmitting information on their lines,"
offered Mr. Blethen. "When you're dealing with the kind of a
mindset that says we're going to spend millions and millions
of dollars on attorneys, on public relations people and
advertising and on Capitol Hill to get into information
services, then how committed can they be on the operations
and application side when they have customers out there
saying help us get good at this business?"</p>
<p>According to Newsday chief Robert M. Johnson, the
publishers' sentry on the issue, the phone companies' assault
has been turned back in the critical House Telecommunications
Subcommittee. Its staff is drafting a bill basically in line
with ANPA's stance, he said.</p>
<p>If the beef against the Bells is they control nearly all
phone entry in their areas and could dominate electronic
data, wouldn't the same be true of a call-guzzling
information giant like the Seattle Times, which enjoys an
antitrust-exempt joint operating agreement (JOA) with the
other big daily, the Post-Intelligencer?</p>
<p>"Bull]" Mr. Blethen responded. "We have more competition
than we have ever had in Seattle." Thirty years ago, the JOA
partners had about 80% of the ad revenue in the city, he
estimated, whereas today it's 15% to 17%. And instead of
reaching nearly every household, as they did then, their
combined "penetration" has been cut by a third. The JOA, he
maintained, actually has been good for peripheral competitors
because it's made the big two inflexible in responding to the
marketplace. (Does he want out of it? "No," he laughed.)</p>
<p>In fact, Mr. Blethen said, the information-services
question could make or break the paper that has been in his
family's hands for four generations. "The Seattle Times is
one of, if not the, largest independent, private locally
owned newspapers left. We're committeed to staying there.
We're going to go $100 million in debt next year to build a
$175 million printing plant. It's the first debt we've had
since the Depression {when the company sold a 49% stake to
what is now Knight-Ridder Inc. in order to cover loans}. It's
roll your dice. We're betting our company that print's going
to be successful. . . . We feel good about that. The one
thing that could undermine us is something that doesn't make
marketplace sense." By that he means that U.S. West, the
area's Bell regional, might cross-subsidize electronic
challenges with local rate-payer revenues.</p>
<p>Would or could the Baby Bells plunder if they fished the
ponds they stock? Peter Huber, whose 1986 study of the issue
for the Justice Department was widely cited, argues that on a
"short leash" from regulators, the Bells could be kept in
check while allowed out of their cage. Besides, the economics
of an integrated industry discipline even the mighty. As Mr.
Huber put it, "Do you think the phone company could change
the shape of the jacks?"</p>
<p>Atlanta-based Cox Newspapers, a leader in adding call-in
services to its print features, complains that BellSouth has
obstructed it by setting unduly high charges for some
services and withholding available technology while fees are
studied for others. Again, Mr. Huber rose to the defense:
Setting tariffs is a minefield for the phone companies, and
further, what might appear discriminatory pricing against a
newspaper -- say, higher rates for a line that's called
repeatedly -- is really rational and ought to be applied to
all customers.</p>
<p>What likely would occur in an openedup industry is a
version of economist Joseph Schumpeter's technological-change
model, in which the pricing niceties of perfect competition
are disrupted while entrants large and small scramble for
advantage amid innovation. As it is, some argue, innovation
in U.S. telecommunications is held back while other nations
advance.</p>
<p>"That's a bunch of bunk," Mr. Blethen rejoined. "We're not
behind anybody. . . . They've been holding Minitel up for
years as this progressive new service that Americans are
deprived of, and we're finding out that Minitel in many parts
of France is considered a disaster to the government. . . .
The American consumer has more information than any consumer
in the world. Americans are on information overload and
looking for better ways to have that information packaged and
sorted and made to make sense. They're not deprived of
anything right now."</p>
<p>One thing they certainly enjoy is cheap newspapers (even
in JOA towns), when you consider that those same papers are
angling to offer bits and pieces of their daily content over
the phone for a dollar a pop. Why the pulp product for a
pittance? For two reasons, Mr. Blethen explained: "One, to
have a mass market to deliver to advertisers, or a mass
market that they can segment; and two, because most
publishers do altruistically believe that you need to make
that paper available to the maximum number of people you can
possibly get it to." That's a little rich, but Mr. Blethen
said the daily press is "vital to this democracy functioning"
and a bulwark against elitism.</p>
<p>Now the bastion is threatened, if not by the Baby Bells,
then by direct mail and the healthy market in free weeklies
(largely unrepresented at Los Angeles) that localize news and
advertising. Late in the game, the dailies are stirring to
protect their turf. Recall, however, that the dinosaur was a
fearsome force, too.</p>
