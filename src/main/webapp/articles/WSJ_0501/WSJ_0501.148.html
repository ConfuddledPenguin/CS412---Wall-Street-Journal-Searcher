	<p class="article-leader">Aca Joe Inc. said it was sued by licensees, who charged
the clothing retailer with fraud and breach of contract,
among other things.
   The plaintiffs, who filed the suit in federal district
court in San Francisco, said they are seeking $10 million in
compensatory damages and unspecified punitive damages. The
San Francisco company said it was reviewing the complaint. It
declined to comment further.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>In the suit, the plaintiffs, which include four current
licensees and two former licensees, alleged that the company
deceived them by publicly stating its intent to continue
operating a licensed outlet system when, the suit alleges,
the company had decided to switch to wholesale systems. The
suit also alleged that the company failed to ship merchandise
the licensees had ordered and paid for.</p>
<p>Aca Joe, which filed for protection from creditors under
the federal Bankruptcy Code in May 1988, emerged from Chapter
11 last year.</p>
