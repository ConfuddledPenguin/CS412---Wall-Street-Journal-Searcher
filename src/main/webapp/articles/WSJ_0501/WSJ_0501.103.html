	<p class="article-leader">The court of world opinion has accorded Mikhail Gorbachev
a degree of individual responsibility for his nation's future
perhaps not seen since the reign of the Sun King. Similarly,
Mr. Gorbachev's persona may be blinding policy elites to the
real course of events.
   The Bush administration has spent the past several weeks
wrestling with the question of Lithuanian sovereignty. There
now is some prospect that the Lithuanians and Moscow will
work out a compromise of sorts around the idea of
"suspending" independence for two years. If this compromise
is reached, it will be seen as validating the
administration's desire not to do anything that would
jeopardize Mr. Gorbachev and the reforms he represents. But
what about the next Lithuania, or the Lithuania after that?</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Just within the last 48 hours, the Latvian Popular Front
said it had enough support to declare independence when its
parliament convenes this Thursday, the first Soviet congress
of free-trade unions met Monday in Siberia to declare its
opposition to state unions, and the newly formed Ukrainian
Republican Party said it would form the republic's first
noncommunist party with the intention of seceding. The West
may have to turn out the Kohl-Mitterrand compromise as a form
letter.</p>
<p>Perhaps it is time to consider the significance of these
developments. Events are moving so rapidly in the Soviet
Union that Mikhail Gorbachev, once a proponent of the
policies favored by the West, may now be an obstacle to those
policies. At the least, the U.S. ought to be committing
itself to achieving a set of policies inside the Soviet
Union, instead of committing to one man whether he follows
those policies or not.</p>
<p>Mr. Gorbachev is a figure caught in a polarization between
reformers and the old guard. For example, he recently gave a
presidential cabinet appointment to Valentin Rasputin, who
has ties to the intensely nationalistic Pamyat organization.
In the event, Mr. Gorbachev isn't developing any real
constituency in either group.</p>
<p>Why then, in this uncertain and fluid context, do we not
support the people who favor the policies we want? And why do
Western elites seem to be having such difficulty recognizing
the powerful modern forces that are shaping and motivating
these people? It is as if the reformers are living in the age
of telecommunications, while the politicians are living in
the Age of Talleyrand.</p>
<p>Ever since the shipyard workers of Gdansk formed
themselves into Solidarity, the words, actions and beliefs of
democratic reformers in one part of the world have been
transmitted via print, satellite feeds and fax machines to
their counterparts elsewhere. We have seen Lech Walesa and
Vaclav Havel describe the democratic spirit before the U.S.
Congress and a Statue of Liberty erected in Tiananmen Square.
We have read of a Czech brewery worker leaping onto a factory
table to recite Jefferson's Declaration of Independence and
of Latin Americans braving death threats to cast a free vote.</p>
<p>The Lithuanians -- as well as the Ukrainians in Lvov ready
to sign economic agreements with Vilnius -- see themselves as
part of this same democratic force. Like it or not, the U.S.
sits at the center of this maelstrom of courage and change as
a moral anchor, an abiding symbol of what democracy is.</p>
<p>Yes, the practitioners of Realpolitik reply, but Mr.
Gorbachev is the horse who is going to carry us to
significant arms-control agreements, complete a Soviet troop
pullout from Eastern Europe, allow Germany to unify, control
still-dangerous Soviet hardliners, and create opportunities
for the empire's real reformers. With so much headed our way,
they say, why rock the boat?</p>
<p>The problem is that this forces us to deny repeatedly the
damage real events are doing to our own political principles,
such as the consent of the governed. We end up saying that
everything's OK so long as Mr. Gorbachev doesn't use force,
or too much force, while TV screens show him using force
before our eyes. In an information age, how can the
government supposedly supporting democracy publicly deny the
obvious truth?</p>
<p>Do we believe that looking the other way while Mr.
Gorbachev and the KGB's troops cut off Lithuania's economic
lifelines will avoid civil war among a Soviet population that
is a seething time bomb?</p>
<p>Do we really believe that any arms agreements he signs
will bind his successors? Or that they have any real
intention of stepping down from superpower status by
abandoning modernization programs for their strategic forces?</p>
<p>Do we really believe that our forbearance will drive
internal economic reform forward, even now as Mr. Gorbachev
postpones it?</p>
<p>Realpolitik has its uses, but doesn't it have to pay some
heed to the real world?</p>
