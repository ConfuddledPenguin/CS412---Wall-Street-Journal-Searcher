	<p class="article-leader">During recent testing of Busch Cold Filtered Draft beer in
Tulsa, Okla., focus groups preferred a shiny black, gold and
red label and a clear bottle, Anheuser Busch Cos. researchers
say.
   That's probably what they wanted to hear. With that
packaging -- which the company had already adopted for the
test market -- the new brew is almost a dead ringer for
Miller Genuine Draft, the highly successful premium-priced
beer introduced in 1985 by archrival Miller Brewing Co., a
unit of Philip Morris Cos. "It's Miller Genuine Draft in
sheep's clothing," says Emanuel Goldman, an analyst for
PaineWebber Inc. in San Francisco, who notes that this would
be the first Anheuser product in a clear bottle.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Anheuser-Busch says it isn't seeking to ride Miller's
coattails into the draft-beer category. In fact, Anheuser
won't even concede that draft beer is a new category,
maintaining that cold filtering is just a new process for
filtering beer. But industry analysts and consultants say the
market-share war being waged in a flat beer market, combined
with the plateau in sales hit by the company's
once-invincible Budweiser brand, has forced Anheuser-Busch to
pursue the draft market.</p>
<p>"They have to approach cold-filtered beers," says Tom
Pirko, president of Bevmark Inc., a Los Angeles consultant.
"You have to look at every place you can make some headway,
including stealing thunder from competitors."</p>
<p>Anheuser-Busch won't discuss its plans for Busch Cold
Filtered Draft, but it appears the company hopes to catch
lightning in a long-neck the way Miller did with its Genuine
Draft. Introduced in 1985 as a response to Miller High Life's
slumping sales, Genuine Draft topped one million barrels in
sales the following year and hit 4.7 million barrels last
year. That pushed it into the top 10 beer brands, displacing
Anheuser's pricey Michelob.</p>
<p>With the two giants of the beer business squaring off, the
cold-filtered segment holds promise of a hot marketing
battle. Cold-filtered drafts, with their fresher taste and
premium image, appeal to the beer-drinking audience brewers
covet most: males ages 21 to 35, who consume far more beer
than their older bar mates. These younger drinkers have
drifted away from the flagship brands their fathers drink; to
woo them back, brewers are rapidly expanding their menu of
premium offerings.</p>
<p>But chasing this affluent young crowd has its risks. The
new brands could accelerate the decline of flagship beers and
confuse consumers. And, as Adolph Coors Co. discovered,
success can be fleeting if you're not prepared to meet market
demand.</p>
<p>Miller Genuine Draft, the trend setter, owes its success
as much to clever marketing as to a subtle taste difference.
The company's surrealistic advertising campaign, devised by
Backer Spielvogel Bates Inc., New York, conveys the company's
cold-and-fresh message by depicting a beer that can cause
blizzards amid blistering heat. (In one ad, a man pictured on
a billboard under a hot sun grabs a bottle of Miller Genuine
Draft from another billboard, bringing the snow.)</p>
<p>And to the beer-consuming public, the term draft has
always meant fresh-from-the-tap superior beer. (The new
products qualify as draft beers because they aren't
heat-pasteurized.) It didn't prove difficult to transfer that
allegiance from the saloon to the supermarket.</p>
<p>Although it will mean more competition, the new Busch
draft is "the ultimate compliment," says Beverly Jurkowski, a
spokeswoman for Miller. "There's no question" that Busch Cold
Filtered Draft "is a copycat."</p>
<p>Anheuser-Busch's motivation for this mimicry appears as
clear as its new bottle. Budweiser's growth, which continued
unabated for years despite the rise of light beers, imports
and other rivals, finally started leveling off last year.
Although the brewer won't share its numbers, many analysts
see the introduction of Bud Dry and the testing of Busch Cold
Filtered Draft as an indication that Anheuser is accepting
the inevitability of slower Budweiser growth.</p>
<p>"Anheuser is realizing that one {premium} brand can't be
everything for everybody," says Michael Bellas, president of
Beverage Marketing Corp., a market-research firm.</p>
<p>Still, Anheuser doesn't want to cannibalize Budweiser,
still by far the nation's best-selling beer -- which may be
why the brewer chose to use the Busch name rather than Bud
for the new draft. But that carries its own risks: Putting
Busch Cold Filtered Draft in the popular-price category,
Anheuser risks losing some Budweiser drinkers to the
lower-priced brew. Indeed, Anheuser-Busch researchers came
away from the Tulsa focus groups concluding that "we have
something here that looks and acts and tastes like a premium
beer at a popular price," an Anheuser spokesman says.</p>
<p>Though Miller High Life was already in decline,
beer-industry analysts say Miller Genuine Draft attracted
some drinkers from the brand. Anheuser won't talk about its
marketing strategy or possible risks. "Our plans for this
beer are completely open," says the Anheuser spokesman. But
many analysts see the company's use of the Busch label as an
attempt to protect the Budweiser franchise as much as
possible while giving the new label a pricing edge over
Miller Genuine Draft.</p>
<p>If Anheuser decides to stick with the Tulsa focus groups'
preferred packaging, it risks peddling a "me too" product to
which consumers won't respond. But the potential benefits of
such imitating Miller's approach outweigh the risks,
beer-industry specialists say. Anheuser "sees that it seems
to be working for Miller," says Mr. Goldman, the analyst.
"You don't have to reinvent something to benefit from it."</p>
<p>Already, the marketing sniping has begun. In its Tulsa
test, Anheuser has advertised that its new draft is made with
whole hops, not hops extracts like Miller uses. Miller points
out that many beers are made with extracts, including the
much-admired Heineken. Analysts doubt that many drinkers
would care either way.</p>
<p>The sad story in the draft wars belongs to Coors, which
actually hit the market with a premium draft product a year
before Miller Genuine Draft popped its first top. Coors Extra
Gold, a heavier draft beer than Miller's brew, was a quick
success, reaching one million barrels in sales in its first
full year on the market. But the brewery hadn't planned for
such a heady start and ran out of supplies even while
distributors were begging for more, says Vince Ventimiglia, a
Denver-based consultant who was then working at Coors as
manager of distributor economics. Consumers, eager to try the
brand or buy more, were met with empty shelves, and the brand
has never regained its momentum. Coors won't comment on the
brand.</p>
<p>Belatedly, the company attempted to convince young
drinkers that Coors's flagship brand was the "original draft"
by adding that to the label in late 1988. The relabeling
backfired as loyal lifetime Coors drinkers abandoned the
brand, convinced that Coors had changed the formula. Coors
dumped the label later that year after some distributors
complained of a big drop in sales.</p>
<p>Now, it looks as if it will be at least a few months
before the No. 3 brewer can make a concerted draft-beer push
if it wants to. Coors has run out of capacity at its only
brewery and will struggle this year to meet consumer demand
for its fastgrowing Coors Light and its new, popular-priced
Keystone.</p>
<p>Coors recently dropped all mass media marketing for Extra
Gold. The company spent $24.8 million to advertise the brand
in 1989, down 22% from $31.7 million in 1988. The company
won't say why it has pulled its advertising, but a
spokeswoman says Coors is designing a new campaign for Extra
Gold. She declines to say what it will say or when it will
appear. She adds that the company is exploring ways to
increase its capacity.</p>
<p>By the time it does so, however, Miller and Anheuser may
be too entrenched for Coors to make inroads. "They knew they
had the answer before Miller," says Mr. Ventimiglia of his
old company. "But they didn't capitalize on it."</p>
