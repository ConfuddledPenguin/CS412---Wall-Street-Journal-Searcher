	<p class="article-leader">Officials of Elders IXL Ltd. are toasting an alliance with
Asahi Breweries Ltd. of Japan that should make the
Australia-based beer maker a more-formidable competitor on
the world brewing scene.
   Elders's cash-strapped parent, Harlin Holdings Pty.,
announced late Friday that it has arranged to sell 19.9% of
its approximately 55% holding in Elders to Asahi in a cash
transaction valued at 960 million Australian dollars
(US$793.9 million). At A$2.15 a share, it is a substantial
premium to the A$1.56 at which Elders shares closed on Friday
in Australia. In response, investors bid up the stock eight
British pence to the equivalent of A$1.77 later in London
trading.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>For Harlin, a closely held concern associated with Elders
chairman John Elliott, the sale dilutes its stake in Elders,
but eases its financial bind and buys it some time. For
Elders, it takes pressure off the company to dump assets to
raise cash for bailing out its parent and gives the world's
fourth-largest beer maker an entry into Japan. For
fast-growing Asahi, Japan's second-largest brewer, it marks a
bold step toward international expansion.</p>
<p>Best known for its Foster's beer, Elders is in the midst
of a corporate overhaul that calls for the sale of its
interests in natural resources, agribusiness and finance. The
company also is to change its name to Foster's Brewing Group
Ltd.</p>
<p>Harlin is saddled with about A$3 billion of debt incurred
in building its stake in Elders, which is its only asset.
Dividend income from its Elders shares hasn't been enough to
meet interest costs, so Harlin has had to borrow to fund the
shortfall.</p>
<p>Assuming the transaction with Asahi is approved by Asahi's
board, regulators in Australia and Japan, and Harlin's
creditors, Harlin's stake in Elders will be cut to 35% from
about 55% now. Asahi's cash injection will reduce Harlin's
debt, but based on Elders's expected dividend payments,
Harlin still won't be able completely to cover interest
payments on its debt, Baring Securities (Australia) Ltd.
estimates.</p>
<p>Before the Asahi transaction, analysts estimated that
Harlin faced an annual funding shortfall of about A$150
million. With the Asahi transaction, the amount could be
halved at most, they say. Moreover, at A$2.15 a share, Harlin
is showing a per-share loss of at least 15 Australian cents
on the sale because it paid an average of A$2.30 a share for
its 55% stake.</p>
<p>Viktor Shvets, who tracks Elders for Baring Securities,
said that unless Harlin gets a break on its interest bill or
a windfall from Elders in the form of a capital return to
shareholders, the cash-strapped company may have to sell more
of its Elders stake.</p>
<p>Mr. Elliott, however, dismisses that prospect. In a
telephone interview from Melbourne, he said: "There is no
need for us to sell any {more} shares." Indeed, if Harlin
exercises certain options it holds on Elders shares, its
stake could rise to 46% on a fully diluted basis.</p>
<p>Mr. Elliott has been shopping for partners to help relieve
Harlin's financial bind, and there had been widespread
speculation that Molson Cos. of Canada, which has a joint
brewing operation with Elders in Canada and separately owns
about 6% of Harlin, would buy a stake in Elders. But a source
familiar with the situation said the proposed Asahi
transaction "supersedes" discussions with Molson.</p>
<p>In Toronto, Hershell Ezrin, a Molson senior vice
president, said Molson was "delighted" with the Asahi
transaction and its contribution to solving Harlin's
liquidity problems. He also said Molson considers the
proposed move a "plus for Elders."</p>
<p>Among Harlin's biggest bank creditors, analysts said, are
a syndicate led by Hongkong & Shanghai Banking Corp., owed
about A$1.6 billion, and Citibank, owed about A$400 million.
Broken Hill Pty. Co., the giant Australian mining, steel and
oil concern, also is owed about A$880 million in the form of
preference shares that come due in early 1993.</p>
<p>Later this month, Elders is expected to report a loss for
the year ended June 30 stemming from huge write-downs on
investments. Consequently, some analysts expect Elders will
be forced to trim its annual dividend payout, thus
aggravating Harlin's cash troubles. Mr. Elliott declined to
comment.</p>
<p>Asahi is expected to appoint two directors to Elders's
reconstituted board, which will have nine or 10 seats. Harlin
is expected to have three directors on the board. An Asahi
spokesman said both companies may brew each other's beer
under license. Asahi already brews Coors of the U.S. and
Lowenbrau of West Germany under license.</p>
<p>Asahi has been trying to export its Super Dry brand, a hit
in Japan, to other markets, and tying up with Elders will
allow Asahi access to markets in Britain and Canada, as well
as Australia. In Japan, Asahi's sales have been soaring since
Super Dry hit the market three years ago. The company's sales
are expected to reach 750 billion yen ($5.51 billion) this
year, up from 650 billion yen last year.</p>
<p>Still, Asahi's aggressive move into Elders surprised some
industry analysts in Japan. They said Asahi has been short of
cash after stepping up capital expenditures to increase
production capacity.</p>
