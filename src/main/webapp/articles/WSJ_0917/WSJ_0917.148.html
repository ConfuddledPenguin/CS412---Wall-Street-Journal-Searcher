	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- It was not in the stars.
   Hearst Corp. and Burda Publications of West Germany said
they would fold Jupiter, the "upscale" astrology magazine
they jointly published.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Jupiter first appeared on newsstands last December but
sales after two issues were disappointing. As is typical of
Hearst, most new magazines are launched first on newsstands
to see if circulation gradually builds before increasing
publishing frequency.</p>
<p>Jack Heistand, vice president of marketing at Hearst
Magazines, said Hearst and Burda had spent a "modest amount"
on the first two issues, but that Jupiter's "newsstand sales
didn't pass the hurdle rate we set for it." He said the
astrology magazine would probably not be attempted again.</p>
<p>Burda currently publishes a monthly version of Jupiter in
West Germany. Astrology magazines and booklets are among the
best-selling publications at supermarket checkout counters.</p>
<p>Hearst continues to test two other magazines on
newsstands, American Home and Countryside. However, another
new magazine, Auto Times Weekly, has been suspended for one
year, because of what Mr. Heistand called "the current soft
auto market." Auto Times Weekly was a mass-market, weekly
tabloid published jointly by Hearst and Axel Springer Verlag.</p>
