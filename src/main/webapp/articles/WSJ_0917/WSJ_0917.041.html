	<p class="article-leader">DEERFIELD, Ill. -- Premark International Inc. said it will
pay $11.9 million to settle disputes with Weldotron Corp.
concerning food-wrapping machine patents.
   The consumer and restaurant products concern said that in
return for the payment, Weldotron, based in Piscataway, N.J.,
has dropped its lawsuits and has agreed not to attempt to
enforce the patents against Hobart, a Premark subsidiary that
produces a broad line of food equipment including
food-wrapping machines.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Premark said Weldotron sought total damages of more than
$200 million in two lawsuits filed in 1986 in the U.S.
District Court of New Jersey alleging that the unit infringed
on its patents. Hobart countersued, claiming the patents were
invalid and unenforceable.</p>
<p>Premark said it decided to settle the suits to avoid the
uncertainty and additional costs of further litigation. A
spokesman for Premark said that the settlement will have a
financial impact on the company, but that it hasn't
determined if a charge will be necessary.</p>
