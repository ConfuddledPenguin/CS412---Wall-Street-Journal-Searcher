	<p class="article-leader">ELIZABETHTOWN Corp. (Westfield, N.J.) -- Standard & Poor's
Corp. said it lowered its ratings on $152.3 million of this
water utility holding company's debt. The rating concern
downgraded subordinated debt to single-A-minus from single-A,
and the Elizabethtown Water Co. unit's senior unsecured debt
to single-A from single-A-plus. The rating cuts reflect
potentially weaker financial health stemming from an expanded
construction program, S&P said.</p>
