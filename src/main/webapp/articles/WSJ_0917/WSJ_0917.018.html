	<p class="article-leader">It's a matter of simple mathematics, and Boeing Co. is
worried.
   The sheer number of airline flights is increasing faster
than the rate of airliner accidents is decreasing. If that
trend continues, says the world's top builder of passenger
jets, the net effect would be an average of 20 major crashes
a year for all makes of airliners by the middle of the next
decade, up from 15 now.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>That's "hitting critical mass" in terms of negative
publicity, Boeing says, so it has set out to do everything it
can to reduce the number of crashes before travelers are
scared out of their wits. "We're heavily dependent on public
confidence," says Earl Weener, the engineer in charge of
safety at the Seattle giant. "And clearly, the public would
like us to have no accidents."</p>
<p>Perfection is impossible. But Mr. Weener maintains that by
studying the roughly 850 large-scale plane wrecks that have
occurred since the jet age began in the late 1950s, Boeing
has come up with a plan to reduce significantly the number of
airliner accidents and fatalities.</p>
<p>Boeing already has started going public with its findings,
sharing them with the rest of the industry, the media and
lawmakers. In all of these forums, Boeing has insisted that
the means to make flying safer are already available. "We
don't need a lot of new, sexy technology," Mr. Weener says.
Instead, carriers and airports around the globe need to make
investments in safety-enhancing equipment, and airlines need
to train their pilots better, Boeing suggests.</p>
<p>At the same time, Boeing isn't discounting the importance
of correcting its own design deficiencies or assembly-line
miscues, when they arise. "We're not saying it's all the
fault" of airports and pilots, Mr. Weener insists. But he
notes that when there's an identifiable manufacturing problem
that leads to a crash, the Federal Aviation Administration is
mandated to step in and it tends to be fixed relatively
quickly. The problems that Boeing is pointing out, by
contrast, have seemed to sit and fester. "Some of what is
causing accidents is absolutely too predictable," Mr. Weener
says.</p>
<p>Although some in the aviation industry are skeptical that
Boeing's plan will make much of a difference, the reaction to
Boeing's open airing of its concerns has been surprisingly
positive. Even the Air Line Pilots Association has been
supportive. While the union is uneasy with Boeing's
calculations that mistakes by flight crews have caused more
than 72% of the accidents during the past 10 years, the union
praises the company for digging behind the raw statistics, a
compilation of U.S. and foreign government investigative
reports.</p>
<p>"Even though it grates on us to hear `pilot error,' we do
know that what Boeing is doing is right and proper," says
John O'Brien, the union's director of engineering and air
safety.</p>
<p>One tactic in Boeing's plan is to encourage airports
around the world to put in electronic instrument-landing
systems, beams that help guide a plane on its glide path
downward. Looking at its own 737 narrow-body twin-jet, Boeing
says that of 83 major accidents that have occurred since the
plane was introduced in the late 1960s, 40 were during
approach and landing. Many of these could have been averted,
Mr. Weener says, if airport facilities had been using the
gear Boeing is calling for. The system, which has already
been installed at most major U.S. airports, costs about $1
million a runway.</p>
<p>Another tactic that Boeing recommends is the use of
flight-data recorders to review regularly the performance of
aircraft and their flight crews. Although many foreign
carriers use such a setup, U.S. airlines have been inclined
to check such a wide range of information only after a crash,
when the "black box" is recovered.</p>
<p>But now, largely because of Boeing's efforts, domestic
airlines are considering adding to their planes new
sophisticated recorders that can spot troubling patterns
before any damage is done. For instance, a recorder could
alert regulators to the fact that planes landing at a certain
airport are repeatedly descending too rapidly.</p>
<p>"It's our hope that we're going to see in the coming
months one or more of the large carriers decide to go into it
in a big way," says Anthony Broderick, the FAA's chief of
regulation and certification. Mr. Weener says the key is for
airlines to use the recorders strictly to foster safety, not
as tools against pilots who may have gone astray.</p>
<p>The biggest lifesaver, though, could turn out to be a
device that already exists on domestic airliners, but that
has often malfunctioned or been misused. Since 1975, pilots
around the world have unwittingly run aircraft into the
ground 66 times without mechanical failures, bad weather or
air-traffic controller foul-ups. In 44 of those cases, Boeing
says, the planes either didn't have a ground-proximity
warning system or had a faulty one. The system is supposed to
sound an alarm -- "Pull up] Pull up]" it shrieks -- when an
airliner not configured for landing has strayed too close to
the terrain.</p>
<p>Although the device costs only about $30,000 an aircraft
to install -- a minimal expense considering that a wide-body
jet can go for more than $125 million these days -- it's
estimated that two-thirds of all non-U.S. carriers, or about
460 airlines, don't use such systems in their fleets. Even in
the U.S., where Congress has mandated the use of
ground-proximity indicators, Boeing has found that pilots
often ignore the signal; that's exactly what happened in five
of six crashes of this type last year, it says.</p>
<p>Part of the reason is that early-generation warning
systems had a tendency to go off inadvertently, which has
conditioned some cockpit crews to assume a high number of
false alarms. "A lot of pilots just turn them off," says Mr.
Weener.</p>
<p>The solution, he says, is for carriers to make sure they
are using the latest systems, which are much less likely to
be triggered arbitrarily and give a pilot an extra long time
to respond. In addition, Boeing believes that airlines must
teach pilots to take the plane higher immediately, if they
can, and to ask questions later, even if a flight is delayed
as a result.</p>
<p>Not everyone in the industry is convinced that Boeing's
proposals will really do that much good. "Anytime you have
somebody with Boeing's credibility pounding the drum, it's
certain to help," says Rick Davis, director of an aviation
safety program at the University of Southern California. But,
he adds, "getting things done is not always so easy," because
certain airlines will by nature be slow to make changes, and
those in weaker financial condition may not be able to afford
even the slightest safety improvements.</p>
<p>Ken Plunkett, director of research at the Aviation Safety
Institute, a Worthington, Ohio, watchdog organization, also
points out that some mistakes by pilots are inevitable.
"Maybe we're trying to push human beings beyond" what they're
able to do, he suggests.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, Boeing feels that by stirring discussion, it
can -- and will -- make things better. "Traditionally, we
haven't wanted to point the finger," explains Randy
Harrision, the Boeing public relations man on the campaign.
"But it's gotten to the point that if we can't influence
events, it's going to become untenable for everybody."</p>
<p>Boeing may be pointing the finger, but it isn't naming
names, even at meetings attended exclusively by aviation
industry officials. Instead of singling out the carriers with
lousy records, it's calling attention to exemplary airlines,
such as British Airways and Pan American World Airways, when
it comes to the proper use of ground-proximity warning
systems.</p>
<p>"I have not heard anything that would cause us to have
concern" with Boeing's approach, says William W. Hoover,
executive vice president for operations and safety at the Air
Transport Association of America, the carriers' trade group.</p>
<p>In the end, what could have become a nasty display of
bickering and backbiting is quietly emerging into an unusual
show of cooperation and mutual support. "I think more and
more, the industry is realizing what the full cost of an
accident is," says John Enders, president of the Flight
Safety Foundation, a nonprofit Washington group that is
working with all the players to help smooth over the rough
spots.</p>
