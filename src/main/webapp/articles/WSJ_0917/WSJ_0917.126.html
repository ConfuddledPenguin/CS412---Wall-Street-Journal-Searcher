	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- For the first time in years, the major
television networks have their hands full of unsold ad time
in the so-called scatter market for the fourth quarter, a
sign broadcasters aren't going to escape the cutbacks
plaguing other media.
   The scatter market consists of ad time left over from the
"upfront" selling season, the period each summer when
advertisers commit big chunks of money to reserve ad time for
the fall season. Ads in the scatter market, which generally
sell at higher prices, usually get snatched up as soon as the
upfront buying ends. All ad time for the fall season -- both
upfront and scatter -- has historically been locked up by the
end of August.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>But August is long gone, and ad agency media directors are
astounded at the availability of advertising time across the
schedule, including daytime TV, late-night and sports
programming. There is even available ad time on some of the
most-promising and highly rated primetime programs. The
amount of time varies within the schedule of each network,
but most executives say there is still ad time for sale even
in the desirable period just before Christmas.</p>
<p>"It's been a long time since the fourth quarter has been a
buyer's market," says Lou Shultz, executive vice president
and director of media services at Lintas: USA. Adds Gene
DeWitt, president of DeWitt Media in New York: "It's highly
unusual that, at this late date, you can buy almost anything
you want. You can almost drive a truck through the
availabilities."</p>
<p>Mr. DeWitt and other media executives say the ad time
isn't being bought because advertisers are concerned about
their own profitability amid a shaky economy and fears of the
effects of the crisis in the Middle East. "We're seeing
clients commit their ad dollars almost one at a time," Mr.
DeWitt says.</p>
<p>The upfront market this year was expected to be a great
deal healthier than last year, when advertisers committed
about $4.2 billion. This year, however, sales turned out to
be relatively flat, although ABC and Fox Broadcasting Co.,
the News Corp. unit, registered gains at the expense of
rivals NBC and CBS.</p>
<p>Media experts see the ailing scatter market as the latest
in a long string of blows the media business has weathered
this year. Although experts say they have seen countless
advertisers cut their magazine, newspaper and outdoor ad
budgets, a number thought broadcast television, with its
appeal as the preferred medium to reach a vast audience with
one shot, would escape the cuts.</p>
<p>"It's unusual, but I guess it's not all that surprising,"
says Richard Kostyra, executive vice president and director
of media services at J. Walter Thompson. "You read the
headlines these days and you know that everything's being
affected."</p>
<p>Network executives, not surprisingly, aren't too eager to
talk about their high inventories of ad time. H. Weller
"Jake" Keever, executive vice president of sales at ABC, a
unit of Capital Cities/ABC Inc., would say only, "We hope by
mid-November that clients will release their budgets."
Executives close to ABC say the network's October market is
pretty well sold, but that its November and December
schedules are riddled with openings.</p>
<p>Executives at CBS Inc. weren't available for comment. But
at NBC, a unit of General Electric Co., executives confirmed
sales of scatter ad time are off to a slow start there, too.
They blamed the uncertain economy and anxious advertisers for
the sales lag.</p>
<p>"We've had a little bit of a late year," say Larry
Hoffner, executive vice president of network sales at NBC.
"We're hopeful at this point. It's still early for the
mid-November to Christmas push."</p>
<p>But media executives say that, based on previous years'
experience, it is not early. What's more, the executives say
the availabilities in some parts of the schedule are so wide
open that the networks are offering some ads in the scatter
market at the cheaper upfront rates.</p>
<p>"If an advertiser has flexibility, he could cut some very
good deals," says Bill Croasdale, executive vice president
and director of national broadcast at Backer Spielvogel
Bates. "In some isolated cases, you might even be able to
beat the upfront prices."</p>
<p>Scatter prices are traditionally higher than upfront
prices in part because advertisers are penalized for waiting
until late in the selling season to make buys. But the
scatter market is popular among advertisers that don't want
to make a long-term commitment or among those interested in
launching a new product on short notice.</p>
<p>If the price-cutting is good news for advertisers, it's
devastating news for the networks. NBC's Mr. Hoffner, though,
says he believes the market for scatter will still be strong,
if not right away. He says he believes the negotiation
processes in buying ad time have become more complex and have
as a result changed the timing of the ad-selling seasons.</p>
<p>Still, media experts warn that advertisers seeing these
cheaper scatter rates may question their future upfront
buying strategies if the situation continues into next year.</p>
<p>"If the softness continues, advertisers clearly will
reduce their upfront commitment," says Mr. Kostyra of J.
Walter Thompson. The upfront commitments will still be major,
he says, because the networks only offer "guarantees" of the
number of viewers on upfront buys. "But I think advertisers
will retain a larger portion {than they did before} for the
scatter."</p>
