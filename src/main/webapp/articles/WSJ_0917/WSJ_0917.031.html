	<p class="article-leader">FIRST AMERICAN Corp. (Nashville, Tenn.) -- Dana C.
McLendon Jr., president of the specialized banking group of
First American National Bank, resigned, effective in
November. The company has been searching for a new chairman,
and Mr. McLendon said his stepping aside will give that
individual "the flexibility to hand pick his management
team." Like many Tennessee banks, First American has been
suffering from a deteriorating real-estate loan portfolio. In
May, the company dismissed Kenneth L. Roberts, its chairman,
president and chief executive, who was succeeded in the posts
by James F. Smith, formerly vice chairman, until a successor
is found. Mr. McLendon, 47 years old, joined the company in
1988.</p>
