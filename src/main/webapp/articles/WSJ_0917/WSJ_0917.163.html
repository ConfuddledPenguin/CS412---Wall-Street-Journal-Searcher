	<p class="article-leader">BOSTON -- Digital Equipment stock plummeted 2 7/8 Friday
to 56 3/8, its lowest point since 1985, but few analysts are
willing to bet it has hit bottom.
   On the surface, there is much to recommend the world's
second biggest computer maker at these levels. After all,
many analysts were boosting the stock in May when it hit a
12-month high of 95. Digital is likely to survive any
industry shakeout. It has about $17 a share in cash, a
sterling balance sheet and a current price far below the
$66-a-share book value long seen as a floor for the stock.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>But with a deteriorating economy hurting sales world-wide
and a huge work force being pared only slowly, Digital's
outlook remains somber. Analysts slashed earnings estimates
last week. For the fiscal first quarter, ending Sept. 30,
many expect Digital to incur its second consecutive quarterly
loss.</p>
<p>Moreover, there is growing doubt that Digital will
initiate cash dividends at its November annual meeting.
Digital's president and founder, Kenneth H. Olsen, indicated
last year that he had dropped his 33-year opposition to
paying dividends. A dividend would allow purchase of the
shares by institutions that are prohibited from buying stocks
without dividends. But now the chances of a dividend are
"very slim," says Jay P. Stevens of Dean Witter Reynolds, who
was bullish on the stock most of the year.</p>
<p>Analyst John Adams of Adams Harkness & Hill notes that
Digital is pushing employees to leave under a voluntary
severance plan; he thinks a dividend is unlikely when
employees are being asked for sacrifices. Citing Digital's
reluctance to breach its no-layoff tradition, he says, "you
have to empathize with Ken Olsen. He is virtually the only
industrial saint around."</p>
<p>Analysts expect Digital to start a new stock buy-back
program soon to bolster the shares. In April it began a
five-million-share buy-back for 4.1% of its stock.
Institutional traders said Digital finished that buy-back
last week, perhaps contributing to the stock's decline.</p>
<p>Patricia Laupheimer at Shearson Lehman Brothers cut her
profit estimate last Monday after a Digital spokesman
"described 75% to 80% of their markets as sluggish." She
notes that some big, slow-growth computer stocks currently
trade at multiples of 10 or less times earnings while Digital
remains above that level, compared with Street estimates.</p>
<p>For fiscal 1991, ending June 30, many analysts have cut
their estimates to $4 to $5 a share from a mean $6.22
estimate a few weeks ago. Last year's share earnings were
only 59 cents after a big restructuring charge, down from
$8.45 the year before. "The problem is you don't know what
earnings are going to be," says Steven Milunovich of First
Boston. "In the near term, there's not a lot of reason to be
optimistic."</p>
<p>Many investors remain disenchanted by Digital's
cost-cutting efforts. Last spring the Maynard, Mass., company
began its first voluntary severance program with employment
at a record 125,800 persons. By next June, officials have
said, employment will be down to about 119,000.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, analysts say Digital remains overstaffed
compared with competitors. Stephen Smith, a PaineWebber
analyst who recommends the stock long term, calculates that
if Digital's overhead and research and development levels
were similar to International Business Machines Corp., the
world's largest computer maker, and Hewlett-Packard Co.,
"that would add $8 a share to earnings. They hired too many
people in the boom days."</p>
<p>John Levinson of Goldman Sachs, who has been bearish on
Digital and other makers of midrange computers for years,
says that its $103,000 revenue per employee, a measure of
productivity, is less than half that of Sun Microsystems, the
leader in the workstation market that Digital is trying to
crack. "I believe DEC has many more restructuring costs
ahead," he says.</p>
<p>Skittish as most analysts are about Digital, they sound
like wild-eyed optimists compared with Marc Schulman of UBS
Securities. A longtime Digital watcher, he was recommending
the stock two months ago because he predicted accelerating
earnings momentum. Now he thinks the company will have a net
loss of $1 a share in the current quarter and only break even
for the full year because of weak revenue.</p>
<p>Mr. Schulman thinks Digital may have a 1% revenue decline
from last year's $12.94 billion, even though the new VAX 9000
mainframe computer may add $1 billion in sales. Last year's
paltry 1.6% revenue gain came when the U.S. economy was
"muddling along" and Europe was strong, he says. Today, "the
U.S. economy is worse than before. The European economy is
worse than before and the degree to which users are willing
to buy minicomputers is worse than before."</p>
