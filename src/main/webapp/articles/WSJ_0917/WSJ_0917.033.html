	<p class="article-leader">LOS ANGELES -- RCM Technologies Inc. expects to become
profitable as it changes from primarily being a provider of
services to a provider of technology, Robert Sackett,
chairman and chief executive officer, said.
   In the meantime, the company reported a loss of $88,598
for the fiscal third quarter ended July 31, compared with a
loss of $149,913 a year earlier. Revenue rose 16% to $7.1
million from $6.1 million.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Mr. Sackett predicted that revenue for all of fiscal 1990
will exceed $28 million, compared with $22.7 million in
fiscal 1989. He said the company expected a full-year loss of
less than $400,000, compared with a loss of $774,166, or six
cents a share, in fiscal 1989.</p>
<p>The executive said RCM expects to become profitable in
fiscal 1991 because of sales of a new technology that has
cost the company about $600,000 to $700,000 a year to
develop, but which hasn't yet generated any revenue. RCM's
revenue currently comes from providing engineering, technical
and temporary services through its Intertec Design unit to
such companies as Dow Chemical Co., Boeing Co. and United
Technologies Corp. RCM is lessening its exposure to the
aerospace industry component of this business, adding that
United Technologies' Sikorsky unit has already been affected
by defense-spending cuts.</p>
<p>But Mr. Sackett said he believes the company's new
technology, its System 99, which is designed to remove
pollutants from power plants and factories that burn
high-sulphur coal, could create revenue of $600 million to
$700 million a year within 10 years. The technology, which
customers could use to comply with pending acid-rain
legislation, currently is being considered by several
coal-fired utilities in the Midwest, Mr. Sackett said.</p>
<p>The company recently reached agreement with a unit of CBI
Industries Inc. under which CBI would do the construction
work on all System 99s that are ordered.</p>
<p>"We're not that credible yet," Mr. Sackett acknowledged.
"CBI gives us credibility in the marketplace." Each order for
System 99 would be worth about $20 million to $30 million to
the partners, he added, and CBI is big enough to handle the
more than 20 jobs a year it would take for RCM to reach its
eventual revenue projections. Just one order, Mr. Sackett
said, would make RCM profitable.</p>
<p>RCM says its System 99 removes more than 90% of pollutants
created by burning such coal, including sulfur oxides and
nitrous oxides, without leaving mass quantities of sludge
that can pollute groundwater. There also isn't any need to
pump large quantities of water since it's a dry system.</p>
<p>RCM operates a commercial-size demonstration facility in
Camden, N.J.</p>
