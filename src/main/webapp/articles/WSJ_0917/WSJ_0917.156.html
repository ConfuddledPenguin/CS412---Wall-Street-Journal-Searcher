	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- The government has begun paying record
export subsidies to boost U.S. grain sales overseas, but most
analysts say it still won't be enough to shore up sagging
wheat markets.
   The Agriculture Department is going to unprecedented
lengths to counter the competitive challenge of the European
Community at a time of bumper grain crops, swelling
stockpiles and shrinking import demand. For the first time,
so-called export bonuses under the government's Export
Enhancement Program topped $50 a ton last week as Agriculture
Department officials sought to match lavish export subsidies
being offered by the French and other European exporters --
and to protect U.S. market share.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"You're looking at record levels," said one official. "I
think we're well into new territory."</p>
<p>The department, partly in response to political pressure
from the Wheat Belt to do whatever it can to prop up wheat
prices, subsidized the sale of more than 500,000 tons of
wheat last week. Export bonuses on a 100,000-ton sale of hard
red winter wheat to Tunisia averaged a whopping $49.23 a ton,
while bonuses on a 12,000-ton wheat sale to West African
nations averaged a record $54.01 a ton.</p>
<p>Under the Export Enhancement Program, exporters sell U.S.
wheat and other commodities at the world-market price and
collect bonuses in the form of surplus, government-owned
commodities. The bonuses make up the difference between
higher U.S. prices and the world-market prices.</p>
<p>But several commodity analysts said such bursts of small-
and medium-sized sales will give the depressed futures
markets only a short-term psychological boost. Some faulted
the Agriculture Department for not making aggressive use of
export bonuses sooner.</p>
<p>"They were very slow in waking up to the fact that it's a
buyer's market," said Katharina Zimmer, a Merrill Lynch
analyst in New York. "They're now doing what they should have
done long ago."</p>
<p>Until recently, added Anne Frick, a Prudential-Bache
Securities analyst in New York, the bonuses "haven't been
large enough to compete with the EC."</p>
<p>The gloomy consensus is that it will take a big sale to
shore up the wheat market, and none appears to be imminent.</p>
<p>"If we did make a relatively large sale -- one million or
two million tons -- that would trigger a rally of 20 cents a
bushel," said Ms. Zimmer. "The price would fall back some,
but it would put a floor under the market."</p>
<p>This fall, the Soviet Union is expected to resume buying
grain in large quantities. The Soviets have expressed
interest in obtaining $2 billion in U.S. credit, and the Bush
administration has indicated a willingness to extend
export-credit guarantees. Technically, the Soviet Union is
eligible for credit, but the administration has taken the
political stance that Moscow must liberalize Soviet
immigration law to qualify for most-favored-nation status.</p>
<p>Most analysts believe credit won't be forthcoming for at
least one month, and there isn't any guarantee the Soviets
will use it for wheat purchases. Ms. Zimmer said, "They're
already looking at a lovely wheat crop." Instead, they may be
more interested in buying corn and soybean meal as well as
certain processed foods that would help mollify disgruntled
consumers.</p>
<p>Lately, the Soviets "haven't been buying anything except
ready-to-eat items that they need to avoid revolution or
anarchy," said John Schnittker, a Washington-based
agricultural consultant. Two such items: chicken legs and
cigarettes.</p>
<p>The prospect of bumper crops throughout the Northern
Hemisphere and the loss of the Iraqi market due to the
Persian Gulf crisis have battered wheat prices. But
department officials take sharp issue with criticism that
they have "used the EEP program very meekly."</p>
<p>"We have had {export} initiatives out there," said a
senior official. "It's more a factor of good crops and lower
buying." He said he expects the latest batch of subsidized
sales to be "very beneficial to the export picture at a time
when there hasn't been all that much export activity."</p>
<p>Meanwhile, a farm-policy showdown is shaping up between
the Bush administration and lawmakers from grain-growing
states. Rep. Dan Glickman, chairman of a House Agriculture
subcommittee, intends to hold hearings, beginning today, on
the possibility of using export bonuses to boost the sale of
wheat flour and other processed foods, and on how much land
wheat farmers should take out of production in 1991.</p>
<p>The Senate has adopted a bill requiring farmers to idle
15% of their wheat acreage. Mr. Glickman (D., Kan.) has
proposed a similar measure, but it would give farmers the
option of collecting payments for idling an additional 5%.
The administration has consistently opposed acreage
reductions of this size, arguing that they encourage farmers
overseas to plant more.</p>
<p>Prudential-Bache's Ms. Frick, said that a 15% reduction,
if enacted, "would give the market a slight short-term boost;
it wouldn't fix the problem."</p>
<p>Looking ahead to other commodity markets this week:</p>
<p>Precious Metals</p>
<p>Gold prices firmed slightly Friday on heightened Persian
Gulf tensions; the nervousness is expected to continue this
week.</p>
<p>Traders bought contracts after it was reported that Iraqi
soldiers had broken into a number of foreign embassies in
Kuwait City and that a U.S. naval vessel fired a warning shot
before boarding an Iraqi ship.</p>
<p>December gold rose only $2.20 an ounce to $391; while
silver and platinum declined. The lack of significant
response to the Middle Eastern developments was due to
traders' ambivalence, one analyst said.</p>
<p>"There have been a number of weekends when traders have
gone away expecting that fighting would break out in the
Persian Gulf and it hasn't," he said. "This has made for
Monday price declines."</p>
<p>On the other hand, he noted, the situation is explosive
and any developments are likely to boost prices rather than
weaken them. That's why a moderate demand for gold futures
contracts developed, he said. A major factor hampering a
strong rally, he added, is the lack of demand for gold
bullion.</p>
<p>Energy</p>
<p>Headline-driven oil markets got a flurry of new headlines
over the weekend as war in the Persian Gulf seemed more
imminent than ever. The United Nations security council
unanimously condemned Iraq's raids against French, Canadian,
Dutch, and Belgian embassy compounds in Kuwait. President
Bush appeared on Iraqi television to say that country stands
"on the brink of war" because of its Aug. 2 invasion of
Kuwait.</p>
<p>In response, the Iraqis called the U.S. leader a liar and
vowed to fight him and his allies, many of whom increased
military and financial support of the U.S. stand against Iraq
following the embassy assaults. Secretary of State James
Baker returned to Washington after raising some $14 billion
for use in the Middle East crisis.</p>
<p>The heightened Gulf tensions will doubtlessly continue to
push crude oil futures skyward, as they have for the past six
weeks. Trading early in the week should reveal whether a
recent slackening in petroleum product futures prices is
continuing. Some traders had attributed the weakness to
technical factors, but others took note of recent reports
from the U.S. Energy Department and the American Petroleum
Institute that showed increases in petroleum product
inventories. The weekly report from the API, due tomorrow,
will be scrutinized for more evidence that product stocks are
growing.
</p>
<p>Livestock and Meats</p>
<p>A surge in hog and pork belly futures prices last week
makes analysts optimistic about pork's prospects this week,
with strong cash prices for pork likely to continue to
support futures prices. Analysts said cash prices rose
because of competitive bidding among meatpackers for supplies
for slaughter. A larger-than-expected movement of pork
bellies out of cold storage also exerted upward pressure on
prices.</p>
<p>Also affecting the market last week were rumblings that
the U.S. may be planning a food aid package to the Soviet
Union, and analysts said such speculation may remain in the
market this week. "Traders are trying to make something out
of the meeting between President Bush and {Soviet President
Mikhail} Gorbachev," one analyst said. "Personally, I think
they had other things to talk about than food aid."</p>
