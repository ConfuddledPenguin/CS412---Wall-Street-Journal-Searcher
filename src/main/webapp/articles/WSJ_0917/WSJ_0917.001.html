	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- On the political right, no one attacks the
big-spending ways of Washington with greater force than Rep.
Newt Gingrich. "Congress is a sicker and sicker institution
in an imperial capital that wallows in the American people's
tax money," he said in a speech last month.
   But his voting record sometimes as often tells a different
story. When it comes to matters that are important to Mr.
Gingrich's home state of Georgia, such as farm subsidies and
trade protection for textiles, he is quick to shed his image
as Mr. Free Enterprise.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>In July, Mr. Gingrich voted against an amendment that
would have reduced sugar price supports that cost U.S.
consumers as much as $3 billion a year, by some estimates. He
also recently opposed an amendment that would have denied
crop subsidies to farmers with gross adjusted incomes of more
than $100,000 a year and a second that would have tightened
loopholes that permit widespread avoidance of limits on
farm-income subsidies.</p>
<p>Mr. Gingrich sometimes even supports farm programs, such
as the sugar program, that don't much benefit Georgia
directly along with a coalition that draws support from other
lawmakers for programs that are helpful to his state.
Textile-state lawmakers long have formed an informal
coalition with farm-state lawmakers, with each side
supporting the other's special legislation.</p>
<p>Despite his own preference for free markets, Mr. Gingrich
also is a co-sponsor of a textile trade-protection bill that
President Bush has threatened to veto. "Newt and I understand
intellectually that free trade is the way to go," says Sen.
Trent Lott (R., Miss.), who once held Mr. Gingrich's current
position as the No. 2 Republican in the House. But in both
their states, he says, protecting textiles means protecting
jobs.</p>
<p>"It may be inconsistent," Sen. Lott concedes. "But very
few of us are 100% pure."</p>
<p>"If you were to try to find a conservative who always
disregards the interests of his constituents," adds Rep.
Mickey Edwards (R., Okla.), "you'd have to look real hard."</p>
<p>Still, the tightfisted American Taxpayers Union gave Mr.
Gingrich a score of only 46% for last year, which is lower
than the 50% average for all House Republicans. The higher
the score, the less money a congressman voted to spend.</p>
<p>Mr. Gingrich defends his voting record and his philosophy.
"It's a pragmatic, mixed bag," he says. But then again, he
adds, "I'm a pragmatic free-enterpriser." Referring to a
basic book on free markets, he says, "I'm one of the few
people in Congress who has read Adam Smith's `The Wealth of
Nations,' which is much more pragmatic that the occasional
quotes would indicate."</p>
<p>He denies that he's part of a coalition of textile and
farm state lawmakers, and says he voted to sustain the sugar
program because "as it's currently run, it's reasonable,"
especially in a market in which sugar is dumped at below cost
by competing nations. The amendment to limit payments to
high-income farmers, he says, was technically unworkable. The
amendment to close loopholes, he adds, was unfit for Midwest
grain farmers; he voted instead for a provision that clamped
down less rigorously.</p>
<p>Rep. Gingrich acknowledges that his support for the
textile bill is "partly for home state interests." But his
general view is that the U.S. has to be "tougher" as a
negotiator in order to persuade competitors to open their
markets to U.S. goods.</p>
<p>In fact, Mr. Gingrich's record includes many votes that
are consistent with his rhetoric. Even among the farm-subsidy
battles this year, he voted against one amendment that would
have fattened dairy subsidies, and also supported an
administration-backed plan to lower loan rates for wheat and
feed grains to encourage internationally competitive pricing.
Mr. Gingrich this year also voted for almost all of the
amendments that would have cut appropriations bills.</p>
<p>Democrats love to take shots at the partisan Mr. Gingrich,
and any disparity between his rhetoric and his voting record
becomes a target. "Nobody minds doing deals, that's part of
the process of governance. But to claim you're above it is a
level of hypocrisy that he has risen to with unerring
frequency," says Rep. Thomas Downey (D., N.Y.), author of the
anti-sugar subsidy amendment. He refers to Mr. Gingrich's
legislative group, the Conservative Opportunity Society, as
the Photo Opportunity Society.</p>
<p>Rep. Charles Schumer (D., N.Y.), co-author of the farm
amendment designed to limit payments to rich farmers,
expressed some surprise at Mr. Gingrich's vote against his
proposal. "The vote doesn't square with what I would think
would be his general philosophical beliefs," he says with
some glee. "I guess for Newt, as well as everybody else, all
politics is local."</p>
<p>But Republicans also know that Mr. Gingrich isn't as
ideological as his rhetoric might imply. "My impression is
that Newt is more conventional than I am with respect to the
question of bringing home the bacon," says Rep. Richard Armey
(R., Texas), co-author of the farm amendment with Rep.
Schumer. "He's always been more of a practical politician
than I."</p>
