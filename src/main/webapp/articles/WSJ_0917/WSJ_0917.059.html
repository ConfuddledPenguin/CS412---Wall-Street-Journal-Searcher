	<p class="article-leader">JOHANNESBURG, South Africa -- Sasol Ltd., South Africa's
oil-from-coal producer, dismissed 2,000 striking workers from
its Sigma colliery near Sasolburg.
   A company spokesman said the strikers had failed to
respond to management's return-to-work deadline Thursday
afternoon. The dismissed workers were striking over wage
demands. The company said the dismissed workers were given
one week to reapply for employment. Sasol plans to recruit
new workers if this deadline isn't met.</p>
