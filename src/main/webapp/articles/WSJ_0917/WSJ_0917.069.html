	<p class="article-leader">TOKYO -- Investment bankers trying to raise $100 million
in fresh capital for Chase Manhattan Corp. are colliding with
a flood of fund-raising efforts by Japanese banks.
   The U.S. bank holding company is trying to privately place
$100 million in subordinated debt with Japanese leasing
companies, people familiar with the effort said.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Jayme Garcia Dos Santos, Chase Manhattan Bank's senior
vice president in Tokyo, confirmed that an investment bank
"has offered to raise the money for the {Chase Manhattan}
corporation." A report on the capital-raising effort appeared
in Friday's American Banker. Mr. Garcia said the investment
firm, identified by others as CS First Boston Inc., had been
"sounding the market to make a firm proposal."</p>
<p>Officials at CS First Boston could not be reached for
comment.</p>
<p>At least one leasing company initially was interested in
putting up the money and bankers said the company was hoping
to sell the paper to other leasing companies.</p>
<p>But the other companies apparently showed less enthusiasm
for the deal because it comes in the midst of a huge rush by
Japanese banks to place subordinated debt of their own. "It's
not a hot prospect," one U.S. banker said.</p>
<p>All international banks are facing pressure to bolster
their capital bases by March 1993, when new international
regulations come into effect requiring banks to maintain
capital roughly equivalent to 8% of their assets. For Chase,
new capital would help it expand beyond that level, since it
currently has a 9.02% ratio.</p>
<p>Until this year, a booming stock market and a booming,
cash-spinning economy made raising capital an easy task for
Japanese banks. The stock market has since fallen sharply,
though, not only removing a major source of funds from the
banks but wiping out much of the capital they held in the
form of stock.</p>
<p>As a result, big Japanese banks have been looking
elsewhere for capital. Since July, nearly a dozen banks
either have planned or completed large issues of subordinated
loans.</p>
<p>Subordinated debt pays higher interest rates than straight
loans and, because it gives its creditors last claim in a
bankruptcy, it can be counted under international standards
as capital.</p>
<p>Japan's life-insurance and leasing companies have been
buying most of the paper. But their appetite for it is
waning, and one banker said he would be "extremely surprised"
if CS First Boston is able to place subordinated debt for an
American bank such as Chase.</p>
<p>Chase is finding subordinated paper difficult to arrange.
Another subordinated issue by the bank group in the U.S.
recently was repriced to yield more than 13%, up sharply from
its original yield of 9.66%.</p>
