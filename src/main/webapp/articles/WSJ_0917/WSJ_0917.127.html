	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- The Pentagon is recommending arms sales to
Saudi Arabia that could eventually total as much as $20
billion, a Bush administration official said.
   The official stressed, however, these military sales
essentially are in two distinct categories: those that answer
Saudi Arabia's immediate security needs and those that would
help safeguard its long-term interests.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The official rejected the notion that this was a single
transaction. "It isn't one big package," and he stressed that
"the size of some sales will depend on how the situation (in
the Persian Gulf) unfolds."</p>
<p>Since Iraq's Aug. 2 seizure of Kuwait, the U.S. has so far
agreed to sell Saudi Arabia 24 F-15 jet fighters at a cost of
about $2.3 billion. These are expected to come out of U.S.
inventory and should be delivered quite quickly, the
administration official said.</p>
<p>Future sales to Saudi Arabia are expected to include such
items as Apache helicopters, M-1 tanks, Bradley Fighting
Vehicles, Stinger anti-aircraft missiles and Patriot air
defense systems.</p>
<p>In Jerusalem, Israeli officials reacted with concern to
the prospects of a large U.S. arms sale to the Saudis. "We
object to this kind of arms deal and find it a threat," said
one official. The potential volume, number and sophistication
of the weapons under consideration could "affect the
qualitative edge" the Israeli forces rely on to deter an Arab
attack.</p>
