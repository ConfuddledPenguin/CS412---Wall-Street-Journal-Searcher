	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- J. Richard Zecher is returning full time to
his post as chairman of Chase Investor Management Corp., the
money management unit of Chase Manhattan Corp., the bank is
expected to announce today.
   Since late last year, the 50-year-old Mr. Zecher also had
been in charge of global risk management activities for the
bank.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Mr. Zecher, who holds a doctorate in economics, said he
agreed at that time to take on the task of pulling together
Chase's various risk management activities in such areas as
foreign exchange, commodities and sophisticated hedging
instruments for corporate clients, as long as the post wasn't
permanent. Risk management involves both trading for the
bank's own account as well as devising hedging programs for
customers seeking protection from volatility in financial and
commodity markets.</p>
<p>"We had those in several different administrative parts of
the bank and we wanted them pulled together," said Mr.
Zecher. "But I didn't want to do that permanently so I
retained my chairmanship at CIMC and I'm returning there full
time now. It's a business I helped create and it's doing very
well." Chase Investor Management manages approximately $33.5
billion for pension funds and other institutional clients.</p>
<p>Mr. Zecher said Mark B. Grier, 38 years old, currently
head of financial management for Chase's retail operations,
will succeed him as the bank's global risk management
executive. Mr. Grier previously was chief financial officer
at Lincoln First Bank in Rochester when Chase acquired that
bank.</p>
