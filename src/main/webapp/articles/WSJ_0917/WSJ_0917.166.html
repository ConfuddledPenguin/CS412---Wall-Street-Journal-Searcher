	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- The head of the American Insurance
Association told a House subcommittee that the state
insurance regulatory system may be unable to handle the
problem of insurance company insolvencies in the future.
   "The limitations of 50 separate entities attempting to
regulate a business that often operates in a national or
international arena may necessitate some federal
involvement," Robert E. Vagley, president of the trade group
for property and casualty insurance companies, told the House
Energy and Commerce Committee panel.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The hearing was held in connection with the subcommittee's
investigation of insurance company insolvencies.</p>
<p>Mr. Vagley said the AIA is considering several proposals
to complement state insurance regulations, including federal
minimum standards and the creation of a self-regulatory
organization.</p>
<p>The trade group official said the most serious problem
connected with state regulation of insurance companies "is
the lack of will on the part of state regulators to take
action against troubled insurers."</p>
<p>He added, however, that the insurance insolvencies
detailed in a February report by the oversight subcommittee
"were not representative of the thousands of well-managed
companies that characterize the property-casualty insurance
industry."</p>
<p>Mr. Vagley also objected to comparisons between the
insurance industry's problems and the thrift crisis.</p>
<p>"Whereas regulation of the savings and loan industry was
liberalized to permit operations to become more risky,
regulators of the insurance industry have enacted stricter
solvency standards over the past decade," Mr. Vagley said.
"Having said that, it is important to note that insurance
regulation for solvency can and should be improved," he said.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Rep. John Dingell (D., Mich.), chairman of the
subcommittee, repeated his call for more stringent regulation
of the insurance industry, warning that it could be headed
for "a solvency crisis rivaling the savings and loan
debacle."</p>
<p>Mr. Dingell said the panel's investigation shows that the
current system for preventing insurance insolvency "is
failing to meet the needs of the public and the insurance
industry in several crucial areas."</p>
<p>"Our goal is to combine the industry's expertise with the
appropriate governmental authority to see that proper
solvency regulation is implemented before a national crisis
develops," Mr. Dingell said.</p>
