	<p class="article-leader">Your Aug. 20 editorial "The Black Man's Burden" should
more appropriately have been titled "A Thorn in the White
Man's Side."
   The Rev. Al Sharpton, in my opinion, acts and speaks to
the frustrations, injustices and double standards imposed on
all African-Americans in their daily pursuit of liberty,
equality and happiness.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>What is puzzling is that the only black person you could
find to "trash" Mr. Sharpton is a politician from Maryland
who obviously is trying to ingratiate himself with the white
community.</p>
<p>We African-Americans need more giants like attorneys Alton
Maddox and C. Vernon Mason. Your journalistic garbage
condemning them won't change that. A new day is finally on
the horizon.</p>
