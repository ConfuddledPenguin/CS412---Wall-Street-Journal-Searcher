	<p class="article-leader">HIGHLAND PARK, Mich. -- When R.S. Miller Jr., vice
chairman of Chrysler Corp., addressed a dinner meeting of
company managers a couple of years ago, he concluded by
inviting questions from the floor. The first to raise a hand
was Mr. Miller's wife, Maggie, who had accompanied him to the
event. Would Mr. Miller run Chrysler differently, she asked,
if he were chairman instead of Lee Iacocca?
   The question startled Mr. Miller, but he quickly
recovered. His first move, he replied, would be to bar
spouses from corporate meetings. The group broke up in
laughter.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Nowadays, though, the question isn't so funny. Lots of
people, both inside and outside Chrysler, wonder how the
company would be doing without Mr. Iacocca. That's because
Chrysler is doing so badly with him.</p>
<p>Mr. Iacocca vows to stay the course and lead Chrysler out
of its problems. But with remarkable candor, he concedes that
he is to blame for many of the company's woes. "I'm
confessing my sins here," declares Mr. Iacocca, who turns 66
next month.</p>
<p>The confessional is Mr. Iacocca's office, crammed with 44
years of mementos that include the checks with which Chrysler
repaid its bail-out loans and a stuffed toy replica of Mr.
Iacocca driving a car while puffing a cigar. In two hours of
stream-of-consciousness monologue on his couch, he darts from
topic to topic: trade with Japan, the federal deficit, and
his attempt, in the twilight of his career, to forge Comeback
II.</p>
<p>His big sin, Mr. Iacocca says, was trying to diversify.
His decision put the company into the aerospace and defense
businesses, but siphoned management attention and money from
the crucial task of producing new vehicles. Now Chrysler has
sold, or is trying to sell, those businesses. Meanwhile, it
hasn't brought to market a single new car whose development
was begun after Mr. Iacocca arrived in 1978. Chrysler's
current lineup still derives from the decade-old K-car.</p>
<p>Along with diversification came a top-heavy holding
company structure that sent Chrysler's costs soaring. The
company must now sell 1.9 million cars and trucks a year just
to break even. That's far above the break-even point of 1.1
million vehicles in 1985 and a much bigger increase than can
be justified by Chrysler's 1987 purchase of American Motors
Corp.</p>
<p>What's more, fewer customers are buying. Chrysler's car
and truck sales have plunged nearly 17% this year, even
though industrywide sales are down just 5%. The company is
likely to wind up 1990 as No. 5 in U.S. car sales, behind
Toyota Motor Corp. and Honda Motor Co. as well as its two
bigger U.S. rivals.</p>
<p>The price of Chrysler's stock has dipped so low (it closed
Friday at $12, down 12 1/2 cents) that the nation's
eighth-largest industrial company now theoretically could be
bought for about $2.8 billion. No other company among the
nation's 10 largest in sales and revenue is valued by its
stock price at less than $16.8 billion.</p>
<p>When a Chrysler factory in St. Louis closes next spring as
scheduled, the company will have shuttered one-third of its
assembly plants in three years. The chief executive of one
big auto-parts maker predicts that Chrysler will lose its
independence "no later than the first half of this decade."
Chrysler is discussing joint product development with Italy's
Fiat S.p.A., Mr. Iacocca says, but he adds it's far from
certain that merger talks will follow.</p>
<p>In fairness to Mr. Iacocca, say his admirers, his wish to
diversify was understandable. Chrysler is being sorely
pressed by Japanese competition, which notably doesn't exist
in the aerospace and defense businesses. General Motors Corp.
and Ford Motor Co. made similar moves. Ford, like Chrysler,
is selling those businesses, though GM is sticking with them.</p>
<p>"If I made a mistake it was following other companies, and
maybe those were grandiose schemes," says Mr. Iacocca. "We
didn't need a holding company. That's what made us
top-heavy."</p>
<p>The company also erred in launching an expensive, and now
defunct, effort to develop a luxury coupe with Italy's
Maserati S.p.A., he admits. Another error, he adds, was
transferring production -- an expensive process -- of the
Omni/Horizon models to a former American Motors plant in
Kenosha, Wis., and then closing the plant just 15 months
later.</p>
<p>"If we went astray -- you know people do go astray now and
then in many areas -- man, we got focused in a hurry," says
Mr. Iacocca. "I've been through crises, and I know them. And
I'm not afraid of them." Today's focus, he says, is on
cutting costs and bringing new vehicles to market. But both
are daunting tasks.</p>
<p>With Chrysler now close to achieving its goal of cutting
$1.5 billion in costs over 15 months, Mr. Iacocca recently
raised the goal to $2.5 billion by next June 30. For a
managerial force that has already endured layoffs,
elimination of bonuses and even cancellation of company-paid
subscriptions, it's like being sentenced to a second winter
at Valley Forge.</p>
<p>While the recent departure of several top executives,
including heir apparent Gerald Greenwald, got lots of
attention, cost cutting has contributed to a more disturbing
trend: an exodus from upper middle management. A group of
engineers specializing in tailpipe emissions recently left en
masse for Ford. Another top engineer returned to teaching. A
high-level marketing man took a post at one of Ford's ad
agencies. In the first quarter, turnover of so-called
bonus-eligible employees hit three times the normal level,
though it has since subsided.</p>
<p>As for new vehicles, one that consumers won't see is the
"mini-minivan." It was originally slated for introduction
late last year, but the project was canceled because there
wasn't enough money for it.</p>
<p>Chrysler does have some attractive new vehicles in the
pipeline. The ZJ, a rounded, modern-looking four-door Jeep,
is scheduled for introduction in early 1992. The LH, a family
of sleek mid-sized sedans, will go on sale in the fall of
that year. Originally, however, those sedans were supposed to
be hitting the market now.</p>
<p>Innovative and attractive products are what saved Chrysler
in the early 1980s; a paucity of them is what has hurt the
company recently. Douglas Fraser, retired president of the
United Auto Workers union, former Chrysler director and
professed admirer of Mr. Iacocca, puts it bluntly: "Lee has
got to start weaning the company from himself. The company
has got to get more product-oriented, and less Lee Iacocca
oriented."</p>
<p>It would have been unthinkable for anyone to say that five
years ago. Back then, Mr. Iacocca had just engineered one of
the great corporate comebacks, selling Chrysler's cause to
government officials in Washington, and then selling its cars
(through television commercials) to the American public.
Chrysler's stock soared from $3 a share in 1981 to $80,
adjusted for splits, in 1987. Mr. Iacocca's autobiography
soared as well, to the top of the best-seller lists. He got
rich and became a folk hero, the CEO for the common man.</p>
<p>Mr. Iacocca headed the Statue of Liberty renovation,
joined a congressional commission on budget reduction and
wrote a second book. He began a syndicated newspaper column,
bought an Italian villa where he started bottling his own
wine and olive oil, and went through a brief and bitter
second marriage and divorce. Critics contend it all
distracted him, and was a root cause of Chrysler's current
problems.</p>
<p>But Mr. Iacocca counters, "I never worked harder in my
life than in the last couple of years. What happened in '85
and '86? You had a little bit of sloughing off, maybe in the
whole organization. But now the bullets are real.</p>
<p>"If you ever pick a distraction, pick the right one," he
adds. "We shouldn't have had forays in the defense business.
But don't blame things on the Statue of Liberty or on writing
a book. That's like saying, `Well, what do you do with your
nights?' Well, that's none of your business."</p>
<p>Distracting or not, it's clear that being a folk hero is a
demanding sideline. Mr. Iacocca recently appeared on a
television special, "Mary Hart Presents," and will soon be
featured in a two-part series on public television. Also, the
January issue of Playboy will include a lengthy interview
with him. Already, Chrysler headquarters is getting calls of
complaint.</p>
<p>Of course, Mr. Iacocca's celebrity does sell cars for
Chrysler -- or at least it used to. Recent ads, in which he
heralds a survey showing Americans prefer Chrysler cars to
Hondas, may have backfired. "People think the ads are
ridiculous, just on their face," says Mr. Fraser. "Lee had
such tremendous credibility with the American people, and the
Honda ads threaten that."</p>
<p>Mr. Iacocca is running into a credibility problem inside
Chrysler as well, managers say. To address it, six months ago
he began holding internal "town hall" meetings, each with 175
employees randomly selected by computer. "I talk for five
minutes, and then they get an hour and a half to knock my
head in," he says.</p>
<p>Some question Mr. Iacocca's decision to spend more than $1
billion, twice the amount originally planned, on a new
technical center (and possible new headquarters) 30 miles
north of Detroit. Inside the company the building is
nicknamed the "Taj Mahal." And, at least privately, some are
second-guessing Mr. Iacocca's biggest move of all, the
purchase of AMC.</p>
<p>Certainly American Motors has brought Chrysler some huge
benefits. The biggest, by far, is Jeep, one of the best-known
brand names in the world. Until now, the Jeep Cherokee has
had the booming market for four-door sport-utility vehicles
virtually to itself -- a gold mine for Chrysler. Last spring,
however, Ford launched its own four-door -- the more modern,
and less expensive, Explorer. Cherokee sales are running 22%
behind last year.</p>
<p>Moreover, as part of the acquisition, Chrysler got locked
into devoting its most modern factory to building a car that
it simply can't sell. The car, the Premier, is a mid-sized
sedan developed for American Motors by its controlling
shareholder, Renault S.A. of France. To protect its
investment, Renault insisted that Chrysler agree to build the
car, which is assembled at the former American Motors' plant
in Bramalea, Ont.</p>
<p>Chrysler made the car part of its new Jeep-Eagle
franchise, hoping the Jeep brand name would provide a halo.
But the Eagle brand, and particularly the Premier model, have
flopped. Sales of the car are so slow that the Bramalea plant
is operating at only about 18% of capacity, about one-fourth
the level required to break even. Compounding the disaster,
Chrysler also may have to pay Renault more than $100 million
in penalties because it is building far fewer Premiers than
the merger agreement required.</p>
<p>Mr. Iacocca, though, expresses no regrets about American
Motors. "I take the long view," he says. "Bramalea is a great
plant. In total we've had a field day with Jeeps. We've made
a lot of money with them." He concedes, however, that "Eagle
isn't a household word; that's going to be a long haul."</p>
<p>The key to getting enough new products for Eagle and the
other brands may be enlisting foreign auto makers as partners
-- perhaps even persuading one to buy Chrysler in part or in
whole. Chrysler is talking to several car makers about joint
product development. The most intriguing talks are with Fiat,
say analysts, because they have the best chance of producing
a permanent linkup.</p>
<p>Will anything come of the discussions? "I don't know, I
can't answer that," Mr. Iacocca replies. "It's the old story,
they want to see how well we're doing. So they say, `Well,
wait a year.' But then we get better and nobody can buy any
equity in us because we want too much for it."</p>
<p>In any case, he adds, Chrysler doesn't need a cash
infusion just now, even though first-half earnings plunged
64% to $251 million and the third quarter will produce a
substantial loss. The company has about $4.5 billion in cash
or equivalents. Mr. Iacocca notes that even if that cash pile
shrinks by $750 million a year, Chrysler will still have a $3
billion cushion when its new mid-sized cars appear.</p>
<p>Besides finding a partner, Mr. Iacocca also must select a
successor. The two candidates are Robert A. Lutz, age 58 and
president of Chrysler Motors, and Vice Chairman Miller, age
48. The two men could hardly be more different.</p>
<p>Mr. Lutz, a cigar-puffing former Marine Corps jet pilot
and former executive vice president at Ford, is the
consummate "car guy." He's the driving force behind the Dodge
Viper, a 10-cylinder sports car that will zoom from zero to
100 miles an hour in less than 10 seconds and will be
introduced in early 1992.</p>
<p>Mr. Lutz, however, is also a self-confessed "very strong
personality," whose style at Ford prompted one underling, the
highly regarded president of Ford of Europe, to quit abruptly
in 1984. At Chrysler, he has offended some old hands by
giving top product-development jobs to former American Motors
officials.</p>
<p>Mr. Miller, in contrast, has a thoughtful, soft-spoken
manner and a quick, dry wit. In Chrysler's crisis of the
early 1980s, he was the point man in negotiating with
hundreds of banks -- any of which could have thrust Chrysler
into bankruptcy. But Mr. Miller is a career-long finance man,
and thus lacks Mr. Lutz's broad experience in
product-development and operations.</p>
<p>"I think either one of them would be a good guy," Mr.
Iacocca says. "I'll watch the two of them for the next 12
months and make a decision."</p>
<p>Does this mean Mr. Iacocca will step down shortly after
that? His contract expires at the end of 1991. Mr. Iacocca
has agreed to stay longer but isn't saying how long, probably
because he doesn't know himself. Friends and associates say
he loves the perquisites of power -- the bodyguards, the
limelight, the corporate Gulfstream jet. And clearly, the
folk hero doesn't want to go out a loser.</p>
<p>"I want to make sure that things are squared away," he
says. At the town hall meetings, he outlines Chrysler's
internal goals for sales, market share and earnings. Then he
tells his troops: "The sooner you can get there, the sooner
you get me out of here. I don't know if that's an incentive
or a disincentive, but please don't take too damn long,
because I want to get out."</p>
