	<p class="article-leader">THE U.S. IS EXPORTING more gasoline, even as debate
continues over the adequacy of the nation's future petroleum

and tight wholesale supplies in the coming months. Those
factors in turn could create new policy problems for the
federal government.

past Friday's strike deadline. The union's move marked only
