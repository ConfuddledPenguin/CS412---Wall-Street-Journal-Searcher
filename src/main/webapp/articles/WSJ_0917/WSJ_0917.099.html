	<p class="article-leader">CHICAGO -- Aon Corp.'s $840 million bid for Corroon &
Black Corp. last week surprised a lot of people. It shouldn't
have, say those who know Aon's chairman, Patrick G. Ryan.
   "The history of Pat Ryan has been a series of
acquisitions," says Donald P. Jacobs, dean of Northwestern
University's Kellogg School of Management and an admirer of
the insurance executive who started his own car-insurance
agency with only a secretary and now runs a multinational
company with $9 billion in assets.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Moreover, Mr. Ryan isn't reluctant to chase bigger fish.
Corroon & Black, an insurance broker with twice the business
of Aon's brokerage unit, was weighing a bid from Willis Faber
PLC of London, when Aon countered with its all-cash offer.</p>
<p>If successful -- Corroon hasn't yet indicated its druthers
-- Mr. Ryan would achieve a business combination he admits to
having long "fantasized" about. Together, Aon's Rollins
Burdick Hunter Group unit and Corroon would become the
world's fourth-largest insurance brokerage, with annual
revenue approaching $1 billion.</p>
<p>Although he calls such a marriage "a perfect fit," Mr.
Ryan conceded in an interview that "frankly, I didn't think
there'd be a possibility. But when we realized that Corroon
said they were willing to look at alternative offers, we
decided to look more carefully. Their size catapults us to
the level of involvement in this business that puts us many
years ahead of schedule."</p>
<p>In the past, Aon and Corroon have been rivals not only in
competing for clients but also in seeking other companies to
buy. "When we bought Rollins Burdick we knew Corroon was
anxious to acquire it," Mr. Ryan said. "We missed out on the
opportunity to acquire three or four other excellent
brokerage firms we had identified as good fits and which
instead went with Corroon."</p>
<p>Some analysts initially frowned at Aon's all-cash offer,
contending that many Corroon shareholders would prefer Willis
Faber's stock proposal because of capital-gains tax
considerations. But a source close to Aon says many of
Corroon's holders are tax-exempt funds, and notes that
Corroon's stock had fallen in price before Aon's bid, thus
reducing potential tax liabilities for others.</p>
<p>Corroon closed last Friday at $36.125, off 12.5 cents for
the day but up $5.25 for the week. Aon closed at $32.625, up
75 cents for the day and down $2.50 for the week. Both stocks
trade on the New York Stock Exchange.</p>
<p>Mr. Ryan insists he's not interested in a fight over
Corroon -- "we're not hostile people" -- but colleagues,
noting Mr. Ryan's background is risk analysis, say they
wouldn't bet against him. "If there's going to be a fight, he
has a very high probability of winning," says Peter Crist,
managing partner of a Chicago executive search firm, Russell
Reynolds Associates.</p>
<p>Aon's chief executive officer also is poker-faced. Even as
Aon was going after Corroon, its 53-year-old silver-haired
CEO hosted a two-hour luncheon of Chicago's blue-chip
Economic Club without disclosing his inner excitement. "I was
sitting there wondering how many phone calls were waiting for
me back at the office," Mr. Ryan now admits, but one of those
attending the luncheon says "he didn't even blink."</p>
<p>Cool calculation is a Ryan trademark, one that has made
him among this city's wealthiest executives, sought after as
a director by both corporations and charities -- his boards
include First Chicago Corp., Commonwealth Edison Co. and the
Field Museum of Natural History, and viewed on Wall Street as
an innovator in what's often regarded as a staid industry.</p>
<p>Mr. Ryan's business holdings also include a 20% interest
in the Chicago Bears football team, which he recently
acquired with another businessman.</p>
<p>The son of a Wisconsin Ford dealer, Mr. Ryan got into the
insurance business after graduating from Northwestern, where
he played football and earned a degree in business. He
pioneered the idea of credit insurance for car buyers making
installment payments and parlayed that concept into a
multilined company, Ryan Insurance Group, that in 1982 merged
with what was then called Combined International Corp.</p>
<p>At the time Combined, the province of W. Clement Stone,
the colorful, cigar-smoking motivational dynamo, was in need
not only of a successor to Mr. Stone but of a growth stimulus
as well. Mr. Ryan agreed to sell out to the much larger
Combined for a 13% equity position and a promise that he
would come in as chief.</p>
<p>Changing the company's name to Aon, Gaelic for "oneness,"
Mr. Ryan soon set about ending what one analyst calls
Combined's "Stone Age." He slashed costs, thinned management
and continued his strategy of growth through internal
expansion and acquisition. In 1982 Aon added Rollins Burdick
Hunter. Four years later it bought Life Insurance Co. of
Virginia for $557 million.</p>
<p>When Mr. Ryan's tenure began, Combined's annual net income
was $81.7 million, or $2.80 a share, with $2.4 billion in
assets. Last year Aon reported net income of $232.4 million,
or $3.54 a share, and assets of $9.1 billion.</p>
<p>Because he is Aon's largest shareholder, Mr. Ryan is "much
more bottom-line and profit-oriented than most insurance
executives," says Prudential-Bache Securities analyst Herbert
Goodfriend.</p>
<p>Indeed. Mr. Ryan's 8.7 million shares brought him
$11,938,152 in dividend income last year, dwarfing his salary
and bonus package of $789,292, according to Aon's proxy
statement.</p>
