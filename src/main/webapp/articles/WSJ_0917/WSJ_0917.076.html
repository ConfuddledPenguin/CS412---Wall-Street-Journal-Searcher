	<p class="article-leader">KENOVA, W.Va. -- Frances Cisco never used to fear anyone
in this small town. That changed in June as she drove along a
dark road with her 22-year-old daughter.
   Suddenly, a black car raced up alongside them, trying
twice to force them off the road. "I was afraid he was going
to shoot us," says Mrs. Cisco.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Finally, the black car veered off into a deserted parking
lot. Mrs. Cisco circled back, got the license plate number,
reported it to police -- and then decided to drop the matter.
"I didn't want to cause any more strife in the community than
there was already," she says.</p>
<p>The focus of the tension is Ashland Oil Inc.'s refinery in
Catlettsburg, Ky., just across the Big Sandy River from this
town of about 4,000. The refinery, looking like a giant
Erector set with hissing pipes and smoky stacks, has been a
smelly fixture in the valley since the 1920s. It refines
about 2% of the nation's gasoline and is the region's biggest
employer.</p>
<p>But in May, four area residents won a $10.3 million
nuisance judgment against Ashland after presenting evidence
that its soot had stripped paint off cars, corroded aluminum
siding and ruined family picnics. It was one of several such
suits filed against Ashland in various regional courts asking
some $3 billion in damages.</p>
<p>The suits, and especially the stunning victory, have split
families, friends and even churches, turning a community
where the hottest topic used to be high-school football into
an ugly battleground.</p>
<p>On one side are company supporters who fear a loss of
jobs; on the other are residents concerned about health in
the valley. Following the judgment, one resident hung a metal
sign along a thoroughfare proclaiming the town's support for
Ashland.</p>
<p>Pearl Vonderheide, whose limbs are covered with itchy
sores she claims stem from Ashland's pollution, demanded that
the sign be removed. The mayor intervened and had it taken
down. Now it decorates the supporter's front porch.</p>
<p>"This is like a civil war," declares Diana Bowen, who says
her involvement in a suit against Ashland has strained her
marriage. Her husband fears that the repercussions could cost
him his job as a laborer in nearby Ceredo. Says Dave Peyton,
a local columnist: "It's a war of words, and it's done more
damage than the court decision. It's a sore that won't heal."</p>
<p>Ashland has fueled the tensions, broadly hinting that the
verdict, if upheld on appeal, could prompt area industry to
pull up stakes. "Any company that has smoke or odor is liable
for a lawsuit," says Albert Parnell, outside counsel for the
company, which employs about 1,800 people at the refinery. He
says nuisance laws weren't intended to provide people with
smokeless and odorless environments.</p>
<p>Some litigants have received harassing and threatening
phone calls. Cars and trucks parked outside their homes have
been vandalized. Many, like Mrs. Cisco, complain that they
have been snooped on, snubbed at local stores and gatherings
and threatened. Her incident with the black car occurred as
she returned from videotaping emissions at the refinery.</p>
<p>A Kentucky air-quality investigator, whose deposition was
used in the recent trial, found a note on his car after a
family outing warning that a bomb might be inside.</p>
<p>Scores of businesses have sided with Ashland. "Most people
feel the judgment was unfair," says Bob Clyse, a car dealer
in nearby Ironton, Ohio. "Ashland is critical to our area for
employment."</p>
<p>Ashland supporters have begun wearing bright red T-shirts
emblazoned with "I support Ashland." They've also waved signs
at rallies that say "Poor Health? See a doctor, not a
lawyer]"</p>
<p>For years, residents lived peacefully with each other --
and pollution -- in Kenova, whose main street includes a
barbershop, pizzeria, post office, funeral home and a few
other stores. Many here have roots dating back generations,
and few ever thought of living elsewhere.</p>
<p>The area is surrounded by industry, ranging from an
Aristech Chemical Corp. facility to a coke plant operated by
Armco Steel. Railroad cars rumble through town, blanketing
streets with coal dust. On the waterfront, Ashland barges
spit forth fumes as they take on oil for their treks up and
down the Ohio River.</p>
<p>As a child growing up in Kenova, Mrs. Cisco recalls that
townsfolk often joked that they wouldn't suffer from creaky
joints in old age: The oil seemed so omnipresent, sprayed on
the streets or squeezed out of wash hung outdoors, that
they'd be well lubricated.</p>
<p>Complaints about the refinery soot started surfacing in
1983. That's when Ashland began processing cheaper, smellier
crude oil with higher contents of sulfur and trace metals.
The company then added special equipment to increase the
amount of gasoline that could be extracted from such crude.</p>
<p>But the equipment, which Ashland claims is unique in the
domestic oil refining industry and was partly supposed to
filter emissions, had lots of operating problems. Among other
things, the vacuum cleaner-like bags constantly ripped.
Ashland insisted that the dust was harmless.</p>
<p>Ashland Chairman John R. Hall has said that the refinery
had emission problems in the past, but that such emissions
wouldn't hurt anyone's health. In a 1989 speech, he tried to
demonstrate the safety of the powder residents say makes them
sick. He not only spread some of the gritty brown substance
on his forehead, he also dipped his fingers into a bottle and
tasted it in front of about 100 people. "We do not believe
our operations are adversely affecting the health of any
individual," he said.</p>
<p>However, during the jury trial in county court in
Charleston, a chemist with the West Virginia air pollution
control commission testified that his tests showed the soot
was nearly as potent as Drano and could burn skin, corrode
metal and pit glass.</p>
<p>It took Ashland until nearly 1988 to correct the problem
with its insufficient filtering. Kentucky air pollution
authorities also say citations against the refinery have
piled up since 1987; Ashland and the state are trying to
negotiate a settlement.</p>
<p>"I want to reassure the community that our refinery is
operating safely and in compliance with all government
regulations," Mr. Hall said in a speech after the jury
verdict.</p>
<p>The residents' lawsuit has led to deep family divisions.
Ronald Walker and his sister, Barbara Christian, haven't
spoken since her family filed a $24 million suit against
Ashland in October 1988. "I don't agree with her decision on
the suit," says Mr. Walker. The operator of a Kenova moving
company, he has instructed his own employees who have suits
against Ashland to avoid going into the homes of Ashland
employees. "I don't want to cause any friction," he says.</p>
<p>Mrs. Christian, 46, says she's deeply hurt because her
brother hasn't looked at materials she has collected in
support of the family's suit, much less inquired about the
health of one of her sons. Now 18, the boy was once
hospitalized for four days with metals poisoning, which Mrs.
Christian says was due to refinery emissions.</p>
<p>In February 1989, the boy's doctor said the family should
leave Kenova because of his health problems. They moved to
Huntington, six miles away.</p>
<p>Mr. Walker admits that he didn't ask about her boy. "He's
been sick off and on for years," he says. "If it was a major
problem, he didn't show it." He also says he doesn't believe
that anyone's health or property has been hurt by refinery
soot. Kenova once was plagued by coal dust, he says. "We
learned to live with it. It was part of the community."</p>
<p>The suits against Ashland, he says, are "get-rich schemes.
They're a ticket to the lottery. Once they get the money
they'll heal real fast."</p>
<p>Many residents were shocked that the suit resulted in such
a hefty award. At least 80% of households in the town earn
less than $30,000 a year, and half make less than $20,000.
Donald Fuller, who was awarded $2.8 million by the Charleston
jury, was barraged with nasty phone calls, including one
death threat that he tape-recorded for police. Other callers
accused him of being on welfare.</p>
<p>Mr. Fuller, who is 57 years old and has worked at the
refinery for 14 years, says he hasn't flaunted his new
wealth. The cash award is still only on paper anyway, he
says. "I'm a carpenter and go to work every day and come home
filthy. I'm just a working man."</p>
<p>His litigation spawned a bitter feud with his brother,
Jerry, who lives next door and has worked at the refinery for
24 years. The brothers and members of their own families
rarely speak to one another.</p>
<p>Jerry Fuller says he has been embarrassed by his brother's
suit. "You don't know what I've gone through because of my
brother," he says. "If Ashland loses, several thousand people
will be out of a job. That's all I'm worried about, and my
own future."</p>
<p>He says he doesn't believe the allegations against Ashland
because he has never suffered any burns while mowing his
grass or ailments from eating vegetables from his garden.</p>
<p>Jerry Fuller says that he and his wife have been harassed
by neighbors who also are battling with Ashland. He says
neighbors have put up "No Trespassing" signs on both sides of
his property.</p>
<p>On the other side of the fence, Eloise Fuller, Donald's
wife, says of Jerry, "I stay in the house because of
pollution and him."</p>
<p>Some area communities have passed resolutions endorsing
Ashland as a good corporate citizen. But when Kenova Mayor
Frank Heck recently pushed one through, a town council
meeting nearly erupted into fisticuffs. Floyd Sowards,
father-in-law of a woman awarded $2.8 million, suggested that
Mr. Heck was biased because his son works at Ashland. The
mayor's reply: "Thank God my son works for Ashland Oil
instead of trying to steal from them."</p>
<p>Mr. Sowards, who says some people have called him a
"redneck radical," says the mayor had police escort him from
the meeting. In protest, a number of others in the audience
got up to leave. "The mayor came running down after me. The
police stood between us to keep us apart," Mr. Sowards says.</p>
<p>For his part, Mr. Heck says he doesn't see anything wrong
with benefiting from Ashland's largess. The company recently
donated two used vehicles to the town's police department,
erected a new press box at a community facility and provided
$10,000 to clean up the town dump.</p>
<p>Some area residents simply don't speak to neighbors for
fear of stirring up the pot. Beady Phillips, 70, recently got
a letter suggesting that he'll leave his wife and run off
with someone else if he ever collects on his suit against
Ashland. He says he shuns possible friendships these days.
"If you're friendly with someone, the first thing you know is
that they find out you're on a lawsuit and they work for
Ashland Oil and then things get mean," Mr. Phillips says.</p>
<p>Adds Wilma Lawson, who says her seven-year-old son has
been taunted and pushed in mud puddles because of her
involvement in a suit against Ashland: "I'm really afraid
there's going to be bloodshed before it's all over."</p>
