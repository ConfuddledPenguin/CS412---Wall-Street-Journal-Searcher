	<p class="article-leader">LONDON -- The Soviet Union is importing gasoline for the
first time in at least eight years, European oil-industry
sources said. The move coincides with other efforts by Moscow
to import goods in short supply, including billions of
cigarettes from the U.S.
   One oil-industry official said that it was difficult to
tell how much gasoline the Soviet Union was acquiring, but
that he had heard estimates it bought as much as 500,000 tons
so far this month from suppliers throughout Western Europe.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The industry sources said the purchases might result from
problems in the Soviet refining industry, or from cutbacks in
imported crude oil. One official said Soviet imports of
Libyan oil may have fallen sharply lately, depriving Soviet
refineries of a key feedstock. It wasn't clear if Moscow
would continue buying gasoline.</p>
