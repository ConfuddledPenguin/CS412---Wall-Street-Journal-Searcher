	<p class="article-leader">TORONTO -- Olympia & York Developments Ltd. said it is
negotiating long-term project financing for its Canary Wharf
real estate development in London, which eventually is
expected to cost about #4 billion ($7.53 billion).
   An Olympia & York spokesman said two separate project
financings were under negotiation. He declined to describe
their size or possible terms. He said they wouldn't be used
to reduce the company's #500 million equity stake in the
project.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Canary Wharf is an office project meant to be the
centerpiece of the world's biggest property development, the
commercial-residential Docklands redevelopment.</p>
<p>Olympia & York so far has sunk more than #1 billion into
Canary Wharf, which still isn't finished. The spokesman said
the loans under negotiation would be the first project
financings for the development.</p>
<p>Developers normally fund the early stages of a development
with short-term construction loans, then refinance that debt
with longer-term loans that are secured by the project
itself.</p>
<p>Such project loans may be further guaranteed by the
developer, or may be nonrecourse loans without such
guarantees. The spokesman declined to describe the degree of
exposure that Olympia & York might have under the proposed
financings.</p>
<p>Canary Wharf has had trouble attracting tenants, which
could pose financial uncertainty for Olympia & York, which is
owned by Toronto's Reichmann family. A first phase of 4.3
million square feet is to open next year, but only about half
the space has been rented.</p>
<p>The Olympia & York spokesman said the company remains
firmly committed to the project. He said its #500 million
equity investment "will remain in place at least until the
project is entirely completed."</p>
