	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- The government wants to alter roughly 200
controversial thrift sales that bestowed about $4.2 billion
in tax benefits on wealthy buyers in 1988, but it's unlikely
the cash-strapped savings and loan cleanup agency can take
action any time soon.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Moreover, financier Ronald Perelman, who struck the
sweetest deal with $1.8 billion in tax benefits alone, also
secured the most ironclad transaction, with fewest government
options within the contract to reduce costs.</p>
<p>For more than six hours Friday, former S&L regulators
defended the sales before the House Banking Committee, saying
that the sales, conducted in an atmosphere of urgency in late
1988 before tax benefits were to expire, were the best they
could do in dire circumstances.</p>
<p>Hundreds of thrifts were insolvent, and the S&L insurance
fund was broke. To attract buyers for the institutions, the
regulators gave them high-interest bearing notes and other
assistance to compensate for the money-losing assets in the
sick thrifts. "When you have an imposed deadline, no cash and
doubtful credit, you are going to pay through the nose," said
William Seidman, the head of the Resolution Trust Corp.,
which runs the S&L cleanup. "I would say the real question is
whether they should have undertaken the transactions at all."</p>
<p>Now, regulators are combing through the agreements,
looking for ways to reduce costs without breaking the
contracts. Such options include paying off the notes, or
buying the thrift assets and managing them at lower costs.</p>
<p>Mr. Seidman said that a study of the 1988 thrift deals by
the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. will be released
tomorrow, but that he expects final costs to have risen to
$54 billion on a present value basis from $39 billion,
because of poor assumptions by the thrift regulators, as well
as declining values in real estate held by the thrifts. A
House Banking Committee study pegged the costs at $71
billion.</p>
<p>Exercising those options requires huge piles of cash, up
front. Hence, Larry White, a former thrift regulator who
helped structure the deals, projected that the government
could save $6.4 billion over eight years by prepaying the
notes alone. But the RTC doesn't currently have the $25
billion required to buy back the notes in the first place.
The S&L cleanup funding is part of the federal budget talks
between Congress and the Bush administration.</p>
<p>Even if the cleanup agency had the liquidity, in the case
of Mr. Perelman it doesn't have the contractual right.
According to a House Banking Committee study, the Perelman
acquisition of five thrifts, now known as First Gibraltar,
Houston, received $2.3 billion in tax-free notes. The first
$865 million can't be prepaid for five years; as for the
rest, the holder is protected against loss in case of
repayment.</p>
<p>Even so, a spokesman for MacAndrews & Forbes Holdings
Inc., Mr. Perelman's New York-based company, said he believed
some government costs might be trimmed from the transaction.
"Within the four corners of our deal, there is room for some
cost-savings," he said, but he didn't know by how much. "A
wholesale renegotiation isn't foreseeable," he said.</p>
<p>Mr. Perelman is still buying up thrifts, even though the
S&L cleanup law, passed last year, explicitly barred any of
the 1988 buyers from acquiring other thrifts with government
assistance. But that rule was scrapped because so few bidders
have sought the S&Ls. Just Friday, First Gibraltar acquired
Sooner Federal Savings & Loan, a $1.2 billion-asset Tulsa,
Okla., thrift. And previously it acquired $2.6 billion San
Antonio Savings Association. Both are operated separately
from First Gibraltar.</p>
<p>Mr. Seidman said regulators are also trying to determine
if there is a legal basis for voiding thrift sales. So far,
they haven't found one, he said.</p>
<p>Details of the transactions infuriated the committee.
Members complained that the Robert Bass Group was given the
exclusive right to bid for American Savings Bank, Stockton,
Calif., for more than six months, a decision Mr. White said
he regretted. The panel was also outraged that the wealthy
Caroline Hunt Trust Estate, Dallas, was released from an
agreement to keep its Southwest Savings Association, Dallas,
well-capitalized.</p>
<p>"Frankly, these make the average citizen question very
seriously the intents and capabilities of the U.S.
government, if not its integrity," said Rep. Jim Leach (R.,
Iowa.)</p>
