	<p class="article-leader">AMSTERDAM -- Pierson, Heldring & Pierson N.V. launched an
open-ended mutual fund to invest internationally in companies
involved in cleaning up the environment or preventing
pollution.
   The fund, Environment Growth Fund N.V., is likely to
attract initial investments totaling 50 million guilders
(US$28 million) to 100 million guilders, said Frans J.
Ballendux, head of capital management at Pierson, a merchant
banking arm of ABN Amro Holding N.V. Mr. Ballendux said he
believed the fund would have attracted far more investors had
it not been launched amid stock market turmoil.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The shares, to be listed on the Amsterdam Stock Exchange,
will be sold at 50 guilders each, and the offering period
ends Sept. 26. New shares will continue to be available after
that date, but investors who buy during the offering period
avoid the 1% stock market commission.</p>
<p>The fund initially will focus on companies involved in
purification and waste management, Pierson said. As
opportunities arise, however, the fund aims to invest more in
companies providing systems and products that are "friendly"
to the environment.</p>
<p>Mr. Ballendux said the U.S. offers the most opportunities
for buying environmental stocks at the moment but that Europe
offers bigger long-term potential, particularly given the
huge task of cleaning up pollution in Central Europe.</p>
