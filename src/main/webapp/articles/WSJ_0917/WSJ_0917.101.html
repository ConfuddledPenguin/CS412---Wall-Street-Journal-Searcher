	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Six weeks after the government froze Kuwait's
U.S. assets to prevent Iraq from seizing them, Kuwaiti-owned
companies in the U.S. say operations are back to normal
thanks to exemptions granted by the Treasury Department.
   Customers and suppliers of Santa Fe International Corp.,
in Alhambra, Calif., initially expressed concern about
dealing with the Kuwaiti-owned oil drilling company following
Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait, said Vice President John
Mika.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"They wanted assurance that they were not violating any
freeze order by continuing their relationship with us," he
said.</p>
<p>But the Treasury "cooperated quite well with us" in
granting the exemption, which allows the company to continue
writing checks, making payroll and otherwise operate
normally, he said.</p>
<p>At Georgetown Industries Inc., a Kuwaiti-owned steel
company in Charlotte, N.C., "our business is very much
business as usual," said President Roger Regelbrugge. "We
have no other restrictions than that we are not supposed to
transfer assets to the government of Kuwait or to Iraq," he
said.</p>
<p>Hilton Hotels Corp., whose Atlanta Hotel & Tower is owned
by the Kuwaiti government, also has had no problems, said a
spokeswoman.</p>
<p>Estimates of Kuwait's U.S. investments vary from under $10
billion to more than $50 billion because of the nation's
policy of secrecy.</p>
<p>Kuwait's overall foreign assets last year totaled an
estimated $124 billion, according to DRI-McGraw-Hill Inc.
Much of that is in Europe, and includes such high-profile
investments as a 14% stake in Daimler-Benz AG, the German
auto, electronics and aerospace giant.</p>
<p>Santa Fe International, which state-owned Kuwait Petroleum
Corp. bought for $2.5 billion in 1981, is believed to be the
Mideast nation's largest single U.S. holding.</p>
<p>Other known Kuwaiti government assets in the U.S.,
according to the New York-based newsletter MidEast Report and
other sources, include:</p>
<p>-- Occidental Geothermal Inc. of Los Angeles, which Kuwait
Petroleum bought for $350 million in 1984.</p>
<p>-- About 12% of Corporate Property Investors, which owns
real estate in New York as well as a number of shopping malls
nationwide.</p>
<p>-- An undetermined stake in First American Bankshares
Inc., a bank-holding company in Washington.</p>
<p>-- 45% of the Phoenecian resort in Scottsdale, Ariz.,
which was controlled by scandal-plagued Lincoln Savings &
Loan Association until the federal government took over
Lincoln's share.</p>
<p>-- 45% of the Crescent hotel in Phoenix.</p>
<p>In addition, private Kuwaiti investors -- not subject to
the asset freeze -- hold an undetermined stake in Investcorp,
which owns Saks Fifth Avenue department stores and other
properties.</p>
<p>MidEast Report estimates Kuwait's U.S. assets at $50
billion.</p>
<p>Not even the Treasury Department, charged with enforcing
the asset freeze, has a complete accounting of Kuwait's U.S.
investments. The department began a list after Iraq's
invasion, but had not finished it as of last Friday, a
spokeswoman said.</p>
<p>The Treasury wouldn't disclose which companies have been
granted exemptions. The spokeswoman said the exemptions were
designed "to allow the Kuwati government to conduct its
normal business in the smoothest way possible while assuring
that no benefits accrue to Iraq."</p>
<p>The department also has issued general exemptions for
categories of companies, such as telephone and foreign
exchange companies that meet certain conditions.</p>
<p>According to one measure by the Commerce Department,
Kuwait's direct investments in U.S. companies totaled $4.2
billion last year. That figure doesn't account for
investments made through intermediaries such as Kuwaiti
companies not based in Kuwait.</p>
<p>Nor does it include investments in companies that result
in less than 10% of the voting stock, nor Kuwait's
"portfolio" accounts of stocks, bonds and other investments
being managed by U.S. investment houses.</p>
<p>David T. Mizrahi, editor of MidEast Report, estimates 25%
of Kuwait's U.S. assets are held in portfolio accounts at
firms including J.P. Morgan & Co., Morgan Stanley & Co. Inc.
and Citicorp.</p>
<p>By a broader measure last taken in 1988, the value of all
U.S. companies in which Kuwait held at least 10% control
totaled $10 billion.</p>
<p>But since that Commerce Department figure includes the
full value of those companies no matter what the size of
Kuwait's stake, it most likely overstates Kuwait's
investment.</p>
<p>Former Treasury Secretary G. William Miller helps manage
Kuwait's U.S. assets, MidEast Report says. Among Kuwait's
U.S. investment groups is the Wafra Investment Advisory Group
of New York, which invests Kuwaiti pension funds.</p>
<p>Much of Kuwait's assets world-wide are managed by the
Kuwaiti Investment Office in London.</p>
