	<p class="article-leader">I am a temp. When I arrive promptly at 9 a.m. at the
address my agency gave me, the person to whom I am supposed
to report is often not in yet. I don't mind at all, since I
bill from when I get there. Sometimes I'm given an
orientation of the office; most of the time I am not. The
better secretaries leave a note for me. These notes vary in
usefulness, but are always better than no note at all.
Frankly, most offices haven't got a clue as to what I need to
make my work cost-effective. Many don't even know what to
expect from a temp.
   Here are the picky-little things I need to do my one- to
two-week job well, things that anyone with an iota of common
sense could come up with, but, alas, never does:</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>-- Maps -- Buildings have floor plans, and I need one of
the department. Who sits where? I won't need (and don't want)
a detailed plan of the whole building, but running from desk
to desk reading names off of memos -- upside down, of course
-- to find out who's who is not very efficient. Also, when
hand-delivering messages it is helpful to know that "Fred" is
female and "A Boy Named Sue" grew up and now heads sales.</p>
<p>-- Phones -- The extensions should be clearly marked with
the names and numbers. A memo listing "x 124-A. Dahl, x
125-M. Smith" is useless. Most calls are for "Ann," not "Ms.
Dahl." Equally useless is an out-of-date phone listing.
Ideally have two lists in no less than 12-point type -- one
alphabetized by first names and the other by surnames. A temp
doesn't need details for all 30,000 people world-wide in
12-point type, but please have that directory nearby.</p>
<p>Make clear the ring protocol. Does the temp pick up on the
first ring? The third? When do phones bounce and where do
they go? Or come from? If you're on the other line, is the
temp supposed to intercom you, hold all calls, or run to your
office with a name on a note? Do you prefer being "not at
your desk" or "in a meeting?"</p>
<p>If your phones have multiple-city extensions (great for
hooking up several small offices) and your temp is going to
have to do relatively complicated maneuvers, you all had
better practice a few times -- and keep your humor.</p>
<p>-- Stationery -- I keep hoping that someday someone will
leave me a sample of all the different types of stationery
and memo paper, along with instructions on what goes on what
and how many spaces down I have to go with the date to not
print over the letterhead. I can dig around, but not everyone
I work for has personalized letterhead tucked under the
regular letterhead. I would appreciate knowing that paper for
inter-office memos exists before I set one up on regular memo
paper. Post-its are essential.</p>
<p>-- Annual Report -- A 50% chance I'll need other offices'
addresses, the president's name, all stuff within. Ideally,
I'll find a green pen so you can recognize my notes. When I'm
really organized I bring one.</p>
<p>Here are the things your temp should (and shouldn't) do:</p>
<p>-- Filing -- Do not have your temp file anything more
involved than correspondence into a three-ring chronological
folder. Two reasons: 1) the full-time person should look at
the stuff to know what went on; 2) things that can get lost
will get lost, especially if they are lost in a computer hard
drive and named something interesting. Even chronological
correspondence files can be a problem if there's one for
department memos, one for corporate memos, howeverall you
break it down. On the other hand, one-of-a-kind filing
projects are a very good temp task because there is no system
to learn or to damage.</p>
<p>-- Errands -- Most temps love errands. I've shopped for
everything from costumes for a sales meeting to a
refrigerator. I'll get great pastries on my way in and drop
off Fed-Ex on my way home (all billable hours, of course). I
love being a messenger on nice days.</p>
<p>-- Typing/Word Processing -- I give word-processed
documents to my boss with hand-written proofing marks,
explaining: "I find this the fastest way, since there are
usually changes and I hate wasting paper." No one has ever
disagreed.</p>
<p>Most of the stuff I'm asked to type has lots of little
tense problems, is redundant, and then, to make certain that
the point is made, is redundant again. (Young men are the
worst and young women, though only marginally better, are
territorial. Young engineers are clearer.)</p>
<p>-- Working with computers (PCs) -- Don't have your temp
hired for word processing do interesting document
manipulations on the first day. There are too many variations
in the programs and temp agencies don't screen us that
carefully. (I go on jobs that will require software I've
never touched because my agency knows I will figure it out
pretty quickly.) Even when I know the software, the keyboard
is different, the memory is more or less, or somebody
customized something.</p>
<p>Don't let your temp loose in the hard drive. Either start
a C:/Temp file or have an empty, formatted "Temp" disk for
the full-timer to review and file upon return.</p>
<p>Very seldom can I turn on a computer and figure out
someone's filing system, primarily because not many people
are well organized. If you might need a price-quote update or
want a proposal altered, make certain you know what it's
called and where it is: It could take me a day or two to find
it, and I'm a better-than-average temp.</p>
<p>-- Working with computers (mainframes, minis) -- Most
proprietary software is user-antagonistic and often the
budget priorities changed before the user manual was written.
Yet since I have been hired to do word processing -- a
computer thing -- I am expected to be fluent on all computer
things. On any proprietary system I have used, even simple
procedures -- such as processing a check request -- take me
three supervised times before I catch on: once -- total
darkness; twice -- vague familiarity; thrice -- minimum
competence. If it is only done a couple of times a week, just
farm it out to another secretary; it is not worth teaching a
temp.</p>
<p>For date entry or form-filling ventures, break it into
steps as much as possible. Do not have your temp uploading
data onto a proprietary system or running the analytics the
first day.</p>
<p>-- Photocopying -- I hate it mostly because I jam
machines. But reams of photocopying is a good, safe temp
chore -- although not one worth $20 to $25 per hour. Most
temps like photocopying because your boss can't hassle you
when you're miles away at the copier.</p>
<p>My boss at a large retailer -- now brushing against
Chapter 11 -- hired temps to make extra copies of all reports
so that she would always be able to find one someplace if all
the others got lost. (This departmental system was logical
relative to the company's international communications
methods.)</p>
<p>-- Travel Arrangements -- I will not know what you like
and where your price cut-off point is. Call the agent
yourself; it will be faster.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>Ms. Peterson is delighted that she never made enough money
as a temp to buy a highly mortgaged co-op in Manhattan.</p>
