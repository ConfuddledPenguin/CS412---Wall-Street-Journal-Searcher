	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- US Sprint Communications Corp. said it
obtained U.S. government approval to supply a Soviet joint
venture with packet switches that can greatly improve
telecommunications services between the Soviet Union and
other countries.
   The imminent shipment of these switches was announced by
William Esrey, chairman and chief executive officer of United
Telecommunications Inc., shortly after completing a visit to
the Soviet Union with Commerce Secretary Robert Mosbacher and
the chief executives of other U.S. companies. United
Telecommunications, of Westwood, Kan., is the parent of US
Sprint.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The export license that US Sprint expects to obtain as
early as this week will be the first license for
telecommunications equipment granted by the U.S. under the
new, relaxed regulations for shipping technology to the
Soviet Union, Mr. Esrey said.</p>
<p>The Soviet venture, Telenet USSR, will be owned by a US
Sprint subsidiary, Sprint International, and the Soviet
Ministry of Post and Telecommunications and the Larvian
Academy of Sciences, a Soviet research group.</p>
<p>The Commerce Department doesn't discuss details of
individual license applications, but Mr. Mosbacher has
publicly supported technology tie-ups between the U.S.
companies represented in his traveling group and potential
Soviet partners.</p>
<p>US Sprint appears to be leading the race among American
telecommunications companies to establish solid ties in the
Soviet Union. An earlier proposal by U S West Inc. to lay
down part of an international fiber-optic line across the
Soviet Union was rejected by U.S. authorities because of the
advanced nature of the technology.</p>
<p>US Sprint's packet switches, however, appear to be within
the new standards for permissible exports to the Soviet
Union. The switches are used to route telephone calls and
control traffic in voice, facsimile and digitalized data
transmission. These eight-bit switches are one or two
generations behind the comparable systems in use in Western
countries, but are still good enough to sharply improve the
ability of Sprint's Soviet customers to communicate with
other countries, Mr. Esrey's aides said. The company declined
to discuss the value of its investment or to disclose how
many switches will be sold.</p>
<p>US Sprint said its venture will operate through new,
dedicated satellite lines that will augment the
often-congested 32 international lines that currently exist
for Moscow-based businesses. Mr. Esrey said he expects the
venture to be in operation before the end of this year.</p>
