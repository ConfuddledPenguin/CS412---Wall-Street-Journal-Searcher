	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- The administration stepped up its opposition
to legislation that would tighten the fuel-economy rules on
cars, releasing studies claiming that the measure would cause
increases in deaths and injuries.
   At a news conference, Transportation Secretary Samuel
Skinner called the bill, sponsored by Sen. Richard Bryan (D.,
Nev.), a "highway fatality bill" and said he would recommend
President Bush veto the legislation.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Mr. Skinner's meeting with reporters came after proponents
won a key procedural vote by a bigger margin than expected.
The Senate voted 68-23 to end a filibuster that had kept the
bill from being debated. The bill, which has gained momentum
since the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait and subsequent embargo of
Iraqi oil, could come up for a vote late this week or early
next week.</p>
<p>The legislation would require auto makers to increase the
fuel efficiency of their fleets by 20% in the model year 1995
and 40% by 2001.</p>
<p>Mr. Skinner said existing technology won't allow
manufacturers to meet the requirements of the legislation
without a significant decrease in the size of American cars.
According to two studies done by the Transportation
Department's National Highway Traffic Safety Administration,
the Bryan legislation would require an 850-pound reduction in
the average weight of passenger cars. This, the study
asserted, would lead to an additional 600 to 1,140 deaths and
2,900 to 5,300 injuries a year.</p>
<p>Sen. Bryan and others continue to contend, however, that
it is very possible for the goals of his legislation to be
met using currently available technology.</p>
<p>A similar bill, sponsored by Rep. Barbara Boxer (D.,
Calif.), is pending before the House Energy and Commerce
Committee.</p>
