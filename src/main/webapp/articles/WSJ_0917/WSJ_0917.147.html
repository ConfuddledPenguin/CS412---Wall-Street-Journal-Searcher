	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- Congress should enact legislation to assure
that the U.S. government securities market has adequate
investor protection and that bond-price data are publicly
available on a timely basis to those willing to pay for it,
the General Accounting Office said.
   The congressional watchdog agency urged Congress to give
the Treasury authority to adopt rules to upgrade the sales
practices of government securities brokers and dealers and to
require interdealer brokers in the market to make transaction
information available to market participants on a real-time
basis.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The Public Securities Association, a bond trade group
whose members include all 41 primary dealers in U.S.
government securities, said it is working on an initiative
that "will obviate the need for Congress to mandate price
dissemination through federal regulation." The joint venture,
which involves primary dealers and most interdealer brokers,
"will begin disseminating prices in early 1991 on a 24-hour
global real-time basis," the association said.</p>
<p>The GAO recommended that Congress extend the Treasury's
rule-making authority over the government market. This
authority, granted in the 1986 Government Securities Act, is
scheduled to expire next year. GAO also urged Congress to
extend Securities Investor Protection Corp. coverage to
customer accounts in specialized government securities
dealers.</p>
<p>Acting Assistant Treasury Secretary Michael Basham, in a
letter attached to the GAO report, supported the
recommendation that Congress order public access to broker
screen information. He didn't address the sales-practices
question.</p>
