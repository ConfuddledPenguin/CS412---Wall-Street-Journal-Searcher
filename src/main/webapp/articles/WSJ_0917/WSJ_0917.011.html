	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- When the budget talks began four months ago,
the one certainty seemed to be that veteran tax foes Phil
Gramm and Newt Gingrich would lie down on the tracks to block
any tax increase.
   To listen to conservatives, Rep. Gingrich has delivered
and Sen. Gramm has sold out. Rep. Gingrich is calling for tax
cuts while Sen. Gramm, joining President Bush, has concluded
that raising taxes is the only way to get a pact to reduce
the budget deficit.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>But behind the closed doors, participants say, the
normally strident Rep. Gingrich is mute and Sen. Gramm has
emerged as the more-effective advocate of cutting
capital-gains taxes and resisting Democratic demands for
higher income-tax rates.</p>
<p>In short, Rep. Gingrich is still playing the outsiders'
game, even though the stocky, white-haired congressman from
Georgia is now No. 2 in the House Republican leadership. And
Sen. Gramm, a lanky Georgia native who moved to Texas to
teach economics, is fast trading his reputation as a bomb
thrower for one as a pragmatic insider.</p>
<p>For a time, some conservatives worried that both men had
been co-opted by Mr. Bush and top GOP congressional leaders
when the pair was named to the Republican negotiating team in
an obvious attempt to calm the party's right wing. But last
month, Rep. Gingrich suddenly began calling for tax cuts.</p>
<p>"Gingrich looks like he may be coming around," says budget
analyst Dan Mitchell of the Heritage Foundation, a
conservative think tank. "He realizes that falling on his
sword for the White House isn't exactly a great thing to do
for his political career. Gramm hasn't said he would support
whatever crummy agreement comes out, but it looks like that
is what he's going to do."</p>
<p>"I have been . . . radicalized by the summit in watching .
. . the Democrats," Rep. Gingrich said last month in one of
several headline-grabbing speeches that won him applause from
conservative pundits. "They would love to have more tax money
because . . . they have all this political spending they want
to do."</p>
<p>Sen. Gramm, though quick to condemn what he views as
Democrats' addiction to spending, sees his role differently.
"Do you want to govern or do you want to just protest?"</p>
<p>Mr. Gingrich says of his colleague: "He's a little more
cooperative than I am. But I am absolutely convinced that if
offered a bad deal, he would walk away from it -- just as I
would walk away from it."</p>
<p>As the contrast in their approaches became increasingly
evident, Sen. Gramm flew to suburban Atlanta earlier this
month to campaign for Rep. Gingrich's re-election -- and to
say he wouldn't join any attempt to torpedo the talks. Asked
about the trip, Sen. Gramm says only, "I don't kiss and
tell."</p>
<p>Even though Sen. Gramm has been a persistent advocate
inside the talks for many of their views, conservatives
remain uneasy. Rep. Vin Weber (R., Minn.), a Gingrich
lieutenant in the House, says, "Newt has said that first and
foremost he is advocating the basic positions of the
Republican Party, which is opposition to higher taxes and
support for a lower capital-gains tax, while Phil has decided
he's going to represent the point of view of the
administration," namely to strike a deficit-reduction deal
with the Democrats even if that means higher taxes.</p>
<p>Sen. Gramm responds that it is "wishful thinking" to say
that higher taxes can be avoided. "If I had the freedom to
write the package myself, it wouldn't have revenues. But I
didn't get to choose the members of the summit and I didn't
get to choose the members of the House and Senate."</p>
<p>Although the two men share political philosophies, Rep.
Gingrich broke with President Reagan in 1982 and voted
against a tax increase while then-Rep. Gramm, at the time a
Democrat, voted for it. Their paths have diverged again this
year, a reflection of differing personal ambitions as well as
the peculiarities of the House and Senate.</p>
<p>Rep. Gingrich figures that only through confrontation can
the frustrated Republican minority unseat the Democratic
liberals who have dominated the House for 36 years. His dream
is to lead Republicans to power under the banner of tax cuts
-- but that looks like a dream deferred by Mr. Bush's
repudiation of his no-new-taxes promise.</p>
<p>In the past few months, Rep. Gingrich has been tripped up
by conflicts between his roles as tax foe and budget
negotiator. In May, he declared in a fund-raising letter: "I
strongly believe that increasing taxes on working people will
NOT solve our country's massive budget problems]" In July, he
joined other House Republicans in vowing opposition to tax
increases of any kind. But later that month, witnesses say,
he told Democrats at the closed-door budget summit: "I'm
prepared to sponsor and support raising taxes," a statement
that quickly spread through the Capitol. Embarrassed, he
explained on the House floor the next morning that he would
support higher taxes -- but only after Democrats agreed to
cut spending.</p>
<p>Then late last month, Rep. Gingrich did another
about-face. With the economy weakening and the administration
unwilling to abandon the budget summit as he had hoped, he
began calling for billions of dollars in tax cuts to revive
economic growth.</p>
<p>"He changes his position {on taxes} more often than most
people change socks," charges his Democratic challenger in
his fall re-election contest, attorney David Worley.</p>
<p>Lately, Rep. Gingrich has been pressing his views on
fellow Republican negotiators, occasionally jousting with
White House Budget Director Richard Darman. But he has said
little at negotiating sessions with the Democrats.</p>
<p>"Why fight every day in a room that's stacked against
you?" says Rep. Weber. "In the end, they are going to have to
go to Newt to sign off on the deal, or decide they're going
to go around the House Republicans."</p>
<p>Mr. Gingrich, acknowledging his unpopularity among those
at the summit table, says of himself, "It's not all that
effective for Newt to push something."</p>
<p>In contrast to the fiercely partisan Rep. Gingrich, Sen.
Gramm has grown accustomed to working with Democrats in the
Senate, where Republicans have more influence because of
their numbers.</p>
<p>And while Rep. Gingrich draws his strength from
conservatives, Sen. Gramm is said to be cultivating moderate
Republicans. For now, he wants to be elected chairman of the
GOP Senate campaign fund-raising committee, but his ultimate
goal is to succeed George Bush in 1996.</p>
<p>At the budget talks, even Democrats have been impressed by
Sen. Gramm's forceful yet conciliatory arguments. One liberal
confides that he finds himself agreeing more often with Sen.
Gramm than with any other negotiator.</p>
<p>The transition to team player began last year when Sen.
Gramm won assignment to the Budget Committee, from which
Senate GOP leaders had previously blocked him, and to the
coveted Appropriations Committee. In that insider's world,
where party labels blur amid the trading, he has cooperated
to win funding for home-state projects.</p>
<p>Some critics suggest that Sen. Gramm is siding with Mr.
Bush in part because the president reappointed his wife,
Wendy, as chairman of the Commodity Futures Trading
Commission even though she has sparred repeatedly with
Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady.</p>
<p>But a more-immediate motive may be the prospect of massive
across-the-board spending cuts if the budget talks fail. The
cuts would literally bear Sen. Gramm's name: They are
mandated under the 1985 Gramm-Rudman deficit-reduction law
that the Texan co-sponsored.</p>
<p>"He naturally would be disinclined to see that one bad
thing that has his fingerprints on it happen," says a fellow
Texas GOP conservative, Rep. Dick Armey. "So I'm sure that
makes him more willing to consider alternatives."</p>
