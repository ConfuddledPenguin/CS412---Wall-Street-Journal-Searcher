	<p class="article-leader">Municipal bond investors are about to take a small step
out of the dark ages.
   These investors have long complained that they can't get
up-to-date financial information about state and local
governments whose bonds they buy.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Now Norwest Bank Corp., the big Minneapolis banking
concern that is trustee to nearly $20 billion of municipal
bonds, says it will for the first time provide limited
amounts of "market-sensitive" information to the financial
markets about the issuers whose bonds it oversees.</p>
<p>Stockholders have long enjoyed a regular stream of
quarterly financial reports from corporations and quick
announcements of market-moving information, such as takeovers
or lawsuits that could affect the company's stock price.</p>
<p>By contrast, municipal bondholders get skimpy and sporadic
financial information, especially for smaller issuers that
tap the debt market infrequently. It isn't uncommon for
investors first to learn that a municipal borrower is facing
trouble on the day its bonds default.</p>
<p>The information Norwest will disclose isn't massive, nor
is it comprehensive. The bank said it will inform the markets
in the event a default occurs or when certain financial
measures, such as capital adequacy ratios, fall below
required levels. This is the same information that it
currently sends to small groups of existing bondholders.</p>
<p>However, Norwest said it isn't ready to provide the
information that the markets considers most crucial: notice
that an issuer is drawing on insurance or letters of credit
to make principal and interest payments, dipping into reserve
funds to make payments or consistently making late payments.
These are considered potential default tip-offs.</p>
<p>The banking concern said it will provide the information
through an electronic wire service operated by a unit of J.J.
Kenny & Co. In the future, Norwest said, it will release the
disclosures to other electronic services, including one being
developed by the quasi-federal Municipal Securities
Rulemaking Board.</p>
<p>"We appreciate the fact that the marketplace needs
information to operate efficiently," said Tom Kraack, vice
president who heads the corporate trust department at
Norwest. "We just see it, pure and simple, as a
customer-service issue." He said the bank won't offer the
most sensitive information until certain legal issues are
made clearer, specifically the legal liability of trustees
providing information to the markets that concerns other
entities.</p>
<p>"It's too risky for a trustee to move beyond that which is
explicitly allowable" within certain indentures, said Mr.
Kraack.</p>
<p>But even this limited move has some people angry. The
National Association of Bond Lawyers said it may not be the
role of trustees like Norwest to provide information to the
entire market.</p>
<p>Even the city of Minneapolis, one of Norwest's biggest
customers, is a bit upset. "Philosophically, it's the wrong
thing to do. The information belongs to the issuer, not the
trustee," said John Gunyou, finance director for the city of
Minneapolis. Mr. Gunyou said he is considering finding a new
trustee. `We're their largest customer and they never talked
to us about this."</p>
<p>Mr. Gunyou says he's not against full disclosure. In fact,
he's an MSRB member and is working with the group to
establish the new electronic disclosure system.</p>
<p>Among other things, Mr. Gunyou and the MSRB are irritated
that Norwest decided to act now, rather than wait the extra
months -- or even years -- it will take for the MSRB to have
its system up and running. The MSRB, along with the American
Bankers Association, which represents trustees, are
developing guidelines for trustees to use in sending default
and predefault information to the secondary or resale market
via the MSRB system. But the debate over the guidelines could
drag on for some time.</p>
<p>The squabbling between the MSRB, municipal bond issuers
and bond trustees shows just how far away the municipal
market is from forging municipal-bond disclosure regulations,
even after years of debate.</p>
<p>The current call for more municipal bond disclosure grew
out of the Securities and Exchange Commission's investigation
of the 1983 default by the Washington Public Power Supply
System on $2.25 billion of tax-exempt bonds. It was the
largest municipal bond default ever and stunned many
investors, who considered the bonds ultra-safe and who had no
idea until it was too late that the WPPSS was having
financial problems.</p>
<p>Last year, the Securities and Exchange Commission issued
new disclosure rules for new municipal issues. But the rules
didn't fully address the problem of disclosure to the
secondary market about issuers after an initial offering.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>Friday's Market Activity</p>
<p>Jitters about the Persian Gulf, higher oil prices and
discomforting economic reports pushed prices of government
bonds lower. But investors continued to buy Treasury bills
and short-term notes, keeping prices of those securities
firm.</p>
<p>The Treasury's 30-year bond was quoted late Friday at 97
4/32, down 19/32 from Thursday, to yield about 9.02%. The
twoyear note was at 100 5/32, down 1/32, to yield about
8.02%.</p>
<p>Prices fell as soon as the market opened Friday. While
dealers and investors were preparing for a torrent of
potentially market-moving economic data at 8:30 a.m. EDT,
reports hit the wires that Iraqi troops had stormed the
residences of several Western ambassadors to Kuwait and had
taken prisoner a French military attache, who has since been
released.</p>
<p>The government then released data showing that the
producer price index, a measure of inflation, jumped 1.3%
last month, while retail sales fell 0.6%. Later, a Federal
Reserve report revealed that industrial output fell 0.2% in
August and capacity utilization slipped 0.4 percentage point
to 83.1%.</p>
<p>Although the news of weakening economic growth often would
boost bonds, concerns about the possibility of war in the
Middle East and higher inflation, which erodes the value of
bonds, overshadowed the bullish data.</p>
<p>In the municipal bond market, yields on general obligation
bonds issued by Philadelphia topped 9% as prices were knocked
lower in response to the city's financial woes.</p>
<p>"I have seen trades at yields as high as 9.50%" for
Philadelphia GOs, said Alan Schankel, first vice president
and manager of the municipal bond department at Janney
Montgomery Scott Inc.</p>
<p>The latest blow to the city came at midday Friday when
Moody's Investors Service Inc. lowered its rating on
Philadelphia's long-term bonds to single-B from Ba. That's
the lowest rating of any major U.S. city.</p>
<p>Prior to the Moody's rating action, traders had quoted
Philadelphia 8 1/4% bonds due 2009 at yields of about 8.80%.</p>
<p>Philadelphia bonds also were hurt by other factors, such
as the loss of a letter of credit backing from Swiss Bank
Corp., which caused the city to postpone a $375 million
short-term note sale.</p>
