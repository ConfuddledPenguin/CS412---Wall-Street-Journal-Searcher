	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- A slowdown in world economic growth rates
and the situation created by the crisis in the Middle East
"make it all the more urgent" that the Uruguay Round of world
trade negotiations be successfully completed by late this
year, according to Michel Camdessus, managing director of the
International Monetary Fund.
   With finance ministers, central bankers and other
officials of industrial nations and developing countries
scheduled to gather in Washington late this week for the
joint annual meeting of the IMF and the World Bank, top
officials of both international agencies will be stressing
this issue, along with the need for other actions to offset
higher world oil prices and the "second-round" economic
impact of the Middle East crisis on developing nations.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"If the concept of international community has any
meaning," says Mr. Camdessus, then the industrial countries
must intensify their efforts to achieve higher economic
growth rates than can be achieved without triggering an
acceleration of inflation.</p>
<p>"In the trade area," the IMF official adds, "it is
essential that they open their markets further and strive for
more liberal trade and payments systems. Indeed, the recent
slowdown in world growth, together with the situation created
by the situation in the Middle East, make it all the more
urgent that the Uruguay Round negotiations be concluded
successfully."</p>
<p>Mr. Camdessus made his comments at a meeting of a United
Nations group in Paris last week, where he also said the
current world economic outlook points to a further slowing of
growth rates and higher inflation rates during 1990 and 1991
in industrial countries and a worsening of the export
prospects for developing countries as a result of weaker
demand for their products in world markets.</p>
<p>The IMF, in its annual report approved by its executive
directors who represent the 151 member nations of the
international agency, also said "stronger efforts are
urgently needed to counter protectionism and to foster a more
open trading system with transparent, predictable and
nondiscriminatory rules in order to sustain" an expansion of
world trade and provide markets for exports from the indebted
developing countries.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>EXPORT GROWTH: Both the IMF and the World Bank, in their
annual reports, noted that world trade, measured either by
volume or value terms, expanded by about 7.5% last year, down
from an unusually high 9% increase a year earlier. But
exports of developing countries as a group failed to achieve
such big gains.</p>
<p>The World Bank said 1989 was the first year since 1985
that exports of developing countries as a group didn't expand
at a higher rate than the world average, and it noted that
shipments of manufactured goods by the major Asian exporters
"fell sharply" last year.</p>
<p>Market shares for exports have been shifting, the IMF
said.</p>
<p>"The volume of goods exported by the U.S. increased by
10.5% in 1989, the best performance among the major
industrial countries," the IMF said, adding that this raised
the U.S. share of total world trade, excluding oil, to 13.5%
from a low of 11.5% in 1987.</p>
<p>Japan's share of world exports in 1989, the IMF said,
declined to 10% from a peak of 11.5% in 1986, while West
Germany, displaced by the U.S. as the top world exporter of
manufactured goods, held "steady" with about a 12.5% share of
nonoil exports in 1989.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>MAJOR WORLD EXPORTERS: According to the World Bank, 23
countries rank among the leading exporters; they accounted
for about 78.2% of all exports in 1989.</p>
<p>The World Bank ranking, in order, of the major exporters
in terms of their market-shares for all types of exports last
year, is: U.S., West Germany, Japan, France, Britain, Italy,
Canada, Soviet Union, the Netherlands, Belgium-Luxembourg,
South Korea, China, Sweden, Switzerland, Singapore, Spain,
Australia, Mexico, Brazil, Austria, East Germany, Saudi
Arabia, and Denmark.</p>
<p>The World Bank didn't include data on exports of Taiwan or
Hong Kong, both of which probably would have made the list if
their shares of world exports had been computed.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>CZECHOSLOVAKIAN TRADE: Legislation to reduce U.S. tariff
rates for imports from Czechoslovakia was expected to glide
through the U.S. Congress without much difficulty before the
final 1990 Capitol Hill adjournment next month.</p>
<p>But the White House plan to extend similar
most-favored-nation treatment to imports from the Soviet
Union apparently won't be considered by the U.S. Congress
until next year.</p>
<p>In Moscow, U.S. Commerce Secretary Robert Mosbacher said
last week that Soviet officials told him that it would take
four to eight weeks for the Supreme Soviet legislative body
to complete action on a proposed law to liberalize Soviet
emigration policies.</p>

<p>AIRBUS SUBSIDIES: U.S. Trade Representative Carla Hills is
leading a high-ranking delegation of U.S. corporation
executives, bankers, labor leaders and farm group officials
to Geneva early this week to size up the prospects for
completing the Uruguay Round of world trade negotiations
later this year.</p>
<p>Mrs. Hills also plans to visit Brussels and Rome before
returning to Washington at the end of the week.</p>
<p>During the Brussels visit, Mrs. Hills probably will also
hold talks with European Community Commissioner Frans
Andriessen on a proposed agreement that would limit
development subsidies provided to Airbus Industrie, the
western European commercial aircraft-building consortium, by
the governments of West Germany, Britain, France and Spain.</p>
<p>U.S. and EC sources say prospects are improving that such
an agreement can be reached by the end of this month.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>PRIVATE INVESTMENTS IN THIRD WORLD: The International
Finance Corp., a World Bank affiliate that started off on a
small scale way back in 1956 to help finance manufacturing
plants and other private business ventures in developing
nations has become a relatively "big-money" operation.</p>
<p>In the year ending last June 30, for example, the IFC made
about $2.2 billion in such investments and it persuaded
international commercial banks to provide about $622 million
of that amount through participations in the IFC-approved
loans and equity investments.</p>
<p>Now the IFC is looking for its 135-member countries to
agree late this year on a $1 billion IFC capital increase
that would allow the World Bank affiliate to step up its own
borrowings in private capital markets and keep expanding its
operations over the next five years.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>COUNTERTRADE: A former senior U.S. Export-Import Bank
official who arranges private countertrade deals between U.S.
companies and others abroad, is trying to persuade U.S.
trade-policy officials to be more supportive of such
transactions.</p>
<p>Matt Schaffer, of D.M. Schaffer Corp., based in
Washington, says Japanese trading companies have long used
countertrade arrangements that customarily involve payment in
goods, rather than money, for exports.</p>
<p>Generally, countertrade opponents argue that trading
exports for other goods, ranging from bathtubs to canned
hams, is a burdensome and inefficient way of engaging in
international trade.</p>
<p>Countertrade used to be a big thing in eastern European
countries, almost as a matter of necessity, but economic
reforms now under way in that part of the world are steering
away from countertrade transactions and U.S. trade-policy
officials have applauded this trend.</p>
