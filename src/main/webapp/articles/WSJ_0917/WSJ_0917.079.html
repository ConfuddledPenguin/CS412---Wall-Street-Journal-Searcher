	<p class="article-leader">PARIS -- French consumer prices rose 0.6% in August from
July and were up 3.5% from a year earlier, according to
preliminary estimates published Friday by the National
Statistics Institute.
   The 0.6% increase represents a sharp acceleration from
July's 0.3% gain. The upswing had been anticipated, however,
as a result of the pressure on oil prices following Iraq's
invasion of Kuwait.</p>
