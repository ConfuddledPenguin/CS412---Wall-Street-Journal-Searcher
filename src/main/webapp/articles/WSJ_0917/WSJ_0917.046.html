	<p class="article-leader">South Africa does not offer much encouragement to the
world's natural optimists. Violence rages in the black
townships, aggravated by overcrowding that results from an
influx of blacks from rural areas and such destitute
neighboring countries as Zambia and Mozambique. The economy
is in recession; production in the second quarter declined at
an annual rate of 1%. Communists, with nothing to offer other
than a rapid trip to economic disaster, flaunt their new
freedoms.
   President F.W. de Klerk has moved in the direction
demanded by the anti-apartheid activists of Europe and
America, but has received little recognition for his courage.
Indeed, with South Africa rapidly becoming a bloody
battleground (500 violent deaths in August alone) its foreign
critics have become uncharacteristically silent. They now
prefer to pretend that it doesn't exist, which means that the
economic sanctions they demanded remain in place, with little
promise that positive measures to dismantle apartheid will be
rewarded.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>It takes some serious searching to find any bright spots
in all of this. But South Africans of all races have
developed a certain resiliency out of their many tensions and
conflicts and maintain something of a frontier spirit. Elias
Links, consul-general in Zurich and one of his associates,
finance counselor Bruce Cameron, have been trying to talk up
South Africa's prospects with Western bankers. One
achievement has been to persuade the World Bank to at least
resume research on South Africa's needs, even if there are no
immediate prospects for real lending.</p>
<p>One little light of hope glimmers when Mr. Links, who is a
black and a former university economics professor, uses the
expression "informal sector" in referring to growing
grass-roots enterprise among South African blacks. Yes
indeed, he says, he has read the writings of Hernando de
Soto, the Peruvian author who coined that expression.
Moreover, Mr. De Soto's ideas are making some impression on
the South African government. Along with dismantling
apartheid, the government is weakening as well barriers
preventing blacks from becoming entrepreneurs.</p>
<p>Mr. Links cites the case of black-owned and operated
buses. As with many nations of its type, South Africa has
discouraged competition against state transportation systems
from private carriers. But restrictions have been eased and
service by small, privately-owned buses has been thriving.
Toyota -- not a company to miss a bet -- is supplying a bus
specially designed for economical transport. Black-operated
repair shops and maintenance facilities are growing up around
service.</p>
<p>That is exactly the sort of thing Hernando de Soto has
been promoting for a decade as a prescription for bringing
real capitalism to countries where private capitalism has
been largely reserved for protected elites. His book, "The
Other Path," (meaning a path other the one promoted
throughout the Third World by Socialist revolutionaries) has
received acclaim throughout the world. In a speech to the IMF
a year ago, President George Bush said that "De Soto's
greatest contribution has been to point out what, in
retrospect, may seem obvious: People everywhere want the same
things. And when left alone by government, people everywhere
organize their lives in remarkably similar ways."</p>
<p>One of the often-overlooked truths about postwar South
Africa is the economic engineering that accompanies
Pretoria's social engineering. The progenitors of the ruling
Nationalist Party, such men as D.F. Malan and H.F. Vervoerd,
had far more in common with the early Bolsheviks of Russia
than with American capitalism. They were paternalists,
envisioning -- perhaps sincerely -- a social system in which
whites, blacks, coloreds and Asians could live happily, but
separately.</p>
<p>An overlay of capitalism, mainly in the form of private
gold mining enterprises and foreign-owned manufacturing,
covered up and helped finance a large and intrusive public
sector. It managed the lives of non-whites with full
confidence that Pretoria knew what was best for them. The
non-whites lived better, with better housing and hygienic
standards, than blacks anywhere else in Africa, but with
little freedom to develop along lines of their own choosing.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, as Mr. Links points out, many blacks think
that South Africa is a "capitalist" state and that apartheid
is one result. They have been encouraged in that view by the
likes of Joe Slovo, the white general secretary of the South
African Communist Party. Mr. Slovo and his followers dominate
the militant wing of the African National Congress, and show
no signs that they are prepared to deviate from their
efforts, through the use of violence, to make South Africa a
Communist state.</p>
<p>Some other ANC members, including quite possibly Nelson
Mandela, may be having some second thoughts about the
direction the militants are heading. But, as so often
happens, the militants have made themselves feared by anyone
who might prefer a moderate course. Violent death can come
very suddenly, and has often done so, to moderates.
Resistance from the militants deters Mr. Mandela from making
peace with Mangosuthu Buthelezi's Inkatha movement. It is
composed mainly of Zulus, South Africa's largest black tribal
nation. ANC-Inkatha strife accounts for much of the country's
bloodshed.</p>
<p>The tragedy is that Mr. Buthelezi is market-oriented and
understands the importance of empowering all Africans with
fundamental economic rights, to own property and operate
businesses free of excessive government restriction. As the
Soviet Union is discovering, economic empowerment is just as
important as a means of energizing an economy as the granting
of political rights.</p>
<p>Yet another tragedy is that economic sanctions --
especially those applied by the U.S. -- have largely removed
from South Africa the kinds of influences that would be most
helpful in encouraging the "informal sector" to seek true
legal status and develop from the ground up. American
businessmen, having been raised in a system where private
businesses start small and grow, understand the process well.
Their prevailing egalitarianism helped break down color
barriers in their plants. But because of pressures applied to
their parent companies in the U.S. -- often by groups that
were more concerned about their own domestic political goals
than about the future of South Africa's blacks -- most have
left.</p>
<p>Whether economic empowerment will damp the flames of
violence is a crucial issue. Mr. Links thinks it will help
and, as a South African black, he is better qualified to
judge than an outsider. Obviously, an "informal sector"
operating in a legal void cannot be transformed into
entrepreneurial economy in short order. But awareness of that
potential is a start, and gives some light to an otherwise
gloomy outlook.</p>
