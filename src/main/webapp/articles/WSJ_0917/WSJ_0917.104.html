	<p class="article-leader">HOLLYWOOD -- Walt Disney Co. has quietly decided to cease
development of hourlong dramatic television shows, giving up
on a business which has been troubled since the mid-1980s.
   Disney will continue to produce half-hour comedies.
Indeed, it has been spending lavishly to attract comedy
writer/producers. It also will continue to produce "The
Magical World of Disney" for NBC as long as the network wants
it. Another new one-hour Disney show for NBC, "Hull High,"
premiered this year and will stay on the air if ratings
permit.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>But Disney's drama development department will be
eliminated and its key executives reassigned, according to
individuals close to the company. The contracts of the
handful of writer/producers in the one-hour field who are
committed to Disney won't be renewed.</p>
<p>At corporate meetings last week when six-month financial
analyses were studied, executives decided that producing
dramas was too expensive, given the paltry returns. The
situation has existed since 1986, when the bottom fell out of
the rerun syndication market for hourlong shows. Studios had
been taking big losses in producing one-hour shows because
they usually cost well more than $1 million per episode to
produce while the networks would pay only $600,000-$900,000
for the right to air them. Producers would hope to make back
these "deficits" by selling local stations the right to air
reruns, and sometimes it paid off: MCA Inc.'s "Magnum P.I."
reaped nearly $2 million per episode.</p>
<p>But stations lost interest. The most lucrative reruns for
them are shows they can air weekdays between 4 p.m. and 8
p.m., and viewers seemed to gravitate to lighter fare, such
as game shows and comedies, during those hours. An
award-winning program like "Hill Street Blues" had little
value for station managers, and though producers would try to
cobble together a profit from foreign sales and cable deals,
few succeeded. The only recent drama show with some success
in syndication is Stephen J. Cannell Productions' "Hunter."</p>
<p>But since shows need to air on the networks for five years
to have optimum syndication value, suppliers were faced with
having to gamble that the market would turn around
eventually, and they continued to produce dramas, slashing
costs and filming in locations outside Hollywood to try to
bring down deficits.</p>
<p>Last week, Disney said "enough already," an executive
recounted. CBS had ordered a show called "N.Y.P.D. Mounted,"
which would have cost Disney about $1.3 million per episode
to make; CBS was offering just over $900,000. Disney
"refused" the order and the show will be taken over by Orion
Pictures Corp. Disney then decided to bail out entirely.</p>
<p>Although some studios have been low-key about producing
dramas, like Paramount Communications Inc., Disney is the
first to formally abandon the practice. Disney hadn't even
had a chance to inform the networks before a report leaked to
the Los Angeles Times Saturday. And even though the networks
will always need drama shows for their schedules, they aren't
expected to complain too loudly because Disney, which didn't
have much television presence until recently, is spending so
much to become a force in comedy.</p>
