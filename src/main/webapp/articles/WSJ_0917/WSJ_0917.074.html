	<p class="article-leader">Barry Rubin, in "Arafat's Iraq Debacle," editorial page,
Aug. 24, failed to mention the debacle for those
organizations such as the Peace Now movement that have
pursued the idea of a negotiated "peace process" with the
PLO.
   In its wildest dreams Israel could never hope to meet the
positions held by Kuwait with respect to Iraq and the PLO.
These include internationally recognized boundaries, full
trade relations, no refugee problems, recognition by the
U.N., a practically demilitarized posture (armed forces
1/50th the size of Iraq's) and the same cultural and
religious background. Yet the response to these positions by
Iraq, supported by the PLO, was swift and complete
obliteration of a nation at peace.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Since Iraq is within missile, chemical and nuclear range
of Israel, the lesson for Israel is clear: No amount of
peace-loving posturing will bring any security. Rather,
Israel should remain as strong as possible and continue its
policy of offering to negotiate with any Arab organization or
nation that does not have a charter calling for Israel's
destruction.</p>
