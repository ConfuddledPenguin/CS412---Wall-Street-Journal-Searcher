	<p class="article-leader">The smell of a bubbling cauldron is wafting out of the
glass cocoon at Andrews Air Force Base. Deprived of any
sensory contact with reality, Republican negotiators are
ready to lop in the final portion of toadstools and a dose of
nightshade. The scents suggest dick Darman will come back
with a cut in the capital-gains tax, but Democrats will get
to decide how much in revenue this will "cost" (gain). Then
Democrats will get a "surcharge" on tax rates for the rich,"
but also get to say how much revenue this will "raise"
(lose).
   To add insult to injury, Republicans will tell us they
didn't "raise rates," but only adopted a "surcharge." Voters
will have to figure out for themselves that a 20% surcharge
is the same as a boost in the marginal rate, perhaps a
substantial one depending on details.</p>
