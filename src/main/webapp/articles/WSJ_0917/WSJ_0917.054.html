	<p class="article-leader">CLEVELAND -- Parker Hannifin Corp. expects to increase
sales and earnings in fiscal 1991 despite the Middle East
crisis and the current economic uncertainty, Paul G.
Schloemer, president and chief executive officer, said.
   "There's more pessimistic conversation around than there
was a few months ago, but we haven't seen an appreciable
change in the order book," he said in an interview.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>In the year ended June 30, 1990, the producer of motion
control products for industrial and aerospace uses earned
from continuing operations $110.4 million, or $2.26 a share,
on sales of $2.45 billion. Net income was $111.5 million, or
$2.28 a share.</p>
<p>Despite the relatively optimistic outlook, Parker Hannifin
this fiscal year will be channeling more of its cash flow
into stock buy-backs and less into plant and equipment
spending, Mr. Schloemer said.</p>
<p>Parker's domestic orders for industrial products, the
company's best barometer of U.S. economic activity, rose 7%
in July from a year earlier, he said. In August they trailed
year-earlier levels by about 1%, which he said he doesn't
regard as significant. The company produces more than 200,000
different products for hydraulic, pneumatic and
electromechanical motion control in a wide range of
businesses, giving Parker a good feel for general economic
activity.</p>
<p>Certain U.S. markets, such as parts for construction
machinery and heavy trucks, are weak, Mr. Schloemer said. And
there's less optimism about an imminent upturn in those
businesses than there was a few months ago. But Parker's
orders for some other industrial products, auto parts and
aerospace products have increased, he said.</p>
<p>Orders continue to rise in most overseas markets, Mr.
Schloemer said. The rate of order increase is slowing a
little in Europe, he said, but that appears to be the result
of capacity constraints at plants Parker supplies rather than
a drop in demand for the end products. "And Brazil is right
back on track," he said, following a period earlier this year
when the Brazilian government's efforts to fight inflation
greatly reduced economic activity.</p>
<p>Parker Hannifin directors last month authorized repurchase
of as many as three million common shares, about 6% of the 49
million shares outstanding, Mr. Schloemer said. The company
doesn't expect to complete the repurchases in fiscal 1991,
however, he said.</p>
<p>Capital spending will decline to the $80 million to $85
million range, he said, from $125 million in fiscal 1990 and
$149 million in 1989. "We've been spending at a rather high
rate, and have built a lot of new plants," Mr. Schloemer
said. As a result, the company has adequate capacity for most
products, and its plants are modern and efficient, he said.</p>
<p>Both the 1991 stock repurchases and capital spending will
be financed with internally generated cash flow, he said. In
fact, the company expects to continue to reduce its debt this
year, he added.</p>
<p>"In the short term, we have decided that the best thing to
do with our capital is to repurchase some of our stock," Mr.
Schloemer said. Parker Hannifin stock has been trading
recently at $23 to $24 a share, down more than 25% from its
52-week high of $32.75.</p>
<p>Mr. Schloemer said the more conservative investment
approach isn't a reflection on management's expectations for
the 1990s. He said the company is optimistic about the coming
decade. But this year sales aren't booming and the company
can invest less in facilities and still meet anticipated
demand for its products. Parker probably will be investing
more aggressively in the future to expand and upgrade
facilities, he said.</p>
<p>Parker has increased the dividend for each of the past 34
years, and the board is likely to continue that tradition,
Mr. Schloemer said. The company's policy is to pay out about
one-third of earnings in dividends, he said. The current rate
is 23 cents quarterly, an increase of two cents a share from
the 21 cents paid in each of the first two quarters of fiscal
1990.</p>
