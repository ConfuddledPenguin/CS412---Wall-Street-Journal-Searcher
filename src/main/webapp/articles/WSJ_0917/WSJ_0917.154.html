	<p class="article-leader">TOKYO -- U.S. and Japanese trade negotiators continued
talks over the weekend in an effort to settle a dispute over
whether Allied-Signal Inc. is being denied fair access to the
Japanese market for its amorphous metals material.
   Although the deadline for settling the issue without
formal action by the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative
was technically Saturday, Allied won't be able to activate
its petition until Monday morning in Washington.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>A U.S. official familiar with the talks indicated that,
while there hadn't been any fundamental breakthroughs as of
Sunday morning, there had been enough movement to continue
talking. He rated the chances for an eleventh-hour agreement
as "an even call."</p>
<p>Allied, based in Morristown, N.J., filed a complaint last
March charging that Japanese electric utilities were delaying
commercial introduction of amorphous-metal electrical
transformers until Japanese steelmakers could find a way
around Allied's Japanese patent protection for the material.
At the request of U.S. trade officials, Allied later
suspended the complaint until Sept. 15 to allow time for the
issue to be settled without formal action.</p>
<p>Under U.S. trade law, reactivation of the petition could
lead to retaliatory action against Japanese imports to the
U.S. next year.</p>
