	<p class="article-leader">Two Ernst & Young partners were appointed as receivers to
manage Northern Star Holdings Ltd., an Australian television
network operator.
   Ernst & Young said the partners, James Millar and Robert
Dunn, were appointed at the request of Northern Star and its
three major banks, Westpac Banking Corp., Commonwealth
Banking Corp. and Citicorp.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The banks are owed more than 400 million Australian
dollars (US$330.8 million), mostly to Westpac. Steve Cosser,
Northern Star chief executive officer, said the receivership
arrangement was made in cooperation with the three banks.</p>
<p>Westpac said that subject to the receivers'
investigations, the banks propose to provide continued
financial support so the Channel Ten network operated by
Northern Star can recover.</p>
<p>Rupert Murdoch's News Corp. owns about 5% of Northern
Star. Britain's Daily Mail & General Trust Group PLC has
14.5% and Thames Television PLC holds 10%.</p>
<p>Two of Australia's three commercial TV networks now are in
receivership.</p>
