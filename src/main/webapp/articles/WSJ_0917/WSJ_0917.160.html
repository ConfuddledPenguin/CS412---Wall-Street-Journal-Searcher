	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- The Securities and Exchange Commission
expressed dismay at new standards the accounting industry has
adopted for financial institutions, and the agency urged that
the standards be tightened sharply.
   At issue is the way financial institutions, mostly banks
and thrifts, account for debt securities they hold for
investment. Under current accounting rules, such securities
are marked at their historic cost, while debt securities held
for short periods and used as trading assets are marked to
the market price.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The SEC, in a letter to an accounting industry panel, said
the current method has "repeatedly proven to be irrelevant to
valuing investment portfolios." The agency said all debt
instruments should be marked to the market price.</p>
<p>The letter -- from Edmund Coulson, the SEC's chief
accountant, and Robert Bayless, chief accountant of the SEC
corporation finance division -- follows an effort last week
by the Accounting Standards Executive Committee of the
American Institute of Certified Public Accountants to change
the current rules. The committee voted Thursday to force
banks to disclose in notes to financial statements
information about the amortized cost and market value of
their investment holdings.</p>
<p>The SEC wasn't satisfied with the vote, which represented
a significant pullback from earlier committee proposals that
would have required financial institutions to report in
financial statements themselves any changes in the portfolio
value of debt held as investments. The committee's original
plan drew protests from accountants and bankers, who argued
that marking all debt securities to market would cause wide
swings in earnings reports.</p>
<p>The SEC dismisses that view. "Any volatility is a product
of a financial institution's investment portfolio," the
agency said in its letter. "Accounting standards ought not to
conceal the reality they are established to portray."</p>
<p>Mr. Coulson said in an interview that AICPA's move was "an
interim measure" but "not the final answer."</p>
<p>The SEC letter argues that the panel shouldn't "seek to
redefine the distinctions between `trading' and `investment'
securities, but to recognize that these distinctions cannot
justify permitting a reporting company to overvalue assets"
with a specific value.</p>
<p>SEC Chairman Richard Breeden made similar comments earlier
last week to the Senate Banking Committee. He said Friday
that he is worried that some banks' financial statements
should carry the caution "once upon a time" at the top of the
page.</p>
<p>Mr. Breeden cited the thrift crisis as a clear
illustration of the flaws of the current accounting system.
In an interview, he explained that in 1980, when Congress was
considering proposals to deregulate the thrift industry, S&Ls
were showing a positive net worth of $36.2 billion. But on a
mark-to-market basis, their net worth was actually "somewhere
between minus $78 billion and minus $118 billion," according
to later research.</p>
<p>The failure of thrifts to reflect their true value
accurately, Mr. Breeden said, "was a significant factor in
delaying the understanding by the public of the actual
condition of the thrift industry."</p>
