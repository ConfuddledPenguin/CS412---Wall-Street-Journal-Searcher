	<p class="article-leader">AUSTRALIA FINES SONY</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The Australian unit of Japan's Sony Corp. was criticized
by Australian antitrust regulators and fined by a federal
court.</p>
<p>Sony (Australia) Pty. was fined 250,000 Australian dollars
(US$206,750) for six breaches of the Trade Practices Act.
Sony officials in Australia were fined an additional
A$37,000.</p>
<p>Two Brisbane retailers alleged that Sony withheld supply
of electronic and entertainment equipment because the
retailers had discounted the goods below prices set by the
company.</p>
<p>The court said the maximum fines weren't adequate to deter
Sony from breaking the law. It said the fines should be
increased in the future. Currently, the maximum penalty for a
breach by a corporation is A$250,000 and the maximum penalty
for a person is A$50,000.</p>
<p>CORN FLAKES AND CAFE AU LAIT</p>
<p>A U.S. Agriculture Department report said corn flakes and
other cereals are gaining favor in France. The report in the
October issue of AgExporter magazine said sales of breakfast
cereals in France rose 25% in value last year, following a
growth of more than 80% from 1985 to 1988. It said 1989
French imports of breakfast cereals were valued at $5.9
million and totaled 30,496 metric tons, or 92% of total
sales. Most of the imports came from West Germany, where
Kellogg Co. -- the most popular brand on French store shelves
-- has a plant. Other major suppliers were Britain and Italy.</p>
<p>FINANCING JAPANESE POLITICS</p>
<p>Funds raised by Japanese politicians, political parties
and groups climbed to a record $1.23 billion in 1989, a 0.6%
rise over the previous year, the Home Affairs Ministry said.
The Japan Communist Party topped the list of fund-raising
parties with a record $214 million, the ministry said. The
Communists get about 80% of their funds from the party's Red
Flag newspaper, which claims a circulation of around three
million. Next were the ruling Liberal Democratic Party with
$178 million and the Komeito (Clean Government Party) with
$107 million.</p>
<p>BERLIN'S RABID FOXES</p>
<p>Since the Berlin Wall crumbled last November, 37 rabid
foxes have been found in West Berlin, including one at a
crowded swimming pool. About 10 people have been bitten,
according to West Berlin Health Department spokesman
Thomas-Peter Gallon. "The fall of the borders with East
Germany not only led to people moving freely, but also
foxes," Mr. Gallon said. "Before, rabies had been virtually
wiped out."</p>
<p>MALAYSIA'S TOURISM EARNINGS RISE</p>
<p>The Visit Malaysia Year 1990 promotion is paying
dividends, with tourism to the country bringing in 2.5
billion ringgit ($926.5 million) during the first eight
months of the year, up from 1.8 billion ringgit for the same
period last year, Culture and Tourism Minister Sabaruddin
Chik said. The government had estimated that its overseas
promotional campaign would bring in only 2.5 billion ringgit
for the whole of 1990, Mr. Chik said.</p>
<p>CONTROVERSY IN NORWAY</p>
<p>Norway's Prime Minister Jan Syse stirred up a political
controversy Friday when he admitted to violating Norwegian
corporate law. Mr. Syse is chairman of a company that owns a
small apartment building in Oslo; the company failed to
comply with a rule that corporate accounts must be registered
each year with the Register of Company Accounts. Although no
one who has broken the rule has ever been taken to court, a
violation could in theory lead to a fine or up to a year in
jail. Opposition parties attacked the Conservative prime
minister, and the Socialist Left Party urged him to resign.</p>
<p>GREEN LIGHT FOR IBERIA</p>
<p>Spain's national airline Iberia was given the go-ahead by
the Spanish government to acquire Lufthansa's 48% stake in
the Spanish charter company Vuelos Internacionales de
Vacaciones S.A.</p>
<p>Spain's national airline will pay 840 million pesetas
($8.5 million) for the West German carrier's shareholding in
the charter company, raising to 96% its stake in Vuelos,
known as Viva Air. The remaining 4% of the shares are evenly
split between Spanish public financial-services company
Infoleasing and the West German tour operator A. Paukner.</p>
<p>Lufthansa officials said recently that a slump in Spanish
tourism drove the airline to sell its share in Viva Air. They
added that Lufthansa is eager to refocus its investments in
Eastern Europe.</p>
<p>Viva Air, which owns five Boeing 737300 airplanes and
holds two DC9-30 planes on lease, ranks as Spain's
second-largest charter company in terms of number of
passengers.</p>
<p>POSTSCRIPTS . . .</p>
<p>Czechoslovakia's Frantisek Cardinal Tomasek, an outspoken
advocate of religious freedom during decades of communist
control, is planning to retire within a month, the official
CTK news agency said. "The age of 91 is not normal for
activities in any field, including the church," CTK quoted
Czechoslovakia's senior Roman Catholic clergyman as saying. .
. . Foreign-ministry officials from Greece and Turkey will
meet in Ankara this week to try to start "a new dialogue,"
the Turkish Foreign Ministry said. The two nations have
wrangled for decades over Cyprus and territorial rights in
the Aegean Sea.</p>
