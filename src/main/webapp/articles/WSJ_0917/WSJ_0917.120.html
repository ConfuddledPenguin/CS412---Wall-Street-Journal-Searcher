	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- PolyGram NV said it will have satisfactory
increases in net sales and a "successful" 1990 year.
   Speaking to the New York Society of Security Analysts,
PolyGram officials would not disclose their expectations for
1990 earnings.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>David Fine, president and chief executive, told analysts
that he expects "very satisfactory increases in net sales"
for the year.</p>
<p>Chief Financial Officer Jan Cook said "we look forward to
a successful full year for PolyGram."</p>
<p>The Dutch music firm saw its earnings decline in the first
half of 1990 as it absorbed the costs of assimilating and
integrating Island International Ltd. and A & M Records Inc.
Both record companies were acquired by PolyGram in 1989.
PolyGram is 80%-owned by N.V. Philips</p>
<p>Fine said the acquisitions will help boost U.S. sales --
an area the company has targeted for much of its future
growth. He added the company's dominance in Europe will give
it an advantage in exploiting a growing East European music
market.</p>
