	<p class="article-leader">BETHESDA, Md. -- Scientists at the National Institutes of
Health began the first human-gene therapy experiment, taking
a step that many hope will change the face of medicine.
   A four-year-old girl suffering from a genetic disorder
called ADA deficiency, a rare and devastating malfunction of
the immune system, was given an infusion of cells containing
copies of a gene she lacks. She is missing the ADA gene,
which manufactures an enzyme that clears wastes from the
body. Scientists hope the adenosine deaminase genes they have
inserted into the unidentified girl's bloodstream will begin
producing the missing enzyme and rebuild her immune system.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>It will be several months before the doctors, French
Anderson of the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute, and
Michael Blaese and Kenneth Culver of the National Cancer
Institute, know whether, or how well, the experiment works.
But the initial infusion went well, scientists and the girl's
father said.</p>
<p>The doctors will monitor the patient, as well as several
other children who will have similar infusions later, to
learn how long the cells containing copies of the ADA gene
will survive in the girl's bloodstream and how much her
immune system improves.</p>
<p>An NIH panel cleared the path-breaking therapy in late
July after lengthy review and the Food and Drug
Administration gave its approval just hours before the
infusion Friday.</p>
<p>Gene therapy may ultimately help treat or cure a wide
range of diseases and disorders, including cancer, cystic
fibrosis, sickle cell anemia, certain types of arthritis and
some mental disorders.</p>
