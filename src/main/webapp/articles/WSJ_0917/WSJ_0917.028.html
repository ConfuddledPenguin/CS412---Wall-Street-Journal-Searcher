	<p class="article-leader">Ten minutes on the phone with Dr. Juice was all it took to
answer three of the eternal questions:
   1. Do fish sleep?</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>2. Can fish smell?</p>
<p>3. Why can't George Bush catch fish?</p>
<p>The first question actually could have been answered
without Dr. Juice's help. Readers willing to jump into the
ocean at night with a flashlight will see fish sleeping all
over the place. Parrotfish even wear nightgowns --
muumuu-shaped membranes that they store in their mouths when
they aren't asleep.</p>
<p>The second question: Not only can fish smell, they are
extraordinarily good at it, according to Dr. Juice, maker of
the world-renowned (in certain circles) Dr. Juice One Drop
Fish Scent and the brand new Dr. Juice Chewee Juice scent --
impregnated biodegradable crickets, mayflies, minnows and
crawfish. Dr. Juice happens to be the George Washington
Carver of biodegradable crickets.</p>
<p>Juice isn't his real name, of course. His parents named
him Gregory Bambenek, and he's a 42-year-old physician and
psychiatrist in Duluth, Minn., who is medical director at an
Indian reservation drug-treatment center and a county
nursing-home Alzheimer's-disease unit. He's also a crazed
fisherman who is president of Osmic Research Inc., where he
employs around 40 physically and mentally handicapped people
to make, bottle and package Dr. Juice products.</p>
<p>Osmic is where Dr. Juice also conducts his secret
fish-smelling experiments, in which he anesthetizes fish and
measures their nervous reactions to very dilute solutions --
say, one drop of some chemical in a 55-gallon barrel of
water.</p>
<p>Fish, he says, have "one of the most elaborate and
sensitive olfactory systems in nature." A really good hunting
dog can smell 1,000 times better than his master. And a fish
can smell 1,000 times better than that dog. You put one drop
of something in Lake Erie and some fish are so sensitive they
can smell it anywhere in the lake, he says.</p>
<p>Smart fishermen have used smells, or scents, to catch fish
for centuries, says Dr. Juice. Kings of England had their own
royal fishing scent makers.</p>
<p>Dr. Juice says he met a mysterious Indian medicine man in
Belize in 1978 who not only healed the sick but also caught
snook, tarpon and a local fish called bandarootoo with
nothing more than a hook, a line and a piece of cloth. It
turned out that what was on that cloth was a secret formula
of smells from jungle plants, fish and animals, which Dr.
Juice rushed home to analyze.</p>
<p>That same year Dr. Juice came out with a batch of his
first scent, made up of pheromones. He took a sex pheromone,
which turns fish on and attracts them; added a fear
pheromone, which tells big fish where scared little fish are;
and threw in for good measure some schooling pheromone, which
teaches fish their ABCs.</p>
<p>In the late '70s and early '80s, fishing scents took off.
Pretty soon, all sorts of companies smelling money had scents
out on the fishing-tackle market, which is a huge market,
according to Joe Kuti, who works for the American Fishing
Tackle Manufacturers Association: About 50 million fishermen
in this country spend about $2.2 billion a year on retail
fishing gear. They spend $450 million to $500 million on
fishing lures alone, Mr. Kuti guesses. They'll buy anything
with hooks that's dangled in front of them, but the plastic
worm is the largest part of the lure market. "It's an easy
lure to fish with. . . . It's kind of hard to screw up a
worm," Mr. Kuti says.</p>
<p>The rage these days is plastic worms with scents put
inside them in the factory. They're called "impregnated
baits," and they're made out of a soft polyvinyl chloride
called plastisol that oozes scents into the water for months.
Says In-Fisherman Magazine: "Scented baits will create more
fishing enthusiasm and catch more fish than any other lure
innovation in the 1990s."</p>
<p>But Dr. Juice says impregnated plastic baits are bad news.
They look, feel, smell and taste like food. Fish eat them. So
do birds, otters and other animals. The animals' stomachs
can't digest the plastic, so it sits there making the
creatures feel full. They stop eating and starve to death.
Dr. Juice talked to a veterinarian at Sea World in Orlando a
few years back and heard about people bringing in sick
otters. The vet flushed them with mineral oil and out came
all these red and green and yellow and blue plastic worms.</p>
<p>"We know they're killing birds and fish and mammals right
now," says Dr. Juice. "These things take hundreds of years to
biodegrade and fishermen lose tons of them every year."</p>
<p>Dr. Juice dumps on plastic worms not only because he's an
environmentalist but also because he smells profit in his new
non-plastic biodegradable worms and bugs. They're made out of
amino acids and whether or not they actually catch fish, they
do degrade. In a highly scientific experiment right here on
my desk, I put a plastic cricket and a Dr. Juice cricket in
some swamp water and sure enough, in two weeks, the Dr. Juice
cricket disintegrated into a blob of white goo on the bottom,
the plastic cricket was unchanged, and my co-workers stopped
coming by to schmooze.</p>
<p>If fish smell things they like, they also smell things
they don't like, says Dr. Juice. "The fish olfactory organ .
. . can detect repellent substances from man at a dilution of
one part per 80 billion."</p>
<p>This is where George Bush comes in. L-serine is a
repugnant amino acid secreted by people and other mammals
such as bears and sea lions. Fish fear and loathe it.
Professional bass fishermen secrete very little of it. George
Bush is a walking L-serine factory.</p>
<p>Dr. Juice knows this because he took Mr. Bush's
fingerprint at a 1988 fishing tackle show in Springfield,
Mo., and tested it.</p>
<p>"Bush is very high. He'd be about a 12, like me," Dr.
Juice says. That means George Bush repels fish. He's so high
in L-serine secretions that he should not bait his own hook
or anybody else's (such as Gorby's) because his fingerprint
on the bait will stink up the water with L-serine and send
fish zooming in the other direction. (Unless, of course, he
has a handy bottle of Dr. Juice Hand and Lure Cleaner. Only
$7.80.)</p>
