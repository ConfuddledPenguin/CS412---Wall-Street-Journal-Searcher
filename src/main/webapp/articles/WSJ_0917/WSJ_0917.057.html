	<p class="article-leader">Excerpts from former President Ronald Reagan's address
Saturday at the Gdansk Shipyard in Poland:</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>A little over 200 years ago, two Polish patriots helped us
in America make our world anew. My country had just been
born. Its guiding idea was that men and women could govern
themselves, free of foreign domination or influence. A
skeptical world said the experiment would fail, but that did
not deter these two men who had already struggled against
foreign domination here in Poland.</p>
<p>Thus it was that a brilliant engineer, Thaddeus Kosciusko,
and a daring cavalry commander, Casimir Pulaski, joined the
American War of Independence and performed heroic deeds. They
were among those who made it possible for the fragile flower
of democracy to survive and bloom in American soil.</p>
<p>Now, thousands of patriots have been making the world anew
once again. I am speaking of all of you here, the men and
women of Solidarity who, in just 10 years since the founding
of your movement, have brought about the end of communism's
stifling embrace.</p>
<p>You have restored Polish independence from outside
influence. You have successfully led the struggle for free,
open and democratic elections. You have paved the way for a
market economy to replace the failed efforts of centralized
planning and control. You have triggered vast changes in the
political map of Central and Eastern Europe. One might say
this is the shipyard that launched a half dozen revolutions]</p>
<p>Today, Solidarity leads the Polish government and the
people -- and it all began here 10 years ago. Those 10 years
brought hardship and heartache for most of you. To some it
brought death. It brought obstacles and reversals. But you
never lost hope. You stand as proof of the basic human truth
that when men and women thirst for freedom and democracy,
their thirst will not be quenched until their goal is
achieved. You of Solidarity have now achieved it.</p>
<p>But the goal of freedom and democracy was only the first
goal to be achieved -- a prelude to something even greater:
the rejuvenation of your country. You began that process with
a bold move on the first of January this year. You eliminated
price controls and most subsidies. You replaced the old
communist credit system with a monetary system. So far there
are a number of positive results:</p>
<p>-- You stopped inflation in its tracks and have rolled it
back.</p>
<p>-- Your stores are filled with goods today and there are
no more long lines.</p>
<p>-- The black market is a memory.</p>
<p>-- Most important for your future foreign trade, you have
created the first convertible currency in the former
Communist Bloc of countries.</p>
<p>With the bold economic moves you knew there would be some
pain. We have a saying, "no pain, no gain."</p>
<p>Still, pain is pain if your buying power has declined or
you are out of work. In the U.S. we believe strongly in
people helping people. This time, it is our turn to help the
new Poland. Here are a few examples:</p>
<p>-- Since July, 29 containers of medical supplies from U.S.
Department of Defense stocks in Europe have been delivered to
Polish hospitals, orphanages and old people's homes. The
shipments were organized by a U.S. citizens' group, the
Emergency Committee for Aid to Poland.</p>
<p>-- Early this year, at the request of your Ministry of
Labor, the same U.S. committee arranged for American
corporations to contribute 50 tons of specialized infant
formula.</p>
<p>-- In June, 60 volunteers from the U.S. Peace Corps
arrived to teach English.</p>
<p>-- Soon, mid-level managers of Polish business enterprises
will be able to learn the latest marketing and management
practices at a special exchange program at New York
University, organized by the Institute for East-West Business
Dynamics, a non-profit U.S. group.</p>
<p>-- In Cracow, Project Hope, the principal U.S. sponsor of
the American Children's Hospital there, is nearing completion
of a large ambulatory care center. In the course of its
16-year-old program here in Poland, Project Hope has
sponsored visits by nearly 500 Polish medical professionals
to the U.S. and visits to Poland by more than 1,600 of Hope's
volunteer health-care specialists. And, for the past two
years, Project Hope's health economists and policy analysts
have worked closely with your Ministry of Health in
developing plans for reform of the health-care delivery
system.</p>
<p>Just as long as help is wanted, Americans will be there to
provide it. In the long run, however, it is you, the people
of Poland, who will solve your economic problems through
self-help.</p>
<p>I have had a little experience in the matter of economic
growth, so I hope you won't mind if I share with you some of
what I've learned.</p>
<p>First, there are two schools of thought about how to
achieve lasting economic health and growth. One believes you
get it only through severe austerity and belt-tightening. The
other believes you achieve it by getting government out of
the way so that the people themselves can create and find
opportunities. I confess that I side with that second school
of thought, the one that believes in incentives for growth.
We used that approach when my administration took office and
it is still working under President Bush's leadership.</p>
<p>You have done away with price controls, for they create
false shortages and inhibit growth. Wage controls thwart
growth, too. Do away with wage controls and the more
efficient, growth-minded businesses will pay more, attract
good people and keep on growing. Inefficient enterprises will
either wither and die or find ways to become competitive.</p>
<p>Ownership is another great incentive for economic growth.
If you own your own business you will work hard to make it do
well. If your customers are satisfied with your goods and
services, they will come back. Thus, there is the closest of
connections between the effort you put into it and the
rewards you get out of it.</p>
<p>Western banks might find it worthwhile to take a good look
at including in their plans a fund for lending to small
start-up businesses here in Poland. I understand that there
is quite a lot of what we call "mattress money" tucked away.
If you put a little credit together with a little mattress
money, you could open up a great many bakeries, butcher
shops, small factories and repair services all over Poland.</p>
<p>The privatization bill recently enacted by your government
will reduce the number of state monopolies, and that is good,
for they will be replaced by enterprises that must be
competitive. As inefficient ones are scaled down or closed,
however, the challenge is to find new jobs for workers laid
off.</p>
<p>Your current level of unemployment, 5.2%, would not be
very worrisome in the West. We have "safety nets," consisting
of unemployment compensation insurance, retraining programs
and employment placement services for workers who are laid
off. I understand the U.S. Department of Labor is working
with your Ministry of Labor to create a similar safety net
for Polish workers.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, what about the workers in those state
monopolies that are being put up for sale? I am reminded of a
technique for employee ownership that has worked well for
many U.S. companies. It goes by various names, but the best
known is "Employee Stock Ownership Program," or ESOP. With
such a program, the employees create a trust which borrows
money from a bank to buy shares of stock in the company. The
loan is paid back over several years from the employees'
share of the company's profits.</p>
<p>How can they be sure the company will be profitable? The
workers, as owners, make sure by insisting that unprofitable
or obsolete products be replaced by new ones; that operating
costs be kept down; and that new efficiencies of operation
are adopted. When a person owns assets he or she will look
after them.</p>
<p>When people believe in something, they can make it work.
Just as a pair of Polish patriots helped America make the
seeds of its democracy flower, so you of Solidarity have
planted those same seeds in Poland. You have nurtured them
and seen them grow. Now, you have it within you to make them
blossom far, far into the future and to bring renewed vigor
to your nation.</p>
