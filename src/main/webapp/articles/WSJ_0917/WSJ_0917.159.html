	<p class="article-leader">Stock investors only have eyes for oil.
   Ever since Saddam Hussein lit a fuse under the Middle East
tinderbox on Aug. 2, the oil market has been shoving stocks
around. Mainly down, as was the case again Friday: The Dow
Jones Industrial Average sank 18.56 points to 2564.11, while
the October crude oil futures contract rose 69 cents to
$31.76 a barrel.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Since the invasion of Kuwait six weeks ago, the industrial
average has moved counter to oil prices on 22 of 30 trading
days. Of those moves, the industrial average fell -- and oil
rose -- more than half the time, or 14 days. On the days when
the predominant pattern didn't hold, changes in both the
industrial average and oil prices were mostly small.</p>
<p>In a sense, oil simply has become the latest obsession of
stock investors, who love to seize upon an economic indicator
or some other windsock to point the direction they should run
in. Over the past year, the stock market has on occasion been
dominated for days and even weeks by bond yields, the monthly
employment report and inflation indexes, among other things.</p>
<p>"Wall Street tries to make things very simple," says Al
Goldman, director of market analysis at A.G. Edwards. "It's a
one-note street. But if one makes the mistake of following
that one note, you miss many critical factors. Admittedly, as
with oil, the myopic view often works -- but only on a very
short-term basis."</p>
<p>But to credit the market monomaniacs with certain good
judgment, oil prices dovetail closely with the major issues
on investors' minds: inflation, economic growth or recession,
and corporate profits.</p>
<p>"Inflation is the single most negative variable for
financial instruments," says A.C. Moore, research director at
Argus Research, "and the price of oil is the single most
important element. It affects pricing for everything.
Secondly, oil-price increases translate into diminished
demand throughout the economy. There's lots of justification
for being fixated on oil. It's not a phantom worry."</p>
<p>Trouble is, when the obsession of the month is expressed
in a price, such as oil, the stock market tends to be yanked
around by those investors who are most sensitive to price --
namely, speculators. The impact of rising oil prices is felt
first in that part of the stock market that is most like a
commodity-stock-index futures.</p>
<p>With buy and sell programs, jumps in energy prices are
telegraphed to the New York Stock Exchange through the
Chicago futures markets. "Nobody is going to pull or make a
bid based on the price of oil; but it is affecting the
{futures} market, which causes programs" in stocks, says
Michael LaBranche IV, managing partner at a Big Board
specialist company, LaBranche & Co.</p>
<p>Some advisers suggest investors try to take advantage of
the volatility. "When good companies get sold with the bad,
an investor can use that as a chance to buy or add to a
position," says Mr. Moore of Argus. He likes energy stocks
and shares of growth companies with large interests overseas,
such as the 48% of revenue and profit that Minnesota Mining &
Manufacturing gets from foreign operations.</p>
<p>Joseph J. McAlinden, director of equity research at Dillon
Read, also recommends playing the market's daily ups and
downs in pursuit of a longer-term strategy. He thinks
inflation is going to reaccelerate significantly, partly
because of oil prices but also because he predicts a much
looser monetary policy in the months ahead.</p>
<p>This scenario is bad for the bond market and a mixed bag
for the stock market, he says. Companies that do well in
inflationary periods will see their stocks rise, and vice
versa. "Overall," he asserts, "the stock market will get
pulled higher over the next three to six months," led by
energy, basic industries such as metals and stocks of
companies that benefit from increased capital spending.</p>
<p>Specifically, Mr. McAlinden likes Oryx Energy, a Dallas
company with significant oil interests in the North Atlantic,
and Burlington Resources, a natural-gas play.
Capital-spending stocks he favors: CBI Industries, an Oak
Brook, Ill., company that builds pressurized tanks for gas
and oil, and Motorola, which is big in semiconductors and
cellular telephones. Among natural-resource concerns, he
recommends Amax, a metals producer.</p>
<p>If you believe in these plays, he says, buy them on days
when inflation fears subside; and sit on your hands on days
when oil prices -- and inflation fears -- rise.</p>
<p>Ellen Harris, chief domestic investment officer of
PaineWebber mutual funds, suggests investors look at stocks
whose ability to earn fatter profits aren't vulnerable to oil
shocks. A favorite is Waste Management, and biotechnology
stocks such as Chiron and Genetics Institute. "Their growth
isn't affected by the events going on" in the Middle East,
she says.</p>
<p>Fred Moran, president of Moran Asset Management, thinks
investors should insulate themselves against recession in the
U.S. as well as against the oil shock. He is avoiding
cyclical groups such as airlines, autos and retailers and
buying stocks of companies that generate sales no matter how
slow the economy, such as cellular telephone and cable
television concerns.</p>
<p>"When there was a recession in Dallas and Houston,
cellular prospered as well there as anywhere in the country,"
he says. "Telecommunications grows even in a recession, or if
oil prices are high." Among his favorites are McCaw Cellular,
Associated Communications and Jones Intercable.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>Friday's Market Activity</p>
<p>Evidence of growing tensions in the Persian Gulf and
sluggishness in the U.S. economy weighed down the stock
market and prices closed broadly lower.</p>
<p>The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 18.56 to 2564.11,
with 1,008 issues declining and 472 advancing.</p>
<p>Among broader market indexes, Standard & Poor's 500-stock
index dropped 1.82 to 316.83, the New York Stock Exchange
composite index slipped 1.01 to 174.15 and the Dow Jones
Equity Market Index fell 1.78 to 293.61.</p>
<p>Some 133,390,000 shares traded on the New York Stock
Exchange -- the highest total since Aug. 27 -- but the
pattern of lackluster activity since the end of last month
remained intact as many institutions stayed out of the
market.</p>
<p>For the week, the Dow Jones Industrial Average posted a
decline of 55.44 points, or 2.1%. The S&P 500 and the Dow
Jones Equity Market Index each dropped 2%, while the Big
Board's composite index fell 1.9%.</p>
<p>Prices headed lower from the opening bell as the market
responded to the report on August producer prices, which rose
sharply as expected, and other data on the economy's
performance last month that proved mildly disappointing.</p>
<p>The producer price index jumped 1.3% last month, well
within market forecasts, as a result of the steep increase in
energy prices following Iraqi's invasion of Kuwait. But
despite sharply higher sales at gasoline stations, retail
sales fell 0.6% in August; additionally, industrial
production fell 0.2% and capacity utilization dropped to
83.1% in August from 83.5% in July.</p>
<p>A sell-off in Digital Equipment gained momentum, with the
stock falling to its lowest level in about five years.
Digital, the most active Big Board issue, dropped 2 7/8 to 56
3/8 on trading of 2.2 million shares. Digital traded as low
as 54 3/8.</p>
<p>The latest round of selling took place after Cowen & Co.
slashed its estimate of the company's fiscal 1991 earnings by
$2.85 a share, to $4.15. Analyst Richard S. Chu told Dow
Jones Professional Investor Report the sharp revision
reflects increasing concerns about the economic outlook and
about Digital's current midrange computer line. Several
analysts had lowered earnings estimates earlier last week as
the company made downbeat presentations at two investment
conferences.</p>
<p>LSI Logic tumbled 1 to 6 7/8 after Prudential-Bache
Securities cut its earnings estimates for this year and next
by 10 cents a share to 50 cents and $1.20, respectively. But
a number of other technology issues bucked the market's
slide; Compaq Computer gained 7/8 to 44 1/8, Cray Research
went up 1/4 to 35 3/8, Texas Instruments climbed 1 to 28 1/4
and Motorola rose 1 5/8 to 63.</p>
<p>Deere fell 2 3/8 to 51 1/8 and Tenneco dropped 1 7/8 to 52
1/8. Oppenheimer & Co. cut 1991 earnings estimates on the two
concerns and removed the stocks from its list of recommended
issues. Additionally, Wertheim Schroder lowered its forecast
of Deere's 1991 earnings from $6.35 a share to a range of $5
to $6.35.</p>
<p>Westinghouse Electric fell 1 5/8 to 29 7/8 on 1.1 million
shares. PaineWebber lowered the stock's investment rating
from "attractive" to "neutral" and cut its 1991 earnings
estimate by 10 cents a share, to $3.60, to reflect the
company's new forecast of a recession beginning later this
year.</p>
<p>Energy stocks closed mixed as oil prices reacted to the
Mideast developments. Exxon gained 5/8 to 51 3/8, Chevron
fell 1/8 to 75 7/8, Texaco rose 1/8 to 65 1/2, Mobil eased
1/8 to 65 1/2 and Atlantic Richfield added 1 1/8 to 139 7/8.</p>
<p>The precious metals sector, benefiting from higher gold
prices, fared even better.</p>
<p>Battle Mountain Gold added 3/8 to 10 5/8, Placer Dome
gained 1/2 to 17 1/8, Homestake Mining climbed 3/8 to 19 7/8
and American Barrick Resources rose 1/2 to 21 3/8.</p>
<p>Chemical Banking fell 5/8 to 20 1/4 as 1.7 million shares
changed hands. Speculation has surfaced recently that the
company may be about to close its operations in Switzerland;
Chemical has declined to comment on those rumors.</p>
<p>Prime Motor Inns declined 3/8 to 1 3/8 on 1.7 million
shares. The company said it asked its bank lenders to
restructure its debt and to provide an additional $25 million
in loans, adding that it could file for Chapter 11
bankruptcy-law protection if an agreement can't be reached.
Prime Motor Inns L.P., from which the company leases several
hotels, fell 7/8 to 3 1/4.</p>
<p>Olin dropped 2 7/8 to 37 1/8. The company said it expects
to post earnings of about $5 a share this year, below both
analysts' estimates and the company's previous forecasts.</p>
<p>Manpower rose 5/8 to 11 1/8. The company agreed to sell
five British-based units to Brook Opportunities, a new
company, for about $200 million and will also receive a 15%
stake in Brook.</p>
<p>The American Stock Exchange Market Value Index dropped
0.56 to 321.45, bringing its loss for the week to 0.7%.</p>
<p>Energy Service, the most active Amex issue, rose 1/8 to 3
5/8. The company, together with R.D. Smith & Co., agreed to
sell 33 oil drilling rigs belonging to Penrod Corp. for $14.9
million to Diamond M Holding.</p>
<p>Ackerley Communications rose 1/2 to 3 1/4. Business Week
magazine reported that one money manager, Starmont Capital's
Michael Seyfert, is estimating the company's net asset value
at $15 a share, while portfolio manager Harvey Sandler puts
the figure at more than $20 a share.</p>
