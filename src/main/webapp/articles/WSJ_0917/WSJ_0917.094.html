	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- As the market for new issues sinks, investors
are crowding into one of the few lifeboats left: new
offerings of oil-service companies.
   Fans of the stocks argue that even if oil prices ease next
year, these companies that provide geological research,
equipment and other services for oil drilling will still
outperform both the market and the major oil companies.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>There is reason for investors to be finicky. Increased
exploration for oil around the world is tempting some
marginal, as well as strong, companies to raise money on Wall
Street.</p>
<p>"You want to take a long, hard look at the companies
coming public now," says Miles J. Cohen, a portfolio manager
for Norwest Bank Minnesota, in Minneapolis. Smaller companies
could suffer in an industry increasingly dominated by such
giants as Baker Hughes Inc., Dresser Industries Inc.,
Halliburton Co. and Schlumberger Ltd. "Unless they have a
particular niche, they'll have a tough time," says Mr. Cohen.</p>
<p>But investors who haven't yet climbed on the energy
bandwagon may find some bargains among better-quality new
issues. "The trends are still going in your favor," advises
Anthony Socci, energy sector analyst for Dreyfus Corp., New
York.</p>
<p>Barring sudden peace in the Mideast, oil prices are
expected to stay high enough to stimulate increased
exploration and production. By November, prices could climb
to $35 a barrel for West Texas Intermediate crude oil, says
William H. Brown III, oil analyst at Kidder, Peabody & Co.
However, as new supplies flow, prices could fall to the low
20s within a year, Mr. Brown predicts. That drop should hurt
the stocks of major oil companies more than oil-service
stocks, he adds.</p>
<p>At worst, oil-service stocks could drop 10% to 15% over
the next two years if oil prices collapse, estimates James
Carroll, oil-service analyst for PaineWebber Inc. More
likely, he thinks oil stocks will rise 50% to 100% during
that period as companies scramble to keep up with new
exploration and production. That ascent "will be filled with
plenty of potholes" as stocks react to fluctuating oil
prices, he warns.</p>
<p>New issues, some of them already priced at 10% to 15%
discounts to existing oil-service stocks, could become
cheaper as investment bankers try to please investors
frightened by the crumbling new issues market, Mr. Carroll
adds. "From the standpoint of the buyer, it's a wonderful
time to look at new deals," he says.</p>
<p>Among the oil-service IPOs scheduled for a debut this fall
are:</p>
<p>Grant-Norpac: At an expected $10 to $12 apiece,
Grant-Norpac's four million shares will be reasonably priced
based on the seismic company's estimated 1991 earnings of 80
cents to $1 a share, says Mr. Socci. None of the Houston
company's insiders are selling, which tells Mr. Socci "they
don't think this is the top" for the shares. Grant-Norpac
collects, processes and markets seismic data for land-based
oil exploration, and ranks number five among such companies.
More than 60% of revenue comes from overseas -- none in Iraq
or Kuwait. Risks include currency fluctuations and political
uncertainty. Underwriters are Salomon Brothers Inc. and
Howard, Weil, Labouisse, Friedrichs.</p>
<p>Moorco: At an indicated range of $10 to $12 a share,
Moorco's initial offering looks attractive to Robert Natale,
emerging-growth stock analyst for Standard & Poor's Corp. The
Houston company makes fluid measurement and pressure control
products for the energy industry. Moorco estimates 1991
earnings at $1 a share, according to Mr. Natale, putting its
price-to-earnings multiple below that of a similar public
company, Daniel Industries. Moorco will offer four million
common shares as insiders sell two million; proceeds will be
used to redeem preferred shares and reduce debt. Underwriters
are PaineWebber Inc. and Wertheim Schroder & Co.</p>
<p>Input/Output: Currently a subsidiary of Triton Energy
Corp., the Stafford, Texas, maker of seismic data acquisition
systems depends heavily on sales of its $2 million system. In
1990, 84% of revenue came from selling this system. Triton
will own 28% after an offering of 3.2 million shares by
Triton and 1.7 million shares by the company, at an indicated
range of $9 to $11 apiece. Mr. Natale is leery of the
reliance on one big-ticket item, saying there are too many
uncertainties for him. "You really have to be careful,"
agrees one West Coast money manager. "There's no way to know
if a company will lose or gain a contract." Underwriters are
PaineWebber and Salomon.</p>
<p>Vetco Gray: The Houston maker of oil exploration and
production equipment is planning an initial offering of nine
million shares at an indicated $17 to $19 apiece to buy back
a controlling interest held by Bain Venture Capital. The
heavy insider selling by the venture capitalists "throws up a
caution flag" for Mr. Natale. "If this is such a good
investment, why are these people pulling $118 million out?"
he asks. Nonetheless, he says he advised investors to buy the
offering if shares can be had for $15. Combustion Engineering
will increase its 20% stake as a result of the offering.
Underwriters are Salomon and Shearson Lehman Brothers.</p>

<p>Friday's Market Activity</p>
<p>Over-the-counter stocks again fell prey to increased
tensions in the Mideast and worries about the economy.</p>
<p>The Nasdaq Composite Index fell 1.76 to 374.42, a 0.5%
loss, as volume eased to 103.5 million shares from 105.7
million shares Thursday. Declining shares overpowered
advancing stocks, 1,072 to 739; 196 stocks fell to new lows
and only 15 climbed to new highs.</p>
<p>Adobe Systems, the day's third most active stock, fell 1
1/4 to 26 7/8 on 1.4 million shares, although the software
systems company reported that earnings for the third quarter
ended Aug. 31 rose to 45 cents a share from 41 cents a share
a year earlier.</p>
<p>Without a one-time, $3 million royalty payment by a
vendor, Adobe's third-quarter earnings would have been about
38 cents to 41 cents a share, according to Shearson Lehman
Brothers analyst David S. Nelson. Mr. Nelson, who maintains a
"buy" opinion on Adobe, told Dow Jones Professional Investor
Report he cut his estimates for the Mountain View, Calif.,
company's fourth-quarter and full-year earnings.</p>
<p>Western Publishing Group fell 5/8 to 13 7/8 after the New
York publisher reported that earnings for the second quarter
ended Aug. 4 fell to four cents a share from six cents a
share a year earlier. The latest quarter included a one-time
charge of three cents a share for acquisition costs.</p>
<p>Kentucky Medical Insurance eased 1/4 to 10 after falling
from a Sept. 7 close of 17 1/2. The Louisville provider of
medical liability insurance said it appeared that a large
stockholder was forced to sell shares to meet margin
requirements. Kentucky Medical said the stockholder isn't
related to the company or its principals.</p>
