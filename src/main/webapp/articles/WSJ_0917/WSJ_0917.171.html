	<p class="article-leader">CHICAGO -- A federal court turned down Ferruzzi
Finanziaria S.p.A.'s request for a restraining order to
prevent the Chicago Board of Trade from undertaking
disciplinary proceedings against the Italian concern.
   The CBOT said its Business Conduct Committee will decide
next week, as scheduled, on charges that the Milan grain
merchant attempted to manipulate the soybean market in 1989.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Ferruzzi said it was "disappointed" by the ruling but
noted that the petition was only "the first step" in seeking
judicial redress of what it called the CBOT's "unfair
treatment."</p>
<p>Ferruzzi had filed two suits. One alleged that the CBOT
violated antitrust and commodities law when it issued a 1989
order that forced soybean traders to close out their
positions. That order forced Ferruzzi to liquidate a
potentially lucrative long, or buying, market position in
soybean futures, whose value had climbed because of a
drought.</p>
<p>Ferruzzi claimed the exchange issued the order not in
response to a market emergency, but to protect companies
affiliated with CBOT board members from suffering big losses
because they were holding short, or selling, positions.</p>
<p>The second suit alleged that the CBOT, because of a
conflict of interest, shouldn't be allowed to render judgment
on Ferruzzi involving the 1989 soybean-market activities. It
was the latter suit that asked the court to block the
disciplinary hearing which was ruled on; the litigation
alleging the CBOT acted wrongfully remains pending.</p>
<p>The CBOT has denied any wrongdoing.</p>
<p>In a prepared statement Friday, the CBOT said it is
"pleased that the federal court has reaffirmed the exchange's
responsibility and right to conduct investigations of
violations of its rules and to take disciplinary action in
defense of the integrity of our markets."</p>
