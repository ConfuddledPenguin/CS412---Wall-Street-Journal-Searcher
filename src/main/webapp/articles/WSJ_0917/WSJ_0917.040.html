	<p class="article-leader">High levels of aflatoxin were discovered in the milk of a
Georgia processor, according to state Agriculture
Commissioner Tommy Irvin.
   The discovery is the first sign that the Georgia corn crop
might have been contaminated by the potent carcinogen, which
is excreted by a soil fungus under droughtlike conditions.
After the nationwide drought in 1988, contaminated milk in
several states was traced to dairy cows that had been
unknowingly fed aflatoxin-laced corn.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The threat to consumers isn't clear. Mr. Irvin said that
1,395 gallons of milk from the unidentified processor were
destroyed long before it reached stores. But Georgia milk
processors face a difficult year. The early indication is
that aflatoxin might be widespread in the state's corn crop,
much of which is fed to livestock.</p>
<p>Of 45 Georgia corn fields recently surveyed for state and
federal authorities, about 60% were found to have aflatoxin
in excess of the amount considered safe for human
consumption.</p>
<p>Because of the region's warm climate, corn grown in the
South is the most vulnerable in the nation to aflatoxin
outbreaks. Crop experts have been worried about the chances
of an aflatoxin outbreak in Georgia since an intense hot and
dry spell damaged much of the corn crop in June.</p>
<p>Aflatoxin is a carcinogen in laboratory rats and has been
linked to human liver cancer in Asia and Africa. For more
than a decade, the poison has been detected in Southerners
and doctors have debated whether it is a serious health
hazard.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, aflatoxin was detected by officials in
Texas corn corps, the second such outbreak there in as many
years.</p>
<p>The most serious aflatoxin outbreak occurred during the
1988 drought that seared the Midwest. Dairy farmers in six
states dumped milk, and authorities detected the poison in
milled corn and such products as popcorn and cereal.</p>
