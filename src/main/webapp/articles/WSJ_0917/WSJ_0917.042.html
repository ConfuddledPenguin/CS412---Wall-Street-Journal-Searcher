	<p class="article-leader">DALLAS -- Former thrift owner Laurence Vineyard Jr. was
sentenced to five years in federal prison for defrauding the
defunct Vernon Savings Association, Dallas, of $2.6 million,
much of which was used to buy a mansion for Mr. Vineyard's
family.
   The purchase of the home tangled thrift regulators'
efforts to recoup the Vernon funds because Texas law protects
homesteads, regardless of value, from creditors. The law was
the subject of a page one article in this newspaper last
December.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Mr. Vineyard recently agreed to sell his $1,180,000 home
and use the proceeds to begin repaying $17 million he
borrowed from Vernon Savings, according to Steven Hoard, an
Amarillo, Texas, lawyer who represented the Federal Deposit
Insurance Corp. in its collection efforts.</p>
<p>Mr. Vineyard had borrowed the money from Vernon to repay
earlier loans for his purchase of the now-defunct Key Savings
& Loan Association of Englewood, Colo. Mr. Vineyard was
convicted in 1987 of fraud charges related to the Key Savings
purchase and sentenced to five years in federal prison. He
has nearly completed that sentence.</p>
<p>The new five-year prison sentence was handed down last
week by U.S. District Judge Joe Fish of Dallas. Mr. Vineyard
had pleaded guilty in July to defrauding Vernon by using
funds he borrowed from the thrift to purchase his home, pay
his lawyers and establish trust funds for his children.</p>
<p>"That wasn't what it was supposed to be used for," Mr.
Hoard said. "It was supposed to be used to pay off debt he
had incurred in purchasing Key Savings."</p>
<p>Judge Fish ordered Mr. Vineyard to repay the $2.6 million
as part of his sentence. Those funds will be added to the
funds from the sale of his home and to the money to be
returned from the Vineyard children's trust accounts. Mr.
Hoard said negotiations are continuing on repayment of the
fees to Mr. Vineyard's lawyers.</p>
<p>But Mr. Hoard noted that the chances of Mr. Vineyard's
repaying the entire $17 million he borrowed from Vernon are
slim. Mr. Vineyard, 41 years old, was stripped of his law
license two years ago as a result of the Key Savings
conviction and has said he intends to work as an electrician,
a trade he learned in federal prison.</p>
