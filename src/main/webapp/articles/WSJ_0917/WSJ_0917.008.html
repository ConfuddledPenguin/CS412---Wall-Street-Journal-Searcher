	<p class="article-leader">Some anguished home sellers are looking for a miracle,
sort of.
   So don't be alarmed if one dark night you spot your
neighbors digging a hole and burying a statue of St. Joseph.
They're only seeking a little saintly assistance in a buyer's
market.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Joanne Walker, a real-estate broker in South Bend, Ind.,
reports that one of her customers got two offers on a house
the first Saturday after burying St. Joseph in the yard. The
customer had been trying to sell for almost a year.</p>
<p>If the connection between St. Joseph and real estate
leaves non-Catholics scratching their heads, they aren't
alone. Even the church is a bit mystified.</p>
<p>The Rev. John McSpiritt, who presides over the St. Joseph
Shrine in Stirling, N.J., says he learned of the practice
from members of his former parish in rural Georgia. He hasn't
the slightest idea how it got started. "I call it a `pious
practice,'" he offers. "There's no theology behind it."</p>
<p>Real-estate agents who have seen St. Joseph go underground
explain that as a carpenter and the husband of Mary, mother
of Jesus, Joseph is the archetypal provider and guardian of
the hearth.</p>
<p>With no guidelines from the Vatican on how to lay the
saint to rest, conflicting methods have emerged:</p>
<p>Upside down, facing the house, "in a gracious area -- not
next to the garbage cans," says Ms. Walker. Upside down is
one preference, in the garden is another, says Father
McSpiritt.</p>
<p>"In some kind of box, to keep something from happening to
him," says Eva Kruse, who sells religious articles at LaSalle
Bookstore in South Bend. "Oh, no, no, no. You can't leave it
in the box," says Maplewood, N.J., broker Joan Dirken.</p>
<p>One point of agreement: When you sell the house, you dig
him up, dust him off, and display him in a prominent place in
your new home.</p>
<p>The practice has clearly expanded beyond the devout.
Patrons of a gift shop adjoining the New Jersey shrine have
been carrying off St. Josephs by the armloads, according to
saleswoman Marie Murray, who is selling as many as 100 a
week.</p>
<p>When Fort Lee, N.J., broker Michael Ignatieff heard about
St. Joseph's powers, he went to a florist specializing in
funerals and picked up a dozen cheap plaster versions to
offer his customers.</p>
<p>"I'm not even Catholic," he concedes. "It's another
gimmick we're trying. It's another marketing tool."</p>
