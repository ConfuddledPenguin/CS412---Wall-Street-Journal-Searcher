	<p class="article-leader">BONN -- Chancellor Helmut Kohl's decision to provide about
$2 billion to support military operations in the Gulf has
underscored Germany's emergence as a world power, and the
resulting costs and demands of that role.
   West Germany's package of assistance, considerably more
than Washington had sought, may have silenced U.S. critics
who had derisively compared Bonn's reluctance to provide
significant help for the Gulf with its agreement last week to
pay the Soviets some 12 billion marks (about $7.5 billion) to
finance their troop withdrawal from East Germany. West German
officials increased the size of the aid to send a clear
message that they intended to accept the responsibilities of
their growing international role.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"Without doubt, a Germany that has 17 million more
inhabitants (raising its population to nearly 80 million)
will have greater weight -- politically and economically,"
said West German Foreign Minister Hans Dietrich Genscher in
an interview shortly before Mr. Kohl announced his decision.
"The future will show what is already clear now -- that the
unification of Germany doesn't create a problem but rather
that it helps to solve other problems."</p>
<p>Bonn's decision to provide more money for the Gulf,
however, was as much a response to international pressure as
a considered strategy. A wide range of political agreements
with the Soviet Union in recent weeks have left critics
wondering whether Bonn wasn't forgetting other obligations.</p>
<p>West Germany still won't send combat troops to the Gulf,
citing constitutional restrictions, but it has compensated
with a string of other measures. It will provide 1.6 billion
marks in direct financial help to the U.S. and a billion
marks for military equipment including vehicles, radio
equipment, water tankers, cranes and equipment to protect
soldiers against chemical attack. West Germany also will
provide aid to countries that have been hardest-hit by the
trade embargo and the resultant flood of refugees: 400
million marks in aid to Egypt, 200 million marks to Jordan
and 110 million marks to Turkey.</p>
<p>Many countries now appear eager to accept a more
influential Germany. The end of the Cold War, Soviet economic
decline and the growing U.S. budgetary constraints have left
many countries in the world knocking on Bonn's door for
assistance.</p>
<p>Soviet officials, who are betting on Germany's assurances,
have made Germany's political ascendance all the more certain
by proposing that the country, after its unification on Oct.
3, become the sixth permanent member of the United Nations
Security Council. Germany should return to world politics as
a "modern great power," said Nikolai Portugalov, the German
affairs adviser to Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev.</p>
<p>The rapid changes of recent months have left Mr. Genscher,
the world's longest-serving foreign minister (16 years), with
the task of designing policies to maximize his country's
influence while reducing any apprehensions about a resurgent
Germany. In a wide-ranging interview in his office next to
the Rhine, talking over the sound of cargo ships passing by
the window, he coined a phrase to describe the evolving
approach: "policy by example."</p>
<p>"Setting an example is the opposite of striving for
power," he said, musing about the future with five
journalists from five countries.</p>
<p>In outlining his priorities, Mr. Genscher said Germany
would "set an example" in the following ways:</p>
<p>-- European Union: He wants his neighbors to think more
about European integration and worry less about German power.
Mr. Genscher's goal is still to create a common European
currency at the same time as a single European market,
despite recent reservations expressed by West Germany's
central bank president and finance minister. "We won't get
all the advantages of the power of a single market if we all
have different economic, currency and finance policies," said
Mr. Genscher. He said West Germany's economic miracle never
could have happened if not for the decision of the three
Western occupying powers in 1948 to create a single currency
for their occupation zones. Mr. Genscher said he would
campaign for the establishment of a European Central Bank in
Frankfurt.</p>
<p>-- Eastern Europe: He said Germany, with its Western
partners, would endeavor to prevent new economic divisions
from replacing the old ideological divisions. However,
Western diplomats say Mr. Genscher is unhappy that other
countries haven't provided more in the way of financing. "We
don't want to monopolize policies toward Eastern Europe," he
said.</p>
<p>-- The U.S.: Perhaps as early as October, Mr. Genscher
would like European Community foreign ministers to work out a
"trans-Atlantic declaration" with the U.S. It would be a
statement of principles, not unlike the one reached between
the Soviet Union and Germany early this year, that would
define the European-U.S. relationship for the future. Its
intention also would be to focus Washington more on ties with
the European Community instead and not just individual
countries.</p>
<p>-- The Soviet Union: Mr. Genscher derides those who still
harbor any suspicions about Bonn's relationship with the
Soviet Union or unduly question the large amounts of aid the
country has been willing to pay to gain Moscow's agreement to
unification and troop withdrawal. He said Western officials
who have worried that Germany would sell out to the Soviet
"have grown gray and retired." He cautioned against
continuing to view Europe politically in terms of East and
West. "We have to be careful when looking into the future not
to use yesterday's vocabulary," he says.</p>
<p>Does Mr. Genscher fear that his vision of Germany and its
role in a unified Europe might be lost if he disappears from
the scene? He's confident Bonn's policies will be continued.
Pointing to opinion polls that consistently rank him the most
popular of West German politicians, he says: "It isn't
because of my good looks."</p>
