	<p class="article-leader">TUCSON, Ariz. -- Arizona Public Service Co., the main unit
of Pinnacle West Capital Corp., said it will eliminate about
675 more jobs this year, or 14% of its 4,908-member
non-nuclear work force.
   The belt-tightening move is part of a process begun in
1988 and accelerated in June, when the company undertook an
intensive review designed to make it leaner and more
competitive with other energy suppliers.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The cutbacks affect 60 managers and supervisors, 315
clerical and professional workers, and 300 union employees,
the company said. About 400 positions have already been
eliminated this year, mainly through an early-retirement
program.</p>
<p>The utility said none of the 2,840 employees at its Palo
Verde nuclear power plant will be affected by the latest
reductions.</p>
<p>Two vice presidents, Russ Hulse, 62 years old, and Chuck
Jarman, 54, are retiring, the utility said. Another vice
president, Dave Ellis, 51, has resigned. The departures
reduce the number of company officers to 13 from 16.</p>
<p>Mark De Michele, president and chief executive officer,
said a major objective is "to reduce our pending
rate-increase request before the Arizona Corporation
Commission," which regulates utilities. Details of the
revised filing won't be available until later this year, he
said.</p>
<p>"All of this is driven by increased competition and the
flattening in the Arizona economy," said a spokesman for the
utility. "It has nothing to do with Pinnacle West and
PacifiCorp."</p>
<p>The two-year-old restructuring program began before
PacifiCorp, a utility holding company based in Portland,
Ore., launched its effort last year to acquire Arizona Public
Service or Pinnacle West. Earlier this month, PacifiCorp
dropped its pursuit in exchange for seasonal power swaps with
Arizona Public Service.</p>
