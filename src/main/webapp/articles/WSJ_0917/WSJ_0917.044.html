	<p class="article-leader">HICKSVILLE, N.Y. -- Citing weak sales of weather-related
air conditioning products, Newmark & Lewis Inc. reported a
60% decline in net income for the fiscal second quarter ended
July 31 to $552,000, or nine cents a share, from $1.4
million, or 22 cents a share, a year earlier. Sales rose 31%
to $90.3 million from $69.1 million.
   The second quarter includes results for the former Brick
Church Appliance Inc., a New Jersey-based chain of appliance
and electronics stores acquired by Newmark & Lewis in May.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>For the six months, the discount appliance and electronics
retailer had a net loss of $594,000, or 10 cents a share,
compared with net income of $853,000, or 14 cents a share, a
year ago. Sales rose 20% to $142.5 million from $118.7
million.</p>
<p>Liquidation of Brick Church's inventories boosted sales
but also lowered profit margins, contributing to the decline
in net income, a company spokesman said.</p>
