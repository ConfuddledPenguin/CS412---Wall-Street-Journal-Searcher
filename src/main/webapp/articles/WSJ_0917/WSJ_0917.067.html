	<p class="article-leader">PITTSBURGH -- It's only 10 minutes into the first day of
class in Chem 11, the University of Pittsburgh's introductory
chemistry course, and student Matt Smith is already yawning.
   Undaunted, Prof. Henry Bent tries a one-liner about
measuring density. Nobody laughs. He explodes a pink balloon
full of hydrogen. Mr. Smith starts jiggling his leg and
reading his mail. The professor shoots a fire extinguisher
into the crowd. Mr. Smith shuts his eyes and slumps in his
seat.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Sustaining interest among budding scientists is no easy
task nowadays. Mr. Smith, a 20-year-old junior, has already
switched his major from biology to business, forgoing plans
to be a biology teacher. "I couldn't study science because I
didn't enjoy it," he says.</p>
<p>Mr. Smith isn't alone. Comprehensive statistics on the
subject don't exist, but according to a National Science
Foundation study, some 42% of those who enter college
professing interest in science or engineering careers drop
out of the sciences after freshman year, and another 23%
defect before graduation.</p>
<p>The dropout problem isn't new. But Robert Watson, the
science foundation's director of undergraduate science,
engineering and mathematics education, says that "certainly
the evidence is it's getting worse." With fewer students
interested in science to begin with and a critical shortage
of scientists and engineers, the attrition rate could soon
represent a national crisis.</p>
<p>Frustrated faculty members blame their students. High
schools left them ill-prepared for rigorous college science,
the teachers say. Television and video games, meanwhile, gave
them meager technical skills, short attention spans and a
distaste for hard work. "They get here and may genuinely be
interested in science, but they don't have the tools to do
it," says Gary Haller, professor of chemical engineering at
Yale University.</p>
<p>Students, in turn, blame science professors for using
antiquated teaching methods and draconian grading systems.
They also complain of dry lectures packed with scores of
incomprehensible formulas and illustrated with confounding
diagrams. Science students typically put in more work than
their peers in the humanities or social sciences, and their
labors are often rewarded with substantially lower grades.</p>
<p>David Weisberg, a junior at Emory University in Atlanta,
entered college as a pre-med major, but after dabbling in
chemistry, biology and mathematics, he transferred to the
business school. "With all that lab work and the time put
forth and for as well as I was doing, it wasn't worth it,"
Mr. Weisberg says. "It shot me down. I was just miserable."</p>
<p>Michael Chen entered Yale in 1986 planning to study
science like his parents and sister, who are doctors, and his
brother, who is a computer consultant. But then, he took
astrophysics. "It scared the hell out of me," says Mr. Chen.
"I put more work into the weekly problem sets than I did into
midterm and final papers" for other courses.</p>
<p>Mr. Chen switched his major to English and has since taken
a job in publishing. "In other classes, if you do the work,
you'll get an A," says Mr. Chen. "In science, it just doesn't
work that way."</p>
<p>"It's an enormous problem," concedes mathematician Uri
Triesman of the University of California at Berkeley. "No one
will follow us unless we make an invitational atmosphere."</p>
<p>Much of the hostility students perceive in science comes
from the stingy grading. Science professors, notoriously
tight with the A's, commonly grade on a "curve." For every A
awarded, there must be a certain number of D's, regardless of
merit. That leads to fierce competition for the good grades.
Some students refuse to help others prepare for exams and
disparage high achievers for "breaking the curve."
Competition becomes so fierce that students have been known
to steal or sabotage their classmates' lab experiments.</p>
<p>"It's a great source of pride to science departments that
they have the lowest grades in the college," says William
Coleman, professor of chemistry at Wellesley College and an
advocate of reform. "I don't see why they're proud of that."</p>
<p>Frightened by low grades, students reject science courses
in favor of history, for example, where an A paper will be
given an A, regardless of how many other A papers are
submitted.</p>
<p>They also find that they usually don't have to work as
hard for that A in history. On top of lectures, science
students must take time-consuming lab courses -- often for
only partial credit, or for no credit at all. At some
colleges, science majors have to take twice as many required
courses as students in other disciplines.</p>
<p>Some scientists say today's crisis has its origins in the
post-Sputnik era. Professors had more science enthusiasts
than they could handle in those days, so they devised ways to
"weed out" the less serious. They piled work on their
students and made them compete for high marks. And with an
oversupply of science students, they didn't have to worry
whether their teaching style was inaccessible.</p>
<p>But now that interest in science careers has waned, the
"weeding out" system has become perilous. "A lot of people
are turned off" from sciences, says Katharine Hanson,
executive director of the Consortium on Financing Higher
Education. "It's just not worth the battle." It doesn't help
that the financial incentives for science careers are less
attractive than those for, say, law or business careers, she
added.</p>
<p>Some science professors are trying to make their courses
more appealing. Wellesley's Mr. Coleman, for example, has
been having his introductory chemistry students read and
write more about science's social and political relevance. He
threw out the grading curve, so students wouldn't compete
against each other. He also thinks science departments
nationwide could ease requirements without compromising
rigor. But he admits his views are considered radical by many
of his peers.</p>
<p>Others, trying to fight the lethargy without compromising
the requirements, become entertainers instead of professors.
One organic chemistry professor set his lecture to the tune
"America the Beautiful."</p>
<p>Another entertainer, however, is about ready to close his
act. "I'm going to be a marine drill sergeant -- I'm not
going to smile until Christmas," threatens Pitt's Mr. Bent, a
40-year teaching veteran.</p>
<p>"We've pulled out all the stops, and we're still not
getting results," he says, disassembling a toy cannon after
class. "We're having the worst times of our lives now, and
it's getting worse."</p>
