	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- The biggest blow from the oil crisis hits the
consumer price index this week but the turmoil will also
eventually interrupt recent progress on the trade deficit.
   The July trade data, due out tomorrow, won't be affected
by the Mideast oil crisis that began in August. Even so, the
July deficit is expected to widen because of higher oil
imports that month. The week's other major indicators include
July business inventories and August housing starts and
permits.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"I'd hoped to see 1990 as the year that the trade deficit
improved. But that hope's gone. It's fizzled," said Richard
Trainer, senior economist at the Bank of Tokyo, New York.
Helped along by a weak dollar this year, the important
oil-related proportion of the trade deficit fell to about 9%
in June from about 15% in January, he said. But Mr. Trainer
expects the oil portion to breach 15% again by September or
October.</p>
<p>The July trade deficit is expected to expand to $7.3
billion from June's $5.1 billion gap, according to MMS
International Inc., a unit of McGraw-Hill, New York. Samuel
Kahan, chief economist at Fuji Securities Inc., Chicago, said
he plans to add $1 billion onto the August trade deficit and
$2 billion onto September's gap due to inflated oil prices.
August won't feel the full impact, economists said, partly
because of the interruption of supplies.</p>
<p>Any help the trade deficit may get from a weak dollar will
be offset for some time by the sharp jump in the cost of
imported oil, said Mr. Kahan. He noted the U.S. imports
around eight million barrels of oil a day; the cost
difference between July's price and August's price was about
$8 a barrel.</p>
<p>As for the dollar, Mr. Kahan calculates that every 10%
depreciation of the greenback translates into a 10% increase
in exports -- but only after a two-year flow-through period.
So, "in the near term, the oil crisis is going to cause only
a widening" of the trade deficit, he said.</p>
<p>Elliott Platt, director of economic research at Donaldson,
Lufkin & Jenrette, New York, agrees that the oil crisis "is
pretty much a cut-and-dried negative" for the trade balance.
Still, he notes that "we've made a lot of progress in
non-petroleum components of the trade deficit, too. I don't
think people should forget that."</p>
<p>Most consumers will probably focus on their pocketbooks
tomorrow when the much-awaited consumer price index discloses
the initial hit from higher energy prices. The consensus view
calls for an increase of 0.8%, double July's 0.4% increase.
Excluding food and energy components, the August CPI is
expected to rise 0.4%.</p>
<p>More weak readings on the underlying economy are expected
in Wednesday's report on August housing starts. The combined
impact of the oil-induced shock to consumer confidence plus a
renewed upturn in mortgage rates should add up to the seventh
consecutive monthly drop in starts, noted Stephen Roach,
economist at Morgan Stanley & Co., New York. July business
inventories, due out today, are expected to increase 0.5% in
what some economists worry is yet another reflection of poor
sales levels.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>YES WE WILL; NO WE WON'T: The Conference Board's chief
economist trimmed its economic growth outlook for the rest of
the year, but said the economy will escape recession despite
the oil crisis. But many of the nation's corporate
controllers disagree. Half the nation's corporate controllers
expect a recession this year and 75% of them believe it will
last through 1991, according to a survey by the National
Association of Accountants. The controllers said higher
short- and long-term interest rates remain their top concern.</p>
