	<p class="article-leader">South Bend, Ind. -- The U. of Notre Dame opened its 1990
football campaign here Saturday night, and not a moment too
soon. An off-season of even a few hours more might have
necessitated a truely massive order of tarnish remover for
use on the school's famous Golden Dome.
   Hardly had the echoes gone back to sleep after a typical,
August-to-January, 12-win Irish season when college
football's most relentlessly hyped "good guys" aggregation
announced it had bolted the television package of the College
Football Association, which it helped found, to sign with NBC
a $38 million deal for its home games for five years,
starting next year. About the nicest thing the Irish were
called was greedy.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Then one ex-player sued the school and the NCAA to get
back the eligibility they removed after he entered (without
success) the last NFL draft, and another said that Irish
linemen used steroids with the tacit approval of Coach Lou
Holtz. And then Barry Switzer, who oughta know about such
things because he used to coach at Oklahoma, said ND broke
the rules by getting a summer job for a prized recruit.</p>
<p>But Notre Dame is no more easily upset off the gridiron
than on. Holtz, who knows about a lot of things, said he
didn't know nuttin' about no steroids or summer jobs, and
Irish eyes merely smiled at the expectation of the TV riches
to come. The once and future champs of the bottom line would
televise, televise, televise, recruit, recruit, recruit, and
win, win, win.</p>
<p>And, if the truth be known, entertain, entertain,
entertain, which the Irish did for everyone but foe Michigan
during Saturday's late show. In a game that had more twists
than a sack of pretzels, Notre Dame came back from a 24-14
deficit to prevail, 28-24. Among the ingredients of the
victory were a first-play fumble by a Michigan back who
didn't expect to have the ball, an opportune end zone pass
interception and a tipped-ball pass catch that kept a key ND
drive alive.</p>
<p>"I don't know yet how we won -- the luck of the Irish and
the Lady on the Dome must have had something to do with it,"
said a relieved Holtz later.</p>
<p>"When we needed something to happen, it usually did,"
testified Rick Mirer, the freckle-faced, 6-foot-3 sophomore
quarterback from nearby Goshen, Ind., making his first start
for the school. He catches on quick to how things work around
here.</p>
<p>How they work is that Notre Dame usually gets the best of
it in this world and -- who knows? -- maybe any others. The
latest Irish edition showed up in its crowded home stadium
ranked No. 1 in the polls -- it's normal position -- even
though it had yet to play a game. Michigan, also debuting,
came in ranked No. 4. If actual performance makes an
impression on the people who vote in those affairs, the two
teams should enter next weekend ranked Nos. 1 and 1 1/2,
respectively, `cause the Wolverines won the first 58 minutes
of this contest.</p>
<p>"Coming into the game we felt we were going to win, and
right up to the end we thought we could do it," said Gary
Moeller, the Michigan mentor. "It didn't quite work out on
the scoreboard, though."</p>
<p>Saturday was Moeller's first look at Irish magic from a
head coach's perspective, this being his first year in the
post. He took over from his longtime boss, Bo Schembechler,
one of whose last gridiron acts was to fling his clipboard
turfward at the Rose Bowl when an official's call went
against his boys. Moeller had a previous head-coaching job,
at Illinois, a dozen years ago, and while he won but six
games in three years he at least showed Bo's flair for
quarreling with representatives of the news media. He behaved
himself Saturday, but give the guy a chance.</p>
<p>Schembechler's main contribution to the football art was
his invention of, first, the 260-pound offensive lineman,
and, later, 280-, 300- and 320-pound varieties of the same
species. That he left Mo amply supplied in this department is
witnessed by Michigan's current OL, which averages 290
pounds.</p>
<p>Alas for the Wolverines, those fellas didn't have much
chance to do their stuff in the early going while the Irish
sprinted to a 14-3 lead. The initial Notre Dame touchdown
followed a fumble by Michigan tailback Jon Vaughn on the
first play from scrimmage after a communications mixup
between quarterback and bench. After a Michigan field goal,
the Irish tallied again on an 11-play, 75-yard drive capped
by a two-yard Tony Brooks dive.</p>
<p>But then the low-slung Vaughn commenced to scoot, and tall
quarterback Elvis Grbac to pass, behind their heifer-sized
blockers, and the next three TDs were Michigan's. Vaughn
would end the day with 201 yards rushing, and Grbac would
complete 17 of 30 passes for 190 yards as Michigan outgained
the Irish, 443 yards to 399. That doesn't happen often.</p>
<p>The Wolverines might have gone home smiling if not for two
plays. One was a Mirer pass late in quarter three that
bounced from the hands of flanker Raghib Ismail to those of
teammate Lake Dawson and turned a third-down-and-15 situation
on the Irish 15 yard line into a first down in the drive that
pulled Notre Dame from 14-24 to 21-24.</p>
<p>The other was an end zone interception of a Grbac pass by
Irish linebacker Michael Stonebreaker after the Wolverines
had moved, on the ground, from their own 18-yard-line to ND's
11 in the final quarter for what could have been a clinching
score. "A couple of calls by me didn't prove out to be good
calls," Moeller said later, including that play in.</p>
<p>Still, Notre Dame had to win it at the end, and young
Mirer was up to the task. On the final Irish drive, a
76-yarder, he completed five of six passes for 52 yards. The
last of those, on a roll out to the right, found flanker
Adrian Jarrell at the goal line between two defenders with
1:40 left.</p>
<p>"Rick was full of confidence in the huddle {on the winning
drive}, and he made believers of us," said Jarrell. "Some
guys have a way of doing that."</p>
<p>And a lot of them seem to wind up at Notre Dame.</p>
