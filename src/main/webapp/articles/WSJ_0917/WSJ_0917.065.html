	<p class="article-leader">LONDON -- The Lloyd's of London War Risks Rating Committee
said it has reduced premiums for war risks insurance on
cargoes being transported to or from the Persian Gulf port of
Dammam and other Saudi Arabian ports or places north of it.
   The cost of insuring cargoes in this category against war
risks has been lowered, to 0.375% of the insured value, from
0.5%.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>A spokesman for the Institute of London Underwriters said
Friday that there had so far been no reports of incidents in
the area. "I assume the underwriters feel that maybe the
initial rate was too high," he said.</p>
