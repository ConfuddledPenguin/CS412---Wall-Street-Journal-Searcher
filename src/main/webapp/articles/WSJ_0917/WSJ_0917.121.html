	<p class="article-leader">MANILA -- The first round of formal talks for a new treaty
covering U.S. military bases in the Philippines starts this
week amid an economic downturn that is expected to undercut
nationalist demands for a rapid U.S. withdrawal. Still, a
gradual reduction of the forces remains likely.
   Talks on the bases in May, which were described as
exploratory, came as the Cold War was collapsing, prompting
predictions that the U.S. wouldn't be averse to relinquishing
the bases. But more recently, the U.S. military buildup in
the Persian Gulf and an accelerating slide in the Philippine
economy have altered the context of the talks.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Analysts say these changing conditions have increased both
sides' interest in reaching a new agreement that would
provide for a gradual reduction of U.S. forces, with the
possibility that the forces would continue to use Philippine
facilities on a commercial basis.</p>
<p>The negotiations between panels headed by Philippine
Foreign Secretary Raul Manglapus and U.S. special envoy
Richard L. Armitage, a former assistant secretary of defense,
are expected to begin tomorrow in Manila. The talks will
focus on time and money: how long Manila will permit U.S.
forces to remain and how much Washington will pay for the
privilege.</p>
<p>The current agreement, signed in 1966, expires in
September 1991, and Manila has already given formal notice
that U.S. troops should withdraw by that date unless a new
treaty is signed. There are about 16,000 U.S. troops in the
Philippines, the third-largest U.S. military contingent in
Asia after those in Japan and South Korea.</p>
<p>For the U.S., the Gulf crisis has highlighted the
importance of maintaining a network of foreign bases despite
the collapse of communism in Eastern Europe and sharply
diminished perceptions of a Soviet threat. "It's pretty
obvious that the Americans have tried to depreciate the value
of the bases in the Philippines," says Filipe Miranda, a
professor of political science at the University of the
Philippines. Since Iraq's invasion of Kuwait on Aug. 2,
however, there has been increased recognition in the U.S.
"that the value of the bases is quite great," he adds.</p>
<p>Recent massive U.S. deployments to Saudi Arabia didn't
pass through the Pacific, but moved from the East Coast.
Nonetheless, U.S. bases in the Philippines are being used to
supply the Gulf forces, a role that is likely to expand if
the Mideast standoff continues, U.S. sources say. More
generally, analysts say Iraq's invasion of Kuwait has
increased awareness in both Manila and Washington of the
greater potential for regional threats to peace since the end
of the Cold War.</p>
<p>U.S. officials say they want to retain the bases as long
as possible under an agreement acceptable to both sides, but
they acknowledge that nationalist sentiment makes an
indefinite U.S. military presence highly unlikely. "There are
legitimate nationalist instincts," says a U.S. official. "The
challenge of the talks is to merge our interests with
Philippine nationalism."</p>
<p>Adds an Asian diplomat: "An indefinite stay is already
out. The only thing to be decided is the {transition}
period."</p>
<p>Rep. Stephen Solarz, chairman of the House Foreign Affairs
Subcomittee on Asian and Pacific Affairs, said a week ago
that he talked with U.S. negotiators before their departure
for Manila and believed they would propose a 10-year
extension that would include a gradual U.S. phaseout.</p>
<p>However, a source close to the U.S. Embassy in Manila says
the U.S. negotiating team won't offer a withdrawal, even on a
10-year timetable.</p>
<p>For the Philippines, the Gulf crisis is only the latest in
a string of natural and man-made disasters that have battered
the economy in the past year, making it more dependent on
benefits that derive from Clark Air Base, Subic Bay Naval
Station and four smaller U.S. military facilities.</p>
<p>Reeling from a sixth coup attempt last December, drought,
typhoons, an earthquake and floods, the government of
President Corazon Aquino has repeatedly been forced to reduce
its 1990 growth targets. Gross national product is now
officially projected to expand 3.8% this year, well below the
6% growth in output of goods and services that government
planners say is necessary to alleviate poverty and provide
jobs for a swelling population. Even so, private analysts say
the government's GNP figures are still overly optimistic.</p>
<p>The Mideast crisis has dealt the Philippines a double
blow, bringing higher oil prices while cutting remittances
from the estimated 65,000 Filipinos who were working in Iraq
and Kuwait at the time of the invasion. Workers returning
from the Gulf will only exacerbate unemployment. This
economic squeeze has fortified the arguments that the
Philippines can't afford to turn out the Americans.</p>
<p>Under a 1988 accord, President Ronald Reagan agreed to ask
Congress for a total of $962 million as payment to Manila for
use of the bases during the two years ending in September
1991. Congress appropriated only $385 million for 1990, $96
million short of one year's payment, and Manila and
Washington are currently engaged in a dispute over the
discrepancy. Still, the U.S. payment represents a substantial
cash infusion for the strapped Aquino government.</p>
<p>More significant for the economy are business and
employment spinoffs from the bases, which U.S. officials
estimate at about $1 billion a year, or roughly 3% of
Philippine GNP. The bases employ 78,000 Filipinos, a payroll
second only to that of the Philippine government.</p>
<p>To counter concerns about economic dependence on the
bases-and perhaps to strengthen the Philippines' negotiating
position-the government's Bases Council has proposed that
Clark be converted into an international airport and cargo
facility and that Subic Bay become a commercial ship-repair
facility, with the U.S. Navy as a major client.</p>
<p>The Bases Council has suggested that the conversion be
financed by shifting Philippine military camps from Manila to
Clark and selling the prime real estate they now occupy in
the capital for an estimated 50 billion pesos ($2.07
billion). Even supporters of the conversion plan, however,
acknowledge that it couldn't be implemented before the
current agreement expires next year.</p>
<p>Nationalist sentiment against the bases remains strong,
particularly among the political elite. Analysts question
whether any treaty providing for an extended U.S. presence
could win two-thirds endorsement from the 23-member
Philippine Senate, as required by the country's constitution.</p>
<p>Philippine negotiators have refused to divulge their
objectives in the negotiations, insisting that it is up to
the U.S. to present proposals. Economics will clearly be on
their minds, however.</p>
<p>Alfredo Bengzon, the panel's vice chairman, said recently
that the Philippine negotiators would examine U.S. proposals
from three perspectives: "First, the aspect of what is
politically acceptable to us. Second, from the aspect of what
is economically bearable. And third, from the aspect of what
serves the needs of both the Philippines and the United
States."</p>
