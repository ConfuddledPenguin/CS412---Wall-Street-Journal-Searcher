	<p class="article-leader">The Resolution Trust Corp., ignoring a federal judge's
findings, said it will recognize new losses at Franklin
Savings Association and declare the Kansas thrift insolvent
with negative capital of $8 million.
   The new writedowns are contained in a financial statement
to be filed today with the Office of Thrift Supervision in
Topeka, Kan., and may spark another round of litigation
between Franklin's owners and thrift regulators.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>A new court fight, coming on the heels of a judge's ruling
that Franklin properly posted positive capital, could also
involve the accounting firm of Price Waterhouse, whose audit
forms the basis of the financial statement to be filed by the
RTC.</p>
<p>Franklin officials have been questioning the impartiality
of Price Waterhouse since obtaining internal OTS memoranda
about the retention of the accounting firm in the course of
its lawsuit challenging the OTS's seizure of the thrift. "PW
{Price Waterhouse} is best qualified to do the audit and
shares our views on the hedge accounting issue," an OTS
official said in one memorandum urging the RTC to retain the
accounting firm. "It is in everyone's best interest to have
PW do the audit."</p>
<p>Franklin was placed in conservatorship by the OTS and its
management duties turned over to the RTC last Feb. 16 after
the thrift refused to immediately recognize about $119
million in losses on futures contracts. Those contracts were
held as a hedge against losses in the $10.26 billion of
mortgage-backed securities that dominated Franklin's
portfolio of assets.</p>
<p>Price Waterhouse couldn't be reached for comment after the
RTC released its preliminary findings late Friday. An RTC
spokesman said the agency conducted a review of Franklin's
financial status independent of the accounting firm.</p>
<p>In its lawsuit against the OTS, Franklin's management
successfully contended that the agency had applied different
accounting methods to Franklin's unorthodox business
practices than the ones that had previously been approved by
thrift regulators. Franklin's methods, endorsed by its
accounting firm, Deloitte Touche, allowed the thrift to delay
recognition of certain losses on its hedging positions, among
other things.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, U.S. District Judge Dale E. Saffels of
Topeka ruled that the OTS had been "arbitrary and capricious"
in its decision to place Franklin in conservatorship.</p>
<p>Judge Saffels's order was temporarily stayed by an appeals
court in Denver the next day, putting the RTC back in control
of Franklin. The OTS has appealed Judge Saffels's decision.</p>
<p>The RTC said the financial statement to be filed today
reflects the RTC's assessment of Franklin's condition for the
fiscal year ending June 30. While not nearly as devastating
as the OTS's declaration that Franklin's capital stood at
negative $44.3 million in mid-February, the RTC statement is
nonetheless disputed by Franklin's chairman, Ernest M.
Fleischer.</p>
<p>"For RTC to publish a statement that reflects a negative
{capital} is either a misapplication of accounting
methodology or gross mismanagement by the RTC or a
combination of both," Mr. Fleischer said.</p>
<p>The RTC found, among other things, that Franklin should
have recorded an additional $196 million in hedging losses
for the year ended June 30, 1989.</p>
<p>The RTC also said Franklin should recognize $50 million in
losses from six bond issues for which the RTC stopped paying
interest on June 8. Some bondholders have challenged the RTC
in court, and the agency said a successful challenge will
result in additional losses of $142 million.</p>
