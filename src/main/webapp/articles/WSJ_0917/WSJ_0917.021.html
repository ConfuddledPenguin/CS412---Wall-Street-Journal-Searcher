	<p class="article-leader">SANTA ANA, Calif. -- Tokos Medical Corp., a provider of
specialized home health care, said it received Food and Drug
Administration approval to market a home uterine-activity
monitor made by the company's recently acquired Physiologic
Diagnostic Service unit.
   The Genesis system monitor is the first to gain commercial
approval for home treatment of pregnant women who are at risk
for pre-term labor, Tokos said. The sooner pre-term labor is
diagnosed and treated, the better the chances for delivery of
a healthy baby.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Such monitors made by Physiologic Diagnostic Service,
Tokos and others have been used by tens of thousands of women
since the mid-1980s, but some doctors have been reluctant to
prescribe them and some health insurers have denied coverage,
because the monitors lacked FDA approval for home use.</p>
<p>"Nobody knows how quickly the medical community will
react, but this is very significant news," said John F.
Hindelong, an analyst at Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette
Securities Corp.</p>
<p>Mr. Hindelong expects Tokos's revenue to jump more than
50% next year to between $110 million and $115 million from
an estimated $70 million this year, largely because of the
FDA approval. Pretax margins will surge to 19% next year from
6% in 1990, he calculates. Last year, Tokos earned $616,000,
or six cents a share, on revenue of $58.9 million.</p>
<p>In May 1988, an FDA panel recommended against approval of
Tokos's Term Guard monitor, which is similar to the Genesis
system. The panel said that Tokos's research data were
insufficient to demonstrate the monitor's effectiveness apart
from Tokos's perinatal nursing care for patients.</p>
<p>Physiologic Diagnostic Service, acquired by Tokos earlier
this month, designed its research studies to focus on the
device alone, said Craig T. Davenport, Tokos president and
chief operating officer. Tokos plans to pursue FDA approval
for the Term Guard monitor, which is somewhat more portable
than the Genesis system, Mr. Davenport said.</p>
<p>Tokos shares closed at $12, up 50 cents, in national
over-the-counter trading Friday.</p>
