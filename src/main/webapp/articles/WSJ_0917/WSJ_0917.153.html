	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- The Bush administration says stringent
international controls could peacefully curb Iraq's
biological, chemical and nuclear weapons programs, even if
Saddam Hussein remains in power.
   But judging from recent experience, that may be a pipe
dream.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Baghdad already has the facilities to continue producing
massive quantities of its own biological and chemical
weapons, and it has sophisticated missiles to deliver them,
experts say. More worrisome, the nuclear nonproliferation
treaty can't significantly restrict Saddam Hussein's quest
for nuclear weapons: under the treaty, which Iraq has signed,
he can continue Iraq's nuclear research effort.</p>
<p>These stark realities fuel the debate over whether the
U.S. can achieve its goals in the Persian Gulf unless it
topples Saddam Hussein.</p>
<p>So far, the Bush administration hasn't reached its own
conclusion. In his address to a joint session of Congress
last week, the president said only that one long-term U.S.
objective in the Persian Gulf would be "to curb the
proliferation of chemical, biological, ballistic missiles
and, above all, nuclear technologies."</p>
<p>Lately, the administration seems to be hoping it can
achieve its goal short of eliminating the Iraqi dictator. But
many experts say containment won't work. They note that with
international help, Iraq has built a nearly self-sufficient
defense industry. West German companies built its
chemical-weapons facilities. French companies helped it
construct an electronics plant that makes computer chips and
circuit boards used in air-defense equipment. A Chilean
company designed an Iraqi factory that makes cluster bombs.</p>
<p>Similarly, Iraq has sophisticated missile technology. In
December, it surprised U.S. and other intelligence services
by launching a rocket capable of putting a satellite in
orbit. And according to a report last week, Iraq successfully
tested an intermediate-range ballistic missile loaded with
chemical weapons.</p>
<p>"All of our experience over the last decade suggests you
simply cannot effectively control the ability of a country to
obtain technology if they really want to get it," says W.
Seth Carus, research fellow at the Washington Institute for
Near East Policy, a private group.</p>
<p>The U.S. itself lacks the means to block the flow of
militarily sensitive technology to regional powers. Under
current rules, the Pentagon only has the authority to monitor
certain potentially troublesome exports to communist nations.
But now that the communist bloc has dissolved, it is nations
such as Iraq that pose the greatest threat. Last week, the
Senate passed a measure giving the Pentagon more authority,
but the measure must be reconciled with a House bill.</p>
<p>Concerning nuclear facilities, Leonard Spector, an expert
on nuclear proliferation issues at the Carnegie Endowment for
International Peace, says the current treaty isn't enough to
safeguard the world against a maverick like Saddam Hussein.</p>
<p>Non-nuclear countries that have signed the treaty, such as
Iraq, pledge not to develop nuclear weapons. But the treaty
allows them to do nuclear work that ostensibly is for
peaceful purposes. So, Saddam Hussein could continue his
nuclear research program without violating the treaty until
he is just weeks from being able to produce a bomb.</p>
<p>Mr. Spector says the U.S. prefers additional agreements,
such as one it has with South Korea, that say certain kinds
of nuclear facilities -- such as enrichment plants or large
research reactors -- won't be built even though permitted by
the treaty.</p>
<p>Last week, Secretary of State James Baker seemed to be
suggesting similar arrangements could be applied in the
Middle East. He told North Atlantic Treaty Organization
allies that the major powers and Mideast nations "need to
consider intrusive, internationally sanctioned measures and
procedures to diminish the threat of Iraqi weapons of mass
destruction."</p>
<p>But how could "intrusive" measures be peacefully used on
Saddam Hussein? "It seems to me that if Saddam Hussein
withdraws from Kuwait, we're going to be stuck with a
situation where we would wish for more than the treaty, but
won't be able to get it," says Mr. Spector.</p>
<p>As a result, some experts are concluding reluctantly that
there is only one way to deal effectively with Iraq's nuclear
capabilities. "Given their record on important treaties, we
cannot be sure that their word means they will honor their
obligations," says congressional aide Peter Galbraith, a
Mideast expert. "The only way we can be sure is if their
nuclear facilities are either dismantled or destroyed."</p>
