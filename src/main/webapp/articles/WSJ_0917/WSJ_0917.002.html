	<p class="article-leader">The country is focused on David Souter, but it's worth
noting that a Justice Souter will be icing on the
judicial-restraint cake. After three landslide victories by
presidential candidates who ran against judicial activism,
the lower federal courts have already undergone a massive
shift back to judges who are happy to interpret the law and
forgo making it up.
   A recent pair of lower-case opinions neatly contrast the
old style of judging vs. the new:</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The Carter Judge</p>
<p>Do dolphins have standing to sue in court? This wasn't
exactly the way the issue was framed when a San Francisco
group called "Earth Island Institute" sued the Commerce
Department, but it's more than close enough. The group wanted
a judge to ban imports of tuna to help save dolphins, which
get caught in tuna nets. Thelton Henderson, appointed by
President Carter in 1980, complied.</p>
<p>The environmental group cited the Marine Mammal Protection
Act. The law instructs the Commerce Secretary to act against
countries that exceed their number of dolphin kills. It gives
Commerce the power to ban all fish imports from a country if
it fails to do enough to protect dolphins. Commerce has used
this threat to negotiate huge reductions in the number of
dolphins killed by foreign fleets in the Pacific fishing
areas from California to Chile.</p>
<p>The problem is that the most recent analysis of dolphins
killed by fishermen from foreign countries has not yet been
done. So we don't know which countries are complying and
which are not. Judge Henderson said that such "practical
considerations or unavailability of information is no
excuse." Instead, he announced that "the continued slaughter
and destruction of these innocent victims of the economics of
fishing constitutes an irreparable injury to us all."</p>
<p>Judge Henderson, who last year ordered "certified
observers" onto every U.S. tuna boat, gave five countries the
presumption of guilt -- and gave himself the power to act for
the Commerce Secretary. He banned all tuna imports from
Ecuador, Mexico, Panama, Venezuela and Vanuatu. It's a
measure of the overreaching in this case that Commerce has
refused to enforce Judge Henderson's order.</p>
<p>The Reagan Judge</p>
<p>Some day the sort of cases now brought in the name of
dolphins, whales and red squirrels could go the way of an
earlier dodo, antitrust law. Federal judges have spent the
past several years reversing their predecessors by applying
economics to antitrust law.</p>
<p>The latest judge to take an absurd antitrust case and boot
it out of his courtroom is Frank Bullock of North Carolina,
who like about half the federal judges, was picked by
President Reagan. Judge Bullock, appointed in 1982, sat
through a long trial and watched a jury award nearly $150
million based on wacky legal and economic theories. He
reversed the entire verdict, treble damages and all. This may
finally be the death blow for one of the hoariest theories of
antitrust law, "predatory pricing."</p>
<p>The Liggett tobacco company accused Brown & Williamson of
predatory pricing in the generic cigarette battles of the
mid-1980s. Liggett said its competitor copied its own
successful marketing program based on volume rebates, but
went too far by selling at too low a price. Judge Bullock
ruled that Liggett failed to prove any harm to consumers. For
one thing, low prices are hardly a burden. For another, Brown
& Williamson had a mere 12% share of the U.S. market, hardly
enough to control the market.</p>
<p>Judge Bullock reminded everyone that the purpose of the
antitrust laws is not some industrial policy to limit the
success of American firms, but to get consumers the best
products at the lowest prices. "The antitrust laws' goal is
to promote consumer welfare, not to discourage aggressive
price competition," he ruled.</p>
<p>The Supreme Court can only hear about 150 cases each year,
a tiny fraction of all cases. The good news is that the trend
throughout all levels of federal courts shows that voters are
beginning to get what they wanted, even before Justice
Souter.</p>
