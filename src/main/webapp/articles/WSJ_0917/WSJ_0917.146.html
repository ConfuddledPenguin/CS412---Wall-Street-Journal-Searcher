	<p class="article-leader">Cubic Corp., a San Diego-based high-technology concern,
said its Cubic Communications Inc. unit in nearby Oceanside,
Calif., might lay off as many as 85 of its 120 employees in
November and December.
   Cubic said business prospects for its Communications unit
product lines "remain strong, but the competitive nature of
the defense industry requires that management review every
facet of the operations, including space and personnel
requirements." Cubic Communications markets freeway call
boxes and transmitters and receivers in the U.S. and
overseas.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Cubic said it is studying various options, including
closing the Communications unit and consolidating operations
at company-owned facilities in San Diego. The company is
leasing its Oceanside facility.</p>
<p>For the nine months ended June 30, Cubic's profit rose 30%
to $19.1 million, or $2.74 a share, from $14.6 million, or
$2.01 share, a year earlier. Sales rose 7.2% to $266.9
million from $249 million.</p>
