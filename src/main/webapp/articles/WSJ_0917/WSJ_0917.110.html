	<p class="article-leader">International Business Machines Corp. and Microsoft Corp.
are expected to make an announcement soon that will try to
repair differences in their sometimes strained relationship
and clarify their stance on an important personal-computer
issue.
   Industry executives said the companies will realign some
responsibilities for the development of OS/2, an operating
system that both have said is crucial for the future of
personal computers. The software has been a bust thus far,
and the companies have apparently decided that part of the
problem lies in the confusion that can result from the
fragmentation that occurs when development is split among
various sites at two companies. So the companies have decided
to combine some of their work and will each take more
responsibility than the other for certain versions of OS/2.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The executives said the companies will also use the
announcement to try to demonstrate that their relationship
remains strong. While both had initially hung their hopes on
OS/2, in recent months Microsoft had begun pushing its
Windows software, which many in the industry see as a rival
to OS/2. IBM, meanwhile, had begun talking up a version of
OS/2 that it was developing on its own and that Microsoft
didn't appear to be interested in carrying. Now, however,
Microsoft appears likely to carry the OS/2 version that IBM
is pushing. IBM, likewise, insists that it doesn't see
Windows as a threat.</p>
<p>Neither IBM, Armonk, N.Y., nor Microsoft, Redmond, Wash.,
would comment on whether they would announce anything this
week. However, Jim Cannavino, general manager of IBM's PC
business, said in an interview over the weekend that "we've
looked at ways to be more efficient several times. . . . We
continue to do that." He stressed that he didn't see any rift
developing with Microsoft. "We're working together as we have
in the past," he said.</p>
<p>Both IBM and Microsoft are clearly worried because an
article in InfoWorld, a trade publication, will hit the
newsstands today saying that IBM is taking control of OS/2
development and that the two companies are, in essence,
headed for divorce court.</p>
<p>That would be important not only for IBM and Microsoft but
for the whole personal-computer industry, because the
companies have paired to set many of the industry's
standards. A split would cause many software developers and
customers to slow down while they evaluate which company to
follow, and could open the way for companies that support
Unix, a rival operating system.</p>
<p>"Customers want clear choices," said Philippe Kahn, chief
executive of Borland International, a software company with
links to both IBM and Microsoft. "If there's confusion,
they're just going to back off, and there will be later
acceptance of {OS/2}."</p>
<p>A preliminary draft of the InfoWorld story, a final
version of which will appear in today's issue, cited sources
as saying IBM is "taking over virtually all OS/2 . . .
development," and quoted insiders calling OS/2 "virtually
dead" at Microsoft.</p>
<p>InfoWorld's sources said communication between the IBM and
Microsoft technical staffs has stopped, and characterized
this week's expected announcement as formalizing the
IBM-Microsoft "rift."</p>
<p>But Mr. Cannavino, while not denying an announcement
regarding OS/2, said firmly that the InfoWorld story "is just
not true." Asked specifically about redividing the
responsibilities for OS/2, Mr. Cannavino didn't rule out such
a move but said it wouldn't hurt IBM-Microsoft relations in
any case. "I wouldn't view that as significant from a
relationship point of view," he said.</p>
<p>The two companies' interests are different enough that any
peace may be uneasy. Microsoft is in the business of selling
software, and it wins whether it sells Windows or OS/2. At
the moment, Windows is shaping up to be a big winner, likely
selling some two million copies this year, while OS/2 sells a
small fraction of that. So Microsoft can be expected to
continue to emphasize Windows at least for the near term.
IBM, however, is mainly in the business of selling
hardware-system software is a minuscule part of IBM's PC
business. IBM hopes to sell networks of dozens or hundreds of
PCs and feels that OS/2, not Windows, is the operating system
that customers will need to glue all those computers
together. So IBM will push its customers, and Microsoft,
toward OS/2.</p>
<p>IBM and Microsoft did try to patch up their differences on
OS/2 once before, late last year. But all they produced was
an awkward compromise in which they recommended that
customers with a certain minimum amount of memory in their
personal computers use OS/2 while people with less memory use
Windows.</p>
