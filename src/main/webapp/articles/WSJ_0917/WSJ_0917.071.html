	<p class="article-leader">Aetna Life & Casualty Co. is positioning itself to become
"a major player" in the emerging field of managed-care health
insurance, Charles Bell, senior vice president, said.
   The Hartford, Conn., insurer has spent $400 million in the
past five years to develop its managed-care operations. It
now has 2.8 million members in its network of 29 health
maintenance organizations and 125 preferred provider groups.
Aetna ranks second behind Cigna Corp. among the publicly held
insurers that have decided to establish themselves as
significant providers of managed health-care services to
corporations.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Since the beginning of the year, Aetna has been working to
cement its position in the managed-care field. In January,
Aetna bought Voluntary Hospitals of America's 50% stake in
Partners National Health Plans, a network of HMOs the two
companies began developing in 1985.</p>
<p>In July, Aetna won Citibank's group health insurance
account. The New York-based bank chose Aetna as the single
insurer for its 53,000 domestic employees and some 1,000
employees abroad. Citibank is one of Aetna's largest
managed-care clients so far. Several major corporations, such
as American Express Co. and Apple Computer Inc., already use
the insurer's HMO network.</p>
<p>Late last month, Aetna consolidated all its
employee-benefit programs. These include HMO and preferred
provider group, or PPO, networks; traditional fee-for-service
plans; utilization-review systems, and various mental and
substance-abuse programs under the Aetna Health Plans name.
The new name will make it easier to market these various
benefit plans, Mr. Bell, who is in charge of Aetna's managed
health-care operations, said in an interview.</p>
<p>With a new name and its managed-care network in place,
Aetna is concentrating on refining and improving its
operations, Mr. Bell said.</p>
<p>Work has started on a new computer system for its 29 HMOs
to ensure that all the plans are accessing patient
information and processing claims in the same manner. This
new system was needed because Aetna acquired about two-thirds
of the HMOs, each with its own way of carrying out these
basic tasks. Aetna said the new system will be completed by
next year.</p>
<p>During the coming year, Aetna will consolidate its three
utilization-review programs -- one for HMOs, another for PPOs
and a third for indemnity plans -- into a single system.</p>
<p>Also next year, the insurer will develop
"point-of-service" benefit plans. These plans offer workers
the flexibility of using a preferred provider network, while
combining some of the utilization-control features of an HMO,
Mr. Bell said. Each employee is assigned to a primary-care
physician, who will coordinate all medical care the patient
receives.</p>
<p>Employees who chose health-care providers within the Aetna
network in certain cities will be reimbursed 100%, while
those who go outside the network will pay deductibles and
some percentage of their health-care costs. Mr. Bell said
these "point-of-service" plans will be set up in at least the
60 largest metropolitan areas by the end of 1991.</p>
<p>Although he acknowledged that Aetna's HMO business lost
money during the first six months of 1990, Mr. Bell declined
to make a specific forecast for the remainder of the year.
"Given our losses for the first half, it doesn't take a
rocket scientist to figure out that we'll be in the red this
year," he said. But he also said he expects a "major
improvement" in the company's HMO business next year. "We'd
like to get to a break-even position," he said.</p>
