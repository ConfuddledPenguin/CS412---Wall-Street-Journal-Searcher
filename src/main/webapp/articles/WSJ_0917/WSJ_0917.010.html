	<p class="article-leader">The U.S. economy cannot long survive the present
capital-gains tax environment. If you purchased a stock
portfolio in 1975 and sold it today, the effective capital
gains tax rate on the transaction would be about 75%. The 28%
tax rate applies both to your real gain, measured in constant
1975 dollars, as well as to the inflation built into the
present price of your portfolio.
   After paying taxes on both the real and inflationary
gains, you are left with only a quarter of your capital gain,
measured in the 1975 dollars with which you bought the
portfolio. The 28% nominal capital-gains rate, in fact, is
the highest in history, as the graph below indicates (see
accompany illustration -- WSJ Sept. 17, 1990). But the real
rate, taking into account past inflation, has risen much
more, to about 75% now from only 23% in 1965. Of course,
different holding periods for the same portfolio involve
different inflation penalties.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Most of the nation's capital stock represents mature
investments made during the 1970s or early 1980s. That is,
risk investors who bought securities or formed businesses in
such growth areas as computers or cable television now hold
mature investments that have the bulk of their capital gains
behind them. Normally, risk investors would sell such
portfolios to income investors and seek new risk investments.
The effective 75% capital-gains rate on an investment held
for 15 years, though, immobilizes their capital, and reduces
the relative price of risk investments. That is why the Dow
Jones Industrial Average, representing the stocks of mature
companies, has outperformed all other indices.</p>
<p>It is important to view the 1990 stock market in the
context of recent economic history. Between 1954 and 1969,
the rate of increase of stock prices was higher than
inflation, i.e., investors had real capital gains. From 1969
to 1982, when the Reagan tax cuts began to take effect, the
inflation rate exceeded the appreciation of stock prices,
i.e., investors had real capital losses. Between 1982 and
1987, they enjoyed real capital gains once again. Investors
who held out through the bad years now cannot afford to make
their capital liquid. That is, the economy cannot turn the
benefits of the good years into a new generation of
investments.</p>
<p>These numbers make clear why both a lower basic rate and
inflation indexing of capital-gains taxes are essential.
Indexation is needed to break the logjam of mature
investments, providing an incentive for risk investors to
cash in their capital gains and take new risks.</p>
<p>High capital-gains tax rates make innovative companies
less attractive to investors, with the result that technology
stocks filled 35% of institutional portfolios in 1989 as
against 47% in 1987. Similarly, venture-capital-backed stock
offerings have disappeared since 1987.</p>
<p>A lower tax rate on capital gains is required to restore
the attractiveness of new risk investments. The recession in
the Northeast stems from the decline of real estate, high
tech and the securities markets, i.e., the sectors most
sensitive to the high capital gains rate. The deficits at
state capitals and the bill for the S&L bailout would fall
drastically if the capital-gains rate were cut to a tolerable
level.</p>
<p>But the true significance of a capital-gains tax cut is
not that it would avert recession in the short term --
although it would -- but that it would enable this country to
unbottle the benefits of the Reagan years and mobilize
capital for a new generation of investment.</p>
<p>Economic growth is the result not of investing "money,"
but effort and skill. At the margin, higher productivity
comes from better skills, that is, technological innovation.
The capital-gains tax as it now stands crushes innovation at
both ends, by destroying the incentive to make new risk
investments while imposing a prohibitive cost on cashing in
mature investments.</p>
