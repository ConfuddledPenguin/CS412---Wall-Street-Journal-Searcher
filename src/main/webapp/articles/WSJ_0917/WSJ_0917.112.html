	<p class="article-leader">A subsidiary of Bank of Boston Corp. was sued for $125
million over lending restrictions by Diversified Foods Inc.,
in U.S. district court.
   Diversified, a closely held wholesaler in Portland, Maine,
had previously filed suit against Bank of Boston's Casco
Northern unit in Maine state courts. That suit seeks $150
million in damages for bank actions that allegedly led to
Diversified's liquidation last year.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>In its latest suit Diversified said that lending
restrictions kept it from prepaying a Casco Northern loan and
finding new lenders.</p>
<p>Bank of Boston said the suit doesn't have any merit.</p>
