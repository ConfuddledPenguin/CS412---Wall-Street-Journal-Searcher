computer systems supplier, said it won't make an interest
payment of about $4.7 million due Sept. 15 to holders of its
senior subordinated notes, due 1998.
   The company has retained the investment banking firm

has $55 million in senior bank debt and about $110 million in
subordinated debt outstanding. On Sept. 28, an additional $15
million of principal and $1.7 million of interest on the bank
debt are due.</p>
