	<p class="article-leader">If you thought caring for your compact disks required only
common sense, brace yourself.
   After nearly two years of study, some of the nation's
premier audiophiles are declaring that the way to get the
most out of your CDs may be to freeze them.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>No ordinary freezer will do, however. To improve the sound
of a CD, it must be frozen -- cryogenically, in liquid
nitrogen -- at temperatures approaching minus 320 degrees
fahrenheit.</p>
<p>"It makes CDs sound better," said Larry Archibald,
publisher of Stereophile, an monthly magazine on high-end
audio equipment. Mr. Archibald said Stereophile will publish
a major article in its October issue on freezing CDs
cryogenically.</p>
<p>"You just don't know why it works," he said, "but you can
hear the difference."</p>
<p>Whether you can hear the difference or not, it isn't
advisable to try freezing CDs in your own home. "You can't
just take a disk and throw it into a pool of liquid
nitrogen," said Edmund Meitner, executive vice president of
Museatex Audio Inc., a company in Montreal, Canada that will
shortly offer a CD-freezing service. "If you did that, your
CD would probably crack."</p>
<p>The key is to gradually reduce the temperature, "so that
you bring about changes in the structure of {the CD's}
materials, said Jeffrey Levine, president of Applied
Cryogenics Inc., a Newton, Mass. company that formed a
partnership with Musetax last month to market the technique.</p>
<p>Mr. Levine, who holds a doctorate in physics from the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology, said methodically
freezing a CD does it no harm provided that "you carefully
bring it back to ambient temperatures." He said that over the
past two years he has honed his method of freezing and
thawing CDs.</p>
<p>The idea that cryogenics improves the sound of CDs is only
the latest in a string of seemingly kooky claims issued this
year by audiophiles frustrated with what they contend are the
CD's aesthetic shortcomings. In February, an article in
Stereophile unleashed a torrent of interest by claiming that
applying Armor All Protectant or a slew of other surface
treatments noticeably improved the sound of every CD. Before
long, thousands of people around the country -- judging from
letters to audio magazines and the subsequent articles and
television reports -- were painting their CDs with all manner
of coatings.</p>
<p>"Boy, have I received letters with suggestions for
treating CDs," Sam Tellig, the author of the article, wrote
in Stereophile's current issue. "Everything from guitar
polish to toothpaste and suntan lotion to Liquid Wrench. No,
I do not recommend that you treat your discs with Colgate or
Crest."</p>
<p>But in recent months, the hoopla over painting CDs has
cooled, and enthusiasm has turned into loathing as angry
musiclovers report that certain treatments ruined their CDs.
Even Mr. Tellig has been stung by the backlash. Partly out of
frustration with the complaints, he has abandoned his monthly
column, soberly advising in a reputed farewell article: "I
want to emphasize that anything you apply to a CD could turn
out to have unforseen and unwanted consequences."</p>
<p>Privately, though, Mr. Tellig remains convinced that many
treatments, including Armor All, probably don't hurt CDs at
all -- and improve the sound. "The differences are real," he
said in an interview. "Almost anything you do to treat a CD,
even a bath in dishwater, will improve the sound. . . . This
isn't just a mass hysteria."</p>
<p>Still, even Mr. Tellig was taken aback by the claim that
cryogenics can improve CD sound. "That's a new one on me," he
said.</p>
<p>Dennis A. Praegitzer, president of 303 Products Inc., a
company in Redding, Calif. that makes liquid treatments to
protect metals, plastics, fiberglass and CDs, says "That's a
lot of crap. I just don't see what freezing would do."</p>
<p>But for passionate audiophiles, explanations aren't highly
valued. "Anything is possible," said Mark Brannan, manager of
The Audio Alternative, a Portland, Ore. store that advises
its CD customers to paint their disks with a blue-green art
pen in order to improve the sound.</p>
<p>"I didn't believe the pen deal when I first heard about it
either," Mr. Brannan said. "But it works. We can't explain
it. We don't care." He added that he would keep an open mind
about claims for freezing CDs cryogenically.</p>
<p>Even if freezing a CD does improve its sound, it isn't
likely that the average living room will end up with a
cryogenic freezer plopped next to the stereo speakers.
Applied Cryogenics sells its freezers for $35,000; buyers are
usually precision manufacturers of one sort or another.</p>
<p>Indeed, Mr. Meitner hopes to persuade manufacturers of CDs
to add cryogenic freezing to their ordinary procedures. But
so far, no one's jumping at the opportunity. "The music
industry is taking a wait-and-see attitude," he concedes.</p>
<p>Some audiophiles are less patient. Stereophile, for
instance, plans to offer cryogenically frozen test-CDs for
sale to its subscribers next month. At $8.95 a pop, Mr.
Archibald, the magazine's publisher, thinks its a good deal.
"Listening," he said, "is the only way to find out if this is
real."</p>
<p>Among audiophiles, resentment against CDs has been growing
for years, stoked by claims that the CD offers "perfect"
sound. Actually, they don't and in many cases are inferior to
plain-old vinyl records, audiophiles contend. "Vinyl has
certain superiorities -- a more living, breathing
reproduction," said Sallie Reynolds, editorial director of
Absolute Sound, an audio magazine. "It preserves more of the
envelope of sound than the CD." Among other flaws, CDs "have
trouble getting a good string sound . . . and lose the sound
of a plugged bass," Ms. Reynolds said, adding: "So far, no
one has made a CD that can reproduce a full, rich orchestra
the way a well-produced {long-playing record} can."</p>
<p>Cryogenics is best known as the method used to preserve
the bodies of dead people until cures for their illnesses are
discovered. Skeptics of this procedure abound.</p>
<p>Rather than experiment with "tweaks," Mr. Tellig said he'd
prefer it if manufacturers simply produced a better-sounding
CD. "I think it's disturbing that these tweaks make a
difference," he said. "The customer shouldn't have to go
through these gyrations."</p>
