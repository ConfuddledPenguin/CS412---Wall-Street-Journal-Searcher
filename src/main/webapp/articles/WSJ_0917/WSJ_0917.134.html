	<p class="article-leader">BENTONVILLE, Ark. -- In what amounts to a major triumph
for a Texas hot dog vendor and her elderly, handicapped work
force, a Wal-Mart Stores Inc. unit that had come under fire
for ordering the vendor off its properties said it has
reversed its position and will allow the vendor to stay.
   After Wal-Mart's Sam's Wholesale Clubs unit ordered
Scarlett Rabalais's Hot Diggity Dogs company to remove its
stands from in front of 21 Sam's stores in Texas, the local
press covered the eviction's implications for Ms. Rabalais's
largely elderly and handicapped work force. Eager to stop the
bad publicity, Sam's officials invited Ms. Rabalais to
Bentonville last week to discuss the problem.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Following that meeting, Sam's said that it agreed to let
Hot Diggity Dogs not only stay at its existing sites, but
also expand to three others.</p>
