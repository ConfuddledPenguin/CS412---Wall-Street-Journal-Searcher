	<p class="article-leader">An affiliate of First Gibraltar Bank FSB, the Texas thrift
formed almost two years ago as part of the controversial
Southwest Plan, acquired Oklahoma's largest thrift, Sooner
Federal Savings & Loan Association of Tulsa, and its $1.1
billion in deposits.
   The sale of Sooner Federal was announced Friday just hours
after the House Banking Committee heard testimony that the
government's costs under the 1988 Southwest Plan, including
the one that created First Gibraltar, are expected to reach
$54 billion, well above the original estimate of $39 billion.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>As much as $10 billion of those costs, including $1.8
billion in tax benefits, are part of the 10-year assistance
package that accompanied the First Gibraltar deal in December
1988. The thrift was formed with the acquisition of five
failed Texas thrifts by MacAndrews & Forbes Group Holdings
Inc., an investment group led by Revlon Inc. chairman Ronald
O. Perelman, and Ford Bank Group of Dallas.</p>
<p>Because of an ongoing review by the Resolution Trust
Corp., the federal thrift bailout agency, First Gibraltar
wasn't allowed to acquire Sooner Federal outright. Rather, it
used an affiliate thrift formed last March with the purchase
of San Antonio Savings Association, a $2.2 billion thrift.</p>
<p>In March, the RTC reversed its previous policy barring
sales of thrifts to federally assisted institutions, allowing
First Gibraltar to acquire San Antonio Savings. The San
Antonio thrift must be separately capitalized until the RTC
review is completed.</p>
<p>First Gibraltar San Antonio is acquiring all of the
deposits and 27 branches of Sooner Federal, which was placed
in RTC conservatorship last November. First Gibraltar is
paying $5.1 million for Sooner's deposits but isn't injecting
any capital into the thrift, according to First Gibraltar
Chairman Gerald Ford.</p>
<p>First Gibraltar is also acquiring $891.1 million of Sooner
Federal's assets, including cash, securities and $425.4
million in residential mortgage loans, but has 18 months to
return unwanted assets to the RTC.</p>
<p>The RTC is retaining $351.3 million in assets and
providing an initial outlay of about $155.7 million in cash
to First Gibraltar San Antonio. The agency estimates the
final cost of the deal at $148.7 million, based on expected
sales of assets.</p>
<p>First Gibraltar's bid for Sooner Federal was chosen over a
dozen other proposals submitted by seven banks, including
Fourth Financial Corp. of Wichita, Kan.</p>
<p>The acquisition marks the first time in recent history
that a Texas thrift has expanded its franchise outside the
Lone Star state. But at least one thrift consultant, William
Ferguson of Dallas, questioned the wisdom of the border
crossing, citing Oklahoma's "dismal business climate."</p>
<p>"I just don't see that much opportunity for lending in the
Southwest," Mr. Ferguson said, adding that the acquisition
does give First Gibraltar "a pretty good source for
reasonably low-cost deposits" to counter stiff competition in
Texas from NCNB Corp. and Banc One Corp.</p>
<p>Banc One's Texas unit on Friday acquired $250 million in
deposits from Capitol City Federal Savings Association of
Austin. Bank One Texas also acquired $156.2 million of the
thrift's $374.6 million in assets.</p>
<p>In other RTC actions on Friday:</p>
<p>First Network Federal Savings Bank of Los Angeles, with
$515 million in assets, was closed, and insured depositors
will be paid off. Deposits totaled about $373.9 million.</p>
<p>City Federal Savings & Loan Association of Birmingham,
Ala., was acquired by First Alabama Bancshares Inc. of
Montgomery, Ala. First Alabama acquired all of the thrift's
$497.1 million in deposits and $187 million of its $449.3
million in assets.</p>
<p>Meritbanc Savings Association of Houston and its $307.7
million in deposits were acquired by Kilgore Federal Savings
& Loan Association of Kilgore, Texas. Kilgore also purchased
$71.2 million of Meritbanc's $195.2 million in assets.</p>
<p>Deposits at French Market Homestead FSA of Metairie, La.,
were transferred to First National Bank of Commerce in New
Orleans. The thrift had $192.6 million in assets and $219.9
million in deposits.</p>
