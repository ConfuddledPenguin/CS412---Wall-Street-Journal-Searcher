	<p class="article-leader">CSX Corp. moved closer to acquiring the rail operations of
RF&P Corp.
   CSX, a Richmond, Va., freight transportation company,
agreed to a proposal under which it would acquire RF&P's rail
operations in exchange for CSX's 62.7% voting position in
RF&P.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Virginia Retirement System, which initiated the
transaction, would acquire CSX's remaining shares in RF&P for
$35 each. Virginia Retirement System, the second-largest
independent RF&P holder, owns about 28% of the combined
voting and nonvoting shares.</p>
<p>CSX said the proposed transaction would result in RF&P's
retaining all of its real estate while transferring to CSX
only its railroad operations in a tax-free transaction. RF&P
owns the 113-mile Richmond, Fredericksburg & Potomac
Railroad, which links the northern and southern parts of
CSX's rail system.</p>
<p>The transaction is subject to approval by RF&P's board,
the board of CSX, and Virginia Retirement System trustees.</p>
<p>This past spring, CSX offered to pay one share of its
common or $34.50 cash -- a total of $385 million -- for each
RF&P share it didn't already own. But CSX withdrew the offer
amid opposition from RF&P holders who deemed the bid too low.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>Corrections & Amplifications</p>
<p>CSX Corp. said the Virginia Retirement System proposed an
exchange of a portion of CSX's RF&P Corp. dividend
obligations for the stock of an RF&P subsidiary that holds
the RF&P railroad. The Virginia Retirement System also
proposed that it purchase CSX's remaining RF&P dividend
obligations and its RF&P voting shares at $35 a share. In
yesterday's edition, terms of the transaction were misstated.</p>
