	<p class="article-leader">Manpower PLC, the Anglo-American employment services group
formerly named Blue Arrow, said it is selling a large part of
its British operations to an investor group for #106 million
($199.6 million).
   The assets include the Blue Arrow Personnel Services and
Brook Street Bureau employment services units that formed
part of the original Blue Arrow group which bought
Milwaukee-based Manpower Inc. in 1987.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The investor group behind the purchase includes executive
directors of Brook Street as well as Chase Manhattan Bank,
Charterhouse Bank Ltd. and Prudential Venture Managers.</p>
<p>Manpower will take a 15% stake in the company formed to
make the purchase and will be allowed to put a representative
on its board, the company said.</p>
<p>Manpower will receive the payment in cash, though it has
promised to reinvest #2 million in variable-rate non-voting
preference shares. The exact consideration is subject to an
audit of the sold properties.</p>
<p>Mitchell Fromstein, who headed Manpower at the time of
Blue Arrow's hostile bid and who last year gained control of
the merged companies in a board-room coup, has set about
restructuring the debt-burdened company. Along with the name
change, he has proposed reincorporating the company in the
U.S.</p>
<p>Manpower said the sale reflects its desire to focus its
operations in the U.K. temporary help market under a single
brand name and eliminate competition among wholly owned units
of the company.</p>
