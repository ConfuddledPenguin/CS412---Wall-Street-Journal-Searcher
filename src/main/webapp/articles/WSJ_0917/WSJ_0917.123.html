	<p class="article-leader">RICHLAND, Wash. -- Washington Public Power Supply System
said it plans to sell $500 million of refunding revenue
bonds.
   The utility said $250 million of the bonds will be sold on
Sept. 25 and another $250 million will be sold within 45
days.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>WPPSS defaulted in 1983 on $2.25 billion of bonds, the
largest default in municipal bond history. This will be its
third bond sale this year and will complete its high-coupon
refunding program involving $3.5 billion of bonds. The new
securities, whose maturities range from two years to 27
years, involve WPPSS units 1 and 2, which didn't default, and
are guaranteed by the Bonneville Power Administration, a
regional power agency of the Energy Department. Goldman,
Sachs & Co. is senior manager.</p>
