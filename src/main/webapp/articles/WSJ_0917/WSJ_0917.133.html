	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- The New York Post just may live to see
tomorrow, but the newspaper has come to represent a dying
breed.
   Post owner Peter Kalikow gave the paper a reprieve late
Friday, allowing the Newspaper Guild to vote on a
salary-slashing proposal that calls for a four-day work week
and 20% cut in pay. The Guild, which represents reporters,
editors, and advertising staff, is expected to approve the
proposal, under pressure, if only to save the jobs of other
union members.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Mr. Kalikow, who has lost $80 million on the Post in two
and a half years, vows to close the paper immediately if the
proposal is not ratified tonight at a 6 p.m. meeting.</p>
<p>The 189-year-old Post has lived by the sword and it could
die by the sword. Its trademark brand of journalism is rarely
seen anymore in American newspapers: a rough-and-tumble,
street-wise style, that mirrors both the passions and
prejudices of a polyglot New York readership. Headline
classics such as "Headless Body In Topless Bar," "Shark Eats
Man Alive," and "Best Sex I Ever Had" have played well in New
York.</p>
<p>New Yorkers may yet see more of these hard-to-forget
headlines. But industry consultants, analysts, and even other
tabloid publishers, say the Post's incendiary, blood-and-guts
brand of tabloid newspaper has quickly become an anachronism.</p>
<p>Even in the hands of its current editor, the
tough-talking, glib Jerry Nachman, a Brooklyn native who
virtually personifies a city tabloid editor, the Post's
circulation has sunk to desperate lows. Circulation once
soared under then-owner Rupert Murdoch in the 1980s.
Bolstered by readers sweepstakes and tantalizing crime
stories, Post circulation reached 962,000 in 1983; for the
six months ended March 31, Post circulation has dropped 6%
from a year earlier to 504,000. Circulation at New York's
"upscale market" papers, New York Newsday and the New York
Times, both moved up in the same period.</p>
<p>Considered a mass-market crowd pleaser, tabloid-style
journalism has rarely been a winner in the last two decades.
Mr. Murdoch tried it in Chicago with the Sun-Times, gaining
readers but losing advertisers. The Toronto Sun Publishing
Corp. bought and transformed the Houston Post into a racy tab
in the early 1980s, after which the Post lost valuable market
share to the cross-town rival Houston Chronicle. In both
cities, new owners were faced with toning down the racy
style, usually to regain lost advertisers.</p>
<p>In St. Louis, Ingersoll Publications Co. created a new
tabloid in the fall of 1989. Less sensational than most,
Ingersoll's St. Louis Sun played up crime, hired combative
columnists, and kept a conservative political stance, all a
counterpoint to Pulitzer Publishing Co.'s St. Louis
Post-Dispatch, the entrenched broadsheet. The Sun set after
only seven months due to high delivery cost, lackluster
street sales, and lack of consistent advertising from St.
Louis' most prestigious advertisers.</p>
<p>"Demographic shifts are against papers like the Post,"
said James Dolan, a former Sun-Times executive and now a
media investment banker with Jordan Group. "The people most
likely to read a newspaper today are least likely to be
interested in what tabloids have to offer. The traditional
tabloid reader gets what he wants from TV."</p>
<p>Even if the Post were winning over legions of new readers,
it would present a dilemma, according to John Morton,
newspaper industry analyst with Lynch, Jones & Ryan. While
Mr. Murdoch boosted circulation with games like Wingo, the
Post's share of the New York advertising market remains low.
"If you are losing money on every copy sold, the more you
sell the more you lose because of increased paper and
distribution costs," said Mr. Morton.</p>
<p>Mr. Kalikow hired magazine editor Jane Amsterdam in 1988
to raise the paper's "journalistic standards and practices."
She played down the sensational sex stories and played up
investigative pieces. For a brief time, uptown department
stores took ads in the Post. But after run-ins with Mr.
Kalikow over editorial direction, Ms. Amsterdam left a year
later, succeeded by Mr. Nachman.</p>
<p>"The problem is the ad market has targeted a whole other
group of reader," said Ms. Amsterdam.</p>
<p>Tabloids are by no means dead, but they are being updated
for baby boomers.</p>
<p>Times Mirror Co.'s New York Newsday straddles the line
between gritty street news and full coverage of the arts and
magazine-length feature stories. In Pawtucket, R.I., Robert
Jelenic, chief executive of Journal Register Co., which
includes the U.S. papers once belonging to Ralph Ingersoll,
plans a tabloid-style remake of the Evening Times, but with a
difference.</p>
<p>"You can't get by today just on pretty girls on page 3 and
crime stories," said Mr. Jelenic. "You must have opinionated
columnists, good reporters, and you gotta break stories."</p>
<p>Under Mr. Nachman, the Post has done its share of that,
breaking some of the biggest stories of the year in New York
City. In an interview Saturday, however, Mr. Nachman said "it
won't be easy" publishing the Post with reporters and editors
on four-day work weeks.</p>
<p>Mr. Nachman vows not to be the last editor of the New York
Post. "The Post is like the Vietcong," he said. "You shoot
them . . . but they get back up and spray you with machine
gun fire . . . . the Post has a history of overcoming all
sorts of baroque obstacles."</p>
