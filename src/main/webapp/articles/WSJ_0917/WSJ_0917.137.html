	<p class="article-leader">Data General Corp. said it settled two shareholder
lawsuits, agreeing to pay the plaintiff classes a total of $6
million.
   The five-year-old suits, Malanka vs. Data General and
Lewis vs. de Castro, had charged that Data General executives
including Edson de Castro, then president and chief executive
officer, had sold stock before announcing negative news about
the company.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Neither Data General, a minicomputer maker in Westboro,
Mass., nor the executives admitted any liability. Data
General said insurance will cover a portion of the
settlement.</p>
<p>Data General also said it was sued in U.S. District Court
in Boston in another shareholder suit charging the company
made misleading statements about its business earlier this
year. The company said it believes the suit is without merit.</p>
