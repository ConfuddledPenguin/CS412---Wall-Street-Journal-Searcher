	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- American Home Products Corp. is expected to
announce today that it acquired the rights to one of the more
promising experimental vaccines being tested for AIDS.
   The consumer products and pharmaceutical company, whose
Wyeth-Ayerst division is one of the country's largest drug
makers, has agreed to help MicroGeneSys Inc. develop its
VaxSyn HIV-1 product, according to officials at both
companies. VaxSyn is one of three AIDS vaccines under
especially intense study, and, of the three, has undergone
the most advanced human tests.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Officials at both companies declined to provide exact
financial details of the transaction. But an official at
closely held MicroGeneSys said that American Home made a
"substantial investment" in the small West Haven, Conn.,
company. American Home is also expected to make significant
payments to MicroGeneSys if the vaccine should clear certain
scientific hurdles over the next few years.</p>
<p>The acquisition immediately makes American Home one of the
more important players among large U.S. drug makers seeking
therapies for acquired immune deficiency syndrome.
Previously, the company hadn't been involved in any
AIDS-related project of note. MicroGeneSys, which was formed
to develop an AIDS vaccine, now has a powerhouse drug company
behind it -- as do the other contending vaccine developers --
to fuel the heavy costs of human trials.</p>
<p>Merck & Co. has a similar arrangement with Repligen Corp.,
a Cambridge, Mass., company. A significant share of Genentech
Inc. of South San Francisco recently was acquired by
Hoffmann-La Roche Inc., and Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. already
owns Oncogen of Seattle. Repligen, Genetech and Oncogen are
developing AIDS vaccines somewhat similar to the one created
by MicroGeneSys.</p>
<p>"The arrangement gives us access to Wyeth's expertise in
moving the product through the (Food and Drug Administration)
approval process as well as necessary funding to carry out
the studies," said Franklin Volvovitz, chairman and president
of MicroGeneSys.</p>
<p>Mr. Volvovitz said the company began searching for a
partner earlier this year when it realized that the small
company couldn't fund "all the studies to meet federal
government's demands" and that "the government wasn't going
to provide the funds we needed.</p>
<p>The agreement with American Home comes just three months
after scientists at Johns Hopkins University medical school
reported the results of tests in which VaxSyn boosted the
ability of blood cells to seek out and kill cells infected
with the AIDS virus. The vaccine was given to healthy
volunteers, and their blood was then tested against the virus
in test-tube studies. Earlier in the year, researchers at
Walter Reed Army Medical Center reported that the product
boosted some aspects of the immune system of a handful of
AIDS patients.</p>
<p>VaxSyn is a subunit vaccine that is made from one protein,
called gp160, on the surface of the AIDS virus. Scientists
believe this protein alone may stimulate the body's defense
to fight off the virus. MicroGeneSys is testing its product
both as a vaccine to prevent infection and as a treatment for
people already infected. VaxSyn was the first vaccine product
to gain FDA approval for human tests in 1987.</p>
<p>In the past year, VaxSyn has gained increasing interest
among AIDS researchers, and it is the subject of several
reports expected to be released next month at an
International AIDS meeting in Florida.</p>
