	<p class="article-leader">DETROIT -- Two Japanese auto makers announced relatively
modest price increases on several 1991 models, moves that
could fuel their quest for a still-higher share of the U.S.
car market.
   Honda Motor Co. and Nissan Motor Co. appear to be using
pricing tactics sharply different from Detroit's Big Three
auto makers, which are coupling steeper base-price increases
with big rebates on the new models even before they hit the
showrooms.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"Net of rebates, Detroit and the Japanese are raising
prices by about the same amount," said auto analyst Ronald
Glantz of Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. "Detroit is following the
policy of the biggest rebate ever, while Japan is following
the policy that rebates cheapen image."</p>
<p>Honda said it was raising the base price of its 1991
Accord, the top-selling car model in the U.S., by $200, or
1.6% from the 1990 model. That will put the cheapest Accord
DX four-door sedan at $12,545, compared with $13,717 for the
cheapest Ford Taurus, one of its major competitors.</p>
<p>Ford Motor Co. had raised the base price of the 1991
Taurus by $1,077, or 8.5%. But Ford yesterday announced a
$750 rebate on the 1991 Taurus, thus making its effective
price $12,967. The rebate leaves the least expensive Taurus
priced more than $400 above the cheapest Accord. However, an
automatic transmission is standard on the Taurus but a $750
option on the Accord, which comes with a five-speed manual
transmission as standard.</p>
<p>"The Accord is already a successful car," says analyst
John Casesa of Wertheim Schroder & Co., "This kind of
restraint in pricing will allow it to be really successful."
A Honda spokesman said the company was looking to "gain
market share in 1991 as well as 1990."</p>
<p>Honda didn't announce prices on any of its other cars
beside the Accord sedan. But that single model accounts for
more than 40% of Honda's U.S. sales.</p>
<p>Nissan, meanwhile, said it was raising the base price of
most models between 1.7% and 2.7%. However, a big exception
is the Sentra, completely redone for this year. It will start
at $7,999, a $600 or 8.1% increase from the current model.</p>
<p>Nissan's car and truck sales in the U.S. dropped 4.9%
through July 31, making it the only major Japanese auto maker
to lose market share this year. Overall, Japanese car makers
took a record 28% of the U.S. car market in the first half of
1990.</p>
<p>Yesterday, Nissan released prices on all of its models
except for the upscale Maxima. The base price of the 1991
Nissan Stanza will be $11,900, a 2.1% increase from 1990. The
Nissan 240SX will start at $13,609, a 2.7% rise.</p>
<p>Nissan lowered the base price of its 300ZX sports car to
$27,300 from $28,600, a decrease of 4.5%. However, the
company eliminated the car's standard "T-bar" roof, which now
must be purchased as an option. With the T-bar roof the car
now costs $29,100, a 1.7% increase from 1990.</p>
<p>The Nissan Pathfinder sports utility vehicle will have a
base price of $16,120, a 2.5% increase. The cheapest
Pathfinder with four-wheel drive will be $17,695, a 2.3%
increase.</p>
<p>The leading Japanese auto maker, Toyota Motor Corp.,
expects to release prices later this week. "All I can tell
you is that our price increases will be moderate," a Toyota
spokesman said.</p>
<p>The Japanese have gained some pricing flexibility over the
past year because of the value of the yen. After several
years of rising against the U.S. dollar, the yen stabilized
earlier this year. The yen currently trades at 144.05 to the
dollar.</p>
<p>Earlier, General Motors Corp. and Ford announced price
increases of 4% or more on most of their models. Chrysler
Corp. put a big 12% increase on its minivans, but actually
cut prices on some less-popular vehicles.</p>
<p>As expected, Ford yesterday followed GM and Chrysler in
announcing rebates on nearly all of its 1991 models. The
rebates range from $1,000 on Grand Marquis and Ranger to $500
on cars such as Mustang and Escort. Buyers can take cut-rate
financing instead of cash.</p>
