	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Walter Yetnikoff, chief executive officer of
Sony Corp.'s CBS Records unit, is stepping down immediately,
accelerating previous plans to leave his post after two
years.
   Sony didn't name a successor, saying the company's three
top executives under Mr. Yetnikoff will continue to operate
their divisions while company directors undertake "a
long-term succession review."</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>As previously reported, Sony and CBS Records insiders said
last month that Mr. Yetnikoff, 57 years old, signed a new
contract specifying that he would step down after two years,
helping to groom a successor and remaining as a consultant
thereafter. Mr. Yetnikoff at the time denied that he planned
to step down, and Sony issued a statement supporting the
flamboyant, outspoken executive.</p>
<p>Morever, this week's Billboard, the music industry trade
publication, quoted Mr. Yetnikoff denying reports of his
departure, and stating that he had a new three-year contract.
Billboard said Mr. Yetnikoff would decide at its expiration
whether he wanted to leave the company.</p>
<p>A spokesman for Mr. Yetnikoff said he was unavailable
yesterday to elaborate on his statement. Although he never
publicly announced any intention of leaving, he said in the
statement that he has decided to accelerate his previously
announced intention to step down as head of the company. "I
intend to go on sabbatical now," Mr. Yetnikoff said, adding
that after a few months' leave, he will work with Sony
president Norio Ohga on "long-term projects affecting the
future growth of Sony."</p>
<p>CBS Records' three top executives include Tommy Mottola,
president of CBS Records' domestic division; Robert Summer,
president of CBS Records International; and Neil Keating,
president of Columbia Record Club. Mr. Mottola, a former rock
group manager who was brought in by Mr. Yetnikoff, has been
regarded by some as the most likely successor, though some
industry observers note he has no experience in running a
huge international record operation.</p>
<p>The three executives will report directly to Mr. Ohga, who
is also chairman of CBS Records.</p>
<p>Some industry executives had speculated that the record
company might be put under the control of Peter Guber, chief
executive of Sony's Columbia Pictures Entertainment Inc.
unit. But people familiar with Sony's plans said that
scenario is unlikely. Mr. Guber has his hands full running
Columbia's far-flung entertainment operations, and knows
virtually nothing about the record business.</p>
<p>In a statement, Mr. Ohga said CBS Records "has never been
in better shape, both financially and operationally . . ..
This is a good time for Mr. Yetnikoff to focus on his other
priorities and for us to continue to build an organization
and management structure appropriate to CBS Records future
growth potential."</p>
<p>Company insiders said Mr. Yetnikoff wasn't pushed out, but
was under increasing pressure to make room for the next
generation of managers to advance at the company. In his
statement, Mr. Ohga praised Mr. Yetnikoff, who is credited
with turning the company into the industry's leading record
company. "Mr. Yetnikoff's record speaks for itself," Mr. Ohga
said. "The company has grown and prospered under his
leadership."</p>
