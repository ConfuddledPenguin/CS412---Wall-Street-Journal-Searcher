	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- In directionless trading, the dollar drifted
below its levels in London late Monday against all major
currencies except the Canadian dollar. However, compared with
its late-Friday New York quotes, the greenback rose against
several currencies.
   In the absence of fresh ideas, many dealers said they
would await Friday's release of the August U.S. employment
report before making any big decisions.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"The market is still trading like a summertime market,"
said Donald Hubbard, a Midland Bank treasury officer in New
York. "It will take a few days to pick up."</p>
<p>Late in the New York trading day, the dollar was quoted at
1.5815 marks, down from 1.5837 marks late Monday in London,
but higher than 1.5755 marks late Friday in New York. The
U.S. currency was also changing hands at 143.50 yen, below
143.53 yen in London late Monday and 143.79 yen late Friday
in New York.</p>
<p>In Tokyo Wednesday, the Nikkei index plunged another
750.77 points to close the morning session at 24156.87.</p>
<p>Monday's Labor Day holiday in the U.S. and Canada has
traditionally marked the shift to more intense market
activity, but Iraq's early-August invasion of Kuwait put a
twist in the normal cycle, traders said.</p>
<p>The eagerness for Friday's U.S. economic data is
understandable. The currency market, which for a month has
bought the dollar on the prospect of war and sold it on
fundamentals, will get its first look at the effect higher
oil prices have had on a weak U.S. economy.</p>
<p>John Elliott, a Bank of America vice president in Los
Angeles, said the North American market had no intention of
pushing the dollar significantly higher yesterday, but was
poised to send it lower if U.S. stock prices matched losses
of other markets around the world. However, the Dow Jones
Industrial Average ended off less than a point.</p>
<p>Mark-yen trading continued to be a focus of dealings, but
showed no more decision than dollar activity.</p>
<p>The mark was quoted in late New York trading at 90.737
yen, above 90.62 yen late Monday in London, but well below
91.266 yen in New York Friday.</p>
<p>Thomas Benfer, a senior currency marketing representative
in New York for Bank of Montreal, said the mark's decline
from 92.081 yen last Wednesday reflects a gradual reaction to
Japan's decision Thursday to lift its discount rate to 6%
from 5.25%.</p>
<p>The mark, like the yen, has benefited all summer from
expectations that German interest rates will rise. But
Monday, Karl Thomas, a Bundesbank policy maker, said the
costs of German reunion won't necessarily lead to higher
domestic interest rates. Three-month government paper yields
more than 8% in West Germany, compared with 7% in Japan.</p>
<p>The Canadian dollar continued to slide from its recent
12-year peak. In late New York trading, it was quoted at
86.18 U.S. cents, dropping from 86.69 cents in London Monday
and 86.42 cents in New York Friday. Only slightly more than a
week ago, the Canadian dollar purchased more than 88.5 cents.</p>
<p>A report Friday that Canada's gross domestic product
shrank at an annualized rate of 1.6% in the second quarter
intensified a belief that Canada may beat the U.S. into
recession. Given those poor economic prospects, Mr. Benfer
said, "the feeling is that the Bank of Canada will have no
recourse" but to loosen credit some more.</p>
<p>Sterling, after losing last week most of its 10-cent
August gain, found a little support yesterday. It was quoted
late in New York at $1.8790, compared with $1.8730 late
Monday in London and $1.8905 Friday in New York.</p>
<p>The dollar ended European trading slightly higher,
supported by technical considerations.</p>
<p>Activity in the European market was centered around the
European Monetary System, where the lira and the peseta lost
ground against the German currency.</p>
<p>Milan dealers said the Bank of Italy has recently
increased liquidity in the domestic money market, pushing
short-term interest rates sharply lower. Overnight lira rates
dropped to less than 1% Monday night.</p>
<p>The dollar finished Asian trading mixed, up against the
yen but lower against the pound and the mark. It was last
quoted in Tokyo Tuesday at 144.05 yen, above 143.55 yen late
Monday.</p>
<p>Traders said the market experienced a correction following
the yen's strong gains over the last few trading days against
European currencies.</p>
<p>Separately, on the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold
for current delivery settled at $383.70 an ounce, up $1.40.
Estimated volume was a moderate 3.5 million ounces.</p>
<p>In Hong Kong Wednesday, gold was quoted at $384.60 an
ounce.</p>
