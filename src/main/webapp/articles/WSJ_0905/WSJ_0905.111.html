	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Wall Street's hopes for a quick shot in the
arm from the $170 billion market for privately placed stocks
and bonds are fast being dashed.
   U.S. private-placement financings plunged by one-third in
this year's first half to $55.3 billion from $82.1 billion a
year earlier -- accounting for just one-quarter of all stock
and bond financings, according to IDD Information Services.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>That's the first time in more than a decade that the
volume of privately placed securities has dropped, IDD says;
the market has grown steadily from $15.6 billion in 1980. The
plunge primarily reflects the drying up of the market for
high-yield, low-rated junk bond markets and a dearth of
acquisition-related financing.</p>
<p>With new regulatory rules making it easier for securities
firms to trade in the market for privately placed securities,
Wall Street had been expecting that private placements would
help fill the gap created by the slump in other areas of the
securities business. The SEC's new rule 144a exempts U.S. and
foreign institutions from registration requirements for the
sale of stocks and bonds to big institutions.</p>
<p>But the private market, which is limited to institutions
and is largely used to sell corporate debt, has been hit
harder by the financing slump than the public market for
stocks and bonds.</p>
<p>"Neither the passage of rule 144a nor the gap left in
corporate financings by the virtual disappearance of the
junk-bond market could boost the sagging private placement
market this year," IDD said.</p>
<p>The recent Mideast turmoil, however, may actually boost
the private market, some analysts say. That's because
securities firms may increasingly tap the private market now
that the public financing environment has stumbled.</p>
<p>"There may be more private placements if the Dow Jones
Industrial average just kind of drifts away over the next
eight to 12 months," said Perrin Long, senior securities
analyst for Lipper Analytical Securities Corp.</p>
<p>Financings fell in most categories of the private market,
with the biggest drops in placements of non-investment grade
bonds and placements for employee stock-ownership plans; both
plunged more than 70% in 1990's first half compared with the
yearearlier period.</p>
<p>Overall, private placements made up 26% of all stock and
bond financings, IDD said, down from a 38% market share in
1989.</p>
<p>Goldman, Sachs & Co. continues to lead the
private-placement underwriting rankings, maintaining a 15%
market share. But Goldman's volume fell 32% from 1989's first
half, to $8.1 billion.</p>
<p>Underwritings by Salomon Brothers Inc., meanwhile,
actually jumped by one-third during the first half, to $5.6
billion, representing a 10% market share. The increase
propelled Salomon to No. 2 from the eighth position a year
ago, IDD said.</p>
<p>Commercial banks have picked up some ground. Nine of the
top 20 privateplacement underwriters in this year's first
half are commercial banks, IDD said, with a combined
one-third market share. Banks' particular strength:
Acquisition-related placements and those for non-investment
grade debt.</p>
