	<p class="article-leader">BOSTON -- Healthco International Inc., in the midst of a
proxy fight, said it agreed to be acquired by Dallas buy-out
specialists Hicks, Muse & Co. for $19.25 a share in cash, or
about $250 million.
   But dissident shareholders -- who are seeking control of
Healthco's board -- immediately criticized the price as
"ludicrously" low.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"I am livid at the treatment of the shareholders and the
sale of this company at such a low price," said Emanuel
Pearlman, executive general partner at New York-based Gemini
Partners L.P. Gemini, an investment concern that owns 9.96%
of Healthco's shares, is seeking to elect a slate of seven
directors at Healthco's annual meeting tomorrow.</p>
<p>A person close to Healthco, noting that the company has
been seeking offers for several months, said the Hicks Muse
offer was the best that was made and that Healthco considers
it fair. In national over-the-counter trading yesterday,
Healthco's shares closed at $17.875, down 37.5 cents.</p>
<p>In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission,
Gemini has said that Healthco, a dental equipment concern,
should be sold or financially restructured, although it
doesn't intend to make a bid for the company. Gemini holds
770,100 Healthco common shares, bought at an average price of
$13.73 a share.</p>
<p>Mr. Pearlman added that if Gemini's candidates are elected
to the board, they will "work to get a better price." Mr.
Pearlman wouldn't say what price Gemini would consider
acceptable or whether Gemini plans to vote against the
proposed transaction, which is subject to shareholder
approval. Shareholders won't vote on the acquisition at the
annual meeting tomorrow, but instead at a meeting sometime
this fall, Healthco said.</p>
<p>Healthco said the acquisition will "significantly benefit
Healthco's future growth and development" and maximize "the
value of our stockholders' investment." The company added
that no management participation was included in the buy-out.</p>
<p>In the first half, Healthco had net income of $3 million,
or 39 cents a share, on revenue of $115.8 million. A year
earlier, net was $2.8 million, or 36 cents a share, on
revenue of $108.8 million.</p>
<p>Thomas O. Hicks, chairman and chief executive officer of
Hicks Muse, wouldn't comment on the acquisition. But the
Healthco deal is in keeping with Mr. Hicks' stated goal of
buying $3 billion of companies over the next two or three
years. Mr. Hicks and his partners have already assembled a
war chest of $170 million from institutions, Dallas companies
and wealthy individuals, and are shooting to boost that
buy-out fund to $300 million.</p>
<p>Before Mr. Hicks split with longtime partner Robert Haas
last year, Hicks, Haas & Co. negotiated a dozen deals in
three years and transformed $90 million of investments into
cash and equity valued at $1.7 billion.</p>

of $5.3 million, or 66 cents a share, on revenue of $211.7
million. The figures were reported incorrectly in yesterday's
edition.</p>
