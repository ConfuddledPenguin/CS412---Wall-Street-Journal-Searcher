	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Stock prices closed mixed as some late
bargain-hunting blunted the impact of an early sell-off,
sparked by a surge in oil prices and further evidence of
weakness in the economy.
   Trading remained extremely light, with volume on the New
York Stock Exchange setting its second consecutive low for
the year, as the passing of the Labor Day holiday failed to
bring investors back from the sidelines.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"It looks like some people decided to extend their
vacation another day," said Richard Meyer, head of
institutional trading at Ladenburg, Thalmann & Co.</p>
<p>The Dow Jones Industrial Average tumbled about 30 points
within minutes of the opening and showed double-digit losses
through most of the session. But as a result of the market's
late turnaround, the average finished with a loss of just
0.99 at 2613.37.</p>
<p>Broader market indexes managed to post modest gains.
Standard & Poor's 500-Stock Index went up 0.53 to 323.09, the
New York Stock Exchange Composite Index gained 0.16 to 177.13
and the Dow Jones Equity Market Index added 0.44 to 299.25.</p>
<p>Just 92,940,000 shares were traded on the Big Board, down
slightly from 96,480,000 shares traded Friday. Declining
issues led advancers by 814 to 673.</p>
<p>John A. Conlon Jr., a managing director at Rothschild
Inc., said the unusually low trading activity is "indicative
of an inordinate amount of indecision" among traders. "It's
really hard to come up with a strong case for equities at
this point," he said.</p>
<p>One big question in investors minds is the future of
corporate profits. Weak dividend payments may be one
indication that profits are in a downturn. Yesterday,
Standard & Poor's Corp. said that the number of companies
decreasing dividends rose to 81 in the year to date through
August, compared with 57 in 1989. Companies omitting
dividends rose to 166 compared to 89 for the same period last
year. The number of companies boosting dividends shrank to
904 for the period, compared with 1,155 in the same period a
year earlier.</p>
<p>October crude-oil futures soared $1.80 to $29.12 a barrel
as New York trading resumed following the holiday, during
which oil prices rose sharply overseas. The surge helped set
the tone for stocks early in the session.</p>
<p>A disappointing report from the nation's purchasing
managers also put early pressure on the market, traders said.
An index of economic activity derived from the group's
monthly survey fell to 47% in August from 47.4% in July; a
reading below 50% indicates that the economy's manufacturing
sector is contracting.</p>
<p>But the market eased its fall as investors began looking
forward to Friday's employment report, seen by some analysts
as a possible prelude to an easing of Federal Reserve policy.
The market then recovered in the final hour of trading.</p>
<p>Energy stocks, bolstered by the latest jump in oil prices,
held steady as the overall market slumped, and closed with
modest gains. USX, the parent company of Marathon Oil,
climbed 3/4 to 32 7/8; Texaco went up 1/4 to 62; Mobil added
1/2 to 64 3/8; Amoco advanced 1 1/4 to 56 1/4; and Unocal
rose 1/2 to 32 1/2.</p>
<p>Archer-Daniels-Midland, a potential beneficiary of higher
oil prices, added 7/8 to 23 7/8. The Wall Street Journal said
yesterday in its "Heard on the Street" column that analysts
expect the ethanol industry's fortunes to improve because of
the Persian Gulf crisis. The company is widely viewed as the
lowest-cost producer in the ethanol industry.</p>
<p>Union Texas Petroleum Holdings rose 7/8 to 23 3/4 amid
speculation that Chinese Petroleum, Taiwan's national oil and
gas company, will make a takeover offer. An official at a
U.S. unit of Chinese Petroleum confirmed the Taiwanese firm's
interest in the company but wouldn't elaborate, according to
Dow Jones Professional Investor Report. Allied-Signal, which
holds a 40% stake in Union Texas, dipped 1/8 to 30 7/8.</p>
<p>Pinnacle West Capital, the Big Board's most active issue,
tumbled 3 3/4 to 12 3/8 on about two million shares after
PacifiCorp agreed to end its 10-month battle to acquire the
company, agreeing instead to a pact allowing seasonal "power
swaps" with its Arizona Public Service unit. PacifiCorp
gained 1/2 to 19 7/8.</p>
<p>Boeing rose 3/8 at 48 5/8 after receiving $6 billion in
firm orders and options from Asiana Airlines, a South Korean
carrier.</p>
<p>McDonnell Douglas gained 1 to 43 5/8; GPA Group of
Ireland, an aircraft leasing firm, placed an order valued at
about $2.5 billion for its MD-11 long-range aircraft.</p>
<p>Advanced Micro Devices added 1/4 to 5 5/8. The company is
expected this fall to unveil its version of Intel's popular
80386 microprocessor, and could have an easier time if two
legal disputes are decided in its favor.</p>
<p>Sotheby's Holdings skidded 3/4 to 11 7/8. About 300 of its
key employees became eligible for the first time to exercise
options allowing them to buy up to 2.5 million shares at a
huge discount and resell them at the market price.</p>
<p>Equimark, whose board decided to omit a quarterly dividend
on its common shares, fell 5/8 to 5. The stock had jumped a
point Friday amid news that the Tisch family has acquired a
6.8% stake.</p>
<p>Entergy gained 3/4 to 19 1/8. Its board decided to boost
by $135 million the amount it can spend on stock repurchases
under an ongoing buy-back program.</p>
<p>Raytheon, which said its Caloric unit plans to close its
appliance-manufacturing operations in Topton, Pa., rose 1 1/8
to 61 3/4. The company said it expects to take a
third-quarter pretax charge of $17.5 million for the
shutdown.</p>
<p>Allergan rose 1/4 to 15 1/2 following news that it plans
to repurchase up to 1.2 million of its common shares.
Separately, the company said a federal court upheld its
patent on Ultrazyme, a contact lens-care product that works
with hydrogen peroxide.</p>
<p>The American Stock Exchange Market Value Index fell 0.65
to 322.74. Volume totaled 8,790,000 shares.</p>
<p>Kinark went down 1/4 to 5. The company said its agreement
to sell its Camelot Hotels for $12 million to Wilmae, a Santa
Rosa, Calif.-based concern, was terminated after Wilmae ran
into delays in obtaining financing.</p>
