	<p class="article-leader">Amgen Inc. committed up to $53 million over several years
to Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc., a biotechnology concern
that has identified certain proteins, called neurotrophic
factors, that may play a significant role in human nerve
tissue.
   Amgen and Regeneron hope that these factors may be useful
in the treatment of a variety of neurological disorders and
injuries.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Amgen, a Thousand Oaks, Calif., biotechnology concern,
said it paid $15 million in exchange for Regeneron
convertible preferred stock equal to about a 7% stake in the
company. In addition, Amgen will pay $10 million over two
years to fund Regeneron research and development of two
growth factors, Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF) and
Neurotrophin-3 (NT-3).</p>
<p>Amgen will provide $15 million more in the third through
fifth years if Regeneron meets certain technological and
commercial benchmarks, said Leonard Schleifer, Regeneron
president and chief executive officer. The agreement also
calls for Amgen to make $13 million in milestone payments, of
which the first $1 million has already been made.</p>
<p>Dr. Schleifer declined to say when the company expects to
request regulatory approval to begin human tests of the two
factors, which he described as "drug candidates" that have
already been "discovered, cloned and expressed." Regeneron, a
Tarrytown, N.Y., private biotechnology concern, has 75
employees.</p>
