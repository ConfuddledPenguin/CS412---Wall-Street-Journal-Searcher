	<p class="article-leader">PARIS -- In a further sign of their tough stands on the
Mideast crisis, both France and Britain have cut off all
military equipment deliveries to Jordan.
   The French decision, involving a multibillion-franc order
for Mirage fighter jets, has until now been kept secret. The
British decision, focusing initially on a smaller delivery of
artillery shells, had been made public but was
little-noticed.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>French officials declined to say whether they had
coordinated their decision with allies. But one French source
called France's military embargo a "protective measure,"
aimed at ensuring that none of the equipment is passed to
Iraq, which has been receiving supplies overland from Jordan.</p>
<p>The French sources said only Iraq and Jordan are currently
subject to France's military embargo, as the French consider
Jordan their only current military client likely to pass
equipment on to Iraq. The Jordanian embargo affects only
military goods, unlike that of Iraq, which involves all
trade.</p>
<p>"Either you are serious about this crisis or you aren't"
said one French official privately, explaining the embargo on
Jordan and the tough approach to Iraq. He also said French
troops would be prepared to fight alongside the U.S. in the
event of a Middle East war.</p>
<p>U.S. officials said the U.S. hasn't embargoed arms
shipments to Jordan, essentially because it has almost no
offensive military shipments planned. The U.S. currently is
shipping just spare parts and minor items such as jeeps, and
didn't see the value of an embargo, these officials said. The
U.S. has supplied little military aid to Jordan in recent
years because of congressional cutbacks, and without aid
there are few U.S. arms sales to Jordan.</p>
<p>Indeed, both the Europeans and the Americans appear to be
using a carrot-and-stick approach with Jordan's King Hussein.
King Hussein, long a U.S. ally, is caught between that
commitment and the pro-Iraqi sentiment of many Jordanians and
Palestinians living in Jordan.</p>
<p>The U.S. has gone out of its way in public to call Jordan
a friend. Asked yesterday whether he thought Jordan was
breaking United Nations sanctions against Iraq, Presidential
Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater said King Hussein pledged
during a meeting with President Bush last month to abide by
the sanctions. "Overall we think they are working fine," Mr.
Fitzwater said.</p>
<p>The French are following the same policy. After a meeting
Monday between King Hussein and French President Francois
Mitterrand, France pledged $750,000 in emergency aid to help
Jordan deal with a flood of refugees from Kuwait. But
secretly, France had made it clear to the king before he
arrived that he wouldn't get any weapons until he moved into
the anti-Iraq camp.</p>
<p>Official sources here say the king avoided raising the
military deliveries issue with Mr. Mitterrand, apparently
because he knew it was pointless. In his talks with French
officials, he focused on the broad question of how to end the
crisis.</p>
<p>The main French contract affected is a sale of Mirage 2000
jets by Dassault Aviation S.A., whose business in both Iraq
and Jordan stands to suffer from France's Mideast policy.</p>
<p>The sale to Jordan was agreed to in April 1988 and
involves a large number of jet fighters. Dassault and the
government refuse to say how many. One source said more than
a dozen airplanes are on order and few if any have been
delivered. Dassault also had been hoping for a big Mirage
sale to Iraq, which now seems impossible.</p>
<p>Official sources said other French military sales to
Jordan also are embargoed, but wouldn't say what kind of
equipment is involved.</p>
<p>In Britain, a spokesman for the Department of Trade and
Industry said the British government last week revoked all
licenses for exports of military equipment to Jordan. He said
Britain's decision isn't "ironclad," and it may authorize
some arms sales to Jordan in the future. So far it hasn't
chosen to do so.</p>
<p>The British decision was provoked when customs authorities
noted that a merchant ship, the MV Tara, was preparing to
sail from Hull with a cargo of British-made artillery shells
ordered by Jordan. The export license was revoked, the
weapons were unloaded and the ship left without them.</p>
<p>British authorities wouldn't put a value on the military
exports that are suspended, but said the amount is small.
British exports to Jordan, both military and civilian,
totaled #111 million ($210 million) in 1988.</p>
<p>France's stiff opposition to Iraq's invasion of Kuwait has
surprised some diplomats, because France has for years tried
to build links to Iraq. Along with the Soviet Union, it has
been Iraq's main military supplier. Moscow has also cut off
arms shipments to Baghdad.</p>
<p>French officials say the government for years has in fact
been split into a pro-Iraq camp and a camp seeking better
relations with Iran. After the invasion, pro-Iraqi officials
such as Defense Minister Jean-Pierre Chevenement have had to
toe the official anti-Iraq line, much as they privately
dislike it. The group favoring closer ties to Iran, led by
Foreign Minister Roland Dumas, has gained favor, officials
here say.</p>
<p>One French official said France now favors a total
blockade of Iraq, including air and land shipments.
Currently, though all shipments to Iraq except emergency
supplies are embargoed, the military blockade focuses on
ships. The Western powers aren't trying to stop air traffic
into Iraq.</p>
<p>This official said France even would be prepared to use
its aircraft to prevent air shipments into Iraq, because it
believes the current embargo isn't effective enough.</p>
