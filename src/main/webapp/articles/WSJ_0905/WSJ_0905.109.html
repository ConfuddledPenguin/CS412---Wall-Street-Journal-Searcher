	<p class="article-leader">Coal & Allied Industries Ltd. of Australia, a coal
producer, reported that operating profit after taxes for the
year ended June 30 soared to 60.3 million Australian dollars
(US$49.1 million) from A$2.4 million a year earlier, citing
an increase in coal sales, higher selling prices in
U.S.-dollar terms and a lower Australian dollar.
   Per-share earnings more than doubled to A$1.136 from 47
Australian cents. Total operating revenue rose 28% to A$603.9
million from A$470.5 million. Saying that increased
efficiency and lower financing costs also boosted returns,
Coal & Allied raised the dividend to 60 cents a share from 16
cents.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Overall profit after accounting for extraordinary items
jumped 76% to A$52.2 million from A$29.7 million. In the
latest period, the company had an extraordinary loss of A$8
million, related mainly to the closure of an engineering
division; year-earlier results included an A$27.4 million
extraordinary gain.</p>
