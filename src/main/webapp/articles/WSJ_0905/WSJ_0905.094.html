	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- The General Accounting Office criticized the
savings-and-loan bailout agency for advancing $250 million to
two insolvent thrifts under government control without
securing collateral, and said the total of uncollateralized
borrowing by such thrifts "could be substantial."
   The GAO, which scrutinized only three S&Ls, said the total
could be significant because the Resolution Trust Corp. had
advanced $12.7 billion as of March 31 to thrifts taken over
by the government. The RTC, which has taken over about 450
thrifts, was set up under last year's S&L bailout law to sell
off insolvent thrifts.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The GAO, the investigative arm of Congress, said the RTC's
rules require it to hold promissory notes and secure
collateral for the advances but that the RTC appeared to be
ignoring those requirements. The advances are loans made to
the thrifts to meet their cash needs while under government
control.</p>
<p>The GAO said the failure to follow the rules could
increase the cost of the bailout if the RTC can't get its
money back or if it finds itself in a battle with other
creditors over collateral.</p>
<p>The GAO said at one of the three thrifts it visited
earlier this year the RTC couldn't find 12 of the 18
promissory notes for advances made through October 1989. The
GAO found $250 million in advances not backed by collateral
at two of the S&Ls.</p>
<p>The reason for the problems, perhaps, has been the
confusion that has attended some of the bailout's start-up --
and to which bailout officials have admitted. The GAO said
that officials at RTC headquarters maintained that regional
RTC officials were supposed to ensure that sufficient
collateral backed the advances. But the regional officials
told the GAO they didn't even know until recently the total
amount of advances from the RTC.</p>
<p>The criticism came in a report about the RTC's spending.
In a possibly ominous note, the GAO said recent RTC actions
to accept prices lower than the appraised value for
properties suggest the RTC's overall valuations of its
assets, which are based on appraised value, "may be
overstated." If true, that could mean the RTC has further
losses that taxpayers will have to make up.</p>
<p>The GAO said it will criticize appraisals carried out for
the government as being overly optimistic in a report soon to
be issued on the strength of the government insurance fund
for banks. "Because the {RTC} also uses appraisals in valuing
its real estate and other assets," the GAO said, "it needs to
be alert for optimistic assumptions."</p>
<p>The GAO's report noted that the RTC had said it was taking
steps to correct the collateral problems. A spokesman for the
RTC said: "Given that we are in control {of the thrifts}, it
is highly unlikely that collateral would be pledged to some
other obligation."</p>
