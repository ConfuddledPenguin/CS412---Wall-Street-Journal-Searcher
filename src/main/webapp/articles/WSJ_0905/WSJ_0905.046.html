	<p class="article-leader">OAK BROOK, Ill. -- Portec Inc. said a federal appeals
court in Denver reduced a judgment in a lawsuit against it to
$1.2 million from $2.2 million.
   Portec, which makes engineered products for various
industries, including railroads, said the judgment resulted
from a jury trial in 1988, in a suit by the British Post
Office. Portec said the suit claimed that certain of its
manufacturing operations weren't properly licensed.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Portec said that if the British Post Office refuses the
judgment reduction, the case would have to be retried.</p>
