	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- With oil prices surging and foreign stock
markets slumping, U.S. bonds fell and stocks were mixed.
   The October futures contract for crude oil jumped $1.80 a
barrel to close at $29.12. Oil prices already were rising
before U.S. financial markets opened, largely due to a lack
of progress in the United Nations effort to mediate a way out
of the Mideast quagmire.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished just 0.99 point
lower to close at 2613.37, though it had been down 30 points
in early trading. Broader market indexes closed slightly
higher: Standard & Poor's 500-stock index, for example, rose
0.53 to 323.09, and the New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq
composite indexes also eked out small gains.</p>
<p>But activity was light, as it was in all the financial
markets. Big Board volume was even slower than Friday's,
which briefly held the distinction of the year's dullest
session. Yesterday's turnover of 92.9 million shares was the
snooziest since the day after last Christmas.</p>
<p>Long-term U.S. Treasury bonds fell nearly 3/8 point, or
almost $3.75 for each $1,000 of face amount; earlier, they
were down half a point. The dollar ended mixed, with traders
finding little in the news to guide them.</p>
<p>John Candela, managing director of fixed-income investing
at Ladenburg Thalmann, said the bond market's thin trading
made it difficult to read much into the decline. Further
muddying the picture is the large number of potentially
market-moving events that are drawing near: Friday's release
of U.S. employment data; Congress returning to deal with the
ballooning budget deficit; the planned superpower summit in
Finland Sunday; and uncertainties about the direction of the
Mideast crisis.</p>
<p>The lack of resolutions to any of these issues "keeps
things on edge," Mr. Candela said. "People will remain frozen
until we get some direction."</p>
<p>Referring to the stock market, Peter Canelo, chief
strategist at Bear Stearns, said, "The fact that we had this
kind of light volume with many people back from vacation was
probably the most significant development" in the market
yesterday. "It reveals a real paralysis." And if the Mideast
stalemate drags on for months and oil-price moves remain
unpredictable, investors may well remain paralyzed, he said:
"When investors know they don't know, investors tend not to
act."</p>
<p>The currency markets also were quiet, with prices
fluctuating narrowly. Robert White, manager of corporate
foreign-exchange trading at First Interstate Bank in Los
Angeles, said traders were surprised a bit by the dollar's
rise early in the day despite then-slumping stock and bond
prices. He speculated that investors are nervous about
indications that the Soviet Union may be having a tougher
time economically than had previously been thought.</p>
<p>"If people will riot over cigarettes, they'll surely be
upset about bread shortages," he said, referring to news
reports of such shortages now emerging. "That, coupled with
the problems in Iraq, problems in German reunification, labor
unrest and wage negotiations for immigrant workers in
Switzerland -- just a lot of European stories around that
aren't very encouraging -- supports a lessening of bearish
sentiment about the dollar."</p>
<p>In major market action:</p>
<p>Stock prices were mixed in very slow trading. On the Big
Board, decliners led advancers, 814 to 673.</p>
<p>Bond prices fell. The yield on the Treasury's benchmark
30-year bond rose to 9.01%.</p>
<p>The dollar was mixed. In late New York trading, the
currency rose to 1.5815 marks from 1.5755 Friday and fell to
143.50 yen from 143.79.</p>
