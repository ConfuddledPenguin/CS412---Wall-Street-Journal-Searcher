	<p class="article-leader">Adobe Systems Inc. won at least a partial victory in its
running battle with Apple Computer Inc. and Microsoft Inc.
over control of the software that helped launch desktop
publishing.
   Apple and Adobe said yesterday that they had signed a
letter of intent to reach a "new and expanded" technology
licensing agreement. Under terms of the accord, Apple and
Adobe plan to continue to work together to provide new
products based on Adobe's PostScript software and printer
technology developed by Apple. PostScript creates images and
type fonts on computer screens and printers, enabling users
to see exactly what will issue from their printers.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Although the two companies declined to provide details,
the agreement appears to be a reconciliation of sorts. Last
year, Apple, based in Cupertino, Calif., announced that it
would sell its 16.4% equity stake in Adobe, based in Mountain
View, Calif. It also said it would compete with Adobe by
developing a clone of PostScript with Microsoft, the biggest
maker of personal computer software. Apple's action was
viewed as a major blow to Adobe, since Apple was Adobe's
largest shareholder and customer, accounting for 28% of
Adobe's revenue during 1988.</p>
<p>Yesterday's agreement was seen by analysts as a move by
Apple to stay at least neutral in offering desktop publishing
software from both Microsoft and Adobe, letting the market
decide the winner. In March, International Business Machines
Corp. said it would bundle PostScript with all lines of its
computers, but would only offer Microsoft's version with its
PC line.</p>
<p>After the announcement, Adobe shares jumped $3.125 to
close at $28.125 in national over-the-counter trading.
Adobe's stock is still depressed however, trading far below
its 12-month high of $50.75 a share, reached in May.</p>
<p>"When your largest customer suddenly says that they need
you after they have been saying they didn't need you, that's
a pretty good vote of confidence," said Steven L. Ossad, an
analyst for Montgomery Securities in San Francisco.</p>
<p>An Apple spokeswoman said the agreement isn't a change in
plans. "We always said we would work with multivendors," she
said.</p>
<p>Analysts held varying opinions as to just how positive the
agreement was for Adobe. Shearson Lehman Brothers analyst
David S. Nelson, for one, called the impending agreement a
"monumental" development for Adobe. Mr. Nelson said the pact
not only solidifies Adobe's relationship with its largest
client, but affirms Adobe as the pre-eminent vendor of
computer printing software.</p>
<p>Analyst Bruce M. Lupatkin of Hambrecht & Quist in San
Francisco said the relationship solidifies nothing. Apple, he
said, is keeping its options open to work with both Adobe and
Microsoft. "My guess is that Apple is hedging its bets," Mr.
Lupatkin said. "Apple is saying it can support Adobe's
technology, but that it is also supporting Microsoft's
technology. Ultimately, the best technology will win."</p>
<p>"With this announcement, the relationship has gotten
extremely better," said John E. Warnock, Adobe chairman and
chief executive officer, in a teleconference with reporters.
"Apple needs Adobe and Adobe needs Apple."</p>
<p>Mr. Warnock said that there has been considerable
speculation among investors and in the press that Apple and
Adobe were drifting further apart. "I think the real meat of
this announcement is that we aren't" drifting apart, he said.
"This is a public reaffirmation that we plan to continue that
process" of cooperation.</p>
<p>"Continuing to work closely with excellent third-party
vendors such as Adobe has many benefits for Macintosh
customers," said Randy Battat, vice president of product
marketing for Apple.</p>
