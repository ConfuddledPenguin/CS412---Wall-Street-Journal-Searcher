	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- William Bennett, just back from torching
clandestine marijuana fields with the Kentucky National
Guard, is fired up about the "drug war." Still wearing his
drug-czar fatigues -- rumpled chinos and blue tennis shirt
smelling of singed cannabis -- he is preparing to report
progress on the battlefield.
   It was exactly a year ago today that George Bush, in his
first nationally televised speech as president, branded drugs
the country's "gravest domestic threat" and endorsed Mr.
Bennett's get-tough strategy. This morning, the drug czar
will announce that his plan is working. Cocaine prices have
risen, while purity has dropped -- possible indications of
curbed supplies. "We no longer have a situation that is out
of control, that is threatening the republic," Mr. Bennett
says.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Yet the past 12 months also have sharpened a dichotomy in
the drug problem. Middle-class use of drugs generally appears
to be leveling off, perhaps even decreasing. But the
proportion of heavy users of cocaine and its potent
derivative, crack, may actually be increasing. Indisputably,
drug-related crimes have risen, and murderous violence
continues to rip apart many inner cities.</p>
<p>While acknowledging that such urban neighborhoods remain
under siege, Mr. Bennett notes that some police officials
attribute the skein of killings in New York, Washington and
elsewhere to intensified competition in a tightening cocaine
market. "One drug scumball blowing away another one," as he
puts it.</p>
<p>Though other crises -- first the savings-and-loan debacle,
now the Iraqi situation -- have supplanted drugs at the top
of the national list of concerns, Mr. Bennett has been far
from idle. Barnstorming (and potburning) his way from coast
to coast, he has exhorted state legislators to "get with the
program": more cops, more arrests, more prisons and --
despite charges from detractors that he favors punitive
measures too much -- more treatment.</p>
<p>His critics, led by congressional Democrats, complain that
Mr. Bennett's enthusiasm for punitive action fails to address
"root causes" of drug abuse and violence, such as poverty and
poor education. Tens of thousands of people, many destitute,
languish on waiting lists of overburdened public treatment
programs, charges John Gustafson, deputy director of New York
state's Substance Abuse Division.</p>
<p>Other skeptics question the statistical bases for Mr.
Bennett's claims of progress -- namely, government and
private surveys that purport to show a rising rate of
disapproval of drugs among high school seniors, a decreasing
rate of workers testing positive on the job, and a 37% drop
in household drug use since 1985. These numbers reflect
apparent shifts only in the middle class, not among
hard-to-count "hard-core addicts," charges Senate Judiciary
Committee Chairman Joseph Biden (D., Del.). He points to
estimates by his staff that 2.2 million people use cocaine
"frequently" -- nearly three times the government figure Mr.
Bennett prefers.</p>
<p>Some of these criticisms have bite. "The numbers," as one
Bennett aide admits, "are very soft." One federally
administered survey shows a slight decrease in
cocaine-related hospital emergency-room cases in late 1989
and early 1990 after years of sharp increases. But the number
of cocaine-related deaths continued to grow last year,
although at a slower pace.</p>
<p>Mr. Bennett tends to take credit for public intolerance
that began hardening before he ascended to czardom. David
Musto, a Yale University historian of medicine, says that
American attitudes toward narcotics swing from toleration to
rejection in predictable patterns and that the recent
movement toward abstinence began in the early 1980s.</p>
<p>Statistical ambiguities don't trouble Mr. Bennett, whose
world view tends toward good vs. bad, heroes vs. villains. He
prefers to discuss the grudging support he has won from an
increasing number of state officials, Democrats as well as
Republicans.</p>
<p>The states could never construct enough jail cells to
satisfy the drug czar, but they are building more. Many
legislatures also have stiffened forfeiture provisions and
other civil penalties that he pushes as a deterrent to drug
use. Some state prosecutors are using the expanded laws more
aggressively to seize cars and other property for simple
possession of narcotics.</p>
<p>Mississippi Attorney General Mike Moore, a Democrat,
counts himself as a Bennett convert. At first skeptical of
the czar's blustery style, he now credits Mr. Bennett with
serving as an effective advocate for tougher state
enforcement and increased federal funding. Mississippi
received $4.5 million in its federal law-enforcement block
grant for 1990, an increase of $3.1 million over 1989.</p>
<p>"We have drive-by shootings in Jackson," says Mr. Moore,
and "cocaine trafficking up from the Gulf {of Mexico} that we
never had before." But the czar, he adds, couldn't have been
expected to "cure" such problems in a year.</p>
<p>Albert Riederer, the Democratic county prosecutor in
Kansas City, Mo., gives Mr. Bennett "credit for at least
galvanizing support" for federal-local task forces that make
more efficient use of limited manpower.</p>
<p>At the federal level, the notorious turf battles of the
1970s and '80s appear to have diminished somewhat. Prodded by
Mr. Bennett, the Drug Enforcement Administration has granted
broad narcotics authority to 1,000 agents from a fierce
rival, the Customs Service. Serious problems do persist. The
Federal Bureau of Investigation, for example, rarely shares
its considerable intelligence files with sister agencies. But
veteran drug agents say the word has come down from the top
to work together and end the</p>
<p>The bigger budgets that Mr. Bennett has pushed, sometimes
over the objections of powerful White House budget director
Richard Darman, have also helped ease the bureaucratic
tensions. With less interagency competition for money,
officials say, some are more inclined to share both work and
credit. Beginning with testimony before the Senate Judiciary
Committee scheduled for tomorrow, Mr. Bennett will launch a
campaign to defend the Bush administration's request for a
$1.1 billion increase in federal anti-drug funding, pushing
the total to $10.6 billion for fiscal year 1991, which starts
Oct. 1.</p>
<p>Mr. Bennett's pugnacious partisanship hasn't diminished.
He used a meeting with New York state drug officials to
attack Gov. Mario Cuomo's drug-fighting record and dare him
to run for president. "Nobody is afraid of this guy," the
czar said of Mr. Cuomo. "He has got a record to run on, and
the record on drugs, I have to tell you, is not what it
should be." The outburst led New York Democratic Sen. Daniel
Moynihan to deride the drug czar's "tough-guy talk" on the
Senate floor.</p>
<p>The drug czar's confrontational attitude has also spilled
over into legislative fights. He recently lambasted House
Democrats when they played into his hands by reversing course
and cutting the White House request for treatment money; Mr.
Bennett labeled them hypocrites for having accused him in the
past of ignoring the plight of the addicted, and got the
treatment money reinstated.</p>
<p>Yet Mr. Bennett has also demonstrated improved political
finesse by cultivating a key legislative ally, none other
than his sometime critic, Sen. Biden. Despite occasional
verbal dust-ups, Mr. Bennett has been careful to stress that
their only significant difference is that the Judiciary
Committee chairman wants to spend even more money than the
Bush administration.</p>
<p>Mr. Bennett appreciatively recounts a telephone
conversation -- confirmed by a Biden aide -- in which the
senator lauded the restoration of the treatment money in the
House and promised to help if similar problems arise in the
Senate. For his part, Mr. Bennett, who has been stumping for
GOP candidates, has refused to campaign for Mr. Biden's
Republican opponent this fall.</p>
<p>Bennett watchers suggest that the drug czar may be nearing
the point, possibly within the next year, at which he
declares that he has made his mark and departs his office.
Many believe the drug czar would love to hold high office --
perhaps even the presidency. But even some of his most ardent
supporters say such ambitions aren't feasible because Mr.
Bennett, who rents a house in Maryland, lacks a geographic
base or political organization. More attainable goals may be
a lucrative book contract and some fat speaking fees.</p>
<p>Famous for his restlessness, Mr. Bennett by his own
admission doesn't like to get involved in the operational
details of government. He believes he has provided a broad
plan for fighting drugs. The task now, he says, is to "stay
at it."</p>
