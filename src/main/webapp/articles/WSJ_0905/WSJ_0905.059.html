	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- Despite the sharp runup in oil prices,
Democratic negotiators for this week's budget talks are still
considering proposing a tax on energy consumption.
   Congressional aides say higher oil prices have made an
energy tax a somewhat less likely component of a
deficit-reduction package than it was prior to the Iraqi
standoff. But the tax-increase idea is still very much alive,
they add, and is under active discussion in at least two
forms.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The first plan would impose a tax on energy only when the
price of oil dropped below some threshold amount, certainly
below the nearly $30-a-barrel level at which it stands today.
The rate of the tax would either be a set amount or would
vary with the price of oil -- the lower the price, the higher
the tax.</p>
<p>The second plan would impose only a tiny tax on energy
initially, but would increase over time. This start-small,
grow-big proposal would have the advantage of bringing in
increasing amounts of revenue in the coming years, an outcome
that fits well with the negotiators' hopes of agreeing to a
relatively compact tax increase for the first year that grows
substantially over five years.</p>
<p>The Democrats intend to devise their own deficit-reduction
package in private discussions before the full budget summit
reconvenes on Friday and over the weekend at Andrews Air
Force Base near here. Aides say the Bush administration has
made clear that it believes that it is the Democrats' turn to
make a proposal; the Republicans tentatively agreed to one
just as the talks closed down early last month.</p>
<p>The energy tax is being discussed by Democrats as
potentially one of the fundamental parts of a tax-increase
package that could be as large as $25 billion in the first
year, but probably would be smaller, perhaps $18 billion.</p>
<p>Other likely components, aides say, would be an increase
in the top personal income tax rate to at least 33% from the
current 28%, which Democratic budget-writers have been
pushing for some time, along with an increase in "sin" taxes
on alcoholic beverages and tobacco, a tax on various luxury
items and the adoption of a variety of fees that were
proposed by President Bush in his own tax-increase proposals
issued early this year as part of his fiscal 1991 budget
plan.</p>
<p>At least initially, the Democrats aren't likely to propose
a cut in the tax on capital gains, which is one of the
president's most coveted tax proposals.</p>
<p>The tax-increase package tentatively adopted by Republican
negotiators last month would sharply increase taxes on
alcoholic beverages, limit the deductibility of tax payments
to state and local governments and cut the capital gains tax.</p>
<p>Democrats are continuing to discuss the energy tax under
the banner of energy conservation. Increasing the cost of
fuels is one way to discourage their use.</p>
<p>But the variable form of the tax could turn controversial
if it became yet another gimmick to mask the deficit problem.
It could, for instance, allow budget negotiators to claim
substantial reductions in the deficit in future years that
might not really occur.</p>
<p>Bush administration officials, who have also discussed a
variable energy tax, warn that it would be difficult to
accurately forecast the revenues that would be generated by a
levy that rose and fell with the price of oil because oil
prices are so tough to predict. But by simply assuming that
the U.S. prevailed against Iraq and oil prices fell sharply,
budget negotiators could project a huge windfall from such a
tax in the future.</p>
