	<p class="article-leader">Yesterday was one of those increasingly frequent occasions
when South Koreans deserved to feel proud. North Korea's
Premier Yon Hyong Muk arrived in the southern capital of
Seoul to meet with South Korea's Premier Kang Young Hoon and
President Roh Tae Woo. There was a brief delay to sort out a
multicar fender-bender in the visitor's motorcade. But then a
dialogue began aimed at reunification of the Korean
peninsula, 40 years after the communist North began the
Korean War with a surprise attack on Seoul. It was a war in
which more than five million Americans served.
   For South Korea, these talks are part of the payoff for
standing up to North Korea's threats and building a
democratic capitalist system that has helped lead Asia's
postwar boom. From the destitute rural economy of the 1950s,
the South has built a world-class trading nation with a per
capita income at least four times that of the misanthropic
North. In 1988, Seoul successfully hosted the summer Olympics
while North Korea's Great Leader Kim Il Sung sulked in
isolated Pyongyang.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>By now, even North Korea's staunchest comrades -- China
and the Soviet Union -- have acknowledged that Kim Il Sung's
Stalin-inspired utopia is going nowhere. The future lies with
the South. China, despite its revived revolutionary rantings
since Tiananmen, has been courting Seoul's business know-how
and investment capital for several years now. In June,
President Gorbachev met with Roh Tae Woo in San Francisco and
announced that Moscow and Seoul would establish diplomatic
ties.</p>
<p>There is hope in the West that these talks are part of a
sweep toward peaceful reunification that might roughly follow
the script of Germany this past year. The so-called
demilitarized zone that cuts the two Koreas along the 38th
parallel is for Asia at least as potent a symbol of the Cold
War as was the Berlin Wall for Europe. But experience says
that when North Korea knocks at the gates, it's still smart
to beware.</p>
<p>The North still talks -- and lives -- in terms of
communist revolution. One of the top items on Pyongyang's
agenda is withdrawal from the South of American troops,
currently 38,000-strong, which have helped shore up South
Korea's defense since the 1953 truce. Rational calculation
says that North Korea's leaders would have to be crazy to
start a war now against the South. It is highly doubtful that
either China or the Soviet Union would help the North, and
without their resupplies Pyongyang would be doomed.
Nonetheless, the cost to South Korea and its allies could be
miserably high. And the North's Kim Il Sung during his 42
years of dictatorship has piled up all the credentials of
megalomania. These range from his personality cult and
efforts to install a communist dynasty, to such overseas
projects as bombing a South Korean official delegation in
Rangoon in 1983, and blowing up a South Korean commercial jet
over the Andaman Sea in 1987, killing all 115 people aboard.</p>
<p>It is alarmingly plausible that with the communist world
breaking up around him, and his own revolution marching down
a dead end, Kim Il Sung might yet try a suicidal last stand.
Certainly there is nothing in his history to suggest that he
will graciously defer to the democrats of Seoul.</p>
<p>Reunification strictly on South Korea's terms would
satisfy the South's 42 million people and bring vast relief
to the captive 20 million of the North. But there is no
reason for Seoul to rush into any compromise whatsoever with
Pyongyang. Patience has paid off well for Seoul so far.</p>
<p>The only gifts worth offering to Pyongyang's Premier Yon
this week might be a Korean translation of Adam Smith, and
perhaps about 20 million copies of the June 30, 1987, speech
in which Roh Tae Woo made his winning proposal for South
Korea's transition to democracy.</p>
