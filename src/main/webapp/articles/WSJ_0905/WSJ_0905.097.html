	<p class="article-leader">CHICAGO -- Martin J. Riley, one of 15 yen futures traders
awaiting trial in federal court here on fraud charges,
pleaded no contest to one count of mail and wire fraud and
two counts of violating the Commodity Exchange Act.
   Separately, opening arguments in the trial of the 14 other
defendants were scheduled for next Tuesday.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Mr. Riley's plea before U.S. District Court Judge William
Hart means that while he isn't contesting the government
charges against him in the yen case, his plea can't be used
as an admission of guilt in subsequent civil or
administrative proceedings against him.</p>
<p>Neither Mr. Riley nor his attorney, William Murphy, could
be reached for comment on the plea.</p>
<p>Many futures traders who have pleaded guilty to fraud
charges stemming from the government's undercover
investigation of the futures pits have been fined by the
futures exchanges for admitting to violations of exchange
trading rules.</p>
