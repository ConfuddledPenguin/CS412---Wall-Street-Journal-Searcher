	<p class="article-leader">JACKSON, Mich. -- CMS Energy Corp. said its Consumers
Power Co. utility unit will refund $29.5 million to its gas
customers from 1987 because of refunds received from natural
gas pipeline suppliers and will recover $11.7 million from
gas customers because of a 1988 underrecovery of gas costs.
   The utility's typical residential gas customer who has
received service since 1987 will receive a net credit of
approximately $11.60 as a result of the adjustments, CMS
said.</p>
