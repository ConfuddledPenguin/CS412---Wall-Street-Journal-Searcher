	<p class="article-leader">MOSCOW -- Ever since Stalin ordered it built in 1939, the
U.S.S.R. Exhibition of Economic Achievements has been a
showcase for the supposed triumphs of socialism. But now,
answering the call of capitalism, it's a sort of dotty
Disneyland.
   Its 58 pavilions used to run officially sponsored exhibits
on everything from atomic power to zoology. But government
funding has been cut off, and the 11 million tourists a year
no longer come just to admire the magic of Soviet animal
husbandry or to peer at video recorders, designer shoes and
other goods that aren't for sale in the nation's depleted
stores.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"When there's nothing in the stores, it bothers people to
show things at the exhibition," says Aidar Valiakhmetov. He's
the exhibition's advertising director, a job once known as
head of propaganda.</p>
<p>Previously, exhibitors weren't allowed to sell their
wares. But today's visitors to the complex -- which is spread
over a 500-acre park in north Moscow -- can, and do, spend
much of their time standing in line for such trinkets as
magnetized ear clips that are said to relieve headaches.</p>
<p>The consumer-goods pavilion -- fallen prey to the past,
perhaps -- is closed for repairs. But at the agriculture
pavilion, with its huge, stained-glass views of happy,
toiling peasants, Galina Nazarova offers amateur gardeners a
$4-a-bottle miracle liquid that supposedly kills all kinds of
bugs and beetles without harming the environment.</p>
<p>Next door at the wheat pavilion, the bushels of grain and
loaves of bread on display go unnoticed. In the back room,
however, an exhibit of glass sculptures by a retired
light-bulb maker is well attended, even though the tickets
cost $1.60, six times what visitors pay to get into the
complex itself.</p>
<p>Capitalism is also tooling along in the machinery
pavilion, which now rents space to anyone who can pay. Around
its dusty satellite models and spacesuits are a video salon,
which shows pirate copies of foreign movies, and a "UFO
shelter," which welcomes visitors who want to chat about
their encounters with extraterrestrials.</p>
<p>The pavilion's deputy director, 36-year-old engineer
Sergei Kurbatov, is a firm believer in the profit motive. He
even wants to break up the pavilion into a series of
minicompanies, so that unsuccessful ones will fail and not be
carried along by the others. "We are convinced that a person
who works hard should live much better, and a person who
works less should live considerably worse."</p>
