	<p class="article-leader">Hewlett-Packard Co., of Palo Alto, Calif., said it reduced
U.S. list prices on its top-of-the-line HP Vectra personal
computers by as much as 24%, a move analysts said may be
designed to combat slow sales.
   The reductions, which became effective Saturday, range
from $300 to $4,600. The price of the HP Vectra 486 Model
670, for example, was lowered to $14,899 from $19,499. Also
reduced up to 36% were Hewlett-Packard's 330-megabyte and
670-megabyte, enhanced small-device interface, or ESDI, disk
drives.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Pradeep Jotwani, the company's North American PC marketing
manager, said the price declines were driven by lower
manufacturing costs for ESDI hard-disk drives and by lower
costs for components.</p>
<p>Timothy R. McCollum, an analyst for Dean Witter Reynolds
Inc. in New York, said the main factor behind the price
decreases was that Hewlett-Packard had trouble selling the HP
Vectra line since the top models were introduced in January
1989.</p>
