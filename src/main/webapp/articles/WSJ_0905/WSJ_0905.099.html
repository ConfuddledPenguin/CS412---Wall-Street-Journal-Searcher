	<p class="article-leader">TORONTO -- Financially troubled BCE Development Corp. said
its two main financial backers may not continue to let the
company use their funds to meet its debt obligations.
   The company said in a statement that this could lead to a
restructuring of its 2.4 billion Canadian dollars ($2.07
billion) of debt.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>BCE Inc., which holds 67% of BCE Development, and Carena
Developments Ltd., a real-estate developer controlled by
Toronto financiers Peter and Edward Bronfman, joined forces
late last year to provide a C$500 million credit facility to
the real-estate company.</p>
<p>The funding was pumped into Brookfield Development Corp.,
BCE Development's chief operating subsidiary, to allow work
to continue on construction projects. However, some of the
money has been used by BCE Development to meet debenture
payments and other debt obligations. By the end of the first
quarter, C$358 million of the credit had been used up.</p>
<p>"They {BCE and Carena} have the right to say `We don't
want you using {the money} for other things like debenture
payments,'" said BCE Development's president and chief
executive officer, Gordon Arnell.</p>
<p>The company said Brookfield is its only source of funds
for meeting its debt obligations. Mr. Arnell said the
company's next debenture payment comes up in October and the
board will meet then to decide what to do.</p>
<p>The company said that if Brookfield's support is
withdrawn, "the company will present to debenture and other
corporate debt holders a plan to restructure their
obligations." Mr. Arnell said he doesn't think the company is
facing bankruptcy. He said the company would hope to develop
a debt restructuring plan that its creditors would agree to
voluntarily.</p>
<p>The company also said in the statement that, given "the
further deterioration in the real-estate markets since the
beginning of the year, a further asset provision may be
required." BCE Development took a C$550 million write-down on
its real-estate assets in the fourth quarter of 1989.</p>
<p>"It's not to say these things are going to happen," Mr.
Arnell said of the company's gloomy statement. "We want to
put people on notice that these things are possible."</p>
<p>The company said it expects its previously reported rights
offering of Brookfield shares to go ahead as planned. Under
the proposal, Carena and BCE would convert up to the full
C$500 million of their credit facility into equity. The two
companies are also considering a proposal to convert
capitalized interest that has accrued under the credit
facility, the company said. This would result in about C$600
million of equity being subscribed for by Carena and BCE
under the offering.</p>
<p>BCE Development also reported yesterday a first-quarter
loss of C$38.1 million, or 26 Canadian cents a share. It said
that, until it completes the rights offering, it will
continue to operate at a loss.</p>
<p>On the Toronto Stock Exchange yesterday, BCE Development
closed unchanged at 24 Canadian cents.</p>
