	<p class="article-leader">Before they make another sequel to their airport thriller,
the producers of "Die Hard 2" might, well, try harder to
learn a bit more about how aviation actually works.
   In case you're one of the roughly 15 million who saw the
summer's big hit, rest assured that practically everything
shown in that movie about flying (except for the long ticket
lines and late flights) is wrong. Even in bad weather,
airliners would divert to nearby airports if they were low on
fuel, despite the movie's claim to the contrary. Jet fuel
can't be dumped just by untwisting a gas cap. And Ma Bell
still hasn't completely figured out a way to let people call
up an air traveler from the ground.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Naturally, nobody expects perfection from Hollywood --
especially the people in Hollywood. "This is moviemaking,"
protests a 20th Century Fox spokesman. But unless you're some
avionics wizard, it's easy to walk out of this flick
wondering just where Hollywood did and didn't trip up. And
certainly aviation experts weren't happy with the results.
Officials at Washington Dulles Airport -- the luckless
setting for the movie -- refused to cooperate with the film
makers. Federal Aviation Administration officials won't even
discuss it. "We don't want to give it any credence," a
spokeswoman politely explains.</p>
<p>The movie, starring Bruce Willis, is about a group of
Gadhafi-type terrorists overtaking the Dulles control tower,
forcing a large group of planes to circle the airport
helplessly as their fuel gauges dip toward "E." It's a
scenario that would send any nervous flier into a tailspin:
What would happen if somehow, some way, the air traffic
control system fell into the wrong hands while people were
still 40,000 feet aloft? Would they all be doomed?</p>
<p>Maybe, but not the way the makers of "Die Hard 2" seem to
think. In the movie, the jetliners become virtual hostages in
the sky because communications to the Dulles tower are cut
off. But in real life, pilots would have plenty of other
radio frequencies to use; they could contact other airports,
other airplanes and airline officials on the ground. The FAA
even has an emergency band for pilots to tune into in a
crisis.</p>
<p>As a demonstration of their power, the cinematic
terrorists reset an altitude reading transmitted from the
tower to approaching planes. This makes the pilot of one jet
think he's higher up than he actually is during an instrument
landing over the blackened airfield. He slams into the ground
and the jet explodes in a screen-filling fireball.</p>
<p>First question: How can a plane, whose pilot frantically
claims he is flying only on gas fumes, still have enough fuel
to set off such a huge explosion? And don't pilots have
instruments that determine the aircraft's altitude
independent of control towers? "Of course, we do," says a
reassuring Robert Costello, chief pilot for America West
Airlines.</p>
<p>"Die Hard 2's" dazzling finale is filled with such
distortions of airborne reality. Mr. Willis, playing a cop,
has just jumped onto the wing of a 747 carrying the fleeing
terrorists to freedom. While duking it out with two bad guys
on the wing, he reaches over to a gas cap, conveniently
marked "Fuel Dump," and releases a stream of jet fuel into
the air. Then, after being knocked off the wing, he lights up
the stream of fuel and blows up the plane.</p>
<p>Wow, what an ending] But how would anybody manage to stay
on a wing of a plane zooming along at a takeoff speed of
about 180 mph, much less survive falling off? The fuel dump
valve, which pilots use to unload fuel before emergency
landings, is under the fundamental control of the pilot
inside the cockpit. And travelers will be happy to know that
Boeing engineers realized (long before "Die Hard 2") that
someone might accidentally light up a fuel stream or that
lightning might strike fuel being dumped from a plane. So
they installed a blocking screen that prevents fire from
racing upstream into jet tanks.</p>
<p>Boeing people also say that to the best of their
knowledge, jet fuel wouldn't race up a stream of fire as
quickly and spectacularly as it does in "Die Hard 2." That's
because airlines use kerosene, which isn't quite so flammable
as gasoline.</p>
<p>And by the way, despite referring to the name dozens of
times, the film wasn't even shot at Dulles. (The Pacific Bell
pay phone Mr. Willis uses is a dead giveaway.) The 20th
Century Fox spokesman explains there wasn't enough snow at
Dulles when the film makers needed it, and using fake snow
might have damaged the jets and jeopardized air safety. So
"Die Hard 2" crews had to run around to nine locations to
film enough snowy scenes. Quite a snow job, but so is the
spokesman's explanation, which doesn't explain at all why the
interior scenes weren't shot at Dulles.</p>
<p>Still, for all its flaws, "Die Hard 2" does stumble upon
some real, little-known safety problems. At one point, a
terrorist gets on the tower radio and impersonates a
controller. Phony as the scene looked, a few real-life
pranksters have actually figured out tower frequencies and
posed as controllers. So far, pilots haven't been fooled
because the pranksters didn't use the right lingo. But it
wouldn't take a genius to learn it.</p>
<p>"Die Hard 2's" terrorists also manage to slip in the
airport's baggage-sorting area by simply walking through a
door. Given all the concern about airport security, one would
hope it wouldn't be that easy. But some airports have
hundreds of doors, and a lot of airport and airline employees
know the codes to get through them. Says Steve Gardella, an
airline security consultant in San Diego: "You don't want to
know how easy it can be to sneak around in some airports."
Much easier some days than catching an on-time flight.</p>
