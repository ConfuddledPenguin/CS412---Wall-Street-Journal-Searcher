	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- The Bush administration asked Congress to
forgive Egyptian military debts to reward the nation for
opposing Iraq's invasion of Kuwait. It also signaled it
anticipates having a long-term presence in the Persian Gulf
even after the current crisis ends.
   Meanwhile, the U.S. Navy for the first time took control
of an Iraqi-flagged vessel attempting to carry goods to Iraq
in violation of a United Nations trade embargo against Iraq.
U.S. officials said American sailors are taking the ship,
apparently carrying tea, to a neutral port. Separately,
almost 300 Western women and children, including 25
Americans, arrived in Amman, Jordan, yesterday from Baghdad
on three Iraqi Airways planes, according to the Associated
Press. And 175 Western nationals were expected to leave Amman
early today aboard a Virgin Atlantic jumbo jet.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The White House said it is asking lawmakers to write off
almost $7 billion in bills Egypt ran up in the years after
Cairo's 1979 Camp David peace treaties with Israel.
Economically strapped Egypt has fallen chronically behind in
repaying the debt, and its ability to make payments has been
hurt further by the loss of income from the trade embargo
against Iraq.</p>
<p>But although Congress is generally grateful for Egypt's
opposition to Iraq's invasion and its decision to send troops
to serve in Saudi Arabia, it isn't clear that lawmakers will
agree to forgive the debt. Lawmakers immediately expressed
reservations about setting a precedent in which other nations
will seek similar debt forgiveness -- particularly Israel,
whose officials immediately declared that they want their own
$4.5 billion in debts to the U.S. written off if Egypt's
debts are forgiven.</p>
<p>"I don't think it makes a hell of a lot of sense to
consider the Egyptian situation in a vacuum," said Rep. David
Obey (D., Wis.), chairman of the House subcommittee that
handles foreign aid. "I want to know what the next shoe is
going to be, and the next one."</p>
<p>The administration tried to head off criticism that it
hasn't adequately explained why the U.S. should be willing to
endure a long-term military confrontation with Iraq.
Secretary of State James Baker told the House Foreign Affairs
Committee that the crisis involves more than stopping Saddam
Hussein and protecting oil reserves. He said that it also
would help determine "how the post-Cold War world will work."</p>
<p>Calling the Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait "one of the defining
moments of a new era," Mr. Baker said international,
collective action was necessary because "new hostilities and
threats could erupt as misguided leaders are tempted to
assert regional dominance before the ground rules of a new
order can be accepted." He indicated that the U.S. could have
a continuing presence in the region as part of an
international security force even after the crisis is
resolved. Mr. Baker also said the U.S. military operation
would cost about $6 billion during the remainder of 1990.</p>
<p>Mr. Baker even couched the protection of Mideast oil
fields in broader terms. He told the panel, which generally
supported the administration, that "a dictator" who
controlled much of the world's oil "could strangle the global
economic order, determining by fiat whether we all enter a
recession, or even the darkness of a depression."</p>
<p>Mr. Baker's congressional testimony seemed crafted to
address concerns lawmakers have expressed in recent days
that, after rushing thousands of troops to Saudi Arabia to
protect that kingdom's oil fields from Iraqi advances, the
administration hasn't adequately explained the U.S.'s broader
stake in the region. By casting it in such broad terms, the
administration is trying to make the case that the crisis has
global implications rather than simply short-term
implications on such narrow issues as the price of gasoline
or the fate of the ousted emir of Kuwait.</p>
<p>In addition, Mr. Baker was preparing the public for the
likelihood that some residual U.S. military force might
remain in the Gulf region indefinitely, even after the
current crisis passes, as part of a regional "security
structure." A senior State Department official said the
security structure idea hasn't been fleshed out. But he said
it might involve the Soviets and seek to ensure, among other
things, that Iraq can't become a nuclear power or build more
chemical weapons even if Baghdad's weapons plants survive the
crisis over Kuwait. He said similar peacekeeping forces might
emerge in other regions besides the Middle East as one aspect
of the post-Cold War world order the U.S. hopes to construct
after the Gulf crisis.</p>
<p>As Mr. Baker spoke, the U.S. Navy was taking its most
direct action yet to enforce the U.N.-ordered embargo on
trade with Iraq. U.S. sailors in the Gulf of Oman boarded a
small Iraqi-flagged freighter headed from Sri Lanka to Iraq,
after the captain refused to change course or stop. Pentagon
spokesman Pete Williams said the crew of the Zanoobia didn't
offer any resistance when the boarding party took over the
bridge. Mr. Williams didn't indicate where the vessel is now
headed, though other U.S. military officials said it is
scheduled to dock in Oman.</p>
<p>According to Mr. Williams, some 20 other vessels have been
boarded by U.S. sailors since the international embargo
against Iraq was put into place, but those ships either were
allowed to proceed on their original course or were diverted
somewhere else under the control of their own crew. The
Pentagon said this was the first time members of a boarding
party actually took control of a vessel and began sailing to
a neutral port themselves.</p>
<p>The latest incident comes on the heels of U.S. action last
week against another Sri Lankan vessel, which was intercepted
sailing toward Iraq. Pentagon officials said the Sri Lankan
government promised at the time to halt all further shipments
to Iraqi ports.</p>
<p>The action on the high seas dovetailed with political and
diplomatic moves by the administration to strengthen the
trade sanctions. The administration is seeking debt relief
for Egypt in large part to demonstrate that nations that are
hurt by honoring the sanctions against Iraq will be rewarded.</p>
<p>The Gulf crisis is hurting Cairo by disrupting the flow of
hard currency from Egyptians employed in Iraq and Kuwait who
are fleeing home by the thousands because of the political
tensions between Egypt and Iraq. In addition, Egypt is losing
revenue from fees normally paid by ships that travel through
the Suez Canal while carrying goods to Iraq.</p>
<p>Egypt's civilian and military debt to the U.S. totals more
than $12 billion. Though Egypt has been making payments on
its debt, the payments have been behind schedule, and it is
$1.2 billion to $1.5 billion in arrears. The White House
action, if approved by Congress, would affect only the
roughly $7 billion portion in the debt that arises from
military sales.</p>
<p>The move would have an immediate impact on the U.S. budget
deficit. Egypt was scheduled to make $750 million in
repayments this year, the White House said, and that money
won't be coming into Treasury coffers if debt forgiveness is
approved.</p>
<p>But the broader impact could come if other nations seek to
follow suit. White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater declared
that the move doesn't set a precedent for other nations, but
Israeli Finance Minister Yitzhak Modai declared in a radio
interview this week that "When I visit Washington next month
I will ask for equal treatment."</p>
<p>Turkey, another nation that has been a high-profile
supporter of the economic campaign against Iraq, owes the
U.S. $1.25 billion on military loans, congressional officials
said. And some influential lawmakers already had been pushing
for forgiving some of Poland's non-military debts.</p>
<p>The administration also began a campaign that a senior
official suggested is designed to gather more than $25
billion from allies to help Mideast states hurt by the crisis
and to help fund the U.S.-led military effort in the Gulf.</p>
<p>Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady arrived in Paris for the
first leg of a tour to discuss "cooperation" and
"burden-sharing" among Western and Asian nations. Mr. Brady
refused to comment on the amounts of money the U.S. is
seeking, but the senior official said that the administration
does have specific amounts of aid in mind that nations in
Europe and Asia should contribute.</p>
<p>Aid to Mideast nations is being divided into two distinct
pools, a short-term emergency fund that would tide them over
until the end of 1990, and a medium-term effort to address
their needs through 1991, officials said. More than $10
billion could be needed through 1991 to aid Turkey, Egypt and
Jordan, the nations hit hardest.</p>
<p>In his explanation of the confrontation with Iraq, Mr.
Baker insisted that it is particularly important to stop
intimidation and force in the Middle East because of its
virulent regional hatreds, stockpile of weapons of mass
destruction and huge energy reserves.</p>
<p>He said toppling Saddam Hussein isn't one of the
administration's objectives. He repeatedly said the way to
contain the Iraqi leader and the threat of weapons
proliferation he represented would be by building what he
called a "security structure" in the region. Although Mr.
Baker didn't provide details, he said that the U.S. would
have "some continuing presence" in such an international
security arrangement, perhaps with U.S. naval forces.</p>
<p>Mr. Baker, responding to a question about why gasoline
prices have risen so swiftly, expressed irritation at oil
companies. "I fail to see how oil that's purchased at $16 a
barrel and refined into gasoline has to be jacked up within
two days of an action like this," he said. "And then when the
price goes back down, the price of gasoline is not reduced.
So that's a very good question. I think it ought to be
addressed to the people who raised the prices."</p>
