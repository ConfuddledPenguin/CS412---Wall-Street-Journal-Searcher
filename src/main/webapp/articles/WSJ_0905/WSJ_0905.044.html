	<p class="article-leader">Over-the-counter stocks held their ground in quiet trading
as doubts about the Middle East and the economy kept many
investors idle.
   The Nasdaq Composite Index edged up 0.46 to 381.67, a 0.1%
gain. Volume remained unusually light as only 78.1 million
shares traded, down from 79.9 million Friday. Declining
shares overtook advancers, 1,009 to 789; the number of stocks
falling to new lows swamped those reaching new highs, 104 to
seven.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>OTC trading is likely to remain light during the four-day
workweek as investors await Friday's unemployment data for
August, traders said. "I don't expect anything dramatic in a
short week," said Len Hefter, manager of OTC trading at
Jefferies & Co. in Dallas. Investors also are waiting to see
if interest rates ease in the wake of the unemployment
report, Mr. Hefter added.</p>
<p>The crisis in the Middle East continues to keep many
investors wary of OTC stocks, said Robert King, director of
OTC trading at Robinson Humphrey Co., Atlanta. "I think
people are going to have to come to a decision as to what
direction the Middle East {crisis} is headed towardwhether it
will be a quick solution or a long, protracted stalemate,"
said Mr. King. "That's the key everyone is watching."</p>
<p>Fears of a recession also may lead to "tough sledding in
the next couple of months," Mr. King said. But the stock
market could recover by spring if evidence comes through that
the country already has slid into a recession, he added.</p>
<p>Institutions dominated business at Robinson Humphrey as
large investors tested stocks across the board, according to
Mr. King. The market's largest stocks curried favor; the
Nasdaq 100 Index of large stocks added 2.26 to 389.49 and
posted the strongest gain among the Nasdaq indexes.</p>
<p>Adobe Systems surged 3 1/8 to 28 1/8 on 1.2 million
shares. Investors embraced the Mountain View, Calif.,
software maker's announcement that it is expanding a
licensing agreement with its biggest customer, Apple
Computer. Countering reports that the two companies have
drifted apart, Adobe and Apple said they will work together
to provide new products based on Adobe's PostScript software
and printer technology developed by Apple. Apple was
unchanged at 37.</p>
<p>Elsewhere in the technology sector, Conner Peripherals
added 1 to 21 5/8; Sun Microsystems gained 1/4 to 29;
Microsoft rose 3/4 to 62 1/4; and Novell advanced 3/4 to 27
1/4. However, Oracle Systems eased 1/2 to 11 1/8.</p>
<p>Intel, the day's most active stock, added 1/8 to 33 1/2
after trading as low as 32 1/2. This newspaper reported that
exchange-listed Advanced Micro Devices is poised to unveil a
clone of Intel's lucrative 80386 microprocessor. Intel's
stock, trading near its 52-week low, had already taken a
beating in mid-August after a Bear Stearns & Co. analyst
expressed concern about possible clones of the chip.</p>
<p>Elsewhere in the OTC market, Nike rebounded 3 1/8 to 68
5/8; MCI Communications was unchanged at 34; and St. Jude
Medical added 3/4 to 30.</p>
<p>Tokos Medical jumped 1 5/8 to 11 5/8, nearly reaching its
$12-a-share initial offering price of last March. The Santa
Ana, Calif., provider of home-health-care services completed
an acquisition of Atlantabased Physiologic Diagnostic Service
for 2.7 million shares of Tokos stock. The news prompted
Donaldson Lufkin & Jenrette analyst John Hindelong to repeat
his "buy" opinion on Tokos, according to Dow Jones
Professional Investor Report.</p>
<p>Mr. Hindelong told DJPIR that if Physiologic Diagnostic
receives Food and Drug Administration approval of a uterine
monitor for home use in high-risk pregnancies, sales of the
device could contribute substantially to Tokos' sales and
earnings beginning in 1991. An FDA advisory panel recommended
approval of the device earlier this year.</p>
<p>Continental Gold surged 2 3/8 to 16 3/4 bid after Placer
Dome Inc. said it plans to proceed with an offer to purchase
the Canadian company. The previously proposed offer consists
of $20 (Canadian) in cash or one Placer Dome share for each
of Continental Gold's shares.</p>
<p>Amgen advanced 1/4 to 45 1/2 after trading as low as 44
earlier in the day. The Thousand Oaks, Calif., biotechnology
concern said it bought $15 million of preferred stock of
Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc., a closely held biotechnology
company in Tarrytown, N.Y. The two companies also signed an
agreement worth at least $11 million to Amgen to develop
agents used in treating nerve disorders.</p>
<p>Healthco International rebounded in the afternoon to close
at 17 7/8, down 3/8 after falling as low as 17 1/2. The
Boston provider of home-health-care services said it agreed
to an acquisition by an affiliate of Hicks, Muse & Co., a
Dallas investment firm, for $19.25 a share in cash. The news
came just two days before Healthco's annual shareholder
meeting and as Gemini Partners, which owns a 9.6% stake in
the company, is trying to replace the Healthco board in a
proxy fight.</p>
<p>Healthco traded as high as 21 3/4 earlier this year amid
buy-out speculation fueled by the Gemini Partners stake and a
7.2% position owned by a group including Texas brothers
Thomas, Perry and Lee Bass. As recently as Friday,
arbitragers were speculating that the company could fetch a
price in the lows 20s, according to DJPIR.</p>
<p>Yesterday, Gemini Partners principal Emanuel Pearlman told
DJPIR the Hicks Muse offer is "ridiculously low." Mr.
Pearlman vowed to continue the proxy fight.</p>
<p>FNB Rochester fell 3/4 to 8 after the Rochester, N.Y.,
bank holding company halted buy-out talks with investors
Cukurova Group of Istanbul, Turkey.</p>
<p>M. Kamenstein tumbled 5/8 to 2 7/8, although Monday the
White Plains, N.Y., maker of household products reported
second-quarter net income rose to 10 cents a share from
restated net income of one cent a share a year earlier.</p>
