	<p class="article-leader">PARIS -- Despite worries about creating a giant, France
approved the request of the Carat Holding S.A. and Eurocom
S.A. advertising groups to merge their ad-buying operations.
   But because it fears that the new group could have
excessive influence on French media, especially radio and
television, France's Finance Ministry ruled that the two can
cooperate only on campaigns including ads placed outside
France. Theoretically, for clients placing ads solely in
France, Carat and Eurocom will continue competing with each
other.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The decision is a compromise, aimed at helping the French
companies develop abroad. But some competitors complain that
the new group still will excessively dominate the French
ad-buying market, in addition to becoming an increasingly
powerful force across Europe.</p>
<p>By Eurocom's calculation, the new group will become the
third largest in Europe, behind a consortium called Media
Partnership and behind another linkup including the
Interpublic group and Publicis-FCB Communication. Within
France, Carat, a subsidiary of Britain's Aegis Group PLC,
already is the largest single media-buyer. Eurocom is second.</p>
<p>Media buyers act as middle men, buying large volumes of ad
time and space in publications and on broadcast shows, and
selling it to advertisers. In a system pioneered by Carat,
the big-volume media buyers get deep discounts, which makes
it hard for smaller-scale buyers of ad space to compete.</p>
