	<p class="article-leader">States such as New York and New Jersey, whose politicians
are currently playing Russian roulette with their economies,
might consider what it would be like to have the AP run a
headline like this about them: "Poll Finds Many Would
Consider Leaving Massachusetts." Just out in Massachusetts,
the poll found an incredible 47% saying they'd consider
getting out if things got worse. One-third of those polled
say they're cutting back on groceries. Meanwhile, with
Washington budget summiteers reconvening soon, an entire
nation waits to see if it'll be trapped by a tax increase.</p>
