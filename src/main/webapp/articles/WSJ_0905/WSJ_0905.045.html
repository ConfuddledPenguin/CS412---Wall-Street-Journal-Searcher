	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. is losing its
well-known chief investment strategist John D. Connolly, who
resigned to join a big money-management firm in suburban
Philadelphia.
   As a result of Wall Street's contraction since the 1987
stock-market crash, many stars of brokerage firms' research
departments have migrated to money management, which remains
lucrative.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Mr. Connolly, one of Wall Street's most bullish
strategists in recent months, will become a portfolio manager
with Miller, Anderson & Sherrerd, a West Conshohocken, Pa.,
firm that manages about $21.2 billion in assets for 115
clients, mainly pension funds and endowments.</p>
<p>No successor was named.</p>
<p>Mr. Connolly is the second high-profile market forecaster
in the past year to leave Dean Witter, a unit of Sears,
Roebuck & Co. Last year at this time, John Mendelson -- whose
market comments once rocked Wall Street, before his
persistent bearishness lost him some of his clout -- also
resigned. Dean Witter executives say the two resignations
aren't comparable; even while Mr. Mendelson was around, Mr.
Connolly clearly had the highest profile at the firm.</p>
<p>Mr. Connolly, in addition to serving as chairman of Dean
Witter's investment policy committee, also had the title of
an assistant director of research. "We're seeking a successor
now," a Dean Witter executive said. He added that Mr.
Connolly will be missed: "It's our loss; it's their gain,"
the executive said.</p>
<p>Mr. Connolly, who is on vacation, prior to starting work
at Miller Anderson on Sept. 17, couldn't be reached for
comment.</p>
<p>Manny Korman, Dean Witter's head of research, said in a
letter to the firm's branches that Mr. Connolly, who joined
Dean Witter in 1984, wanted to become a full-time money
manager and "make a change in his personal life style." He
wished Mr. Connolly success.</p>
<p>In recent months, Mr. Connolly was the most bullish of
strategists at 10 large brokerage firms whose
asset-allocation advice is tracked by The Wall Street
Journal. In mid-October of 1989 he began recommending that
investors keep 85% of their money in stocks, a much higher
allocation than most strategists. And Mr. Connolly held to
that advice until the Mideast crisis recently erupted, at
which time he reduced his recommended stock exposure but
still kept it higher than that of strategists at other firms.</p>
<p>The bullish advice worked out well in the second quarter,
when Dean Witter's recommended allocation led all firms. But
it is certain that Dean Witter's performance will wane in the
current quarter, given the stock market's large declines.</p>
