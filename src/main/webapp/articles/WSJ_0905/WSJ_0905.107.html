	<p class="article-leader">France's state-controlled Societe Nationale Elf Aquitaine
said steady gains in the chemical sector helped boost its
first-half net income 14% to 4.9 billion francs ($926
million) from 4.3 billion francs a year earlier.
   Sales weren't disclosed.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The profit pace followed flat growth in 1989, but fell
short of Elf Chairman Loik Le Floch-Prigent's estimate
earlier this year that earnings for 1990 may grow 20% or
more.</p>
<p>Chemical sector operating profit rose slightly to 3.7
billion francs from 3.4 billion francs, though Elf noted that
the 1989 first-half figure reflected prices for base
chemicals that were "extremely high" in relative terms. The
chemical results also included a one-time capital gain of 650
million francs from the sale of paint maker La Seigneurie
S.A.</p>
