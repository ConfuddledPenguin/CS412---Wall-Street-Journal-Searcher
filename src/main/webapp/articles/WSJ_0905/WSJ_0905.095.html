	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Foreign investors continued as net sellers of
U.S. equities in April and May, selling a combined net $3.4
billion of stocks, early data from the Securities Industry
Association show.
   At the same time, foreign investors were only modest net
buyers of U.S. corporate bonds in those months, with
corporate bond purchases totaling a combined net $2.3
billion, the data indicate. In addition, the SIA called
foreign investors' interest in U.S. Treasury securities
"marginal" during April and May, with net purchases of
Treasury securities totaling $576 million.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The figures reflect unease about the U.S. economy, as well
as positive developments in the politics and economies of
European countries, said David G. Strongin, director of
international finance for the SIA, in a report.</p>
<p>"It's a sea change in how foreign investors are looking at
U.S. securities," Mr. Strongin said in an interview.
Ordinarily, the securities industry trade association
releases quarterly figures, but Mr. Strongin said that
because the "pattern of a continued divestment" continued
during the two months from the previous quarter, the SIA
wanted to get the figures out quickly.</p>
<p>In April and May 1989, foreign investors were net buyers
of U.S. stocks, with net purchases totaling $960 million.
They also were net buyers of U.S. Treasury securities, with
net purchases totaling $7.03 billion, and net buyers of U.S.
corporate bonds, with net purchases of $2.77 billion of them.</p>
<p>Mr. Strongin pointed out that for the first five months,
all foreign activity in U.S. securities resulted in net sales
of $4.3 billion, compared with net purchases in the
year-earlier period of $42.3 billion.</p>
<p>He said the consequences of the lack of support from
foreign investors, in addition to hurting stock and bond
prices, likely would be higher interest rates, all things
being equal. He said the SIA expects the trend to be similar
in the third quarter.</p>
<p>In the first quarter, net sales of equities by foreign
investors totaled $3.3 billion. In the quarter, net purchases
of corporate bonds by foreign investors totaled $3.4 billion,
a spokesman said. Net sales of Treasury securities totaled
$6.5 billion, he added.</p>
<p>The net sales by foreign investors in U.S. securities in
the first quarter represented the first net outflow since the
third quarter of 1983, the SIA said.</p>
