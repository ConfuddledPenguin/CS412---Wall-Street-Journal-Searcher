	<p class="article-leader">Electronic Data Systems Corp., the data processing unit of
General Motors Corp., and a group led by Chicago investor Jay
Pritzker have agreed to buy the parent of Ticor Title
Insurance Cos., a big real estate title insurance concern.
   Exact terms of the acquisition weren't disclosed. However,
an official of Ticor's parent, closely held Westwood Equities
Corp., said the purchase price is less than Ticor's annual
gross revenue of roughly $500 million. EDS also didn't
disclose how ownership of Ticor will be divided with Mr.
Pritzker's group, New Century Enterprises Inc.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The venture gives EDS a major entrance into a potentially
lucrative market. The deal "is a big opportunity for us. It
fits very well with the other property businesses we're in,"
said Ben Sims, president of EDS's insurance business unit.</p>
<p>Ticor offers EDS and GM access to an enormous base of data
on land transactions that could be valuable to their existing
financial services marketing efforts. GM, for example, has a
mortgage lending unit, while EDS is the largest supplier of
data processing for the property and casualty insurance
industry.</p>
<p>In acquiring a piece of Ticor, EDS expands its strategy of
buying big customers to enter new markets.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, EDS jumped into the airline computer
reservation business by forming a joint venture with Texas
Air Corp. to take over Texas Air's System One airline
reservation system. EDS was to pay $250 million for its share
of the venture, and also was to receive a 10-year contract
originally valued at $4 billion to handle data processing for
Texas Air's Eastern and Continental airlines units. EDS still
hasn't closed this deal, however, because of problems related
to Eastern's bankruptcy proceedings. Company officials have
said the terms of the deal could change.</p>
<p>In conjunction with the Ticor deal, EDS will get a data
processing contract that company officials estimate will
generate $200 million to $300 million in revenue over 10
years.</p>
<p>Ticor has been looking for a potential buyer for the past
four years, said Winston V. Morrow, Westwood's chairman,
president and chief executive officer. The company's core
title insurance business has been unprofitable in recent
years "due to a very heavy curve of losses in this industry,"
he said. The downturn in the real estate market has
engendered a rise in claims against title insurance, Mr.
Morrow said.</p>
<p>Ticor, based in Los Angeles, has had other problems.</p>
<p>In 1986, the company's mortgage insurance unit, TMIC
Insurance Co., was taken over by California insurance
regulators after it sustained huge losses on policies issued
to a failed real-estate syndication firm, Equity Programs
Investment Corp.</p>
<p>The TMIC Insurance mess and controversy over Ticor's
handling of it "was a nightmare" that "haunted" the rest of
Ticor's operations, Mr. Morrow said. Westwood, formed last
year as a parent entity for Ticor's various operations, still
owes $20 million of $30 million pledged to put the mortgage
insurance unit back on a sound footing, Mr. Morrow said. That
money will be paid as part of the acquisition, he said.</p>
<p>Because of the TMIC debacle and the slump in the title
insurance business, Ticor couldn't afford technology needed
to modernize its operations. The company's 300 company-owned
offices and its more than 1,000 independent agents amass
enormous amounts of information on U.S. property
transactions. However, the company's data handling capability
"is closer to the quill pen era" than the computer age, Mr.
Morrow said.</p>
