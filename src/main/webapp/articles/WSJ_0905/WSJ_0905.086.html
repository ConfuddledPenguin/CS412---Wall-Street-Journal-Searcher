	<p class="article-leader">TORONTO -- Sanwa Bank said it agreed to purchase a 75%
stake in McCarthy Securities Ltd., making it the first
Japanese bank to acquire a majority interest in a Canadian
securities firm.
   The offer comes at a time when Canadian investment firms
are struggling. Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. sold its
Canadian unit in June, citing continued losses, and Merrill
Lynch Canada Inc. sold its retail operations in January. Of
the Toronto Stock Exchange's 75 member firms, only 28 managed
to eke out a profit in the first quarter of this year.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Still, Nobua Noujima, senior vice president at Sanwa
Bank's Canadian operations, said the interest of Japanese
investors in the Canadian market is growing and his company
wanted direct access to Canadian securities.</p>
<p>"Canada is a very interesting market," Mr. Noujima said.
"Canadian bonds in particular are more and more interesting
to Japanese investors."</p>
<p>Terms of the acquisition weren't disclosed. The shares
will be acquired from McCarthy employees, who will retain the
remaining 25% stake. Leighton W. McCarthy, founder, chairman
and chief executive officer of McCarthy, is the major holder
of that 25%, Sanwa Bank said.</p>
<p>Mr. McCarthy will remain at the head of the company, which
is to be called Sanwa McCarthy Securities Ltd. The purchase
is subject to the approval of governmental authorities in
both Canada and Japan. A Sanwa representative will be
appointed to the seven-member McCarthy board.</p>
<p>McCarthy is one of the few remaining independent brokerage
houses in Canada following recent acquisitions of securities
firms by Canadian banks and mergers among smaller firms. Mr.
McCarthy said Sanwa Bank approached McCarthy about the
merger. He said that while the company wasn't looking for a
partner, it was "feeling the pressure" of being a small,
independent firm and realized the merger was necessary for
growth. The company employs 62 people and has 4 million
Canadian dollars (US$3.5 million) in capital.</p>
<p>Sanwa Bank, with assets of US$387 billion, said it will
make "significant additional capital" available to Sanwa
McCarthy.</p>
