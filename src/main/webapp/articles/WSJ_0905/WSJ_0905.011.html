	<p class="article-leader">"Hard luck never walks in the mountains, but stays in the
valleys among the people." This is how they say, "it never
rains but it pours" in Czechoslovakia, and this was the
response of a Prague official when asked what he thought
about the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait. He meant to make a joke,
but he frowned immediately afterward. There is no light way
to talk about the combination of high energy prices and
foreign trade problems that are about to hit Eastern Europe
as a direct result of Saddam Hussein's aggression.
   The energy crisis will come first. Since World War II, the
nations of the former socialist bloc have received virtually
all of their oil and natural gas from the Soviet Union.
Within the framework of Comecon, the East Bloc's trade
organization, prices were set for five years in advance,
according to the average world price of the preceding five
years. This meant that prices were way out of line with the
world market. It didn't matter much though, because Comecon
members paid the Soviet Union not with money but with goods.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>So, dozens and dozens of bureaucrats in every country were
required to coordinate shipments of shoddy electronic
equipment, outdated machinery, poor quality clothes and food
products to the Soviet Union through centralized, state-owned
foreign trade enterprises. Calculations were made in a
nontransferable "currency" called the transferable ruble,
whose exchange value with the zloty, the crown or the forint
depended on whim and political weather. In retrospect, it is
hard to believe that this elaborate system of comradely
barter kept factories in business as long as it did.</p>
<p>As of January, though, barter officially comes to an end.
Eastern Europe must buy its oil and petrol from the Soviet
Union for hard currency at world prices. East Bloc newspapers
and governments have been worrying all year what the change
will do to their economies. Now the Iraq crisis means that
those prices are much higher than anyone expected.</p>
<p>Where will Poland, with its $40 billion debt, or Hungary,
with its $20 billion debt, find the hard currency to buy
energy at world prices? The region's total energy needs could
require between $6 billion and $10 billion next year. No one
can explain where this money will come from. The goods once
sent to the Soviet Union in exchange for energy are precisely
not the things that anyone there, or anywhere else, is going
to use hard currency to buy.</p>
<p>Consumer goods and light machinery made in the West are
going to be both better and cheaper than the things the
Soviet Union once bought in Eastern Europe. Better, because
technology is higher; cheaper, because the West started
devising ways to save on energy costs long ago. Eastern
Europe's old Soviet markets will shrink, and shifting the
same goods to Western markets will not happen quickly.</p>
<p>Enormous structural faults on the micro level of
individual firms and the macro level of the entire economy
are in fact Comecon's greatest legacy. Eastern European
companies that designed goods for the Soviet Union never had
any incentive to improve quality or quantity, or least of all
to economize on energy. Whole industrial sectors in East
Europe developed on the premise of cheap oil, cheap raw
materials and infinite markets. Hungary, a nation without
iron ore or major energy resources, possesses a vast steel
industry.</p>
<p>Mere exposure to competition coupled with changes in
monetary policy, the kinds of economic reform tools which the
West itself uses, will not produce overnight change in
Eastern Europe. The East German products now competing for
the first time with Western goods are the best proof of this
problem. These things, from radios to canned vegetables, are
going unpurchased because they are both lower quality and
more expensive. The factories that make them are not going to
switch quickly to another kind of production. They are going
to close down and fire their workers. Restructuring, quality
improvement and energy efficiency all cost money in the short
term, and there are no resources to keep the plants in
operation until the long term benefits can be felt.</p>
<p>Massive Western investment and aid for re-training and
re-tooling for every country in Eastern Europe on a scale
much greater than anything discussed so far -- perhaps
something like the $500 billion West Germany, it is
estimated, could soon be spending in East Germany -- is one
solution. But where will Western industrialists, now facing
sudden energy prices rises, find the spare cash to invest in
the Romanian auto industry or Polish textiles? Where will
Western governments, now realizing that even the collapse of
the Soviet Union doesn't make the world a safe place, find
the spare cash to re-train the steel mill workers of a few
tiny, insignificant democracies? The so-called "peace
dividend," the money expected to flow back into national
budgets after deep cuts in defense spending, no longer looks
imminent.</p>
<p>Less expensive, temporary measures on the part of the
West, like lending money to the Soviet Union for the express
purpose of purchasing East European products, could help.
Reduction in import duties and taxes on East European goods
will also make a difference. But the readjustment to
capitalism will now succeed or fail depending on the speed of
the East European governments themselves: How fast they can
clear up the tangle of ownership problems, what kinds of tax
laws and interest rates are set and how quickly, how long it
takes for new companies, domestic and foreign, to set up
business.</p>
<p>All of these problems existed before the Iraqi invasion of
Kuwait. The crisis, by bringing back higher oil prices and
diverting the energy and the attention of the West, has
simply heightened them. The expected readjustment period and
the accompanying possibility of political instability will
arrive more quickly and with greater severity than expected.
Time for debate has already run out.</p>
