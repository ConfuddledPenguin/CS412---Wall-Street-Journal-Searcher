	<p class="article-leader">LOS ANGELES -- Atlantic Richfield Co., which caters to
cost-conscious motorists in the West, will unveil a new
gasoline in Southern California that is expected to be a
cleaner version of its premium unleaded fuel.
   Analysts speculated that Arco will roll out an
emission-control version of its unleaded fuel as a complement
to its reformulated gasoline for pre-1975 cars that has
proven very successful. Last year, Arco was the first
gasoline company to scrap its regular leaded fuel in favor of
the high-octane, emission-control unleaded gasoline, which is
aimed at the 20% of motorists in its selling area who drive
older cars.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>M. Craig Schwerdt, an oil analyst with Drake Capital
Securities Inc., said Arco has in the past proposed the
notion of "designer fuels" for specific markets. Such fuels
could address differences in altitude, smog-control standards
and other variables.</p>
<p>An Arco spokesman declined to discuss the new product,
which is scheduled to be introduced at a press conference
Thursday. Arco's stock closed at $135.625, up 75 cents in
composite New York Stock Exchange trading.</p>
