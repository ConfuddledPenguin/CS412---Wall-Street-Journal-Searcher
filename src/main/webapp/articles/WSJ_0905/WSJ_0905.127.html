	<p class="article-leader">Campeau Corp.'s retail units, Federated Department Stores
Inc. and Allied Stores Corp., reported net losses of $50
million in July, "substantially less than expected," the
companies said.
   In documents filed with U.S. Bankruptcy Court in
Cincinnati, Federated said it had a net loss of $31.7 million
for the four weeks ended Aug. 4. For the previous period, the
five weeks ended July 7, Federated reported net losses of
$30.6 million. Meanwhile, Allied posted a net loss of $18.3
million in July compared with $18.6 in the previous period.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The company noted that the net losses included non-cash
interest and interest on the company's pre-petition debt,
which account for about $35.1 million of the units' $42.6
million interest expense. The results also include a $2.5
million one-time charge due to an accounting change.</p>
<p>Analysts noted that seasonal factors and the absence of
year-earlier comparisons make it difficult to assess
Federated and Allied's progress since seeking Chapter 11
bankruptcy protection on Jan. 15.</p>
<p>Janet Mangano, an analyst at Jesup, Josephthal & Co. in
New York, noted that the latest results were "rather
encouraging."</p>
<p>Federated's sales for the four weeks were $263.5 million,
while Allied's sales were $150.1 million.</p>
<p>In the combined June-July period, Federated had $3.5
million in cash flow while Allied had $1.94 million.</p>
