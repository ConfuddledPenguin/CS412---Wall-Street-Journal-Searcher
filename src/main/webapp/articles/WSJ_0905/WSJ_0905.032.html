	<p class="article-leader">The Rev. Steve Peters was in Denver the other day, burning
rock album covers and praying for the soul of rocker Ozzy
Osborne, the bat-chomping community's patron saint. Not all
of us are ready to meet the reverend down by the bonfire, but
as Kenneth Cmiel skillfully illustrates in "Democratic
Eloquence" (William Morrow, 351 pages, $24.95), cultural
standards have been a bit higher in the past than they are in
this, the Age of the Gonad. A little pining is in order.
   How much higher were those standards? An 1847 article in
Blackwood's Magazine tells the story of a couple of British
gentlemen who made the mistake of asking an American traveler
a simple question: "Of course you were in raptures with the
Venus de Medici?" To which the Yank responded, "Well, sir, to
tell you the truth, I don't care much about the stone gals."</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The reaction is instructive: The poor blokes collapsed.
Venus, the author wailed, "a thing Praxiteles might have
touched with his chisel, or Pericles have looked upon, to be
called a `stone gal.' Had he doubted its genuineness, or
spoken of it as a specimen of secondary art, he might have
been deemed critical, hypercritical; but this was classic
impiety, an irreverence, a profanity."</p>
<p>Sound a little precious? Of course. Think Mr. Cmiel had to
dig deep to find this gem? Then listen to the editors of Good
Housekeeping, who in 1885 editorialized about the impropriety
of saying "thanks." "Thanks is cold, careless, and uncivil,"
they wrote. "It is heartless, meaningless, and harsh to the
sensitive listener." In the same spirit, the New York Times
had editorialized four years earlier about girls from "good
homes" using expressions like, "What a cunning hat."</p>
<p>Even the author of the Gettysburg Address was not good
enough for some of his contemporaries, one of whom referred
to Mr. Lincoln as "a barbarian, Scythian, yahoo, or gorilla."
Why? Because he mixed slang with his Shakespeare, which
resulted in what Mr. Cmiel calls the "middling style." This
was -- and is -- the language of democracy, and was a clear
affront to the gentlemen who had dominated public life. And
so Emerson sniffed: "Lincoln. We must accept the results of
universal suffrage & not try to make it appear that we can
elect fine gentlemen."</p>
<p>And so the slide proceeded, helped along by newspapers
only too eager to strip the petticoats off the mother tongue.
While modern editors often spend their days bleeding the life
out of reporters' already anemic prose, Horace Greeley, who
never allowed so-called "editorial dignity" to get in his
way, launched articles with armor-piercing ledes. "We defy
the Father of lies himself to crowd more stupendous
falsehoods into a paragraph," he began one broadside. "Major
Noah]" began another, "Why won't you tell the truth once in a
century, for the variety of the thing."</p>
<p>Elsewhere in the popular press, the New York Sun's
headline writers asked the right questions -- "Is Secretary
Fish a Fool or a Scoundrel?" -- and made the memorable
observations: "Judge Woodruff's Court -- Air That Would Kill
a Hog." When a murderer repented at the gallows, the Chicago
Times captured the happy ending in this immortal headline:
"JERKED TO JESUS."</p>
<p>There were stiff papers, of course, among them the New
York Evening Post, the Chicago Tribune, and the stiffest one
of all -- the New York Times. Then, as now, the Times
attempted to lead the world around by the ear, like an
overbearing aunt.</p>
<p>The editors were quick to hike their pinkies over the New
York Herald's personals column, a development of unsurpassed
vileness. At one time, they lamented, "no respectable woman
of the educated class would be seen reading the paper. Its
contents were such that an avowed taste for them would have
justly tarnished such a woman's reputation."</p>
<p>But the Times was fighting a rearguard action. The
personals were wildly popular and there was no stopping the
march of the riffraff. Linguistic theory, Mr. Cmiel writes,
gave intellectual credence to popular styles; dictionaries
began including slang; etiquette books tolerated smoking.
Only the King James Bible escaped the sweet kiss of
vulgarity: The Revised Standard Version, 11 years in the
making and designed to replace the old standby, was a flop
(though newsboys, hawking it with their papers, did their
best to move the new merchandise, singing "Here's yer New
Testament, jest out.")</p>
<p>In the present day, public speech includes rock lyrics,
some of which are said to inspire devotees to commit suicide
(and who knows how many concertgoers have had their brains
lanced by a stray laser beam). The Times has stopped scolding
proper girls for mentioning "cunning hats" and has instead
taken to defending the rappers and their hymns to
gynecological blitzkrieg. And in politics, a woman hailed as
one of the great orators of the day stands before the world
and screeches: "Po George. He caint hep it. He was bone with
uh silva foot in his mouth."</p>
<p>If we slide much more, we'll all be barking.</p>
