	<p class="article-leader">TULSA, Okla. -- Kinark Corp. said its previously announced
accord to sell its Camelot Hotels to Wilmae Inc. for $12
million was terminated.
   Paul Chastain, Kinark's co-chief executive officer, said
closely held Wilmae, of Santa Rosa, Calif., "had delays in
obtaining financing" and failed to make a required $50,000
deposit. He added that Wilmae will forfeit an earlier $50,000
deposit.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Kinark, which owns galvanizing plants and chemical-storage
facilities, said it plans to continue efforts to sell the
hotels.</p>
