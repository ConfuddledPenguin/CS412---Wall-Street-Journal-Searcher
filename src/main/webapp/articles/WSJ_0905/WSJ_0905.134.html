	<p class="article-leader">MIAMI -- Former Sen. Lawton Chiles won an easy victory
over Rep. Bill Nelson in a primary yesterday to become the
Democratic nominee for governor of Florida.
   He will face Gov. Bob Martinez, who overwhelmed four
challengers in the Republican primary to win a chance to vie
for his second term.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The race is important because Florida is one of the big
states in the Sun Belt that will gain congressional seats as
a result of the 1990 census. The governor will play a
significant role in the redistricting process.</p>
<p>The Chiles victory represents a return-from-retirement of
Mr. Chiles, who left the Senate in 1988 after being diagnosed
with having clinical depression. Mr. Chiles will campaign
under a self-imposed obstacle -- a $100 limit on individual
campaign contributions. The limitation is an open challenge
to the convention of big-money politics.</p>
<p>With more than 50% of precincts reporting, Mr. Chiles was
ahead of Rep. Nelson 70%-30%. Gov. Martinez won a solid
two-thirds of the Republican vote.</p>
