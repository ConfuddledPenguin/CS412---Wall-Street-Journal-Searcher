	<p class="article-leader">So David Littman "High-Tax States Are Low-Growth States"
(editorial page, Aug. 6) believes that states can easily
reverse slow population growth simply by lowering their
taxes. Unfortunately, the statistic on which he based his
conclusion is not meaningful as used, and his analysis
ignores a substantial amount of contrary evidence.
   The index of state "relative tax effort" computed by the
Advisory Commission on Intergovernmental Relations measures
not tax levels, but a state's tax collections relative to its
potential tax capacity. "Tax capacity" is an attempt to
measure what collections would be if that state had a typical
state tax structure.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Tax levels seem more meaningful for people considering a
move. California's "relative tax effort" is below the
national average, even though taxes per person in California
are about 10% above the national average. In contrast, taxes
per person are nearly $300 lower in Iowa than California, but
Iowa is categorized as an above-average "tax effort" state.
For someone comparing $50,000 jobs in California and Iowa
based on taxes, it seems more relevant that taxes for the
average person are $300 lower in Iowa, even though Iowa has
higher "relative tax effort."</p>
<p>Differences in state taxes per person do not seem to have
influenced state population changes. Of the 10 states
identified as having the slowest relative population growth,
Indiana, Iowa, North Dakota, Ohio, Pennsylvania and West
Virginia actually collected taxes per person below the
national average in 1988. Alaska, California and Washington,
listed as having fast relative population growth, collect
higher taxes per person than average. (Alabama, Arkansas and
Mississippi are perennially low-tax states, but have not
enjoyed substantial relative economic growth.)</p>
<p>The relevant issue is not whether taxes are higher in one
state than another, but whether a government is providing the
level and type of services desired by its residents. Taxes
are payments for services, and tax differences reflect
differences in demand and cost. The economic principle of "no
free lunch" applies -- people get the services they pay for.
And better services -- particularly for education and
transportation -- can attract both capital and individuals.
As population and incomes increase, increases in the demand
and costs for government services often occur. This requires
states -- even such low-tax states as Arizona, Florida, New
Hampshire and Texas -- to search for new revenues to build
infrastructure and finance those services.</p>
<p>The realignment of population toward the South and West
continues. This trend has been influenced by the changing age
and ethnic composition of the population, by technological
and infrastructure changes that have reduced the meaning of
distances, and by a desire for warmer climates and
less-crowded areas. Taxes are not the explanation. As long as
governments provide the services demanded by residents as
efficiently as possible, the fiscal differences among the
states reflect what people want and are a desirable feature
of our federal fiscal system.</p>

<p>Mr. Littman referred to California as a low-tax state. As
a California taxpayer, I wonder about that. I pay California
state income taxes of 9.3%, one of the highest in the nation.
In my county of Santa Clara, I pay additional sales taxes of
7.25%, also one of the nation's highest. According to a
recent Tax Foundation tax table, in 1988 California had a
per-capita state income tax of $454.34. Only 11 other states
had higher income taxes for that year.</p>
<p>Anyone who thinks of California as a low-tax haven may be
living in a state of delusion.</p>
