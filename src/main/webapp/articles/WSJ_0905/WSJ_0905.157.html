	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Another longtime prop for the U.S. stock
market is crumbling, as Japan's big banks pull back from
financing buy-outs of American companies.
   Japanese bankers say they have lost their 1980s appetite
for bankrolling 35% to 50% of the loans for many major
leveraged buy-outs.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"Now we are extremely cautious," says Toru Kusukawa,
Tokyo-based deputy president of Fuji Bank Ltd.</p>
<p>His view is shared by many Japanese bankers. It helps
explain why buy-out financing nowadays is extremely hard to
get -- and why shares of U.S. companies that might be buy-out
targets are languishing. In a buy-out, a company's publicly
held stock is bought up by a small, debt-financed group,
often including management.</p>
<p>The Japanese retreat was sparked when Japan's banks got
embroiled in their first major U.S. bankruptcy-law case, last
winter's filings by two Campeau Corp. subsidiaries, Allied
Stores and Federated Department Stores. Many Japanese banks
are becoming more selective in pursuing the fat fees and
prestige associated with funding leveraged buy-outs.</p>
<p>Oddly enough, the plunging Japanese stock market also is
at the root of the banks' new-found reluctance. The stock
swoon in Tokyo is eroding the capital base of the banks, by
cutting the value of their stockholdings in other Japanese
companies. And this is happening just as the banks are
striving to meet tightened international standards for bank
capital.</p>
<p>Banks in the major industrial countries doing cross-border
business must have capital equal to at least 8% of their
assets by 1993. Under the new rules, some of which take
effect next year, Japan's banks can count as part of their
capital 45% of the paper gains on their Japanese
stockholdings. But with Japanese stock prices down more than
35% this year and the banks' stock portfolios shriveling in
value, several banks are believed to be close to, if not
below, the 8% ratio.</p>
<p>This is worrisome to the Japanese banks, several of which
got stung in the financial hornet's nest of Federated
Department Stores.</p>
<p>Fuji Bank, for instance, initially intended to steer clear
of the Federated buy-out, then learned that rival Sumitomo
Bank Ltd. was participating. "We said, `They are in it, so
why not?,'" Mr. Kusukawa of Fuji Bank says. "That was the
biggest mistake we made."</p>
<p>He adds: "We never expected this drastic change in the
`junk' bond market. Two years ago, everybody was so
enthusiastic." Prices have slumped in the past year for
high-yield junk, and recession fears are preying on this $200
billion public market.</p>
<p>Sanwa Bank, also caught with a big chunk of Federated
loans on its books, is weighing "a number of ideas where we
would like to improve our {loan} approval system," Junichi
Goto, a Tokyo-based senior managing director at the bank,
says. "We feel LBOs have had their day in the sun."</p>
<p>Moreover, Japan's banks have invested about $1 billion in
leveraged buy-out funds, many of them assembled by U.S.
investment banks. The Japanese banks are upset that a lot of
this money hasn't even been invested and that returns on some
deals have been below expectations. As a U.S. banker
concedes: "They made capital commitments to these funds for
five to seven years, and they are being charged a hefty
annual service charge -- about 1%. And the funds aren't doing
anything."</p>
<p>U.S. takeover activity in general is slow because of tight
credit conditions, a shaky junk bond market and a weak
economy. Japanese bankers also emphasize factors specific to
their own institutions that make them particularly cautious.</p>
<p>Japanese bankers say that regulators in both Japan and the
U.S., as well as American credit-rating companies, are
concerned about lending related to buy-outs. Three weeks ago,
Moody's Investors Service cited Fuji Bank's "relatively high
exposure to highly leveraged transactions," among other
reasons, in downgrading the bank's long-term debt to
double-A-1 from triple-A. Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank Ltd., the
world's biggest bank, was similarly downgraded at the same
time. Though buy-out lending wasn't cited as a reason in
Dai-Ichi's case, Japanese bankers say the message is clear.</p>
<p>"You have to restrain yourself from going up to a higher
percentage {of such loans} relative to your capital base,"
says the head of U.S. operations for another big Japanese
bank.</p>
<p>Indeed, IBCA Ltd., a London-based credit rating concern,
yesterday placed under review for possible downgrades its
ratings on debt of several big Japanese banks: Dai-Ichi
Kangyo, Fuji, Sanwa, Mitsubishi Bank Ltd., Sumitomo Bank and
Industrial Bank of Japan Ltd. IBCA cited the fall in the
Tokyo stock market and "capital pressures" on the banks.</p>
<p>In July, 12 Japanese banks did supply $920 million of a
$2.25 billion loan that was part of a refinancing of RJR
Nabisco Inc. But fees on that transaction were unusually
tempting. In addition, Japanese bankers have long believed
that if the tobacco and food company ever went under, a sale
of its parts could easily cover their loans.</p>
<p>Still, the RJR deal is adding to their doubts about
leveraged buy-outs. Several Japanese banks said they placed
all of their new RJR loans in a $1.4 billion pool, seeking to
sell the debt to smaller U.S. banks and other foreign
financial institutions. The pool expired Aug. 24, leaving
much of the RJR debt unsold -- mostly because the lead banks
were reluctant to share their fat fees with prospective
buyers.</p>
<p>Beginning this week, each of the banks that originated the
$2.25 billion credit can try to sell its own loans
individually. A U.S. banker involved in the RJR loans says he
isn't overly worried; he argues that the debt will be sold
eventually.</p>
<p>The Japanese aren't so sanguine. They fear they will be
stuck with too much of the RJR debt. Some institutions to
which they sold U.S. buy-out loans in the past -- notably
Japanese regional banks -- aren't eager to buy now.</p>
<p>A senior Japanese executive at a bank that joined in the
initial RJR syndicate says: "The real intention in this deal
was to earn the fees, not interest income. Then you don't
have to keep the loans on your balance sheet."</p>
<p>Evidence of the waning appetite for highly leveraged
deals, Japanese bankers say, is the buy-out of Saks Fifth
Avenue by Investcorp. Only three or four Japanese banks
contributed $100 million to $150 million combined, out of a
total $775 million in bank financing for the acquisition.
(Some U.S. bankers contend that with buy-out transactions
shrinking in size, support from any particular group of banks
isn't as important as in the past.)</p>
<p>Moreover, retreating from buy-out deals is tough for the
Japanese banks. At a time when their cost of funds is
skyrocketing and profit margins from corporate lending are
razor thin, buy-out deals offer hefty fee income. For this
reason, some U.S. bankers believe the Japanese will be back.</p>
<p>"They might be saying they aren't interested in LBO
financing because rating agencies have criticized them, and
the {Japanese} Finance Ministry is on their case. It's the
politically correct thing to do," an American banker says.
"But if a good deal came their way, I don't think they'd
hesitate."</p>
<p>Noting that "there is still a need for restructuring in
the U.S.," Hideo Ishihara, deputy president of Industrial
Bank of Japan in Tokyo, says: "We expect takeovers to
continue in the small and medium{sized} company area. We look
to remain relatively conservative, but will make loans if the
credit meets our criteria."</p>
<p>Nonetheless, Mr. Ishihara warns: "In order to induce banks
to lend, you need to structure deals more conservatively. The
days of the megadeals like RJR Nabisco and so on are gone."</p>
