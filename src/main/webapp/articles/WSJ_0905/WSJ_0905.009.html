	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Johnson & Johnson, responding to an aggressive
new ad campaign, filed a lawsuit charging rival Bristol-Myers
Squibb Co. with falsely claiming that Aspirin-Free Excedrin
is a better pain reliever than J&J's Extra-Strength Tylenol.
   In the lawsuit, filed in U.S. District Court in Manhattan,
J&J, New Brunswick, N.J., asked that Bristol-Myers be ordered
to halt the ads, which began appearing last week, and recall
all copies of the promotional material. Both drugs contain
the same dose of pain reliever, 500 milligrams of
acetaminophen, which Johnson says makes the products
"equivalent pain relievers."</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Charging that Bristol-Myers "has a history of habitual
false advertising," the lawsuit also raises questions about
an additional ingredient in the Excedrin: 65 milligrams of
caffeine.</p>
<p>The lawsuit, filed by J&J's McNeil division, which makes
Tylenol, criticized Bristol-Myers's claims that the caffeine
makes the pain reliever more effective. Instead, Johnson said
in the suit, caffeine is "a stimulant that has never been
shown to have any analgesic properties."</p>
<p>The lawsuit added that the Food and Drug Administration
"repeatedly has rejected Bristol's argument and, as recently
as 1988, has reaffirmed its view that caffeine's claim to
effectiveness is unsubstantiated."</p>
<p>A spokesman for Bristol-Myers, New York, defended the new
ad campaign. "Aspirin-Free Excedrin provides superior
headache relief over Extra-Strength Tylenol. This is fully
supported by clinical studies," he said. He said that
caffeine is also an ingredient in some other Excedrin
products and that the company's research shows that it
increases the effectiveness of acetaminophen.</p>
<p>Bristol-Myers's spokesman also said that J&J had asked the
major television networks not to run the ads, claiming that
they were false and misleading. "After extensive review, the
networks rejected the challenge and accepted our ads for
broadcast," the spokesman said.</p>
<p>J&J said in the lawsuit that Bristol-Myers plans to spend
$9 million on the new ad campaign in the next four months. It
said the ads are "expressly designed to lure customers away
from . . . Tylenol."</p>
<p>J&J accused Bristol-Myers of incorrectly analyzing three
studies in which patients were asked about the effect of
Extra-Strength Tylenol and Aspirin-Free Excedrin.</p>
<p>"When analyzed using appropriate statistical procedures,
the headache studies show there is no differences in
effectiveness," the lawsuit said.</p>
