	<p class="article-leader">MOSCOW -- This summer's Soviet harvest is the biggest ever
-- so large that, even with the usual enormous losses during
handling and processing, it theoretically could meet all the
country's needs. But while millions of tons of grain ripen in
the fields, bread is rationed and hard to find on Moscow's
bakery shelves. And while harvesters gather millions of tons
of vegetables, shoppers find little more than cabbages in the
stores.
   The failure of the Soviet harvesting and distribution
system means Soviet consumers face even more frustration.
Worse yet is the strong possibility that the Soviet Union,
already economically shaky, will have to spend precious hard
currency to import more shiploads of grain.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>A tour of the food chain from farm to city grocery
discloses that this year, the Soviet Union's perennial
harvest crisis has been exacerbated by the breakdown of the
old system of Communist Party commands. The much-heralded
market economy -- the advent of which could provide real
motivation -- is barely visible. Meanwhile, any individual
initiative is stifled by bureaucratic lethargy and
indifference.</p>
<p>At the central office of Shoshensky State Farm, 80 miles
north of Moscow, director Anatoli Poltorikhin describes his
dilemma: he must fulfill production quotas directed from
above while, at the same time, his farm must turn a profit
under new economic policies.</p>
<p>There isn't enough farm machinery, so Mr. Poltorikhin
relies heavily on horses to work the farm's 15,000 acres. As
he passes one huge machine coughing its way across a golden
field, he warns: "Don't stop the driver to talk. We might
never get the combine started again."</p>
<p>In past years, farm managers at least could rely on
getting labor reinforcements from local factories during
harvest season. But fledgling economic reforms mean that
industries must become more self-reliant and profitable, so
they have little to gain from volunteering their workers.</p>
<p>The labor shortage is so great this year that farmers in
several regions have threatened not to provide food to nearby
cities if factory workers weren't sent. Elsewhere, local
governments have declared a state of emergency, giving them
the right to force factories to send workers.</p>
<p>For years, Moscow has tried to improve farm production.
Recent reforms have enabled more farms to sell part of their
produce directly to consumers at market prices rather than
through the state system. Last year, the government raised
its own purchase prices and started to pay partly in hard
currency for above-quota production.</p>
<p>The incentives have an edge of desperation to them; the
Soviet Union is running out of hard currency to spend on food
imports. Last year it imported 44 million tons of grain, and
expects to buy at least 20 million tons this year because so
much of the bumper harvest is being lost.</p>
<p>Mr. Poltorikhin manages 2,700 head of cattle, as well as
450 workers and their families. But all the money his farm
earns goes into an account controlled by bureaucrats in
Moscow. The most he can spend on farm needs at one time
without authority is 25 rubles -- about $40 at the official
exchange rate but only $4 at the more realistic tourist rate.</p>
<p>Money in the controlled account is supposed to pay for
supplies from the state -- but official channels generally
have little to offer. The press reels off the shortages: As
of mid-August, farmers still lacked spare parts valued at
$480 million, 2,800 grain combines, 2,400 threshers, 17,000
trucks and 360,000 tons of gasoline.</p>
<p>State farms have offered to pay harvest volunteers, and
television and newspapers have advertised the names of a
dozen farms and vegetable-distribution bases near Moscow that
need labor. But at Lenin State Farm near Moscow, no one seems
eager to deal with volunteers. At the workers' brigade
office, a woman sitting at a desk looks up in irritation as a
would-be apple-picker enters. "I don't know exactly when you
should have been here," she says, "but it's too late now, so
go away."</p>
<p>The situation is much the same at the next stop along the
food chain: the state-run vegetable-distribution bases
through which almost all fresh produce in the Soviet Union
passes between farm and store. Shura Dyomenaya, a volunteer,
paces angrily in front of the tomato and garlic section of
Dzerzhinsky Base in Moscow. She and 20 other volunteer
workers have waited for an hour, hoping to make the
equivalent of $14 for each ton of tomatoes they sort. The
volunteers have been told they are welcome to work but will
have to come back another time to get paid.</p>
<p>"It's a society of idiots," Mrs. Dyomenaya says loudly.
"Look, there's lots of work to be done, and it sits there
while they tell us not to work." Some volunteers decide to
take their chances on getting paid eventually and are
assigned to peel garlic. As for the knives that would make
the work easier -- well, there are none.</p>
<p>Nearby, a train car of watermelons is being unloaded by
the only people who still follow orders: draftees. The army
has sent 46,000 trucks, mobilized air force transport planes
and sent countless soldiers to the fields, according to press
reports.</p>
<p>Employees at Dzerzhinsky blame the problems on the farms.
"Look at the lousy fruit they sent us," says the director of
cold storage, slapping one pulpy apple down on the browning
one beneath. "They throw in the bad with the good so it all
counts toward their quota."</p>
<p>But the vegetable bases themselves are widely blamed for
letting produce rot. Truckers allege that some bases won't
let them deliver their loads until the vegetables start to
spoil, so they can buy them at a discount and sell them at
full price.</p>
<p>The government periodically cracks down. In the early
1980s, the director of Dzerzhinsky Base was executed for
taking bribes. But some base workers and shop managers look
back on those days with nostalgia. "It was run as a
business," recalls Ella Ovakimyan, a base manager. The
executed base director "paid people to make sure he got the
best stuff," she says, "and then he paid his workers extra.
At least it worked."</p>
<p>Now, truck driver Vyacheslav Grechishnikov is delayed for
an hour at Dzerzhinsky, his load of watermelons sitting in
the sun. "First, the base doesn't have people to unload the
watermelons from the train," he grumbles. "If they have the
people, they don't have the trucks to deliver the fruit. And
if somehow they get the trucks, and we take the stuff to the
store, the shop says they don't need it."</p>
<p>Thirty minutes later, he pulls up at Store No. 25. The
shop is a large room of empty shelves and cooling units long
since unplugged. A few sacks of green oranges and some
cabbages lie on one shelf, a bin of rotting potatoes near the
checkout.</p>
<p>Down the back hall in a small office, the driver's
prediction proves true. Lyudmeva Shevlugina, the store
director, turns him and his melons away.</p>
<p>"We didn't order them, and we don't need them," she says,
crossing her arms. After months of late deliveries from the
base, she got her own truck. In retaliation, the base often
refuses to deliver to her, telling her to use her own truck.
So, she says, her truck picks up melons from a different
source.</p>
<p>Mrs. Shevlugina starts to cry as she describes the latest
catastrophe. A week earlier, Dzerzhinsky Base sent her three
tons of potatoes in paper sacks. She tears open the paper and
points at the oozing mold.</p>
<p>"I told them the potatoes are no good, but they say it
isn't their problem," she laments. "And now, I'm supposed to
sell three tons of potatoes, but they're all rotten. How is a
person supposed to work when it's like this?"</p>
