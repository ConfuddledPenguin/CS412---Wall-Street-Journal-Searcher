	<p class="article-leader">BOSTON -- Bank of New England Corp. agreed to sell its
Rhode Island subsidiary to Citizens Financial Group, a unit
of the Royal Bank of Scotland Group PLC, for $75 million,
finishing a program of asset sales that has shrunk the
troubled regional bank by 30% in the past eight months.
   The sale will give the bank holding company $25 million in
profit. The company, which now has $23 billion in assets, is
still working for ways to raise much needed capital,
including a major swap of its debt for equity.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Kent Price, chief financial officer, said the $75 million
is slated for the bank's Massachusetts subsidiary, Bank of
New England N.A., where the combination of low equity and
problem loans, mostly in real estate, has been most serious.</p>
<p>At the end of the second quarter, the bank's overall
capital ratio, a comparison of equity to assets that
regulators use to measure a bank's health, was 1.64%, well
below the 3% level regulators ordered the bank to meet by May
31, 1990. Healthy banks have levels of 5% or more. The
capital level of the Massachusetts subsidiary, which has been
hovering near 1%, will be raised to about 2% by the infusion
of cash from the Rhode Island deal, according to Mr. Price.</p>
<p>Bondholders have $706 million in debentures that cost the
bank more than $60 million a year in interest payments. To
induce bondholders to exchange their debt for equity -- a
move that would ease the bank's capital problem -- the bank
needs to offer some cash. With the $75 million from sale of
the Rhode Island subsidiary now spoken for, it is unclear
where that cash could come from. Meanwhile, the bank has an
interest payment of $12.3 million due on Sept. 15.</p>
<p>The bank, which reported a $1.1 billion loss last year, is
struggling under a huge portfolio of nonperforming assets
that currently total $2.7 billion. Those assets bring no
return while costing the bank about $250 million in interest
payments to customers who deposited that money.</p>
<p>In the deal announced yesterday , Citizens Financial Group
acquired $900 million in deposits and $600 million in
selected loans from the Rhode Island subsidiary's portfolio.
The Bank of New England will retain about $220 million of the
subsidiary's loans. Mr. Price said some of them were troubled
loans, but he would not specify how many.</p>
