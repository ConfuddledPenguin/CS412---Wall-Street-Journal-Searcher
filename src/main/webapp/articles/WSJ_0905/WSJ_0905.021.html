	<p class="article-leader">SEATTLE -- Boeing Co. said it received an order valued at
$180 million for three aircraft from Lauda Air of Austria, a
private charter airline with some scheduled flights that was
founded by Nicki Lauda, a former champion race car driver.
   The aircraft maker and aerospace concern said Lauda
ordered one 767-300 extended-range jet and two 737-400s. In
addition, Lauda confirmed an order placed this year but never
announced for a 737-400 valued at about $37 million, Boeing
