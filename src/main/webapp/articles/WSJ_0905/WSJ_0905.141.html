	<p class="article-leader">Tokyo stocks fell broadly on profit-taking Tuesday as news
that crude oil producers would raise prices to Japanese
customers soaked sentiment, traders said.
   London shares closed lower, but recovered from a steep
drop in early afternoon trading. But the recovery, coming
amid thin trading, wasn't taken as a sign of things to come.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>In Tokyo, rounds of arbitrage selling, motivated by
weakness on the futures indexes, helped accelerate losses,
participants said.</p>
<p>The Nikkei Index of 225 issues fell 512.79 points to
24907.64.</p>
<p>In early trading in Tokyo Wednesday, the Nikkei index fell
another 142.95 points to 24764.69.</p>
<p>Tuesday's volume on the first section was estimated at 330
million shares, down from 368.9 million shares Monday.
Decliners outnumbered advancers 858 to 126, while 105 issues
were unchanged.</p>
<p>The Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed in the
first section dropped 35.54 points, or 1.83%, to 1910.38.</p>
<p>The second section index fell 60.33 points, or 1.58%, to
3761.51. Volume in the section was estimated at 9.3 million
shares, up from eight million shares Monday.</p>
<p>Sentiment was hurt by higher crude oil prices linked to
expectations of increased military tension in the Persian
Gulf, traders said.</p>
<p>Moreover, news that Qatari and Mexican crude oil producers
raised prices to Japanese customers and that the Ministry of
International Trade and Industry had "given in" to higher
prices for oil products was discouraging to the stock market,
noted Kevin Haag, a trader in overseas operations at Nomura
Securities.</p>
<p>As the stalemate in the Gulf continues with little
expectation for a negotiated settlement soon, Tokyo traders
said they're locked into short-term activities.</p>
<p>At the same time, however, brokerage houses are under
pressure from "tokkin" special money account clients to
realize profits before September book closings, noted Yusuke
Fujiwara, head of stock trading at Baring Securities Ltd.</p>
<p>Mr. Haag pointed out that the lack of institutional
interest in the market leaves trading activity up to dealers,
who continue to focus on speculative issues.</p>
<p>"It's just quick cash going into this market," one trader
at a U.K. firm said. "Individuals and dealers are punching
money into this thing, and then turning around to take
profits."</p>
<p>"There's a limited amount of cash going in," he added, "so
if there's a change in sentiment, everything changes. The
market has been relying on these (speculative) issues. If it
goes up on that, you know it's just going to come right back
down again."</p>
<p>Tuesday, the Nikkei Index dropped after the opening on
bearish sentiments, then gently bounced back on buying on
speculative issues.</p>
<p>However, by midmorning, the impact of arbitrage selling
and shifting sentiment began to surface as the Nikkei edged
lower. Toward the end of the morning, support gave way to
profit-taking and further selling on futures indexes,
allowing for later arbitrage selling.</p>
<p>Throughout the afternoon, the Nikkei continued to tumble,
falling easily below 25000 points and then hovering just
before hitting 24800 points.</p>
<p>In the midafternoon, some program buying by major
brokerage houses helped buoy the index above 24900 points,
but wasn't enough to ignite any buying interest.</p>
<p>Speculative issue Honshu Paper & Pulp, whose price gains
were rumored Monday to be under investigation by financial
authorities for potential stock price manipulation, closed at
4310 yen, down 70 yen ($29.92, down 49 cents), on heavy
volume. The price had been as high as 4600 yen, up 220 yen.</p>
<p>Tokyu Department Store, which Monday reported a 12% rise
in unconsolidated pretax profit for the first half, rose 140
yen to 1580 yen.</p>
<p>Mining, metal and steel shares were lower. Tokyo Steel
fell 170 yen to 3820 yen, Nippon Steel fell 14 yen to 481
yen, and NKK fell 11 yen to 454 yen. Kawasaki Steel dropped
10 yen to 467 yen, and Daido Steel retreated 30 yen to 695
yen.</p>
<p>Mitsubishi Metal fell 22 yen to 728 yen, while Mitsubishi
Mining fell 16 yen to 601 yen. Dowa Mining dropped 32 yen to
700 yen. Nippon Light Metal, traded actively by dealers, fell
50 yen to 1240 yen.</p>
<p>Blue-chips fell, including TDK, down 210 yen to 5090 yen,
Sony, down 80 yen to 7220 yen, Fanuc, down 220 yen to 5650
yen, and Kyocera, down 180 yen to 7470. But Pioneer rose 30
yen to 5,100 yen.</p>
<p>In London, poor trading volume continued but improved
slightly from Monday's record low for the year. And traders
reckon that both volume and sentiment will remain cool for
the near future.</p>
<p>The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100 Share Index dropped
18.6 points to 2148. The Financial Times 30 Share Index fell
16.5 points to 1670.9.</p>
<p>Volume was 286.2 million shares, up from Monday's 220.2
million shares.</p>
<p>Movement in Reckitt & Colman was the main feature of the
market, one trader said. Adverse market comments, concerning
earnings from recent acquisitions and long-term prospects,
are preceding Thursday's diclosure of interim figures. The
stock fell 43 pence to #11.38 (81 cents to $21.52).</p>
<p>Hardy Oil fell 4 pence to 208 pence following Trafalgar
House's placing of its 30% stake in the company. Trafalgar
House firmed a penny to 233 pence.</p>
<p>Other oil stocks remained firm, and one trader said they
were currently sustaining the market. Ultramar gained 4 pence
to 360 pence. Lasmo rose 2 pence to 502 pence.</p>
<p>CRH, an Irish cement and concrete concern, fell 3 pence to
203 pence following interim results showing an 18% rise in
pretax profit. Analysts, however, are wary of the company's
ability to sustain growth.</p>
<p>Sedgwick Group closed down 17 pence at 181 pence. The
company's bearish comments about the outlook for the industry
and its dollar-based earnings overshadowed a 2.3% increase in
pretax profit.</p>
<p>Bowater, which reported a 19% increase in pretax profit
for the half year, fell 15 pence to 488 pence. The company
urged caution over the impact of economic troubles in the
U.K. and U.S. as well as the Kuwait crisis on full-year
earnings.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, shares inched higher in Oslo, but closed
broadly lower in Paris, Frankfurt, Zurich, Brussels,
Amsterdam, Stockholm, Milan and Madrid. European stock
markets were generally depressed by concerns over events in
the Middle East and disheartened by losses in Tokyo and on
Wall Street. South African gold stocks drifted slightly
lower.</p>
<p>Stocks closed lower in Sydney, Hong Kong, Wellington,
Manila, Seoul and Singapore and were higher in Taipei.</p>
<p>Here are price trends on the world's major stock markets,
as calculated by Morgan Stanley Capital International
Perspective, Geneva. To make them directly comparable, each
index is based on the close of 1969 equaling 100. The
percentage change is since year-end.</p>
