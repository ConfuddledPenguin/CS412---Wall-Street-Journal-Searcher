	<p class="article-leader">PITTSBURGH -- Ailing Equimark Corp. suspended its
third-quarter cash dividend on the bank holding company's
common stock. Equimark had paid four cents a share each
quarter since the second quarter of 1988.
   The move will save Equimark $470,000. The company's chief
financial officer, Michael Jehle, said the board voted
against the cash dividend because of Equimark's earnings
decline. The bank had a $45.2 million first-half loss before
one-time gains.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The announcement follows Friday's disclosure that the
Tisch family has acquired a 6.8% stake in Equimark. A
spokesman for the Tisch family company, FLF Associates,
declined to comment on the dividend cutback.</p>
<p>In heavy composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange,
Equimark shares fell 67.5 cents to $5.</p>
<p>Equimark said it will continue to pay the same dividends
on three series of the company's preferred stock.</p>
