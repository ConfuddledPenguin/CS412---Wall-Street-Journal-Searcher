	<p class="article-leader">BETHESDA, Md. -- Medical researchers have linked
osteoarthritis to a genetic defect, a discovery that could
lead to new treatments for a condition that disables millions
of old people.
   Osteoarthritis, a disintegration of the cartilage between
bones, produces pain, stiffness and lack of mobility. The
disease has long been considered an inevitable consequence of
aging. But the new findings, announced at the National
Institutes of Health, suggest that therapies may be able to
stop or slow its progression.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The latest findings emerged from research supported by the
National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin
Diseases, part of the NIH, and the private Arthritis
Foundation. A team of researchers led by Roland Moskowitz,
rheumatologist at Case Western Reserve University in
Cleveland, examined a three-generation family in which
osteoarthritis seemed to be an inherited trait.</p>
<p>Dr. Moskowitz and his team then collaborated with
researchers led by Darwin Prockop, a molecular biologist at
Jefferson Medical College in Philadelphia, to find the
specific genetic mutation that produced weak cartilage.</p>
<p>The researchers were quick to note that the findings don't
mean that all osteoarthritis results from genetic flaws or
that it will be easy to find new therapies for a disease for
which there is currently no cure. The conclusions, announced
yesterday and published in Proceedings of the National
Academy of Sciences, were based primarily on research
involving people in one family, while osteoarthritis afflicts
nearly 16 million Americans.</p>
<p>"We're not making any claims or promises based on this
research" because much more work needs to be done to learn
how broadly osteoarthritis is tied to genetic mutations, said
Lawrence Shulman, director of the National Institute of
Arthritis.</p>
<p>But independent analysts called the work a potential
breakthrough. Paul Katz, chief of the division of
rheumatology, immunology and allergy at the Georgetown
University Medical School, said the research should lead to a
better understanding of "the biochemistry of cartilage
disintegration" that could help researchers "develop
therapies to prevent its progression."</p>
<p>The primary treatments for osteoarthritis today include
rest and anti-inflammatory medicines to control pain. In
addition, many of the 150,000 hip, knee and other joint
replacements performed each year are tied to osteoarthritis.
Any new therapy that slows the progress of osteoarthritis
would greatly improve the quality of life of many older
people and reduce Medicare costs for treating the disease.</p>
<p>In the family they studied, the researchers found a
defective gene for collagen II, a protein the strengthens the
cartilage. Of the more than 1,000 amino acids that construct
collagen II, the faulty gene mistakenly directed the exchange
of an amino acid called cysteine for arginine, the correct
substance. "This one amino acid substitution in collagen II
could wreak havoc on the integrity of the cartilage," Dr.
Prockop said.</p>
<p>The isolation of a mutant gene that triggered
osteoarthritis in one family "gives us a plan for future
research," Dr. Prockop said. The researchers are planning
studies to determine how common the genetic mutation is.</p>
<p>In cases where a mutation is identified as the cause of
osteoarthritis, doctors will have several options they
currently lack. First, they can screen members of families
where the mutation is found. People with the faulty gene then
can be advised to look for jobs and exercise patterns that
minimize stress on their joints. In addition, scientists can
begin to look for drugs and gene therapies that help counter
the adverse effects of mutations.</p>
