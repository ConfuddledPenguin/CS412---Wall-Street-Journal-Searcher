	<p class="article-leader">NEWARK, N.J. -- Leonard Tucker, former part-owner of a
now-defunct penny stock firm, pleaded guilty yesterday to a
federal racketeering charge, the U.S. attorney's office here
said.
   Mr. Tucker was among eight high-level managers of F.D.
Roberts Securities Inc. indicted on racketeering and fraud
charges in March. The other seven, including two brothers of
Mr. Tucker, currently await trial, according to U.S. Attorney
Michael Chertoff. The defendants allegedly netted $67 million
by engineering a stock-manipulation scheme from 1986 to 1988,
Mr. Chertoff said in a statement.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Mr. Tucker faces a maximum of 20 years in prison and fines
in the millions of dollars when he is sentenced by a U.S.
District Court judge.</p>
<p>To date, 25 officers and high-level employees of F.D.
Roberts, which was based in Paramus, N.J., and closed in
February 1989, have pleaded guilty to felony charges.</p>
