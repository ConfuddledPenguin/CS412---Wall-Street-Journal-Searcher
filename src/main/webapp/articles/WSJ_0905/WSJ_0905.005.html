	<p class="article-leader">The full-time homemaker of the '50s gave way to the
superwoman of the '70s. The woman of the '90s, however, is
more difficult to peg.
   Marketers are becoming more aware of the growing
complexity of women's work and home roles, and of the risks
of alienating one group of women by appealing strictly to
another.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>For a deep-pocketed marketer such as American Telephone &
Telegraph, the answer is to pitch different messages to
different segments of the female market. One recent print ad
for AT&T, for example, shows a professional woman chatting on
a cellular phone. Her unlikely setting: the bleachers of her
child's little league game. Another print ad, however, leaves
the child question alone, simply showing a woman with a bag
of groceries. And the telecommunications giant also runs
plenty of homey TV ads that show mom in the kitchen, talking
on the phone. "Our ads should represent the the broad
spectrum of the American public," says a company spokesman.</p>
<p>"The problem is how to reach women when the roles are so
mixed up," says Joel Weiner, formerly senior vice president
of marketing at Kraft General Foods Corp.</p>
<p>Complicating that problem is the tension that exists
between mothers who work and those who stay at home: Many
working mothers feel guilty about leaving their kids all day;
women who stay home feel slighted by society. "You can't talk
to all women in the same way," says Judsen Culbreth, editor
in chief of Working Mother magazine. "By targeting one group,
you can alienate the other."</p>
<p>Few companies are willing to risk alienating working women
to pitch traditional housewives. Some 65% of all mothers
bring home a paycheck these days, including more than 50% of
mothers with children under the age of one, according to the
latest figures available from the Census Bureau. And not
surprisingly, the average yearly income of a two-income
household is some $13,000 higher than than households with a
single breadwinner.</p>
<p>Good Housekeeping magazine thought it had found the key to
the woman of the 1990s with its well-known "new
traditionalist" campaign, created by Jordan, McGrath, Case &
Taylor. All the women in the first three ads -- photographs
of women and their children accompanied by a text exalting
the traditional values of home and family -- stayed home
full-time. One had never worked.</p>
<p>The striking black and white visuals got the attention of
the trade, but the message drew the ire of women nationwide
who resented the implication that professional success was no
longer an appropriate goal. "We got a lot of criticism from
women who thought new traditionalism meant a return to the
kitchen," says Malcolm MacDougall, who created the ads. "We
modified the campaign in order to overcome any possible
misunderstanding."</p>
<p>Nearly every Good Housekeeping ad since the initial flap
has shown a woman who is formally employed. One recent ad
depicts three obstetricians surrounded by their own children.
The text proclaims "They delivered over 300 babies last year.
Yet they still had time to help their kids with homework,
enjoy family vacations, go out with their husbands on
Saturday night." Another ad features a single mother who
makes her living repairing high voltage power lines in the
Blue Ridge Mountains.</p>
<p>Other marketers continue to emphasize mom's role in the
family but put a contemporary twist on it. In a new TV
commercial created for McDonald's by Leo Burnett, a little
girl waits for her mother to return from work on a rainy
night. When the woman -- apparently a single mom -- finally
arrives looking exhausted, the child reminds her of a
promised meal at McDonald's. On the way to the restaurant,
the daughter listens to an account of her mother's trying day
at the office.</p>
<p>McDonald's, like AT&T and others, has a big enough budget
to depict women in a variety of roles. More frequently,
however, advertisers don't have the resources to keep both
camps happy. In those cases, some wary marketers say the
solution is to emphasize what they have in common: stress.
"The bridge between the woman at home with babies and the
woman at the office is that we're all too busy," says Laurel
Cutler, vice chairman of New York advertising agency
FCB/Leber Katz Partners.</p>
<p>A current print ad for American Cyanamid's Pine-Sol
Spruce-Ups (pre-moistened cleaning towels), for example,
shows a woman with a wipe in one hand and cellular phone in
the other. The model is so busy, in fact, she's also in the
process of throwing on a jacket. But is the woman rushing off
to a job or a social engagement? Her clothes don't give a
clue.</p>
<p>"It's a convenience product and in our minds, we're
thinking of working women," says Barry Kesten, product
manager for Spruce-Ups. "But it could be the middle of the
day, and she could be on her way to meet friends. We tried to
keep it neutral." (American Cyanamid recently agreed to sell
Pine-Sol to Clorox.)</p>
<p>A recent campaign done for Borden's Creamette brand of
pasta by Grey Advertising shows a woman walking into the
kitchen just as her husband and kids are about to pop the
pasta into boiling water. One assumes the woman is returning
from work, but the details are left intentionally vague.
"What we've tried to do is identify strategies for coping,"
says Barbara Feigin, Grey's director of research. "The ad
says, `We get what your life is like.'"</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>New Pontiac Campaign</p>
<p>General Motors Corp.'s Pontiac division plans to launch a
revised ad campaign and pricing structure for its 1991
models.</p>
<p>The campaign, slated to start later this month, has the
theme "Don't settle for less than the ride of your life on
the Pontiac Express," and is targeted at buyers age 35 and
younger. The campaign was created by D'Arcy Masius Benton &
Bowles.</p>
<p>Dwight Logie, Pontiac's assistant general sales manager in
charge of marketing, said 80% of the division's advertising
budget will focus on its core products: the Grand Am, Grand
Prix, Sunbird and Trans Sport minivan. The division's model
lineup remains much the same as last year. The ads are meant
to appeal to "nonconformists."</p>
<p>Pontiac also plans to shift money into discounting option
packages from cash rebates. "The focus option packages allow
us to put incentive money where it's right on the sticker,
and it doesn't go up and down from month to month," said John
Middlebrook, Pontiac's general manager.</p>
<p>Pontiac also will offer the looks of its higher-priced
models as a separate option to buyers of lower-priced
versions of the same car. Thus, the buyer of a $17,000 1991
Grand Prix can pay $2,600 extra for an "aero performance
package" to make that version look like a Grand Prix costing
$26,000, a Pontiac spokesman said. Pontiac officials
acknowledge the risk that consumers may be less willing to
buy the higher-priced version.</p>
