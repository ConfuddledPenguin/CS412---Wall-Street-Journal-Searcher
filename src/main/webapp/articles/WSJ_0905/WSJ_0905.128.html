	<p class="article-leader">PORTLAND, Ore. -- Standard & Poor's Corp. raised its
ratings on about $4.7 billion of PacifiCorp debt and
preferred stock, in the wake of the utility holding company's
decision to end its 10-month pursuit of Arizona Public
Service Co. and its parent, Pinnacle West Capital Corp., both
based in Phoenix, Ariz.
   PacifiCorp dropped its takeover efforts in exchange for
seasonal power swaps with Arizona Public Service having a
combined potential value of about $260 million.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The rating concern upgraded PacifiCorp's senior secured
debt to single-A from single-A-minus, and senior unsecured
debt and preferred stock to single-A-minus from
triple-B-plus.</p>
<p>S&P also revised to stable from negative its long-term
outlook for the debt and preferred stock of Arizona Public
Service. "Much-needed up-front cash" from the PacifiCorp deal
"would allow Pinnacle to pay down its huge debt burden more
rapidly and aid in restoring its common dividend over time,"
the rating concern said.</p>
<p>Pinnacle West shares tumbled $3.75 to close at $12.375 in
New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday. It was
the most active issue on the Big Board, on turnover of more
than 1.9 million shares. PacifiCorp shares closed at $19.875,
up 50 cents, in Big Board trading.</p>
