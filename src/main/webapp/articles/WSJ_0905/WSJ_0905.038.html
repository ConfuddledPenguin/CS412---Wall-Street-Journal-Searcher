	<p class="article-leader">A BRUSHOFF IN BRUSSELS</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>A delegation representing small and medium-sized British
enterprises paid a visit to the European Community Commission
in Brussels yesterday to plead for mercy under the EC's
Social Action Program, but all they got was a polite brushoff
from Vasso Papandreou, the EC commissioner in charge of labor
policy.</p>
<p>The British entrepreneurs said they are worried because
planned EC-wide labor legislation would mean sharply higher
operating costs and drive many out of business. The
legislation is intended to form the basis for common minimum
EC labor standards.</p>
<p>The officials, who said they represented 750,000 small and
medium-sized firms, said proposed rules on working hours and
part-time and temporary workers would cost "thousands of
jobs."</p>
<p>According to an EC spokesman, Ms. Papandreou rebuffed the
delegation's call for a special EC study of the impact on
small and medium-sized enterprises. "In short," the spokesman
said, "it's nyet."</p>
<p>MESSAGE FROM THE WORLD'S POOR</p>
<p>Speakers at a United Nations conference in Paris on the
world's 41 least-developed countries voiced concern that the
Persian Gulf crisis would cut the "dividends of peace"
emerging from detente between the superpowers. Delegate after
delegate at the conference painted a grim picture of their
countries' continuing slide into misery since the first U.N.
conference on the least-developed countries nine years ago.
Ugandan President Yoweru Museveni, current chairman of the
Organization of African Unity, called the 1980s "an
unrelenting economic nightmare" for the poorest countries.</p>
<p>ORDER FOR ISRAELI JOURNALISTS</p>
<p>Arye Mekel, director of the Israel Broadcasting Authority,
ordered journalists for Israel's state-run radio and
television to avoid Arabic names for Arab areas of Israel and
the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip. "We came to the land
of Israel and not to Palestine so I asked that these places
be called by their Hebrew, biblical names," said IBA
assistant chairman Shlomo Kor, who proposed the change. The
new policy met with criticism from journalists.</p>
<p>CLEANING UP THE BALTIC</p>
<p>Leaders of the seven nations on the Baltic Sea have agreed
to curb the pollution that has killed a third of life on the
sea bed. But the Eastern Europeans said they would need
Western aid for the effort. The agreement, which came at the
conclusion of a two-day conference in Sweden, called for a
cleanup plan to be prepared by the end of next year.
Scientific studies have shown that the Baltic is losing more
and more oxygen as phosphates and nitrates flood the sea.</p>
<p>PAY RAISES IN EAST GERMANY</p>
<p>Garbage collectors, bus drivers, nurses and teachers in
East Germany will receive an immediate increase of 200 marks
($127) in their monthly pay, according to an agreement
hammered out yesterday by a union representing 1.7 million
East German public servants. For teachers, the raise amounts
to about 25%. On top of the 200-mark pay raise, employees
will also receive a 50-mark monthly bonus for each child,
retroactive to July 1.</p>
<p>LIECHTENSTEIN LEGISLATION</p>
<p>Liechtenstein said draft legislation that would make
insider trading a crime is being discussed. The principality,
which has no stock market of its own, intends its legislation
as a judicial means of aiding in international cases.
Liechtenstein and neighboring Switzerland are linked by a
monetary and currency pact, and there has been concern in
Switzerland that Liechtenstein could be misused for dubious
financial transactions that could reflect badly on
Switzerland.</p>
<p>A BAN IN SOUTH AFRICA</p>
<p>Skin-lightening cosmetics, blamed by doctors in South
Africa for disfiguring thousands of black women, have been
banned by South African authorities.</p>
<p>The government has abruptly brought forward a ban,
originally set for January, on cosmetics containing
hydroquinone -- the key ingredient in creams used by blacks,
especially women, who want a lighter skin.</p>
<p>"We are ecstatic," said Mary Ann Sher, chairman of the
Dermatological Society. Dr. Sher said hydroquinone, which is
also used in dyes and paints, causes ochronosis -- permanent
ugly dark patches on the face and, in serious cases, grainy
black lumps under the skin.</p>
<p>While all cosmetics containing hydroquinone are banned,
the substance will still be available in products that are
registered as medicines, such as medicinal creams used by
dermatologists to treat fair-skinned people with birthmarks.</p>
<p>POSTSCRIPTS . . .</p>
<p>Australian Prime Minister Bob Hawke and eight bodyguards
slept undisturbed as burglars smashed the glass doors of
their hotel in Port Moresby, Papua New Guinea, and made off
with the equivalent of $100, the hotel manager said. Because
of the country's crime problem, Mr. Hawke took double his
usual number of bodyguards on his visit to Papua New Guinea,
an Australian government spokesman said. . . . In Australia,
Stephen Hawke, the prime minister's 31-year-old son, won his
country's most prestigious nonfiction award for a book about
an Aboriginal community's vain fight to prevent mining on
ancestral land.</p>
