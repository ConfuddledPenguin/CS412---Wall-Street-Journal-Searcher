	<p class="article-leader">MGM Grand Air said it signed a letter of proposal to buy
two Boeing 757-200s for more than $100 million as part of a
long-term plan to expand the small luxury airline.
   Charles L. Demoney, president and chief executive officer
of the Los Angeles-based airline, said the long-range
aircraft from Boeing Co. are scheduled to be delivered in the
mid-1990s. MGM Grand Air, a unit of MGM Grand Inc., is
controlled by investor Kirk Kerkorian.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>MGM Grand offers two daily flights between Los Angeles and
New York. Eventually, MGM Grand hopes to use the quieter and
more fuel-efficient 757s for international service to the
United Kingdom and the Pacific Rim.</p>
<p>Last month, MGM Grand began offering an upgraded service
for standard coach-class fare on its newly configured DC-8
Super 62 aircraft. Those planes, which cost $55.5 million to
refurbish, seat 81 passengers and replaced an older fleet of
Boeing 727-100s that MGM Grand used to launch the airline in
1987.</p>
<p>Currently, Mr. Demoney said, the airline's load factor is
less than 40% using the DC-8s, compared with 75% for the
smaller, all-first-class 727-200s. The new Boeing 757s
probably will seat about 80 passengers.</p>
