	<p class="article-leader">PANMUNJOM, South Korea -- The North Korean prime minister
and his delegation crossed the border into South Korea for
the first time and encountered the same problems other
visitors to bustling Seoul face: jostling by crowds, a
traffic accident and restricted access to imported goods.
   But the fact that Premier Yon Hyong Muk and his party of
80 or so aides and journalists made it at all is considered a
major step toward normalizing relations between the divided
Koreas. It was the first exchange between the two countries
in five years and is the highest-level contact the two
governments have ever had.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Nevertheless, analysts don't see a German-style
reunification in Korea any time soon. In fact, the meetings
of the government had all the trappings of a shotgun wedding:
the North Koreans, forced to embrace the South by its allies
in Moscow, and the South, wary, hoping for the best but
resigned to the belief that the future is unpromising. "Even
if there are no specific agreements to come out of these
talks, we hope that they will put our abnormal relations on a
normal track," is the best that South Korean Unification
Minister Hong Sung Chul could offer.</p>
<p>This week's meetings are meant to build mutual confidence,
and perhaps lead to troop reductions, United Nations
membership and greater economic cooperation. But the
antagonism was clear from the moment the smiling North Korean
government spokesman, Ahn Pyong Su, spoke in the truce
village of Panmunjom.</p>
<p>He alluded to subjects that irritate the South Korean
government: to the concrete barricades that block part of the
border and to Im Su Kyong, the college student serving seven
years in prison for unauthorized travel to North Korea. She
is a heroine in North Korea and among radical South Korean
students. Later, the North Korean government went even
further, suggesting that it might want to meet with Miss Im.
The South views this as impossible.</p>
<p>There were other rough spots. On the trip to the
Intercontinental Hotel, where the North Korean premier and
his retinue are staying, a car in the motorcade slammed into
another vehicle as an impatient South Korean driver cut
through. One delegate suffered a minor mouth cut, another
complained of back pains, but no one was hospitalized. One
car caught fire and the windshield on another was broken.</p>
<p>The premier was almost crushed by the jam of photographers
who tried to get pictures of him accepting a bouquet from a
small Korean girl in native garb. He refused the flowers and
the hapless child was jostled, but uninjured, in the melee.</p>
<p>The North Korean delegation showed little curiosity about
Seoul. They stayed in their rooms atop the skyscraper hotel
all afternoon. The premier's three-bedroom suite goes for
$1,500 a night.</p>
<p>Not wishing to offend the straight-laced North Koreans,
the hotel staff removed all the Coca-Cola, Del Monte fruit
juice and other foreign products from the room, even foreign
fresh fruit, such as pineapple. It also shut off the Japanese
television shows received via satellite, although it couldn't
shut off the American TV programs that are broadcast by the
U.S. Army stationed in South Korea. The North Koreans were
left with two closed-circuit television movie choices:
"Avenging Force," about an ex-CIA agent who seeks the
murderer of his best friend, or "Thunder Alley," about a farm
boy who makes it big in rock'n' roll and lives in the fast
lane.</p>
<p>The rooms do provide vistas of much of the city and, not
by accident, the new government offices of the Soviet Union,
once North Korea's staunchest ally. But so far the delegates
have seen no demonstrations by either radical students or the
anti-Communist groups. Security at the hotel was unobtrusive.</p>
<p>Official meetings begin today. The North Korean premier,
who holds no real power, will also meet with South Korean
President Roh Tae Woo. The biggest measure of success will be
firm agreement for the two sides to meet again in October in
the North Korean capital of Pyongyang.</p>
<p>Analysts note that the North Koreans have little to gain
by further contacts, which could hasten unrest in a country
that has been kept under control by strict isolation. The
South's policy is to increase pressure on the North to open
up to the outside, for which it recently enlisted the help of
the Soviet Union, still the North's biggest benefactor.
Diplomats here say that Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard
Shevardnadze's meetings in Pyongyang Sunday and Monday were
part of the pressure on the North to attend the meeting.</p>
