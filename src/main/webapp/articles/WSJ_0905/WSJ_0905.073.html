	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- It seems that just about everybody is mad at
the cable industry these days. For composers trying to get
paid when their music is heard on cable television,
irritation has escalated into a war with some of cable's
biggest powers.
   If the composers win, cable companies will have to pay
millions more for the music used in their programs. Those
increases could well be passed on in subscriber charges,
leaving consumers singing the blues as well.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The battle is tangled and extensive, with at least half a
dozen suits and countersuits already filed between the groups
that collect fees for composers and various cable companies.
A judge is scheduled today to issue a ruling in one of the
cases that could hamper cable powerhouse HBO's ability to
operate.</p>
<p>The critical issue isn't just how much the societies want
to charge cable for music rights -- a lot more -- but whom
they charge. Observing that the biggest share of money in
cable flows from subscribers to local cable franchises, the
composer groups want to charge performance fees to local
operators in addition to the cable channels. The cable
industry is fighting that plan on every possible front.</p>
<p>Now, the average guy watching a movie in his living room
may only notice the sound track in passing. But someone has
to make sure that John Williams gets paid when "Indiana Jones
and the Last Crusade" is shown on HBO. In that case, the
someone is Broadcast Music Inc., known as BMI, which
represents some 100,000 composers and publishers, from the
estate of Charles Ives to Michael Jackson. The other major
performing-rights society, Ascap, the American Society of
Composers, Authors and Publishers, monitors performances for
its 45,000 members.</p>
<p>Both BMI and Ascap have been collecting money for years
from bars, skating rinks, and radio and television networks,
with each new field they enter sparking a major battle. These
days the two are even going after shopping malls and
convention planners for music fees, but cable television is a
much vaster new territory. "Composers can't collect these
fees themselves, and it's our responsibility to protect them
as new technologies arise," says Frances Preston, BMI's
president.</p>
<p>Although cable giant Home Box Office Inc., a unit of Time
Warner Inc., has paid for music rights for more than a
decade, many cable channels don't have licenses.</p>
<p>Those that do pay relatively modest rates that reflect
cable's fledgling status when BMI and Ascap started charging
the industry a decade ago.</p>
<p>"Cable has mushroomed into a giant industry, but it seems
like the cable people are saying: `We paid you a pittance
before, and that's all we want to pay,'" says Richard
Sherman, a Los Angeles composer whose movie scores include
"Mary Poppins" and "The Jungle Book." "I think it's bloody
ridiculous. The upfront money for most composers is modest:
Performance fees are our lifeblood."</p>
<p>Currently, an average HBO subscriber pays between $100 and
$125 a year to watch the channel: From that, HBO's fee
amounts to about 27 cents per subscriber to BMI and Ascap
combined to cover a year's worth of music performances.</p>
<p>Still, HBO contends that if BMI gets the rate increase it
wants, the group's revenue from cable will leap to $130
million a year from about $10 million now. That would be well
above the $75 million to $100 million BMI takes in from all
TV broadcasters, both the networks and local stations. BMI
calls HBO's estimates "distorted" and says they are based on
figures meant to be a starting point for negotiation.</p>
<p>At the moment, the lawsuit generating the most fireworks
is one between BMI and HBO. This will probably be the test
case for whether BMI and Ascap can legally charge local cable
operators separately, in so-called split licenses.</p>
<p>BMI sued HBO in December in U.S. District Court in New
York as HBO's license was about to expire and the two parties
couldn't agree on a higher fee. One reason HBO refused to
sign is that it disputes the legality of split licenses,
which were demanded by BMI. Under a split license, HBO would
be buying performance rights for the programs only until they
are transmitted to the local operator, not all the way
through to the home viewer -- which HBO says would put it at
a competitive disadvantage to cable channels without split
licenses.</p>
<p>Wanting to use the case to prove it is legal to charge
operators separately, BMI pulled Manhattan Cable Television
Inc., a local operator and a unit of Time Warner, HBO's
parent, into the same suit as a defendant several months
later.</p>
<p>To bring the issue to a head faster, BMI asked for an
injunction to prevent HBO from airing any programs containing
music by BMI composers: Since its license expired, HBO has
continued to run such programs without paying fees. The
ruling expected today is on the injunction.</p>
<p>If Judge John Sprizzo grants BMI an immediate injunction,
its effect on HBO will be drastic. John Redpath Jr., general
counsel for HBO, says that at least half of HBO's September
schedule, about 80 movies, contains music by BMI composers. A
ban would affect movies from "Lawrence of Arabia" to
"Batman," says Mr. Redpath, and make it more or less
impossible for HBO to operate. He says HBO would appeal an
injunction.</p>
<p>Eventually, perhaps even today, Judge Sprizzo will have to
address the underlying issue of the split license.</p>
<p>HBO and Manhattan Cable maintain that BMI's demand for
separate licenses for cable channels and local operators
violates antitrust laws. The reason: the logistics involved
dictate only one type of license for local operators, making
it a monopolistic practice. Anybody who gets a license from
BMI or Ascap can choose to get a so-called blanket license, a
flat fee covering all BMI composers; or they can
theoretically negotiate separate licenses for different
programs, composers or songs, in some cases directly with
producers.</p>
<p>But for a cable operator, which simultaneously carries 30
or 50 different channels, "it is impossible to negotiate
licenses for each program on each channel separately," says
Mr. Redpath, the HBO attorney. Manhattan Cable, for one, says
it airs about 480 programs in a day. "Split licensing,
because it forces an operator to take a blanket license, is
illegal," says Mr. Redpath.</p>
<p>The contention that split licenses violate antitrust laws
has been backed up by 27 state attorneys general, who filed a
"friend of the court brief" in June.</p>
<p>BMI lawyers say HBO and Manhattan Cable haven't proved in
court hearings that operators can't negotiate individual
licenses. "The copyright law says that whoever engages in a
public performance of music is supposed to pay for it," says
Robert Sisk, an attorney representing BMI. "Other court cases
have established that the transmission of a program to the
viewer from local cable operators is a separate performance.
Therefore, the operator has a responsibility to get a
license."</p>
<p>Furthermore, "BMI believes the blanket license is the most
efficient, least costly method of obtaining performance
rights," Mr Sisk says. "This fight is over the fact that HBO
doesn't want to pay a little more for it."</p>
<p>Ascap is also fighting to make cable operators pay
separately. But rather than sue them, Ascap is going through
a procedure set up in the '50s under a consent decree. All
Ascap rate disputes are settled by a judge in New York's
Southern District, who heard the arguments on the split
license more than a year ago but hasn't ruled yet. That judge
could well be influenced by Judge Sprizzo's decision. (One
goal of the cable industry is a similar arena for rate
disputes for BMI.)</p>
<p>The cable industry filed a lawsuit in federal district
court in Washington in which two associations of cable
operators, the National Cable Television Association and the
Community Antenna Television Association, joined with the
Disney Channel and Black Entertainment Television to sue BMI.
The suit charges BMI with "unlawful price-fixing activities."
Hearings are scheduled for January.</p>
<p>If both sides dig in their heels, the lawsuits between
BMI, Ascap and the cable industry may rage on for years. A
suit filed by CBS against both societies in 1969 dragged on
for over a decade; Ultimately, the Supreme Court said blanket
licenses can be legal in some circumstances.</p>
<p>David Grossberg, an attorney who represents composers,
believes BMI and HBO are likely to reach a settlement. He
adds, "I'd also predict that, no matter what happens, the
cable industry will pay more than they're paying now."</p>
