	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- A former PaineWebber Inc. broker agreed to be
barred from the securities industry for what the National
Association of Securities Dealers alleged was excessive and
unsuitable trading in two customer accounts.
   The New York broker, Nilda Rubiera Zim, didn't admit or
deny any wrongdoing in the matter. She also consented to a
$125,000 fine.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The NASD, the self-regulatory agency for the
over-the-counter markets, also fined the securities firm
$30,000 jointly with Joseph Patrick Tota, who managed the
branch at which Ms. Zim worked.</p>
<p>Mr. Tota, currently national sales manager at the
PaineWebber Inc. unit of PaineWebber Group Inc., also was
suspended for five days as a principal. The firm and Mr. Tota
neither admitted nor denied the NASD's charges.</p>
<p>The firm, Ms. Zim and Mr. Tota couldn't immediately be
reached for comment.</p>
<p>The NASD charged that in March 1985, a customer opened a
PaineWebber account with $190,000 of cash and stock. In the
year that followed, the agency said, Ms. Zim's trades for
that customer generated gross commissions of $203,165 and a
loss of $11,016. Further, the agency charged that Ms. Zim
executed transactions at a rate amounting to the sale of
every security in the account about every 2 1/2 weeks.</p>
<p>In another case, the NASD said, Ms. Zim handled an
account, opened in June 1985, with $100,000 of U.S. Treasury
securities and $32,000 of certain units. Over the next 26
months, the NASD alleged, the account generated commissions
of $98,218 and a loss of $113,806. (In October 1986, Ms. Zim
left PaineWebber and joined Prudential-Bache Securities Inc.,
and this account was transferred to that firm.
Prudential-Bache, a unit of Prudential Insurance Co. of
America, wasn't charged in the matter.)</p>
<p>In both cases, the NASD said, PaineWebber and Mr. Tota
failed to properly supervise Ms. Zim.</p>
