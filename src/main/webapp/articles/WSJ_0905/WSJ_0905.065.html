	<p class="article-leader">From "First Strike," a book about the 1981 Israeli attack
on Iraq's nuclear reactor by Shlomo Nakdimon (Summit, 1987):</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>On January 26, 1976, France was the sole Western country
to support an anti-Israel resolution presented to the UN
Security Council . . . Forty-eight hours later, Premier
Chirac arrived in Iraq . . . for a close inspection of the
site picked for the French nuclear complex. . . . {He} issued
specific directives to remove any administrative obstacle
hindering the swift and flawless implementation of the
contract. . . .</p>
<p>On March 20, 1980, a London newspaper reported: "Next
year, Iraq will be capable of manufacturing a nuclear bomb --
with the assistance of France and Italy. . . ." {Two days
before} an official {Iraqi} spokesman bitterly attacked the
American "campaign against Iraqi-French and Iraqi-Italian
technological cooperation in the field of nuclear energy." .
. . In another statement, the Iraqi Foreign Ministry
affirmed: "Removal of Zionism from Palestine is a
precondition for the constitution of a nonracist
international community." . . . "We want the whole of
Palestine," declared Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz on
March 24. "We recognize neither the 1967 borders nor the 1948
partition borders."</p>
