	<p class="article-leader">Boris Yeltsin's supporters in Russia are calling the new
economic plan that he has shepherded onto the Soviet agenda a
major victory. Power, they assert, is devolving away from the
center and toward the republics.
   The program is called the Shatalin plan, after the
principal economic adviser to Mikhail Gorbachev, who
apparently has given his tacit approval to the proposal while
seeking some way to save face for his prime minister, Nikolai
Ryzhkov. Mr. Ryzhkov has clung to the notion that the Kremlin
should retain major control over the direction of the
economy.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Quite possibly, Mr. Gorbachev felt compelled to yield
ground to restore some order to a system in crisis. Bread has
suddenly disappeared from Moscow, despite a record grain
harvest this year of perhaps 260 million tons. The
all-too-familiar problems of equipment and distribution
breakdowns are cited as culprits. Bread rationing had shown
up in outlying areas weeks ago.</p>
<p>The Gorbachev government had problems enough even before
the volatile issue of empty bread shelves hit Moscow. The
republics are demanding control of economic policy and state
properties. Mr. Yeltsin's Russian Federation, for example,
recently declared itself owner of all of Russia's natural
resources. Mr. Yeltsin has threatened to start printing his
own ruble. Mr. Gorbachev has tried to blunt such efforts, but
to little avail. The resulting disputes have contributed to
the Soviet Union's worsening case of economic paralysis.</p>
<p>Mr. Yeltsin's backers believe the new plan marks the end
of central planning. The republics, they claim, now will make
major economic policy decisions on matters ranging from
privatization of industry and property to creating stock
markets. Ukraine will regulate its own agriculture and
Uzbekistan its gold mines, in theory. Gosplan, the
stultifying planning bureaucracy, will become redundant.</p>
<p>If all this is true, it would indeed mean that Mr.
Gorbachev has given up on his efforts to conduct economic
reform from the Kremlin. The reform package his government
brought forth last spring -- a product of many vying factions
-- apparently has collapsed under its own contradictions. Mr.
Gorbachev and most certainly the Communist Party he heads are
losing favor with the people, who are turning to local and
republic-level leaders in hopes that they can relieve
shortages and prevent a breakdown in civil order.</p>
<p>Perhaps Mr. Gorbachev thinks the deal with Mr. Yeltsin
will buy him time. By ceding economic independence, he may
hope to preserve political union. Presumably he thinks that
the Baltic States, Georgia, Ukraine, Armenia and the others
will focus on economic policy and not wrest away additional
powers, such as the right to raise their own armies, or to
make their own foreign policy.</p>
<p>This may be a forlorn hope. Economic autonomy, if that is
what is afoot, is a big step toward political autonomy. All
over the Soviet Union, political muscles are being flexed:</p>
<p>The Armenian government recently declared two Soviet
presidential decrees invalid, one of which ordered Armenian
nationalist troops disarmed. Five Baltic states are sending
their own delegates to a global environmental congress in
Sweden, independent of Moscow. The Ukrainian and Lithuanian
governments are among those drawing up laws to set up their
own military.</p>
<p>In the Georgian city of Tbilisi, more than 100,000
Georgians have renounced their Soviet citizenship, though
independently issued Georgian passports have been
confiscated.</p>
<p>Quite possibly, Mr. Gorbachev has acknowledged the shift
toward republican independence because he feels he cannot
master it. Short of a Unionwide military crackdown, an
extremely problematical undertaking, he has lost the ability
to control events. Control is increasingly in the republics
or in the streets. Every day it seems more likely that the
nation will break apart. If that happens, the West had better
fasten its safety belts.</p>
<p>At the opening yesterday in Moscow of the party congress
of the Russian republic, a worker called for "returning the
nation to 1985." This, of course, was the year the country's
leadership fell to Mikhail Gorbachev, who sat stonily on the
platform listening to this and other attacks. The Mikhail
Gorbachev who meets with President Bush in Helsinki this
weekend is a man sitting atop a large and terribly unsettled
nation. While he may appreciate the chance to exchange views
on various foreign matters with the American President, Mr.
Gorbachev clearly has more than enough to handle in the 15
Soviet republics.</p>
