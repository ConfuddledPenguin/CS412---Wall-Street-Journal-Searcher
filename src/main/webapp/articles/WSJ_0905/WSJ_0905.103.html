	<p class="article-leader">SUNWEST FINANCIAL SERVICES Inc. slashed its quarterly to
12 cents a share from 28 cents but said it expects to report
a profit for the year. Sunwest, based in Albuquerque, N.M.,
which had a $7.6 million loss in the first half, including
$3.3 million in expenses associated with its voluntary
retirement program and $32.6 million in loan-loss provisions,
said earnings improved in the first two months of the third
quarter. In July and August, the bank holding company had net
income of over $3.1 million, due to a reduction in the
loan-loss provision and better controls on non-interest
expenses. The rise in non-performing assets has "stabilized,"
a spokesman said, even though the state's real estate woes
haven't improved. The July and August earnings trend is
expected to continue and result in positive earnings for the
year an official said. The dividend is payable Oct. 1 to
stock of record Oct. 1.</p>
