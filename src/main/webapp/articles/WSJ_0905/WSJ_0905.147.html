	<p class="article-leader">TOKYO -- Fujitsu Ltd., facing competitive challenges in
its home market from International Business Machines Corp.
and Hitachi Ltd., announced a new generation of mainframe
computers that could pack greater power than the long-awaited
line that IBM is expected to unveil today.
   Officials at Japan's giant computer maker claimed the
series includes "the highest performance general purpose
computer in the world" and triples the muscle of its current
high-end model. IBM is expected to announce a doubling of
performance with its new line. According to Fujitsu, its top
machine currently matches IBM's.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Fujitsu also said its new model is 10% more powerful than
the comparable version of Hitachi's new line announced in
June.</p>
<p>Fujitsu is hoping the new machine, along with an
apparently aggressive price schedule, will shore up its
crumbling domestic base, where it gets the vast majority of
its sales. Both Hitachi and IBM have been making sharp
inroads in Japan in the past few years, and some analysts
think IBM may have passed Fujitsu in the high end of the
Japanese market.</p>
<p>It is impossible yet to make independent comparisons
between the new mainframes, as the company refused to
disclose details. Also, Fujitsu's speediest machines won't be
available for more than a year; so while IBM may not disclose
a comparable model today, it could have one available at the
same time Fujitsu does.</p>
<p>If nothing else, the announcement, coming on the eve of
IBM's, marks an effort by Fujitsu to steal the spotlight from
a rival. "It's enough to keep them in the game, but there
aren't enough details available to evaluate" the effect on
sales, said Michael Jeremy, an analyst with Baring Securities
(Japan) Ltd.</p>
<p>The computer companies' announcements come at a fluid
period in the mainframe market, as IBM is struggling to stem
the steady erosion in its world-wide market share. Today's
announcement will unveil Big Blue's first new mainframe
generation in five years, and will be its most closely
scrutinized machine in a decade.</p>
<p>Fujitsu scored a major coup in July in its long-running
bid to catch IBM when it announced the purchase of 80% of
International Computers Ltd., Britain's largest mainframe
maker. That move made Fujitsu the second-largest computer
company in the world. Fujitsu officials refused to comment on
whether they will sell their new machines, called M-1800,
through ICL.</p>
<p>Fujitsu sells few machines directly in the U.S., but it
owns 43.64% of Amdahl Corp., which uses Fujitsu's basic
technology. Amdahl currently holds 10% of the world-wide
IBM-compatible mainframe market, and Gartner Group Inc., a
market research and consulting firm, predicts that the
company's share will rise to 13% by next year, in part
because of new Fujitsu technology.</p>
<p>Fujitsu said it expects to sell 300 of the new systems
world-wide over the next three years. It will begin delivery
of the two simplest models next April, and follow with the
three faster machines in the third quarter of 1991. An Amdahl
spokesman said the U.S. company won't sell a version of the
new Fujitsu machine, although Amdahl plans to announce a new
mainframe of its own shortly.</p>
<p>In addition to claiming leadership in overall power,
Fujitsu is the first maker to announce a model that will lash
together as many as eight processors. The company said that
users will be able to link a total of 16 processors in its
architecture. Analysts say IBM and Hitachi may also have that
capability, although neither has said so, and IBM isn't
expected to make such an announcement today.</p>
<p>Even parity, however, could provide another edge for
Fujitsu. IBM has in recent years had processors that were
individually slower than the Japanese, but made up the
difference by cramming more processors in each machine.
Currently, Fujitsu says its four-processor model has roughly
the same performance of IBM's six-processor version.</p>
