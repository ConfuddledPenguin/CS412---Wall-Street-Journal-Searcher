	<p class="article-leader">AmBase Corp. said it agreed to sell Commonwealth Insurance
Co., a Vancouver unit of its Home Insurance Co. subsidiary,
to Fairfax Financial Holdings Ltd., Toronto, for $49 million.
   An AmBase spokesman said the sale would have no impact on
previously announced agreements to sell Home Insurance or a
controlling interest in the company because Home Insurance
would retain proceeds from the Commonwealth sale.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>AmBase, New York, agreed to sell a 50.1% stake in the
company to an investor group a week after reaching a separate
agreement to sell Home Insurance to Vik Brothers
International. AmBase said it would proceed with both offers
until a definitive agreement is reached with one or the
other. Neither investment group could be reached yesterday.</p>
<p>AmBase said Commonwealth, which has about 120 employees,
offers commercial property and oil and gas insurance in
Canada, the U.S. and overseas.</p>
<p>Separately, Markel Corp. reached a tentative agreement
under which it would acquire Fairfax's 47.5% stake in F-M
Acquisition Corp. for $45 million cash, plus securities that
Fairfax valued at about $23 million. Markel, a Richmond, Va.,
insurance marketing concern, already owns about 42.5% of
closely held F-M Acquisition, a specialty insurer in
Evanston, Ill.</p>
<p>The securities Markel would swap for F-M include about
850,000 subordinate voting shares, and 800,000 multiple
voting shares, of Fairfax. The shares, which Fairfax values
at about $16 million, account for about 23% of Fairfax's
equity and a 31% voting interest.</p>
<p>The tentative agreement also calls for Markel to transfer
$7 million of preferred shares of Lindsey & Newsom Claim
Services Inc., to Fairfax and transfer its 50% stake in
Lindsey & Newsom to Morden & Helwig Group Inc. for $8.3
million. Morden & Helwig is a Toronto-based claims-management
concern 55% owned by Fairfax. Lindsey & Newsom is a Tyler,
Texas, claims adjuster that already is 50%-held by Morden &
Helwig.</p>
<p>The transactions are subject to a number of conditions,
Fairfax said.</p>
