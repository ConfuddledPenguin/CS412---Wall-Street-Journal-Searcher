	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Remember Memories? It's history.
   After months of trying to sell the nostalgia news
magazine, Diamandis Communications Inc., a unit of French
publisher Hachette S.A., said it will cease regular
publication with the October issue of Memories.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The announcement follows weeks of last-ditch efforts to
save the magazine, and a decision by Mortimer Zuckerman,
chairman of U.S. News & World Report and The Atlantic
magazines, to withdraw from negotiations to buy Memories. Mr.
Zuckerman cited a dismal forecast for magazine advertising,
and Hachette said it decided not to wait for other bidders to
emerge.</p>
<p>Didier Guerin, president of the U.S. unit of Hachette,
blamed Memories's demise on a weak economy and reduced
advertising budgets. "It became clear the potential
profitability of Memories was being pushed years down the
road," he said. "We weren't prepared to suffer all those
losses."</p>
<p>Mr. Guerin said closing Memories will slightly ease
Hachette's debt burden from its $712 million purchase of
Diamandis. "Not carrying Memories slightly improves the cash
flow," he said. In May, Hachette put Woman's Day magazine up
for sale to relieve debt. Bidders fell short of the estimated
$175 million to $200 million that Hachette sought, and the
women's magazine was pulled off the market.</p>
<p>Peter Diamandis, president of DCI and founder of Memories,
said the magazine will publish two special issues each year
and that the magazine could be brought back to life "should
the advertising climate improve." Plans for a syndicated TV
show based on Memories are unaffected, DCI executives said.
The first installment of the half-hour news-nostalgia show is
scheduled to air Sept. 15 on NBC. An NBC spokeswoman said the
network is still "excited" about the weekly show.</p>
<p>The closure of Memories indicates that even seemingly
thriving magazines are at risk in the current bleak
advertising climate. Memories was named "Best New Magazine"
in 1989 by Advertising Age. A little more than two years old,
it grew to an 800,000 circulation rate base, and its ad pages
were expected to double to 325 in 1990. Its last issue, in
October, was to be its first as a monthly; it had been
published bimonthly.</p>
<p>"We are very disappointed," said Gregory Coleman,
publisher of Memories. Mr. Coleman himself had attempted to
find an outside partner, ideally another large magazine
publisher, to acquire the magazine. "We had a great concept
and things were growing."</p>
<p>But Mr. Zuckerman was the most realistic suitor. According
to insiders at DCI, Mr. Zuckerman offered to cover the costs
of publishing the October issue, staff salaries, and other
expenses, if Hachette kept the magazine open for two more
weeks, while he worked out financial arrangements. In the
end, Mr. Zuckerman backed out. "It's too tough in this
economy to take on a magazine that doesn't have an automatic
advertising base," he said.</p>
<p>Hachette's Mr. Guerin said he gave Mr. Zuckerman more than
enough time and information to make a decision. "If we waited
more we would have incurred more losses." Mr. Guerin added,
"if it weren't for Zuckerman, we would have closed Memories
weeks ago."</p>
