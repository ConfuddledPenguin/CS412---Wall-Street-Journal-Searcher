	<p class="article-leader">Ford Motor Co. said it is offering four-year "bumber to
bumper" warranty coverage with no deductible on its 1991
Lincoln models, a move that parallels a similar step by
General Motors Corp.'s Cadillac division.
   Ford, based in Dearborn, Mich., also said it is shortening
the "power-train" coverage on its Ford and Mercury badge
cars, but also reducing the deductible amount that customers
must pay.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The new policy for the luxury Lincoln line guarantees
customers coverage on virtually all repairs -- except normal
wear such as windshield wiper blades and brake pads -- for
four years or 50,000 miles.</p>
<p>Previously, Lincoln cars had a 12 month, 12,000 mile basic
warranty on all parts, and coverage of six years or 60,000
miles on the engine, transmission and related parts. However,
after the basic warranty expired, Lincoln owners would pay a
$100-per-visit deductible on the extended power-train
coverage.</p>
<p>Cadillac recently told its dealers that it is eliminating
the $100-per-visit deductible on its 1991 models.</p>
<p>Ford also said it has lowered the deductible to $50 from
$100 on all Ford and Mercury cars and Ford light trucks
because shortened engine and transmission coverage to four
years or 50,000 miles from six years or 60,000 miles.</p>
