	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- Mitsubishi Motors Corp. is recalling about
167,000 cars and light trucks to fix emission problems that
violate federal air-pollution standards, the Environmental
Protection Agency said.
   The automaker is recalling 92,000 1987 model Mitsubishi
Mirages, Dodge Colts and Plymouth Colts -- all with 1.5-liter
engines -- for emitting too much carbon monoxide in the
exhaust because of faulty vacuum-control valves.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The government said Mitsubishi also began recalling 75,000
light trucks -- with two-liter engines -- for emitting
excessive carbon monoxide and hydrocarbons. Models affected
by the recall are the 1986 two-wheel-drive Mitsubishi truck
and Dodge Ram 50, and the 1986 and 1987 fourwheel drive Dodge
Colt Vista and Plymouth Colt Vista.</p>
<p>The EPA detected the problems during routine
auto-emissions tests. Mitsubishi will make repairs free of
charge. All the vehicles were built by Mitsubishi, but the
majority were sold by Chrysler Corp. under its Dodge or
Plymouth nameplates. Owners, who are to be notified by mail,
are advised by the EPA to schedule repairs with Mitsubishi or
Chrysler dealers.</p>
