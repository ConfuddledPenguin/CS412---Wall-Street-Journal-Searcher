	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- The U.S. merchandise trade deficit grew
slightly in May, the Commerce Department said, but analysts
showed little concern that the trend toward smaller deficits
may be in jeopardy.
   The May deficit of $7.73 billion, which followed a revised
$7.31 billion deficit in April, was fueled by a 2.9% increase
in imports, to $40.52 billion from $39.36 billion in April.
Exports also rose, climbing 2.2% to $32.8 billion from
April's $32.1 billion.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>A 15.2% increase in imports of petroleum products
accounted for a large portion of the deficit. These imports
averaged 1.4 million barrels more a day in May than in April.</p>
<p>Economists expressed little concern with the larger
deficit figures, focusing instead on the increase in exports
to Europe and the narrowing deficit with Japan. "Basically,
we're still on the path to a lower trade deficit than last
year," commented Brian Wesbury, vice president of Stotler
Economics Inc. "Both imports and exports were up, and the low
dollar continues to boost exports. Given the volatility of
these numbers, I don't see this as a reversal of the trend."</p>
<p>The $811.6 million May trade surplus with Western Europe,
while down from April's $1.36 billion, is still well ahead of
last year's figure, which showed the U.S. running a $40.3
million deficit for the month of May. The U.S. is running a
cumulative surplus of $3.53 billion so far this year with
Western Europe, compared with a cumulative surplus of $281
million at this time last year.</p>
<p>The deficit with Japan narrowed to $2.97 billion from
$3.95 billion in April.</p>
<p>"I'm looking at Eastern Europe and East Germany as a
source for increased demand for trade," said Charles Renfro,
chief economist for Alphametrics Corp. The opening up of the
East German economy and the need to rebuild the country's
infrastructure "are obviously going to increase our
capability of exporting to Germany," he added.</p>
<p>Other economists saw the lower value of the dollar as an
important component of the increasing exports. "We're seeing
the tail-end effect of the low exchange value of the dollar,"
said Joan Schneider, a money-market economist with
Continental Bank, Chicago.</p>
<p>The monetary union of Germany has other benefits for the
U.S, according to Stotler's Mr. Wesbury: "Against the German
mark, we should see a strengthening of the dollar," he said.</p>
<p>The cumulative trade deficit for January through May is
$40.7 billion. If projected over the rest of the year, the
deficit would total $97.7 billion for 1990. The deficit for
1989 was $109.4 billion.</p>
<p>"It strikes me that we've got a basis for a pretty good
situation given where we are in the recovery," Mr. Renfro
said.</p>
