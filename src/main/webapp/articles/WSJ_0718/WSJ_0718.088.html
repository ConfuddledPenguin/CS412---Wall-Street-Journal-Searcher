	<p class="article-leader">Field Corp., Chicago, said it put up for sale its Field
Publications educational unit, which publishes the Weekly
Reader and Funk & Wagnalls encyclopedia.
   The closely held concern said owner Marshall Field 5th has
decided to evaluate the possible sale of the business
"relative to the other things in the family portfolio and
relative to tax and estate planning issues."</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The company said it has retained the investment banking
firm Morgan Stanley & Co. to seek bids for the unit.</p>
<p>Field Corp. purchased the unit from Xerox Corp. in August
1985, and subsequently acquired the Funk & Wagnalls operation
in 1988.</p>
<p>A Field Corp. spokeswoman said she couldn't confirm
published reports that the Field Publications unit had 1989
revenues of about $300 million.</p>
<p>Field Publications, based in Middletown, Conn., has about
950 employees, the company said.</p>
