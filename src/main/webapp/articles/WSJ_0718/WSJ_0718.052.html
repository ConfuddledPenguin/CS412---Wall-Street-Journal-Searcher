	<p class="article-leader">NATIONAL FOODS Inc. (New York) -- Steven I. Bachenheimer,
president and chief operating officer since July 1989, left
this closely held maker of kosher deli products under the
Hebrew National name. A spokesman for the company said Mr.
Bachenheimer decided to leave "because of irreconcilable
differences about corporate growth priorities." Mr.
Bachenheimer confirmed his decision to leave as a result of
disagreements with National Foods Chairman Isidore Pines. He
said they "haven't been able to agree on how to go about
making the company grow." Harvey Potkin, previously senior
vice president, succeeds Mr. Bachenheimer, who said he has no
specific plans after leaving National Foods.</p>
