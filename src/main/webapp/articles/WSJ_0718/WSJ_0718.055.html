	<p class="article-leader">World leaders are coming to resemble those sanitation
workers who come in and sweep up after a parade. The people
make a dramatic gesture, and then the leaders come in a few
months later to make everything tidy.
   When the German people streamed through the Berlin Wall,
they effectively declared Germany a single sovereign nation,
able to choose its own alliances. Thus, not long after the
wall came down, it was clear that Germany would remain in
NATO. The diplomacy of the past several months merely gussied
up that certainty. The final touch came Monday when Mikhail
Gorbachev finally agreed to pull the 350,000 Soviet troops
out of East Germany within the next three or four years so
that a united Germany could have "full and unrestricted
sovereignty."</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The diplomacy has been conducted competently. The Soviets
first tried to play on aroused European fears about renewed
German hegemony, with Foreign Minister Shevardnadze's bizarre
suggestion that there be an international referendum on
German reunification. Then the Soviets played on left-wing
idealism, suggesting that Germany should join both NATO and
the Warsaw Pact as part of one happy family of nations. The
Soviets also appealed to technocratic gradualists, saying
Germany could be part of NATO politically, but not
militarily. Then they suggested that Germans reunify slowly
under the supervision of the victorious World War II powers.</p>
<p>It must have then been clear to the Soviets that their
wild proposals were going nowhere. Mr. Gorbachev must have
realized that even though he could do nothing to prevent
Germany from staying in NATO, he could nonetheless charge a
fee for acknowledging the arrangement. So he entered into
negotiations to settle on a price, which has now been met,
but not made public. Mr. Gorbachev reportedly told Premier
Mitterrand, "the same day the reunification of Germany is
announced, a general will be sitting in my armchair." But
that was wind. Mr. Gorbachev still has his seat.</p>
<p>On the Western side, the patient handling of the issue
serves as a model of Western diplomatic cooperation. At the
Houston Summit, the leaders, under the influence of Prime
Minister Thatcher, arrived at a compromise whereby the G-7
powers would not give joint aid to the Soviets, but
individual nations could. The unspoken message was that aid
will not help the still-unreformed Soviet economy, but is
worthwhile if it will seal Germany's membership in the
alliance. The London NATO summit sent the proper military
signals, and to climax the deal, Chancellor Kohl flew to
Zheleznovodsk with his checkbook.</p>
<p>The German-Soviet agreement brings NATO up to date. There
is no need to find a replacement for NATO through distended
disarmament talks. Instead, the Western powers can now focus
on issues that were swept under the rug in order to strike
this deal. The West forsook independence movements in the
breakaway republics so as not to ruin negotiations on
Germany. Now that the West's house is in order there is no
need to ignore the yearnings of the Soviet peoples. The U.S.
decision to meet with members of the Russian democratic
opposition party is an important step in the right direction.</p>
<p>Western leaders need not worry about having a vision for
the future. The people will lead the parade. The leaders need
only follow and formalize.</p>
