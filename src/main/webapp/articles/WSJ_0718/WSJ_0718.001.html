	<p class="article-leader">The Ukrainian Supreme Soviet declared the Ukraine a
sovereign state on Monday. The Ukrainian proclamation
asserted the republic's right to create its own currency,
raise its own army, collect tariffs and erect enforceable
borders. The Ukrainian parliament served notice that
Ukrainian citizens will fulfill their military service only
on their own territory, expressed its preference that the
Ukraine become a neutral state outside the Warsaw Pact and
rejected the "production, deployment and use of nuclear
weapons" -- a big step for a region that is a major basing
point for the Soviet nuclear force. Yet far from signalling a
dangerous lurch toward nationalist xenophobia, the Ukrainian
parliament's action was an important victory for an emerging
non-communist patriotic movement, firmly rooted in democracy.
   With a population of 52 million, the Ukraine is a major
chunk of the Soviet economy. The republic produces
one-quarter of Soviet agricultural output, more than 40% of
the Soviet Union's nuclear energy and some 10% of its coal.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>During the first three years of the Gorbachev era, from
1985 until 1988, the Ukraine remained quiet under the rule of
Brezhnev crony turned Gorbachev ally, Vladimir Shcherbitsky.
The republic learned silence from its immense suffering under
Stalin. Between 5 million and 7 million Ukrainians died at
Stalin's hand and each month brings reports of newly
discovered killing fields, like Bykivnia near Kiev, which
holds as many as 300,000 victims.</p>
<p>But Ukrainian quiescence ended in 1988, when crowds of as
many as 200,000 began to gather in unsanctioned and often
brutally repressed rallies. An energetic, democratic reform
movement, the Ukrainian Popular Movement, or Rukh, appeared.</p>
<p>In the 10 months since it was founded, Rukh has emerged as
a formidable political force. It now claims 3 million
supporters. Most of Rukh's reform communist members have quit
the party.</p>
<p>When the Ukrainian parliament began meeting in May, Rukh
members quickly turned it into a boisterous forum for radical
political debate. Sessions were televised throughout the
republic. Nationalist deputies, more than a dozen of them
former long-term political prisoners, got a large public
audience for the first time. In the nationalist hotbed of
Lvov, a new newspaper, For a Free Ukraine, has been launched,
with an initial print of 100,000. Dozens of samizdat
newspapers are proliferating at workplaces and in urban
centers, all of them spreading the message of Ukrainian
independence.</p>
<p>Public opinion is shifting toward non-communist forces.
The call for self-determination has been propelled by the
Ukraine's mounting ecological crisis: the aftermath of the
Chernobyl nuclear accident, the poisoning of the Dnieper and
Dniester rivers and the rampant mining of uranium which has
placed the Ukraine first in the world in oncological
illnesses.</p>
<p>Western analysts have long differentiated between the more
nationalist western Ukraine and the more Russified eastern
segment. But Rukh leaders such as Orest Vlokh see a different
dichotomy emerging. "Increasingly, the divide is not between
East and West, but between North and South," says Mr. Vlokh,
a physicist and member of the Supreme Soviet. In the
predominantly rural southern Ukraine, the memory of Stalin's
terror, coupled with the legacy of domination by the Ottoman
Empire, has long blocked the emergence of a normal civil
society and political ferment.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, supposedly accommodationist east Ukrainian
cities such as Kharkov are quickly radicalizing. Kharkov, a 1
million-strong industrial center, once served as the capital
of the Bolshevik Ukrainian republic. But radicals and
pro-independence forces won more than one-third of the city's
seats in the national parliament. Kharkov is home to a new,
independent Ukrainian trade union confederation, Unity. Even
in the mining center of Donetsk, where nearly half the
population is Russian, the movement toward sovereignty is
gaining. One independent miner's leader told me, "The Ukraine
is very rich. It has enormous economic potential. The Donbas
workers will support sovereignty and independence for the
Ukraine if it makes economic sense."</p>
<p>Even Ukrainian Communists are coming to realize that they
can no longer be protected by the center, a point driven home
by the recently concluded Party Congress in Moscow. While
hardliners were staging a futile challenge to Mikhail
Gorbachev, the Ukrainian parliament angrily took the
unprecedented step of voting to recall the 63 Communist Party
parliamentarians "who left for the congress without the
session's permission."</p>
<p>The Ukraine's Communists are seeking to cling to their own
base of support and enhance their power by appealing to the
public mood for self-determination. As such, they are
repeating a pattern that emerged twice before: in the 1920s,
when Ukrainian National Communism led to a brief flowering of
Ukrainian culture, and in the early '70s, when the Ukrainian
party's first secretary was purged on charges of promoting
nationalism.</p>
<p>Mikhail Gorbachev has been slow to react to the rising
nationalist unrest throughout his empire. He now confronts a
growing challenge in the Ukraine and elsewhere. Having
already abandoned the idea of "federalism," Mr. Gorbachev may
well be forced to retreat from his concept of a "union of
sovereign republics" and to embrace reluctantly the concept
of a confederation with a much diminished central government.</p>
<p>The Ukraine's re-emergence on the world stage is likely to
provoke profound unease among Western policy makers. This is
not Lithuania: The Ukraine is the linchpin in the Soviet
empire. Yet now is precisely the right time for the West to
establish links to the Ukraine's emerging political leaders,
who -- contrary to stereotypes -- are men and women of
moderation, sincerely committed to the rights of national
minorities, resolutely hostile to anti-Semitism and
profoundly devoted to the parliamentary road to democracy.
They offer a vision of a peaceful evolution from an empire in
crisis to a stable community of democratic European states.</p>
