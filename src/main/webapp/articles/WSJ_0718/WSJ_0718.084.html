	<p class="article-leader">KEY LOIS, Fla. -- What distinguishes Florida's latest
business scandal isn't the stripping of assets or the
offshore deposits or the governor's outburst or the size of
the mess, although all those things are involved.
   No, the controversy swirling around this little island has
more to do with monkey business.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Three thousand rhesus monkeys are being raised on Key Lois
and another island in the lower Florida Keys by a
monkey-breeding unit of Charles River Laboratories Inc., a
Boston subsidiary of Bausch & Lomb Inc., the big vision-care
concern with $1.2 billion in sales last year. The company
sells the animals for medical research.</p>
<p>The first of the monkeys arrived here from India in the
early 1970s. And most roam free; they aren't confined in
cages. Their islands are well offshore -- two or three miles
from people. The two islands have no human inhabitants.</p>
<p>That is probably just as well. Over the years, the monkeys
have ravaged the two keys and surrounding waters. They have
stripped bare acres of red mangrove, a protected tree, and
they have turned the waters around this island -- the more
wasted of the two-into something of a simian sewer. Which is
where the politicians come in.</p>
<p>The monkeys have become the business of the highest
elected officials in the state.</p>
<p>Florida's governor and the state's cabinet, which is made
up of the six, elected executive-branch department heads, act
as trustee for all state-owned lands. That makes the monkeys
a cabinet-level issue, because the state claims its property
includes some of the land the monkeys have damaged. Charles
River claims to own the islands. But no matter who owns an
island, the state owns everything below the mean high-water
line. The little islands total 309 acres in area; the state
claims to own about half the land, at least at low tide.</p>
<p>Charles River disputes the state's ownership assertions,
and it sued in 1986 to establish its claim of clear title to
Key Lois and Raccoon Key, the other little island. Florida
countersued, and the two sides have been trying to settle out
of court. Such efforts went largely unnoticed until recently,
when a vote on a proposed settlement appeared on the agenda
for the cabinet meeting of May 22. The settlement called for
Charles River to make lease payments for the submerged
acreage the state says it owns while also phasing out the
monkeys on Key Lois over 20 years and within 30 years on
Raccoon Key.</p>
<p>"We had had this great silence, and then all of a sudden
this announcement on the agenda that they were renewing the
lease for 30 years," says Dagny Johnson, president of the
Upper Keys Citizens Association, which she runs from her home
in Key Largo, well north of here, and describes as a
"nonprofit, nonpaid, non-anything old-time tried-and-true
citizens movement."</p>
<p>Soon, phones of community activists, environmentalists and
politicians were ringing all over the Keys and up into
Tallahassee, the state capital. "We just raised Cain," Ms.
Johnson goes on. "`Damn it, get those monkeys out]' This is
how you have to talk to the state."</p>
<p>The monkey movement here has various motives, but
anti-vivisection and animal rights aren't major ones. People
claim to worry that a hurricane or other big storm could blow
monkeys all over the Keys. Some cite human health and
environmental issues. A few have truly cataclysmic visions.
All the movement types say they don't want to continue to
have primates in these parts for another 20 or 30 years.</p>
<p>"When I arrived in 1980, I'd stand over here and look at
the monkey island, and it was vegetated and nice and green,"
says James McElroy, a retiree and president of the Monroe
County Condo Owners Association, who lives on Cudjoe Cay, a
couple of miles across a shallow bay from Key Lois. "But in
the last three or four years, the island has become
devastated. It looks blighted. The defecation of the monkeys
is extremely deep, and when the storms and rains come, this
washes into our nearshore waters, and that's something we do
not need."</p>
<p>That isn't all they don't need.</p>
<p>"What if some strain got into the monkeys, like rabies or
something?" asks Monroe County Commissioner Douglas M. Jones,
who lives in Key West. "How would you ever know, till someone
got bit? And then they've got it and, my goodness, a
hurricane comes and spreads those rabid monkeys all over the
Keys." So some of the talk is not just cataclysmic, it is
also hypothetical.</p>
<p>Barbara Kelley, public affairs director at Bausch & Lomb's
Rochester, N.Y., headquarters, says such fears are wildly
overblown. "We have our staff people there continually
monitoring the health of the monkeys," she says. "This is the
cleanest, healthiest monkey population in the world." Indeed,
the company thinks it more likely that humans could infect
the monkeys than vice versa. Big signs loom to discourage
intruders on the islands: "Posted -- U.S. Government Project
-- Trespassers Will Be Prosecuted." Ms. Kelley says the
phrase "Government Project" means that some of the monkeys
are used by government agencies.</p>
<p>She insists, furthermore, that "there has never been an
instance of a hurricane disturbing a breeding colony. We
think that this is a very unlikely, remote possibility. But
even if it occurred, the monkeys probably wouldn't present a
hazard to any humans."</p>
<p>Bausch & Lomb doesn't deny that the monkeys are tearing up
the red mangroves, but it says it is working to refoliate the
island under a 1988 consent order with the state's Department
of Environmental Regulation. It is caging trees, so the
uncaged monkeys can't get to them.</p>
<p>The citizens' outcry was sufficiently loud that the
governor and cabinet, at the May 22 meeting at which the
monkeys came up, voted to delay action on the proposed
settlement with Charles River. They said they first wanted
the Department of Environmental Regulation to rule on whether
the company was complying with the 1988 consent order.</p>
<p>In June, the department certified that Charles River was
in compliance. But by then, spurred by the local protests,
officials were taking a closer look. State Treasurer Tom
Gallagher and others flew over in a helicopter for a little
fact-finding. The facts found didn't help the monkeys' cause.</p>
<p>Paul Bradshaw, cabinet aide to Gov. Bob Martinez, was
particularly bothered by the abundance of monkey waste in the
water. "If you apply monkey-see monkey-do, you'd have to
emphasize the monkey-do portion," he says. He worries that
the waste, because it is so nutrient-rich, could affect sea
life or the natural balance of a nearby coral reef. Bausch &
Lomb's Ms. Kelley disagrees. "From an environmental point of
view, that really doesn't present any sort of hazard," she
says.</p>
<p>By the June 26 cabinet meeting, the tide was turning
against the monkeys. When the proposed settlement with
Charles River came up for consideration, Education
Commissioner Betty Castor moved to defer action. State
Comptroller Gerald Lewis seconded the motion. Then Gov.
Martinez interrupted.</p>
<p>"I'd like to see if we can prosecute," he said, as he
passed around photos of the monkey damage.</p>
<p>"I mean, they've just stripped all the state land and left
it bare," the governor went on. "The monkeys are running
wild. I suspect if we ever get a storm there, they're going
to all end up on the mainland somewhere."</p>
<p>After a very brief debate, the governor and cabinet voted
to unleash their lawyers. The officials hope both to force a
repair of any damage to state lands and to change county
land-use regulations to prohibit the likes of this in the
future.</p>
<p>Bausch & Lomb didn't have anyone present at the meeting.
It says it had been told monkeys weren't on the agenda. The
company now is trying to find out what happens next.</p>
<p>The cabinet meets again in August, but it isn't clear that
the monkeys will be an issue. Kenneth Plante, general counsel
for the Department of Natural Resources, says his staff is
proceeding once more with the title-dispute litigation.</p>
<p>Even with the governor and cabinet on the case, no one
believes the end is near. Ms. Johnson, the Key Largo
activist, says, "We would anticipate that the corporation
will take a little while longer to change their minds."</p>
