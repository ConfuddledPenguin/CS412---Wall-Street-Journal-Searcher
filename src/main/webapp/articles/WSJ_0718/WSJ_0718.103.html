	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- The National Aeronautics and Space
Administration said it would resume flying the space shuttle
in mid-August or early September.
   NASA grounded the shuttle fleet last month after finding
fuel leaks in two shuttles. About the same time, it
discovered that its Hubble Space Telescope was crippled. The
two events have led to a re-examination of NASA's future by
Congress and the White House.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>NASA said it discovered the fuel leaks weren't as
difficult to fix as it had feared. Although the leaks looked
similar on the launch pad, the space agency said, they had
different origins and were relatively easy to repair.</p>
<p>The space agency said it would try to fix the leak on the
shuttle Atlantis on the launch pad, by tightening or
replacing dozens of bolts, and fly the craft around Aug. 10.
Atlantis is carrying a reconnaissance satellite for the
Pentagon.</p>
<p>If Atlantis is launched on time, the agency said it would
launch Columbia around Sept. 10. Columbia will carry a set of
space telescopes. But if NASA can't fix the leak on Atlantis
on the launch pad, the agency said it would bring it back to
the assemby building for further work and move Columbia's
launch to about Sept. 1.</p>
<p>Launching both by mid-September "requires us to be lucky
twice," said William Lenoir, NASA's associate administrator
for space flight.</p>
