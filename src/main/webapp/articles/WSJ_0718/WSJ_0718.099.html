	<p class="article-leader">MOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif. -- Sun Microsystems Inc., gaining
another ally in its battle to win the hearts of
desktop-computer users in businesses, said a Xerox Corp. unit
agreed to provide its popular desktop-publishing software for
Sun's machines.
   The unit, Ventura Software Inc., agreed to produce its
Ventura Publisher for Sun's Sparcstation computers, Sun said.
Sun also announced a new software-distribution program called
Catalyst CDware in which Sun will provide users with a
compact disk filled with application software.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The Ventura agreement is a boon for Sun, which is trying
to broaden the use of its machines to business offices from
the more traditional engineering uses where Sun's machines
are extremely popular. To do that, Sun machines need a
critical mass of the kind of software businesses use: word
processor, spreadsheet, data base and desktop publishing
programs, for example.</p>
<p>Sun has already won some big-time allies in Lotus
Development Corp., Wordperfect Corp. and Ashton-Tate Co.,
which have agreed to tailor their programs to Sun machines.</p>
