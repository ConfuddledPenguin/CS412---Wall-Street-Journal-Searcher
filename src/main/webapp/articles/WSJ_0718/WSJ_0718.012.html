	<p class="article-leader">ATLANTA -- Coca-Cola Co. said second-quarter net income
rose 19% on strong growth overseas, despite weak sales at
home.
   The soft-drink giant, which earns roughly 80% of its
income outside the U.S., reported earnings in the period of
$409.9 million, or 61 cents a share, compared with $345.5
million, or 49 cents a share, a year earlier. Revenue rose
18% to $2.74 billion from $2.33 billion.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The results were in line with analysts' expectations.</p>
<p>"Overseas is really what did it," said Emanuel Goldman, a
beverage-industry analyst with PaineWebber Inc. in San
Francisco, "especially margin expansions in Europe and the
Pacific."</p>
<p>In Western Europe, where Coke generally earns about
one-third of its profit, operating profit jumped 25%, Mr.
Goldman said. The increase was paced by a 42% gain in
concentrate and syrup sales in Spain, the company reported,
and a 20% jump in such sales in Britain.</p>
<p>Coke sells concentrates and syrups to local bottlers, who
mix the formulas with carbonated water to produce soft
drinks.</p>
<p>In the Benelux region, Coke said, concentrate and syrup
sales increased 17%, but they were flat in West Germany as
bottlers reduced bloated inventories.</p>
<p>In the U.S., where profit margins on soft-drink sales are
smaller than abroad because of stiffer competition, Coke said
its concentrate and syrup sales grew just 1% in the period.
Specifically, the company cited "slower restaurant-industry
traffic" as the cause of its domestic softness, a trend
confirmed by some restaurant operators. Coke derives about
onethird of its U.S. volume from so-called fountain sales to
restaurants.</p>
<p>"Around here, the restaurant business is down about 20%,"
said Steven Abdow, president of the specialty restaurant
division of Springfield, Mass.-based Abdow Corp., which
operates a chain of Big Boy restaurants in western New
England. "Our own business is down between 3% and 5%" from a
year earlier, he said.</p>
<p>Coke said its fountain sales are picking up this quarter,
thanks to "new distribution" coming on line. In May, Coke
wrested away the fountain business of Grand Metropolitan
PLC's Burger King restaurants from Pepsi, an account that Mr.
Goldman estimated will add about 7% to Coke's fountain sales.</p>
<p>For the six months, Coke said net grew 15% to $693.4
million, or $1.02 a share, from $605.3 million, or 85 cents a
share. Revenue also jumped 15%, to $4.89 billion from $4.24
billion.</p>
