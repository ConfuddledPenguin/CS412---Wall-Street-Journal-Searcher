	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Yields on certificates of deposit at major
banks and brokerage firms were mostly lower in the week ended
Tuesday.
   Average yields on small-denomination CDs sold directly by
banks were flat to down slightly. The average yield on
six-month consumer CDs slipped to 7.62% from 7.64%, while the
average yield on two-year CDs remained at 7.88%, according to
a nationwide, 18-bank survey by Banxquote Money Markets, a
New York information service.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Average yields on small-denomination CDs sold by leading
broker dealers were down slightly. The average yield on
one-year CDs eased to 8.10% from 8.19%, while the average for
two-year CDs fell to 8.13% from 8.32%, according to
Banxquote.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, average yields for large-denomination CDs,
which typically require deposits of $90,000 or more, were
also down slightly. The average yield on one-year jumbo CDs
went to 7.81% from 7.93%, while the average for five-year
maturities went to 8.19% from 8.23%.</p>
<p>The decrease in yields on broker-sold and
large-denomination CDs was in response to the lowering of the
federal funds rate (the daily interest rate that banks charge
each other) by the Federal Reserve, says Richard B. Hoey,
chief economist, U.S., of Barclays de Zoete Wedd.</p>
<p>"The expectation previously was that the Fed would cut the
rate in the third quarter," he said, and that "banks would
have moved their rates in sync." What happened instead, he
says, is that the drop took place sooner than expected.</p>
<p>The outlook for the next few months? "There probably isn't
an awful lot of action ahead," Mr. Hoey said.</p>
