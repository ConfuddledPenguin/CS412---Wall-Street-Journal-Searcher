	<p class="article-leader">Major U.S. drug makers reported higher earnings for the
second quarter as a result of increased sales, cost-cutting
measures and new products.
   Eli Lilly & Co. led the field, posting a 26% increase in
earnings, followed by Upjohn Co. with a 21% upturn, and
Pfizer Co., whose earnings rose 11% from the year-earlier
quarter.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Higher earnings had been expected from the pharmaceuticals
concerns, and analysts were pleased with results at Lilly,
which exceeded most analysts' estimates. Because one-time
items boosted Upjohn's earnings, however, that company's
results generated some investor disappointment.</p>
<p>In New York Stock Exchange composite trading, Upjohn
shares fell 50 cents each, to $41.50. Pfizer closed up $1.125
at $69.25. Despite its strong earnings, Lilly closed down
87.5 cents at $88.875.</p>
<p>Eli Lilly & Co.</p>
<p>Record-high world-wide sales contributed to the surge in
second-quarter earnings for Lilly. The Indianapolis
pharmaceuticals giant said the rapid growth of its
anti-depressant Prozac paced sales, which grew 24% to $1.225
billion from $986.6 million a year ago.</p>
<p>Lilly said that among other contributors to its growth
were the anti-ulcer drug Axid, the antibiotic Ceclor, and
Humatrope, the growth hormone that earlier this month was
reported to decrease the debilitating effects of aging.</p>
<p>The company's medical-instrument systems segment had
another strong quarter, led by the Cardiovascular Systems
unit, which is benefiting from regulatory difficulties
encountered by a competitor.</p>
<p>The company said cancer diagnostics led to increased sales
in its Hybritech unit for the quarter. Lilly's acquisition of
Pacific Biotech Inc., a developer of immunodiagnostic-testing
products, also was completed during the second quarter.</p>
<p>"This is a very high quality {earnings} quarter," said
Jerome Brimeyer, an analyst with Dean Witter Reynolds. He
attributed the drop in Lilly's stock yesterday to either
large profit-taking or reaction to rumors of a suit involving
the drug Prozac.</p>
<p>Upjohn Co.</p>
<p>Upjohn, helped by one-time items, reported a jump in
earnings from the previous year. The Kalamazoo, Mich.,
company posted revenue of $805 million, up 11% from $728
million a year ago.</p>
<p>Strong sales in the U.S. and Europe, and cost-cutting
measures implemented in 1989 helped boost quarterly earnings,
the company said. U.S. sales rose 9% to $487 million from the
previous year; foreign sales climbed 13% to $318 million.</p>
<p>In addition, a $43 million pension credit and other
nonrecurring charges raised pretax earnings by $28 million,
or 10 cents a share, the company said. The pension credit
involved lump-sum payments to employees who took advantage of
an early-retirement program announced last year.</p>
<p>Pfizer Inc.</p>
<p>Pfizer said second-quarter sales rose 15% to $1.5 billion
from $1.3 billion in the period a year ago.</p>
<p>In the quarter, Pfizer said health-care product sales
surged 26% on the strength of some new products. The company
said it received more than $165 million from sales of its new
cardiovascular drugs, Procardia XL, Cardura, Minipress XL and
Norvasc; the anti-fungal drug Diflucan; and the Monorail
Piccolino coronary angioplasty catheter, which is used to
clear arteries.</p>
<p>Pfizer said it expects the benefits from new products to
continue, saying it anticipates having six new drugs approved
by the Food and Drug Administration during the next two
years.</p>
<p>The company said its specialty-chemicals sales grew 4% in
the quarter, but animal-health sales were flat and
consumer-product sales dropped 2%. Specialty minerals sales
fell 20% but would have increased 13% if not for the sale of
a pigments business.</p>
