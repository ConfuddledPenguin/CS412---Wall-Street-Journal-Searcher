	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- President Bush invited top congressional
leaders from both parties to come to the White House this
afternoon in what appeared to be another attempt to prod the
bipartisan budget talks toward a compromise.
   The invitation, which White House Chief of Staff John
Sununu confirmed late yesterday, comes as congressional
Democrats attempted to fashion a tax package that staffers
said is likely to include proposals to increase taxes on
upper-income Americans in addition to increasing the marginal
tax rate. Democratic leaders met yesterday to pare their list
of tax options, but they said they hadn't finished the task.
"The purpose is to see where our bottom line is," said House
Budget Chairman Leon Panetta (D., Calif.)</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Separately, the House failed to approve a constitutional
amendment, backed by Mr. Bush, that would have required a
balanced federal budget. The House vote was 279-150, seven
votes short of the two-thirds vote needed to approve an
amendment. The action appears to kill, at least for this
year, any effort to alter the Constitution to force balanced
budgets.</p>
<p>The amendment, authored by Rep. Charles Stenholm (D.,
Texas), would have allowed federal outlays to exceed receipts
only during wartime or if three-fifths of the House and
Senate approved a specific deficit.</p>
<p>Mr. Bush last met with the bipartisan congressional
leadership June 26. That meeting produced a brief White House
statement in which the president acknowledged that tax
increases are needed to reduce the deficit, and it gave the
talks momentum.</p>
<p>Mr. Bush yesterday warned of unrest in the financial
markets unless budget negotiations get moving soon. "The time
for game-playing is over, and we have to get something done
that is not only a sound budget agreement but is seen by the
American people to be a sound budget agreement," he told a
group of magazine publishers. "And I worry, if we don't get
one, about the confidence in the marketplace."</p>
<p>The president acknowledged that he may have to do more to
explain the urgency of the budget problem to the American
people -- something Democrats have been asking him to do for
weeks. "I still feel that there isn't quite the acute
awareness on the part of the average American as deserves to
be there," he said.</p>
<p>Today's planned meeting at the White House comes at a time
of heightened tensions, both between parties and within them.
Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell (D., Maine) and
Minority Leader Bob Dole (R., Kan.), both of whom were
invited to the White House meeting, spent much of yesterday
in a bitter dispute on the Senate floor over the Democrats'
tactics in handling a pending civil rights bill.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Republican congressional budget negotiators
continue to fret privately about contacts between Budget
Director Richard Darman and the chairmen of the tax-writing
panels, Sen. Lloyd Bentsen (D., Texas) and Rep. Dan
Rostenkowski (D., Ill.), and their staffs -- despite Mr.
Darman's assurances that he isn't cutting a deal behind the
backs of congressional Republicans.</p>
<p>"I don't know of anything concrete going on in the
so-called behind-the-scenes meetings," said Sen. Pete
Domenici (R., N.M.), senior Republican on the Senate Budget
Committee. "We're aren't going to agree in little groups.
We're going to agree in a big group."</p>
<p>Mr. Bush discussed the budget talks with Republican
congressional leaders yesterday. One leading Republican
hard-liner emerged sounding slightly more open to tax
increases than he has in the past. `We're looking at a wide
range of possible taxes," said Rep. Newt Gingrich (R., Ga.),
the Republican House whip. "The position I've taken publicly
is that we're not going to change the top {income tax} rate.
We're not going to go for an increased income tax. But within
that framework, I'm very open to looking at a wide range of
how do you deal with it."</p>
<p>Republican leaders in the House are trying to head off a
confrontation with their own rank and file over the wisdom of
raising taxes. Rep. Richard Armey (R., Texas) today will ask
other House Republicans to endorse his call for the budget
summit to reject "new taxes and all tax-rate increases."
Democrats have said repeatedly that they will back a
compromise with the White House only if half the Republicans
in the Senate and House support it.</p>
<p>Invited to the White House this afternoon, besides Sen.
Mitchell and Sen. Dole, are House Speaker Thomas Foley (D.,
Wash.), House Majority Leader Richard Gephardt (D., Mo.) and
House Minority Leader Bob Michel (R., Ill.).</p>
