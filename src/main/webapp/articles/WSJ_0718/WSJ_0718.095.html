	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- McGraw-Hill Inc. reported a 27% drop in
second-quarter net income, but the publishing and business
information company said it expects a big jump in earnings
for the second half of the year.
   Quarter net fell to $37.2 million, or 76 cents a share,
from $50.8 million, or $1.04 a share. Acquisitions made in
1989 boosted the company's interest expense about $6.3
million in the 1990 second quarter. Also, non-recurring gains
and related tax benefits of the year-earlier were only
partially offset by savings from a restructuring of the
company's businesses. Revenue for the latest quarter rose
6.8%, to $457.8 million, from $428.4 million.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Joseph L. Dionne, chairman and chief executive officer of
McGraw-Hill, said all four of the company's operating
segments had revenue increases in the quarter, but only the
Financial Services segment improved operating profit.
Financial Services includes Standard & Poor's Rating Group,
which was helped by "growing international activity and a
strong performance in municipals," said Mr. Dionne.</p>
<p>Softness in advertising hurt McGraw-Hill's Business Week
and Aviation Week magazines, pulling operating profit for the
Information and Publication Services segment down about 20%
from the year-earlier period, the company said.</p>
<p>The 27% drop in quarterly earnings follows an even bigger
drop in the first quarter, but Mr. Dionne said he is still
predicting that earnings for the year will fall between $3.50
a share and $4 a share. That would put operating earnings
above the level of 1988. In 1989, after special charges,
McGraw-Hill's net fell to $47.8 million, or 98 cents a share.</p>
