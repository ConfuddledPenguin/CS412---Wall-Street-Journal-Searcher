	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- United Telecommunications Inc.'s stock plunged
24% after the company reported a 55% drop in second-quarter
net income and a $42 million operating loss at its
long-distance communications unit, US Sprint Communications
Co.
   The poor showing by Sprint, the nation's third-largest
long-distance service provider, stunned Wall Street analysts,
who had been expecting a much smaller decline and had cut
their estimates for the company last month.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>United took a charge of $72 million, or 18 cents a share,
to cover a 5% cut in Sprint's work force, a write-off of
outdated software used in the company's computers and
accruals for certain contract disputes.</p>
<p>"Obviously the Street got blindsided," said PaineWebber
Inc. analyst Jack B. Grubman, who along with numerous other
analysts had cut his estimates in June. "This is a material
change in the company's earnings situation."</p>
<p>"More important than the operating loss," said analyst
Robert B. Morris of Goldman, Sachs & Co., is that without the
charge, Sprint's operating profit would have been $30
million, which is "at a minimum $60 million away from what
the market was expecting."</p>
<p>Profit at United Telecom, based in Kansas City, Mo., fell
to $40.6 million, or 18 cents a share, from $90.5 million, or
43 cents a share, a year earlier. Revenue rose 12% to $2.07
billion from $1.85 billion.</p>
<p>The company's stock dropped $8.75 to $29.50 on heavy New
York Stock Exchange composite volume of more than 11.8
million shares.</p>
<p>United Telecom had planned to buy the rest of Sprint from
GTE Corp. by September. Now, a spokesman for United Telecom
said that while the company would like to buy GTE's 19.9%
stake this year, the purchase could be put off until next
year or until Sprint's profit improves.</p>
<p>William T. Esrey, United Telecom's chairman and chief
executive officer, pegged Sprint's showing to severe
competition in the lower end of the long-distance market:
residential and small-business customers. Results from
service provided to large corporate users are meeting
expectations, he said.</p>
<p>Sprint will be "shifting considerable additional people
into sales and marketing," Mr. Esrey said, and will pare
about 1,000 support and other staffers from its 20,000-member
work force.</p>
<p>Analysts said Sprint is losing market share -- revenue
grew just 2% in the second quarter from the first period --
to American Telephone & Telegraph Co. and the nation's No. 2
carrier, MCI Communications Corp. "Starting in the fourth
quarter, MCI literally attacked the market," hiring some 500
sales and marketing people, said Mr. Morris, adding that AT&T
"was right there, toe to toe" with MCI.</p>
<p>Even more worrisome was Sprint's lack of control over its
costs, noted Mr. Grubman of PaineWebber. "Sprint spent $80
million more in the quarter to get about $25 million more in
revenue," he said. That's not going to change. "With the loss
in revenue momentum, they're going to have to spend even more
on sales and marketing to win customers back."</p>
<p>Mr. Esrey said "we haven't reacted as fast as we should
have to competitive pressures." He added, "I look at this as
a serious setback" but one that the company is addressing
aggressively. All areas will be targeted for cost cuts, he
said, declining to elaborate.</p>
<p>The company's local phone operations were comparatively
robust, posting 10% higher operating profit on a 4% revenue
rise; the business is "performing quite well," Mr. Esrey
said. The parent's complementary businesses, including a
directory publisher and an equipment unit, saw 8.3% higher
profit on 2% more revenue.</p>
