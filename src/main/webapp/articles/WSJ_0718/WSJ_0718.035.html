	<p class="article-leader">DETROIT -- The Big Three U.S. auto makers had their worst
second quarter since the recession years of the early 1980s
as their combined earnings dropped as much as 54%, analysts
estimated.
   General Motors Corp., Ford Motor Co. and Chrysler Corp.
were hurt as competition from Japanese auto makers forced
them to squeeze profit margins in their core North American
vehicle operations, analysts said. In addition, GM and Ford
probably broke even or were unprofitable on their Brazilian
operations, which have been hobbled by economic turmoil
there.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Combined second-quarter profit at GM, Ford and Chrysler
are expected to be $1.47 billion to $1.84 billion -- about
half of the $3.2 billion combined profit a year earlier.
That's the lowest the Big Three's combined profit has been
for the April to June period since 1982. That year, combined
profit was $869.2 million.</p>
<p>"It was a lousy quarter given that spring is usually very
strong," said John A. Casesa, auto analyst at Wertheim
Schroder & Co. in New York. The second quarter is often the
strongest period of the year for auto industry earnings.</p>
<p>Weak sales are only part of the problem. So far this year,
total U.S. car and truck sales are just 3.4% behind the
year-ago period. But Japanese auto makers are winning a
greater share of the shrinking market, forcing Detroit to
continue profit-gobbling discount deals despite relatively
tight inventories. Analysts estimate the Big Three still are
spending about $400 more per vehicle on incentives than a
year ago, even though rebate costs have eased somewhat since
earlier this year.</p>
<p>"Industry sales aren't at recessionary levels but their
earnings are close to it," said Ann Knight, auto analyst at
PaineWebber Inc.</p>
<p>Just last month, the Big Three took a step to offset the
expense of rebates by announcing broad, midyear price
increases. Ford led the pack, and GM and Chrysler followed
shortly thereafter.</p>
<p>Analysts say higher prices, coupled with tight
inventories, could boost profits in the second half. "With
inventories the best they've been in five years, rebates
coming down and prices going up, this sets the stage for an
upside surprise in the second half," said Scott Merlis, auto
analyst with Morgan Stanley & Co.</p>
<p>But in the just-ended quarter, Ford and GM derived the
bulk of their automotive profits from Europe, where the
market is still relatively strong, analysts said.</p>
<p>At GM, analysts estimate second-quarter earnings tumbled
as much as 48% to between $756 million, or $1.20 a share, and
$900 million, or $1.30 a share. GM earned $1.45 billion, or
$2.23 a share, a year ago.</p>
<p>GM may have done relatively better than its rivals because
it managed to hold its share of the North American car market
at 35.7%, virtually the same level as a year ago, and
increase slightly its share of the European market, analysts
said.</p>
<p>GM probably earned money on its North American vehicle
operations in the quarter, but "from a profitability
standard, GM is a European company," said Morgan Stanley's
Mr. Merlis.</p>
<p>At Ford, second-quarter earnings fell as much as 60% to
between $571 million, or $1.25 a share, and $752 million, or
$1.65 a share, analysts said. The No. 2 auto maker reported
earnings of $1.41 billion, or $3 a share, a year earlier.</p>
<p>Ford's biggest problem in the quarter was its U.S.
passenger car business. After three years in a row of gains,
Ford saw its share of the car market slide two percentage
points to 20.8% in the first half. The redesigned Ford
Escort, introduced in the second quarter, is off to a slow
start and one-time gold mines, like the Ford Mustang, are
losing luster as they age.</p>
<p>"They are feeling the heat from GM's aggressive pricing
and Japanese competitors," said Mr. Casesa of Wertheim
Schroder.</p>
<p>Ford also saw its share of the European market slip by a
tenth of a percentage point, anaylsts said. But Europe
remains a strong market for the auto maker, and the company
is doing well in the U.S. truck market, analysts said. Its
profitable new Explorer off-road vehicle, launched in March,
is selling briskly.</p>
<p>Chrysler, which has no significant overseas operations,
was hit hard from two directions in the second quarter,
analysts said. Its share of the U.S. car market slumped to
8.9% in the first half from 10.6% a year ago. And competitors
are introducing new minivans and off-road vehicles, such as
Ford's Explorer, which threaten Chrysler's dominance in both
those lucrative light truck markets.</p>
<p>The result: Chrysler's profit fell as much as 60% to as
low as $138 million, or 60 cents a share, some analysts said.
Others said Chrysler's profit could be as high as $190
million, or 85 cents a share. But that's still down sharply
from $341 million, or $1.46 a share, a year earlier.</p>
<p>"What has been paying the bills at Chrysler has been
strong sales of minivans and Jeeps, but it's difficult to
continue to maintain {profit} margins in this competitive
environment," said John V. Kirnan, auto analyst at Kidder,
Peabody & Co.</p>
