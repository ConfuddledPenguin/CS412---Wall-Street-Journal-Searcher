	<p class="article-leader">Intel Corp. said net income rose 72% in its second quarter
as computer makers continued to snap up the company's popular
microprocessor chips to build into personal computers.
   Net rose to a record $170.7 million, or 84 cents a share,
from $99.3 million, or 53 cents a share, a year earlier.
Revenue rose 30% to a record $968.3 million from $747.3
million.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The latest period adds to a series of winning quarters for
the Santa Clara, Calif., chip maker, which saw earnings
increases of 43% and 48% in the previous two quarters.
"They're clearly riding pretty high right now," said Millard
Phelps, an analyst with Hambrecht & Quist. Intel's net was
several cents a share greater than most analysts had
predicted, he said. Analysts expect revenue to surpass $1
billion in the current quarter.</p>
<p>The source of Intel's booming growth is its 80386 and
80486 microprocessors, the "brain" chips that computer makers
are building into some of today's most powerful, and most
popular, personal computers. Intel is the only company that
makes the chips, so it doesn't compete with Japanese or U.S.
companies in an otherwise fierce chip market.</p>
<p>What's more, demand for those chips, which carry fat
profit margins, is so strong that Intel has had to allocate
them among customers, and doesn't expect to be able to catch
up with demand until year end. Earlier this year Intel
expected to meet the demand by the summer. Intel has delayed
closing an old chip plant and is increasing production in
other facilities.</p>
<p>Chip profits overshadowed problems in Intel's computer
business in the quarter. Factories making personal computers
had quality problems early in the period, but the problems
were solved, Intel said. And analysts said they were
surprised by Intel's huge interest income in the quarter,
$44.8 million vs. last year's $15.7 million.</p>
<p>Fat profits are almost run-of-the mill for Intel now.
"Expectations were generally very high," said analyst William
Tai at Alex. Brown & Sons Inc. "Had they not shown very
strong growth it would have been extremely disappointing."
Despite the better-than-expected earnings, which included a
$17 million pretax gain on sold assets, Intel's stock fell 75
cents a share in national over-the-counter trading yesterday
to $50.50 a share.</p>
<p>Mr. Tai said he expects Intel to see several more healthy
quarters. Still, he said, shortages can quickly turn to
ruinous oversupplies. In times of shortage, users tend to
hoard chips, but sometimes quickly unload their inventory and
cause a glut.</p>
