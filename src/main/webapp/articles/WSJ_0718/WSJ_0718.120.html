	<p class="article-leader">A federal judge in Atlanta ruled that a black woman who
had been fired by the Internal Revenue Service hadn't been
discriminated against by her supervisor, who is also black.
   In a case that has been closely watched by attorneys and
civil-rights groups, the employee had charged that the
supervisor, who is dark-skinned, was biased against
light-skinned blacks.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The case began in March 1986, when Tracy L. Morrow, now 27
years old, lost her job as a clerk-typist at the local tax
office. The IRS said Ms. Morrow performed poorly; Ms. Morrow
countered that her supervisor had harassed and ultimately
fired her out of prejudice against blacks with light skin.</p>
<p>At the trial last January, Ms. Morrow testified that her
supervisor had made derogatory remarks about her skin color,
allegedly saying: "You need some sun" and "You've had it too
easy."</p>
<p>In his decision on Monday, however, U.S. District Judge
Charles A. Moye Jr. rejected Ms. Morrow's arguments, saying
the IRS had provided "ample evidence" that Ms. Morrow "may
have been insubordinate, immature, impatient, disrespectful
and unmanageable."</p>
<p>Regarding the alleged remarks about skin color, Judge Moye
said that Ms. Morrow didn't "prove that {such comments} were
uttered for any reason other than the personal animosity {the
women} might have had for each other." A personality conflict
alone, the judge said, "doesn't establish invidious
discrimination."</p>
<p>Stephen Katz, an attorney representing Ms. Morrow, faulted
the ruling for not providing "direction on how you're
supposed to prove" an intraracial discrimination case. "What
kind of comments indicate color bias?" Mr. Katz asked. "What
kind of actions?"</p>
<p>The case was beneficial, Mr. Katz added, in that it
highlighted the problem of intraracial bias. "It's something
companies are going to have to be aware of," he said.</p>
<p>Ms. Morrow, who hasn't decided whether to appeal, was
"very disappointed" with the ruling, but is "resolved to get
on with her life," Mr. Katz said. "Obviously, she's not going
to return to government service -- ever."</p>

<p>INSURANCE COMPANY accuses chemical firm's lawyers of
ethics violations.</p>
<p>Travelers Indemnity Co. of Hartford alleged in court
papers yesterday that the lawyers for Stauffer Chemical Co.
tried to prevent potential witnesses from testifying in a
lawsuit concerning who should pay for the cleanup of toxic
waste.</p>
<p>Lawyers for Stauffer said they couldn't comment because
they hadn't seen the court papers. They said the company
named in the suit is now a unit of ICI Americas Inc. of
Wilmington, Del., and is now called Stauffer Management Co.
They said that a company currently called Stauffer Chemical
Co. isn't involved in the suit.</p>
<p>The Travelers Corp. unit, a plaintiff in the case, said
that the lawyers for Stauffer sent letters to at least 58
former employees. In the letters, former employees were urged
to call Stauffer lawyers at the Wilmington law firm of
Morris, Nichols, Arsht & Tunnell, the Washington law firm of
Kirkpatrick & Lockhart, or the Philadelphia law firm of
Morgan, Lewis & Bockius if they were contacted by any of the
insurance companies.</p>
<p>Travelers says the letters created the mistaken impression
that the former employees might be targets of the litigation
and contained an offer to provide them with free counsel in
the hopes of preventing harmful evidence from surfacing
during private interviews with the insurer's investigators.</p>
<p>Legal ethics experts Stephen Gillers of New York
University School of Law and Geoffrey C. Hazard, Jr., of Yale
Law School submitted affidavits stating that they believe the
letters violate the ethics rule that prohibits lawyers from
suggesting that someone other than a client refrain from
voluntarily giving relevant information in a case. The rule
is designed to ensure that lawyers have access to information
necessary to prepare a case for trial.</p>
<p>Travelers, along with National Union Fire Insurance Co. of
Pittsburgh and American Motorists Insurance Co. of Long
Grove, Ill., sued Stauffer in state court in Delaware in
1987. The insurers are seeking a declaration that they have
no obligation to pay Stauffer's bill for cleaning up toxic
waste at the Tybouts Corner landfill in New Castle County,
Del., because the company knowingly polluted the site.</p>
<p>Former employees can be key potential witnesses in such
disputes because they often provide important information
about toxic waste disposal practices at the company over time
and are less constrained from talking candidly than current
employees.</p>
<p>If the court finds that Stauffer's lawyers violated
professional ethics rules, "it will affect how these cases
are conducted in the future," says Barry Ostrager of Simpson,
Thacher & Bartlett, a lawyer for Travelers.</p>
<p>Travelers has asked the court to require Stauffer to
contact all former employees who received letters and to
advise them that they are free to speak to the insurers and
that Stauffer's offer of counsel is withdrawn.</p>
<p>On May 29, Judge Vincent J. Poppiti, who is hearing the
case, found that Travelers investigators had violated
Delaware's professional rules of conduct. Mr. Ostrager said
that Travelers has also asked the judge to reconsider his
ruling based on affidavits submitted by Messrs. Gillers and
Hazard.</p>

<p>MORGAN STANLEY names Lacovara to senior posts.</p>
<p>Philip A. Lacovara, 47 years old, was named general
counsel and secretary of Morgan Stanley Group Inc. Mr.
Lacovara also was named a managing director and member of the
management committee of the New York securities firm's
broker-dealer subsidiary, Morgan Stanley & Co.</p>
<p>Since 1988, Mr. Lacovara has been vice president, senior
counsel for litigation and legal policy at General Electric
Co. He was one of a group of lawyers recruited by Benjamin W.
Heineman Jr., senior vice president, general counsel of GE,
in an effort to build a strong in-house legal staff. Mr.
Lacovara's departure from GE is scheduled for Sept. 15. "This
is just an indication of the quality of people who have come
to GE," Mr. Heineman said.</p>
<p>Mr. Lacovara was partner in charge of the Washington
office of Hughes Hubbard & Reed before joining GE, and was
counsel to the Watergate special prosecutor.</p>
<p>Mr. Lacovara called the position at Morgan Stanley "a
wonderful opportunity to join the premier investment banking
firm." He envisions his responsibilities to include global
strategic planning, legislative and regulatory duties and
"trying to assess the environment that financial services
firms will be facing in the U.S. and abroad," including the
legal, regulatory and structural environments.</p>
<p>As general counsel and secretary at Morgan Stanley, Mr.
Lacovara will be assuming responsibilities that had been
covered by Ned Sachs, who was named head of Morgan Stanley's
finance, administration and operations division in Europe
nearly a year ago. Mr. Sachs has been handling those
responsibilities in addition to his new position.</p>

<p>HEAVYWEIGHT BOXING case pitting King and champ is settled.</p>
<p>Don King, the flamboyant boxing promoter, and James
"Buster" Douglas, the heavyweight champion, agreed to settle
a suit claiming that Mr. King had breached his promotion
contract with Mr. Douglas.</p>
<p>The settlement of the case in federal court in New York
appears to be a boon to Mr. King, who had much to lose in his
contract disputes with Mr. Douglas, and to Las Vegas
hotel-casino owner Steve Wynn.</p>
<p>Had the jury decided against Mr. King, the agreement that
gives him exclusive right to promote three more of Mr.
Douglas's fights would have been set aside. Mr. King, who
customarily gets about a 20% cut of fight profits, could have
lost millions of dollars as a result.</p>
<p>Under the terms of the settlement, Mr. King said he will
step aside as promoter for one fight to allow Mr. Douglas to
fight at Mr. Wynn's Mirage casino-hotel in Las Vegas in
September. Mr. King will be paid an unspecified amount as
part of the arrangement, under which Mr. Douglas is
guaranteed $25 million for his first title defense.</p>
<p>Mr. King said after that bout he resumes his role as
promoter for Mr. Douglas for two more fights, the first a
rematch against Mike Tyson, who lost the title last February
in Tokyo. Also, Messrs. Douglas and Wynn agreed to drop their
separate Nevada lawsuit to get Mr. King's promotional
contract with Mr. Douglas declared invalid, Mr. Wynn said.</p>
<p>Mr. Douglas claimed that Mr. King breached the contract
when he protested that Mr. Douglas was wrongly saved from a
knockout by a count that went beyond 10 seconds in the Tokyo
bout. Soon after, Mr. Douglas, saying he would not fight for
Mr. King, agreed to fight at Mr. Wynn's casino.</p>
<p>Lawyers for Messrs. Douglas and Wynn had hammered away at
Mr. King's credibility during the trial, claiming he was
lying about his motives for protesting the long count. But
four jurors interviewed after the settlement said they were
leaning in Mr. King's favor.</p>
<p>"Absolutely, it is a vindication and a victory," Mr. King
proclaimed outside the federal courtroom in New York, where
his trial was about to enter its third week.</p>
