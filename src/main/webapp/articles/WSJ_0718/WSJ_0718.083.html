	<p class="article-leader">ASDA Group PLC of Britain, a major supermarket chain,
reported that pretax profit for the year ended April 28 fell
27% to #180 million ($324.4 million) from #247 million a year
earlier, hurt by soft consumer demand and expenses related to
the purchase of 60 Gateway superstores and the setup of a new
distribution system.
   Still, the result was at the upper end of market
forecasts, which had ranged between #160 million and #185
million. Profit after taxes and minority interests but before
extraordinary items also fell 27% to #122.6 million from
#167.6 million. And per-share earnings dropped 27% to 10.13
pence from 13.82 pence.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The latest results included an extraordinary gain of #86.7
million related to disposals to pay for the Gateway
acquisitions; the year-earlier period hadn't any special
items. Profit attributable to shareholders, after taxes and
extraordinary items, improved 25% to #209.3 million from
#167.6 million.</p>
<p>Sales rose 31% to #3.55 billion from #2.71 billion.</p>
