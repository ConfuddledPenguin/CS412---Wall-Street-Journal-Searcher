	<p class="article-leader">Over-the-counter stocks bore the brunt of investors' fears
about earnings after exchange-listed United
Telecommunications startled investors with
lower-than-expected earnings.
   The Nasdaq Composite Index tumbled 5.12 to 464.48, a 1.1%
decline, in heavy trading of 167.8 million shares, up from
138.1 million Monday. The Nasdaq Industrial Index tumbled
from its recent highs in a 5.95 drop to 504.66 as investors
took profits in better-performing OTC stocks.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The Nasdaq Utility Index plunged 2.1%, or 13.21 to 642.10,
as the United Telecommunications news made investors skittish
about other telecommunications issues.</p>
<p>MCI Communications, which comprises a 22% weighting of the
Utility Index, fell 1 5/8 to 38 3/8 on nearly 8.6 million
shares and traded as low as 37 1/4 and as high as 40 1/8
during the day.</p>
<p>OTC stocks "see-sawed all day," said William A. Rothe,
head of OTC trading at Alex. Brown & Sons, Baltimore. "They'd
take them down and then turn them on a dime and take them
back up just as fast," he said. Mr. Rothe added that he
thinks the failure of the Dow Jones Industrial Average to
sustain a push above the 3000 level prompted investors to
take profits in some of the better-quality OTC names included
in the Nasdaq Industrial Index.</p>
<p>Intel fell 3/4 to 50 1/2, but swung between a high of 52
and a low of 50 1/4. The Santa Clara, Calif., semiconductor
maker reported second quarter net income of 84 cents a share,
up from 53 cents a year earlier.</p>
<p>Also under pressure were shares of Apple Computer, which
fell 1 3/8 to 44 1/4 on 1.2 million shares. Cowen & Co.
analyst Michele S. Preston said in an interview that
investors are skittish about comments due late today by the
Cupertino, Calif., computer maker after it reports earnings
for the third quarter ended in June.</p>
<p>Ms. Preston said she expects Apple to earn about 90 cents
a share, up from 74 cents a year earlier, and doesn't expect
any surprises. Apple officials have been cautious about the
outlook for the remainder of the year as the company plans to
introduce a new, low-priced Macintosh computer, she
explained. However, she noted that previously the company has
surprised investors by reporting earnings in line with
expectations but then warning of an uncertain outlook. A
conference call among analysts and Apple officials is
scheduled for 5 p.m. Eastern time today, she said.</p>
<p>Investors continued to punish stocks of companies with
poor earnings outlooks.</p>
<p>Weitek skidded 4 to 15 1/2 on 1.9 million shares, or more
than 15 times average volume, and was one of the day's most
active stocks. Analysts told Dow Jones Professional Investor
Report that officials of the Sunnyvale, Calif., maker of
high-performance integrated circuits indicated Monday they're
pessimistic about winning an important new contract from Sun
Microsystems.</p>
<p>Robertson Stephens & Co. analyst Michael J. Stark told
DJPIR that statement prompted him to lower his earnings
estimates for Weitek to $1.05 a share in 1990, from $1.10
previously, and $1.25 a share in 1991, from $1.42 before; the
company earned 81 cents a share in 1989. Dillon Read & Co.
analyst Lawrence W. Borgman said his 1990 estimate has been
$1.10 a share and that he expects to lower it to about $1.05
a share. But neither analyst changed his investment opinion
on the stock; Mr. Stark has a near-term "hold" and long-term
"buy" advisory, and Mr. Borgman says he will continue to rate
the stock "attractive."</p>
<p>Advanced Logic fell 2 1/4 to a bid of 11 3/4 after the
Irvine, Calif., maker of microcomputer systems said it
expects revenue for the third quarter ended June 30 of $2.5
million to $2.8 million, below second quarter net income of
$3.2 million but higher than year-earlier income of $700,000.</p>
<p>SofTech lost 1/4 to 2 7/8. Late Monday, the Waltham,
Mass., developer of software services and products revised
its earnings estimate for the fiscal year ended May 31 to a
loss of about 16 cents a share from a previously estimated
profit of seven to 11 cents a share, citing increased
software investments and delays in two military projects.
SofTech had 1989 net income of 46 cents a share.</p>
<p>Graphic Scanning fell 1 1/2 to 8 before the National
Association of Securities Dealers halted trading in the stock
pending an announcement early this morning. Investment firms
controlled by Mario Gabelli said in May they hold nearly a
44% position in the Englewood, N.J., communications-services
company.</p>
<p>Among the day's gainers, Class B shares of Adolph Coors
climbed 3/8 to 26 1/4 after the Golden, Colo., brewer
reported net income for the second quarter ended June 17 of
68 cents a share, up from 46 cents a year earlier.</p>
<p>Guy F. Atkinson rose 1 1/4 to 16 1/2 after the South San
Francisco, Calif. construction company said it expects to
receive $100 million in payments after settling five
construction contract disputes.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>PROPOSED LISTING STANDARDS REVISED: The National
Association of Securities Dealers, which has proposed higher
standards for the continued listing of stocks on Nasdaq, its
automated quotation system, said yesterday its board changed
several of the proposed requirements after reviewing more
than 80 responses to the plan.</p>
<p>Under the latest proposal, stocks can stay on Nasdaq if
they fall below $1 a share provided that the market value of
shares in public hands -- known as the "float" -- is at least
$1 million and the company has $2 million in equity. Under
the original plan, companies that failed to maintain a public
float of $200,000 or a minimum bid price of $1 for 10
consecutive days would be delisted and have to requalify with
a minimum $1 million public float and minimum bid of $3.</p>
<p>If approved by the Securities and Exchange Commission, the
latest proposals aren't expected to be effective until July
1, 1991, at the earliest-six months later than the originally
proposed effective date of Jan. 1. The delay is designed to
give companies time to comply with the latest version of the
standards, NASD said.</p>
