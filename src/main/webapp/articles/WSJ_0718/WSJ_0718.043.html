	<p class="article-leader">The top officers of Baptist Press, a prominent religious
news service used by nearly 500 newspapers and magazines
nationwide, were fired by the executive committee of the
Southern Baptist Convention, which owns the service.
   The dismissals of Al Shackleford, 58 years old, director
of the Nashville, Tenn.-based news service, and Dan Martin,
51, its editor, were made effective immediately after the
committee voted in closed session yesterday in Nashville. The
committee named no replacements for the two men, leaving the
43-year-old news service's future unclear.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>In June, the committee told the two men to resign by Sept.
30 or they would "be dealt with harshly." They refused. Last
week, the Associated Church Press -- representing 195
Protestant, Catholic and Eastern Orthodox publications --
wrote to Baptist officials urging them to retain Messrs.
Shackleford and Martin.</p>
<p>Although the committee offered no explanation for its
action, its chairman, Sam Pace of Lawton, Okla., earlier
issued a statement accusing Mr. Shackleford of bias against
fundamentalists, who recently wrested control of the Southern
Baptist Convention from a more moderate faction.
Fundamentalists believe the Bible is literally true in
matters of religion, science and history.</p>
