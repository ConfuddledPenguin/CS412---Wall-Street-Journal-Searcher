	<p class="article-leader">OTTAWA -- Canada's merchandise trade surplus widened to
958 million Canadian dollars (US$826.9 million) in May,
partly because of an increase in motor-vehicle exports to the
U.S., Statistics Canada, a government agency, said.
   In April, the surplus totaled C$371 million.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Exports of trucks and other motor vehicles to the U.S.
rose by C$367 million in May. The U.S. took 74% of the total
May exports and supplied 70.5% of Canada's imports.</p>
