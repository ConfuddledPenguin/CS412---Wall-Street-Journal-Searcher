	<p class="article-leader">BOSTON -- Massachusetts's highest court gave the go-ahead
for a new 5% sales tax on business services, including fees
of lawyers, accountants, engineers and architects.
   The Supreme Judicial Court, by a narrow 4-to-3 margin,
issued an advisory opinion saying that the legislature has
authority to levy the services tax. Gov. Michael S. Dukakis
had sought the opinion before signing the bill, approved
recently by the state House and Senate.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Despite the advisory opinion, critics of the new tax are
expected to file suit challenging it.</p>
<p>Opponents contend, among other things, that the state
constitution doesn't specifically permit a tax on services.
Aside from its constitutionality, opponents have said that
the tax would be bad for the state's economy.</p>
<p>But the court said that services can be considered
commodities, which are taxable under state law, because the
word commodities "is not limited to tangible personal
property." Dissenting justices argued, "Nothing but the most
strained interpretation of `commodities' can include the host
of services."</p>
<p>In a sign that it will consider challenges to the tax on
other grounds, the court acknowledged that "there are other
constitutional questions that have been or might be raised"
concerning the tax on particular services.</p>
<p>The legislature passed the services tax, along with
increased income taxes, to help offset a looming $1 billion
budget deficit.</p>
