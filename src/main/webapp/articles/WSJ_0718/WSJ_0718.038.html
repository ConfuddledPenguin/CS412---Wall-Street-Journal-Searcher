	<p class="article-leader">HOUSTON -- Cooper Industries Inc. said it retained the
investment banking firm of Dillon, Read & Co. to advise it on
the possible sale of its Arrow-Hart Components business.
   The electronic products manufacturing concern said the
sale would include manufacturing operations in the U.S. and
Plymouth, England, which have combined annual revenue of
about $25 million. Cooper acquired the operations in 1981
with the acquisition of Crouse-Hinds Co.</p>
