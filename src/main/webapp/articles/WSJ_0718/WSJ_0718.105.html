	<p class="article-leader">World oil prices generally held firm despite expectations
that they might decline substantially in the wake of recent
run-ups.
   Crude oil prices did fall sharply in U.S. futures trading
yesterday morning. But they rebounded in the afternoon to end
the day mixed with near-month crude contracts only slightly
lower.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The August crude contract was down two cents a barrel on
the New York Mercantile Exchange to settle at $18.65 after
dropping to a low of $18.11 during the day. Crude futures for
September delivery settled eight cents lower at $19.77 a
barrel.</p>
<p>On the assumption a correction was overdue, many traders
had expected major price drops in the August and September
crudes after the gains of $2 a barrel in the prior six
trading sessions. But prices were kept relatively firm by a
widespread belief that burdensome U.S. crude oil inventories
are shrinking and by the continuing euphoria over
developments in the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries.</p>
<p>After futures trading had closed for the day, the American
Petroleum Institute released its latest weekly report on U.S.
oil statistics. The report showed that inventories of crude
oil and gasoline rose last week, by 4.7 million barrels and
two million barrels, respectively, rather than declining as
expected.</p>
<p>Oil analysts agreed these were bearish figures. But
several said they are likely to have only a moderate effect
on the bullishness emerging over the expected outcome of next
week's OPEC meetings.</p>
<p>As the result of last week's pledges by Kuwait and the
United Arab Emirates to reduce production to quota levels,
OPEC is widely expected to freeze its production ceiling near
the current 22.1 million barrels a day and reduce total
output to 23 million barrels a day or less for the remainder
of the third quarter. Many analysts expect this to restore
balance to supply and demand for OPEC oil.</p>
<p>Iraq President Saddam Hussein, who has been aggressively
pressuring Kuwait and the Emirates to cut their
overproduction, helped bolster world oil prices again
yesterday with new threats to deal with force with OPEC
members violating their production quotas.</p>
<p>"With Iraq flexing its muscles in OPEC, there is a return
to the policies of the early 1980s with the emphasis on
prices rather than on market shares," said Peter Beutel, an
oil specialist with Merrill Lynch Futures.</p>
<p>In other markets yesterday:</p>
<p>GRAINS and SOYBEANS: Prices of corn futures contracts
continued to slide amid good growing weather. So far this
month, the value of some corn futures contracts have dropped
about 15%. Some crop analysts are beginning to edge up their
harvest estimates. Katharina Zimmer, an analyst at Merrill
Lynch, New York, has been forecasting a 7.7 billion bushel
corn crop. However, she said the weather in the Midwest is
increasing the possibility of a 7.85 billion bushel harvest.
The good growing weather is also at least partly responsible
for an anemic export market. Foreign buyers aren't in any
rush to acquire U.S. corn because there is little indication
so far that any shortages might develop at harvest. What's
more, there are widespread reports that the Soviet Union, one
of the biggest buyers of U.S. crops, is continuing to have
difficulty paying its bills for imports. Analysts aren't sure
whether U.S. corn prices might drop further. Despite this
month's weather in the Midwest, the corn crop is unusually
vulnerable. Because wet weather this spring delayed the
growing season, much of the corn crop is only beginning to go
through its critical pollination stage. In many of the
biggest corn-producing states, pollination normally has
peaked by now. The late growing season makes the crop more
susceptible to summer heat waves and fall frosts. Outside the
major corn-producing states in the Midwest, the crop is
facing other problems. The south Texas crop, which is one of
the first to be harvested in the U.S., could face its second
outbreak of aflatoxin in two years. Aflatoxin is a poison
that is excreted by a fungus under drought conditions. Last
year, much of the corn crop in the region had to be destroyed
or diverted to livestock use because it contained levels too
dangerous for human consumption. Because of dry weather
earlier this season, state and federal officials are
preparing to sample the crop for aflatoxin in the next few
weeks. In the Southeast, dry conditions earlier this season
have already forced some farmers to abandon their fields.</p>
<p>ORANGE JUICE: Futures prices declined. The July contract,
which will cease trading today, ended with a loss of 2.60
cents a pound at $1.8695. September, the most active month,
was off 1.90 cents to $1.7840. Analysts said traders will be
closely watching the last day of activity in the July
contract. "It could be a very volatile session," one analyst
said. Only 97 notices have been issued for the delivery of
the concentrate against the July contract. As of the
beginning of trading yesterday, the July open interest, or
the number of contracts that remain to be nullified by an
opposite trade or fulfilled by delivery of concentrate, was
1,670 contracts. Despite active liquidation yesterday, which
depressed prices, the number of contracts outstanding is
expected to remain the largest on the last trading day that
traders and analysts can recall. For the most part, analysts
said, processors are holders of contracts calling for them to
take delivery of the commodity because the price of the
future is well below the cash-market quotation. On the other
hand, most "shorts," or traders who sold in anticipation that
prices would go lower, are speculators. However, prices never
fell as much as speculators anticipated, an analyst said.</p>
<p>PRECIOUS METALS: Futures prices eased. August delivery
gold ended at $363, down $1.50 an ounce. September silver
declined 3.5 cents an ounce to $4.8680. October platinum was
off $2.50 an ounce at $479.30. August gold was under some
pressure early in the morning, in part because the Dow Jones
Industrial Average at that time was trading over 3000 and
also because there was a spate of selling in silver by
speculators and local traders that produced a sympathetic
reaction in gold, according to analysts. August gold traded
as low as $361.60. In the afternoon, however, the industrial
average slipped below 3000, which appeared to give some lift
to precious metals, analysts said. Mostly, analysts said,
traders were waiting for Federal Reserve Chairman Alan
Greenspan's semiannual testimony before the Senate Banking
Committee today, in which he will outline the central bank's
monetary policy. "It's more like waiting for the second shoe
to drop," said one analyst, noting Mr. Greenspan's testimony
last week, that the Fed was poised to ease its monetary
policy, caused precious metals prices to surge. "Traders want
to know if last Friday's cut in a key rate was a one-time
thing or whether there will be a further reduction," the
analyst said.</p>
