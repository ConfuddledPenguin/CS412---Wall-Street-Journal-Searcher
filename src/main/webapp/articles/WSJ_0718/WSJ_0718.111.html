	<p class="article-leader">Metropolitan Circuits Inc. said it would sell options to
buy as much as a 37.5% interest in the circuit-board maker to
two consultants if they are successful in raising new capital
for the cash-starved concern.
   Kenneth C. Cleveland and Paul G. McNamara also would
become the Santa Ana, Calif., company's top executives if
they raise "in the range of $2 million to $3.5 million"
within 30 days, said Richard J. Sandberg, chairman, president
and chief executive officer.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Mr. Sandberg said the funds would be used for working
capital and to pay about $1.5 million in overdue debts to
suppliers. The company has no bank debt, he said.</p>
<p>Mr. Cleveland, a crisis-management consultant, would
become chairman and chief executive officer, and Mr.
McNamara, former president of Aeroscientific, an Anaheim,
Calif., circuit-board maker, would be named president and
chief operating officer, if they obtain the financing. Mr.
Sandberg would relinquish those titles and become vice
chairman.</p>
