	<p class="article-leader">ROME -- Hourly wages in Italy rose an average of 3% in May
from April and were up 7.8% from a year earlier, the state
statistics bureau Istat said.
   Istat attributed the sharp monthly increase to the
automatic indexation for inflation in all wages covered by
collective bargaining procedures.</p>
