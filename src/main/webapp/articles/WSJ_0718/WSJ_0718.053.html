	<p class="article-leader">Thank you for your wonderful May 18 page-one piece on our
company ("Off the Dole: How Private Company Helps Welfare
Clients Find and Keep Jobs"). The response has been
excellent. First, the state of New York has found the funding
to keep the company going. Second, we have had responses from
hundreds of interested officials, businesses and citizens
requesting information and pledging their support. Third, it
has led to a host of other media coverage: MacNeil/Lehrer
Reports, American Management Association, Continental
Magazine, ABC News and 60 Minutes.
   None of this would have been possible without the special
abilities of your reporter Ellen Graham. We happen to deal
with many media people. It is often difficult for them to
grasp the complex interrelationship of the business, policy
and humanistic aspects of what we do. Her insights, sensitive
questions and persistence were very unusual.</p>

company could have continued.</p>
