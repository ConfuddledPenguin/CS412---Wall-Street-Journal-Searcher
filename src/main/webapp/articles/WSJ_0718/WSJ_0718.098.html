	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- The Senate Finance Committee voted to
endorse the Bush administration's recent initiatives to give
the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe greater access to Western
technology.
   But at the same time, the panel acted to restrict China's
access to technology that the country could use to construct
missiles and stockpile chemical weapons. And the committee
voted to deny Iraq, an alleged human-rights violator, the
right to buy U.S. weapons and munitions or to seek credits
from the U.S. Export-Import Bank and Commodity Credit Corp.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>These proposed measures are part of a bill to renew the
Export Administration Act for two more years. The bill was
sent to the Senate floor by a voice vote. The House already
has approved its own agenda for revising export controls.</p>
<p>The Senate version supports trade liberalization for the
East generally at the pace urged by the administration and
endorsed by the U.S. and its allies at a high-level meeting
in Paris in the spring. Commerce Secretary Robert Mosbacher
said in a letter to the committee that the administration
supports the bill's basic provisions on Eastern Europe.</p>
<p>The bill, however, departs from stated administration
policy in taking a tougher stance on China and in expanding
controls on exports of missile technology to countries
suspected of having warlike intentions.</p>
<p>The committee also voted 15-6 to adopt an amendment that
would authorize the Ex-Im Bank to help finance the sale of
U.S. weapons and defense services to members of the North
Atlantic Treaty Organization and Japan.</p>
<p>John Macomber, the bank's chairman, warned the committee
against hastily authorizing such a "fundamental
reorientation" of the bank's programs, which have focused
exclusively on financing sales of non-defense products.
However, the panel was swayed by pleas by the amendment's
sponsors, Sens. Christopher Dodd (D., Conn.) and Christopher
Bond (R., Mo.), that the U.S. defense industry needs such
help to avert further layoffs.</p>
<p>The Export Administration Act, which expires Sept. 30, is
the legal basis for the administration to establish or modify
its policies for controlling the export of so-called dual-use
technology, or products with both civilian and military
applications. While the administration has already taken most
of the steps in the Senate bill, the export act needs to be
revised to sanction the changes.</p>
<p>The bill urges the administration to give "most favorable
treatment" to proposed sales of telecommunications equipment
to Poland, Czechoslovakia and Hungary. This provision is
intended to avert unreasonable delays in the granting of
licenses for such transactions. The bill also urges speedier
action on those countries' requests to purchase software for
computer networks.</p>
<p>The bill would require the U.S. to recognize by Dec. 31,
1991, a "license-free zone" encompassing the U.S., its allies
and some neutral but cooperating nations. The proposal would
effectively free U.S. exporters from the need to apply for a
license to ship any dual-use product to any of those other
countries. The Commerce Department already has lifted most
licensing requirements for trade with NATO countries, Japan
and Australia.</p>
