	<p class="article-leader">Brandon Tartikoff, the programming wizard who led National
Broadcasting Co. to ratings supremacy through the 1980s, was
named to the new position of chairman of NBC Entertainment
Group.
   As part of a general restructuring at the network's
Burbank, Calif.-based entertainment operations, Mr.
Tartikoff's longtime No. 2 executive, Warren Littlefield, was
named president of NBC Entertainment, succeeding Mr.
Tartikoff. Mr. Littlefield will have day-to-day
responsibility for major programming decisions in the
network's daytime, prime-time, late-night and children's
television operations.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>NBC said Mr. Tartikoff, 41 years old, will focus on the
expansion of NBC Productions, the in-house unit that produces
prime-time series, miniseries and made-for-television movies.
NBC Productions has yet to produce a successful prime-time
series. Mr. Tartikoff will also concentrate on "the
development of other alliances and outlets for the creation
and distribution of NBC programming," according to a network
statement. NBC aims ultimately to produce and sell shows to
other networks including overseas TV networks.</p>
<p>In a telephone interview, Mr. Tartikoff said that after 10
years at the helm of NBC Entertainment he had "diminished
interest" in the job. "We're all human and we all need new
things," he said, adding he began discussions for a new
position in January with Robert C. Wright, NBC's president
and chief executive officer.</p>
<p>"I also thought there was a parade of other opportunities
going by while I was stuck in meetings with producers," he
said. "Being head of a network entertainment division is not
a gold watch job. I kept hearing the same show ideas over and
over, and I kept feeling deja vu."</p>
<p>The executive changes come as NBC continues its prime-time
leadership for the fifth consecutive year, although its
winning margin has narrowed. NBC's audience for the 1989-90
season fell 9% from a year ago, and it hasn't produced a
breakthrough hit for several years. More disturbing to NBC is
that the network's audience slipped by 13% in demographic
groups that advertisers want to attract. The network has a
projected $200 million shortfall in advertising revenue
because of the declining ratings.</p>
<p>"I'm aware we were slipping," Mr. Littlefield, 38, said in
an interview. Referring to the network's trademark, Mr.
Littlefield said: "The peacock has ruffled feathers. But
there's a great challenge and that excites me."</p>
<p>Mr. Tartikoff's withdrawal from day-to-day operations at
NBC Entertainment is a radical departure for the
boyish-looking, tough-talking executive. He is known to carry
around the prime-time schedule at all times, constantly
fiddling with it. But Mr. Littlefield said he, not Mr.
Tartikoff, will make the decisions. "I wouldn't have taken
the job unless I had the authority to run the division," he
said. "I made that clear in all my discussions."</p>
<p>Mr. Littlefield's contract expires in August, and Mr.
Tartikoff and Mr. Wright, the NBC president, assured Mr.
Littlefield that he shouldn't look outside the General
Electric Co. unit for a job. "They said they would make it
work," Mr. Littlefield said.</p>
<p>Mr. Littlefield said he will consult with Mr. Tartikoff on
programming matters, much in the same way Mr. Tartikoff
solicited opinions from Grant A. Tinker when Mr. Tinker was
chairman and president of NBC.</p>
<p>As part of the NBC Entertainment restructuring, Perry
Simon, who headed NBC's comedy series development, succeeds
Mr. Littlefield as executive vice president of prime-time
programs. And John Agoglia was named president of NBC
Enterprises while continuing as executive vice president of
NBC Productions.</p>
