	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Three securities firms fired the opening
earnings shots in what is expected to be the first profitable
quarter for Wall Street in nine months.
   Merrill Lynch & Co., boosted by a surge in investment
banking, reported a 5.6% rise in second-quarter net income
and a 13% increase in profit from continuing operations.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>PaineWebber Group Inc. posted a 2.9% drop in profit but
had a 6.1% gain in per-share earnings because of a stock
buy-back program. And Charles Schwab Corp., parent of the
discount brokerage firm, reported a 14% increase in net.</p>
<p>After Merrill's results were announced, Michael Goldstein,
an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., boosted his
full-year estimate of Merrill's earnings to $1.95 a share
from $1.45. He called the company's stock "attractive for
both value investors and those anticipating favorable equity
market conditions." But some analysts remain unimpressed,
arguing that the cyclical downtrend in most areas of the
securities industry will continue to dog Wall Street.</p>
<p>"Although the tone of the reports is better than expected,
the bottom line is that the main {securities} businesses
still tend to be weak," says Dean Eberling, an analyst at
Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc.</p>
<p>The modest gains nevertheless were a welcome relief on
Wall Street. That's because as a group, brokerage firms are
believed to have become profitable in the second quarter
after posting pretax losses of $486 million for the first
period and $91.7 million for the 1989 fourth quarter.</p>
<p>In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday,
Merrill rose 62.5 cents to $25.125 a share, PaineWebber fell
25 cents to $19.25, and Charles Schwab closed unchanged at
$16.</p>
<p>In the latest period, Merrill had net of $74.1 million, or
64 cents a share, up from $70.2 million, or 62 cents a share,
a year earlier. Many analysts had expected its per-share net
to be 34 cents to 40 cents. The year-earlier period included
$4.5 million, or four cents a share, from discontinued
operations of the firm's real estate unit, which was shed in
the 1989 third quarter. Revenue fell 1.1% to $2.87 billion
from $2.9 billion.</p>
<p>Merrill's results were boosted by an 8% increase in
investment banking revenue and a 14% jump in asset management
and custodial fee business. The investment banking business
was propped up by corporate underwriting and advisory fee
services, including a $2.25 billion issue for Walt Disney Co.</p>
<p>Daniel P. Tully, president and chief operating officer,
said Merrill has several investment banking deals in the
pipeline that will be announced within 30 days. And Thomas
Patrick, Merrill's chief financial officer, said he expects
investment banking business in the third quarter to run at a
"little better pace."</p>
<p>The firm's cost-cutting is starting to make a dent in
expenses. Operating expenses excluding insurance fell 4%, and
total expenses eased 1% to $2.75 billion.</p>
<p>"They did chip away at them a bit, but expense levels are
still way too high," says Lawrence Eckenfelder, an analyst at
Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. "I don't have a lot of
confidence that they'll come down significantly further."</p>
<p>"They can't have it both ways," counters Mr. Tully, noting
Merrill's higher earnings. "We believe our trends are in the
right direction on the expense side," Mr. Tully says,
although he adds that there's "still a lot of work to be
done."</p>
<p>PaineWebber had net of $14.6 million, or 35 cents a share,
compared with $15.1 million, or 33 cents a share. Revenue
increased 8% to $468.2 million from $433 million.</p>
<p>PaineWebber's results were aided by a 73% revenue spurt in
trading for its own account, particularly in the bond and
international stock areas. But reduced revenue from merchant
banking and a jump in the cost of settling lawsuits offset
the trading gains, said Donald B. Marron, chairman and chief
executive officer.</p>
<p>Expenses -- bloated by expansion of PaineWebber's futures
and options business and its recruitment of top brokers --
rose 9% to $445 million.</p>
<p>Charles Schwab's net rose to $4.8 million, or 17 cents a
share, from $4.2 million, or 15 cents a share.</p>
