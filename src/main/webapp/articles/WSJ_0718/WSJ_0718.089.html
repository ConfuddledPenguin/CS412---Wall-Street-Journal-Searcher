	<p class="article-leader">PORTLAND, Ore. -- Home for Danny Julian is a sleeping bag
beside a smoldering campfire under a concrete highway
viaduct. Around him, a half-dozen others have set up
housekeeping in caves burrowed into the dirt embankment. "It
can get pretty loud," says Mr. Julian, as trucks roar by
overhead. "But it's better than getting pneumonia in the
rain."
   Two months ago, city and state workers moved in with
cranes and dump trucks to rout the homeless and level their
campsites after officials decided the camps had become a
public safety problem. Heat from the fires was weakening
bridge supports, and the smoke was leading to accidents on
the highways overhead. Some of the campers also had been
dismantling highway drainage and lighting systems, selling
the parts to scrap yards.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Portland's campaign was costly, controversial and far from
a complete success. Mr. Julian was back under the state
highway viaduct within weeks. Other homeless men and women
gradually drifted back to other campsites demolished in the
citywide cleanup. "I'll go back to that bridge until they
throw me in jail," says Douglas Chandler, 46, who says he has
lived for more than two years under a state highway bridge in
a spot called Sullivan Gulch.</p>
<p>The nooks and crannies of the nation's transportation
system have become the shelter of last resort for the
nation's growing ranks of homeless people. As more and more
seek refuge under highways, along rail lines, in terminals
and on city subway cars, transportation systems are
struggling with service disruptions, traveler complaints,
lawsuits, injuries and even deaths.</p>
<p>Moreover, the situation is driving the public away from
mass transit. Urban commuters, fearful of possible violence
and tired of running a gauntlet of panhandlers, are curbing
their use of city subways and buses. New York City transit
officials estimate that the homeless in the city's subway
stations and trains cost the city's subway system 37,000
riders a day.</p>
<p>"We are, in effect, abandoning our mass transit facilities
and allowing them to become unofficial shelters for the
homeless," says Alan Sutherland, executive director of the
National Organization of Travelers Aid Societies in
Washington, a group that helps stranded travelers. Mr.
Sutherland, who also was an official at public and private
homeless agencies, estimates the homeless population at
750,000, triple that of a decade ago.</p>
<p>Transportation executives say the burden is crippling
transit systems already struggling with budget shortages,
aging equipment and crime. "I thought we were supposed to be
the alternative to dirty air, highway congestion and
dependency on foreign oil," says Robert Kiley, chairman of
New York's Metropolitan Transportation Authority. Clearly
angered, he says it is too much to also ask transit systems
to provide shelter to the homeless.</p>
<p>But advocates for the homeless say that allowing them to
camp in transportation facilities is only humane. "If it's a
choice between homeless people living in transit facilities
or dying on the street, they should live in transit
facilities," argues George McDonald, president of Doe Fund
Inc., a group taking its name from a homeless "Jane Doe" who
froze to death after eviction from New York's Grand Central
Terminal in 1984.</p>
<p>Advocates for the homeless also say the problem will
persist as long as the shortage of affordable housing,
crime-free emergency shelters, mental-hospital beds and drug
treatment facilities. "A lot of money has been wasted trying
to chase people from transportation facilities," says Keith
Summa, a consultant to the Coalition for the Homeless.
"People who sleep there have few other choices."</p>
<p>Nonetheless, many state and municipal authorities say the
problem has become a crisis, and they are taking ever more
aggressive measures to combat it. Philadelphia is considering
closing its subway system at night, partly to stop homeless
people from sleeping in stations. To prevent the homeless
from camping in bathrooms at one downtown train station, it
recently hired a porter and matron there, at a cost of
$70,000 a year. Seattle officials say the city's new bus
stations will have granite benches that make lying down
uncomfortable, and for similar reasons won't have bathrooms.</p>
<p>California highway officials plan gradually to replace the
dense shrubbery that shelters some 2,000 people along
highways in Los Angeles with lower-growing varieties of
greenery. Officials rejected a suggestion that they install
varieties of noxious plants or spray areas with a sticky
substance, though apparently not because of qualms about the
homeless. "Our people have to work in those areas, too," says
James McCullough, a senior operations engineer at the
California Transportation Department.</p>
<p>Eviction still remains the most common response. "Most
cities are still in the emergency response mode," says Rita
Schwartz, an advisor on the homeless to the Port Authority of
New York and New Jersey. "They are shuffling the homeless
from one location to another and managing systems defensively
with barricades, locks and cops."</p>
<p>But transit systems may be restricted in using this
tactic. The American Civil Liberties Union has complained to
city and state transportation agencies in Oregon that they
are destroying personal property when they demolish the
camps. Stevie Remington, executive director of the ACLU of
Oregon, describes the agencies as "preying upon the most
vulnerable people, who have almost nothing."</p>
<p>In response, Oregon plans to post written notices in the
camps 10 days before the sweeps resume later this month. And
state highway workers will store the sleeping bags, tents and
other personal belongings of the homeless in plastic bags for
a month before disposing of them; the state has decided not
to keep the cardboard sheets the homeless use for bedding.</p>
<p>Portland officials say a concern for public safety left
the city no choice this spring but to evict the 200 people
who were encamped under its bridges and beside its railroad
tracks. The sites were littered with bottles, food
containers, mattresses and human excrement. City health
officials say the camps had become a breeding ground for
disease, drugs and violence.</p>
<p>So over a period of several weeks this spring, dump trucks
carted away load after load of debris and furnishings.
Massive steel gates were installed under some city bridges,
and daily police patrols were mobilized to prevent
resettlement.</p>
<p>Portland officials say the city made every effort to
handle the cleanup humanely. Volunteers dispensed coffee and
doughnuts; social workers offered to help the people find new
shelter. But the experience was, nonetheless, wrenching for
those evicted. "When the highway department takes everything
I own, it's really no different than if I go into someone's
house and take their stereo and furniture," says Mr. Julian.</p>
<p>Many of the homeless resisted the idea of finding other
shelter. Mr. Chandler, the man who vows to go back under the
bridge until he is arrested, says he avoids the crowded local
shelters because he can't stand "someone sleeping next to me,
breathing on my face. I got to the point," he says, "that
when I'm indoors, I feel like kicking out the windows."</p>
<p>But the tall, bearded man pays a high price for living
outdoors amid lice, fleas and pigeon droppings. "I know I
look like I've been beaten," he says, lifting a soiled shirt
retrieved from a dumpster to reveal a back covered with
dozens of bug bites.</p>
<p>Such campaigns are expensive. Portland's cost $150,000.
California highway officials say they spend up to $200,000
each year to clear out homeless campers from foliage along
Los Angeles freeways and repair the damaged fences, sprinkler
systems and bushes. Philadelphia estimates it will spend $1
million to seal off homeless hiding places under platforms in
a downtown railway station.</p>
<p>New York's Metropolitan Transportation Authority figures
the occupation of its transit facilities by homeless people
cost it $20 million last year in extra expenses and lost
passenger fares.</p>
<p>In no other city is the problem as acute as in New York,
where, authorities say, several thousand homeless people bed
down nightly in stations, tunnels and subway cars.
Confrontations between them and transit users or workers
occasionally turn violent. In February, a subway passenger
killed a homeless man who cursed, spit and punched him at a
New York subway station. Last year, 79 homeless people died
in the subways of New York City. Some were run over by trains
or electrocuted; others committed suicide or died of other
causes, including exposure, malnutrition or disease.</p>
<p>Commuters reflexively avoid the forms sprawled on benches,
sitting on staircases or walking through cars cup in hand.
"They sleep next to where they vomited," says New Yorker
Kenneth Marshall. "Almost every day there is a trickle of
urine on the wall. At least a couple days a week you will
find the remains of human excrement." Mr. Marshall says he
and his wife try to avoid the subways.</p>
<p>With one subway line, the "A Train," New York City transit
police last Sunday began ejecting the homeless when trains
reach the end of the line at 207th Street. Transit managers
say the presence of homeless people prevents cleaning crews
from doing their job. Next month the policy will be extended
to the "E train" that terminates at the World Trade Center.</p>
<p>New Yorkers don't see the vast majority of homeless, who
virtually melt into the subterranean darkness. At one subway
stop in Manhattan, two men sleep on a scaffold 15 feet above
the platform. At another station, a dozen people bed down in
an area between the tracks that is blackened by brake-shoe
dust.</p>
<p>Situated three feet from passing trains and the
electrified third rail, the camp is furnished with mattresses
-- one with a teddy bear perched on it -- sleeping bags, an
end table, a clothesline, and a three-foot house plant. (One
of the subway dwellers says they water it and take it above
ground for light once a day.) In a bid for privacy, someone
has hung blinds from a beam to block riders' view of his
camp. "Just because we're homeless doesn't mean we're
helpless," says Jamel Parker, a tunnel resident.</p>
<p>Five nights a week, a team of transit police roust the
homeless from their dens. Once a week, a cleaning crew in
disposable coveralls and face masks loads the contents of the
camps onto flatbed trains and puts infectious wastes into
special containers. Last year, crews collected 85 pounds of
hypodermic needles.</p>
<p>"We spray their stuff with bleach and water before we
touch it," says P.C. Taylor, a deputy superintendent. "Right
now our sprayers are down because we've been using them so
much." Each cleanup costs the MTA $10,000.</p>
<p>For transit workers, the work is frustrating. "We clean an
area and bag the refuse," says Mr. Taylor. "These people dump
the refuse on the tracks again to use the bags for bedding."
The debris draws rats, fuels track fires and trips emergency
gear causing trains to brake abruptly.</p>
<p>Camps sometimes are completely rebuilt by the time
cleaning crews return a week later. After one cleanup last
month, several homeless men and women ran alongside the
flatcars hauling away their possessions and managed to pull
off five or six mattresses.</p>
<p>New York's stepped-up enforcement program has reduced the
homeless population in some stations to its lowest level in
years. But the real test won't come until next winter, when
the cold drives the homeless to seek the warmth of subway
trains and stations.</p>
<p>Some transportation providers say the best way to lure the
homeless from facilities is to provide adequate shelters. The
Port Authority of New York and New Jersey has spent $1.3
million in the past two years to open two homeless centers
near its transit facilities. Stephen Berger, who recently
resigned as the Port Authority's executive director, says the
centers, which provide places to sit, wash, eat and sleep,
sharply cut the number of people living in its facilities.</p>
<p>"Ejecting the homeless from these places without providing
alternatives just moves them temporarily," says Peter Smith,
president of the Partnership for the Homeless Inc., an
advocacy group based in New York. "It's not only inhumane but
in the long run isn't effective."</p>
