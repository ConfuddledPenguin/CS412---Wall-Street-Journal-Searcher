	<p class="article-leader">"And those were the only two lies that you can remember
that you've told?"
   "I don't know. Other lies. I'm sure I have lied more than
that."</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"Have you lied 1,000 times, Mr. Boesky?"</p>
<p>"The answer is very simply, sir, I've lied more than
twice. I can't tell you how many times more than twice."</p>
<p>"Have you lied 900 times?"</p>
<p>So it went with Ivan Boesky's remarkable testimony in the
trial of former trader John Mulheren Jr. Mr. Boesky, the man
whose arbitrage depended on the slightest ticks in share
prices, swore he can't remember within $200 million how much
he was worth after his plea bargain. His memory had to be
"refreshed" about a past of trading suitcases of cash for
inside information. A confused jury convicted Mr. Mulheren on
four counts, none of them as serious as insider trading, but
was hopelessly deadlocked on 26 others.</p>
<p>Mr. Boesky's selective memory raises a question that also
wafts from several other recent federal prosecutions: What
obligation do prosecutors have to make sure their
plea-bargained witnesses tell the truth, the whole truth and
nothing but the truth? Legal appeals from several recent
convictions suggest that in some high-profile cases
prosecutors embraced false evidence by their witnesses.</p>
<p>Many of these cases were brought during the time Rudolph
Giuliani was U.S. attorney in Manhattan. His successor, Otto
Obermaier, declines to discuss specific cases, but says the
obligation on prosecutors is clear. "Prosecutors may never
utilize perjured testimony in support of attempting to obtain
a conviction." If perjury occurs, "where the case then goes
depends very much on who said what about whom and how
relevant it is to a particular issue in the case." If perjury
is on a minor issue, it "doesn't always warrant a reversal of
a conviction."</p>
<p>Mr. Obermaier acknowledges there's a risk with
plea-bargained witnesses. "As prosecutors, we must deal with
whoever has information," he says. "We just hope that the
deal we make is not Faustian."</p>
<p>To his credit, Mr. Obermaier recently took a doubly
unusual step. He not only indicted a former government
witness for perjury, he also signed the indictment himself.
The indicted witness is Anthony Guariglia, who was one of the
top officials at Wedtech, the South Bronx defense firm that
bribed government officials. He got a token sentence by
agreeing to testify against others, including Robert Wallach.</p>
<p>Mr. Wallach, best known as a friend of Edwin Meese, was
convicted under RICO. His supposed racketeering was mailing
two fraudulent bills for legal work for the firm. Mr.
Guariglia gave key evidence that the alleged fraud was that
the bills were actually prepayment for work Mr. Wallach would
do when he took some unnamed job at the Justice Department.</p>
<p>At the trial, prosecutors blocked efforts by Mr. Wallach's
lawyers to introduce evidence that Mr. Guariglia was a
frequent liar. There was excellent evidence that he had
committed perjury on the stand when he said he'd stopped his
high-stake casino gambling after he copped his plea with
prosecutors. Assistant U.S. attorneys argued that just
because Mr. Guariglia had signed gambling markers in Atlantic
City, this was not proof he'd gambled.</p>
<p>Mr. Obermaier disowned this absurd position after former
Federal Appeals Judge Robert Bork filed an appeal for Mr.
Wallach. Mr. Bork noted that reversal of a conviction "is
virtually automatic if the government knowingly uses perjured
testimony." Mr. Guariglia has now been indicted for perjury;
Mr. Wallach still faces six years in jail pending his appeal.</p>
<p>Mr. Obermaier's office is now drafting its response to an
appeal filed last week in another case that alleges perjury.
It took prosecutors three trials to convict GAF official
James Sherwin for paying trader Boyd Jefferies to manipulate
the price of Union Carbide stock. The case was odd because
Mr. Sherwin had no clear reason to want Union Carbide stock
nudged up one-eighth point to close at $22 several days
before GAF sold its Union Carbide shares.</p>
<p>Mr. Jefferies, fingered by Mr. Boesky for relatively minor
trading violations, said Mr. Sherwin asked him to manipulate
the share price. One of Mr. Jefferies's assistants, James
Melton, testified he called Mr. Sherwin to report that he had
bumped up the price as requested. Prosecutors said no phone
records were kept of the call. But just before the end of the
trial, defense lawyers found WATS-line records in an AT&T
underground vault. The records showed no such call to Mr.
Sherwin.</p>
<p>Mr. Sherwin's appeal, which will be argued by New York
lawyer Arthur Liman, calls testimony about the possibly
phantom phone call "outright perjury." It cites a Supreme
Court rule "not only that the prosecutor avoid soliciting
false testimony but that he not sit idly by and allow it to
go uncorrected when it is given."</p>
<p>The record of federal prosecutors in other complex
white-collar cases is not encouraging. The granddaddy case of
bad information driving abusive prosecutions came to be known
as the Giuliani Three -- Robert Freeman, Richard Wigton and
Timothy Tabor. Prosecutors took information given to them by
Martin Siegel, who admitted he swapped inside information for
$700,000 in cash from Mr. Boesky, to bust the investment
bankers in the glare of the cameras. After two years,
prosecutors admitted they had no case against Messrs. Wigton
and Tabor. They did extract the infamous "Your Bunny has a
good nose" mail-fraud plea from Mr. Freeman.</p>
<p>It's not clear whether the wrongful prosecution was due to
bad information peddled by Mr. Siegel or by overeager
prosecutors happy to assume Wall Street was riddled with
inside traders. Prosecutors admitted in court papers that
"certain errors" were caused by "the government's own
misunderstanding of information provided by Siegel."</p>
<p>The incentive to give testimony is strong. Mr. Boesky got
18 months and kept a huge fortune. Mr. Guariglia got five
months in a halfway house. Mr. Jefferies got community
service in Aspen teaching youngsters how to play golf. Mr.
Siegel got two months. In contrast, Drexel Burnham Lambert's
Lisa Jones faces 10 months in jail for perjury by failing to
tell prosecutors about stock parking by her boss.</p>
<p>The danger of enticing perjury in exchange for a reduced
sentence is greatest in white-collar crime and other areas
where the law is often vague or depends entirely on
intentions. A legitimate trade can easily be described as
manipulation or insider trading. A straightforward legal bill
can become a misleading bill for lobbying. Who will know?
Indeed, the temptation to lie to prosecutors may be
irresistible for crooks who are already con men.</p>
<p>Federal prosecutors now seem set on making
savings-and-loan executives the next big targets. In this
hothouse atmosphere, it will be child's play for real crooks
to cut their sentences by helping to criminalize what may be
perfectly legal loans. Potential plea bargainers need to hear
that federal prosecutors won't offer high rewards for
low-value information.</p>
