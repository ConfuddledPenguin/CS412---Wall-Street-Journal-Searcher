	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- U.S. manufacturers of flat-panel electronic
display screens, in what they described as a last-gasp bid
for the U.S. industry's survival, filed an anti-dumping
complaint against a number of Japanese competitors.
   The petition charges that Toshiba Corp., Hitachi Ltd.,
Matsushita Electric Industrial Co., Seiko Epson Corp., Sharp
Corp. and other Japanese companies are selling the advanced,
electronic display screens in the U.S. at far less than their
production costs or home-market prices in violation of the
U.S. anti-dumping trade law. If the complaint is upheld, the
Japanese products could be subject to penalty duties ranging
from 71% to 318% of their current U.S. prices.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"The industry is at a critical juncture," said James Hurd,
president of Planar Systems Inc., a Beaverton, Ore.,
manufacturer. "Unless the dumping issue is addressed now, its
future will be threatened." Mr. Hurd is one of the organizers
of the Advanced Display Manufacturers of America, a trade
group that filed the petition with the Commerce Department
and the International Trade Commission.</p>
<p>Flat-panel displays gradually are replacing the bulkier
cathode ray tubes, or CRTs, in televisions, laptop computers
and other devices. The technology involved also is basic to
establishing a high-definition television industry. The U.S.
demand for non-CRT displays is estimated to be close to $700
million a year and growing rapidly.</p>
<p>The technology, which has been commercially available for
about a decade, is of U.S. origin. However, Japanese
producers have captured 90% of the U.S. commercial flat-panel
market and are challenging U.S. producers for defense
industry sales, the complaint states.</p>
<p>"The Japanese are investing hundreds of millions of
dollars a year in order to create market dominance," Mr. Hurd
claims. "They've publicly acknowledged that they are prepared
to lose money for five to six years to get there."</p>
<p>The petition identifies the other respondents as Fujitsu
Ltd., Hosiden Electronics Co., Kyocera Corp., NEC Corp.,
Optrex Corp., Seiko Instruments & Electronics Ltd. and
Matsushita Electronics Corp., a unit of Matsushita Electric
Industrial. Both Seiko Epson and Seiko Instruments &
Electronics are units of Hattori Seiko Co. The petition
claims that Sharp, Matsushita Electric Industrial and Hitachi
are the dominant suppliers, with market shares in recent
years of 13.5%, 13% and 12%, respectively.</p>
<p>The Japanese respondents are likely to base their defense
on the principle of forward-pricing, which justifies some
initial below-cost sales if producers intend to recover all
their costs over the product's life. The Commerce Department
insists that producers recover all their costs within a year.</p>
<p>It's unlikely that the claim will garner wide support from
U.S. buyers of flat panels. Computer makers have been relying
for years on Japanese suppliers. Some major computer makers
such as Apple Computer Inc. and Tandy Corp. are even
encouraging the Japanese to invest heavily in a new
generation of color displays.</p>
