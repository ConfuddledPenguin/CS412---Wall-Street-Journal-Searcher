	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- The Justice Department said it will
challenge as a violation of federal antitrust law the
proposed sale by Twentieth Century Fox Film Corp. of a
Hollywood film laboratory to the British leisure and
entertainment firm Rank Organisation PLC.
   Twentieth Century is a unit of Fox Inc., which is owned by
Rupert Murdoch's News Corp. of Sydney, Australia.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Rank's acquisition of Deluxe Laboratories "would tend
substantially to lessen competition" among specialized film
labs that serve the Hollywood movie studios, the department
said in a statement. The statement didn't say when or where
the department intended to file a lawsuit to try to block the
transaction, and officials weren't available to comment
further.</p>
<p>Rank owns Film House Group Inc., a major Canadian film
lab. By acquiring Deluxe, Rank would control roughly half of
the $140 million U.S. market for producing prints of major
feature films, the Justice Department said.</p>
<p>Fox Inc. issued a statement saying, "We intend to
vigorously resist the Justice Department challenge." Rank
agreed to acquire Deluxe in March for about $150 million in
cash.</p>
<p>Rank, the largest processor of film in Europe, completed
its acquisition of Film House last April from Cineplex Odeon
Corp., which is 49%-owned by MCA Inc., paying about $113
million in a two-step transaction over two years. In 1988,
Rank paid about $120 million for a video-duplicating venture
from Bell & Howell Co., Columbia Pictures Entertainment Co.
and Paramount Pictures Corp.</p>
<p>Rank also owns a 50% stake of MCA Inc.'s new theme park,
Universal Studios Florida, which it also bought from Cineplex
Odeon, for $150 million.</p>
<p>Rank's interests include Pinewood Studios in England,
movie production, distribution and exhibition, a giant film
library, hotels, restaurants and recreation facilities. Its
film and television businesses reported income of $61.8
million last year, about one-fourth of the companywide total,
on sales of $350.7 million.</p>
