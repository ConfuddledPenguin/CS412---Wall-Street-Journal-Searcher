	<p class="article-leader">CADILLAC, Mich. -- CMS Energy Corp. and Cogeneration
Michigan Associates said they have formed a partnership to
build and operate a 34-megawatt wood-fired independent power
project in Cadillac. Each company will hold a 50% equity
ownership interest in the project.
   The plant's electric output will be sold to Consumers
Power Co. under a previously negotiated long-term contract.
Construction of the $66 million project is scheduled to begin
in spring 1991, with operation expected by January 1993.</p>
