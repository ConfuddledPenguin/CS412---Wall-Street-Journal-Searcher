	<p class="article-leader">In another indication of the hard times in the U.S.
government bond market, Midland Bank PLC said it was exiting
the elite group of bond firms in the U.S. that do business
directly with the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.
   The cutbacks are part of a general retrenchment that could
include layoffs of as many as 4,000 people in London over the
next few weeks, according to current and former Midland
employees. "It isn't our policy to comment on rumors or
speculation," said a bank spokesman in London.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Only a few years ago, many foreign banks and securities
firms were eager to become U.S. primary dealers, either by
building operations from scratch or paying top dollar for
existing ones. The logic behind these decisions was that to
be considered a major player in global finance, you had to be
big in the U.S. Treasury market, the world's biggest
securities market. But lately, the business has been a
disaster, suffering from overcapacity, low customer volume,
low volatility and razor-thin spreads between buy and sell
quotes.</p>
<p>Allan Rosenberg, president of Midland Montagu Securities
Inc., Midland's primary dealer and also the entity that
houses most of Midland's U.S. banking operations, said about
140 people would be laid off in New York. That would shrink
the British bank's U.S. presence to about 190 employees.</p>
<p>Besides the dealership, Midland is also closing its U.S.
private banking unit and letting go operations and support
staff. Midland inherited the dealership when it bought
Crocker National Bank in 1980.</p>
<p>Concerning the dealership, Mr. Rosenberg said: "The
biggest problem is that {the market} is oversaturated. There
are too many dealers chasing too little business." He added,
"Profit margins with institutional customer business are at a
bare minimum, and risk appetites are certainly in general
less today than they have been over the last 10 to 15 years."</p>
<p>Mr. Rosenberg said Midland's dealership was making money,
about $1 million to $2 million for the first six months of
1990 on a market share of 1.5% to 2%. The bank's problem was
insufficient return on capital: Maintaining the dealership
with such low profits didn't justify devoting $100 million of
capital to the business.</p>
<p>Midland officials said that instead, the bank had chosen
to concentrate on its strength in Britain and continental
Europe. Through subsidiaries and affiliates, the bank is a
major player in the British and German government bond
markets.</p>
<p>Midland's retreat reduces the number of primary dealers to
42 from a peak of 46 at the end of 1988. Fifteen of the firms
are controlled by foreign institutions.</p>
