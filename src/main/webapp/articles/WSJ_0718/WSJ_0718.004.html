	<p class="article-leader">DETROIT -- The United Auto Workers union and the Big Three
U.S. auto makers begin negotiations today that pit union
demands for total job security against the companies' need to
cut labor costs to compete with Japanese rivals.
   UAW leaders and negotiators for General Motors Corp. will
kick off their talks with the traditional handshake across
the bargaining table this morning. The current contract for
some 450,000 auto workers expires Sept. 14. In the coming
weeks the union will pick one of the Big Three as the target,
and negotiate a pact to serve as the pattern for the other
two companies. Most union and company officials expect GM
will be the UAW's target, in large part because of the clout
wielded by the head of the union's GM negotiating team, vice
president Stephen P. Yokich.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>But all these familiar rituals are being overshadowed by
the struggle the UAW and the Big Three face to stop the
erosion of their influence in the auto industry and the
overall U.S. economy.</p>
<p>That loss of power is directly related to the seven major
Japanese auto makers who have set up so-called transplant
factories in the U.S. since 1982. Japanese auto makers now
control a record 28% of the U.S. car market, up from 24% a
year ago. For the first half, the Big Three controlled 65% of
U.S. car sales, down from 69% a year ago. This shift has led
GM and Chrysler Corp. to order shutdowns of five U.S. plants
in the three years since the last UAW-GM contract was signed.</p>
<p>The stiffening Japanese competition is also a big factor
in the sales and profit crunch that has hit the Big Three.
Through the first half of the year, industrywide auto sales
were down 3.4%, but the Big Three sold 6.5% fewer U.S. built
vehicles than they did a year ago. Detroit's second-quarter
profits are likely to be the lowest since the recession years
of the early 1980s.</p>
<p>"The transplants will be a hidden presence at the
bargaining talks," says Harley Shaiken, a labor professor at
the University of California in San Diego.</p>
<p>Almost all of the major issues in the auto negotiations
are being defined by the Japanese. The UAW wants
Japanese-style no-layoff assurances. The companies, in turn,
want concessions that will make their hourly labor and
health-care costs as low as those of the Japanese.</p>
<p>The Japanese may even factor into the UAW's calculations
should the Sept. 14 deadline pass without an agreement.
Industry experts say that if the UAW calls a strike, it risks
giving the Japanese an opportunity to grab more market share
and undermine union jobs.</p>
<p>Halting the loss of jobs is the union's No. 1 issue.</p>
<p>"There's going to be a tremendous push in job security,"
says Stan Marshall, the UAW vice president in charge of the
Chrysler bargaining team. That means renewed efforts to stop
the auto makers from sending jobs to lower cost nonunion and
overseas shops, and tightening restrictions on plant
shutdowns.</p>
<p>Three years ago UAW leaders thought they had stopped plant
closings when the Big Three promised to lay off workers only
when demand slackened sharply. But GM and Chrysler found a
loophole that allowed them to "indefinitely idle" some plants
-- ceasing production, laying off thousands of workers and
keeping only a skeleton crew for maintenance.</p>
<p>Those actions helped the two companies stanch the flow of
money from unproductive operations, but they soured relations
with the union.</p>
<p>GM "lost the trust of the union, and they have to win that
trust back," says the UAW's Mr. Yokich. "I want an agreement
where they don't close plants, period," he says.</p>
<p>The job security issue is all the more complicated because
at least one of the Big Three could conceivably meet the
union's terms. Ford Motor Co., which shut down nearly all of
its excess plant capacity in the early 1980s, is now capable
of running its factories at close to 100% even during times
of weak demand. But most analysts say GM and Chrysler will
have to close more plants to match Ford's efficiency.</p>
<p>Ford officials have sent unusually strong signals that
they would be happy to be the target, and set the contract
pattern for the domestic industry.</p>
<p>On the company side, the issues boil down to the question
of cost. Ford estimates its labor costs are $8 an hour higher
than the best Japanese operations in the U.S. Of that amount,
about $5.50 an hour is attributable to higher pension and
health care costs for a work force whose average age is 45 --
a decade or more older than the average worker at a Japanese
plant. Similar patterns hold at GM and Chrysler.</p>
<p>Health-care costs are "a mega issue" for the companies,
one high level Ford labor executive says. But he adds that he
sees little hope for substantial reduction of the cost gap
with the Japanese plants. UAW leaders have vowed not to
accept any health-care cuts, and recently sanctioned a
seven-week strike at one auto supplier company in a
successful effort to avoid health-care cutbacks.</p>
<p>Union leaders also vow to push for increased pensions. Any
hope that the companies could avoid spending more on
retirement probably died after GM nearly doubled pensions for
outgoing chairman Roger B. Smith and other top executives in
May, company officials concede.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Chrysler has declared that its precipitously
falling profits and market share could make it impossible to
match a deal struck at GM or Ford. Anthony P. St. John,
Chrysler's top labor executive, has said the UAW's tradition
of "pattern bargaining," in which the union uses the first
contract negotiated as the model for the other two, is no
longer appropriate for an industry in which there are now 10
major manufacturers operating with widely divergent cost
structures.</p>
<p>It's unlikely, however, that Chrysler will get enough
support from its larger rivals to defeat the pattern system.
At Ford, negotiators say they don't want a rival to get a
break that effectively punishes Ford for running its
operations more successfully.</p>
