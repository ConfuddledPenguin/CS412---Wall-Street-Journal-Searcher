	<p class="article-leader">Wells Fargo & Co. agreed to acquire the California
branches of Great American Bank for $492 million in a move
that analysts said was a strategic coup for Wells.
   The transaction will also infuse desperately needed
capital into Great American. The thrift said yesterday its
remaining tangible capital will be nearly wiped out by a
large second-quarter loss that it attributed to new
regulatory standards for reserves, and Great American could
still collapse. Under terms of the transaction, it will still
be left with a huge amount of nonperforming loans that could
eat up the money provided by Wells.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The sale, which is to occur in two stages and may not be
complete until the middle of next year, covers as many as 130
branches -- considered the crown jewels of Great American's
operations -- plus $6.4 billion in deposits and $5.9 billion
in assets. The price amounts to a premium on deposits of
about 6%, which is at the high end of what banks have been
paying for deposits of troubled thrifts lately.</p>
<p>But the acquisition would give San Francisco-based Wells
the leading market share among banks and S&Ls in retail
deposits in the San Diego area, where Great American is
based, a position that Wells and other major California banks
have long coveted.</p>
<p>"It is a very opportunistic move," said Dick Fredericks,
bank analyst at Montgomery Securities. "They get an
attractive market share in an attractive market." Great
American said it received three bids for the franchise and
that Wells's was "clearly the best."</p>
<p>In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange
yesterday, Wells Fargo shares closed at $80.125, up $1.50.
Great American shares, meanwhile, closed at $2.125, down
$1.25.</p>
<p>For Great American, the sale of the California franchise
was a last resort in response to federal regulatory pressure
to raise capital. "We have shown there is capital-raising
ability in this institution, and very hopefully we will be
able to demonstrate that what is left is a viable
institution," said Robert Kemper, chairman and chief
executive officer of Great American.</p>
<p>But analysts consider the sale part of a process that will
eventually lead Great American into federal hands.</p>
<p>Wells is basically taking the best parts of Great American
and leaving its holders with about $2 billion in bad loans
and real estate that would equal roughly 20% of Great
American's total assets. The California sale to Wells, which
is still subject to regulatory approval, would leave Great
American with 81 retail offices in Arizona, Washington and
Colorado and mortgage-loan-origination offices in California.</p>
