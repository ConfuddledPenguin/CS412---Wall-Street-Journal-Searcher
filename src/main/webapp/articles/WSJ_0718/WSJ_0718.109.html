	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- A recession and higher interest rates could
push the costs of the savings-and-loan cleanup to $500
billion over 40 years, including interest, the General
Accounting Office said.
   The GAO, the investigative arm of Congress, previously
estimated that $325 billion would cover the costs of the
cleanup. But in a new report it referred to $325 billion as
the "least-cost estimate." The remarks came in its final
audit of the now-defunct Federal Savings and Loan Insurance
Corp., whose activities have been absorbed by the Resolution
Trust Corp.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The $325 billion estimate, the GAO said, is "based on the
Office of Management and Budget's optimistic interest-rate
assumptions." But the costs could approach $500 billion if
more than 560 thrifts fail and if the economy has a downturn.</p>
<p>The GAO said the cost of the FSLIC's transactions --
liabilities that were created before the thrift-cleanup law
was passed last year -- is expected to rise significantly
from the $38 billion originally estimated.</p>
