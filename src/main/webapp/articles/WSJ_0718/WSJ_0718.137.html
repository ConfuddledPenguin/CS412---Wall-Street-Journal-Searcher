	<p class="article-leader">PARIS -- The last major obstacle to German unification --
a dispute over the German-Polish border -- was removed,
virtually assuring that a single new German state will be
formed by year-end.
   The resolution of the Polish border issue came during a
seven-nation meeting just a day after the Soviet Union
withdrew its objections to a united Germany's membership in
the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. The Soviet shift came
as a surprise to both U.S. and West German officials, who
said they hadn't expected Soviet acquiescence until
September.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"There is no obstacle for a united Germany to be
re-established, with its sovereignty, by the end of the
year," said French Foreign Minister Roland Dumas. U.S.
Secretary of State James Baker said "the advent of a united,
democratic and sovereign Germany" would occur by the first
anniversary of last February's agreement to launch the
so-called two-plus-four unification talks.</p>
<p>The border deadlock was broken when the two German states
pledged to sign a treaty recognizing the current Polish
border very quickly after unification is achieved. In
addition, they promised to conclude later a second treaty
covering other aspects of relations with Poland, including
economic guarantees. Poland's foreign minister, Krysztof
Skubiszewski, said the treaty pledge, and related promises,
were "entirely satisfactory."</p>
<p>This week's events have eliminated the need for further
high-level bargaining on German unification. All that remains
for the creation of a "final settlement" on Germany -- in
effect, a treaty ending World War II -- is for second-level
officials to draft the document for review by the foreign
ministers in Moscow in September and its adoption at a
35-nation summit set to be held here on Nov. 19.</p>
<p>Approval of the treaty, coupled with an internal German
agreement to merge, would set the stage for all-German
elections Dec. 2, which would give birth to the new nation.</p>
<p>The Polish border agreement was overshadowed at
yesterday's talks by Western pleasure -- and wonder -- at the
suddenness of the decision Monday by Soviet President Mikhail
Gorbachev to clear the way for the West to claim all of
Germany in its military alliance. His move culminated a
nine-month series of Soviet retreats in central and eastern
Europe that largely have undone the territorial and political
moves of Soviet dictator Joseph Stalin in the years after
World War II.</p>
<p>Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze explained that
changes in the nature of NATO had allowed the Soviets to
"take a new look" at German membership in the alliance. He
and West German Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher both
heatedly denied that Bonn had purchased Soviet approval with
promises of large amounts of economic aid.</p>
<p>"One cannot buy approval," Mr. Genscher asserted. Said Mr.
Shevardnadze, "There is no trade." German officials told
reporters that no specific new aid totals were pledged in the
German-Soviet talks, but would be laid out later in two
treaties.</p>
<p>Both U.S. and German officials scrambled to counter the
impression that the historic events of the past few days took
place largely without the involvement of Washington.
Officials of both nations stressed repeatedly that all the
German positions were discussed in advance with the Bush
administration, though they hadn't expected them to be
accepted for months.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, in contrast to previous "two-plus-four"
meetings, Mr. Baker was a lonely figure at the crowded final
press conference. He was asked no questions until late in the
session, when an American reporter asked him whether the U.S.
was losing its clout. He stressed that the U.S. had long
supported the terms of the agreement now emerging.</p>
<p>As a result of the German promise to honor Poland's
borders and the Polish government's reaction, a State
Department official said, Mr. Baker felt it unnecessary to
carry out a threat he made Monday to propose that the four
victorious World War II powers -- the U.S., Britain, France
and the Soviet Union -- retain some rights over German
borders until a treaty is signed.</p>
<p>That means that all of the World War II victors now have
agreed to relinquish their powers and rights in Germany at
the time of unification. U.S. officials said a treaty on the
Polish border could be signed within days of unification and
ratified immediately after the new German parliament is
organized following the Dec. 2 vote.</p>
<p>The State Department official told reporters that Mr.
Baker, after conferring with Messrs. Genscher and
Shevardnadze, is satisfied with the German-Soviet agreement
that led to Mr. Gorbachev's acceptance of German membership
in NATO.</p>
<p>Under the pact, according to German, Soviet and U.S.
officials, NATO's mutual security umbrella would be extended
to protect East German territory even during the three to
four years that it will take for Soviet troops to withdraw.
After they leave, NATO would be barred from stationing
non-German units there, though it could post German army
units that are integrated into NATO's war plans.</p>
<p>Nuclear weapons would be barred on former East German
territory, though the question of nuclear weapons in former
West Germany territory would be settled at previously
announced talks due to start this fall.</p>
<p>Despite fear in Europe of a powerful German state, the
underlying theme of yesterday's meeting was that the new
Germany will live in peace with its neighbors. "We can trust
the German people," Mr. Shevardnadze said. Mr. Genscher cited
the Soviet foreign minister's praise and said, "This is a
trust which is shared by all."</p>
