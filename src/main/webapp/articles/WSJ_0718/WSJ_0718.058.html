	<p class="article-leader">The Dow Jones Industrial Average flirted with 3,000 the
past two days, despite predictions of burgeoning deficits and
unspeakable mayhem from White House Budget Director Richard
Darman. Could the markets be ignoring the White House, and
even Mr. Darman?
   The budget director's midyear review had the tone and feel
of a summer revival meeting, preaching hellfire and damnation
if Gramm-Rudman's automatic spending cuts have to kick in
this October. Americans are sinners, Lord, so our children
will go unvaccinated, the common defense will collapse, air
traffic will go uncontrolled, college tuition will go unpaid,
locusts will blot out the sun. . . .</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>We were just about to cry, "Amen," and send a check to
Uncle Sam, until we remembered that this all sounded
familiar. It sounded like the looming "catastrophe" and
"deficits as far as the eye can see" that helped give us the
infamous TEFRA tax increase in 1982, with its bogus promise
of $3 in spending cuts for every $1 in tax increases. "The
pressure is put on. It is inescapable," Mr. Darman declared
to a question about "the crisis." House Budget Chairman Leon
Panetta was less restrained: "The crisis, in short, is real.
These numbers should hit the White House, the Congress, and
the summit like a fire alarm in the middle of the night."</p>
<p>Once they're awake, though, voters may ask where the fire
is. On Monday, even as Mr. Darman was listing his budget
martyrs, the stock market was hitting a record. The economy
is sluggish to be sure, but unemployment remains near its
15-year low. Industrial production climbed four-tenths of a
percent last month. If there's a crisis now, why wasn't there
one four or six months ago when economic growth was even more
uncertain?</p>
<p>The obvious answer is that this is really a Washington
crisis. Above all else on earth, Mr. Darman wants a budget
agreement with Democrats, so we have to have a crisis. Mr.
Darman isn't telling fibs, but, well, let's just say he's
using the discretion every budget director has with the
numbers.</p>
<p>In January, Mr. Darman predicted a fiscal 1991 budget
deficit of $100 billion; only six months later, it's $169
billion -- without including the savings-and-loan bailout.
Sure, the economy's grown more slowly than expected, but tax
receipts have fallen by about only $29 billion. Where could
the rest of the deficit have been hiding? One hint: OMB's
deficit estimates are usually $20 billion or so under those
of the Congressional Budget Office. This time CBO and OMB are
about the same. If the budget revisions had somehow made the
deficit look better, everyone would now be screaming about
"blue smoke and mirrors."</p>
<p>Our habit, and we presume the market's habit, is not to
look at "the deficit" but at the underlying trends in
receipts and expenditures. As the accompanying chart shows,
the new dire predictions are nothing dramatic. (See
accompanying illustration -- WSJ July 18, 1990) As a percent
of GNP, estimated receipts and expenditures for 1990 and
1991, including the cost of the S&L bailout, stay about where
they were in 1989. More broadly, the Reagan tax cuts simply
capped taxes at a normal level, ironing out the 1981-1982
bulge. Spending has fallen from its mid-1980s peak, but not
enough to balance the budget. And what really counts, in
terms of the government's demand on real resources, is
measured not by the deficit but by outlays.</p>
<p>In the current budget negotiations, though, Democrats want
to raise taxes so they can turn on the spending spigot again.
Mr. Darman knows this, but his crisis-mongering suggests he's
caught up in the excitement of the chase for a deal, whether
or not the quarry is worth it. He knows the political
obstacles are great, so he's creating the circumstances that
leave no room for disagreement by the politicians, starting
with his boss George Bush. But just what is it he now hopes
to get in return for killing Mr. Bush's no-new-tax pledge?</p>
<p>The question is especially apt since the summiteers are
blinking on serious reform of the budget process. Treasury
Secretary Nicholas Brady keeps saying any budget deal must be
"enforceable," but how? The White House has abandoned the
line-item veto, as well as its poor cousin, enhanced
rescission. Democrats want no process reforms, while
Republicans are making pre-emptive concessions among
themselves. We hear the private debate is now over "points of
order" in the Senate or a "joint budget resolution" that the
President could veto, among other largely cosmetic changes.</p>
<p>No wonder many House Republicans want to send the White
House a message. Texas Rep. Dick Armey plans to introduce a
resolution at today's GOP House Conference opposing "all tax
rate increases." It defines tax rate increases as "all rates
on all existing taxes under federal jurisdiction." The
resolution could pass.</p>
<p>We keep reading that Mr. Darman is the smartest man in
Washington, so no doubt he has some proposal to save us all
from perdition. We'll applaud him if he does. But if his
budget deal ends up as TEFRA in a new suit, someone should be
taken to the woodshed.</p>
