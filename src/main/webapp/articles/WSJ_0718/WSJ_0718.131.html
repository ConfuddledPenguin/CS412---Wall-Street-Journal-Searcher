	<p class="article-leader">French state-owned steel group Usinor Sacilor S.A. said it
provisionally agreed to buy one of the largest U.S.
steel-trading companies, extending its recent aggressive U.S.
acquisition drive.
   A Usinor-Sacilor offical said the Paris-based company had
signed an agreement with U.S. investment group Blackstone
Group to buy Edgcomb Corp., provided Edgcomb cleaned up its
balance sheet by buying back about $150 million in debt
outstanding before Aug. 10. The purchase price wasn't
disclosed.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>If the sale goes ahead, it will be the French group's
fourth move in the U.S. this year and follows a wave of
takeovers by Usinor-Sacilor in Europe and the U.S. last year.</p>
<p>The official said that Usinor-Sacilor has now developed a
strong position in the U.S. stainless steel market and that
Edgcomb, which as a trading house has strong links with major
U.S. steel clients, would give the French group a vantage
point from which to study the flat steel market.</p>
<p>Edgcomb had 1989 sales of about $600 million and and a
work force of about 1,600, he added. Blackstone acquired
Edgcomb last year in a leveraged buy-out.</p>
