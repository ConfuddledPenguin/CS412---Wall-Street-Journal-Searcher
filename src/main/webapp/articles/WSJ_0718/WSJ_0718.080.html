	<p class="article-leader">NEW SOVIET TAXES on business offer enticements to Western
enterprises.
   The withholding tax on joint ventures' payouts to foreign
owners falls to 15% from 20% and may be cut further by
treaty, the Washington law firm Cole Corette & Abrutyn says.
A profits tax of 30% applies to foreign-owned operations and
to joint ventures owned more than 30% by foreigners; the rate
for Soviet concerns is 45%. Expanded expense deductions and
provisions for a five-year loss carryforward greatly improve
chances that the U.S. will grant credits for the tax against
U.S. income taxes, the firm's Edward Lieberman adds.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>But details of several taxes adopted by the Supreme Soviet
last month haven't been announced. A tax of up to 90% on
"excess profits," which the Council of Ministers is to define
by Aug. 1, may deter investments in some industries. The
Council is to design an export-import tax on middlemen and to
set rates for a value-added tax. A two-year tax exemption for
joint ventures registered after 1990 is restricted to certain
industries.</p>
<p>In September, the U.S. and the Soviet Union are to resume
negotiations to revise their 1973 tax treaty.</p>
<p>I KNOW I WAS MARRIED, judge, he said. It's the divorce I
can't pin down.</p>
<p>Larry and Ann married in 1964, but had "marital problems"
after he fathered a son by another woman in 1982, he told Tax
Court Special Judge Goldberg. Still, Ann stayed with him in
St. Louis into 1987; they filed joint returns for 1985 and
1986. Ann must have got a divorce later, for she remarried,
Larry said. But the IRS questioned whether Ann existed; she
listed no Social Security number. The IRS sought to tax Larry
as a single man, so he appealed to the court.</p>
<p>The judge found Larry's testimony to be "honest and
credible, albeit fascinating." The judge said Larry, who
worked for the Army Engineers on a dredge boat on the
Mississippi, may file jointly for 1985 and 1986. But the
judge added that Larry hadn't established the date of any
divorce; thus, he must file as a single taxpayer for 1987,
not as a head of household.</p>
<p>RULINGS ON EXEMPTIONS can be made more efficiently, the
GAO says.</p>
<p>The IRS gets over 50,000 requests a year for the
exemptions available to 25 types of charitable, educational,
religious, and other groups; it has approved over 1.2 million
of them. Congress's General Accounting Office now says IRS
reviewers make too little use of their discretion to expedite
exemptions and thus free agents to do more compliance audits.
Some 60% of the groups have too little income to have to file
annual reports; the IRS audits only 1.4% of the Form 990s.</p>
<p>Lacking clear guidance, the seven IRS offices involved use
the expedited process for only 2% to 17% of the requests they
handle, the GAO found; it advises the IRS to re-evaluate the
process and rewrite its guidelines. The IRS also should
broaden the review it makes of any group, big or small, five
years after exemption is recognized. It now checks only
sources of income.</p>
<p>Spending data would show whether a charity is fulfilling
its professed exempt purposes, the GAO says.</p>
<p>TOTTING UP THE TAKE: Up to now, businesses have had to
report to the IRS a receipt of cash exceeding $10,000 in one
payment or two related ones. New IRS rules require businesses
to add related amounts received over one year and report each
time the aggregated receipts exceed $10,000.</p>
<p>NEW YORK'S REVISION of tax rules for S corporations, which
are taxed much like partnerships at the federal level, now
requires reconsideration of S elections made at the state
level, says law firm Roberts & Holland, New York City. Owners
have until Aug. 8 to revoke New York elections.</p>
<p>TOO OLD TO PROTECT, the Tax Court says, are confidential
data for 1979-82 about Evening Telegram Co., a family-owned,
Superior, Wis.-based newspaper and broadcasting concern. The
court declined to seal detailed financial documents put into
evidence in the trial of an estate-tax case.</p>
<p>THE IRS APPLIES BRAKES to accelerated deductions of
accrued property taxes.</p>
<p>Businesses using accrual accounting deduct expenses as
incurred, not as paid, and may benefit nicely. Take state and
local property taxes: Deduction timing varies, depending on a
state's legal-liability and payment-due dates and on state
and business fiscal years. But in Alabama, Arkansas,
Colorado, Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Oklahoma and South
Carolina, calendar-year concerns have been able to deduct the
taxes on federal returns a year before making payments. In
many other states, deductions have been advanced by half a
year.</p>
<p>Now proposed IRS rules would require accrual-method
concerns to delay deductions until "economic performance" --
payment -- occurs. This could mean a big jump in federal
income tax for the year of the timing change. Businesses may
be able to ease the blow in some states by making certain
elections, says Michael J. Novogradac, a San Francisco CPA,
but it isn't clear just how the elections apply to property
taxes.</p>
<p>The rules also could delay deductions of liabilities for
insurance premiums, warranty and service contracts, and other
expenses, says James Connor of Coopers & Lybrand, CPAs.</p>
<p>BRIEFS: Now let's check those digits: On Budget Director
Darman's official statement raising the deficit estimate, his
name appeared as "Daramn." . . . Colorado and Maryland bring
to 17 the number of states granting at least partial
sales-tax exemption to precious-metal bullion and coins.</p>
