	<p class="article-leader">Polaroid Corp., suffering from weak sales in the U.S.,
posted a 23% decline in net income on a 2.3% drop in sales in
the second quarter.
   The Cambridge, Mass.-based photography company, whose
sales have been sluggish recently, said domestic sales
declined 10% in the quarter from the year-ago period, while
international sales rose 8%.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Polaroid's net income dropped to $32.9 million, or 45
cents a share, from $42.7 million, or 62 cents a share, in
the year-ago period, as sales declined to $475.6 million,
from $486.6 million. Earnings dropped even though the
company's effective tax rate dclined to 31%, from 41% in the
1989 second quarter.</p>
<p>Shipments of instant film dropped, as retailers lowered
inventory, the company said. Camera sales were flat. "Higher
levels of investment in marketing and in new product
development" also cut into profit, the company said.</p>
<p>For the first six months, Polaroid's net income fell 5.7%,
to $64.7 million, or 89 cents a share, from $68.6 million, or
87 cents a share, on a lower number of shares outstanding.
Sales dropped 1.8%, to $911.8 million, from $928.9 million.</p>
