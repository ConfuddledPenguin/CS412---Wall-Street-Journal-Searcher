	<p class="article-leader">OSAKA, Japan -- A top Kubota Corp. executive, responding
to allegations that the Japanese company fraudulently
obtained U.S. computer technology, said two Silicon Valley
entrepreneurs brought the charges only after their private
demand for a $7 million payment was refused.
   Last Thursday, the founders of a supercomputer graphics
company filed a lawsuit in Superior Court in Santa Clara,
Calif., alleging that Kubota forced the merger of their
company with another -- a combination that became Stardent
Computer Inc. They alleged that Kubota then began to transfer
the technology to one of its subsidiaries.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>But Masahiro Yoshida, a Kubota managing director, cast
events in a different light in an interview at the company's
headquarters here.</p>
<p>He characterized the allegations as "bold-faced lies" and
portrayed Kubota as the savior of a struggling U.S.
technology company that couldn't find U.S. capital. Kubota's
only mistake, Mr. Yoshida indicated, was perhaps naively
stepping into a high-technology market characterized by rapid
ups and downs and heated personality clashes -- much
different than the staid Japanese market.</p>
<p>Mr. Yoshida displayed a copy of a letter dated June 1,
1990, and signed by Joseph Alioto, attorney for Allen Michels
and Matthew Sanders, the co-chairmen of Stardent who filed
the suit. In the letter, various grievances the pair had
against Kubota were outlined, and a request was made for a
payment of $3.5 million apiece, to be paid in the form of a
five-year consulting fee. The letter indicated the two men
would quietly leave the company without bringing charges if
they received the money.</p>
<p>"If we had paid the money they had demanded at the
beginning, does that mean we can pay money to steal American
technology?" Mr. Yoshida asked.</p>
<p>Mr. Michels acknowledged that Mr. Alioto sent a letter to
Kubota proposing a $7 million settlement, which the two
considered "reasonable." But other evidence of Kubota's
alleged wrongdoing emerged after the letter was sent, he
said.</p>
<p>As to accusations that the pair is presenting "bold-faced
lies," Mr. Michels said, "That's why we have courts. We have
a significant amount of evidence that we feel will back up
our complaints."</p>
<p>Mr. Alioto said the pre-suit request for a settlement that
Mr. Yoshida referred to was disclosed in the suit and didn't
constitute a big disclosure.</p>
<p>Mr. Yoshida's remarks were the company's first detailed
response to the allegations, although Kubota apparently plans
a strong counteroffensive. The company has scheduled a news
conference in Tokyo Friday to discuss the matter. Mr. Yoshida
said Kubota hadn't yet formulated a legal strategy because
the company hasn't yet seen the lawsuit.</p>
