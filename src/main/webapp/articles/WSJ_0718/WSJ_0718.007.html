	<p class="article-leader">Three strikes, and NASA should be out:
   -- The space shuttle fleet is grounded again, this time
for unexplained fuel leaks.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>-- The $2.8 billion Hubble Space Telescope is half blind
until corrective lenses are delivered in 1993.</p>
<p>-- All funding for the Moon/Mars initiative has been cut
by Congress.</p>
<p>Vice President Dan Quayle's office this week announced an
outside review of the space agency's tasks. But the
confluence of disasters makes a wider truth clear: Government
agencies are unsuited for exploring outer space. The U.S.
should cast off NASA's centrally planned aerospace welfare
state and create something effective: a capitalist space
program. The key is to fire the bureaucrats working on the
moon, Mars and space station plans, and put the savings into
cash incentives for space exploration.</p>
<p>To start, offer $40 million to any American who spends a
year in orbit on U.S.built facilities. This "Space
Homesteading Incentive" will make reaching the orbital
frontier roughly a break-even proposition, as virtually all
of the $40 million will be needed to pay expenses. Expensive?
Just put a cap on the number of people -- say, 100 a year.
For only $4 billion annually, the orbital frontier would be
swarming with Americans. Diverting $4 billion from NASA's
annual budget will leave the agency with $10 billion for
science projects and the expensive space shuttle.</p>
<p>Many more than 100 people would seek a Space Homesteading
Incentive, so a kind of reverse auction would determine who
received the payments. That is, the lowest bidders will win
funding. As homesteaders find profitable occupations they
will bid down the individual payments even lower. Eventually
the amount they receive will drop to zero. This in turn will
spawn a private space habitat industry and invigorate the
launcher industry.</p>
<p>NASA, by sorry contrast, has squandered $4 billion
planning for its gold-plated space station. Total crew size:
eight.</p>
<p>The tiny crew of the NASA space station exposes the
central flaw of government space programs. They're so
expensive that only a handful of elite pilots and scientists
can ever hope to experience space directly. No wonder public
support for space has waned -- voters realize they aren't
invited to the final frontier.</p>
<p>Orbital incentives open that frontier to the rest of us.
Launch firms will compete to offer space settlers the best
balance of safety and price. In orbit, space habitats will
compete for business by specializing in various markets. Some
will cater to business researchers, who need absolute
stillness and privacy for their zero-gravity experiments.
Others will become orbital fuel depots and transportation
nodes, with a constant bustle and vibration that would poison
zero-gravity research. Still others will innovate with the
most spartan of living quarters, for those homesteaders
shopping for the lowest rents in space.</p>
<p>After a decade, the orbital economy likely will become
self-sustaining. Congress then can shift the incentives to a
new target, the moon. The vibrant orbital economy will
provide tools for creating moon settlements at modest cost.
Then by 2010, Congress could offer Mars homestead incentives.
By contrast, NASA's plans for 2020 foresee three astronauts
making a brief visit to Mars, with a dozen others in orbit or
on the moon. It is not inspiring.</p>
<p>NASA succeeded with the Apollo Program because it had a
political goal: Walk on the moon before the Soviets. Now we
have economic goals, which are nearly impossible for
bureaucrats to achieve.</p>
<p>For example, NASA created the space shuttle for the
central purpose of slashing the cost of putting people and
cargo into orbit. A recent Rand study found, though, the
space shuttle quadrupled per-pound launch costs. Then NASA
conceived the space station. Projected costs have soared
beyond $37 billion by NASA's reckoning; outside experts
expect it to cost far more. No activity in space can make
economic sense at those prices.</p>
<p>Orbital incentive plans require no bureaucrats, no
multi-volume books of contract specifications and no audit
teams. Space homesteaders will simply get their passports
date-stamped when they leave Earth, and date-stamped when
they return. For every fraction of a year spent in orbit,
they collect their slice of $40 million.</p>
<p>Free enterprise will do the rest.</p>
