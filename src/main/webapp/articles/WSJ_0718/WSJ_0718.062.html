	<p class="article-leader">TOKYO -- Japan's major life insurance companies, the
biggest investors in the nation's stock market, are growing
angry about the tight-fisted dividend policies of big
Japanese companies.
   These once stolid and silent investors are calling for
Japanese companies to pay out more of their profits to
shareholders.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Last week, the head of Dai-Ichi Mutual Life Insurance Co.,
Japan's second-largest life insurer and one of the Tokyo
stock market's biggest investors, served notice that the
concern plans to sell long-held stocks of companies offering
dividends that Dai-Ichi Mutual regards as too low.</p>
<p>"There's been no change in our basic position as stable
investors, but we're going to be more selective about our
longterm stocks," Takahide Sakurai, Dai-Ichi Mutual's
president, said at a news conference in Nagoya. "We're not
going to smile upon every industry. From now on, we'll have a
bumpy relationship" with companies, he said.</p>
<p>A spokesman for Nippon Life Insurance Co., the largest
insurer in Japan, said the company shares Dai-Ichi Mutual's
frustration and has already begun selling the stocks of
companies it believes are particularly stingy.</p>
<p>Japan's once-troubled shipbuilders, for example, have had
steady profits for the past five years, but
Ishikawajima-Harima Heavy Industries Co., one of the industry
leaders, offers investors a dividend yield of only 0.5%.
"What's wrong with that?" a spokesman says. "Other
manufacturers' dividends aren't much higher."</p>
<p>Industrial Bank of Japan, the world's sixth-largest bank
in terms of assets, pays its shareholders a yield of 0.2%. A
spokesman says the problem isn't that dividends are too low,
but that the market price of the company's stock has climbed
so high. "We can't make payouts on the basis of how the stock
is trading," he says.</p>
<p>The newfound assertiveness of insurers such as Nippon Life
and Dai-Ichi Mutual, who together own about six of every 100
stocks on the Tokyo market, may result in changes that would
make the Japanese exchange function somewhat more like Wall
Street, by encouraging other investors to pick Japanese
stocks more for the dividend income they produce than for the
promise of capital gains.</p>
<p>"Finally, we're beginning to see Japan's big shareholders
become a bit more Western in their investing habits," says
Stuart Matthews, an analyst at Barclays de Zoete Wedd
Securities Ltd., a British brokerage firm.</p>
<p>For Japan's big companies, though, insurers' demands could
mean higher capital costs. If companies have to pay out more
of their earnings to holders, they will end up with less
retained income to pay for new equipment and other
investments. This will force them to borrow more or invest
less. And that could reduce their international
competitiveness, particularly compared with U.S. companies
that already pay out more of their earnings.</p>
<p>Tokyo's 1,810 listed companies now return less than
one-third of their profits to investors, according to
statistics compiled by the Tokyo Stock Exchange. By contrast,
the average payout ratio for U.S. companies is about 45%,
according to Standard & Poor's Corp.</p>
<p>Even after the Tokyo stock market plunge earlier this
year, Japanese companies' stocks still sell at hefty
multiples of their earnings. The result: The Nikkei average
of 225 big Japanese stocks yields a skimpy 0.5% in dividends,
compared with a more generous 3.31% for the S&P 500 index of
U.S. stocks.</p>
<p>Tetsuya Horie, president of Long-Term Credit Bank of
Japan, concedes that in the Japanese market, investors are "a
bit neglected."</p>
<p>"The return to shareholders should be more seriously
considered," he says. "Japanese life insurance companies are
correct on this point." But Long-Term Credit Bank offers
investors a yield of 0.4% on its stock, even after adjustment
for a stock split expected next month, and Mr. Horie says he
hasn't any intention of recommending an increase.</p>
<p>Dissatisfaction with insurers may reflect a weakening of
Japan's renowned industrial group system. Historically, the
life companies have displayed a notorious lack of concern
about the profitability of their stock portfolios. Rather,
many tended to view stock ownership merely as a means of
increasing sales of insurance policies. They clung to stocks
of companies with which they shared close business ties,
mainly because they counted on selling insurance policies to
the employees of the companies in return.</p>
<p>But now the life companies seem willing to risk disrupting
these traditional arrangements, as they find themselves
suddenly strapped for revenue and under increasing
competition against banks for the nation's pool of consumer
savings.</p>
<p>Insurers are acutely aware of the need to store enough
money to afford paying claims to Japan's rapidly aging
population in the decades ahead. Japanese society is graying
at a rate faster than that of any other advanced industrial
nation, and by 2025, one in every four Japanese will be age
65 or older, according to projections by the Ministry of
Health and Welfare.</p>
<p>"Japan is in a period of high savings now, but that can't
last forever," Kermit L. Schoenholtz, senior economist at
Salomon Brothers Inc.'s Tokyo office, says. "The life
companies are all worried about getting maximum return on
their investments now, so they'll be able to pay out claims
later."</p>
<p>Adding to the life companies' dilemma is the poor
performance of single-premium endowment policies, a bold
investment product they aggressively marketed in the
mid-1980s.</p>
<p>The policies, which allowed consumers willing to pay their
premiums in advance the opportunity to earn compound gains of
as much as 60% at the end of five-year or 10-year terms, were
enormously popular with the Japanese when these were
introduced. But the appeal of single-premium policies plunged
in 1988, when the Ministry of Finance declared them subject
to the same tax laws as ordinary savings accounts. The first
wave of single-premium policies now is reaching maturity. As
a result, many investors are shifting funds out of insurance
companies and back into banks.</p>
<p>The life companies have a keen interest in higher
dividends, because Japanese insurance law bars them from
paying out capital gains to their policyholders. The law may
have cost Japanese policyholders a cumulative 45 trillion yen
($303.3 billion) in unrealized securities gains, according to
W.I. Carr (Overseas) Ltd.</p>
<p>The major life companies have grumbled publicly about
Japan's low dividends previously, and some observers remain
skeptical that the insurers intend to do anything other than
complain. "There's an element of shadow boxing to all this,"
Roger Gough, a senior analyst at Baring Securities (Japan)
Ltd., says. "In some ways, this is mostly an attempt at
intimidation."</p>
