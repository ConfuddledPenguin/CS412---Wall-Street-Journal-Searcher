	<p class="article-leader">CLEVELAND -- TRW Inc. reported a 10% decline in
second-quarter profit because of increased interest costs and
a higher tax rate.
   The automotive-parts, aerospace and electronic-services
concern said that operating profit rose 4%, and that its
major businesses "continue to perform well in a persistently
difficult environment."</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Net income dropped to $63 million, or $1.01 a share fully
diluted, from $70 million, or $1.12 a share, in the 1989
second quarter. The company traditionally reports share
earnings on a fully diluted basis.</p>
<p>Sales rose 14% to $2.1 billion from $1.84 billion.</p>
<p>Interest costs rose to $46 million from $38 million in the
year-earlier quarter, reflecting higher borrowings, mainly to
finance acquisitions.</p>
<p>Sales of auto and truck parts jumped 20% to $1.04 billion,
mainly because of higher sales of air bags and other
occupant-restraint systems. The group's operating profit rose
8% to $84 million. Higher engineering, product-development
and start-up expenses in the restraints business, weaker car
and truck sales in North America, and the unsettled Brazilian
economy limited the gain in operating profit, TRW said.</p>
<p>TRW's space and defense segment reported a 9% rise in
sales to $862 million, and a "slight" increase in operating
profit to $61 million. Reduced government funding on certain
programs and a stretchout of others contributed to the
group's lower profit margins, as did higher investment to
develop future business, the company said.</p>
<p>Sales of information systems and services rose 5% to $190
million, but operating profit declined about the same
percentage to $18 million. The company blamed a sales decline
at units performing maintenance service on electronic
equipment produced by other companies, and costs of
downsizing those businesses.</p>
<p>For the first half, TRW reported net of $120 million, or
$1.93 a share, down 14% from $139 million, or $2.24 a share,
a year earlier. Operating profit rose 5%, TRW said. Sales
rose 13% to $4.09 billion from $3.63 billion.</p>
<p>In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday,
TRW fell 25 cents to close at $46.875.</p>
