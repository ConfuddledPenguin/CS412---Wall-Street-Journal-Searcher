	<p class="article-leader">New York -- Reminders of the killing fields lurk in the
simplest social encounters. Sitting in a New York apartment,
half the world away from home, Proeung Chhieng, artistic
director of the Classical Dance Company of Cambodia, suddenly
noticed a small framed picture across the room: It was a
photo of his sister, a former dance star who was killed by
the Khmer Rouge. He hadn't seen her, or even her photograph,
in 15 years. Another time, watching my videotapes of
Cambodian refugee dancers, Mr. Chhieng saw a woman he hadn't
seen since Khmer Rouge times -- a woman who, before the war,
had been his fiancee.
   Mr. Chhieng, visiting from Phnom Penh, was here to make
arrangements for his troupe's appearance at the Los Angeles
Festival in September. That engagement will be followed by
several others, including performances at the Kennedy Center
in Washington, D.C., and the Brooklyn Academy of Music.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>No dance company from Cambodia has appeared in America
since 1971, when a troupe of 45 played at the Brooklyn
Academy. Mr. Chhieng, then 22 years old, was one of the young
stars. At the time, spectators watching dancers in sequined
velvet and brocade sarongs, curling and angling their bodies
in exquisite legato gestures, could little have imagined that
just a few years later most of those artists would be dead.
They, along with a million other Cambodians, were victims of
a mad cultural revolution by Khmer Rouge communist fanatics.
No one could have predicted that the dance form itself -- one
of the most beautiful in the world -- would be on the brink
of extinction.</p>
<p>Today, with the Khmer Rouge maneuvering to seize power
once again, Mr. Chhieng's quick, shy smile belies his fear
for his country. His obsession is to restore Cambodia's art
from the rubble the Khmer Rouge left. And in New York, as in
Phnom Penh (where we've worked together on oral histories of
Cambodian dance), Mr. Chhieng's modesty, and privacy,
camouflage a life and career placed treacherously near the
power brokers of Cambodia's tragic history.</p>
<p>The grand-nephew of one of Cambodia's renowned dance
masters, Mr. Chhieng was raised in the palace, which was the
home of the royal dance troupe. He recalls, as a toddler,
hearing the music for the monkey role, the only role in
Cambodian court dance played by boys. He'd race from his
living quarters to the ornate, saffron-roofed dance rehearsal
pavilion, arriving just in time to catch the last few
moments. He fell in love with what he saw.</p>
<p>Mr. Chhieng and one of his sisters became apprentices to
the Royal Ballet -- and eventually stars. His signature role
was the white monkey general Hanuman, one of the most popular
characters in the Reamker, the Cambodian version of the great
Hindu epic, the Ramayana.</p>
<p>After Prince Sihanouk was overthrown by a right-wing coup
in 1970, Mr. Chhieng accompanied the Queen Mother, the
leading patron of the dance, to her son's exile in China. But
he returned to Cambodia to continue dancing -- in time to be
caught in the Khmer Rouge nightmare.</p>
<p>Mr. Chhieng will not talk about his experiences from 1975
to 1979 under the Pol Pot regime. "Thinking about it creates
too much pain -- and too much anger. My way to deal with
Khmer Rouge is to fight them, by rebuilding the dance they
destroyed."</p>
<p>According to his resume, Mr. Chhieng, like virtually
everyone else, worked as a farmer in Pol Pot's
concentration-camp state. Both his parents, 12 of his 13
brothers and sisters, and most of his other relatives were
killed.</p>
<p>As soon as the Khmer Rouge were expelled in 1979, the
handful of surviving Cambodian artists began working together
to reassemble the shards of their culture. Within weeks, they
were able to mount a dance performance for the Cambodian New
Year. It was a makeshift affair, but it was a start. When a
friend urged Mr. Chhieng to flee with him to the Thai border,
where food and medicine were available and third-country
resettlement might be possible, he refused: "I said, `This is
where the best teachers are. It's here that the dance can be
restored.'"</p>
<p>It was. In 1981, Cambodia's great champion of the arts,
Chheng Phon, set up a new Fine Arts School in the wasteland
of Cambodia's once-elegant capital. With a whole generation
of dancers lost, the school had to start from scratch,
teaching young children. The staff worked against time,
hoping they could transmit the art to a new generation before
the few surviving masters, such as Chea Samy, passed away.
Now, the dancers they've been training for 10 years are
extraordinary. They form the core of the company scheduled to
come to America.</p>
<p>During his advance visit here, Mr. Chhieng was anxious to
catch up with the work of Cambodian dancers living abroad. He
tracked down phone numbers of artists in America, including
friends and colleagues he'd lost touch with because of the
continuing isolation of Cambodia by the world outside the
Soviet bloc. "Hello," he would begin, "this is Chhieng `sva
saw,'" Chhieng the white monkey.</p>
<p>When he met with fellow artists, politics and decades-long
separations didn't seem to matter. They began by pooling
information about the fate of former colleagues -- who was
alive, who dead. Then came shop talk: Where could you still
get the special glittery wormlike beads for classical
costumes, ones that wouldn't turn black after a few wearings?
Who was now making "mkot," the gilded replicas of royal
coronation crowns worn in the classical dance?</p>
<p>Mr. Chhieng also spent hours watching my videotapes of
Cambodian refugee dancers in America and in the Thai border
camps run by the Khmer resistance factions. He was on the
lookout for any pieces that might be missing in Phnom Penh,
and anxious to survey the quality of the field. At the TV
monitor, as in classes in Phnom Penh, he was a tough task
master. He gave a running commentary (in our mixture of
Khmer, French, English and body language). "To move an arm
like that is nothing," he said, imitating a graceful, fluid
movement from the screen. "It must engage the whole body --
and the spirit." Then he redid the gesture with a depth of
expression the first movement hadn't approached. But, he
hastened to add, "for the camp it's all right. It's good that
they're doing it." Another time, watching a boy play a
monkey, he leapt up in imitation: "It's easy like that. This
way {he dropped into a deep, wide plie} is much harder -- but
it's much more sprightly and expressive." Still, he added
quickly, "It's important that they're trying to keep it
alive. We're all Cambodians. The dance contains the soul of
Cambodia."</p>
