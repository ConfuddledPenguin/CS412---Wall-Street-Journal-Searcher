	<p class="article-leader">More than a century ago, the German philosopher Friedrich
Nietzsche announced the death of God. This dramatic statement
was intended to suggest that religion had ceased to serve as
an organizing principle for the lives of individuals or for
the rules of their association. Since Nietzsche, the God
pronounced dead was replaced in man's consciousness by
"socialism." And I want to match Nietzsche's announcement
with the comparable one that "socialism is dead" -- a
statement that seems much less shocking than Nietzsche's
because it is being heard throughout the world in 1990.
   In a very real sense, the loss of faith in socialism is
more dramatic than the loss of faith in God, because the god
that was socialism took on forms that were directly
observable. There were no continuing unknowns waiting to be
revealed only in another life, and the promised realization
of the socialist ideal could not be infinitely postponed.
Socialism promised quite specific results; it did not
deliver.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>One can only look back in amazement at the monumental
folly that caused the intellectual leaders of the world, for
more than a century, to buy into what F.A. Hayek called the
"fatal conceit" that socialism embodied. How did we come to
be trapped in the romantic myth that politically organized
authority could satisfy our needs more adequately than we
might satisfy them ourselves through voluntary agreement,
association and exchange?</p>
<p>This fatal conceit was almost universal. Let us now beware
of current attempts to limit acceptance of the socialist myth
to those who were the explicit promulgators and defenders of
the centrally planned authoritarian regimes of the Soviet
Union and its satellites. There were socialists everywhere,
in all societies and, even in the face of the evidence that
continues to accumulate, there are many who still cannot
escape from the socialist mind-set. And even for those of us
who have, however begrudgingly, acknowledged that the
socialist god is dead, there may not have emerged any faith
or belief in any non-socialist alternative. We may accept
socialism's failure; we may not accept the alternative
represented by the free market or enterprise system, even as
tempered by elements of the welfare state.</p>
<p>Socialists everywhere, confronted with the evidence that
economies organized, wholly or partially, on socialist
principles cannot deliver the goods, are now making desperate
efforts to redefine the term "socialism," which British
socialist and scholar Alec Nove defined in 1987 as a society
in which "the means of production of goods and services are
not in private hands."</p>
<p>It is now almost universally acknowledged that a
private-ownership, free-enterprise economy "works better"
than Mr. Nove's socialized economy, in which decisions are
made by state or cooperative agencies. The individualized
market economy "works better" than the socialized economy in
the sense that it produces more goods. But it also works
better in the sense that it allows individuals more liberty
to choose where, when and to what purpose they will put their
capacities to produce values that they expect others to
demand.</p>
<p>A threshold was crossed in the 18th century when we
learned how the rule of law, stability of private property
and the withdrawal of political interference with private
choices could unleash the entrepreneurial energies that are
latent within each of us. Humankind seemed near to the
ultimate realization of its social potential. How did the
socialist vision emerge to threaten, and in part forestall,
this future? And why did the principles of classical
political economy, which seemed so strongly to suggest the
relative superiority of a market economy, lose their
persuasive powers so quickly?</p>
<p>We must, I think, appreciate the rhetorical genius of Marx
and his ability to convert arguments advanced in support of
market organization into what could be made to appear to be
support for a particular distributional class, the
capitalists. By clever substitution of emotion-laden
terminology, the market system became "capitalism," and the
search of every person for his own advantage became the
profit-seeking of the greedy capitalists. This rhetorical
genius, coupled with totally erroneous economic analysis
embedded into pseudoscientific jargon about the laws of
history, was highly successful in elevating the
distributional issue to center stage, to the relative neglect
of the allocational and growth elements that were central in
the classical teachings.</p>
<p>(I speak as one who shared fully in the socialist
mind-set, from which, thanks to Frank Knight, I escaped
relatively early in my career. But I appreciate the appeal of
the Marxist-socialist ideas even if, now, I cannot explain
it.)</p>
<p>Recall that during its early decades, the Soviet Union was
held out as paradise by socialists in the West. After World
War II, Eastern Europe was absorbed into the Soviet political
orbit and the countries of Western Europe socialized their
economies to greater or lesser degrees. Even where economies
were largely allowed to remain free, Keynesian-inspired
macromanagement was supported by arguments about the tendency
of capitalism to generate massive unemployment.</p>
<p>Between the early 1960s and today, socialism became ill
and died. What happened? There were two sides to the coin:
"market success" and "political failure." The accumulation of
empirical evidence must ultimately dispel romance. And the
evidence did indeed accumulate to demonstrate that
free-market economies performed much better than politically
directed or planned economies. Contrast, for example the West
German "Wirtschaftwunder" with the demonstrable failures of
the socialist experiments in Britain in the late 1940s and
early 1950s. Honest evaluation suggested that the centralized
economies of the Soviet Union, China and East European
countries were not successful in producing goods and
services.</p>
<p>Ideas also matter. And here the record of the academic
economists remains, at best, a very mixed bag. The welfare
economists of the early and middle decades of this century
were almost exclusively concerned with demonstrating the
failures of markets, in order to provide a rationale for
political interferences. But the public-choice revolution in
ideas about politics, and political failures, was also
sparked primarily by academic economists.</p>
<p>When the behavioral models of economics are applied to
"public choosers" -- to those who participate variously in
political roles, as voters, politicians, bureaucrats,
planners, party leaders, etc. -- the romantic vision that was
essential to the whole socialist myth vanishes. If those who
make decisions for others are finally seen as just like
everyone else, how can the awesome delegation of authority
that must characterize the centralized economy be justified?</p>
<p>This loss of faith in politics, in socialism broadly
defined, has not, however, been accompanied by any
demonstrable renewal or reconversion to a faith in markets,
the "laissez-faire" vision that was central to the teachings
of the classical political economists. There remains a
residual unwillingness to leave things alone, to allow the
free market, governed by the rule of law, to organize itself.
We are left, therefore, with what is essentially an attitude
of nihilism toward economic organization. There seems to be
no widely shared organizing principle upon which persons can
begin to think about the operations of a political economy.</p>
<p>It is in this setting, which does seem to be descriptive
of the era into which we are so rapidly moving, that the
natural forces that generate the Leviathan state emerge and
assume dominance. With no overriding principle that dictates
how an economy is to be organized, the political structure is
open to exploitation by the pressures of well-organized
interests. The special-interest, rent-seeking, churning state
finds fertile ground for growth in this environment. And,
depending on the relative strength of organized interests, we
observe quite arbitrary, politicized interferences with
markets.</p>
<p>This setting, which I have referred to as Leviathan, has
much in common with the mercantilist-protectionist politics
that Adam Smith attacked so vehemently in "The Wealth of
Nations" in 1776. The same barriers that Adam Smith sought to
abolish are everywhere resurging; and the same arguments are
heard, both in support and in opposition. The arguments for
Leviathan's extensions are not versions of the socialist's
dream; they are, instead, simple efforts to claim a public
interest in a single sector's private profit.</p>
<p>There will be no escape from the
protectionist-mercantilist regime that now threatens to be
characteristic of the post-socialist politics in both Western
and Eastern countries so long as we allow the ordinary or
natural outcomes of majoritarian democratic processes to
operate without adequate constitutional constraints. If we
know that politics fails and that its natural proclivity is
to extend its reach beyond tolerable bounds, we must
incorporate constraints into a constitutional structure. A
depoliticized economic order is within the realm of the
possible, even if the accompanying faith in market
organizations is not fully regained. We can protect ourselves
against the appetites of the monster that the Leviathan state
threatens to become.</p>
<p>The organized polities of the nation-states, and the
associations among those states, must be kept within
constitutional boundaries. The death throes of socialism
should not be allowed to distract attention from the
continuing necessity to prevent the overreaching of the
state-as-Leviathan, which becomes all the more dangerous
because it does not depend on an ideology to give it focus.
Ideas, and the institutions that emerge as these ideas are
put into practice, can be killed off and replaced by other
ideas and other institutions. The machinations of
interest-driven politics are much more difficult to dislodge.
Let us get on with the task.</p>
