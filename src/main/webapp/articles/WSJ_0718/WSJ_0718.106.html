	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- The popular drug Prozac, widely hailed as
safer than other antidepressants, is being accused of causing
suicidal thoughts in some users.
   Yesterday, a New York woman sued the drug's marketer, Eli
Lilly & Co. of Indianapolis, charging that the drug caused
her to commit acts of self-destruction and to make attempts
at suicide. The suit, filed in state court in Suffolk County,
New York, seeks $150 million in damages.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"This `wonder drug' has produced some nightmarish
results," says Leonard L. Finz, a New York attorney
representing the woman. "We claim the drug wasn't properly
tested {and that} warnings of its horrendous effects haven't
been made to the public."</p>
<p>The lawsuit is the first of its type against the drug, but
it follows observations by several researchers that the drug
may inspire suicidal thoughts.</p>
<p>Eli Lilly says it doesn't comment on matters in
litigation. But a spokesman acknowledges that in May the
company alerted doctors to several newly observed problems
associated with the drug's use, including "suicidal
ideation." The spokesman says the alert was part of the
company's periodic updating of the drug's side-effect
profile. He also says "Prozac has received a lot of
publicity," including being on the cover of Newsweek and New
York magazine, but that Eli Lilly believes "information about
the drug should be communicated to people by their doctors,
not the media."</p>
<p>Officials at Lilly and the Food and Drug Administration
say that the charge that the drug may induce obsessive
thoughts of suicide is troublesome because it may be
impossible to determine whether Prozac or the patient's
underlying mental status is at fault.</p>
<p>The drug's association with suicide was first formally
reported in February in the American Journal of Psychiatry by
Martin Teicher, a Harvard University research psychiatrist.
Dr. Teicher's article identified six people who developed
"intense, violent suicidal thoughts" while taking Prozac.
None of the patients had previously experienced such
thoughts, the article said.</p>
<p>In an interview, Dr. Teicher said the drug produced
"intolerable" anxiety in which thoughts of self-destruction
were a natural consequence. "I think for some patients the
drug is going to cause a real problem," Dr. Teicher says. He
adds that since the report's release he has been told of 15
additional cases.</p>
<p>Prozac's problems may be due, at least in part, to its
success, and to overzealous prescribing by some doctors.
Sales of the drug are growing at a rate unprecedented for a
relatively new medicine. First released in late 1987, Prozac
is expected to zoom to $700 million in sales this year and
more than $1 billion next year, making it by far the best
selling drug for depression. Marketing officials suggest more
than a half million prescriptions are being written for it
each month.</p>
<p>Yesterday, Eli Lilly cited the rapid growth of Prozac when
it reported that its earnings increased 26% in the second
quarter from a year earlier.</p>
<p>But the drug's unusually swift rise to prominence and its
use by tens of thousands of patients has triggered a flood of
complaints about side effects to doctors, the FDA and Eli
Lilly. Several former users who say the drug caused severe
reactions have formed a nationwide self-help group. And a Los
Angeles-based consumer organization associated with the
Church of Scientology says it has received more than 800
calls from patients this year claiming the drug caused such
problems as severe edginess, mania and suicidal obsessions.</p>
<p>Officials at the FDA and Eli Lilly say they are monitoring
the reports but don't believe the number or types of
complaints are especially unusual for a drug used to treat
people afflicted with mental health problems. Lilly also says
it believes some of the complaints are being drummed up by
the Scientology group, which has a history of criticizing the
use of psychiatric drugs. Prozac's descriptive label for
doctors provides a lengthy list of side effects, from nausea,
nervousness and insomnia to mania and extreme agitation. Most
of those problems are also associated with other commonly
used antidepressants.</p>
<p>"At present, our reporting system hasn't picked up
{suicidal thoughts} as a problem more common than might be
expected in this population of users, especially given the
drug's high rate of use," says Paul Leber, the head of the
FDA's division of neuropharmocological products.</p>
<p>It was Dr. Teicher's article in February that suggested to
Mitchell Banks, a Long Island psychiatrist, that Prozac might
be causing problems for his patient, Rhoda Hala.</p>
<p>Mrs. Hala, the woman now suing Eli Lilly, says she was
given the drug in late 1988 to treat depression following
back surgery and side effects caused by painkiller drugs.
Soon after first taking Prozac, she became overwhelmed with
self-destructive impulses, she says, slashing her wrists and
other parts of her body "hundreds of times."</p>
<p>Mrs. Hala, 40 years old and married with two children, was
hospitalized several times for her behavior. Her doctor also
increased her dosage of Prozac. After she stopped taking the
drug, she says, her suicidal impulses disappeared. Mrs. Hala
says she was never depressed before the back surgery and
hadn't had suicidal thoughts before. She was taking a
tranquilizer called Xanax while on Prozac, but Prozac's label
doesn't specifically warn against this combination of
medicines.</p>
<p>Some prominent research psychiatrists say the drug can't
be judged by such anecdotal reports. "The drug is a good
antidepressant," says Jerrold Rosenbaum, a psychiatrist
associated with Harvard and Massachusetts General Hospital in
Boston. "But it may be found that some people are especially
sensitive to the drug's mode of action, which differs from
other antidepressants."</p>
<p>Prozac works by increasing the availability of a chemical,
serotonin, that carries signals between nerve cells. The drug
quickly gained favor among psychiatrists, not because it
relieves depression better but because it doesn't produce
constipation or the other annoying problems caused by the
other medicines. It also doesn't cause the heart problems
linked to other drugs.</p>
<p>"Patients can't hurt themselves easily by taking an
overdose," Dr. Rosenbaum says, "and that's a real concern
when treating" depressed patients.</p>
<p>Some researchers suggest that increasing serotonin may
drive some people to severe and intolerable edginess and that
such problems must be closely watched by doctors. But some
critics of the drug's widespread use say doctors aren't being
so careful.</p>
<p>Michael O'Brien, an activist with the Citizens Commission
on Human Rights in Los Angeles, says some people are being
given the drug for experimental uses that have been described
in research reports but haven't been approved by the FDA.</p>
<p>The organization, associated with the Church of
Scientology, has been very active in collecting reports of
adverse reactions related to Prozac. Mr. O'Brien was recently
contacted by Susan Carey of Jensen Beach, Fla., who says she
was given Prozac by a doctor to help her quit smoking. She
says she soon became manic, going on spending sprees and
ignoring her work and family. The problems ended when she
quit taking the drug, she says.</p>
<p>Eli Lilly is also testing Prozac as a weight-loss drug for
people with severe weight problems, and doctors believe the
drug is already being prescribed to some people for this use.
Other drug makers have noted Prozac's success, and several
are testing similar-acting medicines.</p>
