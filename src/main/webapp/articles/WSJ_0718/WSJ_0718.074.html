	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Prices surged on RJR Nabisco Inc. junk bonds
for the second day in a row, but most other bond prices and
interest rates were little changed.
   RJR Nabisco's bonds are surging in popularity because of a
huge $6.9 billion refinancing plan announced Sunday by
company officials. The plan is designed to ease the food and
tobacco company's enormous debt burdens and strengthen its
financial backbone.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>RJR's largest issue, which soared more than eight points
Monday, added another 2 3/8 points yesterday to close at 94
1/8. Investor enthusiasm about the RJR news spilled over into
other sectors of the junk bond market, helping to lift prices
of some issues by about half a point, or $5 for each $1,000
face amount.</p>
<p>But while trading volume in RJR bonds was heavy, volume
elsewhere in the junk-bond market generally was "very light,"
said Joseph Bencivenga, head of high-yield bond research at
Salomon Brothers Inc. Trading generally "was so thin that I
find it hard to describe what happened to the market as a
whole as much of a rally, aside from RJR where we saw a lot
of activity," he said."</p>
<p>Elsewhere in the credit markets, Treasury bond prices held
steady for the second day in a row. Yields on 30-year
Treasury bonds continued to hover about 8.45%. Rates on
short-term Treasury bills also were flat.</p>
<p>Treasury-bond trading was sluggish all day as investors
awaited a government report this morning on consumer prices
in June. Also this morning, Federal Reserve Board Chairman
Alan Greenspan will present the central bank's semiannual
economic and monetary report at a Senate Banking Committee
hearing.</p>
<p>In addition, traders are waiting for signs that the
government will take steps to slash its huge budget deficit.
If the government shrinks the deficit, that would reduce
borrowing pressures in the credit markets. And a large
deficit-cutting package might persuade the Fed to reduce
short-term interest rates further.</p>
<p>"My impression is that people are expecting at least a $50
billion to $55 billion cut in the budget deficit," said
Morgan Stark, president and chief executive of Chemical
Securities Inc. "The market will be very disappointed if this
isn't done, and if it isn't done in a timely, credible
fashion."</p>
<p>This morning's inflation report is expected to show a
moderate rise in consumer prices of 0.3% for June, according
to a survey of 21 economists by Dow Jones Capital Markets
Report. That would follow increases of 0.2% in both May and
April. Excluding the food and energy components, an increase
of 0.4% is expected, analysts say.</p>
<p>Inflation fears that haunted the markets early this year
now appear to be fading rapidly, with investors focusing
increasingly on growing signs of economic weakness. "We
definitely prefer bonds over stocks," says Arthur A.
Micheletti, vice president at Bailard Biehl & Kaiser, a San
Mateo, Calif., firm that manages about $1.3 billion for both
individuals and institutions.</p>
<p>"It's a coin's toss whether the economy already is in a
recession or merely heading for slow growth," Mr. Micheletti
said. Either scenario "would mean strong gains" for holders
of U.S. Treasury bonds, while the stock market is "an
accident waiting to happen."</p>
<p>Bailard Biehl has about half its individual clients' funds
in bonds, nearly all of which are in U.S. Treasury issues.
"This isn't the time to reach for yield" and buy lower-rated
bonds, he said. "This is a time to go for safety and
liquidity."</p>
<p>Junk, Corporate Issues</p>
<p>RJR Nabisco's surging junk bonds dominated activity in the
corporate-bond arena again yesterday.</p>
<p>RJR's pay-in-kind bonds posted especially large gains. The
company's 17% exchangeable pay-in-kind debentures maturing in
2007 climbed 2 3/8 points to 94 1/8 on the New York Stock
Exchange. And its 17 3/8% convertible pay-in-kind debentures
due in 2009 rose 1 1/2 points to 115 7/8. Pay-in-kind bonds
pay interest in the form of additional securities.</p>
<p>Trading volume was very heavy. Southland Corp.'s junk
bonds also posted solid gains as investors reacted with
relief to the company's announcement Monday that it had
agreed in principle on a restructuring proposal with a
bondholders' steering committee and a group of Japanese
investors.</p>
<p>That agreement averted a possible bankruptcy-law filing
and drove up prices yesterday of some Southland issues by 1/2
point to one point. The agreement differs significantly from
a previous debt-exchange offer from the company.</p>
<p>Southland, the troubled parent company of the 7-Eleven
retail convenience stores, previously had said it didn't
intend to make a June 15 interest payment on its senior
subordinated debt. That payment officially went into default
Sunday. Without an agreement from senior debtholders, the
company could have been driven into bankruptcy proceedings.</p>
<p>Separately, prices of investment-grade corporate bonds
were little changed on the day. Activity in the new-issue
investment-grade market has perked up lately, and several
bond specialists expect that to continue. "I think you're
going to continue to see more {investment-grade} corporate
supply" soon, said Thomas Pura, a partner at Goldman, Sachs &
Co.</p>
<p>Foreign Bonds</p>
<p>British government bond prices tumbled, erasing all of
Monday's gains, after the government reported an unexpectedly
large budget deficit for June.</p>
<p>Among actively traded issues, Britain's 11.75% bonds due
2003/2007 fell 3/4 point to 102 7/32 to yield 11.41%.
Britain's 12% bonds due 1995 declined 7/32 point to 99 3/4 to
yield 12.08%.</p>
<p>U.K. bonds, known as gilts, have been star performers in
the international bond markets during the past few months.
Several analysts expect the rally to continue this summer
because of growing signs of weakness in the U.K.'s economy
that could drive down interest rates, which move in the
opposite direction from bond prices. But yesterday's budget
deficit news brought the recent rally to an abrupt halt.</p>
<p>Britain's budget deficit totaled #2.6 billion ($4.69
billion) in June. That was sharply higher than analysts'
estimates of #1 billion to #1.5 billion. The bulging deficit
raises the possibility that the government will have to
resume selling sizable amounts of new gilts later this fiscal
year to meet its funding needs, economists said.</p>
<p>Separately, West German government bond prices slumped,
following the lead of futures prices. Several traders said
they had expected a temporary setback following the market's
week-long surge. Bonn's 8.75% bonds, due 2000, fell 0.35
point to 101.60 to yield 8.65%. Japanese bond prices also
fell, hurt by high short-term interest rates.</p>
<p>A Salomon Brothers Inc. report released in New York
yesterday predicted that inflation-adjusted yields on U.S.
government bonds will remain considerably lower than those of
major European countries through 1991.</p>
<p>Inflation-adjusted yields on U.S. government bonds now are
about 4%, said Nicholas Sargen, a director of bond market
research at Salomon. That, he said, is more than two
percentage points less than those on bonds of Germany,
France, Netherlands, and Canada. U.K. bonds have a real yield
of about 5% to 5.5%, according to the report by Messrs.
Sargen and John Lipsky of Salomon.</p>
<p>The report cited "heightened competition for funds in
Europe and increased uncertainty about financing requirements
for Germany and Eastern Europe" as the most important
considerations in keeping real European bond yields high.</p>
<p>Municipal Bonds</p>
<p>A large volume of new municipal bond issues hit the market
yesterday.</p>
<p>For example, New York sold $225 million of bonds through
competitive bidding. The winning bid came from a group of
underwriters led by First Boston Corp. The underwriters then
reoffered the bonds to investors at prices to yield from 6%
in 1992 to 7.15% in 2009-2020.</p>
<p>First Boston officials said the unsold balance among
underwriters was about $72 million. The bonds are rated
single-A by Moody's and S&P.</p>
<p>Investor demand for New York tax-free bonds typically is
strong among New Yorkers because of the state's very high
income tax rate. Moreover, New York City imposes a steep
income tax, too, and many voters fear Gotham taxes have
nowhere to go but up.</p>
<p>Connecticut offered $325 million of general obligation
bonds. The issue was tentatively priced by underwriters, led
by Merrill Lynch Capital Markets, to yield from 5.80% on
bonds due in 1991 to 6.95% in 20072010. The bonds are rated
double-A by both Moody's Investors Service Inc. and Standard
& Poor's Inc.</p>
<p>Treasury Securities</p>
<p>Treasury-bond prices were little changed again yesterday
as traders marked time ahead of today's economic news.</p>
<p>Among active issues, the Treasury's 30-year bonds were
quoted late in the day at 103 1/8, to yield 8.45%, unchanged
from the previous day.</p>
<p>"It was a very quiet, low volume session with minimal
price change," said William Sullivan, director of money
market research at Dean Witter Reynolds Inc.</p>
<p>Mortgage, Asset-backed Securities</p>
<p>Mortgage securities prices ended unchanged to slightly
firmer, after spending the session in stifling trading
ranges.</p>
<p>Only one major offering has been priced so far this week
-- a $122 million Fleetwood Credit Corp. issue backed by
loans for recreational vehicles that was priced yesterday by
First Boston Corp. as 9% securities at 99 18/32 to yield
9.204%.</p>
<p>Fleetwood Credit is a unit of Fleetwood Enterprises Inc.,
Riverside, Calif., whose products include travel trailers and
motor homes.</p>
<p>Among active secondary issues for August delivery,
Government National Mortgage Association 9.5% securities were
up 3/ 32 at 99 26/32, Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp. 9.5%
issues were up 2/32 at 99 1/8 and Federal National Mortgage
Association 9.5% issues were up 2/32 at 99 5/8.</p>
