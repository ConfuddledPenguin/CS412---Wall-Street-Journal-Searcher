	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Nynex Corp. Chairman William C. Ferguson,
eager to "separate sensationalism from facts," said his
company moved quickly in 1988 to investigate improper
activities by Nynex purchasing employees and disclosed its
findings fully to state regulators.
   However, Mr. Ferguson didn't dispute the few facts that
have emerged about a series of gatherings at Florida resorts,
dubbed "Perverts Conventions" by participating employees of
Nynex's Materiel Enterprises unit and some of its suppliers.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The week-long sessions, disclosed in The Wall Street
Journal last week, took place annually from 1984 to 1988.
Documents filed with the New York State Public Service
Commission by Nynex showed that activities included hiring
women to provide entertainment and sex for attendees. Nynex's
New York Telephone unit, under pressure to boost profits, is
trying to win approval from the commission of a $1.4 billion
rate increase.</p>
<p>Mr. Ferguson met with reporters in the company's boardroom
in midtown Manhattan to respond to questions concerning the
company's handling of its investigation. He said the
employees took the trips on their own time, although he
conceded there was some evidence suppliers may have paid for
some of the hotel rooms.</p>
<p>He said that commission investigators were given all
documents compiled in Nynex's 1988 investigation and that
they pledged that the documents wouldn't be released to the
public.</p>
<p>However, requests for information from commission lawyers
and analysts examining New York Telephone's latest rate
request indicate that the commission is still seeking
information about the Florida meetings.</p>
<p>The 1988 inquiry led to the dismissal of conference
organizers Lawrence Friedman, former vice president of
purchasing at Materiel Enterprises, and John Marino, who
reported to Mr. Friedman. In all, Nynex now says its
investigation "determined that eight individuals had violated
our code of business conduct," which barred meetings with
suppliers that could be construed as conflicts of interest.</p>
<p>The 1988 investigation wasn't the first by Nynex into the
conduct of Materiel Enterprises employees. Similar
allegations against Mr. Friedman and others arose in 1985 and
were investigated. But the findings weren't disclosed to
authorities because the company didn't find any evidence that
its code of conduct had been violated, said Mr. Ferguson.</p>
<p>Mr. Friedman sued Nynex in 1988 for emotional distress and
religious discrimination and the following year settled out
of court for $1 million. He also agreed to keep quiet about
the circumstances surrounding his dismissal. Mr. Ferguson
defended the payment as inexpensive compared with the
potential cost of a protracted court battle with Mr.
Friedman.</p>
<p>"I'm sick and tired of this," said Mr. Ferguson, a 38-year
veteran of the phone business who last year took over the
chairmanship and chief executive duties from Delbert C.
Staley. "I'm trying to get on with my administration and I'm
having to deal with all these things from yesterday." He said
he hadn't learned of the conventions until mid-1988.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the two executives who headed the purchasing
unit since 1984 have retained their jobs. Paul C. O'Brien,
who held the top spot between 1984 and 1985 when reports of
improprieties first surfaced, is now president of New England
Telephone. Peter L. Haynes has been president of the unit
since 1985.</p>
