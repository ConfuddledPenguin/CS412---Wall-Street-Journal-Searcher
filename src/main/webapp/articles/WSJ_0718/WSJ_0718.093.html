	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- The Senate Appropriations Committee approved
a fiscal 1991 budget plan that would wipe out new funds for
foreign aid sought by the Bush administration and cut more
than $2 billion from House-passed domestic-spending bills.
   The measure, adopted 24-4, bears the strong stamp of
Chairman Robert Byrd (D., W.Va.). In the absence of a formal
budget resolution, it will set the limits for spending bills
covering almost half of the federal budget for the fiscal
year beginning Oct. 1.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Total defense appropriations would be cut to an estimated
$283.6 billion, or more than 6.3% below current levels.
Though foreign aid would grow with inflation, the new limits
are significantly more severe than in the House. Direct
outlays for foreign aid in fiscal 1991 would be held to $12.6
billion, or $574 million below a House-passed
foreign-operations bill, and the tighter budget gives the
administration little or no leeway to restore funds it wants
for its military-aid program.</p>
<p>Among domestic programs, Mr. Byrd had less freedom than
his House counterparts in allocating increases among the
major subcommittees that will begin drafting bills as early
as today. Almost $800 million in new discretionary spending
would be provided for labor, health, and education programs,
for example. But senators still face difficult choices when
matched against comparable House figures, which are $800
million higher in fiscal 1991 outlays.</p>
<p>Subcommittees responsible for environmental, housing, and
law-enforcement programs will face the same political
difficulty when compared with the House, and the tighter
limits again hurt the Bush administration as it seeks to
restore funds for its troubled space program and its new
initiative to explore Mars.</p>
<p>The House cut practically all the money for the Mars
project from its bill covering the space program. Senators
will begin drafting their own version from a starting point
$630 million below the House for not only space but
environmental, housing and veterans' programs in fiscal 1991.</p>
<p>Republicans were most conspicuous in complaining about the
cuts, while the Democratic majority, out of respect for or
fear of their chairman, said little. Sen. Byrd, in turn,
quietly helped allies on both sides -- and himself. The three
subcommittees that fare best in comparison to the House
include Sen. Byrd's own Interior panel, as well as those
covering energy and water programs and the Treasury. On the
latter two subcommittees, the senior Republicans are Oregon
Sen. Mark Hatfield, the ranking GOP member on Appropriations,
and New Mexico Sen. Pete Domenici, an important ally on the
Senate Budget Committee in shaping the plan.</p>
<p>While the cuts from defense are comparable to those in the
House, the resolution builds in some modest leeway by making
$500 million more available for weapons and personnel
accounts while cutting more deeply from military construction
for foreign bases.</p>
