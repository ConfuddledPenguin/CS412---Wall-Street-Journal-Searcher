	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- The Senate Banking Committee passed a bill
that would give bank and savings-and-loan regulators the
power to close a financial institution that had been
convicted of money laundering.
   The regulators would be given that power in cases where
both the institution and high officials of the bank or thrift
had been convicted of money laundering. The regulators would
also be allowed to take over an institution convicted of
money laundering and replace its management.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The legislation, approved on a voice vote, is aimed at
combatting what law-enforcement authorities say is vastly
increased money laundering by the illegal drug trade.</p>
<p>Another provision, aimed at stopping money laundering in
unregulated check-cashing and foreign-exchange outlets, would
allow the Treasury Department to force banks and thrifts to
identify such outlets if they are depositors in the
institution.</p>
<p>The committee's bill is similar to legislation that passed
the House in April.</p>
