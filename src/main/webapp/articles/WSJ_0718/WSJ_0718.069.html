	<p class="article-leader">STAMFORD, Conn. -- Tosco Corp. said a tentative agreement
to sell its 50% stake in the Fort Meade Chemical Products
unit of its Seminole Fertilizer Corp. subsidiary had been
abandoned.
   The company, which also reported increased earnings, had
signed a letter of intent last April to sell its stake in the
phosphate acid production venture to a unit of Sinochem
American Holdings Inc., which owned the remaining 50% and
operated the unit. Sinochem is owned by the Chinese
government. Terms weren't disclosed, but the stake was worth
about $50 million, analysts said.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The breakdown in the talks was unexpected. "It came as a
surprise to us," said Chief Financial Officer Jefferson F.
Allen. "The fundamentals of the business have improved
substantially."</p>
<p>Tosco, an oil refiner, acquired Seminole last year for
$133 million, plus about $200 million in assumed debt from a
limited partnership whose partners are substantially the same
as a partnership that holds a 25% stake in Tosco. Tosco
recently abandoned efforts to sell its refining operation,
but hasn't yet completely abandoned efforts to sell Seminole,
Mr. Allen said.</p>
<p>Tosco, which last May moved its corporate headquarters
from Santa Monica, Calif., to Stamford, Conn., also reported
increased earnings, primarily due to strong margins at its
Avon oil refinery in California, caused by the unusual
circumstance of lower crude oil prices and higher gasoline
prices.</p>
<p>Second-quarter net income was $48.2 million or $1.52 a
share, up 72% from $28 million or 88 cents a share in the
year-ago quarter. Revenues, which now include Seminole,
climbed 73% from $334.2 million to $577.5 million. The
results include Seminole, which wasn't profitable. They also
include a $10 million expense for moving refinery offices
from Santa Monica and Bakersfield, Calif., to Concord,
Calif., and higher interest expense for the Seminole
acquisition.</p>
