group, Deutsche Bank AG, said it's in "intensive talks" aimed
at boosting its minority ownership of its big East German
banking venture to almost 100%.
   Georg Krupp, Deutsche Bank's management board member
responsible for Eastern Europe, said Deutsche Bank is
proposing "a powerful capital increase" in Deutsche
Bank-Kreditbank AG, a joint venture; East Germany's newly
formed financial holding company Deutsche Kreditbank AG holds
47%.</p>
