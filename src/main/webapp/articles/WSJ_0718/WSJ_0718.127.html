	<p class="article-leader">Adolph Coors Co. said its net income rose 49% while beer
shipments rose 14% in the second quarter.
   The beer, ceramics and aluminum company reported net of
$25.1 million, or 68 cents a share, compared with $16.9
million, or 46 cents a share. Net sales rose 12% to $475.4
million from $425.5 million. Shipments of beer rose to
4,831,000 barrels from 4,252,000 barrels.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>For the six months, the Denver-based company reported that
net more than doubled to $32.8 million, or 89 cents a share,
from $12.1 million, or 33 cents a share. Net sales rose about
16% to $869.7 million from $749.6 million, while beer
shipments rose to 8,811,000 barrels from 7,315,000 barrels.</p>
<p>The company said the largest increases in earnings came
from its Golden Aluminum Co., Graphic Packaging Corp. and
brewing units. Analysts attributed the growth in beer
shipments to Keystone, which was introduced last August, and
to double-digit growth in Coors Light sales.</p>
