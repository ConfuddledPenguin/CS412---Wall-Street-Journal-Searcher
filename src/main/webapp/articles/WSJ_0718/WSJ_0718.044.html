	<p class="article-leader">EVENDALE, Ohio -- General Electric Co.'s jet engine
division said the aviation subsidiary of Italy's Fiat Group
has signed up as a 10% partner on GE's new jumbo-jet engine
program, the GE-90.
   The Fiat unit, Fiat-Avio S.p.A. of Turin, Italy, will
share in GE-90 development, production and revenue, GE
Aircraft Engines said. GE has estimated development costs at
between $1.2 billion and $2 billion. The engine will compete
with products by United Technologies Corp.'s Pratt & Whitney
division and Britain's Rolls-Royce PLC in a market valued at
between $50 billion and $100 billion over 20 years, beginning
when the next generation of wide-body jets are launched in
the mid-1990s.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>GE announced this month that France's Snecma committed to
a 25% stake in the new engine. GE has said it wants to limit
its role in the GE-90 program to a 60% interest, while using
foreign partners to share the development costs and risk and
to help in marketing overseas.</p>
<p>For the GE-90, Fiat-Avio will develop the engine gearbox
and drive system and participate in the aerodynamic,
mechanical and structural design and development of the
low-pressure turbine, GE said.</p>
<p>Fiat also agreed to an 11% participation in a new GE
gas-turbine engine, the LM-6000, for marine and industrial
use, and to increase its role as a supplier of low-pressure
turbine parts for GE's existing CF6-80C2 jet engine, which
powers current wide-body aircraft.</p>
<p>GE, headquartered in Fairfield, Conn., has interests in
aerospace, financial services, broadcasting and industrial
products.</p>
<p>Separately, GE said it will lay off 670 workers, or 14% of
the work force at its Pittsfield, Mass., plant, which makes
products for the electric utility industry and the military.
About 80% of the cutback involves GE's Power Delivery &
Controls division. The remaining cuts will affect GE's
aerospace division at the plant.</p>
