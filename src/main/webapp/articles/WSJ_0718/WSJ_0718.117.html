Dutch food manufacturers, Bakker Lekkerkerk Holland B.V. and
K.B. de Souffle Specialist B.V., for an initial 71.6 million
guilders ($38.4 million).
   Perkins, which is attempting to build an integrated food
manufacturing and supply network across northern Europe, said
it will pay for the purchases through the issue of 30 million
convertible preference shares, expected to raise #28.9
million ($52.1 million).</p>

companies depending on future profitability, Perkins said.</p>
