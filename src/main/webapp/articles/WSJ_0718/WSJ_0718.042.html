	<p class="article-leader">High hospital costs in Kalamazoo are attributed by your
reporter ("Rival Operations -- Competitive Anomaly: Consumers
Pay More in 2-Hospital Towns," page one, June 6) to the
existence of competition between two hospitals, the
implication being that a monopoly would be better. The story,
however, also supports an even more ironic hypothesis -- that
Kalamazoo's large corporate purchasers of hospital services
are responsible for the high costs and their own plight.
   After years of trying to encourage the hospitals to
cooperate rather than compete (probably the cooperation
envisioned would have been unlawful under the antitrust laws
in any event), Kalamazoo's employers are apparently now
considering for the first time purchasing health care just as
they purchase other goods and services -- with price as a
central consideration. Theodore Cooper, M.D., who was quoted
as chairman of Upjohn Co. but who still sounds like the U.S.
assistant secretary of health he once was, admits, "We've
never tried to bid one {hospital} against the other." If
employers had negotiated with the hospitals for particular
services, demanding good quality and a competitive price in
return for their employees' business, the duplication of
services and high prices they complain of would never have
occurred.</p>
