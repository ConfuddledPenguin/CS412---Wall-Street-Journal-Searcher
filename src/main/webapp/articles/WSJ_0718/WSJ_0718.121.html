	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Investors who bought U.S. Treasury bonds this
year have booked modest returns. But the folks who trade the
government's debt are losing their shirts.
   Although $100 billion of Treasury securities are bought
and sold daily on Wall Street, making the Treasury bond
market by far the single biggest securities market in the
world, most bond traders can't make any money.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The problem: Too many bond dealers chasing too few
customers have squeezed profit margins to the bare bones. Ten
years ago, a dealer typically could expect to make a $1,250
profit on a $1 million trade of Treasury notes, said Richard
M. Kelly, president of bond dealer Aubrey G. Lanston & Co.
Now, that profit has shrunk to just $312.50, he said.</p>
<p>Nowhere is the suffering worse than at the nation's
primary dealers, an elite group of big commercial banks and
brokerage firms that buy and sell government bonds directly
with the Federal Reserve Bank of New York as it executes
monetary policy. They also are required to step up and buy
bonds at every Treasury auction of government securities; the
dealers try to quickly resell the securities.</p>
<p>"It's a very tough business," said Thomas Pura, a partner
at Goldman, Sachs & Co. and chairman of the government
securities division at the Public Securities Association, a
trade group. "Spreads really are razor-thin."</p>
<p>In reaction to the tough times, many dealers have slashed
staffs, and some have left the business. The latest victim is
Midland Montagu Securities Inc., a unit of Britain's Midland
Bank PLC that said yesterday it will close its primary
dealership and its U.S. private banking operation and lay off
about 140 employees.</p>
<p>In a speech before a group of dealers this year, New York
Fed executive vice president Peter D. Sternlight said more
than half of the U.S.'s 46 primary dealers lost money last
year, and many others barely broke even. As a group, he said,
the primary dealers posted a net loss last year for the first
time in more than a decade.</p>
<p>With Midland's departure, the number of primary dealers
has dropped to 42. Four weeks ago, Australia's Westpac
Banking Corp. left the business, and last year, two British
banks, National Westminster Bank PLC and Lloyds Bank PLC,
pulled out along with L.F. Rothschild & Co. Two more U.S.
firms were removed when Prudential-Bache Securities Inc.
acquired the brokerage business of Thomson McKinnon
Securities Inc. and when Drexel Burnham Lambert Group Inc.
filed for bankruptcy-law protection. Meanwhile, a few new
dealers have stepped up to the plate.</p>
<p>Despite the falling count of primary dealers, traders say
there are still too many. "People are getting out because
they can't make any money," said one dealer. "This industry
probably needs only 25 primary dealers. The others just get
in the way."</p>
<p>Belonging to the primary dealers group once was considered
a great privilege and honor. Membership was sought by big
foreign banks and securities firms, who viewed it as
necessary to being recognized as a global player.</p>
<p>Perhaps even more importantly, membership represented a
valuable way for dealers to attract new business. That's
because some institutional investors won't do business with
firms that aren't primary dealers.</p>
<p>But the government bond business has changed radically in
recent years, especially as more Japanese banks and
securities firms became primary dealers. Some U.S. dealers
complain that the Japanese firms, to gain market share,
sharply cut "spreads," or trading markups. In some cases,
they say, the Japanese firms didn't charge fees at all. That
practice may have partly been a reaction to Federal Reserve
regulations, which require primary dealers to maintain at
least a 1% share of the Treasury market.</p>
<p>"There was a tremendous incentive for foreign dealers to
do business they should not have been doing" just to keep
market share, said Robert A. Brusca, a senior vice president
at the U.S. unit of Nikko Securities Co. of Japan. "When you
are the new guys on the block, how else do you get people to
come to your store unless you cut prices?"</p>
<p>However, Mr. Brusca said that is changing now, and the
Japanese firms are no longer undercutting the market.</p>
<p>Oddly, the dealers are suffering when the U.S. Treasury is
flooding the bond market with a big supply of new government
debt. Some economists estimate that the Treasury will raise
about $70 billion of new cash in the current quarter,
excluding refinancing of maturing debt, an increase of $30
billion from last year's third quarter.</p>
<p>But what's missing is strong customer demand. With the
U.S. economic outlook uncertain, many institutional investors
have backed away from the Treasury market, dealers say. At
the same time, the savings-and-loan debacle has taken out of
the market many thrifts that once were active government bond
traders.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, U.S. interest rates haven't moved in any
direction long enough to stimulate excitement or produce big
trading opportunities. Dealers say they need volatile markets
to book decent trading profits.</p>
<p>So, getting spreads up again is proving difficult. The
foreign firms, including some of Japan's big institutions,
have found it particularly tough to eke out a living trading
U.S. government bonds.</p>
<p>Several Japanese banks, among the biggest financial
institutions in the world, have backed away from intentions
of building U.S. primary dealerships. But because of their
financial strength, reputation for being long-term investors
and high sense of self-esteem, Japanese firms with
dealerships aren't expected to give them up.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, an executive at one big Japanese securities
firm conceded that if his firm had been tossed out of the
dealer group as a result of trade and financial-market
friction between Washington and Tokyo, now an unlikely
prospect, it would have offered a welcome face-saving exit
from the business.</p>
<p>Traders said the only way to make money these days is to
do risky speculative trading, where dealers bet on the
direction of the bond market. In this area, commercial banks
are at a big disadvantage because they can't commit enough
capital to allow them to take big bond positions.</p>
<p>Michael Moore, a managing director and head of government
trading at Continental Bank, agreed that the key to making
money now is proprietary trading, where firms trade for their
own accounts, instead of for customers.</p>
<p>"The only dealers who make money are those who have a risk
profile and understand arbitrage and derivative products such
as bond options and futures," he said.</p>
<p>All this means that many smaller Treasury dealers may have
difficulty staying afloat. Six big U.S. firms -- Merrill
Lynch & Co., Goldman, Sachs & Co., Salomon Inc.'s Salomon
Brothers Inc., Morgan Stanley Group Inc.'s Morgan Stanley &
Co., Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. and CS First Boston Inc.'s
First Boston Corp. -- together have 30% to 35% of the
Treasury market, according to Peter Bass, a managing director
at S.G. Warburg & Co. in New York. That leaves 36 other
primary dealers chasing the remaining 65% to 70%.</p>
<p>"There are virtually a whole slug of players in that 1% to
2% market-share" range, he said. "If you couple the
market-share problems with the fact that customer volume is
down, volatility down, the spreads almost nonexistent, it's
been a pretty tough time the last two years."</p>
<p>Even so, Mr. Bass said: "It's still important to be a part
of the U.S. Treasury business. We still very much believe
that to be a fully integrated global investment banking
concern, it is very important to have an eye on the dollar
and U.S. interest rates. The best way to do that is to be a
primary dealer."</p>
<p>Several foreign firms -- bankers name Deutsche Bank AG,
New Japan Securities Ltd. and a unit of Bank of Nova Scotia
are seeking to be designated as primary dealers. A unit of
Swiss Bank Corp. joined the club in March. In December,
subsidiaries of Union Bank of Switzerland and Britain's
Barclays Bank PLC were designated dealers.</p>
<p>Still, Robin S. Koskinen, vice chairman of First Chicago
Corp.'s securities unit, said, "Over the past two years,
there are a lot of people who would love to have lost only $5
million in this business."</p>
