	<p class="article-leader">Dime Savings Bank of New York reported second-quarter net
income doubled despite a higher loan-loss provision and more
assets that aren't earning interest.
   Net reached $10.1 million, or 44 cents a share, from $5
million, or 22 cents a share, in the year-earlier period. The
earnings include four cents and 12 cents a share,
respectively, from use of tax-loss carry-forwards.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The bank said it had added to its reserves for possible
losses on loans made in commercial real estate and
multifamily housing, but stressed that it is in compliance
with federal capital standards. Dime expects nonperforming
assets will continue to rise at least through 1990.</p>
<p>The bank provided $9 million for possible losses on loans
in the quarter, compared with $4.2 million a year earlier. At
June 30, the allowance for loan losses equaled 1.01% of total
loans vs. 0.27% a year ago. Nonperforming assets, those not
earning interest, equaled $754.8 million, or 6.5% of total
assets, compared with $550.6 million, or 4.7%, at Dec. 31,
1989, and $407.4 million, or 3.3%, at June 30, 1989.</p>
