	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- A Swiss franc rally that began and ended
within a half-hour depressed the dollar against all major
European currencies. The selling of yen to buy the Swiss
currency limited the dollar's decline against the Japanese
unit, however.
   Official comments that credit policy in Switzerland will
remain tight began yesterday's most important
foreign-exchange activity, highlighting the market's
interest-rate sensitivity.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The high-yield currencies benefited from the market's
focus. A surge by the Canadian dollar in the last hour of New
York trading pushed it to a 10-year high. The British pound
and the Australian dollar also gained strongly on the day.</p>
<p>A U.S. trade report that met expectations was generally
ignored by currency traders, who have recently paid attention
only to news that has a direct bearing on investment yields.</p>
<p>Instead, the market prepared itself for Federal Reserve
Board Chairman Alan Greenspan's testimony today before the
Senate Banking Committee. Dealers hope that the head of the
U.S.'s central bank will indicate whether easier monetary
policy is in store.</p>
<p>"There is no doubt that interest rates are the dominant
factor in the currency markets right now," said Nicholas
Sargen, director of research for Salomon Brothers.</p>
<p>The dollar ended yesterday at 1.1533 Canadian dollars,
down from C$1.1585 late Monday. The close was the worst for
the U.S. dollar since September 1980.</p>
<p>Anthony Franz, a senior account executive for corporate
foreign exchange at the Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce in
New York, said most of the buying of the Canadian dollar came
after futures trading at Chicago's International Monetary
Market ended for the day. He said Canada's announcement of a
four-part bond offering beginning Aug. 1 helped Canadian
dollar demand.</p>
<p>Participants in the Canadian bond auction would first have
to buy Canadian dollars, putting upward pressure on the
currency's value.</p>
<p>Rumors that the Swiss central bank was preparing to ease
monetary policy have recently been supported by daily
declines in the base Swiss lending rate. The Swiss franc had
been declining as a result, most notably Monday.</p>
<p>But yesterday, a spokesman for the Swiss National Bank
reiterated that the growing supply of Swiss francs, which
caused Switzerland's base interest rate to decline to 10.5%
yesterday from 11% Friday, is the result of market activity
rather than intentional policy. This time the
foreign-exchange market listened and took quick profits on
long, or overbought, dollar and yen positions.</p>
<p>Late in the New York trading day, the dollar was quoted at
1.4045 Swiss francs and 1.6440 marks, down from 1.4180 francs
and 1.6547 marks late Monday in New York. The U.S. currency
was also changing hands at 147.80 yen, down from 148.15 yen
in New York late Monday. Sterling was trading at $1.8165,
above $1.8040.</p>
<p>In early trading in Tokyo Wednesday, the dollar was
trading at 147.30 yen, down from Tuesday's Tokyo close of
148.20 yen. Meanwhile, the U.S. currency was trading at
1.6420 marks, down from Tuesday's Tokyo close of 1.6562
marks.</p>
<p>The Swiss franc buying began about an hour before noon in
New York. "When the Swiss-dollar rate came down, it came down
very fast. We called but couldn't get through. We had a hard
time getting a price," said Ty Tan, a New York dealer with
Deutsche Genossenschaftsbank.</p>
<p>The selling of dollars for Swiss francs dropped the U.S.
currency with equal suddenness against the mark.</p>
<p>The U.S. unit weakened only marginally against the yen,
which was also sold against the Swiss franc. The Swiss unit
climbed almost two yen between its intraday extremes of
104.07 yen and 105.81 yen. The Swiss currency closed in New
York yesterday at 105.23 yen, above 104.48 yen late Monday.</p>
<p>"Just because there are more Swiss francs floating around
doesn't mean they are easing credit policy," Walter Simon, an
assistant vice president for Bank Julius Baer, said of the
Swiss central bankers. Because currencies are traded as much
on interest-rate expectations as on interest rates, Mr. Simon
said, the reaffirmation of Switzerland's tight money policy
was significant.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, any mention by the Fed chairman of U.S. credit
policy easing, even if only to repeat remarks made last week,
could cause dollar-selling, according to Keith Raphael, Chase
Manhattan's second vice president for foreign exchange. In
buttressing themselves against such a reaction, dealers bid
the dollar lower against the yen in late New York trading
after holding it steady most the session.</p>
<p>On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for current
delivery settled at $362 an ounce, down $1.30. Estimated
volume was a light 2.5 million ounces.</p>
<p>In early trading in Hong Kong Wednesday, gold was quoted
at $359.60 an ounce.</p>
