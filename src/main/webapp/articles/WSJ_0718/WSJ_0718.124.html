	<p class="article-leader">ATLANTA -- Coca-Cola Enterprises Inc. reported a 43% jump
in second-quarter net income, after a big gain from a
property sale, on a 3.3% revenue increase.
   Net rose to $55.3 million, or 42 cents a share, from $38.8
million, or 26 cents a share, a year earlier. Second-quarter
revenue was $1.12 billion, compared with $1.09 billion.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Coca-Cola Enterprises, of which Coca-Cola Co. owns 49%, is
the largest bottler of the soft drink.</p>
<p>Stripping away a mishmash of unusual items, the bottler's
second-quarter earnings from operations rose about 3.9%,
execeeding analysts' estimates. The company's earnings have
been disappointing for several quarters because soft-drink
price increases haven't covered rising costs for raw
materials and marketing.</p>
<p>But compared with price increases of 2% to 3.5% in recent
quarters, Coca-Cola Enterprises said it raised its soft-drink
prices to retailers by 4% in the quarter.</p>
<p>In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange
yesterday, Coca-Cola Enterprises common rose 25 cents a share
to close at $16.25.</p>
