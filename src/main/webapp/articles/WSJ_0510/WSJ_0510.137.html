	<p class="article-leader">FRANKFURT, West Germany -- Official unemployment in East
Germany surged in April to 64,948 job seekers from 38,313
people the previous month, the East German state news agency
reported.
   Citing statistics from East Germany's Ministry for Labor
and Social Affairs, the agency said the number of job
vacancies in the country receded substantially to 73,558
places by the end of the month. It didn't provide
month-earlier data.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>East Germany only recently began releasing unemployment
data and its current data are considered to be incomplete. As
unproductive state-owned companies are taken public as part
of East Germany's economic integration with West Germany,
many existing jobs are expected to be lost, swelling
unemployment rolls.</p>
