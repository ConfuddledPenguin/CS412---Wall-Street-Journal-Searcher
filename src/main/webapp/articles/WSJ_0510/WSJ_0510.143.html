	<p class="article-leader">CHICAGO -- A federal prosecutor implicated four unindicted
Swiss franc futures traders -- in addition to the three
indicted traders on trial here -- as allegedly taking part in
an illegal scheme to defraud customers.
   The allegations against the four traders in the Swiss
franc pit at the Chicago Mercantile Exchange are a sign the
federal futures trading probe will focus on alleged
wrongdoing by more than the 48 individuals who have so far
been indicted on fraud charges at the Merc and the Chicago
Board of Trade. The allegations came during the government's
opening argument in the first of three scheduled trials of
futures traders and a clerk charged last year with stealing
from customers.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Exchange officials have pointed to the limited number of
indictments as evidence that wrongdoing in their markets is a
relatively rare event. But the government's opening salvo in
the Swiss franc case indicates that many more exchange
members may have the propriety of their trades questioned by
prosecutors.</p>
<p>Sixteen Japanese yen futures traders on the Merc and 12
soybean futures traders and a clerk on the Board of Trade
will stand trial in September on fraud charges in two
separate trials. In documents previously filed relating to
the soybean futures case, the government alleged that its
undercover agent in that pit made illegal trades with "scores
of unindicted co-conspirators."</p>
<p>The government said the Swiss franc traders on trial,
Robert Mosky, Danny Scheck and David Zatz, were aided in
their alleged scheme to steal from customers by four other
traders: Gary Kost, Michael Joyce, Michael Ansani and Scott
Schumer.</p>
<p>Prosecutors gave no indication as to whether they had
enough evidence to seek grand jury indictments against the
four traders.</p>
<p>Mr. Kost is an employee of Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. and
is a broker in the Swiss franc pit buying and selling futures
contacts for his employer and its customers. Mr. Joyce is an
unaffiliated broker who handles a significant number of
Shearson orders. A Shearson official said he was unaware of
the government allegations and couldn't comment.</p>
<p>Mr. Kost couldn't be reached for comment. A woman
answering the phone at Mr. Joyce's home referred a call to
his lawyer, Terry Grimm, who couldn't be reached for comment.</p>
<p>Mr. Ansani, one of the most active independent traders in
the Swiss franc futures pit, couldn't be reached for comment.
Mr. Schumer also trades for his own account, and declined to
comment on the government allegations.</p>
