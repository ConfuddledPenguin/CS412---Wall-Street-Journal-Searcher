	<p class="article-leader">Money-market mutual fund assets dropped for the sixth week
in a row, as investors found other places to put their cash.
   Assets of 427 taxable funds fell by $1.2 billion in the
week ended Tuesday, to $377 billion, according to
IBC/Donoghue's Money Fund Report, a Holliston, Mass.-based
newsletter.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"I take my cue from the auction" of three-year Treasury
notes, said Walter Frank, chief economist for Donoghue's.
"Money funds are getting some competition."</p>
<p>Individual investors bought record amounts of three-year
notes at the auction Tuesday, getting a yield of 8.74%.
Demand from individuals also was high at yesterday's auction
of 10-year notes, when the yield was 8.88%. Six-month T-bills
yielded 8.28% at Monday's auction.</p>
<p>Average money fund yields, meanwhile, remained just below
8%, where they've been for the last three months. Donoghue's
reported that the average seven-day compound yield, which
assumes reinvestment of dividends, was 7.96% for the second
consecutive week.</p>
<p>It's still possible to get yields approaching 9% in a
money fund, although it requires some looking. The top
performing fund in the latest week, Dreyfus Worldwide Dollar,
had a seven-day compound yield of 8.91% and a few other funds
offered more than 8.5%.</p>
<p>Yields aren't likely to change much in the next few weeks.
Average maturity of the funds' investments remained at a
fairly long 44 days, about what it has been for most of the
year. Money funds invest in such things as commercial paper
(short-term corporate IOUs), bank certificates of deposit and
short-term Treasury securities.</p>
<p>Longer maturities usually are thought to indicate that
portfolio managers expect rates to decline because they make
it possible to retain comparatively high yields. Mr. Frank of
Donoghue's said he expects rates, and hence money fund
yields, to remain stable for the next couple of months
because of uncertainty about the strength of the economy.</p>
<p>The average seven-day simple yield of the taxable funds
slipped to 7.66% from 7.67%. The average 30-day simple yield
remained at 7.68% and the average 30-day compound yield
stayed at 7.98%.</p>
<p>Yields on tax-free funds declined. The average seven-day
compound yield, for instance, eased to 5.74% from 5.79%. That
is equal to 7.97% for an investor in the 28% tax bracket and
8.57% for someone paying 33%.</p>
<p>Assets of the 220 tax-exempt funds tracked by Donoghue's
rose by $180.6 million to $75.6 billion. Average maturity
lengthened by a day to 42 days.</p>
