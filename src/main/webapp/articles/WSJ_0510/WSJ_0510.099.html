	<p class="article-leader">CUPERTINO, Calif. -- The Macintosh System 7, a software
upgrade to Apple Computer Inc.'s Macintosh that was
originally slated for a summer debut, now won't be ready
until year end.
   Apple has billed the product as "the most dramatic advance
in Macintosh software since 1984. Nevertheless the company
tried to put a good face on the development, downplaying its
effect on pressure from competing systems such as Microsoft
Corp.'s Windows 3 product and others.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The announcement came at a Macintosh developers
conference, where developers were given early versions of the
product to test.</p>
<p>"We told everybody last year that we were going to shoot
for late summer," said Jim Davis, director of systems
software marketing. "What we're committing to now is the end
of the year."</p>
<p>"It's probably for the better," he said, because the delay
will give developers more time to test the limits of the new
system, which incorporates new functions into the popular
machine, such as ease of access to large data bases.</p>
<p>"Software is hard," Mr. Davis added. "To get within five
or six months {of a forecast} is pretty good."</p>
