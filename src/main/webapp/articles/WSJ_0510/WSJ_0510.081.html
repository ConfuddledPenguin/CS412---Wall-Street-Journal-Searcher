	<p class="article-leader">ZWEIBRUECKEN, West Germany -- A half-dozen U.S. airmen are
gathered around a tree stump anchored to the floor of
Heiney's bar, absorbed in the task of pounding nails into it.
Whoever drives home his nail first wins.
   Between turns with the hammer, the young servicemen draw
absently on their beers and nod to the thundering rock music.
It is only a Tuesday night, but Philip Bochicchio knows he is
turning a profit. The saloonkeeper jabs a thumb at the busy
dartboard, the packed bar and the group around the stump.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"Americans like to have a good time," says Mr. Bochicchio,
an American who has lived here for most of his 38 years. But
he doesn't expect his booming business to last forever. "When
they leave, I leave," he says.</p>
<p>Across town, the office of Gerd Fallboehmer's furnace and
drainage firm is cluttered with contracts and service awards
from U.S. military bases and housing compounds outside town,
which account for 60% of his business. Mr. Fallboehmer notes
a change in how the locals view the American presence.</p>
<p>"A lot of people used to grumble into their beers that we
don't need them here," he says. "But they're talking a little
different now that {withdrawal plans are} cutting to the core
of their existence. We have to rethink everything, and there
are no alternatives in sight."</p>
<p>The Cold War was money in the bank for the scores of West
German communities where U.S. troops have been based since
World War II. But as German reunification nears and the
likelihood grows that foreign troops will leave for good,
many of these garrison towns are realizing too late that
their communities relied too heavily on military spending.</p>
<p>In late January, U.S. Defense Secretary Richard Cheney
dropped a bombshell on Zweibruecken's business community by
confirming a dreaded rumor: The U.S. air base here, home to
the 26th Tactical Reconnaissance Wing, is to be closed in
1993, and the 7,000 military personnel and dependents are to
be withdrawn.</p>
<p>Their departure threatens 2,500 jobs in this city of
33,400, and about $83 million in annual business. Officials
fear this is only the first step in a regionwide U.S. troop
cut that casts doubt on every fifth job in the area.</p>
<p>Older Zweibruecken residents aren't sure the U.S. should
rush out of West Germany with the fate of Soviet President
Mikhail S. Gorbachev's reform programs in question. But the
primary concern for most is one of finances. In Mainz, for
example, Mainz Industries Panzerwerk G.m.b.H. employs 5,000
workers solely to repair and maintain American tracked
military vehicles. A U.S. Army decision to cut its repair
programs threatens half of the company's jobs, Mainz
officials say.</p>
<p>Three years ago, the U.S. European Command calculated that
the U.S. military pumps about 15 billion marks ($9.05
billion) into the West German economy annually, the bulk of
it from 29 major U.S. installations in seven of West
Germany's 11 states. That total, which includes local
spending by 252,000 U.S. servicemen and their 100,000
dependents, as well as base contracts extended to German
firms, is supplemented by the expenditures of the more than
100,000 British, French, Canadian, Belgian and Dutch troops
in West Germany.</p>
<p>Of course, many West Germans see benefits in an allied
troops reduction. Big urban areas are eager to get their
hands on valuable property denied their developers for years.
The government of the wealthy central German state of Hesse
is eyeing the huge American air base that abuts Frankfurt's
international airport, as well as the U.S. air base in nearby
Wiesbaden. Developers are lining up for the U.S. army's
priceless real-estate holdings in Frankfurt itself.</p>
<p>But the picture is a little different in
Rhineland-Palatinate, the state between France and the Rhine
River where Zweibruecken is located. It has eight North
Atlantic Treaty Organization air bases and the greatest
concentration of troops in West Germany, a situation born of
the logic that the river is a natural defense against a
Soviet-bloc attack.</p>
<p>The U.S. fighters that regularly roar overhead on training
missions generally cause little comment, except when they
crash and kill civilians on the ground.</p>
<p>"It will be a big loss when they go," says Cornelia
Winkelmann, day manager at a local hotel that gets half its
business from military transients. "On the other hand, there
is always that fear" of military airplane crashes.</p>
<p>"For Hesse, an American withdrawal is like hitting the
lottery," says Rainer Bruederle, deputy premier and economics
minister of the Rhineland-Palatinate state government. "It
has a financial-services center with unbelievable growth that
needs the housing and the real estate." But in his state, he
adds, the possibility of a troop withdrawal has generated
only muted enthusiasm.</p>
<p>The U.S. military is the biggest employer in this part of
the country. Mr. Bruederle estimates that as much as
two-thirds of his state's 70,000 U.S. troops, plus their
dependents, will be gone by the end of the decade. About
60,000 regional jobs are in jeopardy. "There is a lot of
handwringing going on here," he says.</p>
<p>But while regional promoters are touting a program called
"Computer Chips Instead of Jet Planes," they acknowledge that
prospects of attracting growth industries are grim. "Nobody
ever thought about what we could do without the military,"
says chamber of commerce Director Karl Herzberger.</p>
<p>"We made the mistake of assuming they would always be
here," says Heinz Moosmann, a local journalist. "It's going
to set off a chain reaction through this state's entire
economic structure. It's a mistake by the Americans to make
this decision thousands of kilometers away without first
talking to us. It's alienating -- even arrogant."</p>
<p>A full-scale pullout also bodes ill for the housing
markets in rural garrison towns that have depended on U.S.
troops for demand. In Zweibruecken, base personnel occupy
about 600 houses and apartments.</p>
<p>Much of the housing currently used by Americans could
stand empty unless the town can attract new industries. Even
the huge air base might be of little use. Town officials talk
vaguely of converting the facility into an industrial park,
but they wonder if decades of oil and aviation-fuel spillage
has contaminated the soil. Worse, locals fear that NATO will
retain the vacated air base for future emergency use, denying
it to the community.</p>
<p>Mr. Bruederle, the state's deputy premier, is torn between
his state's economic problems and Germany's new role in
history. Reflecting the prevailing opinion in Bonn, he
describes the U.S. as an indispensable ally, but he adds that
the time has come for it to begin leaving German soil for the
two countries to define a more equal partnership.</p>
<p>And, he says, "we also have to recognize that the American
taxpayer can't be persuaded to continue paying for the
security of those rich and sassy Europeans now that the
threat is nearly zero."</p>
