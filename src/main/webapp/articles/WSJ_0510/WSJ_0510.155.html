	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- The stock market's advance over the past week
and a half finally faltered, as prices finished mixed amid
weakness in bonds and a sell-off in the dollar.
   The Dow Jones Industrial Average broke a string of seven
consecutive advances by easing 0.68 to 2732.88.
Earnings-related selling in Woolworth and weakness in a few
other blue-chip issues put pressure on the average.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Other market measures, however, managed to extend their
winning streaks. Standard & Poor's 500-Stock Index went up
0.85 to 342.86, the New York Stock Exchange Composite Index
gained 0.38 to 187.49 and the Dow Jones Equity Market Index
rose 0.46 to 318.68.</p>
<p>Market speculation that the Treasury's auction of $10
billion in 10-year notes, the second stage of its quarterly
refinancing, had been disappointing sent the market to
session lows in the last hour of trading.</p>
<p>But after the Treasury released the results of the note
sale, which were in line with market expectations, prices
quickly recovered as bonds bounced off their lows and
stock-index futures reached sharp premiums to the cash
indexes, sparking index-arbitrage buying in stocks.</p>
<p>Other arbitrage-related buy programs, involving the sale
of index futures and the purchase of baskets of stocks to
profit from price differences between them, had surfaced
early in the session to lend support to the market.</p>
<p>Despite the late improvement, Treasury notes and bonds
showed declines of as much as 1/2 point, or $5 per $1,000
face amount, in late dealings.</p>
<p>Analysts also noted the dollar's downturn, attributed to a
growing belief that U.S. interest rates may have reached a
peak, as a drag on the market. In late New York trading, the
dollar was quoted at 1.6360 marks and 156.50 yen, down from
1.6573 marks and 157.62 yen late Tuesday.</p>
<p>Edward P. Nicoski, managing director of technical analysis
at Piper, Jaffray & Hopwood, Minneapolis, said the market
appears headed for some slippage during the next one to two
weeks after approaching the upper end of its trading range
this year. "I'd be real concerned about tomorrow just because
of the dollar situation," he said.</p>
<p>Others said today's final stage of the Treasury
refinancing -- a sale of $10 billion in 30-year bonds -- may
pose problems for stocks if it doesn't go well and interest
rates rise.</p>
<p>Woolworth, which reported that its fiscal first-quarter
earnings went up 5.5% from the year-ago level, dropped 1 to
60 5/8. The results for the latest period were on the low end
of analysts' forecasts.</p>
<p>Other blue chips to weigh on the industrial average
included Westinghouse Electric, which went down 1 1/2 to 74;
Aluminum Co. of America, off 1/2 to 63 1/2, and USX, down 1/2
to 32 7/8.</p>
<p>SmithKline Beecham, whose first-quarter earnings were in
line with analysts' forecasts, gained 1 to 37 3/4 in New York
Stock Exchange composite trading of 1.9 million shares.
Pretax profit fell 6.8% from the year-earlier period on a
pro-forma basis, which takes into account the merger of
SmithKline Beckman and Beecham Group last year, while sales
rose 15%.</p>
<p>Another drug stock, Bristol-Myers Squibb, gained 1/2 to 58
1/2 and topped the Big Board's list of most active issues as
2.2 million shares were traded. The brisk activity apparently
was spurred by talk that the New England Journal of Medicine
would carry two positive reports and a favorable editorial on
the company's AIDS drug DDI in today's issue, market contacts
told Dow Jones Professional Investor Report. Also, Sanford C.
Bernstein reiterated its buy recommendation on the issue,
partly because of the expected articles.</p>
<p>Warner-Lambert gained 7/8 to 108 1/2. The company told
investors attending a health care conference in Baltimore
that it is "on target" to achieve its goal of at least a 16%
rise in earnings per share this year. Eli Lilly, which was
also scheduled to appear at the conference, rose 3/4 to 69 on
1.1 million shares.</p>
<p>Sotheby's Holdings plunged 3 1/8 to 16 1/2 on 1.3 million
shares amid disappointment with its sale of contemporary art
Tuesday night. About 37% of the art works that the auction
house put up for bids weren't sold, and many other pieces
were sold at prices below Sotheby's lowest published
estimate.</p>
<p>Eastman Kodak added 1/2 to 38 1/8. The company said it
expects to post "higher sales, better earnings and improved
cash flows" later this year because of its restructuring
efforts; it also forecast annual sales gains of 20% in
Eastern Europe for its photography operations.</p>
<p>Federal Express dropped 1 1/2 to 52 1/8.</p>
<p>Deutsche Lufthansa confirmed that it is holding talks
along with "other parties" to acquire a minority stake in DHL
Worldwide Express, seen as a possible defensive move against
an aggressive overseas expansion by Federal Express. Others
in the talks reportedly include two Japanese firms, Nissho
Iwai and Japan Air Lines.</p>
<p>Shaw Industries skidded 2 7/8 to 30 1/4. Merrill Lynch and
Wheat First Butcher & Singer lowered estimates of the
company's earnings for its fiscal fourth quarter, which ends
in June. The company acknowledged results are slightly behind
internal projections, but wouldn't elaborate.</p>
<p>Sherwin-Williams jumped 2 to 38 1/8. The company said it
is unaware of any reasons for the move.</p>
<p>Stone Container fell 7/8 to 16 1/2. The Canadian
Paperworkers Union has selected three paper mills owned by
the company as the target of contract negotiations that will
set the pattern for most of the forest-products industry in
eastern Canada.</p>
<p>PNC Financial dropped 1 1/4 to 36 7/8 amid speculation
that the company might be facing problems in its financial
dealings with NVRyan, a Virginia-based home builder. But PNC
said that its loan exposure to NVR is "modest" and the loan
is current in principal and interest.</p>
<p>Nalco Chemical rose 1 1/4 to 53. Salomon Brothers
reiterated a buy recommendation on the stock and said the
company can be considered an environmental play because it
sells chemicals for water and waste treatment.</p>
<p>Mattel rose 1/2 to 24 after declaring a common dividend of
three cents a share, its first payout since June 1983.
Separately, its board authorized the repurchase of as many as
500,000 shares over the next 12 months to fund a stock-option
plan.</p>
<p>American Capital Management & Research gained 3/4 to 9
1/8. Primerica, which already has an 82.6% stake in the
company, agreed to swap 0.3 share of its common for each of
the shares it doesn't own. Primerica finished unchanged at 29
5/8.</p>
<p>Xtra dropped 3/8 to 22 1/8. The company posted a loss from
continuing operations of $1.66 a share for the March quarter
and cut its dividend by 33%, to 12 cents a share; it called
the reduction temporary.</p>
<p>The American Stock Exchange Market Value Index rose 0.95
to 348.53. Volume totaled 14,560,000 shares.</p>
<p>California Energy, which plummeted 1 7/8 Tuesday,
rebounded 5/8 to 10 3/8. The company said it had arranged
financing for its proposed acquisition of some of Chevron's
geothermal operations.</p>
<p>Greiner Engineering went up 3/4 to 15 3/4. The company
signed a contract with the Hong Kong government to serve as
planning and engineering consultant for the development of a
new airport.</p>
<p>Forest Laboratories gained 3/8 to 37 7/8 after reporting
that net income for the fiscal quarter ended in March rose
about 26% from a year earlier.</p>
