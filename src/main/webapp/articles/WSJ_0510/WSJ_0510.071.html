	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- A federal bankruptcy judge in Cincinnati
refused a request by B. Brothers Realty Limited Partnership,
landlord of the Manhattan Bloomingdale's store, to permit it
to pursue an action to terminate that store's lease.
   Judge J. Vincent Aug Jr. threw out that request, ruling
that, for procedural reasons, B. Brothers' actions violated
the Bankruptcy Code. The judge called B. Brothers' actions
"vexatious," according to two lawyers at the hearing, and
assessed sanctions against the landlord, which was
represented by the New York law firm of Pryor, Cashman,
Sherman & Flynn.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>At the hearing, Judge Aug also extended the period during
which Federated Department Stores Inc. and Allied Stores
Corp. have the exclusive right to file a reorganization plan
for the two Campeau Corp. retail units. Judge Aug gave
Federated and Allied until Sept. 12 to file their plan. The
company's creditors hadn't objected to the extension.</p>
<p>In bankruptcy cases, the debtor has a right to file its
own reorganization plan before creditors have a chance to
suggest an alternative. But the debtor must file within a
designated period or lose that right.</p>
<p>In court documents, B. Brothers charged that Federated had
breached its lease by improperly transferring its interest in
the store lease to a unit, Bloomingdale's Inc. B. Brothers
also argued that Federated had violated its rights by
pledging the lease as security for new financing after
Federated filed for bankruptcy-court protection on Jan. 15.</p>
<p>David Heiman, counsel to Federated, said B. Brothers'
arguments are "based on a distinction without a difference."
No rent payments have been missed.</p>
<p>In assessing sanctions, the judge said he would require B.
Brothers to pay the legal fees incurred by Federated in this
matter.</p>
<p>After the hearing, Frederick Danziger, a lawyer
representing B. Brothers, said, "We find what happened
extraordinary. We obviously just want to review the
transcript before commenting further. {We} view the judge's
action as very surprising."</p>
