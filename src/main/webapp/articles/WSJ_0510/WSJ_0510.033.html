	<p class="article-leader">Aetna Life & Casualty Co. is trying to withdraw from the
personal auto-insurance market in Pennsylvania.
   Although the insurer filed a lawsuit last week challenging
the constitutionality of two laws that bar its withdrawal
from Massachusetts, Pennsylvania is the first state where it
has started the process to leave the auto-insurance business.
It has begun sending out nonrenewal notices to its 200,000
policyholders in the state. Aetna has also begun cutting back
on its auto-insurance business in other states.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Aetna, the fifth largest auto insurer working in
Pennsylvania, expects to have pulled out completely in one
year.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Hartford, Conn., company also amended a
complaint filed in February in U.S. district court in
Philadelphia, asking the court to enjoin the Pennsylvania
insurance commissioner from taking any action to block
Aetna's withdrawal from the auto-insurance market in this
state.</p>
<p>Insurance regulators view Aetna's action as a violation of
a 1968 law that governs the circumstances allowing an insurer
to stop renewing policies in Pennsylvania. The insurance
department will issue a temporary order to block Aetna's
action today.</p>
<p>Earlier this week, the insurance department asked a state
court to prevent Harleysville Mutual Insurance Co. and a
Safeco Corp. unit from not renewing their auto-insurance
policies in Pennsylvania.</p>
<p>New auto-insurance legislation passed last February
required insurers to offer drivers rate reductions of 10% to
22% in premiums. Yet, more than 100 companies have failed to
comply with the new law last week, when rate filings
incorporating the rollbacks were due. Some asked for rate
boosts, and two other companies tried to pull out entirely
from the market.</p>
<p>Aetna filed for a rate increase, averaging 24.7% for all
classes of drivers. The company said the filing was returned
without comment by the insurance department.</p>
<p>"The inability to receive adequate rate relief, coupled
with the burdensome rollback provisions of the new state auto
insurance law, makes this decision necessary," said John J.
Martin, president of Aetna's personal financial security
division.</p>
