	<p class="article-leader">BSN Corp. said a Houston investor group including Pelham
Investment Partners L.P. expressed interest in acquiring all
BSN shares owned by management "at prices significantly above
the current market price."
   But Michael Blumenfeld, president of the Dallas
sporting-goods maker, said managers "are unwilling to pursue
any proposal for our shares or control of BSN when a
definitive operating plan by the potential acquirers has not
been received or discussed."</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>In a Securities and Exchange Commission filing, the Pelham
group said it is in "preliminary discussions" with Mr.
Blumenthal, who owns or controls about 15%, of BSN. The
group, which said it holds 6.63% of BSN, is interested in
possibly buying "a substantial block" of BSN common, but less
than a majority of the total outstanding. If it buys a block
of shares, the group said it will seek representation on and
may seek control of BSN's board.</p>
