	<p class="article-leader">MOSCOW -- Like a hen clucking at a chick, Bella Lukyanova
shoos a hopeful client into position before a video camera.
The customer, modestly clad in a plain knit skirt and blouse,
braces herself.
   "Shhhh]" Mrs. Lukyanova commands, pressing a finger to her
lips. A video is about to be made: a taped proposal of
marriage.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Mrs. Lukyanova is a modern Soviet matchmaker. Her private
International Marriage Agency promises its female clientele
the moon -- or rather, the Man in the Moon. It seeks husbands
for them in the faraway West, where all the men are said to
be rich. Its videotapes, featuring 60 clients, will go to
dating agencies in the U.S., Canada and Australia if Mrs.
Lukyanova's grand plans go through. Although she has yet to
send a single tape abroad, and is extremely vague about her
Western contacts, she already has a catchy corporate name:
the "Moscow Matchmaker."</p>
<p>"What do you think?" she asks. "I looked it up in my
English dictionary and saw the word `matchmaker.' Will men in
the West understand what it means?"</p>
<p>Mrs. Lukyanova's international brand of matchmaking is a
novelty here. But matchmaking itself is an old tradition that
is being revived. Though the boomlet is biggest in the
budding private sector, Communist officials support it too.
Soviet planners fret over falling birth rates and rising
divorce rates in the western Soviet Union. Communism, they
reason, needs a cupid.</p>
<p>The Moscow City Council already runs a marriage bureau, to
which lonely-hearts come to find mates in a 5,000-name card
file. But now private, Western-style dating agencies are
flourishing under such trendy names as "Dialogue" and "Union"
too. One, in the Ukraine, offers its clients videotapes,
counseling by "psychologists and sexologists," and
matchmaking on a computer identified as built by "future
radio-electronics engineers."</p>
<p>Moscow newspapers are catching on, accepting personal ads
once rejected as Western decadence:</p>
<p>I am expecting a baby in September. A blue-eyed brunette
32 years old, height 170 cm {5 feet 7}, higher education. I
hope to meet a kind and courageous man with no bad habits,
who would be capable of becoming a good husband and a father
to my baby. (Ad No.) 125565, Moscow.</p>
<p>The best-known ancestor of today's matchmakers appeared a
century ago in the stories of Sholom Aleichim, a Ukrainian
author, and were popularized in the Broadway musical "Fiddler
on the Roof." The Aleichim tales of Tevye the Dairyman
depicted Ephraim the Matchmaker at work, promoting a match
with "a young man who is something special from special-land]
Top quality] This man is rich, chockfull of money." As it
turns out, the aged suitor flees town and his creditors.</p>
<p>"Matchmakers, you know, can persuade a wall," Mr. Aleichim
writes.</p>
<p>Arranged marriages still occur in parts of Soviet Central
Asia and the Transcaucasia region, says Tatiana Ryabycheva,
director of the Moscow City Council's Matchmaking Service. "I
can't say arranged marriages are bad," Mrs. Ryabycheva
allows. In time, love can develop.</p>
<p>I would like to meet a kind, cheerful, responsive girl of
no more than 25 years old. About myself: Have graduated from
a vocational school, was married before, no children. Hobby:
Music, literature. One of the conditions of a future mate: A
move to the Polar North region in the near future. Moscow,
Central Post Office, c/o Sergei A. Shumskiy.</p>
<p>Mrs. Ryabycheva is from the modern Soviet school of
matchmaking. A psychologist, she opened Moscow's first and
only official matchmaking service in 1985. In her small,
rundown office, the thoughtful, plump brunette in black
leather boots settles behind her desk for a chat. "Coffee?"
she offers, reaching for a jar of instant and her electric
kettle.</p>
<p>From her client list of 5,000, she says, she arranges
about 100 marriages a year. And that isn't easy. In her
files, women outnumber men by a ratio of 3 to 2 -- a
demographic vestige of the millions of men slaughtered in the
Great Patriotic War 45 years ago. Many female clients bring
unromantic baggage, such as children from a previous
marriage. Many others are in their 30s and 40s, with
established careers and single-woman habits. However hungry
for a husband, they can't stomach the spoiled, domineering
boors they meet normally. Her advice to these lovelorn ladies
is simple: Yield.</p>
<p>"We teach them to place the man on a pedestal," she says.
However non-feminist it sounds, she says, in the Soviet Union
"it's easier for a woman to adapt. Men are extremely
conservative."</p>
<p>I am looking forward to meeting a man of deep culture,
broad education, energetic, regarding himself as a highly
moral person, who would like to make a true family based on
the traditions of the Russian intelligentsia. About myself:
Height 169 {about 5 feet 7}, 39 years old, energetic, work in
a university. Absolutely provided for. 141009, passport No.
XX111-IK 509121.</p>
<p>As the videotape rolls, the international matchmaker, Mrs.
Lukyanova, cues a client to speak into the microphone about
her dream husband. Off-camera, she holds a Western "beat box"
aloft: It provides background music to tug the heartstrings
of wealthy, Western viewers -- a schmaltzy Russian folk tune
with balalaikas and accordions.</p>
<p>"I have big experience in television," Mrs. Lukyanova
boasts. She is a medical-news reporter on Soviet TV who, like
many Muscovites these days, is dabbling in free enterprise.</p>
<p>She certainly appears to have grasped the profit part of
capitalism. She charges her clients 280 rubles -- a month's
wage. If their videotape snares a Western mate, the
prospective bride will pay 1,000 rubles more. The husband
will pay, too, in hard currency. While Mrs. Lukyanova has
already accepted her clients' payments up front, for reasons
that are unclear, she refuses to disclose any details about
how, or even whether, the Western end of the operation will
work.</p>
<p>But some in the West believe her video Valentines will
find a warm reception in the post-Cold War world, where
things Soviet are becoming chic. Like the mail-order Asian
brides sometimes advertised in New York newspapers, the
Soviet women may appeal to some men as old-fashioned
homebodies, happy to be barefoot, pregnant and in the
kitchen. "There's a certain percentage {of U.S. males} who
say they don't like American women because they're so
business-oriented," explains Kurt Morrow, a franchisee of Los
Angeles-based dating service "Great Expectations," which
boasts 80,000 members.</p>
<p>But the view of such international romance is a bit dimmer
back home. In Stalin's day, Mrs. Lukyanova's clients would
have had to honeymoon in Siberia, because marrying a
foreigner was illegal. And even now, emigrating with a
foreign spouse is difficult -- and controversial. Mrs.
Lukyanova for instance, arouses suspicion and even outrage
among the others who work in the Moscow art gallery where she
has rented space for videotaping.</p>
<p>"I don't like this woman at all," says a young gallery
attendant, Alla Logova. The matchmaker, she says, is preying
on her clients' yen for foreign climes and rich husbands. And
no matter how difficult life is becoming in Moscow, the women
shouldn't leave. "They should stay here and work to makes
things better."</p>
<p>The prospective brides disagree, of course. One, awaiting
her taping session, sits filling out a matchmaking
application. She wears her best dress, a flowing violet gown
with black velvet bodice. A matching choker necklace supports
a small black onyx stone. She appears flustered on being
introduced to a male Western visitor. "Oh, I must get
serious," she says, removing her glasses and rising from her
chair.</p>
<p>She identifies herself as Marie, a 29-year-old secretary
at a television station. And to prospective husbands, she
says, she would describe herself as "slim, romantic, and
talkative. I like sewing my own clothes." She doesn't dislike
Moscow, she says, but simply hasn't had any luck finding a
husband here. So she thought she'd take a chance on Mrs.
Lukyanova. "Nobody can guarantee success, but it's
interesting to try."</p>
<p>And what kind of husband does she want? "A man I can
trust. Honest, kind and clever -- and handsome." She pauses,
then adds: "Money isn't so important."</p>
<p>She giggles at her questioner: "Are you married?"</p>
