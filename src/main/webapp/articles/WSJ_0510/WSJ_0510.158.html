	<p class="article-leader">The Agriculture Department is expected to report today
that the nation's production of winter wheat will jump
roughly 35% from last year.
   The biggest improvement is expected to occur in Kansas,
the biggest wheat-producing state, which was dogged by
drought for two years. The wheat harvest there this summer is
expected to total roughly 420 million bushels, nearly double
the harvest of last summer.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Most analysts expect the Agriculture Department to project
a national winter wheat harvest of 1.963 billion bushels,
compared with 1.454 billion bushels last summer. The report
is the Agriculture Department's first official forecast of
1990 wheat production. Dry weather through the winter had
fanned concerns that a third year of drought would further
deplete U.S. wheat stockpiles, which already are at their
lowest levels in more than 15 years.</p>
<p>But regular rainfall in March and April caused an
astonishing improvement in the crop, which some grain
analysts expect to be the second- or third-largest harvest in
the state. "It is the best I've ever seen," said Steve Freed,
senior grain analyst at Dean Witter Reynolds, Chicago.</p>
<p>Most of the U.S. crop is called winter wheat because it is
planted in September and October and harvested in June and
July. Kansas and several other states in the Southern Plains
region grow the hard red variety of winter wheat, which is
used to make everything from white bread to all-purpose
flour.</p>
<p>The second big variety of winter wheat, which is called
soft red, is grown in Illinois and Indiana.</p>
<p>Two wheat crops that are in jeopardy are grown in Northern
Plains states such as North Dakota and Montana. Drought
conditions have lingered for two years in some areas where
spring wheat and durum are grown. The crops are used to make
pasta, among other things.</p>
<p>The Agriculture Department won't make any prognosis on
these wheat varieties today because they are just being
planted. However, some parts of North Dakota have received as
little as 38% of their normal rainfall so far this year, and
there is little sign that the dry pattern will ease anytime
soon, said Peter Leavitt, executive vice president of Weather
Services Corp., Bedford, Mass.</p>
<p>Despite problems in the spring wheat belt, the price of
wheat in the U.S. has been slipping in recent months because
of the improvement in the winter wheat-growing areas.</p>
<p>In trading at the Chicago Board of Trade, the price of the
soft red winter contract for May delivery rose 1.5 cents a
bushel to settle at $3.795.</p>
<p>Wheat prices rose in sympathy with a strong rise in the
prices of corn and soybean futures contracts. Commodity funds
were heavy buyers of these contracts for technical reasons.
The price of soybean contracts for delivery over several
months rose at least 13 cents a bushel.</p>
<p>In addition to the wheat crop report, analysts will study
a supply-and-demand estimate for corn, scheduled for release
by the Agriculture Department. Among other things, grain
analysts are interested in whether the department increases
its estimates of corn exports.</p>
<p>The department won't directly project the size of the corn
crop, which is currently being planted. Some grain analysts,
however, suspect that a continuing rally in corn prices
prompted corn farmers to plant more land than the 4% increase
projected by the Agriculture Department in March.</p>
<p>Katharina Zimmer, an analyst at Merrill Lynch, New York,
said corn farmers might have planted roughly 76.5 million
acres, up about 5.8% from last year. If good growing weather
continues through the summer, U.S. corn production might top
eight billion bushels for the first time since the 1986
harvest.</p>
<p>In other commodity markets yesterday:</p>
<p>ENERGY: Gasoline prices surged, leading crude oil prices
higher as well. June delivery gasoline was up 1.49 cents a
gallon to 63.97 cents on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
June delivery West Texas Intermediate crude was up 71 cents a
barrel to $18.99. Supplies of gasoline have tightened,
especially along the Gulf Coast. Many refineries, which
temporarily ceased operations during recent months for
maintenance turnarounds, have remained off line far longer
than expected. According to Lawrence Goldstein of Petroleum
Industry Research Foundation, stricter environmental
requirements have made revamping the refineries more
time-consuming. He predicts that gasoline supplies will be
especially scarce during May and June. Lending support to his
theory was a report by the American Petroleum Institute
released Tuesday showing that daily U.S. gasoline production
and supply declined last week. Output and inventory levels
also remain below levels during a similar period last year,
the report indicated.</p>
<p>COPPER: Futures prices surged on Japanese buying of the
metal and a reported new miners strike. The most active
contract, July, was strongest, rising 5.35 cents a pound to
$1.1750 and setting a new life-of-contract high of $1.18. The
soon-to-expire May delivery was up four cents to $1.2440.
July was strongest because it has more speculative
participation than May, whose last trading day is May 29, one
analyst said. However, he noted, the buying by
computer-oriented funds, which prevailed in the July
contract, tended to exaggerate the advance. The Japanese
buying was in the form of call options in London, analysts
said. A call option is a right to buy a futures contract for
a specific month. Last week, holders of option contracts in
London decided to exercise their right to buy the underlying
futures contracts on the options' last trading day, which
caused futures prices to rise sharply. The London Metal
Exchange subsequently called in all trading cards of futures
brokers to see if there had been any activity that unduly
influenced the market. As of yesterday, according to one New
York analyst, the London exchange hadn't taken any action and
the issue appeared to be closed. "There had been at least a
little concern about what might happen," he said. Workers at
the OK Tedi mine in Papua New Guinea went on strike yesterday
over wages and promotions, Reuters reported. The mine
produces about 230,000 tons of concentrates, which contain
about 100,000 to 120,000 tons of copper after refining, a New
York dealer estimated. In Peru, the union representing
workers at the state-owned Centromin's 17 installations
issued a 72-hour strike notice, analysts said. If there is no
agreement on wage demands by tomorrow, the workers will go on
strike on Saturday, analysts said. Centromin is Peru's
largest producer of lead, zinc and silver and its
third-largest copper producer, accounting for about 12% of
that nation's copper output. Workers at Southern Peru Copper
Co. returned to work last week, but there still hasn't been a
new labor agreement. The workers have presented demands to
the company and if there isn't an accord, they threatened to
go on a threeday strike on either Sunday or Monday, analysts
said. A spokesman for Southern Peru in New York couldn't
confirm the reports, but said the workers' return to the
mines last Friday was unconditional.</p>
<p>PRECIOUS METALS: Futures prices were higher. June delivery
gold advanced $1.70 an ounce to $373.70. July silver was up
3.5 cents an ounce to $5.0930. July platinum, which an
analyst said appeared to be oversold Tuesday, rebounded on
reports of some Japanese buying and closed with a gain of
$7.30 an ounce at $486.50. There has been some Japanese
demand for platinum bullion as prices eased recently, but
apparently it picked up somewhat yesterday, the analyst said.
The principal supporting factor in gold was a weak dollar,
according to the analyst, who said the influence of the
dollar overcame continuing speculation that the Soviet Union
and South Africa might sell gold. He said reports had
circulated that the Soviet Union had been a seller of gold,
"but I don't believe it." He said he also didn't believe
other, unconfirmed reports that South African gold mines were
curtailing production because of low prices.</p>
