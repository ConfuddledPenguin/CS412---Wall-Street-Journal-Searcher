	<p class="article-leader">DALLAS -- Integra-A Hotel & Restaurant Co. said it and
several other companies signed agreements that would raise
new capital and allow Hallwood Group Inc. and affiliates to
sell their 13% stake in Integra.
   Integra, which owns and operates hotels, said it expects
the agreements to lead to a shake-up of its board and to
substantial changes in the company's management. They would
also lead Hallwood, a New York merchant bank and Integra's
biggest shareholder, to substantially end its relationship
with the company, Integra said.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Integra said Burrus Investment Group Inc., New Orleans,
agreed to make a $10 million, five-year secured loan with an
interest rate of four percentage points above the prime rate.
The agreement also calls for Integra to give Burrus six-year
warrants to buy as many as 1.8 million shares of Integra
common for 46.25 cents each.</p>
<p>An affiliate of Burrus, meanwhile, agreed to purchase
578,763 Integra shares, or 6.5% of total common shares
outstanding, from Hallwood, according to Integra.</p>
<p>Separately, Integra said a unit of Westbrooke Hospitality
Corp., a Dallas hotel operator, agreed to provide centralized
hotel operating services to most hotels currently operated by
Integra. Integra would receive an option to acquire the
subsidiary between 1993 and 1995.</p>
<p>Also, 867 Jennings Investment Co., a private company owned
by a relative of a Westbrooke principal, agreed to purchase a
6.5% Integra stake from Hallwood, Integra said.</p>
<p>In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange,
Integra closed at 46.87 cents a share, up 3.12 cents.</p>
