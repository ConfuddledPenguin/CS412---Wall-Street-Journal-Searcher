	<p class="article-leader">PHILADELPHIA -- This week's uptick in one chemical
company's shares caught analysts by surprise and prompted
some to wonder: "What's up, Ethyl?"
   The Street is intrigued by Ethyl's Tuesday announcement
that it will seek federal approval for a gasoline additive
designed to cut air pollution.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>With all the environmental hoopla and government
initiatives to reduce automobile emissions, the Street is
finding "an opportunity to take a new liking to Ethyl," says
one analyst. Ethyl jumped 2 1/8 Tuesday, before subsiding 3/8
yesterday to 27 1/2.</p>
<p>Several analysts say that if the additive is approved --
and that's a big if at this point -- Ethyl's annual earnings
could grow as much as $1 a share above projections and the
stock could rise to the high 30s within two to three years --
with $5 of that coming from the additive.</p>
<p>The manganese-based additive, known as MMT, could have a
potential market of $350 million a year if used in all
gasoline sold in the U.S. Ethyl estimates potential sales
initially at $100 million to $150 million a year.</p>
<p>"This could be the right product at the right time" to
help oil refiners and auto manufacturers meet stricter Clean
Air Act standards, says Leonard Bogner of Prudential-Bache
Securities.</p>
<p>Even the most bullish analysts, however, warn that chances
for approval are probably only 50% or slightly better. The
U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, which must issue a
decision within six months, is concerned that the additive
could actually increase certain types of emissions --
hydrocarbons -- that contribute to smog. And the auto
industry has previously opposed MMT on grounds that it could
damage pollution-control equipment, especially catalytic
converters.</p>
<p>Charles LoCastro of Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette says he
isn't comfortable recommending the stock because chances of
approval are only "50-50." He notes that the EPA twice
rejected the additive, in 1978 and 1981, and there isn't any
sign that car makers will be more supportive this time.
Ethyl's stock is fully valued at 27 1/2 and stands to decline
from there if MMT fails again, Mr. LoCastro says.</p>
<p>Ethyl says results of exhaustive testing will convince
even the most hardened skeptics. The company drove a fleet of
48 new cars more than 75,000 miles each to compare tailpipe
emissions and reliability using unleaded fuel with and
without MMT. Ray Wilkins Jr., a senior vice president of
Ethyl, says the additive produced a striking 20% reduction in
nitrogen oxide emissions, but a 6% increase in hydrocarbons,
causing an overall 7.5% reduction in emissions, including
nitrogen oxides, hydrocarbons and carbon monoxide.</p>
<p>Many cars using MMT in the test met strict nitrogen oxide
emission standards being proposed in Congress, and none
violated any existing standards (including those for
hydrocarbons), Mr. Wilkins says. Even with increased tailpipe
hydrocarbons, Ethyl argues, there could be a drop in
hydrocarbons overall because the additive would allow
gasoline refiners to make fuel that is less susceptible to
evaporation. Yet the projected overall 7.5% reduction in
tailpipe emissions still wouldn't meet standards that
Congress is considering mandating for the smoggiest cities.</p>
<p>"I'm very optimistic we'll have support from the auto and
oil industries and environmentalists," Mr. Wilkins says. The
additive, which would be marketed under the name HiTEC 3000,
has been used widely in Canada for more than a decade with no
apparent ill effects on cars or public health. Athough Ethyl
invented the additive in 1954, so far the U.S. has allowed
its use only in leaded fuel, which accounts for just 6% of
gasoline sales.</p>
<p>Mary Smith, an EPA official in charge of reviewing Ethyl's
test results, said she couldn't comment on the additive's
chances of approval. But, she said, EPA will scrutinize
closely whether it would reduce the ability of cars to meet
hydrocarbon standards. Spokesmen for Exxon and General Motors
said they couldn't comment until they review Ethyl's test
results.</p>
<p>Though the additive could become Ethyl's fastest-growing
product, some analysts like its other businesses. Mr. Bogner
calls Ethyl an "aggressive buy" that could earn $2.10 a share
this year and $2.40 next year. If the additive is approved,
he might raise his 1991 estimate five cents to 10 cents a
share. Ethyl, based in Richmond, Va., "could trade in the low
30s over the next six to nine months" without the additive,
and in the high 30s within two years if MMT is approved, he
says.</p>
<p>John Henry of Merrill Lynch Capital Markets has
recommended Ethyl for some time, in part because of the
additive's potential. His estimates are $2.05 this year and
$2.35 in 1991, and he says MMT could be worth an extra 20
cents to 30 cents a share in 1991 and a $1 a share in several
years: "All this proposed legislation is creating markets for
products that help gas burn cleaner."</p>
<p>Other companies are benefiting from the drive for cleaner
fuels. Arco Chemical reports fast sales growth for MTBE, an
ether-based product that increases octane and reduces
emissions when blended with gasoline. Ethyl says its additive
can be used with MTBE or other agents to provide greater
reductions in nitrogen oxides.</p>
