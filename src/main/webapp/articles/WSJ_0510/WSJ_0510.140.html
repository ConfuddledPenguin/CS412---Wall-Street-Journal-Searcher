	<p class="article-leader">SEOUL, South Korea -- A $3 billion jet fighter
co-production deal between the U.S. and South Korea is in
jeopardy because Seoul is demanding that the U.S. hand over
sensitive aviation technology.
   The Korean government sent a letter this week to the
Pentagon saying final negotiations for the Korea Fighter
Project had hit a snag because of what it called U.S. refusal
to compromise on the technology transfer issue.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>In Washington, Pentagon officials said both governments
have invested too much effort and political capital in the
project to pull out at the last minute. One official familiar
with the project suggested that the South Korean letter may
be designed to win last-minute concessions from the U.S. He
said South Korea would face the same restrictions that apply
to the McDonnell Douglas plane if it opted for any other
U.S.-made aircraft.</p>
<p>The Koreans are threatening to delay or even scuttle the
deal to buy 12 McDonnell Douglas Corp. F/A-18 jet fighters
made in the U.S., assemble 36 more from U.S.made kits and
co-produce 72 more jets in Korea under the direction of the
St. Louis company. Seoul chose the McDonnell Douglas jet over
General Dynamics Corp.'s F-16 last December.</p>
<p>People in the U.S. military say the dispute over
technology transfer surprised them, because negotiations were
almost completed and documents were expected to be signed at
the end of this month. "We had a draft document that everyone
had high confidence in," one person said.</p>
<p>But the U.S. doesn't want to give in to Korea's
last-minute demands. "It is our understanding that we have a
framework for a memorandum of understanding. The U.S. will
stand by what is in the original agreement," a Pentagon
spokesman said. "There are obstacles, but they aren't
obstacles to scuttle the agreement."</p>
<p>An accord hashed out over months of negotiations in 1988
and 1989 allowed Korean companies to license U.S. technology
so they could learn how to build planes themselves and yet
not infuriate a Congress grown wary of creating competitors
for U.S. business. Such coproduction arrangements are
commonplace with other countries.</p>
<p>But Korea now wants technology that the U.S. has kept on a
restricted list. Korea's wish-list includes the jets' radar
warning device, the radar itself, composite materials
technology, the high-heat-tolerant parts of the engines that
require special metallurgical skills and the top-secret
software for the on-board computer. "The U.S. has taken the
position that certain things shouldn't be transferred," a
military official in Seoul said.</p>
<p>The new demands could delay the project for at least a
year if they aren't resolved before June 5, when the pact is
supposed to start wending its way through Congress on a
special track to ease passage. And because the U.S. is taking
a hard-line position on the technology issue, the Koreans are
said to have threatened to scuttle the whole deal and begin
the process of picking a new fighter. The selection of the
F/A-18 took almost two years.</p>
<p>The KFP project was expected to get through Congress with
little difficulty. But the new demands put that in jeopardy,
say officials in Washington, because it would give new
ammunition to the tiny, but vocal, forces in Congress that
oppose the coproduction deal. "It is off the screen right
now. But all it needs is another incident for the issue to
come back stronger than ever," said Clyde Prestowitz, a trade
expert and a critic of the fighter project because of the
technology involved. Adds a Pentagon spokesman, "Technology
transfer is certainly a sensitive issue in the administration
and in Congress."</p>
<p>Similar technologies were at the center of a controversy
last year over the Japanese FSX project, the codevelopment of
a new-generation fighter. The FSX sparked strong opposition
in Congress and the Commerce Department, though it was
approved.</p>
<p>Officials of the Korean Ministry of Defense refused
comment, saying everyone involved in the matter was out of
the country, including Maj. Gen. Lee Woo Shik, who signed the
letter to the Pentagon. Kim Chong Whi, the president's
adviser for national security, who is said to be behind the
plan, refused comment and referred the issue to another
general, who also happened to be out of the country.
High-ranking Korean military officials are scheduled to be in
Washington next week for regular consultations, and U.S.
military officials said this issue was sure to come up.</p>
<p>Government officials also wouldn't comment on whether the
change in position is the result of a conflict between Mr.
Kim, the presidential adviser and a hard-liner in the ruling
Democratic Liberal Party, and Minister of National Defense
Lee Sang Hun over control of defense policy.</p>
<p>The fighter-plane controversy probably poses little threat
to McDonnell Douglas. The company declined to comment on what
a delay might mean. A spokesman said only, "We hope that the
two sides will be able to resolve any remaining
technology-transfer issues soon." Americans say there is
little chance that the Koreans would carry out their threat
to scuttle the deal.</p>
<p>Opposition to the pact has been strong in Korea even after
the two governments came to terms last summer. Nationalists
inside the government said the U.S. forced Korea to give up
too much, particularly because the deal calls for it to buy
off-the-shelf and because the U.S. need only buy back 30% of
the contract's total value in Korean goods under a system
known as "offset." It is common in military-equipment sales
for the offset to be closer to 100%.</p>
<p>The issue hasn't died down as it did in the U.S. Only a
few weeks ago the Dong-Ah Ilbo, an influential Seoul
newspaper, said, "Korea is placed at a disadvantage with the
terms of the contract when compared to other countries who
purchase expensive arms."</p>
<p>Said a U.S. military official, "It is an arrangement that
is just as good as anyone gets. They are getting nothing less
than the Spanish or the Australians {two other countries that
have licensed coproduction deals with the U.S.}."</p>
<p>Korea's aerospace industry is undeveloped, and government
officials made no secret that the fighter deal was designed
to help it develop a commercial aircraft industry. The key
reason McDonnell Douglas won the contract was that the
government thought the company had a better plan to develop
the Korean industry.</p>
