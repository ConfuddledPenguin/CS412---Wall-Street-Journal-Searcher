	<p class="article-leader">Hollis Caswell, the widely respected head of Unisys
Corp.'s mainframe business, resigned to run a start-up
business that makes electronics using superconductors.
   Mr. Caswell, 58 years old, said in an interview that his
decision didn't relate to the heavy losses that the computer
and defense-electronics company has posted over the past year
and a half. Still, executives who have worked with him said
his departure is a loss for Unisys.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"He was one of my bosses at IBM, and one of the best
bosses I've worked for," said Paul Stern, chief executive
officer of Northern Telecom Ltd. "He's a terrific guy, and I
don't say that lightly."</p>
<p>Mr. Caswell wins points inside Unisys for his work in
bringing to market the much-delayed replacements to the 1100
series of mainframes made by Sperry Corp., which merged with
Burroughs Corp. in 1986 to form Unisys. Although there was a
last-minute hiccup that delayed the midsized models by three
months, Unisys executives said the process went much more
smoothly after Mr. Caswell took over. Customers generally
compliment the machines -- even as some consider moving to
hardware for which there is more software available.</p>
<p>"There are some real nice things about the hardware,
things that IBM doesn't have," said James H. Johnson,
director of financial reporting and budgeting at Giant Eagle
Inc., a supermarket chain based in Pittsburgh. He added,
though, that "There aren't many {software} systems that run
on the Unisys hardware. That's one of the problems."</p>
<p>Mr. Caswell will become chief executive of Hypres Inc.,
Elmsford, N.Y., a closely held concern with about 40
employees and $5 million a year in revenue. He said the move
gives him a fresh challenge and returns him to an early
interest of his: He worked on superconductor research when he
joined International Business Machines Corp. in the late
1950s and later did extensive research on
superconductor-based devices known as Josephson junctions.
Mr. Caswell said he thinks Hypres has a good chance to get
its devices used in such equipment as telephone switches,
which may require the huge increases in speed that
superconductors can provide.</p>
<p>Unisys, which is based in Blue Bell, Pa., said that
responsibility for its mainframe operations will be shifted
to Cyril Yansouni, 47, who will also retain control of its
personal-computer and workstation businesses. A spokesman
said the company had been considering merging the two
operations, in any case. Unisys, like many computer
companies, is focusing primarily these days on making it
easier for all types of machines to communicate with one
another, and the company hopes the combination will
facilitate that.</p>
<p>Mr. Yansouni, who had been a senior vice president,
becomes one of two executive vice presidents.</p>
<p>Unisys also said that it consolidated some of its
marketing operations to improve the coordination among them.
Reto Braun, president of the Pacific Asia Americas division,
was also given responsibility for the general U.S. marketing
operation and one targeted at corporate customers. Mr. Braun,
48, also becomes an executive vice president; he, too, had
been a senior vice president.</p>
