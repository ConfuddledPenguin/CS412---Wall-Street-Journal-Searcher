	<p class="article-leader">Something strange is going on with travel prices this
summer: They're not going up.
   Travel companies normally boost their rates about this
time, priming for the annual rush of summer business. But so
far, most airlines, hotels and car rental companies are
barely touching prices. Some are even talking about lowering
them. "It's becoming a real smorgasbord for special pricing,"
says Albert Gomes, director of hospitality, travel and
tourism for Arthur D. Little Inc., a consulting firm.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The soft prices are coming even though travel is up quite
a bit since last year's slump. Airline traffic has risen 8%
this year and hotel occupancy rates are their highest in
several years. But despite the improved business, many travel
companies are still hurting; four of 10 hotel rooms go
vacant, and car rental companies are loaded with debt. In
this environment, most travel companies don't want to risk
price increases.</p>
<p>"People in the industry are afraid of running business
off," says Chris Browne, senior vice president of marketing
for Prime Franchise Systems Inc., franchiser for Ramada
Hotels and Inns, Howard Johnson and Roadway Inns. "I'd be
very surprised to see any aggressive pricing any time soon."</p>
<p>What's more, some travel companies say the recovery has
slowed in recent weeks, creating fears that consumer
confidence may be slipping. "You've got a suffering economy
and one of the first things people give up is travel," says
Paul Turk, an analyst with Avmark Inc., Arlington, Va.</p>
<p>To be sure, traveling won't be cheap, primarily because
airlines imposed a slew of beefy increases over the past two
years. Most travel experts figure that domestic air fares
will be about the same as last year's, with the cheapest
round-trip ticket from New York to Los Angeles costing about
$358 to $378.</p>
<p>But things could have been a lot worse, had the normal
seasonal rate increases gone through. United Airlines, which
already lowered some transcontinental fares 15% from May 1 to
June 11, says it's not planning any fare hikes after the
latest special ends. "It's going to be a stable situation,"
says a spokeswoman for the UAL Corp. unit.</p>
<p>Similarly, Delta Air Lines, AMR Corp.'s American Airlines,
and NWA Inc.'s Northwest Airlines say they have no fare
increases in the works, and America West Airlines officials
say its transcontinental fares may even drop. "The fare and
traffic levels are reasonable and we don't want to affect
that," says Marilyn Hoppe, the carrier's senior director of
pricing.</p>
<p>Lodging rates, which rose 3% to 4% this winter, shouldn't
go up any more in the next few months, predicts Smith Travel
Research in Hendersonville, Tenn. Ramada Inns and Howard
Johnson plan to raise prices only $2 to $5 a day. Radisson
Hotels International Inc. says it will offer 25% to 50%
discounts off weekend rates in the summer at all 150 domestic
properties.</p>
<p>Most car rental companies, meanwhile, plan to offer weekly
rates as low as $99 to $109 this summer, even in their
biggest three markets -- Florida, Hawaii and California. "You
may see some promotions go away, but you won't see any
big-time increases," says Robert Wilson, vice president of
marketing for Budget Rent a Car Corp.</p>
<p>Given the unsteady nature of the travel industry, where
sudden shifts in pricing are common, the fare outlook could
obviously change. But most travel experts are betting that
the good deals will last through the fall. That's because
many airlines, which set the tone for the rest of the travel
industry, are adding an unusually large number of new planes
to their fleets. Before the year is out, the industry will
take in 750 new planes, compared with 415 in 1989, according
to Avmark. All those extra planes will increase competition
and keep fares down, travel experts say.</p>
