	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- Capital flows from Japan to the U.S. have
slowed recently, Makoto Utsumi, Japan's vice minister for
international affairs at Japan's finance ministry, said.
   But Mr. Utsumi, in an interview, refused to speculate on
whether this week's record Treasury refunding of more than
$30 billion would be affected. Japan has been an important
investor in Treasury securities in recent years.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Speaking at the end of three days of international
meetings here, Mr. Utsumi expressed satisfaction with
Sunday's communique from the Group of Seven industrialized
nations. He stressed that the statement, released Sunday, is
more explicit about the need for a stronger yen than a
previous G-7 communique released in Paris a month ago.</p>
<p>"The current level of the yen is to a certain extent out
of line with fundamentals," said Mr. Utsumi, who would like
to see his country's currency strengthen.</p>
<p>The G-7 statement said "the present level {of the yen} may
have undesirable consequences for the global adjustment
process." There wasn't any mention of the present level in
the earlier communique released in Paris, Mr. Utsumi pointed
out. (The G-7 includes the finance ministers and central bank
presidents of the U.S., Japan, West Germany, France, Britain,
Italy and Canada.)</p>
