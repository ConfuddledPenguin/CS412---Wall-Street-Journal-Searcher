	<p class="article-leader">In the past year, voters in Phoenix have thumpingly turned
down tax measures for a baseball stadium and mass transit. So
what is the state legislature now mulling? Raising the sales
tax for a baseball stadium and mass transit.
   The civic establishment is eager to have a ballpark in
progress to tempt Major League Baseball to award the desert
metropolis one of the new franchises due for announcement
later this year. Republican State Rep. Chris Herstam's bill
would permit the Maricopa County supervisors to impose up to
a half-penny surcharge on each dollar of purchases to raise
enough to keep the athletes and fans in style.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Supervisor Jim Bruner, who's leading the push, emphasizes
that this plan differs from one rejected last fall at the
polls. This would have raised property taxes only in Phoenix
proper, while the whole area reaped the benefits. Mr. Bruner
says he senses a more positive attitude toward the countywide
sales tax. But under the Herstam bill, no public vote would
be required. So there would be no reality check of Mr.
Bruner's gauge, at least not until he and his four colleagues
came up for re-election in 1992, by which time the
supervisors may have collected the entire tax.</p>
<p>Arizona has long experience with the Cactus League in
spring training, so maybe it is ripe for the big time. But it
wasn't ready to pay the National Football League ticket
prices that the Phoenix Cardinals brought to town in 1988,
and many seats went unsold. (Owner Bill Bidwill has now cut
prices a second time.) And Phoenix last year already went on
the hook for $46 million to build an arena for the basketball
Suns, without a nod from voters.</p>
<p>Moreover, a general backlash is developing against public
giveaways to sports barons. Al Davis has alienated the whole
state of California dangling his football Raiders before
various communities. Residents of Seattle are bucking a new
arena that the Supersonics basketball team actually would
build for itself but only if tax funds are used to take the
existing playing facility out of commission as a competing
venue for other events.</p>
<p>The Arizona legislature's current special session to
balance the budget also could pave the way for a sales tax
boost for transit. Proponents are at pains to distinguish
this drive, too, from one the voters rejected in the spring.
This time, they say, the money would go mostly for buses and
not rail. Given the nature of public-transit failures in the
U.S. (the Buffalo fiasco being the most recent example),
that's probably a slight plus. And the expectation is that
voter approval would be required because it would be a longer
commitment than the stadium assessment and doesn't need to be
rushed to assure a group of team owners.</p>
<p>At a time when many state and local governments --
including those in Arizona and Phoenix -- are struggling to
balance their budgets, the discipline of public referendums
on major projects can be especially helpful. Although we have
detected a special-problem in recent years with the
business-labor-government "Arizocracy" centered in Phoenix,
the tendency of elites nationwide to revel in grand public
works requires monitoring as authorities run short of funds
to meet basic service commitments. Anybody is entitled to
pitch a pet project, but we're more comfortable when the
voters have a chance at bat.</p>
