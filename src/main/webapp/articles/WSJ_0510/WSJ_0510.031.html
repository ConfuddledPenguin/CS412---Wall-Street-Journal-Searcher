	<p class="article-leader">ORLANDO, Fla. -- Harcourt Brace Jovanovich Inc. said it
terminated discussions about possible sales of some of its
assets and public debt.
   The publishing and insurance concern, struggling under
debt from a highly leveraged takeover escape in 1987,
confirmed April 25 that it was holding the talks with another
company, but declined to elaborate. A Harcourt director,
however, former Sen. Eugene McCarthy, said the talks involved
Toronto-based Thomson Corp.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Thomson officials couldn't be reached for comment on the
termination of talks. Harcourt made the announcement after
the markets closed.</p>
<p>"I didn't give a high probability to anything happening
with Thomson anyway," said Andrew Herenstein, an analyst with
Delaware Bay Co., a New York-based investment research firm.
Mr. Herenstein, who anticipates a slight drop in the value of
Harcourt Brace Jovanovich stock today in wake of the
announcement, said the company must still complete some kind
of restructuring.</p>
<p>Roger Gordon, an analyst with Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette
Securities Corp. in New York, said Harcourt isn't under any
pressure to complete a restructuring in the immediate future.</p>
<p>"They can move with deliberate speed," he said, "because
they're not facing an immediate cash crunch and won't be
confronting large cash demands for another three years" when
cash payments on subordinated debt issues are set to begin.</p>
