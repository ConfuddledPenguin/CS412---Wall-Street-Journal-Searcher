	<p class="article-leader">WOLFSBURG, West Germany -- Volkswagen AG said
first-quarter group net income rose 5.5%, but weakness in
South American operations is leading Europe's largest
automobile manufacturer to be cautious about forecasts that
it will be able to repeat last year's record earnings.
   Group net for the quarter was 191 million marks ($115.2
million), compared with from 181 million marks a year
earlier. Group sales rose 6.9% to 17.23 billion marks ($10.4
billion).</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Group net for 1989 soared 33% to 1.04 billion marks from
780 million marks in 1988, the company's third-consecutive
record result. Group per-share earnings, adjusted for
extraordinary items, rose to 61 marks from 46 marks a year
earlier.</p>
<p>Volkswagen Chairman Carl H. Hahn said it was too early to
forecast a fourth-consecutive year of record profit. Although
unit sales rose 2% to slightly more than one million in the
first four months of 1990, unit sales in the South American
Autolatina group fell 26% to 65,300 because of austerity
measures instituted by Brazil's government.</p>
<p>Mr. Hahn said sales have recovered "surprisingly" strongly
in Brazil in recent weeks, but in Argentina, where Autolatina
is jointly based, the company "expects further negative
developments."</p>
<p>Mr. Hahn said Volkswagen is looking at East Germany and
all of East Europe "all the way up to and into the Soviet
Union" as a market as well as a possible production site. He
said talks about joint ventures and other cooperation
agreements are being conducted with auto makers in
Czechoslovakia, Bulgaria and in Hungary. No details were
provided.</p>
<p>Volkswagen plans to invest five billion marks in East
Germany during the next four years and has signed exclusive
marketing contracts with 555 East German car dealers to sell
cars produced by its joint venture with VEB IFA Kombinat
Personenkraftwagen. The joint venture will eventually produce
Volkswagen's Golf and Polo models, phasing out existing
production of IFA's antiquated Trabant.</p>
<p>While unit sales in West Germany edged up 1.1% to 295,000
during the first four months of 1990, Mr. Hahn pointed to a
solid 5.5% increase to 485,000 units sold in other European
countries and a 4.2% boost in unit sales in North America.</p>
<p>Unit sales of its Audi luxury car jumped 14% in the U.S.
during the first four months. Sales of its transporter van
gained 26%. Total unit sales in the U.S. were at last year's
levels, Mr. Hahn said.</p>
<p>Analysts said the results were in line with expectations,
but said the uncertainty surrounding the weakness in South
America makes full-year forecasts difficult.</p>
