	<p class="article-leader">Great American Communications Co. is quietly shopping
around some of its radio properties.
   The move, by the Cincinnati company run by financier Carl
H. Lindner, underscores the pressure for cash facing the
highly leveraged company. Great American, which purchased
Taft Broadcasting Co. in October 1987 for about $1.5 billion,
had a $115.6 million loss in 1989 on revenue of $300.6
million.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Great American's long-term debt as of Dec. 31 totaled
$1.19 billion. In October, the company will have to pay $165
million as its first principal payments on that debt.
According to several individuals in the radio industry, Great
American would like to raise about $150 million in the sale
of the radio stations.</p>
<p>The company owns 11 FM stations, six AM stations and five
network-affiliated TV stations. None of the television
stations are for sale. It also has a controlling interest in
Spelling Entertainment Inc., which produced such TV shows as
"The Love Boat" and "Dynasty," and Hanna-Barbera Productions
Inc., the producers of such animated shows as "The
Flintstones" and "The Jetsons."</p>
<p>Carl J. Wagner, president of Great American Broadcasting
Co., a unit of Great American, couldn't be reached to
comment. However, several people close to the process said
Great American is interested in selling stations in Atlanta,
Kansas City, Mo., Columbus, Ohio, and Indianapolis. One
person with knowledge of the situation said that New York
radio broker Gary Stevens is handling the bidding for the
radio stations.</p>
<p>Mr. Stevens declined to comment.</p>
<p>"Great American will sell some media properties," said one
person. "Ultimately, it may not be the radio stations, but
something will go."</p>
<p>Great American is asking from $50 million to $60 million
for its Atlanta FM station, $50 million for the Indianapolis
AM-FM properties, from $25 million to $30 million for
Columbus AM-FM stations, and about $30 million for the Kansas
City AM-FM properties.</p>
<p>One person close to the process said Great American "is
pretty firm on these prices at this point. They're
independent thinkers and if they don't get the price they
want, they won't sell."</p>
<p>There are other options to raise cash.</p>
<p>In October, Spelling Entertainment put itself on the block
six months after control of the company went from founder
Aaron Spelling to Mr. Lindner. Spelling Entertainment
retained Merrill Lynch & Co.'s Capital Markets unit and
Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. to handle the possible sale.</p>
<p>To date, Spelling Entertainment hasn't been sold. And it
isn't clear what price Spelling Entertainment could fetch.</p>
<p>Spelling Entertainment has a library of one-hour
prime-time series, such as "Charlie's Angels" and "Hotel."
Such shows have recently not sold well in syndication, the
traditionally lucrative marketplace where shows are sold to
individual stations. Half-hour situation comedies now are the
hot properties in syndication sales to local stations.</p>
<p>In over-the-counter trading yesterday, Great American rose
37.5 cents to close at $6.625.</p>
