	<p class="article-leader">Interco Inc. said it won't pay interest due June 15 on its
bonds, proposing instead that bondholders accept a debt
restructuring of nearly $900 million.
   St. Louis-based Interco's finances have deteriorated
steadily since the furniture and shoe company carried out a
leveraged recapitalization in late 1988. At that time,
Interco borrowed about $2 billion to fight off a corporate
raider. Since then, Interco has posted a series of operating
losses and has failed to meet its price targets for selling
assets.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Interco's restructuring plan isn't likely to appeal to
bondholders. It offers little in the way of new
interest-paying bonds, and relies heavily on issuing more
Interco common stock, which closed yesterday in composite New
York Stock Exchange trading at 62.5 cents a share, unchanged.</p>
<p>In fact, analysts regard the Interco plan as just the
first step in what may be a long-running series of
negotiations with bondholders. "The first restructuring plan
never goes through, and the companies know that," said Andrew
J. Herenstein, an analyst at Delaware Bay Co., a securities
concern specializing in distressed bonds. In recent months,
militant bondholders have frequently won concessions from
companies in financial straits.</p>
<p>In announcing yesterday that it couldn't pay interest on
its bonds, Interco effectively conceded that its 1988
leveraged recapitalization hadn't worked. When the
recapitalization was devised by Interco's Wall Street
advisers, Wasserstein Perella & Co., it was valued at $76 for
each Interco share. But most of the new securities issued in
the Interco recapitalization have sunk drastically in value.
Traders estimated yesterday that the Wasserstein Perella
recapitalization package ultimately proved to be worth only
about $42 a share.</p>
<p>For the past year, Interco management has avoided
criticizing Wasserstein Perella by name. But in yesterday's
announcement of the restructuring plan, Interco hinted at
reservations about the high-debt strategy that it chose in
1988. The restructuring plan, Interco said, is designed to
relieve "the problems resulting from our over-leveraged
capital structure."</p>
<p>The restructuring plan begins with about $400 million of
13 3/4% senior subordinated debentures due 2000. These bonds
have recently been trading at about 27 cents on the dollar.
Holders of those bonds would receive, in exchange for each
$1,000 principal amount of such debt, 70 shares of Interco
common stock and $900 principal amount of a new issue of 6%
accrual convertible debentures, which pay accrued interest at
maturity. The new 6% debentures are convertible into 504
shares of Interco common; additional terms weren't disclosed.</p>
<p>The Interco restructuring plan doesn't offer any new debt
for holders of more than $450 million of subordinated bonds.
These bonds have recently been trading at just five cents on
the dollar, reflecting the bond market's pessimism about
Interco's condition. In the restructuring plan, holders of
these subordinated discount debentures due 2003, and 14 1/2%
junior pay-in-kind subordinated debentures, also due 2003,
would exchange each $1,000 principal amount of such
debentures for 150 and 130 shares of Interco common,
respectively.</p>
<p>Interco also said it will ask shareholders to approve the
reclassification of each share of the company's existing
Series D $7.75 cumulative convertible preferred stock into
100 shares of Interco common, and its Series E preferred
stock into 8 shares of Interco common.</p>
<p>Interco makes Converse sneakers and operates Florsheim
shoe stores; it also owns the Lane and Broyhill furniture
companies.</p>
<p>The restructuring plan is conditioned, among other things
on acceptance of the offers by at least 90% of each of the
debenture groups. Interco said it will file a registration
statement covering its exchange offers with the Securities
and Exchange Commission in the next "one to two weeks."</p>
