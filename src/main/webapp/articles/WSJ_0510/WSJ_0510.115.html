	<p class="article-leader">Moody's Investors Service Inc. said it downgraded its
ratings on $525 million of Grumman Corp.'s senior and
subordinated debt and preferred stock.
   The rating of Grumman's senior and subordinated debt fell
to Baa-3 from Baa-2 and to Ba-2 from Baa-3, respectively. The
rating of its preferred stock dropped to Ba-2 from Baa-3.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Moody's said it lowered the ratings because it expected
unfavorable conditions in the defense industry to continue to
pressure the Bethpage, N.Y., military contractor's cash flow
for servicing debt.</p>
<p>Grumman declined to comment.</p>
