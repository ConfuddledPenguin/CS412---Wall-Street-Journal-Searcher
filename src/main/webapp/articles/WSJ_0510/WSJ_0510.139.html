	<p class="article-leader">Modesty in foreign policy was once greatly prized. The
French statesman Talleyrand's legendary advice to young
diplomats was, "Above all, not too much zeal." In his classic
primer, "Diplomacy," Sir Harold Nicolson cautions the ideal
diplomat against "vanity {because it prefers} a brilliant but
undesirable triumph to some unostentatious but more prudent
compromise."
   Richard Haass fears that this lesson has been forgotten
particularly by American diplomats who live in a
"getting-to-yes" culture that believes every problem has a
solution. In his short study, "Conflicts Unending: The United
States and Regional Disputes" (Yale University Press, 172
pages, $22.50), he argues that many international conflicts
can only be managed, not eliminated, and that imaginative
diplomacy can be futile, even dangerous. "Iatrogenic, or
treatment induced, illness has analogies outside the world of
medicine."</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>This advice sounds suspiciously like a rationalization for
George Bush's foreign policy. Not suprisingly, Mr. Haass, who
taught at Harvard until 1989, is now the president's top aide
on the Middle East and South Asia. In this book, he proposes
adding the notion of "ripeness" to the language of diplomacy.
Ripeness is "the existence of the prerequisites for
diplomatic progress." If the U.S. pushes for far-reaching
"solutions" in the absence of these prerequisites, not only
is failure likely, but the U.S. will dash raised
expectations, lose credibility and generally heighten
tensions.</p>
<p>For example, he believes that Alexander Haig's frantic
shuttle diplomacy at the start of the Falkland Islands crisis
may have backfired by convincing the Argentine generals that
America's equivocations would dissuade Britain from going to
war. When that didn't happen, the generals felt betrayed by
Mr. Haig. The British, meanwhile, were annoyed by Mr. Haig's
waffling. The author suggests that if the U.S. had backed
Britain firmly from the start of the crisis, the Argentines
might have been deterred from war.</p>
<p>If a situation is ripe, on the other hand, negotiations
can help. Mr. Haass argues that the Camp David peace accords
between Israel and Egypt resulted at least as much from a
ripe situation as from brilliant (American) negotiations.
Egypt had gained enough prestige from the Yom Kippur War to
allow it to negotiate from strength, and Menachem Begin was
the only Israeli leader who could give back the Sinai without
being accused of weakening the country. Similarly, the
accords on Rhodesia, the Beagle Channel dispute, and the
Iran-Iraq War were all possible only because of their
background circumstances.</p>
<p>What exactly is ripeness? First, writes Mr. Haass, the two
opposing parties must want an agreement. Second both parties
must be able to carry through (with domestic support) on
their promises. Third, there must be a face-saving rationale
for both parties to claim that they made a good deal. And
last, there must be a negotiating process that both parties
accept.</p>
<p>This definition, however, veers toward tautology.
Ripeness, as presented by Mr. Haass, allows negotiations to
prosper. But ripeness is also defined as the situation when
both parties want to negotiate, are able to negotiate, and
agree on how to negotiate. Surely it is hardly surprising
that negotiations prosper in these conditions]</p>
<p>The trick, then, is to know when ripeness exists, not in
hindsight but at the moment. Mr. Haass's discussion of South
Africa illustrates this problem. He makes a perfectly
plausible case that the country is "far from ripe {because
white South Africans} have yet to conclude that the costs of
sustaining apartheid are unbearable." But if President F.W.
de Klerk's reforms, proposed after this book was published,
are implemented, we would have to say, in retrospect, that
suddenly in 1990, white South Africans concluded that
apartheid was unbearable, thus ripening the situation.</p>
<p>Mr. Haass spends most of the book expertly summarizing
five regional disputes in the Middle East; Cyprus; India and
Pakistan; South Africa; and Northern Ireland. In each case,
he argues that the conditions for ripeness are far from
present and that the U.S. shouldn't put forward peace plans
because they won't work. Instead, he suggests that Washington
strive for such modest but attainable goals as maintaining
credibility with the major parties in the dispute and
preventing accidents and miscalculations. According to his
scenario, an elaborate peace plan for the Middle East would
only backfire, making war even more likely. Mr. Haass fails
to identify situations that are ripe or to suggest any
imaginative alternative.</p>
<p>It is ironic that a book preaching against overambition
should have a needlessly complicated theoretical
architecture. "Ripeness" is simply a fancy way of saying,
"the time must be right for negotiations." How does one tell
when the time is right? Well, that's what diplomats are for.
They study a situation and make a judgment. No magic formula
can replace political analysis. In fact, Mr. Haass is very
good at this kind of analysis. What he does do in this
alternately irritating and interesting book is to describe
the conflicts with admirable level-headedness and
refreshingly clear prose. And one cannot argue with his
central message -- that American diplomats should spend less
time thinking up clever compromise formulas and more time
moving the opposing parties toward general agreement.
Otherwise, Winston Churchill to the contrary, "jaw-jaw" can
lead to "war-war."</p>
