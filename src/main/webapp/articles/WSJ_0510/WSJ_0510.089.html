	<p class="article-leader">LOS ANGELES -- Mattel Inc. announced its first quarterly
dividend in seven years and said it plans to repay $75
million in senior subordinated extendible notes. The move
reflects improved earnings during the past several quarters.
   The toy maker also announced at its annual meeting a
licensing agreement with Twentieth Century Fox Licensing &
Merchandising to produce toys and related products based on
the hit television cartoon series "The Simpsons." Twentieth
Century Fox is a News Corp. unit.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The dividend of three cents for each share of common stock
is payable July 2 to stock of record June 15. Mattel's last
common stock dividend was paid in June 1983, the year the
company's plunge into electronic toys and other strategies
resulted in a $394 million loss. That prompted a major
restructuring and eventually a change in senior management.</p>
<p>John W. Amerman, Mattel's chairman and chief executive
officer, said the board will review its dividend policy each
quarter, but he said it hadn't determined a set amount to be
paid.</p>
<p>Mattel won't extend $75 million of 10 7/8% senior
subordinated extendible notes, and it plans to repay the
notes on the July 15 due date. The board also authorized the
purchase of as much as 500,000 of the company's 50.5 million
common shares during the next year on the open market to fund
Mattel's stock-option plan.</p>
<p>Mattel's stock climbed 50 cents on the news, closing at
$24 a share in New York Stock Exchange composite trading.</p>
<p>In an interview, Mr. Amerman said he is comfortable with
analysts' per-share earnings estimates of $2 to $2.10 for
1990.</p>
<p>In 1989, Mattel earned $68.7 million, or $1.38 a share, on
sales of $1.2 billion.</p>
<p>The world-wide licensing pact with Twentieth Century Fox
will feature the offbeat members of the Simpson family,
especially the spiky-haired son, Bart. The line will include
action figures, vehicles and play sets, as well as dolls,
preschool products and child-sized accessories.</p>
<p>The products will be rolled out this fall with the new
episodes of "The Simpsons," and new products will be
introduced for the spring 1991 season. Al Ovadia, Twentieth
Century Fox's vice president, licensing, said the company has
signed more than 100 licensing agreements on "The Simpsons,"
ranging from apparel, school supplies and games, to
skateboards and computer games.</p>
<p>Mr. Amerman estimated that the licensing agreement could
produce more than $20 million in sales by year end, but he
said he couldn't predict the value of the agreement over the
long run.</p>
<p>Entertainment-related character tie-ins can be fraught
with problems, as it is extremely difficult to gauge the
public appetite for movies, TV shows and cartoons.</p>
<p>Mattel passed up the licensing for "Star Wars" characters
in the mid-1970s, and that line proved to be one of the most
lucrative ever. Mattel also passed on licensing pacts for a
current hit movie "Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles." Conversely,
others in the toy industry have bombed when characters
suddenly fell out of favor.</p>
<p>More recently, though, Mattel has launched some successful
licensed product lines. Its Disney preschool and infant toys
racked up $135 million in sales last year. For 1990, Mattel
has introduced an infant toy using Muppet's characters.</p>
<p>Despite the unpredictability of such a venture, most
toy-industry analysts say the Simpsons tie-in could be a
profitable sideline for Mattel.</p>
<p>"If you do it as an adjunct part of your business and not
the mainstream, and if you manage your products carefully,
you'll be in good shape," said Thomas Kully, an analyst with
William Blair & Co. in Chicago. But Mr. Kully and other
observers did voice some uncertainty over how much appeal
"The Simpsons" has among younger viewers. "Is it really a
kids' property?" Mr. Kully asked.</p>
<p>Twentieth Century Fox said Simpson-licensed clothing and
other merchandise has been selling briskly through special
departments in 1,200 J.C. Penney Co. department stores, and
consumer demand should remain steady as licensees such as
Mattel introduce fresh products during the fall television
season.</p>
