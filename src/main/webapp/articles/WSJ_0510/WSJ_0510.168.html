	<p class="article-leader">FORT WORTH, Texas -- Pengo Industries Inc. said it emerged
from Chapter 11 bankruptcy-law proceedings in a
reorganization that gave an affiliate of R.D. Smith & Co.,
New York, a 47% stake in the restructured company.
   Senior secured creditors, who held about $48 million of
secured debt, received 46% of the company's newly issued
common and $10.2 million in cash, Pengo said. Holders of
Pengo's senior and junior convertible preferred stock
received 3.5% and 0.2%, respectively, of the new common while
public holders of Pengo's old common, excluding senior
secured lenders, received 2.3%. Pengo management will receive
a 1% stake.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The Smith affiliate, PIAC Inc., provided Pengo with $7
million in new equity, capital and financing, Pengo said.
Another Smith affiliate, GNPW L.P., was given the capital
stock of several Pengo subsidiaries, including GOEX Inc.,
Townsend Enterprises Inc. and Petro Rubber Products Inc. In
return, GOEX paid Pengo $620,000 and retired $10 million,
principal amount, of secured Pengo term notes it had bought
from senior creditors.</p>
<p>Unsecured creditors received $1 million cash and a $2
million subordinated debenture in return for about $10
million of unsecured debt, the company said.</p>
<p>Pengo said its former board was replaced by Arthur J.
Pasmas and Lewis E. Ball II of Houston, Jeffrey A. Smith of
New York, William J. Conway of Baton Rouge, La., and Charles
Merritt of Dallas.</p>
<p>The company said its principal business will be its wholly
owned subsidiary, Pengo Corp., a Union City, Calif., maker
and distributor of earth engaging augers and teeth. It said
the business is its most profitable, posting net income of
$2.3 million on sales of about $9.6 million in the fiscal
year ended Sept. 30, 1989.</p>
