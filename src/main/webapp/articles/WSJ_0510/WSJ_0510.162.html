	<p class="article-leader">MIAMI -- Eastern Airlines said it will redeem about 47,000
tickets outstanding since its Chapter 11 filing more than a
year ago.
   Under the plan, which has received bankruptcy-court
approval, ticket holders have several options. They can
exchange tickets for travel vouchers worth 135% of the
original unused fare. Or they also can receive full face
value of the ticket with either a first class upgrade or a
companion ticket for half the regular fare.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The program applies to travelers who bought tickets before
March 9, 1989, when Eastern filed for Chapter 11 protection,
and who didn't turn in their tickets to a redemption program
last year. Eastern said ticket holders will receive letters
about the program over the next several weeks.</p>
<p>Eastern, a unit of Houston-based Texas Air Corp., has been
placed under the control of a trustee by the bankruptcy
court.</p>
