	<p class="article-leader">Randall K. Filer gave a good analysis of why policy makers
are bombarded with conflicting assessments of the homeless
problem ("What We Really Know About the Homeless," editorial
page, April 10). The confusion may lie more in how "homeless"
is defined in the various studies, rather than the differing
estimates and explanations derived.
   Federal statutes define homeless to mean "lower-income
families and individuals, elderly families and individuals,
and handicapped families and individuals that lack permanent
housing, reside in grossly inadequate or grossly substandard
accommodations, or whose primary residence is in institutions
of any type without a fixed and permanent place to live upon
discharge."</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Other definitions include those who sleep in shelters,
parks, abandoned buildings, and rented hotel and motel rooms
paid for by public or private agencies; individuals
doubled-up with friends and relatives, or living in
short-term rental housing; those in institutional care with
no permanent address; or those considered "at risk" of
becoming homeless.</p>
<p>This diversity leads to contradictory estimates. For
example, the U.S. Conference of Mayors estimates that as much
as 50% of the homeless population is made up of families. The
Campaign to End Hunger and Homelessness indicates that
roughly two-thirds of the homeless are single men. The
Friends Committee on National Legislation claims that nearly
30% of all homeless people are employed. The National Academy
of Sciences' Institute of Medicine estimates that there are
at least 100,000 homeless children on any given night. And
the National Coalition for the Homeless claims that 60% of
the homeless population consists of women and children.</p>
<p>We may never be able to deal with the homeless problem
until there is a consensus on what it means to be "homeless."</p>

<p>Mr. Filer talks about "mental health," drug and alcohol
problems, and criminal records being more common among
low-income people and the homeless. He is, of course, really
talking about mental illness. The substitution for mental
health when we mean mental illness comes from our strong
tendency to accentuate the positive. But such desire is
misplaced when it lets us ignore the fact of serious mental
illness.</p>
<p>Once we acknowledge that mental illness does not go away
by focusing on mental health, but that it does respond to
treatment, we will seek asylum for those who need it, and cut
down the homeless and the prison populations by that much.</p>

<p>The housing hurdle for the homeless has been raised
another notch, this time by Mr. Filer, who takes the not
unusual academician's approach to a problem -- study it to
death before taking any action. No matter that Mr. Filer
admits, "Issues of causality are complicated by the fact that
many factors are interrelated." According to Mr. Filer's
logic, we should not attempt to save a drowning man, but
rather reflect on how he came to be in his predicament.</p>
<p>There are loads of available statistics on the homeless,
and perhaps Mr. Filer's desire is a $1 million government
grant to unearth them. Let me save Uncle Sam some money.</p>
<p>General Assistance in the Minneapolis-St. Paul area
provides $203 a month for single people who have little or no
income and meet eligibility standards. Food stamps, county
health-care assistance and clinics are also available. But
affordable housing is not. The Metropolitan Apartment Guide
figures state that a studio apartment in North St. Paul rents
for $292 a month, a one-bedroom unit for $377. In the
suburbs, the rents are $505 and $571 respectively.</p>
<p>One doesn't need a Ph.D. to get the message -- a homeless
person can't afford housing here or in most places in the
country. The answer is money or -- more precisely --
lower-cost housing for the poor.</p>
<p>It doesn't matter whether the homeless number 350,000 or
three million. Even 350,000 is an intolerable number and a
national disgrace in a country so blessed with abundance.</p>

<p>Mr. Filer attributed great significance and mystery to
just another buzzword of these weird times in America. The
words "homeless" and "homelessness" occurred 46 times. Left
out entirely were the terms Foodless, Shoeless, Clothesless,
Transportationless and even Dollarless. Assetlessness would
have a nice buzz. But how about using the term "Poverty"?
Buzzwords are harmful; they are used, with enormous help from
the media, to empower advocacies and government bureaus. As
almost everyone knows, problems are thereby created, and
seldom solved. An afterthought: Someone should address the
topic, "Poverty Problems Much Worse Elsewhere Than in the
U.S. -- Why?" There should be thoughtful discussion on what
we're doing right. That might lead to some useful
non-programs that would surely help the impoverished.</p>
