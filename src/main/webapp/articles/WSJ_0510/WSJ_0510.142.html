	<p class="article-leader">Investor Norman Elowitz said he may make a new offer to
acquire Ultimate Corp., an East Hanover, N.J.,
computer-products concern.
   In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission,
Mr. Elowitz, chairman of Honey Fashions Ltd., also said he
raised his stake in Ultimate to 7.2%, or 686,500 shares, from
6.2%. Mr. Elowitz said he increased his stake to strengthen
his position at the company.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>In March, Ultimate rejected Mr. Elowitz's $10-a-share
offer, valued at $95 million. It said it doubted Mr.
Elowitz's ability to finance a takeover.</p>
<p>Michael O'Donnell, Ultimate's chairman, said: "Nothing has
changed from the company's perspective. But I think the board
must fulfill its fiduciary responsibility, and if that means
looking at a new offer, it will."</p>
<p>In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday,
Ultimate closed at $6 a share, down 12.5 cents.</p>
