	<p class="article-leader">TORONTO -- Asea Brown Boveri Inc. unveiled a 2.9 billion
Canadian dollar (US$2.5 billion) plan to build a high-speed
train link between Quebec City and Windsor, Ontario, that
rivals a more expensive plan previously proposed by
Bombardier Inc.
   Peter Janson, president and chief executive officer of
ABB, said an initial 540-kilometer (338-mile) section of the
line could be built between Montreal and Toronto for C$1.8
billion in about three years. The total line, comprising
1,160 kilometers, would take about seven years to construct,
he said. Montreal-based ABB is a wholly owned unit of Swiss
engineering concern Asea Brown Boveri Group.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Mr. Janson spoke at a news conference here to announce the
results of a preliminary study of the high-speed train plan.
He expects a full feasibility study to be completed by the
end of the year. The company today will present its findings
to an Ontario-Quebec task force that has been examining
options for passenger transportation in the Quebec
City-Windsor corridor.</p>
<p>In February, Bombardier, an aerospace and transporation
concern based in Montreal, offered its plan for a high-speed
rail link in the Quebec City-Windsor corridor at an estimated
cost of C$5.3 billion. The plan, which would use the French
TGV (very fast train) technology, would require about C$1.6
billion in government backing.</p>
<p>But Mr. Janson said the ABB plan could be funded mostly
with private money. "We believe . . . the project can be done
with minimal or no government financing," he said.</p>
<p>The ABB train, dubbed the Sprintor, would employ the
company's X2 rail technology currently in use in Sweden. This
enables electrically powered high-speed trains, traveling at
up to 250 kilometers (156 miles) per hour, to use existing
tracks without any alterations the banking of track curves.
By contrast, the Bombardier plan would require the laying of
new tracks along existing rights-of-way.</p>
<p>Both ABB and Bombardier estimate their high-speed trains
would cut travel time between Montreal and Toronto to about
two hours and 45 minutes from about five hours currently.</p>
<p>A Bombardier spokesman declined to comment on the ABB
plan.</p>
