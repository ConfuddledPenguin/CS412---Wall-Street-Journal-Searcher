	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- House-Senate negotiations on a $3.3 billion
fiscal 1990 spending bill broke off as quickly as they began,
leaving an anxious State Department scrambling to expedite
its three-month-old request for new aid to Panama and
Nicaragua.
   The standoff is owed more to disputes over domestic
appropriations than foreign assistance, but the delay is a
further frustration for the State Department, which must
still contend with separate demands that conditions be
imposed on military aid to El Salvador.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Liberal Democrats have maneuvered to join all of the
Central American issues in the House, where Rules Committee
Chairman Joseph Moakley is positioned to delay the $720
million for Panama and Nicaragua until some resolution is
reached on El Salvador. Secretary of State James Baker
telephoned the Massachusetts Democrat yesterday in an effort
to put off the fight. But Democrats have been frustrated, in
turn, by what they see as the administration's failure to
come forward earlier and negotiate.</p>
<p>"I like Baker, and I think he's on the level. But he's a
one-man show," said Mr. Moakley. "I told him we know you're
acting in good faith, but I hear your nouns and your verbs,
but I don't hear numbers."</p>
<p>Democrats have proposed withholding as much as 50% of U.S.
military aid to El Salvador in fiscal 1990 and 1991. But Mr.
Moakley said Mr. Baker indicated he wanted to leave this
year's money unencumbered and hold back only 25% of whatever
is approved in the fiscal year beginning Oct. 1. Bernard
Aronson, assistant secretary of state for inter-American
affairs, is slated to meet with House Democrats today. And
though there is hope of a settlement, most indications are
that the administration will have to make further
concessions.</p>
<p>Though the foreign-aid package remains the heart of the
bill for the White House, the underlying measure has grown
steadily as it has moved through Congress. The $3.3 billion
total approved by the Senate is more than $700 million above
comparable accounts in the House version. House
Appropriations Committee Chairman Jamie Whitten, a past
master of pork-barrel politics, is clearly relishing his new
position as the austere budgeteer. The Mississippi Democrat
used yesterday's meeting to lecture errant senators on
attaching scores of amendments he judged neither "dire" nor
an "emergency."</p>
<p>The Senate bill goes further as well in rearranging
Pentagon expenditures. Altogether $2.86 billion would be cut
from defense appropriations, both to offset domestic spending
and to allow money to be shifted to faster-spending military
personnel accounts. The end result, after the $1.5 billion
across-the-board Gramm-Rudman cut last winter, would reduce
Pentagon appropriations to about $281.5 billion or below
fiscal 1989's level of $282.2 billion.</p>
<p>Apart from these fiscal issues, the bill has become
entangled in a long-running dispute over federal restrictions
on the District of Columbia's use of its local funds to
finance abortions for poor women. President Bush twice vetoed
attempts last year to modify the current law. And when Senate
liberals renewed the challenge this spring, conservatives
countered with an amendment that would at the same time
impose the death penalty in drug-related murders.</p>
<p>Abortion-rights advocates have said they will continue to
fight for their provision. But Washington Mayor Marion Barry
Jr. this week wrote the chairman of the Senate Appropriations
subcommittee overseeing the city's budget asking that the
language be withdrawn. "The price for enhancing home rule on
the issue of locally funded abortions -- acceptance of the
death penalty in the District -- is too great to endorse,"
Mr. Barry wrote.</p>
