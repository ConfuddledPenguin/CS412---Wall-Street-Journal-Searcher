	<p class="article-leader">Tokyo's Nikkei Index finished slightly lower on
profit-taking, ending the five-day, 1500-point rally.
   In London, shares ended broadly lower after extremely
lackluster dealings, action that largely signaled a
consolidation following modest day-earlier gains.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Tokyo's Nikkei Index of 225 issues fell 24.97 points to
30945.61. The index gained 14.31 points Tuesday.</p>
<p>But the Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed in
the first section, which gained 7.11 points Tuesday,
sustained the rally and added 5.19 points, or 0.23%, to
2308.79. The Topix has posted consecutive gains since April
26, adding 108.69 points, or 4.9%, since that time.</p>
<p>In Tokyo Thursday, the Nikkei index rose 296.34 points to
close the morning session at 31241.95.</p>
<p>Wednesday's volume on the first section was estimated at
700 million shares, off from 746 million shares Tuesday.</p>
<p>Winning issues outnumbered losers 572 to 409, while 139
issues were unchanged. Traders said the tally reflects gains
on the broad-based Topix, noting that declines on the Nikkei
Index were likely on more expensive issues.</p>
<p>The second section index surged 46.02 points, or 1.25%, to
3717.90. The gain marks the seventh consecutive advance for
the minor index. Volume was estimated at 18 million shares,
up from 14 million shares.</p>
<p>Early morning bargain-hunting couldn't outpace
professional selling, which began midmorning and continued
throughout the day, and, after a softer morning close, prices
drifted in the afternoon, observers said.</p>
<p>A vice president of equity research at a U.S. investment
bank compared the market's major movements with acts in a
theater play, with rumors and various corporate news fillers
being equivalent to small, short stories told to keep the
audience entertained between acts.</p>
<p>In short, he said the market will look for rumors and
corporate news while it's between acts, as the market seeks
to recover from its retracement since the beginning of the
year. However, not being prepared to make a full-scale
rebound, the market is trending upward, helped by favorable
technical price patterns and improved fundamentals.</p>
<p>The key for a stock rally remains in brokers' abilities to
attract institutional investors, said Christopher Leighton,
manager of international equity sales at Schroder Securities
(Japan) Ltd. He added that institutional and individual
investors have been reluctant to participate mainly because
they're unsure where to put their money for sustained
strength.</p>
<p>Buying trends are indicating a shortterm marketplace,
observers said, with interest focused mostly on domestics.
"But domestic issues by no means provide a clear indication
of where to invest," Mr. Leighton said, as they can quite
easily and quickly reverse gains.</p>
<p>In addition, observers noted that arbitrage activity may
be hindering a fullscale recovery.</p>
<p>"Elements of arbitrage-related selling" were evident
yesterday, Mr. Leighton said, with arbitragers buying
stock-index futures and selling the cash indexes.</p>
<p>Although the market was in a bullish mood, he noted the
disparity between arbitragers' ability to sway the indexes
and brokers' ability to convince customers to participate.</p>
<p>Market talk yesterday included a story that Nippon Zeon
has developed the world's smallest pacemaker, according to
Kevin Haag, a dealer in overseas operations at Nomura
Securities Co. The stock ended at its stop-high.</p>
<p>Industrial machinery stocks were helped by a story in a
leading Japanese economic daily regarding fiber cables
projects, while some pharmaceuticals and chemicals were
lifted on news that a Waseda University team has synthesized
red blood cells.</p>
<p>Among industrial machinery stocks, Daikin Industries added
80 yen to Y1870 (51 cents to $11.86), Ebara rose 70 yen to
1880 yen and Kubota rose 70 yen to 1100 yen.</p>
<p>Dainippon Pharmaceutical soared 270 yen to 2880 yen,
Mochida rose 130 yen to 3910 yen and Ono rose 150 yen to 6270
yen.</p>
<p>Nippon Oil & Fat rose 109 yen to 1100 yen.</p>
<p>London's Financial Times Stock Exchange 100 share index
fell 19.3 points to 2162.7, a touch above the intraday low of
2160.6 and substantially lower than the day's high of 2179.7,
just after the start of official trading.</p>
<p>The Financial Times 30-share index was down 14.5 points at
1695.6. Volume was a 425.8 million shares, modestly better
than 309.0 million a day earlier.</p>
<p>The market's "just getting a touch tired," said a trader
with a large U.K. brokerage firm, particularly after posting
moderate gains since late last week.</p>
<p>Wariness on the part of investors ahead of tomorrow's
scheduled disclosure of U.K. retail price index figures for
April helped pressure the market a bit, dealers said.</p>
<p>Traders added that investors were also waiting to see what
effect the U.S. Treasury's $30.5 billion quarterly refunding
was having on Wall Street.</p>
<p>A slew of corporate results had diverse effects on
individual share prices.</p>
<p>Construction and property concern Trafalgar House fell 10
pence to 286 pence (17 cents to $4.78) after interim results
that showed a 2.7% pretax profit rise.</p>
<p>Pharmaceutical concern SmithKline Beecham dropped 7 pence
to 472 pence after first-quarter pretax profit sagged 6.8% to
#219 million. The results, described by one trader as "pretty
grim," brought the rest of the sector lower.</p>
<p>Glaxo shed 5 1/2 pence to 781 pence; Reckitt & Colman lost
15 pence to #11.44; and Wellcome slid 7 pence to 643 pence.</p>
<p>The banking sector was hit hard following a profit
downgrading of Barclays and Midland by Barclays de Zoete
Wedd, the securities arm of Barclays. Barclays plunged 16
pence to 524 pence; Lloyds sank 10 pence to 265 pence;
Midland fell 5 pence to 290 pence; and National Westminster
lost 7 pence to 329 pence.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, retailer Great Universal Stores dropped 23
pence to 944 pence in a correction to strong gains Tuesday;
Reuters lost 15 pence to #11.04 on profit-taking; and
industrial gases and health care concern BOC fell 13 pence to
507 pence ahead of half-year results today.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, prices closed higher in Zurich and Stockholm;
lower in Paris, Frankfurt, Amsterdam, Milan; mixed in
Brussels. South African gold stocks closed lower.</p>
<p>Also, stocks closed lower in Hong Kong, Seoul and Taipei,
were mixed in Manila, higher in Wellington and little changed
in Sydney. Singapore was closed.</p>
<p>Here are price trends on the world's major stock markets,
as calculated by Morgan Stanley Capital International
Perspective, Geneva. To make them directly comparable, each
index is based on the close of 1969 equaling 100. The
percentage change is since year-end.</p>
