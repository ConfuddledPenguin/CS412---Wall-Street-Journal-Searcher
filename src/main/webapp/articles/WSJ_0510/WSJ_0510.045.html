	<p class="article-leader">The major television networks, faced with a mysteriously
shrinking audience, may try to do away with their practice of
promising advertisers that shows will reach a specific number
of viewers.
   Insiders at all three networks said they hope to scrap the
current guarantee system when they begin negotiating with
advertisers next month for the fall prime-time season.
Instead -- in a move already raising the ire of the
advertising community -- they want to offer different,
less-stringent guarantees. They're considering guaranteeing a
certain range of ratings rather than a specific rating, for
example, or only making guarantees for a small portion of the
ad time sold.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>If successful, the networks would transform the business
of buying television ad time, and save themselves millions of
dollars: When programs fall below guaranteed audience levels,
the networks must give advertisers additional TV time to
"make good" on the promised audience levels. In the first
half of this year alone, the estimated value of `makegoods'
at the three networks reached a painful $150 million to $200
million.</p>
<p>"You can't go into {guarantees} the way you did in prior
years; the ratings aren't the same," says Larry Hoffner,
executive vice president, network sales, at NBC, a unit of
General Electric Co. Adds H. Weller Keever, executive vice
president of Capital Cities/ABC Inc.'s ABC unit: "We have to
find a way to limit our liabilities."</p>
<p>The networks' moves are already drawing hoots from the
advertising community, which isn't about to give up
guaranteed-audience numbers. And to some extent, the networks
are posturing, as they always do just before beginning
negotiations for the fall season. The so-called up-front
negotiations are expected to begin just after the networks
announce their fall lineups a few weeks from now. Even NBC's
Mr. Hoffner concedes that doing away with guarantees as they
stand now is far from a done deal: "I don't know that we're
going to come up with any alternatives at all."</p>
<p>But the talk of slashing guarantees appears to be more
than just a negotiating ploy. The networks are in a serious
bind as the 1989-90 season draws to an end. According to A.C.
Nielsen, viewers have been deserting television in droves;
the number of adults watching prime time plummeted each month
this year, dropping 5.5% in March and 3.6% in April.
Television executives say the total audience of all three
networks fell 7% to 8% below guaranteed levels this year --
an exceptionally costly drop, considering advertisers had
paid about $4 billion for the season's prime-time ad time.</p>
<p>The networks have complained long and loud to Nielsen,
saying there must be some problem with its measurement
system, but to no avail: Nielsen said last week it couldn't
explain the drop-off. So the networks are taking it upon
themselves to come up with alternatives to the traditional
guarantees.</p>
<p>One possibility under discussion would offer audience
guarantees only for certain shows, perhaps only for returning
hits rather than for new shows. Or, the networks might offer
to make good for as much as, say, a 5% drop in guaranteed
ratings, but refuse to do anything if ratings were to slide
further than that. They might also consider doing away with
the very specific guarantees common now -- such as a
guaranteed-audience size of women aged 18 to 49 -- and move
to far broader guarantees, such as the number of households
watching.</p>
<p>"I don't think there's just one way to do it," says NBC's
Mr. Hoffner. "Procter & Gamble has different needs from
McDonald's, so it will give us opportunities to have a
dialogue. There's an opportunity for all of us to be
creative."</p>
<p>"There has to be some acknowledgment that the Nielsen
number isn't a hard, bankable number anymore, and that it has
to be interpreted with some cushioning," adds Jerry Dominus,
a CBS senior vice president. Reinforcing the networks'
contention that the ratings system is flawed, a
network-sponsored study released yesterday claims the current
system misses more than a million viewers each weekend. The
study, sponsored by ABC, NBC, ESPN and Nielsen, said those
viewers were watching at work, in hotels and at bars.</p>
<p>The networks have attempted to peel back the guarantee
system before, but without lasting success. Two years ago,
when the people-meter measurement system was first introduced
and resulted in a drop in children's-TV ratings, ABC withdrew
age-specific guarantees for its kids' programming. Instead,
it offered to guarantee the number of households tuned in, a
far broader measure. But ABC's bold stand lasted only one
season, and a year later it was back to guaranteeing specific
audiences -- just the way advertisers wanted it.</p>
<p>It isn't clear whether the networks will have any more
success this time around, especially considering how
important prime time is to major advertisers -- and
especially when sponsors can turn to the networks' pesky
rivals, such as cable-TV and the Fox network. And those
advertisers are prepared to fight.</p>
<p>"There's going to be major concerns about any attempt on
the networks' part to move away from guarantees," says Rich
Hamilton, a media executive with D'Arcy, Masius, Benton &
Bowles, whose clients include Procter & Gamble. "Guarantees
are a component of advertising value. If you're an
advertiser, why would you want to walk away from them"?</p>
<p>In any case, the way advertisers buy network TV is clearly
changing. Even as the networks attempt to do away with
standard guarantees, they're working with advertisers to come
up with individually tailored ad plans. Last week, General
Motors agreed to a three-year ad package with NBC valued at
more than $500 million, allowing it to lock into some of the
network's most popular shows for the long run. Other big
advertisers have been mulling the package with thoughts of
following, if not this season, then perhaps next.</p>
<p>ABC, meanwhile, is considering package deals of its own,
despite a reluctance in the past. ABC had rebuffed General
Motors, which wanted to discuss the same kind of multiyear,
multiday-part package that it agreed to with NBC. "With our
brightening ratings future in prime time, we thought it was
best not to mortgage our future," says Mr. Keever. But he
said he would be open to discussing one-year packages that
would go across day-parts, perhaps including daytime, prime
time and news.</p>

<p>BBDO Hires Carey</p>
<p>BBDO said it hired Thomas H. Carey, who spent the past 21
years at D'Arcy Masius Benton & Bowles, to take a top post at
its New York office. BBDO, which has been without a president
in New York since Norman Campbell retired in 1988, said Mr.
Carey would hold the titles of president and chief operating
officer.</p>
<p>At DMB&B, Mr. Carey held a number of posts, including
senior management jobs on accounts such as Procter & Gamble
and General Foods. Most recently, Mr. Carey was executive
vice president of DMB&B's international division.</p>

<p>Ad Notes. . . .</p>
<p>MEXICO STAR: Singer Linda Ronstadt will be featured in a
new ad campaign Saatchi & Saatchi Advertising is developing
for Sectur, the Mexico Secretariat of Tourism. The
announcement to feature Ms. Ronstadt was made at a giant
travel-trade convention in Mexico earlier this week. Theme of
the campaign will be "Mexico. The magic never leaves you."</p>
<p>EARNINGS: Grey Advertising, New York, reported
first-quarter net rose 12% to $2.8 million, or $2.08 a share,

year-earlier quarter.</p>
