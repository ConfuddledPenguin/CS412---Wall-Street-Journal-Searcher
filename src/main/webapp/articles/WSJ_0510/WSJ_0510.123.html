	<p class="article-leader">IRVINE, Calif. -- The ferocious news battle over affluent
Orange County took a new turn when Times Mirror Inc.'s Los
Angeles Times refused to run an advertisement for a new cable
service owned by Freedom Newspapers Inc., publisher of the
archrival Orange County Register.
   Alan J. Bell, president of closely held Freedom's
broadcasting division, called the action "petulant," and
after the Register ran a story on the imbroglio yesterday,
Mr. Bell began putting the word out.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>A Times spokeswoman said, "We turned it down because the
Register is a direct competitor and we didn't feel it was in
our best interest to run it."</p>
<p>The two companies have fought it out in this populous
county south of Los Angeles for years, with the Register
currently claiming circulation of about 350,000 and the
Orange County edition of the Times about 200,000. Earlier
this year, the battle erupted on a new front when each
company announced a cable news venture: Freedom is launching
Orange County NewsChannel, a 24-hour local news service in
September; Times-Mirror, with partners, inaugurated a news
service providing 4 1/2-minute news summaries to Orange
County cable suscribers.</p>
<p>Each service has signed up cable operators serving 200,000
households, or half the county's cable subscribers. One
wrinkle to this: Times-Mirror owns Dimension cable, a cable
company serving about 100,000 households. The Times's service
is carried on Dimension; Freedom's service is "in
discussions" with Dimension.</p>
<p>Part of Mr. Bell's pitch for the cable service is his
contention that Orange County residents see themselves as
living in a separate city from Los Angeles, and don't like
being in the shadow of their neighbor to the north. The area
is served by TV stations based in Los Angeles. The ad in
question uses the phrase, "From now on, we're no longer
playing second fiddle to Los Angeles" -- a sentiment that
could, of course, apply to newspapers, too.</p>
<p>The Times spokeswoman said the fact that the ad contained
a solicitation to readers to answer survey questions was the
"specific" problem with the ad, but wouldn't say whether the
ad would have run without the survey questions. Even though
Freedom Newspapers and the Register aren't mentioned in the
ad, she said, "they make it very clear the news channel is an
arm of the newpaper."</p>
<p>Although newspapers legally may refuse advertising and
often do if they deem material offensive to their readers, it
is less common to refuse ads from competitors "as long as the
money's green," especially in today's poor economic climate
for newspapers, said analyst John Morton of Morton & Co. in
Washington, D.C.</p>
<p>"It's pretty small beer to turn down an ad from a
competitor," Mr. Morton said. "There's more overall harm,
from a public-relations standpoint, in not running it. Even
though they're doing better in Orange County recently, I
guess they're still sensitive about the Register."</p>
