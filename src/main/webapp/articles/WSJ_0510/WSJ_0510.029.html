	<p class="article-leader">Thursday, May 10, 9-11 p.m. EDT, on A&E (repeated May 13):
"Yo-Yo Ma: A Month at Tanglewood." Also appearing in this
mellow film about the cellist at work are Isaac Stern, Bobby
McFerrin, Emanuel Ax and Nali Gruber, among others.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Saturday, May 12, 8 p.m.-1 a.m. EDT, on HBO: "Comic
Relief." This fund-raiser for the homeless is now an annual
event, preceded by local comedy shows. Billy Crystal, Whoopi
Goldberg and Robin Williams co-host.</p>
<p>Sunday, May 13, 9-11 p.m. EDT, on CBS: "Shattered Dreams."
The abusive marriage and eventual recovery of Charlotte
Fedders (wife of prominent SEC official John Fedders) are
dramatized in this May Sweeper, starring Lindsay Wagner.</p>
<p>Sunday-Monday, May 13-14, 9-11 p.m. EDT, on NBC: "People
Like Us." Murder and intrigue among hoity-toity New Yorkers
are featured in this rival Sweeper starring Connie Sellecca
and Ben Gazzara.</p>
<p>Tuesdays, May 15-29, 8-9 p.m. EDT, on TDC (repeated on
subsequent Thursdays and Fridays): "Arabia: Sand, Sea & Sky."
Mobil and two Saudi corporations (Sabic and Saudi Aramco)
underwrote this nature walk from the lush mountains of the
southwest to the Red Sea and the great desert.</p>
<p>Tuesday, May 15, 9-10 p.m. EDT, on PBS (PBS air dates and
times vary, so check local listings): "Seven Days in
Bensonhurst." You may not want to relive the racial paroxysm
that followed last August's murder of a young New Yorker
named Yusuf Hawkins. But you may want to wrestle with its
meaning, as writer Shelby Steele tries to do in this edition
of "Frontline." More in Monday's column.</p>
<p>Friday, May 18, 5-5:30 p.m. EDT, on PBS: "Adam Smith's
Money World." A rare TV interview with the legendary
billionaire investor Warren Buffett. Also featured: Katharine
Graham and Daniel Burke.</p>
<p>Saturday, May 19, 8-9:40 p.m. EDT, on HBO (repeated May
21, 24, 27, 29, June 1, 6 and 10): "By Dawn's Early Light."
What if they remade "Dr. Strangelove" without the
anti-military satire? The result would resemble this HBO film
about the early stages of a nuclear conflict begun by mistake
during an era of good superpower relations. With Powers
Boothe, Rebecca De Mornay and James Earl Jones as a senior
officer -- a nice touch, since he played a junior officer in
the 1964 "Dr. Strangelove."</p>
<p>Sunday-Monday, May 20-21, 9-11 p.m. EDT, on ABC: "Voices
Within: The Lives of Truddi Chase." This Sweeper miniseries
stars Shelley Long (formerly of "Cheers") as a woman with
multiple personalities caused by a traumatic childhood. The
obvious comparison is with "Sybil," an outstanding 1976 TV
movie starring Sally Field and Joanne Woodward (now available
on video). Unfortunately, not even Ms. Long's intelligent
acting can rescue the present film, which takes the attitude
that multiple personalities can be fun.</p>
<p>Sunday, May 20, starting at 6 p.m. EDT, on Bravo (repeated
on May 29): "The South Bank Show" and "The Modern World: Ten
Great Writers." Both regular programs will focus on the
fiction of Franz Kafka. Included is an interview with Steven
Berkoff, who adapted Kafka's "Metamorphosis" to the stage;
interviews with three actors who have played Gregor Samsa,
the character who turns into a giant cockroach; a TV version
of "Metamorphosis"; and a presentation of another Kafka work,
"The Trial."</p>
<p>Tuesday, May 22, 9-11 p.m. EDT, on CBS: "Killing in a
Small Town." Meanwhile, back among the Sweepers . . . This
film about a nice Texas lady who also happens to be an ax
murderer has a fine cast -- Barbara Hershey, Brian Dennehy
and Hal Holbrook.</p>
<p>Tuesday, May 22, 9-11 p.m. EDT, on NBC: "Last Flight Out."
Don't blame me -- Sweepers are always broadcast opposite one
another] This entry, fully sponsored by AT&T, stars Richard
Crenna and James Earl Jones as an American airline pilot and
airport official who presided over the departure of the last
overloaded Pan Am plane from Saigon on April 24, 1975. It's
refreshing, after a few seasons of Oliver Stone, to see a
Vietnam movie in which the Communists are actually perceived
as a threat. But unfortunately, historical accuracy doesn't
automatically lead to good drama -- the film is earnest but
plodding.</p>
