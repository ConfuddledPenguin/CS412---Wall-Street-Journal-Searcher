	<p class="article-leader">"Longtime Companion" has the tone and style of television
movies designed to enlighten the public without provoking or
alarming anyone. Such instructional dramas tend to handle
potentially controversial subjects in a conventional way so
as to defuse any possible objection to the subject matter.
   "Longtime Companion," a feature film about the effect of
acquired immune deficiency syndrome on a small group of
relatively affluent and educated New Yorkers, suffers
artistically from these constraints. Even so, the picture
contains much poignancy -- and yes, it is instructive on how
AIDS developed in 10 years from a curiosity to a central
focus of homosexual life.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Playwright Craig Lucas, who wrote the screenplay, and
director Norman Rene, whose main work has been in theater,
have given this movie the structure and style of a stage
play. You could turn the picture off and not miss very much.</p>
<p>However, they have ably done what they set out to do. They
have created a group of homosexual characters who are
familiar and likable and completely nonthreatening. These
aren't people living on the fringe in any apparent way.</p>
<p>They are leading comfortable middle-class and better lives
as well-paid professionals who eat well, exercise and for the
most part settle into monogamous relationships. Only the most
rabid homosexual-haters could wish nice men like these any
harm.</p>
<p>They would be nice to the point of absolute dullness, in
fact, if AIDS weren't introduced into the story to inject
horrible melodrama into their lives. The film's power comes
from its understated if somewhat antiseptic handling of that
melodrama, and from the way the various characters react to
being forced to consider their mortality much earlier than
they'd expected.</p>
<p>The film makers have used a kind of docudrama approach,
starting each scene with a date to establish the progress of
AIDS into the characters' consciousness and, in some cases,
into their bodies. The movie opens in 1981, with many small
vignettes establishing just how ordinary these men are. There
are a businessman, a lawyer, an actor, a gym instructor, an
investor of his own inherited wealth, and a soap-opera
writer. We see them either in their comfortable apartments
and offices or at the lovely beach house one couple shares in
the Hamptons.</p>
<p>These opening scenes are light and playful. There is a
funny shot mimicking the standard beach movie where a
gorgeous young, thin creature in a skimpy bathing suit causes
every head to turn -- only here the gawkers are men and so is
the object of their lust. There is exposition meant to plant
the idea that homosexuals have arrived in "respectable"
society. "There are gay restaurants now," says one character.
"Gay doctors, gay lawyers . . ."</p>
<p>The first mention of AIDS reaches many people in many
locations simultaneously reading an article in 1981 in the
New York Times. But this news is dismissed, much the way
European Jews dismissed the early warnings about Nazi
atrocities.</p>
<p>As the years pass, however, homosexuals have to stop
dismissing AIDS as something that's happpening to somebody
else. Sooner or later all the characters are forced to
confront the horror that may one day be theirs. This is one
situation where watching a friend fall ill and feeling
panicky yourself isn't a hypochondriac response. Like the
love scenes, the picture's main deathbed drama is shot
discreetly, but without shrinking from the awful premature
senility that often precedes death by AIDS.</p>
<p>Aside from the title, which refers to the euphemistic way
obituary writers refer to the survivor of a homosexual
relationship, this film doesn't dabble much in irony.
However, it does make note of the fact that as the homosexual
community's health is being attacked, public acceptance of
homosexuals increased: A homosexual character was introduced
on a daytime soap opera.</p>
<p>The film makers have taken the edge off their material by
refusing to delve into the political as well as the
psychological ramifications of the disease. But despite the
limitations imposed by the bad-things-happen-to-good-people
approach, the sadness is very real.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>When Hubert Selby Jr. published "Last Exit to Brooklyn" 25
years ago, the book's violence and bleakness were shockers.
An English court declared its stark and graphic vision of the
urban underbelly to be obscene.</p>
<p>Now the book's loosely connected stories about life on the
waterfront have been made into a movie that seems strangely
anachronistic. Though much of the film was shot in the
scabrous Red Hook section of Brooklyn, the German director
Uli Edel has created a work that feels like a relic of German
expressionism. Even the Brooklyn Bridge looks foreign.</p>
<p>Still, there's some powerful stuff in this dark and darkly
photographed vision of working-class life, especially
Jennifer Jason Leigh's frighteningly astute portrayal of the
self-destructive prostitute Tralala.</p>

<p>VIDEO TIP: Life in Brooklyn isn't always grim, and many
Brooklyn boys have made good in the movies. Look what
happened to John Travolta in "Saturday Night Fever."</p>

<p>APOLOGIES: To singer Sister Carol, for mistakenly calling
her Sister Mary in the course of praising her rendition of
"Wild Thing" in the movie "Something Wild."</p>
