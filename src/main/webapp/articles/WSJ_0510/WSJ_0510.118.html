	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Moody's Investors Service Inc. said it lowered
the ratings on about $1.7 billion of debt of Pennzoil Co.
because of uncertainty surrounding the company's investment
in Chevron Corp.
   That $2.1 billion investment represents about 45% of
Pennzoil's total assets. Moody's said concern remains over
how long Houston-based Pennzoil will retain its holdings in
San Francisco-based Chevron or whether it will attempt to
increase its stake, at the risk of further burdening an
already leveraged capital structure.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Additionally, Pennzoil is experiencing weak operating
performance and may soon be hit with a tax bill that could
total close to $800 million. The tax issue stems from the
settlement of litigation with Texaco Inc. Downgraded by
Moody's were Pennzoil's debentures, notes, Euronotes and
preliminarily rated shelf registration, to single A-3, from
single A-2. Its commercial paper also was downgraded to
Prime-2, from Prime-1.</p>
