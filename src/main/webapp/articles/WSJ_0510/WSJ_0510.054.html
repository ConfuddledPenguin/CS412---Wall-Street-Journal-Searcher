	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- Bank failures have slowed considerably this
year, said William Seidman, chairman of the Federal Deposit
Insurance Corp.
   As of Tuesday, 52 banks with assets of $4.7 billion had
failed in 1990. By contrast, at this time last year, 73 banks
with $19.7 billion in assets had failed or received FDIC
assistance in order to continue operating, Mr. Seidman said.
No banks have received such FDIC aid this year.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Last year's figures included 20 bank subsidiaries of
Dallas-based MCorp, with assets of $15.6 billion. For all of
last year, 207 banks with $29 billion in assets failed or
were assisted by the FDIC.</p>
<p>Mr. Seidman said in an interview that initial figures show
the FDIC's bank deposit-insurance fund had a loss of about
$800 million last year, larger than the $250 million-to-$500
million loss he predicted late last year. He said the larger
loss stemmed from greater-than-expected costs from the MCorp
failures and from the failure this year of Seamen's Bank for
Savings, based in New York. (Under its accounting rules, the
FDIC must account for some of those costs in its 1989
results.)</p>
<p>That loss will leave the deposit-insurance fund with about
$13.2 billion, or about 0.7% of insured deposits. Government
policy is to try to maintain the fund at about 1.25% of
insured deposits. Final figures on the fund's performance
last year are to be released May 18.</p>
<p>Mr. Seidman said the fund could increase somewhat during
this year, but the failure of a large bank would probably
cause a loss. He wouldn't say whether he was expecting a
large bank failure.</p>
<p>Mr. Seidman, who is also chairman of the Resolution Trust
Corp., said the RTC may abandon its policy that permits
buyers of insolvent thrifts to repudiate rates paid on
certificates of deposit after two weeks. The RTC is the
agency charged with selling or liquidating hundreds of
insolvent thrifts taken over by the government.</p>
<p>In a meeting scheduled for May 18, the agency will
consider requiring buyers to honor CD rates for three months,
he said. The policy has recently been recommended to the RTC
board by its staff, he said.</p>
<p>The move would mean that buyers of insolvent thrifts would
know exactly the cost of funds from the market, Mr. Seidman
said, and that depositors -- often big-deposit brokers --
would have the assurance that their rates would be locked in
for at least 90 days after the thrift is sold. Depositors,
for example, would be able to compare rates at insolvent
thrifts with those of 90-day Treasury instruments, he said.</p>
<p>Eliminating the uncertainty ultimately means lower costs
for obtaining funds and greater liquidity, Mr. Seidman said.
"If someone has uncertainty, they are going to require a
higher rate," he said.</p>
<p>Mr. Seidman said the RTC's ambitious project to sell about
140 thrifts by the end of June to get the troubled
thrift-industry bailout off the ground is "on schedule."</p>
<p>He said sales of assets separately from thrift
institutions were also moving forward, with about $600
million in sales last month. But he said rising interest
rates may make such asset sales more difficult in coming
weeks.</p>
