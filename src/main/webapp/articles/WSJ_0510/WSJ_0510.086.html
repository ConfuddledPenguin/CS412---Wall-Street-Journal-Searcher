	<p class="article-leader">PARIS -- British Aerospace PLC and Aerospatiale of France
confirmed they will conduct a five-year study to decide
whether to develop a new supersonic airliner to replace their
jointly produced Concorde.
   The final decision on whether to proceed with a $10
billion dollar production program will be made in 1995,
Aerospatiale President Henri Martre said.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>He said the feasibility study, which would cost about $34
million dollars, would focus on such issues as market
potential, technical factors and environmental protection.</p>
<p>Mr. Martre said the British and French companies would
welcome cooperation with other industrial powers, including
the U.S., Soviet Union, West Germany and Japan.</p>
<p>British Airways and Air France together operate 13
Concordes on trans-Atlantic routes. These planes are due for
retirement within 15 to 20 years; the new planes, if
developed, would be ready by about 2005.</p>
<p>The projected aircraft would be capable of nonstop flights
across the Pacific.</p>
