	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- The high-yield junk bond market is likely to
get a lift today as state insurance commissioners present a
stretched-out timetable for new investment regulations that
affect junk bonds.
   At issue are the statutory reserves that insurance
companies must build up against the possibility of defaults
in their bond portfolios. State insurance commissioners this
spring have been drafting tougher new reserve rules that
could take effect as soon as Jan. 1.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The new rules' biggest impact is expected to be in the
junk bond market, where insurers own about 30% of the $200
billion of publicly traded junk bonds outstanding. In some
cases, regulators plan to require that reserves be built up
five to 20 times as fast as is currently being done. Because
those greater reserve demands would make junk bonds less
appealing to insurers, fears of an insurance-company sell-off
of junk bonds have built up.</p>
<p>But insurance companies appear to have persuaded
regulators to move cautiously. At a Washington meeting today,
regulators are expected to present the insurance industry
with a plan to phase in the new rules gradually over five
years. "People are saying they want a transition period so
this doesn't affect their balance sheets," said Terence
Lennon, chief examiner of the New York State Insurance
Department. "We're taking a very slow and measured approach."</p>
<p>Mr. Lennon heads a working group of the 50-state National
Association of Insurance Commissioners that is drafting the
new reserve rules. The latest version of the rules is
expected to be adopted by the entire association next month.</p>
