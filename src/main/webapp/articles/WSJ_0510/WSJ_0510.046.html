	<h3>Media: `Interactive TV' Test Is Watched to See Who's More Than Remotely Interested</h3>

	<p class="article-leader">SPRINGFIELD, Mass. -- Lately, Donald Ainsworth hasn't been
getting enough sleep. Not because of insomnia, but because he
stays up for "Midnight Blackjack" -- a television game show
in which viewers, using a special remote control, play
against the on-screen dealer.
   Crouched in front of his TV late one evening, the
30-year-old dairy company employee can't call it quits --
even though the cards aren't going his way. "You're getting
pretty bad," the TV dealer taunts after winning another hand.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Mr. Ainsworth is one of 300 cable-TV customers here taking
part in an eight-week experiment in "interactive TV," a
technology that is unproven, but progressing. With
interactive TV, couch potatoes don't just watch the tube,
they tell it what to do by pushing certain buttons, which
trigger a choice of broadcast "responses."</p>
<p>Through ACTV Inc., a fledgling New York company that's
conducting the experiment with Mr. Ainsworth, viewers not
only participate in game shows, but can choose different
camera angles while watching live sports events, select an
exercise program personalized for their age and weight, get
advice from panelists on "Teen Talk Forum," or decide to hear
"clean" or "dirty" jokes on comedy shows.</p>
<p>"It's a revolution," says James Demers, 53, a Springfield
cook who is also taking part in the ACTV test, which ends
this week. "You get the sensation that they geared {the
programs} just to you."</p>
<p>A handful of small entertainment companies has been
exploring the field of interactive television for about a
decade. Interactive Network Inc. of Mountain View, Calif.,
for example, has tested for more than two years a system that
allows home viewers to compete with game shows on regular
television. But ACTV's system is one of the most advanced to
date, and it's already on the market in Montreal.</p>
<p>Advertisers are watching ACTV's Springfield study with
great interest because, with its technology, ACTV can keep
track of each household's selections. This could enable
advertisers to use interactive TV to target their commercials
only to homes that fit the right demographics. "From a
marketing perspective, everybody is trying to move to a more
efficient media. I think {interactive TV} will be an
important step in that direction," says Martin Nisenholtz,
president of Interactive Marketing, a division of Ogilvy &
Mather Advertising.</p>
<p>Some big spenders in the ad world are interested in the
concept, ACTV says in a prospectus for a public stock
offering. Among the companies evaluating ACTV's technology
are McCann-Erickson Worldwide advertising agency, General
Motors Corp., Coca-Cola Co. and American Telephone &
Telegraph Co., the prospectus says.</p>
<p>But interactive TV has a long way to go to prove itself.
Participants in the experiment received the service for free
-- and some say they'd be reluctant to pay extra for the
novelty. Others got bored after a few weeks, saying that the
programming was limited and repetitious. "I'd rather watch
ESPN," says Paul Huckins, a 35-year-old mail handler.</p>
<p>And there are clearly bugs to work out, as equipment
breakdowns at some homes attest. "They came twice to fix it
and it broke again," says Denise Bolduc, a 30-year-old retail
worker.</p>
<p>Indeed, media specialists say there is reason for caution,
at least in the near future. Interactive TV has
"extraordinary" potential for hooking the audience, says
Everette Dennis, executive director of the Gannett Center for
Media Studies at Columbia University. But, he notes, "there's
an assumption here that somehow the public wants to choose
its own fare . . . like a book or magazine selection. Whether
it applies to an electronic market isn't yet clear."</p>
<p>Nor is it profitable at this point. ACTV, struggling to
develop the business, has shown losses for the past five
years. Indeed, its prospectus said: "There can be no
assurance that the company will generate significant
operating revenues in the future. The likelihood of the
success of the company must be considered in light of the
problems, costs, difficulties and delays encountered in
connection with . . . the development of new and unproven
technologies." ACTV declined to discuss any aspect of the
business, including the Springfield test, because of the
offering.</p>
<p>ACTV first installed its technology last year in about
3,000 Montreal homes. The service, which adds the equivalent
of about $16 to regular monthly cable-TV bills, is offered
through Le Groupe Videotron, a cable company that is also a
minority partner in ACTV.</p>
<p>To permit the viewer to "personalize" the programming,
ACTV's technology simultaneously transmits several previously
videotaped versions of the same show. Each viewer, using a
special remote control, chooses the variation he wants or
responds to multiple-choice quiz-show questions -- which
prompt different footage depending on the viewer's answer.
While the on-screen reactions to viewers' answers are canned,
they're meant to give the impression that characters on the
television actually know how a question has been answered: In
shows where viewers are pitted against on-screen contestants,
for instance, players on TV sometimes laugh at viewers' wrong
answers.</p>
<p>Watching a game show called "College All-Stars," Marie
Pratt, a 32-year-old teacher, sits with remote in hand. "We
in the United States call them hurricanes. In Japan they call
them..." "Kamikazes," Ms. Pratt shouts, punching in one of
the multiple-choice answers. A TV player stifles a laugh as
the game-show host replies, "You at home are wrong." (The
answer is typhoons.)</p>
<p>Playing against TV contestants is fun, Ms. Pratt says. "If
I watch Jeopardy {on regular TV}, I'm usually answering
anyway," she says. "I just don't get credit for it."</p>
<p>Mr. Ainsworth says interactive TV is the best way to watch
the Springfield Indians of the American Hockey League. He can
choose from four different live camera angles -- from a
close-up of the goalie to an overhead shot of the entire rink
-- whenever he wants.</p>
<p>His wife, Lynn, a 30-year-old secretary, likes the
personalized workout she can get on "Exercise Chalet," one of
the interactive programs. At the start of the show, she
programs in her age and weight and chooses among the three
exercise levels (she chooses beginner); this tells the
television which signal to send to her TV, and the on-screen
instructor starts doing exercises best suited for that level.</p>
<p>Similarly, a music-video program gives viewers a choice of
what they want to hear, instead of making them settle for
whatever happens to be on.</p>
<p>One shortcoming of the current programming, some say, is
that there still isn't enough variety. The schedule of shows
is the same almost every day, and there isn't any interactive
programming between 11:30 a.m. and 2 p.m. most days or
between 1 a.m. and 7 a.m.</p>
<p>But ACTV believes programming would broaden as the market
does. "If the subscriber reaction to ACTV in Springfield is
as positive as we expect," Michael Freeman, chairman of ACTV,
said in a statement, "we'll expand the market for ACTV as
quickly as we can."</p>
