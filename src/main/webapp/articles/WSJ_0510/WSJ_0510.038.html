	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- The "peace dividend" is alive, well and
floating a few inches above a railroad track at 300 miles an
hour.
   Since late last year, lawmakers have fretted over whether
the shrinking of the nation's military would benefit
long-starved domestic needs, or whether the much-vaunted
peace dividend would go instead only to pare the federal
budget deficit.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Well, federal money is gradually dribbling into new
domestic programs, including a futuristic, high-speed railway
system called Maglev. Officials have been falling all over
themselves trying to find it funds, and defense contractors
are wild about it, too. Believing it might provide them new
business as the market for weapons slows, they are lobbying
for more federal dollars.</p>
<p>Increased funding for Maglev "is a way to get us back on
track," asserts Richard Gran, director of advanced concepts
at Grumman Corp., a Bethpage, N.Y., military contractor.</p>
<p>"It's a natural," agrees Democratic Rep. Robert Mrazek, in
whose Long Island, N.Y., district many Grumman employees
live. He is among a growing number of Maglev backers in
Congress and in the Bush administration.</p>
<p>Maglev is short for magnetically levitated transportation.
Under this technology, powerful electromagnets raise a train
inches above a metal guideway and propel it forward at great
speed. In Congress and in the Bush administration, Maglev is
being hailed as a clean, quiet and safe way to help reduce
congestion on highways and at airports.</p>
<p>In his budget for fiscal 1991, President Bush singled out
Maglev as an "emerging technology," and recommended more than
quadrupling, to $9.7 million, federal funds to study the
system. Bills are being readied in the House and Senate to go
much further. Rep. Mrazek, for example, would authorize $950
million for the study and construction of a demonstration
guideway.</p>
<p>To be sure, the Maglev field is filled with some
high-powered hyperbole. To hear zealots tell it, Maglev
trains will be speeding passengers to work almost any day
now. In fact, there isn't a commercial Maglev anywhere, and
there is some doubt whether there will be one anytime soon.
"The Maglev business brings out a lot of oddballs; you find
people like that running around all over the place," says
Robert Kiernan, coordinator of Maglev 2000, a trade group
representing potential U.S. component makers.</p>
<p>There also is serious opposition to Maglev. Advocates of
expanding urban mass transit, for instance, worry that
pie-in-the-sky hopes for Maglev might take funds away from
their less-flashy though more-fundamental systems. In
addition, they assert that Maglev is wholly incompatible with
existing transit modes and ill-suited for most mass-transit
uses, which entails frequent stopping. "There's nothing
inherently wonderful about it . . . and a lot of hype,"
grouses Frank Cihak, chief engineer of the American Public
Transit Association.</p>
<p>Maglev was developed at the Brookhaven National Laboratory
on Long Island and at the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology in the 1960s and early 1970s, and was backed and
tested by the U.S. government. But, when the federal budget
deficit began to swell, Maglev was one of the first victims.
U.S. development of the technology died along with its
federal funding in 1975. In the meantime, Japan and West
Germany each poured about $1 billion into developing the
technology. They now boast demonstration models of the train
and are moving toward commercial versions they hope to sell
abroad, particularly in the U.S.</p>
<p>Leading the fight to restore federal funding, and to bring
Maglev home to the U.S. again, is Sen. Daniel Moynihan. The
New York Democrat sees the technology as the inevitable next
generation of transportation, and has almost single-handedly
forced the federal bureaucracy and his colleagues in Congress
to pay attention to it.</p>
<p>The senator's first task was to provide some federal
support. "No major transportation revolution has ever
progressed in the U.S. without substantial federal
involvement," he wrote in an essay for Scientific American
magazine. "Maglev will be no exception."</p>
<p>His mission was made difficult by officials at the
Transportation Department. Gilbert Carmichael, the federal
railroad administrator, for example, insisted that industry,
not government, should lead the way. "We want to use a very
little amount of money to stimulate the private sector and
the states," he says.</p>
<p>In response, Sen. Moynihan publicly referred to Mr.
Carmichael as a "boob," and maneuvered privately to funnel
federal dollars to his pet project. Using his chairmanship of
the Public Works Committee's subcommittee on transportation,
he authorized the Corps of Engineers to study Maglev, and
then used his influence to win $1 million in appropriations
for that purpose last year.</p>
<p>The action instigated a turf battle in Congress and in the
executive branch, which ultimately has meant even more money
for Maglev. Seeing the Corps of Engineers getting ahead on
the issue, the Transportation Department sought and won a
half-million dollars for its own Maglev study last year. And
this year, thanks mostly to the new-found interest of
President Bush, almost everyone wants into the act.</p>
<p>On April 3, the Senate Commerce Committee voted to create
a new high-speed rail office in the Transportation Department
and to authorize $100 million over two years for matching
grants with U.S. companies to research Maglev. On April 24,
the Senate Public Works Committee voted to allow Maglev
projects to be built on federal highway rights of way. Inside
the Bush administration, a special interagency group has been
formed to coordinate Maglev efforts. And just last week, the
government hosted a two-day Government-Industry Maglev Forum
to discuss what it dubs the "Federal Maglev Initiative."</p>
<p>Outside government, lobbying groups advocating Maglev are
springing up and thriving. These include Maglev 2000, a task
force of the Council on Superconductivity, and Maglev USA, a
new but quickly growing group of U.S. corporations that want
to have a hand in the technology's U.S. revival. Members of
Maglev USA include defense contractors Grumman; General
Electric Co.; Westinghouse Electric Corp.'s
electronics-systems group; construction-engineering
companies, such as Rust International Corp., a subsidiary of
Wheelabrator Technologies Inc., and Sverdrup Corp.; and the
CSX Transportation Inc. unit of CSX Corp., a transportation
giant.</p>
<p>The biggest spurt of interest has come from defense
contractors, according to Wayne Thevenot, a Maglev USA
officer, and for good reason. "We have as an objective to
apply defense technologies to non-defense applications,"
explains Aris Melissaratos, a vice president for the
Westinghouse Electronic Systems Group. "Maglev could offer
some business opportunities."</p>
<p>Defense contractors are frequent attendees of Maglev
conferences, and meet regularly with lawmakers and policy
makers to urge their support. General Dynamics Inc. has met
with Mr. Carmichael, the railroad administrator. And
representatives of Grumman, General Dynamics, Maglev 2000 and
Maglev USA accompanied Rep. Mrazek on April 25 when he made
the rounds of senior lawmakers whose committees hold sway
over the future of Maglev funding.</p>
<p>Few expect hundreds of millions of dollars to be allocated
to Maglev this year. But increasing sums are sure to be
whizzing its way soon. "There's no question Maglev is going
to be built here in the U.S.," says Maglev 2000's Mr.
Kiernan. "It's a question of whether American companies will
compete in their own market."</p>
<p>Sen. Moynihan, for one, is pessimistic that the Bush
administration will permit more than a token sum to be spent
on Maglev, far less than is needed to get the system rolling.
But Rep. Mrazek is more sanguine. Maglev, he says, "is an
easy one to sell politically."</p>
