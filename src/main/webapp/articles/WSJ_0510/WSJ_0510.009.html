	<p class="article-leader">May Day was tough on communists in Red Square this year,
but for some in the U.S. the dream still lives. At the State
Department, the Secretary's April 30 Open Forum "to
commemorate May Day" featured Tim Wheeler, the Washington
correspondent for the Communist Party U.S.A. newspaper, the
People's Daily World. His speech topic: "New Potential for
the Left: Communism After the Cold War Ends." It's nice to
know someone at State has a sense of humor.</p>
