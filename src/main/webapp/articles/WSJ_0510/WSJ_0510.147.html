	<p class="article-leader">Primerica Corp. proposed buying the remainder of the
publicly held stock in American Capital Management & Research
Inc. Primerica already owns 82.6% of American's shares.
   Primerica, a New York financial-services concern, said it
would exchange 0.3 share of its common stock for each
American share it doesn't own. American has a total of 24.4
million shares outstanding.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The company said it would issue 1,270,000 million new
shares to complete the transaction. Based on Primerica's
recent stock price, the transaction's value would be $38
million.</p>
<p>American Capital Management, Houston, provides investment
advice to mutual funds and closed-end investment companies,
with a total of $12.8 billion in assets under management as
of March 31. Its business has been hurt recently by an
oversupply of mutual funds and slumping stock and bond
prices.</p>
<p>The transaction is subject to the approval of both
companies' boards.</p>
<p>In New York Stock Exchange composite trading, Primerica
was unchanged at $29.625 a share; American Capital closed at
$9.125 a share, up 75 cents.</p>
