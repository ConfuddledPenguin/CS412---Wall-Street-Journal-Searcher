	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Here are two words not often heard on Wall
Street these days: record earnings.
   But several smaller regional securities firms -- including
Legg Mason Inc., A.G. Edwards Inc. and Raymond James
Financial Inc. -- posted record revenue and earnings for past
12 months. Regionals typically are based far from New York
and focus more on clients around the corner than around the
globe.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Yesterday, Legg Mason reported a 75% jump in net income
for its fiscal fourth quarter ended March 31, and a 97% rise
for the fiscal year, capping relatively robust returns for
the nation's regional securities firms -- and a far cry from
the woes engulfing many big national brokerage firms.</p>
<p>The regionals "continue to add to their sales forces and
bring in more customers," says Perrin Long, senior securities
analyst for Lipper Analytical Securities Corp. "At most
regional firms, revenues are rising more rapidly than
expenses."</p>
<p>Legg Mason's results underscore the good news at many
small regional concerns. Their brokerage business serving
individual investors and their investment advisory business,
particularly mutual funds, are prospering, compared with a
lackluster year-earlier period. The improvement in Legg
Mason's retail, or individual-investor, segment reflected a
"modest increase" in the number of the firm's brokers and a
jump in average revenue per broker. And revenue from Legg
Mason's investment advisory business, primarily mutual funds,
rose 22% from a year earlier.</p>
<p>Fourth-quarter net at the Baltimore-based securities firm
was $1.7 million, or 20 cents a share, up from $951,000, or
11 cents a share, a year earlier. Revenue rose 10% to $58.7
million from $53.2 million.</p>
<p>Not all regional securities firms have prospered recently.
Net in the most recent quarter fell 19% at Piper Jaffray
Inc., for example. And some big securities firms,
particularly Morgan Stanley Group Inc., are thriving even
amid the current Wall Street recession.</p>
<p>But it generally has been tougher going for most
full-service national brokerage firms, many of whom have been
sharply cutting back staff. The big securities firms have
been hit hard by a slowdown in investment banking
revenue-down more than 20% at many big firms. And the
investment-banking slump was offset at some firms only by fat
trading gains, which can't be counted on to continue.</p>
<p>Regional firms, however, are much more dependent on the
activity of individual investors; indeed, their performance
is often viewed as a gauge of small-investor interest in the
stock market. And despite their recent rebound, regional
firms' net income still stands at just half its peak in 1986.
In 1989, regionals' net doubled to $215 million but was still
well below 1986's record $546 million, according to the
Securities Industry Association.</p>
<p>Regionals face stiffer competition, moreover, from some
full-service national firms such as Shearson Lehman Hutton
Inc. that are redirecting their energies back to serving
individual investors. Still, regionals have a head start in
courting the little guy, cutting costs and focusing on a few
profitable businesses.</p>
<p>Regionals "already are well on their way -- if they're not
already niche firms," says Alison Deans, an analyst at Smith
Barney, Harris Upham & Co. "They're sticking to their
strengths and keeping costs low."</p>
<p>Legg Mason stock fell 12.5 cents to close at $13.125 a
share in New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday.</p>
