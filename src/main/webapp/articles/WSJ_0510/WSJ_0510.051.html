	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- Back in January, the Securities and Exchange
Commission met to consider the fate of one James O'Hagan, a
respected Minneapolis lawyer who allegedly had run afoul of
securities laws. The commission's investigators insisted he
was an insider trader who bought Pillsbury Co. stock on the
secret knowledge that his firm's client, Grand Metropolitan
PLC, planned to bid for the company.
   Now, SEC attorneys were trying to persuade the
commissioners to let them file charges against Mr. O'Hagan.
An easy decision, concluded the commission's new chairman,
Richard Breeden. "This man," he said sternly to his staff,
"should be left naked, homeless and without wheels."</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Insider-trading charges were soon filed. A lawyer for Mr.
O'Hagan says his client is innocent, and the case is still
pending. But one thing is certain: Guilty or not, Mr. O'Hagan
is dealing with a new -- and tougher -- SEC.</p>
<p>Spurred by a growing national call for a crackdown on
white-collar crime, and led by an ambitious, publicity-hungry
chairman, the SEC has suddenly gotten more hard-line with
people suspected of violating securities laws. It is charging
not just brokers and traders but their supervisors,
accountants and lawyers. And it is taking more securities
cases to trial.</p>
<p>The harder line is in keeping with the Bush
administration's style of deregulation: Ease the rules, but
come down hard on those who violate them. "I tend to be
somewhat skeptical that some of our traditional remedies are
adequate to prevent improper conduct," says Mr. Breeden, a
slim, intense 40-year-old.</p>
<p>Mr. Breeden has been at the SEC less than eight months,
but his attitude already has trickled down. Carmen Lawrence,
the enforcement chief for the SEC's largest regional office
in New York, says that, looking back over recent years and
the many wrist-slappings the SEC handed out, it is clear that
"the deterrent effect of what we were doing wasn't great."
So, she says, "the view now is to make it cost."</p>
<p>According to defense lawyers and SEC staff members, the
commission under Mr. Breeden is rejecting settlements
negotiated by its staff that it previously would have
rubber-stamped. The pacts it does approve tend to be stiffer
than in the past. Five years ago, for example, a broker who
peddled unregistered securities -- a typical problem in
penny-stock cases -- could have expected to settle for a
30-day suspension from the securities industry. Now, the norm
is six months. Repeat offenders are likely to be barred from
the securities business for life.</p>
<p>"We see it every day in our negotiating," says Arthur
Mathews, a prominent defense lawyer at Wilmer, Cutler &
Pickering in Washington. "The staff demands more in sanctions
because the commission is demanding more. I've seen the
commission turn down settlements negotiated with the staff
that the staff certainly would have taken."</p>
<p>Some say the SEC is making up for the weaker enforcement
program of the early 1980s, when Ivan Boesky, Michael Milken,
Dennis Levine and others made Wall Street a playground for
lawbreakers. Others contend that the SEC simply is responding
to a surge in financial crime. "The 1980s were such a boom in
the financial markets that the stock market became
everybody's opportunity," says Commissioner Mary Schapiro.
"That kind of opportunity breeds fraudsters."</p>
<p>The SEC has cracked down in the past, but never appeared
so eager to litigate, even in the days of legendary
enforcement chief Stanley Sporkin. Back then, in the 1970s,
the SEC was inclined to initiate many cases, but husband its
resources by settling virtually all of them.</p>
<p>SEC staffers now say that, over the years, the agency may
have become too eager to settle. "We probably let ourselves
go down a road of lesser settlements," says current
enforcement director William McLucas. "Now we are moving back
up the ladder." To prove it isn't bluffing, and ensure its
own effectiveness, the agency "has to be willing to litigate
a case to conclusion," adds Mr. Breeden.</p>
<p>This latest swing toward severity began in the mid-1980s,
when the SEC finally began cracking down on big insider
traders such as Messrs. Levine and Boesky. Mr. Breeden has
given that drive a big push. These days, his SEC rarely
settles a case without full repayment of ill-gotten gains.
Not having the money isn't a defense any longer; the SEC
encourages defendants to take out loans to pay back the
gains.</p>
<p>If a defendant says he can't afford full reimbursement, he
must produce financial statements proving his case. Several
times in the past few months, insiders say, Mr. Breeden has
argued against leniency and insisted defendants seek the
protection of bankruptcy laws if they need to. It isn't clear
whether any defendants actually have been pushed that far.</p>
<p>The uncompromising posture isn't without costs. A growing
number of defendants are balking at the tougher terms, and
litigation has ballooned, pushing the SEC's pending caseload
to 70 cases from 18 just four years ago. The caseload now is
near capacity, and is eating up limited resources.</p>
<p>And the more SEC cases that go to litigation, the greater
risk the agency runs of significant reversals. Just last
week, the agency lost an insider-trading conviction on an
appeal by former stockbroker Robert Chestman. The appellate
decision undercut a major SEC rule on insider trading.</p>
<p>Moreover, not everybody is convinced that Mr. Breeden
really is a tougher cop. Some wonder whether the commission
is just jawboning to cast itself as a more formidable
negotiator in settlement talks. "To me it's business as
usual," scoffs Washington securities lawyer Wallace Timmeny.
"I don't see anything except tough talk."</p>
<p>But others in the front lines unhappily report that Mr.
Breeden is acting as well as talking. Recalls one individual
close to deposed junk-bond king Michael Milken: "Breeden
wanted to boil Michael in oil."</p>
<p>Even relatively small-potatoes cases are coming under the
hot spotlight. On Tuesday, for example, the SEC charged in
federal court in Chicago that the son of B.F. Saul II, the
chairman of a big Maryland thrift institution, passed along
inside information about his father's acquisition in 1988 of
a real-estate investment trust. The 28-year-old son, Frank,
didn't make any money on the alleged violation, the SEC says,
but violated a supposed duty to his father by tipping off his
roommate, who made a $38,000 profit by buying shares in the
trust before the takeover.</p>
<p>The elder Mr. Saul says that, under oath, the roommate
swore he "didn't get anything from my son." Frank Saul
independently took a lie detector test, passed that, and
offered to take another from the SEC, the senior Mr. Saul
says. The SEC rejected that offer, he adds.</p>
<p>"I think it's just the bureaucracy run wild," he says.
"The charges are untrue, and we're not about to cop a plea.
Who would want that blemish on their record?"</p>
<p>But the SEC is adamant. "A lot of people come in and say
their dog ate their homework," says Thomas Newkirk, the
agency's chief litigator. The Sauls' explanation, he
contends, "just doesn't hold up."</p>
<p>Some attorneys worry that this new inclination to take no
prisoners may lead the agency to act overzealously. Take, for
example, the commission's decision in January to charge
several foreign firms with insider trading in Rorer Group
Inc. securities. The charge stirred plenty of negative
publicity for the defendants but, so far, hasn't gotten very
far in court. Late last month, a federal judge in Manhattan
denied the SEC a preliminary injunction it sought against two
of the defendants to prevent their selling of their Rorer
securities. After that decision, the SEC, citing a lack of
evidence, voluntarily dismissed its case against one of them,
Fondation Hai, a Lichtenstein-based foundation.</p>
<p>"The filing of this complaint without any investigation
was unduly hasty, if not irresponsible," contends Andrew
Levander, a New York attorney representing Fondation Hai.</p>
<p>Clearly, Chairman Breeden, who joined the commission last
October, has brought a fresh eye to enforcement decisions. He
isn't an alumnus of the SEC, and isn't a member of the
unofficial club of securities lawyers who take a proprietary
view of the agency. The son of a greeting-card salesman, he
graduated from Harvard Law School and then practiced law in
New York and Washington, D.C. In 1980, he worked in the
Reagan campaign. After holding several White House posts, he
helped Mr. Bush prepare for the 1988 primaries by playing
Jack Kemp in practice debates.</p>
<p>President Bush rewarded Mr. Breeden with the chairmanship
of the SEC. Called savvy by some and arrogant by others, Mr.
Breeden moved quickly to reshape the commission in his image.
He is pushing hard in Congress for broader SEC enforcement
powers and is fighting to steal oversight authority from a
cousin of the SEC, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission.
He has positioned himself as an ambassador of capitalism,
advising Soviet and Eastern European officials on
establishing or expanding their stock exchanges. Staffers
complain he is more inclined to spend four hours with the
Hungarian finance minister than 20 minutes on important
agency issues.</p>
<p>Mr. Breeden's domineering approach -- some at the SEC
privately call him King Richard -- sharply contrasts with
that of his immediate predecessor, the professorial David
Ruder, who allowed his staff to run the show, deferring to
its expertise. Unlike most of his predecessors, for whom the
SEC job was generally the culmination of a career in
securities law, Mr. Breeden is said to long for higher
office. He is mentioned as a future candidate for Treasury
secretary, and is said by some to have designs on the Supreme
Court. Indeed, some Washington insiders say his tough stance
reflects his ambition as much as his conviction. "Everybody
who comes in wants to put on his or her brand," shrugs Mr.
Timmeny, a former SEC enforcement attorney. "The guy's just
trying to make his mark."</p>
<p>Mr. Breeden says his experience as Mr. Bush's point man on
the savings and loan crisis shaped his views on financial
crime. He believes inadequate federal oversight, shady
dealings and incompetent management almost destroyed that
industry.</p>
<p>So, when Mr. Breeden took over at the SEC last October,
one of his first moves was to create two task forces: One to
scrutinize public filings of banks and thrift institutions,
the other to bring cases against wrongdoers at those
institutions. He also enlarged his office, had additional
phone lines installed, and brought together market-watching
computers to create a "command center" for times of crisis.
He ordered key aides to wear beepers or carry cordless
phones.</p>
<p>At the commission table, he immediately started making
changes, too. His first demand: Violators must pay interest
on all illegal gains. "On virtually Day One, Case One, he
said: `Where is the interest?'" recalls Commissioner Edward
Fleischman. "Now it's not even something you think about
twice. It must be in there." If the government doesn't charge
interest, the chairman argues, it's essentially making
interest-free loans to crooks.</p>
<p>Mr. Breeden can be hard on his own people, too. One agency
official recounts a meeting at which the SEC staff didn't
have clear proof that a defendant truly needed the drawn-out
repayment schedule his lawyers had proposed. Mr. Breeden
glared at the staffers. "Woe to the next person who comes
before this commission with this kind of settlement," he
warned.</p>
<p>The staff is getting the message. Ms. Lawrence says
defendants have made settlement offers on about half the
litigation pending in the New York office. But the offers
have been rejected. "They aren't acceptable under the new
guidelines," she says.</p>
<p>One SEC lawyer describes a pending case in which a former
broker embezzled as much as $500,000 from customers. The
broker offered to settle by disgorging the amount. The agency
refused, insisting on collecting full interest and barring
the broker from the industry. "We didn't even bring the case
to the commission," the lawyer says. "It's clear to us that
there are certain components to settlements now."</p>
<p>The Chestman case notwithstanding, the SEC isn't having
much trouble winning when it goes to court. Mr. Newkirk, the
agency's chief litigator, estimates the SEC wins roughly
two-thirds of its trial cases.</p>
<p>That is partly because federal courts are turning the
screws on defendants by broadening securities laws. In 1987,
for example, the agency decided to make a test case out of
First City Financial Corp. and its vice president, Marc
Belzberg. First City had acquired more than 5% of the stock
of Ashland Oil Co., but waited 13 days longer than permitted
to file the required disclosure documents with the SEC.
During those 13 days, First City loaded up on additional
Ashland shares. It eventually sold the entire stake back to
Ashland for a hefty profit. The SEC sued the firm and Mr.
Belzberg, contending that they wouldn't have profited as much
if they had properly disclosed the stake.</p>
<p>For the first time in a disclosure case, the SEC sought
disgorgement of profit, a penalty previously imposed only for
egregious violations such as insider trading. "It was the
type of case we would have settled five years ago for no
money," Mr. Newkirk says.</p>
<p>The SEC won the case last year, forcing First City to give
up $2.7 million. "It has become a landmark case," Mr. Newkirk
says. Now, the SEC routinely forces firms and individuals who
settle to pay back funds gained from disclosure violations.</p>
<p>Then came the Milken case, the first big-league
enforcement test for the new chairman. He bruised more than a
few egos, nearly scuttled the settlement -- and wound up
winning a tougher set of terms than Mr. Milken had expected,
according to lawyers familiar with the case.</p>
<p>By the time the SEC got into the act, attorneys for Mr.
Milken already had agreed with Justice Department prosecutors
that, if Mr. Milken chose to plead guilty, it would be to six
felony counts. Still left undecided, among other things, was
the size of his fine.</p>
<p>Mr. Milken's attorneys were stunned by Mr. Breeden's
initial demands. He is understood to have asked that Mr.
Milken pay back nearly $1 billion. Mr. Milken's attorneys
threatened to break off negotiations. "There was no reason to
settle if he {Milken} could get the same deal by going to
trial," says one individual close to the Milken defense team.
The SEC, he says, "demanded total capitulation." Mr. Milken
ultimately settled for $600 million in fines and restitution.</p>
<p>Mr. Milken's lawyers had also sought assurances from
Justice Department prosecutors that they would recommend
concurrent five-year sentences for all the counts Mr. Milken
pleaded to. But SEC officials, led by Mr. Breeden, demanded
-- and received -- a promise that prosecutors wouldn't
recommend any specific sentence, leaving open the possibility
that Mr. Milken could receive consecutive, and hence longer,
sentences for his crimes.</p>
<p>In an interview, Mr. Breeden insists he wasn't intimately
involved in the Milken deliberations and that his enforcement
staff led the way. Nonetheless, sounding a refrain that's now
very familiar around the SEC, he added that the commission
had to be tough with Mr. Milken, that the punishment fit the
crime.</p>
<p>Consider, he says, the part of the guilty plea in which
Mr. Milken acknowledged cheating investors of Finsbury Fund
Ltd., a mutual fund, by falsely reporting the prices of
trades and pocketing the difference. "If someone walked into
a hotel where Finsbury shareholders were staying, pulled out
a machine gun and robbed them, everyone would regard that as
a serious event," he says. "I regard this as equally
serious."</p>
