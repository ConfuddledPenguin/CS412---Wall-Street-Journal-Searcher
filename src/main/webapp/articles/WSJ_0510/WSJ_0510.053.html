	<p class="article-leader">ORLANDO, Fla. -- After a bleak 1989, Eastman Kodak Co.
expects improved sales and earnings this year, and plans to
expand aggressively into Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union.
   The photographic, chemicals and pharmaceuticals concern
didn't offer a specific earnings forecast at its annual
meeting here. But company executives said they expect "higher
sales, better earnings and improved cash flow" in the latter
part of 1990, as benefits kick in from a recent cost-cutting
program.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Last year, Kodak's net income plunged 62% to $529 million,
or $1.63 a share, including an $875 million restructuring
charge. Kodak also was hurt by sharp earnings declines in its
information-systems business and other divisions. Sales
increased 8% to $18.3 billion.</p>
<p>In the first quarter, net fell 6% to $199 million, or 61
cents a share, which was a better result than analysts
expected. Sales fell to $4.11 billion from $4.21 billion.</p>
<p>While it hopes to improve earnings this year by boosting
film prices and cutting operating costs, Kodak is looking to
Eastern European markets for profit and revenue. The
Rochester, N.Y., company -- citing a "large, pent-up demand
for high-quality photographic products and services" in
Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union -- said it expects to
increase imaging sales there by 20% annually in coming years.</p>
<p>Currently, the company has a very small presence in those
markets. However, a joint venture established last year in
Hungary has been "extremely successful" in providing film and
processing services to consumers and professional
photographers, Kodak executives said.</p>
<p>A similar venture was launched six weeks ago in Poland,
and Kodak also is negotiating several joint ventures in the
Soviet Union for the sale of film, cameras and finishing
supplies.</p>
<p>Kodak hopes to avoid a mistake it made in Japan, where it
was relatively late with aggressive marketing. "We're getting
established well ahead of the competition," said William F.
Fowble, group vice president-photographic products.</p>
<p>Kodak also is counting on growth from several new
technologies, including hybrid products that combine film and
electronics.</p>
<p>Film-based products "will remain Kodak's major earnings
generator for years to come, but we're also ready for the
electronic age," said Kay R. Whitmore, president, who will
take over as chairman and chief executive officer on June 1.
The 57-year-old Mr. Whitmore was named in December to succeed
Colby H. Chandler, who is retiring at age 65.</p>
<p>Mr. Whitmore is expected to name a new president within 12
to 18 months.</p>
