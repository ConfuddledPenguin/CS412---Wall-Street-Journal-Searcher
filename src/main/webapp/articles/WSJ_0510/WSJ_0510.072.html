	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- For the first time, a select group of
corporate chief executive officers participated in the House
Ways and Means Committee's annual invitation-only weekend
retreat.
   This year's retreat, held at a North Carolina conference
center the weekend of April 20, was devoted to trade. All of
the chief executives who attended the privately funded
retreat, including James Robinson of American Express Co. and
Edmund Pratt of Pfizer Inc., have a vital stake in this
year's topic, the current Uruguay Round of trade
negotiations. The chief executives also have billions of
dollars riding on almost every tax and trade decision made by
the committee.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Not surprisingly, many of the corporate chieftains who
were hand-picked to participate are also contributors to
members of the panel, which has primary jurisdiction over
trade and taxes in the House. Political action committees
controlled by the companies whose chief executives attended
the retreat have given members of the panel $237,475 in
campaign contributions since 1983. A few of the individual
executives have also made personal contributions to the
tax-writers.</p>
<p>The exclusive, off-the-record conclave strikes some
critics as a glaring example of buying access. "It's
interesting in the climate of reform that the committee
continues with business as usual, with special access for
special interests," said Ellen Miller of the Center for
Responsive Government. "It's an affront to the American
public."</p>
<p>Each year since 1984, the committee has left Washington en
masse for the retreat. The annual excursion isn't viewed as a
junket for the tax-writing panel, but an occasion for the
committee to focus its attention on a policy issue away from
the din and distraction of the capital.</p>
<p>Invitations are precious -- not even spouses are invited.
The whereabouts and timing of the retreat are kept quiet. "We
tend to be lobbied by people who want to go," said an aide to
Chairman Dan Rostenkowski (D., Ill.). Usually the retreats
are top-heavy with academic and policy experts.</p>
<p>This year the chief executives dominated. Besides Messrs.
Robinson and Pratt, those invited included Prudential
Insurance Co. of America's Robert Winters; Minnesota Mining &
Manufacturing Co.'s Allen Jacobson; Unisys Corp. Chairman and
former Treasury Secretary Michael Blumenthal; Zenith
Electronics Corp.'s Jerry Pearlman; SmithKline Beecham
Corp.'s Henry Wendt; Air Products & Chemicals Inc.'s Dexter
Baker; and Gap Inc.'s Donald Fisher. Thomas Donahue,
secretary-treasurer of the AFL-CIO, also attended.</p>
<p>Committee members said political contributions had nothing
to do with who was invited. "It isn't as if we picked people
who gave a lot of money and no one else," said Rep. Sander
Levin (D., Mich.). "Their role in trade is so pronounced. I
don't think anyone could misunderstand it."</p>
<p>Mr. Pratt, for example, has been heavily involved in
intellectual property issues at stake in the Uruguay Round
and is chairman of the Business Roundtable, whose members
have a big stake in the negotiations. Mr. Robinson has been
highly visible on trade issues. Mr. Wendt is chairman of the
U.S.-Japan Business Council. "If you're dealing with trade,
you want to deal with people in the trade business," added
the Rostenkowski aide.</p>
<p>Besides the 20 or so committee members who made the trip,
there was a virtual who's who of the trade establishment,
including U.S. Trade Representative Carla Hills, her top
deputies, several ambassadors and former trade officials.</p>
<p>"Anyone in the business world would have given their
eyeteeth to be in that room," said one of the participants.</p>
<p>The Ford Foundation paid the Congressional Research
Service $200,000 to finance the retreat. The service, an arm
of the Library of Congress, wasn't involved in picking the
corporate participants, although it approved the committee's
choices, according to deputy director Bill Robinson, who
helped plan the retreat.</p>
<p>"The intent of the retreat isn't to provide a vehicle for
anyone to engage in lobbying or influence legislation," said
David Arnold of the Ford Foundation. "The CEOs were there
because of their particular expertise and not to peddle their
position or stake in the current round."</p>
<p>Participants say the off-the-record programs are important
policy-making tools. "It is very useful to meet in depth on
subjects across party lines," said Rep. Levin. According to
several participants, previous retreats on taxes led to
important legislative initiatives.</p>
<p>The committee didn't publicize the April retreat. But in
response to inquiries, the Congressional Research Service
provided a list of the guests, and committee aides disclosed
the agenda.</p>
<p>None of the corporate participants who could be reached
would discuss the retreat. "If we say anything," said a
spokesman for SmithKline Beecham, "we might not be invited
again next year."</p>
