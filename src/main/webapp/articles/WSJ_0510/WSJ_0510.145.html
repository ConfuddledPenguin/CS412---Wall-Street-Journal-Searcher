	<p class="article-leader">BEIJING -- Chinese industrial production picked up in
April after a stagnant first quarter, with a 6.8% increase in
output over March, the State Statistical Bureau announced
yesterday.
   Compared with April 1989, however, this April's output of
164.6 billion renmimbi ($34.87 billion) was up only 2%, the
official Xinhua News Agency quoted bureau officials as
saying.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Chinese industry is reeling from the impact of a
government austerity program that sharply cut official
spending, new construction and loans. More than 3 million
small rural factories shut down and numerous urban factories
either closed or sharply cut production.</p>
