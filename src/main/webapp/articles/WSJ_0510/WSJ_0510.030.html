	<p class="article-leader">TURBO RESOURCES Ltd. (Calgary, Alberta) -- V. Glenn
Sundstrom was appointed president and chief executive officer
of this financially ailing petroleum refining and marketing
concern, succeeding Robert G. Brodie, who resigned yesterday.
Mr. Sundstrom, a Turbo director since 1986, was previously a
marketing and refining executive with Calgary-based Petro
Canada Inc., a major integrated oil and gas concern. Mr.
Brodie, who also resigned from his post as chairman, is
returning to Vancouver to pursue certain business interests,
the company said; those interests weren't specified. Mr.
Brodie wasn't available to elaborate. Turbo said Andrew
Janisch, president and chief executive of Quintana
Exploration Canada Ltd., a small Calgary-based oil and gas
concern, succeeds Mr. Brodie as chairman.</p>
