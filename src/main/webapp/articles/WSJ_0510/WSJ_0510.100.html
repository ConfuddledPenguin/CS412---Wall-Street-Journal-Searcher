	<p class="article-leader">Dun & Bradstreet Corp. said a federal court ordered a
direct-marketing company and its principals to pay it
$876,225 in damages and attorney fees for copyright
infringement.
   Dun & Bradstreet, Parsippany, N.J., said Chief Judge
Barefoot Sanders, of the U.S. District Court in Dallas, ruled
that Southwest Data Processing Inc., Bedford, Texas,
infringed the copyright of Dun's Marketing Services, a unit
that licenses a data base containing information on nearly
nine million companies.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Dun's Marketing Services alleged in November that
Southwest Data and principals Walter H. Cushman and Rodney L.
Holloman were selling unauthorized copies of the data base.</p>
<p>Mr. Cushman denies any wrongdoing but said he can't afford
to appeal the judge's order. As a result of the legal fight,
Mr. Cushman said, Southwest Data "is in the process of filing
for bankruptcy."</p>
