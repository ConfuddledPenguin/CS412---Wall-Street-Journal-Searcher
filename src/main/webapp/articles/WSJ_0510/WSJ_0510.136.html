	<p class="article-leader">ROCHESTER, N.Y. -- FNB Rochester Corp. said Cukurova
Holding AS Group, a diversified Turkish concern, agreed to
buy 75% of FNB's common stock outstanding at $20 a share, for
a total of $29 million.
   FNB is the holding company for First National Bank of
Rochester and the small Atlanta (N.Y.) National Bank. FNB has
assets of nearly $300 million.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>In national over-the-counter trading yesterday, FNB's
stock closed at $13.50, up $2.25 a share. The stock had been
trading between $7 and $7.50 a share until FNB announced May
1 that it had received an unsolicited inquiry about a
purchase of the bank's stock. The book value is $8.60 a
share.</p>
<p>The agreement calls for redemption of FNB's $7.25 million
of 10% convertible capital notes at 110% of the principal
amount, and provides for an infusion of $10 million in new
capital.</p>
<p>Cukurova has interests in banking, insurance, steel,
cement, construction and international trade, FNB said. The
Turkish company is seeking a New York bank to handle
international transactions, partly because of plans for a
unified European market after 1992, said Wilbur F. Beh, FNB
president. He said a business broker employed by Cukurova
happened to know one of FNB's directors.</p>
<p>First National Bank of Rochester, which has offices in
Rochester, Syracuse and Elmira, may open an office in New
York City following completion of the transaction, Mr. Beh
said. He said other European concerns also may seek banking
outlets in the U.S. in preparation for the 1992 changes,
which probably will increase trade between Europe and the
U.S. as well as among European countries.</p>
<p>The agreement is subject to negotiation of a definitive
agreement within 30 days and to approval by FNB shareholders
and bank regulators, the company said. Cukurova would
purchase the 75% interest through a tender offer, Mr. Beh
said.</p>
<p>Under the preliminary agreement, present management and
directors would continue, FNB said. The additional capital
would allow the banking concern to continue its growth, Mr.
Beh said. He said the bank hasn't had nonperforming loan
problems comparable to some other banks, partly because it
hasn't reached outside its service area for business.</p>
