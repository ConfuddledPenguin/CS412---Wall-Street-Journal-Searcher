	<p class="article-leader">Your April 5 page-one article about W. Graham Claytor's
"discipline" in revitalizing Amtrak has this frustrated
former passenger in a state of apoplectic rage. When my
husband and I purchased our home in Valparaiso, Ind., 48
miles southeast of Chicago, one of the selling points was its
proximity to the Amtrak station, where we could catch the
train to our jobs in Chicago's Loop.
   We have since learned that this service, with a 65%
on-time record, nearly daily equipment failures and only one
remaining scheduled departure to the Loop (6:10 a.m.), is to
be discontinued in September. This despite the fact that 400
people ride or drive from Valparaiso alone to work in the
Loop every day, and there are as many as 85,000 rail
commuters from Northwest Indiana per year -- an average of
326 per workday.</p>
