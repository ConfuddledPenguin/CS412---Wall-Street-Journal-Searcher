	<p class="article-leader">Players International Inc. is cashing in on gambling
without the help of dice, cards or slot machines.
   The small company's five-year-old Players Club, endorsed
on late-night cable television by the actor Telly Savalas,
promises medium-stakes gamblers a taste of the red-carpet
treatment that casinos usually reserve for high rollers.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Most people love a bargain, and Players promises discounts
on casino hotel rooms, food and shows, along with other
perks, in such gambling meccas as Las Vegas, Atlantic City,
N.J., and the Bahamas. Some joiners say it doesn't pay. But
the club says many members recoup the $125-a-year membership
fee in a single outing, saving 25% to 60% on air fare,
lodging, food and entertainment.</p>
<p>Like many new companies, Players aims to capitalize on an
opening left by larger ones. Casinos work hard to bring in
busloads of penny-pinching slot-machine players and to
attract $40,000-a-hand baccarat aficionados and other high
rollers. Players Club is aimed at millions of so-called
middle-market gamblers, who it says are often overlooked by
casino marketing programs. Casinos say the middle market is
so diverse that such gamblers are harder to target.</p>
<p>In return for steering customers to casinos, Players gets
discount rates on blocks of rooms reserved for its members.
The firm spends $6 million to $7 million annually on ads and
marketing, mostly aimed at attracting new members.</p>
<p>Players Club has expanded to 90,000 members; it says about
5,500 people join each month. Players International says it
expects to report revenue of more than $16 million for the
fiscal year ended March 31, up from $12 million a year
earlier. Besides running the club, the company's activities
include promoting gambling cruises and other travel for
gamblers and arranging casino promotions.</p>
<p>But Players still has problems. With membership swelling,
each member faces more competition to get one of the rooms
reserved for the club. Thus, more members are likely to be
disappointed -- which hardly sits well with those who signed
up to be coddled. But the main reason about 40% of Players'
members fail to renew is because they don't use them enough.</p>
<p>In any case, some industry observers question how well
Players will weather the next economic slowdown or industry
downturn. (It was launched during the biggest casino-industry
boom ever.) Discretionary leisure spending is one of the
first cuts made by consumers in tight times. That could mean
trouble for Players, which depends heavily on membership
renewals.</p>
<p>At first, the club paid off for Bernard Szynaka, an
engineer from St. James, N.Y., who visited casinos several
times a year. The $29-a-night cost of staying at the Aladdin
in Las Vegas was "like giving it away," he says. He canceled
his membership last month, saying he doesn't plan to gamble
again soon. But he adds that Players' promotions "aren't
quite as good as they were." Lately, he had found new
restrictions, "like no Saturday check-in."</p>
<p>The company says such cases are the exception and that it
actually has expanded the club's benefits.</p>
<p>Blaine Warner of York, Pa., a retired 61-year-old former
night-club owner who goes to Atlantic City three times a
month and Las Vegas at least once a year, says, "For me, it's
a good deal because I'm there all the time."</p>
<p>Some members have complained to local and state
authorities, saying the club doesn't deliver what's promised.
Players says it responds to complaints and none has resulted
in any action against it.</p>
<p>The club is run from Calabasas, Calif., a Los Angeles
suburb. Edward and David Fishman, the brothers who founded
Players, formerly produced TV game shows. The Fishmans and
other directors own about 53% of the company, which went
public in 1985 by purchasing a public shell corporation.</p>
<p>"We've got a very specialized niche," says David Fishman.
"Our customers are the ones who usually pay full price for
everything." The average member, according to Players, is
married, 45 to 60 years old, with income of $52,000 and a
per-trip betting bankroll of $1,300.</p>
<p>Saving a buck isn't the only appeal. "People want to be
recognized," Mr. Fishman adds.</p>
<p>After a rocky start -- the club attracted only 12,000
members the first year -- Players thinks it has hit a hot
streak. It turned its first profit -- of $509,000, or seven
cents a share, in fiscal 1989, compared with a loss of
$295,600, or four cents a share, a year earlier.</p>
<p>Players actually bombed in its first direct mailing. "Our
biggest problem was credibility," says Stanley Harfenist,
Players International president. But, after Mr. Savalas --
who is widely perceived as street-smart -- was recruited as
spokesman, members began signing up.</p>
<p>Although Players found a niche, it is hardly without
indirect competition. "Players Club is one part of a whole
movement toward sophisticated player marketing, and it's
something a lot of casinos are doing very well," says Daniel
R. Lee, an analyst with First Boston Co.</p>
<p>Some new casino programs are working with Players Club to
attract middle-market gamblers. Such casinos know that
Players has a data base of roughly three million names.
Harrah's Marina casino in Atlantic City, however, is dropping
its contract with Players, saying it can't spare the extra
rooms that the club wants in peak periods.</p>
<p>Still, Players has more names than members. Then there are
people who never even join; many think they can make better
arrangements themselves.</p>
<p>Now, though, Players says its biggest worries are about
accommodating members. Says David Fishman, "I'm not lying
awake at night anymore thinking, `Are we going to make it?'"</p>
