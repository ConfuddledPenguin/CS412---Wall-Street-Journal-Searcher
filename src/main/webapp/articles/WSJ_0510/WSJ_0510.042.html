	<p class="article-leader">A new Howard County, Md., law requiring all bicycle riders
to wear helmets could spark other communities to jump aboard
with their own rules.
   "I suspect, unfortunately, that {the Howard law} will have
a national impact. The proponents are seeking to get a lot of
momentum . . . to get various communities across the country
to take similar action," says Michael Kershow, a spokesman
for the Bicycle Manufacturers Association of America. The
trade group fears that requiring helmets could discourage
bicycling.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Supporters of the helmets say the action gives a
significant boost to improving biking safety nationwide.
"With one county doing it, you might have another, then
another until it snowballs," says New York State Assemblyman
Henry Barnett, who wants safety headgear required for all
cyclists.</p>
<p>New York and California already require helmets for young
children riding in bike carriers, and some other states are
considering adopting that rule. But the Howard County law,
passed Monday by the county council, is a groundbreaker
because it requires helmet use by all bicyclists of any age.</p>
<p>More than 1,000 bikers die in accidents each year, most
because of head injuries. "Head injuries are very, very
nasty," says Andrew Dannenberg, a doctor with the Johns
Hopkins Injury Prevention Center in Baltimore. "If they don't
kill you, they can leave you permanently incapacitated,
unable to read well, think well or take care of yourself. A
broken arm will heal, but head injuries often don't."</p>
<p>A study by the Harborview Injury Prevention and Research
Center in Seattle showed that wearing a bicycle helmet
reduced the risk of head injury by 85%. Nevertheless, fewer
than 5% of the estimated 90 million bicyclists in the U.S.
currently use helmets.</p>
<p>And only 1% of children under 15 wear cycling helmets,
according to Bell Helmets Inc., the nation's largest
manufacturer of bike helmets.</p>
<p>In the face of such data, everyone involved in the issue
agrees wearing helmets is a good idea; the fight is over
whether the government should require it.</p>
<p>Howard County Councilman Charles Feaga, who pushed the new
law, says that the legislation is good public policy because
it will save lives and money. "The public currently picks up
an awful lot of the expense of people who experience brain
traumas in accidents," he says. Dr. Dannenberg favors federal
action; he wants the Consumer Product Safety Commission to
require that the price of a bike include a helmet.</p>
<p>But opponents say such measures would drive some people
away from biking because of the added cost; helmets generally
cost between $25 and $90. "Some people won't buy helmets and
will just say, the heck with it, I won't go biking," says
James Fremont, education director for the Bicycle Federation
of America.</p>
<p>Mr. Kershow, the bike manufacturers' association
spokesman, says sales to lower-income families, in
particular, would be hurt. "These families might not have the
disposable income to spend an additional 20% to 40%," he
says. Besides, he contends, enforcing mandatory helmet use
would be difficult and simply create resentment toward the
police.</p>
<p>But supporters of the Howard County measure say that
mandating bike helmets isn't any different from requiring the
use of car seatbelts and child safety seats.</p>
<p>Some parents are apparently responding to warnings about
the dangers of cycling without headgear. In Seattle, helmet
use by children under 12 has risen to 24% from 1% in the past
three years because of an aggressive public-education
campaign by Harborview.</p>
<p>Nationwide, helmet sales are expected to rise this year to
as many as four million from the three million sold last
year, according to Bell.</p>
<p>In Howard County, the issue hit home after three young
people were killed in recent years in bicycling accidents.
One, Christopher Kelley, had attended Glenwood Middle School,
where students, in response to his death, asked Mr. Feaga to
take steps to make bicycling safer.</p>
<p>The ultimate result was the legislation approved earlier
this week. The new law says that all bicycle riders using
county roads must wear helmets or face possible fines of up
to $50 for a first offense and up to $100 for a second
offense. Mr. Feaga says much of the credit goes to the
students, who provided valuable research on how many students
had bicycles and whether they used helmets. "They were
instrumental," he says.</p>
