	<p class="article-leader">Deutsche Bank AG said it will set up a joint venture with
the Gerling insurance group to provide life-insurance
products to corporate clients.
   In response to a question, a spokesman for West Germany's
largest bank said Deutsche Bank will hold 70% of the new
company, while Gerling, a closely held West German insurance
group, will take 30%. The new company will specifically serve
small and midsize companies that want to offer life policies
to employees as part of their compensation package.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Gerling is the only major German insurer cooperating with
Deutsche Bank's insurance ventures. Most other groups,
especially market leader Allianz AG, opposed Deutsche Bank's
entry into life insurance from the start.</p>
