	<p class="article-leader">Brent Walker Group PLC, a British leisure concern, said
1989 pretax profit leaped 97%, helped by large gains in
earnings from all divisions.
   Pretax profit for the year was #82.2 million ($137.3
million), up from #41.7 million a year ago. Sales more than
quadrupled to #526 million. Earnings per share more than
doubled to 88.7 pence from 41.1 pence a year ago. The surge
in earnings partly reflects the company's purchase in October
of William Hill Organization and Mecca Bookmakers Ltd. from
Grand Metropolitan PLC for #685 million.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>However, the company reported an increase in interest
payments to #40 million from #5.4 million in the year-earlier
period as a result of its buying spree. Nonetheless, Brent
Walker Chairman George Walker said the company's broad base
of activities gave investors protection during an economic
downturn.</p>
<p>The company said a "substantial proportion" of its
business is in pubs, brewing and betting activities, and
these areas have shown "a strong resistance to reductions in
consumer demand."</p>
