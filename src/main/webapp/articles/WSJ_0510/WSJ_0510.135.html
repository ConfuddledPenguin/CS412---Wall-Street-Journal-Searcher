	<p class="article-leader">Niagara Exchange Corp. said Riedman Corp. is seeking to
set aside its recent sale of convertible preferred to W.R.
Berkley Corp. for about $8.2 million, or to permanently
enjoin the voting rights of that preferred stock.
   Riedman, a Rochester, N.Y., insurance agency that
currently owns about 14% of Niagara's 1.8 million common
shares outstanding, launched a proxy vote to seek two of the
company's seven board seats. W.R. Berkley's 970,000 shares of
Niagara's convertible preferred represent a 35% stake.
Niagara, Buffalo, N.Y., and W.R. Berkley, Greenwich, Conn.,
are property-casualty insurance holding companies.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Riedman, in a lawsuit filed in Delaware Court of Chancery,
is claiming that Niagara's sale of the preferred stock, which
is still subject to regulatory approval, has blocked its
proxy fight.</p>
<p>Niagara said the allegations in the complaint are without
merit.</p>
