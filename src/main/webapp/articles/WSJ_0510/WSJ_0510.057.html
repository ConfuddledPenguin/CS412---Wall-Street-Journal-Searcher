	<p class="article-leader">Most chief executives start pointing fingers when their
companies stumble.
   Telxon Corp.'s chief executive did the opposite: He made
himself the fall guy.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>At the company's annual meeting last fall, Raymond D. Meyo
pledged that he'd quit if Telxon's performance didn't improve
within a year. At that point, the maker of hand-held
computers had negative cash flow and no order backlog.
Inventories and accounts receivable had balooned, and efforts
to market bigger computer systems had stalled.</p>
<p>Now, seven months later, the 46-year-old executive
contends his novel approach is helping to put the Akron,
Ohio, company back on track. Although Telxon will show a loss
for the year ended March 31, Mr. Meyo says a rebound is
occurring in the current quarter and he expects to be
vindicated through a return to profitability in the current
fiscal year.</p>
<p>Even assuming he is vindicated, should chief executives
make such a vow, especially in public? Most management
experts say no, believing that the pitfalls far outweigh any
morale benefits that might result. While none can recall a
case where an executive made a similar promise, they believe
such a move is likely to become a self-fulfilling prophecy.</p>
<p>It's just not done, says Warren Bennis, a professor at the
University of Southern California and a leadership and
motivation consultant, who believes Mr. Meyo's promise is
"ridiculous." An executive who puts his job on the line
usually is foolhardy because it invites outsiders to judge
his performance. Other consultants agree, saying that
onlookers are hungry for blood and may be eager to see a
person fall.</p>
<p>Mr. Meyo, the son of a coal miner, defends himself,
contending the company needed something drastic, and that he
wanted to set a tone of boldness. "We want to remain an
entrepreneurial company, with people who take risks and are
willing to fail," Mr. Meyo says. "If employees see that
you're not going to buckle, they get confidence."</p>
<p>Jeffrey Sonnenfeld, director of the Center for Leadership
and Career Change at Emory University, concedes there's some
truth in that. "When things are bad and a CEO makes himself
the target, he achieves heroic stature which encourages
others to take risks," Mr. Sonnenfeld says. But, he adds,
what's intended to be a bold move aimed at inspiring
employees can easily be misinterpreted as the final act of a
desperate leader, or a signal that he's about to be fired.
The ultimatum can jolt an already unstable company into a
death spiral.</p>
<p>"It's like a parent saying, `If you don't behave, I'll
commit suicide,'" says Harry Levinson, a Cambridge, Mass.,
psychologist and management consultant. Such a maneuver is an
attempt to manipulate employees' guilt, he says, and may
cause some to become resentful or angry.</p>
<p>Mr. Meyo readily agrees that the move made him the focus
of heavy scrutiny and subjected him to a lot of pressure.
He's been exposed to increased grilling by analysts, the
media and others who suddenly saw him as the cause of all of
Telxon's problems. "Sometimes it's easier to solve things
internally," he says. Moreover, Mr. Meyo -- who acknowledges
he tended to direct the business with a heavy hand -- had to
deal with employees rooting for him to fall flat on his face.</p>
<p>Mr. Meyo, an outgoing, driven man who often works 70-hour
weeks, isn't sure why he decided to publicly take the flak
for the company's problems. In fact, he says his announcement
at the annual meeting was largely impulsive; he'd intended to
tell only a few analysts of his decision. Even after he went
public with the pledge, he didn't think he had said anything
profound until several shareholders and board members asked
whether it was wise to "paint himself into a corner."</p>
<p>But Mr. Meyo says he knew he had to light a fire -- under
himself and others. There were tell-tale signs that his top
lieutenants weren't managing well or were subtly working
against him. "Some of them were in over their heads, some
weren't psychologically committed to Telxon, and some didn't
believe they could give their heart and soul to Telxon as
long as Ray Meyo was there," the executive says.</p>
<p>Shouldering responsibility for the company's direction
didn't keep him from harshly judging others. All four of the
company's vice presidents and its chief financial officer
were replaced. While a few of those five officials were
shuffled to new positions, others were among the 110
employees, or roughly 9% of the company's work force, that
Mr. Meyo has fired since last fall. "I've grieved over the
layoffs," he says.</p>
<p>Based on the proxy statement for fiscal 1989, the latest
available, Mr. Meyo's financial stake in the company isn't
anything out of the ordinary. He or members of his family
owned just 1.5% of Telxon. He earned $225,000 in salary and
$150,000 in bonuses for the year.</p>
<p>Of course, a chief executive is ultimately in charge of a
company and therefore isn't without blame, as Mr. Meyo
learned. He brought in a management-consulting firm, which
confronted him with a troubling revelation: that Mr. Meyo
was, in fact, central to some of Telxon's problems. The
consummate salesman ever since he and chairman Robert Myerson
saved the company from bankruptcy in 1978, Mr. Meyo had
focused solely on what he knew best. And the company's sales
successes blinded him to any festering problems. Through the
nine years ended in fiscal 1988, Telxon's revenues grew at a
hearty compounded annual rate of nearly 30%. But in the past
year or so, as the company began moving away from selling
hand-held computers that read bar codes to expanded systems
and sophisticated software, "we lost our focus," Mr. Meyo
says. "We got sloppy."</p>
<p>Orders were being rushed through, often at steep
discounts, before profit margins and forecasts were hashed
out. Inventories piled up as Mr. Meyo emphasized customer
satisfaction over focusing on particular markets. "We tried
to be everything to everybody," he says.</p>
<p>Now, Telxon's four separate sales forces have been melded
into one. Sales commissions are tied to profits rather than
overall dollars. And the company has built up a backlog of
orders in hand-held computers as well as its newer products.
Mr. Meyo won't disclose specific numbers, but says Telxon
will be profitable in each quarter of fiscal 1991.</p>
<p>Mr. Meyo hasn't changed his strenuous work schedule, but
he's delegating more. "I had molded the company, and managers
were relying on me too much," he says, concluding that his
hands-on style was no longer working. "I've loosened
controls."</p>
<p>"He is learning that he has to put quality people in every
job and let them do their jobs," says Julie Ganim, the new
vice president of corporate development.</p>
<p>Mr. Meyo has set high goals for himself before. As a young
boy, he suffered from a speech defect so severe that only his
mother could understand him. To overcome the problem, he
practiced speaking in front of a mirror for hours on end and
vowed that one day he would earn his living as a salesman.
"My father said I've always enjoyed life the best under
pressure and I guess he's right."</p>
