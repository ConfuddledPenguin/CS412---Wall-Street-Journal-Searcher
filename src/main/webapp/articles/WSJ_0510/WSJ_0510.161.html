	<p class="article-leader">SOUTH KOREANS CLASHED with police in widespread
anti-government protests.
   Tens of thousands of students and dissidents, chanting
slogans against government intervention in labor strikes,
battled police in more than a dozen cities and demanded the
ouster of President Roh. More than 900 people were arrested.
In Seoul, protesters set fire to a U.S. cultural center and
hurled rocks and firebombs in what were considered the most
violent demonstrations there since 1987.</p>

deal is in jeopardy over Seoul's demands for the U.S. to

<p>THE U.S. AND IRAN REACHED a tentative agreement on
financial disputes.</p>
<p>The State Department said negotiators for both countries
agreed to settle 2,340 claims pending against Tehran since
the 1979 Islamic revolution for $105 million, as well as to
resolve 108 Iranian claims against Washington, U.S. companies
and individuals for $400,000. The agreement still must be
signed and ratified. Still outstanding are Iranian claims for
U.S. military equipment, which Tehran estimates at $11
billion.</p>
<p>Both sides denied there was a link between the claims and
the freeing of hostages in Lebanon, and they said the pact
wouldn't lead to better economic ties.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>Albania's legislature approved proposals for changes in
the hard-line Communist state's human-rights policy, giving
individuals more legal powers and changing the definition of
crimes against the state. The Tirana government also said it
would allow freer travel for its citizens, a crucial
condition for joining East-West security talks.</p>

<p>Business executives participated for the first time in the
House Ways and Means Committee's annual, invitation-only
weekend retreat, which was held last month in North Carolina.
All of the CEOs have a stake in current trade talks, and have
billions of dollars riding on the panel's tax and trade
decisions.</p>

<p>The Senate Ethics Committee expanded its case against GOP
Sen. Durenberger of Minnesota, and will examine a new charge
that he violated ethics law on blind trusts. The panel also
said it had found "substantial credible evidence" that
Durenberger may have "abused" his Senate office. Hearings are
to begin June 12.</p>

<p>The Soviet military paraded in Moscow's Red Square to mark
the World War II defeat of Nazi Germany. Defense Minister
Yazov said changes within the military were under way, and he
criticized nationalism in the Baltic republics, where
scattered protests were reported as parades were held against
the wishes of most local officials.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>NATO defense ministers opened a two-day meeting in Canada
to review nuclear strategy amid the political changes in
Eastern Europe. The ministers agreed that nuclear artillery
shells in Western Europe should be withdrawn, but left open
the question of whether there should be negotiations with the
Soviet Union on the issue.</p>
<p>The U.S. is preparing its allies against expecting even an
agreement in principle on cutting long-range arms at the
Bush-Gorbachev summit starting May 30. Meanwhile, Bush,
apparently eager for a summit arms pact, is offering to halt
U.S. production of chemical weapons if Moscow agrees on a
schedule to destroy existing stockpiles.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>Luxembourg announced that its envoy to NATO resigned
following allegations by the CIA that he passed "some sort of
security information" to the Soviet Union. The country's
foreign minister didn't elaborate, and a NATO spokesman in
Brussels said he didn't know the severity of the security
breach.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>The White House is opposed to providing new funds to help
developing nations reduce the use of ozone-depleting
chemicals. A spokesman said the U.S. believes "financial
mechanisms established by the World Bank" should be used for
the project.</p>

<p>Two preliminary studies concluded that the experimental
drug DDI lowers virus levels and enhances immune cells in
patients with AIDS and AIDS-related complex. The studies also
found that the Bristol-Myers Squibb compound can cause nerve
and pancreas damage, but only in dosages considered too high.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>The USS Conyngham docked at the Norfolk Naval Station in
Virginia as the Navy began investigating Tuesday's fire
aboard the 27-year-old guided-missile destroyer. One crewman
was killed. The commander of a ship that helped fight the
Conyngham blaze said it was "a major league fire" that could
have destroyed the warship.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>Rival Christian forces escalated their battle for control
of a strategic stretch of coastline north of Beirut, killing
at least 20 people in artillery duels, authorities said. The
barrages came after Gen. Aoun threatened to attack ships
using ports controlled by the rival Lebanese Forces militia.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>Burma's military rulers have arrested officials of the
country's main opposition party, disrupting campaigning for
this month's multiparty elections, Rangoon-based diplomats
said. The army, which has governed Burma since crushing
pro-democracy demonstrations 18 months ago, had promised free
and fair elections May 27.</p>
