	<p class="article-leader">A new navigation system made by Pioneer Electronic Corp.
of Japan uses satellites to calculate a vehicle's location
and then displays it to the driver on maps on a small color
screen.
   The system, which goes on sale in Japan next month,
connects to a vehicle's audio system and uses special compact
disks to display maps of any part of Japan, Pioneer spokesman
Toru Yokomizo said.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>He said it is the first satellite navigation system for
cars available as an accessory on the retail market.</p>
<p>The device, named AVIC-1, can be used by cars, trucks or
helicopters while in motion or standing still, Mr. Yokomizo
said.</p>
<p>The complete system, including navigation device, display,
antenna and audio system, will cost about 500,000 yen
($3,200), he said.</p>
