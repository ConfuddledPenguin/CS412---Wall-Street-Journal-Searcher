	<p class="article-leader">SAO PAULO, Brazil -- When Fernando Collor de Mello took
office in March, he said he had "only one shot" to halt
Brazil's hyperinflation. But instead of firing a bullet, the
new president dropped a bomb.
   "The monetary contraction we imposed on society is
fantastic," acknowledges Ibrahim Eris, one of the architects
of the harsh anti-inflation plan and now the president of the
central bank. "It's probably the first time in the world that
a country in time of peace has practically destroyed its
monetary standard and replaced it."</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Under the plan, Mr. Collor didn't just restrict credit or
cut spending, as other governments here have done. He froze
about 70% of the money circulating in the economy for 18
months, until the fall of next year, and also replaced the
old currency, the cruzado novo, with a new, strictly
controlled one, the cruzeiro. If money causes inflation, the
thinking goes, then removing money removes inflation.</p>
<p>The results have come faster than it takes to say
hyperinflation. Inflation, which reached 84.32% in March
alone and totaled 4,854% in the 12 months through March,
halted completely -- in fact, prices fell -- in the month
following the unveiling of the plan, the government says.
(However, some trade unions and economists disagree, charging
that the index is based on an incomplete basket of goods.)</p>
<p>But in stopping inflation, the government has also stopped
the economy. "To kill the cockroach, they set the apartment
on fire," complains former Economic Planning Minister Antonio
Delfim Netto.</p>
<p>Deprived of cash, consumers stopped buying, companies
stopped producing and exporters stopped exporting. Then,
afraid that it had paralyzed the country, the government
started re-injecting money into the system to the point that
some feared a revival of inflation, and the government closed
the tap again. Although the government terms all this as only
a short, predictable phase and says economic activity is
picking up again, many economists and businessmen think that
Brazil has simply traded inflation for recession -- and could
end up with both if the government errs in its efforts to
revive the economy.</p>
<p>Almost overnight, with the drop in inflation -- and in
bank accounts -- the habits of Brazil's nearly 150 million
people have changed. Companies that had cash in the bank
suddenly have to beg for loans at exorbitant interest rates
just to meet their payrolls. People who wouldn't have been
caught dead with cash in their pockets because inflation was
shrinking its value by the minute rushed to the bank to
withdraw all the money they could to stash it under
mattresses. And all of a sudden, the rich were poorer, and
the poor felt richer.</p>
<p>Antonio Ermirio de Moraes, the extremely wealthy chief of
Grupo Votorantim, Brazil's largest private industrial group,
declared on television that he was stuck with little money
for himself and had to get a bank loan to pay his group's
60,000 employees after $500 million of its reserves were
frozen. So depressed was the workaholic Mr. Ermirio that he
took a swim in his pool for the first time in 36 years of
marriage, his wife says.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Claudio Teller de Silva, a 23-year-old who lost
his truck-driving job, says he can buy a used Volkswagen
Beetle with the unemployment benefits he will get. "If I'd
been fired in a time of high inflation, I couldn't have done
that," he says as he waits in line at an unemployment office
in Sao Paulo.</p>
<p>The drastic liquidity squeeze, the government says, was
designed just that way. "Our directive was to liquidate
inflation fast without the working class footing most of the
bill," says Economics Minister Zelia Cardoso de Mello. To
make the well-heeled do the sacrificing, the government froze
funds in savings accounts in excess of 50,000 cruzados novos
(about $1,000 at the official rate). It also froze all funds
above 25,000 cruzados novos or 20% of total funds --
whichever was higher -- in short-term, interest-bearing
instruments.</p>
<p>These limits and the rest of the plan were set in a series
of secret meetings of a small team of economists after Mr.
Collor's mid-December election. Examining Brazil's three
failed anti-inflation plans since 1986, as well as similar
plans in countries such as Argentina, Bolivia and Israel, "we
came to the conclusion that the core problem was the
explosion of demand" that accompanied more traditional policy
instruments such as wage-and-price freezes coupled with
credit restrictions, Mr. Eris says. So, by late January, the
team decided it had to reduce the amount of money in the
economy.</p>
<p>"We took the plan to the president practically as it
stands today but without details," Mr. Eris says. "We held a
meeting with a blackboard and all that, and the president
accepted all our arguments in favor of a freeze of assets. He
was quickly convinced we had no alternative." But he adds:
"After we decided, we were extremely nervous . . . worried
about the consequences of our decisions."</p>
<p>Rightly so, many now say, even if they think that the plan
makes sense theoretically and gives Brazil a salutary shock.
"At a macroeconomic level, the plan is fine," says Roberto
Civita, the president of Editora Abril, Latin America's
largest publishing group. "But guess what the sum of
everybody cutting here and canceling there is? The way it
looks from here is a big recession."</p>
<p>Mr. Civita knows first-hand about cutting here and
canceling there. "We have cut all the costs we could imagine
except toilet paper and people," he says. The publisher of
about 150 magazines, including the respected newsweekly Veja,
Mr. Civita says newsstand sales have dropped about one-third,
although subscriptions have picked up slightly, and
advertising has fallen 50% since the plan was enacted. The
decline in revenue has forced Abril to put off its planned
August launch of MTV. "The tower was going up, the building
was being put up, people were being hired -- and we told the
construction company: `Stop]'" Mr. Civita says.</p>
<p>In addition, Abril has cut its auto fleet by 60%,
suspended the publication of special issues and stopped
lunches with clients, all purchases of nonessential goods and
corporate travel. "Nobody's going anywhere," Mr. Civita says.
Because Abril had adopted a strategy of having no cash on
hand by March 15, none of its money was frozen. But cash flow
stopped. "We've thrown out the profit-and-loss statement,"
Mr. Civita says. Now, "we're thinking only of cash flow" to
pay bills and salaries. To meet the April payroll, Abril had
to take out a bank loan at almost 30% interest, and "May will
be even worse," Mr. Civita predicts. At one printing plant,
the workweek has been cut by a day with a matching pay cut,
and the group may adopt such tactics across the board.</p>
<p>The problems are even worse for small companies, such as
Jacques Memran's wire maker near Sao Paulo. The company,
which employs 30 people and mostly makes wire spirals for
notebooks, is "completely stopped" and its employees are on
paid leave, Mr. Memran says. "I haven't fired anyone yet, but
how long can this last?" he asks. Paper companies "aren't
making any orders. They're trying to make cruzeiros by
selling inventory to be able to make new orders. It's a
vicious circle," he says.</p>
<p>Mr. Memran voted for Mr. Collor but describes the plan as
"a bad surprise." He is particularly incensed at the freezing
of 800,000 cruzados novos that the company had put in the
overnight market -- a sort of one-day government bond in
which many Brazilians invested to hedge against inflation.
"The money we had wasn't to speculate," he says. "It was to
be able to meet our next payroll. In times of high inflation,
we were obliged to invest our money on the market to preserve
its value. Taking our money is a real aggression. Not only
did Collor take our savings, but he also took our working
capital." Mr. Memran adds that if the Collor plan "continues
like this, only the big will survive. And the big aren't
going to absorb all the people we're going to put out on the
street."</p>
<p>Indeed, many Brazilians believe that although Mr. Collor
said he wanted to spare the poor, the poor in fact will pay
the biggest price in the medium term if the incipient
recession sparks mass unemployment. The middle classes are
already feeling the pinch. "Collor said the plan would affect
the elite and help the `descamisados'" -- the shirtless
people. "We're discovering we were the elite, and now we're
the shirtless," says Luiz Carlos Mansur, a 27-year-old copy
editor in the sports department of Jornal do Brasil in Rio de
Janeiro.</p>
<p>With advertising low, the newspaper is paying salaries in
installments as money flows in, and staffers are never sure
of getting their full pay. Mr. Mansur's wife, Teresa, who
gives private classes in Portuguese and French, recently lost
two of her five students. And since the plan was enacted, the
Mansurs have had to tighten their belts. They rarely go out
to eat. They've stopped buying books and clothes. They've
fired their maid. Now, they're considering moving back to
live with Mrs. Mansur's mother.</p>
<p>"Every day you wake up, and you don't know what will
happen," Mr. Mansur says. "You can lose your money, your job,
part of your salary." Adds his wife: "I'd think the plan was
good if I had the same amount as money as before and no
inflation. But to know that prices aren't rising when you
can't buy anything isn't very satisfying."</p>
<p>Others say the plan, though harsh, may yield something
satisfying: the notion that Brazil will finally get its act
together.</p>
<p>"Unemployment and recession are a price we have to pay to
stop the casino economy we lived in, where the poor got
poorer and the rich got richer," says Sergio Haberfeld, the
chairman of Toga, a packaging company whose production has
fallen about 25% since the plan was announced. "People made
profits on inflation and on their cash surplus. Now, it will
be profit on efficiency and productivity."</p>
<p>For that to happen, however, the government will have to
match the sacrifices of the private sector, economists say.
The paradox of the plan is that although Mr. Collor was
elected on a free-market platform and vowed to reduce the
state's role, the plan's initial phase concentrates so much
power in his hands that Lawrence Pih, a businessman, speaks
of the "Popular Republic of Brazil."</p>
<p>Economists are waiting to see how the government will
handle the ban on most government subsidies, the closure of
several state agencies, and the planned sale to the private
sector of most of Brazil's state-owned companies and of many
government houses and cars. Many say that if the government
wants permanently low inflation, it has to attack the
public-sector deficit through tougher spending cuts than it
has enacted so far. "About 10,000 people losing their jobs in
the public sector is very little compared to what we're
already seeing in the informal economy and what we'll see in
the financial, auto and construction sectors," says Carlos
Langoni, a former central-bank president.</p>
<p>Meeting with cabinet members and government congressional
leaders yesterday, Mr. Collor exhorted them to move faster on
privatization and cut 20% to 25% of Brazil's 1.6 million
government workers.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the government's efforts to re-inject money
into the most affected sectors, such as the automobile,
construction and capital-goods industries, have to be
carefully calibrated to reignite business activity without
reigniting inflation. That will be all the harder because the
plan has disorganized the country's financial system and
destroyed confidence in savings -- a problem that government
officials admit they underestimated. Since the plan was
announced, the government has kept on printing money to
satisfy people's demand for cash, and that, in turn, could
trigger a paradoxical consumer boom in the midst of an
economic downturn.</p>
<p>"We're walking on a very narrow road," the central bank's
Mr. Eris concedes. "On one side is the precipice of
recession; on the other is inflation. Today, society thinks
we're walking close to recession, but the road is so narrow
we could fall the other way. Our problem today is trying to
administer this so we don't fall on either side."</p>
<p>Mr. Eris also admits that the plan "has implications that
aren't clear. Talk of recession or depression and talk of an
explosion of demand prove the economy hasn't found its
equilibrium." Inflation, he says, "has been knocked down, and
the judge has counted to three. When he says 10, we'll be in
another world." But both he and Economics Minister Cardoso
are confident of steering the economy through the twin perils
of inflation and recession.</p>
<p>If they succeed, economists say, they will have laid the
foundations to allow Brazil, at long last, to live up to its
huge potential. If they fail, Brazil will have "exhausted the
economic encyclopedia" of ways to cure inflation, Mr. Langoni
says. The results, all agree, won't be clear for at least
another couple of months.</p>
<p>"We're going to have a terrific decade," Abril's Mr.
Civita says. "All we have to do is get over the next two
months. I'm sure there's a promised land at the end of the
desert. The question is: Is there enough water in the canteen
to make it across?"</p>
