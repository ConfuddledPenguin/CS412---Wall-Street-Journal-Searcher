	<p class="article-leader">That loud noise you hear is the gears, pulleys and steam
whistles of the Beltway political machine, squealing over the
possibility that Mr. Bush will break his pledge and sign on
to a tax increase. This lever is supposed to somehow reduce
interest rates and that lever will prevent Congress and
George Bush from falling into the abyss of a $165 billion
deficit. It makes for grand political theater, but we doubt
there'd be any need to stage this show if early last November
Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell hadn't personally
killed a cut in the capital-gains tax.
   We'll describe in a moment the contributions we think a
capital-gains cut would have made to the economy, which some
fear has turned soft. But let's look back at how the
Washington establishment dealt with the capital-gains cut it
had in hand, and rejected, last fall.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>For starters, the same part of the Beltway establishment
that is most eager now to cure a recession with a tax
increase is the same group that ridiculed a capital-gains cut
as only a tax-giveaway to "the rich." No one was more ardent
in criticizing the capital-gains proposal from this
class-based position than Senator Mitchell.</p>
<p>Against this view, others of us argued at the time that
the main purpose of such a cut was to continue the economic
expansion of the previous eight years by giving capital an
incentive to move toward its most efficient uses, consisting
of the ideas and work of other Americans. A majority of the
House Ways and Means Committee supported the cut, and about
60 Senators, including Finance Chairman Lloyd Bentsen, were
behind the idea. On some days Dan Rostenkowski has been
willing to support it. The President was ready to sign the
bill.</p>
<p>In the end, Senator Mitchell stood against all these
forces. "This is for me]" he told his Senate colleagues. So
out of deference to their new majority leader, the Democrats
let capital gains die.</p>
<p>It is now seven months later. Federal tax receipts are
coming in below projections, partly because a slowing economy
has held down corporate profits. Smaller borrowers, such as
start-up firms, are hard-pressed to find capital, as
frightened lenders overreact to pressure from the S&L bailout
inspectors. The stock market drifts in a "trading range" as
many shareowners simply sit on their holdings; anti-takeover
laws and sentiment also lock up shares.</p>
<p>In retrospect, a capital-gains cut last November looks
like it would have been a pretty good deal. No one disputes
its significant first-year boost to revenues. Even if you
believe that the later revenue impact may be more modest, it
seems clear that a lower capital-gains rate would expand the
tax base as investors continued to take taxable profits.</p>
<p>In turn, most of those profits would have been reinvested
in the hope of further gains, and some of those investments
surely would have flowed to the smaller, cutting-edge firms
that are now being told to get lost by bankers clamping down
on credit. Perhaps not coincidentally, the job-growth figures
have gone flat.</p>
<p>By freeing up capital, a gains cut also would have
alleviated the increasing political pressure the Federal
Reserve is now under to single-handedly guarantee the
economy's health. The Fed's primary role is to control
inflation. By freezing the fiscal side, Mitchellnomics
shifted the burden back to the Fed. And in fact the Fed eased
in December, with Wayne Angell dissenting. Add to this that
Congress is still trying to mandate the uses of capital by
enacting a $27 billion Clean Air Bill, parental-leave and
child-care bills.</p>
<p>We are not trying here to overstate the effects of a
capital-gains differential; it obviously doesn't solve all
the world's economic ills or relieve policy makers of their
responsibilities, such as controlling spending. Its purpose
is to free capital to seek its most productive uses, which of
course is why so few countries other than our own tax capital
gains as we do, if at all. The fact remains that Senator
Mitchell's defeat of the capital-gains cut was a mistake,
which is the reason for the fourth installment in this
series, "The Mitchell Recession?" A full recession isn't
here, but the Mitchell slowdown is, with falling government
receipts.</p>
<p>By all reports, the congressional coalition for a
capital-gains cut is intact, and no one is disputing that it
would add significant revenue in its first year. This
certainly should be part of any deal the White House now
strikes with Congress. Indeed, the goal is sufficiently
worthwhile that it shouldn't be held hostage to any bigger
deal. Senator Mitchell and his supporters in the Democratic
party are free to fight the cut solely in class-warfare terms
if they so choose. But the rest of us are also free to argue
that the real issue is unlocking capital for productive
investments, and to the extent Mr. Mitchell continues to
thwart that process, he should be prepared to get blamed for
the consequences of an opportunity that was lost last
November.</p>
