	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- While inflation gnaws at consumers and policy
makers, some economists say the actual bite on many budgets
may be even worse than the statistics' bark.
   The consumer price index jumped 0.5% in March, pushing the
annual inflation rate to a hefty 8.5% for the first quarter.
But economists and financial planners say spendable incomes
are often pinched even tighter by difficult-to-measure,
extra-inflationary forces that include: runaway property
taxes in many areas; a spate of state and local tax
increases; soaring health costs; and rising tuition fees.
Furthermore, changing demographics may present a somewhat
different market basket than the CPI's, as index weightings
haven't been adjusted for several years.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Patrick Jackman, chief of the CPI branch of the Bureau of
Labor Statistics, concedes that the index's recent jump may
reflect catch-up on recent property tax increases. "Some of
the increase in `owners' equivalent rent' in March is at
least being linked to property tax increases in the
Northeast," says Mr. Jackman. Unlike sales taxes, which
immediately pass through the CPI, property tax increases can
lag because of the complicated way housing costs are
calculated. Rather than directly measure the diverse,
mercurial costs of homeownership, the index uses a "flow of
services" approach that calculates costs through the
so-called rental equivalent.</p>
<p>No one knows for sure just how large a factor property
taxes are in the housing component that makes up a hefty 42%
of the CPI. "There is really no way to decompose {the rental
equivalent}," Mr. Jackman notes. Of course, housing is also
one of the biggest deflationary factors in family budgets
that enjoy low-cost, fixed-rate mortgages on homes that have
soared in value in recent years.</p>
<p>Donald Ratajczak, a Georgia State University economist and
an authority on inflation, maintains that excess capacity in
the rental market may be stalling the passthrough of higher
property taxes in the CPI. While individual homeowners may be
hit with big, immediate property tax increases, rental
properties may not pass through all of a tax increase at
once, creating a sort of margin squeeze.</p>
<p>"When you have a lot of excess capacity in the rental
market, the cost pressures can't come forward," says Mr.
Ratajczak. He notes that the sharp jump in March's CPI
indicates that property tax increases are starting to pass
through to the index. "If April is like March, {the tax boost
lag} will probably catch up," he says.</p>
<p>Quirks in the CPI could be significant because the index
is a pervasive indicator. Among other things, it indicates
the effectiveness of government economic policy; affects the
wages of three million union workers covered by collective
bargaining pacts; and influences income of 60 million
Americans who receive benefits as diverse as Social Security
payments and school lunches.</p>
<p>But temporary flukes in the CPI are only one of the
talking points as economists try to match statistics with
real-life budgets. Sales taxes, for instance, are escalating
around the country as deficit-ridden states try to compensate
for federal cutbacks and a cooler economy. Unlike property
taxes, sales taxes immediately pass through the CPI's market
basket -- directly adding to inflation and muddying some
outlooks.</p>
<p>"While a slowdown in the economy is presumably helpful in
defusing inflation, it may also add some costs and raise
inflation through higher taxes," says Robert Chandross, an
economist at Lloyd's Bank, New York.</p>
<p>A recent fiscal survey by the National Association of
State Budget Officers pegs federally mandated increases in
health care costs, for the third year in a row, as a chief
reason for revenue shortages in at least 20 states. And
health costs were again recently blamed for pushing up the
first-quarter employment cost index. The overall index rose
by 5.5%; health costs jumped more than 12%.</p>
<p>The CPI's Mr. Jackman sticks by the integrity of his
index. But he concedes medical costs are a headache to
calculate. "The problem revolves around trying to maintain
the same health coverage from one year to the next. One ends
up measuring implicitly, by measuring the cost of services,"
he says.</p>
<p>Francis H. Schott, chief economist at Equitable Financial
Cos., New York, adds: "It's desperately difficult to measure
medical costs," particularly because technology has improved
medical care tremendously. Organ transplants, for instance,
"cost ungodly sums." But those costs "should be discounted by
the quality, which nobody knows how to measure," Mr. Schott
adds. For instance, it's much simpler to adjust for the
quality upgrade an air bag gives an auto than to fine-tune
for improved transplant technology.</p>
<p>While it's true the CPI was never intended to reflect
specific inflation felt by special demographic groups such as
the elderly, some analysts believe that today's demographics
herd more people into these special economic categories than
statistics such as the CPI indicate. The formula used to
compile the CPI was last updated in 1987, using 1980 census
data and consumer spending patterns from the period 19821984.
The next update is planned around 1995.</p>
<p>"Does it hit a lot more people on certain items? Sure,"
says Edward Yardeni, chief economist at Prudential-Bache
Securities Inc., New York. But can the extra-inflationary
"hits" be apportioned scientifically? No, says Mr. Yardeni,
who has written much on the demographics of the baby boomers.
He says there are too many offsetting factors to consider.
"My own individual household perspective on it is: If I'm
paying less in federal taxes but more in local and state
taxes, it's more good-news, bad-news offset," he says.</p>
<p>Karen Schaeffer, a financial planner in Bethesda, Md.,
says, "There's clearly a group of people getting a double or
triple whammy right now." The over-40 babyboomers, for
instance, can be hit with college expenses for offspring at
the same time they are asked to give financial aid to ailing
parents.</p>
<p>Ms. Schaeffer adds that college costs are rising so fast
they are difficult to track. "We've had to change our thought
process in doing our financial plans. We inched {college cost
estimates} up 6%, then 7%, now 8%." College cost surveys say
tuition is expected to jump as much as 11% in 1990 -- beating
inflation for the 10th year in a row.</p>
<p>To find out how these extra-inflationary budget-busters
can add up, one need look no further than the front door of
Robert L. Freeman of Gaithersburg, Md. Mr. Freeman, 41 years
old, and his wife Carol, also 41, have two children in
college; they live in highly taxed Montgomery County, and
they help out with medical expenses of an incapacitated
elderly uncle. How does the family cope with annual college
expenses of about $26,500 and the management of inhome health
care that has "at least doubled" in cost over the past 10
years?</p>
<p>"By saving and working two jobs," says Mr. Freeman, who
has been a firefighter for 18 years. Around the 24-hours on,
48-hours off firehouse schedule, he has built a couple of
businesses and currently works at a local lawn equipment
distributorship. Mrs. Freeman also works.</p>
<p>"I'm not crying poor-mouth," says Mr. Freeman, noting that
his property has appreciated quite nicely over the years.
"But we don't go out to dinner two or three times a week and
the kids aren't sent off to Europe in the summer. The kids
come home for summer and they work," he says. The couple have
taken out a home equity credit line but haven't drawn on it
and don't plan to unless they have an emergency.</p>
