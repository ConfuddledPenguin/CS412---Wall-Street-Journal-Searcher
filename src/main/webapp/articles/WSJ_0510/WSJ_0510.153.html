	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- The Treasury's 10-year note auction was a big
success, drawing unexpectedly strong demand from
institutional and individual investors who were attracted by
the best yields in a year.
   "It was a very strong auction," said Thomas Pura, a
partner at Goldman Sachs & Co. "Investors find securities
attractive at these levels."</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The Treasury sold $10 billion of the new 10-year notes at
an average yield of 8.88%. That was much higher than the
average yield of 8.59% at the previous 10-year note auction
in February and the highest yield at an auction since 9.18%
last May.</p>
<p>Yesterday's sale was the second part of the Treasury's
three-part $30.5 billion quarterly refunding of the federal
debt. The Treasury sold $10.5 billion of three-year notes on
Tuesday and will conclude the auction with the sale of $10
billion of 30-year bonds today.</p>
<p>Mr. Pura said yesterday's auction, coming on top of a
strong three-year note auction on Tuesday, increases the odds
that today's 30-year bond sale will go smoothly.</p>
<p>Bond dealers said that all types of investors -- large,
small, domestic and foreign -- were eager to buy the
Treasury's new 10-year notes.</p>
<p>F. Ward McCarthy, managing director at Stone & McCarthy
Research Associates, said that investors were especially
happy because yields at the auction were just high enough for
the Treasury to set a 8 7/8% coupon rate on the notes.</p>
<p>"If the average yield had been one basis point (one
one-hundredth of a percentage point) lower, the coupon would
have been set at 8 3/4%. That one basis point was important
and made the notes more attractive to the investment
community," said Mr. McCarthy.</p>
<p>Michael Moore, manager of government trading at
Continental Bank, said investors eager to buy the 10-year
notes spent much of the morning session selling 30-year,
seven-year and five-year Treasury securities "to make room
for the new 10-year." He said demand for the 10-year notes
was strong because the yield was relatively high compared to
yields on some other Treasury securities.</p>
<p>The success of the auction was clearly unexpected. Traders
said that some dealers, expecting only moderate or even weak
demand for the 10-year notes, placed bids that were too low
and subsequently did not get enough securities to meet
customer orders. Mr. McCarthy estimates that only 33% of the
major New York dealers that tendered bids were actually
awarded bonds.</p>
<p>As a result, some firms were forced to scramble to buy the
new 10-year Treasury notes in the secondary market. Evidence
of that was apparent in the unusually heavy trading activity
in the new 10-year note by interdealer brokers,
intermediaries that buy and sell securities for the 44
primary dealers of government bonds. Interdealer brokers do
not trade with the general public.</p>
<p>Traders said about $1 billion of the notes were exchanged
in when-issued trading activity at yields of 8.85% to 8.86%,
far below the auction rates. Of that amount, $630 million was
said to have been traded by RMJ Securities Corp., one of the
five major interdealer brokers. RMJ declined to comment.</p>
<p>Individual investors, who purchased a record amount of
three-year notes at Tuesday's sale, also showed a hearty
appetite for the new 10-year notes.</p>
<p>Individual investors typically buy securities at Treasury
auctions through noncompetitive tenders, which totaled $659
million at the 10-year note sale. That was well above the
average noncompetitive bids of $427 million at the previous
12 auctions, according to Maria Ramirez Capital Consultants
Inc.</p>
<p>The last time noncompetitive bids at a 10-year auction
were higher than yesterday was in August 1985, according to
Dean Witter Reynolds Inc., when noncompetitive tenders
totaled $686 million.</p>
<p>Japanese investors, as expected, bought large amounts of
the 10-year notes. A trader at one of Japan's largest
securities firm estimates that the Japanese purchased about
30% of the new 10-year notes.</p>
<p>Treasury Securities</p>
<p>Bond prices moved sharply lower ahead of the government's
10-year note auction, as dealers cut prices in an effort to
drum up demand for the government's new securities.</p>
<p>Traders said the market's weakness ahead of auction also
reflected higher commodity prices, a weaker dollar on foreign
exchange markets and a large sale of mortgage-backed
securities by the Resolution Trust Corp. RTC, the government
agency created to bailout the nation's troubled savings and
loan associations, could not be reached for comment.</p>
<p>Analysts said the RTC sale depressed the market because
buyers of the securities had to sell Treasurys to hedge their
purchase of mortgage-backed securities.</p>
<p>Treasury bond prices received a modest boost late
yesterday as dealers scrambled to buy new 10-year notes in
when-issued trading activity. But the lift wasn't large
enough to offset the large declines that occurred earlier in
the day.</p>
<p>The benchmark 30-year Treasury bond, which was quoted as
much as 3/4 point lower in early trading, ended about 1/2
point lower. The bond was quoted late at a price of 96 2/32
to yield 8.86% compared with 96 16/32 to yield 8.82%.</p>
<p>Short-term rates were slightly lower. The rates on
three-month Treasury bills was 7.75% for a bond equivalent
yield of 7.99% while the rate on six-month bills eased
slightly to 7.77% for a bond-equivalent yield of 8.18%.</p>
<p>Here are details of yesterday's 10-year note auction:</p>
<p>Rates are determined by the difference between the
purchase price and face value. Thus, higher bidding narrows
the investor's return while lower bidding widens it.</p>

<p>Accepted bids ........................... $10,025,742,000</p>
<p>Accepted at low price ...................             63%</p>
<p>Accepted noncompetitively ...............    $659,000,000</p>
<p>Average price (Rate) ....................  99.967 (8.88%)</p>

<p>Low price (Rate) ........................  99.967 (8.88%)</p>
<p>Interest rate ...........................          8 7/8%</p>
<p>The notes are dated May 15 and mature May 15, 2000.</p>
<p>Mortgage-Backed Securities</p>
<p>Mortgage securities ended 7/32 to 9/32 lower in moderate
trading.</p>
<p>Government National Mortgage Association's 9% securities
for May delivery finished at 94 1/4, down 9/32. The agency's
9 1/2% issue was at 96 25/32, down 8/32, and its 10% issue
was quoted at 99 7/32, down 8/32. Federal Home Loan Mortgage
Corp.'s 9 1/2% issue ended at 96 18/32, down 7/32.</p>
<p>The Ginnie Mae 9% issue was yielding 9.99% to a 12-year
average life assumption.</p>
<p>In the derivative markets, Freddie Mac issued a $500
million real estate mortgage investment conduit, or Remic,
backed by its 10% securities through Salomon Brothers Inc.
UBS Securities Inc. offered $300 million of Remic securities
backed by Ginnie Mae's 9 1/2% issue.</p>
<p>In the asset-backed market, Rochester Community Savings
Bank offered about $125 million of certificates backed by
automobile and light-truck loans at a yield of 9.51% through
First Boston Corp.</p>
<p>The issue by the Rochester, N.Y.-based savings bank was
rated triple-A by Moody's Investors Service Inc.</p>
<p>Junk Bonds
</p>
<p>Trump Plaza junk bonds climbed yesterday after The Wall
Street Journal's "Heard on the Street" column reported that
some bargain hunters are buying the bonds.</p>
<p>Trump Plaza is one of several Atlantic City casinos
operated by real estate developer Donald Trump. The Plaza's
12 7/8% bonds maturing in 1998 gained 1 1/2 to end at 83.
Other Trump junk bonds, including the Trump Taj Mahal Funding
and Trump Castle Funding, showed little change.</p>
<p>Most junk bonds, or speculative-grade securities with low
credit ratings or no credit ratings at all, ended unchanged
to about 1/4 point higher.</p>
<p>Investment-grade corporate bonds were 1/8 to 1/4 point
lower.</p>
<p>Municipal Issues</p>
<p>Municipal issues fell 3/8 point in quiet dealings but the
market still feels positive, according to traders.</p>
<p>"Retail is still buying bonds," one trader said. He
attributed the lack of activity to investors waiting for the
outcome of the final leg of the Treasury refunding today.</p>
<p>An unsold balance of $17.8 million remained on an $65
million issue of Delaware general obligation bonds won by a
Manufacturers Securities Inc. group. The bonds were priced
for reoffering to yield from 6% in 1991 to 7.20% in 2009 and
2010.</p>
<p>Among dollar bonds, the New Jersey Turnpike Authority's
7.20% issue due in 2018 were 3/8 lower at 96 1/4 to yield
7.50%.</p>
<p>Foreign Bonds</p>
<p>A stronger yen and falling money market rates pushed up
Japanese government bond prices.</p>
<p>The dollar ended at 157.03 yen in Tokyo, down from 157.63
yen in late New York trading and 158.05 yen at the Tokyo
close on Tuesday.</p>
<p>But dealers don't expect the yen's firmness to last. They
say that after this week's $30.5 billion U.S. Treasury
refunding that the demand for dollars will increase among
Japanese investors who have bought the new Treasury issues.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, West Germany government bonds rose when
international investors, long absent from the market, rushed
to buy mark bonds.</p>
<p>"There's a bit of a positive sentiment in this market and
no selling except for some domestic investors taking
profits," said a West German bond trader. "And that seems to
be drying up."</p>
<p>Bonn's 7 3/4% issue due in 2000 rose 0.35 point to 95.20
to yield 8.48%, while its 8% notes due in 1995 jumped 0.25
point to 96.60 to yield 8.89%.</p>
<p>Bond prices fell in Britain.</p>
