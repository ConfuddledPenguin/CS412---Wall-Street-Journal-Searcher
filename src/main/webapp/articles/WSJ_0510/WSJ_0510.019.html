	<p class="article-leader">From a Oct. 13, 1988 letter by George Bush to Povilas
Janciauskas, an officer of the Lithuanian American Community:</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>{F}reedom is not a privilege -- it is a human right. The
United States has always condemned the violation of your
national sovereignty, and in the years ahead it will never
condone the forced occupation of Lithuania by the Soviet
Union. To do so would be to turn our backs on our own values
and heritage. As a nation born out of a struggle against
tyranny, Americans should never apologize for helping others
win their freedom and I never will. And so, as we enter the
final stretch of the campaign, I would respectfully request
that you support my candidacy.</p>
