	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- A federal judge found a New Jersey investment
adviser in civil contempt, saying he "has not made a good
faith effort" to comply with a consent agreement he made with
the Securities and Exchange Commission.
   In March, the SEC charged Frank R. Breitweiser, doing
business in Newton, N.J., under the name of Orange County
Financial Planning Services, with making "material
misrepresentations."</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The charges stemmed from the adviser's offering for sale
approximately $1.1 million of securities for two investment
firms under whose names Mr. Breitweiser also does business,
Orange County Financial Income Fund and Orange County
Financial Stock Management. Mr. Breitweiser was accused of
misrepresenting "the nature, value, liquidity, rate of
return, use of proceeds and risk" of the securities.</p>
<p>In New York, U.S. District Judge Peter Leisure ordered Mr.
Breitweiser to pay a fine of $250 a day, beginning May 14,
until he complies with the agreement. Under that accord, Mr.
Breitweiser didn't admit or deny any wrongdoing, but he
agreed to repay investors more than $151,000. He agreed not
to commit any such violations in the future.</p>
<p>Mr. Breitweiser declined to comment. According to the
judge's order, Mr. Breitweiser "does not contest the fact
that he has not satisfied the conditions" of the agreement.
"Rather, he claims that he is unable to satisfy" the terms of
the accord "due to his current financial position."</p>
