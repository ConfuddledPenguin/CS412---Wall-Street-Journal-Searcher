	<p class="article-leader">PARIS -- France's total output of goods and services is
likely to continue expanding at an annual rate of between 2%
and 3% in the first half of 1990 on a market basis, little
changed from the pace recorded in the second half of 1989,
the National Statistics Institute said.
   The French gross national product grew 4.1% on a market
basis and 3.7% overall in 1989. The former figure only takes
into account market activity, thereby excluding certain
government transactions.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>French government forecasters in the Economics Ministry
said last month that GNP in 1990 would rise 3.2%.</p>
<p>Inflation, meanwhile, is expected to ease to an annual
rate of 3.1% by June, down from 3.4% in March, helped by
lower petroleum and food prices, as well as the stronger
franc, which lowered the cash cost of imports in the short
term.</p>
