	<p class="article-leader">MONTREAL -- Severe production cuts in March didn't make a
dent in Canadian pulp producers' big inventories. Meanwhile,
Canadian newsprint makers were able to trim their inventories
slightly as shipments picked up.
   Canadian output of market pulp fell 10% in March to
553,000 metric tons from 615,000 metric tons a year ago, the
Canadian Pulp and Paper Association said. However, pulp
shipments fell 13% to 564,000 metric tons from 652,000 metric
tons a year earlier. A metric ton equals 2,204.62 pounds.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The big drop in shipments left producers' pulp inventories
at the end of March virtually unchanged from February at
532,000 metric tons, a 30-day supply. Inventories at the end
of March 1989 were 290,000 metric tons, a 14-day supply. Pulp
producers operated at 85% of capacity in March, compared with
97% a year ago.</p>
<p>Market pulp is wood pulp sold on the open market to
producers of paper, sanitary and other products. The
statistics exclude pulp consumed at the producing mill or
shipped to another mill that is affiliated with the producing
mill. Canada is the world's largest producer of market pulp
and of newsprint.</p>
<p>Shipments from Canadian newsprint mills rose 2.7% in March
to 825,000 metric tons from 803,000 metric tons a year ago.
Newsprint demand has picked up as some publishers build up
stocks of newsprint in anticipation of a possible strike this
year at paper mills in eastern Canada.</p>
<p>Canadian newsprint production in March was steady at
794,000 metric tons, compared with 796,000 metric tons a year
earlier. Canadian newsprint mills operated at 95% of capacity
in March, unchanged from the previous year.</p>
<p>Canadian newsprint mills' inventories at the end of March
were 401,000 metric tons, down from 413,000 metric tons a
year ago and 432,000 metric tons in February.</p>
<p>U.S. consumption of newsprint in March was flat at
1,044,000 metric tons, compared with 1,047,000 metric tons a
year earlier.</p>
