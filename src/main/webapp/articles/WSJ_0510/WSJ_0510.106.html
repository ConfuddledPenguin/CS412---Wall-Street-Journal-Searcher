	<p class="article-leader">Trafalgar House PLC, a British construction and
contracting concern, Wednesday reported a 2.7% rise in pretax
profit for the six months ended March 31, with property and
investments the only division showing a decline in earnings.
   Pretax profit for the half year to March 31 rose to #116.9
million ($195.2 million) from #113.8 million in the
corresponding year-earlier period, hitting the midrange of
market expectations.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Profit after tax but before extraordinary items was #93.4
million, compared with #90 million a year earlier. In the
current interim period, Trafalgar House took a #15.2 million
extraordinary loss, compared with a #2 million extraordinary
loss in the year-earlier period.</p>
<p>Profit attributable to shareholders stood at #77.7
million, down from #87.5 million.</p>
<p>The company said its commercial and residential property
interests are in "the doldrums for the time being" because of
harsh U.K. economic conditions.</p>
