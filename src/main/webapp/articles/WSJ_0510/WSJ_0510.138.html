	<p class="article-leader">DALLAS -- National Realty L.P. said it settled a
class-action lawsuit brought by unitholders who claimed they
were bilked when the real estate master limited partnership
was formed in 1987 out of 35 pre-existing limited
partnerships.
   National Realty was created by a controversial rollup of
partnerships operated by troubled Southmark Corp., some of
which were devastated by the real estate bust in the
Southwest.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>While National Realty didn't admit any liability in making
the settlement, terms of the agreement call for the company
to issue to plaintiffs five-year warrants to purchase 2.75
million partnership units at $11 a unit for the first year
and $12 thereafter. Also, certain co-defendants agreed to
contribute to the partnership cash and notes totaling $5.5
million.</p>
<p>National Realty's general partners agreed to contribute
$2.5 million over four years, with the remainder coming from
the former E.F. Hutton & Co. (now Shearson Lehman Hutton
Inc.), the broker-dealer in the rollup, and Robert A. McNeil,
the former general partner of the partnerships involved in
the litigation.</p>
<p>A spokeswoman for National Realty said that other
defendants, primarily Southmark-related entities, haven't
reached a settlement with plaintiffs yet.</p>
<p>The settlement also raises the possibility that National
Realty's general partners could be removed if the value of
the partnership's units doesn't reach agreed-upon targets for
the next five years. After one year, the agreement
stipulates, National Realty units must be worth at least $11;
at the end of five years, the target is $30. Achievement of
the targets can be made both by increases in the share price
of units and by distributions to limited partners.</p>
<p>In composite trading on the American Stock Exchange,
National Realty closed yesterday at $4.875, up 25 cents.</p>
<p>If the target in any year isn't met, an oversight
committee formed by limited partners can require National
Realty to sell a percentage of its assets.</p>
<p>The settlement still must be ratified by a state court in
San Mateo, Calif.</p>
