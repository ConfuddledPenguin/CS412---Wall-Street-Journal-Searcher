	<p class="article-leader">The Alaska House of Representatives rejected a
Senate-sponsored code of ethics bill that would have made the
state's ethics law perhaps the toughest in the nation.
   The measure died 26-14 in the final minutes of the
legislature's regular annual session.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Proponents vowed to introduce a similar bill when the
legislature reconvenes next fall. As written, the measure
would have severely curbed legislators' dealings with
lobbyists, banned the acceptance of travel expenses of more
than $100 from private sources, outlawed post-election
fund-raising to retire campaign debt and kept legislators
from serving on most corporate boards.</p>
<p>The measure earlier sailed through the Alaska Senate,
which has been rocked in recent years by prolonged ethics
investigations involving two of its members. The bill was
modeled upon recommendations of an outside ethics expert
brought in by Senate leaders seeking to rehabilitate that
body's battered public image.</p>
<p>The bill received the strong endorsement of state
government watchdog groups and most of the state's
newspapers. Opponents, including most of the state's
registered lobbyists, argued that the bill was overly broad.</p>
