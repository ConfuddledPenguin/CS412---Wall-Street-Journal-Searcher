	<p class="article-leader">President Bush wants budget negotiations "unfettered with
conclusions about positions taken in the past." In plain
English, Mr. Bush is distancing himself from his
"read-my-lips" no-new-taxes campaign pledge. By this action,
the president may be taking the country a step closer to
economic disaster.
   Mr. Bush may believe that soaring deficits will do more
harm to his political fortunes than will his capitulation on
the issue of new taxes. But if this is his view, it is
short-sighted, because new taxes will further depress an
already sluggish economy, ushering in a new recession for
which the president -- not Congress -- will be held
responsible.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Further, the notion that deficits are caused by low taxes
is a complete falsehood. In fiscal 1990, federal revenues
will increase by $70 billion as a result of economic growth.
We have chronic deficits because, while income tax revenues
have grown by 8% a year during the past decade, Congress has
increased spending by 11% a year.</p>
<p>In January 1990, on national television, Charles A.
Bowsher, head of the General Accounting Office, Congress's
investigative agency, estimated that the federal government
squanders $180 billion of the taxpayers' money each year
through waste, fraud and mismanagement.</p>
<p>This is an amount equal to more than one-third of
estimated personal income tax receipts in the current fiscal
year, and $50 billion more than the estimated $129.7 billion
in corporate income taxes. And it's nearly three times
current fiscal year's Gramm-Rudman deficit target of $64
billion.</p>
<p>Just where is the waste? Perhaps a more appropriate
question is: Where isn't it? In November 1989, the General
Accounting Office reported that 17 major federal agencies had
"material weaknesses" in financial management and internal
control systems that "cost taxpayers billions of dollars"
every year. Specific losses cited by the GAO include: $6
billion at the Export Import Bank; $12 billion at the
Commodity Credit Corporation; $10-$20 billion in foreign
military sales; and $4 billion at the Department of Veterans
Affairs.</p>
<p>The worst single example of government waste in our
nation's history is, without question, the savings and loan
fiasco. This was a pure product of the perverse incentives
built into the deposit insurance system, combined with lax
oversight by Congress and the federal regulators.</p>
<p>Official estimates of the cost of the S&L bailout now run
between $325 billion and $500 billion. This will more than
wipe out any savings that our nation may gain through the
so-called "peace dividend."</p>
<p>In an April poll by the Wirthlin Group, taxpayers were
given a choice as to how they would reduce the budget
deficit. Among four options, the results were: eliminate
government waste, 64%; cut defense spending, 27%; cut
domestic programs, 4%; and raise taxes, 2%. Where should the
president and Congress begin? Citizens Against Government
Waste has compiled a list of waste-cutting initiatives that
could save taxpayers $280 billion over the next 5 years.
Nearly all of these initiatives come from reputable sources
readily accessible to the president and Congress, such as the
General Accounting Office, the Congressional Budget Office,
the Grace Commission, the Heritage Foundation, and the
Inspectors General of the various federal departments. A few
examples:</p>
<p>-- Requiring employers to make prompt payment of
accumulated payroll tax deposits of $3,000 or more would
generate approximately $14.5 billion in savings to the
Treasury, Social Security and Medicare Trust funds.</p>
<p>-- Establishing user fees for federal services enjoyed
chiefly or exclusively by specific individuals or businesses
would save taxpayers $12 billion.</p>
<p>-- Closing down strategically insignificant military bases
and properties would save taxpayers $5 billion.</p>
<p>Alexander Hamilton wrote in the "Federalist Papers" that
the real test of a democratic form of government, the
necessary but not sufficient condition of its survival, would
be whether or not it could sustain a good administration, the
frugal and proper and wise use of the resources of the
government and the people. Wasteful spending by the federal
government has put the financial integrity of the U.S. at
risk, and is undermining the accountability of our political
system.</p>
