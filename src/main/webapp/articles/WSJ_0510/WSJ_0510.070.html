   Back in 1979, Mr. Rowny put a damper on SALT II when he
quit his job as lead delegate to the talks with Leonid
Brezhnev. Then, Congress heeded an old general's message and
refused to ratify a strategic treaty that ceded important
arms advantages to the Soviet Union. Now, Mr. Rowny is
resigning again -- this time from his job as senior arms
control adviser to the president. Again, he's worried about a
strategic treaty that can put the U.S. in a scary position.
This round, Mr. Rowny's challenge is more daunting. In
Washington today, it's hard to find anyone besides Balts
worried about Soviet aggression.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The Bush-Gorbachev summit planned for the end of this
month is what troubles Mr. Rowny. U.S. and Soviet negotiators
are racing to prepare the framework for a treaty on limiting
strategic missiles, START. Secretary of State Baker is off to
Moscow on Monday to work on the effort. It's an agreement,
Mr. Rowny says, that is loaded against the United States.
We're agreeing to missile cuts with the Soviet Union, but
while we're doing so, the Soviet Union is modernizing its
missiles so they're more powerful than a START agreement
would reflect.</p>
<p>Mr. Rowny thinks a lot, for example, about SS-18s,
intercontinental missiles three times as heavy as anything
the U.S. has. The Soviet Union has land-based mobile
missiles, while America's, after years, are still on the
drawing board. He's afraid, in particular, that the U.S. will
put off the thornier problem of verification, and focus on
the glory of getting START moving now. On verification, he
points to some disturbing news. After the U.S. completed the
INF treaty with the Soviet Union in 1987, it assumed all
intermediate-range nuclear missiles were gone from East
Europe. But since then, intermediate-range SS-23s have been
discovered in East Germany, Czechoslovakia and Bulgaria.</p>
<p>Why, in the year of the peace dividend, should we care
about Cold War terms like "threat" and "verification" anyway?
Because START, at least the START that early models show,
gives a weakening country a strong military advantage.
Because a rocky Soviet Union -- one with tanks in Riga and
Vilnius, and an eye on rebellion bubbling in Tallinn -- could
be a less predictable opponent than the ossified Soviet Union
of the slow-moving Brezhnev. Mr. Rowny summed this up in a
talk he gave the other day: "It would be a tragic mistake to
impose a false clarity on the future by assuming that a
political status quo exists at present."</p>
<p>The right way to proceed with disarmament, in the Rowny
view, is to "push like the devil on conventional forces
negotiations," first. On conventionals, Moscow has already
agreed to asymmetrical cuts -- cuts that mean, for example,
that the Soviets will no longer be able to station their 17
divisions in East Germany. A more even playing field on
conventionals means the U.S. would be even less likely to
resort to nuclear weapons -- for example, the short-range
tactical missiles Secretary of Defense Dick Cheney is talking
about this week at a NATO meeting in Calgary.</p>
<p>Mr. Rowny's logic on getting a strong conventional
agreement is old but sound. He says the fact the Soviet Union
is making treaties with East Bloc countries to move off their
territory is no guarantee Europe will be safe from invasion.
"Because even if the Soviets withdraw from those countries,
they don't have a long distance to travel when they come
back."</p>
<p>Mr. Rowny himself doesn't like to compare this season's
resignation to his SALT departure. But some of the parallels
are worth noting. Verification, then as now, was for him a
key concern. Then, testifying before the Senate on SALT II,
he called the treaty "detrimental to our national security,"
and said that "In our zeal to reach an agreement the United
States made too many concessions. We permitted large
inequalities favoring the Soviet Union to be written into the
agreement." The same words represent his stand today.</p>
<p>The main difference is the audience he is addressing.
Then, Mr. Rowny went to work -- at $143 a day -- as a
consultant testifying against a treaty he succeeded in
helping to block. Now, he'll move to the role of visiting
professor at George Washington University -- around the
corner from his old office at the State Department.</p>
<p>Ed Rowny is 73, and he calls his resignation simple
retirement. Washington insiders say the arms negotiator has
become superfluous anyway. They say Secretary of State James
Baker, and the White House, don't include him in their
planmaking. While staffers work furiously to frame some kind
of START model for the June summit, Mr. Rowny heads off to a
hospital in Arlington for a hip replacement operation.</p>
<p>But this old adviser still feels his voice will be heard
in the White House. "I'm with the president and Cheney 100%
on policy," he says during a meeting in his State Department
office, and pushes his black glasses up his nose. He'd like
his musings to be heard now -- after a summit that fixes a
START plan, he argues, it will be "too late" to warn against.</p>
<p>"Arcane" is the term most folk in this town would use to
describe the Rowny view -- and, in fact, the entire
disarmament process. The principal thing, they argue, is to
make deals that will help Mikhail Gorbachev. Mr. Rowny has a
different perspective, one perhaps born of commanding a World
War II regiment in Africa, helping to plan the invasion at
Inchon and 3,000 hours at the international negotiating
table. "The Soviets were there before Gorbachev," says this
uneasy Cassandra. "And they'll be there after him."</p>
