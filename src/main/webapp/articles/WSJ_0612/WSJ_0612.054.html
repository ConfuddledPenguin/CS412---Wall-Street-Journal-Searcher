	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Political news in Japan combined with
technical factors to push the yen broadly lower against the
dollar, but the U.S. currency ended lower against the other
major currencies.
   Word that Japan's ruling Liberal Democratic Party lost a
seat in the upper house of parliament to the socialists added
steam to a yen sell-off already in progress as a result of
the dollar's push above the 152.50yen level Friday, traders
said.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Conversely, dealers said the U.S. currency weakened
modestly against the mark and other European currencies after
it failed to stay above 1.7000 marks following an attempt
early in European trading to push it above that level. The
dollar fell against the Canadian dollar following news that
Canadian leaders had come to a preliminary agreement on that
country's constitutional dispute.</p>
<p>The Liberal Democratic Party's loss came in a special
election Sunday that was the first on a national level since
an LDP majority was returned to the lower house of parliament
in elections last February. The defeat brought out latent
market nervousness about Japan's political stability, market
participants said. The socialist candidate reportedly won the
election on the strength of that party's opposition to a
widely unpopular sales tax imposed last year by the LDP.</p>
<p>Support of the sales tax was considered one of the ruling
party's greatest liabilities in elections earlier this year,
and the socialist's victory on the back of opposition to the
tax could signify that the issue might trouble the LDP in the
future.</p>
<p>The market was already in a mood to sell the yen following
the U.S. currency's break above technical resistance points
Friday and a sharp drop yesterday of 453.11 points in Tokyo's
Nikkei Stock Index, to 32540.18 points. Large movements in
the Nikkei have attracted considerable market attention
following a 23% plunge in the value of the index during the
first quarter. The yen tends to shadow large movements on the
Nikkei because the stock market is considered a barometer of
foreign investors' confidence in Japan, traders said.</p>
<p>The dollar's current strength can be traced to the
market's failure to push the currency below 150 yen last
month, said Javier Santalla, a trader at Nippon Credit Bank
in New York.</p>
<p>After a period of oscillation between 150.50 yen and 152
yen, the U.S. currency consolidated its position last week
around 152.50 yen, persuading many by Friday to drop the long
yen positions previously taken when it seemed the U.S.
currency wouldn't rise much against the yen in the near term,
Mr. Santalla said.</p>
<p>Late in New York trading, the dollar was quoted at 1.6930
marks, down from 1.6975 marks late Friday in New York, and at
154.77 yen, compared with 153.49 yen. Sterling was trading at
$1.6860, up from $1.6845 late Friday.</p>
<p>In Tokyo Tuesday, the dollar was trading at 154.35 yen
soon after opening at 154.38 yen. Meanwhile, the U.S.
currency was trading at about 1.6875 marks, down from
Monday's Tokyo close of 1.6978 marks.</p>
<p>Following the dollar's break above 152.50 yen Friday, a
new psychological target of 155 yen has been adopted by the
market, with some participants calling for higher levels in
the medium term, dealers said.</p>
<p>The strength of the dollar's upward momentum caused
Japanese insurance companies and other large institutions to
adjust their dollar hedges. They bought the U.S. currency in
the belief that the dollar would remain steady at current
levels or continue rising, said Morris Armstrong, vice
president and manager of foreign exchange at Girozentrale
Vienna in New York.</p>
<p>The hedges are maintained as a mechanism to minimize
companies' potential losses on foreign investments as a
result of daily fluctuations in foreign exchange rates.</p>
<p>The Canadian dollar gained against its U.S. counterpart
after news that Prime Minister Brian Mulroney and provincial
leaders had forged an agreement on the thorny issue of
Quebec's constitutional status, traders said. However, market
enthusiasm for the accord, which could lead to constitutional
recognition of French-speaking Quebec's status as a "distinct
society" within Canada, was limited by the prospect of
continued wrangling over the agreement in provincial
legislatures. The Canadian dollar finished at 85.38 U.S.
cents, up from 85.18 cents Friday in New York.</p>
<p>The dollar's moves yesterday came amid a general lack of
enthusiasm for aggressive position-taking ahead of this
week's slew of U.S. economic indicators, Mr. Armstrong of
Girozentrale and others said.</p>
<p>The market is awaiting the May reports on the U.S.
consumer price index and producer price index for their
possible interest rate implications, said Valerie Walker,
vice president and corporate foreign exchange manager at
Harris Trust and Savings Bank in New York.</p>
<p>Although market participants don't expect the Federal
Reserve to change its current policy of maintaining steady
interest rates, the fresh inflation figures will be an
important factor in the formulation of traders' short-term
outlooks on the U.S. economy, Ms. Walker said. Producer
prices and consumer prices, scheduled for release Thursday
and Friday respectively, are expected to have risen 0.2% in
May, compared with a decline in April's PPI of 0.3% and rise
in April's CPI of 0.2%, according to economists.</p>
<p>In Hong Kong Tuesday, gold was quoted at $356.20 an ounce.</p>
