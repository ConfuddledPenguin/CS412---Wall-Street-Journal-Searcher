	<p class="article-leader">Contrary to the claims made by Christopher Croft of
Defenders of Wildlife (letter to the editor, May 17), the
decision by Starkist, Bumblebee and Chicken of the Sea to
purchase only "dolphin safe" tuna will indeed hurt America's
tuna fishermen. Ironically, it will also result in more
dolphins being killed -- a point that Mr. Croft chooses to
ignore.
   Mr. Croft's letter also fails to acknowledge that U.S.
fishermen have pioneered dolphin-safety techniques and
technology. America's tuna fleet has a 99.4% dolphin-safety
record -- three to four times better than foreign fishermen.
Every day, American tuna fishermen jump into the water to
rescue dolphins. Indeed, the U.S. fleet's annual dolphin kill
represents only one-half of what is permitted under federal
law. Federal observers are on board for every trip taken by
an American tuna boat. Few foreign boats are equipped with
the special safety netting that American fishermen invented;
fewer still have observers on board.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Mr. Croft uses a very misleading statistic: dolphin killed
per U.S. vessel. The number has gone up on a per-vessel
basis, but only because there are fewer vessels with
significantly higher capacity. The key is that the number of
dolphin lost per ton of tuna has dropped dramatically, to
just 0.186 per ton from 0.400 a decade ago.</p>
<p>The canners' decision will put the U.S. tuna fleet at a
competitive disadvantage. By forcing us out of the tuna-rich
Eastern Tropical Pacific (where tuna traditionally swim with
dolphins), the "dolphin safe" labeling movement invites
irresponsible foreign fishermen in -- a scenario that,
according to the congressional testimony of the National
Marine Fisheries Service, will result in greater dolphin
mortality. The environmental movement has set its sights on
the wrong target. American tuna fishermen are part of the
solution to dolphin safety -- not part of the problem.</p>
<p>We invite all environmental organizations to join with the
American Tunaboat Association in asking our government to
negotiate new fishing treaties that require all fleets in the
Eastern Tropical Pacific to operate under the same exacting
standards as the U.S. fleet.</p>
