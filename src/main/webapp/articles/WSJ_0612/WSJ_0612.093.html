	<p class="article-leader">WILL CLEANER AIR cost jobs or add them?
   The debate heats up as Congress moves to enact a major
cleanup bill. The United Mine Workers sees lost jobs in
high-sulfur coal areas, and steelmakers say the tough Senate
bill could cost 25,000 jobs in closing most coke ovens by
2020. "We would be exporting pollution and the jobs" by
buying coke abroad, says Bethlehem Steel. Chrysler sees
eventual harm to employment.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>But the work required to reduce acid rain will add 30,000
jobs, says Pure Air, an Allentown, Pa., firm involved in a
joint Indiana venture. Use of more coal-consuming ethanol
could add 2,000 jobs, says the Renewable Fuels Association.
Westmoreland Coal and Walker Manufacturing may add jobs, for
low-sulfur coal and auto catalytic-converter production.</p>
<p>Michael Silverstein, who edits an environmental-investing
directory, says the bill moves work from polluters to
"polluter cleaner-uppers."</p>
<p>HAPPY FATHER'S DAY. Now help out around the house, please.</p>
<p>Fully 86% of women and 84% of girls in a poll by Working
Mother magazine and Walt Disney's Epcot Center say Dad,
breadwinner or not, should help with household chores and
child rearing; 69% of men and 64% of boys agreed. "America's
view of a father's role . . . has shifted dramatically," says
social psychologist Carin Rubenstein, on the poll of 2,962
adults and children.</p>
<p>Two-thirds of the women and 55% of men said the sexes can
equally raise children. Only 38% of the boys believe women
are as good as men at disciplining; 67% of girls think so.
Dad doesn't do more with his children because he works hard,
say 33% of men, 36% of boys, and 24% of women and girls. More
women than men say he just doesn't want to get involved.</p>
<p>GIVE WORKERS MORE SAY, and they'll do more.</p>
<p>That's a key message of a report due next week by a
35-member Commission on the Skills of the American Work
Force. The study of 400 employers will urge reorganizing work
-- to emphasize teamwork, rigorous training and high skills,
to be more competitive with foreign nations. But most U.S.
firms opt for a doomed low-wage, rapid-turnover strategy,
says Ira Magaziner, the panel's chairman.</p>
<p>Governments must require high-schoolers to meet firm
educational standards and train non-college graduates better
for job demands, says business strategist Magaziner. "The
situation will get worse" without action, adds former Labor
Secretary Ray Marshall, a commission co-chairman.</p>
<p>Teamwork urged by the panel would often be deemed cheating
in the classroom, says Bill Brock, also a panel chief and
former labor secretary.</p>
<p>JUSTICE DEPARTMENT sides with female workers and the Auto
Workers union, challenging a Johnson Controls "fetal
protection" policy that bars women of childbearing age from
jobs exposing them to lead. In a Supreme Court brief, the
department said Johnson didn't provide strong reasons for
fertility-based discrimination.</p>
<p>A SIMPLE BINGO GAME it wasn't, the feds say, as a grand
jury indicts six former or current Steelworkers union
officials, five bingo-game operators and a Catholic priest,
in Gary, Ind., for violations including illegal gambling and
embezzling union funds. The Labor Department's inspector
general and the IRS had investigated.</p>
<p>WORKERS URGED to strike last week in East Germany by
retail, restaurant and other business groups responded
mildly, with walkouts of only about an hour. The businesses
are concerned that western competitors will grab big parts of
their market after the two German states move in July toward
merging economies.</p>
<p>IMMIGRANT NURSES involved in a strike against the Kaiser
Permanente Health Plan in Los Angeles won't be deported, the
Immigration and Naturalization Service said. The Service
Employees union had sued, after the INS ruled in January that
H-1, or temporary, workers who strike aren't maintaining
required "status."</p>
<p>THE YOUTH SUPPLY shrinks for summer jobs, but more seekers
often apply.</p>
<p>The 16-to-24-year-old force will reach 24 million in July,
down 930,000 from last summer, the Bureau of Labor Statistics
says, as that population narrows. Some hotel and resort
owners say it's harder to find youngsters who want to work.
But more-vigorous promotion of pay as high as $7 an hour and
perks such as free bus service to work spurred 7,000
applications, up from 4,000 last year, for Six Flags Great
Adventure, in Jackson, N.J.</p>
<p>Bids doubled for work at the Garden State Arts Center in
Holmdel, N.J. A job fair produced the surge, helped by a
slowing economy, officials say. Long Island's Town of
Hempstead boosted starting pay for parks and beach workers to
$4.50 an hour from $4, to compete with fast-food firms, and
applications rose more than 10%.</p>
<p>Walt Disney World uses a three-day Food Feast to lure
reluctant youths for food and drink service jobs.</p>
<p>THE CHECKOFF: The Dole Foundation will honor McDonald's
for an "exemplary" record of employing persons with
disabilities; the President's Committee on Employment of
People with Disabilities similarly honors Du Pont. . . . No
hard feelings: Sara Lee, cited by the Labor Department last
year for workplace-safety violations, honors Labor Secretary
Elizabeth Dole for outstanding achievements in government.</p>
