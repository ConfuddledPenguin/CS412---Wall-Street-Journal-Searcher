	<p class="article-leader">Stocks retreated sharply in Tokyo in thin dealings as a
weaker yen and lower bond prices dried up buying interest.
   Meanwhile, stocks in London failed to recover ground at
the close, despite a surge in the value of Wall Street
shares.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Tokyo's Nikkei Index of 225 issues fell 453.11 points to
32540.18, the lowest daily close since May 24. The index lost
199.21 points Friday.</p>
<p>In early trading Tuesday in Tokyo, the Nikkei index had
dropped 193.49 points to 32346.69.</p>
<p>While there wasn't any big-lot selling Monday, traders
said, lack of buying and slight volume permitted small sales
to pull down the Nikkei Index widely.</p>
<p>Index-linked selling by arbitragers and investment trust
funds pushed down the index more than 300 points in the
morning. The index declined further in the afternoon as the
dollar rose above 154 yen.</p>
<p>The stronger dollar helped push up yields of the benchmark
10-year government bond, and the increase in long-term
interest rates prompted sales of interest-rate sensitive
stocks of companies such as steel makers, shipbuilders and
real estate developers, observers said.</p>
<p>Only 350 million shares were estimated to have changed
hands on the first section, down sharply from 675.5 million
shares Friday. Losers outpaced winners 706 to 248, while 171
issues were unchanged.</p>
<p>The Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed in the
first section fell 18.77 points, or 0.78%, to 2393.01.</p>
<p>The second section index fell for the first time in 10
trading days. The index lost 12.12 points, or 0.30%, to
4056.95. Volume was estimated at 18 million shares, down from
28.5 million shares Friday.</p>
<p>Monday's sharp setback reflects investors' disappointment
with the upturn of the dollar and domestic interest rates,
said Hiroyuki Murai, general manager of stock trading at
Nikko Securities.</p>
<p>While stock prices advanced in the past weeks because of
expectations for lower interest rates, Mr. Murai said,
participants learned such expectations were unfounded.
Movements of interest rates need to be watched carefully, he
added.</p>
<p>Economic reports scheduled to be disclosed later this week
in Japan and the U.S. are expected to shed light on the
direction of interest rates in each nation. The reports
include the Bank of Japan's latest quarterly report and
Japan's wholesale price index for May, as well as U.S.
consumer and producer price data for May and trade figures
for April.</p>
<p>Investors took a wait-and-see attitude ahead of these
reports, traders said. But there is little expectation that
the economic reports will encourage central banks of either
nation to ease credit, the traders added.</p>
<p>Mr. Murai said he saw few investors trying to sell at
Monday's low prices and predicted the Nikkei will hover
around the day's closing level for a while.</p>
<p>But some observers said stock prices may fall further,
with the Nikkei dropping below 32000.</p>
<p>Yoshiaki Mitsuoka, director of investment information at
Daiwa Investment Trust & Management, said the advance of the
dollar against the yen may be a short-term move, but it might
have triggered the start of a major setback, often seen a few
months after a plunge.</p>
<p>Since the Nikkei has continued to move higher for 10 weeks
after posting a low of 28002 points April 2, "it's quite
natural" to expect some setback in the next three to five
weeks, the Daiwa official said. "In the long run, such a
correction is welcome."</p>
<p>Some traders said another discouraging factor is that
there are few attractively priced shares left because of the
advances made recently.</p>
<p>Investors' enthusiasm to take wide and short-term profits
had led to a rise of small-capital shares on the second
section, over-the-counter trading, as well as the Osaka and
Nagoya stock exchanges, in the past weeks. But stock prices
in these categories also fell back.</p>
<p>Losers included shipbuilding companies, which had led the
recent market advance. Hitachi Zosen fell 15 yen to 856 yen
(10 cents to $5.58), while Mitsubishi Heavy Industries fell
20 yen to 1040 yen.</p>
<p>Steel shares were sold on higher interest rates, with
Nippon Steel declining 11 yen to 597 yen.</p>
<p>London traders said that market opened weaker and
continued to fall on disappointing retail sales figures.
These reports showed that the volume of retail sales rose
1.2% in May largely because of increases in food and clothing
sectors. The rise was unchanged from April's monthly increase
and well above market expectations of a 0.4% rise.</p>
<p>The data suggest that current high interest rates aren't
having the desired damping effect on consumer demand.</p>
<p>A lack of buy interest in quiet afternoon trading failed
to bolster the market to match Wall Street's early climb. The
London market "wasn't quite sure where New York" would close.
Investors "didn't want to mark London higher," said one
trader.</p>
<p>The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100 Share Index fell
17.8 points to 2348.8. The index was off 28.1 points at the
intraday low.</p>
<p>The Financial Times 30 Share Index dropped 14.8 points to
1877.9. Volume was 375.6 million shares, compared with 444.2
million issues Friday.</p>
<p>Traders said the recent euphoria appears to have
evaporated, with the market now taking greater heed of
negative economic data. There was still considerable buy
interest, but investors are waiting for the remaining
indicators to be disclosed as the week progresses, in the
hope of securing better prices.</p>
<p>Overall, "people are getting cautious, they want to see
some positive news," said one trader.</p>
<p>The insurance sector continued to benefit from bid
speculation, with Commercial Union, up 6 pence to 517 pence
(10 cents to $8.70), and Legal & General, up 5 pence at 418
pence, the favored takeover stocks.</p>
<p>ICI rose 6 pence to #12.22, on strong overseas demand,
while Guinness gained 9 pence to 788 pence on LVMH's
announcement that its tender for Guinness shares was
oversubscribed.</p>
<p>British Steel eased 2 pence to 146 1/2 pence, despite
full-year pretax profits up 24% at #733 million. This gain
was broadly in line with market expectations, but one trader
noted that the recent trend has been to sell on company
results.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, shares closed higher in Madrid and lower in
Stockholm, Paris, Brussels, Amsterdam, Milan, Frankfurt and
Zurich. South African gold stocks rose.</p>
<p>Prices were lower in Hong Kong, Singapore, Seoul,
Wellington and Taipei, and higher in Manila. Sydney was
closed.</p>
