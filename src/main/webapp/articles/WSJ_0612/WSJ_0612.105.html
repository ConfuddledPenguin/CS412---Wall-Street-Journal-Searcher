	<p class="article-leader">The government's thrift bailout agency said it will remove
from the market billions of dollars of mortgage-backed bonds
of a failed thrift, dealing a setback to investors who
thought they had locked in high interest rates.
   The Resolution Trust Corp. said it will prematurely redeem
six mortgage-backed bond issues of Franklin Savings
Association with a face value of $3.8 billion.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The action raises the prospect that the RTC will call
other bond issues. Earlier, the agency warned investors that
it had the authority to make the move.</p>
<p>The RTC is the federal agency responsible for rescuing the
nation's troubled thrift industry. It seized Franklin
Savings, a large Kansas-based thrift, in February.</p>
<p>The move is bad news for investors because the bonds
backed by home and other mortgages were issued when interest
rates were at double-digit levels. Now, investors will have
to scramble to find ways to reinvest the cash.</p>
<p>The $900 million in cash-paying bonds will be redeemed at
face value. The $2.9 billion of zero-coupon bonds will be
redeemed at their so-called accreted value, which is just a
tiny fraction of face value. The RTC said bondholders will be
paid accrued interest through the date of payment.</p>
<p>Zero-coupon bonds pay no interest but are issued at a deep
discount. Investors' gains come from the difference between
the discounted purchase price and the face value received at
maturity.</p>
<p>An RTC spokesman said that, in legal terms, the bonds are
being repudiated under a policy that was adopted by the RTC
in April. The law gives the RTC the authority to pay off
bondholders early and repudiate redemption agreements that
bondholders had with issuers.</p>
<p>The RTC spokesman said "there will likely be more
repudiations occuring" in the future. "Our decision to do
this is based on the fact that repudiation will save
operating costs for the institutions involved and ultimately
provide savings for taxpayers."</p>
<p>Market talk about the RTC action, which was made on
Friday, prompted some concern in the mortgage securities
market because the collateral backing the issues will have to
be liquidated to pay off bondholders.</p>
<p>Because mortgage-backed bonds are overcollateralized as a
protection for bondholders, the collateral liquidation should
yield more than enough funds to meet the payments to
bondholders.</p>
<p>Analysts said the zero-coupon bondholders are going to be
very unhappy with the RTC action because the accreted value
of the $2.9 billion of zeros is much less than the market
value of the bonds prior to the RTC seizure of Franklin.</p>
<p>That's because the zeros were sold in 1984, when rates
were at their highs during the past seven years. The Franklin
zeros were sold at double-digit interest rates, reflecting
the rise in Treasury yields to as high as 14% in 1984. By
early this year, with rates much lower than in 1984,
investors were paying a big premium above the accrued value
for the Franklin zeros.</p>
<p>The RTC action was a surprise to some investors,
considering the RTC faces a federal district court hearing in
Kansas on June 25 about its seizure of Franklin.</p>
<p>Franklin's former management, headed by ex-chairman Ernest
Fleischer, will ask the federal judge to return the thrift to
the former management, which says the thrift was solvent at
the time of its seizure and, therefore, should never have
been seized.</p>
<p>John Scowcroft, president of Franklin Savings Corp., the
holding company for Franklin Savings Association before its
seizure, told Dow Jones Capital Markets Report that "we
weren't consulted" by the RTC about the bond call.</p>
<p>"We think there's no need for the conservatorship. We at
Franklin would never have done this," Mr. Scowcroft said of
the calls. He added that it's his opinion that "you have to
give bondholders the benefit of the bargain." He noted that
some of the zeros are held by pension funds.</p>
<p>Following are the bond issues that will be redeemed:
Franklin's 1984 offering of $2.9 billion of zero-coupon bonds
due in 2014, 2019 and 2024 and secured by the Government
National Mortgage Association, Federal National Mortgage
Association and Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp.; $200
million of Ginnie Mae/Freddie Mac/Fannie Mae-secured 12 1/4%
bonds, Series A, due April 1, 1992; $100 million of 10 3/8%
Freddie Mac/Fannie Mae/Ginnie Mae-secured bonds, Series B,
due Sept. 1, 1993; $200 million of 9% "terms" bonds, due
March 15, 1995; $150 million of 9 1/2% bonds, due Feb. 15,
2018; and $250 million of collateralized floating-rate notes
due December 1991.</p>
