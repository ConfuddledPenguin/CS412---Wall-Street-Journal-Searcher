	<p class="article-leader">BRODCE, Czechoslovakia -- In 1983, Jan Cernohorsky's
political opinions got him into trouble with the Communist
Party. After that, he says, they let him run only companies
with serious problems.
   But even that experience hardly prepared him for his
situation today, as managing director of Jawa.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Once a world-class manufacturer of motorcycles, Jawa
certainly qualifies as a company with serious problems.
Compared with those made in Japan and the West, its
motorcycles are obsolete. Its physical plant is decrepit. Its
workers and managers are woefully unprepared for the coming
switch to free-market methods. And its main customer -- the
Soviet Union, which caused many of these problems in the
first place -- can no longer be depended upon to buy its
products.</p>
<p>"Without a substantial financial injection, we cannot
stand on our feet anymore," Mr. Cernohorsky says.</p>
<p>Jawa's problems mirror those of all Czechoslovak industry,
which First Deputy Prime Minister Valtr Komarek describes as
being "systematically devastated" over the past 40 years,
leaving it uncompetitive and technologically backward. Now,
the fates of countless companies, including Jawa, are about
to be decided by their managements, foreign investors and a
new national government.</p>
<p>While the nation's first free elections in 44 years this
past weekend capped the political revolution that unseated
the Communist government last November, Czechoslovakia's
economic revolution is just about to begin in earnest. The
winners of the election, Civic Forum and its Slovak
affiliate, Public Against Violence, will head a coalition
government that is expected to significantly speed up
transformation to a free-market economy.</p>
<p>"Basic changes haven't been performed up to now" to create
a new economic system, notes Zdenek Tuma of the Prognostics
Institute, the think tank that has provided much of the
government's economic leadership. The new government is
expected to act soon to break up monopolies, begin
privatizing state companies, and liberalize rules on foreign
investment. Even the most optimistic leaders concede the
changes will cost tens of thousands of people their jobs.</p>
<p>The problem, says a research director for a computer-parts
maker, is that by Western standards there are too many
workers for too little production. And output is declining
further in the face of collapsing sales to the Soviet Union
and other Eastern European countries.</p>
<p>The research director, speaking on condition that he and
his company not be identified, says potential Western
partners are brought to his factory at lunch time so they
won't see that "people are accustomed to not working very
hard." He predicts that "at least half our (2,500) employees
must be unemployed within half a year."</p>
<p>Workers know drastic changes are coming, "but no one wants
to believe this," the director says. "Everyone wants to think
there will come some miracle."</p>
<p>For Jawa, the miracle would be a joint venture with a
foreign manufacturer. A less desirable alternative, if the
government allows it, would be to give up majority control
and produce motorcycles for a foreign investor.</p>
<p>Japan's four big motorcycle manufacturers -- Honda Motor
Co., Yamaha Motor Co., Kawasaki Heavy Industries Ltd. and
Suzuki Motor Co. -- have visited Brodce. While the visits
were just "first contacts," Mr. Cernohorsky says, the
companies appeared serious because they want to manufacture
closer to their European market.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Jawa, whose motorcycles were once prized by
aficionados around Europe and in the U.S., struggles to
survive. The 52-year-old Mr. Cernohorsky shows visitors a
brochure advertising Jawa's model TS350 motorcycle. When
asked what other models Jawa makes, he shakes his head and
says that, apart from about 1,000 racing machines Jawa makes
a year, the TS350 is the entire line.</p>
<p>"This is the disaster," he says, adding that there is only
one street model "because that is what the Soviets wanted."
The TS350 is powered by a two-stroke engine designed more
than 30 years ago and doesn't meet emission and other
technical standards of some Western countries. But it is
cheap and easy to repair.</p>
<p>More than 70% of the 100,000 motorcycles Jawa has produced
annually went to the Soviet Union and Poland. Owing to Soviet
and Polish economic problems, and to the Czechoslovak
revaluation of its crown against the ruble, these markets are
likely to shrink, with few if any buyers elsewhere in the
world to take their place.</p>
<p>Despite the TS350's low price in West Germany -- 3,600
Deutsche marks ($2,120), compared with about DM6,000 ($3,540)
for a Western model of similar size -- Jawa sells fewer than
100 motorcycles there. As with most Czechoslovak industry,
Mr. Cernohorsky says, the problem is quality. And this, he
contends, is the heritage of an official Communist program of
the 1950s referred to as "the big shovel," which emphasized
quantity over quality.</p>
<p>That wasn't the corporate philosophy back in 1929, when
Jawa was founded by engineer and designer Frantisek Janecek.
Mr. Janecek originally got his start by producing the
German-designed Wanderer motorcycle under license, but he
soon established Jawa's own identity by producing low-cost
vehicles with innovative designs.</p>
<p>Today, Jawa plans to develop two new models for the
Western European market by 1993, Mr. Cernohorsky says. To do
that, he will need help. What Jawa can offer a foreign
manufacturer, besides a skilled work force, is access to
about 37 acres of land it owns. Restrictions on foreign
ownership of land are unlikely to be lifted anytime soon, but
a venture with Jawa potentially could offer such access.</p>
<p>Mr. Cernohorsky concedes time is running out and, if the
government permits foreign ownership, Jawa might lose its
independence. "In a month's time," he says, "it's possible
that this will be the only choice."</p>
