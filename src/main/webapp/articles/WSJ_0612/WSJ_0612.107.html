independent bottler in La Paz, Bolivia, was reported missing
and may have been kidnapped.
   But a company spokesman couldn't confirm wire service
reports that Bolivian industrialist Jorge Lonsdale was nabbed
by hooded gunmen while driving to work yesterday.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Witnesses said three men intercepted Mr. Lonsdale's car
three blocks from his office and shot and seriously wounded
his chauffeur, according to wire reports. The bottling
executive was bundled into the trunk of a waiting car which
sped off toward the northern sector of La Paz, the witnesses
told a local radio station.</p>
<p>Police said they didn't know whether the industrialist was
wounded in the shooting, according to the reports.</p>
