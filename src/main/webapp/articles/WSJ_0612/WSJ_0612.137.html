	<p class="article-leader">Hughes Aircraft Co. said the Air Force removed its
suspension that had temporarily barred certain operations of
Hughes missile-systems group from receiving new government
contracts.
   The Air Force suspended the company last month in the wake
of Hughes's guilty plea to charges of improperly using two
classified Pentagon budget-planning documents in 1984.
Hughes, a unit of General Motors Corp., agreed to pay $3.6
million in criminal and civil penalties as part of the plea
agreement.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The temporary suspension, which covered engineering,
research and certain other operations at the Canoga Park,
Calif., facility of the company's missile-making group, was
in effect while the Air Force reviewed Hughes plan to
re-establish itself as a "responsible contractor."</p>
<p>The Air Force's decision came despite assertions by
prosecutors that Hughes officials went to greater lengths
than those at almost any other company to carry out the
document-swapping scheme.</p>
