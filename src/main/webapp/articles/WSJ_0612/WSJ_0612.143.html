	<p class="article-leader">PASADENA, Calif. -- Parsons Corp. said a federal judge in
Los Angeles dismissed a lawsuit brought by 15 employees who
had challenged the leveraged buy-out of the engineering and
construction company by its employee stock ownership plan in
1985.
   The case has been closely watched by pension experts and
financial planners.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The suit had charged that the ESOP's acquisition of
Parsons's shares was a breach of fiduciary responsibility,
misuse of corporate assets and a termination of predecessor
plans, all of which injured the participants in the
transaction.</p>
<p>Specifically, the employees had charged that the company
executives who designed and implemented the buy-out pocketed
millions of dollars, while the employees' future retirement
funds became saddled with hundreds of millions of dollars of
debt.</p>
<p>But, according to Parsons, U.S. Distrct Judge Robert
Kelleher found after a five-day trial that the ESOP
retirement committee had acted "both independently and
prudently in deciding that the buy-out was in the best
interests of the ESOP participants."</p>
<p>An attorney for the plaintiffs said they would appeal. "I
respectfully believe the decision will be reversed," said
Frederick Furth, senior partner of Furth, Fahrner & Mason in
San Francisco.</p>
