	<p class="article-leader">Mitsubishi Metal Corp. said it posted a 27% rise in
consolidated pretax profit in the year ended March 31 to
34.48 billion yen ($224.5 million) from 27.26 billion yen in
the previous fiscal year.
   The Japanese company's net income jumped 32% to 15.15
billion yen, or 22.55 yen a share, from 11.48 billion yen, or
18.68 yen a share.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Mitsubishi Metal said revenue dropped 7.3% to 789.18
billion yen from 851.29 billion yen because of a change in
accounting policy. The change removed proceeds from gold and
silver trading from the overall revenues category.</p>
<p>Mitsubishi Metal forecasts sharply higher consolidated
sales and earnings levels for the current fiscal year because
they include predictions for Mitsubishi Mining & Cement Co.'s
performance in the last four months of the year. The two
companies will merge Dec. 1.</p>
<p>Sales are seen at 914 billion yen, pretax profit at 43
billion yen, and net income at 18.5 billion yen.</p>
