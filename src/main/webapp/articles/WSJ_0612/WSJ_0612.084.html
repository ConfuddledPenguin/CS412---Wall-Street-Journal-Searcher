	<p class="article-leader">Pennsylvania insurance officials denied Aetna Life &
Casualty Co.'s request for relief from the auto insurance
rate rollbacks required by the state's new auto insurance
law.
   Aetna, the state's fifth-largest auto insurer, had agreed
to halt its withdrawal from the auto insurance market in the
state until officials ruled on its rate filing. An Aetna
spokesman said the company couldn't comment on the
Pennsylvania insurance department's ruling on its rate filing
until it had a chance to review the department's entire
decision carefully.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The insurance reform law, enacted in February, requires
that auto insurers reduce rates 10% for all drivers and as
much as 22% for motorists who waive their right to sue in all
but the most serious accidents. However, it does allow
insurers to apply for relief from these rollbacks under an
"extraordinary circumstance provision."</p>
<p>For instance, one unit of the Hartford-based Aetna which
operates in Pennsylvania had asked for a 2.3% decrease for
drivers who chose the limited tort option and an 8.6%
increase for those who kept all their rights to sue.</p>
<p>The state rejected that request, saying this Aetna unit
should decrease rates by 20.4% for drivers who elected the
limit tort option and drop rates by 8.2% for drivers who
didn't take this option. The insurance department said its
decision was based on each company's ability to earn a 12%
rate of return on its surplus capital.</p>
<p>But the department said it would approve revised filings,
granting the company some partial relief by allowing it to
drop rates to the levels calculated by the insurance
department rather than the full 10% and 22% mandated by the
new laws.</p>
<p>Officials also rejected four other applications for relief
from the rollbacks yesterday. To date, 12 of 22 relief
applications have been denied.</p>
