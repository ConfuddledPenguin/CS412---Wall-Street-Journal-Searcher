	<p class="article-leader">HOLLYWOOD -- With one of the summer's most competitive
box-office weekends looming, Time Warner Inc.'s Warner
Brothers film unit is complaining that Walt Disney Co. isn't
playing fair. Disney is retorting, "Keep your shirt on."
   Disney's marketers came up with a new promotion for "Dick
Tracy," in which customers may buy T-shirts from theaters for
prices ranging from $12 to $20. The shirts serve as admission
tickets for special midnight showings Thursday night at 1,500
theaters across the country. The film then officially opens
on Friday.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Warner, which is premiering "Gremlins 2" the same weekend,
is complaining because the box-office take from those special
midnight shows -- at prices well above that of a normal
ticket -- will be included in the three-day grosses reported
by Disney on Monday.</p>
<p>Warner officials declined to comment, but in yesterday's
edition of the trade paper Variety, distribution chief Barry
Reardon said of the Disney plan, "I object to it vehemently.
How can a T-shirt be part of the theatrical gross? I don't
think it's fair."</p>
<p>A Disney spokeswoman said, "Every dollar taken in will be
reported because we're not selling T-shirts, we're selling
premium-priced tickets." She added that because the showings
technically begin at 12:01 a.m. Friday, the midnight shows
can be included as part of Friday's results.</p>
