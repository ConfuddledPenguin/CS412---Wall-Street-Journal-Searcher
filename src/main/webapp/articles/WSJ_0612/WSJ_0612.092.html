	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- The Supreme Court upheld a federal law that
gives the president the power to mobilize the National Guard
for training missions outside the U.S. without approval of
state officials.
   By a 9-0 vote, the high court upheld the constitutionality
of a 1986 federal law that said the approval of a state's
governor isn't required for the president to send the Guard
abroad.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The 1986 law was challenged by the governors of Minnesota
and Massachusetts in separate lawsuits objecting to the use
of the Guard for training missions in Central America. The
objections that Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis voiced
concerning this use of the Guard were raised as a campaign
issue by some opponents in the 1988 Democratic presidential
primaries, who tried to make him appear weak on national
security.</p>
<p>Prior to 1986, federal law required that a state's
governor approve calls to active training, but the 1986
amendment deleted the governor's authority. The two state
officials argued that the amendment violated a provision of
the Constitution that leaves it to the states to mobilize and
train the "militia."</p>
<p>A federal appeals court in Boston rejected the
Massachusetts' claim; a federal appeals court in St. Louis at
first ruled in the Minnesota case that the 1986 amendment was
unconstitutional, but then reversed itself.</p>
<p>In an opinion written by Justice John Stevens, the high
court said the Constitution clearly gives Congress the power
to order the National Guard to active duty without approval
of state officials. (Perpich vs. Department of Defense)</p>
<p>Penalizing Lawyers</p>
<p>The justices ruled, 8-1, that federal appeals courts
should defer to the decisions of federal district judges to
fine lawyers for filing frivolous lawsuits. The decision will
make it tougher for lawyers to win on appeal of their fines.</p>
<p>In an opinion written by Justice Sandra O'Connor, the
court ruled that appeals courts should reverse fines imposed
on lawyers only if the judge "abused his discretion." This is
legal terminology for a lenient standard that gives district
judges wide leeway.</p>
<p>The decision involved what is known as Rule 11 of the
procedures governing civil lawsuits in federal court. Adopted
in 1938, the rule was amended in 1983 to give judges the
authority to impose sanctions on lawyers to discourage the
filing of frivolous cases.</p>
<p>The justices resolved three issues. First, they ruled that
a plaintiff's decision to get their lawsuit dismissed doesn't
preclude a federal judge from considering whether to impose
sanctions on the lawyer. Second, the justices said the
appeals courts should defer to district judges in such cases.
Finally, the high court said lawyers who appeal Rule 11
sanctions can't be penalized further by having to pay the
winner's legal fees for the appeal.</p>
<p>The high court ruling is a defeat for Cooter & Gell, a
Washington law firm that was engaged in a long legal battle
on behalf of a competitor of Hartmarx Corp. A federal
district court ordered the law firm to pay $21,452 and
required the competitor, Danik Inc., to pay $10,701. (Cooter
& Gell vs. Hartmarx Corp.)</p>
<p>State Taxes</p>
<p>Just a week after deciding two state tax cases that tied
the high court in knots for two years, the justices agreed to
hear two more challenges to state business taxes, one in
Florida, the other in Georgia.</p>
<p>In one case, the court agreed to hear a challenge by James
B. Beam Distilling Co. to a Georgia liquor tax that the
company paid from 1982 through 1984. The tax was amended in
1985, but the company sued for a refund of $2.4 million it
had already paid. The company said the tax discriminated by
charging higher rates on liquor manufactured in other states
and imported into Georgia.</p>
<p>The Georgia Supreme Court ruled that the tax before 1985
was unconstitutional since it directly interfered with
interstate commerce. But the state court, saying that Beam
wasn't entitled to a refund, said the ruling applied only to
future cases.</p>
<p>Last week, in a Florida case, the justices ruled that
states must give taxpayers relief if their taxes are ruled
retroactively unconstitutional. But the court was deeply
divided about when such rulings should be retroactive. The
Beam case gives the court another chance to clarify when
decisions that taxes are unconstitutional should be applied
retroactively. (James B. Beam Distilling Co. vs. Georgia)</p>
<p>In the other case, Ford Motor Co.'s financing unit, Ford
Motor Credit Co., challenged a tax assessment by the state of
Florida of $2 million including penalties and interest for
1980 through 1982.</p>
<p>The Florida tax is imposed on intangible property. In this
case, the tax was imposed on the value of outstanding car
loans extended by Ford and owed by Florida residents for cars
manufactured in other states and shipped to Florida.</p>
<p>The company argued that the tax was imposed in a way that
would expose the same property to multiple taxation by
Florida and other states where the company does business. The
company argued that this is unconstitutional.</p>
<p>But a Florida appeals court upheld the tax. The appeals
court said that the U.S. Supreme Court has never said the
Constitution prohibits this risk of overlapping taxation when
it comes to property taxes.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the justices agreed to hear Ford's appeal.
