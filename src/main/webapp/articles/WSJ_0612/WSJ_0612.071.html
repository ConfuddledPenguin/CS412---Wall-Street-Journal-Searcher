	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Thomson McKinnon Inc. said it filed for
protection from creditors under Chapter 11 of the U.S.
Bankruptcy Code, part of the liquidation of the company that
began nearly a year ago.
   The company's principal asset is its general partnership
interest in Thomson McKinnon Asset Management Limited
Partnership. It listed its liabilities at $281 million and
its assets at $35 million, a spokesman said. The largest
creditor is the company's landlord, Assay Partners, which is
owed about $62 million, the spokesman said.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Thomson McKinnon recently agreed in principle to sell its
general partnership interest in Thomson McKinnon Asset
Management to a group including executives. This plan calls
for the group to purchase 200,000 general partnership units
from Thomson McKinnon for $800,000, and to pay $5.4 million
for an option to buy the balance of Thomson's total of about
6.2 million units. The proposed sale shouldn't be impeded by
the filing, Thomson said. The spokesman said the transaction
could be completed in six or seven weeks.</p>
<p>The company also is the parent of Thomson McKinnon
Securities Inc., which sold its retail brokerage network last
summer to Prudential-Bache Securities Inc., a unit of
Prudential Insurance Co. of America. The operations that
remained of the broker-dealer unit filed for Chapter 11
protection in March.</p>
