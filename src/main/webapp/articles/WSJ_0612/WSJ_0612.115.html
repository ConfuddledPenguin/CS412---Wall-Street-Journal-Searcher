	<p class="article-leader">Ferranti International PLC's chairman, Eugene Anderson, is
seeking new financing arrangements to help bankroll his
planned restructuring of the troubled British electronics
concern's remaining businesses.
   Mr. Anderson said he has asked Ferranti's bankers "to
refinance us to give us the working capital we need." He said
he wants "to complete those {financing} negotiations this
month." A U.S.-born corporate troubleshooter, he took the
Ferranti post in February after the company had a crisis last
fall, owing to an alleged $363 million fraud at a big U.S.
unit, which led Ferranti's 29 banks to craft an emergency
financing accord. Mr. Anderson said he wants to replace that
pact with "a more normal banking relationship," in which the
number of banks may drop to as few as 10 or 15. The new
arrangement would enable Ferranti to pursue new business, he
said.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Under the plan, Ferranti's five divisions will shrink to
three: aerospace systems, strategic management systems, and
commercial and industrial systems; some manufacturing
facilities will be closed, and an unspecified number of the
12,000-member work force world-wide will be cut.</p>
