	<p class="article-leader">CHICAGO -- Gerald Greenwald, head of the employee effort
to buy UAL Corp.'s United Airlines, said banks were
"generally optimistic" during initial discussions last week
about financing the $4.38 billion offer, but he conceded that
lenders aren't jumping to embrace the deal.
   In his first in-depth interview since joining the buy-out
effort two weeks ago, Mr. Greenwald said he recently
discussed the transaction with "five or six" major U.S.
banks. "Nobody was willing to say then and there, `The
proposal is fine. Let's go,'" he acknowledged.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Lenders sought assurances from Mr. Greenwald on how the
100% employeeowned company would be governed, who would hold
key management positions and whether the company could
withstand a recession if it took on additional debt. "I find
this quite normal in early discussions with banks," he said.
"Generally, the tone was on the optimistic side."</p>
<p>Mr. Greenwald declined to name the banks involved in last
week's discussions. He said the talks were only a prelude to
more detailed discussions that will take place in coming
weeks.</p>
<p>Although the buy-out group is just beginning its push for
financing, the questions banks raised give an early
indication of the issues that must be resolved for the banks
to back the buy-out effort.</p>
<p>Mr. Greenwald said he believes the banks' concerns will be
allayed when they receive more detailed financial information
on the buy-out group's business plan. The group is expected
to make that material available to potential lenders within
the next few days.</p>
<p>The data include the group's five-year revenue projections
for United, as well as other financial data. For instance,
the buy-out group is counting on increased revenue from
United's lucrative Pacific routes and the sale and lease-back
of aircraft to generate sufficient cash flow to operate the
airline and service debt.</p>
<p>Mr. Greenwald said he is convinced there will also be
sufficient cash flow for expansion. He conceded, however,
that United might be unable to grow as quickly as some of its
competitors until the debt is paid off.</p>
<p>Mr. Greenwald's task is made more difficult because this
is the second time in 10 months that banks have been asked to
finance a UAL buy-out. Banks scoffed at financing an earlier
labor-management bid, saying the group based the earlier
proposal on highly optimistic revenue projections.</p>
<p>Mr. Greenwald described the latest projections as "far
more conservative." He added that before he decided to leave
the No. 2 job at Chrysler Corp., he read through all of the
information that is about to become available to banks, and
there is "no undue optimism" in the latest projections.</p>
<p>He said United's cash flow should be sufficient after the
buy-out for it to remain competitive, even in a recession.
Despite the additional debt United will incur as a result of
the buy-out, Mr. Greenwald said he believes it would be able
to withstand a sustained fare war.</p>
<p>Many bank executives have expressed the fear that a
debt-laden United would lose ground to its healthier
competitors if a major fare war broke out.</p>
<p>Mr. Greenwald, who will become UAL's chairman if the
buy-out is completed, succeeding Stephen M. Wolf, said banks
were particularly concerned about who will fill the other top
two management positions. "They want seasoned management in
the top three or four jobs," he said.</p>
<p>Although the buy-out group hasn't yet made a decision on
those positions, Mr. Greenwald said he expects substantially
all of UAL's current 35 senior managers to remain in place.
He said he planned to spend the next several days talking
with current managers to head off the possibility of mass
resignations, should the buy-out succeed.</p>
<p>He said he is also in the process of contacting
prospective candidates to serve as outside directors.
United's three unions will also have a say in who those
directors are. He declined to name his nominees, but he added
that some of his choices aren't known for their union
sympathies, but that the labor leaders so far haven't
objected to his recommendations.</p>
<p>Mr. Greenwald said he believes his biggest obstacle is
time. The employee group has a deadline of Aug. 9 to obtain
financing. "There isn't time to make mistakes," he said.</p>
<p>He also said it is difficult to gauge how much of an
effect current market volatility will have on the
transaction. "On the other hand, lenders are in the business
of lending money, and there aren't many big deals around that
are{as} financeable" as the UAL proposal, he added.</p>
<p>Separately, United said Barry A. Kotar resigned as
president of Covia, the reservations system in which UAL
holds a 50% interest. If the employee buy-out succeeds, Covia
will be spun off and UAL shareholders will receive a new
security in the reservations unit.</p>
<p>Mr. Kotar left to become an executive vice president,
computer and communications operations, at NWA Inc., parent
of Northwest Airlines. His departure wasn't viewed as a
harbinger of other possible UAL management resignations.</p>
