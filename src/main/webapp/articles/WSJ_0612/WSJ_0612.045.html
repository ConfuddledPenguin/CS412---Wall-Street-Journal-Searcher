	<p class="article-leader">BASEL, Switzerland -- The Bank for International
Settlements, conducting its annual meeting here, said freer
capital flows are helping avoid havoc from big trade
imbalances in the world financial system.
   The BIS, which functions as a central bank for the world's
major central banks, said the freer capital flow makes it
easier for funds to flow to economies with large trade
deficits, like the U.S., which posted a $104 billion
current-account gap last year.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The BIS found that overall, capital flows increased in
1989, with the biggest investments pouring toward the 12
European Community countries. Total investment into the EC
came to $63 billion in 1989, up from $47 billion a year
earlier. Increased acquisitions by U.S. companies, along with
greater investment by pension funds, insurance companies and
unit trusts, accounted for much of the increase. Britain,
perhaps the most open to foreign investors, won $26 billion
of the investment last year, compared with $6 billion for
West Germany.</p>
<p>The BIS said the most important developments of the decade
were unexpected ones: the collapse of communism in Eastern
Europe, and the durability of the economic expansion in the
big industrial countries.</p>
