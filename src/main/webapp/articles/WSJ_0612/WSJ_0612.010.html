	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- In an unexpected move, Jeff Jarvis quit as
editor of Time Warner Inc.'s Entertainment Weekly just 18
weeks after the magazine's launch, citing "creative
differences over the direction of the magazine."
   The resignation of the 35-year-old editor, who conceived
Entertainment Weekly, reflects internal disageement over its
style, content and direction. It also follows a decision by
Time to begin a redesign of the publication after advertising
agency executives and readers criticized it as overly
cluttered and as hard to read.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>According to magazine staffers, Mr. Jarvis clashed with
top Time Warner magazine executives over the editorial
direction of the magazine, even though the executives
originally approved and eagerly promoted Mr. Jarvis's concept
of a consumer guide to entertainment products ranging from
movies to books. Mr. Jarvis originally proposed the idea in
January 1984, when he was the television critic of People
magazine.</p>
<p>But the staffers said Time Warner reacted to early
negative reader and advertiser reaction, pressuring Mr.
Jarvis to create a magazine with a broader appeal,
emphasizing show business celebrities. "This guy had a good
idea, but the readership really didn't buy it early on," said
Dennis McAlpine, an analyst at Oppenheimer & Co. "They are
playing with it now. It's tough when you have a baby boy and
they try to make it into a baby girl."</p>
<p>Time said in a statement that it's "quite confident about
the magazine's future," despite industry speculation that the
magazine's birth pangs might lead to an early and costly
demise. But at the very least, publishing industry observers
said, Mr. Jarvis's resignation is a big public-relations blow
to Time, which has bet heavily on Entertainment Weekly's
success domestically and has contemplated international
editions.</p>
<p>Time is putting Entertainment Weekly into the hands of a
veteran editor of its most successful mass-market magazine,
People. Mr. Jarvis's successor will be People's executive
editor, James W. Seymore Jr. At People, Mr. Seymore had
edited the magazine's show business sections, among other
things, before being named executive editor last year.</p>
<p>Bob Zach, media director at ad agency Chiat/Day/Mojo Inc.,
said Mr. Jarvis's resignation represented Time's "vote of no
confidence for the original product. Jarvis is saying what
Time Warner now wants isn't his vision." Mr. Jarvis, for his
part, said in a telephone interview that Time backed off too
soon. "The concept is still a strong one, but it's a big
venture and takes hard work," Mr. Jarvis said. "I don't think
it's been given a chance."</p>
<p>Mr. Zach noted that changes have already become apparent
in the magazine: "It's already more mainstream, more
celebrity-focused." Mr. Zach added that while celebrity
coverage may help sell the magazine to a broader audience, it
might not appeal to more sophisticated and upscale readers in
major markets such as New York, Chicago and Los Angeles.</p>
<p>Entertainment Weekly is the Time magazine group's first
major launch since the ill-fated TV-Cable Week flopped six
years ago. Time has said it's spending less than $50 million
in the first year to launch the magazine. Mr. McAlpine of
Oppenheimer said the magazine is expected to produce losses
of more than $30 million this year. Time declined to comment
on Mr. McAlpine's estimate.</p>
<p>Time said circulation for the fledgling magazine has
reached about 600,000, the rate base it promised to
advertisers. It also said ad pages have reached projections
of at least 20 pages an issue.</p>
<p>The editor in chief of the Time magazine group, Jason
McManus, and the unit's chief executive officer, Reginald K.
Brack, weren't available for comment. In a prepared
statement, Mr. McManus lavished praise on Mr. Jarvis, saying
the company is "enormously grateful" to him for "bringing
Entertainment Weekly to life." The magazine "would never have
been created without Jeff," added Michael J. Klingensmith,
the magazine's publisher. "His energy, imagination and
enthusiasm were key to launching it and putting it on a
steady course."</p>
<p>Mr. Jarvis said he isn't sure if he will remain at Time in
some other post. Mr. Klingensmith said, "We hope he stays."</p>
