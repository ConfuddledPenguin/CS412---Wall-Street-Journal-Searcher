	<p class="article-leader">After several years of debate, the U.S. and other members
of the International Monetary Fund agreed in May to increase
the fund's financial resources by $60 billion, to $180
billion. When ratified by the U.S. Congress and other
national legislatures in the next year or so, this is
supposed to enable the IMF to help meet the financial needs
of Eastern Europe and the developing countries.
Unfortunately, the quota increase is the wrong solution to
the right problem.
   First, the problem. Almost a decade after the onset of the
Third World debt crisis, most of the Latin American and
African economies remain stagnant, pushed out of the world
economy by their own mismanagement, the scarcity of risk
capital, and industrial-country protectionism. Democratic
leaders throughout the developing world are struggling to
adopt free-market reforms and to sustain economic
stabilization programs. These efforts are understandably
impeded by the reluctance of creditors and investors to
provide much new financing, at least until the debtors
establish credible track records of reform.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The circumstances are similar in Eastern Europe. While
there is a lot of sympathy in the West for the dramatic
changes that have occurred since the Berlin Wall came down,
the capital needed to support the structural reforms that lie
ahead does not appear to be readily available.</p>
<p>This is where the IMF and the new quota increase come in.
In almost any analysis the developing world and Eastern
Europe will need fresh capital to achieve reasonable economic
growth if structural reform continues. But private investors
demand higher returns and more security than these countries
can afford. The logic is straightforward: If the private
markets will not provide the capital, then the IMF, along
with the World Bank, should fill the gap.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the shoe may not fit the foot. The IMF was
designed to manage the overall direction of the international
monetary system and to provide short-term financial support
to countries with temporary balance-of-payments problems. The
fund is not a particularly good vehicle to mediate between
reluctant creditors and needy borrowers, nor to provide the
kind of long-term development finance that is required to
support structural economic reform. Argentina and the
Philippines do not have short-term payments imbalances: They
have chronic payments imbalances.</p>
<p>Indeed, during the past decade the IMF has wandered far
from its original mission. Under the leadership of Jacques de
Larosiere, the fund played a major role during the early
1980s in preventing the Third World debt crisis from becoming
a systemic crisis that could have threatened the integrity of
international financial markets. But the IMF's stopgap
efforts failed to resolve the underlying problems of debtor
country insolvency and stagnation. This was because IMF
advice was sometimes misdirected and sometimes not followed.</p>
<p>Stabilization programs were constantly renegotiated, and
short-term loans effectively became long-term loans. The
whole process undermined the credibility that the IMF's "seal
of approval" used to have for private investors, so the
fund's ability to mobilize private capital -- which in the
past had magnified the impact of its lending --
disintegrated.</p>
<p>In addition, the reluctance of the U.S., the IMF's most
powerful member, to accept the same kind of economic policy
criticism and guidance that are routinely imposed on other
countries undermined the credibility of the fund in its role
as guardian of international monetary arrangements among the
major industrial countries.</p>
<p>With currency negotiations largely conducted among the
major industrial countries, outside the context of the IMF,
the fund is now a sideshow when it comes to core
exchange-rate issues. The irrelevance of the IMF on monetary
questions has been furthered by the unfortunate U.S.
preference for bilateralism (especially when dealing with the
Japanese) and economic summitry. The annual summits of the
seven industrial country leaders have become far more
important monetary venues than the periodic meetings of IMF
directors and governors.</p>
<p>The consequence has been that there has been a significant
blurring of the roles of the IMF and the World Bank. Both
have, essentially, the same clients -- developing countries.
Both tie their lending to structural economic reforms as well
as to progress in achieving short-term financial
stabilization. Both are privileged creditors that insist on
the seniority of their loans over those of other creditors.
And both are staffed by overzealous but quite talented
economists whose starting premise is that they know more
about governing any particular country than its own
government does.</p>
<p>Do we need both institutions? As currently operating,
probably not. In today's circumstances more money -- the $60
billion IMF quota increase -- is not enough of a solution. No
more than $20 billion of that money would, in any case, be
paid in hard currency.</p>
<p>There is, however, an urgent need to make more risk
capital available to Eastern Europe, Latin America, and the
rest of the developing world, without which the reform
process in many countries will falter. But there is also a
need to rethink the IMF and World Bank, to bring the
institutional framework created at Bretton Woods more than 40
years ago in line with dramatically changed economic and
political conditions -- and the realities of the Bretton
Woods institutions themselves.</p>
<p>The U.S. and its partners should do both: fix the fund and
spend the money.</p>
