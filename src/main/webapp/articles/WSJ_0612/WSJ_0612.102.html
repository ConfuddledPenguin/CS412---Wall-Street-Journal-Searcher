	<p class="article-leader">Genlyte Group Inc. said second-quarter earnings may plunge
as much as 50% because of construction strikes in Canada and
a slowdown in commercial and residential construction in the
Northeastern U.S.
   The Secaucus, N.J., company, which makes lighting fixtures
and controls under such names as Lightolier, KLP and Hadco,
said it has increased spending to promote sales and maintain
market share, but a spokesman said there could be some
cutbacks in operations.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"When things are off this much you always have to look at
{cutbacks} even if they're temporary," he said, adding:
"We're watching all our expenses now, obviously." Genlyte
employs 4,000 people and has 21 plants in the U.S., Canada
and Mexico.</p>
<p>For last year's second quarter, it posted a 14% increase
in net income to $3.4 million, or 26 cents a share; revenue
rose 3% to $128.5 million. For all of 1989, net increased 8%
to $12.3 million, or 95 cents a share; revenue rose 4% to
$511 million.</p>
