	<p class="article-leader">DETROIT -- Ford Motor Credit Co., the financing arm of
Ford Motor Co., says it will go nationwide this fall with a
program that bases the interest rate charged for a car loan
on a consumer's credit history.
   General Motors Corp.'s financing arm, General Motors
Acceptance Corp., made a similar program available to its
dealers in March 1989. Chrysler Corp.'s auto finance arm,
meanwhile, is developing a similar financing system that
could be offered to dealers within the next 12 months.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Ford Credit's program ranks customers on a scale from
level one, the best credit risk, to level four, the worst
risk. New-car buyers who are assigned a level-one rank can
get financing at interest rates 1.25 percentage points below
Ford Credit's base rate. That's the rate charged to consumers
with "average" credit and assigned a level-two rank.</p>
<p>Conversely, customers deemed poor credit risks could pay a
rate of interest three to four percentage points higher than
the base rate. Ford Credit said its base interest rates for
car loans vary from state to state, but currently range
between 11.5% and 12.25%.</p>
<p>Ford Credit said it will assign the rankings, but dealers
will continue to negotiate the actual interest charges with
customers on a deal-by-deal basis.</p>
<p>Ford Credit officials say their aim is to attract buyers
whose solid credit ratings allow them to get lower finance
rates at banks. Also, by raising rates for high-risk
customers, the finance unit can partly offset the costs of
higher loan losses.</p>
<p>"It's our hope and long-term plan that {this} will be our
standard program" for financing auto loans, says Leo Larkin,
Ford Credit's vice president of marketing. Ford Credit
started assigning credit rankings to customers in 1988 as a
test program in a few dealerships. The financing rating
system currently is offered through about 35% of Ford and
Lincoln-Mercury dealers.</p>
