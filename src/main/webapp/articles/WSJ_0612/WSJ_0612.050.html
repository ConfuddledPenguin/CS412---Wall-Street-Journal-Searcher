	<p class="article-leader">Do tobacco ad bans work? Tobacco companies have always
insisted they don't, that tobacco ads don't make anyone start
smoking in the first place. But Canada's 18-month-old tobacco
ad ban suggests otherwise, and could help tobacco opponents
in their fight to block the ads in the U.S.
   Since Canada instituted the ban in January 1989, tobacco
consumption, which had been declining, has slipped at an even
steeper rate. Since 1982, tobacco sales have fallen off 25%,
with the steepest annual decline, nearly 7%, coming last year
along with the ban. And the drop seems to be getting faster,
with sales in the first four months of this year plunging by
10%, according to tobacco executives and government
officials.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>To the ban's proponents, those figures are clear evidence
that the ad ban is making its mark. "Smoking is a tough nut
to crack, and we didn't think this was going to make it go
away overnight, but certainly all the signs are in the right
direction," says Byron Rogers, an analyst with the tobacco
products section of Canada's Department of National Health
and Welfare in Ottawa.</p>
<p>Tobacco companies insist that advertising has nothing to
do with the consumption decline. They blame big tax increases
on cigarettes put in place at the same time as the ban. A
pack of smokes in Canada now costs as much as C$5 (US$4.25),
more than a dollar more than before the ban, and double the
price just south of the border in the U.S. "Obviously, it has
to do with taxes," says a spokesman for Imperial Tobacco
Ltd., Canada's largest tobacco company.</p>
<p>Adds a spokeswoman for RJR Macdonald, a Canadian unit of
RJR Nabisco, "The minute the taxes increase, you can see the
decline in sales. It's such an instantaneous reaction, and
advertising doesn't work that way. Advertising is slow,
methodical and cumulative."</p>
<p>The debate over tobacco advertising is being touched off
anew as other countries move to restrict the ads. France's
cabinet last week voted to ban all tobacco advertising
effective Jan. 1, 1993. Australia and New Zealand both have
proposed severe restrictions. Italy, Portugal and most of the
Scandinavian countries already bar tobacco ads from both
television and print media. In Canada, the ban is being
fought in the Quebec Superior Court in Montreal, where two of
the country's major tobacco companies have challenged its
constitutionality.</p>
<p>The problem on both sides of the debate is that it is
virtually impossible to isolate tobacco advertising's impact.
Other factors are bound to get in the way, from taxes to
health education. In Canada, the problem is compounded
because the ban is being phased in gradually; there hasn't
been a clean break from tobacco ads. Billboards have been
reduced but won't be banned until year end. In-store
advertising won't be eliminated until 1993. Sports
sponsorships won't be affected at all.</p>
<p>"I wouldn't expect a big impact of the advertising ban in
the short run," says Richard W. Pollay, professor of
marketing at the University of British Columbia in Vancouver.
"In the long run, it affects starting rates and quitting
rates, but that takes a new generation before you start to
see that."</p>
<p>Mr. Pollay and other academics, though, believe that
tobacco ad bans are effective -- at least to some extent.
Jeffrey Harris, an economics professor at the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology, contends the tobacco companies'
argument that stiff taxes are to blame for declines just
doesn't wash. Mr. Harris, who studied ad bans in other
countries, says cigarette consumption typically declined
following ad bans and that "the declines were bigger than you
would expect from taxes alone. Tax increases alone couldn't
explain it in any country."</p>
<p>The cigarette companies' other major argument is that they
use ads only to persuade current smokers to switch brands,
not to entice nonsmokers into a bad habit. "Advertising is
basically to attract those who already smoke from one brand
to another. It doesn't affect consumption," says a spokesman
for Rothmans Benson & Hedges in Toronto.</p>
<p>But Mr. Pollay, who studied cigarette company strategies
before testifying in favor of the ban, dismisses that
argument. "The corporate documents are point blank that
they're targeting youth and would-be quitters, what they call
prequitters," he says. "Most of the attention is to provide
reassurances to people who are anxious about their health,
and to induce starters -- because in the long run, that's the
name of the game."</p>
<p>In Canada, if the ad ban survives the constitutional
challenge, the ultimate test of its effectiveness won't come
for another few years, when the country will be able to
measure whether fewer people start smoking. So far, the
results are inconclusive. About 20% of 15- to 19-year-old
Canadians are regular smokers, about the same percentage as
has been true since the mid-1980s, says the Department of
National Health's Mr. Rogers. "Ultimately, we would like to
see more success in affecting starting smokers," he says. "We
still have a problem."</p>
