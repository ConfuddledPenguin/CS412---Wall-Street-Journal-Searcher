	<p class="article-leader">Amersham International PLC, a British health-care and
life-science group, reported an 11% gain in pretax profit for
the year ended March 31 despite losses on Japanese business
and the costs of a now-canceled diagnostic equipment
development project.
   The company said pretax profit rose to #23.9 million
($40.22 million) from #21.4 million, at the upper end of
market forecasts.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Profit after tax, less minorities, or profit attributable
to shareholders, increased 31% to #16.9 million pounds from
#12.9 million. No extraordinary items were reported in the
latest results or for the year-earlier results.</p>
<p>Sales rose 15% to #207.7 million from #180 million.</p>
<p>The company said it has canceled the development program
of its automated clinical diagnostic instrument, in favor of
enhancing the existing Amerlite system, a series of tests
that measure hormones and key substances in the blood.</p>
<p>Amersham said it is reassessing the need for a better
balance between short-term profit and long-term growth and
applying core skills and technologies to real market
opportunities.</p>
