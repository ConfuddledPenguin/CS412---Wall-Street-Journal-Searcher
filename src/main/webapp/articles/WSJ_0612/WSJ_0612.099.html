	<p class="article-leader">Grossman's Inc. said second-quarter net income will be
"well below" the year-ago $10.6 million, or 40 cents a share.
   The Braintree, Mass., building-supplies retailer blamed
the decline on poor business conditions in the Northeast and
the expense of launching a new merchandising plan with name
brands, broader selection and lower prices. It said that
"customer reaction to the program has been heartening."</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The company also said its May sales on continuing
operations rose 4.1% to $78.5 million from $75.5 million in
May 1989. For the June quarter last year, Grossman's reported
sales of $343.9 million. Sales for the quarter from
continuing operations were $237.9 million.</p>
<p>Grossman's sold its operations in the Northwest in the
year-ago third quarter.</p>
