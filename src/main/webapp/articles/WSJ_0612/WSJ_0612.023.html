	<p class="article-leader">HIGHLAND PARK, Mich. -- In an effort to cool rampant
speculation about his future with Chrysler Corp., Bennett E.
Bidwell, chairman of the Chrysler Motors unit, confirmed he
plans to leave the No. 3 auto maker effective Jan. 1, 1991.
   Mr. Bidwell, who turns 63 next week, has hinted broadly
since January that he would leave before age 65. He had
indicated his departure could come early next year, but a
statement issued yesterday after a story about his plans
appeared in Automotive News was the first official
confirmation of his intentions.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Those intentions could change, however; Mr. Bidwell said
that if he's "really needed" at Chrysler, he's "prepared to
alter" his plan.</p>
<p>Mr. Bidwell has already had to alter at least one plan
regarding his role at Chrysler, where he is currently
responsible for consumer affairs, service and parts, the
Chrysler Canada unit and sales and marketing. Largely because
of health reasons, Mr. Bidwell last year negotiated a roughly
40% reduction in his corporate responsibilities in exchange
for an equal cut in pay. The new arrangement was supposed to
take effect Jan. 1, 1990, but soon after it was negotiated
Mr. Bidwell was given additional duties. The reduced workload
never materialized, even though the pay cut remains in
effect. In 1989, Mr. Bidwell received $579,279 in salary.</p>
<p>Mr. Bidwell is the fourth top Chrysler executive in as
many weeks to announce a departure, but Wall Street didn't
appear overly concerned with the news. In New York Stock
Exchange composite trading yesterday, Chrysler closed at
$16.25, up 50 cents.</p>
<p>Gerald Greenwald, Chrysler's vice chairman and Mr.
Iacocca's heir apparent, resigned abruptly late last month to
lead a proposed employee buy-out of UAL Corp.'s United
Airlines. Chrysler's treasurer has also said he will leave
and its vice president of international operations resigned
in mid-May to take a top job with Black & Decker Corp.</p>
<p>Last week, Lee A. Iacocca, Chrysler chairman and chief
executive officer, said he will remain with Chrysler beyond
the December 1991 expiration date of his current contract. He
didn't specify further, but said one of the tasks he wants to
complete before he leaves is to create a clear line of
management succession.</p>
<p>Mr. Bidwell joined Chrysler in 1983 as executive vice
president in charge of sales, marketing and public relations.
He had been president and chief operating officer of Hertz
Corp., a rental car concern, since 1981. Prior to that, he
worked at Ford Motor Co. with Mr. Iacocca, ultimately rising
to head of all sales operations for North America.</p>
