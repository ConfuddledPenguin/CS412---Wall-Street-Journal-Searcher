	<p class="article-leader">LONDON -- Producer output prices, or prices of
manufactured goods, rose 0.5% in May from April, while
producer input prices, or prices of raw materials and fuels
purchased by manufacturing industry, fell 1.1%, Britain's
Central Statistical Office said.
   The agency said the year-on-year rise in output prices was
6.2%, which was the highest since 6.3% in December 1982. It
attributed the drop in input prices largely to lower fuel,
metal and electricity prices. Input prices were down 1.3%
from May 1989.</p>
