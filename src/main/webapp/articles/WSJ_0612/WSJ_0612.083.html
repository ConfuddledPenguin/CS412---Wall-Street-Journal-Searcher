	<p class="article-leader">LONDON -- Chief Inspector Jan Eachus stares past thick
bars at the suspect he dragged in the previous night, after a
fierce street fight. The suspect, known only as Bella, glares
back through smoldering black eyes. Bella doesn't have a rap
sheet, but Mr. Eachus knows this isn't her first offense.
"Just look at those scars," he says, pointing at raw marks
across Bella's powerful shoulders. "No question this one's
been in a scrap before."
   Mr. Eachus will tell this to the judge as evidence that
Bella, an American pit bull terrier, shouldn't have been
allowed to roam uncontrolled. Bella's handler could be fined
more than $3,000 or imprisoned for up to six months. Bella,
who ripped open a dachshund's throat and bit its owner's
hand, will pay the ultimate price. "See ya in doggy heaven,"
says Mr. Eachus, watching Bella gnaw at the bars of her cage.
Asked if there's anything a pit bull such as Bella won't
bite, Mr. Eachus responds, "A 747 jetliner -- flight."</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>England is renowned as a nation of dog lovers, a land
where corgis trail Queen Elizabeth II and where shoppers park
their poodles in a carpeted kennel at Harrods department
store. Queen Victoria even shared her deathbed with a
Pomeranian. But England's long affair with dogs has soured.
Aggressive breeds such as pit bulls and Rottweilers are
suddenly in vogue, and as their numbers have risen, so have
reports of dog attacks. The result is public panic,
Parliamentary debate and press headlines suggestive of "The
Hound of the Baskervilles":</p>
<p>"Devil Dog Scars Tot"</p>
<p>"Girl, 8, Scalped in Dog Horror."</p>
<p>England isn't the first country to do battle with
dangerous dogs, but it may be unique in the lethal force it
is deploying. Some animal wardens are arming themselves with
riot shields, chain mail, and ultrasonic stun guns. "Heroes
get bit," explains Mr. Eachus, an inspector with the Royal
Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (RSPCA),
which is often called to handle vicious dogs. In a country
where gun control is so strict that most police go unarmed,
Mr. Eachus is licensed to pack a .32 automatic pistol in his
van.</p>
<p>"We need that kind of weaponry to control humans, not
dogs," Micky Niego, an official with the American Society for
the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, says of the varied
English arsenal. Some U.S. wardens carry tranquilizing darts
and Mace, but most prefer nets and rods with loops.</p>
<p>The English say their situation demands special tactics.
Unlike the U.S., where rabies has led to tight animal
control, England is free of the disease and has no dog
licensing, no leash law and, in many areas, no dog wardens.
England's pet-obsessed public also can be feral in defending
animal rights. "The English worry more about the welfare of
poor little pooch than they do about the safety of Joe
Public," says Mr. Eachus, an American who has been living in
England since 1977.</p>
<p>The English also resist the notion that some breeds may be
tough to tame. "People think a little loving care will turn
pit bulls into nice pets," says Roger Mugford, an animal
psychologist in London. "They're wrong." Mr. Mugford echoes
the view of many English experts in describing the dogs as
fearless, almost immune to pain, "and able to turn from
playful jokers into psychopathic killers without a moment's
warning."</p>
<p>Some dog warriors are taking no chances. Standing beside
her van in the north England city of Bradford, Pat Harwood
dons the latest in canine battle dress. Long blond curls
vanish beneath a visored helmet designed for riot control by
the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. Hands slip into
elbow-length gloves. She cradles a reinforced plastic
"Armadillo Tactical Riot Shield," used by police to repel
missiles. Her tall frame is enveloped by a zip-up jump suit,
lined with chain mesh and heavily padded.</p>
<p>"I feel like I'm inside a Brillo Pad," says the warden,
her voice muffled by the helmet's visor. Ms. Harwood uses the
suit only for emergencies, but she never patrols without her
"Dazer," a pocket-sized weapon designed to startle dogs with
a high-frequency squeal. "It's important to intimidate," says
her boss, senior warden Terry Singh.</p>
<p>Some say such gladiators are barking up the wrong tree.
"If you approach a pit bull looking like a creature from
Mars, he's more likely to go berserk and bite you," says
Kevin McNicholas, a veteran London dog warden.</p>
<p>Answering a call on his van's radio phone, Mr. McNicholas
races to a suburban home whose residents are alarmed by a
gnashing sound from an adjoining yard. He finds a huge German
shepherd ripping apart the fence between the two yards with
its fangs. When the dog bounds toward him, Mr. McNicholas
kneels, clicks his tongue and slips a rope around the dog's
neck. "It doesn't need to be Waterloo every time you take a
dog in," he says, calmly guiding the animal into his van.</p>
<p>On another call, an anxious woman points into her
neighbor's yard, where two dummies hang from trees, their
pants legs in shreds. The woman says her neighbors often
stand in the yard shouting "Kill]" as two pit bulls tear the
effigies apart. Mr. McNicholas's advice: If the dogs come
close, stand perfectly still, avoid eye contact, and, if
possible, whimper like a puppy. "Dog biscuits also help," he
says. The most lethal weapon he has ever employed is a fire
extinguisher. In eight years of service, he hasn't been
bitten.</p>
<p>Many other officials haven't been so lucky. There were
7,717 dog attacks on mailmen last year; dozens of police were
injured. London police also are receiving twice as many calls
about dangerous dogs as they did just six months ago. While
fatal attacks remain rare (one or two a year compared to an
average of 15 in the U.S.), there now are an estimated
500,000 strays on English streets and crowded dog pounds with
cages marked "Mad] Take Care]"</p>
<p>Despite strong lobbying by police, postmen, the RSPCA and
other groups, Parliament narrowly rejected a dog registration
law in May. But the government now is considering banning
some breeds, or requiring that such dogs be muzzled in
public. "It sounds like hysteria until a Rottweiler chews
your kid to pieces," says Bill Wadman-Taylor, a veterinarian
and head of the Battersea Dogs Home in London.</p>
<p>Bill Edmond, head of Britain's Kennel Club, says the RSPCA
and other groups are overreacting. "The problem is people,
not dogs," he says. "Irresponsible owners can make any dog
vicious." His organization opposes dog licensing and other
restrictions "because the people who are neglecting their
dogs, or training them to attack, are the very same people
who won't comply with the licensing law."</p>
<p>The RSPCA's Mr. Eachus doesn't hesitate to get tough with
both mad dogs and Englishmen. The chain-smoking inspector has
shot two dogs to death and donned riot gear to take in many
others. In his van, he carries a forensic kit containing a
magnifying glass, camera and tweezers to collect evidence
such as dried blood and dogs' hair for use in prosecuting
owners.</p>
<p>"There's no room for amateurism here," says the veteran
enforcer. He can quote chapter and verse from English dog
law, such as the 1847 statute citing owners for "suffering to
be at large a ferocious unmuzzled dog," and more recent laws
regarding the fouling of sidewalks with what some
euphemistically call "dog-logs."</p>
<p>Mr. Eachus predicts that the craze for pit bulls and other
macho dogs will peak in a few years, as it has in the U.S. In
the meantime, though, "we need to get dangerous dogs off the
street and their owners behind bars," he says.</p>
<p>Officials fear, however, that another creature may soon
terrorize England. The RSPCA recently received a panicked
phone call reporting that a wild boar was running amok in a
London street. It turned out to be a Vietnamese pot-bellied
pig, a faddish pet in America that is just now reaching
English shores.</p>
