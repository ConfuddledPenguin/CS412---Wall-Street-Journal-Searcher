	<p class="article-leader">Ultimate Corp., East Hanover, N.J., bought from Midlantic
National Bank, 575,000 Ultimate shares, which the bank had
received as part of a personal bankruptcy-law settlement made
by former Ultimate Chairman Theodore Sabarese.
   Ultimate paid $6.50 a share, or $3.7 million, for the
block, leaving the computer-systems concern with 8.9 million
shares outstanding.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Last June, Mr. Sabarese resigned as Ultimate's chairman
and made a personal filing in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in
Newark, N.J. In a recent Securities and Exchange Commission
filing, he disclosed the settlement with the bank and said
that he might bid to take over Ultimate. He couldn't be
reached for comment.</p>
<p>Midlantic is a subsidiary of Midlantic Corp., Edison, N.J.</p>
