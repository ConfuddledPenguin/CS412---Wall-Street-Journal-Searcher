	<p class="article-leader">Sara Lee Corp., Chicago, said its bakery operation plans
to close a plant in Deerfield, Ill., and dismiss the
facility's 500 workers by March 1.
   The food concern's bakery unit, which has about 4,500
employees, also said it will trim its administrative staff by
about 100 employees.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The Deerfield plant's production of frozen baked goods
will be shifted to other facilities, the company said. The
closure "is necessary for us to remain competitive," said an
official. A spokeswoman noted that the plant, built in 1964,
lacks certain production capabilities the newer plants have.</p>
<p>Sara Lee has a total world-wide work force of about
100,000.</p>
