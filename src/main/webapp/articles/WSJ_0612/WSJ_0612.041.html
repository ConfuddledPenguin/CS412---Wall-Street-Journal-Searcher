	<p class="article-leader">Possibly this week, the nation is to have a new threatened
species in the spotted owl of the Pacific Northwest. Whenever
the announcement comes from federal officials, it likely will
overshadow another significant side issue in the logging wars
raging on the West Coast: the always precarious state of
international trade.
   How is the tiny, obscure bird tied into Japanese-U.S.
relations? Because the attempt to shield it from the
predations of a harvested habitat cues another kind of
protectionism: a legislative shuffle to save a domestic
industry. This time that familiar game has an unusual twist
-- the barring not of imports but of raw-log exports.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The "old-growth" region of the Northwest is one of the
richest timber lodes on Earth -- the "El Dorado of
silvaculture," in environmental economist John Baden's words.
Unlike some surrounding U.S. Forest Service areas, he says,
these stands don't require implicit subsidies from the U.S.
government to make cutting viable. A single tree might yield
enough wood for four homes.</p>
<p>The spotted-owl ruling will stop much of the cutting of
firs, hemlocks and spruce from federal lands, which account
for about a fifth of the Washington State's harvest, and most
of Oregon's. (Private parcels, a big part of Washington's
yield and greater still of Northern California's redwoods,
are indirectly hit because they're subject to lawsuits under
the statute.)</p>
<p>Timber mills in the region stand to be big losers from
this. Since 1973, when exports of logs from federal lands in
the West were banned, the domestic mills have had the pick of
that wood, which could no longer command the world price. The
mills and their 56,000 workers rely on this indirect subsidy
to keep their costs competitive. Now that wood is to belong
instead to the owls.</p>
<p>So the mill operators have turned to the logging on state
lands, which is most significantly a factor in Washington.
Efforts to restrict the export of this timber have been
resisted for years not only by growers but also by port
interests and by school districts, which rely on the sales
for funding.</p>
<p>The logjam is breaking -- but in Washington, D.C. There, a
provision of legislation by Sen. Robert Packwood, an Oregon
Republican and normally a free trader, would seem to override
Washington's Constitution to empower its governor to bar
export of timber from state lands within two years. And Gov.
Booth Gardner appears ready to do that.</p>
<p>Mr. Packwood has tied this measure to a priority Caribbean
Basin trade bill. He's got going for him not only the mills
but the environmental lobby, which figures that eliminating
much of the market for the wood can only save more trees. It
also helps that he's targeting Japan, where the preference
for wood prepared in one of its own 18,000 sawmills is
thought to reflect another of those non-tariff barriers that
hamper American finished goods.</p>
<p>Further aiding the bill, the big-timber lobby has signed
on to a Packwood compromise with Washington congressmen in
the hope of preventing an export-ban encroachment into
privately owned forests. Such a step might seem a remarkable
leap over property rights -- perhaps a "taking" under the
U.S. Constitution -- but no one can be sure of any asset in
the volatile logging politics of the West. Scary new
projections of old-growth forest decline are fueling
environmental activism, as well as a rush by loggers to cut
while the law still permits it. Summer strife looms in the
California redwoods, where protesters may try physically to
halt operations, and voters in the state may use the
initiative ballot to saw the industry off at the knees in
November.</p>
<p>So in Washington State, at least, Big Timber is content to
carve out some limits it can live with. Contract loggers who
work the public lands may not be so lucky. Also to be
affected are thousands of small timber growers who don't sell
export-quality logs; the price for their cuttings at the
domestic mills stands to be driven down again by an onrush of
formally exportable supply. And the schools and other public
agencies that face a drop-off in revenues will have to look
for alternatives. (At least that's a case of protectionist
costs being borne publicly, as they should be.)</p>
<p>It's hard to anticipate all of the derivative effects of
any intervention in the economy, but Nick Kirkmire, a onetime
commercial forester who serves as a reluctant lobbyist for
Big Timber in this matter, offers another. He thinks that,
just as Japanese companies moved their car assembly to the
U.S. in order to get around import limits, so they will set
up their own mills in the Northwest to produce lumber to the
particular standards of the home market and thus beat a log
export ban. Nothing wrong with that, but it's probably not
what the promoters of this latest sop to a domestic industry
have in mind.</p>
<p>For the junior senator from Oregon, who faces a
potentially tough re-election battle in 1992, this is a
chance to stake out both the "jobs" and "trees" vote. For
Rep. John Miller, a conservative Republican, and other House
members from Washington who've been delicately negotiating a
deal, the incentive is similar, with the added impetus of
heading off the more absolutist Oregon opposition to
exporting.</p>
<p>Quiet in all of this is the U.S. Trade Representative's
office. The bill's sponsors are confident that the General
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade would allow restrictions in
this special case.</p>
<p>GATT shouldn't. Packwood's Putsch is destined to give the
term "environmental protection" a new meaning. The
spotted-owl episode is a good example of how green politics,
now flowering in much of the world, can be a cover for the
sophisticated maneuvers by various interest groups that
barely give a hoot about ecology. Elsewhere on Capitol Hill,
the notorious Archer-Daniels-Midland Co., with its
self-interested championing of grain-based fuels, is a
pioneer at this.</p>
<p>The soundest way to obtain the environmental safeguards
that the people want, free of third-party spoils, is to work
to assign market values to natural resources. Where property
rights can be established, pricing will take care of itself;
a rougher estimation might suffice in less tangible or
demarcated situations. Then society can make straightforward
decisions about whether to preserve resources by incurring
the costs directly, as the economist Mr. Baden happens to
favor doing in the old-growth timber case. (He considers the
northern spotted owl a goner anyhow, but believes the host
ecosystem to be precious.) Private interests that may have
their contractural rights infringed on should be duly
compensated, just as they themselves would no longer be able
to take freely from a "commons" of clean air, water and the
like.</p>
<p>That would be honest environmentalism instead of political
gamesmanship. It would be good news for the planet and our
progeny, if not for congressmen and certain cozy
constituents.</p>
