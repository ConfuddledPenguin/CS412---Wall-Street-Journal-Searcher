	<p class="article-leader">JUSTICES STRUCK DOWN a federal law against desecrating the

political battle in Congress to pass a constitutional
amendment protecting the flag. The justices also ruled that
the federal government may order state National Guard troops
to participate in peacetime training abroad without a
governor's consent.</p>

wait of up to five years.</p>
