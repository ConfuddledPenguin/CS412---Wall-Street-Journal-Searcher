	<p class="article-leader">CUPERTINO, Calif. -- The semiconductor industry's leading
indicator rose in May, as the industry's modest rebound from
depressed sales in the last half of 1989 continued.
   The Semiconductor Industry Association said the so-called
book-to-bill ratio for May was 1.14:1, up from 1.09:1 in
April. Both figures are preliminary. A 1.14 rate means that
for every $100 of products shipped, or billed, chip makers
received $114 in new orders, or bookings.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The rising indicator reflects a stable market that has so
far escaped the slump that many in the industry expected in
1990, though some in the industry were reluctant to predict
any incipient boom. "It's certainly a positive sign, but the
long-term impact remains to be seen," said Tom Beerman, a
spokesman for the semiconductor association.</p>
<p>Semiconductor billings in May were $1.18 billion, 5.7%
above April's $1.11 billion and 4.5% lower than a year
earlier, when billings totaled $1.23 billion.</p>
<p>Average monthly orders for the three months ended in May
totaled $1.38 billion, 7.8% above April's figure of $1.28
billion about 8% above the year-earlier figure of $1.28
billion.</p>
