	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- The creditors' committee of Drexel Burnham
Lambert Group Inc. postponed filing its own proposed
reorganization plan for the securities concern.
   Last week, the committee had said it would include the
proposal in its motion opposing an extension of Drexel's
"exclusivity period," the time period in which only Drexel
can officially propose a reorganization plan under Chapter 11
of the federal Bankruptcy Code.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Instead, according to people close to the case, an
agreement has been reached to extend the period until
mid-November. That would give Drexel time to further develop
its preliminary reorganization proposal, which was panned by
the creditors' committee. The creditors had criticized the
proposal for being too vague and for leaving current
management in charge of the company.</p>
<p>Attorneys for Drexel and the creditors didn't return phone
calls seeking comment. A spokesman for the company said no
comment would be made until a hearing today before U.S.
Bankruptcy Court Judge Howard Buschman III.</p>
