	<p class="article-leader">L. Gordon Crovitz's lucid recapitulation of the America's
Cup legal fiasco (Rule of Law, May 16), was on the mark, but
didn't go quite far enough. There are two additional aspects
of the imbroglio that warrant attention before we move from
the legal shoals of New York to the waters off San Diego in
1992.
   First, the so-called "loophole" in the America's Cup Deed
has always been there, but nobody entertained serious
thoughts of a maverick challenge (as did New Zealander
Michael Fay) because chances of victory in the New York
courts were zero as long as the New York Yacht Club held the
Cup. When the trophy went from New York to Australia in 1983,
it should be noted that there were no attempts by Mr. Fay to
skirt the rules and prevailing methods of challenge because
such renegade action on his part would have made him a pariah
in that part of the world. It wasn't until the San Diego
Yacht Club had the effrontery to win the Cup in 1987 that Mr.
Fay started scheming.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Second, the peculiar maneuvering of New York Supreme Court
Justice Carmen Beauchamp Ciparick in the whole affair was
indeed strange. This justice was asked to rule on the
legality of a catamaran prior to the race that led to the
forfeiture, but she declined to do so. Instead, on July 25,
1988 -- more than a month before the controversial race --
she advised the participants to proceed with the contest,
telling them that a ruling would be forthcoming after the
race. Then, seven months after the race won by the San Diego
Yacht Club's catamaran, she ruled that use of a catamaran
"violated the spirit" of the Deed of Gift, and accordingly
awarded the Cup to New Zealand] Had she so ruled before the
race (as requested) there would have been no catamaran
defense and consequently no forfeiture. Had this been a
criminal proceeding, the appellate courts may well have
labeled this judicial misconduct and/or reversible error. In
football parlance, a trap play.</p>

<p>Mr. Crovitz's column was entirely correct except for one
egregious error. That was the description of Judge Tyler as
"Landlubber Harold Tyler argued for San Diego."</p>
<p>To keep the record straight, you may wish to know that
Harold Tyler comes from Waterville in Oneida County, N.Y.
Waterville is at the site of Nine Mile Swamp, a very
impressive body of water with which Judge Tyler has long been
familiar. During the l9th century, Nine Mile Swamp, as well
as many other bodies of water in beautiful Oneida County have
been used in war and peace as important waterways and
refuges. The well-known horse thieves known as the Loomis
gang had a secret headquarters in Nine Mile Swamp. They made
so much trouble, and so intimidated juries, that at one point
the vigilantes of Waterville rousted them out and lynched
most of them.</p>
<p>One of these fellows was named Plum Loomis, a very young
boy at the time. The vigilantes overlooked some of the gang
who burst out of the swamp in the Lafitte tradition of the
Battle of New Orleans, and rescued Plum, who was then
vigorously kicking at the end of the rope.</p>
<p>When Judge Tyler was very young, and Plum Loomis was very
old, they used to converse in the Waterville town square. It
was said that Plum would then exhibit the rope scars on his
neck, as partial explanation of why he never wore a necktie.
Neither Plum nor the judge could be properly described as
landlubbers. I hope that an appropriate correction will be
recorded.</p>
