	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- For a handful of funds, doing well consists of
doing very little.
   Take Source Capital, a publicly traded fund managed by
George Michaelis. This fund typically hangs on to a stock for
three years or so, compared with 15 months for the average
fund manager.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The result of all this inactivity? Mr. Michaelis's fund
has returned 19.3% a year in the past decade, well ahead of
the 17.7% notched up by the Standard & Poor's 500 stocks and
16% for the average stock fund.</p>
<p>The secret: Mr. Michaelis tries to buy low-debt companies
with high, sustainable returns on equity that are trading
below the market's multiple of earnings. And then he holds
the stocks for a long time.</p>
<p>"If you're successful in identifying such businesses, you
almost win by default," he says. "If you own a portfolio of
companies that earn returns on equity of 20% or 25% over long
periods of time, you can't help but be successful unless you
pay an absurdly high price" for each stock.</p>
<p>This brand of buy-and-hold investing has been made
respectable by the legendary value investor Warren Buffett,
chairman of Berkshire Hathaway Inc., who is fond of saying,
"Our favorite holding period is forever." Among Berkshire's
core stockholdings are Coca-Cola Co. and Washington Post Co.,
both of which boast impressive returns on equity.</p>
<p>Mr. Michaelis got his stock picking education at the hands
of Charles Munger, Berkshire's vice chairman and Mr.
Buffett's longtime business partner. Shortly after Mr.
Michaelis joined Source Capital in 1971, a Berkshire
subsidiary bought 20% of Source's stock.</p>
<p>Why does Mr. Michaelis zero in on companies with high and
sustainable returns on equity? Because a company with a high
return can compound its retained earnings at a brisk pace.
Even if a stock's multiple of earnings doesn't change, the
stock's price will rise as retained earnings are compounded.
A company with a steady 19% return on equity will double its
earnings every four years if it plows back all profit into
the business.</p>
<p>Mr. Michaelis has recently been buying stock of Minnesota
Mining & Manufacturing Co. The company, whose long list of
products include specialty chemicals, adhesive tape and
printing plates, has averaged a return on equity of almost
21% a year in the past five years, but it trades at less than
15 times its trailing 12-month earnings.</p>
<p>What convinces Mr. Michaelis that Minnesota Mining can
sustain that high return on equity? "A lot of companies have
high profitability because they have one great business that
carries the show," he says. "This is a very broadly based
business with thousands of product lines. It doesn't have a
franchise as clearly definable as Coca-Cola or Kellogg's corn
flakes. The profitability is more the result of a high level
of research and development."</p>
<p>Source Capital is a so-called closed-end fund. Unlike a
regular mutual fund, a closed-end fund issues a fixed number
of shares, which then trade publicly just like any other
stock.</p>
<p>Source's shares closed yesterday at $41 in New York Stock
Exchange composite trading, just barely below its portfolio
value of $41.04 a share.</p>
<p>One of Mr. Michaelis's colleagues at Los Angeles's First
Pacific Advisors, Christopher Linden, follows the same
approach for the mutual fund he runs, the $60 million FPA
Perennial. Among the stocks that Mr. Linden thinks are
reasonably priced are Melville Corp., a specialty retailer,
and Washington Federal Savings & Loan Association of Seattle,
one of the best-capitalized thrifts in the country. Both
trade at a discount to the market's price-earnings ratio of
17 but have five-year average returns on equity of well over
20%.</p>
<p>"Over a long period of time, shareholders' returns and
those of the company are going to be similar," Mr. Linden
says.</p>
<p>Other mutual funds also follow this buy-and-hold strategy.
Despite the recent lackluster performance of small companies'
stocks, GIT Equity Trust-Special Growth has posted impressive
gains by buying and holding small company stocks. Over the
past five years, the fund has had an average annual portfolio
turnover of less than 26%, compared with 80% for the average
stock mutual fund.</p>
<p>But in the category of snail-paced trading, Century Shares
Trust takes the prize. The fund has averaged turnover of just
3.5% a year for the past decade. Century Shares, which
concentrates its assets in insurance stocks with high returns
on equity, is a firm favorite of Gerald Perritt, editor of
the Mutual Fund Letter, a Chicago-based newsletter.</p>
<p>Mr. Perritt began recommending the fund in August 1988
because he thought the fund's holdings would benefit as
interest rates fell and the cycle for property/casualty
insurance rates turned upward.</p>
<p>But Mr. Perritt now figures that the fund is a good buy
solely for its low-turnover investment strategy. "We're still
looking at the potential for lower interest rates," he says.
"And if you have a recession, the insurance stocks won't be
affected like the cyclicals would be."</p>

<p>Instead of buying and selling like crazy, the funds below
get their edge by investing in top quality companies and then
hanging on for the ride.</p>
