	<p class="article-leader">SEATTLE -- Boeing Co., as expected, received an order from
Korean Airlines for 23 747-400s.
   The aerospace giant valued the order at $4.8 billion,
including spare parts and training, in delivery-year dollars.
It is one of the largest orders ever placed with Boeing, the
world's leading commercial jet maker.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The news sent Boeing's stock soaring. The company's shares
closed in New York Stock Exchange composite trading at
$58.50, up $3.50. (A 3-for-2 stock split, announced in April,
kicked in yesterday.)</p>
<p>Korean Airlines's 747-400s are configured to carry as many
as 392 passengers in a three-class seating arrangement. The
planes are capable of operating at nonstop ranges of more
than 8,000 miles, and will be used to connect Korea to
destinations in Europe and North America.</p>
<p>The booking brings total orders of the 747-400 to 307
aircraft, of which 71 have now been delivered. For the year,
carriers have ordered from Boeing 243 aircraft valued at
$19.3 billion. That compares with 596 planes valued at $32.5
billion in the year-ago period.</p>
<p>The decrease partly reflects the fact that the two largest
orders in Boeing history, from UAL Corp.'s United Airlines
unit and GPA Group Ltd., both came in April 1989.</p>
