	<p class="article-leader">SAN FRANCISCO -- With two questions, Maya Beach destroys
the decorum of a Family Life class at George Washington High
School here.
   "How can two ladies have sex?" the slim ninth-grader asks.
"That's impossible, isn't it?"</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"No, it isn't," yells another student, cutting off guest
speakers Michael Shugert and Anna Chang before they can
answer. Amid uproar and laughter, students shout out bawdy
anatomical solutions until the speakers, a homosexual man and
a lesbian, describe what they do in bed. Students wince. Soon
the questions grow hostile:</p>
<p>"After you had sex with your partner, did you feel
guilty?" "Haven't you ever thought what you were doing was
wrong?" "Why do gay males act so feminine?" "If you adopt
kids, won't you make them lesbians?"</p>
<p>Ms. Chang pauses after one pointed query, takes off her
glasses and rubs her face slowly with an open hand. Mr.
Shugert finally gives up. "You don't have to like us," he
implores. "Just try not to hate us enough to hit us over the
head with baseball bats."</p>
<p>Speakers like Ms. Chang and Mr. Shugert lecture in San
Francisco classrooms regularly in a program aimed at curbing
violence against homosexuals by introducing them to students.
"Some of us call it Gay 101," jokes Mr. Shugert.</p>
<p>Such talks are part of spreading efforts in schools both
to teach more about homosexuality and to help alienated gay
students. The National Education Association, the largest
teachers' union, has endorsed making gay-teen counseling
available in every school and is designing a training course
to help teachers talk about homosexuality.</p>
<p>New York City, which already has a small public high
school for gay students and a homosexual-guest-speakers
program, is considering a seventh-grade social studies
elective on homosexuals' fight for better treatment. Los
Angeles, Minneapolis-St. Paul and Seattle have special
counseling or AIDS-education programs for gay teen-agers that
operate in schools or get referrals from school staff.</p>
<p>"It used to be that you couldn't even say the word
{homosexual} in the classroom or in a textbook," says Patty
Ann Whiting, former senior editor for health at
Glencoe/McGraw-Hill textbook publishers. "Now it's getting a
lot more attention."</p>
<p>The higher profile of homosexuals in the schools has
angered some parents and traditional groups, including
Christian educational activists. Critics say that teaching
acceptance of homosexuality to impressionable adolescents is
tantamount to promoting it, and that classroom discussion of
homosexuality is often too graphic. Detractors are also upset
that under some counseling programs, minors who say they are
homosexual or confused about their sexual orientation can be
referred by schools to gay adult groups without parental
knowledge or consent.</p>
<p>"I have a problem with promoting homosexuality within the
school system," says Karen Schappert, a mother of two
schoolchildren in San Francisco, who is opposed to a proposed
counseling service for gay students there. "This kind of
program would serve a very small segment of the population,
when {we} have friends with a child who is partially deaf and
hasn't had a speech pathologist in two years."</p>
<p>In San Francisco and Madison, Wis., gay activists'
advocacy of expanded homosexual-oriented programs or
curricula has touched off heated political wrangling.</p>
<p>AIDS has helped force the once-taboo subject of
homosexuality into the classroom. Thirty-three states and 80%
of large school districts now mandate AIDS-prevention
education, with more considering it. "You can't do AIDS
prevention if you can't talk about people who have loving
same-sex relations," says Anne Thompson Cook, a consultant to
the NEA.</p>
<p>Yet schools that make more than a passing reference to
homosexuality are still in the minority. Sex-education groups
estimate that only about a third of schools discuss
homosexuality explicitly. AIDS "is being taught as biology
and virology," says Debra Haffner, executive director of the
Sex Information and Education Council of the U.S., a
foundation-financed group in New York. Instead of saying that
AIDS is commonly transmitted by homosexuals through anal
intercourse, Ms. Haffner says, health teachers only "talk
about exchange of bodily fluids."</p>
<p>Another reason for schools' greater attention to gay
concerns is a growing awareness of how desperate homosexual
teen-agers can become. Often terrified of telling anyone they
are attracted to the same sex, and mercilessly hazed or
ostracized if they do, gay teens drop out more and abuse
drugs more. A 1988 study commissioned by the U.S. Department
of Health and Human Services found gay adolescents commit
suicide at two to three times the rate of heterosexuals, and
some studies say that 40% of all homosexuals make attempts on
their lives when young.</p>
<p>"The hardest part was not being able to talk to anyone
about what was going on," says Kathleen Ayotte, who graduated
from the University of Illinois last month and plans to
attend graduate school next year. At high school in suburban
Chicago, Ms. Ayotte adds, "The only time homosexuals ever
came up was when they were the butt of jokes."</p>
<p>Ms. Ayotte developed an unrequited crush on her closest
girlfriend in high school. When the girlfriend grew
uncomfortable with her doting and told her she no longer
wanted to be friends, Ms. Ayotte forced 30 sleeping pills
down her throat. Quick medical attention saved her, and later
therapy has helped Ms. Ayotte adjust. Lately, she has been
talking to teachers in Champaign-Urbana -- in support of a
proposed counseling service for gay teens there.</p>
<p>Debate over how schools should treat students who think
they may be homosexual heated up a school-board election in
Madison, Wis., last month. Incumbent member Earl Kielley
accused the schools of wanting to "promote a homosexual life
style" with a proposed health-class goal of ensuring that
ninth-graders "will be accepting of an individual whose
sexual orientation is different from his or her own."</p>
<p>Mr. Kielley also objected to a training seminar for
teachers that included a session on lesbian literature, and a
gay-community directory that counselors receive to tell
students with "gender identity" questions where they can get
advice. The directory included a listing for a gay video club
that distributes explicit materials and another for a group
calling itself Gay Pagan Men, whose listing said they "seek
the queer spirit powers."</p>
<p>School-district management, which prides itself on
promoting "multi-culturalism," accused Mr. Kielley and his
local allies of exaggeration. The directory wasn't given to
students, says curriculum director Elaine Lohr, and the
health-class goals stemmed partly from anti-homosexual
name-calling in the schools. "We are teaching about
homosexuality, not teaching students to become homosexuals,"
she says. Mr. Kielley lost the election decisively, as did
another incumbent endorsed by a local religious group.</p>
<p>Advocates of more gay-oriented programs argue that
reducing anti-gay prejudice can be an important weapon
against acquired immune deficiency syndrome. "AIDS is a
disease that is all about racism, homophobia and
discrimination," says Gary Remafedi, a pediatrics professor
at the University of Minnesota. "Those underlying factors
perpetuate the epidemic."</p>
<p>He contends society inadvertently prods adolescents who
think they are homosexual toward more sexual activity.
Traditional school counselors tell them they can't know they
are gay until they reach adulthood and have sexual experience
-- so they experiment, Prof. Remafedi says. Because they fear
others will discover them and make their lives miserable, he
adds, they also have relations with the opposite sex to give
the impression they aren't gay.</p>
<p>Honesty isn't necessarily the best policy. Gregory
Cartwright, a San Francisco shoe salesman, was openly
homosexual while attending Glendale High School in suburban
Los Angeles. But high school was "humiliating and pathetic,"
Mr. Cartwright says. "I had `Stop AIDS' written on my locker.
I was beaten up three times in six months, and all three
times the attackers repeatedly called me `fag.'"</p>
<p>On the verge of dropping out, he heard about Project 10, a
counseling service for gay students in L.A.'s Fairfax High
School, so he transferred. Project 10 introduced him to
successful gay adults, he says, and helped him feel accepted.
At graduation, he was chosen as one of three commencement
speakers. Mr. Cartwright believes that "without Project 10 I
definitely wouldn't have finished high school."</p>
<p>Conservative Christians and others have fought a running
battle against Project 10 and its director, Virginia Uribe,
for about three years. The Rev. Louis Sheldon, president of
the Traditional Values Coalition in Anaheim, says referring
students to gay groups and gay literature isn't balanced
counseling. He wants Project 10 to tell students that
choosing heterosexuality is a possible solution.</p>
<p>"Our problem is not that they want to help or advise
homosexuals," says Mr. Sheldon. "But this is a recruitment
program, an advocacy program. Nowhere does Virginia Uribe
offer a statistic or advice that says that a gender identity
crisis can be resolved" in favor of heterosexuality.</p>
<p>He also objects to Project 10's referral of minors to gay
groups without the consent of their parents, some of whom may
not even know their children are homosexual or having
difficulty at school. But Mrs. Uribe says fear of parental
reaction is often part of the reason students come to her.</p>
<p>Project 10 has faced other vocal critics. Talks to
students around Los Angeles have been scaled back after
parental complaints and heated reactions at some schools.
"God created Adam and Eve," one combative student at a
largely Hispanic school told Mrs. Uribe, "not Adam and
Steve."</p>
<p>In 1988, Mrs. Uribe agreed to stop distributing a book,
"One Teenager in Ten," to students she was counseling. The
book includes a passage in which a young lesbian recounts the
first time she had oral sex performed on her. Jackie
Goldberg, president of the school board, says that this
action was insignificant and that the board unanimously
supports Project 10. Mrs. Uribe, she says, also urges
students to stay in school, avoid drugs and refrain from sex
until they are adults.</p>
<p>Three school-board members in San Francisco have proposed
a program like Project 10 for that city, touching off bitter
antipathies. Superintendent Raymond Cortines originally
opposed the plan, saying schools had to be "very careful
about enticing young people as it relates to their sexual
orientation."</p>
<p>Last month, about 100 gays packed a school-board meeting
to demand quick consideration of the plan. With a bewildered
delegation of Soviet exchange students looking on,
demonstrators marched outside chanting "Two-four-six-eight,
how do you know your kids are straight?" and "We're here,
we're queer, we're not playing football."</p>
<p>Inside, parent Mark Poggioli rose to speak against the
plan. He accused gays of trying to indoctrinate students.
Gays jeered him and other speakers, disrupted the meeting
with calls for a vote, and even heckled a Russian exchange
teacher giving an unrelated slide show on the Caucasus
Mountains. Woeful tales -- of suicidal friends, "unremitting
abuse" and "hellish" days in school -- were recounted by gay
speakers. Debate about the plan, said supporter Tim Wolfred,
had "tapped a large reservoir of pain."</p>
