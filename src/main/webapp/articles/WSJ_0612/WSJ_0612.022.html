	<p class="article-leader">Your May 3 article "Tobacco Critics See a Subtle Sell to
Kids" recounted the anti-smoking-movement charges that we are
marketing our cigarettes to minors. We are not. Philip Morris
USA is the largest cigarette company in the U.S. Last year we
sold 220 billion cigarettes. A small number of these
cigarettes are unfortunately obtained by minors.
   We at Philip Morris do not want minors to smoke. Smoking
is an adult custom. Maturity of judgment is necessary to
making a responsible, informed decision about smoking. As a
matter of policy, we do not market cigarettes to minors. We
employ only adult models in our advertising who not only are
but look over 25. We don't have celebrities or athletes
endorse cigarettes in our advertising.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Every serious study of why minors smoke points toward
family and friends, not cigarette-company marketing
practices. Indeed, there are no significant differences in
smoking incidence among minors between otherwise comparable
countries that allow tobacco advertising and those that
prohibit it. According to the Federal Trade Commission,
tobacco-marketing expenditures in the U.S. have tripled since
1977. During that same period, the University of Michigan
reports smoking among high-school seniors has dropped by more
than one third -- from 29% to 18%. This decline is rooted not
in marketing restrictions but in education including a
program, "Helping Youth Decide," sponsored by the tobacco
industry.</p>
<p>As your article notes, Philip Morris has taken legal
action against companies that use our cigarette trademarks in
products that appeal to youth, and we caused a manufacturer
to remove the Marlboro logo from its computer video games.</p>
<p>The most effective ways to stop minors from smoking are to
educate youth and make it clear to retailers that it is
illegal for them to sell cigarettes to minors. This approach
has reduced the number of minors who smoke by more than
one-third over the past 15 years and we at Philip Morris hope
and believe it will continue to do so in the future.</p>
