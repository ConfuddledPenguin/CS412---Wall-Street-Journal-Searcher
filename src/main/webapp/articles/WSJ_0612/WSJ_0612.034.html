	<p class="article-leader">PARIS -- French President Francois Mitterrand has approved
a plan under which French government-owned concerns will try
to take majority control of Framatome S.A., effectively
nationalizing France's nuclear power-plant builder,
presidential aides said.
   The decision reflects the continued willingness of
France's Socialist-led government to get involved in
industrial disputes when it believes the national interest is
at stake. In this case, France is more than 70%-dependent on
nuclear power for its electricity, the highest dependence
rate in the world. The government wants to ensure it controls
the main decisions at Framatome.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>If the nationalization plan works, it would foil a plan by
France's large private-sector maker of electrical machinery,
telephone equipment and trains, Cie. Generale d'Electricite,
which holds 40% of Framatome, to gain majority control. CGE
said in March it intended to buy the 12% held by the
construction company Dumez S.A., on which CGE has first
refusal rights. The president seeks to block that. Until now,
the government considered Framatome's holdings balanced. The
state holds 45%, personnel the remaining 3%. Officials fear
that CGE's purchase plan would disrupt that balance.</p>
<p>The president's plan calls for government-owned concerns,
possibly including the bank Credit Lyonnais and the nuclear
fuel-processing concern Cogema S.A., to wind up with about
51%.</p>
