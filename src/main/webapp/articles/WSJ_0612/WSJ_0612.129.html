	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- An advisory committee of the Food and Drug
Administration recommended several changes in labeling for
Seldane, a prescription anti-allergy drug made by Marion
Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals Inc., a unit of Dow Chemical Co.
of Midland, Mich.
   The advisory committee suggested that the label be changed
to warn that an overdose of the drug could cause an irregular
heartbeat. It also recommended that the label warn that use
of the drug by patients suffering cirrhosis of the liver
could make it difficult for the drug to be metabolized
properly, thereby increasing the risk of heart disease. A
company spokesman couldn't be reached for comment.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The advisory committee also recommended approval for
Tilade, an anti-asthma drug manufactured by British-based
Fisons Corp. Advisory committee recommendations are usually
approved by the FDA.</p>
