	<p class="article-leader">LOS ANGELES -- Unocal Corp. said Union Exploration
Partners Ltd., a publicly traded entity that it created five
years ago to help fend off T. Boone Pickens Jr.'s hostile
advances, will be converted from a Texas master limited
partnership to a Delaware corporation, known as Unocal
Exploration Corp.
   Unocal said it was making the switch, in part, because of
recent tax law revisions. Unocal Chairman Richard Stegemeier
also cited "the improving climate for investments in domestic
oil and gas exploration and development." Unocal and its
Union Oil Co. of California subsidiary hold about 95% of the
outstanding units of Union Exploration Partners.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"A corporation is now generally a more efficient vehicle
for capital accumulation and reinvestment than a publicly
traded partnership," Mr. Stegemeier said. Earlier this year,
Unocal announced a 22% boost in its annual budgeted spending
for exploration and capital projects.</p>
<p>Union Oil, which acts as managing general partner of Union
Exploration Partners, projected in a Securities and Exchange
Commission filing that the change would be effective Aug. 1.
It is expected that each outstanding Union Exploration
Partners unit will be converted into a new common share of
Unocal Exploration, which will be traded on the New York and
Pacific stock exchanges.</p>
<p>Before that, on July 25, a special cash distribution will
be made to Union Exploration Partners unitholders of record
July 11. The pay-out will be equal to about 100% of the
partnership's estimated distributable cash for the four
months ended July 31. A Unocal spokesman said the company
couldn't speculate on the amount.</p>
<p>Unocal said Unocal Exploration's board intends to declare
quarterly common share cash dividends. It said the first
dividend is likely to be 10 cents a share, payable Nov. 15 to
shareholders of record Nov. 1.</p>
<p>In addition, Union Exploration Partners unit-holders will
be entitled to an extra cash distribution of up to $3 per
unit if, during pre-defined time periods, the average closing
price of Unocal Explorations's common stock falls below
$18.20 a share.</p>
<p>Eugene Nowak, oil analyst for Dean Witter Reynolds in New
York, said the move should give Unocal "more flexibility." He
said Unocal Exploration could become an acquisition vehicle
for Unocal, which has shed much of its debt in recent years.</p>
<p>In New York Stock Exchange composite trading, Union
Exploration Partners units closed at $16, down $2.25, as
investors faced the prospect of immediate reduced pay-outs.
They have been pocketing from the partnership more than 43
cents a unit quarterly for the past year.</p>
<p>Unocal closed on the Big Board yesterday at $28.75, down
25 cents.</p>
<p>As of the end of last year, Union Exploration Partners
controlled about 29% of Unocal's total U.S. proved reserves
of crude oil and about 59% of its U.S. proved reserves of
natural gas.</p>
