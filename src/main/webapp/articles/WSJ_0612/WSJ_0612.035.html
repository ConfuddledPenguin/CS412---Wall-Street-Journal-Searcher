	<p class="article-leader">TORONTO -- The two unions representing Canadian and U.S.
telecommunications industry workers said they concluded an
alliance that will allow them to support each other's
organizing, collective bargaining and research activities.
   Morton Bahr, president of the Communications Workers of
America, and Fred Pomeroy, president of the Communications
and Electrical Workers of Canada, said the agreement -- the
first of its kind -- is essential in negotiating with the
multinational corporations that dominate the industry.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"We've got to deliver the message that a company cannot
practice good labor relations in one place and be anti-union
in another," Mr. Bahr said.</p>
<p>He said the new alliance would allow the 700,000-member
CWA and the CWC, which represents 40,000 employees, to work
together in organizing employees of one company in both
countries.</p>
<p>The union leaders said they expect the alliance to
strengthen their bargaining clout with multinational
corporations.</p>
<p>A spokesman for Mississauga, Ontario-based Northern
Telecom Ltd., one of the large telecommunications companies
with operations in both the U.S. and Canada, said the
formation of the alliance "isn't surprising" given the degree
of globalization of the industry. But he declined further
comment until the company has had an opportunity to discuss
the move with union representatives.</p>
