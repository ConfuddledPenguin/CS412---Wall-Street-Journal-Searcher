	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Nestle Holdings Inc. consolidated several of
its U.S. businesses, forming new coffee and ice cream
companies and a new group to hold its Stouffer restaurant and
hotel operations.
   Nestle Holdings is the holding company for the U.S.
subsidiaries of Nestle S.A. of Switzerland.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Under the plan, Nestle combined Hills Bros. Coffee Co. and
the coffee units of Nestle Foods Co. to form Nestle/Hills
Coffee Co. The new company will have annual sales of about $1
billion and 3,000 employees and will have its headquarters in
San Francisco.</p>
<p>In addition, Nestle joined the ice cream and dairy
facilities of Carnation Co. with those of Nestle Foods Co.
The new entity, Nestle Ice Cream Co., will report to Nestle
Foods Co., Purchase, N.Y., and will market Carnation and
Nestle ice cream.</p>
<p>At Stouffers, Nestle merged Stouffer Restaurant Co. with
Stouffer Hotel Co., forming Stouffer Hospitality Group. It
will continue to have its headquarters in Cleveland.</p>
<p>James M. Biggar, chairman of Nestle Holdings, said the
moves were "aimed at increasing and improving our
effectiveness in the marketplace and to take advantage of
synergies" in Nestle's businesses. The changes should be
completed during the second half of 1990, he added.</p>
<p>A Nestle spokeswoman said revenue figures for the combined
Ice Cream and Stouffers businesses weren't available.</p>
<p>Asked about potential layoffs, the spokeswoman said its
"too early to make any predictions" on force consolidations.
She said the only executive change was the promotion of
Jeffrey Caso, former group vice president of Nestle Foods
Coffee & Tea division, to executive vice president of
Nestle/Hills Coffee Co.</p>
