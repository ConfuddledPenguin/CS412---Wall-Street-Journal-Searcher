	<p class="article-leader">KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia -- Despite credit constraints,
Malaysia's consumer price index in April rose 0.7% from
March, the steepest increase this year, the government
statistics department said.
   The index, in which the base of 100 is calculated with
1980 prices, rose to 136.6 from 135.7. The index, which
reflects retail prices of goods and services, was up 0.8%
from the end of December.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Averaging the rise in prices in the first four months of
this year, the index rose 2.3% from a year earlier,
registering inflation below official government projections
of about a 4% rate for this year. But many private analysts
have forecast a rate of at least 5%, as price pressures are
fueled by strong domestic demand in Malaysia's rapidly
expanding economy and accommodated by the relatively fast
growth of the money supply. The weighting of the index's
various parts doesn't fairly represent new consumption
patterns in the developing nation, the economists say, and
the index thus underestimates true inflation.</p>
