	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- A federal judge sentenced three retail
furniture businessmen on fraud and conspiracy charges in
connection with a scheme that defrauded investors of $52
million.
   Louis Bigman, 65 years old, of Douglaston, N.Y., was
sentenced to 46 months in prison. Ben Wernikoff, 64, of
Jericho, N.Y., and Henry Switsky, 61, of Marlboro, N.J., were
each sentenced to 37 months. The three men pleaded guilty in
federal court in Manhattan in January.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The defendants were charged with defrauding investors
through the sale of retail installment-loan agreements from
Alcor Trading Corp. and Marba Furniture Inc., two furniture
companies owned by Messrs. Bigman, Wernikoff and Switsky. The
investors were told that their money would be used to buy the
loan agreements at a sharp discount and that they would make
a profit of 15% to 22% when the defendants collected the full
amounts due under the installment loans.</p>
<p>Instead, according to the U.S. attorney's office in
Manhattan, the money was used to pay off earlier investors in
the scheme or to make unsecured loans -- which weren't repaid
-- to other companies owned by the defendants. The scheme
fell apart in March 1989 when Alcor and another company owned
by the defendants were placed in bankruptcy-law proceedings,
partly because investors sought the return of their money.</p>
<p>Although the defendants have agreed to try to make
restitution, the defrauded investors are expected to be
repaid less than 1% of the total owed to them, prosecutors
said.</p>
<p>Another defendant, Ira Goldstein, pleaded guilty to
conspiracy and will be sentenced Friday.</p>
