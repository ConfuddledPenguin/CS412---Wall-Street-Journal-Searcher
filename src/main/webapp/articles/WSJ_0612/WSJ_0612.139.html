	<p class="article-leader">COLUMBUS, Ohio -- Meret Inc. said it plans a reverse stock
split that will transform the retail consulting and design
concern into a privately held company.
   Under the plan, each 2,500 existing shares would be
converted to one new share. Holders owning fewer than 2,500
shares, or a number not divisible by 2,500, would receive 30
cents a share in cash for each current share that otherwise
would become a fractional share.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The company has 10.2 million shares outstanding, owned by
about 1,600 shareholders. Officers and directors control 46%
of the stock.</p>
<p>In over-the-counter trading yesterday, Meret shares closed
at 25 cents bid, unchanged.</p>
<p>The goal of the plan is to reduce the number of
shareholders to less than 300, which would allow Meret to
terminate its registration with the Securities and Exchange
Commission and no longer be a public company, Meret said. For
the company, with annual revenue of slightly more than $10
million, the expense and management time required to meet SEC
regulations for public companies is disproportionate to
benefits obtained, Meret said.</p>
<p>Meret retained Harmon Group, a Columbus investment banking
firm, to give an opinion on the fairness of the plan.
Shareholders will be asked to approve the plan at a special
meeting later this summer, the company said.</p>
