	<p class="article-leader">Earth Technology Corp. said net income for the third
quarter ended May 25 was reduced about $100,000, or three
cents a share, because of non-operating items.
   The items include a percentage of a restated operating
loss at Waste Processor Industries Inc., in which Earth
Technology holds a 24% stake, and a valuation adjustment from
a deferred compensation arrangement in Earth Technology's
acquisition of Alternative Ways Inc.</p>

of $32,952, or one cent a share, on revenue of $6 million.
