	<p class="article-leader">Canada's constitutional fight will go right to the
deadline.
   Newfoundland Premier Clyde Wells said he will submit the
Meech Lake constitutional accord to a free vote in the
provincial legislature just before or on June 22, one day
before the legal deadline for ratifying the agreement.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The pact would give Quebec special status and end a
constitutional impasse that has revived talk of independence
in the French-speaking province.</p>
<p>Speaking in the Newfoundland House of Assembly, Mr. Wells
urged legislators to consult with their constituents before
the vote. In a free vote, legislators aren't bound by party
discipline. Mr. Wells's Liberal government holds 31 seats in
the House of Assembly. The Progressive Conservatives hold the
remaining 21 seats. Opposition Leader Tom Rideout said his
members will also be able to vote freely.</p>
<p>Saturday night, Canadian Prime Minister Brian Mulroney and
the 10 provincial premiers signed a tentative agreement that
attempts to deal with the concerns of three provinces that
had refused to ratify the Meech Lake accord as drafted.</p>
<p>But Mr. Wells opposed Saturday's agreement and said he
signed only so he could submit the Meech Lake accord and the
add-on agreement to his legislature for approval. The
premiers of the two other holdout provinces, New Brunswick
and Manitoba, agreed Saturday to pass the accord. But they
must still submit it to their legislatures for approval. The
accord could run into trouble in Manitoba, where Premier Gary
Filmon heads a minority government.</p>
