	<p class="article-leader">KELSO, Wash. -- Dan Norman believes in historical
accuracy.
   So he thinks a saloon girl, or variation thereof, should
grace one of several historical murals to be painted on
buildings in downtown Kelso, a city of 10,000 residents in
southwest Washington.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>His proposal to paint the town a tiny bit red, however,
has hit strong opposition.</p>
<p>Mr. Norman, chairman of a downtown-revitalization
committee, suggested at a recent meeting that a lady of the
evening be part of a police-scene mural. The murals are
supposed to depict aspects of Kelso's 100-year history.</p>
<p>Kelso acquired a racy reputation early this century, when
loggers from camps in surrounding river valleys came to Kelso
on weekends looking for a good time in its saloons and dance
halls.</p>
<p>"That's what was really going on down there," Mr. Norman
says. "To ignore it is a little hypocritical." But he adds
that he has in mind "just . . . something along the lines of
Miss Kitty in `Gunsmoke.'"</p>
<p>His proposal hasn't been put to a formal vote, but already
some committee members have responded with "a look like, `We
don't want to deal with it,'" he says.</p>
<p>Committee members who oppose the suggestion say they want
to use Kelso's turn-of-the-century ambiance to attract
tourists and shoppers.</p>
<p>"We do want to give the flavor of Kelso, but we don't
think {Mr. Norman's proposal} is the type of flavor we want
to promote," says committee member Lynn Woodard. Betty
Wilson, a former city councilwoman who attended the meeting,
says, "We've got a big future ahead of us, and I don't think
we need to put such insignificant, ordinary things up there."</p>
<p>Darrell Frost, a Kelso city councilman who acts as liaison
to the committee, says Mr. Norman's idea might be appropriate
if it's done tastefully. "I think there would have to be a
sketch or design of what the final product would be before we
could consider it," he said.</p>
<p>Committee member Vickie Jordan thinks the proposal is
amusing, but she has another concern -- one about the use of
federal grant money: "It's a cute thought, but I don't think
we want to go any further. This is taxpayers' money,
heavens]"</p>
<p>But Mr. Norman isn't giving up. He plans to make a formal
motion on his proposition at the committee's next meeting
tomorrow. "We're not Disneyland. This isn't Mayberry, and I
don't think we should paint Aunt Bee on the wall."</p>
