second-quarter earnings increase of 12 cents a share to its
parent, Danbury, Conn.-based Union Carbide Corp., from the
sale of its primary alcohol ethoxylates (PAE) business.
   The sale, to Hoechst Celanese Corp., was announced today,
although the price wasn't disclosed. Hoechst Celanese is a
unit of Hoechst AG, of West Germany.</p>

includes inventories and, under a licensing agreement,
associated business technologies. No plants, real property or
personnel are included in the deal, the company said. Union
Carbide Chemicals will continue to manufacture PAEs for
Hoechst Celanese under a multiyear agreement.</p>
