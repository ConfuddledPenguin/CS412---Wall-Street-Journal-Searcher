	<p class="article-leader">MADRID -- Spain's unemployment rate slipped to 15.5% in
May from 15.9% the previous month, the Spanish Labor Ministry
said.
   The number of jobless people fell to 2,340,000 in May from
2,380,000 in April, the Ministry said. The latest total was
down by nearly 300,000 from the year-earlier level.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Agriculture saw the biggest drop in unemployment, which
the ministry said was due to seasonal factors.</p>
<p>Analysts said that although May's figures were affected by
seasonal influences, they still indicated an underlying trend
toward a lower unemployment rate. In March, unemployment
stood at 16.1%.</p>
