	<p class="article-leader">BASEL, Switzerland -- European Community central bankers
took their first real steps toward creating a common central
bank, reorganizing the management and policy-making structure
of the EC's powerful central banking committee.
   But Bundesbank President Karl-Otto Poehl, who chairs the
EC bankers committee, suggested that some EC countries
shouldn't try to participate in the planned pan-European
central banking system until those countries' inflation rates
were both lower and more stable.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>In comments certain to further flame the controversy about
how quickly to create an EC central banking system and single
currency, he said a "hard core" of five or six countries
should create monetary union first, followed by the other
countries when their inflation rates are closer in line.</p>
<p>The decisions about the central banking committee's
management structure, as well as discussions about how to
proceed toward full economic and monetary union, took place
in Basel ahead of the annual meeting of the Bank for
International Settlements. Mr. Poehl then flew to Luxembourg
to meet with EC finance ministers and to give his views about
future monetary arrangements.</p>
<p>At their meeting, the central bankers adopted an expanded
organization to coordinate the monetary policies of the 12 EC
states. This move is part of the first phase of economic and
monetary union, which begins on July 1. The reorganization
expands the staff of the bankers committee, creating a new
analytical unit of five economists and a "committee of
alternates" to assist the central bank chiefs in preparing
for their monthly meetings in Basel. The bank chiefs also set
up three special subcommittees to coordinate policies on
foreign exchange, monetary matters and banking supervision.</p>
<p>Guenter Baer, a former economist with the World Bank in
Washington and a West German finance-ministry official, was
appointed as secretary general of the committee. This new
organization is seen as an embryo of a future central banking
authority, known as the "EuroFed," which would set monetary
policy for all members of the system and eventually manage a
single European currency.</p>
<p>Mr. Poehl also said that the central bank governors were
working on a "blueprint" that they hoped would form a
significant part of the treaty on economic and monetary
union. Talks on that treaty are scheduled to open in
December, and Mr. Poehl said he hoped that the central bank
governors' work would be incorporated directly into the text
of the treaty.</p>
<p>Mr. Poehl's comments advocating a "two-speed" approach to
economic and monetary union will undoubtedly be
controversial. Some countries are already suspicious that the
powerful Bundesbank president will use his key position to
further consolidate Germany's domination of the EC's monetary
arrangements.</p>
<p>While reflecting widely shared concerns among economists
about rushing too fast into a system of fixed exchange rates,
winning agreement for a two-speed system won't be easy. The
treaty for economic and monetary union will require unanimous
approval of all 12 EC states.</p>
<p>Even Britain, which has been reluctant to bring its
currency into European monetary arrangements, isn't keen on
creating yet another institution that would exclude them.
British Chancellor of the Exchequer John Major is delaying
British entry into the exchange-rate mechanism of the
European monetary system until U.K. inflation is closer in
line with that of the rest of the EC. But British officials
have said that they want the whole EC to move together toward
whatever system is created for economic and monetary union.</p>
<p>Mr. Poehl said it would be unwise to create a single
currency or a system of central banks if some members hadn't
learned to live with low inflation. France, Germany, the
three Benelux countries and perhaps Italy should move first
toward economic and monetary union, Mr. Poehl said, because
their economies and inflation rates had reached a high degree
of convergence. Other members should follow later.</p>
<p>"Some might start with the European central banking
system, and others who haven't reached the same level of
convergence would be invited to join later," he said. He
added, "We have to develop a system first. We have to achieve
a high degree of convergence -- demonstrating that the system
is stable for some time."</p>
<p>In its annual report, the Bank for International
Settlements took a similar view. "A policy aimed at
stabilizing nominal exchange rates in the face of significant
differences in national inflation rates will ultimately be
self-defeating," the bank said.</p>
