	<p class="article-leader">Pork belly prices closed up the daily permissible limit of
two cents a pound in response to estimates that more frozen
bellies were taken out of storage last week than had been
anticipated, analysts said.
   Live hog futures initially traded lower, but responded to
the rally in pork bellies to close higher for the day.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Pork belly futures for July delivery closed up two cents a
pound at 69.75 cents on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, and
July hogs closed up 0.77 cent a pound at 63.10 cents.</p>
<p>"We're within shooting distance of the contract high of
71.60" cents a pound for the July pork belly contract, said
Jerry Abbenhaus, a futures analyst with A.G. Edwards & Sons
in St. Louis.</p>
<p>Pork bellies shipped from warehouses outside of Chicago to
meatpacking plants totaled as much as three million pounds,
said Thomas Morgan, president of Sterling Research Corp.,
Arlington Heights, Ill. That's nearly three times the amount
that would normally be shipped in a week this time of year
from outside of Chicago warehouses as well as those in the
Chicago area, Mr. Morgan said.</p>
<p>Summertime demand accounted for a portion of the increase
in shipments, as did relatively light hog slaughters
recently, analysts said. Prices for fresh pork bellies
recently exceeded prices for frozen bellies, which also
fueled the belly futures price increase, analysts said.</p>
<p>In other commodity markets yesterday:</p>
<p>COCOA: Futures prices plunged again, accelerating the
decline that began in late May. The July contract dropped $54
a metric ton to $1,181, as speculators liquidated positions
taken in an effort to capitalize on the political upheavals
in the Ivory Coast, the world's largest cocoa producer.
Despite earlier concerns, the upheaval "didn't affect cocoa
or alter the overwhelming supply situation that had been such
a depressant on price previously," said William O'Neill of
Merrill Lynch Futures in New York. As this becomes clearer,
he said, prices are "simply reflecting the prevailing
conditions." Sandra Kaul, analyst for Shearson Lehman Hutton,
said there was little market support for cocoa prices
"because dealers had bought significant quantities of the
beans earlier when prices were lower, and they have little
incentive to buy at this time." At the same time, she said,
rain in West Africa has improved crop prospects there, and
the Brazil summer crop will soon be arriving on the market --
both factors that depress prices, she said. Ms. Kaul also
cited continuing concern that the Soviet Union, because of
credit problems, may have to forgo accepting delivery of
cocoa it has previously bought. If that happened, the cocoa
could end up being offered for sale on the world market, she
said.</p>
<p>ENERGY: U.S. crude prices for July closed slightly higher
after traders seemed to digest, but disregard, several
tidbits of news. A fire continued to burn aboard a Norwegian
tanker in the Gulf of Mexico, but the market apparently
accepted Coast Guard predictions that the tanker, which has
38.2 million gallons of light crude, wouldn't sink. Prices
were apparently hurt in the U.S. and in Asia by reports that
Japan, a large petroleum importer, is counting on significant
additional discounts from some members of the Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries. Meanwhile, Exxon Corp. said it
would reopen its Linden, N.J., refinery by mid-July; Norway's
oil workers threatened to strike July 1, and a major Alaskan
pipeline will be closed today so that corrosion can be
repaired. Traders took all the news in and the result was
that West Texas Intermediate -- like crudes for the July
contract closed on the New York Mercantile Exchange at $16.82
a barrel, up four cents a barrel. Products finished the
session lower.</p>
<p>COPPER: Futures prices declined in the wake of news that
the second of three major U.S. copper mining companies had
reached a new labor agreement. The July contract ended with a
loss of 2.10 cents a pound at $1.0965. A spokesman for Phelps
Dodge Corp., in Phoenix, Ariz., said the company had come to
a tentative agreement with the United Steelworkers union; the
rank and file will vote on the new contract today. Late last
month, Kennecott Corp., a Salt Lake City unit of RTZ of
Britain, reached an accord. This leaves Asarco Inc. of New
York as the last major U.S. mining company yet to reach a new
agreement. The U.S. labor pacts run out on June 30. The talks
between managements and the union have been progressing
harmoniously, according to analysts, but even so, the early
settlement by Phelps Dodge came as a surprise, they said. The
Phelps Dodge agreement diminishes the prospect of supply
disruptions because of labor problems and enhances the
possibility that a pact with Asarco will soon be reached,
analysts said. They estimated that the London Metal Exchange
today will announce an increase of 3,000 to 5,000 tons in
warehouse supplies of copper. More ample inventories of the
metal and a slowing U.S. economy, which could reduce demand,
remain price-depressing factors and contributed to a
narrowing of the premium of soonest-to-expire deliveries over
more deferred contracts both in New York and London, they
said.</p>
<p>GRAINS AND SOYBEANS: Analysts are divided over whether the
Agriculture Department will lower its one-month-old estimate
of the winter wheat harvest under way in the U.S. In May, the
department forecast the harvest at 2.09 billion bushels, up
44% from the drought-damaged 1989 harvest. Some analysts are
speculating that recent heavy rains damaged the soft red
variety grown in Illinois and Indiana. Others, however, are
projecting that the hard red variety grown in the Southern
Plains is in better condition than indicated in May. Based on
June 1 conditions, Richard Feltes, director of research at
Refco Inc., Chicago, said he expects a winter wheat harvest
of 2.14 billion bushels. Susan Leighty, a grain analyst at
Prudential-Bache Securities Inc., New York, is predicting a
harvest of 2.12 billion bushels. The Agriculture Department
is also slated to update its supply and demand estimates for
corn and soybeans. Among other things, analysts expect the
government to begin trimming its rough estimate that the
recently planted corn crop could total 8.1 billion bushels at
harvest this fall. An unusually wet spring prevented many
farmers from planting as many acres as the government had
expected. Some crop analysts, however, are projecting a corn
harvest of 7.4 billion to 7.7 billion bushels.</p>
