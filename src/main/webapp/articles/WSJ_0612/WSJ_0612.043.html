	<p class="article-leader">Washington, D.C. -- The emergence of the Soviet Union from
nearly three-quarters of a century of historical amnesia will
probably produce cultural changes on a scale comparable with
the economic ones that are under way. In the visual arts, for
example, a vigorous avant-garde recently surfaced with active
official sanction.
   Actually, this avant-garde is resurfacing, since it had
already ventured into the light once before, briefly, in the
early '60s, taking courage and inspiration from the 1959
exhibition of advanced American painting and sculpture
organized in Moscow by the Archives of American Art. But
Nikita Khrushchev soon froze this thaw when he visited the
1962 dissident exhibition "Thirty Years of Moscow Art."</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"Jackasses," he shouted at the new artists, in a display
of righteous indignation worthy of Jesse Helms, "we are
declaring war on you]"</p>
<p>In subsequent years, the Soviet government's struggle
against dissident art sometimes did look like a war. At the
"First Open Air Exhibition" in Moscow in 1974, the
authorities sent in bulldozers and water trucks to break
things up. A lot of art was damaged, but so was the
government's credibility as an arbiter of culture. To save
face, the authorities sanctioned "official unofficial"
exhibitions in a number of cities and, at the same time,
foreign influence continued to make itself felt.</p>
<p>The American influence on current Soviet art is still very
strong, as can be seen in the exhibition "10+10: Contemporary
Soviet and American Painters," on view at the Corcoran
Gallery of Art here until June 24. This exhibition, which was
organized by the Modern Art Museum of Fort Worth, Texas, is
one of a growing list of joint ventures by American arts
institutions and the Soviet authorities. Art, the Soviets
have discovered, is a kind of cultural hard currency, and
they are learning to spend this unexpected nest egg to buy
approval and as seed money for earning real hard currency in
the free world's art market.</p>
<p>For this exhibition, a bilateral panel headed by Fort
Worth curator Marla Price has selected 10 artists from each
country, all under 40 years of age. (Only nine of the
Americans are being shown in Washington; Annette Lemieux has
withdrawn her works here, in protest against the Corcoran's
cancellation of the Robert Mapplethorpe show last year.)
Although the merits of any such selection can be argued at
length, this one seems quite reasonable. The American artists
represent a broad spectrum of styles, ranging from the moody
landscapes of April Gornik to the bright, brash geometrical
abstractions of Peter Halley. Also included are David Bates,
Ross Bleckner, Christopher Brown, Rebecca Purdum, David
Salley, Donald Sultan and Mark Tansey.</p>
<p>Tansey's "Triumph of the New York School," a painting that
looks like a giant sepia photograph, adds an especially wry
note to the exhibition. This parody of a military scene in a
devastated no-man's land, features portraits of the abstract
expressionist painters Jackson Pollock and Robert Motherwell
costumed as casually dressed American soldiers accepting the
surrender of Henri Matisse and Pablo Picasso, who wear French
uniforms. Is Tansey sending the Soviets a sly political
lesson along with the artistic one?</p>
<p>The Soviet artists chosen for this show seem symmetrical
to their American counterparts in several ways. The styles in
which they work frequently resemble those of the better known
Americans, and the installation of their paintings sometimes
underlines these connections. Andrei Roiter and Vadim
Zakharov, both of whom mix boldly simplified figurative and
abstract imagery, are shown alongside American artist Donald
Sultan, who works in a comparable mode and mood. Sergei
Shutov shares a room with David Salle, whose work his
resembles so much that you might say he has "appropriated"
the master of "appropriation."</p>
<p>Yurii Albert confronts the issue of influence in an even
more blatant way. One of his paintings, which consists of
richly brushed letters, in the manner of Jasper Johns, is
titled "I'm Not Jasper Johns." Another, a cartoon-like
rendering of an artist with brushes and palette is turned
upside down in imitation of the German artist Georg Baselitz.
Albert calls it "I'm Not Baselitz]" Judging, moreover, from
his personal statement in the catalog, Albert also has
learned to do a perfect and unabashed imitation of the
portentous newspeak so inexplicably popular among Western
artists called upon to explain themselves in words.</p>
<p>In terms of overall quality, this exhibition evokes mixed
feelings. The Soviet paintings are impressively international
and up-to-the-minute in style. There is a refreshing absence
of socialist realism, and it is apparent that even before
Mikhail Gorbachev gave them the nod, Soviet artists were
looking carefully at Western art and working in a boldly
internationalist manner.</p>
<p>Yet at the same time, there is something amateurish about
many of the Soviet paintings, especially when they are seen
in close proximity to their American counterparts. Despite
their awareness of international modernist (and
postmodernist) pictorial vocabularies, most of the Soviet
pictures look oddly provincial. Not stylistically provincial,
but provincial in their derivativeness and in their general
failure to generate a strong sense of artistic authenticity.
They are like the paintings produced for the better sort of
M.F.A. thesis shows in the U.S. The vision behind the Soviet
paintings is an educated vision. Their technical skill is
real. But they lack the professional seasoning that marks the
best contemporary art.</p>
<p>In his catalog statement, Vladimir Mironenko exemplifies
both the optimism and the problems of Soviet artists today.
"I would like to know," he writes, "how our enormous country,
existing, as it were, in a different dimension, fits in with
what is happening in the rest of the world." Soviet art, he
asserts, bears only a superficial resemblance to Western art,
because "its content is by now completely different." But at
the same time, as he points out, "it is not easy to find the
essential meaning, as the image is based on an altered
language, a distorted history, and a falling out of time."</p>
<p>When the Soviet experience is set forth convincingly in a
fresh way, it will be easier to speak of Soviet art's having
finally come of age. But if contemporary Soviet painting is
still not quite mature, on the evidence of this show it seems
nonetheless to be experiencing an adventurous and promising
youth.</p>
<p>After Washington, the exhibition will travel to Moscow,
Tbilisi and Leningrad.</p>
