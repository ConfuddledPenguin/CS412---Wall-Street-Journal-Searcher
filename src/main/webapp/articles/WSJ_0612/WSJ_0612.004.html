	<p class="article-leader">BOSTON -- John Hancock Financial Services said it acquired
Cost Care Inc., a closely held Huntington Beach, Calif.,
concern. Terms weren't disclosed.
   Cost Care, which had revenue of about $23 million last
year, provides health cost and treatment monitoring services
for corporations. Hancock, a financial services unit of John
Hancock Mutual Life Insurance Co., said Cost Care will be
combined with its own cost-containment operations in a group
that it said will have $40 million in combined revenue this
year.</p>
