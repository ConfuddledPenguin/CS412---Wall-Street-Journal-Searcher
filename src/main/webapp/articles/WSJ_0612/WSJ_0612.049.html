	<p class="article-leader">The Securities and Exchange Commission is close to taking
yet another step to make it easier for foreign companies to
sell securities in the U.S.
   The SEC's willingness to relax strict U.S. registration
guidelines for foreign issuers was signaled in an
announcement Friday by Attwoods PLC. The British
waste-management company said that it planned an #82 million
($138 million) rights offering that will be registered with
the SEC. The offering gives shareholders the right to
purchase one new share at 390 pence for each four ordinary
shares they hold.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>S.G. Warburg & Co., the lead underwriter, says it believes
this will be the first underwritten rights issue for a
British company to be registered with the SEC.</p>
<p>In the past, foreign companies often steered clear of
registering securities offerings in the U.S., either because
they had too few U.S. shareholders to make the expense
worthwhile or because the detailed filings were considered a
hassle. The result was that U.S. investors were forced to
sell their unexercised rights and denied the opportunity to
participate fully in the transaction.</p>
<p>But because the SEC is likely to bend U.S. rules,
Attwoods' U.S. shareholders are expected to be able to take
full advantage of the company's rights offering.</p>
<p>The SEC hasn't formally approved the Attwoods application,
but is expected to shortly.</p>
<p>The expected Attwoods offering would be the latest in a
string of measures taken recently by the SEC to accommodate
foreign corporations that wish to raise money in the U.S.
stock and bond markets.</p>
<p>Part of the impetus behind the SEC's new stance is the
planned 1992 abolition of trade and investment barriers in
the 12 countries that comprise the European Community,
something that will enhance Europe's position as a financial
power.</p>
<p>The SEC, led by Chairman Richard Breeden, is acutely aware
that international capital markets have grown far more
interdependent in the past decade. To keep the U.S. as the
world's premier capital market, the agency feels it must
adjust to investor and issuer needs.</p>
<p>The SEC's most wide-reaching step came earlier this
spring, when it created an easy way for foreign companies to
sell debt and stock to large U.S. institutions like pension
funds and insurance companies. That provision, called Rule
144a, is designed to help encourage European and Asian
companies to raise funds in the U.S. private placement
market. At the same time, it allows large U.S. investors
expanded investment opportunities.</p>
<p>"If there are good opportunities for American investors
abroad, Americans should be allowed to take advantage of
those," said Marianne Smythe, executive assistant to the SEC
chairman. At the same time, "For American businesses to raise
capital, it is useful for them to have access to investors
other than those in the U.S. That reduces the cost of
capital."</p>
<p>With about 20% of its stock outstanding held in the U.S.
and roughly 70% of its business there, "Attwoods was eager to
insure that its U.S. shareholders were able to participate in
the issue on the same terms as their non-U.S. shareholders,"
says Lucas J. Wilson, a vice president at Warburg's U.S. unit
in New York.</p>
<p>Specifically, the SEC has signaled that it is willing to
speed up Attwoods's registration to save the company from
what can be higher costs, says Warburg. The agency is also
expected to exempt partially the securities firm from Rule
10b6, which effectively bans an underwriter from making a
market in an issue during the offering period. (A
market-maker commits to buy and sell shares and smooth market
imbalances.) To comply, Warburg would have to cease making a
market for Attwoods shares in London.</p>
<p>Instead, the British brokerage house says that the SEC
will allow the firm to actively trade Attwoods stock in
Britain until five days before the offer's termination date,
July 24. The SEC will also mandate that if the share price is
trading at less than 110% of the rights exercise price, or
390 pence, Warburg can only make a market on a passive basis,
in which it can't actively solicit business. The firm won't
be allowed to make a market in the U.S. during the offering
period.</p>
<p>The SEC said it had only received the Attwoods filing last
Friday and was still reviewing it.</p>
<p>Making a market in London is important to both Attwoods
and Warburg. The broker claims it is the largest of the three
or four major firms that make a market in Attwoods shares,
and that to exclude it from Attwoods transactions could
hinder trading in Attwoods shares and the success of the
rights issue. In addition, the International Stock Exchange
in London could penalize the firm for failing to back its
commitment to maintain a market in the stock.</p>
<p>"The message from the SEC is that it's easier than it was
before for foreign companies to operate in the U.S. capital
markets," says Warburg's Mr. Wilson. "The SEC's attitude here
is that it isn't that complicated, it can be done, and that
if Attwoods can do it, so can other companies.</p>
<p>Linda Quinn, the SEC's director of corporation finance,
said the agency is acutely concerned that the SEC's timing
schedule not deter foreign companies from making rights
offerings available to U.S. investors. "We've tried to
accommodate timing practices by putting in a lot of extra
effort," she said. "If we have to review documents around the
clock, that's what we'll do."</p>
<p>The Attwoods offering price represents an 18% discount to
what Attwoods stock was selling for at the time. Yesterday,
Attwoods closed unchanged at 476 pence. The company's
American depositary receipts, each of which represents five
Attwoods shares, rose 37.5 cents to close at $41.125.</p>
<p>Still, the agency remains concerned about moving too
quickly and pulling back on some of the customer protections
that have been the cornerstone of SEC policy since the 1930s.
"We're doing what's appropriate to assist in the process of
furthering international flows of capital," the SEC's Ms.
Smythe said. But, "none of us want that to be done at the
expense of regulations necessary to assure reasonable
safety."</p>
