	<p class="article-leader">SYDNEY -- The Australian government again threw cold water
on Robert Maxwell's hopes of gaining a foothold in the
country's newspaper business.
   Treasurer Paul Keating, who has the last word on foreign
investment bids, said Canberra will block the British media
magnate's proposal to take a 49% stake in the daily West
Australian in Perth and other newspaper interests now
controlled by Alan Bond's Bell Group Ltd.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Speaking at a news conference in London, Mr. Keating said,
"We always have a restrictive view of newspaper ownership,
particularly capital-city newspapers. A 49% interest from a
shareholder that strong is a controlling interest, and we
would not agree to it."</p>
<p>Mr. Keating defined a controlling interest as anything
above 25%, but he wouldn't say how much of a holding by Mr.
Maxwell would be tolerated. Australia now limits total
foreign ownership in television and radio stations to 20%,
though it has no firm guidelines for newspapers.</p>
<p>The treasurer added that the needs of the debt-burdened
Mr. Bond, who is jettisoning assets in an effort to rescue
his Australian-based empire from collapse, are "a side issue"
to the country's larger interests.</p>
<p>In London, Mr. Maxwell said it was "injudicious" of Mr.
Keating to comment before receiving an official application.</p>
<p>Mr. Maxwell's Mirror Group PLC and Bell Group announced
that the British publisher had agreed to buy 49% of Bell
Group's publishing interests for 175 million Australian
dollars (US$135.1 million) in cash and assumption of A$75
million of debt.</p>
<p>The price Mirror Group agreed to pay for just less than
half of the publishing interests effectively values the total
assets at about A$500 million -- much more than some analysts
think they're worth. "It seems to be a very high price," said
Robin Forbes, of Perth stock-brokerage firm Hartley Poynton
Ltd. Mr. Aspinall, however, called the price "very fair."</p>
<p>Mirror Group's move follows Mr. Maxwell's purchase in
April, on his own behalf, of 14.9% of Bell Group. Australian
regulators have petitioned the courts to unwind that
transaction. The seller of the shares, David Aspinall, Bell
Group's managing director, has been accused of violating
corporate-takeover rules in the deal.</p>
<p>As part of yesterday's offer, Mr. Maxwell agreed to help
fund a proposed buy-back -- most likely at a deep discount to
face value -- of some A$550 million of bonds convertible into
shares of Bell Group that are issued in Europe.</p>
<p>Bell Group also owes bank lenders about A$260 million, Mr.
Aspinall said. If the proposed sale were completed, some of
the proceeds would likely be used to reduce Bell Group's bank
debt.</p>
