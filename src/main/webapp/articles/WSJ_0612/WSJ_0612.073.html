	<p class="article-leader">Nissan Motor Co. named Thomas D. Mignanelli president and
chief executive officer of its U.S. sales and marketing arm,
making him the first American to hold such a title at any
major Japanese auto company.
   Mr. Mignanelli succeeds Kazutoshi Hagiwara effective July
1. Mr. Hagiwara is returning to Tokyo to assume new
responsibilities at the parent firm.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Mr. Mignanelli, 45 years old and currently Nissan's
executive vice president of U.S. operations, said his
promotion "raises visibility of Americans being accountable
for the American market."</p>
<p>Mr. Mignanelli said he will have considerable autonomy.
"We price our own products and we have a good deal . . . of
the input on product-cycle plans," he said.</p>
<p>Nissan's move comes as Japanese auto makers are under fire
from some U.S. executives who say they feel relegated to
subordinate positions and isolated from key deliberations
with executives of the parent companies in Japan.</p>
<p>"Japanese firms have been fairly slow to shift control of
top management positions to Americans," said Robert Cole, a
business professor at the University of Michigan. Nissan,
however, has been "somewhat of a leader" in furthering that
process, particularly at its Smyrna, Tenn., manufacturing
facility, where there are "relatively few Japanese," he said.</p>
<p>Mr. Mignanelli will report directly to Yoshikazu Hanawa,
president of Nissan North America Inc., the umbrella
organization for Nissan's North American operations. Mr.
Hanawa divides his time between Japan and the U.S. In
contrast, the top U.S. sales executives at the U.S. sales arm
of Honda Motor Co. and Toyota Motor Corp. have the title of
executive vice president and report to Japanese executives in
the U.S., who hold the title of president.</p>
<p>Mr. Hanawa said, "Mr. Mignanelli's appointment is in
keeping with our strategy to become a fully localized,
customer-oriented company in America. As we move toward
realizing this goal, we will continue to localize management
function of overseas subsidiaries and promote local
decision-making on important issues."</p>
<p>Still, even with Mr. Mignanelli's high-profile promotion,
Nissan has a long way to meet its goal. Americans now head
just two of Nissan's 10 U.S. operating divisions. Besides Mr.
Mignanelli, the other senior U.S. executive is Jerry
Benefield, president and chief executive of Nissan
Manufacturing Corp. in Smyrna, Tenn. Mr. Benefield also
reports to Mr. Hanawa.</p>
<p>Moreover, Mr. Mignanelli has Japanese executives in his
operation who not only report to him but have direct access
to his superiors in Tokyo. These Japanese executives also
have "career paths leading back to Japan," and, potentially,
to bigger jobs with the parent company, a company spokesman
said.</p>
<p>Mr. Mignanelli came to Nissan in 1987 after 18 years with
Ford Motor Co., where he rose to national sales manager of
the Lincoln-Mercury division. Mr. Mignanelli joined Nissan's
U.S. sales arm as vice president of marketing, and was
promoted to executive vice president of operations in 1988.</p>
