	<p class="article-leader">Communications Transmission Inc., an Austin, Texas-based
provider of digital communications transmissions and network
services, said it significantly restructured its debt.
   Prudential Insurance Co. of America, CTI's subordinated
lender, was issued warrants to purchase convertible preferred
stock that could increase its common equity to 68% from 23%,
a CTI spokesman said. The preferred stock can be converted to
about 15.8 million shares of common, in addition to the 11
million shares that had been outstanding.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The debt restructuring, the spokesman said, cured CTI's
defaults in interest payments on subordinated debentures as
well as similar defaults by its majority-owned subsidiary,
ALC Communications Corp. The spokesman said CTI will be
required to make "substantial" payments after 12 and 18
months but declined to specify the amount.</p>
<p>The restructuring also gives CTI, in exchange for certain
contract concessions and bridge note modifications, preferred
stock in ALC which, if converted, would increase CTI's
ownership of ALC from about 55% to 64%.</p>
