	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- Southwestern states are expected to lead the
nation in economic growth through the end of the century,
continuing the shift in economic activity to the Sun Belt,
the Commerce Department projects.
   Nevada and Arizona will show the fastest growth rates in
personal income, jobs and population between 1988 and 2000,
the department predicts in a new report. One of every six
jobs created during that period will be in California, the
report says. And Florida, Utah and Hawaii also are expected
to grow rapidly.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The report points to continued softness in northeastern
states. While total personal income is expected to grow 46.2%
after inflation in Nevada and 40.6% in Arizona, it is
expected to expand only 21.6% in New England. Nationally, the
department expects personal income to grow 26.2% by 2000.</p>
<p>New England surged ahead of most of the country in
economic growth through much of the 1980s. But in 1988, its
fortunes began to turn. Also during the past decade,
increasing numbers of people and companies began to move to
the Sun Belt, which stretches from the Southeast to the
Southwest.</p>
<p>Kenneth Johnson, a Commerce Department analyst, said
Arizona and Nevada "have exhibited strength already over the
last few years. They have shown a competitive {growth}
advantage over the other states and we expect that to
continue into the year 2000."</p>
<p>In particular, growth in the transportation equipment and
service industries will drive economic gains in the two
states, said another department economist, Hugh Knox.</p>
<p>According to the report, four states -- California, New
York, Texas and Florida -- will account for one-third of the
nation's projected $4.1 trillion total personal income by
2000.</p>
<p>While California will continue to have the highest total
personal income in the country, Connecticut will continue to
have the highest per capita income, rising a projected 10.8%
by the end of the century to $20,503 after adjusting for
inflation.</p>
<p>That would be 34% above the national average of $15,345.
New Jersey, Massachusetts, and the District of Columbia also
are projected to have per capita incomes 20% above the
national average.</p>
<p>Of the 18.9 million new jobs expected to be created in the
U.S. by the end of the century, 3.4 million will be in
California. Florida and Texas are projected to add more than
a million new jobs each.</p>
<p>The projections suggest that Texas will continue to
recover from the downturn caused by a plunge in oil prices in
the 1980s. Its per capita income is expected to increase
18.2% between 1988 and 2000, compared with a meager 3.7% rise
between 1979 and 1988.</p>
<p>Nevada is projected to experience the fastest population
growth -- 29.8% -- followed by Arizona's 21.4% growth and
Florida's 18.2%. In Wyoming, West Virginia, and Louisiana,
population is predicted to fall slightly.</p>
