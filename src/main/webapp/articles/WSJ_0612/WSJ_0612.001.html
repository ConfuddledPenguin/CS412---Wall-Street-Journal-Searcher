	<p class="article-leader">New York -- Ludmila Skripkina and Oleg Petrenko, a.k.a.
the Peppers, sat smoking and sipping tea in their borrowed
artist's studio in Lower Manhattan. Reaching toward the small
television set, Mr. Petrenko switched channels from "The
People's Court" to "Bonanza," and considered the couple's
first visit to the Big Apple.
   "Each day, we usually work, go out and walk around," he
said haltingly. "We live here like we do in Soviet Union."</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Although they are still in their 20s, the Peppers have
joined an elite group of Soviet artists who make their art on
the go, globe-trotting from London to Berlin to Manhattan.</p>
<p>"Most of the really good artists travel constantly," said
Margarita Tupitsyn, a Soviet art historian. "They're invited
by some European gallery, or a gallery here, or a museum
show. It's almost impossible to find anyone in Moscow among
people who have a choice."</p>
<p>In the bad old days when getting a bad review meant having
your work mowed down by a state-run bulldozer, these once
"unofficial" artists worked in obscurity, supporting
themselves as book illustrators and factory workers. They
have perestroika to thank for their new mobility, but their
plane tickets are being paid by European and American art
dealers eager to market their once-forbidden art.</p>
<p>Although the jury is still out on the commercial fate of
current Soviet art, the market may have hit high tide in
1988, when Sotheby's netted $3.6 million at a Moscow auction
of paintings, many by artists then unknown abroad. But last
month, when the house of Hapsburg, Feldman tried to make the
Soviet goose lay more golden eggs at a New York sale, the
nest was half empty. Only 65 of the 121 works -- including
many by the same artists who were bought up at the Sotheby's
sale -- sold, most at prices well below the estimates.</p>
<p>This dismal showing has not yet deterred a handful of
committed New York dealers from sponsoring lengthy working
visits here for promising Soviet artists. The Peppers owe
their six weeks in New York (wedged between stays in Italy
and Amsterdam) to Ronald Feldman Fine Arts Inc., which
arranged their visas, bought their plane tickets, paid for
their studio and living space and their daily expenses. In
return, the gallery will show and sell the four works the
Peppers produced here, pocketing 50% of the profits after
their expenses in an arrangement similar to those it holds
with American artists.</p>
<p>For dealers such as Mr. Feldman, who is now scouring
Eastern Europe for still-fresher talent, inviting Soviet
artists to work in New York is more a matter of financial
horse sense than a goodwill gesture. By setting the artists
up so they can work outside the U.S.S.R., dealers circumvent
costly and Byzantine regulations that the Soviets place on
art exports. If dealers want to market Soviet art that is
still in the U.S.S.R., they must buy it on consignment from
the Soviet government at high sums further inflated by the
official rate of exchange. Furthermore, dealers tell horror
stories of shelling out big rubles for one painting in
Moscow, then receiving another in the mail. Artists fare even
worse, sometimes not even receiving the small percentage of
profits they'd been promised by the authorities who insist on
acting as their agents to the West.</p>
<p>"Paintings were bought officially through proper
government agencies in the U.S.S.R., and to this day the
artists whose work was purchased that way were not paid by
the government," said Mr. Feldman, recalling shows of Soviet
art that he held during the 1980s.</p>
<p>Igor and Svetlana Kopystiansky, who are here at the
invitation of the Phyllis Kind Gallery, say the Soviet
government promised them 60% of the profits from the
Sotheby's sale, but came through with only 15% -- which then
was promptly taxed. But some artists say they fared no better
at the hands of Western collectors who began touring their
Moscow studios in recent years. Promising gallery and museum
exhibitions of their work, collectors such as Frenchman Jose
Alvarez, whose purchases made up the bulk of works auctioned
at Hapsburg, Feldman, paid only a couple of hundred dollars
for paintings that they promptly resold for thousands.</p>
<p>Now, most Soviet artists of note tend to work and sell
almost exclusively outside the Soviet Union. But while
artists stand to gain financially from this new setup, they
may not be able to take their newly earned dollars back home
with them. By cutting out the Soviet middleman, artists have
put themselves outside the system for dealing with foreign
profits, and many doubt if they will be able to deposit the
money in Soviet foreign-currency banks. Faced with the
prospect of converting their dollars into rubles on the black
market, some artists prefer to blow their earnings here.</p>
<p>"They don't really need dollars in the Soviet Union, so
they're going to spend all of it here," said a friend,
translating for the Peppers. "Dollars have very strong legs
-- they run quickly."</p>
<p>Of course, there's more to these working visits than
shopping for video cameras and CD players. For artists such
as the Peppers, who learned about modern art through the
pages of "a big book with pictures, but also captions --
`this is conceptual, this is very bad art, this is
imperialist art'" -- these stays can serve as a crash course
in art history. For Simon Faibisovich, now on his second
visit to New York, encountering Western art firsthand was
alarming.</p>
<p>"When I came here, it became clear I didn't have any idea
about the . . . art situation as a whole. I was in shock,"
said Mr. Faibisovich in his airy studio, where large canvases
of people queuing in front of a state vodka shop leaned
against the walls. "I think art here is pretty different than
in Russia. In Russia . . . artist's life is more or less
responding to real everyday life . . . But here . . . art and
artists' life is independent."</p>
<p>Apart from the odd foray to a SoHo gallery and the nearby
Museum of Holography, the Peppers had limited their
encounters with Western art in New York to the stack of art
magazines they found in the borrowed apartment.</p>
<p>"The real thing? No," said Mr. Petrenko. "We are afraid to
go in museums. Many, many art in one place is difficult for
head. Maybe next week."</p>
<p>But if some artists are hesitant to immerse themselves in
Western art, they are not shy when it comes to using American
art supplies. In a switch from their days in the Soviet
Union, where only a limited variety of paints and supplies is
available, these artists are creating new work from a wealth
of materials. For example, small plastic fruits have been
added to one of the Peppers' recent canvases, adding a
humorous fillip to an austere chart copied from a Soviet
gynecological textbook.</p>
<p>And while paintings bristling with hammers, sickles and
other post-Stalinist kitsch still abound, some artists have
begun to make New York the subject of their new work: For his
next series of paintings, Mr. Faibisovich is tackling the
subway.</p>
<p>But will New York collectors buy up Soviet art when it no
longer bears the seal "Made in the U.S.S.R."? Although
dealers tend to be cagey on the subject of sales, most say
that the sponsored work-visits have paid off.</p>
<p>"Of course, I could lose my shirt," said Phyllis Kind. "It
worked out well with some artists, with others it didn't work
out so well. I'm confident I'll sell the works later and make
up my costs."</p>
<p>Unfortunately, as some Soviet artists are now discovering,
the New York art world is not always a friendly place,
especially when the dream of celebrity and fortune goes bust.</p>
<p>"America is like one great machine who eats and -- ,"
Vladimir Yankilevsky spat contemptuously. As the artist spoke
in his loft, workmen carried in large plaster figures encased
in wooden boxes, two works which failed to sell at the
Hapsburg, Feldman auction. Mr. Yankilevsky says he is now
considering cancelling an exhibition scheduled for Edouard
Nakhamkin Fine Art, rather than create the commercial work he
feels the gallery expects.</p>
<p>"It's terrible, the most cynical market in the world," Mr.
Yankilevsky said.</p>
<p>Caught between Soviet politics and the Western market, he
may not have too many alternatives.</p>
<p>"The struggle for power in the Soviet Union is creating a
lot of pressure. There, struggle for power. Here, struggle
for market," Mr. Yankilevsky sighed. "The best place to work
{is} in sky -- in plane."</p>
