	<p class="article-leader">STAMFORD, Conn. -- Ishier Jacobson said he will retire as
president, chief executive officer and a director of Citizens
Utilities Co., effective June 30.
   Mr. Jacobson, who will be 68 years old this month, will
continue to work closely with the company as a consultant to
the board.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Daryl A. Ferguson, 51, will become president and chief
operating officer July 1. Mr. Ferguson currently is senior
vice president, operations and engineering.</p>
<p>A successor to Mr. Jacobson as chief executive hasn't been
named, nor has one been named to Mr. Ferguson's post. The
chairmanship has been vacant since last year, and it isn't
clear whether or when the chairmanship and post of chief
executive will be filled. As of July 1, Mr. Ferguson would
hold the highest positions in the company, a spokeswoman
said.</p>
<p>Citizens is a public utility that provides
telecommunications services and electric, water and gas
services in 12 states. Citizens earned $88 million, or $2.01
a share, in 1989, on operating revenue of $339 million, the
spokeswoman said.</p>
<p>Mr. Ferguson has broad telecommunications experience in
both regulated and nonregulated businesses. Before joining
Citizens last year, he was a senior operations executive with
Centel Corp.</p>
<p>Mr. Jacobson, who has been a director since 1968 and
president since 1970, led the expansion of Citizens' utility
operations into Pennsylvania, Ohio, Indiana, Illinois and
Hawaii, among other places. He was instrumental in the
company's recent agreement to acquire Louisiana General
Services Inc., a Harvey, La., natural-gas utility, which
would position the company in the Middle South for the first
time.</p>
