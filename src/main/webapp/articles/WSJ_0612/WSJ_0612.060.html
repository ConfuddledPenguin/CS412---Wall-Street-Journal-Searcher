	<p class="article-leader">A man visits his doctor and the doctor says, "Well, I'm
sorry to say you've got six weeks to live."
   "I want a second opinion," says the patient.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"You want a second opinion? OK," says the doctor. "You're
ugly, too."</p>
<p>If you grin at that old joke, you'll like Lorrie Moore.
It's a favorite of one of her heroines. And women who enjoy
jokes that require a grimace as well as a smile are a
hallmark of her fiction.</p>
<p>Ms. Moore's women have the gift of wit. It makes them
brave in the face of bad luck and shields them against life's
afflictions. But it's part of their problem, too. The jokes
are an involuntary reflex, an easier response than emotional
commitment.</p>
<p>"Everything's a joke with you," a man tells his lover in
Ms. Moore's beautiful story, "The Jewish Hunter."</p>
<p>"Nothing's a joke with me. It just all comes out like
one," she replies.</p>
<p>Many of the stories in "Like Life" (Knopf, 178 pages,
$18.95) balance brilliantly between laughter and sadness.
"The Jewish Hunter," "You're Ugly, Too," "Joy" and "Like
Life" have the power to wrench the heart, not because things
end, but because they go on -- because people find the
courage to keep looking for love, for friendship, for small
joys.</p>
<p>That balance and power are greater here than in Ms.
Moore's earlier work (the novel "Anagrams" and the story
collection "Self-Help.") There, the jokes came so fast and
furiously they stunted the stories' emotional impact. "Like
Life," on the other hand, is full of stories that reward
second and third readings.</p>
<p>Ms. Moore's admirable, witty women enjoy singing, tend to
drink a bit too much and live in a world of less-smart men.
Their neuroses make them suspicious as well as funny. They
not only look gift horses in the mouths, they probe their
teeth. Most are unmarried and no longer young. One day, they
tell themselves, they should give up looking for love because
in dating they only find new material for wry wit.</p>
<p>One has a German boyfriend who speaks an English full of
misheard slang. He says "to each a zone" and tells her she
looks "hunky-dorky."</p>
<p>Another thinks for a moment she has met a man who doesn't
want Heidi -- the stereotypical docile, unthreatening female.
"But soon she came to realize that all men, deep down, wanted
Heidi. Heidi with cleavage. Heidi with outfits."</p>
<p>Unless, of course, those men are from Richard Ford's
Montana, in which case they want Mom, or no one at all.</p>
<p>In several stories of Mr. Ford's earlier collection, "Rock
Springs," and now in his novel, "Wildlife" (Atlantic Monthly
Press, 177 pages, $18.95), young boys are helpless witnesses
as their parents' marriage falls apart. Always, Mom takes a
lover while Dad and son suffer. Husbands in Great Falls,
Mont., are inarticulate and passive. Their wives are
compelled toward sexual adventure that divides them from
their sons, leaving the boys to puzzle over things years
later.</p>
<p>It's a small, fearful world for males. The husbands and
sons hold their emotions in a fetal crouch. Meanwhile, the
women inflict on everyone the cost of their sexual passions.</p>
<p>Mr. Ford's "Rock Springs" stories make effective use of
this material, but "Wildlife" struggles unsuccessfully
against the handicap of its immature and passive narrator's
voice.</p>
<p>Although years have passed since Joe Brinson was 16 and
watched his mother have an affair that broke up her marriage
to his father, his view of the events remains childish and,
at points, unbelievably obtuse. Joe ends his story telling us
that he didn't understand a lot of what went on and we can
only nod in agreement.</p>
<p>Mr. Ford attempts to add resonance to his story by telling
it through the eyes of a participant who was emotionally
stunted by the events. But whereas obtuse narrators have
added depth to some novels, Joe just stretches credulity.</p>
<p>He watches Mom in her lover's arms:</p>
<p>"Maybe, I thought, he was not to blame for kissing my
mother and holding her dress up over her hips. Maybe that's
all he could do. Maybe no one was to blame for that, or for
much of what happened to anyone."</p>
<p>He doesn't blame his mother either. He is eager to
withhold disapproval (even years later) despite great
provocation. Joe lacks a moral universe and his blandness
renders his story tedious.</p>
<p>Mr. Ford leaves it to the glib lecher who seduces Mom to
provide the novel's attempts at insight into her behavior.
"Sometimes you have to do the wrong thing just to know you're
alive," he says.</p>
<p>At another point, he says of Joe's mother: "She was
throwing things up to see where they'd land."</p>
<p>Each parent leads Joe into deeply humiliating situations.
Years have passed, but time has provided Joe with little
perspective on all this. When he sums up, he can be pretty
unsurprising:</p>
<p>"And what there is to learn from almost any human
experience is that your own interests usually do not come
first where other people are concerned -- even people who
love you -- and that is all right. It can be lived with."</p>
<p>It's enough to make you ask for a second opinion.</p>
