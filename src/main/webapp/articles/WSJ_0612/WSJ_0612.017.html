	<p class="article-leader">EDEN PRAIRIE, Minn. -- CPT Corp. said it reached
settlements of two lawsuits pending against the company in
federal court. The office-automation-equipment concern had
been sued by participants in its employee stock ownership
plan seeking to diversify their stock portfolio. CPT also
faced a contract claim from the Justice Department.
   The combined settlements are within CPT's reserves
established in prior quarters, the company said. The ESOP
settlement of $2 million, which awaits court approval, will
be paid from insurance proceeds. In the contract case,
insurance will cover $200,000, and CPT itself will pay
$200,000 in annual installments of $50,000 each.</p>
