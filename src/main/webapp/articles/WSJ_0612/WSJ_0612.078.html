	<p class="article-leader">All of a sudden leaking to the press in Washington can be
bad for your career. The chairman of the National Endowment
for the Arts has dismissed his deputy for talking on the
phone with columnists Evans and Novak. Earlier two Justice
Department officals were transferred for not lying to a
reporter about an investigation involving a Congressman.
   If this keeps up, who knows who could lose their jobs? For
example, someone might decide to ask who leaked hearsay from
raw FBI files to Bob Woodward on the drinking habits of John
Tower. Or someone could investigate which Senators leaked
from an FBI file that said banking-nominee Tim Ryan admitted
he'd once used cocaine. But of course, some leaks (and some
targets) are more equal than others.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>In the NEA case, for example, the leak was not of FBI
files, but of how taxpayer money was being spent. Evans and
Novak learned of an NEA decision to fund the "performance
art" of one Karen Finley, a nightclub performer whose
artistic and ideological program has been to shock audiences
with anatomical crudities. The NEA already is under political
siege for funding the homoerotic works of Robert Mapplethorpe
and body-fluid art of Andres Serrano. So the "leak" was a
threat to its annual $171 million taxpayer subsidy for
artists.</p>
<p>John Frohnmayer, the NEA chairman, was angry enough about
the leak that he had computer experts sift NEA phone logs,
Evans and Novak report. This turned up a phone call between
them and Alvin Felzenberg, who nonetheless denies being the
source of the leak. In this, he's seconded by the columnists,
who also say the White House intervened to save Mr.
Felzenberg's job, though he is now without anything to do and
awaits a transfer.</p>
<p>This flap follows the outrage over last year's leak
alleging an FBI investigation of Pennsylvania Congressman
Bill Gray. The story came as Mr. Gray was running for
majority whip, and was repudiated quickly by the Justice
Department. FBI agents had interviewed Mr. Gray, but he
wasn't a target of the investigation. Yet the incident caused
an uproar that continued for months.</p>
<p>Justice assigned 11 FBI special agents, who spent 385
workdays looking for the leaker. They interviewed 109 people.
Ten officials, including Attorney General Dick Thornburgh,
even took lie detector tests. Two officials who took those
tests ended up being transferred or demoted because they had
played a role in "confirming" the fact of an investigation.</p>
<p>Who leaked the Bill Gray story was even a question asked
by newspapers who benefit daily from leaks. (The Washington
Post also reported, with a straight face, Senator Joseph
Biden's pique that someone had leaked to these columns a copy
of his outrageous document request to then-judicial nominee
Clarence Thomas.) Yet indignation seems missing over the leak
on Tim Ryan's drug use.</p>
<p>Mr. Ryan was confirmed later by the full Senate, but it's
clear somebody hoped the cocaine leak would destroy him, even
though he had volunteered it to the FBI. Senator John
Danforth's request for a formal investigation by the ethics
committee didn't even make news, though the leak clearly was
a violation of Senate rules. And of course, leaks from the
FBI files were instrumental in defeating Mr. Tower. Who took
lie detector tests?</p>
<p>So it seems that leaks to Post reporters are scoops; leaks
to Evans and Novak are a breach of trust. Leaks about the
executive branch are news; leaks about Congress are
underhanded politics. In truth, it's all politics, and leaks
have become a standard part of the way the game is played in
Washington. If the rules can't be changed, they ought to be
made the same for all players.</p>
