	<p class="article-leader">SLOWER GROWTH FOR JAPAN</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Profit growth at Japanese companies will fall sharply in
fiscal 1990, which began April 1, as the weak yen and high
interest rates and crude-oil prices take their toll on the
nation's economy, two securities-research institutes
forecast.</p>
<p>Signs that the pace of the economy's expansion is falling
can't be denied, according to the two think tanks, Okasan
Economic Research Institute and Sanyo Economic Research
Institute.</p>
<p>Okasan forecast pretax profit for all Japanese
corporations would increase 2.0% in fiscal 1990, compared
with the 7.5% pace seen in the previous year. Excluding
electric utilities, Okasan said growth is expected at a
stronger 4.8% in fiscal 1990, but still below 11.5% in the
previous year.</p>
<p>As of the end of May, Japan's economy had expanded for 42
consecutive months, matching the second-longest period of
growth since World War II.</p>
<p>HUNGARIAN HOTEL PROJECT</p>
<p>French hotel group Accor S.A. has teamed up with another
French company, Nord France Entreprises Internationales and
Hungary's Groupe Pannonia and Hungarian Co. 43 to build and
operate a 300-bed Ibis hotel in Budapest. Accor said the
hotel would require a total investment of about 150 million
French francs ($26.2 million). Accor's hotel interests
include the Ibis, Novotel, Sofitel, Mercure and Urbis chains.
Accor said Nord France and state-owned Hungarian Co. 43 will
build the hotel, while Accor and Groupe Pannonia will manage
it.

<p>IRAQ'S FOREIGN DEBT</p>
<p>Iraq has repaid nearly $3.5 billion dollars of its foreign
debt this year, Trade Minister Mohammed Mehdi Saleh said. He
said the repayment was made despite a drop in the price of
oil earlier in the year. He didn't identify the repaid
creditors and didn't say whether the payments were in cash or
oil. Western estimates place Iraq's total foreign debt at
between $50 billion and $65 billion.</p>
<p>INVESTING IN INDIA</p>
<p>Hong Kong's Indosuez Asia Investment Services Ltd. said it
has formed the Himalayan Fund, which will invest primarily in
India but also in the stock markets of Sri Lanka, Bangladesh
and Nepal. Three other international funds -- two sponsored
by units of Merrill Lynch & Co. and one by a unit of Morgan
Stanley & Co. -- already exist for the Indian market, but
Himalayan Fund is the first to venture into the other
nations. The $100 million fund will be listed on the London
stock exchange.</p>
<p>QUIET IN SOUTH KOREA</p>
<p>Despite threats by student radicals to kidnap him, the
U.S. Ambassador to South Korea, Donald Gregg, reopened the
American Cultural Center in the South Korean city of Kwangju.
The reopening of the center, closed for 13 months because of
frequent firebombings, occurred without incident. The center
has been a lightening rod for attacks by student radicals who
blame the U.S. for Korean troops firing upon protesters in
Kwangju in May 1980. The U.S. says it had no role in the
incident, when almost 200 people died.</p>
<p>HOME TO VIETNAM</p>
<p>About 23,000 Vietnamese now working in Bulgaria will
return home by the end of 1992 because of "changes in the
Bulgarian situation," the official Vietnam News Agency said.
Over the past decade, Vietnam has sent thousands of workers
to East Bloc countries, with the labor export helping repay
some of Vietnam's debts to the host countries. But the
political and economic changes in Eastern Europe and the
Soviet Union will lead to the repatriation of most of the
estimated 180,000 workers during the next few years.</p>
<p>END OF BANANA WAR</p>
<p>Negotiators for Chiquita Brands International Inc. and
Fyffes PLC agreed to share disputed bananas, bringing an end
to a four-month banana war in Honduras.</p>
<p>The conflict, which had pit Cincinnati-based Chiquita
against Fyffes Group Ltd., was the subject of a front-page
story in The Wall Street Journal last week. In the dispute,
Chiquita said Fyffes paid the Echeverri family, Honduras'
largest independent banana growers, $2.5 million to break
their contract to supply Chiquita with bananas. The
Echeverris said the contract was void, and Fyffes said it was
dealing with free agents.</p>
<p>The agreement calls for the two companies to split the
fruit produced by farms owned by the Echeverris, with
Chiquita getting the larger share, until April 1991.
Afterwards, the Echeverris will be free to sell to whomever
they want.</p>
<p>Neil McCann, the chairman of Fyffes, said both sides
"secured some winnings." Chiquita's general counsel, Charles
Morgan, said Chiquita had established the principle of the
validity of contracts.</p>
<p>POSTSCRIPTS . . .</p>
<p>The Finnish Sauna Society is campaigning to stop
foreigners from using the word sauna to describe what the
society says are often really houses of prostitution. "We
have no copyright on the word sauna, but it is a cause of
annoyance to the Finn when he sees the word being misused in
other countries," said a society official. . . . News of
Alberto Fujimori's victory in Peru's presidential election
brought joy to Kawachi, the small Japanese town where his
father was born. Townspeople "broke open a sake barrel and
toasted the new president to cries of `Banzai]' " Kawachi's
mayor said.</p>
