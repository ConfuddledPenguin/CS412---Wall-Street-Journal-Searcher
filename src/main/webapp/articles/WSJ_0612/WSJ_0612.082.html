	<p class="article-leader">International Business Machines Corp. is rolling out a
program to become more of a service company and cut its
reliance on traditional hardware sales.
   The computer giant has racked up five years of lackluster
results as competition has slashed profit margins on computer
hardware. Growth in software revenue, once hailed as IBM's
likely savior, has slowed too. So IBM is increasingly turning
to services -- both to generate fees and to increase demand
for its hardware and software.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The new program won't be a quick fix. Most other companies
in the industry have the same idea, and IBM's credentials in
so-called professional services are a mixed bag.</p>
<p>Still, customers, consultants and even some competitors
say the new IBM program, called Enterprise Alliance, will
help IBM on its way. And IBM executives say they will be able
to use some of the ideas behind Enterprise Alliance
profitably in other areas.</p>
<p>"It's a very smart approach," says Mel Bergstein, a senior
vice president in the consulting arm of Computer Sciences
Corp., which offers systems integration and professional
services.</p>
<p>Enterprise Alliance is simple in concept. IBM sends in a
small team to talk about a specific problem -- the difficulty
that companies have in pulling together data stored in
different types of databases on hardware from numerous
companies.</p>
<p>Once the customer picks an instance of that problem that
it wants solved, a handful of IBM programmers produce a
prototype of a piece of software -- usually in about a month.
The people who run the part of the business that will use the
software then suggest changes, and IBM's programmers produce
a finished piece of software. The whole process takes about
three months. For its troubles, IBM collects a fee of
$75,000.</p>
<p>But that's just the beginning. The customer could then ask
IBM to solve that sort of problem in other areas. Because the
inability to pull together data from different sources is one
of the biggest problems in corporate computer operations, the
projects could be enormous. Even proceeding on their own,
many customers, having been shown the way, will tackle the
problem more quickly than they would have otherwise. That, of
course, means buying more hardware and software -- and much
of the equipment will have those big blue IBM logos on it.</p>
<p>"We're not doing this to get $75,000. We're doing this to
get that relationship," says Bob Berland, an IBM vice
president involved with Enterprise Alliance.</p>
<p>Marshall Balter, director of the program at IBM, says
several hundred people are already involved in the project
and the number will grow rapidly. IBM has completed only a
few pilot projects under Enterprise Alliance, but Mr. Balter
says that number should hit 40 or 50 this summer. And, while
it's still too early to forecast precisely the program's
impact, initial reports are favorable.</p>
<p>"I'm such a cynic when it comes to computer systems," says
John Gunn, executive vice president at Memorial Sloan
Kettering Cancer Center, New York, site of one pilot project.
"It always takes five times as long to write as anybody
budgeted and costs 10 times as much as anybody hoped." But he
says that IBM finished on time and that the $75,000 fee was
one-half to one-third as much as it would have cost him to
write the software himself. "Quite frankly, IBM surprised the
hell out of me," he says.</p>
<p>Mr. Gunn says the software IBM wrote lets physicians at
one site easily get all sorts of information -- lab reports,
billing information, some medical records, pharmacy records
and so forth -- even though that had proved difficult in the
past and even though not all the information is stored in IBM
computers.</p>
<p>David Roberts, senior vice president of corporate
information services at the Federal National Mortgage
Association, another pilot site, says, "We've found the
program to be very productive." He's cautious, saying that he
doesn't expect the association -- a reseller of mortgages
that is commonly known as Fannie Mae -- to buy any more
hardware or software because of the project. Still, he says
that he may make the purchases more quickly than he would
have otherwise and that he's more likely to buy from IBM.</p>
<p>As IBM prospects for more business, potential corporate
customers and some competitors say it will face significant
hurdles. For one thing, while corporate customers are
increasingly trying to turn over their headaches to
consultants and systems integrators, many are leery of
dealing with a company that also makes hardware or software.
They fear they could wind up buying a piece of IBM equipment
even if it isn't the best available for the job.</p>
<p>"That is a significant disadvantage for IBM," says Jim
Fischer, managing partner of technology services at Andersen
Consulting, one of IBM's biggest competitors.</p>
<p>In addition, companies that do systems integration work
need to really understand the problems at, say, the bank or
manufacturer that is doing the buying, and IBM is newer at
that game than some of its competitors.</p>
<p>"This all boils down to how good the people are, and IBM
hasn't yet developed the skills that they need," says James
Sutter, vice president of information systems at Rockwell
International Corp.</p>
<p>But at the same time, IBM has plenty of close
relationships with customers that it can use to build the
business. Mr. Sutter, for instance, says IBM "certainly has
the staying power and the presence" to be a force in systems
integration. In addition, access to capital is becoming
increasingly important for companies in this field as the
projects they undertake become larger, and IBM can beat just
about anybody at that game.</p>
<p>IBM also has plenty of experience with the technology.</p>
<p>IBM's computer guys "are actually using a lot of their
systems within their own manufacturing operations," says Ace
Hall, general manager of General Dynamics Corp.'s data
systems division. "They have real-life experience, whereas
the consulting people (at many other firms) don't have that
kind of thing."</p>
<p>Some corporate customers even like dealing with a hardware
company on systems integration. They say they think it gives
them additional say on future products.</p>
<p>"I want to influence the products and services that IBM
provides as they go down the road rather than sitting back
and hoping they provide what I want," says Mr. Roberts of
Fannie Mae.</p>
<p>Somehow or other, IBM needs to become a bigger factor in
systems integration and other service arenas. Market-research
firms say systems integration is a $20 billion-a-year market
that is growing some 20% annually. Yet the computer industry
as a whole is growing less than half that fast, and IBM is
feeling pressure on all fronts.</p>
<p>IBM said in the late '80s that it wanted more than half
its revenue to come from software and services by the early
'90s, but progress has been slow. IBM's revenue from
software, maintenance services and its systems integration
business with the federal government totaled $17.5 billion
last year, or less than 30% of its total revenue of $62.7
billion. And that $17.5 billion wasn't much higher than the
1988 figure.</p>
<p>Whatever happens, Mr. Berland of IBM says he hopes
Enterprise Alliance will be "a paradigm for the '90s." Mr.
Balter says that, for one thing, IBM thinks the production of
software ought to be faster, with ultimate users getting a
chance to see an early prototype and adapt it to their needs.
The huge backlog of requests for software at corporations is
widely considered to be one of the biggest impediments to the
growth of the computer industry. In addition, much of the
software misses the mark because there is often little
communication between the people writing it and those who
will use it.</p>
<p>Mr. Berland says he hopes Enterprise Alliance will also be
an example of how IBM should approach its customers:
Traditionally, IBM has dealt with data-processing
departments, but under the new program, it is trying to deal
more with the people who actually run the corporate
customer's business.</p>
<p>"Many companies are talking about closer partnerships with
customers," says Sam Albert, a consultant in Scarsdale, N.Y.,
"but this is a real demonstration of that. This could
potentially mean a great deal of revenue."</p>
