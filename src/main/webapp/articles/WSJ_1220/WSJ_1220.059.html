	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Wall Street, beset by an avalanche of investor
complaints, is increasingly prodding small investors to
mediate -- rather than arbitrate -- disputes with brokers.
   The National Association of Securities Dealers, which
handles two-thirds of all arbitration filings, has launched a
pilot program that encourages investors and brokerage firms
to try the mediation route. Several stock exchanges and the
American Arbitration Association also are urging investors to
use mediation.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Mediation has long been used in labor and other disputes,
but has been slow to catch on in the securities business.
Unlike litigation or arbitration, there is no formal hearing
or binding decision when a case goes to mediation. Instead,
the parties voluntarily meet to try to hammer out a
settlement.</p>
<p>"It's a way to get people together early on in their case,
cut costs and have a neutral party listen and evaluate both
sides," says Deborah Masucci, the NASD's director of
arbitration.</p>
<p>The typical result: quicker and less costly cases for
investors and brokers. And mediation helps reduce the
fattening caseload of arbitration cases involving the
securities industry and unhappy investors. In the NASD pilot
program, about 60% of the cases that went to mediation were
settled, compared with about a bit more than 50% in
arbitration.</p>
<p>While most securities disputes are heard by a panel of
three arbitrators who decide the case, mediation typically is
handled by an independent attorney in an informal series of
meetings. The mediator's job is to work with the parties to
analyze the case and settle it. Most securities mediation
cases are heard before the American Arbitration Association
or U.S. Arbitration and Mediation Inc.</p>
<p>"A mediator's role, as opposed to that of arbitrators, is
one of conciliation, not decision-making," says Richard P.
Ryder, editor of the Securities Arbitration Commentator, a
Maplewood, N.J., newsletter. "He doesn't sit as a judge, but
more of a referee."</p>
<p>Securities specialists applaud the move toward mediation.
They say the process helps investors and brokers analyze
their disputes and find ways to reach a compromise. "A lot of
these cases just have to do with how much a broker is going
to pay to get rid of the claim," says Robert Coulson,
president of the American Arbitration Association.</p>
<p>Investors typically sign an agreement when they open a
brokerage account, binding them to accept arbitration rather
than file a lawsuit if a dispute arises. While arbitration is
less costly than litigation, the buildup in arbitration cases
is leading securities firms to look to mediation as an even
less costly alternative.</p>
<p>But mediation is no panacea. Sometimes, investors or
brokers don't need or want it; they are able to reach a
settlement amicably without mediation. More important, the
facts or circumstances of some cases lead the parties to want
to avoid any kind of compromise.</p>
<p>And some securities lawyers claim that investors lose out
in mediation because they typically are giving up the chance
to get back all they claimed is owed them.</p>
<p>"Most people go into arbitration with the idea that they
want to win it all or be prepared to lose it all," says
Jeffrey L. Liddle, a New York lawyer who often handles
arbitration cases against brokerage firms.</p>
<p>The NASD's recent pilot program is far from a smashing
success. After randomly selecting 203 cases to refer to
mediation, only in 36 cases did both parties agree to attempt
mediation. Says the NASD's Ms. Masucci: "The number of cases
funneled into mediation is smaller than we really expected."</p>
<p>Still, the mediation cases were closed out more quickly
than arbitration. The average mediated case took nine months,
compared with nearly a year for arbitration, the NASD says.</p>
<p>And mediation in securities cases is picking up steam.
Although statistics aren't available on the number of
securities disputes being mediated, "we're seeing more of it,
because it works," says the American Arbitration
Association's Mr. Coulson.</p>
<p>At least, the parties agreeing to mediation have nothing
to lose. If they can't hammer out a settlement, they can
always go to arbitration.</p>
