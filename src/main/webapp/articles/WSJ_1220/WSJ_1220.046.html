	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- The Financial Accounting Standards Board, in
one of the most significant changes to accounting ever,
issued a rule on post-retirement health benefits that could
cut corporate profits by hundreds of billions of dollars.
   The controversial new rule, approved unanimously by the
FASB's seven members, requires companies beginning in 1993 to
accrue, or set up a reserve for, future medical benefits of
retirees rather than deduct them from reported profits each
year when paid, as is current practice. Government officials
estimate that the rule may reduce total corporate profits by
at least $200 billion -- and maybe by as much as $1 trillion
-- over a period of years.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"It's the most significant accounting change since the
adoption of depreciation about 80 years ago," says Eugene H.
Flegm, assistant controller of General Motors Corp.</p>
<p>Like most corporate executives, Mr. Flegm agrees with the
basic principle of accruing such benefits because they are a
real and rapidly growing obligation. But he is unhappy that
the FASB wasn't able to do more damage control in framing the
rule. "We're not thrilled by this new FASB statement {rule}
because we're not sure it will produce accurate enough data
worthy of the annual financial statement," he said.</p>
<p>For some time, it has been clear that the rule would
sharply reduce reported corporate profits. But now that
companies and their benefit consultants are crunching more
definite numbers, they are discovering exactly how great the
damage will be -- even with recent FASB changes to
accommodate corporate gripes.</p>
<p>Companies with long-standing union contracts guaranteeing
health benefits are particularly concerned. For example,
financial analysts and actuaries estimate the rule could
reduce General Motors Corp.'s annual reported profits by more
than $600 million, or about $1 a share. For 1989, GM reported
after-tax profit of $4.2 billion, or $6.33 a share.</p>
<p>Asked about this estimate, Mr. Flegm said it is too early
to gauge the FASB rule's effect on GM profits "but there's no
question it will be a significant number."</p>
<p>For some big industrial companies, the rule could wipe out
retained earnings or possibly stockholder's equity, depending
on how they apply it, say financial analysts and accountants.</p>
<p>Financial analysts, for example, point to Chrysler Corp.,
whose actual "pay-as-you-go" retiree health costs amounted to
$260 million in 1989, or 47% of pretax profits. Actuaries and
health-benefit consultants say the FASB rule could boost
annual health-care costs on an accrual basis for Chrysler by
as much as six times.</p>
<p>And the huge amount that Chrysler would have to book to
catch up on health-care retiree costs for its current
employees could wipe out its retained earnings of $5.2
billion reported last Dec. 31, say financial analysts,
actuaries and accountants. Chrysler declines to confirm or
deny this estimate. "We aren't in a position to estimate the
potential impact {of the FASB rule} . . . due to the
flexibility that the company will have in implementing it," a
Chrysler spokesman said.</p>
<p>Under the final version of the FASB rule, however,
Chrysler has an out. It can spread that catch-up accrual
costs over the next 20 years, avoiding the major damage to
its financial results. All companies, in fact, may amortize
such costs over the two decades or take the big hit
immediately over one of the next three years.</p>
<p>But the dual choice will make it tough for financial
analysts to compare corporate financial results. "It's an
analyst's nightmare," said Pat McConnell, a managing director
with Bear Stearns & Co. who publishes an accounting
newsletter for the securities firm.</p>
<p>The new FASB rule also creates tricky new problems for
business in designing health-plan changes. "The new FASB
statement {rule} contains a lot of minefields that will
trigger damage to the bottom line for unwary companies making
such changes," warns Harold Dankner, a benefits-consulting
partner in Washington, D.C., with Coopers & Lybrand, a major
accounting firm based in New York. For example, the rule
immediately penalizes reported profits if new health-plan
changes aren't consistent with past practice, says Mr.
Dankner.</p>
<p>Timothy Lucas, research director for FASB, the chief
rulemaking body for accountants, based in Norwalk, Conn.,
concedes that the new rule "does have a downside for
financial analysis." Mr. Lucas says the dual accounting
treatment "was in response to some corporate requests for
relief" from the huge catch-up charge for the current work
force.</p>
<p>But many companies are still riled at the FASB for not
providing more relief from the rule. Currently, companies
only deduct health-care benefits from profits as they are
paid each year because, unlike pension benefits, such costs
aren't tax-deductible.</p>
<p>Paul Lukens, chairman of a subcommittee on health-benefit
accounting of the 13,500-member Financial Executives
Institute, asked the FASB to ease the rule even further but
was rejected.</p>
<p>Mr. Lukens asked the FASB to calculate benefits from the
date of hire until actual retirement rather than the date of
eligibility for benefits, which would have reduced the profit
decline by as much as 15%. He asked the FASB to permit
companies to deduct the accrual costs from retained earnings
-- where the reduction is less damaging to a company's
stock-market performance and debt-raising -- rather than
profits. And he asked that a less-punitive index be used to
measure such costs.</p>
<p>Many companies haven't yet decided whether to implement
the rule now or over 20 years. "We're tilting toward a
one-time hit but we still haven't made up our minds," said
Earl Timmons, vice president and controller of Du Pont Co. in
Wilmington, Del. "Why choose to hemorrhage your earnings over
20 years when you can get the entire hemorrhage behind you?"
he says.</p>
<p>Some companies are reducing their health-care costs for
retirees to ease the effect of the FASB rule, which has been
under study for years. American Telephone & Telegraph Co.,
for example, last year negotiated with its union to pay
health-care benefits to retirees to a maximum fixed amount,
based on years of service.</p>
<p>This dollar-denominated cap -- in contrast to open-ended
medical benefits that many companies offer retirees -- will
help reduce health costs from 30% to 50% in the future when
retirees begin sharing premium costs in mid-1995, AT&T said.</p>
<p>And Grand Metropoliton PLC's Pillsbury subsidiary in
Minneapolis is giving employees dollar credits for years of
service to be applied to retiree health care.</p>
<p>Coopers & Lybrand's Mr. Dankner said that with the FASB
rule, companies will have to be very careful to avoid
immediate impact on their profits. "Its very tricky," he
adds.</p>
