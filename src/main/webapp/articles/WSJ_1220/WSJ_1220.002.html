	<p class="article-leader">BEIJING -- The fear of losing special U.S. trade
privileges appears to be causing China to alter its attitude
and begin paying attention to U.S. complaints about human
rights violations.
   U.S. Ambassador James Lilly and Richard Schifter,
assistant secretary of state for human rights, say they
detected this change during 16 hours of talks with Chinese
officials.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"Judging from the way this issue was handled one year ago,
with people snarling at each other over the table, at least
the atmosphere was substantially improved," Mr. Lilly said
last night. "Attitudinally, you've got a sea change."</p>
<p>Mr. Lilly and Mr. Schifter met with some 30 Chinese
officials from the Ministry of Public Security, Supreme
People's Court, Ministry of Justice and several other
agencies. The meetings were arranged after China's foreign
minister, Qian Qichen, visited President Bush at the White
House in late November, ending a policy that banned
high-level meetings with China.</p>
<p>Mr. Schifter said he gave Chinese officials a list of 150
political prisoners and asked that those not convicted of
acts of violence be released from jail. The list contained
names of people jailed for participating in last year's
Tiananmen Square demonstrations as well as names of Tibetans,
Catholic priests and people still in jail from participating
in protests 10 years ago.</p>
<p>The Americans said that by accepting the list, the Chinese
displayed a change of attitude. Since the June 4, 1989,
Tiananmen massacre, Chinese officials had dismissed America's
complaints as interference in China's internal affairs. But
the diplomats said that Chinese officials gave no indications
whether they will take actions to improve human rights.</p>
<p>Mr. Schifter said that he pointed out to the Chinese that
Congress is overwhelmingly in favor of punishing China
economically. The U.S. House of Representatives on Oct. 18
approved legislation by a 383-30 vote to end China's Most
Favored Nation trade status unless specific human rights
improvements take place.</p>
<p>Foreign trade now equals 30% of China's gross national
product, as compared to about 9% in 1978, the year before
economic reform began. The country's exports to America are
expected to total $16.5 billion this year, which represents
27% of China's exports and an increase of $4.5 billion from
last year.</p>
<p>Many diplomats believe that the Communist Party realizes
it will remain in power only if China's economy remains
healthy. As a result, some diplomats believe that America's
huge share of China's exports provides enough leverage to get
China to act on human rights.</p>
