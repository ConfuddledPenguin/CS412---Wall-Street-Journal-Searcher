	<p class="article-leader">DETROIT -- Ford Motor Co. is recalling 11,000 1989
Econoline 150 and 250 vans with 5.8-liter engines to assure
acceptable exhaust emissions.
   In some cases, certain emission control system nylon
vacuum hoses may be damaged as a result of contact with the
hot surfaces in the area, resulting in unacceptable oxides of
nitrogen emission levels, Ford said. The auto maker will
notify owners through the mail.</p>
