	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- The U.S. has a big stake in whether the
German government finances reunification through raising
taxes or borrowing, the U.S. Congressional Budget Office
said.
   If Germany does what former President Ronald Reagan did a
decade ago and borrows heavily in world markets to finance
government spending, the CBO projects that U.S. interest
rates in the 1990s will be about one percentage point higher
than they otherwise would be.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>But if Germany raises the money by taxing its citizens,
U.S. interest rates will be only about three-tenths of a
percentage point higher, the CBO study projects.</p>
<p>For years, Germany has been supplying savings to the rest
of the world, but the huge cost of rebuilding the former East
Germany will change this signficantly.</p>
<p>"In recent years, the U.S. budget deficit has kept real
{inflation-adjusted} interest rates high," said the
congressional Joint Economic Committee, which requested the
study on how changes in Europe will affect the U.S. economy.
"The budget agreement just enacted is designed to alleviate
the deficit's upward pressure on interest rates, but this
could be countered by the interest-rate effects of German
fiscal policy."</p>
<p>The CBO projections rely on a computer model of the
economy developed by Warwick McKibbin of the Reserve Bank of
Australia and Jeffrey Sachs of Harvard University.</p>
