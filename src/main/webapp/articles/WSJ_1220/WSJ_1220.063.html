	<p class="article-leader">Pennsylvania companies that accepted protection under the
state's controversial anti-takeover law are getting hit by a
barrage of challenges from disgruntled shareholders.
   Members of the United Shareholders of America, a
Washington, D.C.-based group backed by T. Boone Pickens, have
filed holder initiatives against Aluminum Co. of America, PPG
Industries Inc., and AMP Inc., and also will file a proposal
at Zurn Industries Inc. The initiatives direct the companies
to reincorporate elsewhere, or take other measures, to escape
the state takeover protection. In addition, the influential
California Public Employee Retirement System filed
resolutions directing Armstrong World Industries Inc. and
Scott Paper Co. to reincorporate in Delaware.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>These six companies are the largest Pennsylvania concerns
that accepted protection under the state law. Alcoa, Amp and
Scott confirmed they had received proposals. Armstrong and
PPG declined to comment. Zurn said it hadn't yet received a
proposal.</p>
<p>Proponents believe they have widespread support for the
initiatives, which will appear on the ballot at the
companies' annual meetings this spring unless they are
withdrawn or are found to violate Security and Exchange
Commission guidelines.</p>
<p>The companies are expected to oppose the resolutions, and
-- as with all such resolutions -- won't be formally bound by
them if passed. Still, the initiatives underscore the
hostility that many investors feel toward both the
anti-takeover act and the companies that accepted its
protection.</p>
<p>"This law is the worst ever," asserts Ralph Whitworth,
United Shareholders president. "Pennsylvania's winning the
race to the bottom."</p>
<p>The Pennsylvania law, which took effect April 27, is
considered by many investors to be among the nation's
toughest against takeovers. Shareholders claim it violates
their rights and hurts stock value. Of the 117 companies with
capitalization of over $10 million in Pennsylvania, 80 opted
out of protection under the new law.</p>
<p>Under the law, Pennsylvania companies had until July 26 to
opt out of protection. The only way companies can opt out now
is to pressure the state to re-open the opt-out period, to
reincorporate in another state, or to merge with a shell
company that already had accepted the opt-out provision.</p>
<p>United Shareholder member Howard Hodges, who owns 200
Alcoa shares and filed the Alcoa initiative, said his
proposal would give Alcoa two years to find a way to opt out
of the Pennsylvania law, or else reincorporate in another
state. Mr. Hodges said he resubmitted his proposal to soften
its critical language after meeting with Alcoa Chairman Paul
O'Neill, but refused to withdraw it. "The Pennsylvania
statute does violence to the shareholders' right to vote," he
said.</p>
<p>In an apparent concession to shareholders, the Pittsburgh
aluminum concern quietly dropped a "poison pill" shareholder
rights plan after it accepted coverage under the
anti-takeover law. The plan limited a would-be buyer's voting
power. But Mr. Whitworth calls Alcoa's concession "empty
symbolism" since the state law provides similar protection.</p>
<p>Investors have been particularly irked by one provision in
the law that amends the "fiduciary duty" standards so that
company directors needn't consider shareholder interests
dominant over employee, community, and creditor interests.
The law also provides a "disgorgement" provision, which
directs takeover bidders to return profits to the company
that they made by putting the company in play.</p>
