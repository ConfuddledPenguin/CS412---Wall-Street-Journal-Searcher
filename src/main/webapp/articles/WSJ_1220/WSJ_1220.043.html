	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- The U.S. Conference of Mayors reported that
public sympathy toward the homeless is dwindling.
   "People don't seem to have the tolerance for homeless
people that they used to have," said Sue Myrick, mayor of
Charlotte, N.C., at a news conference held to announce the
mayors' latest study on homelessness.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The change is reflected in the trend toward limiting
homeless people's access to public property. Nine of the 30
cities surveyed in the mayors' study reported such actions,
ranging from a panhandling ban on New York City subways to
enforcement of a no-sleeping ordinance in San Francisco's
Civic Center Plaza to removal of homeless camps under bridges
in Portland, Ore.</p>
<p>City officials not identified in the study reported that
the public seemed increasingly testy about the homeless
population. "People seem to be tiring of the problem," said
an official from Providence, R.I. "There is an increasing
tendency to blame the homeless for being homeless."</p>
<p>Advocates of the homeless also noted the public's growing
hostility. "Certainly, as panhandlers have gotten more
aggressive, I think there have been instances where people
are intimidated," said Joan Alker, assistant director of the
National Coalition for the Homeless. "After that's been
happening for a few years, people's attitudes start to
harden."</p>
<p>Even the opinion-making class, whose members just a few
years ago were trumpeting the plight of the homeless, appears
to be fed up with the issue. In a recent New York magazine
cover story titled "How to Save New York," commentators
ranging from novelist Michael M. Thomas to real estate
developer and publisher Mortimer Zuckerman called for a less
sympathetic attitude toward "vagrants," as Mr. Zuckerman
called them.</p>
<p>One reason for the new hostility may be the growing size
of the homeless population. According to the mayors' study,
requests for emergency shelter increased during the past year
by an average of 24%. Nineteen percent of the homeless people
requesting emergency shelter were turned away, usually
because the cities lacked proper facilities to house them.</p>
<p>Another factor in the public's attitude may be the lack of
adequate facilities for the mentally ill homeless, who are
estimated in the mayors' report to constitute 28% of the
homeless population. "I'm seeing more and more mentally ill
people on the street," said Boston Mayor Raymond Flynn, who
every night ferries homeless people to Boston shelters. "I
don't even know where to take them."</p>
<p>The housing bill recently signed by President Bush sets
aside $123.2 million for housing for the homeless, tied to
the provision of services such as mental health care and the
rehabilitation of drug users. But Congress hasn't yet funded
the bill.</p>
