quarterly cash dividend 20% to three cents a share from 2.5
cents, payable Feb. 15 to stock of record Feb. 1. The parent
of Penn Savings Bank and Yardley Bank for Savings also
declared a 6-for-5 stock split in the form of a 20% stock
dividend, payable Feb. 15 to stock of record Jan. 31. The
split will increase total shares outstanding to about 3.3
million. The cash dividend will be paid on the new number of

maximize shareholder value, based on the company's financial
strength. Sovereign had third-quarter net income of $1.6
million, or 57 cents a share.</p>
