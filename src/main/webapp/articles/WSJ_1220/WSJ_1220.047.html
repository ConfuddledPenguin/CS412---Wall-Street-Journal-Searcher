	<p class="article-leader">TOKYO -- All Nippon Airways, caught in an intensifying
battle between the U.S. and European aircraft industries, has
decided to split orders for its next generation of midsize
jetliners between each side.
   In a long-awaited announcement, the Japanese airline said
Wednesday that it will spend as much as $4.1 billion on
orders for Seattle-based Boeing Co.'s new 777 model and as
much as $1.7 billion on orders for the A-340 made by Europe's
Airbus Industrie consortium.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>All Nippon's is the second order for the 777, Boeing's
first all-new model in more than a decade, since it was
introduced in October. Industry officials have been closely
monitoring orders for the new plane to determine whether the
high-stakes Boeing project will succeed in the increasingly
competitive market. With its military segment losing money in
recent years, Boeing's profitability has been riding on its
commercial aircraft business.</p>
<p>All Nippon's decision to place one-third of its total new
order with Airbus gives the European consortium its first
contract in Japan for its midsize A-340. A spokesman for the
airline said the orders were the first that it had split for
one category of plane.</p>
<p>Boeing officials downplayed the split. "Certainly it isn't
unprecedented," a spokesman for the Boeing Commercial
Airplane Group said. "I think it's very difficult to
second-guess what a customer ultimately is going to do."</p>
<p>All Nippon said it is committed to buying 15 777s, which
Boeing values at $2.6 billion in delivery-year dollars,
including spares and support, and has options to buy 10 more.
ANA also placed five firm orders with Airbus and took options
on five more A-340s. The airline spokesman said the company
has never canceled an option. Industry observers say such a
move can increase maintenance costs.</p>
<p>Many analysts and industry officials also believe All
Nippon split the orders "for political reasons," said Peggy
Furusaka, an airline analyst with Baring Securities Ltd.'s
Tokyo office. Competitors have accused Airbus's European
sponsors of using subsidized rates and the lure of potential
European landing rights to secure orders and develop a viable
aircraft industry.</p>
<p>An Airbus official in Tokyo strongly denied that the
consortium used either tactic to get the All Nippon contract.
By choosing the A-340, the airline has helped to sow "the
seeds of an even deeper and longer-lasting relationship
between our two companies," Airbus managing director Jean
Pierson said in a statement.</p>
<p>Boeing itself gave All Nippon a few incentives to buy the
777, including turning over 20% of the plane's development to
Japan's three leading aircraft makers. "Unless Japanese
companies purchase this," said Noriko Umino, an analyst for
Jardine Fleming Securities Ltd., "Japanese bureaucrats who
make it a national policy to develop an aircraft industry
lose face."</p>
<p>In addition, "this reduces Japan's trade surplus" with the
U.S., said Jesus Duarte, an analyst with W.I. Carr (Overseas)
Ltd. The aircraft field is the last remaining major
industrial sector in which the U.S. has a trade surplus with
Japan.</p>
<p>The clear loser from ANA's decision is St. Louis-based
McDonnell Douglas Corp., whose midsize MD-11s were also under
consideration. The next major competition in Japan for
aircraft orders is expected to be a Japan Air Lines order in
the third quarter of 1991. Officials at the Douglas Aircraft
Co. unit in Long Beach, Calif., declined comment on the All
Nippon order.</p>
<p>Although Boeing controls more than half of the world
commercial-aircraft market, its new 360-seat wide-body 777
fills a longstanding gap in its lineup. The aircraft has
several features considered innovative, such as folding
wingtips that allow it to be parked in slots designed for
smaller planes. Boeing received its first order for the 777
two months ago, when UAL Corp., parent of United Airlines,
said it would buy as many as 68. All Nippon will begin taking
delivery of its planes in 1995.</p>
