	<p class="article-leader">MOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif. -- Sun Microsystems Inc., citing
concern over hostile takeover activity in the electronics
industry, strengthened its anti-takeover provisions.
   The computer maker said it reduced to 10% the amount of
Sun stock that a buyer must purchase before triggering a
"poison pill" that would dilute the buyer's holdings. Sun's
anti-takeover agreement previously set the trigger point at a
20% acquisition.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>William Raduchel, Sun's chief financial officer, said the
move wasn't a response to any specific takeover attempt
directed at Sun, but that American Telephone & Telegraph
Corp.'s hostile takeover bid for NCR Corp. "certainly
focussed peoples' attention on these issues."</p>
<p>Sun's anti-takeover provisions now give the holder of each
Sun share the right to buy another share at half the market
value if a person or group acquires 10% or more of Sun's
stock without the company's agreement. Sun said the amendment
won't affect AT&T's 19% holding in Sun as long as the phone
company honors the terms of its stock-purchase agreement
which forbids AT&T from buying more than 20% of Sun until
1998.</p>
