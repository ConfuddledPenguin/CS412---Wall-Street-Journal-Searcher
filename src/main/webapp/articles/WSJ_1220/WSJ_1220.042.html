	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- The government reported a steep decline in
the use of illegal drugs in the U.S. over the past five
years, leading President Bush to declare "our hard work is
paying off" in the war against drugs.
   A Department of Health and Human Services survey, based on
interviews with 9,259 people age 12 and older, found a 44%
drop in the overall number of Americans using illicit drugs,
to 12.9 million in 1990 from 23 million in 1985. The decline
in the current use of cocaine -- perhaps the biggest drug
scourge of the 1980s -- was even sharper. The survey showed a
72% decline in cocaine use, to 1.6 million this year from 5.8
million in 1985.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>But the use of crack, the most deadly form of cocaine,
remained steady. Of the 1.6 million cocaine users this year,
500,000 used crack. The department defined "current use" as
use within the past month.</p>
<p>Democratic lawmakers immediately disputed the findings,
claiming that they painted too sunny a picture of the
nation's progress in battling drugs.</p>
<p>The study "actually misses more addicts than it counts,"
charged Sen. Joseph Biden (D., Del.), chairman of the Senate
Judiciary Committee. His committee released its own study
yesterday that put the number of people who use cocaine at
least once a week at 2.4 million, compared with the 662,000
government figure.</p>
<p>Mr. Biden noted that the HHS survey, which was conducted
by the department's National Institute on Drug Abuse, only
measured drug use among the general population -- not among
people living in prisons, shelters, treatment centers and on
the streets.</p>
<p>Other critics said the survey showed that the improvement
being made was largely among the well-educated middle class,
where drug abuse tends to be occasional, rather than among
the poor.</p>
<p>The HHS survey reported that while occasional use of
cocaine has dwindled in recent years, the number of people
who use the drug daily increased during the past two years,
to 336,000 in 1990 from 292,000 in 1988.</p>
<p>"The favorable trends on casual drug use reported by the
survey cannot hide the fact that hard-core drug abuse in
America is a continuing crisis of epidemic proportions," said
Sen. Edward Kennedy (D., Mass.), chairman of the Senate Labor
and Human Resources Committee.</p>
<p>The HHS survey also reported:</p>
<p>-- The percentage of whites in the U.S. using cocaine at
least once a month fell to 0.6% this year from 1.3% in 1988
and 3% in 1985. For blacks, use fell to 1.7% from 2.6% in
1988 and 3.2% in 1985. For Hispanics, it dropped to 1.9% from
2% in 1988 and 2.4% in 1985.</p>
<p>-- Marijuana remains the most commonly used illicit drug
in the U.S., although its use has been falling since 1979.
That year, 22.5 million people, or 12.7% of the population
over age 12 used it at least once a month, compared with 10.2
million, or 5.1% of the population over age 12 this year.</p>
<p>-- Consumption of alcoholic beverages also has declined.
Nearly 103 million Americans drank alcohol at least once a
month this year, according to the government survey, down
from 105.8 million in 1988 and 113.1 million in 1985.</p>
<p>-- The number of adolescents using drugs fell by 13% over
the past two years, with 1.6 million youths aged 12 through
17 using drugs this year, compared with 1.8 million in 1988.
Adolescents using cocaine at least once a month fell 49% to
115,000 this year from 225,000 in 1988.</p>
