	<p class="article-leader">MILAN, Italy -- Acqua Pia Antica Marcia S.p.A., a holding
company headed by financier Vincenzo Romagnoli, has sold a
controlling stake in its diversified investment company
Bastogi S.p.A. to a consortium led by Milan real-estate
investor Giuseppe Cabassi, Italian newspapers reported.
   The Cabassi group reportedly will also acquire control of
Rome's Galleria Colonna, a centrally located arcade offering
commercial and office space.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The reports follow Mr. Romagnoli's resignation as
president of Bastogi and the appointment of Alphonso Amico, a
Cabassi group director, as Bastogi's managing director. Two
other Cabassi directors were also named to the Bastogi board.</p>
<p>The total price of the acquisition was put at 500 billion
lire ($445.8 million). Of that, an estimated 150 billion lire
would come from Mr. Cabassi's purchase of around 40% in
Bastogi, and the remainder from the Galleria Colonna sale.</p>
