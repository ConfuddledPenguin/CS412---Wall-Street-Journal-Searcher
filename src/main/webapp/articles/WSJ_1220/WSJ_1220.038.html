	<p class="article-leader">Bond traders cashed in all the big gains they made in
Tuesday's rally, but stock market investors held on to their
winnings.
   An accelerating round of profit-taking wiped out the gains
in Treasury bond prices that occurred Tuesday in the wake of
the Federal Reserve's decision to cut the discount rate.
Yesterday's profit-taking came despite yet another Fed move
to lower interest rates.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The central bank again cut the federal funds rate, which
banks charge one another for overnight loans, this time to 7%
from 7 1/4%. Still, the Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond
lost more than 1 1/8 points, or more than $11.25 for each
$1,000 of face amount.</p>
<p>But the Dow Jones Industrial Average ended unchanged at
2626.73 after wandering aimlessly all day. The dollar
rebounded from the drubbing it took Tuesday, while gold
prices posted an unexpected increase. Traders said the
$9.50-per-ounce gain was mostly a response to stepped-up gold
buying in the Middle East.</p>
<p>Analysts said bond traders had already bid prices higher
on speculation that the Fed would continue to aggressively
push down interest rates as the economy deteriorates. When
the Fed announced the discount-rate cut Tuesday, some traders
began to sell into the big bond rally. And when it became
evident yesterday that the Fed had once again cut the federal
funds rate, that was enough to persuade more bondholders to
sell before the expected lethargic trading of the holiday
season takes over.</p>
<p>The discount rate is the interest rate the Fed charges
member financial institutions for loans. A change in the rate
is a powerful symbol that the Fed is moving to stimulate the
economy with lower rates.</p>
<p>"Speculators saw a reward for their correct anticipation
that the Fed would ease, and they chose to take their profits
rather than carry them over into the new year," said Brian
Fabbri, chief economist for Midland Montagu in New York.</p>
<p>In major market action:</p>
<p>Stock prices were unchanged. Volume on the New York Stock
Exchange totaled 180.4 million shares. Advancing issues on
the Big Board were ahead of losers 854 to 712.</p>
<p>Bond prices slumped. The yield on the Treasury's benchmark
30-year issue climbed to 8.17%.</p>
<p>The dollar gained. In late New York trading the currency
was quoted at 1.4785 marks and 134.05 yen, compared with
1.4762 marks and 132.62 yen Tuesday.</p>
