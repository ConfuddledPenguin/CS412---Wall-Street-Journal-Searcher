	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co. said it is
adding two general partners, further expanding its leadership
beyond founding partners Henry Kravis and George Roberts.
   The new partners in the nation's largest leveraged buy-out
firm are Saul Fox, 37 years old, and R. Theodore Ammon, 41.
They both joined KKR as associates in 1984.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>KKR will continue to operate with a remarkably tiny cadre
of executives, relying on seven general partners and 10
associates to oversee an industrial empire with about $50
billion in sales. Through various investment partnerships,
KKR owns majority stakes in RJR Nabisco Inc., Safeway Stores
Inc., Duracell Holdings Corp. and more than a dozen other
sizable companies. Messrs. Ammon and Fox declined to comment,
as did other KKR executives.</p>
<p>People who have worked with KKR, though, say the
14-year-old firm appears to be deliberately spreading
authority beyond its best-known partners, Messrs. Kravis and
Roberts. "It's a good sign," said Richard Beattie, a KKR
attorney with Simpson Thacher & Bartlett. "Adding the new
general partners signals a maturation of the firm," he said.</p>
<p>With the new promotions, KKR also appears to be
acknowledging that significant parts of the firm's work in
recent years have been carried out by people other than
Messrs. Kravis and Roberts.</p>
<p>Mr. Fox, for one, has been closely involved with KKR's
investments in Motel 6 L.P. and Union Texas Petroleum Corp.
"He was the guy I worked with the most," said Joseph
McCarthy, president of Motel 6. Mr. McCarthy praised Mr. Fox
as "decisive and a good negotiator."</p>
<p>Mr. McCarthy also said Mr. Fox's background as a tax
attorney helped Motel 6 create some innovative partnerships
to help finance the lodging company's growth. "Anyone who can
understand something as complex as the U.S. tax rules can
sift their way through a deal structure of almost any kind,"
Mr. McCarthy said.</p>
<p>Mr. Ammon, in turn, played a major role in KKR's
investment in Storer Broadcasting Co., as well as its current
work with RJR. Some investment bankers have described Mr.
Ammon as a prickly negotiator. But RJR's general counsel,
Lawrence Ricciardi, said that Mr. Ammon, a lawyer by
training, has been a valuable contributor to RJR's financial
strategy.</p>
<p>"Ted was the guy driving RJR's recapitalization efforts,
day to day," Mr. Ricciardi said. "A lot of people were
involved, but he had a very important role. He's
extraordinarily creative. He has a gyroscopic ability to
swivel around and adjust to a changing financial
environment."</p>
<p>Messrs. Ammon and Fox become general partners at somewhat
of a crossroads for KKR. The firm skyrocketed to prominence
in the 1980s by completing more than $55 billion of
acquisitions, more than any other buyer. KKR both popularized
leveraged buy-outs -- in which companies are acquired
primarily with borrowed money -- and fueled wide
controversies about whether buy-outs were good or bad for the
U.S. economy.</p>
<p>In the past 18 months, however, the U.S. takeover business
has shrunk drastically. KKR has been casting about for new
business opportunities, including making small "toe-hold"
investments in public companies, forming alliances with
industry executives seeking acquisitions, and looking for
buy-outs overseas.</p>
<p>While Messrs. Ammon and Fox aren't likely to have nearly
as large an ownership share of KKR's earnings as Messrs.
Kravis and Roberts possess, they will now be able to add
their voices to the discussion about KKR's next strategic
moves.</p>
<p>KKR has long emphasized consensus in its internal
workings, so it's unlikely that Messrs. Ammon and Fox will
push the firm aggressively in any new direction. But their
promotion does tilt one small balance within KKR, Mr. Beattie
observes. "Four of the seven partners now are lawyers by
training," observed Mr. Beattie, a lawyer himself, adding,
"They've got the M.B.A.s outnumbered."</p>
