	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- The head of the Small Business
Administration's minority small-business program was removed
from her job effective immediately.
   Erlene Patrick, associate administrator for minority
small-business programs, was named to the post in August
1989. According to individuals close to the agency, she was
fired because the program, which has long been plagued by
controversy, hasn't improved under her leadership. The office
is responsible for helping minority-owned companies compete
for government contracts.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>SBA officials denied that Ms. Patrick had been fired. A
spokesman said that she would be reassigned as acting deputy
regional administrator in Boston effective Jan. 2. Ms.
Patrick couldn't be reached for comment, and SBA officials
wouldn't elaborate on a terse statement announcing the new
assignment.</p>
<p>The minority program has been under fire for alleged poor
service to participating companies and for operating under
unfair rules.</p>
<p>Before joining the SBA, Ms. Patrick was a member of the
staff of the Senate Small Business Committee. She also was
the principal author of the Minority Business Opportunity
Reform Act of 1988, which set tough new rules for the
government's program for minority-owned contractors.</p>
<p>In its statement, the SBA said Ms. Patrick was reassigned
to the office of finance effective immediately. Her deputy,
John Whitmore, will head the minority office until Jan. 2,
when Ike Washington, who now heads the minority programs in
the Atlanta region, will become the office's acting
administrator, an agency spokeswoman said.</p>
