	<p class="article-leader">They have adjusted their Brooks Brothers suspenders,
glanced at their Rolex President watches and marched off in
their Cole Haan loafers. Perhaps never to return.
   The demise of yuppies, those young exhibitionists of
consumerism, brings a smile to many working stiffs, but
others aren't so happy to see them go. These days, marketers
of some brands like Haagen-Dazs and BMW -- icons of an era of
self-indulgence and conspicuous consumption -- are scrambling
to cope with the new values of the 1990s.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Marketing experts are still debating the new psychology of
consumers, but a wholesome profile is being crafted. As baby
boomers have aged and had children of their own, family
values have replaced the quest for individual gratification.
In an uncertain economic climate, overt materialism has
become less fashionable: Nowadays, young professionals are
apt to choose the Gap over Gucci, even if money is no object.
And some boomers now fret over problems more global than
personal, including the deteriorating environment.</p>
<p>"In the 1980s, Ralph Lauren's print advertising worked
because it looked like photos of George Bush's extended
family," says John Lister, executive vice president at Lister
Butler Inc., a New York consulting firm. The ads showed Mr.
Lauren's clothes and household furnishings as part of a
sporty, affluent life style plenty of consumers coveted. "But
now we're entering an age of more reasonable aspirations,"
Mr. Lister says.</p>
<p>That leaves many marketers of yesterday's status symbols
desperately trying to distance themselves from the dated
yuppie image. Those companies now stress real product
attributes in their advertising, rather than trying to
conjure up a fantasy-laden life style. Marketers from Club
Med to Haagen-Dazs are pitching to families and older
individuals. Some other elite brands -- such as BMW and
Filofax -- are rolling out budget models.</p>
<p>"The products that have a value separate from their brand
image are the ones that will continue to flourish," says
Clive Chajet, chairman of Lippincott & Margulies Inc., a New
York image consultant. Here is a look at how seven brands of
the '80s are navigating the '90s.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>Haagen-Dazs</p>
<p>It was the preferred caloric indulgence of the Me
Generation. But with health concerns mounting and families
growing, the once-elite Haagen-Dazs brand is undergoing what
management calls a democratization program.</p>
<p>Although it seemed to have burst onto the scene in the
1980s, Haagen-Dazs has banged around refrigerator cases since
1961. Its popularity soared in the 1980s, however, and food
marketer Pillsbury snapped up the company in 1983. In turn,
Pillsbury was swallowed by Grand Metropolitan PLC last year.</p>
<p>By then, Haagen-Dazs's sales growth had cooled to a skimpy
3% or 4% a year. Dieting had replaced self-indulgence for
many of the brands' loyalists, but Haagen-Dazs was as
fattening as ever. In part to foster an aura of exclusivity,
Pillsbury had done little advertising to draw in new
consumers.</p>
<p>Under Grand Met, however, Haagen-Dazs will be pitched more
clearly to the masses, although the company swears it hasn't
tinkered with the original recipe. And prices won't be cut.
To broaden Haagen-Dazs's appeal to families, the company has
begun selling the ice cream in quart-sized packages. Early
next year, it will introduce a 96% fat-free frozen yogurt
under the Haagen-Dazs name. To get its message out, Grand Met
will spend $12 million on advertising in fiscal 1991, more
than four times 1989 levels.</p>
<p>Yet convincing consumers the brand is still worth a
premium price may not be so easy if its aristocratic image is
diluted. And the brand's track record with new products isn't
stellar. Consumers weren't impressed by Haagen-Dazs snack
bars, introduced about two years ago.</p>
<p>Ove Sorensen, president of Haagen-Dazs, shrugs off such
criticism. The company is already rethinking its ice cream
snacks and will introduce a new version next year. "There's
nothing inconsistent about selling the best ice cream in the
world and making it available to families, too," Mr. Sorensen
says. "At the end of the day, we're selling something that
only costs $2.59 a pint."</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>Filofax Organisers</p>
<p>Through much of the 1980s, Filofax leather-bound personal
organizers, costing $180 and up, were de rigueur for
hard-charging young professionals. These days, however, the
company is hoping to broaden its market by organizing the
less affluent.</p>
<p>Owners of these bulging fashion accessories, which came to
be called yuppie bibles, once rhapsodized about their creamy
leather covers and myriad inserts. But after a date yuppies
will never forget -- Oct. 19, 1987, the day of the
stock-market crash -- young climbers have been less
interested in date books priced so dearly. What's more,
Filofax now faces competition from scores of cheap imitators,
as well as new pocket electronic organizers from the likes of
Sharp Electronics Corp. Last year, the 69-year-old Filofax
PLC slipped into the red for the first time.</p>
<p>To keep U.S. sales growing, Filofax is rolling out two
"budget" models -- the $55 "Lincoln" and the $100 "Sherwood."</p>
<p>"We want to offer organizers to the masses," says John
Belvedere, vice president of sales and marketing for Filofax
Inc., the company's U.S. unit.</p>
<p>Mr. Belvedere contends the move doesn't conflict with
Filofax's elite image. The inexpensive models will simply
introduce a new generation to the brand, he says. But some
retailers, many of whom now make Filofax-like organizers of
their own, have turned up their noses at the $55 model. In
New York, for example, department stores snubbed the product
altogether, leaving it to be sold by two local office-supply
stores.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>BMW</p>
<p>BMW, the "Ultimate Driving Machine," became the ultimate
status symbol of the 1980s. But with the U.S. economy ailing
and competitors like Toyota Motor Co.'s Lexus and Nissan
Motor Co.'s Infiniti crowding into the luxury car market,
Bayerische Motoren Werke AG's U.S. sales have shifted into
reverse.</p>
<p>Last year, the company's U.S. unit sales were more than
30% below its 1986 peak. By November of this year, BMW had
sold 56,784 cars in the U.S., down 6% from the corresponding
period in 1989.</p>
<p>To revive sales, BMW has cut prices as much as 9% on some
of its existing models. And in a move that would chill the
blood of 1980s status seekers, it has even introduced two
"entry-level" models that sell for around $20,000. New ads
for BMW will tout the car's technical attributes and resale
value, rather than its place in a glamorous life style.</p>
<p>"We had to change," says Carl W. Flesher, BMW's vice
president for marketing in the U.S. "Consumers are shaky
about the economy, and it's important to reassure them."</p>
<p>Not that the company will sell out completely. Don't
expect to see green marketing for BMWs, for example. "But
what we can say, and will be saying," Mr. Flesher adds, "is
that the filtered air on the inside of a BMW is cleaner than
the air on the outside."</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>Corona Extra</p>
<p>Yuppies loved Corona Extra Mexican beer because it looked
like an import but tasted like a good old American brew.
Adding a sliver of lime -- something no self-respecting
Mexican would do to a bottled beer -- made it doubly exotic.</p>
<p>But just as the brand's popularity soared in the mid-'80s,
it plunged toward decade's end as yuppies moved on to the
next fad. Competition from domestic beer makers, in the form
of new products such as dry beers, further cut into sales.
The weakening U.S. economy hasn't helped, either. Last year,
Corona Extra sold 16 million cases of beer in the U.S.,
according to Impact, a beverage-industry publication. That is
a far cry from the 22.5 million cases sold in 1987, and sales
are likely to slip even further this year.</p>
<p>To bolster the brand, Corona introduced a light beer in
1989. In its first year on the market, it sold more than a
million cases, a record for any imported beer. And both
Corona Extra and the light version are now available in
12-packs, another gimmick to increase revenue.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, sales will probably never again reach the
lofty levels of the late '80s. Whether its decline will slow
remains to be seen. "This brand is not a fad," insists Ellis
M. Goodman, who imports Corona through Barton Beers Ltd. in
Chicago. "We're still the No. 2 imported beer, and that's a
position we intend to keep."</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>Coach</p>
<p>The Coach "Metropolitan" bag was an essential fashion
accessory of the bow-tied woman of the early 1980s.</p>
<p>But the 50-year-old Coach Leatherware brand, acquired by
Sara Lee Corp. in 1985, seems to be faring just fine in the
less ostentatious 1990s. Coach's annual sales have grown from
$20 million in 1985 to over $150 million in 1989. Despite the
dismal retailing environment, its sales are expected to jump
another 20% this year.</p>
<p>Once a maker of only items for women, Coach has branched
out into leather products for both men and women, including
wallets, briefcases and desk sets. The company has updated
its designs and added new colors to its line. Coach has also
broadened its distribution to include catalogs, and it now
operates 52 boutiques of its own. "We've made a conscious
effort to make our product more available to consumers," says
Lew Frankfort, president.</p>
<p>But Coach's popularity has also endured because it
resisted plastering its name all over its purses.
Nevertheless, the products, which range in price from $25 for
a key case to over $300 for a woman's briefcase, are easily
recognizable. So much so that when Coach sued several
retailers recently for stealing its designs, a federal court
in New York ruled in its favor.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>Club Med</p>
<p>Try as it might, Club Med can't seem to shake the dated
"swinging singles" image that clings to its name. The resort
organization, which is 73% owned by French tourism group Club
Mediterranee S.A., claims the majority of its guests are
married couples. Of the 17 villages under the North American
unit, only three still cater to hedonistic singles. Club Med
focuses on selling family vacations, and six facilities can
provide full-time day care.</p>
<p>"A huge chunk of our business is already families with
children," says Michael Kubin, the newly appointed president
of Club Med Sales Inc., the company's U.S. unit. "We're also
looking at attracting vacationers over the age of 50." The
company will also emphasize corporate sales and attracting
conventions.</p>
<p>But Mr. Kubin acknowledges that the organization is
wrestling with its image problem, and hasn't yet found a
solution. Club Med's current television ads, created by
Ammirati & Puris Inc., a New York ad agency, seem to portray
the organization as something for everyone. The commercials
show kids, families and even older couples doing their thing
in a beautiful tropical setting.</p>
<p>Image isn't Club Med's only problem. The company faces
competition from vacation packagers and other resorts that
try to duplicate Club Med's all-inclusive pricing formula.
And with the U.S. economy slumping, company officials say
European visitors account for the bulk of its guests. Club
Med's occupancy is hovering around 62%, about the same as in
recent years.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>Swatch</p>
<p>When Swatch introduced its colorful watches in the U.S.
eight years ago, it almost single-handedly created a market
for fashion timepieces. Nowadays, though, many adults view
the watches as frivolous.</p>
<p>Swatch, a unit of SMH (U.S.) Inc., is struggling to change
that perception. The Swiss company is rolling out new models
to attract grown-ups and has begun advertising its watches on
network television for the first time. Next year, Swatch vows
to boost U.S. ad spending by 25%.</p>
<p>To get sales moving, Swatch introduced a $45 scuba watch,
guaranteed to keep ticking at depths of 600 feet. Next
summer, the company will launch a chronograph watch that will
sell for about $70, or twice the price of a classic Swatch.
The company is also considering using well-known artists to
design watches in the future. "We're doing those things to go
after that more adult, and more masculine target," says Chris
Keigel, Swatch's U.S. vice president of sales.</p>
<p>A comeback is still a long way off: The U.S. market for
inexpensive watches is flat, and the competition is fierce.
Swatch has suffered from product shortages in the past, and
the introduction of its chronograph watch has already been
delayed. And though the company's U.S. sales inched up to
four million units this year, they are still far below the
company's 1986 peak of five million.</p>
