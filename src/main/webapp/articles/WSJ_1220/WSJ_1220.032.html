	<p class="article-leader">Linda S. Gottfredson's Dec. 6 editorial-page article,
"When Job-Testing `Fairness' Is Nothing but a Quota," is a
useful reminder of the extreme attempts made to justify
racial preferences. Ms. Gottfredson errs, however, in
implying that the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity
Commission (EEOC) endorses such divisive, condescending and
inequitable policies. We are well aware of "race-norming"
advocacy that both scholarly psychometric studies and
common-sense observations justifiably denounce.
   Unlike the police chief in "Casablanca" who professed to
be shocked to learn about gambling at Rick's, we do know that
policies promoting race and gender preferences have come
about in the 25 years that EEOC has enforced Title VII. In
the course of the search for justice, governmental policies
clearly have gone awry; de facto quotas exist now, and the
1990 Civil Rights Act would have touched off a quota
explosion, forever embedding them in our employment practices
and other spheres of life.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Ms. Gottfredson errs in maintaining that the EEOC has
"quietly filed suit against at least five Fortune 500
companies for not using disguised quotas for test results."
The EEOC has not filed suit and is now investigating certain
employment practices in these companies. We have, for some
time now, been reviewing our settlements and conciliations to
ensure that the relief provided is free of preferential
treatment. We wish to make clear that altering test scores to
favor a particular group is not a legal or "less
discriminatory alternative." Of course, this would be unfair
to everyone involved -- employees as well as employers. The
radical redefinition of fairness that Ms. Gottfredson
describes is in no way agency policy.</p>
<p>This commission stands for aggressive law enforcement that
protects individuals from illegal discrimination. The
vitality of civil-rights enforcement should not be measured
by the preferences given different groups.</p>
