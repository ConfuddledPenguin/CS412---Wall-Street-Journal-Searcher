	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- Savings and loans under government
management posted losses of $2.3 billion for the third
quarter, said the Resolution Trust Corp. That was a slight
expansion from the previous quarter.
   Losses for the 206 thrifts awaiting sale or liquidation by
the government included $1.5 billion in write-downs on assets
and losses on the sale of assets. Losses on assets are
expected to represent the biggest slice of the $200 billion
cost of the thrift-industry cleanup.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The 206 reporting thrifts held $90.7 billion in assets,
which have shrunk 27% since the thrifts were seized by the
government, the agency said.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the longer the thrifts remain in government
hands, the higher their operating costs, incurred by
taxpayers, pile up. Third-quarter results include $863
million in operating losses, which stop accruing when the
government disposes of those thrifts.</p>
<p>The losses of 247 government-controlled thrifts in the
second quarter were restated yesterday to $2 billion,
according to the agency. S&Ls that aren't under government
management recently reported losses of $631.4 million for the
third quarter.</p>
<p>Losses from government-controlled thrifts aren't likely to
abate soon. About 218 S&Ls are considered to be immediate
candidates for government takeover. Several hundred more S&Ls
could fail, if the economic slowdown is protracted,
regulators say.</p>
