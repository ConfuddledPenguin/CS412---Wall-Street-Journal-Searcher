	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- The dollar rose, defying the bearish drag of
lower U.S. interest rates. Helping the U.S. currency hold
firm was the reluctance to let go of dollars in a
war-threatened environment.
   Meanwhile, louder speculation about sinking rates in Japan
battered the yen across the board, even as expectations of
strict monetary policy in Germany kept the mark robust
against its European counterparts and the yen.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Late in New York, the dollar was quoted at 1.4785 marks,
just above 1.4762 marks late Tuesday in New York. The U.S.
currency was also changing hands at 134.05 yen, up from
132.62 yen in New York late Tuesday. Sterling was trading at
$1.9305, down from $1.9430 late Tuesday.</p>
<p>In midmorning trading in Tokyo Thursday, the dollar was
quoted at 134.20 yen, up from 133.27 yen late Wednesday.</p>
<p>Potentially setting the stage for a sharply lower dollar
was aggressive action by the U.S. Federal Reserve, which had
announced a cut in the discount rate to 6 1/2% from 7% late
Tuesday afternoon. The Fed followed this move with action in
the money markets yesterday, signaling a new federal funds
target rate of 7%, down from 7 1/4% previously. The discount
rate is the interest rate the Fed charges member banks for
loans; the federal funds rate is the rate banks charge one
another for overnight loans.</p>
<p>Federal funds had been trading at 7 1/16% when the Fed
entered the market, arranging $1.5 billion of customer
repurchase agreements. Analysts said this signaled a 1/4
percentage point reduction in the target rate; a round of
system repurchase agreements would have been interpreted as a
1/2 point relaxation.</p>
<p>While the quick loosening of credit seems surprisingly
aggressive for the Fed, which until now has taken the slow
and steady approach, traders noted, the dollar was able to
take the moves in stride.</p>
<p>After the initial decline late Tuesday, there was little
follow-through. Participants said that a 1/2 percentage point
cut in the discount rate had already been factored into
exchange rates. The lowering of the federal funds target rate
didn't budge currencies at all.</p>
<p>"People expected the discount rate cut. The only surprise
was {the timing}," said Sung Won Sohn, chief economist at
Norwest Corp. in Minneapolis.</p>
<p>The timing of the discount cut may have been aggressive,
said Marc Cohen, vice president at Fuji Bank in New York.
"But when you look at the {U.S.} economy . . . then you
think, maybe drastic times call for drastic measures," so
that softening of U.S. rates doesn't have to trigger a broad
dollar sell-off.</p>
<p>Participants said that under different market conditions,
the dollar might have suffered more. But, in thin markets,
"with many banks already square for the year end, it's a
recipe for doing little or nothing," said David Jaques,
senior corporate trader at Barclays Bank in New York.</p>
<p>Until the market has a better sense of which way the
Mideast situation will swing, it's imprudent to try
establishing any strategic long-term positions, Mr. Jaques
added.</p>
<p>Among the developments keeping the markets on edge about
the Persian Gulf crisis were disparate reports about the U.S.
capability in the Mideast. Sen. Daniel Inouye, (D., Hawaii)
indicated that a war with Iraq would last no more than five
days, while one of the U.S.'s top military deputies said U.S.
troops wouldn't be ready to mount an offensive by the Jan. 15
United Nations' deadline for Iraq's withdrawal from Kuwait.</p>
<p>On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for current
delivery jumped $9.50 to $386 an ounce. Estimated volume was
a moderate 3.5 million ounces.</p>
<p>In early trading in Hong Kong Thursday, gold was quoted at
$382.20 an ounce.</p>
