	<p class="article-leader">Desperate for financing to sell a unique baseball cleat he
designed, entrepreneur Fred Ihlenburg negotiated an agreement
with a New York venture-capital firm. On the way to lunch
after signing the deal, one of the brothers who ran the firm
told him half-jokingly: "You're a lousy negotiator. I never
would have signed this contract."
   "That's when I knew I was in the hands of the
Philistines," says Mr. Ihlenburg.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>It was one of the most jarring revelations in a string of
painful lessons over almost a decade. He learned that coming
up with a winning product often has little to do with
success: He suffered as much from tight-fisted banks and
corporate rivals as he did from his own inexperience.</p>
<p>Mr. Ihlenburg's baseball cleat was an undeniable hit.
Dozens of high school and college players, university
coaches, and several baseball stars, including the Cardinals'
Ozzie Smith, say his shoe grips better than most they've
worn.</p>
<p>But it took Mr. Ihlenburg's tiny firm nearly a decade to
come close to making a profit. In that time, he lost the
company in a desperate deal with the wrong lender. A foreign
manufacturer took it over and offered him a lowly job in
sales. He won back the company only to be snubbed by more
lenders. "In the years since this started, we've been on a
wild horse trying to find someone who could give us a
saddle," says the 48-year-old Mr. Ihlenburg.</p>
<p>When he first dug his heels into the cleat business, Mr.
Ihlenburg was selling women's nightgowns and lounge-wear
designed by his wife, Carol, for Why Not? Fashions, in Lake
Oswego, Ore.</p>
<p>In 1980, U.S. high schools moved to ban metal-spike cleats
that at the time were considered dangerous. Too often, spikes
punctured and gashed athletes and caused twisted knees and
ankles by lodging into the ground as a player's body turned.</p>
<p>While other manufacturers responded with cleats made with
rows of plastic spikes, Mr. Ihlenburg hit upon the idea of
putting two circular ridges of plastic in sections around the
soles of the shoes. The design, though hardly revolutionary,
allows a runner to dig into the ground, yet turn his foot
easily. A separate plastic protrusion in the center of the
sole allows a pivot action that one wearer describes as
"power steering of the foot."</p>
<p>In 1981, Mr. Ihlenburg took his idea to Rawlings Sporting
Goods Co. It granted him a conditional license to use the
brand name in testing the design, but not to sell it. High
school and college baseball teams loved the shoe. "I was
impressed with the stop-and-go bite we got. It was
incredible," says Gary Pullins, a baseball coach for Brigham
Young University.</p>
<p>In July 1983, Rawlings offered to buy the trademark, but
"the offer was so low," Mr. Ihlenburg says, "I won't even
dignify it by repeating it."</p>
<p>In February 1984 -- much too late to sell to retailers in
time for the season -- Mr. Ihlenburg decided to sell directly
to high school and college coaches over the phone. In two
months, his company, Ringor Corp. of Oregon, made $800,000 in
sales.</p>
<p>With demand climbing, Mr. Ihlenburg needed money to make
more shoes. But countless banks and brokerage houses refused
him credit. They also questioned his chances of success
against giants such as Nike Inc. and Adidas USA Inc.</p>
<p>In 1984, a friend introduced Mr. Ihlenburg to a small
venture-capital firm that agreed to lend him $200,000 and
make its "best efforts" to raise $800,000 more within months.
Mr. Ihlenburg turned over 20% of his company's stock as
payment and the rest as collateral. The terms prompted the
"lousy negotiator" comment.</p>
<p>At first, the description seemed apt. The venture-capital
firm couldn't come up with the additional $800,000 Mr.
Ihlenburg needed to expand, and he, in turn, lacked the cash
to repay the $200,000.</p>
<p>But along came a blessing in disguise. Mr. Ihlenburg was
also unable to pay back $500,000 to his shoe manufacturer,
the Liao family of Taiwan. He was forced to turn over the
trademark to them, which he had put up as collateral. Because
the trademark was his company's only valuable asset, he was
able to liquidate his debt to the New York venture
capitalists with stock that was now worthless collateral.</p>
<p>In 1985, the Liao family offered Mr. Ihlenburg a job as
sales manager. He refused, embarking instead on a plan to
sell 20,000 pairs of shoes that he still owned.</p>
<p>Then, in 1986, the Liao family sold the trademark back to
him for a bargain $50,000. It had met resistance from
customers loyal to Mr. Ihlenburg, and had trouble competing
for shelf space against Nike and other big companies. Mr.
Ihlenburg later applied for a patent for a better design,
which he received in September 1987.</p>
<p>New to the athletic footwear work, he also picked up on a
marketing truth: Endorsements by top athletes sell shoes. But
instead of paying fees, he sought to entice them with stock
in his company. He lobbied many baseball stars, including the
Los Angeles Dodgers' Fernando Valenzuela and Ozzie Smith.
Though they like the shoe, they wanted fees, not stock.</p>
<p>Meantime, Mr. Ihlenburg enlisted sports figures for other
tasks. Dodgers manager Tommy Lasorda accepts stock as payment
for promoting the shoes at coaches' clinics and exhibitions.
And Bart Starr, the legendary Green Bay Packers quarterback,
joined Ringor as a director.</p>
<p>In 1988, Ringor raised $100,000 through a merger with a
"shell," a small publicly traded company that has some
assets, but no operations. That didn't end its financial
problems, though. Last year, a New York merchant banker that
was to provide a major credit line filed for protection from
creditors under Chapter 7 of the federal Bankruptcy Code. "My
heart fell right out of my chest," says Mr. Ihlenburg.</p>
<p>Today, the outlook is brighter than it was nine years ago
when he got started. Sales have begun to pick up, mainly
because Mr. Ihlenburg has focused on direct sales to coaches
and schools. He can't meet demand; the company turned away
$2.5 million in orders in 1989, he says.</p>
<p>About a month ago, a group of Asian investors, including
Mr. Ihlenburg's manufacturer, offered him virtually unlimited
credit for the next six years on 120-day terms. With hardly
any name recognition, a narrow market niche and crush of
corporate competitors, Mr. Ihlenburg forges ahead. "It can
only get easier," he says.</p>
