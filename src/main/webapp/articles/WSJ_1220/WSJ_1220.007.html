	<p class="article-leader">RAHWAY, N.J. -- Citing strong demand, Merck & Co., a
pharmaceutical company, said it plans to spend $29 million to
expand its Kelco division's biogum production facilities in
San Diego and in Okmulgee, Okla. Biogums, produced through
fermentation, are used as stabilizing, thickening and gelling
agents in food and industrial products.
   Kelco, based in San Diego, produces algin and biogums.
Merck said recent U.S. Food and Drug Administration approval
of certain biogums has spurred enough industry interest in
the products that additional capacity is needed.</p>
