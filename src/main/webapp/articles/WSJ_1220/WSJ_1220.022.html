	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Stone & Webster Inc. said it is cutting its
quarterly dividend in half to 15 cents a share because it is
retaining workers in anticipation of increasing demand.
   The dividend is payable Feb. 15, 1991, to stockholders of
record Jan. 2, 1991.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The provider of engineering, construction and consulting
services said while it expects a growing demand from
electrical power utilities in the 1990s, it will not realize
the benefits until after this year. It also said that it has
begun a number of new projects that require large cash
expenditures for payroll and start-up costs.</p>
<p>Separately, the company said its engineering unit was
awarded a contract from oil company Saudi Aramco and its U.S.
affiliate to support its pipeline management program. Terms
of the agreement weren't disclosed.</p>
<p>Stone & Webster said it will provide engineering,
construction and project management services as well as
materials procurement support. The services will be provided
over a number of years in both the U.S. and in Saudi Arabia.</p>
<p>In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange, Stone
& Webster shares closed unchanged at $31.125.</p>
