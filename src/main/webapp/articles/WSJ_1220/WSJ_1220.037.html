	<p class="article-leader">DALLAS -- MorningStar Foods Inc. said it began an offer to
buy half of its debentures outstanding at $480 for each
$1,000 face amount as part of a plan to restructure about
$243 million in debt.
   MorningStar, a dairy concern, said it needs to restructure
$93.2 million in bank debt and $150 million in 13% senior
subordinated debentures due 2000 to avoid a bankruptcy-law
filing. The company said it doesn't believe it will be able
to repay a $22.2 million working capital loan when it comes
due March 31 or $71 million in loans that come due in June.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The company was formed in 1988 to purchase the dairy
business of Southland Corp. and then purchased Avoset Corp.
from Kraft Inc. However, increases in raw milk prices hurt
its operations and liquidity last year, when it had a $39.5
million loss. This year, it sold its Texas and California
regional dairies and used the $54.2 million in proceeds to
reduce debt. It had a net loss of $15.7 million for the first
nine months on sales of $563.1 million.</p>
<p>As part of its restructuring, the company said, Long-Term
Credit Bank of Japan and NMB Postbank Groep N.V. have agreed
to provide a $45 million working capital loan and as much as
$95 million to refinance debt and purchase as much as $75
million face amount of debentures.</p>
<p>In addition, the company has agreed to sell new preferred
stock for $11.5 million to an unidentified investor group.
After the transaction, current holders of its common will own
5% of MorningStar.</p>
<p>Before the offer, MorningStar's bonds were trading at
about $350 for each $1,000 face amount. The company and its
financial adviser, Donaldson Lufkin Jenrette Securities
Corp., appear to be betting that the premium involved in the
$480 price -- and the risk of further price declines if
holders don't tender -- will be enough to win over
bondholders. The exchange offer currently is scheduled to
expire Jan. 16.</p>
