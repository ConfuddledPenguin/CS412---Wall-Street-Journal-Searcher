	<p class="article-leader">BIC Corp., Milford, Conn., said second-quarter earnings
dropped slightly as substantial sales and earnings decreases
in its lighter-manufacturing segment offset increases in
writing and shaving instruments.
   Earnings for the second-quarter were $7.6 million, or 62
cents a share, down from $7.7 million, or 63 cents a share,
in the year-earlier period. Sales fell 4% to $91.6 million
from $95.5 million. Net income includes an extraordinary gain
of $498,000, or four cents a share, attributable to a Mexican
tax-loss carry-forward.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Bruno Bich, president of BIC, attributed the earnings
decreases in the lighter segment to a reduction in the number
of smokers in the U.S. and to an increase in the number of
inexpensive lighters from China, Thailand and Korea. "Sales
and earnings gains from writing instruments and shavers, plus
reduced losses in perfume, were not sufficient to offset"
these losses, he said.</p>
<p>Earnings for the first half fell 3.9% to $13.6 million, or
$1.12 a share, from $14.17 million, or $1.17 a share, for the
year-earlier period. Sales fell 3% to $170.9 million from
$175.9 million.</p>
