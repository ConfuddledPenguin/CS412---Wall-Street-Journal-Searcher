   Make Fewer Trips</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>ONE RAREFIED business perk is becoming more rare: paid
travel expenses for an executive's spouse.</p>
<p>After rising for most of the 1980s, the percentage of
companies that cover a spouse's travel has slipped for the
past two years, according to Hewitt Associates, a benefits
consulting firm. Last year, 47% of major U.S. employers
provided the perk, down from a peak of 53% in 1987. The
survey indicates that only about 1% of the work force gets
the benefit -- mostly elite executives earning at least
$100,000 annually.</p>
<p>"The outrageous days are gone," says Webb Bassick, a
Hewitt partner and executive compensation specialist. "There
were an awful lot of corporate jets flying to New York for a
trip to Bloomingdale's. You don't see that happening nearly
as much." He recalls the wife of one company executive who
flew on the corporate jet to Paris to run in a marathon.</p>
<p>Increased public scrutiny is one reason for the
turnaround. Also, companies are being more careful to adhere
to tax laws that don't allow tax deductions for non-business
spouse trips.</p>
<p>A growing number of companies now pay for trips only if a
spouse's or companion's presence benefits the company, a
survey by consultants Runzheimer International shows. "It's
usually only the big boys who get to take their wives along,
for the cocktail parties," says Brad Burris, a Runzheimer
executive vice president.</p>
<p>Getting Squared Away On</p>
<p>Nonsmoking Sections</p>
<p>SOME FOREIGN airlines take an unusual approach to creating
nonsmoking sections: They seat smokers on one side of the
cabin and nonsmokers right across the aisle. But that appears
to be changing as the effects of the anti-smoking crusade
ripple out to overseas carriers.</p>
<p>Many foreign carriers haven't yet banned smoking, as U.S.
airlines have done on most domestic flights. They are,
however, starting to copy the way U.S. airlines traditionally
separated their passengers, by seating smokers in the back
rows. Lineas Aereas Paraguayas switched to that system after
realizing that smoke fumes were ruining air filters
throughout its planes rather than in just one section,
increasing costs. LOT Polish Airlines switched to a
front-back system last year on flights between Los Angeles
and Montreal after getting passenger complaints.</p>
<p>Nonsmoking advocates, flush with victory in North America,
say side-by-side sections are on their hit list. "We're going
to make it much harder for these airlines to get away with
it," says David Sweanor, staff legal counsel at Non-Smokers'
Rights Association, a Canadian group.</p>
<p>Fliers tell of side-by-side divisions on carriers in
Eastern Europe, South America, Asia and Africa, including
Brazil's Varig Brazilian Airlines, Malev Hungarian Airlines
and Air Tanzania. Sometimes, the smoking side changes from
flight to flight. Either way, nonsmokers aren't thrilled.</p>
<p>"It's completely useless," says Stanton Glantz, a
passive-smoking expert at the University of California, San
Francisco. "If somebody sitting across the aisle from you is
smoking, he or she might as well be sitting on your lap."</p>
<p>Airlines Face Barrage</p>
<p>Of Lawsuits on Fares</p>
<p>ANTITRUST PROBES of the nation's airlines are attracting
the legal sharks.</p>
<p>At least eight law firms have filed class-action suits
recently, charging big airlines with price fixing. Another
five to nine law firms are said to be considering filing
suits soon.</p>
<p>The suits follow confirmation that the Justice Department
is investigating whether airlines are violating antitrust
laws. Among other things, federal sleuths are looking into
whether carriers set prices using an electronic fare
exchange, Airline Tariff Publishing Co. The department has
requested information about the airlines' relationship with
the industry's fare clearinghouse. The airlines and the fare
exchange, named as a defendant in the suits, deny any
wrongdoing.</p>
<p>Listed as plaintiffs in most of the suits are all
customers who have bought tickets since Jan. 1, 1988. That's
also the date from which the Justice Department seeks
information from airlines for one of its inquiries.</p>
<p>Among other things, the suits charge that carriers signal
and discipline each other through the fare exchange. One
result, the suits claim, is higher fares.</p>
<p>"This is pushing forward the question of what kind of
cases make for a conspiracy," says Michael Basch, a lawyer at
Fine, Kaplan & Black, Philadelphia, which this week filed a
suit in federal district court in Pittsburgh. "There are
rarely cases involving millions of people."</p>
<p>Odds and Ends</p>
<p>WHEN UNITED Airlines Flight 79 was delayed July 16 leaving
New York's La Guardia Airport, some passengers grumbled that
they wanted to return to the gate. Flight attendants usually
nix such requests. This time, though, they took a vote of
passengers. Only nine of 120 passengers wanted to return, a
flight attendant told one passenger, but the minority got
their wish. She claimed the Federal Aviation Administration
requires that even if one passenger wants to return, the crew
must abide. Nonsense, says an FAA spokesman. A United
spokesman admits the attendant was probably winging it. . . .
What will guests steal next? The Hotel Inter-Continental in
Miami leaves notes in leather-bound folders that hold hotel
stationery: "Please do not remove. . . . If you wish to
purchase a new folder, please contact concierge." A hotel
spokeswoman says the warning has cut folder thefts in half,
to about 50 a year.</p>
