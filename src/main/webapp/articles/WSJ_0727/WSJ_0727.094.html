	<p class="article-leader">The Amalgamated Transit Union has asked the general
counsel of the National Labor Relations Board to seek a court
injunction forcing Greyhound Lines Inc. to end the union and
the troubled bus company. The ATU already has an unfair labor
practices case pending against the company which, if
successful, could force Greyhound to reinstate 6,300 striking
ATU members and give them back pay totaling an estimated $3
million a month or more.
   But in a letter this week to NLRB General Counsel Jerry
Hunter, union attorney Martin J. Burns said a resolution of
the case could take years, and by that time Greyhound's
deteriorated financial situation could make a decision in the
union's favor worthless. Meanwhile, "striking employees'
resources are now depleted and their health care and homes
are at risk," Mr. Burns wrote.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>An NLRB spokesman said Mr. Hunter was reviewing the
union's request for immediate reinstatement but wouldn't
comment further.</p>
<p>Mr. Hunter has already obtained an injunction barring the
union from the kind of violence that marked the early months
of the strike.</p>
<p>In May, he also authorized an NLRB regional office in
Milwaukee to issue the unfair labor practices complaint
against the company. That complaint, stemming from
Greyhound's decision to unilaterally assert its last contract
offer, is scheduled to be argued before a federal
administrative law judge in September. "We're ready for
trial," said Greyhound spokesman George Gravley. "We expect
to win."</p>
<p>The unfair labor practices suit and the related request
for a court injunction have given the union some leverage in
its efforts to wrest control of Greyhound away from</p>
<p>ATU members walked off the job at Greyhound on March 2.
Crippled by the subsequent violence, last month Greyhound
joined five other units of its parent, Dallas-based GLI
Holding Co., in filing for protection from creditors under
Chapter 11 of the federal Bankruptcy Code. (Under Chapter 11,
a company continues to operate under court protection while
it devises a plan to repay creditors.)</p>
<p>The ATU has used the prospect of its huge back pay claim
to gain a seat on the unsecured creditors committee in
Greyhound's Chapter 11 case, where it has been seeking
support for its call to immediately reinstate union drivers.
In recent weeks, union leaders and advisors are said to have
held several meetings with other creditors in an effort to
garner backing for a possible union takeover bid. ATU General
Counsel Earle Putnam said the union hasn't made such a plan
final or obtained the necessary financing. "We're working to
see if there is somebody willing to put their money where
their mouth is," he said.</p>
