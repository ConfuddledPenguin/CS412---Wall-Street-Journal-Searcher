	<p class="article-leader">INDIANAPOLIS -- Wholesale Club Inc. said it expects
second-quarter earnings to fall to between seven cents and
nine cents a share compared with 15 cents a year earlier.
   The discount-store said for several years it has gradually
lowered its prices and margins. In the second quarter, this
process was accelerated, bringing margins down to those of
other large companies in the industry. Wholesale Club said
the move is designed to increase its share of market.</p>

year's three cents.</p>
