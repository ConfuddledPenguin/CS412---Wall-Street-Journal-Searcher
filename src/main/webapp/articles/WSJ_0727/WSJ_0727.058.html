	<p class="article-leader">DALLAS -- Just seven months after the end of their
contentious personal bankruptcy cases, oilmen Nelson Bunker
Hunt and William Herbert Hunt are bickering with creditors
over their share of proceeds from the liquidation of their
estates.
   The wrangling has been particularly heated in the case of
Nelson Bunker Hunt, who is arguing with creditors over the
value of certain mineral rights in a dispute that potentially
involves tens of millions of dollars. Meanwhile, both
brothers are quarreling with creditors over their share of
the proceeds from recent auctions of their collections of
rare coins and antiquities.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The disputes amount to a financial rearguard action by the
Hunts to preserve what remains of a fortune once estimated at
$6 billion. Battered by their disastrous speculation in the
1979-80 silver market and the subsequent fall of oil prices,
the brothers filed for protection from creditors under
Chapter 11 of the federal Bankruptcy Code in 1988. The Hunts
concluded their cases last December after agreeing to
liquidate most of their personal assets to pay off creditors.</p>
<p>But in Nelson Bunker Hunt's case, the mineral rights
dispute has either stalled or vastly complicated the sale of
more than $70 million of real estate, according to R. Carter
Pate, a principal of Charlotte, N.C.-based Finley Group and
liquidating trustee for the Nelson Bunker Hunt estate.</p>
<p>Under a reorganization plan negotiated with creditors last
year, Mr. Hunt was permitted to keep a 50% interest in
mineral rights to non-producing properties. But creditors and
Mr. Hunt now disagree over which properties are included
under that provision and how much such mineral rights are
worth.</p>
<p>"We're so far apart now we couldn't agree on lunch," Mr.
Pate said of recent settlement talks involving himself, Mr.
Hunt's attorneys and a creditors group led by the Internal
Revenue Service, the largest creditor in both cases.</p>
<p>Mr. Pate, who has asked U.S. Bankruptcy Court Judge Harold
Abramson to rule on the matter, claimed Mr. Hunt has
construed that clause to include mineral rights on everything
from a Hawaii condominium to some Florida beachfront property
and is using it to effectively block the sale of such
properties until he is paid unspecified amounts for the
mineral rights. Mr. Hunt's Kentucky horse ranch was sold
recently for $3 million, but Mr. Pate said that sale was only
concluded after Mr. Pate agreed to put all the proceeds in
escrow pending a resolution of the dispute.</p>
<p>Attorney Russell Munsch denied that his client was
asserting mineral rights to condominiums and other properties
without minerals and said creditors are trying to deny Mr.
Hunt the 50% stake in mineral rights that they agreed to in
the reorganziation plan signed by both parties last December.
"They're saying we didn't mean to give you that much even
though we signed the plan," said Mr. Munsch.</p>
<p>Stephen McCartin, attorney for William Herbert Hunt, said
the argument is part of an overall effort by creditors to
"attack every provision of the plan that provides benefit to
the debtors."</p>
<p>Meanwhile, both brothers are at odds with creditors over
how much the Hunts should be paid for their efforts to
publicize -- via media interviews and receptions -- the
recent auctions of their collections of rare Greek and Roman
coins, Byzantine bronzes and other antiquities. Those
auctions, conducted by Sotheby's Holdings Inc. last month in
New York, raised an estimated $22 million.</p>
<p>Under their reorganization plans, the Hunt brothers are
entitled to 60% of the proceeds beyond an unspecified
"benchmark" price for their efforts to enhance the value of
the collections. Under a benchmark formula being proposed by
the IRS, William Herbert Hunt would receive about $34,000 and
Nelson Bunker Hunt, who owned most of the auctioned goods,
about $295,000.</p>
<p>Mr. McCartin contends his client should get about
$700,000. Using a similar formula, Nelson Bunker Hunt would
get about $4.3 million, attorneys involved in the case said.</p>
<p>Judge Abramson has also been asked to rule in that
dispute.</p>
