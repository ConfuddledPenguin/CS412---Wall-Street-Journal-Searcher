	<p class="article-leader">Student Loan Marketing Association has proposed taking
over the portfolio of a troubled student-loan guarantor, a
move that would greatly expand its influence in the education
financing field.
   The Washington-based company, also known as Sallie Mae,
has become one of the central players in the Bush
administration's efforts to rescue Higher Education
Assistance Foundation, a distressed guarantor of $9.3 billion
in student loans.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Through its purchases of student loans and its financing
of other purchasers and lenders, Sallie Mae already dominates
the field, as owner or source of funds for more than half of
the $51 billion in loans outstanding. To take over HEAF's
portfolio, Sallie Mae is proposing to gain the designation of
guarantor in the student-loan program, according to people
familiar with the proposal.</p>
<p>Although Sallie Mae's proposal could be attractive to the
government because of the company's financial resources and
profitability, the plan would face stiff opposition. Banks
and many of the 55 other guarantors of loans have
traditionally opposed a widening of Sallie Mae's powers,
which are spelled out in a special charter from the federal
government.</p>
<p>A spokesman for Sallie Mae declined to comment on the
company's discussions with the government, but he said,
"Under our charter, we can be a guarantor at the behest of
the Department of Education."</p>
<p>Jean Frohlicher, executive director of the National
Council of Higher Education Loan Programs, said, "Lenders and
guarantee agencies would be extremely upset at the idea that
the government-sponsored secondary market (Sallie Mae) would
seek to become a guarantor in this program."</p>
<p>"If you let Sallie Mae do this, they will own the
student-loan industry," added Roy Nicholson, chairman of
United Student Aid Funds in Indianapolis, another loan
guarantor.</p>
<p>Mr. Nicholson says United Student Aid, with about $11
billion in guarantees outstanding, also has submitted a
proposal to the government for taking over HEAF's portfolio.
He said the government told him Sallie Mae has submitted a
competitive proposal.</p>
<p>In addition, Mr. Nicholson and other loan-industry
officials said, a coalition of smaller guarantee agencies is
preparing a proposal for taking over some or all of HEAF's
portfolio and splitting it among themselves.</p>
<p>Sallie Mae and United Student Aid each want special
treatment or government sweeteners to protect them against
the defaults that are the cause of HEAF's problems.</p>
<p>Banks lend students money under the program and receive
100% principal reimbursements from guarantee agencies in the
frequent instances of defaults. But because HEAF guaranteed
too many defaulting loans, it doesn't get the full
reimbursement from the federal government that guarantee
agencies usually receive, causing big losses. An immediate
potential shortfall at HEAF of $60 million and fears of
further defaults in its $9.3 billion portfolio have prompted
the government to explore rescue plans.</p>
<p>If it gets the go-ahead, Sallie Mae could resolve its own
potential liabilities in the HEAF mess. Sallie Mae has lent
HEAF $800 million that it says is not at risk even if HEAF
fails because the collateral is sound. But investors have
been skeptical and have pounded down Sallie Mae's stock since
HEAF's problems came to light.</p>
<p>People familiar with Sallie Mae's proposal said it seeks
certain changes in the timing and formulas for repayments in
the program if its proposal is accepted. One possible
government sweetener, these people said, would be to allow
Sallie Mae to keep a larger share of recoveries from students
after defaults are paid off. Guarantors are now allowed to
keep 30% of any recoveries -- usually gained through
collection agencies -- and must return 70% to the government.
HEAF already has $2 billion in defaulted paper for such
recoveries and will surely generate more in the next year.</p>
<p>Mr. Nicholson said United Student Aid has committed itself
to taking $5 billion to $7 billion of guarantees on HEAF's
"best" paper at first and the rest over time, eventually
assuming it all by Sept. 30, 1992. He said United Student Aid
is not asking for the 1% administrative fee from the
government that agencies usually receive for assuming
original guarantees.</p>
<p>Until Sept. 30, 1992, Mr. Nicholson said, HEAF would make
claims to the government on the lower-quality loans, many of
which were made to low-income students at trade schools. The
government's cost on this part of the portfolio would be the
same as if HEAF were allowed to stay in business, he said.</p>
