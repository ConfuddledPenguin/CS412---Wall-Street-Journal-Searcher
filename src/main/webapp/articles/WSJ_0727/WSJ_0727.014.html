	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- A small dermatology company is seeking to
capture part of the market for Retin-A, a prescription acne
drug that has become popular as a wrinkle treatment.
   Medicis Pharmaceutical Corp. said it obtained an exclusive
license from Syosset Laboratories Inc. to market, when
approved, a generic prescription form of the drug now
marketed exclusively by Johnson & Johnson's Ortho
Pharmaceutical Corp.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Closely held Syosset, a Syosset, N.Y., maker of
dermatological products for physicians, has applied to the
Food and Drug Administration for permission to market the
generic drug, a synthetic form of Vitamin A known as
tretinoin. But other concerns are likely to be making similar
applications, although the FDA declined to discuss how many
such petitions it may have received.</p>
<p>Medicis estimates that Retin-A has about $150 million in
annual sales and that the total market for anti-acne products
is about $300 million. A spokesman for Ortho in New
Brunswick, N.J., said Retin-A is "the most widely prescribed"
acne treatment.</p>
<p>Medicis isn't currently marketing any products. It plans
to start marketing a line of skin moisturizers and
therapeutic shampoos to dermatologists next month. The
anti-acne products will give Medicis "a strong presence" in
the acne product market, said Jonah Shacknai, Medicis
chairman and chief executive officer. He said that if the
Retin-A formulation is approved, it would give the company
"an explosive opportunity" to compete in that market.</p>
<p>Ortho's patent on the use of Retin-A as an acne treatment
expired in the spring, so until recently it had exclusive
marketing rights to sell it. Ortho "anticipated some generic
competition" when the Retin-A anti-acne treatment went off
patent, the Ortho spokesman said.</p>
<p>Kurt Kruger, an analyst with Hambrecht & Quist, said
Johnson & Johnson's "franchise and marketing muscle" would be
able to "overwhelm" any small company coming in with a
generic Retin-A product. He said Retin-A, although still "a
great prospect" for the company, had diminished in terms of
importance, noting that J&J, with annual sales of $11
billion, recently posted an 18% rise in second-quarter
earnings.</p>
<p>But Hemant Shah, who has a health-care investment research
firm called HKS & Co. in Warren, N.J., said the entry of
generic forms of Retin-A into the market will be meaningful
because Retin-A is a "fairly expensive" product. Retin-A now
retails for between $25 and $45 a tube, he said, depending on
the strength of the formulation. Mr. Shah estimates that
Johnson & Johnson could lose as much as a 30% share of the
market in the first year after a generic version is
introduced.</p>
<p>Mr. Shah says that, all told, there may be as many as five
companies doing research on generic forms of Retin-A. In
addition to Syosset, he said he knows of one other company
that has applied for FDA approval. He expects FDA approval on
an abbreviated new drug application on generic Retin-A to
come sometime in the middle of next year.</p>
<p>The Ortho spokesman said the firm has an application
before the FDA to market a form of Retin-A to treat
sun-damaged skin. Ortho has the patent to use the product as
a skin-damage treatment, he said. According to Ortho studies,
the product has been shown to be effective in helping reverse
"manifestations of sun damage," such as hyperpigmentation,
mottled skin and wrinkles, the spokesman said.</p>
<p>Although "some see it as a beauty product, we see it as a
medical product," he said.</p>
<p>Sales of Retin-A rose sharply after published reports that
the cream reduced the fine wrinkling of the skin caused by
sun damage. Although a study last year at the University of
Arizona found Retin-A does smooth wrinkles, the FDA in 1988
issued a statement condemning the indiscriminate use of
Retin-A to treat wrinkles.</p>
