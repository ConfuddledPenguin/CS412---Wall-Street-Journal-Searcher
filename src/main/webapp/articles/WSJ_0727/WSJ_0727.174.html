	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Federal Aviation Administration
adopted a rule designed to ground pilots who violate
drunken-driving laws or are convicted of traffic offenses
involving drugs.
   "This kind of behavior indicates an attitude that we
believe is not compatible with safe flying," said FAA
Administrator James B. Busey.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Individuals applying for an FAA-required medical
certificate must consent to the release of information from
the National Driver Register to enable the FAA to obtain and
review motor vehicle offense information.</p>
<p>Pilots also would be required to provide written
notification to the FAA on each alcohol or drug-related
driving conviction or administrative action within 60 days
after it occurred.</p>
<p>The FAA could deny an application for a pilot certificate
or take action to suspend or revoke an existing certificate
if the pilot received two or more alcohol or drug-related
convictions or administrative actions within three years
after the effective date of the rule.</p>
<p>The Air Line Pilots Association called the rule a "witch
hunt" and said, "The existence of alcohol-related driving
convictions does not correlate to flying a commercial
airliner while intoxicated. A federal district court upheld
this principle when it ruled that there was no basis for
drawing a similar connection for commercial truck drivers."</p>
<p>The union said it would help any pilot who "falls victim
to the FAA's oppressive and invasive ruling."</p>
