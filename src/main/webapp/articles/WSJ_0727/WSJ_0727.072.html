	<p class="article-leader">Early gains in over-the-counter stocks evaporated after
computer software leader Microsoft cautioned analysts that
increased spending next year will crimp its profit margins.
   Microsoft skidded 2 3/4 to 68 3/4, after first rising to a
high of 74. Other technology shares followed suit, pressuring
the broader OTC market.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The Nasdaq Composite Index eased 0.02 to 445.45, a 0.1%
decline, after gaining more than 1.5 points before the
Microsoft outlook was reported. Volume continued to slip as
136.1 million shares changed hands, down from 141.6 million
Wednesday. Advancing shares again outpaced decliners, 1,054
to 923; the gap between stocks trading to new lows and new
highs narrowed, 94 to 58.</p>
<p>"Anytime you have a company the size of Microsoft getting
knocked like that, it affects the general tone of the
market," said Nelson Gold, senior vice president of OTC
trading at Interstate-Johnson Lane Corp., Atlanta. Kidder
Peabody senior OTC trader Peter Coolidge agreed, adding that
the reaction to the Microsoft news underscores the
nervousness of the market.</p>
<p>Some investors shifted from technology shares into
biotechnology stocks, noted James Tarantino, head of OTC
trading at Hambrecht & Quist, San Francisco. Among the day's
strong biotech issues, Amgen rose 1 to 91 1/2, Centocor
jumped 2 1/4 to 43 and Xoma added 3/4 to 25 3/4. Mr.
Tarantino said that institutions have been this week's
busiest investors, adding that "futures programs seem to have
driven retail {investors} out of the market."</p>
<p>Regional stocks have been in favor among institutions
trading through Morgan Keegan & Co. in Memphis, according to
Hedi Reynolds, managing director of OTC trading there. She
said that in the last two days she's seen more orders to buy
stocks than sell among larger clients.</p>
<p>Surprising strength in insurance stocks helped shore up
the OTC market. The Nasdaq Insurance Index rose nearly 0.8%,
or 3.93 to 498.21</p>
<p>There seemed to be no apparent fundamental reason for the
advance of the insurance index, according to Mr. Coolidge and
Donaldson Lufkin & Jenrette insurance analyst David Seifer.
Mr. Seifer noted that second quarter insurance underwriting
losses seem to have increased while the industry's investment
income growth slowed.</p>
<p>Traders said that insurance stocks seemed to gain strength
after Ohio Casualty reported net income for the second
quarter of $1.14 a share, down from $1.68 a year earlier.
However, analysts said that figure wasn't surprising and they
were mystified by the advance. Ohio Casualty rose 1 3/4 to
45; St. Paul Cos. added 3/4 to 60; Safeco rose 3/4 to 35 3/8,
and 20th Century Industries gained 1 1/8 to 25.</p>
<p>Among the day's most-active stocks, United Banks of
Colorado rose 1 3/8 to 21 1/2 after the Denver commercial
bank signed a definitive merger agreement with Norwest. Under
the agreement, United Banks stockholders will receive 1.22
Norwest shares for each of their United Banks shares.</p>
<p>Other active stocks didn't fare so well.</p>
<p>Wholesale Club plunged 5 5/8 to 18 1/2 on more than 1.1
million shares after the Indianapolis operator of membership
merchandise warehouses said it expects to report net income
for the second quarter ending in August will range between
seven and nine cents a share, down from 15 cents a year
earlier.</p>
<p>Intellicall gained 1 to 13 5/8 after the Carrollton,
Texas, maker and marketer of pay telephones reported second
quarter net income rose to 27 cents a share from 17 cents a
year earlier.</p>
<p>Michael Foods climbed 1 1/4 to 19 7/8 after the
Minneapolis food processor reported second quarter net income
rose to 43 cents a share from 20 cents a year earlier.</p>
<p>Vikonics rebounded 3/4 to 5 3/8. In the first three days
of the week, shares of the Secaucus, N.J., security systems
concern lost one-third of their market value. Dow Jones
Professional Investor Report said Vikonics lost a bid on
Monday to provide a security system for the U.S. Treasury
Department. John J. Strong, Vikonics vice president of
finance and administration, and President John L. Kaufman
told DJPIR that contrary to market rumors, the loss of the
contract doesn't jeopardize the company's chance of winning
other awards.</p>
