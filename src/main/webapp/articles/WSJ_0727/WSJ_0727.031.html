	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- The Bush administration and congressional
Republicans tentatively agreed to propose raising taxes on
alcoholic beverages and limiting deductions for state and
local taxes as part of their opening bid at the budget
summit, according to people familiar with the plan.
   But almost immediately, support for the budget proposal
began to unravel over the question of trimming cost-of-living
adjustments for government retirement benefits other than
Social Security. Sen. Pete Domenici of New Mexico and Rep.
Newt Gingrich of Georgia urged other GOP negotiators to
delete this item from the budget President Bush proposed in
January.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Congressional Democrats, meanwhile, concentrated on
questions of scheduling rather than substance, according to
Sen. James Sasser (D., Tenn.), chairman of the Budget
Committee. He said Democrats were "not very far" toward
finishing work on a deficit-reduction package of their own.
"We haven't been able to air all of our views internally," he
said.</p>
<p>"We're sorry to hear they {the Democrats} are having
difficulty," said White House Chief of Staff John Sununu said
as he arrived for a meeting with House Republicans. "We're
ready anytime."</p>
<p>But minutes later, House Republican Leader Robert Michel
of Illinois said, "I agreed to no plan."</p>
<p>Negotiators have all but abandoned hope of reaching an
agreement before the scheduled start of the congressional
recess next Friday. A new timetable for the talks could
emerge from a scheduled meeting between President Bush and
top congressional leaders today. Summit negotiators expect to
spend part of their monthlong break working toward a
deficit-reduction compromise.</p>
<p>Some say there's still a possibility President Bush will
ask Congress to delay the start of the recess. Rep. Gingrich
said it would be "an extraordinary mistake" for Congress to
leave at this time. Nevertheless, Democrats are now talking
about trying to get a deficit-reduction package enacted by
early October, which would require reaching an agreement at
the summit early in September.</p>
<p>The Republicans' $50 billion deficit-reduction proposal
for fiscal 1991, which starts Oct. 1, was discussed by GOP
budget negotiators late Wednesday and may be revised before
it is offered to Democrats. "We're a highly flexible
operation," White House Budget Director Richard Darman told
reporters.</p>
<p>Those familiar with the draft plan say it calls for about
$25 billion in higher revenue, including about $6 billion in
user fees. Although many of the proposals are taken from the
president's January budget, Sen. Bob Packwood of Oregon,
senior Republican on the Senate Finance Committee, told
reporters the package would raise taxes on alcoholic
beverages. The Bush budget doesn't contain such a proposal,
and White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater wouldn't comment.</p>
<p>Others familiar with the plan confirmed that it envisions
raising federal taxes on beer and wine, which are currently
taxed less per ounce of alcohol than hard liquor. Although
the discussion among the Republicans referred only to beer
and wine, the revenue estimates mentioned by Mr. Darman --
raising about $7.2 billion in the first year -- implied
raising taxes on hard liquor, too, people familiar with the
discussion said.</p>
<p>The details weren't put in writing, and Republicans
differed on whether hard liquor was included. To raise $7.2
billion, however, the tax on a six-pack of beer would have to
go up to about 81 cents from 16 cents, the tax on a bottle of
wine to about 70 cents from three cents and on a bottle of
liquor to about $2.54 from $1.98. Democrats have criticized
such proposals as regressive, arguing instead that any tax
increase be structured to hit upper-income taxpayers harder
than others.</p>
<p>The tentative Republican plan also would limit the
deduction for state and local taxes to $10,000 a year,
sources familiar with the package said. Currently there isn't
a limit on the deduction. Similar proposals in the past have
been successfully resisted by members of Congress from states
with relatively high taxes, and opponents already are holding
news conferences to denounce it.</p>
<p>"Read our lips: This will not pass," said Sen. Daniel
Moynihan (D., N.Y.), flanked by a bipartisan contingent of
New York congressmen. New York Gov. Mario Cuomo and New York
City Major David Dinkins appeared to protest the plan at a
news conference called by a coalition of unions and local
government associations.</p>
<p>Within the Republican delegation to the budget talks, a
more controversial issue is whether to include the Bush
administration's plan to freeze cost-of-living adjustments,
or COLAs, for federal and military retirees for one year, and
to set them at one percentage point below the inflation rate
in subsequent years. Some Republicans are uneasy about
endorsing such proposals, even though they don't involve
Social Security. They fear Democrats will be able to turn
them into a political weapon anyway.</p>
<p>Rep. Gingrich, the House Republican Whip, circulated a
one-sentence memo to the other GOP negotiators yesterday that
said: "I cannot support any offer in the budget summit that
freezes COLAs and any such offer which is made will not have
my support." Sen. Domenici, senior Republican on the Budget
Committee, also argued against the item, which would save
about $1.5 billion next year.</p>
<p>The draft Republican plan repeats the president's proposed
cut in capital gains taxes and adds new proposals to trim
entitlement programs about $16 billion, including new
proposals to reduce farm subsidies, people familiar with the
package said.</p>
<p>Separately, a proposal is circulating among House Ways and
Means Committee members that would raise as much as $3
billion a year from stock and mutual life insurance
companies. The industry was expecting some tax increase but
was hoping for a significantly smaller one.</p>
