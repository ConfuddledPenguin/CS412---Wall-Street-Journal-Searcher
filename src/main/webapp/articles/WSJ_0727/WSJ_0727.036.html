	<p class="article-leader">CINCINNATI -- Penn Central Corp. said it will buy back up
to 6 million shares of common stock at $26 a share.
   The company said it will mail an offer to shareholders as
soon as possible, and that the offer isn't contingent upon
any minumum number of shares being tendered.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The company reserved the right to buy back up to an
additional 1.5 million shares if the offer is oversubscribed.</p>
<p>In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday,
Penn Central closed at $25 a share, up $1.625.</p>
<p>Penn Central, a manufacturing, defense services, insurance
and energy concern, has 62.7 million shares outstanding.</p>
<p>Carl H. Lindner, chairman and chief executive officer,
said the stock "is currently undervalued," especially in
relation to the June 30 book value of $28.50 a share.</p>
<p>American Financial Corp., Cincinnati, a financial holding
company that Mr. Lindner also heads, said it won't tender any
of its Penn Central shares. American Financial owns 34.3% of
the stock, and its ownership will rise to 37.9% if 6 million
shares are bought back by Penn Central.</p>
<p>In addition, directors exempted Penn Central from all
provisions of the new Pennsylvania anti-takeover law.</p>
