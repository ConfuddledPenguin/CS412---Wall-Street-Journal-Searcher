	<p class="article-leader">SANTIAGO -- That populism in Chile still exists is
understandable. But that the textile sector should become the
stage for populism's latest appearance is downright ironic.
Textiles were among those industries that, according to
free-market economist Joaquin Lavin, most clearly reflected
the modernizing effects of the Pinochet dictatorship's
liberal economic model. First published in 1987, Mr. Lavin's
book "La Revolucion Silenciosa" is an unconnected list of
showy examples presented as irrefutable proof that Chile was
finally joining the ranks of modernity.
   Unfortunately, events currently taking place in the
textile sector reveal Mr. Lavin overlooked an important
factor. To paraphrase another famous book title, modernity is
also a state of mind.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Denouncing foreign "dumping," management leaders of
Chile's textile sector already have asked the government for
protection. They argue the alternative is bankruptcy. But it
has been the reaction of Chile's most important labor
organization, Unitary Worker's Central (CUT), that has raised
the most alarming memories of a populist past. It has called
on the state to intervene in the textile sector to protect
the thousands of jobs that would be lost in an eventual
collapse.</p>
<p>The textile sector's problems might be a preamble to the
greatest economic challenge facing Chile's new democracy: to
conciliate continued economic growth with an economic
consciousness still lured by the siren song of populism.
President Patricio Aylwin's government has given every sign
that it understands the way to maintain this economic
performance is to conserve the main features of Gen. Augusto
Pincohet's free-market model, a view that has found broad
consensus among Chile's political elites. The problem is that
in a democracy what the elites think might not be enough.
CUT's opinions suggest a fundamental disagreement between the
working-class people it represents and the market-oriented
policies that now rule the Chilean economy.</p>
<p>There is no question that under Gen. Pinochet's economic
model, Chile took strides toward becoming a modern nation. In
1974, a customer going to an ALMAC (one of Chile's oldest
supermarket chains) had 5,500 different products to choose
from; today ALMAC offers 16,000 items. In 1970, two in 100
Chileans had a car; by 1985, five in 100 did. Walking into
Almacenes Paris or Falabella in downtown Santiago is like
walking into any major department store in the U.S. or
Europe: Paloma Picasso window displays, Arrow shirts, Swiss
army knives and Sony diskettes. On the streets of any Chilean
city, the youth wear jeans, ski parkas and sneakers.</p>
<p>Faced with the choice, those who have tasted the benefits
of this open, world-oriented economy would rather never go
back to the statist model that dominated society until 1973.
But there are others who are not yet better off than before.</p>
<p>Different sources indicate the poor account for somewhere
between a third and a half of Chile's population. An American
journalist friend who recently came with me to the
"poblaciones", as the suburban slums are known, described
them simply as "surreal." That cold night the dirt streets
were barely visible through the dense cloud of dust
reflecting this year's drought. Added on to the
state-supplied cement cabins were shanties made of cardboard
and plastic to accommodate the homeless's relatives, about a
million nationwide.</p>
<p>When well-off people drive through these areas on their
way to the beach or to pick somebody up at the airport, few
imagine that the fetid organic smell that permeates the area
is an everyday reality for the hundreds of thousands of
"pobladores" who live there. The poblaciones are a world unto
their own. Even though the people there wear jeans and
sneakers, most spend their days trying to figure out how to
secure their next meal.</p>
<p>These people don't earn enough to join one of the private
social-security or health-care companies, and what is left
for them instead are the ailing remnants of the old state-run
system. Three-day waits are common for those who want to set
up medical appointments, and patients often are asked to
bring their own medicine before they are admitted to
hospitals. City services aren't worse; they just aren't.</p>
<p>Contrary to the widespread perception that economic
dependency on the state had been retreating during the
dictatorship years, for this other half it was the opposite.
A recent survey indicates that whereas in 1970, 37% of the
extremely poor relied on the government for all income, by
1988 the new policy of subsidy "focalization" and the drop in
real wages had caused the state to account for 57% of the
very poor's total income. Unwillingly, the dictatorship
created the conditions for populism to survive in the
mind-set of the poor; they have become a parallel and
anachronistic reality whose political expectations stand in
direct contrast to the Chileans who have joined the world
market.</p>
<p>Pictures of Marxist President Salvador Allende are common
on the walls of many houses at the poblaciones. A robust
woman with a sad expression on her face told me, "We were
better off when he was our president. Poor man, he will
always be with us." Allende's memory is revered and his
protecting father-image lives on as testament to a mentality
that to this day sees state initiatives as the main hope for
improvement.</p>
<p>The preference for a strong state is not limited to the
extremely poor, however. This view is still present in part
of the old middle class.</p>
<p>Chileans say Santiago, population four million, has more
taxicabs than New York City. Middle-aged ex-accountants,
ex-bureaucrats and ex-administrators of state companies are
only a few among those one currently finds driving hacks. Now
they drive their taxicabs in a deregulated market, charging a
fare governed almost exclusively by what the market will
bear. "I wish the state would set the fares," says Alredo
Medina, a cab driver who used to be a municipal supervisor.
"This way, no one knows what to charge, and one has to go
around competing with other taxis." To him, this dynamic
society is puzzling and obscure. Consciously or not, looking
to the state for guidance and protection remains a cultural
trait for much of the middle class he represents.</p>
<p>Many of those who voted for President Aylwin perceived him
as a continuation of the system that existed before the
military coup of 1973, and this might be the essence of a
long-range problem. But Mr. Aylwin's policies are far from
those of the long-dead Allende's, and many will be
disappointed once it becomes clear that his government plans
to restrict the growth of the state. So far the new
government has been on its honeymoon, but events like those
in the textile industry indicate that the honeymoon may be
coming to an end.</p>
<p>Measures of the sort proposed by CUT have found little
echo among the established political forces. But the real
danger lies in the future. Chile is now a democracy, and as
long as a populist view of the state remains alive within a
significant number of the voters, the system will remain
vulnerable to its influence.</p>
