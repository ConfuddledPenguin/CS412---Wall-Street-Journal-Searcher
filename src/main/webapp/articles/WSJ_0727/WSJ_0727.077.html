	<p class="article-leader">Boeing Co.'s second-quarter net income nearly doubled to
$387 million, or $1.12 a share, on the continued strength of
the Seattle-based company's commercial aircraft business.
   A year earlier, the aerospace concern earned $195 million,
or 57 cents a share, after a 3-for-2 stock split paid last
month.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Sales rose 37% to $6.97 billion from $5.07 billion.</p>
<p>Boeing said commercial aircraft sales volume and operating
margins for the latest quarter were partly offset by a higher
effective federal tax rate.</p>
<p>Despite the overall increases in results, Boeing's
chairman and chief executive officer, Frank Shrontz, painted
a gloomy picture for the company's defense business. He
warned, as he has previously, that "technical, cost and
schedule problems" on certain defense contracts will result
in "a significant 1990 operating loss" for the company's
defense and space business. Last year, Boeing's military
transport subsidiary had a $559 million loss, while the
missiles and space segment earned $85 million.</p>
<p>"The market environment for Department of Defense business
continues to be influenced by world events and strong
pressures to reduce federal expenditures," Boeing said. "A
number of programs involving the company are under DOD, NASA
{National Aeronautics and Space Administration} and
congressional funding reviews."</p>
<p>Still, robust commercial business made Boeing the clear
winner among U.S. aerospace companies for the second quarter.
Boeing received orders for 128 jetliners and five commuter
planes valued at a total of $11.5 billion in the latest
period. A year earlier, the company had a record 502 jetliner
and eight commuter aircraft orders valued at $25 billion.</p>
<p>The company reported its earnings after the close of the
market yesterday. In New York Stock Exchange composite
trading, Boeing shares finished at $59.125, up 87.5 cents.</p>
<p>Boeing said the "key challenges" for its commercial
aircraft business during the second half will be maintaining
schedule and cost controls at the current high level of
production, and obtaining firm orders from top airline
customers for the proposed 777 wide-body, twin-engine jet.</p>
<p>Boeing's total backlog as of June 30 was $84.3 billion, of
which $78.1 billion was for commercial customers. At the end
of 1989, its backlog was $80.6 billion, with $74 billion from
commercial business.</p>
<p>In the first half, net rose 5.4% to $689 million, or $1.99
a share, from $654 million, or $1.89 a share, adjusted for
the split, a year earlier, when net income included $298
million, or 86 cents a share, related to an accounting change
for taxes. Sales rose 48% to $13.4 billion from $9.07
billion.</p>
