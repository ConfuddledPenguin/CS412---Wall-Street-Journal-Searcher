	<p class="article-leader">Call it "The Case of the Inquisitive Juror," or, "Why It's
Generally Unwise to Dial a Drug Cartel During Jury
Deliberations."
   Attorneys in U.S. District Court in Tampa, Fla., are
shaking their heads over an incident Tuesday that came within
an eyelash of aborting a major criminal trial that has
consumed seven months of court time and thousands of hours of
testimony.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The case involves five former employees of Bank of Credit
& Commerce International, the Luxembourg bank that, earlier
this year, pleaded guilty to running the biggest single-bank
drug-money laundering operation in U.S. history. The five
employees, as well as a Colombia businessman, are accused of
conspiring to launder $14 million in proceeds from the sale
of cocaine.</p>
<p>The trial began in January. After hearing two weeks of
closing arguments, the jury began deliberations last week.</p>
<p>Late Tuesday, however, the U.S. attorney was informed that
one of the jurors had apparently decided to do some of his
own investigating and had placed at least one -- and possibly
several -- telephone calls to people outside the courthouse.
The calls, according to court officials, were made to
individuals allegedly connected to the Medellin drug cartel
in Colombia. The calls were first disclosed publicly in the
Tampa Tribune yesterday.</p>
<p>News of the juror's actions prompted a flurry of meetings
among prosecutors, defense attorneys and U.S. District Judge
William T. Hodges, who held a hearing on the incident
yesterday morning. The judge decided not to declare a
mistrial. Instead, the juror was dismissed, and the 11
remaining jurors were ordered to continue their
deliberations.</p>
<p>Neither the U.S. attorney's office nor defense attorneys
would comment on the incident. But legal experts said the
juror's activities were all but unprecedented.</p>
<p>While it's not unprecedented for jurors to take it upon
themselves to, say, inspect the scene of an accident in a
lawsuit, said Richard Lempert, a professor of law and
sociology at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor, ". . .
I've never heard of anything quite like this."</p>
<p>Testifying before Judge Hodges yesterday, the juror said
he had obtained the telephone numbers from an address book
that prosecutors had introduced as evidence during the trial.
The book had been seized from the briefcase of one of the
defendants, Rudolf Ambrecht, when he was arrested in Miami in
October 1988.</p>
<p>The juror said he had made the calls out of "simple
curiosity," seeking to discover whether the people at the
other end of the line did, in fact, know Mr. Ambrecht. "No
real bad intent was meant," the juror said.</p>
<p>He acknowledged, however, that on Tuesday, he mentioned to
at least five other jurors that he had made the phone calls.</p>
<p>One of the jurors, a woman, told her husband about the
incident when she returned home Tuesday evening. The husband
contacted the Federal Bureau of Investigation, who
immediately relayed the information to the office of U.S.
Attorney Robert W. Genzman. Officials there called Judge
Hodges.</p>
<p>"If there's a guilty verdict, you can be sure the defense
will make {the juror's actions} grounds for an appeal," said
Shari Diamond, senior research fellow at the American Bar
Foundation in Chicago. "But then it will depend on what {he}
told the other jurors."</p>
<p>John Gay, court deputy to Judge Hodges, noted that the
judge had given specific instructions to the jury to decide
the case based on the evidence that was presented in court
and to avoid any outside information. The jury wasn't
sequestered.</p>
<p>Few jurors disregard judges' instructions about sticking
to the evidence presented in the courtroom, said Daniel
Margolis, chairman of an American Bar Association committee
on juries, and an attorney with the Washington firm of
Patton, Boggs & Blow.</p>
<p>"I think most jurors are fairly compliant," Mr. Margolis
said. "A lot of people are like sheep and don't do any more
than they're told." He added, however, that there are
probably instances of such behavior that remain unknown
simply because a juror never tells anyone of his private
investigations.</p>
<p>Jury misconduct of this magnitude is a rare event, said
Thomas Munsterman, director of the Center for Jury Studies at
the National Center for State Courts. "Usually it's much more
innocent," he said, such as disregarding a judge's
instructions not to drive by the scene of a crime.</p>
<p>In general, jurors try to keep a distance from people
associated with the defendants in a criminal case -- if only
out of a concern for their own safety. "They don't want to
get involved," Mr. Munsterman said.</p>
<p>That, he said, makes the dismissed juror's actions all the
more remarkable, particularly in light of the Medellin
cartel's reputation. "This guy's kind of brave, when you
think about it, given that these might have been nasty
people, right?"</p>
