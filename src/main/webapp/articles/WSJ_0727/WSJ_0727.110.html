	<p class="article-leader">CHICAGO -- Continental Bank Corp. moved another step
toward full private ownership as the Federal Deposit
Insurance Corp. approved a shelf registration for the sale of
its 26% stake in Continental.
   The move follows an apparently unsuccessful effort by the
FDIC's investment bankers at Smith Barney, Harris Upham & Co.
to sell the stake to an institutional investor or another
banking concern -- including First Chicago Corp.,
Continental's rival here.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>A banking official said that Smith Barney recently
approached First Chicago's chairman and chief executive
officer, Barry F. Sullivan, and tried to interest him in the
stock, but that he declined. Mr. Sullivan, who over the years
has expressed a keen interest in combining the city's two
biggest banks, wouldn't comment, nor would Smith Barney.</p>
<p>Continental announced its intention to make the shelf
registration on the sixth anniversary of its $4.5 billion
federal bailout. A spokeswoman said the actual filing will be
made by the middle of next week, covering all of the FDIC's
common and preferred, which together equal about 14 million
of Continental's 53.7 million common shares outstanding.</p>
<p>The sale of the stock, however, could well have to wait
months or longer because bank stocks have been depressed.
Continental stock closed yesterday at $13.50 a share, about
$1.50 lower than an offer the FDIC refused early last month.</p>
<p>The offer was made by Continental, some of its top
officers and some outside investors.</p>
<p>Last fall, the FDIC refused to let Continental sell the
shares in a public offering when the stock was trading at
around $20.</p>
<p>Since those two events, Continental's chairman and chief
executive, Thomas C. Theobald, has been critical of the FDIC.
After his offer was turned down last month, he said he was
"dumbfounded" and called the FDIC's continued ownership of
Continental shares "a wholly unwarranted role for a
regulator."</p>
<p>Yesterday, in a statement, he was more conciliatory,
however, calling the approval of the filing "a milestone with
both financial and psychological significance for us."</p>
<p>Some customers still limit their dealings with Continental
because of the FDIC's ownership, and the Federal Reserve
Board has indicated it won't look kindly on acquisitions by
Continental as long as it is a partial ward of the
government.</p>
<p>The FDIC wouldn't say at what price it will sell, and any
public offering of the shares or sale to an investor group is
still up to the agency.</p>
<p>At yesterday's price, the 26% stake had an indicated value
of about $185 million. The agency previously sold to the
public, to a Continental employee stock ownership plan and to
Continental itself common and preferred stock for a combined
$1.06 billion.</p>
