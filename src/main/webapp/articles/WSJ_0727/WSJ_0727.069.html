	<p class="article-leader">Robert Bork predicted David Souter a year ago. In his book
about his own Supreme Court ordeal, Judge Bork wrote:
   "A president who wants to avoid a battle like mine, and
most presidents would prefer to, is likely to nominate men
and women who have not written much, and certainly nothing
that could be regarded as controversial by left-leaning
senators and groups."</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Now George Bush has named a stealth candidate, and
Washington is . . . nonplused. How could he] Liberals, scared
to death by the departure of William Brennan, are demanding
that the Senate ask tough, detailed questions. Even some
conservatives, wary as ever of betrayal by George Bush, want
specific answers. After the Bork trial, the Senate will get
nothing of the sort -- which is what it deserves.</p>
<p>The reticent Yankee's nomination sent everyone scrambling
for Lexis news retrieval.One delicious anecdote, reported by
Dale Russakoff of the Washington Post, captures the sense of
panic. At People for the American Way, the group that paid
Gregory Peck to smear Judge Bork, activists awaited Mr.
Bush's announcement around the TV set holding files on Texas
appeals-court judge Edith Jones. But Ms. Jones was the
runner-up. When Mr. Souter appeared next to George Bush,
everyone shouted, "That's a man]" and rushed off to locate
the Souter file.</p>
<p>Mostly, that file is empty. Everyone says nice things
about him, even New Hampshire Democrats. Liberals and
conservatives take comfort, respectively, from the two
Bigfoot GOP New Hampshirites, malleable Sen. Warren Rudman
and the granite former Gov. John Sununu, who take credit for
discovering him.</p>
<p>Even a clue found on abortion can be read both ways. While
a Superior court judge, Mr. Souter wrote a letter saying
judges should take no position on the issue of parental
consent for abortion. The letter served a pro-choice end by
helping to defeat a parental-consent bill. But the letter's
reasoning -- that judges shouldn't engage in "acts of
unfettered personal choice" -- sounds like the sort that
would disapprove Roe v. Wade. The artful dodger himself,
George Bush, couldn't have written a better script.</p>
<p>Senators can expect more forthright ambiguity at his
confirmation hearing. Judge Souter will throw off more fog
than San Francisco Bay. On the Constitution's "right to
privacy" (the bedrock of Roe), he will sound like Justice
Anthony Kennedy, who at his confirmation said the
Constitution protected privacy, but how and why would depend
on the case. That didn't stop Mr. Kennedy from voting to
overturn Roe in Webster v. Missouri.</p>
<p>On the burden of precedent, Judge Souter will declare his
deep respect for Supreme Court decisions, but how deep no one
will know. Liberals will climb the walls, but what can they
do? Without hot-button quotes -- to be turned into Gregory
Peck sound bites -- their only target is a legal theory,
George Bush's preference for "strict constructionists." Mr.
Bush could reply that Democrats are trying to "politicize"
the Court, something Americans don't like.</p>
<p>Perhaps the only bad confirmation omen is that the White
House has picked Kenneth Duberstein to shepherd Mr. Souter
through the Senate. Mr. Duberstein's credits include the Bork
confirmation strategy of turning the other cheek. If there is
an attack brewing, Mr. Duberstein will be the last to know.</p>
<p>For their part, conservatives fear another John Paul
Stevens, but in judicial politics this is not the 1970s. As
Mr. Bork wrote last year, "in the larger war for control of
the law, there are only two sides." The increasingly florid
liberal activism of recent years has unified the opposition.
Among Republicans on the Senate Judiciary Committee, even
Wyoming moderate Alan Simpson is in the Bork camp. So is
George Bush.</p>
<p>Mr. Souter's Sununu or Rudman pedigree matters less than
his clearance by talent-spotters at the Reagan Justice
Department. He passed muster with the same people who
approved Justices Antonin Scalia and Anthony Kennedy. Some of
these people are in key places in the Bush Administration.
None of President Bush's other finalists -- Ms. Jones, and
Clarence Thomas and Laurence Silberman of the D.C. circuit --
should console liberals.</p>
<p>A mistake is always possible, but it's the exception. The
rule is Justice Kennedy. Sources who've interviewed Mr.
Souter agree that their only real doubt is how aggressively
he'll seek to overturn liberal precedents. He has a
"libertarian streak" that might make him tolerant of
flag-burning but also distrustful of economic regulation. No
one even dreams he'll go rummaging through the Constitution
looking for "emanations and penumbras."</p>
<p>After the Brennan era, a newcomer will also be joining a
different Supreme Court. The liberals will no longer have the
four solid votes required to hear a case, so the Court's
docket will change. Liberal enthusiasms will wane. Justice
Scalia now becomes the Court's intellectual heavyweight, much
as Justice Brennan was when Justice Stevens joined.</p>
<p>As Justice Harry Blackmun admitted recently, and none too
happily, the Supreme Court has begun an era of conservative
jurisprudence that could last 40 years. Liberals ache to stop
this, but with the Bork massacre they created the new stealth
standard that will frustrate them. Judge Bork predicted that
too.</p>
