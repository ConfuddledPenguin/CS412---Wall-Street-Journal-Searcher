	<p class="article-leader">WESTBORO, Mass. -- Data General Corp. reported a loss of
$21.4 million, or 71 cents a share, in its third quarter
ended June 30. The loss was far bigger than analysts had
expected, though it shrank slightly from the year-ago
deficit.
   Revenue declined 1.2% to $302.4 million from $306.1
million a year earlier.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>A year earlier, the computer maker reported a loss of
$23.1 million, or 79 cents a share, after a $6.3 million gain
from the sale of a facility in Sunnyvale, Calif.</p>
<p>Data General reversed an earlier prediction that it might
break even or turn in a profit in the fourth quarter. "Given
the softer demand we are seeing in the continued sluggish
market for proprietary computer systems within the computer
industry, breaking even is not likely in the fourth quarter,"
Data General said. The company declined to give an estimate
for the fourth quarter.</p>
<p>In the year-ago fourth quarter, Data General had a loss of
$84.1 million, or $2.86 a share, after an $80 million
restructuring charge. Revenue was $357.1 million.</p>
<p>Data General cited the sluggish proprietary computer
market and competitive pricing pressures industrywide as
reasons for the disappointing third-quarter results.</p>
<p>"While we remain cautious with respect to the near term,
we are optimistic that demand will improve during subsequent
quarters," said Ronald L. Skates, Data General's president
and chief executive.</p>
<p>Analysts said the results were in line with "just about
every other computer company." However, earnings were still
"significantly lower than expected," said John Adams, an
analyst at Adams, Harkness & Hill Inc. in Boston.</p>
<p>Recently, the company met with analysts to discuss its
outlook. However, "no indication at that time" was given of
the extent of the company's expected loss, said Jay P.
Stevens, an analyst with Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. "I had a
25 cent (a share) loss estimate," said Mr. Stevens.</p>
<p>Analysts blamed the company's woes on slower-than-expected
sales overseas and intense product discounting in the U.S.</p>
<p>In the first nine months, Data General had a loss of $50.5
million, or $1.69 a share, on revenue of $907.9 million. In
the year-ago period, the company had a loss of $35.7 million,
or $1.22 a share, on revenue of $957.3 million.</p>
