	<p class="article-leader">More than 65 of Pennsylvania's publicly traded
corporations -- about 21% -- have rejected all or part of the
state's new anti-takeover law, many of them citing concerns
that the law's restrictions were unfair to shareholders.
   Despite proponents' claims that the law would protect
companies from unwanted bidders, a majority of the state's
Fortune 500 firms chose not to be covered by at least part of
the statute, including Westinghouse Electric Corp., H.J.
Heinz Co., Sun Co. and P.H. Glatfelter Co. In addition, a
number of the state's large financial companies, such as PNC
Financial Corp., Core States Financial Corp., and Mellon Bank
Corp., exempted themselves.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Nevertheless, the measure's supporters said they were
pleased with the number of firms that chose to keep the
offered protection, including Scott Paper Co., PPG Industries
Inc. and Aluminum Co. of America. "If you get 80% of the
people agreeing on anything, most people would consider it a
landslide," said Steven Wallman, the Washington lawyer who
drafted the law.</p>
<p>The controversial measure, which was passed overwhelmingly
by the legislature last April, gave companies until yesterday
to opt out of any of the law's three main provisions: changes
in fiduciary standards to allow directors to place other
interests above shareholders' interests; restrictions on the
voting rights of certain large shareholders; and forced
"disgorgement" of the profits of short-term holders who sell
after an attempt to control the company.</p>
<p>Many companies that opted out said that concerns about
violating the rights of shareholders were a primary
motivation for their decisions. Their concerns were echoed in
letters to directors from several large pension funds,
including the California Public Employees' Retirement System,
the largest public pension fund in the country.</p>
<p>"I wouldn't vote for a director who said, `When it comes
time to represent you, I'm going to ignore you,'" said M.A.
Johnson II, executive vice president and chief financial
officer of Glatfelter, which opted out of all provisions.
Besides, Mr. Johnson added, directors can always reject a
hostile offer they believe isn't in the company's best
interests. "It's the `just say no' defense."</p>
<p>Indeed, several companies that declined the law's
protections felt other defenses were more useful or
desirable. Hunt Manufacturing Co., for example, opted out of
all provisions but adopted a "poison pill" measure. And
financial companies in particular seemed satisfied with
regulatory deterrents to hostile takeovers. "We didn't need
the protection," said a spokesman for Core States, which
opted out of the disgorgement and voting-rights provisions.</p>
<p>But one casualty of the widespread exemptions may be the
business-labor alliance that lobbied the bill through the
Pennsylvania Legislature. Organized labor threw its weight
behind the bill in exchange for severance-pay and contract
guarantees associated with the voting-rights section -- only
to watch several companies renege on early pledges of
support.</p>
<p>The most prominent example is Consolidated Rail Corp.,
which along with Armstrong World Industries Inc. ardently
supported the bill to ward off takeover threats. Last week,
Conrail's board voted to exempt the company from the
disgorgement and voting-rights provisions, knocking out the
labor protections at the same time.</p>
<p>"Conrail executives were scared . . . and were one of the
reasons for the passage of that bill," said Bill George,
president of the state AFL-CIO, which represents many
railroad employees. "Apparently they have elected to make
greed the priority. And maybe they should be taken over by
raiders."</p>
<p>A Conrail spokesman said the company never supported the
bill in its entirety. "Conrail's board decided to apply that
portion that was to the greatest benefit to the corporation,"
he said.</p>
<p>Even the chairman of the state business chamber, Richard
M. Ross Jr., recommended that his bank holding company, First
Eastern Corp., opt out of two provisions because it already
had regulatory protections. "Some corporations needed the
law, Armstrong particularly," said Mr. Ross, First Eastern's
chairman and chief executive officer. "But why put the belt
on if you've got a good pair of suspenders?"</p>
<p>However, labor groups warned that rejecting the law raises
questions in the mind of legislators about the good faith of
the state's business community. "They've got a credibility
problem with the General Assembly," Mr. George said.</p>
<p>More ominously, Pennsylvania corporations may soon have a
problem with labor: Unions are supporting a bill that would
submit executive severance contracts, known as "golden
parachutes," to a shareholder vote.</p>
