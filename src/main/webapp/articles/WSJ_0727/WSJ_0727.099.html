	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- The House voted to reprimand Rep. Barney
Frank after rejecting a Republican-backed motion calling for
a stiffer censure penalty for the Massachusetts liberal on
charges related to his past relationship with a male
prostitute.
   The final 408-18 roll call upheld the bipartisan
recommendations last week of the House Ethics Committee, but
the issue first split the chamber emotionally and reflected
more partisanship than in any ethics case in the past decade.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The censure motion, which failed 287-141, was opposed by
all but 12 Democrats, while Republicans lined up almost 3 to
1 in favor of the tougher penalty. "It was the homosexual
issue," said Rep. Charles Wilson, a conservative Texas
Democrat, "and in my opinion a Republican effort to say
Democrats are more supportive of alternative lifestyles."</p>
<p>As the fall elections approach, the debate underscored the
politics of ethics issues this year, and both parties are
competing for the high ground in meeting promises of
campaign-finance revision. After weeks on the defensive,
House Democrats are increasingly confident of offering a plan
to cut contributions by political action committees and
wealthy individuals, and provide public matching funds of as
much as $100,000 for candidates who accept spending limits.</p>
<p>Negotiations will continue today, but major elements
include a provision that PACs can account for no more than
40% of a candidate's contributions, compared with a 50% cap
previously discussed. The maximum individual donation, now
$1,000, would be cut in half. To encourage small
contributors, the measure would include a tax credit for the
first $50 donation by an individual. And though critics say
PACs will soon adjust to the new rules, one option calls for
a $55,000 limit on how much an individual lawmaker can take
from those groups, such as business and pro-Israel PACs, that
now draw a greater proportion of their funds from large
individual donors.</p>
<p>The long investigation of Mr. Frank, touched off by press
reports last year, focused on his relationship with Steven
Gobie from 1985 to 1987, when the congressman paid for sex
with Mr. Gobie and subsequently hired him as a household
employee and driver. Mr. Frank, an acknowledged homosexual,
had used his position to fix parking tickets for the
prostitute and prepared a 1986 memo supportive of reduced
probation for Mr. Gobie, a convicted felon.</p>
<p>The committee concluded that Mr. Frank "knew or should
have known" that the memo might be communicated to law
enforcement officials, and the panel argued that the
misleading statements in the document "could be perceived as
an attempt to use political influence to affect the outcome
of Mr. Gobie's probation."</p>
<p>"That the memorandum apparently had no such effect does
not detract from the inappropriateness of communicating known
misleading statements," the panel said.</p>
<p>Within the GOP leadership, the drive to impose censure
reflected the pressure of Minority Whip Newt Gingrich, who
mocked the notion of the lesser penalty allows Mr. Frank to
keep his subcommittee chairmanship on the House Judiciary
Committee. "People are looking for a guidepost," the Georgia
conservative said. But Democrats argued that the GOP sought
only a social issue for itself at a time when the party could
be forced to vote for taxes before the November campaign.</p>
<p>More broadly, the Ethics Committee had an institutional
stake in seeing its recommendations upheld. And after
handling politically sensitive investigations of former
Speaker James Wright as well as Mr. Gingrich himself, the
committee leadership saw yesterday's vote as a test of its
own strength.</p>
<p>"The case boils down to who do you trust," committee
Chairman Julian Dixon (D., Calif.) said bluntly. And perhaps
the strongest defense came from a third-term Republican from
Iowa. "We don't enshrine traditional family values by damning
individuals whose lifestyles are different than our own,"
Rep. Fred Grandy said. "We are here to prosecute, not to
persecute."</p>
