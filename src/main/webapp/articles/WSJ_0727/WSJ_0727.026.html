	<p class="article-leader">PARIS -- Economics Minister Pierre Beregovoy said
yesterday that France will repay virtually all of its
outstanding external debt by the end of this week through
prepayments equivalent to about $400 million.
   Mr. Beregovoy told a meeting of journalists that the
payments, to be made July 27, will cover the last $350
million of a $4 billion loan contracted by France in 1982 to
shore up France's official reserves of foreign currency.
France will also pay off 40 million European Currency Units
($50.9 million) of a 4 billion-ECU loan taken out in 1983 for
the same purpose.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The minister said the two payments would leave 30 million
ECUs of external debt outstanding. This amount is part of a
fixed-maturity borrowing that comes due in 1993. Terms of
this borrowing won't allow France to make prepayments until
July 1, 1991, and this will be done, Mr. Beregovoy said.</p>
<p>Mr. Beregovoy said the move was made possible by the
strength of the franc, the high level of French official
reserves and the strong performance of its economy.</p>
<p>The debt reduction effort will make France one of Europe's
least indebted states.</p>
