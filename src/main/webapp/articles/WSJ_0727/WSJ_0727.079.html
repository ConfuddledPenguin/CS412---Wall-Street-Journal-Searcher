	<p class="article-leader">Compaq Computer Corp., riding a crest of European sales,
posted a 24% gain in profit for its second quarter.
   That isn't the kind of torrid growth Compaq investors are
accustomed to, but analysts drew comfort from the Houston
company's 42% gross profit margin in the period. "The margins
were impressive," said James Poyner, an analyst with William
K. Woodruff & Co., a Dallas-based institutional brokerage
firm. "Revenues were not."</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Compaq said it earned $104 million, or $1.18 a share,
compared with $84 million, or 98 cents a share, a year
earlier. Pershare figures are fully diluted. A one-time
investment gain added five cents a share to the 1990
quarter's figure.</p>
<p>Sales rose 19% to $862 million from $722 million.</p>
<p>Compaq also scored practically all of its sales gains in
Europe, where it ranks second in computer sales to
International Business Machines Corp. in computer sales.
While international sales rose 42%, Compaq managed only a 2%
improvement at home. For the second consecutive quarter,
Compaq sold more personal computers abroad than at home.</p>
<p>The lackluster North American sales raised anew the
question of whether Compaq can hold on to its 29% share of
domestic retail sales of personal computers. Mr. Poyner noted
that both the market and smaller competitors such as Dell
Compute Corp. enjoyed faster sales gains. "I'm sure they gave
up market share," said Mr. Poyner.</p>
<p>Rod Canion, Compaq's chairman, disputed that assessment.
Compaq's unit sales grew faster than revenue because the
manufacturer is cutting prices to hold share, he said. Mr.
Canion pronounced the surgery a success. "Our market strength
is at a high point, and we've introduced seven new products
in the last three months," he said.</p>
<p>Compaq's strength in Britain, West Germany and France
strained the company's production capacities. In turn, the
resulting efficiency gains and slimmer inventories improved
Compaq margins. Mr. Canion noted that Compaq established a
subsidiary in Finland and appointed dealers in East Germany
and Yugoslavia during the quarter.</p>
<p>Compaq also suffered parts shortages that created backlogs
for three of its Deskpro 386 models. Those back orders, and
the recent revival of U.S. sales, also heartened analysts.
"I'm looking for quite strong earnings growth in the second
half," said Eugene G. Glazer, an analyst with Dean Witter
Reynolds.</p>
<p>Compaq earned $196 million, or $2.23 a share, in the first
half, up from $167 million, or $1.94 a share, a year earlier.
Sales were $1.7 billion against $1.4 billion.</p>
<p>Compaq shares closed yesterday at $57.875, off $1.50, in
New York Stock Exchange composite trading.</p>
