	<p class="article-leader">PepsiCo Inc. declared a 3-for-1 stock split. The move
followed a doubling of its stock price in the past 19 months.
   The stock price for the snack food, soft drink and
restaurant company, which has been one of Wall Street's
darlings, had increased about 25% this year alone.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>After a brief halt in trading to announce the split, the
news yesterday pushed Pepsi up another $1.375, to close at
$79.75, in New York Stock Exchange composite trading.</p>
<p>The run-up in Pepsi's stock largely reflects the company's
strong and reliable earnings growth. For nearly four years,
the Purchase, N.Y., concern has reported lockstep quarterly
gains of at least 20% in per-share operating earnings.
Investors have also been attracted by the recession-resistant
nature of Pepsi's businesses and the company's prospects for
expansion in fledgling markets overseas.</p>
<p>What's more, Pepsi's stock had gained a bit of momentum
earlier this year on speculation that food and tobacco
concern Philip Morris Cos. might want to acquire Pepsi. In
March, a business magazine tossed Pepsi into a smorgasbord of
companies considered to be appetizing acquisition candidates
for cash-rich Philip Morris. Pepsi and Philip Morris won't
talk about the speculation, which analysts and investors have
since dismissed as unfounded.</p>
<p>Pepsi, which hasn't split its stock since May 1986, said
the latest split "signals our interest in individual
shareholders -- the men and women who buy our products."
Likewise, when Coca-Cola Co.'s stock got a little pricey
earlier this year, the Atlanta-based soft-drink company
itself declared a 2-for-1 stock split.</p>
<p>The Pepsi split, which is payable Sept. 4 to stock of
record Aug. 10, will triple the number of authorized shares
to 1.8 billion. As of June, Pepsi had about 266.8 million
common shares outstanding. On a post-split basis, Pepsi
declared a quarterly dividend of 10 cents a share, payable
Sept. 30 to stock of record Sept. 14. The company has been
paying 30 cents a share quarterly, indicating no change in
the payout rate.</p>
<p>The split won't require approval from shareholders under
the laws of North Carolina, the state where the company is
incorporated and where a turn-of-the-century pharmacist
whipped up the first Pepsi-Cola soft drink.</p>
