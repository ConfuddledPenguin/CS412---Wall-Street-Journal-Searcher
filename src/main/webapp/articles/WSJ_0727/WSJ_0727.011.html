	<p class="article-leader">TOKYO -- Sales at Japan's department stores and other
major retail stores went up 12% in June from a year earlier
to 1.622 trillion yen ($10.81 billion), the Ministry of
International Trade and Industry announced.
   Ministry officials said unseasonally warm weather during
the month led to brisk sales of summer clothing and such
products as air conditioners.</p>
