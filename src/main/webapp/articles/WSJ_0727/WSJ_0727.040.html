	<p class="article-leader">FORT VALLEY, Ga. -- To go forward, Andrew Young first went
home again last week.
   Battered at the polls in his race for governor, he came to
this south Georgia town to be among black Baptist clergy he
has known since his days as Martin Luther King's deputy. He
recalled past protests. He read from Exodus. And finally he
sang, leading the crowd in the cadences of the old spiritual,
"Guide my feet while I run this race . . . Don't want to run
this race in vain."</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>It was a poignant scene, and the onetime congressman,
United Nations ambassador and mayor of Atlanta seemed for the
moment a man alone. Days before, he had finished a poor
second in a crowded Democratic gubernatorial primary. Now
matched against Lt. Gov. Zell Miller in the Aug. 7 runoff,
his trip here symbolized an effort to shore up his base --
and to heal himself for the weeks ahead.</p>
<p>Mr. Young's campaign is a laboratory for the evolving
politics of the South. No black since Reconstruction has come
so far in pursuit of Georgia's governorship, but he must run
now not only against history but also against himself. More
than Jesse Jackson or Virginia's new Gov. Douglas Wilder, he
has compiled a long record in executive office. As he reaches
out to whites, this record can make Mr. Young a target in his
own community.</p>
<p>Alongside the middle-class leaders of the civil-rights
movement, Mr. Young was upper crust. Even today, campaigning
in a rural farm setting, he is more cool than country. An
ordained minister, he speaks earnestly of "service" and
"economic development," but it is his white rival Mr. Miller
who strikes the more-populist chord by championing a state
lottery for Georgians.</p>
<p>Hundreds of thousands of voters swamped the Democratic
primary July 17 to back the lottery, and Mr. Young's primary
campaign sometimes seems like a morality play lost in a sea
of hucksterism. Few cities are more relentlessly
self-promoting than Atlanta itself, and as the city's mayor
through the 1980s, the thoughtful former pastor from south
Georgia is inevitably drawn into this upscale world.</p>
<p>When he stepped down from City Hall last year, Mr. Young
and his wife were presented with "his" and "hers" luxury cars
by a grateful Chamber of Commerce. Anne Cox Chambers,
chairwoman of the Atlanta Journal-Constitution and a pillar
of the Southern establishment, has given heavily to his
campaign. And even as he runs for governor, Mr. Young is on
retainer to an Atlanta-based international engineering firm
that dispatched him to London this spring.</p>
<p>In last week's primary, Mr. Young won more votes in
Atlanta's Fulton County than Jesse Jackson got there on Super
Tuesday two years ago; but in working-class black precincts,
the former mayor lost critical support to his white rivals.
In the same neighborhoods where Mr. Jackson won better than
90% of the vote, Mr. Young came out 10 to 20 percentage
points lower.</p>
<p>Like whites, blacks were drawn to Mr. Miller's promise of
a lottery. But the pattern also shows an uncertainty about
Mr. Young, who is faulted for having aligned himself closely
with the business community as mayor. "I've supported Andy
Young from the day he went into politics," says Lowell Ware,
the 62-year-old editor of a black newspaper, the Atlanta
Voice. But this year, Mr. Ware gave no endorsement. "What
we're looking for is delivery," he says of Mr. Young. "He's
got to start at the grass roots."</p>
<p>Born just weeks before Mr. Young, the 58-year-old Mr.
Miller has led a career that is a portrait of the
ever-adapting white Southern Democrat. Dubbed "Zig Zag," he
refuses to be an easy foil for left or right. His hero is
former Gov. Ed Rivers, who wore the political galluses of
"Old Gene" Talmadge as a young man but who ultimately sided
with the New Deal against the powerful Georgia demagogue and
business ally.</p>
<p>As a young man, Mr. Miller fell in line with those
opposing civil-rights legislation, but in 1980 he took on the
establishment and the powerful Talmadge legacy in a bitter
and unsuccessful primary fight with then-Sen. Herman
Talmadge. In 16 years as lieutenant governor, Mr. Miller has
made the state Senate his own preserve, and as much as he
casts himself now as a reformer, he has political ties to
vested interests from highway builders to the state medical
association. Until this campaign, he enjoyed a lakeside lot
leased from the Georgia Power Co. unit of Southern Co. And
Mr. Young yesterday demanded public disclosure of any
deposits by lobbyists or public agencies in a small bank
where Mr. Miller and his wife are officers and in which they
hold marketable securities of $607,000.</p>
<p>A former Marine rifle-range instructor, Mr. Miller has a
feisty, spikes-up style; but he leaves the toughest rhetoric
to his professional campaign manager, James Carville, who
spent primary day watching the shoot-'em-up film "Die Hard
II" to calm his nerves. Three years ago, Mr. Carville helped
Wallace Wilkinson win the Kentucky governorship on a platform
calling for a state lottery. And the issue fits now into a
broader effort by the Miller campaign to paint Mr. Young as
the true elitist, imposing rules while elsewhere obeying his
own code.</p>
<p>In the same vein, Mr. Miller casts himself as the mountain
man against urban Atlanta, and runs on a platform intended to
put him on safe ground next November against the GOP's
multimillionaire nominee, Johnny Isakson. Sporting a Marine
pin and cowboy boots, the former college professor talks
tough on drugs while promising a sales-tax exemption for
food; but he finds it harder to explain where he has been as
the state's fiscal problems have evolved. The sales tax, for
example, was raised by 33% only last year, but revenue is
falling below budget projections. Mr. Miller concedes that
the estimates were high -- and that he never protested. "No
one spoke up about it," he says.</p>
<p>Mr. Young, outspent by better than 2-1 on television in
the primary, is expected to be on at least even footing in
the remaining days of the runoff. There is a renewed drive in
the black community for more-unified support; but to overtake
Mr. Miller, Mr. Young must win between 25% to 30% of the
white vote. He comes closest in the metropolitan Atlanta
area, but even there his white support last week totaled only
two-thirds of what he needs, and it falls off further in
rural counties.</p>
<p>No clear emotional issue -- such as abortion rights --
separates him from Mr. Miller. And while Mr. Young has
toughened his attack, Georgia is too content to find much
urgency in his message on jobs and economic development.
"Tough crowd," he sighs after leaving a nearly all-white
union meeting in Atlanta. Days later he is lobbying in
Washington for peanut farmers, whose help he needs among
whites down the red-clay roads of rural south Georgia.</p>
<p>"Martin is gone, Ralph (Abernathy) is gone, I want heroes
walking around in living color," says a black minister and
friend. But in interviews, Mr. Young's comments suggest he is
ready to let slip the racial leadership burden he has helped
carry so long.</p>
<p>"White people," he tells a black congregation in Atlanta,
"they have to overcome over a hundred years of fear, and
nobody preaches that good. Somebody has to move inside them
to make them see clearly the character of a man rather than
the color of his skin. So I ask for your votes, but most of
all I ask for your prayers."</p>
