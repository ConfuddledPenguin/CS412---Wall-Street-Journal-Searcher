Einhorn Jr., Huntington, N.Y., four months.</p>
<p>The exchange barred the following individuals until they
comply with its requests for information or testimony: Derek
J. Baxter, Jersey City, N.J.; Edgar Bellenger Cooper,
Nashville; Steven C. Rickun, Glendale, Wis., and Arthur

avoid the cost of litigation, while Mr. Frost declined to
