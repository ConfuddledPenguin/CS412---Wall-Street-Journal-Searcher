	<p class="article-leader">CINCINNATI -- Procter & Gamble Co. said it completed the
purchase of the toiletry and fragrance businesses of American
Cyanamid Co.'s Shulton Group, excluding the Pierre Cardin
fragrance line, for between $300 million and $370 million.
   As reported, P&G is acquiring the Old Spice and Santa Fe
men's toiletries and fragrances. The final purchase price
hasn't yet been determined, P&G said. It will depend on the
price American Cyanamid, based in Wayne, N.J., obtains for
the Breck hair care and Lady's Choice personal-care product
lines, which also are part of Shulton.</p>
