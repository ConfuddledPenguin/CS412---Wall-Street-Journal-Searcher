	<p class="article-leader">WHITE PLAINS, N.Y. -- American Savings Bank reported a $40
million second-quarter net loss, reflecting an increase of
$41 million in reserves against possible losses on bad loans.
   American Savings and many other Northeast banks and
thrifts have been hurt by the slump in the region's real
estate markets.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The New York state chartered bank made loan-loss
provisions of $54.3 million in 1990's first six months.
American Savings said it will proceed with a "back to basics"
strategy, consolidating its Riverhead Savings operations and
pursuing the sale of other subsidiaries to cut costs and pare
assets.</p>
<p>American's second-quarter net loss equals $6.89 a share,
compared with net income of $7.4 million, or $1.01 a share,
in the year-earlier period. The year-earlier period included
a one-time gain of $3.5 million before taxes from an
insurance settlement for a subsidiary.</p>
<p>The latest quarter's net interest income before provision
for loan losses fell 18% to $19.5 million from $23.7 million
in the yearearlier period.</p>
<p>For the first six months of 1990, American Savings
reported a loss of $49.4 million, or $8.67 a share, compared
with earnings of $13.9 million, or $1.88 a share. The
year-ago period reflects the one-time gain. Net interest
income excluding provisions for loan losses declined 21% to
$39 million from $49.6 million.</p>
<p>At June 30, American's assets totaled $4.14 billion, down
6.5% from Dec. 31 and 9.5% from June 30, 1989.</p>
