	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- The 1980s leveraged buy-out boom is a memory,
and now Wall Street's big LBO funds are rushing to cash out
with a burst of big-ticket sales of companies in their
portfolios.
   In the past two months alone, LBO powerhouse Kohlberg
Kravis Roberts & Co. agreed to sell its Beatrice Co. to
ConAgra Inc. for $1.34 billion and Motel 6 L.P. to France's
Accor S.A. for $1.3 billion.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>In April, KKR sold 10% of Safeway Stores Inc. to the
public in a $112.5 million stock offering.</p>
<p>And last week, Forstmann Little & Co. agreed to sell Moen
Inc. to American Brands Inc. for $975 million.</p>
<p>That could be only the tip of the iceberg. From 1981 to
1989, LBO funds and their pension-fund investors took
hundreds of companies private in a buy-out binge totaling
more than $250 billion.</p>
<p>One reason the companies are so ripe for sale, either to
the public or corporate acquirers, is that LBO funds are
anxious to sell to generate returns for their investors.
That's unlike publicly traded corporations, where managements
often resist takeover bids to avoid losing their jobs.</p>
<p>Some buy-out funds executives make no bones about their
keen interest in selling some of their holdings in coming
months.</p>
<p>Brian Little, a founding partner of Forstmann Little, says
buy-out funds typically "start thinking about taking a
profit" within a few years, once they have made any planned
changes in a company and paid down buy-out debt sufficiently
to generate a healthy return.</p>
<p>Now that Forstmann has agreed to sell Moen, he said:
"We've got two or three other companies which we think over
the next 12 months could also be sold. Our business is
acquiring assets, helping make them worth more, and selling
them."</p>
<p>Wall Street's investment bankers are licking their chops
over more deals in the offing. "Every investment bank has a
list," says Steven Rattner, general partner at Lazard Freres
& Co.</p>
<p>One reason for buy-out firms to strike now is the
still-buoyant stock market, which despite this week's
weakness remains within 80 points of the 3000 mark on the Dow
Jones Industrial Average. That should enable buy-out fund
operators to seek substantial prices for their treasure trove
of companies, whether in a public offering or from a
corporate buyer.</p>
<p>However, what still isn't clear is whether there are
sufficient buyers to go around. Stock-market investors have
been penalizing companies that still carry a heavy debt load,
as they did with KKR's offering of Safeway shares. KKR had to
slash the offering price 22% from the midrange of its
original estimated sale price.</p>
<p>But whether or not the buyers are ready, there is a bulge
in the number of private companies ready for sale. Scott
Newquist, head of investment banking at Kidder, Peabody &
Co., says buy-outs typically generate the highest annual
rates of return for their investors over a three-to-five-year
period. The flurry of sales is occurring now, he says,
because "we're at a time three to five years from when a lot
of buy-outs were done."</p>
<p>James Burke, president of Merrill Lynch Capital Partners,
a leveraged buy-out fund, says: "If you look at the burst of
LBOs that were done in 1984-1987, there are a lot of deals
that should be ripe for the plucking."</p>
<p>However, other fund operators argue -- perhaps partly as a
negotiating posture -- that they aren't in a hurry to sell.
"You may see some more {sales by buy-out funds} because the
stock market is relatively strong," says KKR partner Henry
Kravis. "But if we don't get the right price, we're not under
the gun to do anything."</p>
<p>One LBO manager maintains: "If you talk to our partners
and you said to them, would you rather get a quick 60% to 70%
annual return in one or two years, or would you rather have
long-term annual returns of 30%, my guess is they'd pick the
30%."</p>
<p>Joseph L. Rice, president of LBO firm Clayton & Dubilier,
attributes the recent burst of sales to "just chance." He
doesn't think there is any particular holding period that
will maximize investor returns. "If you have a business that
is performing well, sooner or later something good is going
to happen to you," he says.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, Lazard's Mr. Rattner says buy-out funds have
good reason to seize an opportunity to cash out. "For people
who want to raise new funds in this suspicious environment in
which we live, it's important to show investors profits. And
one thing you certainly learn watching the events of the last
year or two: things that at one instant look like spectacular
deals can quickly look not so spectacular."</p>
<p>One buy-out fund executive, who asked not to be
identified, notes that Forstmann and KKR have spent more than
half of their current buy-out funds and may want to post some
hefty return rates on some buy-outs as they prepare to seek
new investment dollars.</p>
<p>KKR declined to comment. Forstmann's Mr. Little said that
any potential plans to raise more money "are not a factor" in
the timing of company sales.</p>
<p>In seeking buyers, fund operators' first choice is
generally U.S. or foreign corporations with deep pockets.
Leon Kalvaria, a managing director at First Boston Corp.,
says that corporate acquirers will generally pay a higher
price for any given company than a public stock offering
would attract. The reason, he says, is "a strategic buyer is
willing to pay a premium price" to gain control of an entire
company.</p>
<p>But another category of buyer -- other LBO funds -- has
faded, due to weakness in the market of high-risk, high-yield
junk bonds whose sale typically used to finance about 30% of
a buy-out. After KKR bought Beatrice in 1986, several of the
food company's larger pieces were sold to other LBO funds,
notes Lazard's Mr. Rattner.</p>
