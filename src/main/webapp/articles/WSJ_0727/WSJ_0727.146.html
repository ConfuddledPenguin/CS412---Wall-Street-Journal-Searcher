	<p class="article-leader">Eldon Industries Inc., an office-products maker, said it
is evaluating a number of strategic alternatives, including a
sale or business combination.
   The Inglewood, Calif., company said it has had preliminary
discussions with several companies, but that it has reached
no definitive agreements and can give no assurance any sale
or transaction will occur. Eldon said it has hired a
financial adviser to assist in the evaluation. It did not
identify the adviser.</p>
