	<p class="article-leader">NORTH CHICAGO, Ill. -- Abbott Laboratories and its ousted
chairman, Robert A. Schoellhorn, settled name-calling
litigation in an agreement that would seem to allow him to
keep contested stock worth about $4.4 million.
   The bizarre dispute between Mr. Schoellhorn and Abbott's
board burst into the open earlier this year when he sued the
company and some directors in Cook County, Ill., court,
trying to stop them from firing him. He accused some
directors of being liars.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The company retaliated by calling Mr. Schoellhorn a thief,
saying he misappropriated Abbott property, and tried to deny
him 51,600 restricted shares of Abbott common stock.</p>
<p>The stock has since split two for one. In New York Stock
Exchange composite trading yesterday, Abbott stock closed at
$43, down 50 cents. At that price, the post-split 103,200
shares are valued at about $4.4 million.</p>
<p>Abbott is a pharmaceutical and hospital products concern.</p>
<p>In a single-paragraph statement issued late yesterday,
Abbott said the settlement called for dismissal of Mr.
Schoellhorn's lawsuit and that he would "retire from Abbott
Laboratories effective August 31, 1990."</p>
<p>Neither Abbott nor Mr. Schoellhorn's lawyer, John H.
Mathias Jr., would elaborate on the statement. But the
wording implies the executive would be entitled to benefits
he would have received had he retired normally, including the
stock.</p>
