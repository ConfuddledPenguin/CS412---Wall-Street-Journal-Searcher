	<p class="article-leader">BOSTON -- Bank of Boston Corp., grappling with New
England's continuing ecomonic woes, reported sharply lower
second-quarter profit of $3.5 million, or less than one cent
a share, after a $125 million provision for possible loan
losses.
   Separately, BayBanks Inc. posted a second-quarter net loss
of $11.5 million, or 72 cents a share, after a loan-loss
provision of $63.5 million. BayBanks also cut its dividend by
a third.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Bank of Boston's second-quarter profit compared with
year-earlier profit of $97.8 million, or $1.34 a share. The
year-earlier profit included a $36 million provision for loan
losses.</p>
<p>The bank-holding company said that at the end of the
second quarter, its reserves for possible loan losses totaled
$892 million, or 3.91% of outstanding loans and leases, up
from $645 million, or 2.41% a year earlier. The reserves as
of June 30, however, were down from reserves of $967 million,
or 4% of loans and leases, as of March 31.</p>
<p>Bank of Boston noted that "in spite of further weakening
in the real estate market and a declining regional economy,"
its nonperforming assets as of June 30 fell to $1.96 billion
from $1.98 billion as of March 31, 1990. The reduction in
nonperforming assets was due partly to charge-offs of $200
million of bad loans during the quarter, said Peter Manning,
chief financial officer. But a larger portion of the
reduction stemmed from sales of problem real-estate assets
and the reclassification of problem loans as "healthy" ones
after restructuring, he added. As of June 30, 1989,
nonperforming assets totaled $1.47 billion.</p>
<p>The company said that as of June 30, 45% of its troubled
real-estate assets were in New England, 17% in Florida, 5%
each in Georgia, Tennessee and Texas, and 23% in the rest of
the country.</p>
<p>Net interest revenue for the quarter was $246 million,
down from $304 million a year earlier. The net interest
margin fell to 2.92% from 3.78%, reflecting a higher level of
domestic nonperforming assets, lower interest spreads and
lower margins from Latin American operations, the company
said.</p>
<p>Noninterest income for the quarter rose to $205 million
from $195 million a year earlier.</p>
<p>For the six months, Bank of Boston earned $47.2 million,
or 56 cents a share, down from profit of $186.9 million, or
$2.57 a share, a year earlier. Provisions for credit losses
totaled $250 million in the first half of 1990, compared with
$72 million during the year-earlier period.</p>
<p>In New York, Moody's Investors Service, citing
"disappointing second-quarter earnings," said it lowered it
ratings on Bank of Boston's senior debt to Ba-2 from Ba-1 and
on its subordinated debt to B-1 from Ba-3. Moody's lowered
its ratings on other Bank of Boston issues, affecting a total
of $2.2 billion of long-term debt. Moody's noted that despite
higher chargeoffs by the company during the second quarter,
its "aggregate volume of nonperformers remained stable,
suggesting continuing asset quality pressures."</p>
<p>Commenting on the Moody's downgrade, Mr. Manning, Bank of
Boston's chief financial officer, said the bank-holding
company is "obviously disappointed" with Moody's action but
pleased "that Moody's saw fit to maintain certain of our
ratings."</p>
<p>BayBanks second-quarter loss compared with year-earlier
profit of $18.9 million, or $1.18 a share.</p>
<p>For the six months, BayBanks reported a net loss of $25.3
million, or $1.59 a share, compared with year-earlier profit
of $39.7 million, or $2.48 a share, including a nonrecurring
gain of $1.2 million.</p>
<p>BayBanks said its board cut the quarterly dividend to 30
cents a share from 45 cents a share "to conserve capital
during an unsettled period in the region's economy." The
company added that its nonperforming loans rose to $265
million as of June 30, compared with $237 million at the end
of the prior quarter and $87.4 million a year earlier.</p>
<p>Loan loss reserves as of June 30 were $145 million, or 55%
of nonperforming loans, compared with $57.3 million, or
65.6%, of nonperforming loans a year earlier, the company
said.</p>
