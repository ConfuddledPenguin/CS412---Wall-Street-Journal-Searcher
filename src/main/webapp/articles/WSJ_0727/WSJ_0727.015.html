	<p class="article-leader">LONDON -- Sales of new cars in Europe fell 11% in June
from a year earlier, reflecting a decline in all major
markets.
   The June data also show an 11% drop from May, when sales
were up 3.8% on the year. Analysts still predict a year of no
worse than flat, sluggish sales. But some say that, if the
trend goes into July, the downturn could be cause for
concern.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Industry and government statistics from 12 countries that
normally account for 94% of non-communist Europe's
passenger-car sales totalled 1.01 million in June, down from
1.14 million in May and down from 1.13 in June 1989.</p>
<p>Analysts cautioned that month-to-month data can fluctuate
widely, making it difficult to judge trends on the basis of a
single month's data. Some noted that the June figures suffer
from comparison with the strong sales of a year ago, when the
monthly total was 6.8% up on June 1988.</p>
<p>West German new-car sales are expected to rise generally
over the year as East Germans buy either new cars or
second-hand cars, forcing more West German consumers into the
new-car market. In June, West German car sales fell 8% to
259,254 from June 1989 and dropped 9.4% from May.</p>
<p>France's data showed car sales falling 8.4% in June to
152,100 from a year earlier and off 23% from May. Italian
new-car sales lost 5.7% in June to 208,790 from June 1989 and
were off 5.5 % from May.</p>
<p>The U.K. experienced the biggest declines, with June sales
down 18% on both the year and month to 142,697. Spain's data
showed June sales down 21% to 91,816 compared to June 1989
and off 1.9% from May.</p>
