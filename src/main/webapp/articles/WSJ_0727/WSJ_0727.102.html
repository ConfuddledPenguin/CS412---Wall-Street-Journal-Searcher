	<p class="article-leader">CARRBORO, N.C. -- Philip Harvey has legal evidence that
his $20 million-a-year pornography business doesn't violate
the community standards of this sleepy rural town, where it
is based.
   After investigating his mail-order company, Adam & Eve,
the county district attorney decided that its X-rated videos,
magazines and "marital aids" didn't violate state obscenity
law. The D.A. in a neighboring county did put Mr. Harvey on
trial in 1987. After deliberating for less than an hour, the
jury acquitted him.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Yet Mr. Harvey isn't out of trouble -- far from it.
Despite his exoneration in his own community, the federal
government is conducting simultaneous criminal investigations
of him in strait-laced Utah and Kentucky. This week, in an
unusual decision, a federal judge temporarily blocked the
Justice Department from indicting him in more than one
jurisdiction, but federal lawyers will return to court in
September to try to free themselves of the limit.</p>
<p>If the department prevails, Mr. Harvey says, the cost of
fighting the far-flung charges could put him out of business.
He isn't just in double jeopardy, he says, "it's triple
jeopardy, or quadruple."</p>
<p>Mr. Harvey is just one target of what has quietly become
the most aggressive federal attack on pornography in decades.
The effort is being spearheaded by the Justice Department's
10-member obscenity unit, soon to be expanded to 13 members.
Former Attorney General Edwin Meese created the unit largely
to give speeches and draft state anti-porn laws. His
successor, Dick Thornburgh, has turned it into a high-voltage
prosecution machine.</p>
<p>Working with postal inspectors and regional U.S.
attorneys, the unit last year helped in the indictments of
120 individuals and corporations on obscenity charges, up
from only 37 in 1988. Investigations in progress, including
one in Southern California, are expected to produce another
large batch of indictments in coming months.</p>
<p>By bringing cases that have been ignored by most federal
prosecutors for 20 years, Mr. Thornburgh -- a former governor
of Pennsylvania who is said to harbor higher elective
ambitions -- has strengthened his ties to the right. His
putting more child pornographers behind bars has brought
little protest, even from doctrinaire civil libertarians. But
the obscenity unit's offensive against adult pornography --
especially its efforts against material sent by mail,
code-named Project Postporn -- has begun to create
controversy.</p>
<p>The federal strategy is to threaten two or more criminal
trials in quick succession in geographically disparate, and
often politically conservative, jurisdictions. Many
defendants fold under such pressure, often agreeing to guilty
pleas barring them not only from future criminal activity,
but also from the sale of any kind of sexually explicit
material.</p>
<p>In some instances, prosecutors are also exploiting
extensions of the federal racketeering law to seize and
forfeit obscenity defendants' legitimate inventories and
other assets, effectively driving them out of business. In a
landmark decision in April, a federal appeals court in
Richmond, Va., upheld the practice, comparing it to taking
assets from "Colombian drug lords."</p>
<p>Critics charge that the obscenity unit's hardball tactics
breach the First Amendment by bullying defendants into
self-censorship. "There can be a chilling effect on all sorts
of legitimate artistic expression," says Robert O'Neil, a
First Amendment scholar at the University of Virginia. Coming
at the same time as local obscenity prosecutions in Fort
Lauderdale, Fla., of the rap music group 2 Live Crew and in
Cincinnati of a gallery director who displayed Robert
Mapplethorpe's homoerotic photographs, Project Postporn
raises the danger that "the conscientious artist will
restrain expression for fear" of punishment, Mr. O'Neil says.</p>
<p>Patrick Trueman, director of the obscenity unit, offers no
apologies. "If people in America want their communities to
look like Times Square and 42nd Street, they have every right
to do so," says the Reagan appointee. "If they don't, you
have to prosecute obscenity. That's what we do."</p>
<p>Postporn targets distributors of films similar to those
available in many neighborhood video shops. One of the
X-rated films that was the basis of a conviction earlier this
year, "Prisoner of Paradise," offers "a spoof storyline of
sorts, having to do with American World War II prisoners and
Nazis," as well as "some nice scenery," says Roy Miller, a
postal inspector involved in the case.</p>
<p>Mr. Miller recalls that as a young postal cop in 1973, he
couldn't interest federal prosecutors in adult obscenity
cases, including one he had built against a distributor named
Myron Shapiro. Times have changed. The same Myron Shapiro was
recently convicted in federal court in Harrisburg, Pa., for
mailing "Prisoner of Paradise" and another film, which,
according to Mr. Miller, are milder than those the defendant
sold 17 years ago.</p>
<p>Under Supreme Court rulings, juries can convict
pornographers only after finding that the average person
applying contemporary standards of the community would find
the material taken as a whole appeals to prurient interest,
depicts sexual conduct in a patently offensive way and lacks
serious literary, artistic, political or scientific value.</p>
<p>Prosecutors contend -- and some federal courts have agreed
-- that since each community has its own standards, a porn
distributor may be tried in each jurisdiction to which he
mails allegedly obscene materials. "It's like a bank robber
who robs in a number of jurisdictions," says Mary Spearing,
deputy director of the Justice obscenity unit. "He could be
prosecuted separately for each robbery."</p>
<p>Anton Valukas, the U.S. attorney in Chicago until he left
for private practice in December, says that while he brought
some child pronography cases, he did little in the field of
garden-variety adult pornography. Mr. Valukas, now a partner
with a Chicago firm whose Washington office represents Mr.
Harvey, stresses that because obscenity convictions require a
finding of a violation of "contemporary community standards,"
it would be "impossible, at least unlikely, to convict . . .
in a city that would not be offended by your average X-rated
videos."</p>
<p>Just such a situation arose last year, when a federal
judge in Los Angeles dismissed obscenity charges against a
distributor, saying that he couldn't determine the community
standard in the city that produces most of the country's
sexually oriented films.</p>
<p>The U.S. porn industry, with annual revenues estimated at
$10 billion, hasn't been noticeably hurt yet by stepped-up
federal enforcement, says Detective Robert Peters, a vice
officer with the Los Angeles Police Department. But the
Justice Department reports that complaints about unsolicited
ads for adult films have fallen.</p>
<p>Justice Department officials say they launched Postporn in
response to "hundreds of thousands" of citizen complaints and
that cases are brought in areas where large numbers of people
object to unsolicited sexually explicit advertisements. But
defendants claim that major distributors are being
selectively prosecuted and that the government is employing
an old legal trick known as "forum shopping." In the
obscenity context, that means bringing cases in conservative
jurisdictions, where judges and juries are thought to be
hostile to pornography.</p>
<p>Mr. Harvey's legal counterattack asserts that the Justice
Department's real goal is to pressure him into
self-censorship to avoid multiple prosecutions. Prosecutors
deny it. But in a strongly worded opinion released Monday,
Washington, D.C., federal Judge Joyce Hens Green said Mr.
Harvey had made credible allegations that prosecutors had
violated the First Amendment and acted in "bad faith" by
using threats to try to force him to drop distribution of all
sexually related material, including Playboy magazine.</p>
<p>Judge Green also preliminarily endorsed Mr. Harvey's
contention that even if he could prevail in different
jurisdictions, the burden of fighting multiple prosecutions
would violate due process and could destroy his company
anyway. Mr. Harvey, the judge wrote, faces "annihilation, by
attrition if not conviction."</p>
<p>In her opinion, Judge Green cited an earlier Postporn
case, in which another federal judge temporarily blocked the
Justice Department from bringing successive obscenity
prosecutions against a different defendant. But the Justice
Department disputes the significance of that 1988 opinion.
The judge vacated his order when the defendant, Avram
Freedberg, agreed to dissolve his company, have it plead
guilty to federal charges in Utah, Mississippi and Delaware
and pay a fine of $600,000.</p>
<p>Karl Brussel, a New York porn distributor, similarly
pleaded guilty last month to reduced obscenity charges rather
than face four trials scheduled within seven weeks. Two of
the prosecutions would have been in separate federal courts
in Alabama, a state not known for its hospitality to such
defendants.</p>
<p>In their plea bargains, Messrs. Brussel and Freedberg
signed away their rights to do any business involving
sexually explicit material, whether deemed obscene or not.
"This violates everything the First Amendment stands for,"
complains Mr. Brussel's lawyer, Martin Garbus. The attorney
says his client, who accepted a one-year prison term,
couldn't afford to stand on principle because of the prospect
of ruinous legal costs and the risk that members of his
family would join him behind bars if he didn't cooperate.</p>
<p>Mr. Trueman, the Justice Department lawyer who negotiated
the Brussel plea, concedes that the defendant lost basic
constitutional rights. "We don't want to have to re-prove
obscenity in a new trial against the Brussels {family}, so
under the agreement all we would have to show is that they
were back in the `sexually explicit' business," he explains.
"Martin Garbus says these guys are forfeiting First Amendment
rights. That's correct; they are. The reason is that they're
criminals, and they can't be trusted."</p>
<p>When Postporn defendants choose to go to trial --
relatively few have -- the obscenity unit supplies
experienced out-of-town talent. Myron Shapiro's trial in
January illustrates the risks of fighting the feds in court.</p>
<p>A grand jury in Harrisburg indicted Mr. Shapiro both for
sending obscene videos through the mail and for merely
offering to sell the films, which is a separate crime. As in
nearly all such cases, there wasn't any doubt that he had
committed the acts in question. Instead, the issue was
whether the acts were illegal. That, in turn, depended on
whether the jury considered the suspect films to be obscene.</p>
<p>To convince the jurors that the material met the Supreme
Court's obscenity test, prosecutors dimmed the courtroom
lights and let the films speak for themselves. Then Ms.
Spearing, the obscenity unit's deputy director, stepped in to
try to undercut expert defense witnesses who testifed that
the movies in question were acceptable according to community
standards.</p>
<p>In a preliminary hearing in the Shapiro case, she attacked
one such witness by showing he had testified, for pay,
numerous times for pornographers and had never seen a
sexually oriented film that he thought violated a community's
standards. The Shapiro defense team decided not to use the
witness in front of the jury.</p>
<p>Joseph Scott, an Ohio State University sociology professor
who did testify for Mr. Shapiro before the jury, ran into a
different Spearing ploy: She asked him about the hidden
premises of a statistical study he had conducted and from
which he concluded that stores in the Harrisburg area on
average carried hundreds of films comparable to Mr.
Shapiro's. Her persistent questioning revealed that Prof.
Scott had excluded from his calculations video stores and
supermarkets that didn't carry any X-rated films.</p>
<p>Although convicted, Mr. Shapiro won't be sentenced until
November. That's when he is scheduled to be in federal court
in Memphis -- to face another obscenity trial.</p>
