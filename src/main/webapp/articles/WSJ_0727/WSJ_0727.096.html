	<p class="article-leader">GENEVA -- OPEC ministers neared agreement on a new output
ceiling intended to reduce the current world oil glut and
push up crude oil prices.
   The ministers of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries remained at odds, however, over just how far those
prices should rise. Most seek an eventual boost of about $2 a
barrel but others are aiming for much more. Late last night,
they held informal talks aimed at resolving those
differences. They'll resume their formal conference today.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Before the meeting started this week, Iraq had moved
troops onto Kuwait's border and angrily alleged it was being
damaged by low oil prices brought on by excessive Kuwaiti
ouput. Yesterday, however, Baghdad scaled back its weeklong
intimidation campaign, and leaders of the two nations are
scheduled to meet this weekend in Saudi Arabia.</p>
<p>A majority of the OPEC ministers are supporting a new
total production ceiling of 22.5 million barrels a day for
the remainder of the year. While 400,000 barrels a day above
OPEC's current ceiling, that ceiling would be well below the
organization's actual output most of this year because the
old ceiling was routinely exceeded.</p>
<p>Among the attractions of the new ceiling proposal are a
pledge by Kuwait to adhere to its official quota from now on,
and what amounts to a return to the OPEC fold by the United
Arab Emirates, which would get a new quota. Previously, the
UAE all but ignored its quota.</p>
<p>If all members honor a 22.5-million-barrel ceiling, the
supply of OPEC oil on world markets would shrink and prices
would rise as current excess inventories are worked off.
Continued output at that new ceiling also should strengthen
prices more later in the year because oil demand increases in
the fall and winter.</p>
<p>The problem for ministers has become the setting of a new
"reference", or target, price for OPEC oil. For the past four
years, OPEC has had an official reference price of $18 a
barrel, averaged over its various grades of crude. But that
has been rarely sustained because chronic quota "cheating" by
some members has created excess supply. Even after a recent
quick run-up from the year's low of $14, OPEC oil prices
still are shy of $18 a barrel.</p>
<p>Sadek Boussena, Algeria's oil minister and president of
OPEC, justifying the call for a higher figure, estimated the
old reference price would be $22.70 a barrel today if
adjusted into current dollars. A majority of the 13 OPEC
nations consider an increase of $2 a barrel realistic, but an
increase of $7 a barrel has been demanded by President Saddam
Hussein of Iraq.</p>
<p>"We are arguing very hard" on the pricing issue, said
Gholamreza Aghazadeh, Iran's oil minister who has been
leading the push for an increase of $2 a barrel in the $18
reference price.</p>
<p>OPEC's reference price is largely symbolic; a goal it
hopes to achieve in the open market through manipulation of
its production, rather than through a set selling price.
Nonetheless, the reference price has emerged as the
centerpiece of the campaign started in February by the Iraqi
president against Kuwait and the UAE for what he claimed was
their "economic warfare" against Iraq.</p>
<p>That confrontation grew rapidly, with Kuwait becoming the
chief target. It climaxed with last week's troop and tank
movements and this week's demand here by Iraqi oil minister
Issam Abdul Raheem Al-Chalabi for an increase in OPEC's
reference price to $25 a barrel.</p>
<p>So far, that figure has been supported only by Libya.
Although it is understood Mr. Al-Chalabi would need
government permission to change his stance, some ministers
attempted to negotiate a figure of $21 or $22. But they ran
into an unexpected obstacle. "There is a stalemate," said
one. "One group {believed to be led by Venezuela} won't go
above $20."</p>
<p>While Iraq isn't likely to prevail in its bold bid to push
the OPEC reference price all the way to $25, several oil
ministers conceded the attempt has at least revived waning
discipline within the organization.</p>
<p>"It's a whole new ballgame," Ginandjar Kartasasmita,
Indonesia's oil minister, said in an interview. "There are
two countries that can take the credit." He named Saudi
Arabia "for its courage in cutting production last May to set
the pace" and Iraq "for its determination to restore quota
discipline."</p>
<p>Separately, as expected, Ramzi Salman, Iraq's
oil-marketing director, was named to fill the vacant post of
deputy secretary-general of OPEC.</p>
