	<p class="article-leader">HONG KONG -- Prospects for earnings growth improved in
Hong Kong, Malaysia, South Korea and Thailand during June,
according to a monthly survey of analysts by Institutional
Brokers Estimate System. The earnings outlook was unchanged
in Japan, Australia and Singapore, while prospects dimmed
slightly in New Zealand.
   IBES, a unit of the New York-based securities firm Lynch,
Jones & Ryan, calculates "consensus" earnings estimates based
on thousands of analysts' company and market reports. It
projects 12 months ahead by combining pershare earnings
estimates for each company's current fiscal year with
forecasts for its coming year.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The system also measures the level of disagreement among
analysts, which is reflected in a so-called uncertainty
estimate. In addition, the statistics include a figure for
earnings revisions during the month. The figure is expressed
as a percentage showing whether upward or downward revisions
dominated.</p>
<p>Because of insufficient data, IBES doesn't provide
estimates for Taiwan or Indonesia. This month, the system
begins offering projections on the Philippines.</p>
