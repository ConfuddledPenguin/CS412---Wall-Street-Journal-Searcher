	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- National Broadcasting Co.'s consumer and
business cable channel, CNBC, selected Albert F. Barber, a
financial executive without a background in programming or
journalism, as its new president. He succeeds Michael
Eskridge, who resigned earlier this week.
   Mr. Barber, 44 years old, has been executive
vice-president and chief financial officer at NBC, a unit of
General Electric Co., since 1987.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"My job first and foremost is to manage the business and
motivate people," Mr. Barber said in an interview. "I have a
financial background and that's what CNBC's programming is
all about. I talk the businessman's language."</p>
<p>CNBC, a 24-hour channel based in Fort Lee, N.J., started
in April 1989 with 13 million subscribers; it now has about
16.8 million subscribers. But growth has been slow, and the
channel is still far short of its 30-million-subscriber
breakeven point.</p>
<p>Mr. Barber said he "raised his hand" when the job became
available, and NBC president Robert C. Wright was "pleasantly
surprised. . . ."</p>
<p>A 20-year veteran of GE, Mr. Barber said he didn't
anticipate immediate changes in CNBC personnel or
programming.</p>
<p>CNBC is jointly owned by NBC Cable and Cablevision Systems
Corp., Woodbury, N.Y. Mr. Barber, no stranger to CNBC, is one
of two NBC executives to serve on its board of directors.</p>
