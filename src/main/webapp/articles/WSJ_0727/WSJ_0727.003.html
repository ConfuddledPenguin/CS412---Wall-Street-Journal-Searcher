	<p class="article-leader">I must comment on your July 10 article concerning CEO
succession, which importantly involved Procter & Gamble and
me. This article represented a sad day for journalism in
general, and for The Wall Street Journal as far as I am
concerned. I say that from a professional standpoint, not
just because of my personal involvement.
   We knew this story was being written. We had been told by
your reporter that she had heard from several sources that I
had interviewed for and had been among the final contenders
for the Campbell Soup CEO job. When I learned about this I
was on a trip in the Far East. Gerry Gendell, head of our
public-affairs division, called the reporter personally to
relay our conversation on this subject. We told her the
reports she had received were "flat wrong." I didn't have one
conversation, or one contact about the Campbell position with
anyone. Moreover, we confirmed this in writing.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Your staff knows our company. We do not lie. At a minimum
I would have expected, with this flat denial, a professional
job would have been done of finding out what the truth was. I
feel sure that a contact with the appropriate senior people
at Campbell could have revealed that it was not true.</p>
<p>Beyond this, there are statements in the article about my
personal feelings that are absolutely wrong. Of course, there
is no way for a reporter who doesn't know me or my associates
closely to be aware of this. But what valid purpose does it
serve to speculate on this?</p>
<p>We try to work with the Journal in an open way. We gave
you the right input on this story. It is depressing to me
that despite that input, unsubstantiated rumors were allowed
to control the day -- and that the appropriate research was
not done to come to a proper determination of the facts.</p>
