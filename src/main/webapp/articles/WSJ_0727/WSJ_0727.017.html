	<p class="article-leader">It was a scene that would have warmed the hearts of the
Nintendo board of directors: The family sat transfixed
watching nine-year-old Jimmy, hero of the movie "The Wizard,"
sweep the final round of the Nintendo World Cup competition
while, on a separate screen, Dad was struggling frantically
to subdue level 8/4 of "Tetris." But such golden Nintendo
moments are getting rarer these days. Despite Nintendo's
aggressive marketing efforts -- "The Wizard," for example,
looks like a thinly disguised infomercial on the joys and
benefits of Nintendo -- it is clear that the home video game
giant has lost some of its luster.
   You don't have to see Nintendo's balance sheet to sense
trouble in Super Marioland. There are telltale signs that the
public's passion for this love-child of the television set
and the computer chip may be cooling:</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>-- The video-games aisle at the Toys `R' Us often is
deserted. Until recently, this was a bustling marketplace of
ideas where scores of cognoscenti met to swap vital game
information. Today you're lucky if you run into somebody who
knows a Jelectro from a Para-Goomba. In the past, cartridge
racks marked "WE'RE OUT. MORE ON THE WAY]" stood as mute
testimony to the carnage wrought by maddened shoppers in
search of the latest video thrill; today such signs are few
and far between.</p>
<p>-- The Game Boy -- Nintendo's plunge into the hand-held
video game market -- timed to make a splash last Christmas,
made only a ripple. Supplies of the game, widely expected to
be snatched off the shelves by December, held up just fine.</p>
<p>-- The Power Pad -- a plastic mat that turns your Nintendo
into an electronic aerobics machine -- has faltered for lack
of supporting software. Other attachments, such as Mattel's
super-sophisticated Power Glove, are going begging.</p>
<p>-- A player recently called the Nintendo Hotline
(206-885-7529) -- which offers advice and news about current
and soon-to-be released games -- and got through on the first
try. Repeated busy signals and half-hour waits were the rule
only a few months ago.</p>
<p>-- My eight-year-old son, Yale -- the most serious
Nintendo player in a family of Nintendo junkies -- recently
was heard to say: "Not another Nintendo cartridge, Dad. How
about a backgammon set instead?"</p>
<p>While it's far too early to count Nintendo out of the home
video game market -- after all, millions of American
households own Nintendo machines -- it is worth trying to
figure out what went wrong. The answer, I suspect, is that
Nintendo has become the victim of its own success. Nintendo
controls virtually every aspect of production, marketing and
distribution of its games; it maintains an orderly market.</p>
<p>But is it too orderly?</p>
<p>The games marketed over the past couple of years have
taken on a monotonous uniformity; prices have shot up
mercilessly; and consumer services have eroded. The lesson
here may be that a planned economy -- even a privately
planned one -- sows the seeds of its own destruction.</p>
<p>In the beginning, Nintendo games were exciting and
reasonably priced. What still are some of the most innovative
game cartridges were released during Nintendo's first two
years, at prices from $20 to $40. "Super Mario Brothers,"
"Zelda," "Metroid," "Kid Icarus," "Wrecking Crew," "Solomon's
Key," "World Runner," "KluKlu Land," "Rygar," "Legacy of the
Wizard": All of these, and another handful released between
1986 and 1988, reflected ingenious efforts at creating games
with unique feel, graphics and concept. At about $30, they
were a darn good entertainment value.</p>
<p>Nintendo games now start at $40 and run up to about $75.
Worse still, interesting new games are rare as hens' teeth.
Many "new" games mimic not only the concept but also the
music and graphics of earlier ones. Nintendo's most recent
offering, "Final Fantasy," for example, is a rehash of
"Ultima" and "Dragon Warrior." It seems like the only really
novel game Nintendo has released in a couple of years is the
aforementioned "Tetris," a game invented in the Soviet Union
that's so exciting and challenging it's instantly addictive.</p>
<p>The lack of innovation and diversity in a medium that is
constrained only by the imagination of the programmer and the
skill of the graphic artist is surprising. The reason may be
that Nintendo's careful filtering process allows production
of only those games it approves of. Having to satisfy the
Nintendo censor might well chill the creativity of potential
game producers.</p>
<p>Nintendo also has ham-handedly interfered with normal
retailer-customer relations. In the good old days, if you
took your Nintendo product home and it didn't work, you could
get an exchange from your retailer, just as with most other
consumer products. No more. I recently tried to return a
defective game cartridge and was advised that Nintendo
prohibits such exchanges: "They won't take 'em back from us,
so we get stuck with them. If you have a problem send the
defective product to Nintendo in Redmond, Washington." Well,
good luck. Video-game players definitely are into instant
gratification, not this mail-and-wait routine. Most
manufacturers can't push retailers and consumers around like
this, but when you're the Donkey Kong of the business, maybe
you can get away with it.</p>
<p>No doubt, Nintendo has what it thinks are fine business
reasons for its strategy, but the bottom line is that the
lack of effective competition may have made it fat and
flabby. Maybe they'll pull it out, maybe they won't. In the
meantime, my sons and I will be playing a bit of backgammon,
as we wait for the situation to clear up.</p>
