	<p class="article-leader">Congress laid to rest two ethics cases this week. The
Senate voted 96-0 to denounce David Durenberger for financial
misconduct. The House voted 408-18 to reprimand Rep. Barney
Frank for his actions on behalf of a male prostitute. Ethics
experts say the votes finally show a willingness by Congress
to discipline Members, though we worry that the real effect
will be closer to a new ritual of confession and penance. If
ethics were the first priority in the congressional club,
Senator Durenberger and Rep. Frank would resign.
   In any event, we're less worried about personal finances
or private behavior than about what Congresspersons do during
working hours, especially with the S&L crisis costing every
American family $3,000 or more. Congress will not have begun
to tackle its ethics problem, or its tattered image, until it
starts to draw some lines around "constituent service."</p>
