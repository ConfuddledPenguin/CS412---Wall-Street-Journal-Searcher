	<p class="article-leader">HAWAIIAN ELECTRIC INDUSTRIES Inc. (Honolulu) -- Moody's
Investors Service Inc. said it downgraded its ratings on this
utility holding company's medium-term notes to single-A-3
from single-A-1, and on commercial paper to prime-2 from
prime-1. The rating concern said about $115 million of
securities are affected. Moody's said it believes that the
debt quality of Hawaiian Electric's non-utility subsidiaries
"is sufficiently below that of the utility to justify
assignment of the single-A-3 rating." The utility's senior
secured debt remains rated single-A-1. Hawaiian Electric
Industries is the parent of Hawaiian Electric Co., American
Savings Bank, Hawaiian Insurance & Guaranty Co., and Hawaiian
Tug & Barge Corp. Moody's downgraded its ratings on
securities of the utility subsidiary in December.
