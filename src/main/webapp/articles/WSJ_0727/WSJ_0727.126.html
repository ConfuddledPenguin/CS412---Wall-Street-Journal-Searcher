	<p class="article-leader">Another lawsuit against Eli Lilly & Co. charging that its
new antidepressant drug Prozac causes destructive side
effects helped trigger a sell-off in Lilly's stock.
   The lawsuit, filed in state court in Jefferson County,
Ky., seeks $150 million in punitive damages from the
Indianapolis-based drug maker on behalf of the widows of
three victims in a September 1989 mass shooting by a Prozac
user in a Louisville, Ky., printing plant. The suit was the
second of its kind in recent weeks charging that Prozac
causes patients to engage in violent or self-destructive
behavior.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Lilly declined to comment on the suit, saying it never
comments on pending litigation. Edward West, a Lilly
spokesman, however, said the gunman in the mass shooting, who
committed suicide after killing seven people and injuring
about 20 others, had a history of homicidal threats and
suicide attempts before he began taking Prozac. "It wouldn't
appear that Prozac caused this behavior," Mr. West said.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, nervousness over reports of the lawsuit on
the Professional Investor Report newswire, coupled with a
renewed attack on Prozac by an affiliate of the Church of
Scientology, triggered a wave of selling and a trading halt
in Lilly shares on the New York Stock Exchange yesterday.
Lilly common closed at $79.625, down $4.375, on volume of
about 1.6 million shares.</p>
<p>The market reaction arose partly from Prozac's enormous
recent buildup. The drug has been heavily publicized as a
safe, easy-to-use treatment for depression, and some doctors
have been overzealous in prescribing it. Prozac promises to
become a $1 billion product by next year, making it the
best-selling drug for depression. Eli Lilly cited its rapid
growth in reporting a 26% second-quarter profit increase
earlier this month.</p>
<p>The sudden attention to side effects caused "some nervous
profit-taking" in the stock, said Craig Baskin, an analyst
with Duff & Phelps in Chicago, who said he is still bullish
on Lilly. "This is an idiot-proof drug," easy to prescribe
and use, he said. "It's a great drug. It works for a lot of
people" for whom other kinds of antidepressants aren't
effective."</p>
<p>In the latest suit, the widows of three of the people
killed in the Sept. 14, 1989, Louiville shootings assert that
Lilly "should have known that Prozac was dangerous and unsafe
for use by members of the general public" and caused "intense
agitation and medically induced preoccupation with suicide."
An autopsy report on the gunman, Joseph Wesbecker, showed
therapeutic levels, or dosages appropriate for medical use,
of Prozac in his blood, B. Hume Morris, attorney for the
widows, said.</p>
<p>Lilly was sued earlier this month by a New York woman, who
charged that Prozac caused her to commit acts of
self-destruction and to make attempts at suicide. The suit,
filed in state court in Suffolk County, New York, seeks $150
million in damages.</p>
<p>Separately, the Citizens Commission on Human Rights, a Los
Angeles-based affiliate of the Church of Scientiology,
renewed its attack on Prozac. In a news release, the group
said it had written to Rep. John Dingell, chairman of the
House Energy and Commerce Committee, asking for a recall of
the drug.</p>
<p>In Washington, a spokesman for Rep. Dingell, a Michigan
Democrat, said he wasn't aware of any letter from the group,
adding that the committee isn't examining the Prozac issue.</p>
<p>A Lilly spokesman, noting that the Church of Scientology
"has a long and well-documented history of criticizing
psychiatric medicine," said the company "sees no useful
purpose in engaging in any dialogue" regarding the group's
views.</p>
