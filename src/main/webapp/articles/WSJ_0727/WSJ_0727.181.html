	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- The Canadian dollar, backed by high interest
rates, climbed closer to a 10-year high against the U.S.
currency.
   The U.S. unit was mixed against other major currencies in
quiet trading ahead of the scheduled release of U.S. gross
national product figures today.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Late in the New York trading day, the Canadian dollar
stood at 86.75 U.S. cents, up from 86.69 cents in New York
late Wednesday. The Canadian dollar hasn't closed above 87
cents since July 10, 1980, when it finished at 87.14 cents.
Yesterday's rise prompted a modest intervention by the Bank
of Canada early in the North American trading day.</p>
<p>The U.S. currency slipped to 1.6245 marks in late New York
trading from 1.6250 marks late Wednesday. Against the
Japanese currency, the dollar was changing hands at 150.37
yen, up from 149.89 yen. Sterling was trading at $1.8140, up
from $1.8117.</p>
<p>In Tokyo Friday, the dollar was trading at 150.45 yen soon
after the opening; it closed at 150.11 yen in Tokyo Thursday.
Meanwhile, the U.S. currency was trading at about 1.6253
marks, up from Tokyo's Thursday close of 1.6248 marks.</p>
<p>Commenting on the Canadian currency's rise, David
Glowacki, a foreign-exchange trader at National Bank of
Detroit, said the market is bound to try to push the currency
higher. However, "the fact that we're so close to the
{10-year} high is also scaring some people off," he said.</p>
<p>Canada has joined Australia and Britain as countries whose
currencies have strengthened largely because of high domestic
interest rates.</p>
<p>For weeks, investors unsure of U.S. interest rates and
German economic stability have favored short-term investments
denominated in Canadian dollars.</p>
<p>In fact, some traders attribute the Canadian dollar's
strength mostly to short-term worries about other currencies.
These jitters stem from mixed signals on U.S. rates by
Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan, some evidence
that German monetary union may be less than smooth, the
potential effect on Europe of Soviet President Mikhail
Gorbachev's domestic troubles and uncertainty about the
timing of Britain's full entry into the European Monetary
System.</p>
<p>Margaret Stur, vice president for foreign exchange at
Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce in New York, said she
expects the Canadian dollar to stay within a narrow range
against the U.S. unit for the near future. She added, "We
have no corporate interest, long-term, in selling {U.S.}
dollars for Canadian."</p>
<p>The Bank of Canada intervened to damp its currency's rise
early in the North American session, traders said, by selling
Canadian dollars for U.S. dollars. The traders described the
intervention as "modest."</p>
<p>In Europe, the dollar was modestly higher, helped largely
by the weakness of the yen against other major currencies.</p>
<p>Traders in London, as in North America, said they were
hesistant ahead of the release of preliminary U.S.
second-quarter gross national product figures today.</p>
<p>The dollar finished higher in Asia Thursday, ending in
Tokyo at 150.11 yen, compared with 149.13 yen Wednesday.</p>
<p>Traders in Tokyo said the dollar will test the 151 yen
level over the next few days, with the next major target at
151.50 yen. The Japanese stock market's continued weakness
contributed to the yen's decline against most currencies. The
yen has also weakened on signs that the Bank of Japan won't
raise interest rates in the short term.</p>
<p>On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for current
delivery settled at $369.30 an ounce, down $2.70. Estimated
volume was a moderate four million ounces.</p>
<p>In early trading in Hong Kong Friday, gold was quoted at
$369.05 an ounce.</p>
