	<p class="article-leader">HONG KONG -- Beijing's efforts to mend an unraveling
economy and reduce the potential for social unrest are
forcing China's leaders to scale back a long-running
austerity program, make credit more available and risk a
sharply wider budget deficit.
   "Since June 4 {1989, when Chinese troops opened fire on
demonstrators in Beijing}, the Chinese leaders have been
grappling with the issue of their own survival," says Lo
Chi-kin, a political commentator here. "Maintaining stability
is the key to survival."</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Foreign analysts say the moves reflect a policy shift this
year that emphasizes political, economic and social
stability. Signs that credit was easing were evident late
last year, but a big expansion came during this year's second
quarter, when loans outstanding grew at a rate comparable to
that in 1988's first half, before austerity was introduced.
Premier Li Peng signaled a further loosening this month by
announcing a cut in lending rates, the second since late
March.</p>
<p>China's leaders have said that the austerity program would
remain in force for at least one more year. Yet the credit
easing means that Beijing has all but abandoned one of its
two main tools for damping inflation. The other, strict
control over state investment, was also relaxed this month
with Mr. Li's promise to release new funds for revamping
factories.</p>
<p>"Austerity hardly exists anymore," Mr. Lo says. An
official in Guangdong province says: "Li Peng is bent on
improving the economy. To stay in power, he has to keep up
with wage payments and keep workers off the street."</p>
<p>Beijing's predicament stems from a collision of economic
and political policies. When authorities imposed the
austerity program in September 1988 to rein in an overheating
economy, the belt-tightening measures didn't provoke much
more than grumbling among a populace accustomed to the
central government's zigzags. But the brutal crackdown on
pro-democracy demonstrators in June 1989, and the repressive
measures that followed, spurred stronger resentment of
members of the public.</p>
<p>China's leaders fear that the moves have so alienated the
people that further discontent would erupt into even more
widespread protests and threaten to bring down the Communist
Party. In a similar vein, Beijing hard-liners have checked
the impulse to purge sympathizers of former party chief Zhao
Ziyang, analysts say, for fear of exacerbating the rifts in
the party that appeared amid disagreement over how to handle
the protests in Beijing.</p>
<p>The latest policy shift was summed up in a banner headline
on a front-page editorial in the People's Daily last month:
"Stability Supersedes Everything Else." The source of the
headline was a speech by Deng Xiaoping, who engineered the
stability policy. "If China isn't stable, the world won't be
stable. What would happen if civil war breaks out in China?
Ten million people will go to Thailand, 100 million to
Indonesia and 500,000 to Hong Kong," Mr. Deng was quoted as
saying by the Beijing-controlled Wen Wei Po newspaper here
last month.</p>
<p>Although China's heavily censored press doesn't mention
them, there have been workers' strikes in the past year, and
Beijing's leaders are worried that such actions could become
widespread, analysts say. Workers already are grumbling about
reduced bonuses as most Chinese factories are either
operating below capacity or have stopped production because
of the economic slowdown.</p>
<p>Premier Li apparently hopes that easing credit will
improve both the economy and his prospects for keeping his
job.</p>
<p>During the second quarter, the net increase in debt
outstanding was 45 billion yuan ($9.52 billion), up from 16.1
billion yuan during the first quarter. Loans outstanding at
the end of June grew about 20% from the end of June 1989,
compared with a 23% growth rate in 1988's first half, before
the austerity program was introduced.</p>
<p>The injection of funds seems to have helped reverse the
slide in industrial output. Production declined 0.9% in
1990's first two months from a year earlier but expanded 3.2%
in the March-May period, according to official statistics.</p>
<p>Wages are growing at a similar rate, rising 4% in the
first five months. The inflation rate was cut to 4% in the
same period from a peak of 27% at the beginning of last year.
In May, retail prices were 2.6% above the level a year
earlier but were rising at a lower rate, the State
Statistical Bureau says.</p>
<p>Citing improved economic indicators, Premier Li even
declared for the first time that the Chinese economy "has
gotten over, or is getting over, the most difficult period."</p>
<p>Many analysts disagree, however. Though overall industrial
output -- including state plants, collectively owned
factories and other enterprises -- has edged up, profits of
state factories alone have declined precipitously, the
analysts say. Noting that demand hasn't recovered, some
analysts speculate that the increase in output had probably
ended up in warehouses. That and rising raw-material prices,
they say, explain the sharp drop in state factories' profits
in recent months.</p>
