<p>I've heard many people say,</p>
<p>But in all my years of jogging</p>
<p>I've never found it that way.</p>
<p>In fact, that little comment</p>
<p>Really goes against the grain --</p>
<p>How can it be boring</p>
<p>While it's causing so much pain?</p>
<p>-- Arnold J. Zarett.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>Once Is Enough</p>
<p>The prospect of a second childhood</p>
<p>I can face with acquiescence,</p>
<p>Provided it doesn't lead to</p>
<p>A second adolescence.</p>
<p>-- Edward F. Dempsey.</p>
