	<p class="article-leader">CHICAGO -- A federal judge ordered three Swiss-franc
futures traders to be retried March 5 on fraud and
racketeering charges on which a jury earlier this month
couldn't reach a verdict.
   In the first courtroom test of the federal investigation
of alleged futures trading fraud, two of the traders, Robert
Mosky and Danny Scheck, were found guilty of eight counts of
violating the Commodity Exchange Act out of more than 100
counts against them. The third trader, David Zatz, wasn't
found guilty on any of the charges against him. The jury was
deadlocked on 86 counts against the three traders.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The jury's unwillingness to convict any of the traders on
fraud charges, or to find Mr. Mosky, a floor broker, guilty
of racketeering conspiracy, was widely seen as a blow to the
government's multimillion-dollar trading probe.</p>
<p>The government said it would modify the indictments
against the traders, and defense attorneys said they would
move to have the charges dismissed.</p>
<p>Two more trials of indicted futures traders are scheduled
to begin in September.</p>
