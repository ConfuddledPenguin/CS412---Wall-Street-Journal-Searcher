	<p class="article-leader">Unionized workers at Alcan Aluminium Ltd.'s smelter in
Kitimat, British Columbia, approved a revised three-year
contract proposal, ending a strike that began at midnight PDT
Monday.
   The revised accord, which follows a proposal that was
rejected Wednesday, calls for annual wage increases of 6%, an
immediate signing bonus of 1,750 Canadian dollars (US$1,517)
per worker, and inflation-indexed payments in the second and
third years of the pact, Alcan's spokesman said.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The Montreal-based aluminum maker's original offer also
provided for 6% annual wage increases, though the signing
bonus was C$250 less for each worker, and inflation-indexed
payments were to occur only in the third year of the pact.</p>
<p>The Kitimat smelter, which produces about 260,000 metric
tons of aluminum ingots annually, accounts for about 18% of
Alcan's total primary aluminum capacity. It is expected to
lose only minimal output as a result of the short strike,
Alcan's spokesman said.</p>
<p>Management workers have kept most of the smelter running
normally since the strike by 1,600 members of the Canadian
Association of Smelter and Allied Workers began.</p>
<p>In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday,
Alcan closed at $23.75 a share, up 12.5 cents.</p>
