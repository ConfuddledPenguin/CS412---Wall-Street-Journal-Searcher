	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- The New York Stock Exchange barred for five
years a broker who, it charged, bounced checks on two
brokerage firms and misstated information on
securities-industry forms required for employment.
   The exchange also charged that William F. Falbo Sr. of
Palatine, Ill., violated rules regarding margin, or credit.
In addition to the five-year bar from membership, Mr. Falbo
was fined $10,000. Mr. Falbo, who denied the charges in a
letter to the exchange, couldn't be reached for comment. He
no longer is employed in the securities industry, the Big
Board said.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The case points up the difficulty brokerage firms and
regulators have in checking the backgrounds of potential
employees.</p>
<p>The exchange said that in 1985 and 1986, Mr. Falbo, while
employed at Merrill Lynch & Co., wrote five personal checks,
totaling nearly $30,000, and deposited them in an account at
Merrill. The checks were returned for insufficient funds.</p>
<p>The Big Board also said Mr. Falbo bought stock-index
options while he had insufficient funds in his securities
account to pay for them. Merrill notified the exchange that
the broker was discharged from the firm May 20, 1986; Merrill
said he had permitted overdrafts and abused check-writing
privileges.</p>
<p>On June 2, 1986, Mr. Falbo joined A.G. Edwards & Sons
Inc., allegedly failing to report his discharge by Merrill
Lynch. In June and July 1986, he bought stock-index options
with insufficient funds in his Edwards account to pay for
them, the exchange said.</p>
<p>On July 8, the exchange added, he deposited a $5,000 check
into his Edwards account; the check was returned to Edwards
on July 15 for lack of sufficient funds. Edwards redeposited
the check on Mr. Falbo's request; the broker stopped payment
on the check July 22.</p>
<p>Edwards, which sustained a $7,431 loss on the options
transactions, discharged Mr. Falbo July 9 for failing to
disclose a reportable item on his application and for
violating margin rules, the exchange said.</p>
<p>Mr. Falbo joined First of Michigan Corp. in September
1987, allegedly failing to tell the firm that the previous
February he had pleaded guilty in state court in Illinois to
a misdemeanor involving issuance of a check with insufficient
funds. He also failed to disclose that two judgments A.G.
Edwards won against him were outstanding. He voluntarily
resigned from First of Michigan in January 1988, the exchange
said.</p>
<p>The exchange also said Mr. Falbo has declined to cooperate
with its inquiries about his termination from Merrill Lynch.
But in a January 1987 letter to the Big Board, Mr. Falbo
denied Merrill Lynch's assertions and said those assertions
led A.G. Edwards to dismiss him.</p>
