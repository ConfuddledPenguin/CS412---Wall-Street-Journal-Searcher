	<p class="article-leader">As the current inning in the long-running game called the
budget process reaches its climax, many in Washington are
betting that the congressional Democrats are about to make a
double play. Getting George Bush to move his lips on taxes
was their first out. Stopping him from moving them on capital
gains tax reduction could be the second.
   Senate majority leader George Mitchell had insisted that
any change in the capital gains tax rate must be paired with
a new top rate of 33% for higher income taxpayers, bursting
the so-called bubble. House Republicans have said that they
would wash their hands of such a deal. A number, led by Rep.
Vin Weber (R., Minn.), are ready to walk out on any budget
deal that fails to include action on capital gains.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>But without fanfare in the press, Sen. Mitchell has begun
to retreat from his demand. At the same time, some summiteers
have begun informally exploring alternatives to the
president's tax cut proposal -- alternatives that they hope
might be acceptable to the White House and perhaps even win
over the House Republicans, despite Mr. Weber's tough line.</p>
<p>The president's plan would effectively cut the capital
gains rate to 19.6% after three years, by excluding 10% of
gains in the first year, 20% in the second and 30% in the
third. Mr. Bush argues that this cut would, among other
desirable things, compensate investors for the inflation
built into the appreciation of asset prices.</p>
<p>Opponents of the cut and now some summiteers have asked,
why not take the president's reasoning to its logical
conclusion? Why not simply index capital gains to the rate of
inflation instead? If inflation has totaled 15% over the time
someone held a $100 asset, tax the gain on the asset as if
the purchase price had been $115.</p>
<p>On its face, indexation appears to be a fine idea.
Indexing business-related taxes was the one element of the
1986 tax reform proposal that Congress didn't pass. Indexing
capital gains would put an end to one of the principal risks
of investing the danger of paying hefty taxes on non-existent
real gains or even losses, without reopening such settled
issues of tax reform as rates on personal income. It would
remedy something that liberals as well as conservatives
regard as a serious flaw in our current tax system.</p>
<p>Because of its obvious fairness, indexing doesn't call
forth the class warfare style of opposition that a straight
capital gains cut does. Some prominent conservatives support
it over the Bush proposal for just that reason. They see
indexing as an achievable way to reduce taxes on capital
gains, one that even dedicated adversaries of the Bush plan
will favor. That means, they believe, giving up less and
perhaps nothing at all to get it. As one advocate says, if
Mr. Bush had endorsed indexing last year, it would be enacted
by now.</p>
<p>The problem is that -- as happens so often when taxes are
the issue -- different people mean different things by
indexing. Full indexing would permit losses on one asset to
offset gains on another and for a portfolio with nominal
gains to show real losses. But full indexing, which many
conservatives appear to assume the Democrats are talking
about, does not command active liberal support and has no
prospect of getting a serious hearing in Congress. No one in
Washington has suggested that indexed valuations be allowed
to drop below zero. Under proposals being discussed, if that
asset with the indexed purchase price of $115 were sold for
$110, the investor couldn't show a $5 loss, just a wash.</p>
<p>Investors with real losses for their portfolios would thus
still pay taxes on phantom gains. Among other things,
"quarter indexing," as some call this treatment, is far less
expensive to the government than full indexing, which all
agree would produce a big drop in federal revenue, even
accounting for its stimulative effect on the economy.</p>
<p>Opponents of the Bush proposal refer to calculations of
what a dollar would be worth after a number of years if: a)
it is invested this year, b) produces a steady annual return,
c) all returns on that investment are reinvested without
paying the 28% personal income tax until d) the asset with
its compound returns is finally sold. Looked at this way, the
Bush proposal can be made to seem a minor boost to the
economy compared to indexing.</p>
<p>But this analysis describes a limited group of companies.
Only mature or stagnating companies produce smooth,
predictable earnings that compound at roughly the same rate,
year in, year out. New and growing businesses have different
profiles. Early investors pay prices that reflect not only
the returns that they hope the business will produce but
their doubts that it will produce any at all. Within a few
years, a company may still have little or no profits even
though it has taken a large share of a growing market. It
looks like a surer deal, however, and so the stock price
climbs rapidly, not because of rising earnings but declining
risk.</p>
<p>For this kind of company -- the kind that in large measure
has driven the current expansion and is driving virtually all
expanding economies around the world -- the Bush proposal
will have a markedly greater impact than quarter-indexing.
Simply put: the greater the capital appreciation of an
investment in its first six years -- the normal horizon for
seed capital investments -- the more powerful the incentives
in the Bush proposal.</p>
<p>Two issues have underpinned the now decade-long tax
contest in Washington: first, will there be a cap on the
proportion of the economy that the government takes; and
second, should policy be designed to free the economy's
dynamic and creative elements or to protect the threatened
and declining ones, even at the expense of growth?</p>
<p>If the budget summit does indeed produce higher taxes,
particularly without real reforms in the budget process and
concessions on entitlements, congressional Democrats will
have tagged out the administration on limiting the
government's take. If the summit also blocks the cutting of
the capital gains tax rate, they will have stopped the most
powerful recent initiative for advancement of the growth
agenda. While indexing -- even quarter indexing -- might be
better than nothing, it would still represent a setback on
this agenda.</p>
<p>President Bush has now stepped up to bat. The old Yale
first base man may yet hit a home run -- and even a single
that advances all runners will do. But right now the betting
is heavy on the Democrats' team from the Hill.</p>
