	<p class="article-leader">Cigna Corp., Philadelphia, said it no longer plans to sell
its individual financial services division, which had been on
the block for the past 18 months.
   Cigna said that while there had been several interested
buyers for the division -- including a group that would have
involved some management members -- none matched the price
that the company was seeking. Also, financing, which might
have included high-yield bonds, became harder to arrange
during this time.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The division markets individual life and disability
insurance. It also markets investment products and financial
planning to small business owners, high net-worth individuals
and corporations. In the last few years, Cigna has been
working to position itself as a seller of commercial
property/casualty and group health insurance to major
corporations.</p>
<p>Wilson H. Taylor, Cigna's chairman and chief executive
officer, said, "The outlook for the life and disability
business has improved," due to market changes, as well as
steps taken internally to improve the division's operations.
He added that the division's 1989 results were strong,
posting a more than 15% return on equity, and its 1990
performance suggests continued good results.</p>
