	<p class="article-leader">Peter Ackerman, a former high-ranking Drexel Burnham
Lambert Inc. official, has become the subject of a new
government inquiry into possible stock-price manipulation,
according to individuals familiar with the investigation.
   Although Drexel is now under the supervision of a federal
Bankruptcy Court, the government continues to study possible
wrongdoing among ex-lieutenants to former Drexel junk-bond
chief Michael Milken, who awaits sentencing after pleading
guilty to securities-law violations.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The investigation of Mr. Ackerman relates to possible
manipulation of the price of Brintec Corp. common for the
benefit of a Drexel employee partnership in April 1986.</p>
<p>According to individuals familiar with the matter, former
Drexel trader Peter Gardiner linked Mr. Ackerman, once the
top deputy of Michael Milken, to the alleged price
manipulation. As Drexel's most powerful corporate finance
official, Mr. Ackerman was one of the securities firm's top
earners; former Drexel insiders say his compensation package
for 1988 totaled more than $45 million.</p>
<p>Individuals familiar with the investigation emphasized
that it is still in the early stages and that no "target
letter" has been issued indicating that Mr. Ackerman is
likely to be indicted. Mr. Ackerman's lawyer, Paul Grand,
said, "This does not amount to anything more than unfounded
rumors and gossip, and I don't comment on rumors and gossip."
Mr. Ackerman, who now lives in London, couldn't be reached.</p>
<p>Mr. Gardiner, who traded convertible bonds, is said to
have told the government that Mr. Ackerman engineered a
run-up in the price of Brintec common stock prior to the
offering of 1,350,000 shares by certain Brintec shareholders
in April 1986. Drexel helped to underwrite that offering, and
Moredon Partners Ltd., a Drexel-sponsored partnership that
owned 13.3% of Brintec's shares before the offering, was the
largest seller.</p>
<p>Mr. Gardiner is said to have alleged that Mr. Ackerman
directed him to arrange to have at least one Drexel client
purchase large chunks of Brintec's shares in the days before
the secondary offering in order to boost Brintec's stock
price at the time of the offering.</p>
<p>Brintec, a Willimantic, Conn., maker of electronic cables,
was acquired last year by BICC PLC, a British cable concern,
for $14.75 a share, or $177 million. Moredon is understood to
have sold its remaining 10% stake in connection with that
offer.</p>
<p>Brintec, whose stock was sold on the over-the-counter
market, had traded as low as $14.50 in the weeks prior to the
offering. But several days before the offering was set to
occur, the price shot up to $20 a share, and the offering was
priced at $19.50. Brintec's share price began to tumble back
to the earlier level in the days following the offering.</p>
<p>Mr. Gardiner is understood to have made his allegations in
a so-called proffer to the government. A proffer is an
offering of information that an individual makes when the
government is considering a grant of immunity or a
plea-bargain agreement. Prosecutors are understood to be
negotiating a deal with Mr. Gardiner's attorneys that would
give Mr. Gardiner immunity from prosecution in exchange for
his testimony. That deal is expected to be completed soon,
individuals familiar with the negotiations said.</p>
<p>Mr. Gardiner left Drexel in 1987 and is now a doctoral
student in political science at Columbia University. The
Justice Department had given prosecutors approval to bring
racketeering charges against him earlier this year, according
to people familiar with the investigation. His attorney,
Henry W. Asbill, didn't return phone calls seeking comment
yesterday.</p>
<p>According to a prospectus for the stock offering, Moredon
Partners consisted of "two general partners and limited
partners consisting of an officer, certain other employees
and two former employees" of Drexel. Mr. Ackerman was one of
the partners, according to individuals familiar with the
government's inquiry.</p>
<p>Moredon owned a total of 1.6 million shares of Brintec
prior to the offering and had an agreement to sell 215,292 in
connection with the offering. Moredon was also granted an
overallotment option to sell 202,500 additional shares. That
option was exercised, resulting in the sale by Moredon of
417,792 shares. Moredon is understood to have purchased the
shares at prices substantially below $19.50.</p>
<p>The stock offering was accompanied by a concurrent
offering of $50 million of convertible debentures, which
Drexel underwrote. The higher stock price allowed for a
higher conversion price.</p>
<p>Mr. Ackerman, now 43 years old, was until earlier this
year director of international capital market services at
Drexel, which made him responsible for developing the firm's
global junk-bond sales effort and international investment
banking activities.</p>
<p>Mr. Ackerman started at Drexel in 1973 and was invited by
Mr. Milken in 1978 to join Drexel's junk-bond headquarters,
which eventually moved to Beverly Hills, Calif.</p>
<p>Mr. Ackerman worked closely with Mr. Milken and other
junk-bond traders and salesmen in Beverly Hills, as well as
with Drexel's corporate finance department. One of Drexel's
top business-getters, Mr. Ackerman played a key role in
structuring the various junk-bond financings that were sold
by Mr. Milken and his assistants.</p>
<p>Last September, Mr. Ackerman moved to London, where the
company said at the time that he would investigate business
opportunities for Drexel in Europe. But Mr. Ackerman -- who
has a Ph.D. in international politics -- has spent much of
his time there co-authoring a book on nonviolent political
resistance.</p>
