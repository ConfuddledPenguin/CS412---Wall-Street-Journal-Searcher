	<p class="article-leader">The June 25 article "King Hussein Fears Mideast Strife
Could Flare Into War, Chides U.S" by Karen Elliott House and
Geraldine Brooks is a further example of royal disinformation
and majestic misconceptions. If we assume that the king has
not forgotten his ill-fated military alliance in 1967 with
Egypt and Syria (despite clear messages from Israel that if
he stayed out of the hostilities not an inch of the
territories he then controlled would be touched) and the
demagogy of the Arab leadership that succeeded in convincing
itself of Israel's imminent demise, surely this "longtime
U.S. ally and Arab moderate" should not resort to such
provocative history-twisting remarks.
   It should be noted that, as in 1967, there is no
warmongering on the Israeli side. We are indeed involved with
the great event of Jewish immigration, mainly from the Soviet
Union, and the immigrants' successful absorption into our
free society. Peace is, therefore, our basic and absolute
need and desire. We have never taken a belligerent attitude
toward those who have accepted our presence. If "the region
is approaching the same state of hair-trigger tension," such
tension comes from the king's best friend and ally -- the
Iraqi president, Saddam Hussein.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Combine this with the recent announcement of the setting
up of a joint Iraqi-Jordanian air squadron and other joint
military maneuvers between these two countries and one can
perhaps begin to understand which path the king has started
to tread.</p>
<p>"With a photo of the Iraqi president just behind his {King
Hussein's} shoulder," the U.S. and the entire world should
recall that old adage: Tell me who your friends are and I'll
tell you who you are. Your majesty, take down that picture of
Saddam Hussein and replace it with that of Anwar Sadat. This
would symbolize a much more fruitful expression of your
concern for the future welfare of your people and the entire
Middle East.</p>

<p>---</p>
<p>Since its establishment in 1948, Israel has been trying to
reach a comprehensive peace agreement with its Arab
neighbors. In contrast, 20 Arab countries have refused to
negotiate with or recognize Israel.</p>
<p>The 1967 war into which Israel was pulled saw Israelis at
a moment of fear, despair and extreme anxiety for their fate.
Arab countries, on the other side, coordinated their
aggression toward Israel by closing vital water channels,
mobilizing their armies and threatening Israel for months
before the war. Israel has never talked of starting a war. As
to the Arabs, historical documents and speeches attest to
belligerent statements made by Gamal Abdel Nasser (then
president of Egypt) and King Hussein of Jordan right before
the 1967 war. King Hussein must be a hypocrite to say that
the Arabs "fell into a trap." He should read his own 1967
speeches, to remember how he predicted the Israelis would be
pushed into the sea.</p>
<p>King Hussein's preoccupations are not the poor Jewish
immigrants who are only trying to escape anti-Semitic
beatings and who plan to live in peace. Since practically
none want to settle in the territories, Soviet immigrants
pose no danger to Arabs who search for peace. They pose an
obstacle only to those who dream of destroying the Jewish
state.</p>
<p>King Hussein is acting out of self-fear. The land where he
"reigns" is about 70% Palestinian (not 50% as your reporters
write), and he realizes that the Palestinian people are
growing unhappy with his authoritative regime.</p>
<p>What is the true formula for disaster? King Hussein's
instability, and his desperate alliance with Saddam Hussein,
the butcher of Iraq.</p>
<p>Daniel Lubetzky</p>

<p>---</p>
<p>King Hussein of Jordan is at it again. As he has done in
the past, he rewrites history, blames Israel and the U.S. for
Middle East problems, conjures up irrational fears that
Israel will expel the Palestinians from the territories, and
refuses to accept his own responsibility for continuing
conflict in the region.</p>
<p>He has the gall to say that Israel lured the Arabs into
the 1967 war. Arab aggression against Israel was a constant
since the Jewish state's creation in 1948 and reached a high
point in 1967, including Egypt's closure of the Straits of
Tiran, Syria's massing of troops and Jordan's attack on
Israel despite Israeli pleas to King Hussein to stay out of
the war. King Hussein knows his decision to attack was a
historic blunder; rather than face up to that fact, he
continues to blame the party he attacked, which had the nerve
to defend itself and win the war.</p>
<p>As usual, the king criticizes U.S. support for Israel and
suggests that such support could lead the region to war. He
omits to say that the U.S. continues to be a staunch ally of
the king and that if there is a threat of war in the region
it comes from the bellicosity of Iraq's leader Saddam Hussein
and the massing of ever-more-sophisticated arms -- missiles,
chemical and biological weapons -- by the Arab world.</p>
<p>King Hussein conveniently ignores the fact that, after all
these years, he still has not recognized Israel, established
relations or moved toward peace. His words indicate that he
isn't quite the moderate that he is widely perceived to be.</p>
