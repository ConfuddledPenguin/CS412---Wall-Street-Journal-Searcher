	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- U.S. trade officials warned that a "big
fight" with the European Community could ensue if the EC
continues to hold up a global agreement to phase out billions
of dollars in agricultural subsidies.
   The officials were reacting to the failure of a key
negotiating session in Geneva to produce a "framework
agreement" on reducing these subsidies as agreed upon at the
international economic summit earlier this month in Houston.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>This week's meeting, held under the auspices of the
General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, also failed to
resolve differences between the U.S. and other countries on
how to craft other agreements, including those on investment
flows and on the textile and services trades.</p>
<p>EC officials said, however, that there weren't any grounds
for the U.S. to be "unduly pessimistic," claiming that there
has been progress even in the agriculture sector. The U.S.
has argued that the EC's unwillingness to scrap farm
subsidies as fast as the U.S. wants has been a major obstacle
to the success of the four-year round of talks which ends in
December.</p>
