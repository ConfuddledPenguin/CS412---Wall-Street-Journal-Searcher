	<p class="article-leader">BASEL, Switzerland -- Ciba-Geigy AG went out of its way to
satisfy environmentalists.
   The Swiss chemical giant more than doubled its
anti-pollution spending last year to 1.3 billion Swiss francs
($935 million). Chairman Alex Krauer opened company factories
to public visits, installed a hotline to reassure worried
neighbors and declared himself ready for dialogue. When
Greenpeace activists climbed a company smokestack, Mr. Krauer
invited the trespassers to his office for coffee and cake.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>But today, Ciba-Geigy finds itself under attack from the
same environmentalists it tried to woo. Stiff opposition has
foiled its plans to build a biotechnology research institute
and a waste incinerator. An angered Mr. Krauer has begun
threatening to move the company's headquarters out of
Switzerland.</p>
<p>"There are days where you are just fed up," laments Urs
Gujer, the company's vice president for environmental
affairs. "We tried to do the right thing. We consulted with
everybody, we picked the most environmentally sound projects,
the ones which would leave the least contamination -- and
look what happens."</p>
<p>Throughout Europe, companies of all kinds are rushing to
respond to stricter legislation and increased public concern
about the environment -- only to confront an obstacle course
of often contradictory choices. Chemical producers typically
find themselves on the front lines in this battle. No matter
how great an effort they make, it seems, they can't shake
their reputation as polluters and sources of serious
accidents.</p>
<p>Here at the home of Switzerland's three large chemical
companies, the environmentalists attacking Ciba-Geigy compare
its cleanup efforts favorably with those of its neighbors,
Sandoz Ltd. and F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd. But as Ciba-Geigy's
experiences illustrate, efforts aimed at showing sensitivity
to environmental concerns can sometimes bring not only praise
but also added scrutiny and criticism.</p>
<p>"It's terrible to say, but if they had just gone ahead
with their two projects without saying anything, they
probably never would have faced any problems," says Guy
Morin, an independent member of the local Basel legislature.</p>
<p>Dealing with the environment poses delicate questions
about finance as well as about politics and public image.
"Environmentally safe growth will be one of the big issues of
the 1990s," says Sumantra Ghoshal of the INSEAD business
school in Fontainebleau, France. "The question is whether
it's better to spend $100 million on a new plant to reduce
pollution and please the `greenies' or forgo the expense and
please the stock analysts."</p>
<p>Public sentiment often demands that businesses face up to
this question. For this sedate Swiss city of 200,000 people,
where the chemical factories' smokestacks tower over medieval
half-timbered houses, the real awakening came Nov. 1, 1986,
when a devastating fire broke out at the Sandoz warehouse in
nearby Schweizerhalle. By the time the blaze subsided, more
than 30 tons of mercury and pesticides had poured into the
Rhine River.</p>
<p>Since the disaster, all three of Basel's chemical giants
have increased anti-pollution spending, to the point where
safety and environmental-protection costs now account for
more than one-fifth of their total outlays.</p>
<p>At Schweizerhalle, for example, Sandoz is spending 40
million Swiss francs to build a 1,250-square-meter
(13,500-square-foot) water-retention basin. Now, water used
to fight a chemical fire wouldn't spill directly into the
nearby Rhine, carrying pollutants with it; instead, the water
would be caught in the basin and purified before being
discharged.</p>
<p>"You have to be ahead of the laws to show people you
really care," explains Armin Hofstetter of Hoffmann-La
Roche's Sisseln plant, where a $17 million water-retention
and cleaning system has just become operational. "We're proud
to say that the water we send back into the Rhine is cleaner
than the water we take out."</p>
<p>Although all three Swiss chemical companies are taking
more precautions, their efforts are perceived differently by
the public. Ciba-Geigy has been widely praised for being
open, forthright and friendly, while environmentalists
criticize rival Sandoz for being closed, secretive and
antagonistic. Hoffmann-La Roche tries to keep a low profile,
emphasizing how it produces mostly drugs, not chemicals.</p>
<p>These differing public images stem, in large part, from
the personalities of the chief executives. Ciba-Geigy's Mr.
Krauer is a popular hometown personality who participates in
many Basel activities and impresses locals as a warm and
generous man. Sandoz is led by Marc Moret, a businessman from
Fribourg in the French-speaking section of Switzerland. Mr.
Moret is uncomfortable speaking German in public and spends
most of his free time out of town.</p>
<p>"Whenever I see Krauer in public, he seems to care, to
want dialogue," says Jorg Stochlin, a Green Party member of
the local parliament. "Moret, in comparison, is stiff and
silent."</p>
<p>Ciba-Geigy managers have been authorized to take personal
initiatives in dealing with environmental issues. Werner
Rothweiler recounts how he stopped production of a red dye
used in automobile lacquers, overruling pleas of marketing
executives.</p>
<p>"The stuff was so loaded with sulfur that it would have
cost a fortune to treat the waste," Mr. Rothweiler explains.
"Marketing people said: `But it's so beautiful. What will our
customers say?' I told them, `You shouldn't only think in
terms of turnover and profit.'" Reassuring the public is
another Ciba-Geigy priority. Hans-Rudolf Hitz, the
environmental-safety director at the company's Basel plant,
explains how he started a monthly newspaper to inform locals
of factory plans.</p>
<p>In contrast, Sandoz managers take a much dimmer view of
environmental protests. Company officials, for example,
turned away the uninvited Greenpeace guests. "They just
showed up and demanded to see me," says Hans Winkler, the
company's executive in charge of environmental matters. "We
are busy businessmen."</p>
<p>Such attitudes have soured Sandoz's relations with local
residents, but so far the company has remained almost immune
to attacks by environmentalists. When activists recently
tried to oppose the construction of a laboratory where work
is now done on a drug called Sandimun, executives threatened
to move their investment overseas -- along with the jobs it
represented. The complaints were quickly dropped.</p>
<p>Ciba-Geigy's cooperative attitude, by contrast, has
resulted in protracted litigation for the company. In 1987,
it requested a building permit for an $80 million incinerator
to burn toxic wastes. Instead of shipping the waste abroad --
a dangerous and politically unacceptable process -- the
project would permit the company to dispose the waste at
home. An environmental-impact study was carried out, and
Swiss authorities approved the project.</p>
<p>"We took the lead on the issue, because we thought this
was the most responsible position," says Mr. Gujer, the
project's director. "It was part of our strategy of saying,
`OK, we have a problem. Let's deal with it.'"</p>
<p>Worried residents, both at home and in neighboring West
Germany, saw only the problem. They hired Reinhold Zweidler,
a lawyer active in environmental affairs. He criticizes the
incinerator's "outdated" technology and its planned location,
near populated neighborhoods. Ciba-Geigy, which responds that
the incinerator needs to be placed near production sites, has
held public meetings with neighborhood residents to get its
point across.</p>
<p>Last December, city officials dismissed the critics'
complaints. Mr. Zweidler appealed the decision and says he
will take the case all the way to the Swiss Supreme Court. He
concedes that he will probably lose, but adds that the entire
process could take three or four years. That delay annoys
Ciba-Geigy officials. "The critics have no credible
alternative," Mr. Rothweiler complains. "All they want is to
drag it out so long as to cause us problems."</p>
<p>Nevertheless, Ciba-Geigy officials insist that they will
stick to their policy of dialogue and openness. "We're not at
the end of the day yet," says Gottfried Eigenmann,
Ciba-Geigy's director of environmental affairs. In the long
run, "a company which is reckless with the environment will
pay."</p>
