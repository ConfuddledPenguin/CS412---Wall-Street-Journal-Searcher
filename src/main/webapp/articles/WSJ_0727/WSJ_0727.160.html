	<p class="article-leader">DALLAS -- Mary Kay Corp. is seeking to refinance about
$172 million of the debt it took on to go private in a
leveraged buy-out five years ago.
   The company said it is "actively exploring" the
possibility of acquiring a "substantial amount" of the
publicly traded, 15% deep-discount debentures it has
outstanding and will seek amended terms on the remainder. The
refinancing is intended to lower the cosmetics company's debt
costs and ease some operating restrictions that came along
with the borrowing.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>This fall, the company must start calling some of those
bonds at a cost of nearly $25 million a year, said a person
familiar with the company's refinancing plans. Because of
that, he said, company officials considered it an appropriate
time to refinance at a lower rate.</p>
<p>First Boston Corp. has been retained by Mary Kay as an
adviser on the refinancing.</p>
<p>A spokesman for the company said the refinancing isn't
related to the option Mary Kay holds to acquire 1.2 million
shares of Avon Products Inc. from financier Irwin Jacobs and
Amway Corp. The company has a 45-day option, which began July
5, the spokesman said, but can be extended.</p>
<p>Mary Kay owns a 25% stake in Chartwell Associates Limited
Partnership, which in turn is Avon's largest holder. If Mary
Kay, or another Chartwell partner buys the 1.2 million-share
block, the group would then control 19.8% of Avon's voting
shares.</p>
<p>Although the company could exercise the option without the
refinancing, said the person familiar with Mary Kay's plans,
transactions of that nature would be easier, both because of
the anticipated easing of some operating restrictions and
because of the improved balance sheet. For the time being, he
said, any takeover ambitions on Chartwell's part have been
stymied by Avon's anti-takeover defenses, which are triggered
when a potential suitor acquires more than 20% of the
company's stock.</p>
<p>Mary Kay has been portrayed as an LBO that worked. The
company, with its huge sales force, has doubled its operating
cash flow since the leveraged buy-out and has nearly doubled
its sales. In 1989, the company spokesman said, sales were
more than $450 million, up from $255 million in 1986;
operating cash flow has risen in that time to $72 million
from $35 million. The spokesman said that Mary Kay's sales
force also grew in that time, to nearly 200,000 from 140,000.</p>
<p>In a leveraged buy-out, a small group of investors
acquires a company in a transaction financed largely by
borrowing. Ultimately, the debt is paid with funds generated
by the acquired company's operations or sale of its assets.</p>
