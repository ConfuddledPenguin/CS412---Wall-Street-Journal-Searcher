	<p class="article-leader">SYDNEY, Australia -- Rupert Murdoch's News Corp. is
nearing the time when it customarily raises the value of its
assets, an exercise that supported acquisitions in its
empire-building past. Now, however, that revaluation practice
is part of the debt-laden media giant's efforts to shore up
its finances.
   Every three years, News Corp. revalues its publishing
rights, television licenses and titles. Analysts who track
the company expect it to write up the value of some of its
assets by a total of about 1 billion Australian dollars
(US$797.5 million). That's roughly the same Australian dollar
increase as in the 1987 revaluation, though because the base
amounts have grown, the expected write-up translates into a
smaller percentage increase in shareholders' equity.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Richard Sarazen, a News Corp. director, says the
revaluation "is a policy we established six or seven years
ago." The company has been particularly tight-lipped about
the size of the latest planned revaluation, and Mr. Sarazen
declines to comment beyond saying, "We won't know the final
numbers until mid-August," when News Corp. will release
results for its 1990 financial year, ended June 30.</p>
<p>In the past, the revaluation helped fuel the company's
rapid, debt-financed global expansion, often to the
disadvantage of U.S. competitors, who must adhere to stricter
accounting standards. Although most of News Corp.'s assets
are outside Australia, under Australian accounting rules the
company can periodically write up the value of certain assets
if its directors think the assets are worth more than the
purchase price. That practice, in turn, increases holders'
equity -- and News Corp.'s borrowing power.</p>
<p>These days, though, the company, which is off the
acquisition trail, is depending on the revaluation as a
defensive tactic to reduce its leverage. Despite a flurry of
asset sales since March to further that reduction, the
company's debt is estimated to have ballooned to A$9 billion
from A$5.4 billion in 1988. The estimate excludes preference
shares that if counted as debt would raise the total to about
A$10 billion. And it doesn't take into account any financial
liability News Corp. might bear for its 50%-owned domestic
airline, Ansett Transport Industries Ltd., or its
joint-venture aircraft-leasing company, Ansett Worldwide
Aviation Services.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Mr. Murdoch could be forced to write down
certain of his U.S. assets, some analysts warn. And in
Australia, relatively high domestic interest rates are
putting pressure on asset values. The Australian government
also is maintaining a hard line on foreign ownership of the
country's newspapers, which could hold down the value of
those assets.</p>
<p>In broadcast media, the government recently restricted
foreign ownership to 15% by any one party and a 20% total for
any company, but Australia hasn't any such legislated policy
on newspapers. However, a spokesman for Treasurer Paul
Keating, who is the final arbiter on foreign investment, says
the government intends to hold total foreign ownership in any
Australian newspaper below 15%.</p>
<p>The Labor Party government of Prime Minister Bob Hawke has
spurned several overtures from foreigners who want to take
big stakes in local newspapers. The latest rebuff came in
June when British publisher Robert Maxwell proposed to
acquire 49% of the daily West Australian in Perth.</p>
<p>Mr. Murdoch controls News Corp., which accounts for about
60% of Australia's newspaper sales. The Australia-born
entrepreneur changed his citizenship to American in 1985 to
comply with U.S. television-ownership rules. But Mr. Hawke
says Mr. Murdoch, the son of one of Australia's most famous
reporters, is a special case because he "started off as an
Aussie" and isn't considered a foreigner.</p>
<p>Mr. Sarazen discounts the potential impact of foreign
ownership limits on News Corp.'s Australian media assets. But
analysts and bankers, who say the limits could make it more
difficult to write up those assets in the future, raise the
specter that their current value could be eroded.</p>
<p>Restricting newspaper ownership "will rule out a lot of
buyers," says Viktor Shvets, who tracks News Corp. for Baring
Securities Ltd. Consequently, he says, "It will have a
detrimental impact on the value of the asset backing."</p>
<p>Moreover, Mr. Shvets says News Corp. could come under
pressure to write down some of its investment in Triangle
Publications Inc., a U.S. publisher whose crown jewel is TV
Guide. In 1988, News Corp. paid US$3 billion for Triangle
Publications, a figure Mr. Shvets thinks was much too high.</p>
<p>Based on analysts' projections, if News Corp. revalues its
assets by A$1 billion, that will increase shareholders'
equity by less than 15%, to A$8.2 billion, excluding
preference shares; that compares with 1987's revaluation that
increased shareholders' equity by 25%, to A$4.9 billion.</p>
<p>George Batsakis, an analyst at the Melbourne brokerage
firm J.B. Were & Son, is looking for an increase on asset
valuations, including News Corp.'s Fox Broadcasting Co. and
Fox TV stations in the U.S. and at Herald & Weekly Times
Ltd., an Australian newspaper company that News Corp.
acquired in 1987 for A$2.3 billion.</p>
<p>News Corp. has raised about A$1 billion from asset sales
since March, including the sale of 49% of its Hong Kong-based
South China Morning Post newspaper. But News Corp. also had
to bring its book-publishing arm, Harper Collins Publishers
Inc. -- and its estimated A$700 million debt -- onto its
books during the year ended June 30.</p>
<p>According to Baring Securities estimates, News Corp. ended
its 1990 financial year with debt of A$9 billion and total
equity of A$9.5 billion, including A$1.2 billion in
convertible notes and A$1.3 billion in preference shares.
That gives News Corp. a debt-to-equity ratio of 0.95 to 1,
well below the 1.1 to 1 that News Corp.'s bank lenders
stipulate must exist every year on June 30.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, some analysts are slashing their earnings
forecasts on News Corp. Last month, investment bank Morgan
Stanley & Co. cut its 1990 earnings estimate after tax, but
before extraordinary items, to A$215 million, or 76
Australian cents a share, from A$250 million, or 86 cents a
share. News Corp. earned A$496 million, or A$1.58 a share, in
the year ended June 30, 1989.</p>
<p>Carla Bakker, the investment bank's London-based analyst,
still has a buy recommendation on the stock, but she is
cutting her estimates mainly because of "lower earnings than
expected in the U.S., due to the slowdown in advertising
growth which is affecting the company's magazines, newspapers
and TV stations."</p>
<p>While she says the overall outlook on News Corp. is
"promising," she also trimmed her profit estimates for fiscal
1991 to A$490 million, or A$1.56 a share, from A$510 million,
or A$1.62 a share.</p>
<p>J.B. Were's Mr. Batsakis is looking for an estimated A$250
million, or 84 cents a share, for the year just ended and
A$390 million, or A$1.21 a share, next year. With News
Corp.'s share price climbing above A$12, Baring Securities
says the stock is "a little expensive." In the currently
tight international credit environment, News Corp. is faced
with selling assets to finance its funding commitments, but
the cash-flow base will expand to meet those needs if the
company "can buy itself a grace period of 12 to 18 months,"
Baring said in a recent report.</p>
<p>Still, Baring's Mr. Shvets expects News Corp. to "emerge
in the next two years as a much leaner and more concentrated
vehicle, with greater emphasis on the broadcasting side of
the business" including Sky Television, the company's
fledgling British satellite-TV service. Mr. Murdoch now says
Sky TV should break even by late 1991 or early 1992.</p>
