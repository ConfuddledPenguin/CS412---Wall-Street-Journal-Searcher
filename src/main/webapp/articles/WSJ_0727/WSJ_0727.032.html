	<p class="article-leader">DETROIT -- General Motors Corp. said it will idle 11 U.S.
assembly plants next week and in August to retool for 1991
models.
   The GM plant that builds the Buick Reatta will be shut
five weeks, the longest of the shutdowns. Most of the other
shutdowns will last one to three weeks.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Chrysler Corp. said it will idle the St. Louis assembly
plant that builds its long wheelbase minivans for four weeks
beginning Monday to retool for a major model change. Chrysler
also has added one week to the shutdown at its Jeep factory
in Toledo, Ohio, because of a "parts shortage." The plant was
originally scheduled to reopen July 30.</p>
<p>Ford Motor Co. said it is planning daily overtime at its
car assembly plants in Wixom and Wayne, Mich. The No. 2 auto
maker has scheduled Saturday overtime at truck plants in Twin
Cities, Minn., Louisville, Ky., and St. Louis.</p>
<p>The 10 major domestic auto makers planned to build 86,516
cars this week, up 2.6% from the 84,312 built a year earlier.</p>
