	<p class="article-leader">International Business Machines Corp. named a small health
care company to handle its mental health program, reflecting
corporate America's search for ways to contain spiraling
psychiatric costs.
   The computer giant picked American PsychManagement to set
up a network of 10,000 psychiatrists, psychologists and
social workers, as well as hospitals and other treatment
centers, to serve IBM's 700,000 U.S. employees, retirees and
dependents.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The move to separate mental health and substance abuse
benefits from other health benefits reflects an emerging
trend among companies that have found psychiatric costs
particularly troublesome in the battle to contain overall
health costs.</p>
<p>IBM is the latest company to arrange for a network of
preferred health care providers and encourage employees
through financial incentives to use them. The networks are
intended to enable companies to manage better their
employees' use of health services and to obtain discounts
from doctors and hospitals in return for a designated flow of
patients. Last week, American Telephone & Telegraph Co.
announced the establishment of a system of networks covering
all health care for its U.S. work force.</p>
<p>More and more companies say that "the only way we are
really going to be able to offer health benefits is if we
manage them well," said Veronica Vaccaro, manager of mental
health promotion at the Washington Business Group on Health.</p>
<p>Although terms of IBM's move into managed mental health
care weren't disclosed, Ms. Vaccaro described it as "the
biggest deal dollar-wise" yet for a managed care vendor. "We
expect this will {continue to} happen as companies struggle
with ways to provide benefits and also manage their costs."</p>
<p>While overall health costs at IBM have increased at a 10%
to 11% annual rate over the past few years, according to W.E.
Burdick, senior vice president for personnel, mental health
and substance abuse costs have soared at a 20% rate. "It's
the single highest cost escalation area of all of our {health
benefit} offerings," he said.</p>
<p>Among companies with 5,000 or more employees, mental
health and substance abuse costs soared 47% last year over
1988, according to a survey by A. Foster Higgins & Co., a New
York benefits consultant.</p>
<p>That's one reason some companies have decided to break
mental health and substance abuse out of health benefit
programs. Those problems "are dramatically different from
other acute care medical issues," said Daniel C. Smith,
director of employee assistance and human risk management
resources at McDonnell Douglas Corp., which has developed
innovative mental health treatment programs. "The treatment
of these conditions individually is far less predictable than
it is for acute health problems and there is so much
individual variance in response to treatment. It doesn't make
sense for us to try to make a square peg fit in a round
hole."</p>
<p>Still, says Foster Higgins, just 5% of all companies, and
10% of companies with more than 10,000 employees, have set up
separate preferred provider networks to manage mental health
costs.</p>
<p>IBM, based in Armonk, N.Y., coupled the change in its
mental health plan with other benefits revisions, including
new programs for long-term care insurance and assistance with
catastrophic health problems such as spinal injuries, organ
transplants, and premature births. Mr. Burdick said the
overall intent is to meet new benefits needs of employees in
these areas while cutting annual growth in costs to single
digits. IBM spends about $3,400 a year per employee on health
care, or more than $750 million.</p>
<p>American PsychManagement, a unit of closely held Value
Health Inc., Avon, Conn., was selected from more than a dozen
vendors who bid on the contract, which Value Health said was
"in the tens of millions of dollars."</p>
<p>Moving to managed care is a "big departure from IBM's
culture," said Bryan Lane, a principal with Towers Perrin, a
benefit consultant that helped the company design the plan.
Although participation in the network is voluntary, the
company is recommending providers for its employees, breaking
from past practice of completely free choice. But Mr. Burdick
said many employees are eager for recommendations, especially
for mental health problems. He said response to the program,
announced this week, is already positive.</p>
<p>The mental health plan, as well as other benefits changes,
were designed after the company made numerous surveys of its
work force. That groundwork, as well as financial incentives,
should help persuade employees to use it, the company says.</p>
<p>For instance, for those in the network, the company will
pay 100% of inpatient hospitalization for an unlimited period
after an annual deductible. For those seeking care outside
the network, coverage drops to 80% of hospitalization for up
to 90 days a year. For outpatient care, including visits with
psychiatrists, the plan pays 80% of expenses up to $15,000
and then 50% up to $25,000; non-network reimbursement is 50%
of expenses up to $25,000.</p>
<p>In addition, employees will be permitted to nominate their
own providers for the network, who would then have to fulfill
criteria specified by American PsychManagement. And officials
believe the sheer number of participants will make it easy
for employees to use the network.</p>
<p>As one of the nation's largest employers, IBM considers
itself in the vanguard of employee benefits and says it has
pioneered programs in such areas as prevention, child care
networks and geriatric services. By its sheer size, IBM's
work force reflects a variety of health and social trends --
ranging from substance abuse to care for elderly dependents
-- that affect companies and their employees around the
country. How it addresses such issues is of broad interest
among benefits officials and health policy makers, especially
as companies seek successful cost-containment strategies.</p>
<p>For Value Health's unit, the IBM contract represents
enormous growth. American PsychManagement has set up a unit
devoted exclusively to IBM that will have 100 employees, said
Thomas J. Neville, the unit's chief operating officer. The
unit's current work force is 130.</p>
