	<p class="article-leader">SCOTTSDALE, Ariz. -- Go-Video Inc. said it won a round in
federal court against five Japanese electronics companies it
has sued for allegedly blocking its efforts to market a
dual-deck videocassette recorder in the U.S.
   A federal court in Phoenix, Ariz., denied the motions of
the defendants to have Go-Video's antitrust suit dismissed,
Go-Video said. The ruling means that the case will go to
trial before a federal jury in Phoenix within 120 days, to
determine if the Japanese VCR manufacturers conspired in
violation of federal antitrust laws to block the marketing of
dual-deck VCRs in the U.S., Go-Video said.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The court also rejected the defendants' challenge to
Go-Video's basic dual-deck VCR patent, the company said.
However, the court refused to reconsider a previous decision
dismissing Go-Video's claims against Sharp Corp. Go-Video
said it intends to appeal the court's dismissal of Sharp. The
defendants remaining in the case include Matsushita Electric
Industrial Co., Victor Co. of Japan, Sony Corp., Sanyo
Electric Co., and NEC Corp.</p>
<p>In addition, Go-Video said the court lifted a stay on a
second lawsuit Go-Video brought against these same companies,
including Sharp, alleging a world-wide conspiracy to
monopolize consumer electronics products.</p>
<p>R. Terren Dunlap, chairman and chief executive officer of
Go-Video, said the company "won the first half of the battle"
by bringing its dual-deck VCR to market on June 30.</p>
