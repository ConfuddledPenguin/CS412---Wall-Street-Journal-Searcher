	<p class="article-leader">Asahi Glass Co. said pretax profit in the first half rose
2.3% to a record 40.14 billion yen ($267.6 million).
   The Japanese chemical and glass maker had profit of 39.23
billion yen in the year-earlier period.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Sales rose 12% to a record 487.68 billion yen from 437.04
billion yen. Net income also grew to a record, at 21.84
billion yen, or 18.74 yen a share, up 3.9% from 21.02 billion
yen, or 18.08 yen a share. The company plans to pay an
unchanged dividend of 4.5 yen a share.</p>
<p>Sales of glass and construction materials, accounting for
51.6% of total sales, gained 13% to 251.81 billion yen. Sales
of fabricated glass had strong gains, reflecting domestic
automobile sales, which more than compensated for a decline
in auto exports, officials said.</p>
<p>Sales of chemicals, accounting for 36.2% of overall sales,
gained 6.8% to 176.4 billion yen.</p>
<p>Earnings were damped by higher labor and transportation
costs, a spokesman said. Higher raw materials costs, largely
reflecting the yen's weakness in the first quarter, also hurt
profit, he said.</p>
