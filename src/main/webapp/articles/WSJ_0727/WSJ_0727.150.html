	<p class="article-leader">Rumors that the Soviet Union may buy soybean products with
a portion of the proceeds from its planned diamond sales sent
soybean futures prices sharply higher in active trading.
   Corn futures prices also gained ground on rumors of
planned Soviet purchases. Wheat futures prices lagged behind,
closing only marginally higher.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Futures analysts said Soviet plans to borrow $1 billion
from the Swiss arm of De Beers, the South African mining
consortium, fueled rumors that a significant amount of that
money would go toward soybean and grain imports over the next
several months. The loan was coupled with the Soviets' plan
to sell $5 billion of diamonds through De Beers over the next
five years.</p>
<p>Soybean futures for November delivery gained 10 cents a
bushel to close at $6.0925.</p>
<p>Reports in the Soviet media this week about millions of
tons of grain going unharvested because of a lack of fuel for
farm equipment also supported soybean and corn futures
prices, analysts said.</p>
<p>December corn futures gained 2.75 cents a bushel to close
at $2.5875.</p>
<p>Domestic demand is buoying U.S. soybean futures prices as
well. Figures released Wednesday indicated that U.S. soybean
oil consumption last month was the fourth largest ever
reported for June, said Richard Loewy, president of
AgResource Co. in Chicago.</p>
<p>Yesterday's diamond-sparked rally may be just a flash in
the pan, warned one analyst. With prospects for a large U.S.
soybean harvest undiminished, "soybean futures are not
something you want to own for the longer term," said Mickey
Luth, a futures analyst with Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. in
Chicago.</p>
<p>In other commodity markets yesterday:</p>
<p>PRECIOUS METALS: Futures prices were mixed, with those of
gold and platinum easing while silver edged higher. After
stronger gold price movements earlier in the week, trading
turned quieter yesterday. Indications that OPEC members will
seek a crude oil price around $20 a barrel, and possibly as
high as $22, was in line with traders' expectations. As a
result, precious metals prices weren't much affected, William
O'Neill, senior futures strategist for Merrill Lynch, said.
"That anticipated result is already in the market, and any
OPEC decision isn't expected to have any effect -- unless of
course there are some surprising developments," he said. The
dollar was mixed, which was about neutral for gold, Mr.
O'Neill said. One interesting development, according to Mr.
O'Neill, is that the Soviet Union appears to be getting its
credit house in order, as indicated by the reported $1
billion loan that was collateralized by Soviet diamonds. "If
this improvement continues, it will diminish some of the
Soviet Union's urgency to sell precious metals, which would
be a long-term positive factor for the market," he said. In
platinum, the fact that the dollar was slightly higher
against the yen tended to soften Japanese demand for the
metal, said Nina Lipton, research manager, Platinum Guild
International, an industry group. Ms. Lipton said that when
the dollar declines against the yen, the Japanese are
inclined to buy platinum because it is cheaper in yen terms.</p>
<p>COFFEE: Futures prices rose. The September contract rose
2.05 cents a pound to 90.85 cents, just 0.05 cent shy of the
day's high. The contract traded in a range of slightly more
than two cents. Providing some support for the market was
uncertainty about the size of the 1990-91 coffee crop in
Brazil, whose season began July 1, an analyst said. Brazil is
the world's biggest coffee producer. According to Sandra Kaul
of Shearson Lehman Hutton, estimates of the harvest range
from 22 million to 33 million bags; a bag is 132 pounds. "The
11 million-bag difference between these estimates is equal to
the output of Colombia, the world's second-largest producer,"
Ms. Kaul said. "It's unclear how much low prices that have
prevailed over the past year, since the International Coffee
Agreement quota and price clauses were suspended in July
1989, have affected the care of the coffee trees. Also,
recent rains may have had an impact on the quality of the
recently harvested Brazilian coffee being dried." A recent
Brazilian government decision to pay farmers from the coffee
development fund has tempered the farmers' urgency to sell
coffee, and many are withholding the beans, which has
influenced prices, Ms. Kaul said.</p>
