	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Stock-index arbitrage accounted for more than
half of total program trading volume during the week of July
9 through 13, the New York Stock Exchange said yesterday.
   Stock-index arbitrage, the most controversial form of
program trading, in which traders jump between stock-index
futures and options and underlying stocks to lock in profits,
accounted for 52.9% of all program trades during July 9
through 13. The previous week, stock-index arbitrage
accounted for 45% of all program trading.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The Big Board said that of the top five program-trading
firms for the week, about 79% of all index arbitrage was
conducted by General Electric Co.'s Kidder, Peabody & Co.
unit, Morgan Stanley Group Inc.'s Morgan Stanley & Co. unit,
Susquehanna Investment Group and CS First Boston Inc.'s First
Boston Corp. unit.</p>
<p>Aside from stock-index arbitrage, program trading also
describes strategies that involve the purchase or sale of
baskets of 15 or more stocks.</p>
<p>Overall, program trading amounted to 7.9% of average daily
volume of 171.3 million shares on the Big Board during the
week, down from 10.9% of average daily volume of 125.1
million shares the previous week.</p>
