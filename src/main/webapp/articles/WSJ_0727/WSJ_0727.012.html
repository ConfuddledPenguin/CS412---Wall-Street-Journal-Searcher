	<p class="article-leader">There was a collective national "frisson" when JFK
announced in the early 1960s that the U.S. would put a man on
the moon by the end of the decade. When President Bush
announced recently that he wanted to reach Mars by 2019, the
response was far from deafening. There was some discussion,
there were some magazine covers -- but no true universal
cheer.
   Americans now are not looking toward the stars. They are
looking at a burgeoning federal deficit and other hard fiscal
realities. Americans also have seen our country's grand
scientific achievements either perish in a ball of flame (the
Challenger disaster) or end in grotesque failure (the Hubble
Telescope's imitation of Mr. Magoo). This is why an excellent
book such as "Mars Beckons" (Knopf, 244 pages, $24.95) by
John Noble Wilford still gives one mixed emotions.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Mr. Wilford, a science correspondent for the New York
Times, paints a picture that is pleasing to our adventurous
eye. But one can't help but be seized by the skepticism of
the present day, for it will be quite hard to slip the surly
financial bonds that stricture America's expeditionary
yearnings.</p>
<p>Yet Mr. Wilford sounds the theme of inevitability in his
book: "Humans will go forth to Mars. In the next two or three
decades perhaps, in the twenty-first century almost
certainly, astronauts will make the long journey," he writes.
"They may be Americans or Russians, traveling separately or
together, and they may be Europeans, Chinese, and Japanese as
well. Their journeys should be only the beginning of human
expansion out into the solar system."</p>
<p>We will go to Mars, he argues, in part because of our
ancient fascination with the Red Planet, and he chronicles
its appeal through the ages at the beginning of "Mars
Beckons." In a sweeping preamble, the reader is taken to the
very beginning of Martian studies, a study first steeped in
astrological mysticism that then grew and matured as the
scientific mind matured.</p>
<p>Mars was an object of awe for the ancients in Mesopotamia,
an object of scientific study for the likes of astronomers
Tycho Brahe, Johannes Kepler and Percival Lowell and an
object of fear exploited by H.G. Wells and Orson Welles. We
have always had this longing for some sort of life on Mars.
We've always wanted more than an echo when we gave a call
across space. Our fanciful visions of Martian canals,
beautiful Martian women and advanced Martian civilizations
stayed with us -- right up until the point we went there.</p>
<p>His Martian history lesson concluded, Mr. Wilford shows us
the long path to Martian exploration. After years of spinning
Martian yarns and peering through telescopes, we finally
reached Mars with The Little Spacecraft That Could -- Mariner
4. His description of the craft, which reached Mars in 1965,
brings to mind an old piece of intricately spun Steuben:
"Simple and small . . . The solar blades shone purple from
the thin sapphire-glass coating . . . the craft's silvery
octagonal body . . . carried 138,000 delicate instruments . .
."</p>
<p>Soviet and American Martian exploration had been checkered
by many failures before Mariner 4, prompting American
planetary engineers to imagine a "Great Galactic Ghoul" that
ate spacecraft. But the pictures Mariner 4 sent back showed
no canals, no ancient civilizations, no beautiful women, not
even a small ghoul.</p>
<p>Even so, we went forward, with more orbiters, with robotic
landers. But the ultimate goal, the goal that Mr. Wilford is
very excited about, is a manned mission to Mars. "The time
for decision is at hand," insists Mr. Wilford. The end of the
Cold War and growing pro-Mars sentiment are cited as two
reasons why we can explore the Red Planet. The entire world
-- America, the Soviet Union, Europe, Asia -- should take
part in the exploration of this red world. And soon, too. A
perfect date to announce these grand plans, he thinks, would
be in 1992, the 500th anniversary of Christopher Columbus's
discovery of the New World, a feat that required great
fortitude.</p>
<p>But Columbus had to sail over the edge of the world; we
now have to sail beyond it. How we can do it technically is
discussed in depth in "Mars Beckons."</p>
<p>But what is lacking in the book is a true sense of the
political and financial barriers to the Martian endeavor. Mr.
Wilford cites the rhetoric of politicians, the supposed
willingness of the Soviets to cooperate, the technological
capacity of the present day and the technological progress of
the near future as foundations for a Mars mission.</p>
<p>One wants to believe in Mr. Wilford's vision, like a
sinner wishing for salvation at a church revival. But
reality, like Old Scratch, always seems to ruin things.
Budget negotiators continually eye NASA's budget hungrily.
NASA isn't playing it smart in this day of fiscal crunch --
its reliance on huge, expensive projects prone to failure
(Hubble, the proposed Space Station Freedom) has not endeared
the space agency to Congress or the American people. The
clamor over AIDS, the environment and the homeless, among
other things, drowns out the discussion about Mars. The
debate over whether the U.S. should support "big science"
projects like the Space Station or whether we should support
smaller, less ambitious and less costly endeavors dominates
discourse nowadays -- and present reality seems to be tilting
us toward smaller projects.</p>
<p>Yet, Mr. Wilford offers us a compelling vision of our
past, present and (hopefully) future with Mars. He obviously
is excited about our future: Someone should set this book to
the tune of "Blue Danube." "The call to Mars," he writes,
"echoes through centuries of human history." The grand vision
of setting foot upon Mars is tantalizing, but our present
problems threaten to muffle and drown out this ancient call
to explore.</p>
