	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- The House Energy and Commerce Committee
voted to seek immunity for Michael Milken and Ivan Boesky in
return for testimony on junk bonds.
   The two are expected to testify as part of a probe by the
subcommittee on oversight and investigations into questions
surrounding junk bonds and securities underwritten by Drexel
Burnham Lambert Inc. In particular, the subcommittee has
focused on about 500 partnerships that included Drexel
employees and bought into Drexel-sponsored deals.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Mr. Milken, who in the spring pleaded guilty to six felony
counts of securities-law violations, is to be sentenced
around Oct. 1, after which he will be immunized and cooperate
with prosecutors and the Securities and Exchange Commission.</p>
<p>Mr. Boesky, a former takeover-stock speculator, pleaded
guilty to insider trading in 1986 and in April was paroled
from federal prison after serving about 18 months. Mr. Boesky
also has agreed to do extensive interviews with the
subcommittee staff before his testimony, a panel staff member
said. Mr. Milken has refused to do staff interviews, the
staff member said.</p>
<p>A spokesman for Mr. Milken said his client will testify
when the immunity grant comes through. A lawyer for Mr.
Boesky wouldn't confirm whether his client would cooperate
with the subcommittee.</p>
