	<p class="article-leader">TORONTO -- Canadian Auto Workers President Robert White
warned Chrysler Corp.'s Canadian subsidiary that the union
would strike if the company refused to accept any contract
agreement worked out with the other Canadian units of the Big
Three auto makers.
   Speaking at the opening of contract negotiations, Kenneth
Francese, Chrysler Canada's vice president, human resources,
said the company hadn't yet decided whether it would follow
the traditional system of pattern bargaining, in which the
Big Three all fall in with the contract terms worked out
between the union and one of the companies targeted for
talks. But, he said, "If something is done by one of the
other companies that we believe would negatively impact
Chrysler in its competitiveness, then we'll have to take a
look at it."</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The parent company, which began contract negotiations in
the U.S. last week, has told the United Auto Workers that it
wants to be the target company, because it believes it can't
afford to be as generous as General Motors Corp. or Ford
Motor Co. If it isn't the target, Chrysler would like a
different contract. The UAW wants to maintain pattern
bargaining, but hasn't said what it would do if Chrysler opts
out.</p>
<p>Contracts at the Big Three in both Canada and the U.S.
expire Sept. 14.</p>
<p>Chrysler also has offered its U.S. workers stock in the
company and bonus payments in return for greater flexibility
to operate its plants. Mr. Francese said Chrysler Canada
hasn't offered such incentives, but said the company
considers more flexible work rules its top bargaining goal.
Chrysler Canada's success in this area "will determine the
size of any economic package we may negotiate," he said.</p>
<p>Mr. White said the union presented Chrysler Canada with
nearly identical demands to those made to the Canadian units
of GM and Ford earlier this week. The union is seeking higher
wages, better protection against inflation and a limited
degree of job security.</p>
