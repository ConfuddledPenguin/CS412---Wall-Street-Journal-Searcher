	<p class="article-leader">TOKYO -- Was Japan's stock market rigged?
   For years, conspiracy theorists have hinted that the
mammoth securities houses that dominate trading on the Tokyo
Stock Exchange routinely act in collusion with their major
clients. Until now, there had been little official support
for such allegations.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Yesterday, though, Japanese newspapers reported that
Japan's National Tax Agency allegedly discovered that about
20 securities firms -- including two of the biggest, Yamaichi
Securities Co. and Daiwa Securities Co. -- had paid more than
16 billion yen ($106.7 million) in compensation to cover
losses logged by big customers in the 18 months through March
31, 1989.</p>
<p>The Tokyo Tax Administration Bureau refused to comment on
the allegations, which were carried in articles in all the
major evening newspapers here. According to the newspapers,
the authorities are seeking from the securities firms seven
to eight billion yen in back taxes on the compensation. The
authorities also are said to be continuing their
investigations at other houses, including the giants Nikko
Securities Co. and Nomura Securities Co.</p>
<p>Because the compensation that is paid should be reported
as profit by the securities firms -- such compensation isn't
permitted under Japan's Securities and Exchange Law -- firms
that made these payments without paying taxes on them first
could be found to have violated the country's tax code and
still to owe back taxes on the money.</p>
<p>Both Daiwa and Yamaichi issued statements, denying the
allegations. A spokesman for Daiwa said he couldn't
understand why the matter is surfacing now, as the company
already has been audited for the tax year involved.</p>
<p>Still, this isn't the first time Daiwa has been charged in
this kind of case. Last year, the firm paid about 6.2 billion
yen in back taxes on 10 billion yen in compensation it paid
to some big institutional investors for losses they incurred
during the late 1970s.</p>
<p>In that instance, as well as in the latest alleged tax
violations, Japan's tax authorities have uncovered what fund
managers have said in the past is a common practice in Japan:
securities firms' guaranteeing returns for big investors.</p>
<p>Nihon Keizai Shimbun, Japan's leading economic newspaper,
said the securities firms compensated major clients for
losses by buying back from them, at a profit for the clients,
bonds and other securities that the securities firms
initially sold to those same clients at a discount. The
newspaper said many major clients demanded such compensation
after the Black Monday stock market crash in October 1987.</p>
<p>This means the securities firms would have been taking
losses on such transactions to bolster their big clients.
Small stockholders aren't given the opportunity to recoup
their losses in a similar way, and, analysts said,
effectively lose on the deals because of the higher fees they
must eventually pay to cover the securities firms' costs.</p>
<p>"They're discriminating against the individual," Stuart
Matthews, a financial analyst for Barclays de Zoete Wedd
Securities Ltd., a British firm with offices in Tokyo, said.
"They're saving the big guys from harm."</p>
<p>The implications of the latest allegations against the
securities firms are significant, Mr. Matthews said. "It
raises the question of what the Japanese firms did after the
crash" of share prices earlier this year in Tokyo, he said.
"Clearly, they allow their profits to leak away" by paying
them out to clients.</p>
<p>Partly as a result of the newspaper reports, the share
prices of the Big Four Japanese securities houses fell
yesterday. Daiwa shares fell 40 yen to 1,330 yen, Yamaichi
was off 60 at 1,120, Nikko was down 50 at 1,120, and Nomura
lost 50 to 2,050.</p>
