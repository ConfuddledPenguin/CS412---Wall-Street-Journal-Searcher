	<p class="article-leader">THE HOUSE VOTED to reprimand Rep. Frank, rejecting a
censure penalty.
   Frank, a liberal Democrat from Massachusetts and an
acknowledged homosexual, was punished for using his official
influence on behalf of a male prostitute. The 408-18 vote,
which came after the House rejected a GOP-backed motion
calling for the harsher censure penalty, upheld the
recommendations of the Ethics Committee. The issue split the
chamber emotionally and reflected more partisanship than in
any ethics case in the past decade. The censure motion, which
failed 287-141, was opposed by all but 12 Democrats, while
Republicans were almost 3-1 in favor of it.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>In a statement before the vote, Frank explained that he
took some of the actions in part to "conceal" his
homosexuality, which he later disclosed.</p>

<p>Bush signed the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990,

new protection for AIDS-infected workers.</p>

<p>The EPA said last month's easing of federal controls on

<p>Waldheim met in Salzburg, Austria, with the presidents of
Czechoslovakia and West Germany in a break with the

German army unit linked to atrocities.</p>

in Saudi Arabia.</p>

<p>Armenia's Parliament set up a panel to respond to Soviet
leader Gorbachev's threat to use force against illegal groups

lost faith in Soviet security forces on the Azerbaijan border
and had to rely on armed nationalists.</p>

<p>A federal jury in Los Angeles found a Honduran, Juan
Ramone Matta Ballesteros, guilty of racketeering, kidnapping
and conspiracy in the 1985 murders of U.S. drug agent Enrique
Camarena and his pilot. But the jury acquitted Matta on a
single charge of murdering Camarena. Three other defendants
are awaiting verdicts in the case.</p>

<p>Researchers said a woman apparently got AIDS from her
dentist during a tooth-pulling procedure, though he wore

Dental Association officials said the Centers for Disease
Control may have jumped to conclusions.</p>

<p>North and South Korea reached an accord to have their
prime ministers meet in a bid to end hostilities, but a new
dispute developed soon after the pact was signed in
Panmunjom. The controversy erupted after a plan by five North
Koreans to cross into South Korea was scrapped because of a
feud involving their accommodations.</p>

<p>A juror was dismissed from deliberations in a
money-laundering trial in federal court in Tampa, Fla., after

to declare a mistrial and ordered the 11 remaining jurors to
continue deliberations.</p>

<p>Secretary of State Baker rejected criticism from Asian
allies over how to deal with Vietnamese boat people seeking
refuge in neighboring countries. Baker said the U.S. remained
opposed to forcibly repatriating the bulk of the refugees to
Vietnam. He arrived in Indonesia for a conference of foreign
ministers scheduled to start today.</p>

<p>East Germany's coalition appeared likely to survive after
politicians from both German states narrowed their

in December. The two governments agreed they should conclude
a treaty by the end of August outlining voting procedures.</p>

<p>The U.S. death rate from asthma rose over 30% in seven
years, and nearly 10 million Americans are affected by the
disease, the Centers for Disease Control reported. Officials
said a number of factors may be contributing to the increase,
including air quality and exposure to infections and other
"triggers" for bronchial constriction.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>Salvadoran officials and rebels agreed to have a U.N.
commission monitor human rights in El Salvador, where tens of
thousands of civilians have died in a decade-old civil war.
The commission wouldn't begin work until a cease-fire
agreement is reached between the government and the
guerrillas, who are holding talks in Costa Rica.</p>
