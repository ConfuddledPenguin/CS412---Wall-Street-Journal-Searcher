	<p class="article-leader">SOUTER STARTS in good shape as he faces Senate
confirmation.
   Bush aides are highly pleased at initial reactions to the
Supreme Court nominee. Conservatives aren't thrilled but are
satisfied. Liberals are thrown off by Souter's lack of a
record on abortion; Judiciary Committee members seem
uncertain about how to raise the issue. But Bush aides insist
they are taking nothing for granted.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>While former top Reagan aide Kenneth Duberstein comes in
to steer the confirmation effort, Souter will spend next
month combing through his judicial writings to anticipate any
controversies. Meanwhile, Bush aides debate the wisdom of
launching a high-profile public campaign for the nomination;
some say that while things are going smoothly, Bush shouldn't
create an atmosphere suggesting he anticipates problems.</p>
<p>Democrats play coy about scheduling confirmation hearings,
hoping to buy time to scour Souter's record, but Republicans
will soon demand a date.</p>
<p>ELECTION-YEAR JOCKEYING imperils Bush-Congress relations.</p>
<p>The president's attacks on Democrats over taxes antagonize
lawmakers and complicate budget talks, despite his promise to
ease up. An extraordinarily heavy September schedule of
political trips will come just as he will be trying to get a
budget agreement and get clean-air, anti-crime and
civil-rights measures through.</p>
<p>Bush tries to calm ruffled Democrats by telling them he
will try to separate his general political attacks from the
budget talks. But House Democratic Whip Gray warns that "if
the president is going to run around America and score points
attacking Democrats, and then he thinks that in the closed
room on Capitol Hill we're going to sit there and do
substance, you're nuts."</p>
<p>REGIONAL DISPUTES resist resolution by the superpowers.</p>
<p>Soviet officials tell the U.S. they are ready to trim
subsidies to Cuba and lean on Castro to stop stirring up
trouble in El Salvador, but they assert their leverage over
him is limited. It is also uncertain whether Moscow can prod
Vietnam toward a Cambodia settlement, while the U.S. is
unwilling to pressure China into cutting aid to the Khmer
Rouge.</p>
<p>In Siberia next week, Baker will press Shevardnadze for an
accord on Afghan elections -- but a Baker aide concedes that
some of the U.S.-backed guerrillas won't back any deal that
doesn't oust Communist leader Najibullah first. The Soviets
also claim they are anxious to defuse tensions in Kashmir,
but say their old ties to India make cooperation with the
U.S. difficult there.</p>
<p>Baker says "we don't have any assurances" that cooperation
with the Soviets can ease these trouble spots, but "that
doesn't mean we ought not to make the effort."</p>
<p>GOVERNORS WILL SPAR over S&Ls at their national conference
in Mobile, Ala., this weekend. Virginia's Wilder, a Democrat,
pushes for a bipartisan commission to look at the S&L mess.
But the GOP arms its governors with a long fact sheet
detailing Democratic ties to fallen thrift executives.</p>
<p>GATT ACCORDS elude frustrated U.S. negotiators. Despite
the Houston summit's call for quicker action on an agreement
to phase out agricultural subsidies, the EC continues to drag
its feet. West Germany's Chancellor Kohl, for one, doesn't
want to bargain away his farmers' benefits before this fall's
elections.</p>
<p>SOLDIERS TO TEACHERS: The Army asks a group of educators
to help find teaching jobs for people leaving the shrinking
military. Retiring military trainers could help schools fill
shortages of math and science teachers and find needed
teachers for inner-city schools.</p>
<p>TOBACCO INTERESTS, resigned to being hit with a hefty tax
increase if there is a major deficit-reduction agreement,
angle to minimize the pain. They hope to hold the increase to
less than a doubling of current 16-cent-a-pack tax, and for a
four-year phase-in of the increase. But the chances for such
a long grace period aren't good.</p>
<p>CONGRESS FACES a mess over raising the debt limit.</p>
<p>With the Treasury saying it will need new borrowing
authority by Aug. 15, controversial amendments to the
must-pass bill are a near-certainty in the Senate. Moynihan
intends to offer his plan to cut the Social Security payroll
tax. Heinz will demand that the Social Security surplus be
taken out of the official deficit calculation. Kasten may
press the GOP's capital-gains tax cut.</p>
<p>House Speaker Foley says the debt limit is the one issue
that could delay the planned Aug. 3 start of the
congressional recess. Ways and Means Chairman Rostenkowski
predicts that the legislation could be defeated once before
it is finally passed -- and then might only be extended for
two months.</p>
<p>That would force members to vote on the issue again in
mid-October -- perhaps with a deficit-reduction accord
attached.</p>
<p>MINOR MEMOS: Michigan GOP Senate candidate Schuette's TV
ads complain of Senate spending on Washington's Metro subway
system -- without mentioning that he voted for the House bill
that included Metro money. . . . Deborah Dean, a central
figure in the HUD scandal, tries something new: She opens a
Georgetown antique shop called "The Proud American.". . . The
world's only rap song with lyrics including "regulatory
accounting principles" is "The S&L Rap," by New York Rep.
