	<p class="article-leader">DETROIT -- General Motors Corp. and Ford Motor Co.
reported steep drops in second-quarter earnings, largely
reflecting hard times in the U.S. market and economic unrest
in Brazil.
   Ford's quarterly net income tumbled 45%, as a profit
plunge overseas compounded the effect of expected lower
results in North America. At GM, earnings fell 38%. Heavy
spending for discounts and other sales inducements more than
offset the benefits of a slight increase in the No. 1 auto
maker's U.S. market share. Chrysler Corp. is expected to
report earnings next week, and analysts are estimating a
profit drop there of as much as 60%.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Investors and analysts had expected weak earnings from
both GM and Ford. Yesterday, GM common stock closed at
$47.25, down 37.5 cents, in New York Stock Exchange composite
trading. Ford stock fell 37.5 cents to close at $41.875.</p>
<p>Ford and GM both plan to boost U.S. vehicle output in the
third quarter, which should help earnings. The European
market, meanwhile, continues to look healthy. U.S. market
demand is weak, and pressure from Japanese auto makers could
undermine U.S. auto makers' efforts to beef up profit margins
by raising prices.</p>
<p>At Ford, second-quarter net dropped to $770.7 million, or
$1.67 a share, from $1.41 billion, or $3 a share, a year
earlier. Revenue rose slightly to $26.87 billion from $25.89
billion.</p>
<p>"Overseas automotive earnings were off 78%," David N.
McCammon, vice president for finance, said at a news
conference. "U.S. automotive earnings were off 22%." Ford ran
into major problems in both its big overseas markets: Europe,
where a strike cut output in Belgium, and Latin America,
where Brazil's economic reform measures are hurting many
companies. Earnings from financial-services operations rose
40%, to $241.5 million.</p>
<p>For the third quarter, Mr. McCammon said, "the earnings
outlook for the U.S. is better" than last year, while "the
outlook for overseas is worse." He wouldn't forecast overall
earnings for the quarter, but he said there's only a 50%
chance that Ford will make profit-sharing payments to its
U.S. hourly workers this year. Ford has paid each worker an
average $2,500 a year in profit sharing since 1987.</p>
<p>Perhaps the most significant number Ford released
yesterday was not in its income statement but in the balance
sheet. Ford reported that its ratio of debt to shareholders'
equity rose to 27% at the end of the second quarter from just
10% a year earlier. The company is borrowing heavily, Mr.
McCammon explained, to finance an ambitious capital-spending
program.</p>
<p>The spending includes the development of new engines and
transmissions -- where Ford has lagged behind major rivals --
and new vehicles, as well as the recent purchase of Jaguar
PLC. Capital spending jumped 26% in the first half, to $3.3
billion.</p>
<p>"We've been spending at record levels," Mr. McCammon said.
"We think it's good strategy to capitalize on the momentum we
gained during the 1980s."</p>
<p>Ford's borrowings, Mr. McCammon said, accounted for the
increase in cash and marketable securities during the
quarter, to $6.41 billion from just $3.86 billion three
months earlier. A year ago, Ford's cash stood at $7.8
billion.</p>
<p>Mr. McCammon said Ford spent $1,050 per vehicle on buyer
incentives in the second quarter, up from just $600 a vehicle
a year ago. The heavy spending will continue, he said, for
the rest of the model year, which ends Sept. 30.</p>
<p>One positive factor, he added, is that Ford's North
American vehicle output will be 18% higher in the third
quarter than it was a year ago. In the first half output
dropped about 18% because Ford was reducing inventories,
which now stand at a normal level. World-wide, Ford sold 1.7
million cars and trucks in the second quarter, down from 1.8
million a year earlier.</p>
<p>Mr. McCammon said the pending sale of Ford Aerospace to
Loral Corp. "probably won't be closed for several months and
won't have a material effect on earnings," though it will
boost Ford's cash position. Mr. McCammon wouldn't comment on
whether BDM International Inc., which Ford Aerospace bought
just two years ago for $425 million, was valued at less than
$100 million in the pending transaction.</p>
<p>At GM, second-quarter earnings slumped to $900.1 million,
or $1.32 a common share, from $1.45 billion, or $2.23 a
common share, a year ago.</p>
<p>Profit dived even though GM's total revenue rose 1.2% to
$33.9 billion and world-wide factory sales of GM vehicles
dipped just 2% to 2,143,000 vehicles from 2,184,000 vehicles
a year ago.</p>
<p>GM said profit was depressed by heavy discounting of
vehicles sold in North America and the pressure put on
Brazilian operations by the economic turmoil there. GM may
have had a loss of about $120 million in Brazil in the second
quarter, said David Healy, an analyst at Barclays de Zoete
Wedd in New York.</p>
<p>But rising costs hurt, too. GM's operating and
administrative costs in the quarter rose 3.7% from a year ago
-- more than triple the growth rate in overall revenue.</p>
<p>Profit at GM's overseas operations, excluding Brazil,
"continued at a record level" in the quarter, the company
said in a statement. Higher profit from two of its three big
non-automotive units, General Motors Acceptance Corp. and
Electronic Data Systems Corp., also helped to cushion GM's
weak performance in North American vehicle operations and
Brazil.</p>
<p>GM's core North American vehicle operations appear to have
been at best marginally profitable, analysts said. Retail
sales of GM cars and light trucks fell 5.5% to 1,385,025
vehicles in the quarter despite discounts that averaged
$1,000 a vehicle.</p>
<p>GM increased its share of the total U.S. car and truck
market to 35.8% from 35.5% a year ago. That was because its
sales decline was slightly less severe than the slide in
overall U.S. vehicle sales.</p>
<p>With overall profit margins down 40% from a year ago, GM
had to dip into its cash reserves to finance operations
during the first six months of the year. The auto maker had
$6.18 billion in cash as of June 30, down 12.5% from $7.07
billion at the beginning of the year and off 13% from $7.13
billion a year ago.</p>
