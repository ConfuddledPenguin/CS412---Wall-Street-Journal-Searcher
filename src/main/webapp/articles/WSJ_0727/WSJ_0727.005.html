	<p class="article-leader">BENTON HARBOR, Mich. -- Whirlpool Corp., hammered by a
loss from its Brazilian affiliates, said second-quarter
earnings fell 26% to $37 million, or 54 cents a share.
   Like other manufacturers with operations in Brazil, the
appliance maker has suffered under that country's economic
reform plan introduced last March. In the year-earlier
period, Whirlpool earned $50 million, or 72 cents a share.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The current results were slightly better than some
analysts expected. In New York Stock Exchange composite
trading, Whirlpool closed yesterday at $28, up 37.5 cents.</p>
<p>The company said the outlook in Brazil for the rest of the
year remains uncertain, but added that improvements which
started in the second quarter have continued into the current
quarter.</p>
<p>Whirlpool said that, if its Brazilian affiliates' results
were excluded in both the latest and the year-earlier second
quarters, earnings would have risen 18%. It said North
American appliance operations were strong, despite a slumping
market for new homes.</p>
<p>Revenue for the quarter rose 4% to $1.71 billion from
$1.64 billion. For the six months, earnings fell 27% to $66
million, or 96 cents a share, from $91 million, or $1.31 a
share a year earlier. Revenue rose 4% to $3.34 billion from
$3.22 billion.</p>
