	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- The Senate embraced a proposal to revamp the
federal crop-insurance program and cover its underwriting
losses, putting senators at odds with the House's intention
to scuttle the long-troubled program.
   The Senate adopted an amendment by Sen. Thomas Daschle
(D., S.D.) after voting 55-42 to reject a rival proposal that
would have scuttled federal crop insurance after the 1993
harvest unless Congress found ways to increase farmer
participation in the program and cut its heavy losses.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>As senators drew close to wrapping up the 1990 farm bill,
there was a bipartisan consensus that the insurance program
was unduly complicated, actuarially unsound and, in many
states, unpopular with farmers. Sen. Christopher Bond (R.,
Mo.) complained that the Federal Crop Insurance Corp. has
become a "cash cow" for many farmers, paying $1.56 in
crop-loss claims for every $1 in premiums collected and
costing taxpayers $1 billion a year.</p>
<p>But the lawmakers differed on how best to ensure that
Congress tackles the task of overhauling the program. In
1988, Congress created a study panel on crop insurance, but
many of its recommendations proved too costly to adopt.</p>
<p>Mr. Bond proposed an amendment to end the insurance
program in three years, arguing that it would compel
lawmakers to address once again what he called "the
crop-insurance dilemma." But Sen. Daschle and other lawmakers
from the Great Plains, where crop insurance is popular,
warned that farmers would assume the program was all but dead
and stop buying crop insurance.</p>
<p>On July 19, the House approved a $50 billion agricultural
appropriations bill that would cut off funding for new
crop-insurance policies after Oct. 1. Funding for fiscal 1991
would be cut by more than half to $101.6 million, only enough
to cover policies outstanding.</p>
<p>But in adopting Mr. Daschle's proposal yesterday, the
Senate signaled to the House its determination to keep the
insurance program afloat. Under his proposal, the Commodity
Credit Corp., the Agriculture Department's lending arm, would
finance the program's operations if Congress appropriates no
funds.</p>
<p>Rep. Jamie Whitten (D., Miss.), chairman of the House
Appropriations Committee, is the arch foe of crop insurance,
while the administration favors setting up a standby
disaster-relief program for farmers who lose their crops if
the insurance program can't be reformed. House farm leaders
were considering options for rescuing the program. They hope
to wrap up their version of the omnibus legislation today.</p>
<p>The Senate has completed work on most of the bill, which
amounts to a five-year, $54 billion plan for U.S.
agriculture. But a filibuster last night by Sen. Thad Cochran
(R., Miss.) over the issue of cargo preference temporarily
stalled progress on the legislation. Mr. Cochran and other
Gulf state senators objected to an agreement that would
exempt Food-for-Peace cargoes through Great Lakes ports from
having to be carried on U.S.-flag ships.</p>
<p>Late Wednesday, Sen. Patrick Leahy (D., Vt.) and Senate
Majority Leader George Mitchell (D., Maine) decided against
adding a provision that would have established a mandatory
seafood-inspection program. The proposal would have given the
Agriculture Department the task of inspecting seafood
processors. But Sen. Ted Stevens (R., Alaska) and other
Commerce Committee members strongly favor making the Commerce
Department the lead agency. Messrs. Leahy and Mitchell
decided to take up the inspection plan later as a separate
bill, rather than risk a farm-bill filibuster by Sen.
Stevens.</p>
