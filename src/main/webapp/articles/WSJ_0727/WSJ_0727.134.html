	<p class="article-leader">International Business Machines Corp. said it plans to cut
staff at its European headquarters office, in a
reorganization that decentralizes management of its big
European operations.
   A spokesman for the Armonk, N.Y.-based computer giant said
the company's European headquarters in Paris is transferring
direct control of key business segments to selected IBM
managers in West Germany, France, Britain and Italy.
Previously, the Paris headquarters supervised these business
segments, which are Europewide divisions for particular types
of products or customers.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>In an internal memo that IBM released yesterday, following
a Reuters news report from New York, IBM Europe President
David E. McKinney wrote that the reorganization will "lead to
a progressive reduction of the size of the European
headquarters." About 170 Paris positions are currently
involved in managing the reorganized business segments; some
of these positions will be transferred around Europe, but
others could be eliminated, the spokesman said. There won't
be any "major relocation of jobs" this year, however, Mr.
McKinney's memo said.</p>
