	<p class="article-leader">Concurrent Computer Corp. said it expects to report a
substantial loss for the fiscal fourth quarter because of a
shortfall in estimated revenue.
   The supplier of real-time computer systems, based in
Tinton Falls, N.J., said it will cut its world-wide workforce
by about 15% to 20%, or between 435 and 580 employees.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>James K. Sims, chairman, president and chief executive
officer of Concurrent, attributed the revenue problem to
"confusion and hesitation" in the market for midsize
computers, caused by the trend toward products based on
certain software standards.</p>
<p>The company has retained Goldman, Sachs & Co. to look at
ways to create a more conservative balance sheet. At the end
of the third quarter, Concurrent had approximately $35
million in equity and $180 million in debt.</p>
<p>Concurrent posted a loss of $600,000 million, or three
cents a share, for the fourth quarter of 1989. Net income for
the fiscal 1990 third quarter was $200,000, or one cent a
share. Concurrent shares closed yesterday at 69 cents, down
75 cents, in national over-the-counter trading.</p>
