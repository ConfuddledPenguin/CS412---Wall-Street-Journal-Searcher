	<p class="article-leader">Medinah, Ill. -- What is so rare as a "fair" U.S. Open
golf course in June? How about one that's "benign" (Tom
Watson), "docile" (Greg Norman) or "defenseless" (Curtis
Strange)? Compared with those adjectives, the golfing
tourists' traditional lip-smacking appellation of "fair"
seemed mild.
   So they had the annual U.S. Open war at dreaded Medinah
Country Club here, as scheduled and then some, but the enemy
didn't show up. For three days, greens-softening rain and the
breezeless heat of an overdue Chicago summer bared the old
playground of the Ancient Order of Nobles of the Mystic
Shrine of North America to indignities too awful to
enumerate.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Well, not quite too awful. Before the second of the four
days of regulation play was completed, the Open record for
most sub-par rounds fell, and it would be nearly doubled (at
124) before the swinging ceased. The 36-hole cut was made
after 145 strokes, tying the mark for lowest ever in 90 of
these things. Twenty-eight players broke par of 288 over 72
holes, which was 28 more than had done it in two previous
Opens here, in 1949 and '75, when par was 284 over shorter
yardage.</p>
<p>And in the end, it almost didn't end, maybe because the
guys were having so much fun, but mostly because the U.S.
Golf Association's blue-blazer brigade, having nothing better
to do on Mondays, stands alone in big-time sports in
decreeing that ties be broken by a full-day's extra play.
Hale Irwin, a noted blaster from the past, and Mike Donald,
heretofore largely anonymous, were in it, by virtue of having
tied at eight-under-par 280 strokes after the 72 regular
holes.</p>
<p>They tied again Monday at plus-two 74 over the extra 18 as
Medinah, aided by drier weather and gusty winds, exacted a
measure of revenge. We wound up with sudden-death anyway, and
Irwin's eight-foot birdie putt on the 385-yard, par-four
first hole finally won it.</p>
<p>The 45-year-old Irwin became the oldest guy to win the big
silver cup, providing the middle-aged with a rare whiff of
sporting glory that was cruelly snuffed when 47-year-old Ray
Floyd came up just short at the Masters in April. Irwin is a
three-time winner of this thing, the other times coming in
1974 and '79. His hair is cut shorter now and he wears
contact lenses instead of specs. Both are changes for the
better, I'd say.</p>
<p>He's a part-time tourney player now, but avers that his
game hasn't changed much from those days. "I still keep the
ball in play and hit good iron shots," he said after his
triumph. "I didn't putt all that well today, but I guess I
wasn't so bad, either, because I'm here.</p>
<p>"Tenacity is something I've always had," he declared, and
then added a prescient note. "A couple weeks ago I had a
dream I'd won the Open; my wife can verify it," said he. "I
can't remember the specifics, but I do remember it was an
ordeal, just like this was."</p>
<p>Irwin's win will go into the books on the basis of more
than just age and repetition. He put together two memorable
charges, one to gain a share of the lead from four strokes
back in Sunday's fourth round, and another to recover from a
two-stroke deficit with three holes to go in Monday's
playoff.</p>
<p>Indeed, Sunday dawned with perhaps the closest-bunched
field in the event's history. The leader board was topped at
seven-under-par 209 by two fellas with scant credentials for
such eminence: Floridian Donald, 34, who had but one tourney
win to show for his 11 years of traveling with golf clubs,
and Billy Ray Brown, 27, a large, soft-featured Texan with
none to show for his three.</p>
<p>Four players were bunched one stroke behind them, six more
were two strokes back, including 1988 and '89 winner Strange,
and seven more were another shot distant. Irwin was tied with
seven others at 213 after rounds of 69, 70 and 74, a sizable
sand dune to climb at this Levantine layout.</p>
<p>Irwin teed off Sunday in the company of the white-blond
Norman, hardly the sort who puts his playing partners in the
spotlight, and through the first 10 holes the pair's gallery
swelled to watch Sharky surge to six under par from two
under. But as Norman faded Irwin reeled off birdies on 11,
12, 13 and 14 -- none on putts of longer than 12 feet.</p>
<p>And on 18, a 440-yard par four, he sank a 45-or-so-foot
birdie putt that gave him a 67 for the day and the lead in
the clubhouse. That so exhilarated him he ran a victory lap
around the green, high-fiving spectators as we went. "Never
ran that far with an interception at {the U. of} Colorado,"
the ex-Buffalo defensive back admitted.</p>
<p>Strange's bid for three in a row died with his Sunday 75,
but two other players made serious runs. Britisher Nick
Faldo, who'd skewered poor Floyd at Augusta, had a 15-footer
to tie Irwin on 18, but it lipped out as Nick bit his. Brown
putted one of about the same length there with about the same
result, although his perspective was different. "Some people
didn't think I'd hold up as far as I did. I wasn't so sure,
either, but I did," grinned the pleased third-placer.</p>
<p>Donald's challenge to Irwin was, of course, the most
serious and sustained. A likable man with a cleft chin, he'd
previously reached public consciousness by capturing the
Anheuser-Busch Classic last year after long and winless
travail, and by following a field-leading 64 in the first
round of this year's Masters with an 82.</p>
<p>"That wasn't a choke -- I just didn't have the game to
follow up my good first round," he said Sunday of that
debacle. "I've worked, and I think now I do."</p>
<p>Donald opened birdie-birdie on Sunday, and would have
negated the playoff if not for his only bogey of the day -- a
five on the 426-yard 16th hole caused by a trapped three-iron
approach. On Monday, he went two strokes up after 12 holes
after a badly pulled wood shot from the rough led to Irwin's
fourth bogey of the afternoon.</p>
<p>But on the par-five 14th Irwin got his first birdie to
match one by Donald, and on 16 he cut the lead to one when a
six-foot putt gave him another. On 18, Donald hit his only
really bad tee shot of the day, and followed it with an
equally bad trap shot that kept him from matching Irwin's
par.</p>
<p>On the decisive 19th, Donald thin-hit a wedge well short,
then putted to within two feet. Irwin planted his wedge shot
eight feet from the pin, and putted true.</p>
<p>"I don't remember hitting it {that last putt}, but I
remember it going in," said the champ. So will lots of
others.</p>
