	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- The House Judiciary Committee sent a
proposed constitutional amendment prohibiting flag
desecration to the full House without recommendation,
signaling possible difficulties for the measure in a vote
that could come as early as tomorrow.
   The action surprised some committee members, who had
earlier predicted that the bill would receive a favorable
recommendation.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The committee was deadlocked 18-18 in an initial vote to
send the amendment to the floor with a negative
recommendation. A second vote, which would have approved the
amendment, failed 19-17 before the committee approved a
motion by Chairman Jack Brooks (D., Texas) to report the bill
without recommendation. The Brooks motion passed 19-17.</p>
<p>The House action comes in the wake of the Supreme Court's
June 11 decision striking down the federal flag-protection
law. Co-sponsored by House Minority Leader Robert Michel (R.,
Ill.) and Rep. Sonny Montgomery (D., Miss.), the amendment
says, "The Congress and the States shall have power to
prohibit the physical desecration of the flag of the United
States."</p>
<p>To become part of the Constitution, the proposed amendment
needs a two-thirds vote in each house of Congress plus
approval by the legislatures of three-fourths of the states.</p>
<p>House Speaker Thomas Foley (D., Wash.) said "it will be a
very close vote." Opponents assert that they are within
striking distance of the 146 votes necessary to block the
amendment. Rep. Robert Kastenmeier (D., Wis.), an opponent,
said his side has picked up 10 or 12 votes in the past week.</p>
<p>The Senate has scheduled a hearing on the amendment for
tomorrow. Sen. Alan Cranston (D., Calif.) said there were 54
Senate votes for the amendment, 24 against and 22 undecided,
with most of the undecideds ready to vote against it.</p>
<p>Democrats on the House committee were eager to bring the
bill to a vote as early as tomorrow. Republicans, sensing
that more time to publicize the issue would create problems
for the Democrats, would like to see a vote next week.</p>
<p>Much of the debate revolved around enforcement and focused
on a preamble elaborating on the amendment. While the
preamble has no constitutional effect, many lawmakers believe
it would influence legislation by which the amendment would
be enforced.</p>
<p>The preamble would designate the flag as "a national
symbol of such stature that it must be kept inviolate." The
document says the amendment would prohibit desecration of the
flag, including the display of the flag in a "contemptuous
manner." Physical desecration, according to the preamble,
would include "burning, mutilating, defacing, defiling or
trampling," but wouldn't be limited to those forms of
desecration.</p>
<p>The committee defeated proposals by Rep. William Hughes
(D., N.J.) that would have limited the definition of
desecration and restricted enforcement of the amendment to
the federal government.</p>
<p>"We should not permit disparate interpretation by the
states and the hundreds of other jurisdictions around the
country," he said. "We should not allow the 50 states to
establish their own views of the flag of the United States."
Mr. Hughes's amendment on federal enforcement failed by a
vote of 26-10.</p>
<p>Retired Supreme Court Justice Lewis Powell joined the
opponents of the proposed amendment. Justice Powell, who left
the court in 1987, signed a statement issued by the Emergency
Committee to Defend the First Amendment, opposing "any effort
to restrict the First Amendment" by amending the
Constitution.</p>
