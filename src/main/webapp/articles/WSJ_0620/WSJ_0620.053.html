	<p class="article-leader">TOKYO -- Japan's gross national product surged an
inflation-adjusted 2.5% in the nation's fiscal fourth
quarter, ended March 31, led by a sharp increase in exports.
   The quarter-to-quarter increase amounted to a strong 10.4%
at an annual rate. In the fiscal year as a whole, Japan's GNP
grew 5%.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"This economy's got an enormous head of steam," said
Kenneth Courtis, senior economist in Tokyo for DB Capital
Markets (Asia) Ltd.</p>
<p>An official at the Economic Planning Agency, which
announced the figures, downplayed the export increase as
reflecting special year-end factors. But the report could
nonetheless spark fears in the U.S. that Japan's external
surpluses may be on the rise again. The most recent quarter
marked the first time since the last quarter of 1984 that
external demand contributed more to Japan's GNP growth than
domestic demand.</p>
<p>"The decline in the {Japanese} surplus probably touched
bottom in the fourth calendar quarter of 1989," Mr. Courtis
said.</p>
<p>In the latest quarter, Japan's exports grew 8.5% from the
previous quarter, while imports edged up 2.1%.</p>
<p>The external sector's contribution to growth for the
quarter was 1.3%, while domestic demand grew 1.2%.</p>
<p>The Economic Planning Agency official said that for all of
fiscal 1990, domestic demand contributed 5.7% to the growth
figures, while external demand weighed in with a negative
0.7%.</p>
<p>When sharp fluctuations over the year are averaged, the
official said, it can still be said that Japan's economic
expansion, now in its 43rd month, continues to be led by
domestic demand.</p>
<p>But, Mr. Courtis said, the yen is 35% cheaper than a year
ago against European currencies. Moreover, economic growth
throughout Asia -- now as important a market for Japan as the
U.S. -- has been faster than expected. "Japan has very
attractive export opportunities into east Asia," Mr. Courtis
said. "Europe is booming. Asia is booming. The slowdown of
the U.S. economy will have less effect than in the past."</p>
<p>The Japanese agency official said the results for the
fiscal fourth quarter show that the instability that Japanese
markets were experiencing at that time had little impact on
the economy.</p>
<p>From January through March, Japanese stock and bond prices
dropped sharply, with the Nikkei stock index falling from a
high of 38915.87 on Dec. 29 to 29980.45 by March 30. At the
same time, the yen weakened to an exchange rate of 157.65 to
the dollar from 143.40 to the dollar.</p>
<p>Personal consumption and private capital expenditures, the
main pillars supporting Japan's current expansion, continued
to grow, though at a less rapid pace than in the previous two
quarters.</p>
<p>Personal consumption rose a slight 0.5% from the previous
quarter, after a 1.6% rise in the October-December quarter
and a 2% advance in the July-September quarter.</p>
<p>Chiharu Sumita, an economist with UBS Philips & Drew in
Tokyo, said the slower growth in consumption and in capital
investment reflects a drop in the recent sharp pace of
economic growth.</p>
<p>But the Economic Planning Agency official said capital
spending remains strong, reflecting increased expenditures
for research and development and the need to cope with an
increasingly serious labor shortage.</p>
