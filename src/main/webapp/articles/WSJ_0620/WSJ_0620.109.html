Jones formed a joint venture for the development of
television, film and music projects. Terms weren't disclosed.
   Time Warner's strategic-development arm, Time Warner
Enterprises, will be the financial backer and a 50% owner of
Quincy Jones Entertainment Co. Time Warner Enterprises also
said it will "support" a second company, Quincy Jones
Broadcasting, which will buy television and radio stations.
The nature of that relationship couldn't be learned.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Quincy Jones Entertainment is producing a new comedy,
"Fresh Prince of Bel Air," for the NBC network for next fall;
it is also making a talk show hosted by Jesse Jackson for
local stations. While Time Warner will fund the venture, Mr.
Jones will run the new company as chairman and chief
executive officer, and he will control all creative matters.
Kevin Wendle, a former executive with Fox Broadcasting Co.,
will be president and chief operating officer of Quincy Jones
Entertainment.</p>

albums as well as produced the records of other artists,
