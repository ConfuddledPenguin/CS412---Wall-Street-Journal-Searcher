	<p class="article-leader">Ever since the big TV networks started allowing 15-second
commercials instead of standard 30-second ads, the number of
short spots has been spiraling out of control. Quietly,
though, some advertisers are starting to abandon 15-second
spots, frustrated by messages that are over almost before
they begin.
   A number of advertisers say they've noticed a flattening
out, and even a decline, in 15-second spots over the past
year.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>That trend has caught the eye of Robert Coen, director of
forecasting for Interpublic Group's McCann-Erickson. In his
annual ad spending forecast last week, Mr. Coen said that
during prime-time, 15-second spots peaked last year at 35% of
all TV ads and that their number has since slipped to 31%. He
said that during daytime, 15-second spots have leveled off in
the past year at 41% of all commercials. He expects those
levels to remain about the same.</p>
<p>"It's too difficult to really get satisfying information
into 15 seconds," explains Roy Grace of Grace & Rothschild, a
New York ad agency. "It's an enormous discipline and it's
very hard to do really terrific `15s.' It truly is on the way
out. Clients don't even talk about them anymore."</p>
<p>Yet the decline masks a split among 15-second commercial
users, only some of whom are abandoning the short ads. When
the networks first began allowing the short spots in 1984,
all sort of advertisers jumped on the bandwagon, especially
small advertisers who couldn't otherwise afford network TV
prices. Those advertisers appear to be the ones who are
abandoning the 15s first, amidst questions about cost and
effectiveness.</p>
<p>The nation's biggest advertisers, on the other hand,
especially packaged goods companies pushing major brand
names, continue to be advocates of the 15-second ads. For
them, the 15s, which generally cost half of a 30-second spot,
are a relatively cheap way to hammer home their household
names. And cost counts at a time when the average prime-time
30-second spot goes for an eye-opening $120,000.</p>
<p>Indeed, at RJR Nabisco's Nabisco Brands brands unit, a
spokeswoman says the use of 15-second spots has been on the
rise for the past three years, especially for its best-known
products, like Oreos and Ritz crackers. It even uses the 15s
for brand extensions, like fudge-covered Oreos and
peanut-butter Ritz Bits.</p>
<p>"Nabisco's products are very well-established, so a
15-second commercial serves to reinforce the product's
message," the spokeswoman says. "People know Oreos, people
know Ritz. The basic product is so ingrained in them that
with a new variety, we can still get the message across in 15
seconds."</p>
<p>At Omnicom's DDB Needham ad agency, Page Thompson,
executive vice president and media director, also doesn't see
a decline. One of the agency's biggest clients, Michelin,
even started using 15-second spots for the first time this
year. The Michelin ad, a shorter version of its long-running
baby campaign, "has a lot of equity in it, and it's a very
simple message, so we were able to convey that in 15s," he
says. "We were able to get a lot more mileage for the
campaign."</p>
<p>For the most part, though, major advertisers are leveling
off on using 15-second spots, while smaller advertisers are
often abandoning them altogether. The networks are partly to
blame; in the past year, they've put more restrictions on
using the short ads. While policies vary from network to
network, some charge a premium for sports or other programs,
while others ban or restrict the use of "bookends" -- two
15-second spots for the same product that air with unrelated
ads sandwiched in between them.</p>
<p>Advertisers, too, have become disenchanted with a
commercial form so short that there's almost no time to grab
viewers' attention. The 15-second ads "started out as a way
for advertisers who couldn't really afford national media to
take advantage of it," says Stacey Lippman, senior vice
president and corporate media director for Chiat/Day/Mojo.
But competition has heated up so much for those advertisers
that "they're willing to forgo the quick hit to stand out
from their competitors" with ads that have "a creative, added
impact."</p>
<p>At Chiat/Day, known as among the most creative agencies,
"I've seen some frustration on the part of creatives in terms
of their ability to get a message out," Mr. Lippman adds.</p>
<p>Betsy Frank, a senior vice president at Saatchi & Saatchi
Advertising, says she has also seen some decline in 15-second
ads. But she notes that they still account for a good third
of all commercials, a potentially worrisome amount,
considering how cluttered the ad environment is already.
Saatchi is about to launch a study of the short spots and,
Ms. Frank notes, "we wouldn't be doing this if we felt it was
no longer an issue."</p>
