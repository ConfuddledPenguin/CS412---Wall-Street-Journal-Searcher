	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Stock prices rebounded slightly from Monday's
sharp drop, again on light volume, while bond prices drifted
lower. The dollar weakened against most major currencies.
   The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 11.38 points to
2893.56. Long-term U.S. Treasury bond prices fell about a
quarter of a point, or $2.50 for each $1,000 of face amount,
in light trading. The dollar fell against the mark and the
yen.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Some analysts speculated that the dollar's weakness was
partly responsible for bond prices not reacting to a report
of yet another decline in housing starts this past month --
further evidence of a sluggish economy -- and declining
prices for oil and other commodities. Bonds also were held
down by a deluge of newly issued municipal and asset-backed
bonds.</p>
<p>The drop in bond prices -- along with more disappointing
earnings news and growing conviction that the Federal Reserve
Board isn't about to ease interest rates -- helped to hold
stock prices to modest gains in tepid trading.</p>
<p>"This is just a reflex rally" following Monday 50-point
drop, said Edward Nicoski, technical research chief at Piper,
Jaffray & Hopwood in Minneapolis. He noted the gains were
confined to blue chips and that the over-the-counter market
fell.</p>
<p>What hurt the dollar is less clear. It has been trading in
narrow ranges recently in the absence of any startling
economic news. Most of the reports showing weakening economic
activity have been in line with expectations, which leaves
currency traders with little to trade on.</p>
<p>Richard Levine, a Merrill Lynch foreign-exchange broker,
said traders are alternately nudging the dollar up to see
where they encounter resistance and easing it down to
determine support levels. Yesterday, the focus was on the
bottom end. "Having failed to take out the overhead
resistance level, they're now probing to see how far it
should go on the down side," Mr. Levine said.</p>
<p>Traders in any market, Mr. Levine added, are most fearful
when their market appears to be drifting along, in no hurry
to rise or fall. "A body at rest tends to stay at rest," he
noted. "They don't want that."</p>
<p>But Lawrence Leuzzi, a managing director at S.G. Warburg
Securities, sees fundamental reasons for some of the dollar's
weakness. The yen rose, he said, because of a report that
Japan's money supply was growing strongly, as did the
nation's output of goods and services in the first period.
The mark was aided by a rise in West German bond yields, he
said.</p>
<p>In major market action:</p>
<p>Stock prices rose in light trading, with 134.9 million
shares changing hands on the New York Stock Exchange.
Advancing issues edged out decliners, 788 to 710.</p>
<p>Bond prices climbed. The yield on the Treasury's benchmark
30-year bond rose to 8.47%.</p>
<p>The dollar eased. In late New York trading, the currency
was quoted at 1.6738 marks and 153.55 yen, compared with
1.6758 marks and 153.66 yen Monday.</p>
