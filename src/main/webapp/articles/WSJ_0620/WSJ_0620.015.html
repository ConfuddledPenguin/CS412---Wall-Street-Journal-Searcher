	<p class="article-leader">TORONTO -- Securities regulators from Ontario and Manitoba
agreed to accept a voluntary payment of about 550,000
Canadian dollars (US$468,270) by James Richardson, a former
government minister, in settlement of proceedings brought
against him on allegations of insider trading.
   The settlement agreement didn't attribute any wrongdoing
to Mr. Richardson. The agreement was reached between Mr.
Richardson's legal counsel and staff members of each of the
provincial securities commissions. Both parties said they
wanted to avoid the lengthy proceedings that could result if
formal charges were brought.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Mr. Richardson, 68 years old, comes from a prominent
Winnipeg, Manitoba, family that made its name and fortune in
grain trading. Mr. Richardson also served as defense minister
in the Liberal Party governments of Pierre Trudeau in the
1970s.</p>
<p>The insider-trading allegations arose from Mr.
Richardson's short-selling of shares of Kingston,
Ontario-based Plastic Engine Technology Corp., which
subsequently went into receivership in April 1989. Regulatory
officials alleged that Mr. Richardson initiated the short
sales after a discussion with a Plastic Engine director about
the company's financial position and the possibility it would
file for bankruptcy-law proceedings. A short sale is the sale
of borrowed stock by an investor who hopes to make a profit
by buying an equal number of shares later at a lower price to
replace the borrowed stock.</p>
<p>As part of the settlement, Mr. Richardson is prohibited
from dealing in securities in Ontario and Manitoba for three
years. He also agreed to pay C$300,000 into a fund that will
be used to compensate people who incurred losses as a result
of the short sales. Mr. Richardson's gross proceeds from the
short sales amounted to C$298,515.</p>
<p>Mr. Richardson also agreed to pay C$100,000 each to the
treasuries of the two provinces and as much as C$50,000 to
cover costs of the provinces' investigation in the case.</p>
