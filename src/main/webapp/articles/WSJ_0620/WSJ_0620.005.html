	<p class="article-leader">CINCINNATI -- Eagle-Picher Industries Inc. said that costs
related to asbestos claims are expected to total about $110
million this year and that it's concerned about a sudden
upturn in the number of such claims being filed.
   The industrial company also reported that in its second
quarter ended May 31 net rose 74% to $22.6 million, or $2.11
a share, from $13 million, or $1.22 a share, a year earlier.
The latest quarter included a gain of $11.9 million, or $1.11
a share, from the sale of a division.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Sales slid about 5% to $184.4 million from $193.1 million.</p>
<p>But despite improvements in operations, especially those
businesses serving the automotive industry, the company said
its asbestos litigation costs remains a "serious problem."</p>
<p>Until the second quarter, the number of new claims had
been decreasing, a trend that the company had expected to
continue. But in the quarter, about 6,200 new claims were
received compared with 4,000 a year earlier and 4,900 in the
1987 quarter, the company said.</p>
<p>In the quarter, the company said it disposed of 3,600
claims, compared with 3,400 a year earlier and 1,500 in the
1988 second quarter. Total costs related to those settlements
were about $31 million for the quarter and $62 million for
the six months.</p>
<p>To fund litigation costs, the company has said it intends
to sell off additional assets, including its trim division
and injection-molding division, which make rubber molded
parts and trim for the automotive industry. "In order to
avoid a severe liquidity problem, the company must complete
the sale of these assets on a timely basis," the company
said.</p>
<p>The company is a defendant in about 62,100 claims stemming
from its manufacture, from 1934 until 1971, of an
asbestos-containing insulating cement used principally in
shipbuilding and refinery construction.</p>
