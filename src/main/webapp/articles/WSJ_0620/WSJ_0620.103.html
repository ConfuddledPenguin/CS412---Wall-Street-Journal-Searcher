	<p class="article-leader">Things are bad all over in real estate. But developers and
real-estate executives say Donald Trump's problems aren't
necessarily typical.
   Mr. Trump's current struggles, they say, are as much a
product of his special circumstances as of conditions in real
estate. Other real-estate moguls don't have casinos causing
them cash-flow problems, or a high profile that puts their
struggles under a microscope.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>That isn't to say there aren't other developers who are
hurting because their own optimism turned out to be
excessive. In general, those who have taken the biggest risks
in recent years have reaped the slimmest rewards. The Wall
Street Journal captured these portraits of where some major
developers stand today.</p>
<p>JOHN C. PORTMAN JR.</p>
<p>John C. Portman Jr. at Portman Cos. shows few signs of
slowing down, in contrast to the Atlanta real-estate market.</p>
<p>The 65-year-old Mr. Portman, who gained international fame
in the 1960s as an innovator in hotel design, last month
opened Shanghai Center in China. The development includes
hotel, office, housing and retail space plus a theater and
exhibition hall. Last weekend, the San Francisco Fashion
Center, a 750,000-square-foot apparel market, opened.</p>
<p>Locally, Portman Cos. is developing the Atlanta Gift Mart,
a 1.5 million-square-foot facility with showrooms for
gift-industry wholesalers, scheduled to open in 1992. The
developer's most ambitious project: a planned 60-story office
tower at Peachtree Center in downtown Atlanta. The $300
million building, with 1.2 million square feet of space, also
expected to be completed in 1992.</p>
<p>Despite his successes in past years, Mr. Portman isn't
without his detractors in Atlanta. With office vacancy rates
here hovering at almost 20% and some 7.5 million square feet
of office space currently under construction, some industry
consultants question whether Mr. Portman will be able to find
enough tenants to fill his 60-story tower.</p>
<p>Mr. Portman wasn't available for comment, but others say
such concerns may be overblown. Leigh Burch III, vice
president at Jamison Research Inc., a real-estate research
firm in Atlanta, expects businesses to absorb about 3.3
million square feet of office space a year through 1995. He
also says vacancy rates in the 1990s for top-of-the-line
buildings should be slightly below what they were in the late
1980s.</p>
<p>"John Portman is a person you never want to bet against,"
says Mr. Burch. "He's defied gravity."</p>
<p>CAMPEAU CORP.</p>
<p>Many analysts say Campeau Corp.'s real-estate holdings
have a positive net worth. But the company has given little
indication in the past year, partly because Canadian
disclosure requirements aren't as stringent as those in the
U.S.</p>
<p>In one of the most spectacular rises and falls in the
ranks of the real-estate moguls, Robert Campeau, 66-year-old
chairman and chief executive officer of Campeau Corp., is on
the brink of losing both the company he built up over 30
years and, possibly, his personal fortune. His highly
leveraged $10.2 billion acquisitions of Allied Stores Corp.
in late 1986 and Federated Department Stores Inc. in May 1988
ended in Chapter 11 filings in January and have endangered
the Toronto-based parent company.</p>
<p>Campeau Corp.'s annual results, due to be released this
week, are expected to show massive write-downs of Campeau's
equity in Federated and Allied. In an effort to stave off
bankruptcy, the company has put up for sale most of its
real-estate holdings, which include prime properties in
Canada. But many analysts say Campeau may have a hard time
getting good prices because the market has softened and he is
in a must-sell situation.</p>
<p>Mr. Campeau, who declined to comment for this article,
faces lawsuits by two banks over $39.2 million Canadian
dollars (US$33.3 million) of personal loans. They have court
approval to seize his assets. He reached an agreement with
the National Bank of Canada to repay C$153 million of debt at
52 cents on the dollar and recoup Campeau securities the bank
seized from him in January. But he needs to come up with C$40
million by the end of this month to get the stock back, which
would return his stake in Campeau to 43% from 21% currently.
To date, Mr. Campeau hasn't indicated that he has financing
for that transaction, nor has he reached similar agreements
with the other two banks.</p>
<p>MORTIMER ZUCKERMAN</p>
<p>"We have skirted the problems that a lot of other people
got into," says Mortimer Zuckerman, chairman of Boston
Properties Inc. and owner of the Atlantic magazine and U.S.
News & World Report.</p>
<p>His closely held company has recently built what he calls
some "low-margin" properties for the federal government in
Washington. "We stopped building on spec three years ago,"
Mr. Zuckerman says. As a result, he says, his company has
just a 2.5% vacancy rate, "no empty buildings and no land to
carry."</p>
<p>Industry executives estimate that Boston Properties owns
12 million square feet of space worth several billion
dollars. Mr. Zuckerman says all of its financing is with
overseas banks, mostly in Japan. He says none of those loans
have had to be renegotiated.</p>
<p>OLYMPIA & YORK</p>
<p>Soft real-estate markets have undoubtedly affected the
fortunes of Olympia & York Developments Ltd., the real-estate
concern closely held by the Reichmann family of Toronto.</p>
<p>Olympia & York owns about 30 million square feet of office
space in the U.S. Three-quarters of that is in Manhattan,
which makes it New York's largest commercial landlord. It
also has prime office buildings in Toronto.</p>
<p>Analysts can't get an accurate fix on Olympia & York's
financial health, mainly because it is closely held. The
Reichmann brothers -- including Paul, 59 years old, seen as
the company's dealmaker and strategist -- shun publicity.</p>
<p>In one of the few public research reports on the Reichmann
empire, Dominion Bond Rating Service of Toronto recently
estimated that its investment portfolio of public companies
in real estate, energy, natural resources, financial services
and transportation has a market value of more than 6.6
billion Canadian dollars (US$5.6 billion). No one, other than
the Reichmanns, some Olympia & York officials and perhaps
some banks, knows to what degree the company's real-estate
operations are leveraged, but Dominion Bond Rating expects
that its assets easily exceed its debt load.</p>
<p>John Zuccotti, president and chief executive officer of
Olympia & York's U.S. unit, Olympia & York Cos. (U.S.A.),
says the company is "doing quite well" given the soft
real-estate market in New York and other U.S. cities where
the Reichmanns own office buildings.</p>
<p>In Manhattan, Olympia & York doesn't have "all its eggs in
one basket," Mr. Zuccotti says. The West Side is in a "very
soft market," but Olympia & York's holdings are mainly on the
East Side, where rents are more stable, he says. "We're
turning over leases at market rents," Mr. Zuccotti says,
though he adds that market rents aren't what they were four
years ago.</p>
<p>Despite Wall Street's problems, the World Financial
Center, the company's premier newer property in downtown
Manhattan, is virtually fully leased, the company says. (One
tenant there is Dow Jones & Co., publisher of this
newspaper.) One Liberty Plaza, recently renovated, is about
96% leased.</p>
<p>At the World Financial Center, Merrill Lynch & Co. gave
back 500,000 square feet, but most of that has been leased,
Mr. Zuccotti says. He says 60 Broad Street, where Drexel
Burnham Lambert Inc. recently vacated 700,000 square feet, is
"a problem," but adds that Olympia & York is working on three
or four leases to rent the space.</p>
<p>Mr. Zuccotti says that after being cautious in the flat
New York market over the past four years, Olympia & York is
prepared to begin "building into an up market in 1994-95."</p>
<p>The company's biggest challenge is its massive Canary
Wharf development in London, where it is building what the
Reichmanns hope will be the city's second financial district.</p>
<p>While work proceeds on the #4 billion ($6.86 billion), 12
million-square-foot development, London faces a glut of
office space and an economy sapped by inflation and high
interest rates. Only five major tenants have leased space in
Canary Wharf so far; just over 35% of the project's first
phase, which comprises 4.5 million square feet and is due for
completion in 1992, has been leased.</p>
<p>But Mr. Zuccotti says there is a strong likelihood that in
the next six months, Olympia & York will announce a
"substantial" number of long-term leases that will help it
reach "critical mass" for the first phase.</p>
<p>CHRISTOPHER H. COLE</p>
<p>Before the Phoenix, Ariz., market collapsed, 37-year-old
real-estate syndicator Christopher H. Cole and his wife,
Sonia, drove matching Rolls-Royces and lived in a swank home
adjacent to the Frank Lloyd Wright-designed Arizona Biltmore.</p>
<p>Today, they've sold their home and traded in the Rollses
for a Ford Bronco. "This is not a game," says Mr. Cole. "It's
been a sad and difficult kind of thing."</p>
<p>Since Phoenix real-estate prices turned down in late 1987,
the market value of 11 downtown commercial sites owned by Mr.
Cole's partnerships has dropped to about $30 million from $70
million, according to Robert Kammrath, whose real-estate
research firm was familiar with the properties. Says Mr.
Kammrath: "His win streak has come to an end."</p>
<p>In March 1989, one of his partnerships defaulted on a $24
million loan from Southwest Savings & Loan, Phoenix, on one
of the downtown sites. Late last year the partnership filed
for bankruptcy protection.</p>
<p>Mr. Cole -- who doesn't dispute Mr. Kammrath's estimates
of the changing value of his downtown properties -- is
struggling to hang on to the parcels, hoping for the market
to pick up again.</p>
<p>Before getting involved in the downtown acquisitions in
the mid-1980s, Mr. Cole had benefited from from several
lucrative transactions in the nearby Scottsdale area,
including one purchase that brought a Cole partnership about
$30 million in profit on a $20 million investment.</p>
<p>Mr. Cole planned to resell the downtown parcels to
developers, or perhaps to develop them himself as high-rise
sites. He planned his investments after spending "hundreds of
thousands on research," he says. Ron Bookbinder, a
real-estate broker who helped arrange most of Mr. Cole's
purchases, says, "His plan was to buy up and control all the
major sites. But he became a victim of the overbuilding of
Phoenix." Brokers today say the city's glut of office space
may not be absorbed for five to seven years.</p>
<p>Mr. Cole says he plans to stick it out. He has kept most
of his partnerships together, convincing investors that it's
in their best interests to wait out the market, too. "I
haven't thrown in the towel, and I won't," says Mr. Cole. "I
had a perfect track record going into this. All of my deals
made a profit."</p>
<p>ROUSE CO.</p>
<p>Rouse Co. has modified its strategy, hoping to avoid some
of the pitfalls that come with the current real-estate
downturn.</p>
<p>The developer, known for such projects as Manhattan's
South Street Seaport, Baltimore's Harborplace, Miami's
Bayside and Portland's Pioneer Place, no longer goes solo on
major ventures. Instead, Rouse now seeks out a joint-venture
partner to share financing costs. Though this approach may
defer and reduce profits somewhat, it reduces risks for the
company, says Catherine Creswell, a real estate analyst at
Alex. Brown & Sons.</p>
<p>In addition, Rouse has slowed the pace of new developments
and is now buying some existing commercial and industrial
properties where it can improve management, upgrade
facilities and lease the space to new tenants to attract
better retail business. It has agreed to buy the Salem Center
in Salem, Oregon, a regional shopping center with four
department stores and an additional 221,000 square feet of
space for small tenants. The company is also refurbishing
some of its existing malls to help them remain competitive
with retailing areas in the surrounding area.</p>
<p>Rouse posted a loss of $603,000 for the first quarter,
compared with net income of $1.2 million a year earlier. But
its cash flow from its operating properties minus land sales
rose 19% to $14.1 million. The first-quarter loss stemmed
partly from a drop in land sales in the Baltimore-Washington
area, where the company has extensive holdings.</p>
<p>TRAMMELL CROW</p>
<p>Trammell Crow Co., like other national real-estate
developers based in Texas, has spent much of the past two
years restructuring debt and trimming operations.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, Trammell Crow Co., which comprises the
office, retail and industrial development divisions of the
business founded by Trammell Crow, completed a $456 million
refinancing of several of its Southwest properties, the most
troubled in the company's $15 billion portfolio.</p>
<p>The refinancing enabled the Crow company to pay off about
30 separate lenders and concentrate its debt with a longtime
financing partner, Equitable Real Estate Investment
Management Inc. Other Crow company debts are being
restructured, but the Equitable deal took care of the bulk of
the company's troubled properties.</p>
<p>Trammell Crow is focusing its attention on an internal
retrenchment that involves closing some development offices,
consolidating its 90 divisional offices to fewer than 75 and,
most significantly, shifting emphasis from speculative
development to property management.</p>
<p>"We're in a metamorphosis from doing deals to a management
business," says Trammell Crow managing partner J. McDonald
Williams. The change, he says, won't put the company at a
competitive disadvantage because "there aren't any other
people doing {speculative} deals."</p>
<p>GALBREATH CO.</p>
<p>Big Midwest real estate concerns don't have problems
similar to Mr. Trump's, both because they didn't take similar
risks and because Midwest real estate hasn't gone through the
same gyrations as in the Northeast and Southwest.</p>
<p>"We've been pretty conservative, securing anchor tenants
and pre-leasing most of the space before we build," says
Daniel M. Galbreath, president of Galbreath Co., Columbus,
Ohio.</p>
<p>Even so, his company is feeling the effects of speculative
building by other developers, which has depressed rents in
some areas, and of tighter credit. "The banks and savings and
loans are basically out of the market" for construction
loans, Mr. Galbreath says. "We are looking to pension funds,
overseas investors and other sources of financing." As a
result, there isn't a lot of new building, he says.</p>
<p>"We have one suburban project that's a build-to-suit
situation," Mr. Galbreath says. "The tenants are already
lined up. But the lenders still want equity from us." That
and other demands have prevented an agreement on financing,
and the company hasn't started building yet.</p>
<p>"Very high quality, pre-leased office building
construction still is going to be OK," Mr. Galbreath says.
"But there won't be much speculative building. Everyone in
the industry will have to tighten our belts." He says
Galbreath hasn't made layoffs among its permanent staff.</p>
<p>Galbreath Co. also plans to do more construction for other
parties, either governmental agencies or major companies that
want a building for their own use. "Our primary thrust has
been to build where we have equity in the project," Mr.
Galbreath says. But with such situations more difficult to
finance, the company will do more contract building, he says.</p>
<p>JMB REALTY CORP.</p>
<p>Closely held JMB Realty Corp., the real-estate investment
giant headed by co-founders Neil G. Bluhm and Judd D. Malkin,
is widely considered to be in a strong financial position.</p>
<p>The company's continued health in a turbulent real-estate
environment is due in large part to its access to
institutional funds, which reduces its dependence on borrowed
funds.</p>
<p>JMB is "very well capitalized" and remains in a "very
solid position," says one institutional investment partner,
who asks not to be named.</p>
<p>JMB's disciplined bidding posture is also said to be a
factor in its soundness. The company often considers bidding
when high-profile properties become available, but buys only
if it likes the price. Last year JMB was among those looking
at but not buying Campeau Corp.'s Bloomingdale's operation;
it made a multibillion-dollar bid for Hilton Hotels Corp. but
was rebuffed after it refused to raise its offer.</p>
<p>But the company, one of the largest shopping-center owners
in North America and owner-operator of some giant commercial
properties, is willing to put its money down: JMB paid about
$2 billion for Toronto developer Cadillac Fairview in 1987
and $920 million in 1988 for Amfac Inc. of Hawaii. It also is
general partner in the limited partnership under which the
California Public Employees Retirement System last year paid
$398 million for a 20% stake in Santa Fe Pacific Corp.'s
real-estate holdings.</p>
