	<p class="article-leader">CHICAGO -- The average managed commodity fund lost 5.8% in
May, according to Norwood Securities, which tracks the
performance of 133 publicly offered commodity funds.
   Jay Klopfenstein, Norwood president, said a sharp rally in
U.S. Treasury bond futures in the first week of May caused
"many fund managers to suffer severe losses." He said many
managers were short bond futures, which had been in a steady
downtrend since peaking last December.</p>
