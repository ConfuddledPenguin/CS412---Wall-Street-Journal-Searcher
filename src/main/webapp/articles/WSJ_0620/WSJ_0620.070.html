	<p class="article-leader">Since the advent of Earth Day in 1970, the environmental
movement has been characterized by such mainstream groups as
the Sierra Club and the Audubon Society. Some are more pushy
than others; some are less willing to accommodate alternative
uses of public lands. But all are committed to the democratic
process.
   Today, however, an increasing number of environmental
activists are unwilling to compromise, despite their past
successes. Instead, they are taking the advice of Dave
Foreman, founder of Earth First], who recently urged the
readers of Mother Jones to commit civil disobedience: "You
know what you can do. Do it."</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Once that would have meant the sort of disruptive but
nonviolent protests that Earth First] is scheduled to begin
today as part of a summer-long campaign to halt timbering in
northern California. However, despite their protestations to
the contrary, some may be moving toward violent activities.
Late last month two Earth First] activists were arrested in
Oakland after a pipe bomb in their car exploded; both have
been active in anti-logging activities and are being
investigated in connection with the bombing of a nearby
lumber mill earlier in the month. (They deny knowledge of the
bomb and claim someone was trying to assassinate them.) Mr.
Foreman is facing trial, along with three others, for
allegedly conspiring to down several electrical transmission
towers.</p>
<p>Ecoterrorism first gained notoriety in the early 1970s,
when a lone environmental activist, "the Fox," engaged in a
sustained campaign of eco-sabotage, or ecotage, against
Chicago-area firms. The late Edward Abbey romanticized
ecoterrorism in his 1975 novel, "The Monkey Wrench Gang," in
which four people roam the West wreaking unimaginable havoc.
Mr. Abbey became a spiritual adviser to radical
environmentalists: "If opposition is not enough, we must
resist. And if resistance is not enough, then subvert," he
said.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, there was no formal structure for ecoteurs
until 1981, when Mr. Foreman, a former lobbyist for the
Wilderness Society, created Earth First]. Although the
organization does not formally engage in ecotage, Mr. Foreman
conceded shortly after its formation that it was intended "to
inspire others to carry out activities straight from the
pages of `The Monkey Wrench Gang.'" Mr. Foreman has also
written two editions of "Ecodefense: A Field Guide to
Monkeywrenching," which offers detailed advice on how to
drive spikes into trees to shatter chain saws and sawmill
blades; scatter caltrops on roads to flatten tires; disable
construction equipment; pull up mining markers and survey
stakes; and fell powerlines, which, explains Mr. Foreman,
"are highly vulnerable to monkeywrenching from individuals or
small groups."</p>
<p>Last year the Mountain States Legal Foundation established
an ecotage hotline, which recorded sabotage in California,
Colorado, Idaho, Nevada, Oregon and Washington. Tree spiking
-- which almost killed a mill worker struck by a shattered
saw blade in 1987 -- seems relatively common in the
Northwest. So is sabotage against construction and timbering
equipment. A cross-country motor-cross race was halted when
garroting wire was strung at neck level. Ski lifts have been
vandalized, and other examples abound. Public officials play
down the importance of ecoterrorism, but Mr. Foreman argues
that they are trying "to keep it quiet" because reporting
such activities "would only encourage similar acts by many
more of the millions of Americans who are strongly against
the rape of what's left of our wilderness."</p>
<p>Of course, not everyone who is outraged over, say,
government-subsidized timbering, which is both
environmentally destructive and financially wasteful, engages
in ecotage. Underlying the activities of many ecoteurs is the
philosophy of "Deep Ecology," which places the preservation
of nature above the promotion of humankind. In a sense it is
a move back to pantheism, with the belief that nature is
sacred. Mr. Foreman, for one, has attacked the
"anthropocentric" philosophy of the West, arguing that the
"wilderness has a right to exist for its own sake." He views
monkeywrenching as "a form of worship toward the earth. It's
really a very spiritual thing to go out and do."</p>
<p>Adequate legal penalties are a necessary part of any
effort to combat ecoterrorism. Yet Western forest and range
lands are too sparsely populated to be well defended against
determined ecoterrorists. The best response is more subtle --
environmentalist, community, business and political leaders
need to reinforce the basic belief, held by most
environmentalists, that violence is not justified as a means
of overturning defeats in the political arena, and that the
protection of human life remains people's paramount
responsibility.</p>
<p>Particularly important is the role of environmental
groups. Since they are committed to many of the same goals as
Earth First], they have a special duty to discourage violence
in the name of the environment (as has Natural Resources
Defense Council attorney Robert Kennedy, for example).</p>
<p>Moreover, pork-minded legislators need to abandon the sort
of spendthrift and ruinous management policies that have
rightly angered many environmentalists. Land should be
privatized and subsidies ended. That abuses exist is no
excuse for violence, but reforming current policy would
reduce people's incentive to violate the law.</p>
<p>With groups apparently prepared to bomb sawmills, down
electrical towers, and decapitate cyclists -- and ads being
placed for terminally ill volunteers to launch kamikaze
attacks on dams -- ecoterrorism can no longer be dismissed as
minor. We risk the development of an ecological guerrilla
movement, one ready even to kill, unless all participants in
the political process reaffirm the importance of both
nonviolence and human life.</p>
