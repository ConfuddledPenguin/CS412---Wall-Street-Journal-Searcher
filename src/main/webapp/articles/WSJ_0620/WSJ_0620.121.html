	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Yields on certificates of deposit at major
banks and brokerage firms fell slighly in the week that ended
yesterday.
   Average yields on small-denomination CDs sold directly by
banks were flat to down slightly. The average yield on a
one-year consumer CD eased to 7.85% from 7.87%, while the
five-year CD average dipped to 8.09% from 8.11%, according to
an 18-bank survey by Banxquote Money Markets, an information
service here.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>While none of the banks in the survey offered a yield as
high as 9%, investors can still find consumer CDs at some
banks that yield that much or more.</p>
<p>Average yields on small-denomination CDs sold by leading
broker dealers were mixed. The average yield on six-month CDs
slipped to 8.17% from 8.27%, while the average for two-year
CDs remained at 8.30%, according to Banxquote.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, average yields for large-denomination CDs,
which typically require deposits of $90,000 or more, were
down slightly. The average yield on one-year jumbo CDs dipped
to 7.90% from 7.98%, while five-year maturities eased to
8.22% from 8.25%.</p>
<p>"Because banks are now reducing their loan portfolios,
they are not hungry for cash in order to make new loans.
That's why they can afford to lower their CD rates," said
Norberto Mehl, chairman of Banxquote. He said he expects the
pattern to continue for the foreseeable future.</p>
