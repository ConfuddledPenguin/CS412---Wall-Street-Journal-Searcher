	<p class="article-leader">The New Jersey Casino Control Commission said it will hold
a hearing July 24 to consider whether to change its rule
limiting "passive" institutional investing in casinos.
   Currently, anyone owning more than 5% of a publicly traded
casino company is subject to the commission's controls. But
representatives of the casino industry have said such a rule
restricts outside investment in their companies.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>In a statement, the commission's acting chairwoman,
Valerie H. Armstrong, said she doesn't believe the rule
serves as a disincentive to outside investment but said she
ordered the hearing "to allow the casino industry, the
investment community, the attorney general's office and other
interested parties an opportunity to be heard."</p>
