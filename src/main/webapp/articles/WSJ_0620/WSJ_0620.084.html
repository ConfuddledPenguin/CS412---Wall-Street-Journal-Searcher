	<p class="article-leader">TOKYO -- A fourth Japanese concern acknowledged purchasing
advanced U.S. aerospace software that allegedly was exported
without proper licensing.
   Mitsubishi Research Institute Inc. said it purchased the
software package from Plume Technology Inc., a small Los
Angeles defense contractor. Last week, a Plume executive,
Ronald Hoffman, was arrested for illegally exporting the
software, designed for the U.S. Strategic Defense Initiative
program.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>An institute spokesman declined to say for what purpose
the software was acquired. "We bought it because it was
interesting," the spokesman said. "That's all we can say."
The spokesman didn't know whether the institute dealt
directly with Mr. Hoffman.</p>
<p>The institute, an independent entity, is affiliated with
the Mitsubishi Group, one of Japan's most powerful industry
families. Another member of the group, Mitsubishi Heavy
Industries Ltd., and two other companies, Nissan Motor Co.
and Ishikawajima-Harima Heavy Industries Co., on Monday
confirmed purchasing the software. The Japanese purchases
were made between 1986 and 1989.</p>
<p>The companies confirm that they purchased the software,
known as the Contam system, but insist that they had no
knowledge of its use in the so-called Star Wars program.
Moreover, they assert that they obtained all necessary import
licenses from the Japanese government. The purchasers say
they were taken by surprise by the allegations against Mr.
Hoffman.</p>
<p>In addition, Mitsubishi Corp., the giant trading house
that served as middleman for Mitsubishi Heavy in the
purchase, and Kyokuto Boeki Kaisha Ltd., a small trading firm
that played the same role for Nissan, also said that they
followed normal importing procedures and didn't know the
software was restricted. The trading houses and IHI, which
purchased the software without a middleman, said they were
offered the technology by Mr. Hoffman, who was representing
Plume Technology.</p>
<p>"As you know, export permission is the seller's
responsibility," said a spokesman for Mitsubishi Corp. "We
have no means to check whether they obtained the export
permission or not. This is a fact of international trade. We
are responsible for the procedures on the Japan side."</p>
<p>Kyokuto Boeki and IHI also asserted it was Plume's
responsibility to obtain U.S. export permits, and it wouldn't
be possible in Japan to verify whether they were obtained. A
spokesman for Kyokuto Boeki added that Plume had requested
the necessary documentation for export licenses.</p>
<p>Mitsubishi Heavy and IHI say they are employing the Contam
package in the development of the Japan Experimental Module,
slated to be part of a space station the U.S. will launch
later this decade. Nissan said it is using the software to
create simulation models for rocket-engine development.</p>
<p>In an affidavit filed in federal court in Los Angeles, the
U.S. government said the Contam software was designed to
analyze the exhaust trail of missiles in flight, an important
part of SDI research.</p>
<p>In Tokyo, the U.S. Embassy said that "the investigation is
continuing in an effort to determine culpability on the part
of other persons involved in the scheme."</p>
