	<p class="article-leader">CHERNOBYL'S CONTINUING AGONY</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The Soviet republic of Byelorussia appealed for
international help to relocate and medically treat more than
two million people affected by the 1986 Chernobyl nuclear
accident.</p>
<p>Byelorussia got 70% of the fallout from Chernobyl.
One-fifth of Byelorussia's more than 10 million people have
to be moved from areas contaminated by radiation, said Victor
Borovikov, a diplomat from Byelorussia.</p>
<p>Speaking in Brussels, Mr. Borovikov said people were paid
by the Soviet authorities to stay in the contaminated zones
immediately after the accident, but they now are demanding
immediate relocation. "We have no experience in this field,
which is why we're asking for international help," he said.</p>
<p>A major relocation problem: Mr. Borovikov said people in
uncontaminated areas don't "want to accept the newcomers.
They tell their children not to play with the children of the
newcomers."</p>
<p>PHILIPPINE AIRLINES SCANDAL</p>
<p>The Philippines' solicitor general has asked Philippine
Airlines to investigate "highly scandalous anomalies" that he
said may have cost the state-run airline more than two
billion pesos ($89.3 million) since 1981. Solicitor General
Francisco Chavez, a member of the airline board, said the
alleged irregularities included missing airline parts and
overpayments to travel agents.

<p>NORWEGIAN BROADCAST STRIKE</p>
<p>Journalists at Norsk Rikskringkasting, Norway's national
radio and television authority, began a strike over a wage
dispute. During the strike, NRK radio plans to broadcast
mostly music and have only four news bulletins daily, instead
of hourly newscasts. TV newscasts will be replaced by movies
and reruns. Television officials said they would continue to
broadcast World Cup soccer games but without Norwegian
commentary.</p>
<p>U.S. RETURNS OKINAWA LAND</p>
<p>The U.S. has agreed to return to Japan some land used by
U.S. military bases on the Japanese island of Okinawa. A
report by the U.S.-Japan Joint Committee on Realignment and
Consolidation of U.S. Forces Facilities on Okinawa said land
totaling about 2,500 acres in 23 sites will be returned. The
schedule for the return is subject to local negotiation and
further discussions by the two governments, the Japanese
Foreign Ministry announced. The land being returned makes up
only 2.5% of the acreage taken up by U.S. military bases on
Okinawa.</p>
<p>COMMUNISM IN SOUTH AFRICA</p>
<p>The South African Communist Party said it would relaunch
itself officially next month after four decades underground.
General Secretary Joe Slovo told the party's first news
conference in South Africa since 1950 that its leadership
would be presented publicly at a July 19 rally in
Johannesburg's Soweto black township. Speaking about the
retreat of communism in Eastern Europe, Mr. Slovo said, "A
communist party worthy of the name cannot constitutionally
entrench its leading role -- it must earn it daily."</p>
<p>CHINA PREPARES FOR A CENSUS</p>
<p>In preparing to count its billion-plus population next
month, China has drafted nearly seven million census workers.
Hundreds of thousands of centers have been set up to teach
the workers how to conduct the world's biggest head count,
which begins July 1 and is scheduled to take about 10 days.
In addition, millions more Chinese have been mobilized to
hang banners in the streets and otherwise popularize the
slogan, "The population census -- everyone is responsible."</p>
<p>EAST GERMAN UNEMPLOYMENT</p>
<p>Nearly two million jobs could be lost in East Germany
after the currency and economic union between the two
Germanys takes effect July 1, Economics Minister Helmut
Haussmann said.</p>
<p>But he said job losses would be a short-term phenomenon,
as many workers would be quickly retrained for other work.
Job losses for East Germans in inefficient state-run
industries that were modernized or shut down would be offset
by the expected creation of some 500,000 new jobs this year
in new small and medium-sized private companies.</p>
<p>"This is a transitional unemployment which will be
associated with active training measures," Mr. Haussmann
said. During the transition, West Germany would provide
start-up aid for a new unemployment-insurance system that
would become self-financing when East German workers start
paying regular contributions.</p>
<p>When East Germany was under communist rule, unemployment
didn't officially exist. But Mr. Haussmann estimated hidden
unemployment there at 15% of the work force, saying this was
the number of people with artificial or do-nothing jobs in
the public sector.</p>
<p>POSTSCRIPTS . . .</p>
<p>Interviewed in Paris, novelist Mario Vargas Llosa said he
is back to writing after his defeat in Peru's presidential
election last week. "My compatriots have returned me to
literature," he said. . . . Iran has asked Turkey to halt
screenings of the U.S. movie "The Naked Gun" because it mocks
the late Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini. A Turkish official said
the government was considering whether it was possible to
edit out the segment featuring a Khomeini look-alike with a
spiked punk hairdo under his turban.</p>
