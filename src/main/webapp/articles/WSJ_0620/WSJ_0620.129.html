	<p class="article-leader">TSR Inc. said it expects to post pretax profit of $760,000
in its fiscal first quarter ending Aug. 31 as a result of a
payment from American Express Bank Ltd., but a pretax loss
for the year.
   TSR, a Hauppauge, N.Y., computer software and
information-services concern, said American Express Bank, a
unit of American Express Co., will exercise an option to end
TSR's management contract for data processing services a year
early. TSR will receive about $500,000 for the management
contract through August 1991, its scheduled expiration.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>It also will receive the fair market value for certain
equipment of its data center facility, which it will turn
over to American Express Bank. A spokesman for American
Express said the move was related to cost savings.</p>
<p>James Hughes, TSR vice president, said the company paid
about $3.5 million for the equipment several years ago. As a
result of the transactions, TSR said it expects to receive
$1.3 million, which will be recognized in the fiscal first
quarter. Because of this and losses in TSR's continuing
operations in consulting, it said it expects to post
"significant losses" for the remaining three fiscal quarters.
Those losses will more than offset the income recognized in
the first quarter, TSR said.</p>
