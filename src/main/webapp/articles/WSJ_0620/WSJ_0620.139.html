	<p class="article-leader">H.J. Heinz Co., citing increased prices of its food
products, reported that fiscal fourth-quarter net income
increased nearly 16% as sales rose about 4%.
   In the quarter ended May 2, net was $135.3 million, or 51
cents a share, compared with $117.2 million, or 44 cents a
share, a year earlier.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Sales were $1.69 billion, up from $1.63 billion. Sales
gains of products such as ketchup and tuna were offset by
declines in other products, the company said in Pittsburgh.</p>
<p>For the year, profit jumped nearly 15% to $504.5 million,
or $1.90 a share, from $440.2 million, or $1.67 a share.
Sales rose nearly 5%, to $6.09 billion from $5.8 billion.
Growth came from both price increases and volume gains,
especially from Heinz's major brands, the company said.</p>
