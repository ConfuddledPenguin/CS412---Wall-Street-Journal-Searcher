	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- Federal Judge Stanley Sporkin concluded an
unusual "minitrial" in Charles Keating's suit to recover
Lincoln Savings & Loan Association, saying, "It's up to me,
and I'm going to ponder it."
   After 30 days of testimony that looked at a small sample
of Lincoln's real estate developments and securities
investments, Judge Sporkin has three choices: He can uphold
the government's April 1989 seizure of the thrift, return the
thrift or order a full trial.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The government and Mr. Keating remained fiercely at odds
yesterday as final arguments were heard over Mr. Keating's
suit challenging the takeover. Lincoln was the principal
subsidiary of Phoenix, Ariz.-based American Continental
Corp., of which Mr. Keating is chairman.</p>
<p>Mr. Keating charged that incompetent regulators carried
out a "vendetta" against him and smothered Lincoln with
unfair regulation because it didn't operate like a
traditional thrift. The government says Mr. Keating and his
business colleagues crafted sham transactions that allowed
them to drain tens of millions of dollars from Lincoln that
was paid to American Continental and then to Mr. Keating and
his associates in salaries and dividends.</p>
<p>Mr. Sporkin didn't indicate when he plans to make a
decision in the case.</p>
