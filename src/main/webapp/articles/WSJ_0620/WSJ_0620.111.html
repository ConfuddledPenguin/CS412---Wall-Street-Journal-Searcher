	<p class="article-leader">LOUISVILLE, Ky. -- Thomas Industries Inc., citing softer
than expected U.S. residential and commercial construction,
said it expects second-quarter profit to fall 20% to 30% from
43 cents a share a year earlier.
   But the producer of lighting products, compressors and
pumps said sales are expected to top the year-earlier $112.5
million.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Thomas said that the second-half outlook is uncertain but
that earnings for the year are expected to meet or exceed
1989 levels, adjusted for non-recurring gains.</p>
<p>In 1989, Thomas earned $20.6 million, or $2.02 a share, on
sales of $436.6 million. Included were non-recurring gains of
$7.4 million, or 75 cents a share.</p>
<p>In addition to the U.S. construction slowdown, Thomas said
it has been hurt by a construction trade strike in Canada
that has weakened demand for its lighting products. Also, it
said, it has been hurt by strong competitive pricing
pressures.</p>
<p>However, the company said it has been increasing its
lighting sales and market share. It added that the compressor
and pump markets are buffering it somewhat from the cyclical
swings in the construction industry.</p>
<p>In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday,
Thomas closed at $17, down $1.</p>
