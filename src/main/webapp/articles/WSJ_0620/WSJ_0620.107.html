	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- A Food and Drug Administration advisory
committee recommended approving a test kit that would
facilitate hormonal therapy for breast cancer.
   The kit, which will be marketed only to clinical
laboratories, is intended to measure a woman's response, or
likelihood of response, to hormonal therapy, which is a less
traumatizing alternative to chemotherapy.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The test kit, known as an enzyme immunoassay, is
manufactured by Abbott Laboratories, North Chicago, Ill. It
will be marketed under the product name Abbott PGR-EIA.</p>
<p>The advisory committee said the kit "is only to be used as
an adjunct" to other methods of measuring the progress of
breast cancer tumors, an FDA official said.</p>
