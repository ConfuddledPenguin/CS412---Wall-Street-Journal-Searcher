	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Kenneth R. Leibler, president of the American
Stock Exchange for the past 4 1/2 years and one of the
best-knownfigures in the securities industry, is leaving the
Amex for a top job at Liberty Financial Cos. in Boston.
   Mr. Leibler, 41 years old, was passed over last October
when the stock exchange brought in former Congressman James
R. Jones to succeed longtime chairman Arthur Levitt Jr.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Mr. Leibler will assume the new position of president and
chief operating officer at Liberty Financial, a unit of
Liberty Mutual Insurance Co. Among the eight Liberty
Financial operating companies he'll run are Stein Roe &
Farnham and Liberty Asset Management moneymanagement
companies, with combined assets under management of $15
billion, and the insurer Keystone Provident Life. Mr. Leibler
will report to Sam Marinella, chief executive officer of
Liberty Financial.</p>
<p>Mr. Jones said Mr. Leibler's departure -- which apparently
caught the Amex by surprise -- is a "big loss" for the
exchange, which is a tiny stock market compared with the New
York Stock Exchange, but which has become one of the
country's major options markets. Mr. Jones said no decision
has been made about a successor or about whether a search
committee will be formed.</p>
<p>The youngest president of a securities exchange when he
took over as Amex president in 1986, Mr. Leibler has worked
at the Amex for most of his career, starting with an
entry-level job in the options division 15 years ago. Joseph
Hardiman, president of the National Association of Securities
Dealers, praised him yesterday for his knowledge of markets.</p>
<p>For his part, Mr. Leibler said yesterday that he is
looking forward to the "much broader management capacity" of
his new job. "There's no doubt that when I got to this
position at age 36, this wasn't something I would do for the
next 30 years."</p>
<p>He hopes the move allows him the chance for a short
vacation to indulge in his "two major passions" -- vegetable
gardening and collecting wine. He also has a passion for
business, of course. One day, "I hope to get a vineyard and
combine them all," Mr. Leibler said.</p>
<p>It has been an active time in the executive suites of
major exchanges. The New York Stock Exchange's chairman, John
J. Phelan Jr., also plans to step down later this year.</p>
