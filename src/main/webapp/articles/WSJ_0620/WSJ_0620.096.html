	<p class="article-leader">Parental skittishness over the DPT vaccine may be helping
foster a recent resurgence of whooping cough, some health
experts fear.
   Last year, there were 3,745 cases in the U.S. This year,
incidence of the disease is running 38% higher than that, and
epidemics have struck upstate New York, Massachusetts, Ohio,
Colorado and California. Some U.S. authorities fear a repeat
of the situation in England a few years ago, when sharply
lower immunization rates led to a six-year epidemic of
104,000 whooping-cough cases and nearly 400 deaths. There,
hospitals had to open special whooping-cough clinics before
the government began promoting vaccinations again.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>In the U.S., there is a mounting battle over parental
rights as some parents refuse to immunize their children.
Their fears stem from stories of every parent's worst
nightmare.</p>
<p>One such instance occurred when Janet Ciotoli, an
Endicott, N.Y., nurse, took her healthy two-month-old son,
Richard Anthony, for his first DPT shot, the standard
vaccination against diphtheria, pertussis and tetanus. A
violent reaction to the vaccine for pertussis, the formal
name for whooping cough, turned Richard's leg red, then
purple. Thirty-three hours after the shot, he became
unresponsive, limp and ice cold. "Five minutes later, my son
died in my arms," says Ms. Ciotoli.</p>
<p>Although such tragedies are extremely rare -- of 3.5
million babies immunized for pertussis each year in the U.S.,
only perhaps three dozen develop cases of brain damage or
death -- growing numbers of parents are beginning to compare
such palpable evidence of the shot's danger with what they
see as the more-remote risks of the ravages of whooping
cough. The No. 1 baby killer in the 1920s and '30s, pertussis
reached a low of 1,248 cases and six deaths in this country
in 1981, raising hopes the disease was near eradication here.</p>
<p>The Atlanta-based Centers for Disease Control says it
calculates that as many as 95% of school-age children have
been immunized with the five-shot DPT series. But it notes
that more parents are refusing to immunize their children on
philosophical or religious grounds. Some are campaigning to
relax state vaccination requirements. Further, the agency
says, sales of a "DT" vaccine, without the pertussis
component, are on the rise while conventional DPT sales are
slipping.</p>
<p>"People are really shying away from this vaccine," says
Fritz Dixon, epidemiologist for Idaho, which no longer
mandates immunization of schoolchildren for pertussis, as
required by 41 other states.</p>
<p>And as the level of immunized U.S. preschoolers slips
toward the 80% rate conducive to epidemics -- a trend
exacerbated by overburdened immunization efforts in inner
cities -- a new hard-line position by medical authorities is
intensifying a ferocious debate over parents' rights.</p>
<p>The American Medical Association has called on states to
revoke any rights parents may now have to object on
philosophical or religious grounds to vaccinations. A bill
pending in Michigan would bar philosophical exemptions, an
option already revoked in Delaware and Montana. Authorities
are also pushing for better enforcement of existing laws. In
West Virginia, one of two states denying both religious and
philosophical exemptions, eight-year-old Fred Shiflett has
been barred since last fall from school in the town of
Romney, and the Hampshire County school district has sued his
father, who fears the pertussis vaccine. Police arrested
Fred's father because of his child's truancy.</p>
<p>"In the case of contagious diseases that are preventable
and not treatable, you have to do things that impinge on
people's rights," argues Lucy Osborn, a University of Utah
professor of pediatrics.</p>
<p>"The state can't tell me to do something that may be
harmful to my child," counters Elisa Leavitt, a Boca Raton,
Fla., housewife. She lobbied for a parents-initiated state
bill to allow exemptions to shots on philosophical grounds.
In Arizona, where 400 whooping-cough cases in 1989 led to
legislation requiring written medical confirmation of shots
for public school children, an anti-shot parent group,
Arizona Citizens for Health Education, got an amendment to
the bill requiring the state's exemption rights to be posted
in schools.</p>
<p>And a Vienna, Va.-based group, Dissatisfied Parents
Together, lobbied successfully for laws in Maryland, West
Virginia and New Jersey requiring the vaccine's risks to be
disclosed to parents, and for a federal law requiring the
U.S. to issue soon a pamphlet on benefits and risks.</p>
<p>New efforts are expected in states where pertussis
inoculation rates are dropping. In Utah in 1988,
whooping-cough immunizations among two-year-olds fell to 59%
from 78% between 1980 and 1985 and nearly a third of
non-immunizing parents expressed concerns about the vaccine.</p>
<p>Lately, some academics have stepped up efforts to debunk
previous studies strongly linking the pertussis shot to brain
damage or death. But some of those opposed to the vaccine
counter that academic experts on the other side often are
being paid as consultants by pertussis vaccine makers. They
assert that these days the disease is milder and less life
threatening and that proper sanitation and nutrition provide
immunity enough from whooping cough, a disease that in
extreme cases ruptures small blood vessels in the brain.</p>
<p>By most measures the vaccine, developed in 1906, is crude;
it includes the whole, killed pertussis organism and its
powerful toxins, not just immunity-producing antigens. A 1981
study by the University of California at Los Angeles showed
that one in 1,750 children will suffer a convulsion after the
shot, a reaction rate termed "extraordinarily high" by UCLA
neurology and pediatrics specialist Ronald S. Gabriel.
Another study, at New York's University of Rochester, found
some type of negative reaction, perhaps minor but still
measurable, in 80% of children vaccinated. In a sense,
Congress acknowledged the shot's risks in 1986 by authorizing
an excise tax on shot sales to create a trust fund for
parents of victims of negative reactions to the vaccine. (So
far, $50.1 million has been dispensed in 77 cases.)</p>
<p>Also, the vaccine only takes hold in 70% to 90% of
children, and because it can't be administered after the age
of seven, immunity wears off in the early teens. In 1988,
Arizona health authorities found that of children one to four
years old contracting whooping cough, 71% had received some
or all their pertussis shots.</p>
<p>"This shot is not ideal," says Douglas Reynolds, vice
president, marketing, of Connaught Laboratories Inc., a
Swiftwater, Pa., DPT vaccine maker. But he says it's unclear
what's needed for a better, cost-effective vaccine.</p>
<p>One alternative Japanese vaccine was found by a University
of Rochester researcher to be more effective and to cause
negative reactions in only 5% of babies. Lederle
Laboratories, a unit of Wayne, N.J.-based American Cyanamid
Co., the vaccine's largest maker, says it hopes to market a
Japanese shot. But the National Institutes of Health, which
is launching a four-year clinical trial on safer shots, says
none will be available for several years.</p>
<p>That angers Art Kline, who recently stopped immunizing his
32-month-old daughter and 13-month-old son with a pertussis
vaccine he calls a "medical time bomb." Says the Dallas real
estate agent: "I am confused, angry and scared. I have two
beautiful babies. . . . They deserve a questioning, probing
parent." The chances of their getting whooping cough, he
says, are "so remote, it's not worth my injecting toxins into
their bodies. I don't know that what I am doing is a threat
to the public health."</p>
<p>Barbara Shepherd, a De Land, Fla., free-lance journalist
who immunized her children for diphtheria and tetanus but not
pertussis, agrees, even though her youngest child got
whooping cough last year. "Not immunizing has been the
toughest child-raising decision I have made." But, she adds:
"We have gone overboard with medical technology. We give {the
vaccine} to our kids blindly, even if the disease isn't life
threatening."</p>
<p>Phoenix, Ariz., mother Lisa Regalado doesn't agree. Two
months ago Ms. Regalado's one-week-old baby, Cristina, began
to cough. Her mother's touch sent her into bronchial spasms,
and laying her down caused her to turn blue. At four weeks,
Cristina's lungs broke down and her heart stopped. "I think
all children should be vaccinated. Parents should not have
any choice," Ms. Regalado says.</p>
