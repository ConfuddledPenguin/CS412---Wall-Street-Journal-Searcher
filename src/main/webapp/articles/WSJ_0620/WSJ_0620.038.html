	<p class="article-leader">A study by researchers in Sweden and Denmark suggested
that a controversial drug developed by Newport
Pharamceuticals International Inc. may delay the onset of
acquired immune deficiency syndrome in people infected with
the AIDS virus.
   But officials at the U.S. Food and Drug Administration
were quick to point out that the results of the study ran
counter to other tests of the drug, called isoprinosine. The
FDA officials said that the study's results were "interesting
and provocative," but that the study's conclusions "must be
viewed with considerable caution."</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The study's findings were originally scheduled to be
released tomorrow in the New England Journal of Medicine,
where a full report will appear. But the study's chief
investigator, Court Pedersen, broke the news embargo by
discussing details of the report yesterday morning at a
research meeting associated with the Sixth International
Conference on AIDS in San Francisco.</p>
<p>Moreover, Newport Pharmaceuticals of Laguna Hills, Calif.,
sent out notices to the news media on Monday and yesterday
announcing that a "major" study regarding the drug's effect
on the disease was going to be released.</p>
<p>The two events seem to have triggered tremendous activity
in Newport Pharmaceuticals' stock. In national
over-the-counter trading yesterday, the stock jumped 81.25
cents to close at $3.625. Volume was extremely heavy for the
small issue, with 875,900 shares changing hands.</p>
<p>In the study, conducted in 1988, doctors in medical
centers in Sweden and Denmark tested 803 people who were
infected with the virus but had yet to develop full-blown
AIDS. Of 399 people given the drug, two developed AIDS, while
17 of 404 people who received a placebo progressed to the
disease.</p>
<p>At the meeting at the AIDS conference, Dr. Pedersen of
Hvidovre Hospital in Copenhagen also reported the results of
a follow-up study of the same patients. He said that after 24
additional weeks, eight more patients receiving the drug
developed AIDS. The patients who had received the placebo
were given the drug during the follow-up, and 10 of those
people progressed to AIDS, he reported.</p>
<p>The study's findings are especially surprising, because
several previous studies of the drug had failed to show any
benefit. Indeed, in a carefully worded editorial accompanying
the study in New England Journal, FDA officials raised
questions about various important details of the study. In
particular, the FDA staffers pointed out, as did the study's
authors, that measurements of a protein in the patients'
immune systems indicated that the drug wasn't strengthening
their ability to fight off the disease. Neither the patients
taking the drug nor those on placebo had increases in the
number of CD4 cells, substances used to measure the ability
of AIDS patients to fight off the ailment.</p>
<p>The FDA officials also cautioned that in numerous other
studies over the years -- in which isoprinosine was tested
against herpes, cancer and other infections -- the drug
failed to be proven effective. The FDA has refused to approve
the drug on several occasions, and officials said a further
study of the drug would be needed to duplicate the
Scandinavian results.</p>
<p>A spokesperson for Newport Pharmaceuticals said the
company is discussing plans to conduct a new test.</p>
<p>Newport Pharmaceuticals has carried on a campaign for more
than 10 years to get isoprinosine approved for various uses
in the U.S. There initially was some interest in using the
drug against AIDS, because some laboratory studies indicated
that the drug boosted the effectiveness of the immune system.
Many scientists, however, are skeptical that hyping the
immune system with medication will be an effective way of
treating AIDS.</p>
<p>The study's release in the prestigious New England Journal
can be expected to renew interest in the drug despite the
FDA's concerns. Understanding this, editors at the Journal
said they debated at length whether to publish the study,
knowing that its findings contradicted previous reports. The
editors said they finally agreed to release it in order to
get the data out and let other researchers attempt to
duplicate the findings.</p>
