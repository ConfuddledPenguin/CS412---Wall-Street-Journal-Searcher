	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- White House Budget Director Richard Darman
intends to make an expanded budget proposal today to try to
jump-start the stalled budget talks with Congress, according
to people familiar with the Bush administration's strategy.
   The proposal is expected to include deficit cuts of $45
billion to $50 billion in fiscal 1991, which begins Oct 1.
The heart of the new proposal will probably be a stiff $17
billion cut in projected spending on so-called entitlement
programs, such as Medicare and farm programs, for which
spending is set by a formula. That's about $5 billion deeper
than the cuts proposed in President Bush's January budget.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>In addition, the administration is likely to propose a cut
of about $3.5 billion in suggested discretionary spending on
domestic programs -- the same cut recommended in the plan
approved by the Senate Budget Committee in May. And it is
expected to propose $20 billion in new revenue and user fees,
most of which were in the president's January budget.</p>
<p>The proposal will also call for a somewhat larger
reduction in defense spending than the $3.2 billion cut the
president has supported.</p>
<p>The administration previously proposed a $36.5 billion
deficit-reduction package, and Democratic leaders have been
calling on President Bush to make a new budget proposal for
weeks. The administration's new proposal is certain to be
unacceptable to the Democrats because it relies mostly on
domestic-spending cuts.</p>
<p>But Democrats face a delicate decision on how to respond.
Some may favor using Mr. Darman's new proposal as a starting
point for negotiations; others may want to attack the plan as
little more than posturing.</p>
<p>In talks yesterday, Defense Secretary Dick Cheney told the
summit that cutting military forces 25% over the next five
years won't reduce spending much below the levels outlined in
Mr. Bush's January budget. Democrats, who see sharp cuts in
Pentagon spending as a key to shrinking the federal budget
deficit, quickly noted that Mr. Cheney's latest figures
assume no cuts in research and development and only minimal
changes in the Pentagon's procurement plans.</p>
<p>Rep. Les Aspin (D., Wis.) and Sen. Sam Nunn (D., Ga.),
chairmen of the Armed Services committees, said Mr. Cheney's
presentation didn't advance the talks. Any new Bush
administration proposal on defense spending will come only as
part of a broader deficit-reduction proposal, Rep. Aspin
predicted.</p>
<p>Although the details are far from settled, cutting
military forces by 25% is emerging as a consensus position.
Mr. Cheney tried to convince Democrats that it would take far
deeper and more disruptive cuts to reduce the Pentagon budget
as much as they envision. Judging from the reaction of
Democratic negotiators, he didn't succeed.</p>
<p>Mr. Cheney said such a force reduction would trim about
10% from the projected defense budget, adjusted for
inflation, over the next five years. But Rep. Aspin insisted,
"If you cut forces by 25%, you get a lot more than 10%
savings." A more reasonable figure, he suggested, is in the
"low 20%" area.</p>
<p>Mr. Cheney's figures, made available by congressional
negotiators, show that a 25% force reduction would bring
defense outlays in fiscal 1991 to $302 billion, about $1.3
billion lower than Mr. Bush's January budget and about a $5
billion cut from projected levels. For reasons that weren't
immediately clear, Mr. Cheney said the Pentagon budget in
fiscal 1995 actually would be slightly larger than the one
Mr. Bush proposed in January.</p>
<p>Over the next five years, Mr. Cheney said that cutting
forces 25% would save $102.9 billion from projections that
assume the defense budget keeps pace with inflation. That's
$8.6 billion less than the spending outlined in the Bush
budget.</p>
<p>Mr. Cheney said the force reduction might mean cutting the
number of active-duty troops by 442,000 over five years to
1.6 million and eliminating 450 of the 950 Minuteman
missiles, four of the 21 strategic bomber squadrons and 111
of the Navy's 566 ships.</p>
<p>Separately, advocates of a constitutional amendment to
force a balanced federal budget managed to have the measure
sent to a vote on the House floor. Led by Rep. Charles
Stenholm (D., Texas), the backers obtained the 218 signatures
needed to move the amendment from the Judiciary Committee
onto the House floor. A House vote on the measure is expected
by July 26.</p>
<p>Two-thirds of the 435-member chamber would have to approve
it and send it to the Senate. Advocates say 248 members
support discharging the amendment this year, which would be
39 votes short of the 287 needed.</p>
<p>The measure would require that federal spending not be
higher than expected federal receipts except during wartime
or when three-fifths of both houses of Congress approves a
budget deficit.</p>
