	<p class="article-leader">SECAUCUS, N.J. -- Jamesway Corp. said Arlie G. Lazarus
resigned as president and chief operating officer, effective
Aug. 3.
   The 52-year-old Mr. Lazarus, the discount-store operator's
No. 2 officer, said, "Since I have been president of Jamesway
for over 12 years, it is now time to move on to something
new."</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Herbert Fisher, 68 years old, remains chairman and chief
executive officer of the company, which operates 132 stores
in the mid-Atlantic states. After Mr. Lazarus's departure,
Mr. Fisher will assume the duties of president and chief
operating officer until a successor is found, Jamesway said.</p>
<p>In the year ended Feb. 3, Mr. Lazarus received cash
compensation of $552,590, compared with $569,357 for Mr.
Fisher, according to proxy material for the annual meeting
held June 4.</p>
<p>"They've been a good team for a long time," Edward F.
Johnson, analyst at Prescott Ball & Turben Inc. in New York,
said of Messrs. Fisher and Lazarus. Though not a strong
performer in recent years, Jamesway did stave off potentially
weaker performance in a highly competitive industry with many
troubled companies, Mr. Johnson said. But he added that
Jamesway might well do better with a new president.</p>
<p>Jamesway's earnings declined in fiscal 1990 for the third
year in a row, despite higher sales. But the company said it
expects earnings in the current fiscal year, ending next Feb.
2, to exceed the $5.8 million, or 41 cents a share, earned on
sales of $855.1 million in fiscal 1990.</p>
<p>Barry Rockland, senior vice president for finance, said
sales for stores open more than a year are expected to rise
this year, and expense control is tighter.</p>
