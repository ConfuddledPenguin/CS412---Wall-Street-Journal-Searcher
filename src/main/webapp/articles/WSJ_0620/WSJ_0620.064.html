	<p class="article-leader">PLANNING BEGINS for a White House Conference on Small
Business in 1994.
   Legislation calling for the conference, a sort of national
summit meeting on small-business issues, is in the early
stages of congressional action. Barring unforeseen problems,
lawmakers could send a bill to President Bush by late summer.
The administration and entrepreneurs back the idea. "We think
it's time for the White House to take the temperature of the
small-business community," says John Paul Galles, executive
vice president of National Small Business United, an advocacy
group.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>White House conferences in 1980 and 1986 put the spotlight
on problems facing small companies and led to regulatory
reform, a paper-work reduction law, improved access to
government contracts and other measures favorable to small
business. They also educated a lot of small-company
executives on the political facts of life. "You have a whole
new cadre of business people at the state level who are
awakened to the legislative process," says Donna Nickerson,
government-relations director for the Northeastern Retail
Lumber Association in Rochester, N.Y., and a delegate to the
1980 conference.</p>
<p>State and regional meetings would be held starting in 1992
to submit resolutions and elect delegates to the Washington
conference.</p>

<p>SENATORS PROBE more losses at small-business investment
companies.</p>
<p>At a Senate Small Business Committee hearing this week,
the Small Business Administration's inspector general is
expected to report that a recent review of the SBA's licensed
investment firms shows another 14 are on shaky ground. The
failure of these SBICs could cost the government up to $170
million, in addition to the more than $560 million already in
default because of past failures. Small-business investment
companies are SBA-sponsored venture-capital concerns. Though
they have contributed to such huge successes as Apple
Computer Corp. and Cray Research Inc., some also have been
magnets for corruption.</p>
<p>Arkansas Democrat Sen. Dale Bumpers, the committee's
chairman, has suggested the SBA stop licensing new SBICs
until the program is under control. He has scheduled two more
hearings for July. The current crisis came to light after the
1988 collapse of River Capital Corp., costing the agency $32
million. As previously reported, Arthur Andersen & Co., which
audited the firm in 1987, is under scrutiny for failing to
detect its problems. SBA Administrator Susan Engeleiter has
promised better analysis of SBIC investments and closer
checks of applicants' financial and managerial backgrounds.</p>
<p>Solvent SBICs and minority-owned investment firms fear a
fallout. After gains by minority firms, "the timing couldn't
be worse for us," says Jo An Price, president of the National
Association of Investment Cos.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>CIVIL RIGHTS CONCERN: Small business presses to ease a
provision of the pending civil rights bill that would permit
punitive damages against companies found guilty of
intentional employment discrimination. Small firms fear that
the possibility of high damage awards would lead to more
costly out-of-court settlements as businesses weigh their
potential losses if they go to trial. "Revising the damages
provision would move us in the right direction," says John
Satagaj, president of the Small Business Legislative Council.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>VENTURE POLITICS: Contrary to the usual focus on safe
incumbents, PrintPAC, the political-action committee of the
Printing Industries of America, says 50% of its contributions
will go to challengers and open-seat races for the U.S. House
and Senate this year. "Advantages to incumbents are so
overwhelming that we feel we don't need to add to that
advantage," says PrintPAC Treasurer Benjamin Cooper. "The
contributors to PrintPAC are entrepreneurs. Our PAC strategy
ought to follow that philosophy."</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>MANDATED LEAVE still bothers small business despite an
expected Bush veto.</p>
<p>Before the Senate last Thursday joined the House in
passing a bill to require companies to grant unpaid leave to
employees for childbirth, adoption or serious family
illnesses, the White House gave small businesses new
assurances that President Bush would veto the measure. Even
though the bill exempts small employers, small-business
groups fear that it would open the door to various
mandated-employee benefits by all employers. The
mandated-benefits issue has become a litmus test for
small-business interests in Congress this year.</p>
<p>The White House expects the House and Senate will sustain
Mr. Bush's veto of the employee-leave legislation. But the
bill's Democratic sponsors will get political mileage out of
the issue by saying a veto is contrary to the president's
family-values themes, small-business groups predict. And
small business could well have to face the issue again next
year, concedes John Motley, chief lobbyist for the National
Federation of Independent Business, the largest
small-business organization.</p>
<p>The goal now, Mr. Motley says: to sustain a veto with so
many votes that the sponsors won't come back next year,
"unless they're masochists."</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>SMALL TALK: The No. 1 reason about 20% of discharged
managers now become entrepreneurs? To avoid the trauma of
another discharge, says a survey by consultants Challenger,
Gray & Christman. . . . A "my favorite bureaucrat contest" is
won by Richard McKinney, an employee of a Small Business
Development Center at Walters State Community College in
Tennessee; he helped a small manufacturer double sales by
working nights, without payment, to help fill company orders.</p>
