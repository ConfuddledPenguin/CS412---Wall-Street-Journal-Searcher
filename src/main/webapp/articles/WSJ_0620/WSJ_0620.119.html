	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- General Instrument Corp. reported that fiscal
first-quarter net income fell 29% because of a year-ago gain,
but results, excluding the special item, were "ahead of
plan."
   Revenue and earnings grew in General Instrument's biggest
business, cable-TV and satellite equipment, and in
specialized semiconductors used in microelectronics.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>In wagering systems, profit declined because foreign
shipments of lottery equipment didn't match year-ago levels.
And the defense electronics business, producing radar warning
and surveillance equipment, was hurt by lower foreign orders
at the government systems unit. Dalmo Victor, another unit of
the defense electronics business that produces the same type
of equipment, is doing well, a spokesman said.</p>
<p>Net for the first period ended May 27 dropped to $23.2
million, or 84 cents a share, from $32.5 million, or 96 cents
a share, a year earlier.</p>
<p>Year-ago results include $10.3 million, or 30 cents a
share, of earnings from discontinued operations. In May 1989,
General Instrument sold its majority interest in Sytek Inc.
to the Hughes Aircraft division of General Motors Corp. Sytek
is a Mountain View, Calif., manufacturer of local area
networks, used to tie together personal computers.</p>
<p>Also, shares outstanding declined 19% to 27.5 million,
from 33.8 million, because of a stock buy-back in August.</p>
<p>Revenue climbed 9.8% to $379.5 million from $345.6
million.</p>
<p>In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday,
General Instrument's shares rose 50 cents to close at $35.75.</p>
<p>Separately, General Instrument named Ronald A. Ostertag
president of its power-semiconductor division based in
Hicksville, N.Y. Effective Sept. 1, Mr. Ostertag, currently
senior vice president of operations for the VideoCipher
division, succeeds Christopher F. Sutphin, who retires early
next year.</p>
