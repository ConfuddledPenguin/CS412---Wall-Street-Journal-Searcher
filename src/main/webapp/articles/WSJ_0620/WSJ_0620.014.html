	<p class="article-leader">MINNEAPOLIS -- Metropolitan Financial Corp. said it agreed
to sell its First Realty Ltd. unit to Hubbell Realty Co. of
Des Moines, Iowa. Terms weren't disclosed.
   The bank holding company said the sale would result in a
"modest" gain in the current quarter. In the year-earlier
second quarter, the company earned $6.2 million, or 94 cents
a share.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Metropolitan said the sale won't lessen its commitment to
residential real estate sales as a means to enhance its
mortgage lending operations or to its Des Moines savings bank
operation.</p>
