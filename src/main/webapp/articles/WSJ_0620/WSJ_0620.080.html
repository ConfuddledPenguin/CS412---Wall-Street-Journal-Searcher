	<p class="article-leader">Tokyo stock prices retrenched in light trading as buying
interest dried up amid fading expectations for lower interest
rates as well as a lack of any other incentives.
   Meanwhile, London stocks ended a sluggish session narrowly
mixed with few fresh developments to inspire investors.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Tokyo's Nikkei index of 225 issues fell 336.42 points to
32040.38 on Tuesday.</p>
<p>At the end of the morning session in Tokyo Wednesday, the
Nikkei index was up 140.27 points to 32180.65.</p>
<p>Tuesday's volume on the first section was estimated at 330
million shares, in line with 319.7 million shares Monday.</p>
<p>Decliners outnumbered gainers 813 to 182, while 129 issues
were unchanged.</p>
<p>The Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed in the
first section, dropped 27.10 points, or 1.14%, to 2353.93.</p>
<p>Second-section stocks, which had advanced strongly in the
past five trading days, also finished lower yesterday. The
second section index lost 33.53 points, or 0.80%, to 4145.06.
The section's volume was estimated at 24 million shares, down
from 35.9 million shares Monday.</p>
<p>The Nikkei Index opened 130 points lower on discouraged
sentiments from the 53-point loss on the Dow Jones Industrial
Average in New York overnight, prompted partly by higher
interest rates on the U.S. bond market.</p>
<p>The Tokyo market saw some buying by bargain hunters when
the Nikkei fell below 32000 points midmorning, but failed to
attract further buying interest, traders said.</p>
<p>Participants had thought lower U.S. interest rates might
help drag down Japanese interest rates. But such expectations
are fading because of better-than-expected reports recently
on a series of U.S. economic indicators, observers said.</p>
<p>Hiroyuki Murai, general manager of stock trading at Nikko
Securities, attributed yesterday's drop in the Nikkei Index
to a setback of small- and midsize capital stocks, which had
been performing well while large-capital shares were falling
in the past week.</p>
<p>Large-capital shares, meanwhile, extended recent losses.
Shipbuilding, steel, construction, trading house and real
estate shares were under strong sell pressure linked to
margin calls, traders said.</p>
<p>As these sectors were heavily bought during the last week
of December, "they are having the hardest period," said
Tetsuji Hamazaki, general manager of investment information
at W.I. Carr, Sons & Co.</p>
<p>"The biggest damage to the market is the complete
withdrawal of institutional investors," said Yoshihiro Ito,
general manager of stock trading at Okasan Securities.</p>
<p>Institutions were determined to remain on the sidelines
until they see the result of German monetary union, the
Soviet Communist Party conference and the Group of Seven
nations summit meeting, all of which are slated for July,
traders said.</p>
<p>Steel shares continued to decline, with Sumitomo Metal
losing 21 yen to 570 yen (14 cents to $3.71), and NKK down 14
yen at 656 yen.</p>
<p>Other notable losers included electric power companies
such as Kansai Electric Power, which fell 120 yen to 3500
yen, and mining shares such as Nippon Mining, which plummeted
27 yen to 983 yen.</p>
<p>A few shares that managed to finish higher included
Dainippon Pharmaceutical, as potential profits of its
anti-cancer agent continued to attract investors. Dainippon
gained 50 yen to 3290 yen. Fuji Photo Film was bought for its
strong earnings outlook, gaining 90 yen to 4290 yen.</p>
<p>In London, the lack of U.K. economic indicators or major
corporate news, combined with the Royal Ascot horse race
meeting kept investment interest at a minimum, dealers said.</p>
<p>Although the market opened nearly 25 points down, dealers
said there was no outright selling and the lower levels
inspired some genuine institutional interest. "Institutions
are reluctant to sell any stock so close to the end of the
quarter," one market maker said. "The small amount of buying
and the reluctance to sell has had a disproportionate effect
on the market. It's been very quiet," he added.</p>
<p>By the closing bell, 50 stocks of the Financial
Times-Stock Exchange 100 Share Index managed to chalk up
gains, while 42 shares ended in negative territory. An
additional eight issues were unchanged.</p>
<p>At the final tally, the FT-SE 100 Share Index was down 0.8
point at 2369.7, near the day's best level of 2372.9. The
index hit its intraday minimum of 2348.9 not long after the
official opening.</p>
<p>The Financial Times 30 Share Index fell 4.5 points to
1907.4. Volume was 408.3 million shares, little changed from
403.4 million issues a day ago.</p>
<p>Additionally, the week's U.K. economic data kept many
potential players sidelined, market watchers said. Expected
today are U.K. money supply figures, and balance of payments
data are due Friday. Dealers were also keeping a close eye on
Wall Street after Monday's skid.</p>
<p>The shares of many defense-related companies fell after
the British government said Monday it is aiming to cut 3%, or
about #600 million ($1.03 billion), from the #21.2 billion
budgeted for defense spending in the year to March 31.</p>
<p>U.K. Defense Secretary Tom King Monday announced an
immediate ban on new equipment orders pending an examination
of where and how additional savings can be met. The Tornado
fighters, developed by a consortium including British
Aerospace PLC, are the first major casualty.</p>
<p>British Aerospace slipped 14 pence lower to 546 pence,
while GEC fell 9 pence to 208 pence, Vickers dropped 3 pence
to 233 pence, and Rolls-Royce fell 5 pence to 217 pence.</p>
<p>In other shares, Charter Consolidated, which reported a
12% rise in pretax profit for fiscal 1990, dropped 9 pence to
454 pence.</p>
<p>BET added 7 pence to 259 pence after reporting good
full-year earnings a day ago. Several dealers said the shares
have been upgraded by a slew of brokerage firms that were
cheered by the company's statement that it wouldn't be making
any acquisitions this year.</p>
<p>Globe Investment Trust fell a penny to 204 pence after the
British Coal pension funds announced it would extend its
#1.02 billion bid for the company to Monday after failing to
gain control of the company as the previous deadline lapsed.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, stocks ended higher in Frankfurt and Paris,
lower in Stockholm, Madrid and Brussels and mixed in
Amsterdam, Milan and Zurich. South African gold stocks closed
slightly lower.</p>
<p>Also, shares closed lower in Taipei, Sydney, Singapore,
Manila, Wellington and Seoul, and were higher in Hong Kong.</p>
<p>Here are price trends on the world's major stock markets,
as calculated by Morgan Stanley Capital International
Perspective, Geneva. To make them directly comparable, each
index is based on the close of 1969 equaling 100. The
percentage change is since year-end.</p>
