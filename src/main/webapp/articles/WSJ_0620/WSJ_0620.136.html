	<p class="article-leader">Sabena, the Belgian flag carrier, posted a 1989 operating
loss of 1.26 billion Belgian francs ($36.6 million), compared
with 1988 operating profit of 1.19 billion francs.
   Officials of the 53% state-owned airline predicted a 1.5
billion-franc loss for 1990, mostly because of costs
associated with building up the Brussels airport as a
transfer point for European flights. Sabena attributed last
year's poor performance to disrupted services to Zaire,
air-traffic control strikes in Europe, and a work stoppage by
Sabena flight attendants.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>But Sabena had 1989 net income of 658.1 million francs,
owing to extraordinary gains from sale of an aircraft and
goodwill payments from two new investors, British Airways and
KLM Royal Dutch Airlines. In 1988, Sabena earned 334.7
million francs.</p>
<p>Revenue in 1989 eased to 41.9 billion francs from 42.6
billion francs in 1988.</p>
<p>One-time gains of 6.58 billion francs included five
billion francs total paid by British Airways and KLM as
goodwill for their 20% stakes in a new air-transport company,
Sabena World Airlines; Sabena, now a holding company, retains
60%.</p>
