	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- The Bush administration is reluctantly
considering U.S. participation in a multibillion-dollar
international effort to save the Soviet economy from a crash
that could undermine Mikhail Gorbachev and harm Eastern
Europe.
   The National Security Council is debating the conditions
under which the U.S. might take part in such a rescue plan,
which West Germany and France are pushing. The allies foresee
it totaling about $20 billion over one or two years. For the
U.S., the major issue is exactly how it could participate in
a way that encourages, rather than postpones, economic and
political changes in the Soviet Union. The White House is
planning to settle on a U.S. position in time for the July 9
economic summit meeting in Houston, at which the Soviet-aid
issue promises to be the dominant issue.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>American officials familiar with the international
deliberations caution that President Bush hasn't decided
whether the U.S. will join such a rescue effort. They add
that no Western plan is likely to be adopted in detail at the
summit or to begin operating soon thereafter. Instead, the
heads of the seven largest industrial nations are likely to
order lower-level officials to work out a program for
adoption later.</p>
<p>But the administration, which has opposed direct Western
aid or financing for the Soviet Union, has concluded that the
meeting is likely to begin a process by which Western funds
and food will begin flowing to the U.S.S.R. this year.
American officials fear that unless the U.S. gets involved,
the Europeans will proceed on their own with an aid package
that would carry too few conditions and might help prop up
inefficient state-run enterprises. The U.S. officials would
prefer to assert American leadership over any Western effort.</p>
<p>French President Francois Mitterrand yesterday publicly
declared for the first time that he will push to make aid to
the Soviets a top priority at both the Houston summit and a
coming Dublin meeting of the European Community.</p>
<p>On Monday, West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl wrote a
letter to leaders of the EC, the U.S., Japan and Canada,
asking them to discuss in Houston and Dublin the question of
economic and financial cooperation with the Soviet Union.
Reached at home last night, a top aide to the chancellor
insisted that Mr. Kohl has made no recommendation for a
specific amount. "What we prefer is, first of all, a
discussion with our partners over whether it is in our best
interests to give such support and only then talk about
specifics," he said.</p>
<p>Asked to comment on yesterday's statement by Mr.
Mitterrand, the State Department stuck to the current
official U.S. position opposing Western aid. It deliberately
avoided any mention of the high-level discussion about
changing the policy. "Neither the West nor the U.S.S.R. would
benefit from the extension of large-scale credits or
assistance," the statement declared.</p>
<p>Administration officials are keenly aware that aid to
Moscow -- even such indirect measures as permitting U.S.
banks to lend the U.S.S.R. money -- would be politically
controversial at home. When House Majority Leader Richard
Gephardt (D., Mo.) proposed such aid a few months ago, the
White House ridiculed the proposal and it got little support.
Mr. Gorbachev's campaign against Lithuanian independence has
complicated the political calculation.</p>
<p>However, U.S. experts privately have concluded that the
Soviet economy, already faltering badly, could break down,
amplifying the country's political chaos dangerously. They
fear such a prospect -- especially a Soviet food crisis later
this year -- could swamp the current reform efforts and might
even topple Mr. Gorbachev, whose continued presence at the
helm is thought necessary to get Moscow's final agreement on
German unification and arms-control treaties.</p>
<p>What's more, American officials fear that any Soviet
economic crash could badly undermine the new democracies of
Eastern Europe, whose own economies are still heavily tied to
Moscow's both for imports and exports. A politically
unpopular decision to aid Mr. Gorbachev thus might be made
palatable by posing it as indirect help for the popular new
regimes in Poland, Hungary and Czechoslovakia.</p>
<p>Mr. Gorbachev raised the issue of possible Western
economic help in vague terms during his summit meeting with
President Bush here two weeks ago. But U.S. officials say
their discussion of the topic was general and didn't produce
any agreements or promises.</p>
<p>The Bush administration is likely to insist on three broad
conditions before it will participate in any aid package.</p>
<p>First, it wants guarantees that the Soviets will begin
implementing more fundamental economic reforms to create a
true market economy and that Western aid will bolster these
efforts directly. Some U.S. officials even see the Western
aid being used to flood the country with consumer goods as a
sweetener to help the Soviet public accept the economic
burdens of reform.</p>
<p>Second, the administration wants the Kremlin to stop using
its money to prop up distant allies, notably Cuba. Otherwise,
the administration fears, Western aid simply would allow the
Kremlin to avoid the painful decision of cutting off Cuban
leader Fidel Castro and other clients.</p>
<p>Moreover, the U.S. will want to see the economic crackdown
on Lithuania removed.</p>
<p>In an interview with the French newspaper Le Monde, Mr.
Mitterrand warned that if Mr. Gorbachev's reforms fail, "the
rise of nationalism threatening the implosion of the Soviet
Union will set off a cycle of confrontation and violence
which will have grave international repercussions."
Therefore, he declared: "I intend to ask the forthcoming
summits in Dublin and Houston to consider financial,
commercial and technical aid for the U.S.S.R."</p>
<p>Details of what a $20 billion package would entail are
sparse, partly because nothing has been decided.</p>
<p>One component seems likely to be food, which might have to
be delivered by Western trucks or aircraft to the country's
interior to prevent it from being left to rot at docks and
depots because of the awful Soviet transportation system. A
second element is likely to be access to commercial credit,
though it's uncertain whether Western banks will be willing
to lend to a country behind on its payments and threatening
to splinter into a dozen separate republics. France and West
Germany also are pushing for some direct government credit,
though the U.S. is very wary of the idea.</p>
<p>In the U.S., congressional approval might be required to
waive legal restrictions against aid and bank lending to the
Soviets, who still haven't repaid U.S. loans from earlier
periods.</p>
<p>If the U.S. participates in an aid effort, the Bush
administration would want to carefully target the assistance
so that it encourages the Soviets to turn state-run
enterprises over to private hands. That has been a goal of
other American aid programs for new, non-Communist
governments. Some U.S. aid for Poland, Hungary and
Czechoslovakia, for instance, is earmarked specifically for
government firms that have plans for going private.</p>
