	<h3>Mutual Funds: Bargain-Hunting in Foreign Stock Funds --- Big Discounts Hurt Some, Lure Others</h3>

	<p class="article-leader">The world may have ended for some investors in publicly
traded stock funds, but the smart-money crowd is licking its
chops.
   Lured by the huge run-up in the stock price of Spain Fund
and Germany Fund in late 1989, many investors loaded up on
funds that buy foreign stocks, especially the single-country
funds.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>But none of these funds ever matched the dizzying heights
reached by the Spain and Germany funds, so disgruntled
investors have been dumping their shares of these foreign
closed-end funds. For bargain hunters, that spells
opportunity.</p>
<p>Here's why. A closed-end fund is so called because it
issues only a fixed number of shares, which then trade
publicly like any other stock. Shares in new closed-ends are
sold at a premium to the value of the fund's portfolio,
though most closed-end funds eventually fall to discounts and
bargain-hunters can buy $1 of assets for, say, 85 cents.
That's what's happening now with the foreign closed-ends.</p>
<p>First Philippine Fund, for instance, closed yesterday at
$9.50 a share, down from $18 in November. Future Germany
Fund, which hit a high of $19.25 on its first day of trading
in February, is now at $14.125. Both funds trade at steep
discounts to the value of their portfolios.</p>
<p>Investors tend to buy closed-ends either because of a fund
manager's track record or because of a fund's discount. But
lately, it's been possible to buy funds that boast both steep
discounts and good management.</p>
<p>Richard Barone, chairman of Cincinnati's Maxus Investment
Group, likes to buy closed-end funds that are at bargain
prices. But he doesn't simply buy the funds with the deepest
discounts. Instead, he uses a computer to root out those
funds trading at discounts that are bigger than usual.</p>
<p>On that basis, Mr. Barone has lately been eyeing Alliance
New Europe, Growth Fund of Spain, Swiss Helvetia Fund and
Turkish Investment Fund. Alliance New Europe, for instance,
has traded at an average discount of 6.3% since its launch
this year. But yesterday, it closed at $9.75, a 14% discount
to its $11.30-a-share portfolio value.</p>
<p>Unlike Mr. Barone, Kenneth Gregory of Litman/Gregory &
Co., a San Francisco investment adviser, buys funds primarily
because of the fund manager's track record. "For a closed-end
fund to make sense for us, it has to have the same appeal as
an open-end {mutual fund}, which is that we believe in the
management," Mr. Gregory says.</p>
<p>But though Mr. Gregory doesn't buy a closed-end fund just
because it has a fat discount, he also is intrigued by
Alliance New Europe. He points out that the fund is run by
Glenn Wellman, who also runs Alliance International, a
top-performing mutual fund. Over the past five years,
Alliance International has returned 27.7% a year, compared
with 25% for the average international fund tracked by Lipper
Analytical Services.</p>
<p>Alliance New Europe was launched in early May but isn't
yet fully invested in stocks. Mr. Wellman says he eventually
hopes to have 20% of the fund's assets in unquoted securities
and 40% in companies with market values of less than $500
million. The rest of the fund assets will be in
larger-company stocks. Mr. Wellman has already bought
positions in two Hungarian companies, Graboplast, a specialty
textile maker, and Ibusz, a tour operator that is about to be
listed on Vienna's stock exchange.</p>
<p>Another closed-end that combines both a fat discount and a
well-regarded fund management company is Scudder New Europe.
The fund, which is managed by New York's Scudder, Stevens &
Clark, came public in February at $12.50 a share but closed
yesterday at $10.125, a 15% discount to its portfolio value.</p>
<p>Fund manager Carol Franklin has recently been buying
smaller companies like Caird Group, a British
waste-management company, and Fika Finanz AG, a Swiss
supplier of construction chemicals. But like Alliance's Mr.
Wellman, Ms. Franklin is also looking for unquoted
securities. The fund, for instance, has bought a part share
in a twin-hulled cruise ship now being built in Finland. The
ship should go into service in 1992, and Ms. Franklin hopes
the stock will be launched publicly soon after.</p>
<p>Ronald Olin, a closed-end fund specialist who runs
Houston's Deep Discount Advisors, says the discounts on most
foreign closed-ends aren't yet big enough to tempt him. But
he is interested in Templeton Value, a global small-company
stock fund that has 39% of its assets invested in the U.S.</p>
<p>Templeton Value's prospectus says that if the fund trades
at an average discount of 5% or more during the 12 weeks
leading up to June 30 or Dec. 31, then shareholders should
get a chance to vote on converting the fund to a regular
mutual fund. That would eliminate the fund's discount, which
yesterday stood at 11%.</p>
<p>Whether or not Templeton Value converts to a mutual fund,
the fund's shareholders are at least in good company. Last
August and September, mutual fund maven John Templeton bought
$1.4 million of the fund's shares, saying that he was bullish
on emerging growth stocks. The shares now trade slightly
below Mr. Templeton's buying price.</p>

<p>Investors have been bailing out of closed-end funds that
buy foreign stocks, so many of these funds are now trading at
bargain prices.</p>
