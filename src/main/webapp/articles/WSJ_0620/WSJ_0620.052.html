	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- RJR Nabisco Inc. and its main shareholder,
Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co., have begun a $5.3 billion
refinancing effort that will drastically reshape the tobacco
and food company's balance sheet.
   The plan aims to retire more than $4 billion of RJR's
poorest-performing below-investment-grade "junk" bonds,
according to bankers who have seen the package. It is an
attempt to put the RJR buy-out on firmer financial footing in
the face of a crucial deadline for repricing part of the
high-yield debt used to take the company private.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Money for the plan would be raised from three main
sources: $2.25 billion in fresh bank borrowings by RJR, about
$1.5 billion through a preferred-stock sale by RJR, and about
$1.5 billion in an equity infusion from the large leveraged
buy-out fund that KKR controls. These proceeds would be used
to retire the junk bonds and pay off $1 billion of
increasing-rate notes later this year.</p>
<p>An RJR spokesman declined to comment on the restructuring
plan.</p>
<p>If the plan succeeds, bankers say, it will impose a more
conservative financial structure on RJR, which has been
highly indebted since it was acquired by KKR, a leveraged
buy-out firm, 17 months ago. The consumer-products company
would be shielded from a potential debt crisis next spring,
but KKR's potential profits would be curtailed.</p>
<p>People close to KKR caution that the plan remains subject
to revision. Even so, bankers say, it is by far the most
detailed RJR refinancing scheme that KKR and its advisers
have presented so far.</p>
<p>Since January, bond-market investors and KKR partners have
worried about RJR's obligations on more than $6 billion of
low-rated junk bonds. By next April, the interest rate on
those bonds must be reset to make them trade at their face
value. Those bonds have been depressed for months and are
trading now at about 76 cents on the dollar.</p>
<p>At current bond prices, RJR would have to reset those
bonds to an interest rate of about 18.5%, which would chew up
much of the company's cash flow. These bonds have proved
unpopular with many investors, in part because they pay
interest in the form of more bonds, rather than in cash.</p>
<p>Bankers say the RJR refinancing plan would largely
sidestep the reset quandary. Instead, RJR is proposing to buy
back all $2.19 billion outstanding of 14.07% convertible
reset debentures, and about 45%, or $1.95 billion, of 14.07%
reset exchange debentures.</p>
<p>Such purchases would be huge news in the junk-bond market,
where the RJR issues are bellwethers. "The RJR bonds are
still at a big discount to their value," one large holder,
Howard Marks at Trust Co. of the West, said earlier this
week. Like many junk-bond investors, Mr. Marks has been
kicking around his own conjectures about how KKR might deal
with the reset issue.</p>
<p>RJR could buy back the bonds either gradually, via
open-market purchases, or rapidly, via a tender offer at a
premium to the market price. As long as the junk bonds remain
at big discounts to face value, they are likely to be bought
at market prices. If the bonds soar, though, bank-loan
proposals have penciled in the assumption that RJR would pay
full face value for the bonds.</p>
<p>Crucial to the success of the RJR refinancing will be the
response of major U.S. and foreign banks, which are being
asked to lend a further $2.25 billion to the company. Last
year, in the height of the leveraged lending frenzy, banks
lent more than $11 billion to fund the RJR buy-out. Now,
however, banks have turned much chillier toward buy-out
lending.</p>
<p>RJR's four lead bank lenders, units of Manufacturers
Hanover Corp., Chase Manhattan Corp., Bankers Trust New York
Corp. and Citicorp, are expected to lead the new bank loan.
It wasn't clear, though, how much help they will get from
Japanese banks, which in 1989 lavished RJR with loans in $500
million amounts. "Some Japanese banks are feeling tightly
restrained about LBO lending," a Japanese banker said.</p>
<p>Bankers said they are intrigued by another major source of
funding for the bond repurchases: an approximately $1.5
billion issue of convertible preferred stock by RJR. Bankers
said they expect the preferred will yield about 9% or 10%. It
also would be convertible into RJR common stock at a price of
about $10 a share, bankers said.</p>
<p>Traditional investors may find the preferred stock, which
pays dividends in cash instead of paper, much more to their
liking than the junk bonds it replaces. Its issuance also
would mark a noteworthy retreat by KKR, which, through its
buy-outs, was by far the largest issuer of junk bonds in the
1980s.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, KKR has told banks and KKR's outside investors
that it plans to invest between $1.4 billion and $1.7 billion
of new equity in RJR, through partnerships that KKR controls.</p>
<p>The exact terms under which that equity will be invested
haven't been determined. But the new equity infusion is
likely to be closely pegged to the price of RJR's warrants,
which are traded on the New York Stock Exchange. The
warrants, equivalent to one share of RJR's closely held
common stock, closed yesterday at $6.625 each. At the time of
the February 1989 buy-out, RJR's common was valued at $5 a
share.</p>
<p>For KKR, the RJR refinancing package does bear some costs,
though far less than if the bond-reset problem had worsened.
An equity investor with KKR said he expects the annual
percentage return from the RJR buy-out will amount to
"somewhere in the mid-20s" after the new equity infusion.
This is far less than KKR's peak returns of 60% a year or
better in the mid-1980s, though still well above the average
annual stock-market return of 9% to 12%.</p>
<p>The equity infusion also will shrink KKR's untapped equity
in its buy-out fund to less than $2 billion. Currently, most
buy-out specialists' spending power is about four times their
available equity, meaning that KKR couldn't make more than $8
billion of acquisitions before it would need to raise a new
equity fund.</p>
<p>The new $8 billion spending ceiling is the least of KKR's
worries, though; the market for big buy-outs is practically
dead this year, anyway.</p>
