	<p class="article-leader">SYDNEY, Australia -- May data showed demand in the
Australian economy continued to slow, but the effects were
uneven among sectors, the Reserve Bank of Australia, the
central bank, said.
   In its latest bulletin, the central bank said it
"continued its recent policy of keeping monetary conditions
steady" during May. The government and Reserve Bank eased
interest rates in three steps between January and April,
after nearly two years of pushing rates up, but have declined
to lower rates further until they see clear signs of slower
imports and inflation.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Arguing that "quarterly figures tend to be volatile and
sometimes misleading," the central bank put aside
consideration of national accounts issued for the quarter
ended March 31, which showed an unexpected 1.8% expansion in
gross domestic product. It said private final demand in the
economy "was flat and investment {was} falling."</p>
<p>Balance-of-payments figures for March "offered
disappointing evidence on the strength of imports and the
size of the current-account deficit," the bank said. But
"April's results . . . supported the belief that reduced
domestic demand would feed into lower demand for imports."</p>
