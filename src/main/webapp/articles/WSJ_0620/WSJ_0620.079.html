	<p class="article-leader">SAN JOSE, Calif. -- Conner Peripherals Inc. and Seagate
Technology Inc. said they settled a lawsuit filed by Conner
alleging Seagate had unlawfully deprived the company of its
supply of thin-film heads, a component in hard-disk drives.
   Under the settlement, Seagate will furnish Conner with the
heads "until 1991 on typical industry terms and conditions."
Conner will drop its lawsuit and all other claims related to
the dispute.</p>
