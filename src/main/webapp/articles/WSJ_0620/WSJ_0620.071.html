	<p class="article-leader">Motorola Inc. is expected to unveil plans next week for a
new satellite communications system that some industry
experts believe could handle cellular phone calls within a
few years.
   Such a move by the Schaumburg, Ill., electronics and
semiconductor company would greatly expand cellular telephone
coverage, which currently excludes rural areas without
ground-based switching systems.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"We're talking about a major change in the technology,"
said John Pemberton, a mobile communications analyst at
Gartner Group, a Stamford, Conn., research firm.</p>
<p>Mr. Pemberton said he believes Motorola plans a "hybrid"
system that would use both the ground-based system and what
he calls the "sky system." As the user left an area covered
by the ground system, the satellite system would take over.</p>
<p>A Motorola spokesman said the company plans to announce
Tuesday a "global communications system." He wouldn't
elaborate, except to say that the announcement will be made
at New York's Hayden Planetarium.</p>
<p>Space News, a trade publication in Springfield, Va.,
reported in its June 4-10 edition that industry officials
told it that Motorola "intends to launch a constellation of
dozens of small satellites that would expand vastly its
ability to provide continuous mobile telephone service" in
the U.S. and abroad.</p>
<p>Mr. Pemberton of Gartner Group said he expects Motorola to
eventually launch as many as 60 to 70 small satellites over a
number of years beginning as early as 1992, at a potential
cost of $1 billion. He said 15 to 22 satellites would be
enough to get full coverage of the U.S., and additional ones
could be used to expand capacity.</p>
<p>The Motorola spokesman said some of the information in the
Space News story was incorrect. He also said numbers
describing the size of the communications system have been
wrong, but wouldn't elaborate further.</p>
<p>Besides catapulting Motorola into a business dominated by
phone companies, a move into satellite transmission of
cellular calls could lead to new equipment sales for
Motorola. Blanketing the U.S. or other nations with coverage
would open markets not currently served by cellular systems.</p>
<p>Motorola already is the world's biggest supplier of
cellular phone systems and mobile and portable phones. It
cites analysts' predictions that the world cellular market
will jump to 100 million subscribers by the year 2000 from
about 7 million last year.</p>
<p>Thomas Kurlak, who follows the company for Merrill Lynch &
Co., says Motorola now derives 55% of its operating income
from its cellular businesses. Mr. Kurlak said a move by
Motorola into satellite communications could make it "a new,
massive provider" of telephone service over the next 10 to 20
years.</p>
<p>Analysts said Motorola could seek partners to help finance
such an effort. Because they could otherwise lose business to
a satellite system, analysts said the "Baby Bell" regional
phone companies would be ideal candidates for such a
partnership.</p>
<p>Dow Jones Professional Investors Report said yesterday
that speculation of a possible launch services contract from
Motorola was behind recent surge in the stock of Orbital
Sciences Corp., It said Orbital wouldn't comment.</p>
