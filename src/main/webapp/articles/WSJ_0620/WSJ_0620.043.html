	<p class="article-leader">Both Lawrence A. Kudlow ("What's Good for America Is Good
for Bonds," May 9) and Irving Kristol ("Inflation: Almost
Never What It Seems," May 16) are right in their
editorial-page articles to observe that the conduct of Alan
Greenspan's Fed offers no grounds to fear inflation. Yet
there is even more evidence:
   -- The price of gold has not simply been steady, it has
fallen to below $375 per ounce. If anything, this measure
indicates a slight tightening; 1980s markets were healthy and
inflation low with gold at $425 to $475.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>-- Exchange rates have exhibited less volatility than at
any time since 1973, thanks to both Mr. Greenspan and former
Treasury Secretary James Baker's G-7 initiative, causing at
least one Journal article to remark they have now become
almost "boring." While exchange rates are not the best
barometer -- it is possible to have global inflation or
deflation with steady exchange rates -- some analysts watch
them closely, and they certainly point to no inflation.</p>
<p>Even the money supply, rightly understood, reinforces the
case. To find a meaningful monetary aggregate we must exclude
currency outstanding -- much of which may be finding its way
into East European and other countries where dollars are the
"de facto" money. We have this in the Fed's statistics on
non-borrowed reserves, an aggregate that, unlike M-1 through
M-3 and even the monetary base, excludes the potentially
misleading currency.</p>
<p>Non-borrowed reserve growth under Mr. Greenspan: 0.5%
since taking office. In fact, reserves stood at $58.4 billion
in August 1987; at $58.4 billion in January 1988; at $58.7
billion in January 1989; and $58.7 billion in May 1990. Thus,
interest rates of 8.5% on bonds become hard to explain in
terms of legitimate inflation fears. Either the market is
ill-informed or it simply doubts the Fed will stay the course
set by Messrs. Baker and Greenspan.</p>
<p>The remedy for the former is for bond buyers to wake up
and take advantage of still-high rates. The remedy for the
latter is for the Fed and current Treasury Secretary Nicholas
Brady to institutionalize all this price stability, gaining
what Fed Gov. Wayne Angell has rightly called the critical
"announcement effect." Monetary authorities already have done
the difficult part of establishing a commodity-backed dollar.
Why not the easy part?</p>
