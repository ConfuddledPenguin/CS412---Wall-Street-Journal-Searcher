	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- The Transportation Department gave Lufthansa
German Airlines temporary authority to fly between Charlotte,
N.C., and Frankfurt, West Germany.
   The department granted authority for six months and said
it would extend authority further if the German government
eases restrictions on fares set by U.S. airlines for flights
originating in Germany.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The department granted Lufthansa's application under a new
program designed to increase international air service to
U.S. cities. Under the program, route authority is granted
foreign airlines on an expedited basis if certain conditions
are met. That bypasses the lengthy bilateral negotiations
that usually are required.</p>
<p>The department said that U.S. airlines have complained
that the German government has blocked efforts by U.S.
carriers to set fares lower than Lufthansa's on flights
originating in Germany.</p>
