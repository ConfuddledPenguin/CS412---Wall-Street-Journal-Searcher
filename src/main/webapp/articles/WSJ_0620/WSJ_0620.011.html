	<p class="article-leader">Bellingham, Wash. -- Smelling nerves, the KVOS-TV crew
fell upon me like vultures. "How did you train for this
race?" the cameraman asks, his lens eyeing me. Be clever, I
tell myself. Make the news. "Train?" I say. "I just signed up
for this four days ago. There really wasn't much I could do."
No good. The camera stares blankly. "I drank beer and ate
spaghetti last night -- that's how I trained," I add
brightly. Better. The cameraman and his producer smile.
   As they walked away I wished I HAD trained a bit more. I
was fewer than five minutes from the starting gun for the
1990 Ski to Sea relay race, a bit of spring madness in which
close to 200 teams scramble from the Mount Baker Ski Area --
where I was standing -- to Fairhaven Bay at Bellingham, 85
miles away.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>I had the first leg -- a four-mile cross-country skiing
loop -- and I knew I was in big trouble. I'd largely
abandoned the skinny skis this winter to devote my energy to
a new-found passion for alpine skiing. I'd warmed up for the
race early in the morning by performing two ungainly
face-plants in the snow as people in Lycra ski suits skated
gracefully by. One woman had even taken an hour or so to
apply color-coordinated makeup and lipstick and arrange her
hair in an artful bun. We had crawled out of bed groaning at
5 a.m. and scarcely had brushed our teeth. My team was called
the Roaring Forties, a nod toward the ages of the team
members. But last-minute logistical problems had forced team
captain Steve Fancher to make some hasty additions --
including me. And because I'm 35 I would take the Forties out
of the master's division and into the more competitive open
division.</p>
<p>But the Forties weren't going to set their hearts on
competing seriously with the hard-core athletic fanatics who
usually win here. Instead we were conducting an informal
rivalry with the Higher Plane Woodworks team. We'd spent the
night before the race at Woodworks team member Chet Lackey's
house overlooking Whatcom Lake, guzzling Budweiser and the
aforementioned spaghetti. The old school pals that make up
most of the Forties and Higher Plane teams use the race as an
excuse for an annual get-together. Steve provided the
evening's highlight by executing a neat handspring and back
flip on the lawn while we cheered from the deck and Dire
Straits blared on the stereo.</p>
<p>And now the official is counting down: "Five . . . four .
. . three . . . two . . ." We're off. I scramble ahead,
trying to stay a little behind and to one side of the pack as
it duck-walks from the start. My strategy is to hang back
until the pack untangles, then try to use my conditioning as
a runner to gain ground on the hills. But the lanes narrow
after a short but steep hill near the start, and by the time
I reach the top I am stuck behind a long line of skiers. So
much for tactics.</p>
<p>It's a warm morning, and the snow is soft. Like most
people, I find myself doing less skiing than alternately
hopping and jogging on skis. I discover I have forgotten how
to turn with the light cross-country equipment, and collapse
sideways into the snow at the end of the first downhill run.
A half dozen other skiers swerve desperately to miss me and
go down themselves. They glare at me. I thrash about, trying
to regain my footing. Then I'm off again, sweat pouring into
my eyes and skis slipping on the snow.</p>
<p>The best skiers reach the exchange point in 20 minutes. I
take 40, and am happy to hand off the plastic medallion.
Steve, on downhill skis, heads down the slope. He then faces
a grueling slog up hundreds of feet of steep snow, heavy skis
in hand, before skiing back down to the lodge for the
exchange with Rufino Contreras, our runner.</p>
<p>The modern Ski to Sea race dates back to 1973, but it
traces its roots to early in the century. Back then,
Bellingham was the starting point for the Mount Baker
Marathon, which extended all the way to the summit of
10,778-foot Mount Baker and back. There were no particular
rules, and competitors used any means possible to gain an
edge. Logger Joe Galbraith set a course record of 12 hours
and 28 minutes in part by using a chauffeur-driven Ford to
reach the base of the mountain. His competitor tried a train
and might have won if a cow hadn't wandered into his path and
derailed his ride. Still, I've climbed Mount Baker three
times and taken from five to eight hours just to reach the
summit from a camp of 6,000 feet or higher. Galbraith's feat
was remarkable, and not to be duplicated. After three years,
in 1913, the race was suspended after a competitor fell into
a crevasse on Mount Baker and was nearly killed.</p>
<p>The current race is considerably less life-threatening,
although no pushover. This year's event included two ski
legs, a kidney-pounding nine-mile run that descended 1,700
feet down steep switchbacks, a hilly 36-mile bike leg, a long
canoe or kayak paddle down the Nooksack River, and finally an
eight-mile sail across Fairhaven Bay in agile little
two-person catamarans called Hobie Cats.</p>
<p>Nature conspires to give the normally sedentary sailors a
workout. The lowest tide in decades leaves the Cats beached
on a mud flat more than a mile from where the canoeists hit
their exchange point. The sailors sprint from the exchange in
a great show of bravado, but then slow to a jog. Our team
puts in a valiant effort but never recovers from the hole I
dug for us.</p>
<p>Steve, Rufino and I finally get to wave to our teammates
aboard their Hobie Cat as they pilot the boat into the beach
at race's end at 6:10 p.m. Nine hours, 38 minutes. Slow, but
far from last. The winning team, Win's Drive-Inn from
Seattle, finished the course in six hours, 38 minutes, moving
from third to first place with a brilliant sailing leg. Our
chief rivals -- the Higher Plane group -- finished a
respectable 49th, with a time of eight hours, 33 minutes.
They already were well into the night's supply of Budweiser
at Chet's house when we straggled in. But it was our team
that gained media fame. "Did you talk to a television crew?"
asked the wife of a member of the Higher Plane team
excitedly. "You told them you had beer and spaghetti. We saw
you on KVOS."</p>
