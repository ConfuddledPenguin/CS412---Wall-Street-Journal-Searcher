	<p class="article-leader">GORBACHEV ENDORSED a separate Communist Party in the
Russian republic.
   But the Soviet president assailed those who want to make
the new party a separatist force in Russia, largest of the 15
Soviet republics. The impetus for Gorbachev's reluctant
endorsement of the separate party, announced at a conference
of Russian Communists in Moscow, is the emergence of rival
Boris Yeltsin as the new president of the Russian Federation.
Meanwhile, the U.S. is considering participating in a $20
billion international rescue effort for the Soviet economy.</p>

<p>A HOUSE PANEL CLEARED an amendment barring desecration of
the flag.</p>
<p>The Judiciary Committee sent the proposed constitutional
amendment protecting the flag to the full House without
recommendation, signaling possible difficulties for the
measure in a floor vote that could come as early as tomorrow.
The 19-17 vote surprised some panel members, who had
predicted a favorable recommendation. The amendment was
proposed by Bush last week after the Supreme Court overturned
a law banning flag desecration, saying it violated freedom of
speech.</p>
<p>The amendment would have to be passed by a two-thirds
majority in Congress and then approved by legislatures in at
least 38 of the 50 states.</p>

<p>South Africa's Parliament repealed a 37-year-old apartheid
law used to segregate public facilities. Only the far-right
Conservative Party voted to retain the act. While the law was
no longer enforced in big cities, small towns reserved many
facilities for whites only. African black nationalist leader
Mandela was to fly to New York today.</p>

<p>Romania's government appealed for talks with the
opposition but also pressed its crackdown on dissent by

The U.S. said its ambassador to Romania will boycott
Iliescu's inauguration today to show concern over how his
government has dealt with anti-Communist demonstrations.</p>

<p>A study suggested that a drug developed by Newport
Pharmaceuticals may delay the onset of AIDS in people

individuals carrying the virus.</p>

<p>Rival Christian forces fought with howitzers and mortars
across Beirut's Christian enclave in a confrontation that

Lebanese President Hrawi in an effort to salvage a Vatican
plan for ending the Christian warfare.</p>

<p>The House approved a $20.8 billion fiscal 1991 energy and
water bill providing for a 12.7% increase from current

day of defeats for the Republican leadership.</p>

to a military censor before publication.</p>

president can survive a confrontation with the rebels.</p>

<p>Salvadoran leftist guerrillas demanded that President
Cristiani's rightist government sharply reduce its military
force and purge its ranks of human-rights violators. A rebel

is a crucial issue that will determine the progress of peace
talks that are under way in Mexico.</p>
