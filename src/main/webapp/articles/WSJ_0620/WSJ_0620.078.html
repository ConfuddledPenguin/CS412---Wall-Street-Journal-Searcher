	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- A Senate panel is accusing hospitals of
hiring firms that inflate hospital bills through questionable
billings, while hiding overcharges.
   The practice, which can contribute to rising health-care
costs, will be the subject of a hearing to be held today by
the Senate's Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>In a report prepared for the hearings, the panel focused
on two so-called revenue recovery firms, but it said there
are at least 35 such companies operating nationwide.</p>
<p>Hospitals are more inclined to hire revenue recovery firms
as their profit margins continue to be squeezed through
public and private cost controls, and the added burden of
providing uncompensated care for the indigent.</p>
<p>Revenue recovery firms often contract with hospitals to
review bills on a contingency-fee or percentage-of-recovery
basis -- sometimes 50% of the amount of charges recovered.
Because such payment schemes encourage abuse, Big Eight
accounting firms said their ethics standards prohibit such
arrangements.</p>
<p>The Senate panel's report found that revenue recovery
firms "teach auditors to downplay or ignore overcharges,"
while pressuring employees to find undercharges. One firm
required that each auditor find at least $1,225 in
undercharges each day, according to the report. Some auditors
not meeting their quotas were fired, the report said.</p>
<p>The General Accounting Office, an arm of Congress,
reviewed accounts at four Los Angeles-area hospitals that
were audited by Manns Co., a revenue recovery firm based in
Rolling Hills Estates, Calif. Although Manns uncovered
overcharges in 15% of the cases audited, GAO investigators
found overcharges were present in 99% of the cases audited,
according to Senate investigators.</p>
<p>"It depends on what you call an overcharge," said Dan
O'Callaghan, Manns vice president, finance. "We took off $7
million in overcharges in the past two years in our client
hospitals."</p>
<p>Revenue recovery employees often conceal their involvement
with a hospital bill out of fear that an insurance company
will then review that bill, investigators charged. Some
revenue recovery employees pose as hospital employees in
answering telephone inquiries from patients or insurers, they
said.</p>
<p>The Health Insurance Association of America, concerned
about the practices of revenue recovery firms, has formed a
task force to study the issue. The HIAA complains that
hospitals increasingly are erecting barriers to keep them
from auditing questionable hospital bills. Some hospitals
have begun charging several hundred dollars or more just for
the right to audit a bill. The association also complains
that hospitals discourage audits through stalling tactics.</p>
<p>Partly as a result of these barriers, insurers rarely
review bills under $5,000, the Senate panel said.</p>
