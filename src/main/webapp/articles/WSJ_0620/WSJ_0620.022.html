	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- Housing starts sank further in May, reaching
their lowest level since the recession month of October 1982,
the Commerce Department reported.
   Builders began work on houses and apartments last month at
an annual rate of 1,207,000 units, down 1.4% from April's
rate of 1,224,000, the department said. Starts fell 6.4% in
April and 12.2% in March. They haven't increased since
January, when they surged 23.2% to a 1,568,000 annual rate,
partly as a result of unseasonally warm weather. The figures
are adjusted for seasonal variations.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Analysts said the downward trend in housing starts is a
further sign of the sluggish U.S. economy. They cited a
slowdown in job growth, high interest rates and a credit
crunch in some areas, combined with a large inventory of
unsold homes.</p>
<p>"The inventory situation, which is fairly serious,
combined with the weak economic fundamentals . . . suggests
to builders they ought to hold off on construction in the
market," said David Seiders, chief economist for the National
Association of Home Builders.</p>
<p>While housing starts were weak across the board, showing
continued declines in both single-family and multifamily
housing, analysts say the apartment market is the
hardest-hit.</p>
<p>Contributing to the decline in apartment construction,
several economists said, is the lack of detailed regulations
for complying with a new law intended to make housing more
accessible to the handicapped. The Department of Housing and
Urban Development has been late in coming out with the
guidelines, Mr. Seiders said, and this has "put the
multifamily builders in a state of limbo because the
contractors don't know the rules they are operating under."</p>
<p>Construction of single-family homes in May fell 1%, to an
annual rate of 896,000 units, after a 9.1% drop in April. It
was the lowest number since the 862,000 rate in December
1982.</p>
<p>Work on apartments and other multifamily dwellings slipped
2.5% to an annual rate of 311,000 after rising 2.6% to an
annual rate of 319,000 in April.</p>
<p>Regionally, the report said housing starts in the
Northeast and South registered slight increases, to which
economists responded with little optimism.</p>
<p>"In statistical terms the changes aren't very
significant," said David Berson, chief economist for the
Federal National Mortgage Association. "For the last couple
of months all regions of the country have been depressed
compared to where they were in 1989, and the only part of the
country where that may not be true is the Midwest."</p>
<p>The number of building permits issued for future
construction declined 4.6% in May to a 1,057,000 annual rate
after dropping 10.1% in April to an annual rate of 1,108,000.</p>
