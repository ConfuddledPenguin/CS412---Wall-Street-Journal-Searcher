	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Investor Peter B. Bedford nearly doubled his
stake in Amrep Corp., and he said he and management have
discussed possible board representation for him or a
designee.
   In a Securities and Exchange Commission filing in
Washington, Mr. Bedford, president of the Lafayette, Calif.,
real estate developer Bedford Properties Inc., disclosed that
his stake in Amrep jumped to 16.16% from 8.7%. Mr. Bedford
said in the filing that he acquired the holding as an
investment.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Mr. Bedford now holds 1,070,020 Amrep common shares,
including 500,320 bought May 4 to June 15 for $7.375 to $7.50
each. In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday,
Amrep shares rose 12.5 cents to $7.75.</p>
<p>Amrep, based here and led by Howard W. Friedman, chairman
and chief executive officer, is a real estate developer and
international magazine distributor. The company has 6.6
million shares outstanding.</p>
<p>Mr. Friedman confirmed that discussions with Mr. Bedford
are under way. "We're pleased that the Bedford organization
recognizes the values" inherent in Amrep, the executive said.</p>
<p>Recently, Kane-Miller Corp., a Tarrytown, N.Y., food
processor, disclosed to the SEC that it holds 8.1% of Amrep
and might seek control of the concern. In that filing,
Kane-Miller said it had talked with Amrep about gaining board
representation, but it said those discussions were
"uneventful."</p>
<p>Neither a Kane-Miller spokesman nor Mr. Bedford was
available for comment.</p>
