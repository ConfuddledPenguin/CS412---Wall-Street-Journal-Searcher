	<p class="article-leader">CHICAGO -- Chicago Mercantile Exchange members, in a show
of support for exchange leadership, defeated a proposal that
would have required any member receiving more than $50,000 a
year from the exchange to be an elected governor of the Merc.
   The proposal was viewed by many Merc members as a
referendum on the rule of Leo Melamed, the undisputed leader
of the futures exchange for more than two decades. For
several years Mr. Melamed has served as chairman of the
Merc's executive committee and as special counsel to the
board. He was appointed to those positions by the Merc's
governors, many of whom owe their seats on the board to Mr.
Melamed's support. His annual salary is $500,000.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>About 59%, or 923, of the Merc members voting opposed the
proposal, while 41%, or 644, favored it, the exchange said. A
majority voting in favor of the proposal, which resulted from
a membership petition, was required for its adoption.
Weighting the votes in favor of full Merc memberships as
opposed to memberships in the exchange's different divisions
made the vote against the proposal even more lop-sided.</p>
<p>Mr. Melamed, who has said he is resigning from his Merc
positions at year end, and other Merc officers campaigned
against the proposal by phoning Merc clearing member firms
and buttonholing traders on and off the exchange floor. In a
letter sent to members, the board lambasted the proposal,
stating, "board members have the duty and authority to
establish policy and govern exchange affairs, including the
right to determine appropriate compensation."</p>
<p>Backers of the proposal countered in their own mailing
that "members in positions of designing exchange policy must
be answerable and accountable for their actions."</p>
<p>Mr. Melamed is widely credited, even by traders who think
he should be directly accountable to the membership via
election to the board, with propelling the Merc from the
status of a sleepy agricultural futures market to a world
leader in financial futures trading.</p>
