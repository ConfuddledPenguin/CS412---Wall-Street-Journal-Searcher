	<p class="article-leader">There is a phrase even more horrifying to trial lawyers
than Case Dismissed. This is Rule 11 of the Federal Rules of
Civil Procedure. What sounds like a technicality is the
country's most effective deterrent against frivolous cases.
It hits abusive lawyers where it hurts -- in the pocket.
There's even a former attorney general among the errant
lawyers fined under this rule.
   The adoption of a toughened Rule 11 by the courts in 1983
was a formal admission that litigation was out of control.
The rule says judges "shall" assess fines on lawyers who file
court papers that are not "well grounded in fact" or
"warranted by existing law" or are "to harass," "cause
unnecessary delay" or "needless increase in the cost of
litigation."</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Wags may say this covers most cases, but it wasn't until
this term that the Supreme Court issued detailed opinions on
Rule 11. In one case, the court said only the lawyer who
signs the offending legal paper is liable, not his law firm.
The second case, earlier this month, bashed lawyers for a
menswear business who filed a frivolous class-action
antitrust claim against Hartmarx as part of a contract
dispute. The court said the lawyers were liable for $21,000
even though they had withdrawn the lawsuit. In an 8 to 1
opinion, Justice Sandra Day O'Connor rejected the argument
that Rule 11 "chills creative litigation." She said trial
judges need the discretion to punish lawyers as a way of
"curbing abuses of the judicial system."</p>
<p>This comes after the justices in May refused to hear the
appeal of former Attorney General Ramsey Clark, who faces a
not-yet-determined fine. Mr. Clark, who served under
President Johnson, represented Libyans who sued President
Reagan and Prime Minister Thatcher for their role in the 1886
bombing of Muammar Qadhafi's headquarters. Guess the alleged
offense? Mr. Reagan and Mrs. Thatcher were accused of being
RICO racketeers.</p>
<p>Not too surprisingly, the trial judge found that the "case
offered no hope whatsoever of success, and plaintiffs'
attorneys surely knew it." The appeals court in Washington
insisted on a fine, saying that "we do not conceive it a
proper function of a federal court to serve as a forum for
`protests,' to the detriment of parties with serious disputes
waiting to be heard."</p>
<p>Politics and the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt
Organizations law make a heady brew for Rule 11. The Christic
Institute RICOed a long list of defendants, including retired
Gen. John Singlaub, for running drugs, committing murder,
etc., and helping the Nicaraguan Contras. Federal Judge
Lawrence King of Florida last year said the case was
"unsubstantiated rumor and speculation from unidentified
sources." He ordered Christic and its chief
conspiratorialist, Daniel Sheehan, to pay $1 million toward
the defendants' legal bills.</p>
<p>Radical lawyer William Kunstler, a lawyer from a Christic
affiliate and a law professor were fined $120,000 last year.
Part of their defense of two Indians who took hostages in a
North Carolina newspaper office was to accuse top state
officials of various civil rights offenses and allege that a
sheriff ran drugs. Judge Malcolm Howard called it all
frivolous, "not to vindicate constitutional rights, but more
probably to gain publicity."</p>
<p>Political cases aside, many Rule 11 sanctions are to
punish efforts to coerce deep-pocket defendants to pay
something, anything, to be rid of a nuisance case. Last year
a law school graduate sued Capital Cities/ABC for $2 million
plus 1,000 shares. The firm's offense? Requiring him to buy a
surety bond before it replaced certificates for two shares he
lost worth $243.</p>
<p>New York business law has long allowed firms to demand
bonds to indemnify against possible claims, but the plaintiff
said this amounted to "unconscionability" and even claimed
emotional distress. A New York court said this was
ridiculous, noted that the plaintiff had "a long history of
bringing baseless claims in a variety of forums," and fined
him $5,000.</p>
<p>Here's another howler. In 1984, a lawyer sued San
Francisco for violating his free speech and equal-protection
rights when police officers stopped his softball game in an
off-limits part of a park. "Plaintiff does not allege any
facts suggesting communicative expression or symbolic conduct
sufficient to fall within the scope of the First Amendment,"
Judge William Schwarzer ruled. "There is no indication that
persons observing plaintiff playing softball in Golden Gate
Park would understand his conduct to be a message `about the
right to democracy in recreation as opposed to elitism.'" He
fined the plaintiff $50,000.</p>
<p>Only a minuscule fraction of the 250,000 civil cases filed
each year in federal court (or in the 38 states with similar
rules) result in sanctions. Fordham law professor Georgene
Vairo found that in the four years ending in 1987, sanctions
were sought in some 700 federal cases and granted in just
over half. It's usually the plaintiff lawyer who's fined.</p>
<p>Some critics of Rule 11 say it punishes cases that should
be brought. The New York Legislature threatens to suspend its
version of Rule 11 partly because of fears that worthy
arguments will be stifled. Last week, the New York State Bar
issued a report that proposes making the test "abusive
conduct" by lawyers instead of "frivolous conduct."</p>
<p>It's a little hard to get worked up over the prospect of
chilling imaginative lawsuits. After all, it was legal
creativity stamped with approval by activist judges that got
us into this mess in the first place. For example, 30 years
ago it would have been frivolous and/or abusive to argue that
a defendant should be liable regardless of fault simply
because it's a big corporation. This "enterprise liability"
is now the law in many jurisdictions.</p>
<p>The better argument against Rule 11 is that the barn door
is already closed. Who can know what case is frivolous? The
breakdown in American law makes it hard to say which legal
argument deserves to be punished -- and which some day will
be declared a winner by some judge somewhere. Remember the
$10 billion judgment against Texaco by Pennzoil?</p>
<p>One sign that Rule 11 won't solve the problem is that
plaintiffs and defendants now often preemptively -- and
frivolously -- sue each other under Rule 11. There's an
alternative. Other common-law countries don't have frivolous
cases because they have the English rule on costs: Loser
pays. Litigants in non-criminal cases avoid high-risk
arguments for fear of having to pay the winner's legal costs.
Maybe critics of Rule 11 should join the bandwagon in the
U.S. to switch to the English rule.</p>
