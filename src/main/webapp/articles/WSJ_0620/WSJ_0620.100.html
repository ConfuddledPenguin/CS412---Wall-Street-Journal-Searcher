	<p class="article-leader">SAN FRANCISCO -- A California appeals court upheld a
ruling by the state's insurance commissioner that allows the
state's Department of Insurance to obtain lump-sum payments
of future policyholder claims from the reinsurers of Mission
Insurance Co.
   Mission and its units were declared insolvent and placed
in liquidation by California insurance regulators in February
1987. The appellate court ruling dismissed a challenge by
Underwriters Reinsurance Co., one of Mission's reinsurers, to
the state's demand that it pay claims for future damages
based on an industrywide actuarial method of calculating
expected future claims.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Claims costs that are not paid by reinsurers would be
passed on to the public through assessments by the California
Insurance Guarantee Association. There are no estimates of
what future claims might amount to; so far, however, the
state has collected more than $250 million on behalf of
California consumers.</p>
<p>"This goes a long way towards ensuring that the public
will not have to pay for the mistakes of Mission and its
reinsurers," Insurance Commissioner Roxani Gillespie said.
"The reinsurers will no longer be able to drag their feet and
avoid paying balances due on the premise that my demand for
all damages, including those which will occur in the future,
is premature."</p>
