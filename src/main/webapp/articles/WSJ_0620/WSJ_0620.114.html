	<p class="article-leader">KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) -- The Kansas City Evening News will
print its 27th and final edition today even though it was
making a profit, Publisher Stephen F. Rose announced.
   Mr. Rose blamed the newspaper's demise on city officials
who were forcing him to take its teen-age sales force off the
streets.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"We were forced to make a very painful decision, to go
down in history as perhaps the only paper to close while
making money," Mr. Rose said. "We simply wouldn't be making
any money if we had to convert to home delivery."</p>
<p>Mr. Rose, who is president of a family-owned group of 18
suburban weekly papers called Sun Publications Inc., was the
sole investor in the Evening News, an afternoon tabloid.</p>
<p>It was the second unsuccessful attempt to start a
metropolitan newspaper in recent months. Ralph Ingersoll II
launched the St. Louis Sun in September but closed that
afternoon tabloid in April, citing insufficient circulation.</p>
<p>Mr. Rose said Kansas City, Mo., authorities had been
cracking down on the street sellers, including issuing a
ticket to one and forcing others to move off street medians.
City officials cited safety and traffic considerations.</p>
<p>Apart from its street sales, The Evening News was sold in
news racks and stores. About 22,800 papers were sold when the
paper started May 14. Last week, Mr. Rose said, sales were
averaging about 15,000 copies a day.</p>
