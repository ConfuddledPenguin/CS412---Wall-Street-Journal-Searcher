	<p class="article-leader">AKRON, Ohio -- Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co., citing
sluggishness in the U.S. auto industry and other factors,
said it expects to post a second-quarter loss of as much as
$10 million after a pretax restructuring charge of $35
million.
   About 1,100 employees involved in tire sales and marketing
in the U.S. will lose their jobs as part of the
restructuring, the company said.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>In the 1989 second quarter, Goodyear earned $27.1 million,
or 47 cents a share, on sales of $2.8 billion. Results
included an after-tax charge of $95 million related to the
sale of unused pipe.</p>
<p>Also, the tire maker said it expects 1990 second-half
results to about match its disappointing 1989 second half, in
which it earned $85.2 million, or $1.57 a share, on sales of
$5.42 billion.</p>
<p>On the news, tire industry analyst Harry Millis, of
McDonald & Co., Cleveland, reduced his full-year earnings
estimate to about $2 a share, excluding any charges, down
from $2.55 a share. Mr. Millis said job cutbacks were about
double what he had expected.</p>
<p>In 1989 Goodyear earned $206.8 million, or $3.58 a share,
on sales of $10.87 billion. Results included a gain of $17.4
million from a tax-loss carry-forward offset by a charge of
$105.9 million, primarily from the sale of the company's
South African subsidiary.</p>
<p>In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange,
Goodyear closed yesterday at $33.75, off 25 cents.</p>
<p>Goodyear, which has about 50,000 employees in the U.S.,
said it's eliminating its five tire sales field offices in an
effort to make sales and marketing more efficient and
responsive to customers. In April, the company created two
new units: one for consumer tires that serves mostly the
passenger tire market and the other for commercial tires.
Each group has 28 sales regions and 43 sales districts.</p>
<p>McDonald's Mr. Millis said there haven't been any pleasant
surprises for Goodyear this year except that sales volume of
replacement tires has increased. However, he said, pricing on
replacement tires has been weak. Although he said pricing on
tires shipped to domestic auto makers has been fairly good,
volume has been off. He also said Goodyear has been hurt by a
pricing war on tires shipped to European auto makers as well.</p>
<p>Goodyear has other nagging problems. A prolonged strike at
its tire plant in Turkey is costing the company about five
cents a share each month in lost earnings, Mr. Millis said.
The company also continues to be hurt by the carrying costs
of its west-to-east crude oil pipeline and startup costs at a
tire plant in Canada.</p>
