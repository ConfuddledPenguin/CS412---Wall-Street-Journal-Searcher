	<p class="article-leader">Public Service Co. of New Mexico named new top officers,
but the two have long histories with the troubled utility,
and critics contend they will bring very little change.
   "They are not new blood," said Ellen O'Brien, a legal
assistant for the city of Albuquerque, referring to John
Ackerman, a former division head who was named president and
chief executive officer, and Ashton B. Collins Jr., a
longtime director who was named chairman. "They are just
changing seats," Ms. O'Brien said.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Mr. Ackerman, an electrical engineer by training, has
worked for the utility for 19 years, most recently as
president and chief operating officer of its Gas Co. of New
Mexico unit. The 48-year-old automotive hobbyist, who
couldn't be reached to comment, was also named to the
company's board.</p>
<p>Mr. Collins, 58, is president of Reddy Communications, a
closely held firm in Albuquerque that provides research
services to electric utilities, including PS New Mexico. He
has been one of the utility's directors since 1979.</p>
<p>The two succeed Jerry D. Geist, 56-year-old executive who
retired as chairman, president and chief executive, effective
with yesterday's board meeting. Mr. Geist, closely associated
with the ambitious expansion plans that led to many of PS New
Mexico's recent woes, said in a statement, "My departure will
facilitate and encourage the resolution of current problems."
Mr. Geist was in meetings and couldn't be reached.</p>
<p>Chief among those problems is a passel of disgruntled
customers, including Albuquerque, PS New Mexico's home town.
The city and other rate payers have berated the utility for
15 years about rates they say skyrocketed when the utility
embarked on efforts to diversify beyond regulated businesses
and to increase its generating capacity in order to sell
energy throughout the Southwest. When the Sun Belt boom
fizzled, PS New Mexico was left with a capacity reserve 66%
above its peak demand.</p>
<p>"Their eyes have been bigger than their stomach," said
Randy Childress, a deputy attorney general for the state of
New Mexico. "In a nutshell, this company has been
overaggressive."</p>
<p>Many blame Mr. Geist for PS New Mexico's troubles. "Jerry
wasn't going to be satisfied with a small electric utility,"
said Don Hancock of the Southwest Research and Information
Center, a nonprofit group that has intervened in PS New
Mexico rate cases for rate payers. "He wanted to make an
impact" well beyond his service region.</p>
<p>But the state's public service commission has never made
Mr. Geist the issue. "Jerry Geist has not become a
personality in this as far as we're concerned," said Martin
Blake, a commissioner. "He has always been cooperative and
tried to shoot straight."</p>
<p>The commission has simply been disinclined to let PS New
Mexico recoup its costs for producing power that isn't
needed, especially its $1.2 billion investment in the Palo
Verde nuclear project. Denied rate increases since 1984 --
and actually hit with rate decreases -- the utility has
reduced its work force by one-fifth, suspended its common
dividend and taken substantial charges to bail out of its
nonutility businesses. The company has even encouraged
takeover talk.</p>
<p>Some of his harshest detractors say Mr. Geist apparently
left the company he had worked for for 30 years of his own
accord. "That board has never forced Jerry to do anything he
didn't want to do," said Mr. Hancock.</p>
<p>Mr. Collins, the new chairman, exhorts critics to "stay
tuned. The board and management team are strong individuals
on their own who will forge a good future" for the company.</p>
<p>He acknowledged that Mr. Geist was chief architect of PS
New Mexico's ill-fated expansion plans. But he also said that
Mr. Geist "is an extraordinary and gifted leader who will be
far more appreciated by the next generation than by this
one." He cited PS New Mexico's 15-year-old pollution-control
program, which many say sets the pace for the industry,
especially given the provisions of the Clean Air Act.</p>
