	<p class="article-leader">DALLAS -- A U.S. bankruptcy judge ruled that the Federal
Deposit Insurance Corp. can't use its $1 billion claim
against First RepublicBank Corp. for voting purposes when
creditors decide the fate of the company's plan to emerge
from Chapter 11 proceedings.
   The preliminary ruling by Judge Steven Felsenthal
increases the likelihood that creditors will approve the plan
and cast doubt on some of the legal arguments the FDIC has
made in defending itself against a lawsuit filed in U.S.
district court here by some creditors.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"This was a stunning victory for us," said Bruce Hendry, a
creditor from Minneapolis. "I hope it leads to a settlement
with the FDIC, which is the most reasonable route for both
parties to take at this time."</p>
<p>The FDIC's $1 billion claim, the largest of several it is
asserting against First RepublicBank, stems from a loan the
agency made to the company's Dallas and Houston banks shortly
before they failed in 1988. The loan was guaranteed by First
RepublicBank and a second-tier holding company, IFRB Corp.,
as well as by other banks in the company's system.</p>
<p>But in his ruling, Judge Felsenthal held that the
guarantee amounted to a fraudulent conveyance of assets to
the FDIC because the holding company didn't receive an
equivalent value in return.</p>
<p>The creditors "would have been far better off if the FDIC
had allowed {the Dallas bank} to fail" rather than propping
it up with a loan that eventually led all the other banks to
fail, too, Judge Rosenthal said.</p>
<p>Although Judge Felsenthal's ruling is preliminary and only
concerns the FDIC's ability to vote its claims in the
bankruptcy case, attorneys for creditors were cheered by his
determination that the FDIC was unlikely to prevail in
certain arguments before the district court. In that case,
creditors allege that regulators acted illegally in seizing
most of First RepublicBank's banks and seek damages that
could reach into the billions of dollars.</p>
<p>First RepublicBank's reorganization plan calls for the
establishment of a fund to pay the FDIC pending the outcome
of the lawsuit. First RepublicBank, which isn't related to
First Republic Bancorp of San Francisco, and IFRB list assets
totaling $384 million.</p>
<p>An attorney for the FDIC said the agency may appeal the
decision.</p>
