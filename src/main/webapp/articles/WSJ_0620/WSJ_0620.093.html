	<p class="article-leader">ICN Biomedicals Inc., Costa Mesa, Calif., said fiscal
second-quarter net income rose 78% to $2.8 million from $1.5
million a year ago, reflecting higher international sales and
other benefits of a recent acquisition.
   Sales more than doubled to $35.3 million from $14.2
million in the quarter ended May 31. Per-share net was 25
cents compared with 15 cents, restated to reflect a 20% stock
dividend paid in August.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>ICN Biomedicals attributed its increases to the strength
of the company's development and marketing of biomedical
research tests and to the sales volume of Flow Laboratories,
acquired in November.</p>
<p>The company said that international sales jumped to $20.8
million from $1.7 million, mainly reflecting Flow sales,
which are primarily in Europe, Japan and Australia. Flow
produces laboratory equipment, live cells and related
products for life-science research.</p>
<p>In national over-the-counter trading, ICN Biomedicals fell
12.5 cents to $9.625.</p>
