	<p class="article-leader">Allegheny Ludlum Corp. told securities analysts that its
markets, except for automotive, are strong and that orders
are 25% ahead of its 1990 plan.
   In the current fiscal second quarter, ending July 2, the
company said shipments should be up at least 10% from the
year-earlier's 126,419 tons. In the 1989 second quarter the
company earned $36.7 million, or $1.63 a share.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>However, the Pittsburgh specialty steel producer said it
expects sales in the latest quarter to decline from $333.8
million a year ago, citing the absence of raw material
surcharges.</p>
<p>"We are surprised at the strength in the market. Our
backlog is growing, exports are turning up, and the third
quarter is looking much stronger than anticipated," the
company said.</p>
