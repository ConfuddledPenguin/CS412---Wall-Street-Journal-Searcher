	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Crude oil prices fell to their lowest level in
18 months in a market plagued by oversupply.
   Despite some signs that production by the Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries is declining slightly, prices
continued to slip. Any token cuts by cartel members Kuwait
and the United Arab Emirates are having little impact "in a
market grossly oversupplied with crude," said Andrew Lebow,
analyst for E.D. & F. Man International Futures Inc.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The futures price of West Texas Intermediate crude oil for
delivery during July fell 29 cents a barrel to $15.65, while
crude for August declined by three cents to $16.92 a barrel.
Action was brisk as trading of the July contract came to an
end yesterday. Futures prices declined for all barrels of the
U.S. benchmark crude being traded through the rest of the
year.</p>
<p>Gasoline and heating oil prices declined as well.</p>
<p>Early trading today may receive some support from
statistics released after trading yesterday by the American
Petroleum Institute. With inventory levels being such an
important factor in the pricing picture, traders have been
anxiously awaiting the release of these numbers.</p>
<p>The figures showed that U.S. crude inventories last week
declined by 1.2 million barrels to 384.4 million. But
industry experts point out that despite the decline, crude
stocks still remain 44.3 million barrels above last year's
level.</p>
<p>Gasoline stocks fell to 216.6 million barrels from 217
million the previous week.</p>
<p>Putting more downward pressure on oil prices, at least
eight oil companies, including Chevron Corp. and Mobil Corp.,
cut the posted price for their crudes yesterday.</p>
<p>In other commodity markets yesterday:</p>
<p>LIVESTOCK and MEATS: Prices of hog and pork belly futures
contracts slid lower on continuing speculation that record
high retail prices of pork are cooling consumer demand, said
Jerry Abbenhaus, an analyst at A.G. Edwards & Sons, St.
Louis. Prices of hogs and pork soared earlier this spring
amid unexpectedly tight supplies of hogs ready for slaughter.
In recent weeks, hog prices have cooled amid signs that
supermarkets are cutting back their pork purchases and
promoting beef and poultry more heavily. The price of the hog
contract for June delivery, for example, has slipped 8% in
trading so far this month. Traders are divided over whether
the price decline is running out of steam. Some analysts are
speculating that hog prices are past their peak because
farmers are likely to begin expanding their herds. Others,
however, reason that prices might pop up again in the summer,
which is when hog prices often reach their peak.</p>
<p>COPPER: Futures prices fell back from recent advances. The
July contract ended with a loss of 0.90 cents a pound at
$1.13. By late last week the market had become oversold and
began to rise, one analyst noted. On Monday the July contract
hit a high for the move at $1.1540, he said, but yesterday
its highest level was $1.1530, he noted. That technical
development indicated that the rally had run its course, he
said. Also, he said, while prices were rising, the open
interest, or contracts outstanding that remain to be
nullified by an opposite trade or fulfilled by delivery of
the commodity, fell. "This means that the buying during the
rally for the most part was really liquidation by traders
who'd previously sold short," he said. Another analyst said
the market fell simply because it ran out of rumors. On
Monday, there was a report, which proved unfounded, that O.K.
Tedi, a large mine in Papua New Guinea, had labor
difficulties, and there has been talk that Asarco Inc., a
large U.S. producer, was encountering problems in its talks
with the United Steelworkers Union, the analyst said. The
current contract expires June 30. "Actually," he said, "the
O.K. Tedi rumor had some impact Monday, but the Asarco one
hasn't. The price went down because traders don't believe
it." An Asarco spokesman confirmed that the union had asked
for a strike vote, but added, "That's a normal move in the
course of negotiations. They're still dealing with local
issues."</p>
<p>ORANGE JUICE: Futures prices fell sharply for the third
consecutive day. The July contract ended with a loss of 9.60
cents a pound at $1.6670 after its daily permissible limit
decline of 10 cents left the price at $1.6630. In three
trading sessions the cumulative loss has been 23.45 cents.
All other deferred months dropped their five-cent daily limit
for the third straight day. The limit will be expanded today
to eight cents. The collapse began after two recent reports
were misconstrued by traders, said Judith Ganes, analyst for
Merrill Lynch & Co., New York. Two weeks ago, several small
Brazilian processors offered European and Canadian customers
a limited quantity of the concentrate for a short time at
special prices, said Ms. Ganes. "This gave rise to the false
belief that Brazil was cutting prices and a selling wave hit
the market," said Ms. Ganes. Last week, the Florida
Department of Citrus reported April consumption in the U.S.
was sharply below a year earlier, which created further
pessimism among traders, she said. "What traders didn't take
into account is that last year's consumption figure was
really skewed and larger than normal because there had been a
significant switch to orange juice from apple juice by
consumers because of the Alar chemical scare," Ms. Ganes
said. This distortion exaggerated the year-to-year drop, she
said. Ms. Ganes noted, however, that a price rebound may be
in the making. Processor demand for contracts has been active
but has been overcome by the heavy speculative selling. July
2 is the first day on which notices to deliver concentrate
against July contracts will be issued. Fundamentals still
indicate a tight supply situation, and the Brazilian selling
price, $2.12 a pound, remains well above the U.S. market, she
noted. "If processors can survive the selling over the next
two weeks, they can ask for delivery of the concentrate. The
bulk of the sellers are funds and speculators, who don't have
the material to deliver. If they begin to buy back contracts
to avoid delivery commitments, the price could shoot up," she
said.</p>
