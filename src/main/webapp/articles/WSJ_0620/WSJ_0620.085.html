	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Stock prices rebounded only modestly from
their sharp drop Monday as worries about corporate earnings
and interest rates made for another day of sluggish trading.
   Buyers focused largely on growth stocks, especially those
in the consumer sector, in an effort to dodge any possible
disappointments in second-quarter earnings reports.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 11.38 to 2893.56
after posting its sharpest loss in five months Monday, when
the 30-stock average fell 53.71 points. A rally in Philip
Morris and solid gains among other blue-chip consumer issues
fueled the recovery.</p>
<p>Trading activity, however, improved only marginally from
Monday's pace as the plunge in prices failed to stimulate
much bargain-hunting among investors. Volume on the New York
Stock Exchange totaled 134,930,000 shares; in the prior
session, 133,470,000 changed hands.</p>
<p>Many institutions will close their books on the second
quarter Friday, the last day on which trades can be made for
settlement before the end of the period. With that deadline
approaching, "People are saying, `Well, the market's had a
nice run. What do we do here?' " said Larry Greenwald, a
block trader at Sanford C. Bernstein & Co.</p>
<p>Broader market indexes kept pace with the industrial
average, as Standard & Poor's 500-Stock Index gained 1.59 to
358.47, the New York Stock Exchange Composite Index went up
0.68 to 195.61 and the Dow Jones Equity Market Index added
1.27 to 333.77.</p>
<p>But advancing issues outpaced decliners narrowly on the
Big Board, where 788 issues rose in price and 710 fell, and
secondary issues generally failed to share in the advance.
Prices dropped slightly on the over-the-counter market, and
the American Stock Exchange Market Value Index posted a
fractional gain.</p>
<p>Stocks peaked in early trading within a point of 2900 on
the Dow industrials, but two late-morning bursts of sell
programs linked to stock-index arbitrage erased those gains.
The programs, involving the sale of stocks and the purchase
of index-futures contracts, went into effect after the
futures slipped to relatively low levels compared with the
cash indexes.</p>
<p>But index arbitrage worked in the market's favor during
the afternoon, traders said, as an outburst of program buying
played a part in its upturn.</p>
<p>The advance came against the backdrop of continued
weakness in bond prices, which have been on the decline since
last week's round of economic reports dimmed hopes for any
moves by the Federal Reserve to ease monetary policy.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, a recent spate of indications that
second-quarter earnings may fall short of expectations "just
drives people to the stocks where they have a high confidence
of near-term earnings performance," said A. Marshall Acuff
Jr., a portfolio strategist at Smith Barney, Harris Upham &
Co.</p>
<p>Growth stocks "have been the leaders in the market, and as
far as I'm concerned, they'll remain the leaders," Mr. Acuff
said, as investors concentrate on issues with "the best
quality, the strongest financials, and the highest visibility
of earnings."</p>
<p>Philip Morris climbed 1 1/2 to 44 1/4 as 1.6 million
shares changed hands in Big Board composite trading. Other
consumer stocks giving a lift to the industrial average
included American Telephone & Telegraph, which added 5/8 to
42 1/2; Procter & Gamble, which climbed 1 1/8 to 83 5/8, and
Woolworth, which rose 5/8 to 33 3/4.</p>
<p>On the other hand, Occidental Petroleum fell 5/8 to 26 as
Standard & Poor's decision to downgrade the company's debt
and preferred stock ratings sparked heavy selling. The stock
traded as low as 25 3/8 and was the Big Board's most active
issue by a wide margin, with about 2.6 million shares traded.</p>
<p>S&P's action, which the rating agency attributed to high
fixed costs, heavy dividend requirements and anticipated
earnings weakness at Occidental, triggered speculation that
the company may sell its 51% interest in IBP in order to
improve its financial position. IBP rose 1 to 18 1/8 on about
four times the stock's average volume. Occidental declined to
comment.</p>
<p>Chrysler gained 1 1/8 to 16 5/8 on 1.7 million shares,
reflecting speculation that Italy's Fiat may acquire a major
stake in the company as part of an alliance currently under
discussion. Fiat officials, however, said the most likely
outcome of the talks is an arrangement under which the
Italian concern helps Chrysler develop new models.</p>
<p>Motorola fell 7/8 to 85. A federal judge in Texas ordered
the company to pull its most successful computer chip, the
68030, off the market as the result of a patent dispute with
Japan's Hitachi.</p>
<p>Monsanto dropped 3/4 to 50. Merrill Lynch lowered its
estimates of the company's earnings for this year and next,
based on a belief that its agricultural division will suffer
because wet weather is hampering the planting of corn.</p>
<p>Goodyear Tire & Rubber, which disclosed plans to
restructure its U.S. tire and sales operations, eased 1/4 to
33 3/4. The company estimated that it would report a
second-quarter loss of as much as $10 million after charges
related to the restructuring.</p>
<p>MGM/UA Communications fell 1 1/8 to 17 1/8 amid published
reports that Time Warner may be reconsidering its offer to
provide $650 million in financing for Pathe Communications'
proposed takeover of the company. Pathe remained unchanged at
3 7/8, while Time Warner added 7/8 to 105 1/8.</p>
<p>Wendy's International, the subject of yesterday's "Heard
on the Street" column in this newspaper, dropped 1/8 to 6
3/4. The stock reached a two-year high last week amid
speculation that PepsiCo may be interested in the company,
but analysts are skeptical of the rumors.</p>
<p>Kuhlman rose 1/2 to 12 5/8. The company agreed to sell its
blow-molded plastics business for about $45 million to a
subsidiary of Solvay, a Belgian concern.</p>
<p>The Amex Market Value Index added 0.07 to 360.83. Volume
totaled 9,040,000 shares.</p>
