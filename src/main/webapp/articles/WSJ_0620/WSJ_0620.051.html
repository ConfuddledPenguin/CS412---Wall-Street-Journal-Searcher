	<p class="article-leader">MOSCOW -- Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev opened a
crucial meeting by endorsing a new Russian Federation
Communist Party, but assailing those who want to make the new
party a stronghold of opposition to his reforms.
   The meeting of communists in the Russian Federation of the
Soviet Union is seen as a preview of next month's important
Soviet Communist Party Congress where Mr. Gorbachev is
expected to come under attack from the right and left.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Russia is the only one of the 15 Soviet republics without
its own party structure. While Mr. Gorbachev yielded to the
growing force of Russian nationalism by backing the new
party, he also warned that it shouldn't be used to increase
the separatist tensions that are straining the Soviet Union.
"We must exclude any forms of confrontation between the
Russian Federation and the Soviet Union," he said.</p>
<p>Delegates to the Russian party conference voted 2,607 to
61, with 16 abstentions, to adopt the agenda proposed by Mr.
Gorbachev. Under it, they will consider the formation of the
Russian party and debate the proposed platform of the
national congress.</p>
<p>The impetus for Mr. Gorbachev's reluctant endorsement of
the party was the emergence of his populist rival, Boris
Yeltsin, as the new president of the Russian Federation. Mr.
Yeltsin promotes the "sovereignty" of Russia.</p>
<p>The creation of a Russian Communist Party could help Mr.
Gorbachev by offsetting Mr. Yeltsin's power. Perhaps as
important as any of the words at the first day of the
conference, was the scene of Mr. Yeltsin smiling warmly on
the dais as he chatted with Mr. Gorbachev.</p>
<p>Earlier there had been rumors that Mr. Yeltsin might
resign from the Communist Party at next month's meeting, a
move that could foster a split between the party's
conservative and democratic groupings. Mr. Yeltsin's plans
still aren't clear, but his position on the dais surrounded
by Soviet politburo members helped establish an image of the
rebel as part of the central leadership.</p>
<p>Prime Minister Nikolai Ryzhkov also occupied a prominent
seat at the front of the huge hall in the Kremlin, at times
presiding over the meeting. Monday, a senior party official
suggested Mr. Ryzhkov as one possible candidate for first
secretary of a new Russian party.</p>
<p>Mr. Gorbachev defended a rapid transition to a "regulated
market economy" as the completion of unfinished
de-Stalinization. The Soviet leader forcefully rejected the
arguments of the right in a way that may have a certain
appeal in a country where most people aren't sure what a
market economy is. He told a nationwide television audience
that it is ridiculous to call the movement toward a market a
step back toward capitalism. "The market existed long before
capitalism," he said.</p>
<p>Mr. Gorbachev's speech was followed by attacks from both
sides. Democratic reformists, concerned that a Russian
Federation Communist Party will be controlled by
conservatives, said its creation should be postponed until
basic political concepts could be discussed and voted on by
the public. The reformers are seeking to break the party's
monopoly over government and turn it into a parliamentary
party that would have to compete for power.</p>
<p>Old-line communists assailed the central leadership for
perverting the process of establishing a new party. The
leadership "has reduced the party to crouching unarmed in the
trenches under massive shelling by anti-Socialist forces,"
said delegate Ivan Osadchiy, according to Tass news service.
"Only a Communist Party of the Leninist type" can pull Russia
out of its crisis.</p>
<p>Mr. Gorbachev urged the gradual separation of party from
state operations. But an ironic glimpse of the current state
of reform came when Mr. Gorbachev slipped into old patterns
and called for a vote on a motion to order state television
to fully broadcast the event.</p>
<p>Only some time later, when radical Leningrad Mayor Anatoli
Sobchak took the floor and pointed out that the party has no
right to make such an order did Mr. Gorbachev reconsider.
Agreeing, he called for another vote to "reflect the reality
that all we can do is request."</p>
