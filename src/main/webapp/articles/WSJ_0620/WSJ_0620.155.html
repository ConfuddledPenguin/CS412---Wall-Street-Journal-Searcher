	<p class="article-leader">Disadvantage Chrysler: A Missouri jury has slapped the
auto maker with a $1 million penalty for selling a "new" 1985
New Yorker that had been wrecked during a factory official's
test drive.
   The decision, issued last week, stems from the
embarrassing odometer-rollback episode that Chrysler thought
it had put to bed in 1987. Last week a Buchanan County
Circuit Court jury rejected Chairman Lee A. Iacocca's
defense: Repairing a car that's banged up during a test drive
is no different than fixing one that gets damaged on the
assembly line.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Auto makers never "provide notice to dealers or customers
about damage or defects that are discovered and corrected
during the manufacturing process," Mr. Iacocca testified in
deposition taken on May 2 at Chrysler's Highland Park, Mich.,
headquarters. Excerpts of the deposition were read to the
jury during the trial last week.</p>
<p>Cars that were damaged during test drives were repaired to
meet "each and every Chrysler quality and federal safety
standard," Mr. Iacocca said. He added: "Does it make any
difference whether the component was manufactured defectively
. . . or damaged while the vehicle was being driven in the
test program? The common sense answer to that is no."</p>
<p>But by a 9-to-3 majority, the jurors ruled that what
Chrysler did was civil fraud. They ordered the company to pay
$1 million in punitive damages. They also ordered Chrysler to
pay $3,000 to compensate Steven and Diane Maugh of St.
Joseph, Mo., for the difference between the $16,190 they paid
for the New Yorker in 1985, and what the jury determined the
car was worth. Missouri law allows for split decisions in
civil cases.</p>
<p>A Chrysler spokesman said yesterday the company plans to
appeal. "There's no basis in law or fact for the award," the
spokesman said.</p>
<p>Still, the verdict comes at an awkward time for Chrysler.
The company is in the middle of an aggressive marketing blitz
titled "Advantage: Chrysler." Led by Mr. Iacocca, the
campaign is aimed at persuading consumers that Chrysler's
cars are better than those made by Honda Motor Co. of Japan,
one of the industry's quality leaders.</p>
<p>The Missouri case revives an issue that Mr. Iacocca had
successfully blunted three years ago: Chrysler's practice of
selling thousands of cars and trucks as brand new, even
though they had been driven as many as 400 miles by factory
officials who had disconnected the vehicles' odometers.
Federal officials charged in June 1987 that the company sold
as new 60,000 such vehicles, including about 40 that had been
involved in wrecks.</p>
<p>In July 1987, Mr. Iacocca acknowledged that disconnecting
odometers to conduct test drives "went beyond dumb and
reached all the way out to stupid." Chrysler discontinued the
test-drive program. Mr. Iacocca offered to extend the
warranties on all the vehicles involved, and to replace those
that had been damaged.</p>
<p>Most of the affected buyers took the settlements, but the
Maughs didn't. Nor did they accept the $60,000 Chrysler
offered before the trial to settle the case, according to
their lawyer, John F. Burns.</p>
<p>Instead, the Maughs filed suit in 1987. At the trial, Mr.
Burns summoned experts who testified that the Maugh's New
Yorker had suffered serious damage to its frame.</p>
<p>The Chrysler spokesman said yesterday the company's
position is that the Maugh's car suffered no structural
damage. The only damage was to "bolt-on parts," such as the
grille, left front fender and bumper, the spokesman said.</p>
<p>"The jury didn't buy the argument," said Mr. Burns. "And
they probably won't buy Chryslers."</p>
