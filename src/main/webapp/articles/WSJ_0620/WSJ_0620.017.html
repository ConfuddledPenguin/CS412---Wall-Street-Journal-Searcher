	<p class="article-leader">MOSCOW -- The Soviet power structure may still flinch from
adopting a market economy, but large numbers of would-be
Soviet entrepreneurs are ready to become capitalists now. An
American journalist traveling in the Soviet Union sees this
eagerness demonstrated in a number of ways, from the truly
wacky to the impressive.
   In the midst of a sit-down television interview, an
uninvited man quietly pulls up a chair. He places some
photographs and a can of honey on the table. The color photos
depict arctic scenes. It becomes apparent that he is offering
my television station exclusive rights to put its logo on the
back of a man hiking alone to the North Pole. The hiker will
live on honey and ginseng, which the entrepreneur is also
selling. "Americans need to know this is complete food," he
says of the honey.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Minutes later another fellow approaches with an idea to
form a joint venture selling a musical regimen for
convalescing people. The regimen, he says, produces
"therapeutic psychological effects." A husband and wife team
pop up. They want to form a joint venture with Americans to
deliver holistic health care to the U.S. A Ukrainian is
looking for partners to send a group of 20 musicians,
spiritual consultants and witches to North America on a
healing mission.</p>
<p>While these people are frantically searching for ways to
turn a profit as Soviet society opens up, one man already
has. Artyem Tarasov lords over a burgeoning empire from the
basement of a Moscow tenement (even the successful have
difficulty finding office space in Moscow). By many accounts,
he is the nation's first millionaire entrepreneur. He is
certainly the first to make an issue of his wealth.</p>
<p>To a government that says it wants a market economy but
does not know how to achieve it, the 39-year-old
chain-smoking Armenian has persistently been saying "make up
your mind."</p>
<p>Mr. Tarasov's cooperative, Technika, generated his first
fortune, and forced the issue with the power structure.
Technika imported desktop computers, an item still in
critically short supply in the Soviet Union. The firm was
very successful. In January 1989, Mr. Tarasov and his two
partners decided to pay themselves salaries of three million
rubles each (between $200,000 and $1.5 million in the
uncertain realm of dollar-to-ruble exchange rates). Salaries
for members of cooperatives are theoretically unregulated,
but no cooperative had ever admitted making so much money, or
paid its executives so generously. The government's reaction
was swift: It froze Technika's bank accounts and voided some
of its contracts, virtually halting business at the firm.
After the freeze, Mr. Tarasov played the gambit one step
further. He took the government to court. This would have
been a tricky move even in the West. But Mikhail Gorbachev
has been exhorting the Soviet legal system toward
responsibility and Technika took him at his word.</p>
<p>The company won its lawsuit, gaining the return of its
frozen bank accounts and 50 million rubles in punitive
damages, according to Mr. Tarasov. But his victory remains
incomplete. The government hasn't paid the award yet, and he
forces a wry smile when asked whether it is probable that he
will receive it at all. He still can't pay his employees what
he'd like, either, so he compensates them in perks. His
company owns 32 Mercedes-Benz cars, which may make it the
best-equipped motorpool in the Soviet capital after the West
German embassy. As added compensation, he sends his employees
abroad for business meetings whenever possible.</p>
<p>Since Mr. Tarasov's fight with the government, the
workforce at Technika has withered from 400 employees down to
20. But he says he and his colleagues have started two new
firms, Vita, which specializes in the import and retail sale
of pharmaceuticals and Micrograf, a British-Soviet joint
venture that will make equipment for microcircuit
manufacturers.</p>
<p>Mr. Tarasov maintains that private enterprises are in fact
flourishing in the Soviet Union but that they are simply
masked under the label of cooperatives. He is a vice
president of the union of cooperatives in the Soviet Union.
Gross income from cooperatives more than doubled last year,
he claims, to 41 billion rubles at the beginning of this year
from 17 billion rubles at the beginning of 1989. He counts
260,000 cooperatives in the nation, employing 4.5 million
people, still less than 10% of the work force, but growing
rapidly. In spite of the growth, and the unabashed desire of
many Soviets to increase their incomes, there is still a
great deal of opposition to privately run enterprises.</p>
<p>Communist theory teaches that the fruits of society should
be equally distributed to all. According to that mindset,
anybody who was rich, almost by definition, was a criminal.
"The poorer you were," Mr. Tarasov says, "the more honest you
were."</p>
<p>Despite hostile public opinion, Mr. Tarasov has met with
Prime Minister Nikolai Rhyzkov to discuss the future of
cooperatives, and he has noticed movement toward capitalism
by some Soviet officials as their futures in the public
sector become less certain. "Many chiefs, many members of our
government, try to make for themselves special places in the
private sector, so if something happens they have these
places," he observes. "That's why they try to open joint
ventures and cooperatives, but deny that they are connected
with them." He cites the example of a Moscow public official
whose position is likely to be dissolved, who helped to set
up the Canadian/Soviet McDonald's restaurant in Red Square.</p>
<p>His own sights are on bigger targets. Because of a lack of
capital, Soviet private enterprises have historically been
concentrated in the service industries. But Mr. Tarasov's
companies have a $6 million cash hoard in hard currency. So
one of Mr. Tarasov's firms is readying plans for a
construction materials factory in Armenia.</p>
<p>It is hard to predict where Mr. Tarasov's companies will
be five years from now, and he knows the government could
erase what he's gained at any time. As he cruises the streets
of Moscow in a Mercedes 500 SEL, an Afghan war veteran
travels with him as a bodyguard, ready to fend off the Moscow
underworld and the aggressively jealous alike. Still, to the
Westerner, his future looks bright. Vita will soon open a
hard currency drug store in Moscow, to sell, among other
revolutionary new products, Bayer aspirin.</p>
