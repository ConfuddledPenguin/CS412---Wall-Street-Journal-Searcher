	<p class="article-leader">Mercedes-Benz AG, Stuttgart, said sales of cars and trucks
grew firmly in the first five months of 1990, with world-wide
group sales increasing 10% from a year earlier to 24 billion
marks ($14.32 billion).
   But officials of the vehicle manufacturing arm of West
Germany's largest industrial group, Daimler-Benz AG, were
guarded about prospects for 1990 earnings growth.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Mercedes Chairman Werner Niefer projected an increase in
group sales to 58 billion marks from 56.37 billion marks in
1989. Mercedes accounts for nearly three-quarters of
Daimler's global sales.</p>
<p>In Europe, excluding West Germany, Mercedes boosted unit
sales 3% in the five months to an unspecified level, Mr.
Niefer said. In West Germany, unit sales rose slightly to
105,000 cars.</p>
<p>The official said Mercedes-Benz sales in Japan were up 60%
from a year earlier, making the company Japan's largest
importer of foreign cars. Unit sales of cars in the U.S.
gained 5% in the five months. World-wide, the company sold
240,000 cars.</p>
