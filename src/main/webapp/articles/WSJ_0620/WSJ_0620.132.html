	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- An agreement under which FlightSafety
International Inc. was to acquire certain assets of Bicoastal
Corp.'s SimuFlite division was terminated, the companies
said.
   In April, FlightSafety agreed to pay about $64 million for
the assets and to assume about $19 million in long-term debt.
Both FlightSafety and SimuFlite have interests in pilot
training.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>FlightSafety Chairman Albert L. Ueltschi declined to say
why the plan was ended. Bicoastal, Tampa, Fla., couldn't be
reached for comment.</p>
<p>Bicoastal, formerly Singer Co., has been shedding various
assets of what had been a defense-electronics company.</p>
