	<p class="article-leader">VANCOUVER, British Columbia -- Corona Corp.'s plan to
secure control of Canada's hottest gold prospect -- the big
Eskay Creek gold deposit in northwestern British Columbia --
has hit a couple of major roadblocks.
   Placer Dome Inc., a big, cash-rich gold producer that is
competing with Corona to acquire Stikine Resources Ltd.,
half-owner of the Eskay Creek deposit, is expected today to
announce that about 40% of Stikine's 3,330,000 shares were
tendered under Placer Dome's offer, which expired yesterday.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>A spokesman for Placer Dome said final results of its
225.1 million Canadian dollar (US$191.7 million) or
C$67.50-a-share tender offer for Stikine won't be released
until this morning. But insiders familiar with the bid said
Placer Dome is expected to wind up with about 40% of the
company.</p>
<p>As a result, Placer Dome will be in a position to thwart a
previously proposed plan under which Corona hoped to secure
control of Stikine through a stock swap and then merge
Stikine and Stikine's Eskay Creek partner, Prime Resources
Group Inc., with a newly created unit, Corona Gold Corp. The
plan requires approval by 75% of Stikine's holders.</p>
<p>Separately, Corona confirmed that a proposed private
transaction under which it planned to immediately raise its
stake in Prime to 45% from 20% didn't close as scheduled
Friday. Corona's spokesman said the proposed purchase of 10.2
million Prime shares for an equal number of Corona Class A
shares from a group including Prime Chairman Murray Pezim,
associate Arthur Clemiss and Vancouver financier Jim Pattison
is only awaiting regulatory clearance.</p>
<p>But Mr. Pezim disagreed, citing dissatisfaction with the
terms of the transaction, partly over the decline in Corona's
share price.</p>
