	<p class="article-leader">MOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif. -- Sun Microsystems Inc. said it
signed an agreement with FPS Computing to market the
companies' workstations and computers jointly. Under terms of
the accord, Sun could, for example, bundle an array of its
scientific workstations and file servers, or terminals linked
on a computer network, with a recently introduced FPS
supercomputer, Sun said.
   The companies didn't disclose projected sales. Sun said
combined Sun-FPS systems would have applications in the oil
exploration, engineering design, computational chemistry and
signal processing industries. FPS is based in Portland, Ore.</p>
