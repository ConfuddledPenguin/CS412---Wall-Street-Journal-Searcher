	<p class="article-leader">Donald Trump's bankers said they made no progress in
bailout talks, as attention shifted to dozens of Japanese
financial institutions that are still unwilling to help the
beleaguered developer and casino owner.
   These Japanese-based creditors own pieces of $2 billion in
bank loans from Chase Manhattan Corp. and Citicorp, and must
approve a loan package that would provide Mr. Trump with what
bankers now say is $65 million. The proposal would also
suspend Mr. Trump's interest payments on all bank loans
indefinitely. In return, Mr. Trump would cede equity in many
projects to his creditors.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>On Friday, Mr. Trump failed to make a $43 million payment
on Trump's Castle bonds, and he has until midnight Tuesday to
cure the default or he could lose the property. Failure to
make the payment could also trigger defaults in other Trump
properties. But the developer's bankers said that, as a
practical matter, they must agree by tomorrow, to have a
reasonable chance of getting all the necessary paperwork done
in time.</p>
<p>On Monday, three New Jersey banks tentatively agreed to
join the arrangement agreed to earlier by four New York
banks. That pact means that about 65 smaller creditors who
purchased pieces of loans by Chase Manhattan and Citicorp
must still approve the deal.</p>
<p>These banks and leasing companies, most of which are
Japanese, have so far been unwilling to go along with the
deal. Some of the banks are unwilling to give up their
security in such relatively secured Trump projects as the
Trump Tower in Manhattan.</p>
<p>Other banks are said not to have had the time to consider
the package.</p>
<p>Under the proposed $65 million bailout, contributions from
the various Trump creditors breaks down as follows, according
to one individual involved in the discussions: units of
Bankers Trust New York Corp., $18.25 million; Citicorp,
$18.25 million; Chase Manhattan, $9 million; Manufacturers
Hanover Corp., $7 million; First Fidelity Bancorp, $5.5
million; National Westminster Bank, $5 million; and Midlantic
National Bank, $2 million.</p>
<p>While the seven banks are putting up the $65 million, some
of the other participant banks may also make contributions.
In return, these small creditors' loans would be secured by
some of Mr. Trump's stronger properties.</p>
<p>Mr. Trump has been in round-the-clock negotiations with
his banks for the past three weeks, following revelations
that he could not meet interest payments on $2 billion in
debt in the coming year. The banks say they have decided to
dismantle the Trump empire in an orderly fashion that would
avoid fire-sale prices.</p>
<p>Because Mr. Trump's loans have so many different types of
collateral and involve such a large number of banks, putting
a deal together has been difficult. The goal of the banks,
say people involved in the negotiations, is to keep Mr. Trump
out of bankruptcy court, where the disposition of his assets
would be supervised by a judge.</p>
<p>Mr. Trump has been meeting some obligations. The Trump
Shuttle made its regularly scheduled monthly payment of about
$1 million to Citicorp, according to a Trump official.</p>
