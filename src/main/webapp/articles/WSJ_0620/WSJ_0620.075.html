	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Two top executives at Reader's Digest
Association Inc. recently sold large chunks of their holdings
in the Pleasantville, N.Y., publishing company, according to
filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
   Richard F. McLoughlin, the company's president, sold 81%
of his stock last month, receiving $4.1 million for the
175,000 shares he sold, according to the filings.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Kenneth O. Gilmore, editor in chief of Reader's Digest
magazine and a company director, sold 72,000 Class A common
shares for about $1.9 million, representing 45% of his
holdings, according to the filings.</p>
<p>Both men declined to comment. But Bruce Trachtenberg, a
spokesman for the company, said Mr. McLoughlin's sale was
related to the president's approaching retirement June 30.
According to SEC filings, Mr. McLoughlin retains 40,160 Class
A common shares and 60 shares of the company's preferred
stock.</p>
<p>The company went public Feb. 15 in an offering priced at
$20 a share. At the time, the stock that the two officials
had accumulated were converted to public shares.</p>
<p>Mr. McLoughlin sold his shares May 15 at an average price
of $23.64 a share, while Mr. Gilmore's shares, sold on May
31, fetched an average of $26.13 a share. In New York Stock
Exchange composite trading, Reader's Digest stock closed at
$25.375, down 25 cents.</p>

<p>BLOCK SELLERS: In several sales in late April and May,
four insiders at Blockbuster Entertainment Corp., a large
video-rental chain, sold a total of 289,200 shares, SEC
filings show.</p>
<p>The bulk of the shares were sold by Vice President Jeffrey
Shearer. He sold 275,000 shares in several sales in late May
and has 350,081 shares remaining, according to the filings.
Mr. Shearer couldn't be reached for comment, but a company
spokesman for the Fort Lauderdale, Fla.-based company said
Mr. Shearer sold most of the shares "pursuant to a divorce
settlement."</p>
<p>Thomas Gruber, senior vice president and chief marketing
officer, sold 10,000 shares on May 25, and has 143,332 shares
remaining, SEC filings show. He said he sold for the "purpose
of paying taxes." The two other insiders, also vice
presidents, sold 1,948 and 2,252 shares each, representing
100% and 31% of their holdings, respectively, according to
the filings.</p>
<p>The insiders sold their shares at an average price of
$22.43 a share. In New York Stock Exchange composite trading,
Blockbuster shares closed up 37.5 cents at $23.375.</p>

<p>STOCK COMPACTING: Six vice presidents at Compaq Computer
Corp. sold a total of $3.7 million of its stock in May, SEC
filings show.</p>
<p>The two largest sales at the Houston-based company were by
Vice President James M. Eckhart, who sold 10,000 common
shares on May 7, and now holds 1,256 shares, and by Ross
Cooley, also a vice president. Mr. Cooley sold 8,964 common
shares on May 29 and now holds 1,035 shares, according to SEC
filings. Both executives declined to comment.</p>
<p>The other four insiders sold between 1,500 and 5,000
shares, SEC filings show, representing between 1% and 39% of
their holdings.</p>
<p>Bob Beach, a spokesman for Compaq, said all the insiders
sold for personal reasons and added that the company has only
four 30-day periods a year during which insiders can sell
shares.</p>
<p>The insiders sold at share prices ranging from $104.79 to
$120. The stock has since inched up. In composite trading on
the New York Stock Exchange yesterday, Compaq shares closed
at $124.50, up 87.5 cents.</p>
