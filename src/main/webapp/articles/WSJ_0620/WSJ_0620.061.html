	<p class="article-leader">Last week the Archbishop of New York, Cardinal John
O'Connor, published a long article in the archdiocesan
newspaper, at one point noting that politicians who
persistently support abortion rights "must be warned that
they are at risk of excommunication." This is a penalty that
does not prevent individuals from considering themselves
Catholic, but it does exclude them from some sacraments,
notably Holy Communion. (The sacrament of confession is
always available to an excommunicated Catholic.)
   Cardinal O'Connor's warning might have been thought merely
routine -- as it would be if the president of a private club
had warned members delinquent on their dues that their
privileges were in jeopardy. But a media ministorm ensued.
New York Gov. Mario Cuomo, who both supports abortion and
parades his Catholicism, and therefore may risk
excommunication under Cardinal O'Connor's interpretation of
church rules, called an impromptu news conference. "It is
upsetting," he said. "I don't like to hear it. How could you?
This is something very fundamental to our family."</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The New York Post splashed Cardinal O'Connor's warning on
its front page and assigned half a dozen reporters to the
story. A Post columnist compared Cardinal O'Connor to the
Ayatollah Khomeini and politicians threatened by his
"inquisition" were compared to the author-in-hiding, Salman
Rushdie. A New York Times editorial asserted that Cardinal
O'Connor's "uncompromising stance punishes Catholics in
public life," and complained that, whereas government can
impose no religious test for public office, "the Cardinal
imposes a religious test of his own."</p>
<p>By Sunday, at a St. Patrick's Cathedral press conference,
Cardinal O'Connor seemed to be back in the defensive crouch
now expected of church leaders bold enough to give public
emphasis to traditional Catholic teachings. "I have never
threatened to excommunicate anybody," he said, and on the
following day the New York Times had him safely tucked away
on an inside page: "O'Connor Denies Plan to Excommunicate
Anyone."</p>
<p>To ram the point home (just in case there were
recalcitrant dogmatists still at large) NBC's Today program
gave us an early morning civics lesson on Monday. When John
F. Kennedy became president, correspondent Katherine Couric
reminded us, there were widespread concerns that he might
take orders from Rome. Such church-state worries "persist"
today, Ms. Gouric said, with Cardinal O'Connor's "bold
attempt to discipline politicians."</p>
<p>Then Mr. Cuomo was on the screen -- in theological
disagreement with the cardinal (but more in sorrow than in
anger). "I wouldn't do it {support abortion}," he said, "if I
thought I was risking my soul." (Indeed, if the governor
knows better than the cardinal on this score, what need do we
have of cardinals?) There followed the usual supporting cast
of dissenters. The Rev. Andrew Greeley in priestly collar was
duly concerned. "This is a dialoguing society," he said.
Frances Kissling, representing Catholics for a Free Choice,
thought the cardinal guilty of "an act of desperation."</p>
<p>Clearly there was an important principle lurking here, but
no one came right out and said it. What is at stake is the
Catholic Church's right to discipline its flock -- to apply
its own rules to its members. Formally, this right is not
questioned (although once again we have heard some
crowd-pleasing dissent, notably from the Rev. Richard McBrien
of Notre Dame's theology department). But issues of canon law
and constitutional law barely describe the real world that
Cardinal O'Connor finds himself in -- a world in which a
partial press armed with cameras and spotlights can generate
unanticipated public pressure.</p>
<p>Cardinal O'Connor has been served notice, informally, that
the church membership claims of Catholic politicians who
adopt positions in line with the secular culture should not
be questioned publicly by Catholic Church leaders. Rep.
Charles Rangel of New York characterized such
question-raising as "intemperate, mean-spirited, and in
contempt of Christian and Catholic belief." In particular,
Cardinal O'Connor has been warned that if he excommunicates
politicians without fear or favor, the "church-state" issue
will be raised against him and life will get hot under the
media spotlight.</p>
<p>Excommunication is not always thought so dangerous. In
1962, when the Archbishop of New Orleans excommunicated a
local segregationist leader, Leander Perez, the New York
Times editorialized: "We salute the Catholic Archbishop. He
has set an example founded on religious principle, and
responsive to the social conscience of our time." Men "of all
faiths must admire" his "unwavering courage." If Cardinal
O'Connor today threatened to excommunicate church members for
racism, he could be sure that no church-state issues would be
raised.</p>
<p>The pretense that Cardinal O'Connor is imposing a
"religious test" in defiance of the Constitution is absurd.
The constitution says that there shall be no religious test
for public office; not that there shall be no religious test
for religions. It is Mr. Cuomo, not Cardinal O'Connor, who is
the public official armed with the law. Mr. Cuomo manages to
pull off the amazing trick of posing as Thomas More while
being in the position of Henry VIII.</p>
<p>In one respect church-state issues are real enough. At
about the same time that Cardinal O'Connor was being hauled
before the cameras, Mr. Rangel, a senior member of the Ways
and Means Committee, was reported to have threatened to
question the church's tax-exempt status at his committee. He
was irritated because he had been invited to and then
(because of his pro-abortion position) disinvited from a
Catholic high school graduation. If, as a result of such
pressure, the church shrinks from applying its own rules to
politicians, there is a real and dangerous encroachment upon
the church by the state.</p>
<p>Cardinal O'Connor (and anyone rash enough to follow in his
footsteps) is under extra-legal media and political pressure
to turn a blind eye when church members expediently align
themselves with the secular culture. The Catholic Church may
be a private institution, some politicians and their media
allies are obliquely saying, but it's too important an
institution to be left solely in the hands of clergymen. The
church should, therefore, uncomplainingly permit itself to be
colonized by internal dissenters.</p>
<p>Why are liberal politicians such as Mr. Cuomo so eager to
claim membership in an organization whose rules they disagree
with, especially when, as we are given to suppose (and as may
well be the case), these rules are unpopular with the voters?
One answer is that the politicians probably don't think of
these rules as being made by God. They think of them as man
made. And men are amenable to political pressure. The rules
can, therefore be changed -- brought into line with
contemporary liberal opinion.</p>
<p>Mr. Cuomo and his supporters have some reason for thinking
along these lines. If church law is God's law, and if
abortion-supporting politicians deserve excommunication now,
they have deserved it all along. But for 17 years U.S.
bishops have said little to encourage this line of thought.
This protracted episcopal silence has permitted Cardinal
O'Connor's opponents to construe his recent remarks as
arbitrary. If the rule had been enforced all along, maybe the
church would be a smaller institution today, but it would
also be a more self-assured one.</p>
