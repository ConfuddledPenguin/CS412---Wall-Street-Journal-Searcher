	<p class="article-leader">SIMSBURY, Conn. -- Kollmorgen Corp. said the final report
of the balloting in a proxy fight for control of the board
confirmed that the maker of motors and electro-optical
systems beat back a challenge by Vernitron Corp.
   But closely held Vernitron, a Deer Park, N.Y., maker of
motors and controls that has been pursuing Kollmorgen for
some 18 months, disputed the final report of the inspectors
of the election.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Vernitron said it "presented a number of significant
challenges to votes affecting hundreds of thousands of
shares." Vernitron "believes the inspectors {of the election}
erred in ruling with Kollmorgen management on these
challenges and is considering" taking legal action.</p>
<p>Late in May, Kollmorgen said preliminary numbers indicated
that it won the proxy fight. Vernitron said then and
reiterated that its slate of directors won a plurality of the
shares voted at the meeting if the 3.1 million shares
Kollmorgen sold to an investor group in March are excluded
from the total. Vernitron has claimed that Kollmorgen sold
the 3.1 million shares to the investor group as a defensive
measure against Vernitron.</p>
<p>Separately, the New York money manager Mario Gabelli
disclosed in a Securities and Exchange Commission filing in
Washington that a company he controls boosted its stake in
Kollmorgen to 19.99% from 17.79%. The group to which
Kollmorgen sold the 3.1 million shares, which includes
Tinicum Enterprises Inc. of Garden City, N.Y., recently
boosted its Kollmorgen holdings to 19.5%.</p>
<p>In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday,
Kollmorgen shares closed unchanged at $11.50.</p>
