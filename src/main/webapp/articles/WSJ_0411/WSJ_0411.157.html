	<p class="article-leader">MESA LIMITED PARTNERSHIP (Amarillo, Texas) -- Moody's
Investors Service Inc. said it cut the debt ratings of Mesa
Limited Partnership to B-2 from Ba-3 because the company
withdrew a plan to raise as much as $400 million by selling
interests in one of its prime properties. The rating concern
said the move affects about $600 million in debt from Mesa,
an oil and gas concern controlled by investor T. Boone
Pickens Jr., and its Mesa Capital Corp. unit. Mesa had
planned to use proceeds from the sale to reduce its $1.52
billion in debt. Without the offering of units of a new
Hugoton Royalty Trust, Moody's said that it believes Mesa
will be under pressure to generate enough cash flow to meet
its required payments, including its preferred stock
distributions. The rating concern said that Mesa needs either
to sell assets to reduce its debt or to enjoy a "sustained
rise" in natural gas prices to improve its financial
position. In February, Standard & Poor's Corp. also cut
Mesa's debt rating, to single-B-plus from double-B-plus. Mesa
said last week that it withdrew the proposed offering because
it didn't look as if it would attract the price it had hoped
for. In addition, the company said that its offering document
was delayed by the Securities and Exchange Commission,
postponing the proposed offering from the strongest part of
the natural gas season to the weakest. A spokesman, however,
said that the bankruptcy of Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.,
which Mesa initially chose as its underwriter, didn't delay
the offering and that Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. was ready
to step in and handle the transaction. The Mesa spokesman
said the rating services' moves were expected, but said the
company "made the right moves from an economic standpoint."</p>
