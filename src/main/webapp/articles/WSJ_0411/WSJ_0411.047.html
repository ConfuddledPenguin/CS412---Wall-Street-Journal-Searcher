	<p class="article-leader">HOUSTON -- Baker Hughes Inc. and Norton Co. said they
entered into a consent decree with the Justice Department
that will allow Baker to complete the acquisition of Norton's
Eastman Christensen unit, probably within a few days.
   The consent decree essentially is meant to head off
antitrust questions.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Baker, an oil-field service company, agreed in December to
buy Eastman, a maker of diamond drilling bits and other
drilling equipment, for an indicated value of $600 million.</p>
<p>As part of the consent order, Baker will be required to
dispose of the diamond drill bit business of its Hughes Tool
Co. unit by Aug. 6. If it isn't sold by then, that business
will be placed in the hands of a trustee for disposition. The
Justice Department had maintained that Baker and Norton were
competitors in the diamond drill business.</p>
<p>In Washington, the Justice Department's antitrust chief,
James Rill, said that as originally proposed the acquisition
would prove "anticompetitive" in the U.S. market for each of
three types of diamond drill bits. "The divestiture will
ensure that the merger . . . will not raise the cost of
drilling for oil and gas in the U.S.," Mr. Rill said.</p>
<p>The transaction calls for Baker to pay $550 million in
cash, assume $8 million in debt and issue warrants to Norton
for as many as eight million Baker shares at $36.75 each.
Norton said it intends to use proceeds to buy back as much as
15% of its common shares, pursue acquisitions and repay debt.
Norton makes abrasives, ceramics, plastics and
chemical-process products.</p>
