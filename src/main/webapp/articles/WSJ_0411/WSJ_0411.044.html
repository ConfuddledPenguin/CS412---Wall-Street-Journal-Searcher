	<p class="article-leader">New York -- The trouble with "Aspects of Love" begins in
the very first aria. In the first scene of the musical that
opened recently at the Broadhurst Theater, Alex (Michael
Ball) is standing on the terrace of a country home in
Southwest France. He faces a woman seated at a wooden trestle
table. When he begins to sing softly, it is clear that his
sotto voce rendition would not reach past the second row, but
it booms out over the loudspeaker system through the whole
house. We know right away that voices are going to be
amplified in this production; it turns out everything else is
amplified as well, including the overwrought emotions of the
characters.
   "Aspects of Love" is based on a 1955 novel by David
Garnett, a brief, unpretentious work marked by the subtlety
of the interconnected personal relationships. Composer Andrew
Lloyd Webber must have felt it was the ideal vehicle for him
to move headlong into the adult world.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Until now, Mr. Lloyd Webber has written frequently about
the fantasy world of children in such musicals as "Cats" and
"Starlight Express." Not only that, he has named the many
corporate entities he controls after escapist characters or
concepts from that same world. His best known company -- and
the producer of all his recent musicals, including "Aspects
of Love" -- is the Really Useful Company, named for a train
engine in a children's book.</p>
<p>In contrast, the novel "Aspects of Love" deals with a
grown-up, sophisticated world of liaisons and affairs. The
story begins in Montpellier in the south of France, where
Alex, a young man, becomes infatuated with an actress, Rose
Vibert (Ann Crumb), who suddenly is out of work for two
weeks. He persuades her to come to Pau in the Pyrenees. His
wealthy uncle has an estate there that he never visits, where
they can live free of charge. Alex's Uncle George (Kevin
Colson), alerted by the caretaker of the estate, unexpectedly
shows up to confront the couple, and soon thereafter Rose
leaves to rejoin her theatrical troupe. Two years pass in
which Alex, now in the army, has been away. He returns to
Paris and on a visit to his uncle discovers that Rose is now
living with Uncle George as his mistress. Insane with
jealousy, Alex pulls out a gun and in the ensuing argument
with Rose, the gun goes off and he grazes her arm with a
bullet.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, George is attracted to Giulietta (Kathleen Rowe
McAllen), an Italian sculptress. Despite this attachment, he
marries Rose, and we move 13 years ahead to the time when
they have an attractive daughter of 12 and Alex enters their
lives once more. Over the next two years Alex develops a
deep, though platonic relationship, with the daughter, Jenny
(Danielle Du Clos), and she falls childishly but passionately
in love with him. George dies and Alex realizes that he must
end the relationship with Jenny; as the story ends, he has
turned from Jenny and begun an affair with Giulietta.</p>
<p>Whereas in the Garnett novel these relationships are a
tissue of nuances, told with sensitivity and psychological
insight, in the musical everything is overblown. The scenery
was created by Maria Bjornson, who designed "The Phantom of
the Opera." For the more intimate "Aspects of Love" she has
fashioned large-scale effects out of all proportion to the
story. Two brief scenes -- at a sculpture exhibit in Paris
and in Giulietta's studio in Venice -- become full-stage
settings filled with elaborate, outsize objects: an
old-fashioned phonograph with a woman's legs protruding from
the horn, human heads broken into planes like geological
faults. The main background of the set is the brick wall for
George's villa. At one point, when Alex and Rose are hiking,
the wall breaks apart like a giant cracked egg to show a
panorama of the Pyrenees.</p>
<p>As with the scenery, the emotional entanglements are
inflated. A one-line reference in the novel to an attraction
between Rose and Giulietta leads to a full-blown lesbian
attachment in the musical. In fact, the moment any two likely
lovers set eyes on each other, the music swells and we know
that "amour" is in the air. So quickly do liaisons develop
and dissolve that the musical often seems like a synopsis of
the story rather than the unfolding of a plot. At times, this
leads to unintentional comedy. The scene, for example, in
which Alex attempts to shoot Rose, abruptly turns from
melodrama to high farce. After the shooting, the maid comes
rushing in with a hammer and strikes at Alex, and though the
blow stops a good six inches from his head, he collapses in a
heap.</p>
<p>Once George returns and order is restored, the two men in
Rose's life, each of whom has insisted he could not live
without her, suddenly begs the other to take her off his
hands in the duet "She'd Be Better Off With You." The music
follows the same pattern as the other elements in "Aspects of
Love." In the manner of recent British musicals, there is
scoring from beginning to end, so that even mundane phrases
such as "Would you like a cup of coffee?" "No thank you, I
prefer tea" are sung, sometimes with a decidedly droll
effect. The lyrics, by the way, are by Don Black and Charles
Hart.</p>
<p>When we turn from recitatives to arias, each one without
fail builds to a mighty crescendo at the conclusion, whether
the underlying emotion justifies it or not. Also, because he
does not appear fully to trust individual declarations, Mr.
Lloyd Webber several times introduces a full chorus -- at
George's vineyard and at his funeral. The cast, it should be
noted, handles the music well enough, but meets with varying
degrees of success in conveying any depth of character.</p>
<p>How do we explain why Mr. Lloyd Webber and his director,
Trevor Nunn, have treated the delicate fabric of "Aspects of
Love" in such grandiose fashion? Any answer obviously would
be speculation, but one possibility is that both men have met
with such success when pulling out all the stops -- Mr. Nunn,
after all, has guided such blockbuster musicals as "Cats" and
"Les Miserables" -- that they have difficulty scaling back
when they come to a far more intimate, personal subject. One
of the big numbers in "Aspects of Love" is "Love Changes
Everything." Well, yes, but when it comes to show business,
apparently not for Messrs. Lloyd Webber and Nunn.</p>
