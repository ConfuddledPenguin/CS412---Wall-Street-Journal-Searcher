	<p class="article-leader">CHICAGO -- UAL Corp. said it signed a definitive merger
agreement with United Employee Acquisition Corp., the company
formed by its three principal employee unions to acquire UAL.
   Under the proposed merger, shareholders will receive for
each UAL share $155 cash; $35 in senior subordinated notes of
United Airlines; and a new security valued at about $11 a
share, issued by Covia Corp., a UAL unit that owns United's
share in the Apollo computerized reservation system.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The United notes, which will have a 16% interest rate,
will be due in 1999. The agreement gives the unions four
months to secure financing for the $4.38 billion buy-out.</p>
