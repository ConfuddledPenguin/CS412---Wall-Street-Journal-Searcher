	<p class="article-leader">ZEELAND, Mich. -- Herman Miller Inc. said its president
and chief operating officer, Edward R. Simon Jr., is
resigning, effective June 1, and that another top official is
taking early retirement. No successor was named for either
man.
   Mr. Simon's resignation came two years after the furniture
maker appointed Richard H. Ruch as its chief executive
officer, putting him above Mr. Simon, who has been president
since 1986.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>In a statement, Mr. Simon, 52 years old, said "the
direction of the corporation is best served by reducing
duplication and overlapping responsibilities in management. .
. . I recognize that my resignation will provide {Ruch} with
an opportunity for further alignment of the organization,
eliminate confusion and provide a clearer direction for the
company."</p>
<p>Mr. Simon wasn't available for comment and the company
didn't offer any further details beyond the statement other
than to say that its financial position is solid and neither
the resignation nor the early retirement was forced.</p>
<p>Herman Miller also said that David L. Armstrong, its
senior vice president for sales and marketing, is taking
early retirement but didn't specify when. Mr. Armstrong is 54
and has been with Herman Miller 11 years, the company said.</p>
<p>The effect of the two officers leaving is difficult to
assess. Mr. Simon worked for Herman Miller for some 20 years,
during which he helped establish an internal data processing
and information system for the company, led a financial
turnaround at a subsidiary, and helped set up a global
distribution network. Mr. Armstrong directed the introduction
of several new products and served as executive vice
president of Herman Miller Research Corp.</p>
<p>Herman Miller stock closed yesterday at $19 a share, down
25 cents in national over-the-counter trading.</p>
<p>In the 1970s and early 1980s, Herman Miller stock was a
highflier, riding the crest of a rapidly growing market for
office furniture. Then the market for office furniture
slowed, causing a "shock" in Herman Miller's earnings and
sales growth, said Wallace W. Epperson, an analyst with Wheat
First Securities in Richmond, Va.</p>
<p>For the third quarter ended March 3, Herman Miller earned
$11.5 million, or 47 cents a share, on sales of $200.7
million. In the year-earlier quarter, net income totaled
$10.9 million, or 45 cents a share, on sales of $192.6
million.</p>
