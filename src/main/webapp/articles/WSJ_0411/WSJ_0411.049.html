	<p class="article-leader">PITTSBURGH -- Shareholders of PNC Financial Corp. filed
two class-action lawsuits against the bank-holding company,
alleging that PNC concealed or misrepresented the likelihood
of huge increases in problem loans.
   The suits follow PNC's announcement Friday of an increase
in loan-loss provisions by between $70 million and $80
million for the first quarter. PNC said it made the move
because of federal regulators' tougher scrutiny of loan
portfolios and the continued softness in the commercial
real-estate market.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>PNC said the higher provisions will lower first-quarter
earnings as much as 40% from the year-earlier profit of
$123.6 million, or $1.32 a share.</p>
<p>In composite trading Friday on the New York Stock
Exchange, PNC fell $3.875 to $34, and for the week the stock
fell $5.625 amid mounting concerns over asset quality. PNC
closed yesterday at $35.25, up 50 cents.</p>
<p>PNC said yesterday that it would have no comment about the
suits until it had a chance to study them. The bank said such
suits aren't unexpected after a reported earnings decline.</p>
<p>The suits -- one filed in U.S. District Court in
Pittsburgh, the other in U.S. District Court in Philadelphia
-- both charge that PNC's chairman and chief executive
officer, Thomas H. O'Brien, overstated year-ago earnings by
failing to set appropriate loan-loss reserve levels.</p>
