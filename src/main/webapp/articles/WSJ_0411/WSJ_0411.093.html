	<p class="article-leader">TORONTO -- President Bush, slightly toughening his
rhetoric on the uprising in Lithuania, contended that "should
things deteriorate in Lithuania, it would be extraordinarily
difficult" for U.S.-Soviet relations to improve quickly.
   Mr. Bush's comments, made to reporters after he finished a
three-hour meeting with Canadian Prime Minister Brian
Mulroney, came a day after Soviet leaders said they would
step up pressure in Lithuania in an effort to quell the
problems. The president's statement came just a week after
the White House and Kremlin announced plans for a late May
summit meeting focusing on arms accords.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>But Mr. Bush appeared to rule out any chance that the
summit might be canceled because of the Lithuania uprising,
contending that "when you have complications, that's a good
time to talk."</p>
<p>In response to a question, the president also said there
is "no trilateral agreement being discussed" among the U.S.,
Canada and Mexico. Mr. Bush said he was pleased that Prime
Minister Mulroney had met recently with Mexican President
Carlos Salinas, and that he plans to meet with Mexican
officials soon as well.</p>
<p>Mr. Mulroney said he expects the U.S. and Canada to get
together this summer to work out an acid-rain accord. He said
the two sides are waiting for Congress to complete the Clear
Air Act, which includes measures on acid rain.</p>
