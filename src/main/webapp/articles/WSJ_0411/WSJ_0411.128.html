	<p class="article-leader">Two Republican administrations -- in Washington, D.C., and
California -- have now stared into the abyss of
government-mandated, employer-paid health insurance and
backed away. Their reluctance buys a bit more time to develop
a fundamentally different remedy for soaring premiums and
huge gaps in coverage.
   Already gathering dust is the majority report of the
Pepper Commission, set up by Congress to give bipartisan
legitimacy to mandatory health insurance and long-term care
entitlements. The ploy busted up when neither the panel's GOP
members nor Health Secretary Louis Sullivan wanted much to do
with this vehicle for a $66 billion tax increase.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Meanwhile, Governor George Deukmejian faced a deadline for
legislation his cabinet had prepared to deal with
California's particularly acute problem of escalating costs
and uninsured workers. His aides' plan had more than a dash
of Pepper: a mandate to employers to insure, tax breaks for
businesses that couldn't handle what would effectively be a
stiff new payroll levy, and greater public provision of
medical care for those who still wouldn't fit under this
bigger umbrella. Oh, and "cost containment," too.</p>
<p>The governor got an earful from small companies. The
Chamber of Commerce didn't like mandates, and was worried
that costs wouldn't in fact be contained once business was
locked in. Ultimately the governor wisely passed on the
scheme.</p>
<p>The current system is indeed a tangle, but the people
pushing reform the hardest so far haven't come up with
anything feasible.</p>
<p>Medical advancements have maintained and bettered life for
millions, but the status quo probably is not sustainable. Not
only are too many people priced out of the market, but in an
emergency, nobody wants to turn indigents away. They usually
are treated at hospitals, with the cost either borne by
taxpayers or shifted to the private sector via the insurance
system.</p>
<p>For reasons both humane and economic, change is in order.
To some extent, it can happen without legislative help. Small
employers are creatively grouping to buy policies. But many
states make this hard when they require that all health
policies cover a vast array of services. A few are now acting
to allow more flexibility. States also can doctor the
incentives somewhat. The Pioneer Institute in Boston,
surveying the metastasizing mess of mandated health insurance
in Massachusetts, devised a tax rebate keyed to an
individual's purchase of his own coverage. Pioneer believes
this would cost the state Treasury less than Michael
Dukakis's program is going to.</p>
<p>In the main, however, medical-care costs are one issue
properly addressed to Washington, where much of the trouble
started. The bills began to leap when the federal government
became the big third-party payer, greatly loosening the
disciplines of a normal marketplace.</p>
<p>Medicare, which did open medical doors to millions of
poorer Americans, isn't going to go away, so where do we
begin? For starters, someone has to straighten out the
incentives. One assumption worth building on is that if
individuals pay for the coverage they want, we're likely to
find out that, lo and behold, the marketplace still works in
health care as in just about everything else.</p>
<p>The National Center for Policy Analysis, a Dallas-based
outfit, has developed an intriguing model for how such a
changeover could occur. It suggests that income taxes apply
to all compensation, even that portion an employee (or his
union) designates should go toward employer-purchased health
coverage. Taxation of benefits is considered a political
nonstarter, though it might make sense if coupled with rate
reduction. Unions especially fight it because they are
dominated by older members who place a higher value on health
care than do younger ones, who might prefer to have the cash.
But the creative politician might cut through this objection
by offering instead a healthy tax credit for an individual's
medical costs.</p>
<p>It's important, if you aren't to encourage
overconsumption, to link a tax credit to a high deductible.
That way the tax code is cushioning extraordinary blows, but
not casual doctor visits.</p>
<p>This approach won't fully get government off the hook.
People under-insure themselves in times of good health, and
society's heart bleeds for the hard cases, even if it is
suffering born of folly. So there still will be
cost-shifting, though even now the annual uncompensated-care
bill may be running as low as $8 billion, out of a $550
billion medical-service industry. This means that while some
hospitals are pinched, the overall problem is manageable
without coverage mandates that also invite regulation of the
supply side.</p>
<p>A lot of people, including many patients, are benefiting
from the current system's excess (notably at the extremely
expensive late stages of fatal diseases). Still, better
health is one of the byproducts of a scientifically
sophisticated and prosperous free economy; that point cannot
be made often enough because the socialists among us keep
denying it. But a phony market system in medicine in which
costs and responsibility are shifted onto unwitting third
parties invites excess, just as was true with financial
institutions. As a result, the market gets blamed and an
engine of better living gets slowed with new restraints.</p>
<p>That is where we are now, and no new round of "cost
controls" will rescue health care. Nor will nationalization.
Business executives, pressed as they are by benefit costs,
seem to realize this. The vast majority of those recently
surveyed by Roper rejected a bigger role for the government.
The better answer is to turn back to a remedy that has proven
safe and effective: individual consumer choice.</p>
