	<p class="article-leader">The publishing group Hachette S.A. said its consolidated
profit after payments to minority interests rose 43% to 469
million French francs ($83.3 million) in 1989 from 328
million francs a year earlier.
   The Paris-based group noted, however, that nonrecurring
items accounted for a big portion of the gain, and said its
earnings excluding these elements would have been 331 million
francs, up 2.5% from 323 million francs in 1988. Hachette's
consolidated 1989 revenue was 29.06 billion francs, up 19%
from 24.41 billion francs in 1988.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The adjusted figures are in line with the group's previous
forecasts that financial costs associated with its
acquisition of the U.S. publishing groups Grolier Inc. and
Diamandis Communications Inc. would leave 1989 earnings
little changed from a year earlier.</p>
<p>Following the earnings improvement, Hachette said it plans
to boost its net annual dividend to 3.90 francs a share from
3.30 francs. Payment and record dates weren't specified.</p>
