	<p class="article-leader">GORBACHEV RAISED the possibility of imposing direct rule
over Lithuania.
   As the president of the breakaway Baltic republic blamed
"ultra-rightist" forces for Moscow's threat to use
unspecified political and economic measures against
Lithuania, the Soviet leader warned that he might impose
direct presidential rule in the event of "civilian conflict
or confrontation." Such a step could include martial law and
dissolving the republic's legislature. Gorbachev, who noted
that Lithuania's independence bid could be costly to
international peace, also said that the Kremlin was still
striving to find a political solution to the situation.</p>

deaths.</p>

<p>East German legislators haggled over unfilled cabinet

and in its reunification with West Germany.</p>

don't face such strains.</p>
