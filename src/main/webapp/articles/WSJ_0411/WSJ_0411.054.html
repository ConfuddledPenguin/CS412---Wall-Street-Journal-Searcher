	<p class="article-leader">The widespread problems in limited partnerships are
spawning a wave of investor litigation against troubled
syndicators and the Wall Street brokerage firms that sold
their products.
   Lawsuits and arbitration claims totaling more than $500
million have been filed against Chicago-based VMS Realty
Partners alone, attorneys familiar with the cases say.
Numerous other suits and arbitration complaints seeking
hundreds of millions of dollars have been filed against
partnership purveyors. And plaintiffs' lawyers say additional
litigation is almost certain.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The wrangling promises years of headaches for partnership
syndicators and brokers. But going to court or arbitration
over soured partnerships also means a lengthy, stressful and
often expensive battle for partnership investors.</p>
<p>More than $40 billion of private partnerships, which are
marketed mostly to wealthy individuals, were sold between
1978 and 1987, according to figures compiled by Robert A.
Stanger & Co., a Shrewsbury, N.J., research and consulting
firm. During the same 10 years, in the heyday of partnership
syndications, thousands of smaller investors poured more than
$70 billion into supposedly far-safer public offerings.</p>
<p>About half went into real estate, the rest to finance
partnerships in everything from oil drilling and equipment
leasing to cable television and movies. Now it's estimated
that at least one in five public partnerships is troubled,
most of them in real estate.</p>
<p>Many investors now charge that brokers used high-pressure
sales tactics to promote the illiquid ventures, which have
lives of seven to 12 years and were sold in units of as
little as $5,000. Others claim they were urged to buy even if
partnerships were clearly an unsuitable choice because of
their annual income or investment goals. Still other
investors say they never received a prospectus warning they
could lose all of their principal.</p>
<p>Most partnership sellers are reluctant to discuss these
disputes, or say they reject responsibility for any problems.
Many suits name Prudential-Bache Securities Inc., a unit of
Prudential Insurance Co. of America and a leading purveyor of
VMS partnerships. Loren Schechter, executive vice president
and counsel of Prudential-Bache, said the VMS partnerships
haven't succeeded because of the general decline in real
estate values. "It's not a result of any failing on our
part," he said. VMS officials couldn't be reached for
comment.</p>
<p>A few in the partnership business say some investors --
and lawyers -- are merely trying to cash in on
well-publicized problems. The negative publicity has been "a
signal for every Tom, Dick and Harry to jump on the
bandwagon," says Leonard Simmons, a Dean Witter Reynolds Inc.
broker who is a defendant in a pending case involving
partnerships he sold while at E.F. Hutton & Co. "You've got
law firms going around ringing the bells. If you don't call
that ambulance-chasing, I don't know what is."</p>
<p>Still, one top brokerage executive recently suggested that
the securities industry shares at least some of the blame for
the partnership debacle. While the problems have been
exacerbated by tax-law changes, "I don't think we adequately
controlled the quality of the partnerships we sold," Howard
L. Clark Jr., newly installed chairman of Shearson Lehman
Hutton Inc., told The Wall Street Journal. "Wall Street in
general has done a lousy job of selecting and selling limited
partnerships."</p>
<p>Shearson, the American Express Co. unit that acquired
Hutton's extensive partnership business, was the top purveyor
of these investments in 1988. Now it has all but quit selling
new partnerships, in part because of the lawsuits it faces.</p>
<p>Plaintiffs' lawyers and others predict the current wave of
suits will become a flood. "What other remedies are
available?" said Steven Brobeck, executive director of the
Washington-based Consumer Federation of America. "We see the
legal profession as one means of policing the small-investor
markets."</p>
<p>But one possible barrier is "insolvent defendants," said
plaintiffs' lawyer Michael J. Aguirre of San Diego.</p>
<p>Joseph Moorman, a 72-year-old retired jet aircraft
salesman, has been battling troubled Dallas syndicator
Southmark Corp. in court for more than two years over a
$12,000 real estate partnership investment he made in 1977.
The sponsor was Robert A. McNeil Corp., then a unit of
Southmark.</p>
<p>Three years ago, Southmark "rolled up" Mr. Moorman's
partnership and 34 others into National Realty L.P., a new
master limited partnership that is traded on the American
Stock Exchange. Its units closed in composite trading
yesterday at $4.875. That's a far cry from the conversion
value of $50 (adjusted for a 1-for-5 reverse split) Southmark
indicated they would have when it asked Mr. Moorman and
50,000 other limited partners to approve the roll-up.</p>
<p>Mr. Moorman is a representative plaintiff in a $200
million suit pending in a state court in Redwood City,
Calif., that seeks class-action status. He has had to turn
over piles of his own financial records to the defendants'
lawyers and give hours of depositions. Settlement discussions
have dragged on since last July. If they are eventually
successful, legal fees could eat up a third or more of any
settlement. But "I was convinced I didn't have a chance"
battling alone, Mr. Moorman said.</p>
<p>A spokeswoman for National Realty, one of several
defendants in the suit, says "limited partnerships aren't
exempt from the general trend of people asking judges to
satisfy their wishes and desires and salve their
disappointment." The other defendants, Southmark and Shearson
(E.F. Hutton was the roll-up's dealer-manager), decline to
comment.</p>
<p>Some lawyers, including Chicago attorney Herbert Beigel,
are courting partnership investors who, they say, don't
realize their chance to sue under many securities laws runs
out after a few years. "I've taken a lot of criticism from
the legal profession for that," he said, but none of his
clients has complained.</p>
<p>Often, investors must take their grievances to arbitration
instead of filing a lawsuit, because of brokerage agreements
they signed. While it still helps to have a lawyer, the
process is cheaper and faster than going to court. Most
disputes are resolved within a year and generally can't be
appealed.</p>
<p>Investors typically have a choice of arbitrators supplied
by the New York Stock Exchange, American Stock Exchange,
National Association of Securities Dealers or the New
York-based American Arbitration Association, the only source
outside the brokerage industry.</p>
<p>Those who pursue claims win "a little bit more than 50% of
the time," says Richard Ryder, editor and publisher of
Securities Arbitration Commentator newsletter. They usually
take home about 45% of their out-of-pocket losses, he adds,
although arbitrators can sometimes award much more than that
in punitive damages.</p>
<p>Such damages are more common in lawsuits. Moreover, if a
court certifies a suit as a class action, all investors who
are members of the class by virtue of a common grievance
automatically share in any settlement.</p>
<p>Judges are increasingly awarding investors who are willing
to shoulder the burden of representing other plaintiffs an
extra share, usually a token share, of settlements for the
stress involved.</p>
<p>Amonce Sullivan, a 64-year-old San Diego woman, is leading
5,000 other investors in a $17 million class action against
Shearson and more than a dozen other defendants over a
troubled 1987 hotel partnership. The suit, which alleges
fraud and negligence, among other things, is pending in a
state court in Los Angeles. Shearson declines to comment.</p>
<p>Mrs. Sullivan, who put $15,000 into the partnership, says
she had never taken any kind of legal action before. But she
fears her investment is "out the window," even though she
said her broker assured her that her money was as safe as it
would be in a bank certificate of deposit.</p>
<p>"He knew I was a widow on a fixed income," she said. "I'm
sure there are a lot of other people like myself. Maybe these
lawsuits will stop that kind of activity."</p>
