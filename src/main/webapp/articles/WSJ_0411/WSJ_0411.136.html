	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- A federal judge ordered Quantum Chemical Corp.
to pay damages totaling $24.3 million to Delta Holdings Inc.
for breach of contract and fraud.
   Delta sued in 1985 in connection with its purchase of
Elkhorn Insurance Co. from Quantum in September 1983. Delta,
a New Jersey holding company, paid Quantum $18 million for
the Elkhorn subsidiary, which was later renamed Delta America
Re Insurance Co.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>In federal court in Manhattan, Judge John Keenan said that
Elkhorn clearly was insolvent at the time of the purchase by
Delta, which is closely held. He said that Elkhorn's books
and records understated Elkhorn's liability for loss reserves
by a substantial amount and that the understatement of the
reserves wasn't disclosed to Delta.</p>
<p>The judge said that Delta had understandably relied on
false representations by Quantum about the subsidiary's
financial condition.</p>
<p>Judge Keenan ordered that the sale be rescinded. In
addition to returning the $18 million purchase price, Quantum
also must pay $6.3 million to cover the amount that Delta
ended up contributing to the insolvent subsidiary. Quantum,
based in New York, also was ordered to pay interest on the
damages.</p>
<p>Joseph Dailey, an attorney for Quantum, formerly known as
National Distillers & Chemical Corp., said it is likely that
his client will appeal the decision.</p>
