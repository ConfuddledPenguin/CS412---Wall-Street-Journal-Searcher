	<p class="article-leader">BOSTON -- Bank of New England Corp. said it signed a
definitive agreement to sell its asset-based lending
subsidiary, New England Commercial Finance Corp., to National
Bank of Canada.
   Included in the sale are about $665 million in assets,
which were sold at a premium, Bank of New England said. The
amount of the premium -- the difference between the sales
price and the assets' book value -- wasn't disclosed.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>National Bank said the assets represent loans to about 125
borrowers. It said that less than 5% of the assets included
are loans for leveraged transactions and that none are
real-estate loans.</p>
<p>The sale, expected to close by the end of April, is part
of Bank of New England's previously announced asset-sales
program. Proceeds of the sales are being used to reduce the
company's liquidity problems and to improve its capital
ratios.</p>
<p>National Bank of Canada, based in Montreal, has assets of
35.9 billion Canadian dollars (US$30.9 billion). Bank of New
England has assets of about $25 billion.</p>
