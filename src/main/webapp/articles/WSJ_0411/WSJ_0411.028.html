	<p class="article-leader">One of the worst things about being sick in America is
having to confront the hospital's bill. And unlike buyers of
other big-ticket items, most consumers cannot find out the
total cost ahead of time.
   The one price patients can learn about prior to admission
is the hospital's basic room rate. If these room rates served
as signals for differences in other prices, patients would at
least be able to pick out the lowest-price hospital prior to
admission.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Unfortunately, hospital room rates are no sure guide to
what the final bill will look like. In most cities room
charges differ by no more than a factor of two to one. Total
hospital bills, on the other hand, can differ as much as 10
to one for the same procedures. Moreover, the hospital with
the highest room rate does not necessarily charge the highest
prices for other services. In Chicago, for example, the
hospital with the highest room rate has some of the lowest
charges for lab tests.</p>
<p>Prior to admission, should you try to find out about the
various charges that you'll be hit with after you are
discharged? Assuming you could find someone in a hospital who
will even talk to you about such matters, you're in for a big
surprise. A single hospital can have as many as 12,000
different line-item prices. For patients doing comparison
shopping among the 50 hospitals in the Chicago area, there
are as many as 600,000 prices to compare. To make matters
worse, different hospitals frequently use different
accounting systems. As a result, the definition of a service
may differ from hospital to hospital in addition to the
differences in the price of the service.</p>
<p>Should you try to find out about general categories of
charges (e.g., lab tests) prior to admission? Again assuming
that you can find out what the hospital's charges are, this
effort often would be of little value. In Dallas, for
example, the hospital with the highest charge for a complete
blood count has the lowest charge for urinalysis, and the
hospital that has the lowest charge for a blood count has the
highest charge for urinalysis. Unless a patient plans to
spend a lot of time driving back and forth among hospitals,
knowledge of these prices is not much help.</p>
<p>Although hospital administrators do not have to give
patients advance notice on what their total bill will be,
hospitals in Illinois are required to tell the state
government. The following are some examples of total charges
for out-patient services in Chicago, reported in 1988:</p>
<p>-- The charge for a mammogram varied from $13 to $127.</p>
<p>-- The charge for a CT scan varied from $59 to $635.</p>
<p>-- Tonsillectomy charges ranged from $125 to $3,365.</p>
<p>-- Cataract removal charges varied from $125 to $4,279.</p>
<p>Most physicians have privileges at more than one hospital,
so choosing a different hospital often does not require
switching doctors. If patients knew about these differences
in charges, they could make huge reductions in their medical
bills. Unfortunately, most do not.</p>
<p>Why are hospital prices so bizarre? Because the hospital
market is a regulated and institutionalized one. We are still
living with the effects of a cost-plus system of hospital
finance that was created by government intervention and has
dominated the marketplace since World War II.</p>
<p>Prior to the 1980s, most hospitals received their revenue
based on costs, not on the prices they charged. Under a
typical formula, if Blue Cross patients accounted for
one-third of a hospital's patient days, the hospital would
bill Blue Cross for one-third of its total costs. Many other
insurers reimbursed hospitals in the same way, as did the
federal government under the Medicare program. Since 90% of
hospital revenue came from insurers, a hospital's line-item
prices were relevant only for a small fraction of the
hospital's income -- the share paid out-of-pocket by
patients.</p>
<p>Hospital line-item prices were used in some of the more
complicated cost-reimbursement formulas, however. This gave
hospitals an incentive to artificially raise or lower prices
to manipulate their reimbursement from some third-party
payers. Soon hospital prices became artifacts rather than
real prices determined by supply and demand.</p>
<p>In the early 1980s, the federal government opted out of
the cost-plus system. Under the Medicare program, the federal
government began paying a single package price (determined in
advance) for hospital procedures. Most private-sector,
third-party payers started paying hospitals on the basis of
charges, rather than costs, and by the end of the 1980s they
were following the lead of Medicare. Today it's not uncommon
for insurance companies and large employers to pay a
predetermined price per procedure or a pre-determined price
per patient day.</p>
<p>These arrangements usually apply only to the insurer's
share of the bill, however. Individual patients are left to
fend for themselves for their share.</p>
<p>As a result, we have now come full circle. Prior to the
1980s, patients paying out of pocket were the only people who
had to struggle with hospital bills that no one could
possibly understand. As we enter the 1990s, we are again
evolving toward a system in which those least capable of
coping with hospital line-item prices are the only people
asked to pay those prices.</p>
<p>We cannot possibly control spiraling health-care costs in
this country unless the consumers can compare prices and make
prudent buying decisions. That cannot happen unless patients
are confronted with a total package price prior to admission.</p>
<p>Since the government helped create the problem, we need
its help in solving it. Any hospital receiving Medicare money
should be required to quote pre-admission prices to all
patients. Thus, patients will know in advance what their
total bill will be -- a bill with only one item and one
price.</p>
