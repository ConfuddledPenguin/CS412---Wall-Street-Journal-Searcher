	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- The U.S. International Trade Commission
ruled that imports of fresh and chilled salmon from Norway
may be injuring domestic industry.
   The ITC's preliminary decisions, made in response to two
trade complaints filed by U.S. producers and processors of
Atlantic salmon, require the Commerce Department to continue
its investigation of charges that these imports violate the
U.S. anti-dumping act and the countervailing duty law. These
imports total about $94 million a year.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The U.S. producers and processors in Northeastern states,
who formed an ad hoc trade group to file the complaints,
alleged that the Norwegian government has provided various
subsidies to Atlantic salmon exporters. They also charged
that Norwegian salmon has been sold at "unfairly low prices"
to U.S. buyers.</p>
<p>If the Commerce Department and the ITC issue final rulings
against the imports from Norway, the U.S. could assess
anti-dumping duties or countervailing duties.</p>
<p>In another decision, the ITC concluded that imports of
electro-mechanical digital counters from Brazil aren't
harming U.S. makers of these devices, which are used for
measuring motor-vehicle mileage and for other purposes. The
decision dismisses the complaint involving these imports,
which total about $1 million a year.</p>
