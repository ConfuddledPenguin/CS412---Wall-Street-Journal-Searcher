	<p class="article-leader">OPEC members are growing increasingly nervous over the
near-collapse of oil prices, which plummeted again yesterday.
   But beyond issuing renewed pleas to overproducers such as
Kuwait to cut output, it's unlikely the Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries will be able to take any action
toward trimming the oil glut before late May. That's when the
13 oil ministers hold their regular midyear conference and
will decide second-half quotas.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>OPEC sources contacted yesterday ruled out the possibility
of any special meeting before then, despite the growing
urgency of world pricing and production problems.
Nevertheless, said a senior official of one OPEC delegation,
"we are really watching the situation closely."</p>
<p>Meantime, petroleum prices approached a free fall.</p>
<p>West Texas Intermediate crude for May delivery plunged
through the psychologically important level of $18 a barrel
yesterday afternoon with hardly a pause. It went on to settle
at $17.68 a barrel, down 76 cents for the day. The June crude
contract fell 61 cents to $18.34 on the New York Mercantile
Exchange.</p>
<p>Only 10 days ago, futures prices of the U.S. benchmark
crude were well above $20 a barrel. Yesterday's closing price
was the lowest for the near-month crude contract since
February 1989.</p>
<p>Futures prices of gasoline fell even further than those
for crude. Unleaded gasoline for May delivery was down 2.46
cents a gallon to 58.43 cents a gallon. Some other monthly
contracts fell the limit of two cents a gallon. May heating
oil was down 0.67 cent.</p>
<p>The U.S. price declines followed earlier drops in European
markets. The extent of the pricing rout surprised oil
analysts. "We've got a blood bath," said Peter Beutel of
Elders Futures Inc.</p>
<p>Oil prices have been coming down since this year's peak in
January. The latest and fastest fall began early last week.
Analysts cited the apparent slowing in petroleum demand and
OPEC output of some 24 million barrels a day, or two million
above the first-half ceiling and the highest since 1981.</p>
<p>There were reports yesterday that many storage facilities
were filled to overflowing. Also, further adding to the
bearish sentiment in oil markets was new evidence of
increasing oil inventories.</p>
<p>Energy Security Analysis Inc. yesterday reported "another
significant build" in crude stocks in Europe for the second
month in a row. According to the Washington-based firm, which
monitors oil supplies world-wide, European crude inventories
increased seven million barrels during the month of March.</p>
<p>Then, after trading had closed, the American Petroleum
Institute released its latest weekly report, which showed a
big buildup in U.S. crude oil inventories. According to the
API, crude inventories, which already were substantially
ahead of the year-earlier level, rose 8.1 million barrels
last week to 370.9 million barrels.</p>
<p>It was clear yesterday that such developments are
beginning to have an impact within OPEC. An editorial in a
pro-government newspaper in Saudi Arabia warned that the
overproduction could lead to another "oil-price crisis." Some
OPEC sources interpreted this as the official reaction in the
kingdom and saw it as a threat that Saudi Arabia might be
considering another pricing war unless quota-cheaters curb
their output.</p>
<p>Kuwait is the chief target of the fingerpointing in OPEC.
It has openly ignored its quota and has recommended that OPEC
quit setting production ceilings. However, Ali Khalifa
Al-Sabah, the Kuwaiti oil minister, has indicated he would
cut output if the OPEC price dropped under $18 a barrel for a
sustained period and if there were no official production
quotas.</p>
<p>One senior OPEC official noted yesterday that the average
of the prices of the seven crudes that make up the OPEC
reference basket had dropped to $17.12 in the first week of
April from $18.28 in the first week of March. "That is more
than $1 in four weeks," he said. "That is precisely what
Sheik Ali of Kuwait said would cause him and others to reduce
their production."</p>
<p>In other commodity markets yesterday:</p>
<p>COCOA: Futures prices soared to ninemonth highs on rumors
of worsening political unrest in the Ivory Coast, the world's
leading cocoa producer. The May-delivery contract, which
eased at the opening, rebounded by more than $100 a metric
ton to close at $1,329, for a gain of $76. That price was the
highest since the September 1989 contract traded at $1,342 on
Aug. 2. Selling that had prevailed in the previous two
sessions continued early yesterday, and traders tended to
ignore reports that bank employees in the Ivory Coast had
gone on strike, analysts said. However, when it was rumored
that the bank strike could create problems with exports, and
that dockworkers might also walk off their jobs, previous
short sellers began buying contracts to cover their
positions, and prices rebounded sharply. Sandra Kaul, an
analyst for Shearson Lehman Hutton, said two things must be
kept in mind with respect to any prospects of interruption of
exports: First, the Ivory Coast is between its main crop and
its second, or midcrop, and very little cocoa is moving to
ports at the moment. Second, Ivory Coast troops are loyal to
President Felix Houphouet-Boigny. "This means that if port
workers go on strike, the troops could be put to work on the
docks, minimizing any interruption of exports," Ms. Kaul
said.</p>
<p>COPPER: Futures prices closed near their highs of the day.
The May-delivery contract ended with a gain of 2.65 cents a
pound at $1.1935, just below the day's high of $1.1950. While
technical considerations may have caused prices to fluctuate
from day to day, strong fundamental factors that underlie the
market have continued right along, and yesterday became more
pronounced, one analyst said. He particularly noted that the
strike of Southern Peru Copper Corp.'s miners and smelter
workers in Peru, which began March 12, continues and could
become a major unsettling element in the market. The analyst
said there were reports that the company sent telegrams to
customers advising them that copper-shipment commitments for
April would be met. The analyst pointed out that the company
was behind in shipments for previous months and that there
was doubt it could make the April shipments. Another analyst
said the company's message to customers "may not have
revealed the full extent of the delays. Southern Peru may
ship the copper that is scheduled to be exported in April,
but it may do so in May or even later." A company spokesman
said Southern Peru had advised its customers that it would
meet shipments for March and April, but it was "premature to
discuss May." He said the company would try to meet its
commitments "on a reasonable schedule." The company produces
about 240,000 tons of refined copper annually. Peru is the
world's sixth-largest copper producer.</p>
<p>GRAINS and SOYBEANS: Prices of corn and soybean futures
contracts might get an upward boost at the open of trading
this morning. After the close of trading yesterday, the
Agriculture Department slightly trimmed its monthly estimate
of the nation's grain stockpiles. The department cut its
estimate for the U.S. soybean stockpile on Aug. 31 to 305
million bushels from its March estimate of 330 million
bushels. The department forecasts the amount of old soybeans
that will be in storage by the time the new harvest begins.
The department cut its estimate of the corn carry-over this
fall to 1.33 billion bushels from the 1.48 billion bushels it
forecast last month. The decline is on the high end of the
range that analysts had expected, according to Victor
Lespinasse, a floor broker with Dean Witter Reynolds,
Chicago. The department pegged the U.S. wheat crop at 442
million bushels, down one million bushels from the March
estimate. However, grain analysts had expected the department
to raise its month-old estimate by about 15 million bushels,
Mr. Lespinasse said. The department also cut its estimate of
the Brazilian soybean harvest, which is about one-third
complete, to 20 million metric tons from the 20.5 million
metric tons it forecast last month. Trading was quiet
yesterday as traders took to the sidelines before the report
was released. Corn prices rose, soybean prices dipped and
wheat prices settled mixed.</p>
