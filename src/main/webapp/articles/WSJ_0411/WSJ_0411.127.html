	<p class="article-leader">A journalist charged with "grievous misconduct" and fired
by his newspaper for breaking an important story for the
public obviously hasn't lost much in terms of prestige. But
Belgian journalist Paul Belien, who was fired by the Gazet
van Antwerpen because of an article published in The Wall
Street Journal Europe last Thursday (and reprinted on this
page yesterday), has paid for his integrity nonetheless.
Charging Mr. Belien with "grievous misconduct," the Antwerp
newspaper, if it wishes, could deny him both severance pay
and unemployment compensation.
   Mr. Belien learned last fall that Belgium's popular King
Baudouin wouldn't be willing to sign a pro-abortion bill that
was making its way through the Belgian parliament. When his
editor in chief, Lou de Clerck, said he was not interested in
the story, Mr. Belien wrote it for the European edition of
the Journal.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Belgians who do not read the Journal only got the news
last week when King Baudouin did refuse to sign, provoking a
constitutional crisis. The matter was resolved when the king
abdicated for two days, allowing the bill to become law. The
Belgian papers could hardly ignore that because it made news
world-wide, but mostly they focused on the constitutional
issue rather than the king's moral position. Mr. Belien
thought, correctly, that the long silence reflected badly on
the press, including his own newspaper, and said so. To his
bosses that was "grievous misconduct."</p>
<p>Mr. Belien knew full well that he was putting his job on
the line but chose to do so as a matter of principle. If
there is anything to be said on behalf of his editors, it
must be noted that abortion is a sensitive issue everywhere,
including the U.S. It is particularly so in Belgium, a
country that has had a sharp psychological division between
its French- and Flemish-speaking populations for ages.
Flemish speakers, by and large, are the more religious and
thus more likely to side with the king's view that abortion
is immoral.</p>
<p>But the abortion bill, written by a socialist and a
liberal senator, is extremely liberal by almost any standard.
What appears to have happened is that Belgium's Christian
Democrats, which like the socialists have separate Flemish
and Walloon parties, didn't want to stir public passions by
making a big issue. Their friends in the press, along with
the friends of the socialists, cooperated.</p>
<p>That's all fine, but newspapers in democracies have a
public trust to responsibly further such debates. The
festering hostility between Belgium's Flemish and Walloons is
not going to go away simply because it is kept in a dark
corner. Belgium's king was wise enough to know that. So, in
our view, was Mr. Belien. Most of all, however, he wanted
simply to be a good journalist. He is not the first reporter
to have been punished for that crime.</p>
