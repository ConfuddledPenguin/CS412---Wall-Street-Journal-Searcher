	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- Lapses by Boeing Co., United Airlines and
the Federal Aviation Administration contributed to last
year's catastrophic failure of a cargo door on a United
Airlines Boeing 747 over the Pacific Ocean, federal
investigators concluded.
   The National Transportation Safety Board took the unusual
step of issuing its findings without having examined the key
piece of evidence, the door itself, which is at the bottom of
the ocean. Safety officials said they intend to retrieve the
door sometime this summer and may amend their conclusions if
new evidence arises.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Based on an analysis of the aircraft damage, the board
concluded that the Feb. 24, 1989, accident was caused by the
"sudden opening of the improperly latched" forward cargo door
at 23,000 feet. The explosive decompression that resulted
caused several feet of cabin floor to collapse, sending nine
passengers to their deaths.</p>
<p>The board said deficiencies in Boeing's door design
contributed to the accident. The cargo doors were supposed to
be failsafe. But the board found that their locking
mechanisms were susceptible to damage.</p>
<p>The current design of the door warning system also makes
it possible for ground crews and pilots to receive false
indications that the doors are properly latched, safety
officials said.</p>
<p>The board cited United, a unit of Chicago-based UAL Corp.
for a "lack of proper maintenance and inspection" of the
door. Safety officials also said Boeing and the FAA failed to
take "timely corrective actions" to fix known problems with
the 747s' locking mechanisms.</p>
<p>Boeing knew the locks were susceptible to damage as far
back as 1975. In March 1987, damaged and broken locks caused
the forward cargo door of a Pan American World Airways Boeing
747 to open slightly in flight. Only two pull-in hooks kept
the door from bursting off.</p>
<p>After that incident, the FAA, acting on a recommendation
from Boeing, ordered airlines to strengthen the 747 locks.
But the FAA gave carriers as long as two years to make the
repairs. United hadn't yet repaired the door on the aircraft
involved in the accident.</p>
<p>"There were several opportunities for the manufacturer,
the airline and the FAA to have taken action during the
service life of the Boeing 747 that would have prevented this
accident," the board concluded.</p>
<p>The board also noted that United had experienced several
problems with the door in the weeks prior to the accident.
"We thought it should have prompted some sort of review" of
the continuing problem, said Ronald L. Schleede, the chief
accident investigator.</p>
<p>Moreover, a clerical error made by United in retyping an
FAA order resulted in the airline's failure to conduct
required inspections of the door, the board said. In
addition, United's "trend analysis program" failed to flag
the repeated problems with the electrical system for opening
and closing the door, the board said.</p>
<p>The board's findings are at odds with a lengthy analysis
submitted by Kevin Campbell, whose son died on Flight 811,
that concluded an electrical malfunction caused the door to
open accidently in flight. Mr. Campbell's findings were the
subject of a Feb. 23 article in The Wall Street Journal.
James Kolstad, board chairman, called an electrical
malfunction "highly improbable."</p>
<p>Reached at his home in Wellington, New Zealand, Mr.
Campbell said: "I cannot agree with the {board} theory of
mishandled locks. It simply doesn't take into account all the
evidence that was presented."</p>
<p>Some steps are already being taken to prevent a similar
catastrophe. Boeing said it is in the process of redesigning
the cargo door's warning system. The current warning system
isn't tied into the locking mechanism, but is triggered by
irregularities in the door's pressure venting system.</p>
<p>In the wake of Flight 811, the FAA ordered immediate
repairs of the 747 lock sectors and more frequent
inspections.</p>
<p>United said it has changed its own procedures since the
accident. The airline said it still hopes the door can be
examined.</p>
<p>The door could have been retrieved over a year ago by a
private contractor for about $2 million. However, United,
Boeing, the safety board and the FAA decided to delay the
project when they learned the Navy could do the job for about
$200,000.</p>
<p>Flight 811 was en route from Honolulu to Aukland, New
Zealand, when the cargo door burst open. Despite damage to
the fuselage, wing flaps and two of four engines, Capt. David
Cronin was able to guide the aircraft back to Honolulu,
saving the lives of 346 people.</p>
