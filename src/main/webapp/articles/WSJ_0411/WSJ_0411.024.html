	<p class="article-leader">Frequent vaginal douching appears to increase the risk of
infections of the female reproductive organs, University of
Washington researchers said.
   In a study involving about 1,000 women, the researchers
calculated that women who douched three to four times a month
had a 3.6 times higher risk of developing pelvic inflammatory
disease than women who used a douche less than once a month.
Women who douche only once or twice a month have 2.5 times
the risk of developing the disorder, they said.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"The present study does not prove that douching can cause
pelvic inflammatory disease . . . but it shows an association
between douching and pelvic inflammatory disease," Pal
Woiner-Hanssen and colleagues reported in this week's Journal
of the American Medical Association.</p>
<p>Pelvic inflammatory disease, a common cause of pelvic pain
in women, results from infections, such as gonorrhea or
chlamydia. It also can occur after miscarriages or abortions.
It can result in damage to the fallopian tubes and
infertility.</p>
