	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Standard & Poor's Corp. placed the long-term
public debt of Time Warner Inc. on its S&P CreditWatch with
negative implications, citing Time Warner's financing
agreement with Pathe Communications Corp.
   About $1.5 billion of rated long-term debt is affected by
the listing, as is about $5.6 billion of rated preferred
stock. The majority of Time Warner's debt isn't affected,
including its commercial paper.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>In a statement, S&P said, "Time Warner's agreement to
guarantee $650 million debt of Pathe Communications Corp.,
pursuant to Pathe's proposed acquisition of MGM/UA
Communications Co., is expected to increase Time Warner's
already substantial financial risk." The rating agency added
that "Time Warner's own bank agreement calls for sizable
repayments in March 1992 (extendable to March 1993), which
will require refinancing in a now more difficult environment
for financing highly leveraged deals."</p>
<p>Several Wall Street analysts said they don't share S&P's
concerns. "This seems a little premature," said Dennis
McAlpine, of Oppenheimer & Co. "We need to see the rest of
the details on the Pathe agreement, but first of all, the
deal may never go through if Pathe can't come up with an
additional $550 million. Secondly, if Pathe defaults, Time
Warner will pick up the UA film library, which industry
estimates say is worth more than $650 million. Finally, I
can't imagine {Time Warner Co-Chairman} Steve Ross betting
his company on Pathe."</p>
<p>Heather Goodchild, a vice president of S&P, explained: "As
we see it, Time Warner doesn't have a lot of debt capacity at
this level. We do appreciate the cash flow benefits that
could result from the transaction, but we consider a
guarantee to be very nearly the financial obligation itself."</p>
<p>Time Warner reportedly has entered into a "support
services" agreement in exchange for the financing under which
it would handle Pathe and MGM/UA releases for theatrical,
television and home-video distribution. Also, Time Warner
obtained the right to acquire warrants that would amount to a
20% stake in the combined Pathe-MGM/UA company at some point.</p>
<p>In its statement, S&P said the agency "continues to view
Time Warner's business positions, cash-generating capacity
and asset values favorably despite the company's aggressive
financial profile."</p>
<p>A spokesman for Time Warner said: "Despite the
CreditWatch, we are nevertheless gratified that S&P continues
to view favorably Time Warner's business positions,
cash-generating capacity and asset values. We believe
strongly in the long-term world-wide benefits of our
agreement, both to Warner Bros. and to Pathe. We believe the
value of the UA library significantly exceeds the $650
million provided in this deal."</p>
<p>Affected by the CreditWatch listing are Time Warner's and
its subsidiaries' double-B rated long-term debt,
single-B-plus subordinated debt and single-B-plus rated
preferred stock. Affected units of Time Warner include
American Television & Communications Corp. (senior debt rated
double-B and commercial paper rated single-B) and Lorimar
Telepictures Corp. (subordinated debt rated single-B-plus),
which are analyzed on a consolidated basis with Time Warner,
S&P said.</p>
