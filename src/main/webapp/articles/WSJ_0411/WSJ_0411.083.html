	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- Charles Keating, testifying in his court
battle to regain control of Lincoln Savings & Loan
Association, asserted that the thrift had net worth of
between $500 million and $700 million when federal regulators
took it over last April.
   The regulators combed Lincoln's books after the takeover,
writing down much of its assets, and have estimated that the
thrift's liabilities exceeded its assets by $2 billion or
more. That cost, the regulators say, will be borne mostly by
taxpayers as part of the bailout of the savings-and-loan
industry.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Judge Stanley Sporkin, who is presiding over the trial in
federal court here, asked attorneys for the government to
call on regulators to explain the write-downs and the overall
valuation of Lincoln. "The government says it's $2 billion in
the red, and the operator says it may be worth $600 million,"
Mr. Sporkin said. "I'm in a quandary." The judge's comments
heartened the lawyers for Mr. Keating.</p>
<p>Mr. Keating, in the second day of questioning by his
lawyers, focused on several individual Lincoln assets that he
claimed the regulators had severely undervalued in order to
justify taking over Lincoln. Mr. Keating is chairman of
American Continental Corp., the former parent of Irvine,
Calif.-based Lincoln.</p>
<p>Much of the testimony focused on the Phoenician, an
opulent hotel and resort built by Lincoln in Phoenix, Ariz.,
for $275 million. After selling a 45% interest in the resort
to an investment arm of the Kuwaiti government for $170
million, Lincoln carried the Phoenician on its books at $173
million. Regulators have since written down the value of the
resort to $99 million.</p>
<p>"That's sick," said Mr. Keating, asserting that Lincoln's
interest is worth $190 million and that the regulators are
ignoring the value of three parcels of land adjacent to the
Phoenician.</p>
<p>At Mr. Sporkin's urging, Mr. Keating also showed the judge
a colorful brochure describing the Phoenician's, which is
built into the side of a mountain and has eight swimming
pools, including one with a floor lined with mother-of-pearl.
Mr. Keating spent 15 minutes describing the Phoencian's nine
Steinway grand pianos, hand-painted ceilings and gold-leaf
detailing. Mr. Keating fought back tears as he recounted the
night last November when regulators, after obtaining approval
from the Kuwaitis, took control of the resort and posted
firing notices at the homes of Phoenician executives.</p>
<p>Mr. Keating's lawyers also argued that Lincoln's
real-estate dealings were highly profitable, despite
complaints by regulators that the investments were too risky.
Mr. Keating said that from 1984 to 1987, Lincoln sold an
average of $191 million in land each year, with an average
gain of $58 million.</p>
<p>Mr. Keating also challenged the regulators' appraisal of a
3,200-acre development called the Uplands in Austin, Texas,
which Lincoln bought from former Texas Gov. John Connally and
former Lt. Gov. Ben Barnes. Regulators wrote down the value
of the development to $30 million from $101 million. Mr.
Keating said the property could be worth $100 million if
handled properly over the next several years. But he conceded
that if sold today, it would probably fetch only $70 million
to $75 million in Austin's depressed real-estate market.</p>
<p>Government lawyers haven't yet crossexamined Mr. Keating,
who is expected to testify for at least two more days.</p>
