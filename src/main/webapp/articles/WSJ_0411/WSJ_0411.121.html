	<p class="article-leader">Alleco Inc., Cheverly, Md., said a federal appeals court
sent back to a lower court Alleco's appeal of an August
decision finding it liable for breaching covenants regarding
$105 million in bonds.
   The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit remanded
the case to the District Court in Minneapolis to determine
whether the federal courts even have jurisdiction over the
lawsuit. The District Court has 90 days to resolve the
question.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Last August, the District Court ruled that the trustee of
Alleco's $105 million in 9 1/2% convertible senior
subordinate debentures could declare the bonds in default
because the company, formerly known as Allegheny Beverage
Corp., dissolved stock-conversion provisions when it went
private in 1988.</p>
<p>Alleco appealed that decision, arguing that it wasn't
responsible for the debentures because Servam Corp. agreed to
assume the payment obligations when it bought Alleco's
food-service operations. Servam has steadily paid both
interest and principal since the 1987 purchase.</p>
