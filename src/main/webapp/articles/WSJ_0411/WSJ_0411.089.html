	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- In a policy pronouncement applauded by the
bond markets, the federal savings and loan bailout agency
said it would continue interest payments on certain S&L debt
after the S&Ls have been seized by the government.
   It continued to insist that it wasn't required to make the
payments, however.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Both Moody's Investors Service Inc. and Standard & Poor's
Corp. said last month that they were reviewing about $20
billion in S&L debt because of questions about the interest
payments. The questions arose when the government's
Resolution Trust Corp. said it believed that the S&L
restructuring law gave it the authority to abandon interest
payments on certain S&L debt even if the interest was backed
by a variety of collateral.</p>
<p>The RTC announced last week that it intended to adopt a
policy of making the payments.</p>
<p>Malcolm Dorris, partner with Dechert Price & Rhoads,
outside counsel to Standard & Poor's, said the rating agency
was pleased with the statement. "From a rating perspective,
it eliminates the concern," he said.</p>
<p>Frances Bermanzohn, general counsel to the Public
Securities Association, called the RTC policy "a vindication
for bondholders. It will restore calm to markets and investor
confidence in the RTC."</p>
