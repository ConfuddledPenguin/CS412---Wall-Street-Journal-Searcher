	<p class="article-leader">BOSTON -- Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis and
private-sector leaders announced steps to help businesses
find willing lenders, amid rising concern that a credit
crunch may be adding to the state's economic woes.
   The measures are modest. The most concrete is a "credit
hot line and clearing house" to match borrowers and lenders.
But they add fuel to the debate over whether federal banking
regulators, by forcing some of New England's leading banks to
make massive provisions for troubled real-estate loans, may
inadvertently have caused credit problems for a broad range
of small and medium-sized businesses.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The joint news conference in the governor's Beacon Hill
chambers also underscores a growing fear in business circles
here that the early 1990s could resemble the troubled years
before the so-called Massachusetts miracle of the 1980s. With
corporate and sales tax revenues down sharply from a year
ago, the state is expected to run a deficit of close to $1
billion for the fiscal year that ends June 30. And the
state's unemployment rate, which for years was far below the
national average, climbed to 5.4% in March compared with 5.2%
for the country.</p>
<p>Mr. Dukakis continued to voice optimism about the state's
economic health. But, he said, "There is something seriously
wrong when businesses that are paying their loans on schedule
live in fear of having their credit suddenly pulled."</p>
<p>"Nobody is suggesting our banks shouldn't be following
good, solid" credit policies, he added. But banking
regulators, "in their concern for the soundness of certain
real-estate loans," may be causing banks to tighten up on
lending to healthy businesses "that have nothing to do with
real estate."</p>
<p>U.S. Comptroller of the Currency Robert Clarke, whose
examiners have been the focus of much of the controversy,
said in a speech last weekend that charges that his agency is
responsible for New England's economic problems are
unfounded. The examiners have only forced bankers to
recognize already deteriorating market conditions, Mr. Clarke
said.</p>
<p>Indeed, some bankers say that skittish bankers -- not Mr.
Clarke's examiners -- may be the main culprits behind any
unwarranted credit crunch. Alan Morse, vice chairman of the
Massachusetts Bankers Association and chairman of U.S. Trust
Co., Boston, said many banks in the state remain able and
willing to make loans to credit-worthy companies.</p>
<p>"The fact that the regulators have come on so strong {in
evaluating real-estate loans} has caused banks to re-evaluate
all their underwriting standards," Mr. Morse said in an
interview after the news conference. But, while some banks
may be requiring more collateral or other added assurances,
"that's a far cry from banks ringing up their customers one
day and saying `Goodbye, the loan is canceled.' That's only
happening where specific banks and bankers are overreacting."</p>
<p>Joseph Blair, executive director of Massachusetts
Industrial Finance Agency, said that 25% of 200 companies
surveyed recently by the quasi-public agency reported
"serious problems" with their working capital. Some have had
their lines of credit suspended or renegotiated as
fixed-term, rather than revolving, loans. Others have had
lower limits placed on the portion of receivables they can
use as collateral.</p>
<p>Besides the hot-line service, Mr. Dukakis said further
surveys will be conducted and a letter will be sent this week
to all Massachusetts banks "urging them to do all they can to
take up the credit slack." In addition, the Coalition of
Northeast Governors, currently chaired by Mr. Dukakis, will
meet with federal credit regulators in Washington "once all
facts have been gathered," according to Mr. Dukakis's office.</p>
