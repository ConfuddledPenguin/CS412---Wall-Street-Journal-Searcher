	<p class="article-leader">Treasury-bond prices were clobbered in a late sell-off,
but stock prices edged higher and the dollar slipped in a
continuation of the lackluster trading that has characterized
financial markets during the past few days.
   The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 9.01 points to
2731.08. Volume continued on the light side, and for the
second consecutive day the market was mixed, with more issues
on the New York Stock Exchange falling than rising.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Long-term Treasury bonds ended moderately lower after
being off through much of the day as traders awaited the
results of the auction of $3.5 billion of 40-year Resolution
Funding Corp. bonds. The dollar fell against the mark and the
yen in thin trading.</p>
<p>Analysts said U.S. stock prices remain stable, despite
continued volatility in the Tokyo stock market. After two
days of gains, the Nikkei Index of 225 stocks plunged 773.25
points, or 2.5%, to 29624.68 Tuesday. Analysts are divided
about the impact of Japan's stock-market problems on U.S.
stock prices.</p>
<p>Although U.S. money managers continue to be wary of
potential disappointments as the rush of first-quarter
corporate-earnings reports begins to accelerate, they got a
pleasant surprise yesterday when Motorola reported
better-than-expected first-quarter results. The stock rose 4
1/4 to 68 1/2 on almost two million shares.</p>
<p>Bond traders said the $3.5 billion Refcorp auction went
much worse than expected. The 40-year bonds were priced to
yield 8.89%. Traders had hoped for better results after the
first auction of Refcorp bonds in January sent prices of
long-term Treasurys into a nose dive. Prior to the auction,
traders said the Treasury had done a better job of preparing
the market for yesterday's sale. Not only was the amount
smaller -- $3.5 billion vs. $4 billion in January -- but the
timing was more favorable, coming considerably in advance of
the Treasury's quarterly refunding auction.</p>
<p>Currency dealers said the dollar's modest retreat in the
face of restrained central-bank intervention was mostly
because of the sluggish trading in the Passover and Easter
holiday week, rather than any fundamental problems for the
dollar. They said the intervention by central banks selling
dollars for yen has been nothing more than symbolic support
for the Bank of Japan, following the weekend meeting of the
Group of Seven major industrialized nations.</p>
<p>In major market action:</p>
<p>Stock prices rose modestly in light trading. Big Board
volume totaled 136 million shares. Decliners led gainers 740
to 723.</p>
<p>Bond prices slumped. The Treasury's benchmark 30-year
issue fell more than half a point, or more than $5 for each
$1,000 of face amount. The yield on the issue rose to 8.59%.</p>
<p>The dollar was lower. In late afternoon New York trading
the dollar was quoted at 1.6755 marks and 157.60 yen compared
with 1.6935 marks and 158.23 yen Monday.</p>
