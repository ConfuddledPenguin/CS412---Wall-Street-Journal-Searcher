	<p class="article-leader">Bell Atlantic Corp. said its Bell of Pennsylvania phone
unit agreed to pay $42 million to settle charges that it used
"deceptive techniques" to sell customers more services than
they wanted.
   The settlement puts an end to a two-year lawsuit by the
Pennsylvania attorney general and consumer advocate offices,
which accused the phone company of selling extra services --
such as call waiting, speed dialing and wire-maintenance
plans -- without explaining prices or informing customers
that the services were optional, as required by regulations.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"In many cases, packages of optional services were
recommended without regard to the consumer's telephone habits
or ability to pay," said Attorney General Ernie Preate Jr.</p>
<p>The settlement is one of the largest of its kind and comes
on the heels of a U.S. Treasury Department action that
suspends Bell Atlantic from receiving future business from
the federal government. The department alleges that Bell
Atlantic's Chesapeake & Potomac Telephone Co. unit misled the
agency on a phone bid.</p>
<p>Under terms of the settlement, Bell of Pennsylvania agreed
to pay $36.4 million in refunds to about 1.5 million
residential customers, $5 million to a newly established
telephone education fund and $450,000 to the state. Bell
Atlantic said the settlement isn't expected to have a
material impact on earnings.</p>
<p>In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday,
shares of Philadelphia-based Bell Atlantic closed at $94.125,
down 25 cents.</p>
<p>According to the attorney general and consumer advocate
offices, the illegal marketing practices stem from
predetermined sales scripts that Bell of Pennsylvania
customer representatives were required to use when attempting
to sell optional services. In addition, the offices maintain
that the representatives were subject to quotas or bonus
plans, which were based on the number of optional services
they sold.</p>
<p>Agents discovered the practice in 1987 when 32 telephone
service inquiries were placed at various Bell of Pennsylvania
centers across the state. Of those, there were 23 cases in
which sales representatives assigned services without saying
they were options.</p>
<p>William Harral, Bell of Pennsylvania's vice president of
external and financial affairs, said the sales practices in
question were in operation between 1985 and 1988 and have
been since suspended. He said that on average, consumers will
receive $12 for every optional feature they didn't want. In
the refund proposal, the company expects to advertise
extensively and will mail notices telling customers they may
be eligible for refunds.</p>
<p>Bell of Pennsylvania is the second phone company to be
charged with overaggressive marketing practices. In 1986,
Pacific Telesis Group's Pacific Bell Telephone Co. unit in
California was ordered to refund $35.6 million to customers
who were sold optional services they didn't want. Regulators
and consumer advocates blame the problem on market
deregulation in phone services since the breakup of American
Telephone & Telegraph Co. in 1984.</p>
