	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Apple Bancorp, mounting a defense against an
unsolicited tender offer, said its directors unanimously
rejected the $121.6 million proposal by its largest
shareholder and directed managers to seek other possible
bids.
   The thrift holding company said directors found the
$38-a-share offer from real-estate investor Stanley Stahl to
be against the company's and shareholders' interests. It said
directors have been advised by Apple's financial adviser,
Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette Securities Corp., that the offer
was financially unfair. The company recommended that
shareholders reject the offer and not tender their shares to
Mr. Stahl, who already owns a 30.6% Apple stake. Apple
Bancorp is the parent of Apple Bank for Savings.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The company's shares rose sharply on news of Mr. Stahl's
$38-a-share offer late last month, and closed yesterday at
$41.875 each, up 12.5 cents, in New York Stock Exchange
composite trading. Before the offer, Apple Bancorp shares had
been trading around $32 each.</p>
<p>Mr. Stahl couldn't be reached for comment on the
rejection.</p>
<p>In further defensive moves, the company said it is filing
a lawsuit in federal court in Delaware and bolstering Apple's
anti-takeover shareholder-rights plan. Apple said the suit
alleges that Mr. Stahl's bid violates federal disclosure
requirements and is "materially misleading."</p>
<p>The shareholder-rights plan, which allows holders to
acquire additional shares at half price under certain
circumstances, was amended to be triggered even if a suitor
owned 80% of the shares as a result of a tender offer.
Previously, the plan wouldn't have been applicable under such
circumstances. Another change allows directors to redeem the
rights for a period after a stockholder becomes an "acquiring
person" under the plan.</p>
<p>In the wake of the developments, Apple said, it also
postponed the annual meeting, which was planned for late May.
Apple didn't set a new date.</p>
<p>Apple had assets of $3.8 billion at the end of 1989. It
has 35 branches in New York City, Long Island and Westchester
County.</p>
