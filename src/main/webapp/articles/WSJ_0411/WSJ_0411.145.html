	<p class="article-leader">Morgan Stanley & Co., New York, said an offering of seven
million put warrants on the Nikkei index of 225 stocks on the
Tokyo Stock Exchange has been postponed.
   A Morgan Stanley spokesman said the offering, which was to
be made by Morgan Stanley Group Inc., was reportedly
postponed because of the recent volatility in the Japanese
stock market. In general, increased volatility raises the
price of warrants, making the option-like instruments more
difficult to sell. Yesterday, in Tokyo, the Nikkei index --
which has plummeted 23.9% this year -- rose 2.5% after
falling 3.8% Monday.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Meanwhile, syndicate officials at PaineWebber Inc. said
they plan to price next week a similar offering by
PaineWebber Group Inc. The firm is slated to offer five
million Nikkei stock average put warrants and 3.5 million
Nikkei stock average call warrants.</p>
<p>A put warrant is an option to sell a security at a
specified price, usually within a limited period. A call is
an option to buy a security at a specified price, also
usually within a certain period.</p>
