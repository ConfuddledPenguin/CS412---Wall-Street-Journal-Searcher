	<p class="article-leader">SAN DIEGO -- A Cubic Corp. engineer was acquitted on
charges that he took part in falsifying records on a U.S.
Army mine-detector contract.
   Dennis B. Fink, 41 years old, was acquitted in a retrial
in federal court here, after a jury last year failed to vote
unanimously to acquit or convict him on 21 counts, including
conspiracy to defraud the government and submitting false
records. He was acquitted on two counts at that time.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>William B. Bauder, program manager for the mine-detector
program, was acquitted on all counts last August. The two men
were indicted by a federal grand jury in March 1988, after an
investigation that began in 1984.</p>
<p>In 1988, Cubic, a high-technology concern, paid the
federal government about $7.3 million to settle claims that
it fraudulently tested the hand-held mine detectors it
refurbished for the Navy.</p>
