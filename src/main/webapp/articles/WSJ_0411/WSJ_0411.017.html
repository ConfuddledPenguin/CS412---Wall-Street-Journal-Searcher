	<p class="article-leader">DALLAS -- In its effort to gauge the effectiveness of
prosecutors dealing with thrift-related fraud, the House
Banking Committee decided to ask some people who should know.
   For its hearings here today, the committee invited the
former owners of four expensively defunct Texas thrifts:
Thomas M. Gaubert of Independent American Savings
Association; Edwin T. McBirney III of Sunbelt Savings
Association of Texas; Don R. Dixon of Vernon Savings & Loan
Association, and Jarrett E. Woods Jr. of Western Savings
Association.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>All are targets of a U.S. Justice Department investigation
that has been grinding away for more than three years,
probing the improper lending practices and other abuses that
led to the collapse of the four thrifts. Except for Mr.
Gaubert, none of the four men has been charged with criminal
wrongdoing. And Mr. Gaubert's indictment, which didn't
involve his stewardship of Independent American, ended in
acquittal in 1988. Of the four, only Mr. Gaubert considered
appearing before the committee, but he has another
obligation: He is currently serving on a Dallas County grand
jury.</p>
<p>A banking committee staff member said the four men were
invited to give them an opportunity to respond to allegations
that are sure to be made by other witnesses. Otherwise, the
hearing will focus on prosecutors' progress in investigating
thrift fraud.</p>
<p>The panel "isn't going in there with a feeling that {the
progress} has been good or bad," says a staff member. "But
members are hearing that the constituents are impatient with
the pace of the prosecutions and convictions."</p>
<p>Some would consider the pace glacial, including the
targets of the investigations. All four were out of the
thrift business by early 1987 and remain in judicial and
business limbo today.</p>
<p>Of the four, Mr. Gaubert, who relinquished control of
Independent American Savings in 1984, has spent the most time
in the cross hairs of the government's guns. He was indicted
and acquitted in 1988 of charges that he defrauded a tiny
Iowa thrift, and a five-year statute of limitations on
prosecutions now precludes charges for any criminal activity
that may have occurred at Independent American.</p>
<p>But the Justice Department's Dallas Bank Fraud Task Force
keeps questioning, among other things, Mr. Gaubert's
borrowings and other transactions with the defunct Sunbelt
Savings, according to lawyers whose clients have been
questioned about Mr. Gaubert.</p>
<p>"It remains very curious why the Justice Department
concentrates so much time and effort on this one guy who's
been out of the S&L for more than five years, unless it's
because they hold a grudge and don't like to see people
acquitted," says Mr. Gaubert's attorney, Abbe David Lowell of
Washington, D.C.</p>
<p>While the investigation drags on, Mr. Gaubert is battling
thrift regulators in court over the terms of their takeover
of Independent American. In a separate court case, he is
dueling with Sunbelt Savings FSB, which took on the assets of
the defunct Sunbelt, over $35.3 million in loans that Mr.
Gaubert guaranteed in 1985. Among the loans was one for $6
million he used to buy controlling interest in TeleCom Corp.,
a holding company with interests in air-conditioning
distribution and conveying-equipment manufacturing.</p>
<p>Mr. McBirney is struggling with his own publicly traded
holding company, Oxidyne Group Inc. A subsidiary, Oxidyne
Corp., apparently has developed some promising technology for
the oxidation of solid waste in mile-deep wells, but the
company hasn't been able to scare up the $12 million to $18
million it needs to fulfill its first contract, with Houston.</p>
<p>Could it have something to do with the reputation of Mr.
McBirney, whose wild and woolly spending at the old Sunbelt
earned it the nickname Gunbelt Savings? "I know it's an
impediment to the company," Mr. McBirney says of his position
as Oxidyne Group chief executive. He is now seeking a buyer
for the company, or at least a new chief executive.</p>
<p>In the meantime, federal investigators are inching closer
to indicting Mr. McBirney with the cooperation of several
former officers of Sunbelt subsidiaries.</p>
<p>Mr. McBirney won't appear before the House Banking
Committee "in this atmosphere," says Paul E. Coggins, his
attorney. "That will happen to one of my clients when
elephants start to fly."</p>
<p>Mr. Woods, who was ousted from the ownership of Western
Savings in September 1986, has also paid a price for his
thrift days. When the Dallas Morning News reported last year
that a company owned by trust funds for Mr. Woods's children
was attempting to get millions of dollars in government loans
to rehabilitate a South Dallas apartment complex, city
officials and the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban
Development quashed the deal.</p>
<p>Now, Mr. Woods is having to demolish most of the apartment
complex and must show the city proof of financing for repairs
of the remainder, according the terms of a court settlement
with the city.</p>
<p>Mr. Woods "just wishes it would all go away, and he could
get on with his life," says Paul M. Wolff, one of Mr. Woods's
attorneys from the Washington law firm of Williams &
Connolly. Mr. Wolff says his client is working in real
estate, but won't be more specific. And the lawyer says he
has heard little from the Bank Fraud Task Force "except they
tell me they hate my client."</p>
<p>A Justice Department spokesman said the agency wouldn't
comment on the progress of its investigations.</p>
<p>Since Mr. Dixon left Vernon Savings in mid-1986, he has
maintained a low profile, a sharp contrast to the days when
Vernon paid for tours of Europe and a home in California.
Now, his attorney, William M. Ravkind, says Mr. Dixon is
involved in an offshore insurance deal but wouldn't be more
specific.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the trappings of Mr. Dixon's old life are being
auctioned away under the auspices of the U.S. Bankruptcy
Court in Dallas. So far, the auctions have netted about $2
million, most of that from the sale of a vintage-car
dealership that Mr. Dixon owned in California.</p>
<p>Just last week, Mr. Dixon got a glimpse of the future when
Vernon's former chairman and chief executive, Woody F.
Lemons, was sentenced to 30 years in federal prison for
accepting kickbacks from Vernon borrowers, among other
things.</p>
<p>"That makes plea bargaining doubtful," Mr. Ravkind says.
"I guess we'd better not lose."</p>
