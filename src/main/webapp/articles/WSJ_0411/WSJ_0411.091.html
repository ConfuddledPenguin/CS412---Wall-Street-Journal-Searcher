	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- Olympic Federal Savings & Loan, the
insolvent Berwyn, Ill., thrift whose earlier court case
briefly halted the savings-and-loan industry bailout, lost
two court fights to prevent regulators from seizing it.
   The insolvent thrift, with $1.1 billion in assets,
recently won a court ruling that blocked the Office of Thrift
Supervision from seizing it. The S&L had argued that the
action of the thrift office was illegal, because its former
director didn't receive Senate confirmation as required by
the Constitution. The federal appeals court here ruled late
Monday that the case, on appeal by the government, was moot
because Timothy Ryan was sworn in Monday as the new director,
following his confirmation by the Senate last week.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Yesterday, the U.S. district court here refused to grant
the thrift a new temporary restraining order, based on
another argument: that the government hadn't properly
considered Olympic's request for financial assistance. But
the district court will hear arguments on the merits of
Olympic's case at a trial, to be held at an undetermined
date.</p>
<p>The thrift office hasn't announced plans for taking over
Olympic Federal, but because of deficiencies in its capital,
a government seizure appears likely.</p>
