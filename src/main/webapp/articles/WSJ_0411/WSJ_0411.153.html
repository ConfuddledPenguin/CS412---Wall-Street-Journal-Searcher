	<p class="article-leader">Springs Industries Inc. said its first-quarter earnings
will be about half the 86 cents a share, or $15.3 million,
reported in the same period last year.
   The Fort Mill, S.C., textile manufacturer attributed the
expected profit decrease to "continued declines in both
volume and margins in finished fabrics, and somewhat lower
margins in home furnishings and industrial segments."</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Last year's first quarter was one of the strongest in the
company's history. That 46% increase from the 1988 period
reflected improved performance in all segments, including a
return to profitability of its finished-fabrics operations.</p>
<p>The company said first-quarter earnings "should follow
more closely the pattern of 1986, 1987 and 1988, when they
were 53 cents, 51 cents and 59 cents a share, respectively."</p>
<p>Analysts' 1990 earnings estimates for Springs ranged from
$3.70 to $4.10 a share. In 1989, Springs reported earnings of
$3.64 a share, or $64.9 million, on sales of $1.9 billion.</p>
<p>In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday,
Springs shares closed at $33, down 87.5 cents.</p>
