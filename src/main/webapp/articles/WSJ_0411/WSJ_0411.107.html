	<p class="article-leader">Citing "continuing favorable economic developments,"
Dresdner Bank AG said its earnings in 1989 grew strongly.
   The West German commercial banking group said its group
partial operating profit rose 17% to 1.88 billion marks
($1.11 billion) from 1.60 billion marks ($944 million) a year
earlier.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>On a group basis, the company said that the full operating
profit climbed at a higher rate than the partial operating
profit because of higher earnings from trading for its own
account. The bank didn't provide any data on full operating
profit.</p>
<p>Partial operating profit excludes profit or losses from
trading for its own account. Group results contain all of the
bank's world-wide activities.</p>
