	<p class="article-leader">The over-the-counter stock market overcame morning early
jitters to edge up in light but broad-based trading that
heartened veteran investors.
   The Nasdaq composite index closed up 1.72 at 431.90, or
0.4%. The market opened lower in the first hour, but firmed
steadily during the day with support that wasn't confined to
one market sector. Technology, biotechnology, environmental
and some of the battered regional bank shares all did well.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Advancing shares just outpaced decliners, 959 to 947.
Nasdaq volume picked up, with 129,503,900 shares changing
hands compared with Monday's 112,366,600.</p>
<p>While some players stayed on the sidelines because of this
week's religious holidays, traders said they saw selective
buying among bargain hunters.</p>
<p>"The market looks great," said Richard A. Bruno, managing
director of OTC trading at PaineWebber. "The tone is good,
retail activity is fairly brisk for a week with two holidays
and the institutional interest is pretty good."</p>
<p>At Kidder Peabody, senior OTC trader Peter Coolidge said
the market strength was "broadly based and not dominated by
any one area." Although many investors were "sitting on the
fence" because of this week's holidays, he said, "activity
was encouraging. Buyers stepped in to take advantage of
weakness." Mr. Coolidge and PaineWebber's Mr. Bruno said
there was interest in environmental issues. Shearson Lehman
Hutton's OTC bank trader Eric Siefert said he saw a rebound
in some regional bank shares.</p>
<p>Bargain hunting benefited these regional bank shares,
according to Shearson Lehman Hutton's Mr. Siefert. Among the
rebounders that climbed on heavy volume were Midlantic, up 2
to 15 7/8, U.S. Bancorp, up 1 to 26 3/8, Dominion Bankshares,
up 1/2 to 15 7/8, BayBanks, up 3/4 to 16 and Boatmen's
Bancshares, up 5/8 to 30 1/8. Crestar Financial rose 1/8 to
26 3/4.</p>
<p>Environmental shares got a boost from a report in this
newspaper about the popularity of funds that invest in
companies in volved in cleaning up the environment. Among the
gainers for the day were Clean Harbors Inc., up 1/2 to 8 1/2,
Sevenson Environmental Services, up 1 1/4 to 13 3/4, and
Groundwater Technology, up 1 to 22 3/4.</p>
<p>In the biotechnology arena, the ongoing competition
between Xoma and Centocor to get to the market first with a
product that treats septic shock sparked activity in both
shares. Centocor was due to release an abstact indicating
that its product would treat more patients than Xoma's.
However, analysts told Dow Jones Professional Investor Report
the two studies aren't comparable. Centocor closed down 1 1/4
at 30 1/4, while Xoma closed up 1 3/4 at 18 3/4 on more than
one million shares.</p>
<p>Technology stocks remained in favor, with MIPS Computer
Systems surging 3 1/8 to close at 23 1/4 and Adobe Systems
closing up 1 3/4 at 38 1/2 on strong volume.</p>
<p>Adobe got a fast start off the block, surging more than a
point in early trading after Shearson Lehman Hutton analyst
David S. Nelson boosted his short-term investment opinion to
the firm's top "1" rating.</p>
<p>Mr. Nelson says he thinks investors haven't adequately
valued the franchise Adobe has secured with its PostScript
technology, a software system that integrates graphics, text
and images with printers and electronic terminals. Adobe and
other computer companies are expected later this month to
unveil a series of products using PostScript, which may
include highspeed printing and the use of color, according to
Mr. Nelson.</p>
<p>Calling Adobe's technology an industry standard, the
Shearson analyst says he thinks the company's shares should
trade at a 50% premium to the S&P 500 and an earnings
multiple of about 20 times earnings. Based on his estimated
1991 earnings for Adobe of $2.95 a share, Mr. Nelson says he
thinks the stock could trade at about $60 a share in the next
12 to 18 months.</p>
<p>On the merger front, Automated Systems nearly doubled in
price after Cadence Design Systems announced it will acquire
Automated in exchange for stock. Cadence, based in San Jose,
Calif., said it will issue one million common shares in
exchange for all of the Brookfield, Wis.-based company's
shares, at an exchange ratio of 0.3 Cadence shares for each
Automated share. Both software companies showed gains, with
Automated surging 3 to close at 6 1/4. Cadence closed up 1
1/8 at 24 7/8.</p>
<p>Lancaster Colony leaped more than three points before
Nasdaq temporarily halted trading in the stock after Newell
Co. said it now has a 5.6% position in the maker of
household, automotive and food products and may seek control
of it. Lancaster, based in Columbus, Ohio, shot back that it
plans to oppose Newell, a Freeport, Ill.-maker of home
furnishings. After reopening for trading, Newell closed up 24
7/8, up 1/4.</p>
