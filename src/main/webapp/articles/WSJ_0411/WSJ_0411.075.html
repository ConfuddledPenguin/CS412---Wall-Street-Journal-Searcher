	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- An international pilots group put seven U.S.
locations on its so-called "Black Star" list of areas it
considers "critically deficient" in safety.
   The International Federation of Air Line Pilots
Associations said the action was in response to changes in
air-traffic control procedures by the Federal Aviation
Administration in those areas.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The seven locations cited are Terminal Control Areas --
chunks of tightly controlled airspace -- around the following
airports: Charlotte, N.C.; Cleveland, Ohio; Dallas-Fort
Worth; Los Angeles; Memphis, Tenn.; Philadelphia; and
Phoenix, Ariz. The pilots group said that it wasn't concerned
about the airports themselves, but about the way the FAA is
managing the areas surrounding them.</p>
<p>The FAA adopted the disputed procedural changes in Los
Angeles in 1988 and at the other areas since then. Generally,
controllers are required to keep airliners that are flying on
the same altitude within Terminal Control Areas three miles
apart. But now, in the seven areas, controllers aren't
required to meet that standard, but instead may use their own
discretion. The approach is called "conflict resolution,"
meaning controllers may use their own judgment about how to
resolve potential conflicts between aircraft.</p>
<p>The FAA contends that the new approach, which is still
considered experimental and will be reviewed in detail in
August, hasn't hurt safety and has increased the number of
flights into the airports. "The controller is able to shorten
the separation between two planes, but not to the point where
it endangers the aicraft," said FAA spokesman Robert
Buckhorn. "It works very well." About 20 other Terminal
Control Areas still operate under the tighter rules.</p>
<p>Controllers like the new rule because it increases their
flexibility, said Larry Barbour, safety chairman for the
National Air Traffic Controllers Association.</p>
<p>But pilots want the FAA to return to standard separation
rules for all Terminal Control Areas. The new procedures
being used at the seven airports represent an "unacceptable
erosion of safety standards," said Henry Duffy, president of
the Air Line Pilots Association. He said the rule effectively
tells controllers, "Don't let the radar images merge." The
Air Line Pilots Association is a member of the international
pilots group.</p>
<p>Before the international group added the seven areas to
its list, only one U.S. destination had a Black Star -- the
airport in St. Thomas, Virgin Islands. The Black Star listing
doesn't result in a boycott by pilots, or any kind of a
reduction in flights into the listed locations. It does mean
that the international pilots group will advise pilots around
the world to take extra care when flying into the locations
listed.</p>
