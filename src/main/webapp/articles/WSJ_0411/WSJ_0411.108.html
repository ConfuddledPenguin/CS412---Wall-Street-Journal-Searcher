	<p class="article-leader">States Try to Take Edge
   Off Mortgage `Points'</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>PROMPTED by consumer complaints, several states would like
to eliminate or cap mortgage "points" and other origination
fees to make housing more affordable. Lenders warn, though,
that loss of the fees would in fact make housing costlier.</p>
<p>A handful of states have considered such efforts in the
past, and Massachusetts and Rhode Island now have bills in
their statehouses. In Massachusetts, the Legislature is
pondering a bill that would eliminate points on residential
mortgages, while Rhode Island is considering legislation that
would eliminate not only points but also origination fees.
One point is equal to one percentage point of the loan;
origination fees cover appraisals, title insurance and other
expenses.</p>
<p>The move to contain closing costs has grown in recent
years because of mounting housing affordability problems. The
points and closing costs are enough to make ownership
unattainable for cash-pinched first-time buyers, lawmakers
who introduced the bills argue. All told, buyers pay an
average of $4,000 to $7,000 for points and fees -- in
addition to a down payment, which has gone up in recent years
to 20% from 10% in many major markets.</p>
<p>Support is uneven in both states for the bills, partly
because lenders have driven home their argument that a loss
of points will bring higher rates. That argument helped
discourage the passage of similar bills elsewhere, most
recently in Pennsylvania.</p>
<p>Bad Real Estate Loans</p>
<p>Haunt More Than Thrifts</p>
<p>EVERYONE KNOWS that thrifts have a disastrous record in
real estate lending. But many banks can't seem to get it
right, either.</p>
<p>Looking at the number of real estate loans that go bad as
a percentage of total real estate loans made, the bank
dishonor roll is led by First American Bank & Trust Co.,
North Palm Beach, Fla. Next is the Citibank unit in Dania,
Fla., according to data through Sept. 30, 1989, compiled by
Sheshunoff Information Services Inc., an Austin, Texas,
financial-services information firm. On average, 3% of the
bank industry's real estate loan portfolio goes bad,
Sheshunoff says.</p>
<p>Citibank, which had two units in the top 50 list of big
banks with high percentages of problem loans, declined to
comment. But spokesmen at the other banks attributed their
loan woes to slowdowns in regional economies, overbuilding or
both. First Interstate, with three units in the top 50, says
the level of bad loans partly reflects the well-documented
problems of overbuilding and over-zealous lending.</p>
<p>The First Interstate/Arizona unit was "caught up in the
euphoria" of a boom market in the 1980s, says Jerry Jordan,
chief economist at the Los Angeles-based parent. First
Interstate/Houston, where 20.2% of the loans have soured,
bought the bad loans through acquisition. "There was a lot
more junk" in the acquired portfolios than previously
thought, Mr. Jordan says.</p>
<p>Although bad real estate bank lending has largely been
overshadowed by the thrift mess, that will soon change, says
Dennis Jacobe, director of research for the U.S. League of
Savings Institutions. New England banks, for example, are
likely to show up more often on the Sheshunoff list as the
region's listless economy produces more troubled properties.</p>

<p>By Some Estimates,</p>
<p>Appraisal Fees Will Rise</p>
<p>HOME BUYERS are likely to see a jump in closing costs
because of a federal rule that forces states to police
appraisers more closely.</p>
<p>Under the U.S. thrift rescue bill enacted last summer,
states are rushing to enact legislation by 1991 that would
provide for a board to license or certify appraisers. States
would be required to establish minimum standards for
appraisers, who set values for all properties, be they
single-family homes or office buildings.</p>
<p>Industry groups say if appraisers have to be approved and
monitored, the cost of appraisals -- required for closing the
deal -- could "easily double" from the current average of
$100 to $300, says Norman D. Flynn, president of the National
Association of Realtors.</p>
<p>In some places where there is already a shortage of
appraisers, the price could soar. Nevada estimates that the
cost could jump to $600 to $700 from the current average of
$250, the NAR says.</p>
<p>Some say appraisers are behind the rash of bad real estate
loans. In many cases, appraisers inflated the property's
value allowing lenders to extend more credit to builders, who
in turn were forced to pay fatter lender fees. The practice
has exacerbated the massive failures of thrifts, which have
taken hefty write-downs on real estate whose values were
exaggerated.</p>
