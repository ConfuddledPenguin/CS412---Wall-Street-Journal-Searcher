	<p class="article-leader">Ed McCabe, the co-founder of Scali, McCabe Sloves who quit
the ad business three years ago, is back -- but he's chosen a
most unlikely comeback vehicle: Beber Silverstein, a small,
Miami-based regional ad agency.
   Mr. McCabe, 51 years old, says he will become chairman of
the agency's New York office, a tiny service office that
handles several Coty perfumes. His choice dumbfounded
industry executives, considering that he co-founded an agency
that now bills over $880 million and considering the outsized
reputation he brings with him. One of the most famous -- and
most vocal -- copywriters in the business, he helped
transform Frank Perdue into the "tough man to make a tender
chicken" and crafted campaigns for Volvo, Hebrew National and
others.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"I've had all kinds of possibilities," says Mr. McCabe,
who toyed with screenwriting, Broadway and writing a second
book before deciding to come back to the advertising fold. "I
finally decided I didn't want to be in a big, established
agency, and I didn't want to do it completely from scratch.
This is the closest thing to having your own agency without
having the headaches of a start-up."</p>
<p>Beber Silverstein, one of the few agencies run by women,
is most notable for creating Leona Helmsley's long-running
"the Queen stands guard" ads for her hotel chain. Mrs.
Helmsley fired the agency two years ago after it took on a
Florida condo project from rival developer Donald Trump.
Current clients are mostly regional Florida companies,
including the Humana hospital chain, Florida Power & Light
and Knight-Ridder. Mr. McCabe will become an equity partner
in the $69 million shop, which will change its name to Beber,
Silverstein, McCabe & Partners.</p>
<p>Mr. McCabe's move is just the latest in a series of
unpredictable steps he seems to thrive on. After almost 20
years with Scali McCabe, he quit the agency at the end of
1986 to dabble in other things, tackled the Paris-Dakar car
race and posed for various glossy magazines with such props
as a Bentley and a glamorous blond girlfriend.</p>
<p>He later worked on the ad team of the ill-fated Dukakis
presidential campaign, then surfaced at London ad agency
Abbott, Meade, Vickers, which until recently was in merger
talks with Scali. Most recently he finished a book on the
Paris-Dakar race, "Against Gravity," to be published in June.
He refers to himself in conversation as a "Renaissance man."</p>
<p>Until recently, Mr. McCabe often suggested that he would
never return to the ad agency business. But friends say he
missed being a player on Madison Avenue, where he is a
recognizable figure, a famous name rather than a faceless
author.</p>
<p>"I think he missed it," says Marvin Sloves, Scali McCabe's
chairman. "I think he needs the money, like any of us, and I
think he found an opportunity where he can make a difference
-- and it's very important for Ed to make a difference in
anything he touches. He isn't a corporate guy; he's got to
change the world."</p>
<p>Mr. McCabe adds that he "flip-flopped." He says he was
thinking about going to Hollywood, but "it required raising
an enormous amount of money and the prospect of going around
for a year with a tin cup looking for money" wasn't what he
had in mind. "So I started thinking about advertising," he
says.</p>
<p>Mr. McCabe hooked up with Beber Silverstein after casual
conversations with scores of others. Every time a big agency
job opened, his name was invariably mentioned as a
front-runner. "There were very few people I didn't speak to,"
he says. But he says he chose Beber Silverstein partly
because of his aversion to bureaucracies and to agencies that
are financially-driven rather than creatively-driven. Beber
"is a small, regional agency that has great potential that I
can help them realize," he says.</p>
<p>Agency executives say Mr. McCabe could have had his choice
of jobs, considering his reputation. Jay Chiat, a friend and
chairman of Chiat/Day/Mojo, calls him "one of the five best
creative people in advertising."</p>
<p>But Mr. McCabe also must fight a perception of arrogance.
He drew howls of indignation from some in the ad industry,
for example, when he penned a cover story for New York
magazine tearing apart the Dukakis campaign's advertising.
The campaign, he opined, was "perhaps the greatest single
marketing and communications disaster of the 20th century."
The problem, he implied, was basically that Dukakis aides
rejected the ads he suggested.</p>
<p>Mr. McCabe's friends, though, say the reputation for
arrogance is misguided. "He has a strong ego, otherwise he
wouldn't be any good," says Mr. Chiat, who himself has had to
endure accusations of arrogance. But he adds, "I don't think
he's consciously arrogant. He's impetuous and very emotional
about the things he believes in. Anyone who has a point of
view, the first thing they say about the person is they're
arrogant."</p>
<p>Most out-of-town ad agencies have failed when trying to
build up a New York presence, but ad executives say Mr.
McCabe may well have a shot at it. A noncompete agreement he
had with Scali expired more than a year ago, he says, so he
can compete freely with the agency he helped found. Says Mr.
Sloves: "Will business be attracted to him because he's
there? You bet. Is the work going to be terrific? You bet.
But if you ask me is he going to be happy? I don't know."</p>

<p>Ad Notes. . . .</p>
<p>EARNINGS: WCRS Group PLC reported net income for the
fiscal six months ended Dec. 31 of #35 million ($57.2
million), or 10 pence a share. WCRS changed its fiscal year
to June 30 to coincide with that of Carat Holding S.A., a
media-buying network that it acquired late last year in a
restructuring that transformed WCRS from an advertising
company to a media-buying firm. WCRS last reported net income
for the 14 months ended June 30, 1989 of #13.7 million, or 30
pence a share.</p>
<p>COUPON MACHINE: ActMedia, a Darien, Conn., in-store
marketing firm, today will introduce an electronic coupon
machine designed to dispense coupons to shoppers directly at
store shelves. ActMedia says the dispenser, called the
Instant Coupon Machine, will allow consumer-product companies
and others to get coupons to all consumers, not just those
that clip them from papers and magazines. Four retailers,
including Shop Rite and Waldbaums Food Mart chain, signed up
to use the machines. Many manufacturers, including Procter &
Gamble and General Mills, will offer coupons through the
system.</p>
