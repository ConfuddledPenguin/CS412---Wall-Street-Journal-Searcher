	<p class="article-leader">CLEVELAND -- Edgell Communications Inc. named Richard B.
Swank, 58 years old, its new chief executive officer.
   The appointment comes a week after founder Robert L.
Edgell announced his retirement at the age of 68 amid
speculation the highly leveraged magazine publisher and trade
exposition company is having trouble meeting interest
payments on its debt.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Edgell Communications was formed in 1987 when Mr. Edgell
led a $334.1 million leveraged buy-out of the business
publications and school supplies unit of Harcourt Brace
Jovanovich Inc. The buy-out was financed by Kidder, Peabody &
Co., a unit of General Electric Co., which remains the
majority owner of Edgell Communications. To finance the deal,
Kidder Peabody provided a bridge loan that was later
refinanced through the sale of high-yield securities. People
familiar with the company said Edgell has had trouble meeting
the interest payments on those junk bonds due to rising
publishing costs and generally soft advertising markets for
business and professional publications.</p>
<p>Mr. Edgell said in an interview that the company will meet
all of its interest payments this year. "Since forming the
company, it's true our cash flow has been tied up in the debt
structure," he said. "We are looking at restructuring so that
we can go back on the acquisitions trail and build the
company."</p>
<p>Mr. Swank most recently was head of Richard Swank &
Associates, a Redding, Conn., consulting firm. In 1988, he
left Dun & Bradstreet Corp., where he was an executive vice
president largely responsible for trade magazine publishing
and information services.</p>
