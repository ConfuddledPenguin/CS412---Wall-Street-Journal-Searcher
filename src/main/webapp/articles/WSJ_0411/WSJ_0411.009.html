	<p class="article-leader">IRVINE, Calif. -- Gradco Systems Inc. named a new
president, divided its business into separate printer and
copier units, and said it will take a charge against earnings
resulting in a net loss for the fiscal fourth quarter ended
March 31.
   Joe C. Sanchez, 56 years old, a 29-year veteran of Xerox
Corp., was named president and chief operating officer. As
president, Mr. Sanchez succeeds Keith B. Stewart, 50, who
remains chairman and chief executive officer. The post of
chief operating officer is new.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Mr. Sanchez also will serve as president and chief
executive officer of newly created Gradco Printer Systems
Inc., the domestic operating unit under the new structure
that will be responsible for all Gradco's printer products
business world-wide, including engineering, manufacturing and
sales.</p>
<p>Gradco Japan Ltd., 96%-owned by Gradco and 4%-owned by
Japanese investors, will be responsible for all of Gradco's
copier business world-wide. Mark M. Takeuchi, 51, president
of Gradco Japan, was named a corporate director, along with
Mr. Sanchez. As directors, they succeed R. John Thielen,
president of Gradco's Dyna V Corp. unit, and Albert B. Boese,
formerly Gradco's vice president, operations.</p>
<p>Gradco said the charge to fourth quarter earnings stems
primarily from the discontinuance of its domestic
manufacturing operations. The company is in the midst of
transferring all its manufacturing operations to South Korea
and Japan. Gradco said the actual amount of the charge won't
be determined until its year-end audit is completed, and
officials declined to estimate the amount of the
fourth-quarter loss.</p>
<p>In national over-the-counter trading yesterday, Gradco
stock closed at $8 a share, down 25 cents.</p>
<p>Gradco also said it finalized a new $35 million credit
facility with Bank of California N.A. and Mitsubishi Bank
Ltd., to replace a $20 million facility with Union Bank. The
new credit facility will be used for working capital, Gradco
said.</p>
