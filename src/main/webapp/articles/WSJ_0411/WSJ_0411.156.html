	<p class="article-leader">HOLLYWOOD -- Major movie studios, fresh off a record year,
are rapidly gearing up production and say they're desperate
for scripts with lots of action and good plots. Like this
one:
   A nice young boy from Grodno, Poland (now part of the
Soviet Union), lands in New York with ambition and a head for
business. He rises to become the financial mastermind for the
mob in America. Along the way, he has a few misadventures
with the Feds, crooked union bosses, communist
revolutionaries and guys whose idea of a fashion statement is
cement outerwear. He dies rich, powerful and -- unlike many
of his colleagues -- of natural causes in his 80s.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The tale even has the virtue of being true. Meyer Lansky
did it all before he died in 1983.</p>
<p>But getting Mr. Lansky's life onto film has turned into
its own epic saga, offering a graphic reminder that what goes
on behind the cameras can be a lot stranger than what happens
in front of them. The efforts to make a Lansky movie also
raise questions about whether Hollywood's long love affair
with mobsters is confined to the silver screen.</p>
<p>At latest count, there are four competing projects to
shoot Lansky, the movie. Players have included the likes of
MCA Inc., Time Warner Inc.'s HBO unit, actors Michael Douglas
and James Caan, as well as alleged mobsters known as "Jimmy
Blue Eyes" and "The Conductor."</p>
<p>At the center of all this is Martin Bacow (rhymes with
taco). In his 68 years, he has been a boxer, sportscaster,
business consultant, screenwriter, director, producer and
self-professed friend of the working man, specializing in
solving movie-industry labor disputes. "A strike has never
lasted more than two hours after I got involved," Mr. Bacow
once said.</p>
<p>The federal government has been interested in Mr. Bacow's
labor connections. Over the past few years, federal agents
have tailed Mr. Bacow, bugged his phone and even discussed
trying to have an undercover agent invest in his Lansky movie
project, according to wiretap affidavits filed by the Federal
Bureau of Investigation in federal district court in San
Francisco. The documents, filed in 1988 as part of a
labor-racketeering indictment against other people, say the
agency has been investigating whether Mr. Bacow used his
influence to help extort money from movie and TV companies to
ensure labor peace.</p>
<p>"A pack of lies]" shouts Mr. Bacow. He says he has been
assured by friends in government, whom he won't name, that
the investigation into his activities is dead; he also notes
that the two senior lawyers in charge of the investigation
resigned last year. The government declines to comment on the
status of the case.</p>
<p>Like many movie heroes, Mr. Bacow says he is a victim of
fate, which has chosen to cast him into the company of
gangsters and other suspect characters for much of his life.
He says, for example, that his boyhood chums on the streets
of Detroit grew up to become members of the city's
once-notorious Purple Gang.</p>
<p>None of these associations rubbed off, he insists. He
doesn't have any criminal record and says he's not only a
law-abiding citizen, but also a law-abetting one who has
helped the authorities crack cases. "I've had mobsters come
to me to turn themselves in," he says.</p>
<p>Mr. Bacow, who already has some movie-producing credits,
says he has considered doing a Lansky movie for decades, and
in 1973 even got the subject's personal blessing for the
project at a meeting in Florida, where Mr. Lansky lived. "He
knew I would be fair," Mr. Bacow says.</p>
<p>But he didn't begin work on the screenplay until after the
mobster's death. Mr. Bacow says that when word about his
project got around Hollywood, he was besieged by would-be
partners.</p>
<p>One call was from Eugene Giaquinto, then president of
MCA's home-entertainment unit. Mr. Bacow says he tentatively
agreed to sell the home-video and pay-TV rights to MCA for
more than $4 million.</p>
<p>But there also were calls from the mob. One group wanting
a piece of the Lansky action, according to Mr. Bacow and FBI
wiretaps of conversations in 1987, was New York's Genovese
crime family -- whose reputed leaders include Vincent "Jimmy
Blue Eyes" Alo. They even seemed to have their own candidate
for leading man, actor James Caan. Mr. Alo couldn't be
reached for comment.</p>
<p>An attorney for Mr. Caan, who had his best-known roles in
the Godfather movies, says the actor was interested in doing
his own Lansky film and occasionally discussed the matter
with Mr. Alo, who was a neighbor in Florida. The attorney
says Mr. Caan routinely talks to reputed mobsters as part of
his continuing interest in playing gangster roles in movies
and insists the actor wasn't part of any plan to interfere
with Mr. Bacow. A spokesman for Mr. Caan says he isn't
working on a Lansky project at the moment.</p>
<p>According to the FBI wiretap affidavits, Edward "The
Conductor" Sciandra, the alleged underboss of Pennsylvania's
Buffalino crime family, wanted an equity interest in the
Lansky project. His claim seems to have come from his
relationship to MCA's Mr. Giaquinto, whom the FBI suspects of
being Mr. Sciandra's nephew, says one wiretap affidavit. Mr.
Giaquinto didn't return phone calls seeking comment. Mr.
Sciandra denies any ties to organized crime and says any
allegations of wrongdoing are false. He says Mr. Giaquinto is
a "relation" but won't be more specific.</p>
<p>The wiretaps indicate that neither Mr. Bacow nor Mr.
Giaquinto appreciated these mob overtures. And the MCA
executive seems to have called on other family ties for
protection.</p>
<p>"Giaquinto said he had John Gotti {the reputed head of New
York's Gambino family} send someone out and they were
knocking heads against the wall," says one FBI affidavit.
MCA, parent of Universal Pictures, suspended and later fired
Mr. Giaquinto after the wiretaps became public in late 1988.
Mr. Gotti couldn't be reached for comment.</p>
<p>Mr. Bacow insists that mobsters don't have any piece of
his movie project. He says he has a completed script and
financial backers -- "all very legitimate people," he adds --
and he is talking to a studio about a possible distribution
deal for the film. He declines to identify the studio or his
backers.</p>
<p>He also has competition. Stonebridge Entertainment Inc.,
partly owned by Michael Douglas, and Sony Corp.'s Columbia
Pictures unit say they jointly have a Lansky movie "in
development" -- a popular Hollywood term meaning that filming
could start anywhere from soon to shortly after the end of
life as we know it. They decline to comment further.</p>
<p>Linda Post, a screenwriter in Santa Monica, Calif., says
she stumbled across another Lansky project recently when she
requested an interview with Mr. Lansky's daughter. She
received a call back from the daughter's producer, who said
they had their own movie in the works. She won't name the
producer.</p>
<p>Ms. Post's call was part of research on a Lansky
screenplay she is writing for HBO. She also called her old
friend Lowell Bergman, a veteran producer for CBS's "60
Minutes," seeking advice and contacts. They chatted
occasionally after that, and Mr. Bergman had dinner one night
with the project's producer, Lois Luger.</p>
<p>Though he offered his help gratis, Mr. Bergman says he was
eventually promised a $5,000 "honorarium" if the movie gets
made. "This is the movie business," says Ms. Post. "You try
to get money for your friends."</p>
<p>But Mr. Bergman then produced a "60 Minutes" segment
entitled "Hollywood and the Mob," part of which recounted the
Mafia tug of war over Mr. Bacow's project. "Bergman was
trying to torpedo my project to help his own," says Mr.
Bacow. Mr. Bergman and his boss, "60 Minutes" chief Don
Hewitt, categorically deny the charge. Mr. Bergman adds that
he has decided against taking any honorarium.</p>
