	<p class="article-leader">After months of intense wrangling, Lockheed Corp.'s board
won handily its proxy battle against Dallas investor Harold
Simmons for control of the nation's sixth largest defense
contractor, according to preliminary counts released by both
sides.
   But a slate of shareholder initiatives, at which
management initially balked, also was approved. These were
pushed heavily by Mr. Simmons, especially in the latter
stages of the proxy fight when he began to focus more on the
theme of corporate governance and somewhat less on Lockheed's
disappointing economic performance.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The results, which generally had been expected, signaled
that Lockheed's holders are willing to give Chairman Daniel
Tellep more time to rejuvenate the company's balance sheet.
But, by raising the shibboleth of shareholder rights, large
portfolio managers in particular have made it clear that they
want more of a say in how such a turnaround might be
achieved.</p>
<p>The divulging of the vote effectively ended one of the
year's most bitter corporate brawls, which has been watched
with interest from Wall Street to Capitol Hill. Calabasas,
Calif.-based Lockheed spent some $8 million fending off Mr.
Simmons's advances. Mr. Simmons's side said it spent
considerably more than $6 million. He had hoped to usher in
an era in which the proxy fight would replace the leveraged
buy-out as the primary way of seizing a target.</p>
<p>Lockheed said its nominees to the board, all of them
incumbents, won 62% of the more than 52 million shares voted
in the contest. Houston-based NL Industries Inc., under whose
aegis Mr. Simmons controls his 18.94% stake in Lockheed, put
the tally at 58% to 61%.</p>
<p>In the meantime, it's certain that Mr. Simmons will still
be lurking at Lockheed's door, prompting Mr. Tellep to look
for ways to enhance shareholder value. "Just having him there
will make sure Lockheed tries to improve things," said DeWitt
Bowman, chief investment officer for California Public
Employees Retirement System, a $56 billion fund that openly
voted its Lockheed shares for Mr. Simmons.</p>
<p>"Management is between a rock and a hard place," added
Gary Reich, Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. aerospace analyst,
who last week raised his rating on Lockheed's stock because
of the relentless pressure he anticipates Mr. Simmons will
apply. "If they don't do something fast, Simmons will just be
back. A spurned suitor is a good motivator."</p>
<p>Indeed, there's little doubt that Mr. Simmons feels
spurned. Although the investor's camp said it didn't know yet
whether it would challenge the proxy results -- it has about
10 people examining them now -- Mr. Simmons indicated in an
interview yesterday that he is considering taking legal
action, possibly this week, challenging the role of
Lockheed's Employee Stock Ownership Plan. The plan, created a
year ago, owns 18.91% of Lockheed's 63.2 million shares
outstanding and voted 90% in favor of management's directors.</p>
<p>Because of the ESOP's voting clout and because
institutions are hesitant to vote against management unless
they are convinced it will lose, Mr. Simmons contended that
the presence and power of the ESOP stacked the vote against
him. "If management can, with the stroke of a pen, create 20%
of the vote and put it in their pocket, it makes a mockery of
corporate democracy," said Mr. Simmons.</p>
<p>In fact, the investor said it was just a few institutions
that apparently made the difference in the director vote and
that he is convinced he would have won had the ESOP not
existed. In addition, he said, his group would have fared
better if Lockheed hadn't moved up its annual meeting date by
five weeks. "We didn't have time to conduct a full campaign,"
Mr. Simmons said.</p>
<p>Mr. Tellep was traveling yesterday and unavailable for
comment. But an adviser close to Lockheed discounted Mr.
Simmons's assertions about the ESOP. "He would have to throw
out the entire ESOP, and then maybe he would have a narrow
victory," the adviser said. "The fact is that outside of his
own stake, Simmons got only about 12% of the total
outstanding shares.</p>
<p>"The institutions clearly want to see an improved
performance by Lockheed," he added. "But they think Tellep is
the guy to do it."</p>
<p>In the 16 months since becoming chief executive officer,
Mr. Tellep has maintained that Lockheed is a fundamentally
sound company, adding that he is prepared to take tough
actions and pare underperforming assets where warranted. Just
yesterday, for instance, Lockheed confirmed it will lay off
500 white-collar employees from its shrinking Marietta, Ga.,
plant. The company yesterday also completed the sale of its
Metier Inc. software unit to Lucas Industries PLC of
Birmingham, England. Terms weren't disclosed.</p>
<p>In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange,
Lockheed closed at $37.875 a share, up 37.5 cents.</p>
<p>Further, Mr. Tellep has taken numerous steps to appease
his institutional holders, which collectively own about 45%
of Lockheed shares. For instance, in the waning days of what
appeared to have emerged as a close campaign for the
company's 14 director seats, he promised to appoint as many
as three additional directors from the institutions' ranks.</p>
<p>The chairman also conceded on the eve of Lockheed's annual
meeting, held a fortnight ago, to support confidential
shareholder voting and to voluntarily exempt Lockheed from
the Delaware anti-takeover law. Yesterday -- when it was
estimated that shareholders had backed the confidential
voting proposal 61% to 39% and had chosen to opt out of the
Delaware statute 62% to 38% -- Mr. Tellep reiterated in a
statement his commitment to carry out "the will of the
shareholders" on those matters.</p>
<p>There remains one issue, however, on which Mr. Tellep is
less willing to bend: the poison pill, or preferred-share
purchase rights plan, which discourages a hostile suitor from
buying more than 20% of the company's stock by making a
takeover prohibitively expensive. Although the board will
reassess its position on the poison-pill question in the wake
of a 57% to 43% vote by shareholders to rescind the plan, Mr.
Tellep said he is "concerned at the possible vulnerability of
the company to coercive and unfair takeover tactics" if the
measure were completely canceled.</p>
<p>Yesterday's disclosure on the vote effectively makes moot
a meeting scheduled for Monday, when the results will be
formally recorded. That same day, Mr. Simmons said, he hopes
to meet with Mr. Tellep, at the Lockheed chief's invitation,
to discuss the shareholder-rights initiatives, the ESOP,
directorships and whether Lockheed needs to focus more
attention on its return on investment.</p>
