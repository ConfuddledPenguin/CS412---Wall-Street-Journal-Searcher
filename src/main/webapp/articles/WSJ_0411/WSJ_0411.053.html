	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Yields on certificates of deposit at major
banks and brokerage firms were largely unchanged in the week
ended Monday.
   Average yields on small-denomination CDs, which typically
require minimum deposits of $10,000 or less, rose just
slightly, according to Banxquote Money Markets, an
information service based here. The average yield on a
one-year consumer CD was 7.96%, up from 7.93%, while
five-year consumer CDs offered an average 8.17%, compared
with 8.15% last week.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The only significant move in the latest week was a jump in
the average yield on six-month CDs at California banks to
8.19%, from 7.89%. The change reflects increases in yields
for six-month CDs offered by Security Pacific National Bank
and Bank of America, which rose to 8.33% and 8.35%, from
7.87% and 7.90%, respectively. This compares with a national
average of 7.79%.</p>
<p>These increases are "probably tied to local competitive
factors, such as April rollovers and the tax-filing season,"
said Norberto Mehl, chairman of Banxquote. "It has nothing to
due with interest rates in general or other economic trends."</p>
<p>Banxquote usually surveys 18 big banks each Tuesday; the
survey was done Monday this week because of the Passover
holiday.</p>
<p>Average yields on CDs sold by leading broker-dealers fell
slightly, with the exception of one-year CDs, which rose one
hundredth of a percentage point, to 8.20%.</p>
<p>Also down slightly were average yields on most
large-denomination CDs, which typically require minimum
deposits of $90,000 or more.</p>
