	<p class="article-leader">QUEBEC CITY -- Quebec Superior Court ruled that Canada's
Competition Tribunal, which reviews federal government
antitrust decisions, is unconstitutional.
   In a case involving a Quebec animal-rendering concern,
Judge Jacques Philippon ruled that the federal Competition
Tribunal is unconstitutional because it has the powers of a
court but doesn't have "the essential attributes of
{judicial} independence."</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The decision's immediate impact is unclear. A spokesman
for the Competition Tribunal said he wasn't aware of the
court decision.</p>
<p>But if the decision is upheld on any eventual appeal, it
could have a farreaching effect. The Competition Tribunal
reviews and can alter decisions of the Canadian Bureau of
Competition Policy, the federal government antitrust agency.</p>
<p>The judge said the powers of the tribunal "largely exceed
a purely administrative role and put it in the category of a
court with wide powers." He said that because the tribunal
lacks the judicial independence of a court, it therefore
violated the animal-rendering concern's right of association
and right to be heard by an independent and impartial
tribunal.</p>
<p>Alex Couture Inc., an animal-rendering concern based here
with annual sales of 100 million Canadian dollars (US$86
million), acquired a rendering concern in Montreal in 1987.
The Canadian Bureau of Competition Policy ordered Alex
Couture to dispose of the newly acquired company and
submitted its decision to the Competition Tribunal. Alex
Couture then launched its court challenge.</p>
