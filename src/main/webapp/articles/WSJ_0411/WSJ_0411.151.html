	<p class="article-leader">Newell Co. said it owns a 5.6% stake in Lancaster Colony
Corp. and may try to take control of the Columbus, Ohio-based
specialty food, glassware and auto accessories company.
   Newell, a home-products concern in Freeport, Ill., said it
purchased the 675,000 shares for $20.47 a share, or $13.8
million.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission,
Newell said it might seek representation on Lancaster
Colony's board, propose a merger, or seek control of the
company.</p>
<p>Lancaster Colony, makers of products ranging from pasta
and salad dressing to car-floor mats and gun racks, said it
would fight any takeover attempt.</p>
<p>John B. Gerlach, president of Lancaster Colony, said
Newell officials called him Monday to request a meeting. But
"we're not the least bit interested in talking," he said.</p>
<p>Son of the company founder, Mr. Gerlach said he's the
largest shareholder, owning about 30% of Lancaster Colony's
11.8 million shares outstanding.</p>
<p>Newell and its Anchor Hocking Corp. subsidiary have done
business with Lancaster. In 1986, Newell acquired Lancaster's
aluminum cookware division.</p>
