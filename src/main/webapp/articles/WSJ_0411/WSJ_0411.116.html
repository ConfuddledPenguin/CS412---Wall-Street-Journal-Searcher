	<p class="article-leader">Bechtel Group Inc. said it entered a contract with the
Hong Kong government to manage a $16 billion airport
construction project, one of the largest such projects ever
undertaken.
   The San Francisco closely held engineering and
construction company said the project will take seven years
to complete. It entails building a new airport, a suspension
bridge that would be the longest in the world, a rapid
transit system and a highway to China, among other things.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Bechtel didn't disclose exactly how much it stands to earn
from the project. It said the Hong Kong government hopes to
fund half the project through private funds.</p>
<p>Bechtel's last project of similar size was the
construction of the city of Jubail in Saudi Arabia, a $20
billion project. The city is still under construction.</p>
<p>The Hong Kong project is the second major transaction
Bechtel has announced in a week. Last week, Bechtel signed an
agreement with the Soviet Union to do a preliminary study on
the feasibility of converting a research center near Moscow
into a technology center similar to California's Silicon
Valley.</p>
