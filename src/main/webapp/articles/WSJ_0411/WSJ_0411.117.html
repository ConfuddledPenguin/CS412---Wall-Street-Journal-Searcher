	<p class="article-leader">TELEDYNE Inc. (Los Angeles) -- Moody's Investors Service
Inc. lowered its ratings on about $34 million of debt of
Teledyne, reflecting the impact of the planned spinoff of the
company's insurance and finance subsidiaries and federal
defense budget cutbacks. Moody's lowered the rating on
Teledyne's senior debt to Baa-3 from Baa-2, and on
subordinated debt to Ba-1 from Baa-3. The rating concern
cited Teledyne's "reduced financial measurements" that will
result from the planned spinoff of the insurance and finance
subsidiaries into a new company called Unitrin Inc. The new
ratings also consider "some unpredictability of cash flow
from the defense sector because of Department of Defense
budgetary constraints," Moody's said. Moody's noted, however,
"the broad diversity of Teledyne's manufacturing businesses
that should be able to generate sufficient earnings and cash
flow to service the higher leverage of Teledyne that remains
after the spinoff." In addition to insurance and finance,
Teledyne has interests in aviation, electronics, specialty
metals and industrial businesses. A Teledyne spokesman said
the rating action "really is no surprise." In New York Stock
Exchange trading yesterday, Teledyne rose $1.125 a share to
close at $71.375.</p>
