	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- The Resolution Funding Corp. flopped in its
second attempt to sell 40-year bonds, a sign that investors
aren't ready for bonds that have extra-long maturities.
   Refcorp, a new government agency created to rescue the
nation's troubled thrift industry, auctioned $3.5 billion of
the so-called bailout bonds yesterday.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The sale went badly despite an average yield of 8.89%,
which was higher than some analysts had expected and 1/3
percentage point higher than the yield on the Treasury's
benchmark 30-year bond.</p>
<p>Although the entire issue was sold, bidding was
lackluster. One indication of weak demand was the "tail," or
the difference between the average yield and the highest bid
accepted at the auction. Because there wasn't enough demand
at the average yield, the Treasury was forced to accept bids
as high as 8.94% to complete the auction.</p>
<p>Shortly after the auction ended, dealers who bought the
bonds were forced to cut prices in an attempt to attract
buyers. As prices slid, the average yield on the 40-year
bonds surged as high as 8.92%.</p>
<p>"This was a rerun of the last auction. It was pretty bad,"
said James Capra, a senior vice president at Shearson Lehman
Government Securities Inc. The previous auction, which took
place in January, marked the first time the government sold
40-year bonds since the 1950s. That auction was considered a
disaster.</p>
<p>The results suggest that "either there's not much demand
for 40-year bonds or there's not much demand for Refcorp
bonds," said John R. Burrus, manager of trading at CRT
Government Securities Ltd.</p>
<p>Many dealers admitted yesterday that they may have
overestimated the appeal of 40-year bonds and blamed
themselves for the poor results.</p>
<p>The Treasury, however, said it was pleased with the
auction because it believes the government saved money by
issuing a 40-year bond rather than a traditional 30-year
bond. But Treasury officials did admit that there are
problems with the 40-year bond auctions.</p>
<p>"To the extent there doesn't seem to be the investor
demand the Street had hoped for, clearly, that's a
disappointment," said Michael Basham, deputy assistant
secretary of federal finance at the Treasury. He said no
decision has been made on whether to issue more 40-year
bonds.</p>
<p>Lawrence N. Leuzzi, a managing director at S.G. Warburg
Securities & Co., said some investors had concerns about
Refcorp itself. Refcorp bonds don't actually carry a
government guarantee, although interest payments are
guaranteed by the Treasury and principal payments are secured
by Treasury securities. Still, "the Refcorp name is suffering
from uncertainty about how much the savings-and-loan bailout
will cost," he said.</p>
<p>The disappointment in the auction spilled over onto the
broader bond market, sending prices of most bonds moderately
lower late in the day. The benchmark 30-year Treasury fell
about 1/2 point, or about $5 for a bond with a $1,000 face
amount.</p>
<p>Dealers had hoped to sell 40-year bonds to insurance
companies, pension funds and other large institutional
investors that need extra-long maturities to match future
claims. Another group of buyers was expected to consist of
professional traders eager for another vehicle to bet on
swings in interest rates.</p>
<p>Zane Brown, executive vice president at Equitable Capital
Management, said life insurance companies, commercial banks
and thrifts aren't looking to extend their portfolios to
include 40-year bonds. Instead, he said, most are looking to
shorten the average maturity in their portfolios.</p>
<p>"Really, the only institutions that are left that might
want a 40-year bond are pension funds, and they have plenty
of opportunity to buy 30-year bonds," he said.</p>
<p>"I'm not sure that 40-years have a home" in the portfolio
of most institutional investors, said Mr. Brown. He said the
bonds are better when "stripped" into zero-coupon bonds that
have shorter maturities. Those bonds, he said, could then be
sold to individual investors for retirement and
college-education accounts.</p>
<p>Strips are created when dealers separate the semiannual
interest payments from the principal portion of the bond and
sell the pieces separately. They also are separated into
shorter maturity classes. The principal-only portion, called
a zero-coupon bond, is sold at a deep discount from its face
value and is considered one of the most volatile securities.
Dealers said a 40-year zero might sell for as little as $35
for a bond with a $1,000 face amount.</p>
<p>Although half of the previous 40-year bond offering was
stripped, dealers said the appetite for strips seemed light
at yesterday's sale. That's partly because of the flat yield
curve. Some analysts say yields on the 40-year bonds may not
be high enough relative to shorter-term bonds to make the
bonds appealing.</p>
<p>Treasury, Agency Securities</p>
<p>The benchmark 30-year Treasury bond ended at a price of 98
30/32 to yield 8.59%, compared with 99 11/32 to yield 8.55%
on Monday.</p>
<p>Short-term rates were little changed.</p>
<p>Despite the poor showing at the Refcorp bond sale,
analysts said they expect today's $7.5 billion sale of new
seven-year Treasury notes to go smoothly.</p>
<p>In when-issued activity late yesterday, the new seven-year
notes were trading at 8.65%, up from a yield of 8.62% Monday
and 8.59% Friday.</p>
<p>Here are details of Refcorp's 40-year bond auction
yesterday:</p>
<p>Rates are determined by the difference between the
purchase price and face value. Thus, higher bidding narrows
the investor's return while lower bidding widens it.</p>
<p>Applications ............................  $8.90 billion</p>
<p>Accepted bids ...........................  $3.50 billion</p>
<p>Accepted at low price ...................            10%</p>
<p>Accepted noncompetitively ...............   $126 million</p>
<p>Average price (Rate) ....................  99.834 (8.89%)</p>
<p>High price (Rate) ....................... 100.162 (8.86%)</p>
<p>Low price (Rate) ........................  99.293 (8.94%)</p>
<p>Interest rate ...........................          8 7/8%</p>
<p>The bonds are dated April 17 and mature April 15, 2030.</p>
<p>Corporate Issues</p>
<p>News developments helped drive the junk bond market
yesterday, slamming some high-yield issues and buoying
others.</p>
<p>Among the notable losers of the day were junk bonds of
Ames Department Stores Inc., which plunged nine points on a
blizzard of news about the company's distressed financial
condition.</p>
<p>By contrast, high-yield bonds of Owens-Illinois Inc.
climbed by more than a point on news that insurance companies
are liable for $960 million in damage and injury claims
against Owens Illinois. The claims stem from the use of the
company's asbestos-containing products.</p>
<p>High-yield traders said Ames Department Stores' 13% senior
subordinated reset notes, due in 1999, traded at 46, down
nine points from Monday's closing price. At one point during
the session, bids for the issue fell as low as 42.</p>
<p>The Rocky Hill, Conn.-based retailer said it is estimating
a loss of $228 million for fiscal 1990 and is negotiating
with its banks for a new credit agreement.</p>
<p>"The operating loss for the year resulted primarily from
substantially lower-than-anticipated sales and gross margins
in the former Zayre stores," said Ames's chief executive
officer, Peter Hollis.</p>
<p>In addition, the company said it has retained Shearson
Lehman Hutton Inc. and Wertheim, Schroder & Co. "to assist
the company in connection with a restructuring which will
include a capital infusion."</p>
<p>In the broader high-yield market, junk bonds or
speculative-grade securities with low credit ratings or no
credit ratings, finished unchanged.</p>
<p>In the investment-grade corporate debt market, activity
was also muted with corporate issues ending the session
unchanged.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, junk bonds of Interco Inc. were little changed
on news that the furniture manufacturer reported a loss from
continuing operations of $17.9 million for the fourth
quarter. In the year-earlier period, the company had a loss
from continuing operations of $42.2 million.</p>
<p>Market participants said the results were widely
anticipated. Interco's 13 3/4% securities finished at 34 1/2,
while its zero-coupon bonds were unchanged at 6 1/2.</p>
<p>Mortgage-Backed Securities</p>
<p>Mortgage securities ended 4/32 to 7/32 point lower on a
late sell-off following disappointing results of the Refcorp
bond sale.</p>
<p>Market attention was focused on a scarcity of Federal
National Mortgage Association 9 1/2% securities ahead of the
regular April settlement Monday.</p>
<p>The shortage reflects the heavy use of such securities as
collateral for real estate mortgage investment conduits that
settle later this month. There are about $2.4 billion of
these Fannie Mae Remics settling, and production of 9 1/2%
securities was only about $1.9 billion last month.</p>
<p>In the pass-through market, Ginnie Mae 9% securities for
April delivery ended at 95 27/32, down 5/32; 9 1/2%
securities were at 98 4/32, down 7/32; 10% securities were at
100 17/32, down 4/32; and Fannie Mae 9 1/2% securities were
at 98 14/32, down 4/32.</p>
<p>The Ginnie Mae 9% issue was yielding 9.73% to a 12-year
average life assumption, as the spread above the Treasury
10-year note narrowed 0.03 percentage point to 1.11.</p>
<p>Municipals</p>
<p>Underwriting officials reported that the account is closed
on $500 million of California various purpose general
obligation bonds sold via competitive bid yesterday.</p>
<p>The California issue, won by a Bank of America NT&SA
group, was the largest single issue ever sold by the state.
The group's winning bid of 6.845% was about 0.02 percentage
point lower than the only competing bid, offered by a Chase
Securities Inc. group.</p>
<p>Looking ahead on the calendar, $119 million of Baltimore
County, Md., consolidated public improvement bonds will be
sold via competitive bid today.</p>
<p>In secondary market trading, municipal bonds ended
unchanged to 1/8 point lower in listless dealings. The New
Jersey Turnpike Authority's 7.20% issue of 2018 was unchanged
at 97 3/8 bid to yield 7.40%.</p>
<p>Foreign Bonds</p>
<p>Major foreign government bonds ended lower in quiet
trading.</p>
<p>In Britain, analysts said investors sold bonds because of
concerns that inflation is accelerating. Inflation fears were
rekindled by Monday's news that manufactured goods prices in
March were higher than expected.</p>
<p>Britain's benchmark 11 3/4% Treasury bond due 2003/2007
fell 15/32 to 98 1/32 to yield 12.01%, while the 12% notes
due 1995 were down 3/8 to 96 22/32 to yield 12.93%.</p>
<p>Japanese government bonds continued to track the value of
the yen, which ended lower again against the dollar. The
benchmark 10-year bond fell 0.30 point to 86.51 to yield
7.25%.</p>
