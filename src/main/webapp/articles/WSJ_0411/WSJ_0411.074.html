	<p class="article-leader">"Alcohol and Innocent Victims" by Morris E. Chafetz
(editorial page, March 5) is a perfect example of what our
forefathers meant when they cautioned that, in a free
society, every right has a concomitant responsibility.
   Freedom of speech is granted to everyone in the U.S.
Within legal bounds, anybody can say almost anything. The
responsibility this places on all of us is to become educated
consumers of the truth and not believe everything we read or
hear.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Dr. Chafetz is head of an organization that, the Journal
points out, is partially funded by the alcoholic-beverage
industry. He contends that the American public has grossly
overstated the concern with alcohol and its harmful effects.
Teens, according to Dr. Chafetz, have been "victimized" by
defining "risky experiments with alcohol" as "problem
drinking." Furthermore, he says, our concerns about
adolescent drinking, fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) and
children of alcoholics have created "new groups of victims by
overestimating alcohol's dangers."</p>
<p>According to the Department of Health and Human Services:</p>
<p>-- Eighteen million American adults are either alcoholics
or have alcohol-abuse problems.</p>
<p>-- An estimated 4.6 million adolescents annually (three
out of every 10) have alcohol problems.</p>
<p>-- Nearly nine out of 10 teen-age automobile accidents
involve alcohol.</p>
<p>-- Fetal alcohol syndrome is one of the top three causes
of birth defects and is the only one that's preventable.</p>
<p>-- The annual cost to the country of alcohol abuse and
alcoholism is about $136 billion and is predicted to rise to
$150 billion by 1995.</p>

<p>Dr. Chafetz implies by his comparisons with European
drinking habits that American culture is unsophisticated in
its attitude toward alcohol. He calls it "puritanical
ambivalence."</p>
<p>Supposedly our legal age restrictions on the sale and use
of alcohol cause more problems than if we had a laissez-faire
approach like that of Italy, France or Portugal. Dr. Chafetz
argues that we adopt the European approach and let our kids
drink at home with their parents. He even makes the
outrageous statement that "alcoholism is practically nil in
Italy."</p>
<p>Is that true? Absolutely not. According to the
internationally recognized Addiction Research Foundation,
per-capita alcohol consumption by Dr. Chafetz's favorite
groups significantly exceeds that of Americans by 36% in
Portugal, 50% in Italy and 94% in France. And deaths from
liver cirrhosis run 253% higher for the Portuguese, 259%
higher for the Italians and 216% higher for the French than
they do for Americans.</p>
<p>This correlation should give some pause for thought.
Alcohol is a dangerous drug. Drinking too much of it can kill
you. Despite all our "puritanical ambivalence," it seems that
Americans are not, as Dr. Chafetz concludes, overestimating
alcohol's dangers.</p>

<p>The death rate from cirrhosis (an accurate measure of
alcohol's effect on health) in Italy is one of the highest in
the world, 32.1 per 100,000. Portugal's is 25.6. "Ambivalent"
U.S. has a rate of 11.6, about a third of Italy's. Israel has
a cirrhosis rate of 7.1. The reason for Israel's very low
rate is not the Jewish attitude toward drinking but the small
amount of alcohol consumed by Jews. The result of Americans
learning to drink like Jews would be to reduce our
consumption, and our problems, by two-thirds.</p>

<p>---</p>
<p>Dr. Chafetz's assertion that "we do not need to create new
groups of victims by overestimating alcohol's dangers" --
bolstered by a highly biased selection of statistics and
generalizations -- blindly ignores the fact that the
alcoholic-beverage industry has already victimized these
groups through the heavy target marketing of its product to
women and to young people of both sexes.</p>
<p>The alcohol-beverage industry spends $2 billion a year
advertising and promoting its products. That's about 20% of
the national budget of Portugal, where Dr. Chafetz claims
that alcohol problems are the exception.</p>
<p>In 1987, the American Automobile Foundation for Traffic
Safety estimated that between the ages of two and 18,
American children see roughly 100,000 TV commercials for
beer, most of which associate the beverage with fun,
happiness and success, and serve it up with sexual innuendo
as a reward for a job well done. None of them mention that
alcohol-related problems are the No. 1 cause of death for
people ages 15 through 24.</p>
<p>The entertainment medium compounds this barrage by
glorifying alcohol in movies with enormous youth appeal such
as "Cocktail" starring Tom Cruise, one of the nation's top
box-office attractions. Not surprisingly, the film contains a
product placement for Budweiser and Mr. Cruise's charisma
rubs off on his role as a bartender as seductively as it does
a jetfighter pilot.</p>
<p>While the alcoholic-beverage industry disingenuously
continues to deny that it targets the young -- despite such
spring-break promotions as Miller Brewing's now infamous
"Beachin' Times" -- it positively crows about its success
with women. Increasing use of alcohol among this group would
suggest that the psyches of young American women are more
frequently under the influence of advertising than they are
victimized by advocacy groups that prefer warning labels to
alcohol-related birth defects.</p>

<p>There are few sure bets in life, but if you don't drink,
you're not likely to have a baby with FAS or get thrown in
the slammer for driving under the influence of alcohol. It is
hoped Dr. Chafetz would not argue that.</p>
<p>Those in the liquor industry face the same
diminishing-demand curve as the tobacco industry and they're
worried about their market. But reams of statistical data and
fancy resumes simply will not erase the very real human
horror of FAS and all the other effects of alcohol
intoxication.</p>

<p>---</p>
<p>I am particularly appalled by Dr. Chafetz's cavalier
dismissal of the problems of adult children of alcoholics
(ACAs). The biggest problem ACAs face in life is not the
possibility of becoming alcoholics themselves. Their biggest
problems are emotional in nature -- they take on the guilts,
fears and shame of the alcoholic and demonstrate the same
self-destructive behavior their alcoholic parents display.
Tens of millions of American lives have been crippled or
destroyed by the problem drinking of their loved ones. Dr.
Chafetz's earlier tenure at the helm of an alcohol-abuse
foundation surely should have brought that point home to him.</p>
<p>He argues that even mentioning ACA issues is dangerous and
stigmatizing to the ACAs. Nonsense. The only way to break
through an ACA's denial that the problem drinking of another
has deeply affected his or her life is through knowledge of
the disease of alcoholism as it affects the drinker's loved
ones. Would Dr. Chafetz really have us return to the dark
ages of alcohol abuse, when ACAs routinely became as sick as
the alcoholics?</p>
<p>He then adds that no research exists showing that ACA
disorders are different from those disorders suffered by
children of other dysfunctional families. This misses the
point entirely. Surely Dr. Chafetz knows that the
breakthrough revelation of ACA research is that ACAs in fact
suffer the exact same disorders as do children of other
dysfunctional families. ACAs often cannot develop intimate
relationships, trust others, understand or speak their
feelings, or avoid other psychological disorders. Knowledge
of these facts is the first step on an ACA's road to
recovery. Yet Dr. Chafetz prescribes denial.</p>

<p>Why did the Journal point out that the Health Education
Foundation receives some of its funding from "the alcoholic
beverage industry"? Is this your policy, or was this a
special case?</p>
<p>You may or may not care to know that wine, beer and
spirits are separate; there is no "alcoholic beverage
industry."</p>
