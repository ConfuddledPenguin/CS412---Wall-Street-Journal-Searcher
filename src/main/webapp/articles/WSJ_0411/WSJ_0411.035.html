	<p class="article-leader">Health researchers have come up with new evidence that
stress on the job may make you sick.
   Men who hold jobs with high demands over which they have
little control are three times more likely to suffer from
high blood pressure than men who don't, the researchers
report. These workers are also more likely to sustain
physical changes to the heart that over time could lead to
heart disease.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The study is the first to link job strain and high blood
pressure, according to Peter L. Schnall, the lead author, who
is assistant professor of medicine at New York
Hospital-Cornell Medical College, New York. While it doesn't
prove that job stress causes high blood pressure, "it opens
the door for trying to understand" the relationship between
the two, and that could have profound consequences for the
work force -- from the factory floor to the executive suite.</p>
<p>"The study suggests that what's critical is the amount of
control you have when faced with a challenging situation,"
Dr. Schnall says. "If that's correct, one of the things we
could do would be to enhance worker control and participation
on the job."</p>
<p>Indeed, it suggests that redesigning jobs to relieve
strain could improve the health of a company's work force and
reduce health costs, among other things. Conversely, failing
to mitigate stress's impact could provoke labor problems or
increase workers compensation claims.</p>
<p>Further study is required, however, before such definitive
conclusions can be made, Dr. Schnall says. The current study
is published in today's Journal of the American Medical
Association.</p>
<p>Previous studies have linked job strain to coronary heart
disease, Dr. Schnall says. While the relationship between
stress and high blood pressure has long been suspected, it
hasn't been established, in part, the researchers speculate,
because of difficulty in developing reliable means of
determining blood pressure levels and evaluating stress.</p>
<p>The subjects of the study wore monitors during one 24-hour
period to record blood pressure at 15-minute intervals during
waking hours and every 30 minutes at night. Taking frequent
readings during a person's normal activities yields more
reliable measurements than traditional readings in a clinic,
the researchers said.</p>
<p>In addition, the study defines job strain in terms of both
psychological demands -- excessive work, conflicting demands,
insufficient time to work -- and worker control and
discretion over job decisions.</p>
<p>"Telling us you work very fast or hard wasn't associated
with rise of blood pressure," Dr. Schnall says, nor was lack
of job freedom. "Only those folks who told us both things
were happening at the same time were having {blood pressure}
problems," he says.</p>
<p>The researchers studied 215 men from 30 to 60 years old at
seven worksites in New York City. They ranged from clerical
workers to executives at a newspaper typography department, a
federal health agency, a brokerage house, a private hospital,
a sanitation collection and repair facility and a department
store warehouse. They were selected from 2,556 potential
subjects.</p>
<p>Of the 215, 87 had diastolic blood pressure -- the lower
pressure, measured between contractions of the heart --
between 85 and 105 and were considered hypertensive. The
other 128 men had normal blood pressure and were considered
controls. Women weren't included in the study because their
response to job strain could be different and the cost of
recruiting enough subjects for reliable data would have been
too high, Dr. Schnall said. The research team is doing
additional studies that include women, he added.</p>
<p>Among other findings:</p>
<p>-- Men aged 30 to 40 with high blood pressure had
significantly thicker heart muscle than those in the control
group, an indication of the additional work required of the
heart in hypertensive people. While none were at immediate
risk of heart disease, Dr. Schnall said, thicker than normal
heart muscle is considered an important predictor of heart
disease and thus can lead to later trouble if blood pressure
isn't controlled.</p>
<p>-- Risk of developing job-related hypertension increases
with age. Men between 51 and 60 in high-strain jobs were 5.2
times more likely to have high blood pressure than those in
the control group, while those between 41 and 50 were two and
a half times as likely to have hypertension.</p>
<p>-- As expected, age, weight and regular consumption of
alcohol were linked to high blood pressure. Researchers
adjusted their data for these and several other factors in
establishing the correlation between job stress and
hypertension.</p>
