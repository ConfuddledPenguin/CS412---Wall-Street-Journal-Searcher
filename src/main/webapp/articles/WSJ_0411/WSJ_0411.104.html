	<p class="article-leader">TAIPEI, Taiwan -- The Central Bank announced that it will
appropriate a part of Taiwan's foreign exchange reserves to
refinance Taiwanese businesses that plan to invest or seek
mergers and acquisitions overseas.
   The move is aimed at using Taiwan's approximately $73
billion in local foreign exchange reserves to expand Taiwan's
economic base and stimulate further development, Yu Chen, the
Central Bank's deputy governor, said at a news conference. He
said the move might trigger short-term capital outflow, but
in the longer term, earnings from overseas investment are
likely to extend Taiwan's economic strength.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Those eligible for the loans include companies involved in
natural resource development, high technology, anti-pollution
technology, and management training, he said. The Bank of
Communications, Export-Import Bank of the Republic of China,
International Commercial Bank of China and the China
Development Corp. are the four banks designated to issue the
loans.</p>
