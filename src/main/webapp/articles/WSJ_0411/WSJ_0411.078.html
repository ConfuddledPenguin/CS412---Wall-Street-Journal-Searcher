	<p class="article-leader">A private arbitration judge in Chicago ordered Amgen Inc.
and Ortho Pharmaceutical Corp. to "negotiate quickly and in
good faith" so that Ortho can begin marketing an anti-anemia
drug to patients in the early stages of kidney disease.
   The binding order doesn't appear to resolve much in a
long-running dispute between Amgen and Ortho over terms of a
1985 agreement under which Ortho has certain rights to market
erythropoietin, or EPO, and two other drugs. Ortho is a unit
of Johnson & Johnson.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"It's something of a cop out; the judge is ordering the
parties to work this out or he will work it out for them,"
said Stuart Weisbrod, a biotechnology analyst at
Prudential-Bache Securities Corp. "It's a jump ball," said
analyst Peter Drake at Vector Securities International Inc.
in Chicago.</p>
<p>The 1985 agreement granted Ortho the right to market EPO
for all therapeutic uses other than kidney dialysis patients
in the U.S. Analysts believe that Amgen has tried to block
Ortho from receiving regulatory approval to sell the drug to
so-called "pre-dialysis" patients because of concerns that
Ortho might siphon off dialysis market sales.</p>
<p>A decision on damages sought by Amgen and Ortho against
each other was delayed until after other issues involving EPO
and the other two products are settled. Amgen said the
negotiations will include terms for Amgen sales of EPO to
Ortho and an accounting for the expected sales by the
companies into each others' therapeutic markets.</p>
<p>Amgen and Ortho differed in their interpretations of the
order. In a statement, Raritan, N.J.-based Ortho said the
judge found that Amgen failed to comply with its contractual
obligations. An Amgen spokesman in Thousand Oaks, Calif.,
said "we believe we complied with the terms of the
agreement." The judge's order is private and isn't being
released at Amgen's request, an Ortho spokesman said.</p>
<p>Analysts said the ruling favored Ortho, but wasn't a
surprise because they said it appears to mirror the view of a
federal court judge in Delaware who ordered the arbitration
last year. The evidence suggests that Amgen frustrated
Ortho's efforts to win regulatory approval for pre-dialysis
use for EPO by failing to submit Ortho's clinical data as
part of Amgen's new-drug application, the judge said.</p>
<p>Amgen received FDA approval last year to market EPO to
kidney-dialysis patients. In December, Ortho asked the FDA to
approve the use of EPO for treating pre-dialysis patients.
Ortho also is seeking approval for use of EPO in conjunction
with the drug AZT for treatment of patients infected with the
AIDS virus.</p>
