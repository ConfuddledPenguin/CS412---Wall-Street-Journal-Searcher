	<p class="article-leader">Avions Marcel Dassault-Breguet Aviation S.A. said group
profit grew 36% to 582.5 million francs ($102.5 million) in
1989 from 427.7 million francs the previous year.
   The French airline company said 1989 earnings came to
500.2 million francs after payments to minority interests.
There was no comparable figure available for 1988.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Avions Dassault's revenue was nearly unchanged, however,
at 17.36 billion francs, compared with 17.66 billion francs
in 1988.</p>
<p>The company said its flat earnings figures reflected
orders taken in 1989 that are scheduled to be filled in 1990.
Thus, revenue from the sales will appear in this year's
results.</p>
<p>The company said it had booked orders valued at 16.55
billion francs in 1989, representing a 3.6% rise from 15.963
billion francs the year before.</p>
<p>Analysts said aircraft-company results often are skewed
depending on the flow of orders received and orders filled.</p>
