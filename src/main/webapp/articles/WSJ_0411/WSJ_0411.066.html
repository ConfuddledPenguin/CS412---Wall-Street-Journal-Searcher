	<p class="article-leader">LANCASTER, Pa. -- Armstrong World Industries Inc. said
first-quarter net income will be "significantly ahead" of the
1989 first quarter, when it posted earnings of $37.4 million,
or 81 cents a share.
   The building-products concern said first-quarter earnings
from continuing operations will be "comfortably higher" than
a year earlier, including a gain of $2.7 million, or six
cents a share, from settlement of asbestos-related
litigation. In the 1989 quarter, Armstrong's results included
a $2.7 million gain from such settlements.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>In addition, Armstrong expects to report an unusual gain
of $16.5 million, or 40 cents a share, for the latest first
quarter from the sale of Georgia woodlands to an undisclosed
buyer. The company said that additional proceeds from the
sale, expected to exceed the amount already received, will be
received in early June, subject to certain conditions.</p>
<p>Armstrong also adopted an accounting change, effective
Jan. 1, 1990, that will increase first-quarter earnings by $8
million, or 19 cents a share.</p>
<p>It said sales for the just-ended quarter are expected to
be more than 3% higher than the $710 million posted in the
1989 first quarter.</p>
<p>Armstrong said it was commenting on its results because
recent projections by some analysts have been too low.
Armstrong is the object of a proxy fight and possible hostile
takeover bid by the Belzberg family of Canada, which owns
about 11.3% of the company's stock.</p>
<p>In New York Stock Exchange composite trading, Armstrong
shares closed at $34.50, up $1.50.</p>

<p>Corrections & Amplifications</p>
<p>ARMSTRONG WORLD INDUSTRIES Inc. realized a $2.7 million
gain in the 1989 first quarter as a result of certain
litigation settlements. Sales in the 1989 first quarter were
$619 million as recently restated by the company. In
yesterday's edition, the gain was incorrectly attributed to
the 1990 first quarter and the sales figure was misstated.</p>
