	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Scan the business press these days, and you're
bound to see a story about a former Drexel Burnham Lambert
Inc. employee landing a job somewhere on Wall Street.
   But nearly two months after Drexel's parent filed for
bankruptcy-law protection, only about 20% of all former
Drexel employees have found work in the securities business,
industry executives and executive search firms estimate.
About 4,500 of Drexel's 5,300 employees have been fired since
the parent filed for bankruptcy-law protection in February
and Drexel began liquidating the firm.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Many of Drexel's top professionals have landed on their
feet, of course. As many as three-quarters of the firm's
investment bankers, traders, salesmen and analysts have found
work at other securities firms or launched investment
boutiques, industry executives say.</p>
<p>The rest of Drexel's professionals, however, plus the bulk
of its support staff, haven't yet found work, they say.
(Drexel's support staff, which includes clerks, trading
assistants, back-office operations personnel and others, made
up about two-thirds of its work force. While no one has
tracked whether these employees have found work outside the
securities business, many are expected to seek employment
within the industry.) And with Wall Street mired in a steep
recession -- nearly 45,000 securities employees nationwide
have been laid off since the October 1987 stock-market crash
-- analysts predict some Drexel staff members may never work
in the securities industry again.</p>
<p>"The big producers that can carry clients and revenue with
them" haven't had much trouble finding work on Wall Street,
says Joan C. Zimmerman, executive vice president at GZ
Stephens Inc., a New York executive-search firm. But,
"There's still a fairly significant body of individuals who
have not yet found homes," she adds.</p>
<p>Drexel, for its part, says it hasn't tracked where former
employees have landed. "There's no way to pin it down," a
spokesman says, although he adds that most of Drexel's
professionals have quickly found jobs elsewhere.</p>
<p>Either way, the mass exodus from Drexel is unprecedented:
Never have so many employees of a major securities firm been
dumped on the job market so suddenly. That's because a firm
the size of Drexel has never disintegrated so quickly. And
while former Drexel employees will probably continue to
filter back into the securities business, the timing of
Drexel's collapse couldn't have been worse.</p>
<p>"In a roaring bull market, the bottom half gets swept
along," says Arthur Kirsch, a former top Drexel equity
executive who quickly landed a job as chief executive officer
of County NatWest Securities USA. "In a tough environment,
the top half wins and the bottom half has to search around."</p>
<p>County NatWest has been a big recipient of Drexel talent:
the National Westminster Bank PLC unit has hired 60
professionals -- or fully 20% -- of Drexel's 300-person
equity group.</p>
<p>But no Wall Street firm has taken on more Drexel people
than Smith Barney, Harris Upham & Co. The Primerica Corp.
unit has hired about 815 Drexel employees in the past year --
about 100 of them in the past two months.</p>
<p>Most of those pre-collapse hirings by Smith Barney came
after Drexel decided to get out of the retail, or
individual-investor, brokerage business; Smith Barney bought
16 Drexel offices and hired about 400 brokers, the bulk of
Drexel's brokerage chain.</p>
<p>Since Drexel's collapse, Smith Barney has hired 17 members
of a Drexel money-management group, led by former Drexel
director Maurits E. Edersheim; Drexel's 23-member
financial-restructuring unit, and such analysts as John
Reidy, a well-known media and broadcasting analyst.</p>
<p>Drexel's Chicago-based grain futures department of 29
employees also resurfaced at Smith Barney, as well as 15
people from Drexel's financial-futures group.</p>
<p>Yesterday, Barclays de Zoete Wedd got into the act. The
investment-banking and securities arm of British bank
Barclays Group said it hired several former Drexel senior
stock analysts and support staff to beef up its international
securities business.</p>
<p>Among the more highly visible Barclays hires: economist
Richard Hoey and investment strategist Abby Joseph Cohen.</p>
<p>But it's not only investment bankers and stock-market
professionals that have landed jobs. Drexel's demise has also
caused ripples in the commodities industry. Although Drexel
was best known for trading and underwriting high-risk,
high-yield junk bonds, it had a respected commodities-trading
operation that has now scattered to other firms, particularly
PaineWebber Group Inc.</p>
<p>Much of Drexel's cocoa, energy and metals groups -- 28
people including metals economist Frederick Demler -- were
snapped up by PaineWebber. PaineWebber also hired as vice
chairman G. Christian Anderson, a top Drexel investment
banker, as well as 15 other Drexel investment bankers, nine
in in New York and six in Los Angeles.</p>
<p>Many smaller firms have benefited. Much of Drexel's
coffee-trading and sugar-trading groups, with a handful of
employees each, went to Rodman & Renshaw Inc. in Chicago;
that firm says it has overnight become a leading coffee and
sugar trader. Rodman & Renshaw says it has hired 25 former
Drexel employees in the past two months, and 25 before that.
Rodman & Renshaw's chairman, Kurt Karmin, is a former Drexel
senior vice president.</p>
<p>"I felt like a scavenger," says Mr. Karmin. But "it was an
opportunity for us to get very good people; we're only
helping people."</p>
<p>Drexel's once-bustling Beverly Hills hub has helped
bolster the West Coast operations of some Wall Street firms.
One-third of the 35 former Drexel staffers hired by
Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette Inc. work in its Los Angeles
office.</p>
<p>Among the most coveted Drexel employees, of course, have
been its junk-bond staff. Drexel virtually created and then
dominated the market for these high-risk, high-yield bonds.
Salomon Inc. has been a big winner, snatching several of
Drexel's junk experts. Earlier this week, Salomon also bought
Drexel's list of junk-bond clients and other junk-bond
financial data.</p>
<p>Jefferies & Co. also has hired several of Drexel's
junk-bond staff members, including Marc Rapaport, Jess
Ravich, Joseph Radecki, David Sydorick, Roy Johnson and David
Feinman. Jefferies, the brokerage unit of Jefferies Group,
hired two corporate finance professionals, too: Jeffry
Weinhuff and Bruce Raben, the firm says.</p>
<p>CRT Government Securities Ltd. recently hired 10 former
Drexel bond professionals, including the bulk of its highly
regarded zero-coupon bond desk and John Norris, former
president of Drexel's government-securities unit.</p>
<p>But some of Wall Street's biggest firms have refrained
from hiring large numbers of top Drexel employees. Bear
Stearns Cos. has hired about 20 former Drexel staffers, but
only a handful of managing directors, including Joel Gold and
Peter Rothschild in corporate finance.</p>
<p>Some large firms that have stayed away from Drexel
employees are busy laying off their own. Merrill Lynch & Co.
hasn't been too interested in Drexel talent, although it did
investment banker Alison Mass, who at Drexel served as a top
aide to merger chief Leon Black, helping him arrange
financing for takeover bids.</p>
<p>American Express Co.'s Shearson Lehman Hutton Holdings
Inc. says it has hired only about a dozen former Drexel
traders, salesmen and researchers. Shearson is
"cherry-picking more than anything else," a spokesman says.</p>
