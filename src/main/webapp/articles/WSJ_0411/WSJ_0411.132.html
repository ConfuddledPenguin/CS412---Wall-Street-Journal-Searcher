	<p class="article-leader">TOKYO -- Fuji Heavy Industries Ltd. said it will replace
its president with an executive from Nissan Motor Co.,
fueling speculation that the larger company will exert more
control over financially strapped Fuji.
   Fuji, which makes cars under the name Subaru, said
Toshihiro Tajima, the 70-year-old president, "would release
himself from the duty of president" following the shareholder
annual meeting June 28. He will remain as chairman.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The company said the new president will be Isamu Kawai,
67, currently president of Nissan Diesel Motor Co. Nissan
holds 4.4% of Fuji, making Nissan Fuji's largest shareholder.</p>
<p>Last month, Fuji said it would post a loss of 23 billion
yen ($145.6 million) in the year ended March 31, sharply
higher than the early projected loss of three billion yen.
It's the company's first loss since its shares were listed on
the Tokyo Stock Exchange in 1960.</p>
<p>After yesterday's announcement, Nissan President Yutaka
Kume said that "as far as Nissan is concerned, if we were
asked to give Fuji Heavy Industries support and assistance,
we are willing to proceed in that direction on the basis of
discussions once the new organization is in place."</p>
