	<p class="article-leader">California health officials are kicking off a $28.6
million cigarette-bashing advertising blitz today financed by
the state's excise tax on tobacco.
   The state, calling its campaign the largest offensive ever
against smoking, is the first to use cigarette taxes to try
to cut and eventually to eliminate tobacco use.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The campaign will be funded by a voter-initiated cigarette
tax passed in 1988 that added a 25-cent-a-pack levy to the
10-cent tax already in effect. The increase was the largest
ever on either the state or federal level, according to the
Tobacco Institute, an industry trade group based in
Washington, D.C.</p>
<p>But Kenneth Kizer, California's health director, said the
indirect goal of the new campaign is savings to the public in
California, where more than 29% of the men and 22% of the
women smoke. "The cost of tobacco use is staggering," Dr.
Kizer said, adding that more than 30,000 Californians die
each year from smoking-related diseases. "On top of that
carnage, smoking costs the citizens of this state more than
$7.1 billion in health care and lost productivity," Dr. Kizer
said.</p>
<p>One of the themes of the campaign is the alleged deception
in the advertising done by tobacco companies. The headline in
one full-page ad that begins running in the state today
reads, "First, the smoke. Now, the mirrors."</p>
<p>And rather than capitalizing on data showing the dangers
of smoking, as many anti-smoking ads have in the past, this
campaign will often appeal to emotions and attempt to attack
the image of refreshment and status that tobacco company ads
have created.</p>
<p>One television ad shows a smoky office in which a tobacco
executive, speaking to other board members, talks about
recruiting more smokers to keep company profits up. "So
forget all that cancer-heart disease-emphysema-stroke stuff,"
the executive says. "We're not in this business for our
health."</p>
<p>Another of the four TV ads shows a black youth singing in
rap style: "We used to pick it. Now they want us to smoke
it." Another addresses the issue of secondary smoke. As a man
smokes in a kitchen and talks with his pregnant wife, she
inhales his smoke. Then smoke billows out of her mouth.</p>
<p>Ads in the campaign, developed by the Los Angeles-based
agency Keye/Donna/Pearlstein, will also run on radio and on
billboards, with some placed on MTV. The agency previously
developed the TV ad for the Partnership for a Drug-Free
America that showed an egg frying and compared that to the
effect of drugs on the brain.</p>
<p>Many of the ads are aimed at target groups where smoking
rates are particularly high, where dangers are unusually
severe or where tobacco companies have aimed their own
campaigns.</p>
<p>"When you drive through the ghetto, all you see are
cigarette and alcohol ads," said Paul Keye, chairman of the
agency developing the ads. "The ads are about exploitation.
They are about genocide."</p>
<p>Some of the state's ads target teens, since 60% of tobacco
users start smoking before they reach high school. Pregnant
women and specific ethnic groups, which have higher rates of
smoking and smoking-related death and disease, also get
special attention. Some ads will run in Spanish, Vietnamese,
Laotian, Chinese and other languages, Dr. Kizer said.</p>
<p>"We want the public to understand that they have been sold
a bill of goods, that they have been duped by the cigarette
companies. We want to portray a more correct image of what
tobacco use is all about," Dr. Kizer said. Cigarette packs
now carry one of four warnings from the U.S. surgeon general
that state that smoking causes lung cancer, heart disease,
emphysema and may complicate pregnancy or result in fetal
injury.</p>
<p>Most tobacco industry representatives have declined to
comment on the ads until they've had a chance to review the
campaign, though some state officials expect the industry to
respond with ads. The industry spent millions to oppose the
boost in cigarette taxes two years ago.</p>
<p>"There isn't much we can do about the campaign," said
Walker Merryman, vice president of the Tobacco Institute. He
complained that the ads don't seem to be in keeping with what
he said was the voter mandate simply to educate youths not to
smoke. "They don't attempt to educate anyone about any
possible health effects of smoking. They simply seek to make
the tobacco companies appear to be heartless, uncaring, even
racist," he said.</p>
<p>He also questioned if the ads would have any effect. "They
aren't selling a product. They are selling an idea: social
modification."</p>
<p>The ads initiate a $221 million overall campaign to curb
smoking in the state. The state health department will
disburse funds to local health departments and public schools
for anti-smoking education, with additional amounts going to
health and community groups.</p>
<p>The campaign comes as one more assault on the tobacco
industry. In 1971, the federal government banned all radio
and TV cigarette ads. Last February, another federal law went
into effect banning smoking on all domestic aircraft flights
under six hours. In addition, 28 states now restrict smoking
in government workplaces and 16 states restrict it in private
sector workplaces, according to the Tobacco Institute.
Moreover, since 1986, a handful of federal bills have been
introduced seeking an outright ban on all cigarette ads.</p>
<p>In the past, the American Cancer Society, the American
Lung Association and U.S. health officials have issued public
service announcements about smoking, hoping that the media
would run them. The state of Minnesota has run some
antismoking ads using general funds, Mr. Merryman said.</p>
<p>The industry, according to Federal Trade Commission
figures, spends about $3.4 billion a year to sell cigarettes,
$656.8  million of which goes into ads. U.S. sales of
cigarettes peaked in 1982 at 634 billion cigarettes for $21.2
billion. They're now running at about 533 billion cigarettes
for $37 billion.</p>
