	<p class="article-leader">Respected stock-market average seeks attractive
companions. Has accomplished great things, but feels isolated
in current market environment. Wants to scale new heights;
prefers not to do it alone.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The Dow Jones Industrial Average can't place a personal
ad, but it's certainly lonely enough.</p>
<p>The industrial average posted a new high of 2810 in
January and has stayed within hailing distance since, closing
at 2710.36 Friday. But most stock-market performance gauges
have been far weaker. These flagging indicators suggest to
some people that the Dow will topple soon.</p>
<p>For example, the Dow Jones Transportation average peaked
in September. The New York Stock Exchange advance-decline
line, a cumulative measure of advancing Big Board stocks
minus decliners, peaked last August.</p>
<p>Martin Zweig, a New York money manager and writer of a
market letter, notes that while the Dow industrial average of
30 blue-chip stocks has risen 53% since the crash of 1987,
the average stock on the Big Board (weighting stocks of
various-sized companies equally) has risen only 8.5%. And the
average stock on the American Stock Exchange is down 6% since
the crash.</p>
<p>The isolation of the Dow industrials strikes quite a few
market watchers as a sign of rough times ahead. Mr. Zweig,
for example, warns that such a pattern has typically come
before severe bear markets such as those of 1929, 1973-74 and
late 1987.</p>
<p>"Historically, preceding a decline in the market, it is
normal for the big-cap stocks {big-company stocks with large
market values} to hang up there longer," says John Mendelson,
consultant to Credit Lyonnais Securities New York and for
many years a widely followed market pundit with Dean Witter
Reynolds. He wouldn't be surprised to see the industrial
average topple to 2250 or so, bringing big stocks more in
line with the broad market.</p>
<p>"The generals are first to rise and last to fall," says
Richard Evans, editor of Dow Theory Forecasts, a newsletter
in Hammond, Ind. "Typically in major market tops, the stocks
in the big market averages are the last to break."</p>
<p>Mr. Evans believes that stocks are probably in a bear
market already, but are still in the mild early phase, not
the more severe panic phase. He finds it "quite discouraging"
that the Dow Jones Utility Average and Dow Jones
Transportation Average haven't kept pace with the industrial
average.</p>
<p>Weakness in utility stocks, Mr. Evans and others say,
tends to mean that higher interest rates lie ahead. That's
important, because low or falling interest rates are like
spring rain for growing stock prices. High or rising interest
rates are poison to stocks.</p>
<p>"The utilities haven't even been able to stage a modest
rally," says Mr. Evans.</p>
<p>The utility average closed Friday at 208.38, a bit above
its year-to-date low of 203.09 on April 30, but well below
the Jan. 2 high of 236.23. This doesn't suggest an early end
to the recent rise in interest rates (30-year Treasury bonds
now yield nearly 9% vs. 8% when the year started).</p>
<p>The transportation average has traditionally been used by
a group of market analysts called Dow theorists to confirm or
deny the evidence of movements in the industrial average.
When the two move together, the theory goes, a trend is
likely to persist. When they're out of synch, the trend is
likely to reverse.</p>
<p>Mr. Evans is worried because the transports "have looked
awful" since setting highs in September. They "didn't
confirm" the industrials' new high in January, and they've
been weak recently as well. Mr. Evans's conclusion: "I think
we're going to have a break in the industrials." If the
January low of 2569 on the industrials is broken, he expects
a further drop of 300 points.</p>
<p>Of course, the transportation average is distorted by the
gyrations of takeover talks at UAL Corp. Mr. Evans says that
may exaggerate the index's movements, but its direction is
still significant.</p>
<p>Not all the technical tea leaves point to a further
stock-market drop. Investor sentiment is pretty gloomy, which
paradoxically is often viewed by market technicians as a good
sign. Cash levels at stock mutual funds were nearly 12% in
March, which means there's a lot of money on the sidelines
that could be redeployed into stocks. And the economy, which
has been limping along, looks slightly more brisk lately.</p>
<p>What's more, different people draw different lessons from
the divergence between the Dow industrials and the broader
market. Some think big stocks have to fall; others think that
small stocks may play catch-up.</p>
<p>Lois Burleigh, manager of the equity division at ASB
Capital Management in Washington, D.C., thinks such big
stocks as those in the Dow industrials will fall
substantially in the months ahead as small stocks pretty much
tread water.</p>
<p>She says that investors have gravitated to the big stocks
for a feeling of security in an uncertain economy. "The Dow
is made up of very large companies. You know that even if
Exxon has a bad quarter, the company's not going to dry up
and blow away," she says. "But if you're talking about some
small parts supplier to the auto industry, a bad quarter may
be the end."</p>
<p>At this point, Ms. Burleigh says, "Our scenario is that
most of the damage has been done" to the majority of stocks.
"If the economy keeps improving, people may say, gee, I don't
need the safety of PepsiCo, maybe I should be in
Weyerhaeuser."</p>
<p>Jack Orben, chairman of Fiduciary Counsel Inc., thinks the
present two-tier market may persist for quite a while.
Accordingly, he recommends that investors stick with the
heavyweights -- stocks of big companies with strong earnings
trends. Among those he likes are Sysco, Gillette, Coca-Cola,
Abbott Labs, and Genuine Parts. (Of those, only Coca-Cola is
part of the Dow.)</p>
<p>Eric Miller, chief investment officer for Donaldson,
Lufkin & Jenrette, finds the divergence between the Dow and
other indicators "worrisome," and says it's more pronounced
now than it was before the 1987 crash. Such divergences, he
says, are "a warning light," though they "can't be used to
pinpoint the timing" of a decline.</p>
<p>Compared with 1987, Mr. Miller notes, stocks are more
reasonably priced now. And a financial gimmick called
portfolio insurance, which exacerbated the crash, is
mercifully rare now. However, Mr. Miller adds that corporate
earnings, which were rising then, have been declining lately.</p>
<p>He isn't ready to snap at the latest evidence that the
economy is perking up, citing three "delayed-action factors"
that may slow down the economy: increased interest rates,
more-stringent bank lending standards, and corporate
cost-cutting spurred by declining profits. He thinks it's
likely the Dow Jones Industrial Average will revisit its
January low of about 2543.</p>

<p>Hiring coup at Goldman Sachs: "We are pleased to announce
that we have hired Mother Nature to assist us in our
portfolio strategy," the firm tells clients in its Investment
Strategy Highlights. Previously, "Mother Nature was employed
by a consortium of economists," relates Goldman strategist
Steven Einhorn; he explains that whenever business activity
exceeds economists' expectations, warm weather has been the
culprit, while cold weather takes the blame at other times.
For a good while, Mr. Einhorn says, "We have wanted a
catchall excuse when the market has been better or worse than
anticipated. Now, with the addition of Mother Nature to our
staff, we alone have access to the weather excuse."</p>
