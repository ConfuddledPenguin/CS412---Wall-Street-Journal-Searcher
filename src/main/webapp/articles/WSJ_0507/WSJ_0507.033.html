	<p class="article-leader">LOS ANGELES -- Hughes Aircraft Co. said a former Defense
Department official dropped a $360 million whistleblower suit
against the company after the government declined to
participate in the case.
   Patrick M. Kelley, who was in charge of overseeing
contracts at the aerospace company's Ground Systems Group,
had alleged that between 1983 and 1989 Hughes mischarged
certain labor costs and submitted false claims against the
government totaling $70 million. Hughes said the Justice
Department filed papers dismissing the suit in federal court
here.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>An attorney for Mr. Kelley said the case was under seal
and referred calls to the Justice Department, where a
spokesman declined comment. Hughes said in a statement that
all its costs were proper.</p>
