	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- With extremism surging in Israel, the U.S.
is seeking to bolster moderates on both sides of the
Israeli-Palestinian dispute. The effort may further strain
Israeli-U.S. relations.
   As a gesture to Palestinians, U.S. officials are
discussing taking a firmer stand against Israel's forced
separation of thousands of Palestinian families in the
occupied territories. They believe focusing on these
human-rights abuses, previously given little prominence,
would give Palestinians some hope.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Officials also say that in an attempt to rein in Israeli
right-wingers, the administration will continue to respond
sharply to such incidents as the recent attempted takeover by
Jewish settlers of the St. John's Hospice in the Christian
quarter of East Jerusalem. State Department spokeswoman
Margaret Tutwiler labeled that effort, secretly subsidized by
the Israeli government, "an insensitive and provocative
action."</p>
<p>Washington's concerns are mounting because U.S. analysts
see rough times ahead as Yitzhak Shamir, Israel's caretaker
prime minister, attempts to form a government. They believe
Mr. Shamir would rather lead another "national unity"
coalition with the Labor Party than head a narrow-based
government with the right-wing extremists in his own Likud
bloc and hard-line fringe parties. He fears the extremists
want to purge him and take control.</p>
<p>But Mr. Shamir has a problem. It was Labor that brought
down the last coalition government in March, charging that
Mr. Shamir wasn't sincere about pursuing peace. To coax Labor
into another coalition, U.S. analysts believe, Mr. Shamir
must first make it appear that he is on the verge of forming
a government with the right-wing extremists. As a result, in
the next few weeks Israeli politics will be dominated by
hard-liners calling for more Jewish settlements in the West
Bank and Gaza, a tougher policy against the Palestinian
uprising and even the expulsion of Arabs from the
territories.</p>
<p>"The bargaining will take a form that will alarm Americans
and alarm President Bush and strain the fabric of the
{U.S.-Israel} relationship," says a pro-Israel member of the
U.S. Jewish community.</p>
<p>The process also will take time. The dovish Shimon Peres,
who heads the Labor Party and who pushed to end the last
coalition, isn't likely to agree to another stint as junior
partner with Likud. Mr. Shamir would like to work with
Labor's more conservative Yitzhak Rabin, who was defense
minister in the past coalition government. But for that to
happen, Labor would have to make Mr. Rabin head of the party,
and that could be a protracted process.</p>
<p>U.S. officials estimate that it could take up to two
months to form a coalition, or, if the effort fails, six
months to hold elections and form a new government. The
Americans say that Mr. Shamir could form a narrow-based
right-wing government more quickly but that would mean the
end of peace efforts.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Palestinian frustrations are building. That
plays into the hands of Arab hard-liners, including leftists
who advocate intensifying the uprising, and Islamic
fundamentalists who call for a holy war for the liberation of
Palestine. "As is often the case in the Middle East, these
two extremes have the capacity to work together and squeeze
out the center," says William Quandt, a Mideast expert at
Washington's Brookings Institution.</p>
<p>So some U.S. officials want to press Israel to resolve
family-unification cases quickly to show Palestinians that
their interests aren't being ignored amid the chaos of
Israeli politics. These cases arise because Israel sometimes
refuses to renew visas of Palestinians attempting to return
to their families in the territories after working abroad, or
because it denies entry or permanent residency to
non-Palestinian spouses or children of people who live in the
territories, according to the State Department's 1989 Human
Rights report. The report cites Israeli statistics showing
that in the past two years 3,266 family-unification
applications were filed but only 695 were approved.</p>
<p>Any such U.S. effort would be a symbolic gesture. But with
extremism on the rise, officials are searching for ways to
hold the political middle until the storm subsides.</p>
