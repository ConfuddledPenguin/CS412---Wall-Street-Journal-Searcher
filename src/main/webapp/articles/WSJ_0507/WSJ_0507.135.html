#22 million ($36.1 million) plus a single contingent cash
payment.
   Hunt, a maker of office and art supplies, said the

businesses and certain related products.</p>

Connecticut-based marketer of mounting and laminating
equipment and supplies; Ademco Ltd., which markets a similar
line of products in the U.K.; and Coated Specialities Ltd., a
