	<p class="article-leader">TAIPEI, Taiwan -- Taiwan's trade surplus in April totaled
$780 million U.S. dollars, a decline of 21% from the same
period last year, the government said Friday.
   The Directorate General of Budget, Accounting and
Statistics said April's exports reached $5.7 billion dollars,
up 1.2% from a year earlier, while imports rose 6%, to $4.92
billion dollars.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Taiwan registered a trade surplus of $2.59 billion dollars
in the first four months of the year, down 31% from the
year-earlier period, the agency said.</p>
<p>Government officials attributed the lower surplus mainly
to a stronger Taiwan dollar, which made locally manufactured
products less attractive to foreign buyers.</p>
<p>In April, Taiwan had a trade surplus with the U.S.
totaling $670 million dollars, down 32.1% from a year
earlier. April exports to the U.S. reached $1.85 billion
dollars, while imports totaled $1.18 billion dollars.</p>
