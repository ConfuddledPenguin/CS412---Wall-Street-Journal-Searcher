	<p class="article-leader">PETROFINA S.A. (Brussels) -- As expected, Petrofina
announced Friday a new slate of directors, giving more power
to the two Brussels-based holding companies that control it,
Societe Generale de Belgique S.A. and Groupe Bruxelles
Lambert S.A. The oil company named Albert Frere as chairman
and Viscount Etienne Davignon as vice chairman. Mr. Frere is
chairman of Groupe Bruxelles Lambert, and Mr. Davignon holds
the same post at Societe Generale. Groupe Bruxelles owns
about 20% of Petrofina's shares, and another company
controlled by Mr. Frere holds some 5%. Societe Generale
indirectly controls about 12% of Petrofina. In addition,
Petrofina named 40-year-old Francois Cornelis, currently an
executive director, as chief executive officer. Jean-Pierre
Amory is retiring as chairman and chief executive but will
remain a director. Pierre de Tillesse, who is stepping down
as vice chairman, also will continue as a director. Among
other appointments, Petrofina named as directors Guy
Dejouany, who is chairman of Cie. Generale des Eaux of
France; Gilles Samyn, a director of Groupe Bruxelles; and
Henrique Bandeira Vieira, Petrofina's senior vice president,
exploration and production. The board is being expanded to a
maximum of 20 members from 18. Ten of the directors are to
represent the big shareholders, six are to come from
Petrofina's management, and the rest are to be "independent"
directors.</p>
