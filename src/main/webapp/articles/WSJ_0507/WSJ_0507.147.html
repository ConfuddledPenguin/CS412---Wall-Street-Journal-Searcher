	<p class="article-leader">CHICAGO -- Sears, Roebuck & Co. completed a reorganization
of its weak women's business unit, consolidating
responsibility for merchandising mostly in the hands of
outsiders in a bid to boost sales.
   The U.S.'s largest retailer appointed Dorrit Bern, one of
the first departmentstore managers recruited as part of the
current drive to update stores, to the new post of national
merchandise manager of women's ready-to-wear apparel. The
selection greatly expands Ms. Bern's responsibilities by
adding the big sportswear category. She had been national
merchandise manager for women's dresses, coats and junior
apparel.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The announcement followed the appointments of two other
outsiders as top managers of Sears women's merchandise
categories. Only one women's merchandise category, intimate
apparel and hosiery, is still overseen by a company veteran.</p>
<p>The personnel moves amount to an admission by Sears that
it desperately needs to revamp its women's business -- and
that its mostly inbred managers aren't up to the task on
their own. "The important thing is Sears is looking for the
best people," said Michael Bozic, chairman and chief
executive officer of the Sears merchandise group. He added
that Sears's strengths "sometimes are more visible to
competitors and people on the outside than they are to us."</p>
<p>The stakes are high. "If Sears can't figure out how to
sell women clothes, it is going to be very limited in its
ability to grow," said George Rosenbaum, president of Leo J.
Shapiro & Associates, a market research firm. Women surveyed
in the fall by Shapiro & Associates were significantly more
confident of finding what they wanted at J.C. Penney Co.
stores than at Sears, Mr. Rosenbaum said.</p>
<p>Mr. Bozic said the company's latest image survey indicated
some improvement in the way women view Sears, probably the
result of its efforts to add national labels to what had been
mostly a private-label lineup. He declined to say how much
the favorable feelings had risen.</p>
<p>Still, Mr. Bozic isn't satisfied with the current
performance. He said he expects the new women's organization
to produce double-digit sales increases in the second half of
the year, which includes the important Christmas season.
Store sales of women's apparel last year accounted for less
than 10% of the company's merchandise group revenue of $31.6
billion.</p>
<p>The 40-year-old Ms. Bern already has a track record at
Sears, where she is credited with reviving the once-moribund
teenagers' and young women's business known as juniors. After
jumping to Sears in 1987 from the Bon Marche department store
chain in Seattle, Ms. Bern recruited department-store buyers
to develop new Mainframe departments, stocked mostly with
national labels. Sears says the departments, which feature
harem pants and other trendy styles, are a success.</p>
<p>This past year, Sears rewarded Ms. Bern by adding dresses
and coats to her responsibilities. She has recruited buyers
from department stores in these areas too. And Mr. Bozic said
dress sales are "exploding now" from what he acknowledged was
a small base.</p>
<p>The women's sportswear business was formerly run by Joe
Silvestri, a Sears veteran, who is moving into the top
marketing job in the women's business unit, Mr. Bozic said.</p>
<p>Heading the other three women's merchandise categories at
Sears are:</p>
<p>-- John Guze, who joined Sears in April as general manager
of footwear, luggage and women's accessories. The 44-year-old
Mr. Guze, who had been a divisional merchandise manager at
Dayton Hudson Corp.'s department store unit in Minneapolis,
holds the title of general manager because he is responsible
for both buying and selling operations.</p>
<p>-- Kenneth Cort, general manager of the fine jewelry
business since last year. The 47-year-old Mr. Cort formerly
was chairman and chief executive of Zale Jewelry.</p>
<p>-- Janice Page, a 41-year-old Sears veteran, remains in
her post as national merchandise manager for intimate apparel
and hosiery.</p>
