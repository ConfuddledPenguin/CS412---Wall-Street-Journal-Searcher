	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON (AP) -- Neil Bush, the president's son, said he
agreed to testify before the House Banking Committee about
the failure of a Denver thrift on whose board he served.
   The panel, headed by Rep. Henry Gonzalez (D., Texas), is
looking into the December 1988 collapse of Silverado Banking,
Savings & Loan Association.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Thrift regulators are expected to testify May 22, while
Mr. Bush and other Silverado board members are to appear May
23. "I have agreed to participate and will continue to
cooperate with Congress, the Office of Thrift Supervision and
any other agencies involved," Mr. Bush said in a statement.</p>
<p>The thrift office has alleged that loans by Silverado to
Mr. Bush's business partners, developers Kenneth Good and
Bill Walters, were a conflict of interest for Mr. Bush, who
was on the S&L's board from October 1985 until August 1988.</p>
<p>In January, regulators began disciplinary procedures
against Mr. Bush that could result in a lifetime ban from the
financial-institutions industry. Mr. Bush has denied any
wrongdoing.</p>
