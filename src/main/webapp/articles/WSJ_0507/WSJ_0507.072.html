	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- The Internal Revenue Service retained a tax
restriction that some investors believe hinders recent steps
to open the global capital markets.
   The IRS said Friday that "because of general tax
compliance concerns," it won't allow a special type of bond
that could be freely converted between the different types of
debt sold in the U.S. and overseas.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>U.S. tax law requires that bonds issued to U.S. investors
be registered in the name of the owner. That way, the tax
authorities can tell who is receiving the interest income.
But foreign debt markets deal primarily in paper known as
bearer bonds, which don't carry the name of the owner.</p>
<p>In light of recent securities-law changes intended to
facilitate the free international trade of securities, the
tax agency had been considering allowing bonds that could be
converted from one form to another, so U.S. investors could
resell their debt to a wider secondary market.</p>
<p>James Duncan, a partner at the law firm Cleary, Gottlieb,
Steen & Hamilton in New York, called the IRS's decision not
to permit the new bond "a lost opportunity."</p>
<p>"The continuing inability to offer securities within the
United States that are genuinely fungible with the same
securities offered outside the United States limits the
opportunities available to issuers," he said. "It restricts
the ability to make a genuinely global offering of debt
securities."</p>
<p>Esta Stecher, a tax attorney at the law firm Sullivan &
Cromwell in New York, said, "It really would be consistent
with the SEC's policy in globalizing the capital markets to
allow registered-form securities to be resold outside the
U.S. in bearer form."</p>
<p>The IRS position on the convertible bonds was contained in
the preamble to a set of regulations covering the issuing of
bearer debt to investors outside the U.S.</p>
<p>Attorneys said the regulations sever a longstanding link
between securities law and tax law covering international
capital market offerings. Generally in the past, if a deal
was found to satisfy the requirements of securities law, it
was acceptable to the tax authorities, too. These regulations
remove that so-called safe harbor.</p>
<p>The securities and tax regulations, for example, now
differ in their definition of "U.S. person." Therefore, the
securities and tax laws have different rules for who can buy
bearer bonds.</p>
<p>In the preamble, the IRS wrote, "These final regulations
are separate and independent from the rules and
interpretations that the SEC chooses to adopt in its
administration of the securities laws."</p>
<p>While promising to consider the SEC's interpretations
"where appropriate," the IRS said it "must ultimately base"
its own interpretations on "the tax policies" underlying the
law.</p>
