	<p class="article-leader">Pfizer Inc. can be sued by a woman who claims that concern
about the quality of her implanted heart valve made by a
Pfizer unit has caused her anxiety, California's Supreme
Court ruled.
   Under the ruling, Judy Kahn, a Virginia woman, can sue
Pfizer's Shiley Inc. unit for damages even though her heart
valve is working properly. In January, a California appeals
court ruled that Mrs. Kahn could sue Shiley, which is based
in Irvine, Calif., but Pfizer had appealed that decision to
the state's Supreme Court.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>News of the higher court's decision late Thursday spread
quickly through Wall Street and among heart valve recipients.
Pfizer has succeeded in having 19 other similar cases
dismissed by the courts. Mrs. Kahn, therefore, is expected to
be the first of perhaps several hundred recipients who could
sue Shiley in California for anxiety-related damages.</p>
<p>In New York, Pfizer said it will defend itself
"vigorously." The company said it believed Mrs. Kahn and
other similar cases face "stringent legal and factual
burdens."</p>
<p>Still, the court's decision sent Pfizer shares shuddering,
falling more than $2 in New York Stock Exchange trading
during the day Friday, and closing at $57, down 87.5 cents.
Pfizer was also the most-actively traded Big Board stock on
Friday. The company's shares have dropped from about $70 in
January when concern about the company's liability received
publicity.</p>
<p>Analysts said the ruling meant there would be a cloud of
uncertainty hanging over Pfizer until the case goes to jury.
"It means the {heart valve problems} are going to be around
for a while," said James Keeney of Mabon, Nugent & Co. Mr.
Keeney said the valve problem may be the "catalyst" to force
the company to shed some slow-growing businesses or buy back
shares.</p>
<p>In Minneapolis, Mrs. Kahn's lawyer said he didn't expect
the case to go to trial in Orange County Superior Court in
California until late 1991 because of the immense amount of
documents that needed to be addressed. The attorney, Bruce
Finzen of Robins, Kaplan, Miller & Ciresi, said there are
about one million pages of documents to work through. Mr.
Finzen said there are 200 similar cases that he could bring
to suit after this one.</p>
<p>The Kahn case stems from structural problems associated
with the Shiley-Bjork convexo-concave valve. The valve was
pulled from use in the mid-1980s when it was found that a
defect caused the valve to fracture. Pfizer said that by the
beginning of this year, 389 valves had broken and 248
patients had died, while about 56,000 people were alive with
working valves.</p>
<p>The company said it has settled numerous suits related to
the failed valves, but it has refused to settle claims made
by those people whose valves are still working. It said it
has sufficient reserves to cover the cases it expects to
settle.</p>
<p>Pfizer said that Mrs. Kahn's lawyers must prove in court
that Pfizer and Shiley engaged in "deceit" in marketing and
testing the valves. The New York-based health-care company
said proving deceit is "difficult." The company also noted
that a federal court in Missouri recently rejected claims
similar to those made by Mrs. Kahn's lawyers.</p>
