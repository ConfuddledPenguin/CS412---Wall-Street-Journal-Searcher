   Is Tragically Wrong</h3>

	<p class="article-leader">As your April 5 article "Ford Settles Big Lap-Belt Injury
Suit" correctly noted, the Institute for Injury Reduction is
predicting that rear lap-belt deaths and injuries could reach
1,200 a year at current rates. In fact, they may have done so
already.
   The important issue is that these injuries could be
largely headed off if auto makers would voluntarily undertake
vigorous programs to retrofit rear-seat lap-and-shoulder
belts into tens of millions of existing cars. That means
offering the belts at cost (no more than $30-to-$40 a car,
installed), advertising them aggressively, and keeping them
in stock at dealers.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>In both cases described in your article, Miller v. Ford
and McKenna v. GM, the families of the injured people offered
to reduce substantially the amounts of the settlements if the
manufacturers would agree to make an effort voluntarily to
having similar models retrofitted with rear lap-shoulder
belts. Their goal was to save others from these devastating,
largely preventable injuries.</p>
<p>And in both cases, tragically, the auto companies
declined. They appear to prefer paying money after the
injurious damage has been done to paying the same money in
advance, to prevent the injuries in the first place.</p>
<p>That is bad public relations for the companies and bad
policy for national health. We can't afford the medical
costs, lost time, pain and grief that lap-belt injuries are
producing -- and in greater volumes as responsible parents
buckle up their youngsters with lap-only belts in the back
seats.</p>
