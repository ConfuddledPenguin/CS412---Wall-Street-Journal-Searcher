	<p class="article-leader">HARTFORD, Conn. -- Aetna Casualty & Surety Co. has
dissolved a joint venture that provided property/casualty
insurance for multinational corporations because it wasn't
successful in a highly competitive segment of the insurance
market.
   Aetna, a unit of Aetna Life & Casualty Co., and
Assicurazoni Generali S.p.A. of Trieste, Italy, each owned
45% of Aegen International Inc., which was formed in 1981.
Taisho Marine & Fire Co. of Japan owned the remaining 10%.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Aegen wrote just $10 million in net written premiums. It
faced huge competition from such larger, well established
insurers as American International Group Inc., Cigna Corp.
and Chubb Co.</p>
<p>All three of the venture partners decided that each of
them individually will develop insurance coverages for
U.S.-based companies doing business abroad and for
foreign-based companies with U.S. ventures.</p>
<p>The venture maintained 30 employees at New York's World
Trade Center, and they were told Friday that the company was
being disbanded.</p>
<p>The Aetna/Generali International Benefits network, which
provides employee benefits for foreign employees of
multinational companies, is a separate entity and wasn't
affected by this change. Aegen was separate from Aetna's
international operations, which weren't affected by Friday's
actions.</p>
