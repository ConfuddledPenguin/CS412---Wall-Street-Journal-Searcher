	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- General Dynamics Corp. agreed to pay
$527,000 in back pay and salary increases to minority and
women workers as part of a settlement of government job
discrimination charges.
   The Labor Department's contract-compliance office said the
defense contractor's Space Systems division in San Diego
didn't fully carry out its affirmative-action program. The
office identified several practices it alleged to be
discriminatory.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>General Dynamics agreed to the settlement without
admitting the charges.</p>
<p>The Space Systems division agreed to extend job
opportunities to black engineering applicants allegedly
screened out of positions, and to give $268,771 in back pay
to 21 black individuals, the compliance office said. The
contractor also reviewed the salaries that it pays to
minorities and women, and raised the pay by $258,590 for 42
minority men and women and 61 non-minority women.</p>
