	<p class="article-leader">For the first time, the government has lost an important
legal round in its effort to renege on accounting gimmicks
granted in the 1980s to moribund thrifts to keep them afloat.
   The decision, stemming from a suit brought by Far West
Federal Bank in federal court in Portland, Ore., further
muddies the legal waters surrounding the huge and
much-maligned savings-and-loan bailout bill passed last
summer and complicates the already flagging effort to change
the industry. Current estimates of the ultimate cost of
cleaning up the savings-and-loan disaster range between $325
billion and $500 billion.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The bailout bill set more stringent capital requirements
for thrifts and required regulators to nullify breaks on
capital requirements -- as well as on other regulations --
that were given to sick thrifts in past years; those breaks
have swollen the ultimate cost of the thrift disaster
immensely, because the insolvent thrifts that were kept open
generally just piled up bigger and bigger losses and
ultimately failed anyway.</p>
<p>The Portland court's ruling also appears to contradict at
least one other decision earlier this year in a similar case
that generally upheld regulators' power to back out of
agreements granting sick thrifts such breaks. Industry
officials said the government is almost certain to appeal.</p>
<p>The latest decision came in a case brought in January by
Far West, which in January 1988 entered into an unusual
agreement with regulators that exempted it from normal
capital and accounting standards. The thrift subsequently
brought in $27 million of fresh capital from private
investors. Under normal accounting and the new requirements
of the bailout bill, Far West would have one of the largest
negative tangible capital levels of any thrift -- about
$280.1 million. With the accounting methods used under the
1988 agreement, it showed tangible capital of about $47.9
million.</p>
<p>Far West said at the time of filing the suit that
regulators had indicated that the bailout bill would
invalidate its agreement, rendering it instantly insolvent
and likely resulting in a costly government takeover. But
U.S. District Court Judge Owen Panner upheld Far West's 1988
agreement, ruling that, in drafting the bailout legislation,
"Congress could not have intended a result so unjust and
inequitable as the complete abrogation of a long-term,
comprehensive agreement on which private third parties relied
to invest large sums of money."</p>
<p>The judge also issued a temporary restraining order
barring the Office of Thrift Supervision or other regulatory
agencies from imposing any other restriction or modification
contained in the bailout bill.</p>
<p>An OTS official in Seattle, which has direct
responsibility for regulating Far West, declined to comment
on the ruling.</p>
<p>Far West officials hailed the ruling. David Nierenberg,
Far West's chairman, called regulators' intention of breaking
the 1988 agreement "dangerous and unwise," because by going
back on its word, the government would make private investors
and capital markets even more skittish about investing in
thrifts than they already are. "The court has recognized
this, and this is an important precedent," he said.</p>
<p>However, other courts have ruled that the government can
back out of past agreements and impose the bailout bill's
provisions. A federal court in Washington, D.C., held in
January that regulators could void certain capital breaks
granted previously to Flagship Federal Savings & Loan of San
Diego. Flagship had sued to prevent regulators from forcing
it to comply with provisions of the bailout bill.</p>
<p>Further confusing matters, a federal court in Chicago
ruled about a month ago that none of the provisions of the
bailout bill could be imposed against Olympic Savings of
Berwyn, Ill. But that court ruled on narrow constitutional
grounds, holding that Congress had never formally approved
the appointment of Danny Wall, then director of the OTS. The
court said that since Mr. Wall's appointment hadn't been
approved, he had no authority to authorize regulators to make
Olympic comply with the bill. But that decision became moot a
few days later when Congress approved the appointment of
Timothy Ryan to head the OTS.</p>
<p>With help from its special agreement with regulators, Far
West had been able to report skimpy profits through most of
1989, although it wound up with a net loss of $9.6 million
for 1989 because of a $10.3 million loss from discontinued
operations, reflecting the closing of its real-estate
development unit. For the first quarter ended March 31, it
had a net loss of $4.3 million. It has a relatively clean
portfolio, with repossessed property of $29.2 million and
past-due loans of about $21 million. It has assets of about
$3.5 billion.</p>
