	<p class="article-leader">First the good news. Blacks are finally moving into a new
neighborhood on the small screen. They're no longer relegated
to "safe" sitcoms or stereotyped bit parts (the black
neighbor, the cop, the junkie)tiny ghettos in a white world.
   Now come two shows that are unabashedly black, "Brewster
Place" (ABC, May 8, 9:30 p.m. EDT; then Wednesdays, 9:30 p.m.
EDT) and "In Living Color" (Fox, Saturdays, 9 p.m. EDT). The
first is a drama, the second a comedy show, and in both the
principal actors and the executive producers (Oprah Winfrey
and Keenen Ivory Wayans) are black. Most important of all, so
is the sensibility. There's nothing remotely Oreo about these
programs.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"Brewster Place," set in 1967, is the story of the
middle-aged Mattie Michael (Ms. Winfrey), a strong-willed,
warm-hearted woman trying to make ends meet in the inner
city. Based on last season's miniseries "The Women of
Brewster Place" (which was in turn based on Gloria Naylor's
novel of the same name), this half-hour dramatic series
starts right in where the miniseries left off, establishing a
tight-knit urban community, including Mattie's best friend
Etta Mae (Brenda Pressley), her nosy, sharp-tongued neighbor
Miss Sophie (Olivia Cole) and her cousin Ralph (John Cothran
Jr.).</p>
<p>As the series begins, Mattie is thrown out of her
hairdressing job for mouthing off to her boss ("I am your
superior"; "I have no superior but God"), and her friend Etta
Mae tries to convice her to plunk her life savings into a
run-down restaurant: "With the right new spunk and a
different menu, Girl, we could turn this place around]"</p>
<p>At first, Mattie is scared because she's been burned
before, when her son skipped bail and she had to forfeit her
house to pay for him. "He hurt you," says Etta Mae, "and you
been closed like a locked Bible ever since." But in the end,
after lots of tears, Mattie decides to take a chance (it
would have been a short series if she hadn't), and they open
the restaurant.</p>
<p>Now I was never too fond of the miniseries, a soggy
exercise in female self-pity, where all the men were cheats
or thugs or rapists. "Brewster Place" corrects that flaw, but
it's even soggier. Co-written and co-executive produced by
Donald Sipes and Earl Hamner (formerly of "The Waltons,")
this series features lines like, "A broken heart doesn't mean
a cold one. You have to make new beginnings, make space to
dream new dreams." In this restaurant, platitudes are dished
out with the grits, and cliches are recited as if they were
deep philosophy: "They say that the Lord works in mysterious
ways. . . . The winds of change started blowing through my
life."</p>
<p>Worst of all, someone (probably Ms. Winfrey) had the
notion that "Brewster Place" should be "uplifting": Oprah's
diner -- the joys, the sorrows, the pork chops. So we get a
program chock-full of cheap sentimentality, and each episode
seems to sag under the weight of a simplistic moral.</p>
<p>Tomorrow's show, for example, is about the restaurant's
only white employee, the cook. "People are looking at me
funny because I'm white," he says. "I know exactly how you
feel," says Mattie, ramming the point home.</p>
<p>There are just two things this program has going for it.
One is Ms. Winfrey's presence -- not her acting, which is way
over the top, but her presence: She fills the screen like an
earth mother, a life force. The second is the show's theme
song, performed by Take 6, surely one of the most inventive a
cappella groups ever. But other than that, "Brewster Place"
is as mushy as week-old hash browns.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>No one would accuse "In Living Color" of being mushy. Full
of street sass, the half-hour comedy-variety show is like a
blacker, hipper version of "Saturday Night Live," so full of
energy it stretches right out and bites you on the rear.
Under the talented Mr. Wayans ("I'm Gonna Git You, Sucka,"
"Hollywood Shuffle") and his equally talented younger brother
Damon ("Earth Girls are Easy"), "In Living Color" signals
right from the start that it's hilarious, but also that it's
not for everyone. Its language alone may lose some viewers:
"Chill with us," "Meet my fly girls."</p>
<p>If this is hip-hop television, it also has a refreshing
social-political agenda: It consistently pokes fun at a world
in which minorities are still second-class citizens. An
"Equity Express" ad lampoons "the right sort" of people who
have credit cards. In another sketch, the "Homeboy Shopping
Network," two fast-talkers are selling stolen stereos off the
back of a truck, at least until they hear the siren of an
approaching police car: "That's our blue light special."</p>
<p>In fact, "In Living Color" doesn't hesitate to poke fun at
just about everyone. In "The Wrath of Farrakhan," for
example, the Black Muslim leader takes over the Starship
Enterprise. But some of the ribbing is also in dubious taste.
In "Men on Film," a homosexual Siskel and Ebert-type team
camp it up, talking about "Great Balls of Fire."</p>
<p>Most questionable of all is the way the show treats women,
with snickering jokes about tampons and breasts ("If your
breasts drop any lower, they're gonna be knees"). And an
all-female dance troupe is constantly greeted by whistles and
catcalls from a salivating audience.</p>
<p>For the most part, "In Living Color" somehow manages to be
simultaneously objectionable and funny -- funny enough to
keep watching. One recent segment is an advertisement for
"Mitzvah Train -- the city's premier Afro-Judeo dating
service." A mixed couple tells us, "Bridge some of those
cultural gaps, while doing the Wild Thing. . . . You'll find
you have a lot more in common than you thought: slavery,
hard-to-manage hair, Sammy Davis Jr. . . . I didn't know a
matzo ball from a basketball till I met Mitzi."</p>
<p>There have been some big recent gains for minorities on
TV. All the same, I'm looking forward to the day when
reviewers like me won't even think to put two new shows in
the same article just because they both happen to feature
blacks, the day when it'll seem so normal, it won't be worthy
of comment. As Keenen Wayans puts it, "After 400 years of
slavery, after 15 years of `The Jeffersons' in syndication,"
that'll be something.</p>
