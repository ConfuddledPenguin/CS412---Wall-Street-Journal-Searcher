	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Whittle Communications L.P. hired the top
sales executive of Turner Broadcasting System Inc. to serve
as chairman of a new unit that includes the classroom news
service Channel One.
   Knoxville, Tenn.-based Whittle said Farrell Reynolds will
serve as chairman and chief executive officer of Whittle
Educational Network. Mr. Reynolds, a 10-year veteran of
Turner Broadcasting, had overseen all ad sales for Turner
cable networks.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The new unit includes all of Whittle's properties, such as
magazines, advertiser-supported wall posters and television
programs, aimed at U.S. schools.</p>
<p>The unit's largest property is Channel One, the daily TV
news show for high school students; the show, which includes
commercials, began airing in March.</p>
<p>Educators have called Channel One blatant
commercialization of public education. So far, 3,600 schools
in 38 states have signed contracts to air the 12-minute daily
program. Turner competes against Channel One with "CNN
Newsroom," a free 15-minute daily news program without ads.</p>
<p>Christopher Whittle, chairman of Whittle Communications,
50%-owned by Time Warner Inc., said that the new unit plans
to create more TV channels in the next three years and that
some services may be expanded overseas.</p>
