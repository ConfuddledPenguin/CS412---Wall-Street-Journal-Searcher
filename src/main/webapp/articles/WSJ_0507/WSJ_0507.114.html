	<p class="article-leader">DALLAS -- In a major coup for NCNB Texas National Bank,
International Business Machines Corp. chose the NCNB Corp.
unit to finance construction of a $150 million office complex
in Austin, Texas.
   NCNB Texas beat out a large banking concern and two
Japanese banks to make the loan, according to Ralph Carestio,
an NCNB corporate executive vice president.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The bank, which has been dogged by its image as a
tight-fisted outsider since it entered the Texas market in
August 1988, touted the IBM deal as its largest real-estate
loan to date and "an excellent example of Texans helping
Texans."</p>
<p>But the loan appears nearly risk-free. IBM will be the
sole tenant of the 1.1 million square feet of office space to
be built in a joint venture with Prentiss Properties, a
Dallas-based real-estate developer. The seven-building
complex, which will be owned by the joint-venture partners,
will house about 3,400 of IBM's Austin-based employees
beginning in spring 1991.</p>
<p>"The lease term is long enough that we've got ample
debt-service coverage for a long, long time," Mr. Carestio
said. "It's as good as a real-estate loan gets."</p>
<p>Neither Mr. Carestio nor an IBM spokesman would specify
the length of IBM's lease or other details of the financing.</p>
<p>But Mr. Carestio said the loan "is not uncharacteristic of
what's going to be happening" in real-estate lending in
Texas. "You're going to see more of these kinds of things,"
with tenants financing their own buildings in so-called
"build-to-suit" developments, he said.</p>
<p>Similar office projects are planned in the Dallas area by
J.C. Penney Co. and GTE Corp.</p>
<p>Even with known tenants, however, developers aren't
finding eager lenders, said Mike Prentiss, president of
Prentiss Properties. (The development company scored a coup
of its own with the IBM deal, beating out Trammell Crow Co.
to become IBM's partner.)</p>
<p>"Notwithstanding who the tenant may be, {lenders} are very
reluctant to finance office buildings in Texas," Mr. Prentiss
said.</p>
