	<p class="article-leader">Rosie, the waitress who mops up clumsy customers' spills
with Bounty paper towels, has joined Mr. Whipple and Mrs.
Olson in the television commercial graveyard at Procter &
Gamble Co.
   She was replaced recently by a musical medley of kids
slopping spaghetti and eggs on the kitchen floor. The new ad,
says L. Ross Love, P&G's vice president of advertising, shows
scenes consumers can relate to. "This brings it home," he
says.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The 20-year-old Rosie campaign and other slice-of-life ads
are slowly but surely vanishing from P&G's television lineup.
Wordy scripts are out. Mini-musicals, complete with rap,
calypso and operas, are in. And some P&G ads are actually
funny.</p>
<p>A decade ago, two of every three P&G commercials were
slice-of-life or testimonial. Now it's only one in four, says
Mr. Love. And the company is trying to change the remaining
slice-of-life commercials "to slice of reality," he says.</p>
<p>Mr. Love cites the "Best Part of Waking Up" ads for
Folgers coffee as an example of greater realism. One recent
commercial shows an emotional homecoming when a son on
military leave greets his parents. That type of slice-of-life
ad can be "interesting and relevant" and more of a mirror of
people's lives, he says.</p>
<p>He's convinced that less traditional approaches work,
suggesting that P&G will increase its budget for such
campaigns in the years ahead.</p>
<p>This is quite a change, considering stuffy P&G was once
the king of slice-of-life and testimonial ads. "They were so
product driven, their ads were recognized as a genre on
Madison Avenue," says Scott Ellsworth, an advertising
historian at the Smithsonian Institution. "The old saying in
advertising is, `Sell the sizzle, not the steak.' But P&G has
traditionally sold the steak."</p>
<p>That philosophy had to change, observers say, as
competitors stole market share from P&G in categories such as
diapers and toothpaste. "P&G got a serious wake-up call,"
says Hugh Zurkuhlen, analyst with Salomon Bros. By making
dramatic changes in advertising, "they're implicitly
admitting that it's no longer a game of producing a better
quality product and flogging it."</p>
<p>While P&G certainly is more adventuresome, it has hardly
embraced the avant-garde styles adopted by other advertisers
in the 1980s. And it has stuck with its traditional roster of
big mainstream ad agencies, rather than giving any of the hot
little boutique agencies a try.</p>
<p>"The ads are livelier . . . and less robotlike," says Gad
Romann, of Romann & Tannenholz Advertising Inc. in New York.
"But they still have a long way to go." He notes that P&G is
still very product driven. "P&G is looking for more
modern-day advertising, yet they keep to their criteria --
persuasion and moving goods."</p>
<p>Some of P&G's ad agencies quietly indicate that getting
the company to sign off on quirky campaigns is still a
daunting task. They say creative executions that challenge
P&G's subdued style are squashed right and left.</p>
<p>An amusing spot for Prell shampoo last week won an Andy
award from the New York Advertising Club, for example, but
P&G didn't give the ad the go-ahead and it will probably
never air.</p>
<p>The ad, created by Leo Burnett Co., shows a macho baseball
pitcher stalling after throwing "ball three" while a packed
stadium whirrs in front of him. The fuming catcher runs out
to the mound and yells, "What are you thinking about out
here?" The guy pulls off his cap and says: "I dunno. I just
don't think this perm looks natural." Not to be outdone, the
catcher responds: "You think you've got problems] Take a look
at these split ends]"</p>
<p>At the awards banquet Thursday night, ad executives
cheered and hooted. But P&G apparently didn't find the spot
funny. "That advertising was really designed to explore
advertising more targeted toward men, but Prell is currently
focusing" on women, a spokeswoman says. The award-winning ad
has been shelved. P&G is continuing instead with a more
subdued campaign: "Prell: The cleaner the rinse, the fuller
your hair."</p>
<p>Similar quirky executions have been shot down on other
brands, including Safeguard soap, an account that P&G
recently yanked from Wells, Rich, Greene Inc. and awarded to
Jordan, McGrath, Case & Taylor Inc. P&G is running a campaign
with a theme of "Safeguard makes it safe enough to get
close," but a new campaign is on the way, ad executives say.</p>
<p>Significant changes already have been made in campaigns
for some P&G products. Consider a new ad for Camay soap that
is being aired in European markets. The commercial describes
how the soap helps women get "ready for love." Hardly the
usual "it makes your skin soft" approach found in P&G's
earlier U.S. Camay ads. European consumers expect commercials
to be more daring; P&G is mum on whether the campaign ever
will be shown in the U.S.</p>
<p>P&G's Crisco ads no longer feature women complaining about
their tough pie crusts. Now the commercials show people
baking gooey chocolate chip cookies or apple pies. There's no
talking, just soothing classical music.</p>
<p>Even Tide detergent, one of P&G's most successful brands,
is getting a face lift in its ads. One new TV commercial for
Tide Liquid detergent uses no spoken copy -- it's just three
kids singing a rap song to their mother.</p>
<p>Solo detergent uses an animated commercial featuring
Popeye cartoon characters, while Crest toothpaste ads feature
animated, singing chimpanzees and fruits. "Could you imagine
10 years ago someone coming into P&G telling them about an ad
with cartoons?" says Mr. Love. "It wouldn't have happened."</p>
<p>Mr. Love says the shift began with two commercials six
years ago. The ads, for Citrus Hill orange juice and Bounce
fabric softener sheets, both featured less copy and more
music. But change came slowly; neither ad remained on the air
for long. One reason: They weren't effective in building
market share. But they "helped encourage our agencies to
break out of the pattern," Mr. Love says.</p>
<p>Then came a witty, award-winning Cheer campaign in 1987
that featured opera music instead of the usual laundryroom
banter. The ad proved that P&G really wanted a change.</p>
<p>P&G, of course, still has its limits. It hates controversy
and is quick to pull an ad campaign if consumers don't
respond well. For instance, ads for Bain de Soleil sun-care
products last year featured a girl in a black bikini, sort of
a miniature of the sultry woman seeking the St. Tropez tan.
Some consumers were outraged, saying the child was too sexy.
The youngster has since been dropped from the ad.</p>
<p>"It's not Procter that is killing the off-the-wall stuff,"
says Richard M. Karp, chief creative officer at Grey
Advertising Inc., which handles several major P&G accounts.
"It's the consumer saying `I don't get it' or `I don't like
it.'"</p>
<p>Indeed, a recent test of a Charmin bathroom tissue ad,
featuring a clown in a bathroom, apparently went too far and
won't be introduced in national markets. Says Mr. Love: "It
was unsuccessful. We were dealing in an area where there are
certain sensitivities. I think the execution missed the
mark."</p>
<p>Some consultants suggest that P&G should be careful not to
stray too far from its conservative roots. Gary Stibel, of
New England Consulting Group, says client studies show that
"the advertising pendulum will swing back from more
image-oriented campaigns to a more product-performance and
information-oriented campaign" in the 1990s."American
consumers have less time and tolerance," he says. "It's the
beginning of a trend that will benefit advertisers like
Procter."</p>
