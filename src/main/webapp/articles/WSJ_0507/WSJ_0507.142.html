	<p class="article-leader">CONCORD, N.H. -- New Hampshire Savings Bank Corp. reported
a first-quarter net loss of $6.7 million, or $1.09 a share,
and warned that its turnaround strategy has "experienced
setbacks in the face of a weakening economy."
   In the year-ago quarter, the thrift reported a net loss of
$6 million, or 97 cents a share. Like other New England
financial institutions, New Hampshire Savings's performance
has been battered by a sluggish economy and floundering real
estate market.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>In the latest quarter, New Hampshire Savings took a
provision for credit losses of $6.4 million, compared to a
$9.4 million provision in the year-earlier quarter. It
currently has a $58.1 million allowance for credit losses,
nearly four times the yearago level.</p>
<p>The bank said that its nonperforming assets now amount to
9.6% of its $1.38 billion in assets. That's three times the
yearago level of nonperformers and slightly wider than the
level three months ago. Its allowance for credit losses is
43.5% of its actual nonperforming assets.</p>
<p>Joseph J. Butare Jr., chairman, said that "our ability to
implement our (turnaround) plan successfully depends on a
variety of factors, many of them beyond our control."</p>
<p>He said that the bank's primary capital ratio declined
slightly to 5.74% from the year-end level, and remained below
the 6% regulatory minimum capital requirement.</p>
<p>He said the bank had asked the Federal Deposit Insurance
Corporation to extend a temporary waiver allowing it to
continue to accept "brokered deposits on which its liquidity
in large part depends."</p>
<p>The bank also said that it has received from the FDIC a
draft consent cease and desist order covering almost all
aspects of its operations. Such orders have been signed by
several troubled area banks.</p>
<p>Mr. Butare said that he is working to reduce the size of
the bank and its costs. He said total assets have been
reduced 10% in the past year; the bank has cut its work force
10% as well.</p>
<p>He added, "We don't expect the economy to rebound in the
near term, and (we) continue to strengthen measures to
safeguard asset quality against what promise to remain
difficult and challenging conditions."</p>
