	<p class="article-leader">VIENNA, Va. -- Perpetual Financial Corp. said it expects
to report a pretax charge of as much as $50 million for its
fiscal second quarter to reflect an additional provision to
its loan-loss reserve and a write-down of foreclosed real
estate.
   In the year-earlier quarter, the thrift holding concern
earned $5 million, or 30 cents a share. The company said it
expects to report results for the latest second quarter,
which ended last Monday, on May 17.</p>
