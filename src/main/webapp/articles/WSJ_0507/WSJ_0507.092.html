	<p class="article-leader">LITTLE ROCK, Ark. -- Dillard Department Stores Inc. said
it agreed to acquire J.B. Ivey & Co. from B.A.T Industries
PLC for $110 million, completing B.A.T's planned sales of its
U.S. retailing units.
   The agreement follows B.A.T's agreements last month to
sell its Saks Fifth Avenue unit to Arab investors for about
$1.5 billion and its Marshall Field's unit to Dayton Hudson
Corp. for about $1.1 billion. The London-based conglomerate,
which put the retailing properties up for sale last September
to fend off a takeover bid by Sir James Goldsmith, will
receive about $2.8 billion from selling the U.S. stores, when
proceeds from the Ivey sale and the John Breuner Co. retail
furniture and rental businesses are included.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Although some in the industry had estimated that B.A.T's
U.S. retail properties could fetch as much as $3 billion, the
company's total take is considered quite high in light of
other retailers' current financial troubles.</p>
<p>For Dillard, the acquisition marks its first expansion
into the Carolinas, where Ivey operates 13 stores, and gives
the company an additional 10 stores in Florida, where it
currently operates just one Dillard outlet. Although the
department-store chain had looked at Saks and bid for
Marshall Field's, analysts say the Ivey stores are the best
fit for Dillard, which operates about 162 department stores,
primarily in the Midwest and Southwest.</p>
<p>The stock market also apparently liked the purchase, as
Dillard's stock climbed $2.50 Friday to close at $75.75 in
New York Stock Exchange composite trading.</p>
<p>James Freeman, Dillard's chief financial officer, said
that the Ivey stores have annual revenue of more than $300
million, largely from the sale of moderate to upscale
apparel. He said that Dillard hasn't yet decided if it will
convert Ivey stores into Dillard department stores.</p>
<p>Dillard, which grew by buying regional chains through the
1980s, will finance the transaction through internally
generated funds and hopes to close the purchase as soon as
possible after regulatory clearance is granted.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the company is expected to continue looking for
possible acquisitions. With Bloomingdale's off the auction
block, Campeau Corp.'s Federated Stores Inc. is expected to
try to sell other regional chains. And Dillard might want to
add stores in Florida, or move into Georgia, where it doesn't
currently have outlets.</p>
<p>"We look at everything that comes along," Mr. Freeman
said.</p>
