	<p class="article-leader">TORRANCE, Calif. -- Toyota Motor Corp.'s Lexus division
said it is raising the base price of its popular LS 400 by
$1,000, to $36,000.
   The 2.9% increase comes less than 10 months after Toyota
introduced the luxury car to the U.S. market. The price of
the LS 400's smaller and less successful sister car, the ES
250, will remain unchanged at a base price of $21,050.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>While Toyota officials said the price increase was
instituted partly to recover higher costs of doing business,
the company is clearly seizing an opportunity to boost
profits on a popular model. Toyota said it has less than a 15
days' supply of LS 400s in the U.S. Demand for the
250-horsepower sedan is accelerating, despite a sluggish
overall market. Since February, the daily selling rate for
the model has risen 21%, to 140 cars per day.</p>
<p>"We knew when we announced our prices last May, we'd have
to evaluate our situation in about a year," said Dave
Illingworth, vice president and general manager of the Lexus
division.</p>
<p>Toyota officials stressed that the LS 400's base price is
still thousands of dollars lower than competitive European
models, such as the $45,950 Mercedes 300 E, as well as
Nissan's $38,000 Infiniti Q45 luxury sedan.</p>
