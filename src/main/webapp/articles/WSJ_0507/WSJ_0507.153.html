	<p class="article-leader">Federated Department Stores Inc. and Allied Stores Corp.
had after-tax losses totaling $2.43 billion in fiscal 1990
after big non-cash charges that include a $1.15 billion
write-down of good will in Federated in the fourth quarter.
   In their Form 10-K filings with the Securities and
Exchange Commission, the Campeau Corp. units attributed the
bulk of their losses to non-cash accounting treatments of
their Chapter 11 bankrupcty status.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Federated's $1.5 billion net loss for the 53 weeks ended
Feb. 3 includes a $1.15 billion write-down of good will,
reflecting the company's "deteriorating financial situation"
during the year. It said further adjustments may be made to
good will during its efforts to restructure and emerge from
Chapter 11 proceedings.</p>
<p>Allied's share of Federated's write-down and equity in
losses at Campeau's Ralphs Grocery Co. chain totaled $660.3
million, bringing its net loss to $925.2 million for the
year. Allied owns 50% of Federated and has direct and
indirect equity stakes in Ralphs, a Southern California
supermarket chain.</p>
<p>In a summary of their 10-K filings, the department store
operators said that despite "extreme pressures" on their
operations in the third and fourth quarters,
comparable-division sales were up by 7.2% to $4.87 billion at
Federated and increased by 5.2% to $2.71 billion at Allied.
They said combined net interest expenses of $806.7 million
took one of the "biggest bites" out of their annual earnings.
The retailers said the write-down of good will and interest
charges had "little or no bearing" on their operations since
they sought Chapter 11 bankrupcty protection on Jan. 15.</p>
<p>Under Chapter 11, a company continues to operate under
court protection from its creditors while it tries to work
out a plan to pay its bills.</p>
<p>In other financial information provided to the U.S.
Bankruptcy Court in Cincinnati, Federated and Allied said
operations continue to improve since January, when many
vendors resumed shipping merchandise to their department
stores. Their net losses for the five weeks ended April 7
totaled $18 million, compared with $48 million for the four
weeks ended March 3. Sales at Federated and Allied in the
latest five weeks were $405.3 million and $234.4 million,
respectively.</p>
<p>In a statement, Allen Questrom, chairman and chief
executive of the retailers, said they have "turned the corner
on stabilizing the business."</p>
<p>"The results do very little other than confirm something
which we already know, namely that Federated and Allied are
sound and reasonably good retailing operations," said Kurt
Barnard, publisher of Retail Marketing Report, a New
York-based industry newsletter.</p>
<p>But the figures also show, he said, that despite their
improving retail health since January, Federated and Allied
can't escape from the "intolerable ocean of debt" Campeau
plunged them into. "That's why we all shuddered when we saw
what Campeau was doing to those stores," Mr. Barnard said.</p>
<p>In its 10-K filing, Federated blamed its financial woes on
the massive debt it was burdened with by Campeau's $6.6
billion highly leveraged buy-out of Federated in May 1988.
"Ultimately, this drain on revenues from the company's
{Federated's} retail operation contributed to cash shortfalls
which precipitated the company's Chapter 11 filing," it said.</p>
<p>Federated said most of its cash interest outlays are
frozen by its Chapter 11 status and it is no longer accruing
annual interest charges of about $200 million on its
unsecured debt. Its interest expense is expected to drop by
between $375 million and $400 million, it said. In fiscal
1990 Federated had interest expense of $516.1 million, it
said. Allied is no longer accruing annual interest of about
$90 million on its unsecured debt. It had net interest
expense of $290.6 million in fiscal 1990.</p>
<p>Federated said it also wrote off $120.5 million of
unamortized deferred financing costs and reorganization
expenses incurred after its acquisition by Campeau. Allied
had $21.6 million in reorganization costs and $138.8 million
in income tax expense.</p>
<p>The units said they had combined cash on hand of $552
million on April 25, and hadn't drawn on a total of $700
million in debtor-in-possession financing available for
working capital needs.</p>
<p>Separately, in an information circular for a special
meeting of holders of its 7 1/2% convertible debentures,
Campeau said it plans to sell a "substantial portion" of its
real estate assets to restructure its own ailing finances.
The circular said Campeau has a "significant negative cash
flow" as a result of its debt-service obligations, and the
assets sales would leave it with a positive cash flow.</p>
<p>The sales are expected to generate enough cash to repay
secured debt on the properties, it said. Secured loans on
other properties would be serviced using cash flow from the
properties, and senior unsecured creditors would begin
receiving payments after "substantial completion" of the
planned asset sales "only to the extent that cash is
available following certain deductions." Campeau also
proposes the accrual of dividends on preferred shares, with
no retractions or redemptions.</p>
<p>Campeau said its investment in and advances to its U.S.
units totaled $1.27 billion as of Jan. 31, and it plans to
participate in their restructuring.</p>
<p>Campeau has 184 million Canadian dollars (US$157.7
million) of 7 1/2% debentures outstanding. At the June 1
meeting, debenture holders will be asked to approve a
resolution to waive existing and future defaults and to defer
interest payable on the debentures until Dec. 31, 1991.
Support for the resolution by holders of two-thirds of the
debentures is almost assured because Campeau Chairman Robert
Campeau and his wife are able to vote 42% of the debentures,
and the Reichmann family's Olympia & York Developments Ltd.
holds another 25.3%.</p>
<p>Campeau defaulted on the debentures in March when it
missed interest payments on that series and $260 million of
convertible debentures held by Olympia & York. Sources close
to the Reichmanns have said previously that Olympia & York
would support the interest deferrals.</p>
