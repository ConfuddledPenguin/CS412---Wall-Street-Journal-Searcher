	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- The Soviet Union has emerged as a major new
market for broilers and may edge out Japan this year as the
traditional No. 1 foreign market for U.S. poultry, according
to U.S. Agriculture Department analysts.
   More than 110 million pounds of broiler leg quarters were
sold to the Soviet Union recently by U.S. companies, a sale
valued at an estimated $50 million.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The Soviets began buying U.S. broilers last fall for the
first time in years. According to the department's Economic
Research Service, the 1989 sales involved about 26 million
pounds.</p>
