	<p class="article-leader">Interco Inc. said its banks agreed to extend to Oct. 1
certain loan payments that were due today, including a $225.9
million payment on its bridge loan.
   Interco, which is suffering from a heavy debt and interest
burden, said the loan waiver extension will allow time to
complete an amendment to its existing bank credit agreement.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The maker of furniture and shoes also said its board will
consider "additional restructuring proposals" at a meeting
Wednesday. It didn't elaborate.</p>
<p>Interco borrowed heavily in late 1988 to pay special
dividends to shareholders and fend off a takeover threat.
Asset sales have been less successful than expected.</p>
