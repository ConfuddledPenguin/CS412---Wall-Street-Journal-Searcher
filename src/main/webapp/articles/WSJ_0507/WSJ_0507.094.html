	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- The mood in the bond market has suddenly
shifted from sour to sweet, increasing the odds that
investors will develop a hearty appetite for the $30.5
billion of Treasury securities to be sold this week.
   The change in sentiment, which was evident after the
Department of Labor released the April employment report
Friday, also means that some interest rates may not exceed
current levels.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"It's kind of crazy to think that one report can create
wild swings" in investor sentiment and interest-rate
expectations, said William Brachfeld, manager of government
trading at Daiwa Securities Inc. But that's exactly what
happened.</p>
<p>And crazy or not, the mood swing is likely to help Uncle
Sam easily auction $10.5 billion of three-year notes
tomorrow. The two other auctions, $10 billion of 10-year
notes Wednesday and $10 billion of 30-year bonds Thursday,
should also run smoothly.</p>
<p>Just a few days ago, sentiment in the bond market was so
ugly that traders were bracing for big trouble at the
auction.</p>
<p>They worried that the Federal Reserve would soon jack up
interest rates in an effort to squash inflation. They warned
that yields on the new Treasury securities would have to
exceed 9% to lure buyers to the record bond sale. They said
the government's bond auction could be a fiasco because
institutional investors, who have seen the value of their
fixed-income portfolios plummet this year, didn't want any
more bonds. Sure, small investors were expected to buy bonds
at the auction because of attractive yields, but their
purchases wouldn't be large enough to ensure the auction's
success, the traders said.</p>
<p>While traders' nightmares could still come true, many
economists believe such concerns are overblown.</p>
<p>The reason: Friday's employment report, which suggested
that the economy is much weaker than previous economic
reports may have indicated. The Labor Department reported
that nonfarm jobs grew by just 64,000 in April. Excluding the
78,000 increase in employment related to temporary census
workers, the April total would actually have declined by
14,000 last month.</p>
<p>The Labor Department also reported that average hourly
earnings rose three cents to $9.95 in April on an adjusted
basis, a sign that labor-cost inflation is well under
control.</p>
<p>The jobs report was widely viewed as a sign that the spike
up in interest rates may be ending. Moreover, economists now
believe that the Federal Reserve will vote to keep interest
rates unchanged at its May 15 meeting of the Federal Open
Market Committee. Prior to the employment report, there was
concern that the Fed would raise rates because other recent
economic reports have suggested that the economy was picking
up and inflation accelerating.</p>
<p>The employment report "reduced the market's fear that the
Fed has to tighten credit policy," said Brian Fabbri, an
economist at Midland Montagu Securities.</p>
<p>Immediately after the data were released, Treasury bond
prices soared and yields eased to the lowest levels in weeks.
The benchmark 30-year bond jumped more than 1 1/2 points, or
$15 for a bond with a $1,000 face amount, while the yield
fell to 8.8%. Two days earlier, the yield had been more than
9%.</p>
<p>Although yields could rise slightly ahead of the auction,
"my guess is that it will be difficult to push the bond back
over 9%, since sentiment has been bolted," said Mr. Fabbri.
He expects yields on new Treasury securities to average 8
7/8%, which he says is attractive enough to lure investors.</p>
<p>Elliott Platt, chief economist at Donaldson, Lufkin &
Jenrette Securities Corp., is urging clients to buy bonds.
"We believe that inflation in the U.S. will be contained at
4.5%-5%. In this context, 30-year Treasury obligations at
roughly 8.8% are offering at least a 3.8% real yield. We
regard that as an extraordinarily high yield for long-term
Treasury obligations."</p>
<p>Dealers are more uncertain about the level of Japanese
participation at the auction. Tokyo markets were closed most
of last week for holidays, so there won't be a good
indication of Japanese demand until today.</p>
<p>Philip Braverman, senior vice president and chief
economist at DKB Securities Corp., a subsidiary of Japan's
Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank, said that Japanese investors should
participate sizably.</p>
<p>"Japanese insurance companies have reportedly decided to
hold the percent of their dollar assets to total assets
stable this fiscal year, implying investment of their premium
income in U.S. Treasurys in the same proportion to their
current dollar asset holdings. This suggests a takedown of
some 30% or so of the Treasury refunding," said Mr.
Braverman. Moreover, Japan's Ministry of Finance and the Bank
of Japan have encouraged Japanese institutions to put in a
"good showing" at the auction, according to Mr. Braverman.</p>
<p>Thomas Sowanick, senior fixed-income strategist at Merrill
Lynch & Co., believes that Japanese participation could be "a
pleasant surprise." He notes that yields on 10-year Treasury
notes are 1.65 percentage points higher than yields on
10-year Japanese government securities. That is up from
March, when the yield-spread was less than 1.20 percentage
points. He says that Japanese investors are flush with cash,
largely from recent bond redemptions. "The combination of
available cash, wider spreads and a stable dollar suggests
that the foreign-sector bid {at the auction} could in fact be
larger than the market is expecting," Mr. Sowanick said.</p>
<p>Mr. Brachfeld also expects Japanese investors to show up
in large numbers at the auction, but he isn't sure whether
that will have a lasting positive impact on the bond market
after the auction. The question, he said, is whether the bulk
of Japanese buyers will be speculators or long-term
investors. While buying by long-term investors could help the
market, speculators may simply buy bonds at the auction and
turn around and dump the securities in the days and weeks
following the auction.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>Friday's Market Activity</p>
<p>The employment report triggered an explosive rally in the
bond market.</p>
<p>The benchmark 30-year Treasury bond rose more than 1 1/2
points, or $15 for a bond with a $1,000 face amount. The
price was quoted late Friday at 96 19/32 to yield 8.81%, up
from 95 1/32 to yield 8.97% on Thursday.</p>
<p>The yield on the benchmark bond, which recently rose above
9% for the first time in nearly a year, edged down to its
lowest level in more than two weeks.</p>
<p>Yields on shorter-term securities fell even faster.
Two-year Treasury notes, which were quoted late in the day at
a price of 100 9/32, compared with 99 27/32 on Thursday, were
yielding 8.698% on Friday, compared with 8.926% on Thursday.</p>
<p>In the corporate bond market, investment-grade bonds
followed the Treasury market. Most issues ended about 1/2
point higher.</p>
<p>Junk bonds however, were little changed. Junk bonds are
high-yield, speculative-graded corporate bonds that have low
credit ratings or no credit ratings at all.</p>
<p>Among Friday's major market movers were the junk bonds of
Greyhound Lines Inc., which sank on news that the strikebound
carrier won't make a semiannual interest payment on its
publicly traded 13% senior notes due May 15. In addition, the
bus company said it had a loss of $55.7 million during the
first quarter, sharply wider than a $14.4 million loss during
the same period a year ago.</p>
<p>Prices of Greyhound's 13% senior notes due in 1995 slid
six points to a bid price of 42. However, dealers said that
very few bonds actually traded hands.</p>
<p>Traders said that activity in the junk bond market was
extremely quiet on Friday, partly because many market
participants were attending Morgan Stanley & Co.'s high-yield
conference in Phoenix, Ariz.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, First Boston Corp. said its junk bond index
produced a positive 0.42% return during the month of April.
First Boston also reported that buy-backs of junk bond debt
hit record levels in the first quarter. The firm said that
about $1.5 billion of junk bonds was bought back by issuers
during the first quarter, and another $1 billion in
high-yield debt was retired.</p>
<p>Ever since the junk bond market went into a tailspin last
September, companies such as Mark IV Industries Inc.,
Burlington Holdings Inc. and Colt Industries Inc. have been
in the market buying back their debt at discounts.</p>
<p>"The market prices that we have now are such that the best
investment companies can make is to buy back their debt at
these levels," said Kingman Penniman, senior vice president
at McCarthy Crisanti & Maffei Inc. "I think as we start
looking at the numbers, and we start seeing the 10-Qs coming
in, we are going to see continued repurchases of debt." A
10-Q is a filing a company makes with the Securities and
Exchange Commission that gives details of earnings and
related financial information.</p>
