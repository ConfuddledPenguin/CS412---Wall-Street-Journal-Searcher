	<p class="article-leader">Adolph Coors Co. plans to test a new corporate ad campaign
that brags about the company's Colorado home and the mountain
spring water it brews into beer.
   Why then is the company shopping outside the state for new
breweries?</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The new television advertisements, which will start this
summer with four small markets, pose the question: "Where was
your beer born?" The 30- and 60-second segments cut back and
forth between quiet scenes of Colorado mountains and streams
and scenes of smokestacks and crowded highways of big cities.</p>
<p>"Clean, fresh, pure Rocky Mountain spring water," the
voice-over says. "Next time you reach for a beer, remember."
Words on the screen boast: "Coors. Great Beers Start Here."
The spots were created by Foote, Cone & Belding
Communications Inc., Chicago. Coors declined to say how much
it plans to spend on the campaign.</p>
<p>The commercials, said Gary Naifeh, Coors vice president,
brand management, "show the contrast of Colorado to other
parts of the country." But, he maintained, the ads aren't
meant to "take a shot at our competition." Coors's biggest
competitors are Anheuser-Busch Cos. of St. Louis and Miller
Brewing Co. of Milwaukee, a unit of Philip Morris Cos. "We
think most people recognize that most places in the country
aren't as nifty as Colorado," he said.</p>
<p>But the timing of the campaign is curious. The ads, which
stress that Coors beers are made in Colorado, come at the
same time the brewer is searching for new brewing capacity
that will likely be outside of its home state. Coors's recent
successful introduction of Keystone, a popular-priced beer,
and double-digit annual growth of Coors Light have pushed the
brewer's production right up against its Golden, Colo.,
brewery capacity of 20 million barrels a year. A deal that
would have given Coors some Stroh Brewery Co. breweries (none
in Colorado) fell apart late last year, but the company is
continuing to look at both Stroh and G. Heileman Brewing Co.
breweries as possible new brewing locations.</p>
<p>The campaign "is self-defeating in the long run because
it's impossible to operate a national brewing company from a
single location," said Robert S. Weinberg, a consultant and
former Anheuser-Busch marketing executive, who also eschews
the emphasis on the spring water. "The water necessary to
brew good beer is available in many, many other places," he
said.</p>
<p>Mr. Naifeh defended the campaign, saying it communicates
"the roots of Coors's heritage, the people, the culture. It's
much deeper than the water." He added that the company "might
be" brewing beer out of the state soon, but "we might be just
packaging beer somewhere else."</p>
<p>Also puzzling is the advent of the campaign at a time
Coors has had phenomenal growth. Its sales grew 6.5% in 1989,
the largest increase among domestic brewers, in a relatively
flat market. "Their key brands are doing well," said Emanuel
Goldman, analyst for PaineWebber Inc., San Francisco. "It's
not clear to me that Coors needs a corporate campaign."</p>
<p>But by starting out in only four markets -- Fresno and
Sacramento, Calif., Erie, Penn., and Rochester, N.Y. -- Coors
isn't gambling a lot of money on the venture, Mr. Goldman
pointed out. "They're going to have an opportunity to find
out it's not going to work before spending a lot of dollars,"
he said. "I think they're going to find out it's not worth
the money."</p>
