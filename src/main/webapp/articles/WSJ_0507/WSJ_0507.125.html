	<p class="article-leader">ADDISON, Ill. -- A defunct U.S. distributor of Daihatsu
Motor Co.'s Hi-Jet off-road vehicles has filed a $11.9
million suit against the Japanese auto maker's U.S.
subsidiary, Daihatsu America Inc. and two of its officers.
   Terrain Vehicles Inc. said it filed the suit in December
in a California state court. The suit alleges that Los
Angeles-based Daihatsu conspired to interfere with Terrain's
contract with Daihatsu in an effort to acquire distribution
rights to Hi-Jet.</p>
