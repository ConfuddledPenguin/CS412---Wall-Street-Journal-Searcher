	<p class="article-leader">MENLO PARK, Calif. -- Mediagenic Inc. expects to post a
year-end loss of $19 million, on revenue of $65 million, and
is considering the possible sale of the company.
   The loss is because of discontinuing certain operations
and damages the company must pay in a patent infringement
case, the company said.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>In March, Mediagenic was ordered to pay as much as $6.4
million in damages, interest and lawyers fee in connection
with a 1986 patent suit by Magnavox Co. Mediagenic is a
publisher of entertainment software formerly known as
Activision.</p>
<p>Mediagenic said it will also discontinue or shrink
unprofitable product lines in the face of a stagnant domestic
market for computer-entertainment software, and strong
competition. The company has retained the investment-banking
firm of PaineWebber Inc. to advise it on ways to find
additional financing and the possible sale of all or part of
the company.</p>
<p>A year earlier, Mediagenic had net income of $1.1 million,
or 28 cents a share, on revenue of $60.6 million.</p>
