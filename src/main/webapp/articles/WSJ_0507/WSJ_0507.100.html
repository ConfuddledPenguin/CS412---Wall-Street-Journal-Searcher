	<h3>Abreast of the Market: One Longtime Bull Believes a Rally Is About to Burst From the Gloom...</h3>

	<p class="article-leader">The stock market sure can be discouraging these days.
   Inflation is at worrisome levels. The bond market has been
slumping all this year, with interest rates high and maybe
headed higher. Corporate profits are lousy. And stock prices
remain stubbornly stuck in a trading range.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>But is it possible that lurking somewhere in the gloom are
the makings of a big rally not too far in the future? Some of
the market's biggest bulls are contending these aren't really
big problems at all. And once that becomes evident to
investors, these optimistic analysts see nothing ahead but
blue sky for stock prices.</p>
<p>"From sometime in the second quarter to sometime in the
second half, we should have a strong move up," says Peter
Canelo, the chief market strategist for Bear, Stearns and a
longtime bull. "We'll break out of this trading range we've
been in and be making new highs by midyear, possibly pushing
the Dow to 3,000 sometime in the second half."</p>
<p>The logic behind Mr. Canelo's ebullience is
straightforward: None of the problems that are bothering
investors are as bad as they seem, and most of them will soon
get a lot better. Corporate profits, for instance, "are not
quite as bad as most people thought they would be and
certainly not as bad as the fourth-quarter profits," he says.</p>
<p>Shrugging off Friday's weaker-than-expected employment
report as just another statistical fluctuation, Mr. Canelo
says recent reports are signaling stepped-up economic growth,
which will turn out to be stronger than most people thought.
That momentum will enhance corporate profits for the second
quarter and beyond.</p>
<p>Key to Mr. Canelo's argument is that he doesn't think the
bond market -- the principal determinant of interest rates --
is nearly as sick as it appears. In part, that's because
inflation isn't as bad as it seems. While prices clearly rose
at an unusually rapid pace in the first quarter, he points
out that oil prices, one of the big factors in that rise, are
falling now along with gold, usually a reliable barometer of
inflation.</p>
<p>And while many worry-warts focus on the consumer price
index, which rose 0.5% in March, Mr. Canelo argues that a
better guide to future inflation rates is the producer price
index, a measure of wholesale inflation that actually fell
0.2% in March.</p>
<p>Some bond bears also complain that the economy is
reaccelerating at a pace that will drive up credit demands,
putting more upward pressure on interest rates, at a time
when the savings-and-loan industry bailout is already forcing
rates up.</p>
<p>Not so, says Mr. Canelo. For one thing, he argues that the
S&L crisis won't result so much in creating new debt as in
replacing individual S&Ls' short-term funding with long-term
debt managed by the government.</p>
<p>And is 3% growth really excessive? "People are arguing
that the economy may be growing at a 2% to 3% annual rate,"
he says. "But in a historical context, that's not even
hitting the average rate of growth we've seen in the past."</p>
<p>All these budding silver linings may become evident in the
next week or so, says Mr. Canelo. Friday's employment
statistics support his argument that the economy is growing
at only a moderate pace. And the Treasury's big $30.5 billion
quarterly refunding auction later this week should
demonstrate that interest rates needn't rise higher to keep
investors interested in the bond market. Once that issue is
settled, stocks will become considerably more attractive, he
says.</p>
<p>"The place to be will be in technology, capital goods and
some of the consumer and basic industry cyclicals," says Mr.
Canelo. Companies in those areas will benefit from continued
U.S. growth, and they stand to be the real winners over the
next several years as European economies begin expanding.</p>
<p>"I don't believe we're going to be supplying Europe with
lots of McDonald's, Coca-Cola and Levis," he says. "What
we're going to be able to provide are Apple computers, Lotus
1-2-3 software, Caterpillar tractors, John Deere agricultural
machinery and Briggs & Stratton motors."</p>
<p>But Mr. Canelo's arguments don't sway nonbelievers. "Bad
news isn't necessarily followed by good news," says Abby
Cohen, market strategist at Barclays de Zoete Wedd in New
York. Indeed, she thinks the stock market has to go down, not
up, to reflect the true investment environment. "It's
remarkable to me that the stock market has been able to stay
in a state of suspended animation as long as it has."</p>
<p>The problems that Mr. Canelo dismisses are precisely the
ones that have convinced Ms. Cohen the market is at
unsustainably high levels. She thinks profits are likely to
remain disappointing for several quarters. Inflation is and
will continue to be a problem, she argues.</p>
<p>"A lot of people presumed that when the economy got
sluggish, they would see inflation come down," she says, "but
that isn't necessarily the case. It takes a pretty good
wallop to the side of the head for an extended period of time
to really reduce inflationary pressures, and we haven't had
that kind of downturn." And that's why the other big problem,
high interest rates, isn't likely to be solved anytime soon,
either.</p>
<p>Ms. Cohen suspects U.S. stock prices have held up, not
because the U.S. outlook is so bright but because it isn't
nearly as bad as the outlook for other markets around the
world. The result is an influx of foreign money into U.S.
financial markets, encouraged by the dollar's relative
strength against other currencies. But can it continue? "Who
knows what happens to the dollar," asks Ms. Cohen. But unless
some unforeseen event comes along, she figures the stock
market is 15% to 20% too high.</p>
<p>Suresh Bhirud, the chief strategist at Oppenheimer,
concurs. A big earnings rebound could make the stock-market
picture a lot brighter, he says, "but it's hard to make a
case that earnings would rise that spectacularly, because
profit margins are under enormous pressure." He says
companies are incurring steadily higher costs, especially
labor costs, that they're unable to pass along in sharply
higher price increases. For example, he notes, Caterpillar's
first-quarter revenue was up 8%, but profit fell nearly 30%.</p>
<p>He also expects interest rates to keep rising as a
consequence of that inflation. His forecast is for the yield
on the Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond to hit 10% later
this year, compared with the current worrisomely high 9%.</p>
<p>Like Ms. Cohen, he suspects stock prices are 15% to 20%
too high. They'll come down, he says, probably in a prolonged
decline. Unless an investor is prepared to weather that kind
of market, cash is king, he says. "In this kind of
environment, how can we recommend stocks?" he asks.</p>

<p>Friday's Market Activity
</p>
<p>Stock prices extended their week-long rally after a
surprisingly weak report on April employment took pressure
off interest rates.</p>
<p>The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 14.19 to 2,710.36.
The close above 2,700 was the first since April 19. Broader
measures fared well, too, and advancing issues on the New
York Stock Exchange outnumbered decliners, 1,020 to 465. For
the week the Dow Jones industrials rose 65.31 points, or
2.5%.</p>
<p>Pfizer fell 7/8 to 57 on 2.3 million shares. The
California Supreme Court cleared the way for a trial in a
lawsuit filed by a recipient of a heart valve manufactured by
Pfizer's Shiley unit. The suit seeks damages for emotional
trauma suffered from having the valve, which was taken off
the market after a number of patients died following ruptures
in the devices. Responding to the ruling, Pfizer noted that
19 similar cases in other jurisdictions have been dismissed
and another 19 have been withdrawn voluntarily.</p>
<p>Actively traded technology stocks posted solid gains.
International Business Machines rose 2 1/2 to 110 1/2 on 1.5
million shares, Compaq Computer advanced 2 1/4 to 103 3/4,
Digital Equipment climbed 1 3/4 to 88 and Hewlett-Packard
rose 3/4 to 44 3/4.</p>
<p>Banking and financial-services stocks also paced the
market's rally, reflecting the sharp decline in rates. Among
bank issues, Citicorp rose 1/2 to 22 3/4 on 1.8 million
shares; J.P. Morgan went up 1 1/8 to 34 3/4; Bank of New York
rose 1 1/8 to 32; and Security Pacific rose 7/8 to 37 3/8. In
financial services, Federal National Mortgage Association
advanced 1 1/8 to 34 7/8, and American Express added 3/8 to
26 7/8.</p>
<p>But Kemper dropped 5/8 to 34 1/2 after a former
public-finance executive with its Prescott, Ball & Turben
unit won a $38.2 million arbitration award in an employee
contract dispute. Kemper said it would take a $19.5 million
charge in the second quarter for the award, although Prescott
will contest the decision.</p>
<p>Several casino issues posted especially sharp gains;
Caesars World fared best by gaining 1 3/8 to 18 7/8, a 7.9%
advance. Golden Nugget gained 1 5/8 to 34 1/8, and Circus
Circus Enterprises added 2 to 54 1/2.</p>
<p>Hibernia went up 1/4 to 16 1/4 on 1.7 million shares, with
one pair of large block trades designed to capture its next
quarterly dividend payment accounting for 1.6 million of the
total. The stock carries a 6.2% dividend yield and went
ex-dividend Thursday.</p>
<p>A strong performance on the London stock market spilled
over into U.S. trading in the shares of a number of
British-based companies. British Petroleum rose 1 7/8 to 63
7/8; British Telecommunications rose 1 1/2 to 43 1/2; British
Gas gained 1 3/8 to 33 5/8; Glaxo Holdings added 3/4 to 26
1/8; SmithKline Beecham firmed 5/8 to 36 1/8; and Shell
Transport & Trading rose 1 1/4 to 45.</p>
