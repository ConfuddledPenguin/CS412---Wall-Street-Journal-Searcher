	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Bernard Chaus Inc. said net income in the
third quarter ended March 31 fell 74%, reflecting
higher-than-normal liquidation of merchandise not shipped to
Campeau Corp. stores last January.
   The women's apparel maker's net fell to $182,000, or one
cent a share, from $691,000, or four cents a share, a year
earlier. Sales fell 10% to $71.4 million from $79.5 million.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>On Friday, Chaus shares closed at $4.875, up 12.5 cents,
in composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange.</p>
<p>The recent Chapter 11 bankruptcy-law filing of Campeau,
parent of Federated Department Stores and Allied Stores, has
hurt many apparel makers that do business with them. Campeau,
based in Toronto, is a major client of Chaus.</p>
<p>First-nine-month net was $295,000, or two cents a share,
compared with a year-earlier loss of $4.5 million, or 24
cents a share. Sales rose 3% to $221 million from $212.7
million.</p>
