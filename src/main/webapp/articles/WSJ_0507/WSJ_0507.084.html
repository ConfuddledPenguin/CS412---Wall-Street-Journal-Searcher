	<p class="article-leader">CHICAGO -- Some of the country's hottest futures market
speculators want to get more bang for their buck on the
Chicago Board of Trade.
   Several large futures fund managers, including Paul Tudor
Jones, one of the most successful U.S. futures traders of the
past decade, want the exchange to as much as double the
number of contracts they can trade in corn, soybean and wheat
futures contracts. The managers say that sharp increases in
position limits are needed to accommodate their funds' rapid
asset growth in recent years.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Raising the speculative limits would boost trading volume,
"adding liquidity and making the markets more efficient,"
says Mr. Jones, who trades $500 million, most of it for
customers, in futures, stock and currency markets world-wide.</p>
<p>But opponents, led mainly by independent pit traders known
as locals, who are often overwhelmed by huge futures fund
trades, say that such a move would also boost volatility in
markets that are already being rocked by the large funds.</p>
<p>Unlike stock market traders, speculators in the futures
markets are limited in the number of futures contracts they
can trade at a particular time in any given market. The
contract limit varies depending on certain factors, including
the trading volume, in each futures contract market.</p>
<p>Responding to written requests from the funds, three
exchange committees last week narrowly approved proposals
that could lead to the doubling of limits for speculators to
24 million bushels for corn and soybeans and 18 million
bushels for wheat. One futures contract is equal to 5,000
bushels of corn, wheat or soybeans, which is roughly the
amount of grain required to fill one railroad boxcar.</p>
<p>A futures contract is an agreement to buy or sell a
specific amount of a commodity at a certain price by a given
date. In practice, most futures contracts are nullified by
opposing trades, so futures traders rarely take delivery of a
physical commodity.</p>
<p>Karsten "Cash" Mahlmann, Board of Trade chairman,
emphasized that proposed increases in the limits are still at
the committee stage within the exchange. "It's premature to
say that there is an exchange position on this," he says.
Whatever proposed increases that emerge from the exchange, a
process that could take several months, need the approval of
the Commodity Futures Trading Commission.</p>
<p>Exchange directors said that some local traders had
threatened to mount a petition opposing the proposed position
limit increases if they were rushed through Board of Trade
committees.</p>
<p>Opponents of increased limits claim that the funds would
make the commodity markets even more volatile than they are
today if the funds could double their market impact. For
evidence of the funds' market clout under existing limits
look no further than this past Tuesday, the opponents say. In
the absence of any significant market-moving news, soybean
futures prices whipsawed up and then down in a
31-cent-a-bushel range before closing five cents a bushel
lower for the day. Futures fund managers, who tend to follow
market trends and buy when markets are rising and sell when
they are falling, were widely singled out by traders and
analysts as the force behind the market move.</p>
<p>"It was a funds day at the Board of Trade," says Conrad
Leslie, founder of Leslie Analytical, a futures research
firm, and a frequent critic of the funds' influence on the
futures markets.</p>
<p>Adds Frederick Uhlmann, senior vice president,
commodities, for Rodman & Renshaw Inc., "We all want a
certain amount of volatility, but these huge fund orders are
very disruptive to the markets."</p>
<p>Total U.S. and foreign speculative futures fund assets are
estimated to have increased at least tenfold over the past
decade to more than $10 billion.</p>
<p>Futures traders are divided into two groups: speculators
and hedgers. Speculators, either individually or as managers
of others' money, trade futures as a bet on relatively
short-term price moves in the commodities or financial
instruments on which the contracts are based. Hedgers, such
as large grain-processing companies, trade futures to offset
potential losses on their inventories. Hedgers are granted
exemptions from position limits as long as they can
demonstrate that their futures trades are tied to the volume
of business they are conducting.</p>
<p>Mr. Jones says that he and other fund managers are mainly
concerned with boosting position limits in just the one or
two most active contract months for each commodity, rather
than raising the total for all contract months. For instance,
most trading activity in soybean futures currently is
concentrated in the July and November contracts for this
year, even though 10 monthly contacts are traded, ranging out
to July 1991.</p>
<p>Current limits in soybeans and corn, however, allow only a
maximum of three million bushels, or 600 contracts, for each
month, with a maximum of four months, or 12 million bushels,
for each commodity. The three-million-bushel limit applies to
each monthly wheat contract as well, but the total limit for
that contract is three months and nine million bushels.</p>
<p>"We could live with the current totals if they would
double the amount we could trade in any one month," Mr. Jones
says.</p>
<p>Because of the relatively large size of most of their
trades, speculative fund managers rarely trade in amounts
approaching their position limits in the less-active months.</p>
<p>The grain futures position limits have forced Mr. Jones
and other futures fund managers increasingly to focus on
financial futures contracts, where position limits are much
larger or even nonexistent. The Board of Trade's Treasury
bond futures contract, for example, has a 10,000 contract
month limit, he says.</p>
<p>"If my choice is between 600 and 10,000 contract limits,
what do you think I'm going to do?" he says.</p>
