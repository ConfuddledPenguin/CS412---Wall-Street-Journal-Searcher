	<p class="article-leader">The French nuclear energy group Framatome S.A. said profit
fell by 30% in 1989 but is expected to show a significant
rebound this year.
   Framatome said the drop in its group profit to 742 million
francs ($131.4 million) from 1.06 billion francs in 1988
reflected the fact that it received payment for only one new
nuclear reactor during the year, down from three in 1988.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Group revenue rose to 19.9 billion francs from 10.8
billion over the same period, but Framatome noted that this
gain reflected the billing of a Superphenix generator that
hasn't yet had any impact on its profits.</p>
<p>Looking ahead, Framatome said that "results for the year
1990 should show a significant improvement with the billing
of three new nuclear reactors and the favorable evolution of
profits from connecting rods activities." It didn't
elaborate.</p>
<p>Framatome is controlled by the French government and
doesn't have any publicly traded voting securities.</p>
