	<p class="article-leader">TORONTO -- Jeremy Garbutt, president and chief operating
officer of Horsham Corp., said the company plans to exercise
an option later this year to raise its interest in Clark Oil
& Refining Corp. to 75% from 60% currently.
   "Our ultimate objective is to have 100% of Clark," Mr.
Garbutt said after a meeting with analysts.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Horsham officials wouldn't comment on a possible price for
the additional Clark stake. However, a Horsham spokesman said
a 1989 independent appraisal put a value of $550 million on
Clark's physical assets alone.</p>
<p>Mr. Garbutt said Horsham, a Toronto investment concern,
can exercise its option to acquire an additional 25% of Clark
anytime after Oct. 26. At the same time, he said, Clark's
minority holders can elect to purchase 10% of Horsham for $10
million. He said the net result would give Horsham a 75%
interest in Clark, a St. Louis oil refiner and marketer.</p>
<p>Mr. Garbutt said that, under the option agreement, the
price of the 25% Clark stake will be 10% below a "fair
valuation" as determined by independent valuators. Further
increases in Horsham's stake beyond 75% are subject to
negotiation with the minority holders, he said.</p>
<p>Clark's minority holders are Anthony Novelly and Samuel
Goldstein, principals of Clark's former parent, Apex Oil Co.</p>
