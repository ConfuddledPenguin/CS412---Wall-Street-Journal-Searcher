	<p class="article-leader">FRANKFURT -- West Germany's status as Europe's high-cost
production site was garnished Friday when management was
backed into a pact giving more money to 3.7 million
metalworkers -- for less work.
   Negotiators for the IG Metall metalworkers union and
employers in the bellwether district of Stuttgart settled on
a reduction of the official workweek in stages by two hours
to 35 hours by 1995. Metalworkers also will receive a 6% wage
increase effective from April 1, plus a one-time bonus of 240
marks ($142.64) for each of the 700,000 workers in the
region's metalworking, automotive and computer industries.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Representatives from the national organizations of the
union and management later agreed to the basic terms of the
Stuttgart agreement, assuring its adoption nationwide after
other regional negotiators had been awaiting the outcome.</p>
<p>IG Metall, after staging a series of warning strikes last
week, scheduled more work stoppages in the other districts
for today to force quick replica agreements.</p>
