	<p class="article-leader">A Los Angeles judge invalidated regulations implementing a
key aspect of Proposition 103, giving the insurance industry
another victory in its legal attack on the reformist voter
initiative.
   The regulations attempted to limit the ability of
insurance companies to use place of residence when computing
automobile insurance rates for the state's 16 million insured
drivers. The issue is hot in California, where motorists in
urban centers can pay several times the rate for suburban and
rural drivers, and was a major driving force behind the voter
revolt that resulted in Proposition 103's passage in November
1988. Proponents also believe that insurers have used such
"territorial pricing" to discriminate against the poor and
minorities.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>But Superior Court Judge Miriam Vogel preliminarily
enjoined the regulations, finding that they conflicted with a
separate provision of Proposition 103 that prohibits
"excessive, inadequate or discriminatory" rates. Insurance
companies had argued that limiting their ability to
incorporate territory-related factors in setting rates would
be unfair because they are valid in determining potential
losses.</p>
<p>"This strikes at the very core of Proposition 103," said
Karl Rubenstein, special counsel to the state insurance
commissioner, who said he plans to appeal the decision. "Our
major complaint over the ruling is that it is not based on
any ascertainable facts" that the new regulations would have
caused insurers actual losses.</p>
<p>"It is a travesty of justice," added Harvey Rosenfield, a
Los Angeles consumer activist who organized the initiative's
campaign drive.</p>
<p>Reflecting the intent of Proposition 103's framers, the
regulations ordered insurers to fix rates primarily based on
driving record, experience and annual mileage driven, an
approach that is at odds with rate-making policies used by
most insurance companies across the country. The regulations
also barred insurers from using gender or age in computing a
rate, but the judge rejected that position, too, citing
evidence that such factors were actuarially valid in
predicting future accidents.</p>
<p>The immediate effect of the decision is that the state's
automobile insurers can ignore a deadline of this Friday when
new rating plans in accordance with the regulations were
originally due. Judge Vogel said insurers could continue to
use their old rates, but continued a temporary freeze that
state insurance regulators ordered last October.</p>
<p>Some observers said they expected the industry, having
incurred losses in the hundreds of millions of dollars since
the initiative's adoption, to begin pushing for emergency
rate increases in court. But such efforts didn't appear
imminent. For instance, Marc Fairman, a San Francisco lawyer
for Allstate Insurance Co., said, "We may at some point ask
for preliminary relief while we work through the
administrative process."</p>
<p>The decision also ensures months of additional legal
warfare over the initiative, which, because of its own
ambiguous language, regulatory delays and industry legal
challenges, has stalled short of expectations since its
passage 18 months ago. For instance, Proposition 103's most
highly publicized feature, a 20% rollback in rates, was
undermined by a state Supreme Court decision last year.</p>
<p>"The commissioner is going to have a very difficult time
writing regulations that are constitutional, nonconfiscatory
and don't violate other provisions of the laws," predicted
Jessica Pers, a San Francisco lawyer for State Farm Mutual
Automobile Insurance Co., the state's largest automobile
insurer.</p>
<p>Judge Vogel's decision, if upheld, could be potentially
good news for nonurban drivers in the state. Insurance
companies had argued that the new regulations, while likely
to force down rates in urban areas, would cause large,
offsetting increases elsewhere. Indeed, State Insurance
Commissioner Roxani Gillespie, herself fearful of big rate
increases, had ordered a rate ceiling as part of the
regulations, which was also struck down as part of Judge
Vogel's order.</p>
<p>But Mr. Rosenfield and other proponents maintained that
any increases would be confined mostly to bad drivers, and
that rates in general would decline as stricter regulation
under Proposition 103 made insurers more efficient.</p>
<p>"It is certainly a problematically written piece of
legislation which has ambiguities and inconsistencies," added
Mr. Rubenstein. "But we felt that the regulations validly
implemented the spirit and intent of the law."</p>
