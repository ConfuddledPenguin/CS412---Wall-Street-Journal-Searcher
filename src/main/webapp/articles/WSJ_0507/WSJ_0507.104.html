	<p class="article-leader">RIO DE JANEIRO -- The Brazilian government has begun
fulfilling its promise to liberalize its restrictive trade
practices by allowing the import of several hundred
previously prohibited products and opening up its market for
telephone equipment.
   But trade experts warned there's less to the change than
meets the eye because the government is slapping high import
duties on most products in order to protect its domestic
industry. Cars, for instance, will face import duties of 85%;
once local taxes are added on, a foreign car will cost 215%
of its original price, according to the National Association
of Auto Makers. Previously, the duty on cars was 65% -- but
importers also had to get an import license, which was almost
never granted.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Moreover, government officials indicated that imports
would only be allowed in a first phase within the limits of
Brazil's foreign-exchange reserves, which amounts to a form
of quota. In addition, a number of products still remain
fully shielded from foreign competition, including computers,
arms and munitions, defoliants and "habit-forming substances"
such as cigarettes.</p>
<p>Still, trade analysts welcomed the move as a step in the
right direction. "Getting into the tariff business rather
than imposing non-tariff barriers is a big step," said a
diplomat who follows trade matters.</p>
<p>Brazil's move is likely to be well received in Washington,
which recently said it would remove Brazil from its list of
trade violators -- known as the Super 301 and Special 301
provisions of the 1988 Trade Act -- but said it would keep
the country on a Priority Watch List while monitoring whether
newly installed president Fernando Collor de Mello's acts
match his free-trade talk. Brazilian officials say they hope
to scrap all barriers and cut tariffs over the next two
years.</p>
<p>Analysts noted that the announcement of Brazil's trade
liberalization coincided with Economics Minister Zelia
Cardoso de Mello's departure for Washington to attend the
Interim Committee meetings of the International Monetary Fund
and the World Bank, and appear designed to gain financial
backing for the sweeping anti-inflation plan Mr. Collor has
implemented. Brazil, whose $115 billion foreign debt is the
developing world's largest, is planning to resume
negotiations with its creditors within weeks.</p>
<p>Brazil has repeatedly come under fire from its trading
partners for being one of the most protectionist countries in
the world. In a bid to develop its domestic industry, the
then-military government of General Ernesto Geisel in 1975
issued a list of 4,000 items whose import was "temporarily
suspended," running from perfume to automobiles. Although the
list has since been brought down to about 1,200 items, the
"temporary suspension" has survived until now.</p>
<p>When he took office on March 15, Mr. Collor said the
country's protectionist policies have made it lag behind its
trading partners in terms of technology, quality and cost,
and vowed change. On his first full day in office, he
repealed the list of prohibited imports, but the repeal was
made inoperative by Brazil's failure to announce new import
tariffs.</p>
<p>Friday's decision marks a first step in that direction by
setting tariffs on 308 goods, ranging from chemicals -- with
tariffs going from 40% to 85% -- to such products as kitchen
appliances and white goods (generally 60% tariffs), hi-fis
and videos (85%), cars and trucks (85%) and toys (105%).</p>
<p>Government officials expect the trade measures to lead
Brazil to import about $1 billion more than in 1989, when the
country posted a trade surplus of $16 billion. Officials say
the trade liberalization has two aims: In the short-term,
Economy Secretary Joao Maia told the business daily Gazeta
Mercantil, imports will be a "powerful instrument" against
speculative price rises and shortages of goods that have
doomed past Brazilian anti-inflation packages. And over the
longer term, he said, it will destroy the cartels that
dominate much of Brazilian industry and restrict competition.
"Whoever doesn't have international standards of price and
quality must either change or die," he said.</p>
<p>Brazil's government will take a first step toward breaking
up cartels by scrapping a law restricting the telephone
equipment market to the local subsidiaries of Telefon AB L.M.
Ericsson of Sweden, Siemens AG of West Germany and NEC Corp.
of Japan, officials say.</p>
<p>In 1978, the three had won the exclusive rights to install
800,000 terminals in Brazil, but continued to dominate the
market after the contract was fulfilled, installing more than
two million terminals at nearly twice the cost of the
international market, according to Communications Secretary
Joel Rauber. The government also last week said it was
studying how to attract more foreign auto makers to spur
competition.</p>
