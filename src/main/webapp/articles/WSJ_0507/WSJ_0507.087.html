	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- World sugar futures prices in London and New
York plunged 7% in hectic trading Friday after a major
London-based commodities firm slashed its estimate of how
much world sugar production would fall below consumption this
year.
   The report was released too late to affect the morning
session on the London Futures and Options Exchange. But in
afternoon trading, the price for the most-active October 1990
contract fell $23.60 a metric ton to $324.40, or nearly 7%.
The drop was equal to 1.07 cents a pound; a metric ton is 1.1
U.S. short tons, or 2,204.6 pounds.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>London's markets will be closed today for a bank holiday.</p>
<p>On the Coffee, Sugar and Cocoa Exchange in New York, the
soonest-to-expire and most-active July 1990 futures contract
sank more than 7%, or 1.16 cents a pound to 14.44 cents.
During the volatile session, it traded as high as 15.58 cents
and as low as 14.25.</p>
<p>The New York decline was the biggest for a single day
since July 26, 1988, when the October 1988 contract dropped
2.41 cents to 12.06 cents from 14.47 cents, according to an
exchange spokeswoman. Total world futures trading volume
surged to an estimated 75,971 contracts, she said, topping
the previous record of 59,989 contracts set on July 6, 1989.</p>
<p>E.D. & F. Man (Sugar) Ltd. radically reduced its estimate
of how much world production will fall short of consumption
for the 1989-90 season, ending Aug. 31, to 258,000 metric
tons from its previous estimate in January of 1.46 million
tons. That 82% reduction in the shortfall would still result
in the fifth consecutive season of production deficits.</p>
<p>The firm arrived at its latest estimate by raising
predicted output to 106.9 million tons from 106.5 million
tons forecast in January and by reducing its consumption
projection to 107.1 million tons from its previous estimate
of 108.0 million tons.</p>
<p>While output increased in some producing countries, E.D. &
F. Man said, these gains were more than offset by declining
use of the sweetener in other countries, mostly because
prices had climbed too high. This reduced consumption, the
firm said, stifled "the prospects of future price increases."</p>
<p>Production in both China and India gained while domestic
consumption slowed. In the Soviet Union, good output and
rationed consumption reduced import requirements, the firm
said.</p>
<p>"The initial forecasts of a massive shortfall have thus
been eradicated," E.D. & F. Man said, adding that the sugar
market is gradually moving "toward more volatile times."</p>
<p>New York analysts didn't attribute the severe price drops
solely to E.D. & F. Man's revised estimate. They noted that
its January projection for the deficit had been far greater
than those of other analysts, which generally ranged around
500,000 tons. Now, one commented, "They are on the other side
of the fence" with one of the smallest deficit estimates.</p>
<p>Judith Ganes, analyst for Merrill Lynch, New York, noted
that the market last week had failed to hold an advance of
more than 16 cents a pound, primarily because there was
little demand for physical sugar in the world market. "The
market was ripe for a decline," she said.</p>
<p>Friday's development, however, she said, "may have been a
necessary evil," in that the lower prices the report helped
bring about may make sugar more attractive to potential
buyers. She noted that Yemen would be in the market to buy an
unspecified quantity of sugar and that Mexico may be seeking
to buy 200,000 tons.</p>
<p>The part of the London firm's revision concerning reduced
consumption wasn't a complete surprise, because events had
already been suggesting as much. Higher prices have recently
been meeting resistance from developing nations, London
analysts said.</p>
<p>Poorer countries such as India, China, Iran, Morocco and
Mexico account for about 80% of imports from the
international free market, and they can't afford to spend
scarce foreign exchange on large-scale pricey sugar imports,
said Farideh Bromfield, head of research of E.D. & F. Man.</p>
<p>Sugar has been one of the most buoyant commodities in the
past year, rising about 50% to 15.5 cents a pound, mainly
because of the persistent shortfall between production and
consumption. A recent increase in the U.S. sugar import
quota, which will draw additional supplies from the
already-tight world market, also was a price-firming factor,
they noted.</p>
<p>Looking ahead to other commodity markets this week:</p>
<p>Grains and Soybeans: Expectations of continued export
demand are likely to support futures prices for the
foreseeable future, analysts said. Traders also are awaiting
Thursday's government crop report for additional information
about the size of corn, wheat and soybean crops that may move
futures prices, although no surprises are expected, analysts
said.</p>
<p>Energy: Many traders were puzzled about the energy
market's reaction to the pledge last week by OPEC's oil
ministers to cut their combined output around 1.5 million
barrels a day in an effort to prop up prices. Few are certain
about this week's market direction.</p>
<p>Last Thursday, after the Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries wrapped up its emergency session in less
than two days, traders drove down the prices of crude oil,
gasoline and heating oil in frenzied activity. Market
participants said they were disappointed that OPEC didn't
accomplish anything more than reducing its production back to
its official quota level of 22.08 million barrels a day.</p>
<p>But on Friday, with crude oil still weak, gasoline futures
soared on rumors of production problems at a number of big
U.S. refineries. The strength in gasoline contracts propped
up crude futures, with West Texas Intermediate for June
delivery ending down just one cent a barrel, at $17.98, on
the New York Mercantile Exchange. June gasoline ended up 1.44
cents, at 61.12 cents a gallon. Because of the topsy-turvy
trading at the end of last week, traders say they aren't sure
what market forces will drive prices this week.</p>
