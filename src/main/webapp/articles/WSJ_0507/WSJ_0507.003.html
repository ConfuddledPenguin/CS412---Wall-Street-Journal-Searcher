	<p class="article-leader">HOUSTON -- Marathon Oil Co., a USX Corp. subsidiary, said
an exploration well in the Celtic Sea produced 1,600 barrels
of oil a day on a one-half inch choke, plus 5.4 million cubic
feet of natural gas.
   The well, which is located on block 48/24 about 16 miles
southwest of the Kinsale Head Gas Field, was drilled in 331
feet of water to a depth of 8,475 feet, Marathon said. The
well has been temporarily abandoned while results are being
further evaluated, the company said.</p>
