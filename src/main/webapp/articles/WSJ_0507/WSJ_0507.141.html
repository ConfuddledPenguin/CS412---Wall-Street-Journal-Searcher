	<p class="article-leader">D. Leonard Wise, a tough-minded veteran of the steel
business, is likely to be tapped to lead Wheeling-Pittsburgh
Steel Corp. in the company's post-bankruptcy era.
   The 55-year-old Mr. Wise, elected vice chairman in March,
is expected to be named chief executive, succeeding
turnaround expert William J. Scharffenberger after the
company's reorganization plan has been approved. That should
occur this fall, after the company and United Steelworkers of
America reach an accord.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Although the move must be approved by directors of the
reorganized company, Mr. Wise appears to have the backing of
management and the company's largest creditor, a group led by
New York investor Ronald LaBow, which would own 50% of the
new Wheeling-Pittsburgh.</p>
<p>At a recent meeting of company plant foreman and
superintendents at Pittsburgh's Three Rivers Club, Mr. Wise
joined chief operating officer James L. Wareham at the
podium, an arrangement that the workers took as a signal of a
new era. "Wise was the one who gave a sort of half-time pep
talk," says one union official. "Everyone was asking,
`Where's Scharffenberger?'" Mr. Wareham, who was hired last
year, is expected to continue as chief operating officer.</p>
<p>Mr. Scharffenberger says it is premature to speculate
about a new CEO, but says Mr. Wise has been working closely
with him on the final stages of reorganization and with Mr.
Wareham on operations. "We have two very talented and
compatible executives and I feel I've done my duty in
attracting them," he says. Mssrs. Wise and Wareham declined
to comment.</p>
<p>Wheeling-Pittsburgh hopes that Mr. Wise, known for his
no-nonsense style and steady, firm hand, will bring stability
to the nation's eighth-largest steelmaker. In the five years
since filing for Chapter 11 protection, Wheeling-Pittsburgh
has seen three different chief executives and four chairmen.</p>
<p>The task will be even more difficult because it is a tough
time to bring calm to a steelmaker. The industry enters the
1990s high from a three-year expansion, but bracing for
flattening demand and increased competition. Only those
steelmakers who invest heavily in new technology and create
new markets are expected to survive. The challenge may be
even tougher for a company that has been somewhat spoiled by
bankruptcy protection and must resume burdensome interest and
pension payments. Wheeling-Pittsburgh owes the Pension
Benefit Guaranty Corp. $85 million.</p>
<p>"This company won't be able to report profits in the same
magnitude as in the past," concedes Mr. Scharffenberger.
"We're vulnerable."</p>
<p>Mr. Wise learned the business at Bethlehem Steel Corp.,
then at the former Jones & Laughlin Steel Corp., and most
recently as president of Toronto's Slater Industries Inc.
Thomas Graham, the president of USX Corp.'s steel operations
and former CEO of Jones & Laughlin, says he has "high regard
and respect for Len's leadership and executive capabilities."</p>
<p>Mr. Wise proved his mettle in the late 1970s, when he took
over Jones & Laughlin's troubled Indiana Harbors Works. At
the time, the complex was floundering, with monthly losses of
up to $10 million. He turned the operation around, holding
mill superintendents responsible for costs, forging
cooperative labor agreements and using equipment more
efficiently. "He provided absolute first-rate direction," for
that plant, says Mr. Graham.</p>
<p>The task could prove equally daunting at
Wheeling-Pittsburgh. The company is much stronger than it was
five years ago, having renegotiated lower raw material and
labor contracts, and closed a huge rail plant. It even
outperforms its larger competitors in some areas: More than
90% of its steel is continuously cast, compared with an
industry average of 64%. And earnings per ton of steel
shipped reached $58 last year, compared with $39 a ton for
the other major steelmakers.</p>
<p>But labor costs will undoubtedly rise when the company
emerges from bankruptcy protection. And the company has less
flexibility than its larger competitors to close down lines
for maintenance and produces fewer tons of steel to offset
the high cost of modernizing plants.</p>
<p>Christopher Plummer, an analyst with WEFA Group, says the
company needs to update its tin mill operations and expand
the more profitable, albeit highly competitive,
electrogalvanizing operations to keep pace with others
steelmakers. Mr. Wise is also expected to expand the
relatively new corrugated steel operations, which make roofs
and sidings for the construction industry, to protect that
niche market.</p>
<p>"If a company is going to survive, it has to ante up with
these investments," Mr. Plummer says. "That may be somewhat
difficult for Wheeling-Pittsburgh."</p>
<p>Even steelmakers who have never been close to bankruptcy
find it difficult to borrow needed capital. Upon emerging
from Chapter 11, Wheeling-Pittsburgh will have a higher debt
load than its competitors, so it will be extremely hard for
it to issue new debt. And it can't expect to raise money
through equity until investors feel confident in a new
management team.</p>
<p>"They need to establish a track record for the company,"
Mr. Scharffenberger says of Mssrs. Wise and Wareham. "They
have to spend capital money wisely and that's going to take a
lot of good judgment."</p>
