	<p class="article-leader">Following is Latvia's declaration of independence, adopted
Friday:</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The independent state of Latvia, founded on Nov. 18, 1918,
was granted international recognition in 1920 and became a
member of the League of Nations in 1921. The Latvian nation's
right to self-determination was implemented in April 1920
when the people of Latvia gave their mandate to the
Constituent Assembly chosen by universal, equal, direct and
proportional elections. In February 1922 the Assembly adopted
the Constitution of the Republic of Latvia which is still in
effect "de jure." The ultimatum of June 16, 1940, from the
Stalinist government of the U.S.S.R. to the Latvian
government, and the following military aggression,
occupation, annexation and the liquidation of the statehood
of Latvia, constitute international crimes. The new
government of Latvia was formed by the dictate of the
government of the U.S.S.R. According to international law,
this government did not represent the executive authority of
the sovereign Republic of Latvia, since it represented the
interests of the U.S.S.R. instead of those of Latvia.</p>
<p>The elections of June 14 and 15, 1940, to the Parliament
(Saeima) of occupied Latvia, were held under conditions of
political terror after an illegal and unconstitutional
election law had been adopted. Of the 17 lists of candidates
submitted, only one was permitted in the elections -- the
list of the Working People's Bloc. The pre-election platform
of this bloc did not include any demand to establish Soviet
power in Latvia or to join the Soviet Union. Moreover, the
results of the elections were falsified. Thus, the illegally
and fraudulently formed parliament did not represent the
governmental system and liquidated the sovereignty of Latvia.
Only the people had the right to decide on these matters, but
no free referendum was held. Hence, according to
international law, the incorporation of Latvia into the
Soviet Union is invalid. Thus, the Republic of Latvia
continues to exist de jure as a subject of international law
and is recognized as such by more than 50 nations of the
world.</p>
<p>Taking into account the "Declaration on the Sovereignty of
the Latvian State" adopted by the Supreme Soviet of the
Latvian S.S.R. on July 28, 1989; the "Declaration on the
Question of the Independence of the Latvian State," adopted
by the Latvian Supreme Soviet on Feb. 15, 1990, and the
Appeal of the All-Latvia Meeting of People's Deputies of
April 21, 1990;</p>
<p>Observing the will of the inhabitants of Latvia, which was
unmistakably expressed by the election of a majority of
deputies to the Latvian Supreme Soviet who had expressed a
determination to restore the independence of the Republic of
Latvia;</p>
<p>Being determined to restore "de facto" the free,
democratic and independent Republic of Latvia;</p>
<p>The Supreme Soviet of the Latvian S.S.R. decides:</p>
<p>1. Recognizing the supremacy of the fundamental principles
of international law over national law, to consider illegal
the treaty of August 23, 1939, between the U.S.S.R. and
Germany, and the subsequent liquidation of the sovereignty of
the Republic of Latvia on June 17, 1940, which was the result
of Soviet military aggression.</p>
<p>2. To declare invalid from the moment of its adoption the
decision by the Parliament of Latvia "On the Republic of
Latvia's joining the U.S.S.R." of July 21, 1940.</p>
<p>3. To re-establish the authority of the Constitution of
the Republic of Latvia adopted by the Constituent Assembly on
February 15, 1922, in the entire territory of Latvia. The
official name of the Latvian state is "The Republic of
Latvia," abbreviated as "Latvia."</p>
<p>4. Until the adoption of a revised constitution, to
suspend the Constitution of the Republic of Latvia, except
for the articles expressing the constitutional and legal
foundation of the Latvian state, which according to Article
77 of the Constitution can be changed only by popular
referendum:</p>
<p>Article 1 -- Latvia is an independent, democratic
republic.</p>
<p>Article 2 -- The sovereign power of the Latvian state
belongs to the people of Latvia.</p>
<p>Article 3 -- The territory of the Latvian state shall
consist of Vidzeme, Latgale, Kurzeme and Zemgale, within the
boundaries stipulated by international treaties.</p>
<p>Article 6 -- The Saeima is elected by universal, equal,
direct and secret vote on the basis of proportional
representation.</p>
<p>The application of Article 6 will follow the renewal of
those state and administrative structures of Latvia which
guarantee free elections.</p>
<p>5. To set a transition period for the reestablishment of
the de facto independence of the Republic of Latvia, which
will conclude with the convening of the Parliament of Latvia.
During the transition period the supreme power in Latvia is
held by the Supreme Soviet of the Republic of Latvia.</p>
<p>6. During the transition period, to consider it possible
to preserve those constitutional and other legislative acts
of the Latvian S.S.R. already in effect in Latvia at the time
this Declaration is adopted, insofar as they do not
contradict Articles, 1, 2, 3 and 6 of the Constitution of
Latvia.</p>
<p>7. To form a commission for revising the Constitution of
the Republic of Latvia so that it corresponds to the present
political, economic and social situation in Latvia.</p>
<p>8. To guarantee citizens of the Republic of Latvia and
those of other nations permanently residing in Latvia social,
economic and cultural rights and political freedoms which are
consistent with universally recognized international
standards of human rights. This is fully applicable to those
citizens of the U.S.S.R. who express the desire to continue
living in the territory of Latvia.</p>
<p>9. To develop relations between Latvia and the U.S.S.R. in
accordance with the Peace Treaty between Latvia and Russia of
August 11, 1920, which is still in force and which recognizes
the independence of Latvia for all time. To establish a
Government Commission for conducting negotiations with the
U.S.S.R.</p>
<p>This act takes effect from the moment of its adoption.</p>
