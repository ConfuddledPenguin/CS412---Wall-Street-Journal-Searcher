	<h3>Enterprise: When Owners of Family Businesses Die, Survivors Often Feel Unsuited to Fill Void</h3>

	<p class="article-leader">The death of an entrepreneur leaves a hole in the heart of
the business. That void lingers painfully no matter who steps
in to take charge, but it's especially difficult for the
reluctant, grieving successor.
   The survivor thrust into the role often feels
ill-prepared, awkward and undeserving of the mandate to run
things. At the same time, "the business is struck by the loss
and becomes self-doubting and paralyzed," says John Ward,
professor of private enterprise at Loyola University in
Chicago. It can take years for the individual and business to
adjust to each other.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Consider the difficulty Cafe Provencal is having following
the recent death of its acclaimed chef and founder Leslee
Reis. For years, her exuberant personality lent a cultured
cachet to the dining room of the elite French restaurant in
Evanston, Ill. Her culinary tastes and expertise propelled it
to national critical praise. Its reputation hinged largely on
her image.</p>
<p>Now, her widower, Andy Reis, the restaurant's
behind-the-scenes general manager, finds himself struggling
to assume a more visible role. Pressure is growing to
convince customers and critics that they can enjoy themselves
as much there now as before. The top chef questions some of
Mr. Reis's menu choices. And business has dropped off, as the
shadow of Ms. Reis's death amplifies effects of a general
restaurant-industry slump.</p>
<p>Despite Mr. Reis's ideas for marketing the place, he
admits, "I don't know if we'll find another Leslee."</p>
<p>Problems arise in large part because many entrepreneurs do
little planning to help ease the burden for heirs. Laventhol
& Horwath, an accounting firm that has twice surveyed owners
of family businesses, found in a 1988 poll that fewer than
half -- 45% -- had selected successors. Only one in three had
put together a strategic plan.</p>
<p>As a result, a surviving family member may feel pressed
into service out of guilt -- or to prevent damage to the
company. In such instances, "there's a greater potential for
all sorts of unwise decisions because people are likely to
act out of guilt or panic," says Glenn Swogger, a Topeka,
Kan., psychiatrist who counsels people with family
businesses.</p>
<p>What's more, the twin stresses of handling grief and
stepping into a business cold take a huge emotional toll.
Last year, Shirley Sage found herself in charge of her
family's farm holdings in Lytton, Iowa, after her husband
died during cultivating season. Though friends and family
helped a lot, and she rented out the land rather than working
it herself, she says she still feels worn out.</p>
<p>"It's a kind of exhaustion I've never felt {before}," she
says. "You go to sleep and wake up and feel as if you've
never slept."</p>
<p>Even business owners who plan for succession often
overlook issues that may eventually tear apart their
companies -- or families. Richard A. Kuenster, a Chicago tax
lawyer, says the co-owner of a local laundromat wanted to
leave his share to his two sons. He planned for them to
inherit his stake over a period of five years and assumed
they would get along with their uncle, his father's partner.
But after the father died, the uncle objected to the sons'
plans to modernize the business -- and bought out their
shares instead.</p>
<p>"Nothing in the plan said what should happen if they
didn't get along," says Mr. Kuenster.</p>
<p>Survivors often find themselves facing creditors who doubt
their business abilities. When Jack Skinner took over his
family's nursery business in Topeka after his father's death,
he was shocked to learn the extent of the company's financial
troubles: It had been losing money for three years. Payments
on bank loans and other debts were overdue. And personal
assets intended to provide for his mother and aunt were
pledged as collateral for the business debt.</p>
<p>The crisis intensified when a banker called to request a
family meeting. The lender told Mr. Skinner and relatives
that he believed their business could make it -- and he'd
foreclose unless they sold out quickly. As demands from
creditors mounted, the company filed for Chapter 11
protection -- just a month after the owner's death.</p>
<p>Mr. Skinner and a cousin later bought some of the
company's assets to start their own nursery -- one that's
much smaller than the original company. Mr. Skinner says his
business is barely profitable now, but he hopes that it
eventually will be able to help support his mother and aunt.</p>
<p>Customers can present problems by trying to take advantage
of successors' inexperience. Peter Hushek's father suffered a
fatal stroke while holding a party for the family's company,
in Phoenix, Ariz., which provides heat-treating service to
the metal-working industry. Within weeks of succeeding his
father as president, the shaken 30-year-old son faced the
company's most costly service problem ever: It had ruined
part of a customer's product by giving it the wrong
treatment, and the customer demanded $20,000 to cover the
damage.</p>
<p>Mr. Hushek, who hadn't handled such matters while working
for his father, felt at a loss. "You can plan as much as you
want {for a death}, but whenever it happens, you are caught
off guard," he says. He wandered through his plant, reluctant
to consult underlings, missing his father and wondering what
to do. He finally opted to offer a credit of more than
$10,000 in hopes of keeping the customer. The strategy worked
-- though Mr. Hushek still struggles to win the confidence of
longtime suppliers.</p>
<p>Employees, too, will try fooling their newly installed
boss, much like schoolchildren with substitute teachers. A
former housewife says that after she stepped in to run her
late husband's Midwestern manufacturing company, some top
executives tried to take advantage of her ignorance. The
woman, who requested anonymity because the people still work
for her, says they didn't inform her about a joint venture
they were negotiating with a Japanese supplier.</p>
<p>The executives surprised her with a proposed deal that
would have awarded them a large stake in the venture, even
though they weren't putting up capital; her company would get
only a small stake, though it was expected to invest. "I was
livid," she says. "They must have thought I was stupid."</p>
<p>Instead, she went to Japan herself, introduced her two
sons to the supplier, and struck a deal that split the
venture's ownership evenly between her company and the
supplier.</p>
<p>Family squabbles can erupt over business ownership,
complicating the challenges already facing the entrepreneur's
successor. Sometimes the problems don't surface immediately.</p>
<p>Albert Valliere, before his death 18 years ago, charged
his older son Albert Jr. with running the family business in
North Smithfield, R.I., and providing for his two sisters and
brother. He wanted his sons to oversee holdings that include
a construction company and a horse farm and other real
estate, but he also intended his daughters to share in the
value of the real estate. A decade or so later, one of the
women -- who held a low-paying job working for the brothers
in the family business -- says she began asking when she
could claim her share of the assets. In response, Albert Jr.
says, he insisted he had done his best for the family, taking
only a token salary for his efforts.</p>
<p>By the mid-1980s, he says, "family blowups" were
"constant." As a result, the family broke up its holdings in
1986, distributing some of the real estate to the women. This
year, the brothers went their separate ways, too, one taking
the horse farm and the other the construction business. "As
people grow" and change, says Mr. Valliere, "it just doesn't
work having them all eat out of the same bowl."</p>
<p>Clearly, business owners can't foresee every possible
problem their heirs may encounter. But they can do much to
prepare them. For instance, leaving behind a kit of essential
instructions can give the survivor somewhere to start.
"Usually the business owner is the family's chief financial
officer, and there's a lot {of information} in desk drawers
and inside heads that doesn't get communicated to anybody
else," says Mr. Ward, the Loyola professor.</p>
<p>He suggests the kit contain a letter that names the chosen
successor, lists helpful advisers and gives the location of
key documents. It's also useful to offer advice on business
strategies and whether the survivor should sell the company
or continue running it, he says, adding that the kit should
be kept in a safety deposit box or other secure spot and
updated each year.</p>
<p>Better yet, Mr. Kuenster recommends that the successor be
introduced to employees, customers, and creditors while the
owner is still around.</p>
