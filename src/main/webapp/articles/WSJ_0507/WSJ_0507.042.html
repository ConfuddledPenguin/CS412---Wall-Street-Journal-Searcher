	<p class="article-leader">KARLOVY VARY, Czechoslovakia -- As director of the Hotel
Imperial, an imposing sanitarium in this western Bohemia spa
town, Stanislav Siroky is in what appears to be an ideal
situation.
   "We're booked to the last bed year round," says the
earnest physician, a 20-year veteran of the Imperial.
"Absolutely no marketing has ever been necessary."</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Karlovy Vary, called Carlsbad in German, is an elegant
"fin de siecle" resort built along the River Tepla. Its
natural hot springs are said to soothe numerous health
disorders. Located 75 miles from Bayreuth, West Germany,
Karlovy Vary has an airport and a golf course, and is filled
with fanciful architecture. The Imperial sits high above the
town, offering a sweeping view of the soft green hills of
Slovkov Forest.</p>
<p>But there are a few hitches. "Our prices are loss-making,"
says Dr. Siroky, so the building itself is falling apart.
"Nobody on the staff is very interested in working here," he
adds, so service standards are low and turnover high.
Finally, "the guests are impoverished," he notes. "We want to
change our clientele."</p>
<p>Dr. Siroky's plight could describe the tourism industry in
all of Czechoslovakia -- and, indeed, throughout the East
Bloc. Tourists are rushing in, but mostly from Socialist
countries whose currencies are nearly worthless. Hotel and
spa managers don't know how to sell their attractions, much
less how to lure lucrative but demanding Western guests.
Employees are surly and discontented.</p>
<p>For the past 50 years, there has been little investment in
infrastructure, so hotel rooms are in short supply, hotels
themselves are in disrepair, and restaurants, shopping and
amusements are lacking.</p>
<p>The tourism potential is difficult to gauge. It remains to
be seen whether the countries of the region will be able to
accommodate, feed and entertain masses of Western travelers
in reasonable style.</p>
<p>In the wake of Czechoslovakia's November revolution, the
new government has passed several laws in the hope of
creating an investment climate in which Western money and
know-how can turn the country's tourism industry into a
hard-currency machine. But the transformation will be
difficult, and the road ahead for Czechoslovak tourism
entrepreneurs and Western investors promises to be bumpy.</p>
<p>The Hotel Imperial, a 78-year-old property, originally
part of an Anglo-French luxury hotel chain, has since 1945
been reserved exclusively for clients from the Soviet Union.
Moscow owned the hotel from the end of World War II until
1957, when it transferred the 420-bed property to the
Czechoslovak state -- with the proviso that only Soviets
could be treated here, and at fixed rates. The average price
paid by Soviet guests is so low -- 140 Czechoslovak crowns a
day ($4 at the official tourist rate) for room, full board
and treatments -- that Prague has had to spend the equivalent
of $600,000 to $700,000 a year subsidizing the Imperial's
operation.</p>
<p>Thus, the once grand hotel has fallen into disrepair.
Balconies are closed to guests owing to falling plaster from
the facade. A recent windstorm ripped tiles from the roof,
and water leaks into the attic. Furnishings are early-1960s
style, and a third of the rooms lack a private bath.</p>
<p>A volunteer team of Karlovy Vary architects and engineers,
working in secret on a renovation plan, estimates it would
cost about $7 million to bring the Imperial up to a minimum
Western standard.</p>
<p>Down the hill in town, the Grand Hotel Pupp faces some of
the same problems. A hotel has stood on this riverfront site
since 1701, and the current building, an ornate white
confection, dates from 1893.</p>
<p>The Pupp (which dropped the name, Grand Hotel Moskva, in
January) has entertained a who's who of guests during the
centuries. Beethoven and Paganini conducted in the hotel's
baroque performance hall. King Juan Carlos of Spain held a
family party in the French restaurant. Hollywood luminaries
lodge here during the Karlovy Vary film festival.</p>
<p>But on a recent day, the place looks run-down, and the
staff doesn't appear to believe in service with a smile. The
380-room hotel is fully booked, but for those lucky enough to
have secured a room there is no hot water or heating today.</p>
<p>Western companies are sniffing around Karlovy Vary and
elsewhere in Czechoslovakia for investment opportunities. Dr.</p>
<p>Siroky says a West German company offered to buy the
Imperial for 500 million marks ($295 million). Josef Remes,
the food and beverage manager at the Pupp, says he has had
"quite a few offers" of assistance from Western hotel
companies and investment firms.</p>
<p>In the municipal office, Jiri Kovarik, the mayor of
Karlovy Vary, welcomes the avalanche of Western interest.
According to the mayor, Swedish, French and Japanese concerns
have written or visited with plans to redevelop the city's
spa complex. One West German company wants to start a
building-repair firm, while another has offered to help
reorganize the Hotel Imperial. Mr. Kovarik says an Israeli
tour operator has promised to send a planeload of spa clients
to Karlovy Vary every day"but we are not yet well equipped
for this," he concedes.</p>
<p>Ivan Chadima, who currently manages New York's upscale
United Nations Plaza Hotel, and several partners (some of
whom are Czechoslovak-Americans) have started a company
called EuroInvest to negotiate with Western partners on
behalf of the Czechoslovak tourism industry and to search for
Western partners for specific projects. EuroInvest hopes to
land a contract with Karlovy Vary.</p>
<p>Mr. Chadima, who trained at the hotel school in the spa
Marianske Lazne (Marienbad in German) and worked in Prague
before fleeing to North America in 1968, is leaving his New
York job next month to work full-time for EuroInvest.</p>
<p>"It will be six to 12 months before deals will be
possible," he says. "But these first deals will be closely
watched," he adds, so they have to be well structured and
beneficial to both parties. Otherwise, investor interest will
sour.</p>
