	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- President Bush formed an emergency board to
try to resolve bargaining issues between railroads and rail
unions, heading off the threat of a nationwide strike.
   "The creation of this board . . . is necessary to
forestall the possibility of a crippling nationwide rail
strike," White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said. A rail
strike, besides idling railroad workers and stranding riders,
could cause more than 500,000 layoffs within two weeks in
industries served by railroads, the White House said.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The railroads and unions are especially at odds over
health-care costs, the stickiest issue in collective
bargaining in the past two years. The roads want to shift
more of the cost burden to employees, which the unions
oppose.</p>
<p>Under the Rail Labor Act, an emergency board usually has
30 days to make contract recommendations; afterward, the
railroads may put their own contract terms into effect and
the unions are free to strike. But in this case both sides
have agreed to give the board until Sept. 15. They also say
they won't act until 30 days after the board reports or if
Congress isn't in session. Typically, when the parties have
rejected an emergency board's recommendations, Congress has
averted a long rail strike by putting the recommendations
into effect by statute.</p>
