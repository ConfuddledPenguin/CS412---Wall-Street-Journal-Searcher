	<p class="article-leader">Unlike novels, which can take their sweet time getting to
the point and which sometimes don't even need to have a
point, the best short stories are usually sharply focused and
pared down to essentials.
   That Alice Munro is aware of this as a general rule but
quite simply refuses to subscribe to it is apparent in
"Friend of My Youth" (Knopf, 288 pages, $18.95). Most of the
stories in this collection are chock full of characters and
incidents, set mostly in small towns in western Canada. At
the beginning of "Differently," a woman named Georgia is
criticized by her writing instructor for "Too many things
going on at the same time; also too many people. Think, he
told her. What is the important thing? What do you want us to
pay attention to? Think."</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Georgia responds by writing a story that is more to the
instructor's liking, but that she feels is fake. So she
cannot refrain from handing in a long list of everything that
was left out of the story, which provokes the instructor to
say that Georgia expects too much of herself and that she is
wearing him out.</p>
<p>Although some readers, like myself, will no doubt feel
that the instructor's criticism of Georgia could justly be
applied to this book as a whole, others will understandably
feel that Ms. Munro's considerable storytelling gifts more
than compensate for her self-indulgent attitude toward
excessive detail and overly convoluted plots. For Ms. Munro
writes with such a fine human sympathy and measured control
of language that you are willing to forgive her a lot. No
matter that the stories in this collection tend to wander and
don't always come to significant conclusions. Her characters
are vividly drawn and presented with such tolerance and
understanding of human foibles that you imagine their author
ready to forgive even your occasional desire to skip a
paragraph or two.</p>
<p>In "Differently," Georgia ends up living with the writing
teacher. But he turns out to be only an anonymous present-day
foil for a voyage that Georgia makes into the past when she
visits the husband of a dead friend. From here we slide back
into the meandering story of a bittersweet love triangle, or
more accurately of a love polygon, full of a complex network
of confidences and betrayals.</p>
<p>Ms. Munro likes to tuck one story line into another. In
some cases, this works well and the stories enhance each
other. In others, the two stories seem to wander off in their
own directions and drain each other's momentum. In the title
story, for example, we are told about the youthful
experiences of the narrator's mother (whom we see framed by
her final illness) with the Grieveses, a family of austerely
religious farmers. The complementary (and complex)
narratives, juxtaposing the repeated betrayals of Flora
Grieves with the mother's more ordinary, but in a sense
equally tragic fate, don't quite mesh. Moreover, both of
these stories are tinted by a narrative self-consciousness
that gives them a remoteness akin to that of sepia
photographs.</p>
<p>In "Apples and Oranges," on the other hand, the
interweaving of two life histories works very well. The main
narrative involves Murray and Barbara Zeigler, a likable
couple who lose the small-town department store that Murray
inherited and start up a country resort. Into their history
is enfolded that of Victor Sawicky, a strapping Polish
horse-farmer whom we first meet when he comes to buy a pair
of overalls at the store. As the two parallel narrative lines
eventually converge, the result is at once very tender and
very tough-minded.</p>
<p>Amy Hempel, by contrast, is a master of the sharply
focused, pared-down and really short short story. In fact,
one of the stories in "At the Gates of the Animal Kingdom"
(Knopf, 160 pages, $17.95) takes up less than a single page.
But Ms. Hempel is able to pack an extraordinary amount of
observation, emotional punch, humor and even profundity into
very small spaces.</p>
<p>Unlike Ms. Munro, who always gives you solid ground to
stand on, Ms. Hempel likes to spin you around in thin air for
two or three pages and then leave you alone to try and catch
your balance. There are no real "plots" in these elliptical,
no-nonsense stories; most of the time you can only intuit
what is going on.</p>
<p>One of the great delights of these stories is that they
approach the usual cliches of real life and fiction at an
unexpectedly oblique angle. And they do so with surprising
emotional force. There is no sense here of a sepia or a
rose-colored lens. Everything seems to be happening at the
cutting edge in the peculiarly offbeat and frequently
dissonant rhythms of the here and now. "The Most Girl Part of
You," for example, is a sassy and cynical account of the
narrator's impending loss of virginity to Jack "Big Guy"
Fitch, who with a straight face tells her, "I always give a
woman what she wants -- whether she wants it or not." But at
the end of a bruising description of a violent seduction, the
narrative suddenly changes tone and bursts forth with the
startling and unsettling conclusion "that if it's true your
life flashes past your eyes before you die, then it is also
the truth that your life rushes forth when you are ready to
start to truly be alive."</p>
