	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- NBC News is planning to launch a 24-hour news
service, similar to Cable News Network's Headline News, and
offer it to the network's 208 affiliates, according to people
familiar with the proposal.
   Although plans aren't finalized, NBC News, a division of
National Broadcasting Co., reportedly would provide fully
produced newscasts -- with anchors separate from NBC News --
to affiliates during periods when the network isn't
operating. For example, NBC doesn't transmit programming for
several hours during the morning beginning at 9 a.m., in the
afternoon beginning at 4 p.m. and overnight beginning at 2
a.m.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Also, the network is "dark" during many hours on the
weekend, when affiliates must provide their own programming
or buy it from syndicators.</p>
<p>NBC is planning to announce details of the service in June
at its annual convention with affiliates in Washington. It
would be offered exclusively to NBC affiliates.</p>
<p>It would be the first time a broadcast network attempted
to distribute news and informational programming on an
around-the-clock basis.</p>
<p>"Affiliates could take this news and informational
programming during some of those (dark) periods," said an NBC
official, who didn't want to be identified. "This is an
alternative to NBC stations that don't necessarily want to
buy syndicated shows but want to enhance their news image."</p>
<p>NBC, a unit of General Electric Co., declined to comment.
However, the NBC official said discussions have taken place
over the past several months and have focused on the
service's content, its value to affiliates and how it will be
distributed. Although there has been discussion that the
service will be based in Dallas, no final decision has been
made.</p>
<p>There is a possibility that NBC News, the only network
news division that didn't make a profit last year, would
eventually sell the service overseas. CNN, for example, sells
its programming world-wide. However, the NBC official said no
discussions for overseas distribution have been held.</p>
<p>The network already has a service, called A-News, that
delivers footage and news reports from NBC News and NBC
affiliates. The stations pick which stories they want to air
on local newscasts. It is unclear how the new 24-hour service
would affect A-News. It also isn't clear if NBC Cable's
network, Consumer News and Business Channel, would be
providing material to the service.</p>
<p>There is additional competition other than Headline News,
however, including the All News Channel, a co-venture between
Conus Communications, a subsidiary of Hubbard Broadcasting
Inc., and Viacom International Inc. An NBC-owned station,
KCNC in Denver, last week agreed to become a subscriber to
the All News Channel.</p>
<p>About one-fourth of NBC's affiliates already subscribe to
CNN's Headline News, a subsidiary of Turner Broadcasting
System Inc.; Headline News is a separate service of CNN that
is similar to all-news radio, with news, weather and sports
updated every half hour. In fact, Turner and NBC News had
negotiated to form a joint news-gathering operation. When
those talks collapsed in February, NBC News President Michael
Gartner said "a joint operation would not best serve our
affiliates or our viewers." Instead, he said, NBC would
develop a "stronger" news service for the stations.</p>
<p>NBC News was sharply criticized by its affiliates for its
lackluster performance in getting footage on the air from
last October's San Francisco area earthquake, for instance.</p>
<p>"I have encouraged NBC to do anything that can make our
news product more valuable," said William L. Bolster, head of
the affiliate board's news committee and general manager of
KSDK, the NBC affiliate in St. Louis.</p>
<p>NBC News needs to give the stations some good news by June
3, the first day of the network's convention. The affiliates
are furious over the plunging ratings of the formerly No. 1
rated "Today" morning news show, which since January has
slipped to second place behind ABC's "Good Morning America."
Last week's ratings for "Today," for instance, were the
lowest since August 1983.</p>
