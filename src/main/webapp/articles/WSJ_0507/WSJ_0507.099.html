	<p class="article-leader">SEAN MULHOLLAND, who is suing his former employer,
Nordstrom Inc., for allegedly unlawful discharge, says he has
a written record of 16 contacts with Nordstrom managers, who
allegedly orally rejected his efforts to seek reinstatement
at Nordstrom. He didn't receive any letter of rejection, and
Nordstrom denies that he was unlawfully discharged. A Feb. 20
article mistakenly indicated that Nordstrom rejected Mr.
Mulholland's applications in writing.
