	<p class="article-leader">SOWETO, South Africa -- After three days of historic talks
with the white government last week, the African National
Congress is pressing Pretoria to drop its insistence on
protecting "white minority rights" in a new constitution.
   At a report-back rally attended by 30,000 blacks in Soweto
yesterday, ANC leader Nelson Mandela said the meetings went a
long way toward breaking down suspicion between the
participants, who have been bitter enemies for the past three
decades. The talks were designed to clear away obstacles to
eventual negotiations over ending the racial-segregation
system known as apartheid and shaping a new constitution
where the white minority will share power with the black
majority.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The government said it will review its existing security
legislation, including possibly lifting the four-year-old
state of emergency, while the ANC said it will look "hard and
earnestly" at suspending its armed struggle. The two sides
formed a joint working group to hammer out agreement on the
release of political prisoners and immunity for political
offenses.</p>
<p>But Mr. Mandela said the government's opposition to a
one-man, one-vote majority rule system and its insistence
that the rights of minorities, such as the whites, be
constitutionally protected, "means that white South Africa
doesn't yet trust us." South African President F.W. de Klerk,
who earlier this year legalized the ANC after a 30-year ban
and released Mr. Mandela from prison, says simple majority
rule will lead to black domination and wants to make "group
protection" a subject for future negotiations.</p>
<p>"At a time when we want to move away from all kinds of
racism we don't want discussions, which have started so well,
to be bedeviled by any solutions based on race," Mr. Mandela
told the crowd. "I'm going to urge Mr. de Klerk that he
mustn't bring this {group concept} to any conference between
the ANC and the government."</p>
<p>Rather, Mr. Mandela said, "Our duty, both as black and
white leaders, is now to go out into the country and talk to
our people not in terms of blacks and whites but in terms of
South Africans. We have to convince them that any form of
racism is a formula for disaster."</p>
<p>The talks fulfilled the ANC's dream of sitting down with
the government as equal partners, something it has pushed for
since its inception in 1912.</p>
<p>While the talks were hailed across South Africa, there
were dissenting voices. Former President P.W. Botha said he
wouldn't renew his membership in the ruling National Party
because it earlier lifted the ban on the South African
Communist Party and allowed the communist leader, Joe Slovo,
to be part of the ANC's negotiation team.</p>
