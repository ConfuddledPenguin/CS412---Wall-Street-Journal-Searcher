	<p class="article-leader">SAN FRANCISCO -- California Energy Co. said it reached an
agreement to acquire certain geothermal operations from a
unit of Chevron Corp. for $68.7 million.
   The purchase price could be reduced to $51.2 million in
the event Chevron's partner in a Beowawe, Nev., operation
exercises a right of first refusal to buy Chevron's 50%
interest in a partnership that operates a 15.6-megawatt
facility.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Chevron's unit, Chevron Resources Co., said the sale
includes a 9,000-kilowatt generating plant in Desert Peak,
Nev., its 69% interest in a Roosevelt, Utah, field that sells
steam to a utility plant, and certain leasehold interests.</p>
