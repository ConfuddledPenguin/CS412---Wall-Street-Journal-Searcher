	<p class="article-leader">SPARTANBURG, S.C. -- TW Services Inc. named Coca-Cola Co.
as the primary soft-drink supplier for its 465 Hardee's
restaurants and 1,700 Canteen cafeterias, giving Coke another
boost over archrival PepsiCo Inc.
   TW's announcement Friday came on the heels of Burger King
Corp.'s decision earlier last week to switch to Coke from
Pepsi in its 5,400 restaurants. Though Coke declined to
estimate potential sales, industry observers said the
agreement was significantly smaller than the Burger King
deal, which cost Pepsi more than an estimated $270 million in
annual sales.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The latest agreement shows that "any company that handles
a Pepsi-Cola food-service account is now being hotly
revisited by Coca-Cola executives," said Jesse Meyers,
publisher of Beverage Digest, an industry newsletter.
"Likewise, I would be amazed if Pepsi wasn't mounting a
full-scale attack on Coke's accounts."</p>
<p>TW, the fourth-largest food-service concern in the U.S.,
is the largest franchisee of Hardee's Food Systems, which has
a total of about 2,700 restaurants. TW also operates its
cafeterias in places such as corporate offices and parks.
Coke is already the primary soft-drink supplier for TW's 213
Quincy's, 206 El Pollo Loco and 1,001 Denny's restaurants,
but has shared TW's Hardee's franchises with Pepsi before
now.</p>
<p>A Pepsi spokesman said the company still supplies soft
drinks to about 600 Hardee's owned by other franchisees.</p>
