	<p class="article-leader">WEST GERMAN UNEMPLOYMENT</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>West Germany's unemployment rate fell to its lowest level
in almost eight years, dropping to 7.3% in April from 7.7% in
March and 7.9% in April 1989, the Federal Labor Office said.
The unadjusted number of unemployed fell to 1,914,585 from
2,013,057 in March.</p>
<p>The April unemployment rate was the lowest since 7.2% in
July 1982. In September and October, the unemployment rate
had also slipped to as low as 7.3%, but it began rising
sharply after that as a steady stream of resettlers from East
Germany turned into a flood.</p>
<p>"This illustrates that the people coming from the East are
complementing the work force here," said Norbert Walter,
chief economist at Deutsche Bank AG in Frankfurt. "They're
not taking jobs away from Germans but are instead taking jobs
that Germans aren't mobile enough for or aren't vocationally
qualified for."</p>
<p>WORLD'S AIDS CASES GOING UP</p>
<p>The number of AIDS cases world-wide increased by nearly
17,000 in April over the previous month, the World Health
Organization said. WHO put the cumulative total of officially
reported cases at the end of April at 254,078, compared with
237,110 a month earlier. But the health agency believes the
true global number of AIDS cases to be 600,000, with three to
five million thought to be infected with the AIDS virus.</p>
<p>NOVEL SOVIET TV FARE</p>
<p>The Soviet Union will televise nationwide a Bible cartoon
series aimed mainly at children, a senior official of the
Finnish company supplying the film said. Hannu Haukka of the
religious-broadcasting company Hyva Sanoma said the series
based on the Old and New Testaments would be screened in all
15 Soviet republics for up to 200 million viewers by
agreement with Soviet television authorities. "It will be the
first time children in the Soviet Union have ever experienced
such an exposure to religion," he said.</p>
<p>JORDANIAN EDICT</p>
<p>The Jordanian government announced that men will no longer
be allowed to purchase beauty parlors or hire male
beauticians to work in them. The Interior Ministry order,
which took effect yesterday, doesn't apply to men who already
own such shops or work in them, a ministry official said. The
decision came in response to demands by Islamic
fundamentalists in Jordan's 80-member parliament. The Moslem
Brotherhood, the main Islamic faction, and Islamic
independents hold about three dozen seats.</p>
<p>RELIEVING SPAIN'S CONGESTION</p>
<p>The Spanish government unveiled a mammoth public-works and
transport program intended to alleviate the congestion that
is strangling Spain's major cities and turning highways into
permanent traffic jams. The project involves building
alternate routes around Madrid, Barcelona, Valencia, Seville
and Malaga by the end of 1992. Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez
said the program's goal is "to bolster the hope that big
cities can be made more livable in a few short years."</p>
<p>CHINA'S FOREIGN DEBT</p>
<p>China's foreign debt stood at $41.30 billion at the end of
last year. The State Administration of Exchange Control said
the debt included $37.03 billion in medium- and long-term
loans and $4.27 billion in short-term loans. Chinese
officials said the debt-service ratio, the principal and
interest to be repaid in a year as compared with total
foreign-exchange earnings, will remain between 15% and 20%.
The internationally recognized danger line is 25%.</p>
<p>MRS. THATCHER BREATHES EASIER</p>
<p>British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, in deep trouble
over the economy and a new local tax, won some breathing
space with her Conservatives' better-than-expected results in
local elections last week.</p>
<p>Although the Tories suffered major losses in local-council
seats, the outcome fell short of the rout forecast by
pre-election opinion polls. And the Conservatives' victories
in some key London boroughs allowed Mrs. Thatcher to argue
that the controversial new local-government tax at last is
beginning to work.</p>
<p>The opposition Labor Party fought the election as a
referendum on the flat-rate community charge, or poll tax.
The results make it easier for Mrs. Thatcher to resist calls
for sweeping changes in the new law -- and calls for her own
departure as party leader.</p>
<p>The outcome gave a boost Friday to government securities,
the pound sterling and the London stock market. Nevertheless,
any respite for the prime minister is likely to be brief as
political attention swings back to the economy. Figures due
to be released this Friday are expected to show that the
annual rate of British inflation rose sharply last month from
its 8.1% level in March.</p>
<p>POSTSCRIPTS . . .</p>
<p>American and Canadian citizens no longer need to obtain
Czechoslovak visas for visits of 30 days or less, the
official Czech news agency announced. . . . In the French
city of Nimes, about 15 members of France's bullfighters'
union occupied a chamber at City Hall protesting that
Spaniards were getting too many of the jobs at a coming
bullfight festival. According to the protesters, French
bullfighters were given only two of about 30 jobs at the
festival.</p>
