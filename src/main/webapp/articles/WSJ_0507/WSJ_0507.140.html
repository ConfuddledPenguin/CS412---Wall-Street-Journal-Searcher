	<p class="article-leader">First Executive Corp., the struggling Los Angeles-based
insurer, hired investment banker First Boston Corp. to
explore a restructuring that could include the sale of one or
more of First Executive's operating units, people familiar
with the company said.
   First Executive last year tried to sell its second-largest
insurance subsidiary, but the proposed buyer, a private
investor group, was unable to complete the purchase of the
New York-based unit. First Boston, which is owned by CS First
Boston Inc., will examine alternatives for First Executive's
New York subsidiary and other units, people familiar with the
company said.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Meanwhile, a top official of Kidder, Peabody & Co., one of
First Executive's traditional investment bankers, said Kidder
is representing another company "that is interested in a
transaction with First Executive."</p>
<p>Scott Newquist, an executive managing director at Kidder
in charge of investment banking, declined to identify
Kidder's client or specify the nature of its proposed
transaction.</p>
<p>However, speculation within the insurance industry has
centered on Kidder's parent, General Electric Co., which may
be interested in purchasing part of First Executive's
junk-bond portfolio or one of its insurance units. In
particular, GE could be interested in First Executive's New
York-based unit.</p>
<p>Fred Carr, chairman of First Executive, confirmed in an
interview yesterday that First Executive had hired First
Boston. He declined to specify First Boston's assignment.
First Boston officials declined to comment.</p>
<p>One person familiar with First Executive said First
Boston's assignment is "to help the board and the management
understand what options the company might have in addition to
what it's doing now."</p>
<p>First Executive's move comes as the company, which has
assets of more than $19 billion, is under pressure on several
fronts. For the fourth quarter of last year, First Executive
reported a stunning loss of $835.7 million, or $9.98 a share,
after writing down the value of its $8 billion junk bond
portfolio by $859 million. First Executive, which was a major
customer of now-failed Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc., is
believed to hold the nation's largest portfolio of
high-yield, high-risk junk bonds and has been hurt by the
recent swoon in the market for such bonds.</p>
<p>News of the write-down caused a surge in redemptions by
holders of policies issued by First Executive's two main
units, Executive Life Insurance Co. of California and
Executive Life Insurance Co. of New York. Policy surrenders
and redemptions were $559 million in the first two months of
this year, more than double the year-earlier rate. First
Executive has told securities analysts that the pace of
withdrawals slowed in March and April, but hasn't provided
specific figures.</p>
<p>First Executive also could face problems from proposed new
insurance regulations that would force insurers to put up
more capital as a reserve against possible losses on the some
of the lowest-rated junk bonds they hold. Executive Life is
also being closely examined by California insurance
regulators and First Executive's securities offering last
year is being investigated by the Securities and Exchange
Commission.</p>
<p>As a result of these problems, First Executive's common
stock has tumbled from a price of about $17 a share within
the last 12 months to close at $2.75 a share on Friday in the
national over-the-counter market.</p>
<p>One disgruntled major shareholder, Rosewood Financial
Corp., Dallas, which owns a 9.9% stake in First Executive,
offered earlier this year to buy the company for cash and
stock that it valued at $6 a share. First Executive rejected
the offer as inadequate. Rosewood, an arm of the Caroline
Rose Hunt trust, hasn't renewed its offer.</p>
<p>Herbert E. Goodfriend, an insurance analyst with
Prudential-Bache Securities, New York, views the hiring of
First Boston as a sign that First Executive will become more
aggressive in defending itself. "We surmise that this new
step by the company will include possible recapitalization
and/or new money/new blood," Mr. Goodfriend wrote in a recent
report. Mr. Goodfriend declined to elaborate, citing a
Prudential-Bache policy that bars him from discussing First
Executive with the press beyond his written reports. A
Prudential-Bache spokeswoman declined to explain the firm's
reason for barring Mr. Goodfriend from speaking about First
Executive.</p>
<p>Mr. Newquist of Kidder Peabody said his firm had discussed
with First Executive the possibility of evaluating First
Executive's portfolio. But, Mr. Newquist said, "we feel we're
conflicted from working for First Executive because of
another assignment we have." He said the assignment is from
"another company that is interested in a transaction with
First Executive." He declined to identify the company or the
nature of the transaction.</p>
<p>For First Boston, the hiring by First Executive represents
the fourth major insurance or junk-bond assignment in recent
months. First Boston is trying to sell the insurance units of
AmBase Corp., New York; American General Corp., a Houston
insurance and finance company; and the $3 billion junk bond
portfolio of insolvent Columbia Savings & Loan Association,
Beverly Hills, Calif.</p>
