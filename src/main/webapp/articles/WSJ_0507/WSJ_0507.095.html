	<p class="article-leader">Is there a way Congress can make last year's Exxon Valdez
disaster worse? It's possible, if Congress rashly decides to
force all tankers and barges in U.S. waters to have double
hulls within 15 years. The proposed cure not only would have
failed to prevent the Exxon Valdez spill, but it could
increase the chances of a major oil spill while needlessly
driving up shipping rates.
   The House has passed an oil-spill bill that would require
all tankers to be retrofitted with double bottoms within
seven years and double hulls within 15 years. The Senate's
version mandates double hulls only for new tankers, and
postpones a decision on existing tankers pending a National
Academy of Sciences study on tanker design due out later this
year. A conference committee is now negotiating which version
will become law.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>All this is happening even though there is no evidence
that double hulls or double bottoms better prevent a major
oil spill than other safety precautions. Under some
circumstances, double bottoms would prevent oil tanks from
being punctured. But they can also make it harder to salvage
a grounded tanker and can create stability problems. The
Exxon Valdez hit the rocks at such a speed that a double hull
would have done little good. Even so, 80% of its cargo
remained in the tanks. The ship's builders say that a
double-hulled Exxon Valdez might have been lost under three
out of five possible accident scenarios.</p>
<p>After the 1978 Amoco Cadiz oil spill, the International
Maritime Organization considered requiring double-hull
construction. It rejected the concept in favor of relocating
ballast tanks in the most vulnerable parts of a ship, and
partial double bottoms. All tankers built since 1979,
including the Exxon Valdez, have those features.</p>
<p>The head of the Coast Guard, Admiral Paul A. Yost, agrees
that "unilateral" action mandating double-hulled tankers is a
mistake and he "strongly recommends" that Congress wait for
the National Academy study on tanker design. Why then is
Congress in such haste to require a fast phase-in of double
hulls?</p>
<p>One reason is that environmentalists are demanding
something be done to prevent oil spills, and requiring double
hulls is a popular quick fix. Another is intense lobbying by
special interests. A few shipping companies with relatively
new fleets want to force their competitors to retire or
sideline their older, single-hulled fleets. They would lose
perhaps 10% of their fleets while eliminating 60% of the
overall tanker market. Because there aren't enough shipyards
to build or retrofit all the double-bottomed tankers needed
by the proposed 1997 deadline, the resulting shipping
shortage would allow the firms with newer fleets to drive up
prices.</p>
<p>A shipping shortage could be avoided if the 1920 Jones Act
didn't force all trade between U.S. ports to be carried in
high-cost, U.S.-flag carriers. That means oil companies
hauling Alaskan oil can't use tankers from Korea, where costs
are half that of U.S. shipyards. The Department of Energy
says that last December's heating-oil shortage wouldn't have
happened if available foreign vessels could have been used
between U.S. ports.</p>
<p>Requiring double hulls or bottoms on tankers is an
expensive way for Congress to show it is doing something
about the dangers of oil spills. The Exxon Valdez was tragedy
enough. Congress shouldn't compound the folly by forcing a
dubious technical fix on the oil industry before the National
Academy of Sciences report lays out all the facts.</p>
