	<h3>EC Wants to Nip Budding Monopolists --- Merger-Control Experts Being Gathered for Task</h3>

	<p class="article-leader">BRUSSELS -- At 10 p.m. on a recent Sunday night, Carter
Eltzroth glanced out his window and was surprised to see
lights burning across the street in the offices of the
European Community's competition experts.
   It wasn't the cleaning staff, says Mr. Eltzroth, a lawyer
with the U.S. firm Morgan, Lewis & Bockius. It was the
specialists themselves, who these days are in a whirl of
activity preparing for their new role as the EC's chief
merger regulators.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>To do the job, the commission is putting together a team
of 40 merger-control experts charged with rooting out budding
monopolists. Under the supervision of Competition
Commissioner Sir Leon Brittan, the task force will have the
sole authority to vet large cross-border takeovers, mergers
and joint ventures affecting the EC market.</p>
<p>The date the merger-control regulations take effect, Sept.
21, is less than five months away, and many predict that the
commission is in for a rough ride. "It's a very difficult job
to start," says John H. Shenefield, a partner at Morgan Lewis
in Washington. Mr. Shenefield ought to know: In the late
1970s, as head of the Justice Department's Antitrust
Division, he helped put into action the U.S.'s own
merger-control legislation.</p>
<p>The EC's new merger department is widely considered to be
one of the tools most important to the success of the
community's plan to create a single market by the end of
1992. By consolidating various national rules into a single
regulatory policy, the department will help make it easier
for companies to carry out the mergers and takeovers they
need to become big enough to compete globally. At the same
time, the department will be charged with making sure that
companies aren't allowed to combine into inefficient
pan-European monopolies.</p>
<p>The merger controls are only a part of the new powers
being assumed by the budding federal EC regulators in
Brussels as the single market takes shape. And they already
have large and small businesses alike -- until recently happy
to operate in comfortably protected home markets --
scrambling to adjust to the prospect of cutthroat,
pan-European competition.</p>
<p>According to Translink, a New York-based acquisition
advisory firm, 1,114 EC companies valued at 44 billion
European currency units ($52.8 billion) were targets of
cross-border acquisitions last year. The advent of central EC
merger control, analysts say, could further fuel such
activity, because deal makers will find it easier to address
themselves to one authority subject to EC judicial review,
rather than to conflicting national bureaucracies and
jurisdictions.</p>
<p>Last year's takeover of Plessey Co. by West Germany's
Siemens AG and the U.K.'s General Electric Co. shows how the
current panoply of conflicting merger regulations in Europe
often creates chaos both for target companies and their
pursuers. The joint acquisition of the British electronics
company was complicated and delayed for months because GEC
and Siemens first had to get a go-ahead from both the West
German Federal Cartel Office and the U.K.'s Monopolies and
Mergers Commission. The deal also needed a nod of assent from
the EC Commission that it wouldn't raise any objections
retroactively after the new competition law takes effect.</p>
<p>In 1988, the acquisition of the British candy maker
Rowntree PLC by Nestle S.A. of Switzerland was also
complicated by a lack of clear rules. Ultimately, British,
French and EC authorities all pitched in to move things
along.</p>
<p>While investment bankers say exclusive EC control ought to
help with such tangles, making the new system work won't be
easy. For one thing, some of the new rules are vague --
particularly those used to determine when a company is
anti-competitive -- and most observers expect legal
challenges to be made. National leaders will resist losing
influence over some of the biggest deals that will take place
on the EC marketplace. And forcing fair competition onto a
barrier-free EC market is bound to clash with the cozy links
many big European companies enjoy with their home government.</p>
<p>A recent row between Sir Leon and French Prime Minister
Michel Rocard provides an example of the potential
difficulties. In a speech in Paris titled "Defining the
Limits of State Aid to Industry," Sir Leon promised more EC
scrutiny of "disguised" subsidies to state-owned companies.
That angered the Socialist Mr. Rocard, who said Sir Leon was
meddling in French internal affairs. In a letter, he accused
the commissioner, an appointee of British Prime Minister
Margaret Thatcher, of bias against France's "mixed economy"
system, in which state and private enterprises compete
against one another.</p>
<p>If the EC commission doesn't want to be dragged into such
ideological wars, it will have to make every effort to
convince governments, the business community and financial
markets that it is acting independently and without favor. As
Mr. Shenefield puts it, the commission's rulings --
especially the very first ones -- must be perceived as
"intellectually coherent and honest."</p>
<p>"The skill of the job will be to make the decision
apolitical," adds John Walker-Haworth, formerly head of
Britain's Takeovers Panel and now a director at S.G. Warburg
Group PLC, a London-based investment bank.</p>
<p>Responsibility in this area will fall primarily on Sir
Leon's top competition brass: Colin Overbury, a former
British army legal officer who has been with the commission
since 1974 and who will preside over the merger-control task
force; Klaus-Dieter Ehlermann, a legal scholar and a former
head commission spokesman who is in charge of the competition
department; and Jonathan Faull, another lawyer, who is Sir
Leon's top adviser on competition matters.</p>
<p>Like athletes preparing for an all-important match, the
new team is practicing with dry runs to see if everything
works. The members are even pretending that the rules are in
effect, and are testing them on actual cases. "We're busy
testing the people, the computers, the rules to find out
where the problems are," says a committee aide. "Our
credibility is on the line."</p>
<p>There hasn't been a lack of big test deals since the start
of the year. In the automobile sector, France's Renault is
teaming with Sweden's AB Volvo; in insurance, the
Netherlands' N.V. Amev and Belgium's Groupe AG are pooling
their business; and in the airline industry, Air France has
gobbled up its two main domestic competitors, Union de
Transports Aeriens and Air Inter.</p>
<p>The commission expects that 40 to 50 cases a year will
fall under its jurisdiction, with only a handful warranting a
full investigation. But the figure could well be much higher.
Besides those deals spurred by the simplified regulatory
process, the estimate doesn't take into account mergers
involving non-EC companies with substantial EC operations,
which also could fall under commission control. Moreover,
national authorities may delegate their over sight powers
concerning smaller deals to the commission.</p>
