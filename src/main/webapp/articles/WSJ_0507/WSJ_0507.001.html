	<p class="article-leader">SOWETO, South Africa -- Godfrey Moloi, a former bootlegger
recently gone legit, throws back his head and erupts in
laughter. "Can you beat it," he cackles, "whitey coming to me
for money."
   As the king of Soweto's saloonkeepers, Mr. Moloi has seen
some pretty bizarre things in his 56 years. But never did he
figure that a scoundrel like himself would be knocking down
whiskeys with a pin-striped financier from the white side of
the tracks who is pitching unit trusts and money-markets
funds.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"With our inflation, you're losing money with the 15% the
banks are giving you," argues the young money man. "Last
year, I could have gotten you 40%."</p>
<p>Mr. Moloi is flattered but suspicious. "These
whatyacallems -- unit trusts -- are for the big guys, guys
with money to lose," he says, shaking with laughter. He calls
for more whiskey. "Did you say 40%?"</p>
<p>This encounter under the blinking neon lights of Mr.
Moloi's Blue Fountain nightclub, deep within South Africa's
largest black township, may not be as momentous as the the
political talks that concluded Friday between black
nationalist Nelson Mandela and the white government. But, in
its own way, it is equally revolutionary. That a button-down
yuppie would nervously navigate his BMW through Soweto's
streets after dark, just to see this man whose friends call
him "the Godfather," is a remarkable concession to the
emerging economic clout of black South Africa.</p>
<p>For decades, Mr. Moloi was an outlaw, playing
hide-and-seek with the police while running a shebeen, or
speak-easy, out of his Soweto home in defiance of a law that
prohibited blacks from selling alcohol. Fourteen months ago,
after the prohibition was lifted by a government suddenly
interested in encouraging black business, Mr. Moloi got a
liquor license. Voila, the outlaw became a respectable
entrepreneur. The Small Business Development Corp. rushed to
give him a low-interest loan to build the Blue Fountain.
Then, Anglo American Corp., the biggest company in South
Africa, awarded him a contract to run the entertainment
center at one of its gold mines. Now, the money managers of
Johannesburg are bellying up to his bar.</p>
<p>As the young financier orders another round, Mr. Moloi
savors the moment almost as much as he does the whiskey. "For
years, black business has been penned in, like a dog in a
kennel," he says. "But as anyone in Soweto knows, that dog
will eventually break loose."</p>
<p>In the emancipation of black South Africa, Mr. Moloi and
his fellow township entrepreneurs are straining at
apartheid's leash as fervently as political activists. While
Mr. Mandela and his African National Congress bargain with
the white government for equal black participation in
governing South Africa, the legions of emerging black
businessmen are pushing for economic parity with the white
minority. They have debunked the old African liberation
gospel: "Seek ye first the political kingdom." Here, politics
and economics are riding in tandem.</p>
<p>South Africa's racial segregation laws, known as
apartheid, were designed not just to stifle the black
majority's political voice, but also to keep blacks working
as hewers of wood and bearers of water. But just as their
political spirit survived the decades of bannings and
arrests, so has their entrepreneurial will. They have forced
the government to face up to black ambitions.</p>
<p>The shebeeners, many in number, made a mockery of the
nightly police raids and impelled the government to legalize
them. Hawkers selling everything from bananas to soap pushed
their way out of the townships and got several city councils
to open up their "white" business districts to traders of all
races. Taxi drivers, with their fleets of mini-buses, broke
the monopoly of white-owned bus companies in ferrying black
workers to and from their jobs. And today, the black taxi
association is regularly consulted by the government on
transport issues.</p>
<p>Despite these advances, the anomalies of apartheid remain.
Blacks still are outsiders in the main economic arenas,
particularly mining and finance. Few are big players in
industry. With a membership of only 25, the Association of
Black Accountants is one of the smallest professional bodies
in the world. The nation's board rooms remain an
almost-exclusively white domain.</p>
<p>"All of that should only make us work harder," says Thomas
Masinga, who started off selling shoelaces on the streets of
Johannesburg, moved up to handbags, advanced to scrap iron
and now employs 50 people at a demolition company and at a
woodworking factory. "We've got to keep pushing, keep
pushing."</p>
<p>                                                                                                    

 Habakuk Shikwane</p>
<p>Habakuk Shikwane is pushing. He has been up since dawn,
cutting cushion patterns for the cane furniture he makes. It
is Saturday, but there isn't any time to rest. With four
factories and 370 employees, Mr. Shikwane, 62, is South
Africa's largest black industrialist and black employer. His
business empire in the remote black homeland of Lebowa
includes a car dealership, a grocery store and several
hundred head of cattle. He lives in a big house with a
swimming pool and drives a silver Mercedes-Benz. He is proud
of what he has, all of it a tribute to one man's
determination to succeed in a country that programmed him to
fail.</p>
<p>Mr. Shikwane, who was born about 10 miles from where his
factories now stand, followed the path of many rural
youngsters and traveled to Johannesburg seeking work when he
was 18. He had only a grade-school education but was good
with his hands and soon found a job at a cane factory.
Eventually, he became foreman, running the business when the
white owner was out of town. In a moment of madness, he asked
the white city council for his own manufacturing license. The
council, contemptuous, turned him down. So he sat on a stool
behind his small house in Soweto, shaping cane. It was 1954
and even that was illegal.</p>
<p>"My friends said `Habakuk, it won't work. They'll shut you
down,'" he remembers. "At that time, the police were
arresting blacks for being in the city without work. I said,
`I want to see them arrest a black man for working.'"</p>
<p>They did. He built walls around his tiny house to obscure
his activities, but he couldn't hide his small pickup truck
full of furniture. One day the police, who had been watching
the truck, raided his place and arrested all 15 of his
workers for violating the Pass Laws; none of them possessed
permits to be in Johannesburg. Mr. Shikwane paid the fines
and once again asked the council for a factory site.</p>
<p>In an experiment to see just what a black man could do on
his own, the council, now run by the relatively liberal
opposition party, gave him a little site in an empty field in
Soweto. With a young lawyer named Nelson Mandela collecting
debts for him, Mr. Shikwane prospered.</p>
<p>In 1960, apartheid was in high gear. To purify "white"
South Africa, blacks were being herded into tribal homelands.
The government directed Mr. Shikwane to another empty field,
this one north of Pretoria. If he wanted to keep making
furniture, he would have to do it there. It was a tough
decision, for he opposed the homeland system. But he was
already banned from politics -- he had been one of the ANC's
top recruiters in Soweto -- and without his cane, he would
have nothing. He moved, and again he prospered.</p>
<p>By the mid-70s, his furniture was on sale in stores around
the country. But his factory was in Bophuthatswana, which was
about to become a psuedo-independent state for the Tswana
tribe. So Mr. Shikwane, who is a Sotho, was told to leave.
His water and electricity were cut off to encourage his
departure. He was shown another empty field, this one in the
North Sotho homeland of Lebowa. He cleared the bush, drove
away the jackals and leopards and paved the first road. Since
this last fresh start, he has expanded into new businesses,
always pushing forward.</p>
<p>"My whole life, I've had to be a pioneer," says Mr.
Shikwane, a short, powerfully built man. "When I first moved
to the homelands, some said I was a sellout. That hurt."</p>
<p>He wipes his brow. "But, you see, I couldn't give up the
business. My friends in the ANC were being jailed or going
into exile. That was their contribution to liberation. My
contribution is Habakuk Cane. If I failed, I would have
failed the entire black community."</p>
<p>                                                                                                    

 Gaby Magomola</p>
<p>Gaby Magomola gazes through the picture windows of his
corner office, looking northward over Johannesburg, the white
suburbs stretching out before him. His trip to the 25th
floor, where he dispenses financial advice to white and black
clients alike, wasn't a smooth elevator ride, but an arduous
climb up the back stairs.</p>
<p>Born in a rural mining town, Mr. Magomola, who is 47,
dropped out of school at 16 to take a factory job in an
industrial suburb of Johannesburg. Being black, though, he
needed a pass to move from one town to another. So he bribed
a woman of mixed race to accompany him to the local
magistrate and register him as a "colored" relative. It was
like a leopard changing its spots. As a colored, he could
come and go as he pleased. "It's part of your survival kit as
a black man," he says. "You do what you have to do."</p>
<p>In the big city, liberation-politics beckoned, and he soon
found himself arrested under the Suppression of Communism Act
for being a member of the banned Pan African Congress. He was
sentenced to six years in Robben Island prison; he arrived
there shortly before Mr. Mandela did. Prison became his
classroom: He completed his high-school exams and began a
university-level correspondence course in accounting. After
prison, he was exiled to the far north of the country to work
on a sisal plantation for two years. Again, he reached into
his survival kit, and pursuaded a black doctor to hospitalize
him. From his bed, he finished college.</p>
<p>Mr. Magomola's dream was to be a certified accountant, a
field that was an all-white club at the time. To achieve his
ambition, he had to serve an apprenticeship with a
professional accounting firm. But none would hire him. "They
were afraid of losing clients if they sent a black man to
audit a white company," he says. "They also worried about
what I would do if the client didn't have toilet facilities
for blacks."</p>
<p>So much for being an accountant. He would be a banker
instead. Thanks to a Fulbright scholarship, he studied
international finance at Ball State University in Indiana.
And in late 1982, as advertised, he came home a banker.
Within two years he was managing the international division
of the local Barclay's Bank in Johannesburg. Then he became
assistant to the managing director.</p>
<p>"I was advising all of the big clients, and it was
incredible to some of them that a black mind was capable of
understanding the intricacies of Euro-currencies," he
recalls, smiling broadly.</p>
<p>Today, he is still shocking whites, particularly with his
talk of a "black Rand." As marketing director of the newly
formed Foundation for African Business and Consumer Services,
a coalition of black business associations, he aims to
harness black economic power. The foundation set up the
country's first black insurance brokerage company, to handle
the insurance needs of a legion of black taxi drivers. Now it
is completing plans for a bank to attract the wealth
accumulating in the townships, as well as to assist
entrepreneurs whose needs are too small to interest
white-owned banks.</p>
<p>"This way, we keep the Rand in black hands," says Mr.
Magomola. "If we just remain laborers and consumers, the
battle will be lost."</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>Godfrey Moloi stands in the foyer of the Blue Fountain,
hands on hips, bidding the unit-trust man farewell. Who would
have thought? he muses. Not long ago he was leading the cops
on wild chases around Soweto with every delivery of booze. It
was great fun, but at the end of each day, it was the police
who were laughing, at him and all the other rogue
entrepreneurs.</p>
<p>"There comes a time when you have to stop running," he
says. "These days, when the police come in here, I stand at
the door and say, `How nice to see you. Can I help?'"</p>
<p>Now he is the one who is laughing. He shakes his head in
wonder. Did the white man really say 40%?</p>
