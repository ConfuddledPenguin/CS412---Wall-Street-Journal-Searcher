	<p class="article-leader">Robert T. Morris Jr., the computer "hacker" who unleashed
a virus that disrupted a nationwide electronic mail network
in 1988, was sentenced by a federal judge in Syracuse, N.Y.,
to three years probation and a $10,000 fine.
   Judge Howard Munson also ordered Mr. Morris, 25 years old,
to perform 400 hours of community service.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Computer experts said the sentence was too light to serve
as much of a deterrent to similar crimes by hackers.</p>
<p>In January, Mr. Morris was convicted of violating the
federal Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, under which he could
have been imprisoned for as long as five years and fined as
much as $250,000. The case has been closely watched in the
computer industry because of rising concern about breaches of
computer security.</p>
<p>"I don't think people in this country are quite ready to
send someone to the slammer" for launching a computer virus,
said Belden Menkus, a computer-security consultant in
Hillsboro, Tenn. "If there had been a theft of funds, a jail
term would have been more likely." Added Clifford Stoll, a
Harvard University astronomer known as an authority on
computer breakins: "I'm not surprised {by the sentence}
because of the nature of what {Mr. Morris} did and the lack
of malice involved."</p>
<p>During Mr. Morris's trial, his attorney argued that he was
guilty of a mistake rather than a crime. Mr. Morris's virus,
or "worm" program, was designed to spread quietly through
Internet, an electronic mail system used by academic,
corporate and government researchers. But because of a
programming error, Mr. Morris said in his testimony, it
careened out of control. The program sped through thousands
of computers nationwide and disrupted operations at many
computer centers linked by the network.</p>
<p>Federal prosecutors argued that Mr. Morris was guilty of
more than an innocent prank, noting that he stole computer
passwords and designed his program to be difficult to
eradicate from computers.</p>
<p>Among computer professionals, "the consensus was that {Mr.
Morris} should have gotten at least a modest amount of jail
time as a deterrent," said Jack Bologna, editor of Computers
and Security magazine in Plymouth, Mich. "Even 90 days would
have been better than nothing at all."</p>
<p>Mr. Morris plans to appeal his conviction in an attempt to
erase the felony from his record, said Thomas Guidoboni, his
attorney, at a news conference. He added that Mr. Morris
already has had offers from computer-service providers
willing to put him to work to discharge his community-service
requirement. One offer came from a state agency in West
Virginia that wants Mr. Morris to work on computer programs
that help in collecting child-support payments, Mr. Guidoboni
added.</p>
