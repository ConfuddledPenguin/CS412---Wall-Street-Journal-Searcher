	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- The Senate Governmental Affairs Committee
will investigate a potential conflict-of-interest involving a
Washington consulting firm that simultaneously served
Japanese utilities and advised the Energy Department on a
U.S.-Japan energy agreement.
   "We are now learning that foreign and domestic commercial
interests may have had a hand not only in negotiating the
agreement, but in selling it on Capitol Hill," said Sen. John
Glenn (D., Ohio), chairman of the panel. He cited a recent
article in The Wall Street Journal.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The agreement lessened U.S. controls over future shipments
of plutonium to Japan, material derived from U.S. nuclear
fuel. The company, International Energy Associates Ltd., has
admitted that while advising the U.S. on the accord, it
provided newsletters to the Japanese utilities describing the
internal administration fight over the agreement. The
newsletters also discussed "anti-plutonium hard-liners,"
including Sen. Glenn, who were opposed to the pact.</p>
<p>The firm, which has since changed its name to
Environmental & Energy Services Co., insists that it fully
disclosed the newsletter and its contract with the Japanese
utilities to the Energy Department, as it was required to do
by federal law. Energy Department officials say they were
surprised to learn about the newsletters.</p>
