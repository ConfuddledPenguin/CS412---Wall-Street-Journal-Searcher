	<p class="article-leader">MIDLAND, Mich. -- Dow Chemical Co. created a new
environmental corporate vice-president position in an effort
to make the company's world-wide business decisions more
responsive to ecology concerns.
   The company says David T. Buzzelli, president and chief
executive officer of Dow Chemical Canada, has been appointed
vice-president and corporate director of environment, health
and safety. Mr. Buzzelli, a member of Dow Chemical's
management committee, will assume the post on Aug. 1 and will
report directly to Frank Popoff, president and chief
executive officer.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Mr. Buzzelli's job will be to "fully integrate
environmental concerns into all of our business and
operations decisions," Mr. Popoff says. "How we address the
environment will have an enormous impact on our future
success."</p>
<p>Mr. Buzzelli says Dow Chemical faces increasing pressure
to meet higher environmental standards from regulatory
agencies, consumers and communities where plants are located.
In his new role, Mr. Buzzelli will coordinate all of Dow
Chemical's health and safety activities, including
environmental affairs, product testing and occupational
health, which are currently decentralized.</p>
<p>After joining Dow Chemical in 1965 as a chemical engineer,
Mr. Buzzelli held various positions in agricultural chemicals
production, served as director of government and public
affairs, and was appointed head of Dow Canada in 1986.</p>
<p>Denis Wilcock, executive vice-president of Dow Europe,
will succeed Mr. Buzzelli and will join Dow Chemical's
management committee. Yves Bobillier, president of Dow Latin
America, has been named executive vice-president of Dow
Europe with responsibility for the plastics group.</p>
