	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- State governments are bracing themselves for
two Supreme Court decisions, expected in the next few weeks,
that could force them to pay billions of dollars in tax
refunds.
   The two cases raise the question of whether the U.S.
Constitution requires states to pay refunds to taxpayers when
state taxes are ruled unconstitutional. If the answer from
the high court is affirmative, the implications could be
staggering.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"The stakes are just enormous for the states," says Walter
Hellerstein, a University of Georgia Law School professor and
tax-law expert.</p>
<p>The Multistate Tax Commission, an organization
representing state tax officials, found that 30 states could
face potential tax-refund liability of $6.5 billion. "If
refunds . . . are too readily available, state and local
governments will face not only revenue shortfalls but also
unexpected and potentially ruinous liability," said the State
and Local Legal Center, which represents state and local
government groups.</p>
<p>The cases before the high court involve two types of
taxes, but the outcome could apply much more widely.</p>
<p>In one case, the justices are considering an appeal by the
American Trucking Associations of an Arkansas Supreme Court
decision. Relying on an earlier U.S. Supreme Court decision,
the Arkansas court in March 1988, ruled that the state's
highway-use tax discriminated in favor of trucking companies
based in Arkansas and against companies based in other
states. But the Arkansas court said no refunds were required
for taxes already paid.</p>
<p>According to a brief filed by a group of states, the
highway-use tax issue is pending in five states -- Arkansas,
Pennsylvania, Kentucky, New Jersey and Vermont. Potential
refunds total $630.9 million plus interest.</p>
<p>The second case before the high court involves an appeal
by McKesson Corp., a San Francisco-based liquor distributor,
which successfully challenged a 1985 Florida law that gave
tax preferences to alcoholic beverages made from Florida
products, such as citrus and sugar cane. In February 1988,
the Florida Supreme Court ruled that the tax was
discriminatory and unconstitutional, but declined to order
refunds. Lawyers representing McKesson say they don't know
how much of a refund would be involved if the Supreme Court
were to order one now. A similar issue also has arisen in
Georgia over a liquor tax.</p>
<p>But the greatest impact of the high court's ruling, by
far, could involve another kind of tax. In March 1989, the
high court struck down a Michigan law that taxed the pension
benefits of retired federal employees but exempted the
retirement income of state and local government workers. The
justices said states could tax all government pensions or
none, but couldn't discriminate.</p>
<p>The high court didn't say whether the states had to refund
the taxes already collected. According to a recent survey by
the Federation of Tax Administrators, an organization of
state tax officials, lawsuits for refunds have been filed in
24 states, and the potential liability of those states is
nearly $2 billion. Many of those states are awaiting the
outcome of the two pending Supreme Court decisions to decide
whether to make refunds.</p>
<p>Of course, the court could rule that states may follow
their own tax laws in deciding whether to make refunds, or
that there is no federal constitutional requirement that
invalid taxes be refunded.</p>
<p>"If the states can enact unconstitutional tax laws without
worrying about the consequences, that's very significant,"
says Professor Hellerstein, who is advising McKesson in the
case. "With no refund remedy, you have no deterrent effect,"
he says.</p>
<p>The court also might decide the two cases on more
technical, narrow grounds that would render the impact
uncertain on the pension disputes and many other lawsuits
raising tax-refund issues, a few of which have been brought
to the court's attention in briefs.</p>
<p>Whatever the outcome, the cases have been difficult for
the justices. They heard arguments in March 1989, and ordered
a second round of arguments last December. Says Andrew Frey,
a Washington lawyer representing the American Trucking
Associations, "Obviously something about these cases is
giving the court extraordinary difficulty. That suggests
they're considering a ruling that would have significant
ramifications for state taxes."</p>
