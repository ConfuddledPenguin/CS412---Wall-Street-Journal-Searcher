	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- It remains to be seen whether Pink Sheets
stocks, the Rodney Dangerfields of the securities industry,
will get some respect with the June 1 launch of the OTC
Bulletin Board.
   "You can't make a silk purse out of a sow's ear," says
Lawrence J. Goldstein, general partner of Santa Monica
Partners in New York. As an active investor in the fitfully
traded Pink Sheets stocks, he wonders how soon the new
electronic system can meet its two-fold purpose: to provide
greater ease of trading and closer surveillance for these
stocks.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>But if the computerized market catches on, Mr. Goldstein
and others say, it is likely to make the shares of thousands
of obscure companies more visible and less susceptible to
fraud. It also will boost the exposure of several hundred
foreign companies such as Japan's Nintendo Co. and West
Germany's Deutsche Bank AG, which trade over the counter
because they don't meet larger markets' tougher disclosure
rules.</p>
<p>The OTC Bulletin Board, approved last week by the
Securities and Exchange Commission, was developed by the
National Association of Securities Dealers, the
self-regulatory body for the over-the-counter market. NASD
President Joseph Hardiman says the system is designed to
better regulate some of the thousands of OTC stocks that
aren't traded on NASD's electronic trading system, and to
give these stocks greater visibility among investors.</p>
<p>NASD estimates that 47,000 issues are traded over the
counter in the U.S. Of these, 4,300 meet its
minimum-net-worth and other standards for trading
electronically on the National Association of Securities
Dealers Automated Quotations system, or Nasdaq.</p>
<p>About 10,000 to 12,000 of the more active issues are
available to dealers once a day in the Pink Sheets, published
since 1913 by New Jersey-based National Quotation Bureau
Inc., a subsidiary of Commerce Clearing House Inc.,
Riverwoods, Ill. First printed on colored paper in the 1920s
to reduce glare from incandescent lights, the Pink Sheets now
consist of a 330-page volume or electronic list delivered
daily to 2,000 customers, says David Burnett, president of
the National Quotation Bureau.</p>
<p>"The Pink Sheets are a primitive communications device,"
concedes Mr. Burnett, whose company has a one-year contract
to provide NASD with data for the bulletin board. He adds
that there are some crucial differences between the OTC
Bulletin Board and the Nasdaq system launched in 1971.</p>
<p>"It's a Nasdaq with no Ten Commandments," he contends.</p>
<p>The OTC Bulletin Board is designed to provide dealers
electronically with Pink Sheet stock quotes throughout the
day, instead of once daily. Using their current Nasdaq
terminals, NASD member firms' market makers will be able, but
not obliged, to enter or update price quotations on Pink
Sheets stocks.</p>
<p>Dealers in Nasdaq stocks now are required to provide firm
bid and asked, or selling, prices at the risk of facing fines
or suspension if they don't honor their quotes. But OTC
Bulletin Board dealers will be able simply to list their
names and phone numbers, with no bid or asked prices. They
can list "unfirm" prices or firm quotes.</p>
<p>The system will sort the listings, with firm quotes at the
top and the least-firm interest at the bottom. A dealer
failing to honor a firm quote may face enforcement action.
But there's nothing to make a dealer offer a firm quote,
notes Mr. Burnett. He predicts that as Nasdaq slowly
tightened its requirements as it evolved, so will the
bulletin board become stricter.</p>
<p>Mr. Goldstein says several dealers told him that they will
be reluctant to tip their hands on the bulletin board. Some
dealers may be surprised to find there simply aren't any
sellers for some Pink Sheets stocks, he adds. In Mr.
Goldstein's view, the market won't become truly competitive
until stock quotes and other information are available to
investors through their brokers rather than one step removed
at the dealer level. On the other hand, intraday information
"may shed some light where there's been none before."</p>
<p>Since last week's approval, 13 NASD members have signed
contracts to use the bulletin board, according to S. William
Broka, NASD vice president of business development. Troster
Singer Corp., one of the nation's largest traders of Pink
Sheet stocks, is ready to go with the new trading system,
says Ralph Valentino, president of the Jersey City, N.J.,
brokerage firm. He explains that now his brokers make at
least three telephone calls to get competing quotes on Pink
Sheets stocks before executing an order. With quotes
available on a computer screen, they will be able to execute
orders faster. Data on foreign stocks will be updated only
twice a day while that for U.S. stocks will be updated
continuously.</p>
<p>While the Pink Sheets stocks may become easier to trade,
NASD's Mr. Hardiman cautions, they're not for everyone. "A
lot, if not all of them in this market, are speculative
stocks," he warns. He excludes from this group some of the
larger foreign issues whose American depositary receipts
trade in the Pink Sheets.</p>
<p>A more upbeat view comes from Mr. Goldstein, the Pink
Sheets investor. "It's just like Nasdaq," he says. "There's
junk and blue chips and everything in between."</p>

<p>Friday's Market Activity</p>
<p>Last week's rally in technology stocks helped the
over-the-counter market recover to its highest level in three
weeks.</p>
<p>Friday, the Nasdaq Composite Index gained 3.17 points, or
0.75%, to 428.61. OTC advancers led declining shares, 1,091
to 776. Volume slipped to 136.8 million shares from 160.9
million shares. The Nasdaq Composite Index added 2.5% for the
week, lagging behind the 4.4% gain for the Nasdaq 100 index,
which includes some of the largest technology stocks.</p>
<p>AST Research gained 2 1/4 to 23 1/4 after the Irvine,
Calif., maker of personal computer systems said it signed a
patent cross-licensing agreement with International Business
Machines.</p>
<p>Drexler Technology tumbled 2 to 4 1/2. Late Thursday, the
Mountain View, Calif., maker of optical data products
reported a loss from continuing operations of 28 cents a
share for the fiscal fourth quarter ended March 31, compared
with profit from continuing operations of 85 cents a share a
year earlier.</p>
