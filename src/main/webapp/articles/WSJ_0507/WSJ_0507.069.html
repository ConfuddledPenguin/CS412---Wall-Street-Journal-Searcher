	<p class="article-leader">The Belzberg family's FarWest Financial Corp.'s $26.2
million first-quarter loss leaves the big California
thrift-holding company roughly $140 million short of a
federal capital requirement it must satisfy to survive.
   FarWest's loss, disclosed late Friday, is equal to $3.36 a
share. It resulted from a $36 million reduction in the
carrying value of the company's junk-bond portfolio, once one
of the largest among thrifts. The company now has a tangible
capital ratio of slightly more than 1% of assets, nearly $20
million short of the required 1.5%. But more importantly, it
appears to be about $140 million short of meeting a stricter
so-called risk-based capital requirement. In the year-earlier
period, FarWest earned $5.6 million.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>In New York Stock Exchange composite trading Friday,
FarWest shares closed at $2.125, unchanged.</p>
<p>Canada's Belzberg family is FarWest's controlling
shareholder; William Belzberg is chairman. Unless the family
provides a capital infusion, FarWest will have difficulty
complying with the capital requirements. The company said it
continues to negotiate a compliance plan with regulators.
Failure to meet capital standards can result in federal
sanctions, including seizure of the institution.</p>
<p>FarWest is one of about a half-dozen big California
thrifts who have faltered or failed this year because of
diversification either outside California or outside
traditional home mortgage lending. Junk-bond losses are
likely to cause the failure of another big Los Angeles
thrift, Columbia Savings & Loan Association.</p>
<p>FarWest accumulated a junk-bond portfolio of $667 million,
much of it purchased in the 40 days prior to the August 1989
passage of the thrift-rescue legislation. That law required
thrifts to get out of the junk-bond business and, in effect,
carry those bonds at the lower of cost or market value. The
junk-bond market has plummeted since last fall as some highly
leveraged companies failed or sought refinancing. Junk-bond
sales by thrifts have worsened the decline in values.</p>
<p>FarWest reported a 1989 net loss of $46.1 million, or
$5.90 a share, mostly because of junk-bond write-downs taken
in the fourth quarter. According to data compiled by Miami
thrift analyst Kenneth Thomas, the company sold $274 million
of high-yield, high-risk bonds in the fourth quarter, leaving
it with $393 million of junk bonds. FarWest shrank again in
the first period, to $4 billion in assets from $4.35 billion,
but it didn't say whether the decline resulted from more
junk-bond sales.</p>
