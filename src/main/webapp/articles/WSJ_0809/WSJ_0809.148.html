	<p class="article-leader">GORBACHEV GAVE himself two years to improve the Soviet
Union's economy.
   On the third day of a Communist Party congress, the Soviet
president and party leader told a TV reporter, "I think that
in two years, if there are no changes, this leadership must
go." It was the first time he set a deadline for turning
around the country's economic and social problems. Contrary
to some expectations, the congress hasn't turned into an
all-out attack on Gorbachev, though both he and his Politburo
colleagues have taken sharp criticism. Instead, moderates and
hard-liners are engaged in a painful search for ways to
ensure the future existence of the party.</p>

opposition to swift unification.</p>
