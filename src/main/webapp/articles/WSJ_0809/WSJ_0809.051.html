	<p class="article-leader">LONDON -- SmithKline Beecham PLC, an Anglo-American health
and household products company, said it had a 6.5% rise in
second-quarter pretax profit, as the period's performance was
highlighted by continued sales growth, strong trading profits
and significant debt reduction.
   The two companies that merged in July 1989 to form the
present concern were previously known as Beecham PLC of the
U.K. and SmithKline Beckman Corp. of the U.S. The results are
the second set reported on a quarterly basis since the
merger.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>At a news conference yesterday, Chief Executive Robert P.
Bauman said he was "delighted" with the company's
performance. He attributed the strong trading profit partly
to rising profit margins. "That is the result of the merger,
and the increased efficiencies we're getting," he said.</p>
<p>Unlike other executives in Britain who have reported
earnings recently, Mr. Bauman was fairly upbeat about his
company's prospects. "We do plan to see continued earnings
improvement," he said.</p>
<p>In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange
yesterday, SmithKline equity units (made up of five ordinary
shares plus one preferred share) closed at $46.875, up $3.50.</p>
<p>Year-earlier figures represent like-for-like comparisons,
as if the merger had been in place in the second quarter of
1989. A year-earlier dividend payment wasn't included in the
results.</p>
<p>Pretax profit rose to #197 million ($369.2 million) from
#185 million in the second quarter of 1989. These figures
were at the top end of market expectations, which ranged
between #175 million and #200 million.</p>
<p>Sales climbed 2.5% to #1.21 billion from #1.18 billion.
Per-share earnings rose to 9.3 pence, up 2.2% from 9.1 pence
in the corresponding year-earlier period.</p>
<p>Health and household products analyst Barbara Arzymanow of
Kleinwort Benson Securities in London said the market
welcomed SmithKline's earnings, which she said were better
than widely expected.</p>
<p>Several SmithKline Beecham drugs posted strong sales
gains. Sales of Augmentin, an antibiotic, rose 32% in the
second quarter and 36% in the first half; sales of Engerix-B,
the company's hepatitis-B vaccine, grew 75% in the second
quarter and 95% in the first half. Sales of Tagamet, the
SmithKline Beecham anti-ulcer drug subject to increasing
competition, rose 6% in the second quarter but slipped 1% in
the first half.</p>
<p>Roughly 45% of SmithKline Beecham's sales are in the U.S.,
while Britain and continental Europe account for about 40%.
Sales in Japan account for much of the remaining 15%.</p>
