	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- A Securities and Exchange Commission
administrative law judge suspended a Bear, Stearns & Co.
broker for at least two years for his alleged role in a
celebrated insider-trading scheme involving former LTV Corp.
Chairman Paul Thayer.
   The decision, against William Mathis, an Atlanta sales
representative for the New York-based brokerage house, stems
from alleged trading on insider information in the takeover
bids by LTV for Grumman Corp., Anheuser-Busch Cos. for
Campbell Taggert Inc., and Allied Corp. for Bendix Corp.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The SEC said that Mr. Thayer, who was on the boards of
Anheuser-Busch and Allied, passed inside information to Billy
Bob Harris, a former A.G. Edwards & Co. broker who, in turn,
tipped Mr. Mathis. In 1985, Messrs. Thayer and Harris pleaded
guilty to criminal charges of obstructing justice and lying
to the SEC during the investigation. They each received
four-year prison terms and later were forced to disgorge
profits.</p>
<p>Mr. Mathis, the former captain of the New York Jets team
that won the Super Bowl in 1969, agreed to an SEC injunction
in 1988 the day before he was to be tried for his role in the
scheme. Without admitting or denying wrongdoing, he agreed to
a settlement prohibiting him from violating securities laws
in the future.</p>
<p>The SEC then attempted to sanction Mr. Mathis partly
because the agency said he netted more than $750,000 from the
transactions. But Mr. Mathis argued that he couldn't be
sanctioned in a way that would deprive him of his livelihood
without a separate finding by the agency that he violated
securities laws. Since he hadn't admitted any wrongdoing in
the consent injunction, he argued that SEC was overstepping
its authority.</p>
<p>Mr. Mathis's lawyer said his client considers the two-year
suspension "absolutely unjustified." Mahlon Frankhauser, the
lawyer, said his client was being penalized "merely because
he agreed to the entry of an injunction without admitting or
denying any violations." Mr. Frankhauser said Mr. Mathis
probably wouldn't appeal the decision because "he has been
both financially and psychologically exhausted by the staff
of the Securities and Exchange Commission."</p>
<p>An administrative law judge, Brenda Murray, rejected Mr.
Mathis's arguments, siding with the SEC that it was in the
public interest to bar him from the securities business. The
administrative law judge agreed with the agency that Mr.
Mathis lied to the SEC and to the New York Stock Exchange in
their investigations about the trading.</p>
<p>For example, Mr. Mathis told the SEC that he borrowed
money from Mr. Harris's father to buy Grumman shares and that
Mr. Harris recommended that Mr. Mathis buy Grumman stock, the
administrative law judge said. But in earlier SEC testimony,
Mr. Mathis had told the agency that he never discussed
Grumman with Mr. Harris, she added.</p>
<p>"Mr. Mathis's reasons for lying or misleading
investigating authorities . . . do not in any way excuse or
mitigate his actions," the administrative law judge said.
"The evidence is that his actions were deliberate."</p>
<p>Bear Stearns Chairman Alan Greenberg said, "This is
something that happened in 1982, and I feel bad about the
whole thing. I certainly like Bill Mathis." A spokeswoman for
the firm said Mr. Mathis, who has been employed there since
1970, would be leaving within 15 days.</p>
<p>Mr. Mathis can apply to be reinstated to the securities
industry in two years.</p>
