	<p class="article-leader">Stung by public outcries of price gouging and an
admonition by President Bush to "show restraint," several
major oil companies said they were either cutting or freezing
gasoline prices.
   Phillips Petroleum Co. said it is reducing its wholesale
gasoline price by 4.5 cents a gallon, effective yesterday.
Atlantic Richfield Co. said it is freezing prices for a week.
British Petroleum Co.'s U.S. unit said it will hold prices at
current levels. And a Chevron Corp. spokesman said the
company was "holding for the moment" but can't commit for a
full week because the marketplace is so volatile.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"It's the kind of response the president sought from the
industry," said James Watkins, the U.S. energy secretary.
"It's truly commendable."</p>
<p>Gasoline prices nationwide have soared an average of 16
cents a gallon since Iraq invaded Kuwait last week. The
run-up sparked intense congressional hearings earlier this
week that had oil companies on the defensive. A number of
states and the federal government said they would look into
charges of antitrust violations.</p>
<p>Then, toward the end of his speech yesterday morning, the
president said: "I'm asking the oil companies to do their
fair share. They should show restraint and not abuse today's
uncertainties to raise prices."</p>
<p>Phillips, based in Bartlesville, Okla., said it was
cutting prices at some of its gasoline terminals because of
declining prices in the petroleum market. The company said it
would review its prices daily. Chairman C.J. Silas said the
company "supports the actions being taken by President Bush"
and will continue to show restraint in its gasoline pricing.</p>
<p>In Los Angeles, an Arco spokesman responded, "We are
complying with President Bush's request to hold the line on
prices." He said the freeze only applies to prices going up.
If the marketplace allows, Arco could cut its prices within a
week, the spokesman said.</p>
<p>Arco's policy initially drew some snickers in light of the
huge industrywide run-up that has already occurred. But the
spokesman said the company, known as an aggressive
price-cutter, had only raised its wholesale prices four cents
a gallon since the Iraqi invasion. Arco has an advantage over
some of its West Coast competitors, such as Chevron, because
its supply, in effect, is its own Alaskan crude. Unlike most
other oil refiners, Arco doesn't have to buy much oil in the
open market.</p>
<p>San Francisco-based Chevron, meanwhile, said it will raise
prices "only when it becomes absolutely necessary." Chevron
Chairman Ken Derr urged the company's dealers and jobbers to
also exercise restraint.</p>
<p>BP America Inc., based in Cleveland, said it would be
"looking for opportunities to reduce some prices" if it can
do so without "generating a run on storage terminals that
would prevent us from supplying our customers."</p>
<p>While other companies didn't immediately announce any
changes, more shifts are possible in reaction to these
initial moves. By breaking with the industry pattern of the
past week, these companies may be putting competitive
pressure on their rivals, both in the marketplace and from a
public relations standpoint.</p>
<p>Most big oil companies that didn't announce any changes
yesterday generally scrambled to endorse the President's call
for pricing restraint.</p>
<p>In White Plains, N.Y., Texaco Inc. said it "fully supports
President Bush's call for the exercise of restraint on
gasoline prices." The company added, "We have been doing so
in recent days, and we fully intend to continue."</p>
<p>Amoco Corp., based in Chicago, said it was committed to
"prudent and responsible pricing." The company said it has
increased its wholesale gasoline prices on average only 10
cents a gallon since Aug. 1, compared with a run-up of 20
cents on the spot gasoline market.</p>
<p>In a telegram to the president, Mobil Corp. Chairman Allen
Murray wrote, "We will continue to show restraint in the face
of escalating prices for crude oil and petroleum products
purchased by our U.S. marketing and refining business." Mr.
Murray went on to say that while Mobil has raised gasoline
prices, it hasn't yet recovered all of the higher costs it
has incurred.</p>
<p>Exxon Corp. said it will continue to price "its products
in a responsible manner that reflects overall market and
supply conditions."</p>
