	<p class="article-leader">North Fork Bancorp Inc. said it "would not be prepared" to
acquire Eastchester Financial Corp. at the agreed price of
$20 a share because of Eastchester's current financial
condition.
   North Fork, of Mattituck, N.Y., said in a statement that
it told Eastchester it would be willing to complete the deal
on "significantly different terms" than those it reached in
April, when it agreed to pay $79.5 million for Eastchester,
whose main unit is Eastchester Savings Bank. North Fork said
it doesn't know whether Eastchester will consider revised
terms.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Eastchester reported a second-quarter loss of $1.2
million, or 31 cents a share, including a loan-loss provision
of $2.6 million.</p>
<p>Officials of Eastchester couldn't be reached for comment.</p>
