	<p class="article-leader">Temple-Inland Inc., of Diboll, Texas, said its Inland
Container Corp. unit agreed in principle to acquire two
box-making companies and made plans to upgrade and expand an
existing mill. The combined costs of the acquisitions and
expansion will be about $100 million.
   Inland Container wouldn't say how much it intends to pay
for either Crockett Container Corp. of Santa Fe Springs,
Calif., or Pakway Container Corp. of Indianapolis. But Inland
Container said the two privately owned companies had annual
sales in their last fiscal years totaling about $115 million.
Inland Container said its 1989 sales exceeded $1.1 billion.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Inland Container said the acquisitions would increase its
corrugated-box production by about 10%. The company said it
intends to keep existing management at Crockett and Pakway.</p>
<p>The two acquisitions are subject to the execution of
definitive agreements, Temple-Inland said.</p>
<p>Temple-Inland is a wood-products and financial-services
company that earned $207.4 million last year, or $7.50 a
share, on revenue of $2.12 billion.</p>
