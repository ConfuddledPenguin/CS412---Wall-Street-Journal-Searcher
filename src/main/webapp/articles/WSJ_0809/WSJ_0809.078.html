	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON (AP) -- Mirrors being built for a $747 million
series of weather satellites have been found to warp and
become useless in the temperature extremes of space, NASA
officials said.
   The problem marks the second time in recent months that a
NASA project has been seriously affected by failed mirror
technology. Engineers found in June that a mirror aboard the
$1.5 billion Hubble Space Telescope was ground to the wrong
specifications.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>A spokesman for NASA said the new flaw was discovered by
ITT Aerospace, a subcontractor for the project, and that the
weather satellites can't be completed and launched until a
solution is found. The mirrors are being built for a
satellite to be launched in February 1992 as the first of
five in a series of robot weather observers.</p>
<p>Agency spokesman Bryan Dunbar said engineers for NASA, ITT
and Ford Aerospace, the prime contractor, are scrambling to
correct the problem in time for the 1992 launch, and it is
possible that there could be no delay if a solution is found
quickly.</p>
<p>Managers of the NASA program were not available for
comment, Mr. Dunbar said.</p>
<p>NASA is supervising construction of the weather satellites
for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. The
craft scheduled for 1992 launch will supplement the single
satellite that NOAA now has for cloud-cover observations over
the U.S.</p>
