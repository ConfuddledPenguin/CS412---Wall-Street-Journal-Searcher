	<p class="article-leader">President Bush's rhetoric is low-key, but his actions
these past few days can be seen as a systematic preparation
for dispatching the Iraqi aggressor and setting up permanent
protections for the world's oil sources around the Persian
Gulf.
   First the President rallied worldwide economic sanctions,
primarily a boycott of Iraqi oil and a freezing of Iraqi
assets. He moved from there to gain U.N. support for a
military blockade of Iraqi ports. He obtained Saudi Arabia's
acquiescence for the dispatch of U.S. forces to that country,
something the Saudis had never before been willing to allow.
Then he began moving air, naval and ground forces to the
region. Yesterday, he went on TV to give a calm explanation
of all this to the American people and the world. Tomorrow,
Secretary of State James Baker will visit U.S. NATO allies in
Europe to plot further strategy.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>NATO cooperation is already unfolding. Britain offered air
and naval forces yesterday after a cabinet meeting. West
German law prohibits out-of-country use of German forces, but
Bonn yesterday said the U.S. could use German bases for
supporting the Gulf action. Italy, a country that has far
stronger naval forces than most people know, seems likely to
have a part in the deployments, though it has made no
specific commitments. Turkey, a NATO member, has been visited
by U.S. F-111s that are technically on an "exercise" but also
happen to be within easy striking distance of Iraq. Even the
Saudi air force, equipped with the best planes oil money
could buy, is not nothing.</p>
<p>"I have told our brothers in Iraq, I am afraid that Iraq
will be struck by a harsh strike from the outside. Don't
think that the fleets are just going to sit there sleeping,"
Egyptian Presidnet Hosni Mubarak said in an address
yesterday. This warning to Saddam Hussein should not be
overlooked even though President Mubarak denied reports from
Washington that he has committed Egyptian forces to the Bush
deployments. He would prefer an all-Arab force, but surely
must know it is too late for that. Having watched his boss
Abdel Nasser overreach himself against Israel 23 years ago,
Mr. Mubarak wants an immediate Arab summit to try to talk
Hussein out of his madness.</p>
<p>For once deployments are in place, with or without
Egyptian troops, Saddam Hussein will face a multinational
force with enormous destructive power. Constructing an
overwhelming force would take several weeks, but by then it
would guarantee, if necessary, a short and decisive conquest
of Iraq. Saddam's missile batteries could be taken out, and
his air force destroyed. With no air cover in a desert
region, his tanks and armored personnel carriers would be a
shooting gallery for allied pilots. Meanwhile, his arms sit
in the hot desert sun, waiting.</p>
<p>If Saddam launches a pre-emptive strike of his own, that
will make things messier, but will have little bearing on the
final outcome. The other thing would be capitulation, but the
capitulation probably would have to be total, most likely
including disarmament and the installation of a new, moderate
leadership in Iraq. This, and not some mushy compromise, is
certainly the appropriate object of the efforts now being
expended by President Bush and the whole NATO alliance.</p>
<p>The task, however, would not end with Saddam Hussein. The
allied forces will be in position to take steps to ensure
that there are no further crises of this type in the Persian
Gulf. That will entail a permanent force of some power in the
region.</p>
<p>It would also mean that all Mideast governments will be
held to higher standards of behavior than has been the case
in the past. Syria, which allows radicals to play hostage
games with the West on territory that is nominally under its
control, will want to reconsider its position. Iran's
Rafsanjani will have a new reason to press for a
rapprochement with the West. Libya's Gadhafi will find
himself very lonely. Little King Hussein of Jordan, who
decided at the wrong time to hold Saddam Hussein's coat, has
some rapid calculating to do.</p>
<p>The boldness of Mr. Bush and the West means, in short,
that the world changed suddenly a few months ago and Arab
dictators missed the signal. Their big friend, the Soviet
Union, lost a Cold War and suddenly has become desperate for
Western economic aid. It can no longer offer much help to its
Middle East "clients." Saddam blustered that, without the
Soviets, he would have a free hand. On present course, he now
is learning that just the opposite is true.</p>
<p>A great opportunity has dropped into the laps of George
Bush and his NATO allies, in short, an opportunity to pacify
one of the world's most troublesome regions. The President is
approaching that opportunity in a systematic way. It seems
unlikely that he will let it slip through his fingers.</p>
