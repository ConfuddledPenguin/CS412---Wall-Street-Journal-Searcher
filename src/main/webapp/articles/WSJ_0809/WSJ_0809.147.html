	<p class="article-leader">BUSH OPENED the economic summit amid differences over aid
for the Soviets.
   The U.S., West Germany and Japan agreed to diverge on the
issue of providing aid to Moscow and Beijing, but the leaders
of the largest industrial nations were seeking agreement on
several other difficult issues at the 16th annual economic
summit in Houston. The U.S. has accepted that Bonn is going
ahead with providing assistance to the Kremlin, and that
Japan is planning to resume lending to China. But the U.S.
aggressively pressed European nations to reduce their
trade-distorting subsidies for many agricultural goods.</p>

that the summit partners will take a variety of approaches on

<p>GORBACHEV WON approval for redesigning the Communist
Party's Politburo.</p>
<p>Advancing the Soviet president's campaign to maintain
control of the party while restructuring its leadership,
delegates to a party congress voted by a large margin to back
his proposal for bringing the party chiefs from the 15
republics into an enlarged Politburo. The new lineup means
that more moderates will be included in the policymaking
body, and that the restive republics will be given expanded
powers. The revised membership rules also will erode the
traditional domination of the Politburo by the Russian
hard-liners.</p>

Communist regime.</p>

<p>NASA officials said they haven't pinpointed the mysterious

know which part of the system is leaking.</p>

workers are taking part in the nationwide walkout.</p>

settlers operate a civil guard in occupied lands.</p>

African President de Klerk weren't enough.</p>
