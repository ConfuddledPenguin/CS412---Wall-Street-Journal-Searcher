	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Turmoil in the Persian Gulf reverberated once
again through the credit markets yesterday, disrupting the
Treasury's big quarterly auction of government securities.
   "It was a horror show," said F. Ward McCarthy Jr., a
managing director at Stone & McCarthy Research Associates.
"This auction was an absolute disaster. The bidding was
sloppy, and it looks like a lot of people tried to miss the
auction."</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The disappointment in yesterday's auction spilled over
onto the broader bond market, causing prices to gyrate
wildly. The market recovered later in the day with the
benchmark 30-year Treasury bond posting gains of about 3/8
point, or $3.75 for a bond with a $1,000 face amount.</p>
<p>The Treasury had difficulty selling $10.5 billion of
ten-year notes yesterday in the second portion of the
government's three-part $32.25 billion quarterly refunding of
the federal debt. The ten-year note sale followed a weak
three-year note auction on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Analysts said investors and dealers avoided the auction
due to fears that spiraling oil prices and Mideast turmoil
will lead to rising inflation -- the bane of the bond market.
The poor auction results also reflect the lack of buying by
Japanese and other foreign investors.</p>
<p>"When I called some of my clients overseas, they seemed to
suggest that U.S. rates are not that attractive and not worth
the currency risk," said Maria Fiorini Ramirez, president of
Maria Ramirez Capital Consultants Inc.</p>
<p>Foreign institutional investors -- especially from Japan
and the Middle East -- have been big buyers of U.S. Treasury
securities at previous auctions. But in recent months, yields
on government bonds in Japan have risen sharply and are now
nearly as high as U.S. yields. As a result, Japanese
investors are keeping their cash at home. Investors from the
Middle East, preoccupied with more important matters, didn't
show up in a big way either.</p>
<p>At yesterday's Treasury auction, the average yield on the
10-year notes was 8.77%. But because there wasn't enough
demand at the average yield, the Treasury was forced to
accept bids as high as 8.84% to complete the auction.</p>
<p>The uncommonly wide spread between the average and high
yield, called a "tail," is an indication that bond dealers
were reluctant to bid for the securities. The tail at
yesterday's auction was the longest since May 1980, according
to Dean Witter Reynolds Inc.</p>
<p>"Dealers did not bid aggressively because they did not see
any interest from their client base," said Lawrence Leuzzi, a
trading manager at S.G. Warburg & Co. (Only a small group of
brokerage firms and commercial banks are allowed to bid at
Treasury auctions. These firms then resell the securities to
customers. Individuals, however, can purchase securities
directly from the Treasury through "noncompetitive" tenders.)</p>
<p>Another indication that the Treasury had difficulty
selling its securities was the "bid-to-cover" ratio, which
measures the number of bids the Treasury receives for each
one it accepts. At yesterday's sale, bid-to-cover ratio was
1.59, the lowest since 1978, according to Dean Witter. The
bid-to-cover ratio averaged 2.37 at the 12 previous 10-year
note auctions and was 3.0 at the previous 10-year note sale
in May.</p>
<p>William Brachfeld, manager of trading at the New York
office of Japan's Daiwa Securities Inc., estimates that the
"Big Four" Japanese securities firms bought 15% of the
ten-year notes, down from 25% to 30% at recent 10-year
auctions. And much of yesterday's purchases went into
speculative trading accounts, not long-term investment
accounts.</p>
<p>Shortly after the auction ended, dealers who bought the
bonds were forced to cut prices in an attempt to attract
buyers. As prices slid, traders said that demand suddenly
materialized.</p>
<p>"Some investors were afraid to buy at the auction, but
when the average yield reached 8.80%, investors found that to
be very attractive," said Thomas Murphy, a managing director
at Salomon Brother Inc.</p>
<p>Noncompetitive bids at yesterday's auction, the best
indication of demand from individual investors and small
institutions, totaled $560 million compared with $659 million
at the previous 10-year note auction in May.</p>
<p>The auction results sent shock waves through the bond
market and caused prices to abruptly reverse directions. Bond
prices were 1/4 point higher before the auction results were
announced, then fell 1/4 point when the government released
the auction statistics at 2:30 p.m. EDT. The market improved
later in the day and prices ended mixed.</p>
<p>The Treasury's quarterly auction continues today with the
sale of $10.25 billion of 30-year bonds.</p>
<p>Economists and dealers are not optimistic about the
prospects of today's auction. "If {investors and dealers} are
running away from the 10-year notes like this, one can only
wonder what's going to happen when it comes time to buy the
{30-year} bond," said Robert Brusca, chief economist at Nikko
Securities.</p>
<p>Treasury Securities</p>
<p>Treasury prices ended mixed yesterday, with short-term
notes posting modest losses while long-term bonds posted
gains.</p>
<p>The Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond ended at a price of
about 99 3/32 to yield 8.82% compared with 98 23/32 on
Tuesday to yield 8.86%. The new three-year notes, which were
auctioned Tuesday, ended yesterday at a price of 99 17/32,
down from 101 3/32 on Tuesday. The issue's yield rose to
8.16% from 8.14%.</p>
<p>Prices of the old ten-year notes ended at 100 27/32, up
from 100 21/32 on Tuesday. The yield fell to 8.72% from
8.75%.</p>
<p>Here are details of yesterday's auction:</p>
<p>Rates are determined by the difference between the
purchase price and face value. Thus, higher bidding narrows
the investor's return while lower bidding widens it.</p>
<p>                    10-Year Notes</p>
<p>Applications                              $16,737,124,000</p>

<p>The notes are dated Aug. 15 and mature Aug. 15, 2000.</p>
<p>Corporate, Junk Bonds</p>
<p>The junk-bond market disregarded stock market gains and
ended weaker yesterday.</p>
<p>Although the Dow Jones Industrial Average closed almost 25
points higher at 2734.90, most junk-bond prices finished
between 1/4 and 3/8 points lower. Junk bonds are high-yield
high-risk corporate securities that have low credit ratings
or no credit ratings at all.</p>
<p>In the investment-grade corporate debt market, high-grade
corporate bonds closed unchanged to slightly higher.</p>
<p>Foreign Bonds</p>
<p>Japanese government bonds ended sharply higher as
short-covering in the final hour of trading developed into a
mad scramble to buy Japanese government bonds and futures
contracts.</p>
<p>The rally was triggered by news that Saudi Arabia plans to
increase production of oil. Fears that oil shortages would
lead to higher prices and spiraling inflation has shaken bond
markets around the world, but the Japanese market was hurt
the hardest.</p>
<p>The hectic short-covering drove down the yield on Japan's
benchmark 10-year bond below 8%. The jump in prices quickly
pushed developments in the Persian Gulf into the background
as traders feared the market would get away from them.</p>
<p>"Traders didn't have time to think about the situation in
the Middle East," said one dealer at a major Japanese
commercial bank. For traders taking positions day-to-day the
late surge in prices "was very fearful," he said.</p>
<p>The benchmark No. 119 10-year bond ended at a price of
83.97, up 0.93 point. The issue's yield fell 0.20 percentage
point to 7.875%. (When calculated using the semiannual
compound method, the yield on the No. 119 ended at 7.29%,
according to Salomon Brothers Inc.)</p>
<p>The heavy buying hit futures first and quickly spread to
the cash market. "Then there was massive buying by securities
houses," said one dealer, especially by the so-called Big
Four Japanese securities firms. "People went on a sort of
panic buying spree" as prices started to pick up in the
middle of the afternoon and "shorts were afraid the market
was moving away from them."</p>
<p>Dealers and professional traders, betting that prices will
fall, sometimes sell borrowed securities and hope to profit
by replacing what was borrowed with cheaper securities. That
is called a short sale. Short-covering occurs when the
dealers buy securities to replace what they borrowed.</p>
<p>Bond prices ended weaker in Europe, although trading was
generally light in most markets. French government bonds fell
sharply as market participants remained gripped by the Middle
East crisis. But prices were just moderately lower in West
Germany and Britain.</p>
<p>Municipal Bonds</p>
<p>Municipal bonds were generally flat to 1/4 point lower.</p>
<p>The market's downward bias was primarily because of swings
in Treasurys and continued inflation worries.</p>
<p>Among actively traded issues, the New Jersey Turnpike
Authority's 7.20% securities of 2018 finished virtually
unchanged at 97 3/4, with the yield falling to 7.37% from
7.38% late Tuesday.</p>
<p>In new issue activity, $600 million of Massachusetts
general obligation bond anticipation notes were priced by a
Goldman, Sachs & Co. group.</p>
<p>The notes, which are due Oct. 17, 1990, are 7% issues
priced to yield 5.95%.</p>
<p>Mortgage-, Asset-Backed Securities</p>
<p>Mortgage securities ended unchanged to slightly lower,
after once more following Treasurys in a session dominated
again by oil prices and the crisis in the Middle East.</p>
<p>The market's volatility didn't stem a rush of new issuance
in the real estate mortgage investment conduit and
assetbacked sectors.</p>
<p>Three Remic issues totaling $1.3 billion and two
asset-backed deals totaling $660 million were priced this
session.</p>
<p>In the secondary market, Government National Mortgage
Association 9.5% issues were off 1/32 at 98 14/32, Federal
Home Loan Mortgage Corp. 9.5% issues were off 1/32 at 98 5/32
and Federal National Mortgage Association 9.5% issues were
also down 1/32, at 98 22/32.</p>
<p>In the market for new Remics, details were announced for a
$500.25 million Fannie Mae deal through Kidder, Peabody & Co.
that is backed by Fannie Mae 9.5% 30-year securities; a $300
million Fannie Mae issue through Citicorp that uses Fannie
Mae 9% 30-year securities and a $500 million issue of
collateralized mortgage obligation Remics through Salomon
Brothers Inc. that uses Ginnie Mae 9% 30-year securities.</p>
<p>As for the asset-backed sector, two of the many deals that
are expected to be priced in the near-term were priced
yesterday.</p>
<p>There was a $500 million issue of Discover Card securities
backed by credit-card receivables. The securities have a
coupon rate of 8.75% and were priced at 99.765 to yield 8.87%
through Dean Witter Reynolds Inc.</p>
<p>The underlying credit-card receivables were sold by
Discover Receivables Financing Corp., a unit of Sears,
Roebuck & Co., and are being serviced by Greenwood Trust Co.</p>
<p>In the second offering, $160 million of Southeast Bank
securities backed by credit-card receivables have a coupon
rate of 8.60% and were priced at 99 21/32 to yield 8.762%
through Goldman, Sachs & Co.</p>
<p>The seller and servicer of the underlying loans is
Southeast Bank, a unit of Miami-based Southeast Banking Corp.</p>
