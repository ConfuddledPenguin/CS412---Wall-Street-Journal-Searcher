	<div class="article-body"><p>ROBERT D. JOFFEE EARNED BIG FEES and great satisfaction
giving legal advice to Time Inc. on its purchase of Warner
Communications Inc. last year. He found his reward, however,
fighting building permit battles and small-claims contract
disputes for no fee at all.</p>
<p>Mr. Joffee, a 47-year-old partner in the prestigious New
York law firm of Cravath, Swaine & Moore, is also an active
board member of the Jericho Project, a nonprofit organization
dedicated to helping homeless people recovering from alcohol
or drug abuse find shelter and jobs. Started seven years ago
as an outreach program of three Episcopal churches, Jericho
today operates on an $800,000 annual budget, providing job
counseling and subsidized rent for 59 people in a scruffy
Manhattan welfare hotel.</p>
<p>Lawyer Joffee joined the group in 1985, attracted by its
efforts to rehabilitate instead of simply house those with
substance-abuse problems. His firm, like many others,
encourages pro bono, or free, work by members on behalf of
those who can't afford legal services. But the Harvard Law
graduate has gone the extra mile, giving about 20% of his
professional time to Jericho and other causes. His
contribution to Jericho alone could equal about $28,000 a
year in legal fees, based on what partners in firms of
Cravath's stature command from corporate clients.</p>
<p>"Even though Bob's own workday is full, he has time for
us," says Gene Estess, Jericho's executive director and a
former Wall Street options trader. If Mr. Joffee is away,
Jericho staffers simply leave a message on his answering
machine. "We couldn't operate without him and we couldn't
afford to pay for his legal and business advice," says Mr.
Estess.</p>
<p>Even during last year's lengthy high-pressure tangle of
negotiations and court battles -- as Time fought a hostile
bidder and completed the $14 billion acquisition of Warner
Communications -- Mr. Joffee had time for Jericho. However,
he concedes he briefly had to delegate some of the Jericho
load to two associates. "I don't think we let anything fall
between the cracks at Jericho," he says.</p>
<p>Mr. Joffee's major Jericho challenge since late 1988 has
involved plans to convert a five-story former Harlem hotel
into a permanent Jericho residence for 56 people. He handled
a legal dispute with the first architect over payment
schedules and oversaw the yearlong eviction proceedings of a
liquor store from the old structure.</p>
<p>He has also dealt with about six state and city agencies
to complete the facility, with occupancy now scheduled for
October. (Even with the resources, skills and perseverance of
an advocate like Mr. Joffee, the project fell eight months
behind schedule, snarled in red tape that he had to unravel.)</p>
<p>His current legal work for the group is hardly material
for an "L.A. Law" script. For instance, he is working on a
conduct code to spell out how both employees and residents at
the new facility can be lawfully tested, on a regular basis,
for use of drugs and alcohol without violating their privacy.
In addition, he is studying such weighty matters as Jericho's
liability for, say, lost or scorched clothing should Jericho
open a laundromat business on the ground floor of the rebuilt
Harlem structure.</p>
<p>Mr. Joffee is also continuing to search for new Jericho
board members. Over a business lunch, he recently convinced a
fellow corporate lawyer to sign on; at a cocktail party/fund
raiser for Jericho at his apartment he persuaded a successful
psychiatrist, who has an apartment in the same building, to
become a board member.</p>
<p>"Helping those less lucky than myself is very satisfying,"
says Mr. Joffee. "In some way it pays back for the luck I've
had in my life." Students in his high school must have sensed
something: The class of '61 voted him most likely to succeed.</p>
