	<p class="article-leader">CHARLEVOIX, Mich. -- To some entrepreneurs, running a
business in a cherished old resort town like this Lake
Michigan retreat is the ultimate daydream.
   But this summer has been anything but a daydream for Nancy
DeHollander, an owner of a bed-and-breakfast here, who can't
fill her rooms. While weekends have been fully booked,
weekday traffic has been slow. Overall, she says, her
business through July declined 15% from a year earlier.
Unless things improve this month, she says, she will have to
postpone a remodeling project.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Sluggish business in the tourist industry is particularly
hurting small businesses in resort towns such as this, where
virtually all the visitors come for pleasure. Unlike large
hotels in cities and big-resort areas, the small innkeepers
here can't hope for big convention and business-travel volume
in November to make up for vacant rooms in August. Much of
the town's prosperity depends on summer, when the population
is said to at least double from its normal 3,300.</p>
<p>And now, in the wake of the Middle East crisis, increased
anxiety about the economy and rising gasoline prices only add
to the problem.</p>
<p>Forced to make their big money in a few short months, the
resorts here have suffered from this summer's weather. June
was unusually cool and damp here. July temperatures
fluctuated wildly -- and this month began unpromisingly.
"It's too cold for people to get into bikinis," sighs Donald
Ward, owner of a charter-fishing company, as he surveys a
harbor of idle boats.</p>
<p>But weather is only the beginning. As signs of economic
slowdown have grown in recent months, especially in the
Midwest and Northeast, wary consumers have trimmed their
vacation spending. That's making for a "soft" summer in
tourism, says James Cammisa, publisher of Travel Industry
Indicators, a Miami-based newsletter.</p>
<p>Of course, resort prosperity varies from place to place.
But Charlevoix isn't exceptional. Dane Wells, an owner of the
Queen Victoria Inn, a bed-and-breakfast in Cape May, N.J.,
notes that more of his customers are requesting early-morning
check-ins to avoid the cost of staying the prior night. Among
other woes, that creates a morning jam-up for him: He can't
turn over rooms, beach tags and parking permits to new
arrivals when his departing guests haven't checked out.</p>
<p>In South Beach, Ore., Becky Hogan, owner of a gas station
and convenience store, hears more complaints these days about
rising gas prices. She estimates her average sale has dropped
50 cents to $3 this year. In business since 1987, she says
this is shaping up as her most difficult year. "I'm not
getting rich," she says.</p>
<p>For small operators in older resorts like century-old
Charlevoix, penny-pinching merely exacerbates a longer-term
challenge: changing vacation habits. With cheaper air fares,
travelers have more vacation choices than in the past, and
they are traveling farther afield. They don't depend on a
nearby resort as their parents often did. What's more, travel
industry studies show people are taking shorter trips --
perhaps a long weekend rather than a two-week jaunt.</p>
<p>Betsy Ellison, vacationing in Charlevoix for two days,
typifies the new type of traveler. Lounging on the breezy
porch of a bed-and-breakfast, while sipping her morning
coffee, the 43-year-old teacher notes: "These last couple of
years, I've been doing short trips -- four or five days -- to
save for the year when I'll go to England."</p>
<p>The soft economy is intensifying competition among small
Charlevoix businesses. As in other resorts, retail fads have
led to gluts. Right now, the town's five-block downtown strip
is overrun with tiny T-shirt shops -- and locals predict a
shakeout.</p>
<p>Mary Walker, an owner of the Beached Whale T-shirt shop,
says she hasn't raised her prices in two years, but her sales
are still flat this year. She claims that too many low-end
retailers are grabbing for the same piece of pie.</p>
<p>In addition, competition from nearby tourist towns is
heating up. In recent years, numerous hotels have sprouted
along U.S. 31 -- the main thoroughfare connecting Charlevoix
with its rivals. At the 15-room, geranium-decked Archway
Motel, owner Sandy Alward, noting passing vehicles, says many
seem to keep driving right on through this year. She offers
free coffee, Home Box Office on cable television, and a pool.
She cut her prices this year by as much as 13% to a range of
$48 to $80. But she says her occupancy level has fallen to
80% from 90% anyway.</p>
<p>Not all small businesses are suffering this season. Many
that cater to upscale tourists are posting fat increases in
business. Some travel industry experts say affluent tastes
are driving the market these days. And Charlevoix has long
attracted wealthy industrialists from Detroit and Chicago.</p>
<p>The Weathervane restaurant, on U.S. 31, is busy catering
private parties. The Irish Boat Shop is selling many
30-to-40-foot vessels, priced from $20,000 to $50,000. And
Mettlers of Charlevoix, a designer sportswear shop, says
sales through mid-July were running 18% ahead of a year
earlier.</p>
<p>Lou Mettler, the concern's tanned, casually attired owner,
says his well-heeled clientele come from all over the
country. A top General Motors Corp. official, he says
happily, just ordered two suits.</p>
