	<p class="article-leader">Borneo International Furniture Inc., Asia's largest
furniture manufacturer and retailer, said it will open a
retail showroom in New York, marking its entry into the East
Coast market.
   The Korean company, commonly known as BiF Korea, said it
purchased a 55,000-square-foot building near the Empire State
building for $11 million. Two floors of the 11-story building
will open to the public this fall; the rest will open after
the completion of a $3 million renovation. The company also
said it has leased a 182,000-square-foot warehouse and
distribution facility in Bergen County, N.J., where it will
eventually operate a second showroom.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>BiF Korea, which sells contemporary, Italian-style home
and office furnishings, entered the U.S. market in 1981, and
now operates 12 stores in Southern California. Last year, the
company's sales were $169 million, including $32 million in
exports. BiF Korea said it forecasts 1990 sales of $190
million.</p>
