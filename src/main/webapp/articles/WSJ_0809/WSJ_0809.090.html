	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Setting aside its concerns about the turmoil
in the Middle East, the stock market advanced for the first
time this month as investors went looking for bargains.
   But the worries about recession that have intensified
since Iraq invaded Kuwait and oil prices soared continued to
hold sway over the market. Shares of companies expected to
deliver better earnings in any economic climate paced the
market's reversal.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The Dow Jones Industrial Average broke a six-session
losing streak by gaining 24.26, or 0.9%, to 2734.90. The
average had fallen a total of 7.1% during its string of
setbacks, with most of the loss following the invasion.</p>
<p>Among broader measures, Standard & Poor's 500-Stock Index
climbed 3.52 to 338.35, the New York Stock Exchange Composite
Index gained 1.95 to 185.40 and the Dow Jones Equity Market
Index gained 3.48 to 313.56. Advancing issued totaled 1,015,
compared with about 601 decliners.</p>
<p>Although trading remained active, Big Board volume failed
to surpass 200 million shares for the first time since the
invasion. Volume reached 190,400,000 shares, compared with
231,580,000 Tuesday.</p>
<p>Analysts said the U.S. decision to send troops to Saudi
Arabia -- in what President Bush and administration officials
described as purely a defensive role -- eased the market's
fears that the Middle East crisis would worsen.</p>
<p>"Bush gained a lot of respect, and I think he's got a lot
of people rooting for him now," said William M. LeFevre, a
market strategist at Advest Inc., Hartford, Conn. "Investors
are convinced that the problem has been contained."</p>
<p>Share prices rose throughout the morning and peaked at
midday as investors digested the statements from Bush, along
with statements from Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein saying he
would seek "full unity" of Iraq and Kuwait.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the rise in oil prices collapsed after the
Saudis said they would increase their oil production to
offset losses resulting from the international boycott of oil
from Iraq and Kuwait. Crude-oil futures fell sharply in New
York trading, with September contracts on West Texas
Intermediate losing $2.35 a barrel to $25.96.</p>
<p>The Dow Jones Transportation Average rose 26.64 to 991.42,
its first gain since July 26. A rebound in UAL, whose stock
had fallen 38% since the average last recorded a gain,
accounted for most of the latest move.</p>
<p>The plunge in oil prices took its toll on energy stocks.
Exxon fell 1 5/8 to 51 3/4 on trading of two million shares,
Texaco dropped 1 7/8 to 62 3/4 on 1.7 million shares and
Chevron went down 1 3/4 to 76 7/8; those losses depressed the
industrial average by about 10 1/2 points.</p>
<p>In response to the Saudis' promise to boost oil
production, Dean Witter Reynolds recommended that investors
cut their cash levels in half, to 10% from 20%. The firm
boosted its recommended stock and bond allocations by five
percentage points each, to 70% and 20%, respectively.</p>
<p>John D. Connolly, chairman of the firm's investment
committee, said the recommended cash position had been raised
from zero to 20% immediately after the Iraqi invasion. As a
result of the Saudi decision, "The dire outlooks about
recession will have to be rethought," Mr. Connolly said.</p>
<p>Investors snapped up consumer stocks with a track record
of earnings improvement, along with other growth stocks.</p>
<p>Philip Morris added 3/8 to 45 5/8 on three million shares,
Coca-Cola gained 1 5/8 to 44 and Procter & Gamble jumped 2

<p>SmithKline Beecham equity units rose 3 1/2 to 46 7/8,
pacing an across-the-board rally among drug stocks, as 1.3
million issues were traded. The British-based company
reported a 6% increase in second-quarter pretax profit from a
year earlier.</p>
<p>Alza climbed 2 1/2 to 43 1/4 on the American Stock
Exchange. The Food and Drug Administration granted marketing
approval to a treatment for chronic pain which uses Alza's
drug-delivery system to administer a drug produced by a unit
of Johnson & Johnson.</p>

to 47 7/8 and Eli Lilly added 2 5/8 to 78 3/8 on 1.5 million
shares.</p>
<p>UAL jumped 13 1/2 to 114 1/2, breaking a seven-session
losing streak in which the stock plunged a total of 62
points. American Banker reported that the union-led group
seeking to acquire United Air Lines' parent company in a
$4.38 billion buy-out will ask the UAL board for another 30
to 90 days to obtain financing.</p>
<p>Woolworth, which posted a 4.2% increase in second-quarter
earnings, advanced 1 1/2 to 28 7/8. Other retailing issues to
post sharp gains included Wal-Mart Stores, which went up 1
5/8 to 30 1/4 on 2.3 million shares; Toys "R" Us, up 1 1/2 to
28 1/2; Gap Inc., up 2 3/4 to 53 3/4; and U.S. Shoe, up 1 to
15 1/2.</p>
<p>MCA gained 1 1/2 to 47 and CBS climbed 6 3/4 to 176 after
Morgan Stanley cited the two companies as potential takeover
targets for Walt Disney. Analyst Alan Kassan said in a report
to the firm's sales force that he thinks Disney is
considering a major acquisition, according to Dow Jones
Professional Investor Report. Both Disney and MCA declined
comment.</p>
<p>Other media and entertainment stocks also rallied,

emissions.</p>

to 340.03. Volume totaled 15,020,000 shares.</p>
