	<p class="article-leader">War fears? Increased chances of recession?
   These are the days that make Wall Street's short sellers
smile.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Short sellers make money on bad news. They borrow a stock
and immediately sell it, hoping the price will decline.
Eventually, they must buy shares to replace the ones they
borrowed. But if the stock drops enough in the meantime, they
profit.</p>
<p>In the past three weeks, they have profited big -- but
mostly by luck. Iraq's tanks rolled at exactly the right time
for many short sellers, who had been increasing their
positions for other reasons.</p>
<p>In mid-July, the Dow Jones Industrial Average, which had
been surging, ran into resistance as it approached the 3000
mark; it then fell back. Later in the month, government
reports showed increasing evidence of a sagging economy.
These developments caused many short sellers to fatten up
their positions.</p>
<p>So, when Mideast hostilities broke out, they were in a
perfect position to benefit, even though they hadn't
anticipated Iraq's military move any more than other
investors did.</p>
<p>"I don't want people to think I'm looking for a war," says
Kurt Feshbach, one of the three brothers in Palo Alto,
Calif., who make up the nation's largest team of professional
short sellers. "I don't want people to die. However, I
wouldn't mind some fireworks."</p>
<p>Mr. Feshbach says his firm's managed accounts, entirely
devoted to short selling, were up about 29.5% through July.
Since Iraq invaded Kuwait, the accounts have jumped an
additional 11.5 percentage points, bringing the year-to-date
gain to 41%. (By contrast, the DJIA is down about 1% this
year.)</p>
<p>Mr. Feshbach won't name the specific stocks he has shorted
(there are about 200), but says many of them are bank issues.
"We love our shorts in banks," he says. "We have some
high-tech shorts, but not big names. Some biotech. A couple
of insurance stocks {insurers with large real estate
holdings}. And a couple of takeover plays."</p>
<p>Michael Murphy, a San Francisco money manager who runs a
$40 million portfolio, almost all of it on the short side,
says he's shorting full blast. His main accounts are 100%
short, rather than carrying a 20% to 30% cash position as
they normally do. This is "not because of Iraq," he says, but
because of "fundamental problems in the economy." He predicts
the Dow industrials will fall below 2250 by March.</p>
<p>Mr. Murphy's shorts are mainly in defense stocks, casinos,
savings and loans, banks and airlines. In recent days, he has
partially covered (bought back borrowed shares in) some of
his positions in airlines such as AMR Corp. and Delta Air
Lines Inc., and banks such as Bank of Boston Corp.</p>
<p>But Mr. Murphy is keeping a full short position in
Continental Airlines Holdings Inc. and in various casino
stocks. And he has actually increased his short position in
defense stocks.</p>
<p>The bounce up in defense stocks on news of Mideast
hostilities is "just silly," he claims. He thinks Congress
will proceed with major defense spending cuts.</p>
<p>So far this year, Mr. Murphy says his short-selling
accounts are up 22%; they were up about 10% at the end of
June.</p>
<p>James Chanos, whose New York firm Kynikos Associates is
among the nation's largest short sellers, says he is shorting
"companies in the hotel business, a variety of New York large
commercial banks, companies in the airline and airplane
businesses, and companies that sell Nintendo cartridges." An
investor in the firm says that accounts were up 27% through
the end of July, and about 34% through Tuesday.</p>
<p>Mark Howard, co-owner of JRO Associates, a New York
investment partnership, both sells short and buys stocks
conventionally. At the moment, he says, he is about 60% on
the short side.</p>
<p>One of Mr. Howard's biggest positions is in Japanese put
warrants -- securities that rise in value if the Tokyo stock
market falls. "This situation in Iraq . . . is a much bigger
negative for Japan than it is for us," he says. "They are
completely dependent on imported oil, and a decent part of it
came from Iraq."</p>
<p>If the Iraqi invasion hadn't happened, "our markets would
have been going down anyway," Mr. Howard says. "This just
speeded up the process. Recession is sort of becoming obvious
to everybody."</p>
<p>In the last few days, Mr. Howard covered his short
positions in such big stocks as American Telephone &
Telegraph Co., Dow Chemical Co., Compaq Computer Corp. and
Digital Equipment Corp. He still has short positions in
Genetics Institute Inc., L.A. Gear Inc. and Newbridge
Networks Corp., among others.</p>
<p>Neil Dolinsky, a principal with C.C. Dunnavan & Co. in
Minneapolis, runs a short portfolio of about 100 stocks. Last
week, he added to his positions in 28 of them.</p>
<p>Unlike Mr. Murphy, he covered his positions in most
defense stocks, including Lockheed Corp., Raytheon Co.,
General Dynamics Corp., Loral Corp. and Martin Marietta
Corp., when hostilities broke out. However, he held his
positions in McDonnell Douglas Corp. and Northrop Corp.,
citing their debt loads and the possibility that Northrop
might be barred from military contracting.</p>
<p>John Brooks, an analyst with Davis, Mendel & Regenstein
Inc. in Atlanta, does short-selling for his own account and
also advises clients on short-selling. He says that it might
soon be time to short-sell oil stocks, which have skyrocketed
on the Mideast news.</p>
<p>"These oils have just gone nuts on the upside," he says.
Although oil futures were trading yesterday at about $26.50 a
barrel, Mr. Brooks thinks that's just a panic reaction. "My
guess is somewhere between $20 and $21 is a more realistic
level," he says.</p>
<p>Robert Doviak, who runs a Dallas investment partnership,
Doviak Partners, says he is about "75% short" at the moment.
"I think we're going to have a 100-point rally in the Dow the
next week or so," he says. Then he plans to use borrowed
money to "go more than 100% short."</p>
<p>He expects "a series of mini-crashes" in which the Dow
industrials slide 50 to 150 points at a crack. Investors, he
says, have gotten the idea from the 1987 crash and 1989
mini-crash that it's smart to buy when the market is down.
"When everybody figures this is a sure formula to make money,
the formula breaks."</p>
