	<p class="article-leader">TOKYO -- As if Tokyo's sorely battered stock market needed
more to worry about, some analysts are getting scared that
margin calls soon could bring a fresh avalanche of selling.
   That fear was lurking in many securities industry
officials' minds yesterday as the Nikkei average of 225
stocks took its second-steepest fall ever, plunging 1978.38
points, or 6.6%, to 28002.07, narrowly above the
psychologically important 28000-point barrier. The drop, the
most devastating yet in a rout of share prices this year,
brings the indicator to its lowest level in 15 months. The
worst drop on record is the 3836.48-point decline of Oct. 20,
1987, in the midst of the Black Monday crash.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>London trading, meanwhile, was shaken by Tokyo's drop, as
well as renewed domestic concerns. A modest round of
last-minute buying trimmed the sharp losses suffered at the
outset of trading, however.</p>
<p>The market rode a rollercoaster in Tuesday morning
trading. After posting gains of about 584 points during the
first hour, the Nikkei index began to lose ground rapidly. By
late morning, the index was off more than 300 points from
Monday's close. The Nikkei index then turned around again to
cut most of its losses, finishing the morning session at
27924.88, down 77.19 points from Monday's close.</p>
<p>Toshihiko Fujiwara, an analyst at New Japan Securities
Co., attributed Tuesday morning's early rebound to the yen's
slight recovery in morning trading and to bargain-hunting in
the wake of Monday's plunge. The dollar was quoted at 159.03
yen at midmorning, up from 158.95 yen at the New York close.</p>
<p>At the end of Monday's trading in Tokyo, the Nikkei index
was down 28% from its high of 38915.87, reached at the end of
last year. That drop represents a loss of the equivalent of
more than $1 trillion in market capitalization.</p>
<p>Turnover was light yesterday and buyers were scarce. In
part, stockbrokers blamed rising but unsubstantiated concerns
that investment trusts in Japan soon might face big
redemptions from nervous individual investors. Such
redemptions could force the trusts to liquidate their
holdings in the market.</p>
<p>Another worry was a report in the Nihon Keizai Shimbun,
the country's leading economic newspaper, that some life and
casualty insurance companies might start liquidating their
stock holdings to return to cash. Although insurers said they
haven't altered their investment plans, the report caused
some analysts to fear worse declines in Tokyo. Akio Ishida, a
senior manager at YTB Investment Management Co., an affiliate
of Yasuda Trust & Banking Corp., worries the sell-off could
trigger a world-wide stock market downturn.</p>
<p>Aggravating those new concerns, the ever-stronger dollar
sailed easily higher against the yen. For the first time in
three years, the U.S. currency broke the 160-yen level,
before slipping slightly to close Monday in Tokyo at 158.95
yen, up from 158.35 late Friday in New York. Investors are
concerned that Japanese authorities may resort to an
interest-rate increase to stem the yen's continuing decline.
That would hurt stocks by making fixed-interest investments
relatively more attractive and by raising the cost of
borrowing money to invest in the stock market.</p>
<p>Already, the market's severe drop-off is raising concerns
that small investors, who still dominate trading on many days
and have been buying stock in spite of the market's steep
descent, may face difficulties associated with earlier stock
purchases made on credit. Demands by lenders for partial or
full repayment of loans for stock purchases could further
erode confidence and prices on the stock market.</p>
<p>"We will have some more unfortunate affairs, I am afraid,"
admits a senior executive at Daiwa Securities Co. "The margin
situation is not so good."</p>
<p>Indeed, from the stock market's point of view, it has been
getting worse. Recalling that stock prices rebounded after
the October 1987 Black Monday crash, many small investors
here have kept buying stockseven while the market has
plummeted. As a result, the total value of stock held on
margin in Japan totaled 10.06 trillion yen ($63.59 billion)
as of March 23, down fractionally from a record 10.15
trillion yen a week earlier, but up sharply from about 7.8
trillion yen a year ago.</p>
<p>According to analysts who track the amount of stock
outstanding bought on margin, or credit, the total now is
roughly the equivalent of one in every 10 shares that
normally trade on the market. The percentage is so high
because as much as two-thirds of the 469.97 trillion yen in
stock listed on the first section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange
is held through cross-ownership of Japanese companies and
never trades. Even still, as many as one in five shares
outstanding in some stocks is owned on margin.</p>
<p>When an investor buys on margin, he puts down a proportion
of a stock's value -- now 40% -- and borrows the rest,
usually through a securities company. That gives him
leverage; if the stock goes up, he can sell it and reap the
profits on all the stock he controls. The purchase also opens
him to big losses; if a stock goes down, a lender usually
will ask for the borrower to cough up the equivalent of the
value of the decline in all the stock. Thus an investor who
puts up $40 to buy $100 of stock would have to put up again
an amount equal to his entire original investment if the
value of the stock fell to $60.</p>
<p>Because of yesterday's "decline, almost everybody who
bought on credit will be required to put up additional
collateral," predicts Toshihiko Yoshimi, a senior analyst at
Yamaichi Securities Co.</p>
<p>Such margin calls can force small investors to bail out of
stocks. Under Japanese rules, investors have six months to
clear up margin transactions that are outstanding.</p>
<p>Benedicte Ivey, a saleswoman at the securities arm of the
French bank Credit Lyonnais, has compiled a list of public
companies that she describes as "margin horrors" because of
the relatively large amount of their stock held on margin.</p>
<p>Among the companies are such well-known firms as Minebea
Co., a ball-bearing and semiconductor maker, with 7.21% of
its stock as of the start of last week held on margin; Nippon
Mining Co., a metals firm, with 5.73% of its stock held on
margin; Hitachi Zosen Corp., a heavy-equipment maker, with
3.53% on margin; and Pioneer Electronic Corp., a consumer
electronics maker, with 6.25% of its stock held on margin.</p>
<p>The Japanese issues with the largest balance of shares
held on margin were two obscure companies with a close
following of market speculators: about 16.5% of the stock in
Iseki & Co., an agricultural machinery maker, is held on
margin, while more than 22% of the stock in Tsugami Corp., a
machine-tool company, is held on margin.</p>
<p>In London, Wall Street's modest comeback from its opening
lows helped steady London nerves and led several traders to
forecast that today would see U.K. shares on the rise.</p>
<p>The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100 share index fell
26.3 points to 2221.6. The index was down 36.3 points at one
point, and the day's highs came as trading opened, with the
FT-SE 100 off 23.4 points.</p>
<p>The Financial Times 30 share index was off 20.6 points at
1748.1. Volume was 515.2 million shares, up from 453.7
million shares Friday.</p>
<p>Elsewhere in Europe, prices closed lower in Paris,
Frankfurt, Zurich, Brussels, Amsterdam, Stockholm, Madrid and
Milan. South African gold stocks closed sharply lower.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, prices closed lower in Sydney, Hong Kong,
Manila, Wellington, Seoul and Singapore, and were higher in
Taipei.</p>
