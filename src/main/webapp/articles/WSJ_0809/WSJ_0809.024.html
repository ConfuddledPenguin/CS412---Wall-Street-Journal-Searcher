	<p class="article-leader">BILLERICA, Mass. -- Bull HN Information Systems Inc. said
it reached a preliminary agreement to purchase Honeywell
Federal Systems Inc. from Honeywell Inc. Terms of the
agreement weren't disclosed, though Bull HN and Honeywell
Inc. have begun seeking necessary government approvals for
the transaction.
   Honeywell Federal Systems, a 1,600-employee company based
in McLean, Va., provides systems integration, computer
products and technical services to the U.S. government. It
had sales of $274 million in 1989. Honeywell Inc. retained
the federal systems division after placing most of its
computer operations into a joint venture with Groupe Bull of
France in 1987. Last year, Groupe Bull purchased majority
ownership of the joint venture, originally called Honeywell
Bull, and renamed it Bull HN. NEC Corp. of Japan is a
minority investor. Honeywell Federal Systems has been the
exclusive distributor of Bull HN products to the federal
government.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>By agreeing to sell the federal systems division,
Honeywell is shedding the last remains of its computer
manufacturing, sales and service operation, which generated
$1.9 billion in revenue in 1985, or about a quarter of
Honeywell's overall business. It leaves Honeywell, a
Minneapolis-based company with 1989 revenue of $6.1 billion,
as a controls systems company, providing products like
thermostats and industrial-process control systems to homes,
buildings, manufacturers, and the space and aviation
industries.</p>
