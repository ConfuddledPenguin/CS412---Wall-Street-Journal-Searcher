   The Only Drug
   With No Good Uses</h3>

	<p class="article-leader">With reference to your June 25 article "Smoking Curbs Get
a New Lift From EPA Plan," I can only ask why the government
did not begin smoking restrictions back in 1964, when the
first surgeon general's warning on smoking was issued.
   Tobacco is the only drug that has absolutely no good uses,
especially when used as intended. Yet, the tobacco industry
(death merchants) and many smokers continue to fabricate
excuses to allow this travesty to continue, rather than to
work to find ways to solve the multitude of problems created
by tobacco consumption.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>When I hear of the tobacco states creating legislation to
actually promote smoking, rather than to attempt to curb it,
I can only say that the responsible politicians are not
exercising the prime objective of the government: to protect
the people.</p>
<p>A lot of people in this country need to wake up. While we
claim to be fighting a "war on drugs," the tobacco industry
continues to commit homicide at the rate of 400,000 Americans
each year. We must do everything we can to stop them.</p>
