	<p class="article-leader">CHICAGO -- Eli Lilly & Co. was hit by two more lawsuits
charging that its new antidepressant drug Prozac causes
thoughts of suicide and has other destructive side effects.
   The suits are the third and fourth of their kind in recent
weeks. Each seeks unspecified punitive damages against the
drug maker on behalf of patients using Prozac, which has
quickly become the most widely prescribed antidepressant in
the country. A Lilly spokeswoman declined yesterday to
comment on the litigation. The company reiterated, however,
that its data on Prozac, which has been used on more than two
million patients, don't show "a cause-and-effect relationship
between our product and suicidal thoughts or acts."</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>One suit, filed late Tuesday in state court in Marion
County, Ind., seeks unspecified damages on behalf of Janet C.
Sims, a 23-year-old woman from Noblesville, Ind. She claims
Prozac caused her "to suffer grievous, serious and severe
permanent physical and personal injuries, mental and
emotional distress, pain and suffering, adversely affecting
her earning capacity and ability to enjoy life."</p>
<p>Another claim, filed in federal court for the Northern
District of Illinois in Chicago, asserts that a suburban
Chicago man, Ralph Langer, attempted suicide after taking
Prozac in 1988 by intentionally driving his car into a truck.
Mr. Langer, who is seeking $1 million in compensatory damages
and unspecified punitive damages, fractured two vertebrae in
the accident and still suffers from the injuries, according
to the complaint.</p>
<p>In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange, Lilly
common closed at $78.375 a share yesterday, up $2.625.</p>
<p>Last month, Lilly was sued in state court in Suffolk
County, New York, for $150 million in damages by a New York
woman, who charged that Prozac caused her to make attempts at
suicide. Separately, the widows of three victims in a
September 1989 mass shooting by a Prozac user in Louisville,
Ky., also filed suit in state court in Jefferson County, Ky.,
seeking $150 million in punitive damages.</p>
<p>In a recent internal informational document on Prozac, the
Food and Drug Administration described the reports of adverse
effects as "not unexpected . . . Many {of the reports}
involve events that are already described in Prozac's
labeling" and "are of the type that would be expected . . .
in depressed patients," the agency said. Prozac's labeling
warns of the general risk of suicide in depressed patients,
the agency said.</p>
<p>However, the FDA said Lilly recently revised its Prozac
labeling to include specific mention of cases where patients
exhibited "obsessive preoccupation with thoughts of suicide"
after taking Prozac.</p>
