	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Just a few weeks ago, many of Ted Peck's
clients were awash in stocks. Some were even borrowing money
to buy still more shares.
   Now the Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. broker says he
has slashed some clients' stock exposure to 40% and cut back
the leverage. It's no time to bet big on stocks, he tells
many of them.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"You don't bottom fish in shark-infested waters," advises
Mr. Peck. Noting the external forces playing on the stock
market these days, he sighs and says, "This is in the laps of
the gods."</p>
<p>Since the October 1987 stock-market crash, Wall Street has
lectured investors to buy on stock-price drops, and that
strategy has largely paid off. But some brokers and Wall
Street executives say this time is different: There are too
many unpredictable forces -- Middle East tensions, volatile
oil prices and the budget deficit -- to prod investors back
into the market just yet, they say.</p>
<p>With such potential market minefields out there, "It's
kind of hard to ask people to take risks," says Raymond
"Chip" Mason, chairman of brokerage firm Legg Mason Inc.,
Baltimore. "That's why you're not seeing many (brokers)
saying, `Go, go, go.'"</p>
<p>In recent days, several big securities firms have urged
investors to slash exposure to stocks and bonds, including
Merrill Lynch & Co., Morgan Stanley Group Inc., Sears,
Roebuck & Co.'s Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. and Primerica
Corp.'s Smith Barney, Harris Upham & Co.</p>
<p>Dean Witter, in fact, suggested that investors move a
hefty 20% of their investment portfolios into cash, compared
with zero before. Smith Barney pushed its cash recommendation
up to 20% from 15%, reversing a recommendation made just
three weeks earlier.</p>
<p>"We may be in for a period of extreme volatility" in the
market, says Smith Barney portfolio strategist A. Marshall
Acuff Jr.</p>
<p>Many brokers privately say they don't always follow their
firm's advice. But at least in this case, they are simply
preaching the only gospel that small investors are willing to
listen to. Investors are still smarting from the 1987 crash,
the 1989 "minicrash" and the tumultuous declines of last
spring. While investors don't seem to be engaging in panicky
selling -- another lesson from the 1987 crash -- many aren't
willing to believe the market has hit bottom yet, either.</p>
<p>"October 1987 cured a lot of people, frightened them,"
says William Lauder, a 68-year-old retired attorney and
active investor in Amityville, N.Y. "The little fellow . . .
is going to be cautious, and his brokerage house -- if it has
any sense of the small clients -- it's going to reflect that,
too."</p>
<p>Mr. Lauder says he would ignore his broker if the broker
were touting buying opportunities now. "This Mideast thing
has kind of exacerbated the situation to the point where I'm
very cautious," he says, adding, "I think it's going to get
worse on a gradual basis before it gets better."</p>
<p>Not every broker, however, has told clients to cool it.
Stanley Lee, a PaineWebber Inc. broker in New York, says he's
telling investors to buy selectively even though he expects
volatility in the next few months and says prices could fall
further. Investors who buy Philip Morris in the mid-40s, for
instance, might see it fall to $38 a share in a crunch, Mr.
Lee says, "but it's still a good opportunity." Philip Morris
closed yesterday at $45.625 a share, up 37.5 cents, on New
York Stock Exchange composite volume of three million shares.</p>
<p>Some Wall Street executives think they've got the Middle
East situation figured out. It's "analyzable," says Michael
A.M. Keehner, head of the 1,400 brokers in General Electric
Co.'s Kidder, Peabody & Co. unit. "We see this by its nature
as basically being a short-term crisis" that the Bush
administration will take care of, he says. Investors should
"take a look at high-quality growth stocks which do seem to
be available," Mr. Keehner urges.</p>
<p>Still, many brokers are reluctant to push too hard too
fast. Despite exhortations of his branch manager to "go out
there and sell," a Dean Witter broker confides, he has
counseled caution to clients wanting to jump in and buy
stocks.</p>
<p>The broker, who asked to remain anonymous for fear of
reprisal, said "I'll go through the month without the (sales)
numbers I need rather than burn the hell out of people."</p>
<p>Even brokers who emphasize the long term are cautious. "I
haven't called a single client and said, `We've got all this
cash, let's go in and buy,'" says Michael Cohen, a broker for
A.G. Edwards & Sons Inc. in St. Petersburg, Fla. "But I'm
saying buy slowly -- particularly if we see more dips in the
market."</p>
<p>One thing's certain: Any spurt in the market -- such as
yesterday's 24.26-point rise in the Dow Jones Industrial
Average -- makes it easier for brokers to persuade their
clients to jump back in.</p>
<p>For example, at Raymond James Associates Inc. in Sarasota,
Fla., branch manager Arthur O'Connor says he suddenly had
success selling "high-quality growth stocks" to his mostly
older clients, some of whom had left the stock market
completely in the past couple of months. One investor has
just put half his money back into stocks, Mr. O'Connor says,
and he hopes others will put back at least a third.</p>
<p>His pitch? "We've been through these kinds of (oil-related
market plunges) before, in 1973 and 1974, and it worked out
before," Mr. O'Connor says.</p>
<p>But he quickly adds: "I'm not saying it's going to be a
smooth ride by any means back to 3000."</p>
