	<p class="article-leader">SAN JOSE, Calif -- Altera Corp. said it decided to scrap a
proposed offering of 2.5 million common shares because of
unfavorable market conditions.
   Last month, the semiconductor concern filed the offering
with the Securities and Exchange Commission. At the time, its
stock was trading at $13.75 a share. Yesterday, in national
over-the-counter trading, the stock closed at $11.50, up 75
cents. Altera has roughly 20 million shares outstanding.</p>
