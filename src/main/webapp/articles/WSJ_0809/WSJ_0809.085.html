	<p class="article-leader">The Bush administration's efforts to head off the damaging
economic effects of an oil shortage began to show success, as
crude oil prices fell as much as $3 a barrel. But serious
questions remain about where prices will settle.
   While Saudi Arabia and some other oil-exporting nations
are prepared to increase production to offset any shortages
caused by the Persian Gulf crisis, it will be several weeks
before they can get up to full speed. Even then, world oil
production may fall short of pre-crisis levels by as much as
a million barrels a day.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Meanwhile, the administration continues to drag its heels
on a key decision to help make up the oil shortage by pumping
oil out of its strategic reserves. Oil experts say use of the
reserves would go a long way toward keeping oil prices below
$25 a barrel and cushioning the effect on the U.S. economy.</p>
<p>So far, the administration can claim surprising success in
its strategy to head off the damaging effects of high oil
prices. It has apparently won an agreement from Saudi Arabia
to produce an additional two million barrels of oil a day,
and an agreement from Venezuela to produce an additional
500,000 barrels a day. Mexico also announced plans to chip in
an additional 100,000 barrels temporarily, and other
oil-producing nations are expected to bring the total
additional production to about 3.5 million barrels a day.</p>
<p>That's still short, however, of the four million to 4.5
million barrels a day that was being supplied to the world by
Iraq and Kuwait. And in the volatile oil markets, which are
driven by psychology as much as substance, a shortage of
500,000 to a million barrels a day in a
53-million-barrel-a-day business can be critical in driving
prices higher.</p>
<p>As a result, the Bush administration's decision on whether
to use its reserves could hold the key to whether prices
continue to move down, or head up again.</p>
<p>President Bush said the White House would "explore"
whether to use its reserves to help make up the shortfall.
Inside the administration, however, the issue is still
causing deep divisions. The Department of Energy is pushing
for use of the reserves, and would like a presidential
decision by the end of the week. But Budget Director Richard
Darman and White House Chief of Staff John Sununu are
resisting that move, fearing it involves unnecessary
manipulation of the market place.</p>
<p>The U.S. is scheduled to discuss the use of strategic
petroleum reserves with its allies at a meeting in Paris
tomorrow. In an interview last night, James Watkins, the U.S.
energy secretary, said his department could get oil flowing
out of the 590 million-barrel reserve in two weeks and that
it could "quite possibly" draw down enough to meet U.S.
energy needs and to share with countries that don't have
government inventories.</p>
<p>Mr. Watkins also suggested that, although oil prices have
been oscillating, since 1988 they've averaged a nominal $18 a
barrel. Because of this, he said, he would "feel better about
prices anything below $22 and down to $18. Close to $18 to
$20 is the way it should be."</p>
<p>While the White House debated the use of strategic
reserves internally, a few oil producing nations quietly
began to boost output. None of the countries involved,
however, would talk about their actions or what promises they
made the Bush administration.</p>
<p>"This is an extremely sensitive political matter," said an
oil official with one of the Persian Gulf producers.</p>
<p>Saudi petroleum ministry officials reached in Jeddah
declined to comment about either their production levels or
their plans. But people familiar with Saudi developments said
the kingdom is preparing to advance its output by up to the
two million barrels a day the Bush administration had sought.</p>
<p>It is understood that Saudi officials assume that their
maximum sustainable capacity is about 7.5 million barrels a
day, though that hasn't been tested in some time. The kingdom
recently has been producing 5.4 million barrels a day.
Getting to full capacity would take the Saudis a minimum of a
few weeks, people knowledgeable about the country's oil
operation said.</p>
<p>Venezuela also is believed to have begun increasing its
oil production even before it advised the U.S. it could
supply more oil. In all, Venezuela is expected to be able to
raise output some 600,000 barrels a day, although Venezuelan
officials were cautious in their comments. President Carlos
Andres Perez said only that production could be increased
400,000 to 500,000 barrels a day if necessary. But he said
this would have to be part of a "collective agreement" by the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries.</p>
<p>Nigeria also said it is willing to increase oil production
200,000 barrels a day if other OPEC members agreed. "I
believe that it is unfair for Saudi Arabia and Venezuela
alone to take up whatever shortfall has been created by the
tension in the Persian Gulf," Jubril Aminu, Nigeria's oil
minister, said.</p>
<p>Iran said it could supply some 500,000 barrels a day more
to world oil markets. Some oil experts question that, but the
issue remained academic. Gholamreza Aghazadeh, Iran's oil
minister, called for OPEC members to continue to restrict
output to their quotas for the time being.</p>
<p>Similar advice came from the United Arab Emirates, which
formerly was notorious in OPEC for ignoring its quota. But
Japanese buyers, hurt by the boycott of Iraqi and Kuwaiti
crudes, apparently are being told that they can expect more
UAE crude coming their way. It's generally assumed the UAE
will increase output 500,000 barrels a day.</p>
<p>A further 200,000 barrels or so could be produced as
additional oil by other OPEC members. That would provide a
total of around 3.5 million barrels a day.</p>
<p>While this wouldn't be enough production to offset all the
oil cut off from Iraq and Kuwait, it would cushion the impact
on world oil markets. Also, the three OPEC producers of Saudi
Arabia, Venezuela and Iran have huge inventories of oil in
storage or in tankers at sea -- 50 million barrels, by some
estimates -- that could be immediately sold into the market.
"Indeed, the two big components of oil on the water (stored
oil) are Saudi Arabian and Iranian," said Roy Mason,
publisher of Oil Afloat.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, White House foot-dragging on whether to use the
strategic petroleum reserve has begun to draw criticism from
some outside experts. "The trick to get the benefit of the
strategic petroleum reserve is to use it early," says William
Hogan, a professor at the Kennedy School of Government.
"There's a danger we will procrastinate because we aren't
sure what to do."</p>
<p>Members of Congress are pressing as well. The
administration has made "a major strategic mistake" by not
using the reserve sooner, Rep. Thomas McMillen (D.,Md.) said
at a hearing this week. And Rep. Mary Rose Oakar asked:
"Couldn't the strategic petroleum reserve be used somewhat
like the Federal Reserve uses its monetary powers in
financial markets to provide economic stability to petroleum
markets? Why isn't this being done?"</p>
<p>One White House aide argued, however, that movements in
oil prices over the past week weren't enough of a disruption
to justify use of the reserves. "I would define a disruption
in geopolitical terms if the Iraqis invade the Saudi oil
fields," the aide said. "But in current market conditions, I
don't think the price has moved enough."</p>
<p>John Easton, assistant secretary of energy for
international affairs, will discuss the use of oil reserves
with U.S. allies today at a meeting of the International
Energy Agency in Paris. Administration officials have said
the U.S. will use its reserves only if its allies agree to do
the same.</p>
<p>Some analysts say that if the president decides to draw
down, say, a million barrels a day, he could perhaps reduce
oil prices to the low $20-a-barrel range, and consequently
help hold down gasoline and other energy costs.</p>
<p>"The psychology of the market would really calm down if
that's done," says Joseph Stanislaw of Cambridge Energy
Associates, who predicts oil prices could then remain at
around $25 a barrel until the crisis is resolved.</p>
<p>"Prices aren't going to go back to $20," says Antonio
Szabo of Bonner & Moore, a Houston consulting firm. "But they
may be more like $22 to $24, if all these things happen."
Analysts quickly add, however, that oil prices will skyrocket
if the Iraqi military attacks Saudi Arabian production
facilities in the next few days.</p>
<p>Yesterday's declines left oil prices still $10 above the
year's lows. In heavy trading yesterday on the New York
Mercantile Exchange, the futures price of crude oil for
September delivery fell $2.35 a barrel to $25.96. Futures
prices of the North Sea's Brent crude was down as much as
$2.80 a barrel on the London-based International Petroleum
Exchange.</p>
<p>Even so, the volume of crude oil flowing into world
markets is beginning to decline rapidly as the global
sanctions against Iraqi and Kuwaiti oil take their toll.
According to a leading monitor of its output, OPEC production
was down two million barrels a day in the first week of
August from late July's 23 million barrels a day. Another two
million-barrel drop is expected for the second week.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, after waffling through several days of
agonizing consultations among its oil ministers, OPEC itself
backed off from any coordinated response to the reduced
exports. Nor would it endorse any breaking of the July
production agreement that had been designed to shrink oil
supplies rather than increase them.</p>
<p>"Fears expressed regarding possible disruptions in oil
supply in the short term are rather a result of psychological
and speculative factors than of real market fundamentals,"
said Sadek Boussena, Algeria's oil minister and OPEC's
president, after one member pressed for an emergency meeting
on output limits.</p>
<p>But sooner or later, OPEC experts said, the exporters'
organization will have to address the supply issue as a
group. "Otherwise, it will be faced with unilateral actions"
by those member countries that can produce more, said Bahman
Karbassioun, a former OPEC official and Vienna-based
consultant.</p>
