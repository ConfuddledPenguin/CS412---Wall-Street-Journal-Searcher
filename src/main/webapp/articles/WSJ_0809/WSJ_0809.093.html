	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- The U.S. hopes to complete a bilateral
free-trade agreement with Mexico by December 1992, U.S. Trade
Representative Carla Hills said.
   At the White House, President Bush said he would notify
Congress in September of the two governments' intention to
negotiate such an agreement. Under U.S. law, Congress first
must authorize these negotiations, which are likely to get
under way in June 1991.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Both President Bush and Mexican President Carlos Salinas
de Gortari indicated earlier this year that they intended to
negotiate such an agreement to forge tighter economic links
between their two countries.</p>
<p>Ambassador Hills told reporters that the proposed
agreement would cover trade in goods and services,
investments, and protection of intellectual property rights
of companies doing business in both countries. The agreement
won't cover immigration issues.</p>
<p>Mrs. Hills and the Mexican commerce minister, Jaime Serra
Puche, submitted a joint report to their presidents,
recommending that the two countries undertake formal
negotiation of a bilateral free-trade accord.</p>
