	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Investment bankers are telling client
companies to consider buying back their stock now that share
prices have plummeted in the recent market plunge.
   "We are talking to clients and suggesting they invest in
their own equities," says Peter DaPuzzo, co-head of Lehman
Brothers world-wide equities division.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Buy-backs, whose popularity soared after the October 1987
stock market crash, trailed off significantly in recent
months. But now, they may be back.</p>
<p>So far this week, nearly 30 firms have announced buy-backs
although many of those decisions had been made prior to the
most recent market turbulence. Investment bankers say more
are expected as the market stabilizes.</p>
<p>Richard Franyo, head of investment banking at Alex. Brown
& Sons Inc., says he alerted the firm's bankers Monday that
they should be looking for corporate stock buy-backs.</p>
<p>"It's clearly something we should be calling our clients
and talking about," Mr. Franyo says.</p>
<p>Alex. Brown itself yesterday authorized the buy-back of as
many as 500,000 additional shares in a buy-back program that
now totals about 760,000 shares.</p>
<p>Jim Timmins, a partner at Hambrecht & Quist Inc. in the
capital markets department, says that for some time his firm
has been advising mature technology companies to consider
buying back stock. (Most young technology companies consume
any cash on hand through expansion and don't have room to
consider buy-backs or dividends, he notes.) Many of the firms
that had been advised responded by setting prices for their
stocks at which they would consider such action.</p>
<p>"The recent sell-off brings prices into the target ranges
that people had established previously," Mr. Timmins says.</p>
<p>He says his firm has gone back to those firms now that
share prices have dropped, suggesting they take another look.</p>
<p>"Before it was theory, and now it's practice," he says.</p>
<p>However, Lehman Brothers investment banker Michael Madden
notes corporations may be less enthusiastic about buy-backs
this time around than they were after the October 1987 market
crash or the jolt in October 1989.</p>
<p>"A number of events have come about in the last few months
or days that have influenced their thinking so they may not
be as aggressive as in the prior two periods," Mr. Madden
says.</p>
<p>Among the most significant of those events are the sudden
spike in the price of oil and the looming possibility of a
recession soon. Those considerations are likely to make
companies think twice about spending cash now that could
provide a financial cushion later on.</p>
