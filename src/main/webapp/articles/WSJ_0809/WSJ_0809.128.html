	<p class="article-leader">SAN FRANCISCO -- The California Department of Insurance
ordered Safeco Insurance Co. to roll back rates by $41
million and California State Automobile Association by $92
million in a test of the agency's authority under the
Proposition 103 insurance-reform initiative.
   Proposition 103 required the state's property and casualty
insurers to cut rates by 20%. But the state supreme court
subsequently held that any rollbacks couldn't deprive
insurers of a "fair" rate of return. The state insurance
commissioner, Roxani Gillespie, has set that rate at 11.2% in
figuring rollbacks, although the insurance industry is
continuing to challenge that rate in court.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The department set hearings for Sept. 17 on the proposed
rollbacks for Seattle-based Safeco, and CSAA, which has
offices in San Francisco and Los Angeles, and both entities
said they would contest the orders. CSAA is nonprofit
motorists' association.</p>
<p>Proposition 103, in theory, subjects roughly 600 insurers
in the state to rollbacks, but the cuts are expected to be
relatively small because of the state high-court ruling.</p>
