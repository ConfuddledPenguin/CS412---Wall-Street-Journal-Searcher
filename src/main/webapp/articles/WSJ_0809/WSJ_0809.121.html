	<p class="article-leader">PolyGram N.V., the recorded music company 80%-owned by
N.V. Philips of the Netherlands, is expected to report
Tuesday that its first-half net income fell 15% to 25%,
London investment analysts said.
   Several analysts predicted, however, that PolyGram would
still show a rise in net for the full year.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The first half was disappointing partly because of
teething problems with two record labels PolyGram has
acquired in the past 13 months, Island International Ltd. and
A&M Records Inc. Analysts said efforts to blend those labels
into PolyGram's distribution system held up some record
releases and produced exceptional costs.</p>
<p>In addition, the acquisitions increased PolyGram's
interest costs. Analysts also noted that the year-earlier
half was exceptionally strong.</p>
<p>James Golob, an analyst at S.G. Warburg Securities,
estimated that PolyGram's first half net tumbled 25% to 111
million Dutch guilders ($62 million) from 148 million
guilders ($83 million) a year earlier. But he predicted that
full-year net would rise 11% to 370 million guilders.</p>
<p>Analysts at James Capel & Co. forecast a drop of about 15%
for the half and a rise of 13% for the year.</p>
<p>Despite the slow start, Warburg's Mr. Golob said that the
"strategic logic of the two acquisitions is still very much
intact." Long a powerhouse in Europe, PolyGram has said it
aims to use Island and A&M to bolster its presence in the
U.S.</p>
<p>Philips sold 20% of PolyGram late last year in a public
offering totaling about one billion guilders.</p>
