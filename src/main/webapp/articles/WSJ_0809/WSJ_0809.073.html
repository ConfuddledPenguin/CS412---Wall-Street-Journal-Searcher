	<p class="article-leader">LOS ANGELES -- Spelling Entertainment Inc. said it "is no
longer exploring a possible sale of the company."
   Spelling, an entertainment production and distribution
company, put itself on the block 10 months ago, saying it had
retained Merrill Lynch & Co.'s Merrill Lynch Capital Markets
unit and Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. to look into "various
strategic alternatives for enhancing shareholder value,
including the possible sale of the company."</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>At the time, it said several companies had expressed an
interest in Spelling. The company was put on the block just
six months after control of the concern switched to
Cincinnati investor Carl Lindner from producer and founder
Aaron Spelling. At the time of the announcement, some
analysts said they didn't think the company was that
attractive because of little continuing programming.</p>
<p>Spelling executives couldn't be reached for comment about
how much interest had been generated. The company said in a
press release that the interest it had received didn't
reflect management's valuation of the company.</p>
<p>In the third quarter ended April 30, net income fell
nearly 64% to $954,000, or three cents a share, from $2.6
million, or nine cents a share, a year earlier. Revenue
declined 40% to $37.4 million from $62.1 million.</p>
