	<p class="article-leader">Backers of parental-leave laws have new ammunition against
business charges that such legislation is costly and
unworkable.
   The majority of employers surveyed in the first four
states to adopt parental-leave laws -- Oregon, Minnesota,
Wisconsin and Rhode Island -- said "they were experiencing
neither serious increases in costs . . . nor difficulty in
administering and implementing the legislation," according to
the Families and Work Institute, a New York-based nonprofit
consulting and research firm that conducted the survey with
funding from the Ford Foundation.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The survey is believed to be the first comprehensive study
examining specific effects on employers of state parental and
family leave laws. It could influence long-sought federal
legislation, as well as state efforts to establish or expand
leave programs. The study "once and for all puts to bed the
cost argument," contends Kathy Bonk, co-director of the
Communications Consortium, which has been promoting the
federal legislation.</p>
<p>But opponents of leave laws say the survey's results are
flawed and its motivations are political. "If I'm trying to
get {parental leave} enacted into law, what better thing to
say than here's a study that says there's no impact or the
impact's overblown," says John Motley, vice president of
government affairs for the National Federation of Independent
Business, the largest group representing small business.</p>
<p>The push for a national law stalled last month after the
House sustained President Bush's veto of family-leave
legislation. The measure would have given workers at
companies with 50 employees or more up to 12 weeks off
annually in unpaid leave for childbirth, adoption or the
serious illness of a family member. But backers plan to
continue their efforts, and many states are forging ahead
with their own proposals. Currently, 26 states have some form
of job-protected leave. More than 12 additional states have
bills pending, either to establish or expand such programs.</p>
<p>Business groups have vigorously fought such measures on
the ground that employers need flexibility in offering
benefits to workers. They raise concerns over the cost of
finding and training replacement workers and covering health
insurance for employees on leave. They also say the measures
would reduce existing benefits and favor only highly paid
employees who can afford to take unpaid time off.</p>
<p>But "in terms of cost and disruption to employers, it just
hasn't panned out," says Michele Lord, senior research
associate at the Families and Work Institute. The four state
laws examined by the group's survey offer job-protected
unpaid leave and the continuation of health benefits.</p>
<p>Rhode Island's law, enacted in 1987, covers birth,
adoption and the serious illness of a child for up to 13
weeks and applies to companies of 50 or more employees.
Minnesota's law, also enacted in 1987, grants leaves of up to
six weeks for birth or adoption and covers companies with 21
or more employees. Oregon's law, enacted in 1988, grants up
to 12 weeks for birth or adoption for employees in companies
of 25 or more. Wisconsin's more comprehensive law, also
enacted in 1988, offers six weeks of family leave for birth
or adoption, two weeks for the serious illness of a child,
parent or spouse, and two weeks for the employee's own
serious illness. The law covers employers of 50 or more.</p>
<p>The survey, which was begun 1 1/2 years ago, looked at a
representative sample of employers in each state selected
from state labor and employment agencies' data bases.
Questionnaires were developed with help from state business,
labor and child-care advocates.</p>
<p>The institute says the businesses surveyed ranged in size
from under 20 employees to more than 500 and represented an
array of 12 industries in each state.</p>
<p>A majority of employers surveyed in each state said costs
for health benefits, training, unemployment insurance and
administrative duties hadn't increased as a result of the
legislation. Nearly half the employers surveyed in Rhode
Island, Oregon and Minnesota said the legislation was
extremely or moderately easy to implement, and 42% said so in
Wisconsin.</p>
<p>When asked how they replace employees on leave, the top
choice of employers across all four states, or 59.8%, was to
assign the work temporarily to other employees. In addition,
28.8% said they used outside temporary replacements, 3.6%
paid employees overtime, and 3.3% used permanent
replacements.</p>
<p>Many employers said they didn't have the difficulties they
had expected with the law, according to the survey. A big
Oregon company with 538 employees, 70% of them women, said
eight women had taken leave in the year after the law passed
and only one didn't return to her job.</p>
<p>"The statute helped define the company's policy and give
all employees equal treatment, so they know what to expect,"
a company official said. The company's biggest problem was
dealing with administrative details, such as allowing the use
of accrued vacation for leave purposes.</p>
<p>An Oregon bank said it used "rover tellers" during leaves.
About 25% of its employees took the full 12-week leave, and
it called turnover related to parental leave "a minor
addition" to its overall turnover rates. The bank's one
difficulty: A branch manager and an assistant branch manager
took leave at the same time. Overall, a bank official said,
the law was "good for business and worth its weight in gold
with respect to the parent-child relationship."</p>
<p>But Christine Russell, House liaison for the Chamber of
Commerce, says the survey results don't present an accurate
picture because state laws are different from the proposed
federal law. "The bottom line is, it's still a mandate, and
what works in Wisconsin may not work in New Mexico," she
says. Mr. Motley of the independent business federation says
it's too early to draw conclusions about the state programs
surveyed.</p>
<p>In the survey, some employers complained of costs and
hassles in administering the laws. One employer said the
paper work was "overwhelming" and that he had difficulty
trying to understand and implement the law. He griped that
"legislators don't know what employers want in legislation,"
adding that his predominantly male manufacturing work force
would prefer higher salaries and higher contributions to
health-care insurance.</p>
<p>The survey also included parents and found that low-income
parents returned to work from leaves much sooner than other
parents. In Oregon, 42% of parents surveyed said they came
back from leave because they couldn't afford to stay out
longer. The same reason was given by 41.8% of parents
surveyed in Minnesota.</p>
<p>The survey results are preliminary; full details will be
released in the fall.</p>
