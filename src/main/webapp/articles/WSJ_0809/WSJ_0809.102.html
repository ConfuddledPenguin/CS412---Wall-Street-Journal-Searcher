	<p class="article-leader">Keystone Camera Products Corp. said it boosted its
borrowing ability, helping the Clifton, N.J., company to hire
270 additional employees to handle a $3.5 million backlog of
Christmas orders.
   The Congress Financial Corp. unit of CoreStates Financial
Corp., a Philadelphia-based bank holding company, agreed to
allow Keystone to borrow as much as an additional $600,000 on
a short-term basis. The funds, with additional credit and the
proceeds of Keystone's sale of its interest in a lease, will
permit the company to boost its work force to about 800.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The company is moving into production two new motorized
"point and shoot" 35mm cameras, the Easy Shot 500 and 700
models, priced between $30 and $50. The cameras have features
including automatic film wind and rewind, and a lens that
doubles the magnification of pictures.</p>
