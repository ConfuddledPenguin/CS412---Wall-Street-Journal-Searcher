	<p class="article-leader">IRAQ ANNEXED Kuwait and the first U.S. troops landed in
Saudi Arabia.
   Baghdad declared that the emirate it overran a week ago
was "part of Iraq." As American troops, aircraft and ships
converged on the region, Bush said the U.S. military aim is
to defend the Saudis. He expressed hope Kuwait can be freed
through economic pressure on Iraq. As Arabs prepared to meet
today in Cairo to discuss joining a multinational army in
Saudi Arabia, Jordan's King Hussein said he would refuse to
recognize Baghdad's "annexation."</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The Iraqis moved surface-to-surface missiles into Kuwait
that can carry chemical warheads. Bush said the use of such
weapons "would be intolerable." One military flashpoint may
come today, when an Iraqi-owned tanker attempts to take on
Iraqi oil from a Saudi oil terminal in the Red Sea.</p>
<p>The Bush administration said it is reaching out to Syria
and Iran, two U.S. adversaries, for help in pressuring Iraq.
And Baker said "extended discussions" have been held with
Yemen, which has appeared sympathetic to Baghdad.</p>

<p>The Soviet interior minister asked President Gorbachev to

<p>East German lawmakers voted to merge with West Germany in
two months, setting the stage for a showdown in West
Germany's Parliament over when unification should take place.

constitutional changes.</p>

<p>Liberian rebel Prince Johnson freed all 16 foreign
hostages he held in Monrovia, including one American, the

peacekeeping force that would impose a cease-fire in
Liberia's seven-month-old civil war.</p>

<p>Researchers said an anti-cancer drug, hydroxyurea, proved
effective against sickle-cell anemia in a small clinical
trial. If the finding is borne out in larger studies, it
could lead to the first safe and effective treatment of the
disease, which affects 50,000 people, almost all of them
black, in the U.S. each year.</p>

<p>Kidnappers released a 33-year-old Swiss Red Cross worker
who had been held hostage in Lebanon for 10 months, Syrian

of a Western hostage in Lebanon in more than three months.</p>

<p>A South African court sentenced Winnie Mandela's
ex-bodyguard to death for the 1989 murder of a young black

attorney general has said Richardson's trial would help
decide whether to charge Winnie Mandela.</p>

<p>China and Indonesia restored diplomatic relations, putting
an end to 23 years of discord between the two Asian nations.

its closest allies, in 1967, accusing it of backing an
abortive communist coup two years earlier. China denied the
charges.</p>

medications.</p>

<p>Burmese security forces opened fire on a march led by
Buddhist monks in Mandalay, killing at least four people,
