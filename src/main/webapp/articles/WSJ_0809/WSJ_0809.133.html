	<h3>Heard on the Street: Analysts Say Iraq Move to Have Little Impact On U.S. Defense Firms, but Some See Gains</h3>

	<p class="article-leader">LOS ANGELES -- As unseemly as it sounds, arms makers know
that a little war can be good for business.
   After Iraq crossed the border into Kuwait late last week,
some defense stocks climbed 10%, even as the rest of the
market plunged on fears that higher oil prices would
accelerate inflation and, at the same time, prompt a
full-blown recession.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>In the past two days, the run-up has faltered a bit. But
the question remains: Just how much have the bellicose Iraqis
bolstered the fortunes of U.S. military suppliers?</p>
<p>All in all, many securities analysts insist, very little
has changed during the past week to actually reverse the
deterioration of earnings and balance sheets across the
industry. "The rally has been driven by emotions, not
fundamentals," says defense stock analyst Michael Rosen of
Smith Barney, Harris Upham.</p>
<p>"None of these companies are going to recover overnight,"
adds Howard Rubel, aerospace analyst at Cyrus J. Lawrence. He
says that difficult-to-meet Pentagon contracting terms and
the melting of Cold War tensions will continue to take their
toll on most weapons producers and defense stocks, as they
have for the past year.</p>
<p>Still, many predict that the situation in the Persian
Gulf, serious enough to trigger the dispatch of American
aircraft and soldiers to Saudi Arabia, will at least somewhat
slow the defense stock slide. And clearly, there are specific
Defense Department programs -- surface ships and fighter
jets, for instance -- that are likely to benefit from the
flex of Saddam Hussein's muscle if Congress decides to soften
plans for tough military spending cuts.</p>
<p>"This is a stark reminder of the volatile world in which
we live and the irrationality of certain national leaders,"
asserts Stanley Pace, the chairman of General Dynamics. "This
fact necessitates that the U.S. remain militarily strong and
able to meet all contingencies."</p>
<p>General Dynamics' lot, some think, has improved because
increases in orders for M-1 tanks and F-16 fighters are a
strong possibility. The company also makes submarines, and
virtually all firms that outfit the Navy may find Kuwait's
loss their gain. Among the biggest surface-ship makers are
Litton Industries and closely held Bath Iron Works. Robert
Costello, former Pentagon acquisition chief, says that one
area potentially spurred by the Iraqi incursion is fast
sealift ships, large vessels that are "swift and highly
flexible."</p>
<p>Missile makers also may find more opportunities. Raytheon
is perhaps the most prominent producer of missiles, including
the Patriot, which the Saudis and Israelis want to add to
their arsenals. Iraq's show of force virtually ensures that
Congress will approve those sales, which could eventually
account for $2 billion or more in revenue. The Iraqi attack
also cements the relatively solid position of
defense-electronics companies such as Loral and E-Systems.</p>
<p>But for every defense dollar that pours into one of these
projects, it likely takes away from another program. Even
after the Iraqi assault, for instance, the Senate proposed
scaling back the Strategic Defense Initiative, the
space-based missile shield known as "Star Wars."</p>
<p>Strategic weapons, such as Northrop's B-2 Stealth bomber,
also shouldn't find much relief in the current climate.
Although some lawmakers argued this past week that Iraq's
actions were sound reason to keep the embattled program
going, the fact remains that the plane has been sold
primarily for its nuclear-bomb-carrying capability. "I'm not
sure that all the talk really changed any votes," says one
congressional aide. In the case of other programs targeted by
budget-cutters, such as Grumman's top-gun F-14 fighter, it
may simply be too late to try to save them.</p>
<p>Of course, which companies ultimately win and lose will
depend a lot on whether Iraq dares to push into Saudi Arabia
and risk a major conflict. The trickiest thing to sort out,
meanwhile, are those companies that may see both pluses and
minuses as a result of the Iraqi onslaught.</p>
<p>Take, for example, McDonnell Douglas. The nation's No. 1
defense contractor can certainly make a better case to
Congress now to keep open its F-15 fighter line; Saudi
Arabia, fearful of what Iraq's next move could be, is among
the countries that want more of the planes. In addition, the
company's C-17 military cargo aircraft is just the kind of
project that is likely to get a lift from the turmoil in the
Middle East.</p>
<p>Yet McDonnell Douglas also has a $1.8 billion contract
with Kuwait to deliver 40 F/A-18 Hornet strike fighters
beginning in 1992. That sale suddenly becomes uncertain.
Moreover, a recession could have dire consequences for
McDonnell Douglas's massive commercial aircraft division.</p>
<p>Boeing is another mixed bag. The company could conceivably
see its faltering military segment helped by the Iraqi
invasion. Along with Textron's Bell subsidiary, Boeing makes
the V-22 tilt-rotor Osprey. The White House wants to kill the
potential $20 billion program, but some analysts think that
lawmakers now will be more open to the aircraft.</p>
<p>But, even more important, Boeing's robust passenger-jet
business could be hurt by an economic slowdown. Although a
rise in oil prices could eventually force airlines to buy
more fuel-efficient planes, Boeing would probably see orders
dropping off and options going unfilled, at least in the near
term.</p>
