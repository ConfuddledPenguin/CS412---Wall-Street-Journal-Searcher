	<p class="article-leader">Suntory Ltd. of Japan, a privately held beverage and food
concern, said first-half pretax profit fell 10% to 5.05
billion yen ($33.6 million) from 5.63 billion yen a year
earlier, citing higher interest and investment costs.
   Net income declined 15% to 2.07 billion yen from 2.42
billion yen.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Sales rose 2.2% to 361.8 billion yen from 354.08 billion
yen, partly because of changes in Japan's tax structure.
Sales of alcoholic beverages, excluding beer, fell 5% to
204.429 billion yen from 215.19 billion yen. But Suntory
noted that the basis for the year-earlier comparison was
distorted by a consumption tax that was introduced in April
1989 and replaced higher taxes on hard liquor and wine. Sales
of beer increased 2.6% to 96.16 billion yen from 93.76
billion yen. Sales of foodstuffs rose 36% to 61.204 billion
yen from 45.127 billion yen.</p>
<p>During the half, Suntory bought Cerebos Pacific Ltd., a
Singapore holding company with interests in the manufacture
and distribution of foodstuffs.</p>
