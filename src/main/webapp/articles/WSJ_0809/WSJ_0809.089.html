	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- President Bush said it's still "absolutely
essential" to get an agreement with Congress to reduce the
federal deficit even in the face of a slowing U.S. economy.
   Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady, meanwhile, said budget
negotiators "ought to pick up the pace" and urged that the
deficit be reduced while the economy is still growing,
however slowly.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>In remarks to the National Press Club, Mr. Brady said he
doesn't think the U.S. is slipping into a recession, but he
reiterated his view that the economy isn't growing as rapidly
as the administration wants.</p>
<p>Because of the deteriorating economy and the Iraqi
invasion of Kuwait, congressional budget negotiators already
are rethinking their original goal of reducing the projected
deficit for fiscal 1991, which starts Oct. 1, by $50 billion.
The talks are to resume after Labor Day.</p>
<p>Mr. Bush, in a news conference called to discuss the
Middle East, declined to criticize congressional Democrats,
but he signaled that he may do so soon. "Stay tuned," he
said. Before the budget talks were suspended for the August
congressional recess, Mr. Bush told top Democrats that he was
abrogating their agreement to avoid partisan criticism. So
far, he hasn't said anything in public.</p>
<p>Mr. Brady, referring to a possible securities-transfer tax
as "one of the 80 possibilities looked at by the
administration and Congress," said that "nobody's proposed
it."</p>
