   Aren't Likely to Fall

	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- The crisis in the Middle East is not likely to
have a significant impact on debt ratings of most utilities,
Standard & Poor's Corp. said.
   Despite climbing oil costs, most utilities will be able to
protect their profits by passing along higher costs to
consumers, S&P said in its CreditWire report. During the oil
price shocks of the 1970s, utility regulators in northeastern
states approved provisions that allow utilities to adjust
their rates to cover fuel increases. And some New England
utilities have added nuclear generating capacity or converted
plants to other fuels, S&P said.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Consolidated Edison Corp. and Long Island Lighting Co.,
both in New York, face significant exposure to soaring oil
costs. Con Ed imports nearly 50 million barrels of oil a
year, while Lilco imports just over 20 million barrels. Under
current regulatory provisions, however, the two utilities
will be allowed to recover 100% of any increased fuel costs
by boosting consumer rates.</p>
<p>But it remains unclear how regulators and political
leaders will react to steep rate increases that are only
partly related to the current oil crisis, S&P said. Some
utilities, including Lilco, Boston Edison Co., New England
Power Co., Central Maine Power Co. and Commonwealth Energy
System, already had requested rate increases for unrelated
reasons.</p>
<p>S&P also predicted that utilities relying heavily on
natural gas may have a harder time recovering costs. That
could hurt utilities such as Louisiana Power & Light Co.,
Mississippi Power & Light Co. and New Orleans Public Service
Inc., units of Entergy Corp., given the tough regulatory
environments and weak economies they operate in.</p>
