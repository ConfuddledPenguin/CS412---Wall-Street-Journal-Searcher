	<p class="article-leader">CLOUDS GATHER in Bush's sky-high popularity.
   A new Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll suggests that he
benefits strongly from foreign policy, where 67% approve of
the job he is doing -- precisely the same figure as his
overall job-approval rating. But he slides on handling of the
economy, where voters approve by only 48% to 41%. As recently
as April, the margin was 59% to 30%.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Republican operatives privately worry about what they call
the "mood gap" -- the difference between Bush's high personal
ratings and growing public concern about the country's
course. In the new poll, 40% think the nation is headed in
the right direction and 37% see it on the wrong track; last
January, the results were 49% to 29%.</p>
<p>"Unlike Reagan, I don't think Bush could survive a really
deep recession," says one top GOP strategist.</p>
<p>CONFLICTING SIGNS on the economy fuel voter uncertainty.</p>
<p>While the Journal/NBC poll found voters holding steady in
their own spending and savings plans, it also found a sharp
jump, to 26% from 13% in May, in people who aren't sure
whether they think there will be a recession in the next
year. And pending economic indicators will do little to
reduce the confusion.</p>
<p>The Commerce Department reports that consumer confidence
is slipping, and next week's industrial production figures
are likely to continue to be weak. But today's retail sales
figures, boosted by a sudden jump in auto buying, will
probably show a rise after two months of steep declines, and
inflation figures due out today and next week will offer
further evidence of a moderating trend.</p>
<p>U.S. HELP FOR MOSCOW moves forward despite Bush's
professed reluctance.</p>
<p>The White House is actively working on steps that would
allow Moscow to raise large sums in the U.S. through big bank
loans and major dollar-denominated bond issues. In addition,
the administration leans toward approving government
guarantees for private financing of specific exports,
especially food. It may also back "humanitarian" shipments of
food and medical aid before next winter.</p>
<p>Such private funding and loan guarantees would let Bush
prop up Gorbachev without the direct government spending that
could spark a political fight. In the Journal/NBC poll, 45%
of voters say the U.S. shouldn't aid the Soviet economy,
while 38% approve of doing so.</p>
<p>U.S. officials are privately pleased with German aid to
Moscow, even though they doubt it'll be used wisely; Bonn's
action helps Gorbachev at no cost to Washington.</p>
<p>MANDELA MAKES a good impression on U.S. voters. He is
viewed positively by a margin of 52% to 19%, and a majority
side with him in opposing the easing of sanctions on South
Africa. But by 54% to 32%, they also still oppose aid to his
African National Congress until it changes its policy of
armed conflict.</p>
<p>A "RIGHT TO DIE" is strongly endorsed in the wake of the
Supreme Court's recent ruling. The Journal/NBC poll shows
that voters by a margin of three to one support allowing a
terminally ill patient to take his or her own life. An even
wider majority favors empowering families of terminally ill
persons in a coma to end life support.</p>
<p>MAGGIE AND MIKHAIL run neck and neck in the race for
Americans' esteem. In the poll, 30% say they most admire
Britain's Thatcher among a list of foreign leaders, while 29%
cite Gorbachev. Thatcher does especially well among women and
Republicans, Gorbachev among men.</p>
<p>WHO PAYS for the S&L bailout? Please not us, say voters in
the poll. Only 6% would favor raising personal income taxes
and only 7% support borrowing the money. Twenty-nine percent
want a tax on all S&L and bank deposits, and 30% would raise
other, unspecified taxes.</p>
<p>VOTERS SCATTER on their priorities, puzzling the
politicians.</p>
<p>The Journal/NBC poll finds that even formerly galvanizing
issues have lost some of their resonance. Last September, 43%
named drugs the nation's No. 1 problem; now only 13% do.
"That demonstrates people's despair," says Democratic
spokesman Mike McCurry. Agrees GOP pollster Linda DiVall:
"Voters just don't believe politicians are going to do
anything about it."</p>
<p>With the consensus on national issues dispersing,
political operatives say the result will likely be a greater
emphasis on local issues, the candidates themselves, and
negative ads. "It means politicians will talk about
themselves -- or go heavily after their opponents'
drawbacks," says DiVall.</p>
<p>GOP House campaign committee official Glen Bolger says
he's stopped asking about national issues in his surveys
because "we got tired of finding nothing out there."</p>
<p>MINOR MEMOS: Washington Mayor Marion Barry, on trial on
drug charges, gains little sympathy. Voters view him
negatively by an overwhelming margin of 61% to 6%; among
blacks, he is viewed unfavorably by 47% to 19%. . . . By a
margin of 49% to 14%, Americans have a negative view of
Donald Trump, and 21% say they would be glad if he went
bankrupt. But 34% would be sorry.</p>
