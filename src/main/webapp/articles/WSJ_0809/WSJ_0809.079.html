	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- The Commerce Department is investigating
charges of alleged "dumping" of advanced electronic displays
by Japanese firms. The inquiry is opposed by some U.S.
computer makers that use such components in their portable
and laptop models.
   The department is acting on a complaint by U.S. display
producers that 12 Japanese firms, including Sharp Corp.,
Matsushita Electric Industrial Co. and Hitachi Ltd. are
selling these displays to U.S. users at far lower prices than
their home-market or production costs.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>If the department verifies these charges and the
International Trade Commission determines that such dumping
is hurting U.S. display producers, the U.S. will be required
to impose anti-dumping duties on these Japanese imports to
offset whatever price advantage they may have over domestic
products.</p>
<p>The Advanced Display Manufacturers of America, the trade
group that filed the complaint, said it conservatively
estimates the value of the Japanese imports at more than $90
million annually. The seven small or medium-sized producers
that make up the ADMA also claim that the Japanese have 90%
of the U.S. market for these displays.</p>
<p>The ADMA petition has drawn sharp opposition from Apple
Computer Inc., Compaq Computer Corp. and Tandy Corp., which
warned the ITC Tuesday that higher duties for Japanese
displays could price their own models out of the market.
Lawyers for International Business Machines Corp. said the
firm is preparing a statement also opposing the ADMA
petition.</p>
<p>The products involved in the petition are thin-panel
displays, using such technologies as active-matrix liquid
crystal displays, electroluminescence and gas plasma. They
are mostly used for laptop computers and aircraft cockpit
displays, but there is potentially a more lucrative market in
high-definition television.</p>
<p>The Japanese companies, seeking to have the petition
dismissed, have challenged the U.S. producers' ability to
adequately supply the American market. "The petitioners do
not have the technology, the production know-how or the plant
capacity that the commercial market requires," Lawrence
Walders, a counsel for the Japanese firms, said in a
statement to the ITC.</p>
<p>The other Japanese suppliers named in the petition are
Fujitsu Ltd.; Hosiden Electronics Co.; Kyocera Corp.;
Matsushita Electronics Corp., a unit of Matsushita Electric
Industrial; NEC Corp.; Optrex Corp.; Seiko Epson Corp. and
Seiko Instruments & Electronics Ltd., both units of Hattori
Seiko Corp.; and Toshiba Corp.</p>
