	<p class="article-leader">The union group trying to acquire United Airlines' parent
UAL Corp. won a 60-day extension of today's deadline to
obtain financing for its proposed $4.38 billion, $201-a-share
buy-out.
   The UAL board also approved a possible restructuring of
the union offer in order to reduce the need for bank debt, as
long as the revised terms provide "commensurate value" in the
opinion of UAL's financial and legal advisers, First Boston
Corp. and Davis Polk & Wardwell.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>But the extension, which was expected, may do little to
improve the unions' chances of completing the acquisition.
Takeover stock traders remain skeptical. Although UAL stock
rose $13.50 a share to $114.50 yesterday in composite trading
on the New York Stock Exchange, it remains far below the
nominal price of the union offer because traders doubt the
proposal will be completed.</p>
<p>UAL's board, in granting the union group's request for
extra time, reserved the right to terminate the April 9
acquisition agreement at any time, and said "UAL will
terminate the merger agreement" if the unions can't obtain
financing by Oct. 9.</p>
<p>Putting the extension on a day-to-day basis -- an
unexpected move by the board -- may hamper the unions'
ability to nail down financing by creating additional
uncertainty, one analyst said last night.</p>
<p>The three UAL unions had asked for a 90-day extension
because "the recent turmoil in world oil markets had slowed
the progress of its discussions with financing sources." But
the group's progress had faltered even before Iraq invaded
Kuwait a week ago.</p>
<p>The UAL board didn't give any indication whether it would
continue to hold off on placing an aircraft order valued at
about $10 billion so that the unions can attempt to obtain
financing from manufacturers of aircraft and engines.</p>
<p>The unions have been trying to use the pending aircraft
order as bait to gain junior financing for the acquisition
from the suppliers. But Stephen Wolf, UAL's chairman, who
would lose his job if the union buy-out is completed, has
attempted to foil that strategy by seeking to place the order
promptly. Last month, the UAL board blocked that effort after
the unions protested.</p>
<p>Currently, the union offer gives each UAL shareholder $155
in cash, $35 in notes, and a security representing proceeds
from the share of United's interest in its computerized
reservation system. The cash part of the offer alone would
require about $3.4 billion. A restructuring that reduced the
cash portion could reduce the unions' need for new bank debt.</p>
<p>One person familiar with the buy-out proposal said that
four to five additional banks have indicated interest in
participating in a loan of about $2.5 billion for the
acquisition, in addition to the core bank group of Bankers
Trust New York Corp., Manufacturers Hanover Corp., and
Security Pacific Corp.</p>
<p>Gerald Greenwald, who would become the airline's chairman
if the unions can complete the buy-out, told the board the
unions had made progress and would have lined up bank
commitments if it hadn't been for the Mideast war, according
to people familiar with details of the meeting.</p>
<p>Yesterday's rebound by the UAL stock price was the first
since July 30, when it began a 62-point decline. That
sell-off began when three other banks withdrew from the
financing; it steepened when soaring oil prices raised the
threat of higher jet fuel costs and a general economic
slowdown that would cut airline profits.</p>
<p>The stock rebound occurred on news that oil prices were
falling for the first time since Iraq invaded Kuwait, and on
speculation that the buy-out group would receive an
extension.</p>
