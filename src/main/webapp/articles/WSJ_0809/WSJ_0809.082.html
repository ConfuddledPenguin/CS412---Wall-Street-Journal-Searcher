	<p class="article-leader">LOS ANGELES -- Pacific Enterprises, stumbling in its
effort to diversify, said it took $275 million in charges on
its drugstore and oil operations, resulting in a $229 million
second-quarter net loss.
   The loss, equivalent to $3.34 a share, compared with net
income of $53 million, or 78 cents a share, in the
year-earlier quarter. Revenue rose 3.8% to $1.60 billion from
$1.55 billion.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Pacific Enterprises stock closed at $39.75, up $1.125,
yesterday in New York Stock Exchange composite trading.</p>
<p>However, analysts said the earnings report included
disquieting elements, including apparently growing problems
for the company's retailing operations. "The indication is
that the problems there are a lot worse than some of us had
anticipated," said Janet Dzwierzynski, an analyst at Duff &
Phelps Inc., Chicago.</p>
<p>Pacific Enterprises disclosed, among other things, that
its head of retailing resigned effective July 31, that it may
close as many as 10% of its 1,070 drug and sporting-goods
stores, and that further major management changes may be in
store.</p>
<p>Based in Los Angeles, Pacific Enterprises is the parent of
Southern California Gas Co., the nation's largest
gas-distribution operation. It acquired Thrifty Corp., a
chain of drug and sporting-goods stores, in 1986 for about
$800 million in stock, a transaction that left many analysts
leary at the time. Pacific Enterprises also has built up its
oil and gas operations over a period of years.</p>
<p>The charges include $175 million in write-downs of Pacific
Enterprises' large oil and natural-gas operations. The
writedowns, which were anticipated by analysts, are required
under accounting rules as a result of low oil and gas prices
prevailing at June 30. The company said it wouldn't have to
have taken the charge at today's elevated prices. However,
once taken, the charges can't be reversed.</p>
<p>In many ways, the write-down of oil and gas assets
"removed a sword that had been hanging over the company's
head," said David N. Fleischer, an analyst at
Prudential-Bache Securities Inc.</p>
<p>Far more surprising was the $100 million in write-downs
for retailing operations. More than half of that amount was
due to anticipated closings of between 5% and 10% of the
company's stores over the next two years, a spokesman said.
The remainder is for write-downs to store inventories.</p>
<p>Pacific Enterprises said that Daniel A. Seigel, 48 years
old, an executive vice president of the parent company, was
named president and chief operating officer of Thrifty
effective immediately. He succeeds Richard G. Eils, 52,
president and chief executive officer of the unit, who
resigned "to pursue other interests."</p>
<p>According to a spokesman, Pacific Enterprises is
conducting a search for a number of new senior executives for
Thrifty. He didn't say how many. The new employees may
include a new chief executive officer, a post that has been
left vacant in the wake of Mr. Eils' resignation.</p>
<p>Setting aside the write-down, Pacific Enterprises retail
operations showed a profit of $2 million, down 82% from $11
million a year earlier. Pacific Enterprises cautioned that
"disappointing retailing earnings are expected to persist
through the remainder of the year."</p>
<p>Excluding its $175 million charge, the company's oil and
gas operations had profit of $16 million, a 20% decline from
$20 million a year earlier. The latest period's profit
includes the benefit of reduced depletion expense from the
write-down, a benefit that analysts said will boost reported
profit in future periods. Cash flow, however, fell in the
latest quarter to $43 million from $53 million a year
earlier.</p>
<p>The only operation to show a higher profit was the
utility, which earnings rose 7.4% to $58 million in the
latest quarter from $54 million a year earlier.</p>
<p>In the first half, the net loss totaled $161 million, or
$2.44 a share, compared with net income of $120 million, or
$1.80 a share, a year earlier. Revenue increased 2.9% to
$3.51 billion from $3.41 billion.</p>
<p>The latest results underscored the continuing questions
about Pacific Enterprises, analysts said, as to whether --
and when -- the company can make its diversification efforts
pay off.</p>
<p>Prudential-Bache's Mr. Fleischer sees at least one hopeful
sign. Pacific Enterprises has halted the series of retail and
oil acquisitions that added to its woes. "It seems that
they're going to stop digging a deeper hole and deal with the
hole they're in," he said.</p>
