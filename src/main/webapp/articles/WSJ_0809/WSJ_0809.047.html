	<p class="article-leader">SAN FRANCISCO -- The National Park Service, in a
concession to longstanding environmental concerns, said it
would move the operations of 20 agency buildings from
Yosemite National Park to El Portal, a town outside the
park's southwest border.
   Although the agency didn't indicate when the move would
occur, the decision was praised by the Wilderness Society as
an important step in relieving the national park of
increasing congestion and pollution. A year ago, the park
service said the move, which was conceived in a 1980 general
management plan, may be unrealistic.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Park officials said plans call for razing most of the
smaller buildings inside the park and incorporating them into
a central maintenance facility in El Portal. Officials had
previously made plans to move housing for agency employees
outside the park.</p>
<p>Wilderness Society officials said the move was "an
important step in the right direction," but noted that
several facilities, including the park's main administrative
offices, would still remain in the park.</p>
