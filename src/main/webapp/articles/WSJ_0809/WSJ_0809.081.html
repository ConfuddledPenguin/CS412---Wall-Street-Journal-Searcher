	<p class="article-leader">DETROIT -- A strike over local grievances at a General
Motors Corp. parts-making plant in Flint, Mich., could force
shutdowns at as many as eight GM car and truck assembly
plants within two days, the company said.
   The almost immediate impact of this local walkout on GM's
operations demonstrates how vulnerable the Big Three auto
makers will be should contract talks with the United Auto
Workers union fail to produce a new national contract by the
Sept. 14 strike deadline.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The Flint parts plant is a "key" operation for GM because
it supplies gas tanks and certain other critical components
to a majority of GM's North American assembly plants,
including those that build some of the company's most
profitable luxury car lines, a GM spokesman said. It's not
clear yet how deeply the strike will cut into GM's
production, he said.</p>
<p>But GM President Lloyd E. Reuss, at an industry conference
in Traverse City, Mich., expressed concern that GM could lose
momentum in the market because the company has relatively
lean inventories of new cars. "The marketplace doesn't wait
any more," Mr. Reuss said.</p>
<p>Union officials said the walkout yesterday morning at an
AC Rochester division plant in Flint was a reaction by
members of United Auto Workers union local 659 to
"longstanding local grievances" over work practices, health
and safety issues, and subcontracting of work outside the
plant.</p>
<p>But GM's plan to shut a portion of the factory by 1992 and
lay off about 600 of the 2,800 union workers there is "a big
emotional issue" behind the walkout, one UAW official said.
Union leaders were quick to draw the parallel between the
Flint situation and the broader grievances about GM plant
closings and layoffs that are a focus of the national talks.</p>
<p>"The company's uncooperative stance (at AC Rochester) does
reveal the very insensitivity and lack of respect for its
work force that we have said must be addressed throughout the
corporation," said Stephen P. Yokich, UAW vice president.</p>
<p>In effect, the AC Rochester strike is a warning to all the
Big Three U.S. auto makers that the UAW won't have to expend
its resources on a mass walkout to cripple a target auto
maker's operations this autumn.</p>
<p>GM, like Ford Motor Co. and Chrysler Corp., no longer
warehouses large inventories of parts to supply assembly
operations. Instead, many parts-making plants build and ship
components to assembly plants on a "just-in-time" basis.</p>
<p>This practice cuts inventory carrying costs. But it also
means that any disruption in the supply lines quickly
translates into lost output. When Canadian truckers blocked
bridges between Ontario and Michigan in May, the cutoff in
the flow of parts forced production cuts at nine Big Three
facilities.</p>
<p>Negotiations to settle the dispute are scheduled to resume
today, UAW and GM officials said.</p>
