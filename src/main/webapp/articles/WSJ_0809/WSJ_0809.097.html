	<p class="article-leader">Actors' Equity has read new meaning into the term the
Great White Way. This week it barred acclaimed English actor
Jonathan Pryce from re-creating on Broadway his role in the
London hit "Miss Saigon." Mr. Pryce is white and his
character is Eurasian. It follows, according to Actors'
Equity, that his appearance would be "an affront to the Asian
community." The producer has canceled the show, which by the
way has parts for 34 minorities, mostly Asians. We hadn't
realized that the people in theater, not to mention
Manhattan's economy, were so flush that they could kill plays
for such novel reasons.
   Black actor Denzel Washington opens off-Broadway next week
in Joseph Papp's production of "Richard III," the humpbacked
English king. Somehow, we doubt that Actors' Equity will
launch a protest against this casting or berate Mr. Papp for
not hiring the handicapped.</p>
