	<p class="article-leader">FRANKFURT -- West German retail sales were up a real, or
price-adjusted, 2.7% in June from a year earlier, and rose
3.8% on a nominal, or unadjusted, basis, the government's
statistics office said.
   The data marked a modest slowing from the rates in May,
when retail sales climbed a real 8.9% and a nominal 10.9%
from a year earlier. May's nominal rise was the first
double-digit increase in that category since March 1988, when
sales climbed 13% in nominal terms and 7% in real terms.</p>
