	<p class="article-leader">We are writing in response to your July 24 article
concerning NASA and the Earth science community's Earth
Observing System (EOS). Plans for the U.S. Global Change
Research Program, as submitted by President Bush to Congress,
include within NASA's Mission to Planet Earth the EOS
program, scheduled for the late 1990s. Smaller Earth Probes
are to be launched earlier in the decade. Together, through
their sensors, data systems and science teams, the programs
are designed to expand our nation's capability to observe and
understand the changes of Earth's system as it responds to
human as well as natural perturbations. Discoveries are being
made rapidly in atmospheric chemistry, ocean and ecosystem
dynamics, and how they interact with and affect our climate.
It is therefore imperative that we develop an integrative
view of our planet and its biosphere.
   NASA Director James Hansen has proposed a pair of small
satellites to help fill a gap in current monitoring of
Earth's climate. The satellites would focus on certain
physical aspects of the climate system and are meant to
complement EOS. Mr. Hansen has stated that they are not meant
to be a substitute for EOS.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Within the Global Change Program, EOS is to be the first
integrated system for observing and understanding complex
interactions among the myriad components of Earth's system.
It will be coordinated with European and Japanese satellites;
simultaneous operation for many of these satellite sensors is
crucial to studying global change. A delay in the program
would greatly reduce our potential to evaluate and ultimately
predict changes in our climate, the quality of our air and
the ability of ecosystems to supply us with food, fiber and
water. The Earth Probes, possibly including the small climate
satellites, are essential for using the data from EOS to
observe, diagnose and predict global change.</p>
<p>There remain many uncertainties in global change
predictions that will be addressed by NASA's Mission to
Planet Earth. The issues of the cloud-climate and the
ocean-climate feedback address responses of atmospheric
heating to changes in atmospheric composition. That is, we
must know how CO2 and other greenhouse gases will change over
time as well as their effect on climate. The rate of change
of CO2 and these trace species in the atmosphere will
determine the degree to which our forests, rangelands and
agriculture will be affected.</p>
<p>Recent work has shown that our understanding of the uptake
of fossil fuel CO2 by the oceans and land vegetation is
inadequate. EOS includes sensors designed to improve this
understanding. Gauging the impact of humans on vegetation,
the oceans and the chemistry of the atmosphere is of extreme
importance in understanding our fate. Understanding the
controls over the rate of change of gases in the atmosphere
and of changes in the rest of the planet (land, oceans) is as
critical as knowing the rate of atmospheric heating in
deciding on policy.</p>
