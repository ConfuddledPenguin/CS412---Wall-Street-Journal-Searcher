	<p class="article-leader">Oil heir Gordon Getty and the Fisher real-estate family
have acquired an additional 1,223,508 shares of Avon Products
Inc., New York, the giant cosmetics and gifts company, for
$45.9 million, or $37.50 per share.
   Mr. Getty and the Fisher family of New York, acting as
Malakand Associates L.P., bought the Avon holdings as part of
an agreement previously reached with L/J Partnership on July
5. L/J Partnership is controlled by Minneapolis investor
Irwin Jacobs and Amway Corp., a direct-selling company in
Ada, Mich. It is unclear whether L/J Partnership continues to
own any Avon shares.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Mr. Getty and the Fisher family, together with Argonaut
Partners 1, are partners of Chartwell Associates L.P., Avon's
largest shareholder. Argonaut, whose general partners include
Richard Rogers, Mary Kay Corp. chairman; and John Rochon,
Mary Kay's vice chairman, declined to exercise its option to
acquire the 1,233,508 shares of Avon from L/J Partnership.</p>
<p>Chartwell now controls 19.8% of Avon's common and
preferred shares, slightly below the 20% level at which
Avon's share rights plan is activated. In composite trading
on the New York Stock Exchange yesterday, Avon's shares
closed at $33.25 up 87.5 cents.</p>
