	<p class="article-leader">The 1974 movie "Chinatown" remains a stunning movie
despite -- or maybe because of -- its bleak soul. Director
Roman Polanski turned writer Robert Towne's intricately
plotted celebration of '30s detective pictures into a Gothic
commentary on the rottenness of humanity. It was Mr.
Polanski's idea to allow the story's incestuous villain to
get away with raping his daughter and then raping the land.
   Jack Nicholson, who played the cynical, honorable
detective J.J. Gittes with such bluff brilliance, would go on
to triumph many times again as an actor. But "Chinatown"
remained the best thing that had happened to producer Robert
Evans, to screenwriter Towne and to the director, Mr.
Polanski, who remains in exile 13 years after he was charged
with statutory rape. For Mr. Evans, in particular, trying to
relive the "Chinatown" experience became an obsession, or so
it has been reported frequently over the years. Now, he and
two of his former colleagues have done it in a sequel to
"Chinatown" called "The Two Jakes."</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Given the enormous freight of ego and nostalgia it
carries, the mere appearance of "The Two Jakes" is a kind of
miracle and perhaps should be regarded as just that: not a
film so much as an archival object, a fascinating
documentation of a particular Hollywood fantasy at a moment
in time.</p>
<p>Otherwise, taken out of context as a movie on its own
without historical reference, "The Two Jakes" is a mess.</p>
<p>This is a shame because, in this era of RoboCop 2, we
could all use another "Chinatown." Besides, "The Two Jakes"
is prettier than most pictures being produced these days, and
more intelligent. Mr. Nicholson as director has relied on
cinematographer Vilmos Zsigmond's astute eye to advantage;
"The Two Jakes" has a consistent and amusing period style.
And even under these difficult circumstances -- playing a
part in a movie that is all conception and the concept is
misguided -- Mr. Nicholson remains an actor you want to
watch. Even when what he's saying doesn't make very much
sense, there's a certain amount of pleasure in just listening
to the way he says it.</p>
<p>According to various press reports, Messrs. Towne and
Nicholson couldn't agree on what the story should be. It's
ended up a weak imitation of the original, trying to tie in a
detective story about adultery with a larger story about
greedy developers ruining the Los Angeles landscape. The
second Jake is Jake Berman (Harvey Keitel), a real-estate
developer and cuckold who kills his wife's lover after he's
hired J.J. Gittes to incriminate the adulterers. As it turns
out, the two Jakes are linked to one another by the events
that unfolded in "Chinatown." Indeed, the plot of "The Two
Jakes," which is set in 1948, a decade and a war after
"Chinatown," relies greatly on regretful references to those
events.</p>
<p>Perhaps recognizing the shaky structure of the new
material, Mr. Nicholson tries to pull the narrative together
with a lengthy voice-over. This only adds to the remote
feeling of the picture. One senses that the action has taken
place almost everywhere but where it should be taking place,
on the screen. Almost every scene seems to be missing
something, like a beginning and an end that logically connect
it to what happened before and what should be happening next.</p>
<p>Not surprisingly, one of the few moments that has an
emotional pull takes place when J.J. Gittes rummages through
the newspaper accounts of the awful thing that happened in
"Chinatown." You can see from his face that he hasn't
forgotten -- and no one else has either.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>Watch out when these words precede the name of a talented
young film maker: "produced, written and directed by." Though
putting a film together requires tremendous single-mindedness
of purpose, this complex process can benefit from the
thoughtful outside voice.</p>
<p>Spike Lee, however, has made a reputation with brash
brilliance, and he has been successful enough to convince
himself and, apparently, his backers that he doesn't need to
hear from anyone else. Yet almost every one of his pictures
has had notes so wildly off-key they become dangerous
distractions. In other words, a little advice wouldn't have
hurt.</p>
<p>"Mo' Better Blues," Mr. Lee's latest film, may be his most
polished and his most flawed work so far. This piece about a
narcissistic horn player has a visual sophistication that
confirms Mr. Lee's position as one of the most exciting film
makers to emerge in recent years. More than almost any
director of his generation (he's in his early 30s), Mr. Lee
understands that the camera, too, can be as important an
actor as any of the human characters.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, in this film his pictures vividly tell a
story that is superficial and lazy. Mr. Lee, the writer,
bothered only with show-business cliches, and only with
sketches at that. The slenderness of characterization and
thought is particularly disappointing from someone whose
films have always had an original vision. Even a jagged
picture like "School Daze" had at its core a fascinating
conceit, the battle between darker- and lighter-skinned
blacks on a college campus.</p>
<p>Mr. Lee's uneven hand with actors seemed much steadier
with last summer's "Do the Right Thing." Here he's managed to
make even an agreeable performer like Denzel Washington seem
dull (except when performing the sly anti-rap, anti-love song
with lyrics by Spike Lee, in the picture's best scene).
However, the music, written once again by Spike's father,
Bill Lee, is terrific.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>VIDEO TIP: Movie cliches can become positively mesmerizing
when they're done with the sincerity manufactured in
Hollywood. There was something just great, for example, about
"Lady Sings the Blues," where Diana Ross did Billie Holliday
as only she could, and perhaps as no one else would want to.</p>
