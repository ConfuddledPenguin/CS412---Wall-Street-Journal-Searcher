	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Assets of money-market mutual funds soared
$6.8 billion in the latest week, as many investors sought
refuge from the fallout of the Middle East crisis.
   Assets of 431 taxable funds surged $5.6 billion to a
record $391 billion at the close of business Tuesday,
according to IBC/Donoghue's Money Fund Report. Investors also
poured $1.2 billion into tax-exempt money funds, which
reached a record $79.9 billion.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Some mutual-fund companies said that much of the
money-fund inflow was from investors switching out of stock
and bond funds. "A lot of people are taking a wait-and-see
attitude, and money funds are a good parking place," said a
spokesman for Boston-based Fidelity Investments.</p>
<p>A spokesman for Vanguard Group in Valley Forge, Pa., said
40% of the "substantial inflows" into its eight money funds
came from exchanges, while the rest was from new sales.</p>
<p>The $5.6 billion jump in the assets of taxable money funds
was greater than the increase in the week following the 1987
stock market crash, when investors poured in $5.4 billion.
But while inflow following the crash was equivalent to a 2.3%
rise in money-fund assets, the latest inflow represented a
smaller 1.4% increase, said Donoghue's editor, Martha
Wittbrodt.</p>
<p>The largest weekly increase in money-fund assets was in
the week ended Jan. 9, when they ballooned by $10 billion.
Fund assets rose $6.7 billion in the week ended July 11,
1989. In both cases, however, the increases were largely
caused by technical factors, Ms. Wittbrodt said.</p>
<p>The inflow in the latest week came despite a further
decline in money-fund yields, the Holliston, Mass.-based
Donoghue's newsletter reported. The average seven-day
compound yield, which assumes reinvestment of dividends,
dropped to 7.78% from 7.84%.</p>
<p>Average maturity of the taxable funds increased to 45 from
44 days. That's within the range of the last few months; the
average maturity has been as short as 29 days and as long as
53 days in recent years. Money funds invest in such things as
shortterm Treasury securities, commercial paper (short-term
corporate IOUs) and bank certificates of deposit.</p>
<p>The average seven-day simple yield of the taxable funds
slipped to 7.50% from 7.56%. The average 30-day simple yield
also eased, to 7.58% from 7.62%, and the average 30-day
compound yield dropped to 7.87% from 7.91%.</p>
<p>Yields on tax-exempt funds were also down. The average
seven-day compound yield of 226 tax-free funds dropped to
5.19% from 5.21%, Donoghue's reported. The latest yield is
equivalent to 7.21% for an investor in the 28% tax bracket
and 7.75% for someone paying 33% in taxes.</p>
