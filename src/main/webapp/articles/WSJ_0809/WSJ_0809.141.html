	<p class="article-leader">Medical researchers said an established anti-cancer drug
proved effective against sickle cell anemia in a small
clinical trial.
   If the results are borne out in larger studies, it could
lead to the first safe and effective treatment of the
disease, which affects 50,000 people, almost all of them
black, in the U.S. each year. The drug, hydroxyurea, has been
used to treat bone marrow disorders, skin cancer and
leukemia.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>In the same trial, a new genetically engineered anemia
drug called erythropoietin, or EPO, yielded no improvement in
sickle cell patients, the researchers said.</p>
<p>"We are very optimistic about this," said H. Franklin
Bunn, director of hematology research at Brigham & Women's
Hospital, Boston, and a professor of medicine at Harvard
Medical School. "Treatment until now has been aimed at
getting patients out of acute pain crisis" and managing
symptoms while they are hospitalized, he said. "There's no
treatment that gets at the root cause of the sickling
process." In addition to relieving symptoms, the treatment
could yield huge cost savings, he said.</p>
<p>The study included just five patients, and Dr. Bunn said
it is premature for the average doctor to administer the
treatment outside of an academic medical center. The study
appears in today's New England Journal of Medicine.</p>
<p>Sickle cell anemia, named for the shape of red blood cells
among sufferers of the illness, is an inherited disease that
inhibits blood circulation, leading to joint pain, blood
clots, long-term anemia and loss of energy. The pain usually
comes in episodes, often with "explosive suddenness," Dr.
Bunn said. Symptoms can last from two to 10 days and often
require hospital treatment.</p>
<p>Hydroxyurea stimulates production of a protein called
fetal hemoglobin, which blocks the sickling of red blood
cells. The protein is prevalent in the blood during fetal
development and up to about six months after birth, Dr. Bunn
said, when the gene responsible for its production switches
off. "But the gene is still there. You can look at
hydroxyurea as a way of reawakening the fetal hemoglobin gene
and getting it to go back to work."</p>
<p>The five patients in the study were initially treated with
EPO, which is currently used to treat anemia in kidney
dialysis patients and which Dr. Bunn said increased fetal
hemoglobin levels in monkeys. Then three patients were given
doses of hydroxyurea. During a subsequent period, the three
patients were given both therapies in combination.</p>
<p>The three patients on hydroxyurea reported markedly fewer
pain episodes, a subjective measure of effectiveness that Dr.
Bunn said was supported by analysis of blood chemistry. "They
are less anemic, their red blood cells survive longer, they
have less jaundice and they have less sickling," he said.</p>
<p>But blood analysis during periods when the patients were
on EPO, with or without hydroxyurea, indicated EPO was
ineffective. "We are disappointed that it didn't work," Dr.
Bunn said, noting that there was no effect, even at very high
doses. That could rule out at least one potential market for
EPO, which is sold by Amgen Inc., Thousand Oaks, Calif.</p>
<p>Hydroxyurea, which is marketed by Bristol-Myers Squibb
Co., New York, costs about $500 a year for the average
patient, Dr. Bunn said, a price that could lead to "enormous
savings" if it keeps patients out of the hospital. An eight
to 10-day hospital stay could cost up to $10,000.</p>
<p>Mark A. Goldberg, also of Brigham & Women's hematology
division, was principal author of the study, which included
research done at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine.</p>
