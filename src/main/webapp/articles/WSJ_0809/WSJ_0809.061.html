	<p class="article-leader">Naples, Fla. -- The Philharmonic Center for the Arts, a
breathtakingly elegant cultural showcase, completes its
200-performance opening season this month with a schedule
that includes Lionel Hampton, "The Wiz," the Santa Fe
Ensemble, and the resident Naples Philharmonic. The tills are
full, bills paid and hopes high.
   The 90,275 square-foot, $19.4 million "Phil," situated on
Pelican Bay a few miles north of Old Naples, contains a
1,221-seat auditorium, a 300-seat "black box" theater, two
double-deck art galleries, a sculpture garden, and some
scrumptious bathrooms. The architect Eugene Aubry (who
designed Houston's Wortham Theater Center) wrapped the whole
thing in a light-hearted arrangement of parapets and spires
and fronted it with a nifty portecochere.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Green (the color of money) predominates inside the
building: green Italian marble, green painted Palladian
columns, green carpet, green plush seats. Befitting a jewel,
the proscenium is framed with a 42-inch curved band covered
in gold leaf.</p>
<p>From the beginning in 1983, when a small hall for the
local orchestra was a baby idea, Myra Janco Daniels has been
the force behind the project. She dreamed, cajoled,
envisioned, planned, explained, insisted, solicited, got the
land, stood her ground, booked performances, budgeted, and
hung in there with the tenacity of a bulldog. Mrs. Daniels
takes credit, along with Mr. Aubry, for the green scheme, but
she is far more interested in the Phil's bottom line, which
is black.</p>
<p>"We're running it like a business," she declares. "I
believe, without sounding sour to my fellow colleagues in
this business and hall, that we need more corporate thinking
in the arts. There are surely people in the corporate world
who love the arts as I do, who can bring to it a dimension,
an orderly business fashion."</p>
<p>This pitch went over big in Naples, often touted as
home-away-from-home for the world's largest concentration of
retired CEOs. Since the 1890s, when a group of wealthy
Kentuckians established it as a fishing resort where jackets
and ties were laughable nonsense, Naples has had a moneyed
reputation. The $32,650 per capita income of Collier County
(skewed downward by pockets of migrant workers and the low
pay scale for hourly workers), the 648 golf holes (highest
per capita number in the nation) and the preponderance of
dress shops and financial services over bookstores and
theaters have not bestowed upon Naples the reputation of a
cultural hotbed.</p>
<p>Over the years, Naples did develop pockets of "culture": a
couple of large visual arts groups, a theater company, a
Community Concert series, a small band, a small orchestra and
spasmodic building plans. Co-op ventures did not fare well,
an artsy trait that Mrs. Daniels does not like: "Art people
need to grow up and know there's a piece of pie for everyone.
Traditionally there's been too much pettiness and jealously.
This happens throughout the country. Groups have their
territories. The training of people in the arts is for
segments; they don't understand the broad scope, that the
arts are a business, and they ARE."</p>
<p>Mrs. Daniels entered the culture/cash fray in Florida with
a love for music and years of advertising experience. In
1965, when she was National Advertising Woman of the Year,
Draper Daniels bought the company she was running and shortly
afterward she married Draper Daniels. When he retired she
moved with him to Florida.</p>
<p>Soon after Mr. Daniels's death in 1983 she went to a
concert of the 12-member Naples-Marco Philharmonic. Learning
of its desperate plight, she offered to help with telephone
solicitation. She collected a little money and got a promise
from a Mrs. Hayes for $25, which she went in person to
collect. What follows is the stuff of Naples legend.</p>
<p>Mrs. Hayes turned out to be Frances Pew Hayes of the Sun
Oil Pews, her check was for $25,000, and Myra Daniels forgot
about retirement.</p>
<p>She has not been without detractors. There are those who
think she's "pushy," or who think her personal pleas
disrupted the financial channel "ad nauseam." A fight brewed
over the site's location (Westinghouse Communities, the
community-development arm of Westinghouse Electric Corp.,
solved that with benevolent self-interest -- a gift of prime
Pelican Bay property). And one individual even ran testy ads
in the Naples newspaper ("Dear Mrs. Daniels, you are ruining
this community. . . .").</p>
<p>But Mrs. Daniels persevered, and has made an extra effort
to include her detractors in the center's activities: "Some
of them lost out because we sold everything before they
decided to join us -- boxes, seats, every doorknob. The only
thing I think we haven't sold are the urinals."</p>
<p>In addition to million-plus gifts from Westinghouse
Communities, Curtiss E. Frank, the State of Florida and Mrs.
Hayes, nearly 800 contributors gave from $1.19 (for one
brick) to $775,000. Early in March, Mrs. Daniels announced
that Mr. Frank's final bequest had paid off all construction
costs. Pausing only for a quick breath, she then announced a
campaign for a $20 million endowment. Once the endowment is
in place, she intends to attempt answers to current
criticisms -- including ticket prices, which are too steep
for non-millionaire winter residents and wage-earning locals.</p>
<p>Ticket sales constituted 68% of the center's earned income
for the initial season. Mrs. Daniels says that is more than
double the sales of other major halls. The Academy of St.
Martin-in-the-Fields, Nureyev and several others sold out
months in advance. But rows of seats remained empty for the
Chamber Music series ("Next year we're going to call it
something different, `Intimate Music' maybe").</p>
<p>The Phil, along with Collier County's enormous growth over
the past decade, has changed the face of Naples. Vestiges of
the old days linger, however. A season ticket holder ($1,695
for 61 performances), elegantly dressed for the opera gala in
a black skirt and muted-print blouse, confided to me that
she'd come directly from a barbecue: "I just whipped off my
windbreaker and put on my pearls in the car."</p>
