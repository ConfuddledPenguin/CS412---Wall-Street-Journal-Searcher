	<p class="article-leader">CHICAGO -- Did North Korea try to buy U.S. corn?
   That's the summer's most intriguing tidbit in the
grain-trading pits here, where brokers use a simple strategy:
buy on rumor, sell on fact.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Many rumors never pan out. But this time the details,
sketchy as they are, are enough to have grain exporters
worrying privately that one of them might have unknowingly
broken the law by helping the hard-line Communist government.</p>
<p>"It is strictly taboo," said an official of one major
grain firm. U.S. firms are banned from doing business with
North Korea by the Trading With the Enemy Act. In recent
years, transgressions have been on the mundane side,
involving travel agents and tour operators arranging trips to
three other countries on the enemies list: Vietnam, Cambodia
and Cuba.</p>
<p>Grain, however, is a political powder keg.</p>
<p>Washington got upset in the 1970s when U.S. grain
merchants quietly sold large amounts of crops to the Soviet
Union. Amid soaring food prices in the U.S., Congress
required grain exporters to disclose their sales to the
government.</p>
<p>"This one might have fallen through the cracks," said an
export expert at the Agriculture Department, which tracks
overseas grain sales.</p>
<p>A spokesman at the Treasury Department, which enforces the
trading ban, said it is aware of the North Korean report but
hasn't any evidence of a misdeed. The department can grant a
license to ship goods but usually it does so only for
humanitarian purposes.</p>
<p>Policing the grain trade is difficult. The origin of a
shipment such as corn can easily be lost as it changes hands.
And attractive deals can pop up in the most unlikely places.
For example, several U.S. grain merchants have received
overtures to buy rice from Vietnam, which has had an usually
large harvest.</p>
<p>Here's the North Korea rumor: Because that country can't
openly buy corn from the U.S., a Singapore dealer is thought
to have acted as the middleman to arrange shipment. While the
corn was en route, however, word about it started to pop up
in the West. The North Korean government, perhaps anxious
about how it might look for it to need corn from the U.S.,
got spooked and scrapped the deal, the story goes.</p>
<p>Traders believe that North Korea eventually got the corn
it needed from China.</p>
