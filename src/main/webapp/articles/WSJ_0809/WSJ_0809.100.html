	<p class="article-leader">Sharper Image Corp., responding to dull sales and
earnings, said it would reduce its work force by 10% as part
of broader cost-cutting to improve its financial performance.
   The San Francisco-based specialty retailer has about 1,100
employees. Besides the layoffs, the company said "every area
of the business is under review" for possible
expense-cutting. It said it had already trimmed travel,
entertainment and supply budgets and had imposed a hiring
freeze.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Sharper Image previously said it expected to report a loss
of 15 cents to 20 cents a share for the second quarter ended
July 31, compared with year-earlier profit of one cent a
share. Yesterday's announcement was made after markets
closed.</p>
