	<div class="article-body"><p>China's nuclear enterprises, which have been losing money
due to declining military orders, are looking for foreign
investment to help increase production of civilian products,
an official report said.</p>
<p>About 40,000 of China's workers in the nuclear industry
are idle, a result of a sharp decrease in the demand for
military orders in the past few years and a two-year
austerity program that tightened credit to halt runaway
inflation, the China Daily reported. Last year, the industry
posted a profit for the first time in three years, due
largely to its civilian products, the report said.</p>
<p>In 1989, civilian goods accounted for 42% of the
industry's production -- six times more than in 1980. They
included rare earth metals, man-made diamonds and medical
equipment as well as such non-nuclear items as smoke alarms
and chemical fertilizers, the report said.</p>
<p>The nuclear industry has set a goal of producing two
billion yuan ($422 million) of civilian goods by 1995 -- a
150% increase over last year, the paper said.</p>
<p>ITALIAN JEWELRY CHAIN SOLD</p>
<p>Kuwayama Kikinzoku Corp., a Japanese jewelry maker, and
Japanese trading company C. Itoh & Co. bought 15% of the
outstanding shares of Valestra 1882 S.p.A. of Italy for $3
million, the Japanese companies said. According to officials,
Kuwayama bought a 10% stake in Valestra, while C. Itoh
acquired 5% of the outstanding shares of Valestra, described
as the top jewelry chain in Europe. Valestra is in Vassano,
Italy, and has sales networks in 30 countries, officials
said.</p>
<p>NO MORE GOOSE STEP
</p>
<p>East German soldiers will no longer march the goose step
because it is out of step with the country's new democratic
ways, East Germany's defense minister announced. The goose
step, widely linked to Germany's militaristic past, no longer
fits the armed forces' image, Defense Minister Rainer
Eppelmann said, according to the ADN news agency. A trademark
of Adolf Hitler's Third Reich, the goose step was dropped by
West Germany after the nation was divided, but East Germany
retained it.</p>
<p>TAIWAN'S CHINA INVESTMENTS</p>
<p>Taiwan investors poured US$240 million into China's Fujian
Province in this year's first six months, double that of the
year-earlier period, according to an official report. Wang
Hao, a senior provincial official dealing with overseas
investment, was quoted in the China Daily as saying
investment had built up momentum over the course of the year,
with the average expenditure rising to $2 million from
$800,000 in 1988. Increasing amounts have been put into
technology projects and infrastructure works instead of the
traditional labor-intensive factories, he added.</p>
<p>LANGUAGE LESSONS</p>
<p>France and Germany are promoting their respective
languages in Eastern Europe. In France, the cabinet said the
promotion of French in the newly democratic region should be
"a major component of foreign policy." The Hachette
Foundation is sending 100,000 French-language books to
Romanian libraries, while Alliance Francaise plans to open
schools to teach French in the Soviet Union, Bulgaria,
Czechoslovakia and Hungary; it already has schools in
Romania, Poland, Hungary and Yugoslavia. In West Germany,
meanwhile, the Goethe Institute plans to open schools to
teach German in Moscow, Prague and Warsaw.</p>
<p>TRINIDAD RECONSTRUCTION</p>
<p>Trinidad and Tobago acting Prime Minister Winston Dookeran
announced a reconstruction program to repair businesses
damaged during the recent coup attempt.</p>
<p>Mr. Dookeran also announced a social-assistance program
and said public buildings, including the fire-gutted police
headquarters in Port-of-Spain, would be repaired soon.</p>
<p>The acting prime minister said that the cabinet at its
next sitting would work out the details of the programs.</p>
<p>Industry and Enterprise Minister Bhoe Tewari has estimated
that property damage in Port-of-Spain is at least $70
million. The official death toll from the failed coup and
subsequent looting is 24.</p>
<p>POSTSCRIPTS . . .</p>
<p>Women's groups in Ireland have accused Madonna of
glorifying violence against women in her hit single "Hanky
Panky." A spokeswoman for the Council for the Status of Women
condemned the record -- which includes the line "I'll settle
for the back of your hand" -- as "highly dangerous." . . .
Brigita Volopichova, a 27-year-old judge who sits at the
district court in Plzen, Czechoslovakia, has been formally
disciplined for bringing the legal profession into disrepute.
Her offense: She entered Czechoslovakia's first "Miss
Topless" contest, a televised event in which she came in
second.</p>
