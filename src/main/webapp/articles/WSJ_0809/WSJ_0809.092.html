	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- The U.S. and Saudi Arabia expect that Arab
soldiers eventually will join the U.S. and British forces
sent to the Saudi kingdom, but that won't be certain until
after a meeting today in Cairo.
   Separately, the Bush administration also disclosed it is
reaching out to Syria and Iran, two longtime Washington
adversaries, to seek their help in pressuring Iraq for its
invasion of Kuwait. And Secretary of State James Baker said
the administration has held "extended discussions" with
Yemen, Saudi Arabia's southern neighbor, which has appeared
sympathetic to Iraq since the invasion. The Yemeni Embassy in
Washington, though, denied intelligence reports that it has
allowed the deployment of Iraqi aircraft to its airfields.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The addition of Arab soldiers to the arriving U.S. and
British forces is deeply important to Saudi Arabia. Unless
such troops are added, the Saudi ruling family will be
vulnerable to charges in the Arab world that it is being
controlled by Western powers in Saudi Arabia's confrontation
with Iraq.</p>
<p>But even if such troops arrive, the Saudi ruling family
has taken a huge longterm risk by turning to the West for
protection. Though U.S. forces may have been essential to
offset any immediate Iraqi threat, their presence also likely
will sow the seeds for long-term agitation by other Arabs,
who will use the deployment to paint the Saudi rulers as
Western puppets.</p>
<p>Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak would like to provide the
Saudis with political cover by sending his own soldiers to
Saudi Arabia. But Mr. Mubarak wants Egypt's own deployment to
be blessed by the rest of the Arab world so that he, too, can
avoid charges that he is operating as a U.S. agent.</p>
<p>So Mr. Mubarak has called an emergency meeting of Arab
leaders in the Egyptian capital where, diplomatic sources
say, he hopes to push through a resolution blessing the
creation of a multinational Arab force. The force would be
charged with acting as a buffer between Saudi Arabia and
Iraqi forces occupying neighboring Kuwait. Saudi leaders hope
that troops from Morocco and perhaps a few other nations will
join the force.</p>
<p>And some Arab diplomats here said that even if the summit
doesn't pass such a resolution, Mr. Mubarak may use the
failure to act as an excuse for sending forces anyway.</p>
<p>President Bush, at a news conference held after he
announced the dispatch of U.S. forces to Saudi Arabia,
sounded confident that Arab troops would follow.</p>
<p>Mr. Bush said the Saudis hadn't told the U.S. for certain
that there would be Arab troops, "but it would not be at all
surprising if there was an Arab component in that force, not
at all." Technically, there probably already are a few other
Arab soldiers in Saudi Arabia from nations in the Gulf
Cooperation Council, a Persian Gulf military alliance the
Saudis belong to, but they would be a small contingent in the
kingdom on routine business.</p>
<p>Egyptian officials assume that Iraq's Hussein will boycott
the meeting, diplomats here said. And they think that Syria,
though it often attacks U.S. intervention in the Middle East,
will go along with a multinational Arab force because it is
an enemy of Iraq. Syria, in fact, originated the idea of
holding a meeting now.</p>
<p>Though worried about the delay in formation of a force of
Egyptian and other soldiers, U.S. officials remained
optimistic that one will fall into place in the next few
days. Senior Pentagon officials say that -- in a visit this
week with Defense Secretary Richard Cheney -- Mr. Mubarak
indicated that once the U.S. troops were in Saudi Arabia he
would move fairly quickly to ship some Egyptian forces into
Saudi Arabia.</p>
<p>"It wasn't a firm pledge to have so many thousand troops
in place by a given day," one official said, but rather a
"general meeting of the minds about the need to have an Arab
force" helping to protect Saudi Arabia.</p>
<p>Mr. Mubarak also agreed that if the military situation
warrants, he will agree to have U.S. planes and troops based
in Egypt. No specific numbers were discussed, but thousands
of troops may be involved if a shooting war breaks out. The
U.S. always has coveted access to an Egyptian military
facility at Ras Banas on the Red Sea, near Saudi Arabia.</p>
<p>Morocco's King Hassan appeared less supportive of the idea
of sending in troops, officials said, although he too
indicated a willingness to participate in some Arab force.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Secretary of State Baker disclosed that the
U.S. is making overtures to Syria, as well as sending feelers
to Iran, as part of its campaign to pressure Iraq. Mr. Baker,
speaking to reporters accompanying him on a trip to Turkey to
consult about the Persian Gulf crisis, said Assistant
Secretary of State John Kelly will be sent to Damascus for
talks with Syrian leaders and then will go to Saudi Arabia.
And he said that Iran has been contacted through third
nations.</p>
<p>The long-term political problems for Saudi Arabia
unleashed by this crisis may be just as hard to deal with as
the short-term military worries. Saudi leaders were left with
a choice of facing Iraqi troops alone or enduring criticism
from other Arabs for turning to the U.S.</p>
<p>U.S. analysts long have believed that the Saudi royal
family is vulnerable to attacks from Shiite Moslems critical
of both its wealth and its ties to the West. Now U.S.
analysts have begun to believe the move could unleash
long-term political attacks on the Saudis. "They've signed
their death warrant," says one knowledgeable U.S. source with
intelligence expertise.</p>
<p>Others think Iraq's invasion of Kuwait has so changed Arab
politics that this is unfounded. "The Arab order as they've
known it and as we've known it has changed dramatically,"
says Judith Kipper, a Middle East analyst at the Brookings
Institution. "Nothing applies any more. All the old rules are
out the window."</p>
<p>A key indicator, some analysts suggest, is whether Mr.
Mubarak will succeed in sending troops alongside U.S. forces
without stirring up the anti-U.S. internal forces he also
fights to control. "The key here is Egypt," says Geoffrey
Kemp, a former National Security Council staff specialist on
the Middle East who now is at the Carnegie Endowment for
International Peace. "If Egypt holds together and Mubarak
shows some spine -- as he has done so far -- and contains his
own radicalism, I think the Saudis will get through it."</p>
<p>In an attempt to ease Saudi and Egyptian political
worries, the Bush administration has emphasized to Arab
leaders that it is seeking only temporary access to bases,
airfields and ports to cope with the current crisis. "We've
tried to reassure them that these are extraordinary steps to
cope with an extraordinary situation," said one official.</p>
