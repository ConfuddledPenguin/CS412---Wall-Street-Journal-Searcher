	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- KPMG Peat Marwick, the consulting and
accounting firm, said Larry D. Horner won't seek re-election
as chairman and chief executive officer of the firm's U.S.
and international practices.
   The 56-year-old executive could have run for an additional
three-year term; Peat Marwick's mandatory retirement age for
the positions is 60. But Mr. Horner, a veteran of 35 years
with KPMG and its predecessors, said that the issues the firm
faces require an executive who will be able to stay on for a
longer tenure.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>KPMG has 1,850 U.S. partners and a total of 6,100 partners
world-wide, and is considered the largest of the Big Six
consulting firms. The firm was formed out of the December
1986 merger of Peat Marwick International and Klynveld Main &
Goerdeler.</p>
<p>Mr. Horner took over the top spots at Peat Marwick in 1984
and analysts say he was the driving force behind the merger.
He took over KPMG's international organization, based in
Amsterdam, in 1988. His terms at KPMG's U.S. and
international practices end Oct. 3 and Dec. 31, respectively.</p>
<p>"He had the foresight to see this global economy we're
growing into; . . . too many CPAs tend not to see the forest
for the trees," says Arthur W. Bowman of Bowman's Accounting
Report in Atlanta. "For the types of clients the Big Six
serve, you need this more-global" operation.</p>
<p>KPMG's U.S. practice posted $1.77 billion in revenue for
the year ended June 30, 1989. World-wide, KPMG posted total
revenue of $4.75 billion for the year ended Sept. 30, 1989,
reflecting revenue from firms that have been merged into KPMG
since Sept. 30.</p>
<p>In a severely competitive climate, KPMG has a strong
client base in most major markets world-wide. Mr. Horner says
one challenge for his successor is to continue to build and
solidify the firm's position. Prior to the merger, Peat
Marwick had 70% of its business in North America and 30%
elsewhere; those percentages at KPMG now are 45% and 55%,
respectively, Mr. Horner estimated.</p>
<p>A major challenge facing Mr. Horner's successor is how to
manage a firm in which the partners number in the thousands.
"How do you coordinate the various interests?" Mr. Horner
asks rhetorically. The solution "will take longer than the
three {more} years I would have had" at KPMG, he says.</p>
<p>Neither Mr. Horner nor Mr. Bowman will speculate on a
possible successor to KPMG's at the U.S. practice.
Nominations for the positions will be finalized Sept. 20, and
the U.S. firm's partners will vote early in October.</p>
<p>KPMG's executive committee has nominated P.J. Butler,
senior partner of the U.K. practice, to succeed Mr. Horner at
the international practice. The council overseeing the
international practice will vote on that recommendation in
September.</p>
<p>Mr. Horner sits on a number of boards of charitable
organizations. He said he hasn't decided what he will do
after leaving KPMG.</p>
