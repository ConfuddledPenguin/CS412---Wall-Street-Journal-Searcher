	<p class="article-leader">BRUSSELS -- Arbed S.A. of Luxembourg and Cockerill Sambre
S.A. of Belgium said they are discussing a 50-50 joint
venture to combine their production and sales of flatsteel
products.
   The share prices of both companies surged about 10% after
the talks were disclosed.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"We are seeking a European dimension comparable to that of
British Steel, Usinor-Sacilor and Thyssen," a spokesman for
Cockerill Sambre said. The two companies said bigger scale is
necessary to "assure the future of these activities in terms
of applied research, new technologies and investments."</p>
<p>The joint venture would have annual sales of around 130
billion Belgian francs ($3.96 billion), about half from each
company. Both companies derive around a third of their sales
from flat-steel products. The two said they would retain
their separate identities and pursue their other activities
independently.</p>
<p>Within three months, the two companies aim to reach a
preliminary conclusion on whether to pursue the proposed
joint venure.</p>
<p>Cockerill Sambre is about 85%-owned by Belgium's Walloon
regional government. The Luxembourg government owns about 31%
of the voting rights in Arbed, and Societe Generale de
Belgique S.A. owns 25.5%.</p>
