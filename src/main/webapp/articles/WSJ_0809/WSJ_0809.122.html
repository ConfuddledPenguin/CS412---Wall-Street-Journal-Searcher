	<p class="article-leader">HOUSTON -- John Peters's work gives new meaning to the
phrase "commercial art."
   He doesn't photograph tractors or design corporate logos.
The artist, whose portfolio includes Warholesque acrylic
tributes to pop stars, sells advertising space on his
canvases.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"There aren't enough {art buyers} in Houston to support me
in the horrible style I'm accustomed to," the 32-year-old
says, deadpan. So, for a fee, this tall Texan lets
advertisers hawk discos, hair salons, clothing stores and the
like to gallery goers. As many as a dozen ads, presented in
footsquare boxes along both sides and the bottom edge, adorn
his creations. They are silk-screened -- the
"quintessentially careerist art form," he sniffs.</p>
<p>For critics, who might argue that the ads obscure his art,
Mr. Peters has this ready reply: "My art is already obscure."</p>
<p>Mr. Peters got his inspiration from a Houston art show
last December called "Primal Screen." Ads sold by Mr. Peters
and the other exhibiting artists paid for the cost of
materials for 18 canvases. "Primal Screen" promoters called
it a celebration of "the notion that nothing could be more
valid than art with no integrity whatsoever." Press kits for
the event included a so-called review proclaiming the art-ads
merger a "touchingly blatant tryst of culture and sponsor."</p>
<p>Next month, Mr. Peters plans a solo exhibition with ads
nestled around his art, which is heavy on stylized images of
such "celebrity idols" as comedian/actor Eddie Murphy and
singer/actress Madonna. This time, the artist has hired a
salesperson to sell ads on commission for as much as $1,000 a
pop. Several advertisers, including a nightclub, a clothing
boutique, an art gallery and Houston's Menil museum, seem
happy to pay Mr. Peters's price.</p>
<p>John Hilliard, a Houston art collector, has purchased
several of Mr. Peters's canvases. At first, he concedes, he
thought Mr. Peters's works were a joke. But now that he owns
seven Peters paintings, the young collector considers them
"cutting edge."</p>
<p>For advertisers who really believe in the medium, one
Peters work bought by Mr. Hilliard must have been especially
tempting. Unfortunately for them, Mr. Peters sold no ad space
on it.</p>
<p>In huge, black letters, that canvas reads simply, "Your ad
here."</p>
