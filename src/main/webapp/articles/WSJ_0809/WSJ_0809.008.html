	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Chemical Banking Corp. created a six-member
"office of the chairman" to run the bank-holding company and
its principal bank subsidiaries.
   Walter V. Shipley, the 54-year-old chairman and chief
executive officer of Chemical Banking, said that he, Vice
Chairman Robert J. Callander and four other executives will
constitute the new office, which replaces a 15-man management
committee.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Mr. Callander, 59, was named president of the holding
company. The four other executives are Edward A. O'Neal Jr.,
46; William H. Turner, 50; William B. Harrison, 47; and Marc
J. Shapiro, 43. Messrs. O'Neal, Turner and Harrison were
named vice chairmen of the Chemical Bank subsidiary. Mr.
Shapiro continues as president and chief executive officer of
Texas Commerce Bancshares. The four positions are equal in
stature, Mr. Shipley said.</p>
<p>Mr. Shipley said Chemical has been telling analysts and
investors for the past year that they should view the company
as four basic businesses -- an institutional bank, a
technology-based transaction business and two regional banks,
one in New York and the other in Texas. "We have now
positioned those four businesses at the top level of the
organization," he said.</p>
<p>In the new structure Mr. Harrison will be responsible for
world-wide institutional banking activities, Mr. O'Neal will
run the transactions business, Mr. Turner will be responsible
for regional banking in New York and Mr. Shapiro will
continue to run the Texas bank.</p>
<p>The naming of three vice chairmen is somewhat reminiscent
of an earlier structure in which Chemical had three
presidents. In 1983 the company named Mr. Callander, Robert
Lipp and Thomas Johnson, presidents. But Mr. Lipp left
Chemical in 1986 and the organization returned to a more
traditional structure, with Mr. Callander serving as one of
two vice chairmen and Mr. Johnson as the sole president. Mr.
Johnson left Chemical last December. The other vice chairman,
Richard S. Simmons, 62, plans to retire Oct. 15.</p>
<p>Mr. Shipley said the reorganization of Chemical's top
management isn't a prelude to further cost-cutting measures,
noting that Chemical's expenses declined in each of the last
three years. "This corporation is operating at lower expense
base today than it was in 1987," he said.</p>
<p>Chemical laid off about 2,000 employees in 1987 and 1,000
more earlier this year.</p>
