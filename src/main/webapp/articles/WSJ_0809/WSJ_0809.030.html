	<p class="article-leader">LONDON -- A crucial clue to the mystery of how marijuana
produces its "high" was discovered, opening the door to new
medicines that have marijuana's therapeutic effects.
   Scientists at the U.S. National Institutes of Mental
Health said they found and reproduced a gene that apparently
confers sensitivity to marijuana. The gene is a blueprint for
a natural chemical in the brain that binds with marijuana's
active ingredient -- in essence, a chemical "lock" into which
the marijuana "key" fits to produce some of its effects. The
discovery was reported in today's issue of Nature, a leading
British scientific journal.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Such a chemical mechanism has long been suspected and
studied by scientists, but the cloning of a gene for it
represents an important medical advance, said Solomon Snyder,
a neural researcher at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore.
With the gene as a clue, he said, researchers can begin
unraveling the mystery of marijuana's effects. Ultimately, he
said, the research may lead to new medicines.</p>
<p>"Marijuana research, in principle, could offer terrific
therapeutic drugs," said Mr. Snyder, whose discovery 17 years
ago of a chemical "receptor" for opiates led to new,
artificial pain killers. Marijuana has been known by Western
scientists since at least the 19th century to dull pain,
suppress vomiting and aid sleep. Though rarely allowed in the
U.S., in some European nations marijuana and its derivatives
are sometimes prescribed to treat glaucoma or control nausea
in cancer chemotherapy patients.</p>
<p>The NIMH scientists, led by Lisa A. Matsuda, stumbled onto
the marijuana discovery while following another avenue of
brain-chemistry research. According to their report, they
were studying rat genes for a known family of chemical
"receptors," a class of molecule that receives the chemical
messengers, or neurotransmitters, involved in communication
among brain cells. One of the genes, which they isolated and
reproduced using standard genetic technology, served no
obvious function.</p>
<p>By coincidence, they noticed that the gene -- labeled SKR6
-- showed up most often in those parts of the rat brain most
stimulated by marijuana in lab studies. Subsequent tests
confirmed that the gene, in rodents anyway, was the template
for a natural receptor molecule that binds with marijuana's
psychoactive ingredient, called delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol.
The scientists have yet to find a similar gene in humans,
however.</p>
<p>The receptor gene, the scientists said, may be one of many
involved in marijuana's effects. Each gene may control a
different effect of marijuana -- some blocking pain, others
producing euphoria. By identifying those receptors involved
in the drug's therapeutic effects, a medicine could be
tailored to bind only with them -- and not with the
psychoactive receptors. Some drug companies, including New
York-based Pfizer Inc. and Sterling Drug Inc., have already
been hunting such marijuana substitutes.</p>
