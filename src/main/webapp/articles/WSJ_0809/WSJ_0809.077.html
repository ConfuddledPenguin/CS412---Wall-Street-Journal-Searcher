	<p class="article-leader">As president of Rent-A-PC Inc., I read with great interest
your July 12 article "Making `Rent-a-PC' a Household Name."
To literally thousands of PC renters, Rent-A-PC already is a
household name. To our ever-growing list of customers,
Rent-A-PC is a highly visible, established standard in the
Northeast.
