	<p class="article-leader">LOS ANGELES -- A legal battle over Occidental Petroleum
Corp.'s outlay of about $90 million for a museum to house its
chairman's art collection took a decisive turn yesterday,
when a Delaware court quashed shareholder objections to a
settlement.
   The ruling by Vice Chancellor Maurice Hartnett of the
Delaware Court of Chancery approved an agreement between
Occidental and several shareholder groups setting terms for
the museum and other company contributions to charitable
ventures by Dr. Armand Hammer, Occidental's 92-year-old
chairman and chief executive officer.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Among other things, Vice Chancellor Hartnett held that
Delaware's "business judgment rule" likely embraces even this
large corporate outlay on a charity designated by a company
officer. The business judgment rule holds that a
well-advised, well-informed board is free to make a "business
choice" about what's best for a company in a wide range of
circumstances. The fight over Occidental's contribution,
though far removed from the dramatic takeover challenges
often argued in Delaware's courtrooms, nonetheless cut to the
heart of management and directors' powers and prerogatives.
It laid bare details of the oil company's outlays that proved
closely intertwined with its chairman's acquisitive tastes in
art.</p>
<p>Vice Chancellor Hartnett wrote that "on balance"
shareholder objections to Occidental's financing of the
"Armand Hammer Museum of Art and Cultural Center" would
"likely be dismissed before or after a trial because they all
fall within the ambit of the business judgment rule."</p>
<p>The judge thus concluded that, although "the benefit to be
received by the corporation and its stockholders from the
settlement is meager, it is adequate considering the fact and
circumstances."</p>
<p>Although he approved the settlement, Vice Chancellor
Hartnett cut to $800,000 the $1.4 million in fees that
Occidental had agreed to pay its opponents' lawyers. The
proposed fee drew considerable attention during argument over
the settlement on the grounds that it amounted to an
inducement from Occidental for lawyers to settle the case.</p>
<p>The judge, who had earlier expressed doubts about the
proposed fee, held that "the value of the {settlement's}
benefit is significantly less than plaintiffs' claim."</p>
<p>As previously reported, the settlement limits Occidental's
contributions to charities controlled by Dr. Hammer to 1.33%
of the previous year's total common stock dividend -- a
figure that has grown as Occidental issues more shares. The
pact also requires that Occidental's name as well as Dr.
Hammer's appear on the museum, and that direct construction
costs for the museum be limited to $60 million. Occidental
also has provided an annuity for museum upkeep that boosts
its total outlay.</p>
<p>The debate over the settlement grew out of objections by
Alan R. Kahn, a New York investment adviser, to a pact worked
out last year by other plaintiffs objecting to Occidental's
museum venture. Mr. Kahn yesterday declined to comment on the
court's decision and refused to say whether he will appeal.</p>
<p>In the course of Mr. Kahn's objections to the settlement,
a number of details were discovered about the collection that
has been closely associated with Dr. Hammer. Among the
disclosures: Occidental paid millions of dollars for some of
the most famous pieces of art.</p>
<p>More recently, a niece who is the sole heir of Dr.
Hammer's late wife, Frances Hammer, has filed suit claiming
ownership to a large portion of the collection.</p>
<p>Despite the debates surrounding the museum, which is
nearing completion next to Occidental's corporate
headquarters, Dr. Hammer said yesterday that he was "very
pleased" with the Delaware decision. He said the museum plans
to open Nov. 28 with an exhibit of the works of Russian
artist Kasimir Malevich.</p>
