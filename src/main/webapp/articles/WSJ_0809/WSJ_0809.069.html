	<p class="article-leader">Let us hope your readers got past the eye-catching but
irrelevant headline on Wade Clark Roof's July 20
editorial-page article highlighting some trends in U.S.
religion -- "The Episcopalian Goes the Way of the Dodo." The
headline was not only misleading but, happy to say,
erroneous.
   Those interested in statistics might reflect on the
following: There are about 2.5 million Episcopalians in the
U.S., in 7,500 congregations (a number that has stayed fairly
constant), with 8,200 full-time priests in 100 dioceses. Far
from extinct, wouldn't you say? And, Sunday attendance is up
24.7% since 1974 in Episcopal churches, which have the
highest per capita of giving of all the mainline churches.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>It's also interesting to note that George Gallup, whose
data was cited in the table accompanying the article, said in
an overview of a recent study done by the Gallup Organization
of "The Spiritual Health of the Episcopal Church," that the
church is "substantially orthodox . . . committed to growth .
. . open to change . . . and {wanting more involvement in}
ecology, matters of justice, war and peace."</p>
<p>Headline aside, thanks for running the article and for the
challenge it contains for all of the churches, to quote: "The
religiously non-affiliated have grown to 9% today from 2% in
the early 1950s. . . . Many within this group have dropped
out from the mainline Protestant and Catholic churches. . .
."</p>
<p>This time, as we approach the millennium, is the Decade of
Evangelism for the Anglican Communion, the Roman Catholic
Church, and others as well. We have a saving message to
share. Let us get beyond the numbers game and our concerns
about "how we are doing" as institutions and share the Good
News in word and deed.</p>

<p>Regarding Yale President Ezra Stiles's erroneous
prediction in 1783 that a future America would be "divided
about equally among Congregationalists, Presbyterians and
Episcopalians," Thomas Jefferson's crystal ball was even more
clouded.</p>
<p>Writing to a friend in 1822, Jefferson said, "I rejoice
that in this blessed country of free inquiry and belief,
which has surrendered its creed and conscience to neither
kings nor priests, the genuine doctrine of only one God is
reviving, and I trust that there is not a young man now
living in these United States who will not die as Unitarian."</p>
