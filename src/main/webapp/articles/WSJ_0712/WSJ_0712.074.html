	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- U.S. voters are well aware that President
Bush is breaking his no-tax pledge, but they don't much blame
him for it and are resigned to a tax increase.
   A Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll found that, by a
margin of more than 2-to-1, voters believe the president is
breaking his campaign promise not to raise taxes. At the same
time, though, they said they would prefer higher taxes to
living with the current federal budget deficit, by 49% to
40%. And 88% of those polled think taxes are likely to rise.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>If President Bush does support a tax-increase bill, nearly
two-thirds of the voters said they wouldn't feel any
differently about him. And those who would change their view
are divided about which way they would go -- 18% would think
less of him, 14% would think more of him. Only 21% would
blame Mr. Bush's administration for a tax increase, fewer
than the 26% who would blame congressional Democrats and the
28% who would blame the administration of former President
Reagan.</p>
<p>But when it comes to which taxes to raise, the respondents
were at odds with Mr. Bush and his fellow Republicans and far
more in tune with the Democrats. By overwhelming margins they
favored increasing the income tax rate for upper-income
individuals, raising the corporate tax rate and increasing
"sin" taxes on cigarettes and alcoholic beverages. They
disapproved of raising the gasoline tax, enacting a national
sales tax and increasing income tax rates on all Americans.</p>
<p>The voters leaned toward a proposal being considered in
the Bush administration to assess a new levy on all stock and
bond sales, with 49% favoring the plan and 40% opposed.</p>
<p>The survey was conducted for the Journal and NBC News by
the polling organizations of Peter Hart, a Democrat, and
Robert Teeter, a Republican, between July 6 and 10. The
margin of error for the nationwide survey of 1,555 registered
voters is 2.6 percentage points.</p>
<p>The proposal to raise the top rate is one of the pivotal
issues of the current budget debate. Republicans are
vigorously resisting the change, while Democrats are
insisting on it if the tax on capital gains is reduced, as
Mr. Bush wants.</p>
<p>Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell (D., Maine) told
reporters he would oppose any budget accord that cut capital
gains without at the same time raising the top rate for
individuals. He also insisted that the top rate be increased
to at least 33% from the current 28%.</p>
<p>Voters in the survey sided with Sen. Mitchell. The poll
found that 76% of those surveyed favored increasing the
income tax rate for upper income individuals. The only
tax-increase choice that was better liked, at 78%, was a
proposal to increase taxes on cigarettes and alcoholic
beverages. Also, 70% of the voters said they favored raising
the corporate tax rate.</p>
<p>Last month, President Bush acknowledged that tax increases
are needed to reduce the budget deficit, and, ever since,
Washington decision-makers have turned their attention to the
question of which taxes to raise. Increases in the top
individual tax rate and in excise taxes are high on their
list; selected corporate tax increases also are being
considered, though a boost in the corporate tax rate itself
hasn't been widely discussed.</p>
<p>The Journal/NBC News poll showed that more and more voters
approved of this change in emphasis. For the first time, more
of those polled said President Bush should support a tax
increase than those who said he should stick to his
no-new-tax pledge. Fifty percent of those polled said he
should raise taxes and 46% said he shouldn't. Just eight
months ago, 55% said he shouldn't raise taxes.</p>
<p>A big reason for that swing was the president's ability to
persuade generally anti-tax Republicans to view a tax
increase more favorably. As recently as April, long before
Mr. Bush's June 26 statement about the need for tax
increases, 61% of the Republicans polled said Mr. Bush should
oppose tax increases. In July, when the latest poll was
executed, 57% of the Republicans surveyed said he should back
a tax increase.</p>
<p>Fully 67% of those polled said they believed that the
president was breaking his no-new-tax promise, and 57%
thought that a tax increase was very likely; 31% said it was
somewhat likely. But 65% of those polled said it wouldn't
make any difference in how they feel about him if he agrees
to go along with a budget plan that includes a tax increase.</p>
<p>Overall, Mr. Bush's approval rating with voters fell to
67% from 72% in May and 75% in April. His new standing
matched the approval rating in September and November.</p>
