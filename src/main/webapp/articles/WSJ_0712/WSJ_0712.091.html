	<p class="article-leader">PARIS -- The rise in consumer prices in the Western
industrialized countries slowed in May to the lowest monthly
rate this year, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and
Development said, reporting that the average increase for its
24 member countries was 0.5%, down from 0.7% in both March
and April.
   Consumer price growth in the European Community was 0.4%
in May, down from 0.9% in April, partly reflecting Britain's
recent, so-called poll tax. Seasonal factors caused Japanese
price growth to remain at the high 0.8% level recorded in
April.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>For the 12 months through May, the OECD inflation rate was
unchanged from April at 6%. Excluding Turkey, where consumer
prices rose 3.1% in May, the OECD year-to-year average was
4.6%.</p>
