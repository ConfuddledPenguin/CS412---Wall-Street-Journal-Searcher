	<p class="article-leader">HONG KONG -- Following Japanese Prime Minister Toshiki
Kaifu's announcement that his government will resume lending
to China, analysts calculate it could take several months to
secure funding for individual loan proposals.
   Of the total package of 810 billion yen ($5.36 billion),
about 120 billion yen for 17 projects is likely to be
approved by next March.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Commercial lending may be equally slow to pick up.
Japanese bankers remain cautious about committing new money
to projects in China because of the sharp slowdown in the
Chinese economy and the Beijing government's tight rein on
foreign borrowing, instituted as part of an austerity program
in late 1988.</p>
<p>Since August, larger Japanese banks have been moving back
to China, finding ways to circumvent Tokyo's restrictions to
participate in the few loans available to high-quality
borrowers. Many of the loans have carried Chinese government
guarantees, other special guarantees, or were made to the
Hong Kong subsidiaries of Chinese companies. Japan accounts
for about half of China's more than $40 billion of foreign
debt.</p>
<p>As Tokyo lifts the restrictions, smaller banks may begin
to join some China loans. When combined with the resumption
of official aid, that lending freedom may be positive for
China trade because more foreign exchange will be flowing
through the country, foreign bankers in Hong Kong say.</p>
<p>In the past year, financing has been arranged for several
top-rated Chinese borrowers. Japanese banks have participated
in loans to mainland airlines, China International Trust &
Investment Corp. and infrastructure-related projects. A
consortium of 67 Japanese banks also activated a $2 billion
standby credit approved in 1985. Other relatively big
projects for big-name borrowers may be funded this year, some
with Japanese participation, but owing to Beijing's austerity
program, small and midsize loans will remain few in number.</p>
<p>"There is a common desire among Japanese banks for the
normalization of economic relations with China," said an
official at a large Japanese bank in Tokyo. But he stressed
that banks would take a conservative stance. That view was
underscored Tuesday, when a $30 million loan for China
Resources (Holdings) Co. was signed: No Japanese banks
participated.</p>
<p>Japanese banks' caution, like that of most lenders to
China, stems largely from doubts about the ability of some
projects to produce returns and possible defaults by loan
guarantors.</p>
<p>Poor economic conditions have only added to banks'
worries. China said in a report issued this week that the
country's financial situation is grim and that the government
must continue to tighten finance and credit.</p>
<p>For Japanese banks, caution in China is a change of pace.
Until the killings in Beijing in June last year that
triggered the loan moratorium, they often undercut other
foreign banks on loans to China, according to bankers in Hong
Kong. These bankers say that if the Japanese return to their
old habits, the result would be lower interest rates on China
loans.</p>
<p>"It's not wise for them to rush back in and flood the
market with cheap money," said an economist at a U.S. bank in
Hong Kong, adding that current rates "reflect the reality in
China right now."</p>
<p>Interest rates on China loans rose about 50 basis points,
to about 75 basis points above the London interbank offered
rate, or Libor, soon after the June 1989 crackdown, and they
remain near that level. (A basis point is one hundredth of a
percentage point. Libor is the rate banks in London charge
one another for U.S. dollar loans.)</p>
