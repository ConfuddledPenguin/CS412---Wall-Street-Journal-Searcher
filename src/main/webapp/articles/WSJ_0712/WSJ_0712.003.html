	<p class="article-leader">LONDON -- Britain's infant cable-television industry is
turning into nearly an all-American enterprise.
   With the last three franchises awarded this week, U.S.
companies now own or hold majority stakes in more than 73% of
the 135 U.K. cable franchises. American cable-TV operators
and regional Bell telephone companies probably will spend
more than $5 billion to build an industry stymied for years
by skittish local investors and scarce programming. Optimists
believe that the Yankee investment and marketing know-how
could help raise cable-TV's penetration from today's scant
1.4% of British television households to 19%, or four million
households, by 1995 -- still far below the more than 55%
level seen in the U.S.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>U.S. money started pouring into Britain about 18 months
ago, after regulators loosened limits on foreign control of
cable operations. Among the U.S. concerns committing large
sums are: U S West Inc., U.S. Cable Corp., Jones Intercable
Inc., Pacific Telesis Group, Nynex Corp. and Comcast Corp.</p>
<p>American cable-TV operators, facing an oversaturated
domestic market, see Britain as a critical beachhead for
future expansion Europewide.</p>
<p>Cash-rich Baby Bells view the U.K. as a testing ground for
both Continental Europe and for expected future deregulation
at home. Unlike the U.S. and much of Europe, Britain lets
cable operators offer both television and phone services on a
limited basis; so far, it has been unprofitable. Yet "you
don't have to calculate in the telephone business to make the
case that cable will be a very profitable business in the
U.K." within a decade, argues Royce Caldwell, Southwestern
Bell Corp.'s senior vice president for corporate development.
It owns significant portions of six British cable-TV
franchises.</p>
<p>The invasion from America carries risks, however. It's
dubious how much of a foothold Britain provides for the rest
of Europe. In many other European nations, cable television
has spread further than in the U.K. but remains publicly
owned and operated -- effectively closing lucrative markets
such as West Germany. Meanwhile, U.S. legislative moves to
bar foreign ownership of U.S. cable operations could have
repercussions.</p>
<p>There's a much bigger worry for American players in the
British cable-TV industry: the competitive threat from the
faster installation and more aggressive promotion of
"direct-to-home" satellite television. Sky Television, owned
by Rupert Murdoch's News Corp., had a shaky start last year
but claims nearly one million U.K. and Irish homes currently
get its channels through satellite-receiving dishes.</p>
<p>In the U.K., most cable operators won't complete wiring
their franchise areas until "a very large chunk of the
potential audience already is receiving satellite television
direct to home," warns Caroline Bentley, a director at GAH,
London business-strategy consultants.</p>
<p>Ironically, it was Sky Television's arrival and
availability over cable-TV wires that breathed new life into
the industry. Several U.S.-backed cable operators have
introduced packages that include channels from both Sky TV
and its new rival British Satellite Broadcasting Ltd. -- at
prices less than renting the receiving equipment from either
satellite service.</p>
<p>This approach, along with aggressive American gimmicks
such as tough sales incentives and free service for limited
periods, is winning more subscribers for some cable-TV
companies, such as East London Telecommunications Ltd., a
joint venture between Pacific Telesis and Jones Intercable.</p>
<p>But despite its subscriber gains, East London
Telecommunications finds door-to-door solicitation and
direct-mail circulars "haven't worked as well as they do in
the States," concedes Managing Director Gerald Yutkin.</p>
<p>Yet, Mr. Yutkin says Americans "wouldn't be putting that
much time and money and effort" into the British cable-TV
business unless they believed it could grow faster than the
U.S. industry did. But "it's just going to take longer" here,
he says. "It's tough. It's very tough."</p>
