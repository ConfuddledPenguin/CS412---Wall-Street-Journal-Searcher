	<p class="article-leader">Allen Group Inc., which makes automobile-testing equipment
and truck parts, expects to report second-quarter per-share
earnings more than doubled on strength in two divisions.
   The Melville, N.Y., company told analysts that per-share
earnings reached about 55 cents to 60 cents, compared with 27
cents the year earlier. The estimates translate to net income
of $5.5 million to $6 million versus $3.2 million.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>In a news release, the company didn't estimate revenue.
For the year-ago period, Allen Group's revenue was $94
million.</p>
<p>In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday,
Allen Group shares rose 37.5 cents to $19.</p>
<p>The company's chairman and chief executive officer, Philip
W. Coburn, cited Allen Testproducts, which makes automotive
diagnostic and emission-test equipment, and Antenna
Specialists, which sells equipment for cellular-telephone
systems, as particularly strong-performing divisions.</p>
