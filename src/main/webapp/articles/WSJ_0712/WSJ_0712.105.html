	<p class="article-leader">CHICAGO -- Plenty of Americans know that Japanese
investors have gobbled up Columbia Pictures Entertainment
Inc. and New York's Rockefeller Center. But with less
fanfare, the Japanese are also pouring money into trading in
the booming U.S. financial futures markets.
   It was only three years ago that Japanese securities firms
began buying seats on Chicago's Board of Trade and Mercantile
Exchange, the two biggest U.S. futures markets. Since then,
Japanese trading here has increased sharply.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The Japanese may already account for as much as 40% of the
volume in the bustling Eurodollar pit at the Chicago Merc,
where financial futures based on the fluctuation of
short-term interest rates are traded. Leo Melamed, chairman
of the Chicago Merc's executive committee, has predicted that
by 1992 a third of the Merc's total volume will come from the
Japanese.</p>
<p>Yet while financial markets in Japan at times are given to
speculation, Japanese tastes here tend toward futures based
on bonds and interest rates, contracts frequently used to
hedge the risk of relatively conservative fixed-income
investments like U.S. Treasury bonds.</p>
<p>"Certainly, Japanese investors have invested heavily in
U.S. Treasury bonds and related futures, but not much in U.S.
equities or the corresponding futures," said Nobuaki Ohmura,
executive vice president of Daiwa Securities America Inc., a
unit of one of the "Big Four" Japanese securities firms.</p>
<p>And as a rule, Japanese trading strategies are more
methodical and patient than those employed by American
traders. John Mitchell, a veteran trader in Eurodollar
futures at the Merc, spent 18 months working the Merc floor
for Daiwa. "A few of the Japanese traders are gunslingers,
with what you'd call American aggressiveness, but the vast
majority pick a trend and ride it out, for better or worse,"
said Mr. Mitchell, now employed by Chicago-based O'Connor &
Co. "They have more money, so they have more patience. They
are less likely to bail out of a position if the price drops
a little."</p>
<p>One reason for the caution is Japanese inexperience with
futures and options, so-called derivative products whose
values are linked to the performance of other investments. In
Japan, futures markets, while extremely active, are nascent
compared with Chicago's exchanges. And until 1987, the
Japanese Ministry of Finance prohibited the country's
institutional investors -- banks, pension funds and insurance
companies -- from trading directly in U.S. futures markets.</p>
<p>Another factor, analysts say, is that the big Japanese
investors tend to turn their money over to managers on the
basis of Japanese corporate relationships, rather than
performance. That's in contrast to the U.S., where
competition for returns has forced many money managers to
trade futures and options in ever more sophisticated and
aggressive investing strategies.</p>
<p>"In Japan, the fund managers are still chosen more than
anything based on historical relationships," said Nicholas
Ronalds, deputy managing director of the Chicago Merc's Tokyo
office. "When selection is done on that basis, performance
can fall pretty low as a priority for the money manager."</p>
<p>Many big Japanese investors have been reluctant to dabble
in more speculative and abstract instruments and slow to
master complicated program trades that include heavy use of
stock-index futures and stock options. That's changing,
albeit slowly. Some Japanese firms are now trying to learn
index-arbitrage strategies, forms of program trading
involving large, computer-assisted stock trades tied to
offsetting stock-index futures transactions.</p>
<p>For instance, Nomura Securities International Inc., the
U.S. subsidiary of the world's largest securities firm,
recently hired two former Kidder, Peabody & Co. executives to
revamp its operations here. One of the goals of Max C.
Chapman Jr., the new president of Nomura's U.S. unit, and
Joseph R. Schmuckler, a program-trading specialist hired as
senior vice president, is to improve the capability of
Nomura's sleepy U.S. division to exploit futures and options
markets.</p>
<p>A few Japanese institutional investors such as Nippon
Credit Bank also are dabbling in complicated stock-index
futures trades. "We started out a few years ago in a
straightforward manner, buying and selling futures, using
them primarily to hedge," said Atsushi Sato, a vice president
in Nippon Credit's New York branch. "Since then, we've been
adding the so-called arbitrage trades."</p>
<p>Other big Japanese investors have sought to acquire
no-wait expertise by forming alliances with experienced U.S.
futures and options trading firms. This week, for example,
Mitsubishi Trust & Banking Corp., Japan's largest trust bank,
announced a joint venture with a major U.S. trading concern,
Chicago Research & Trading Group Ltd. Chicago Research,
headed by Joseph Ritchie, uses sophisticated computer trading
systems to execute tens of thousands of trades a day. By
forming a joint venture, Mitsubishi gains access to Mr.
Ritchie's expertise, and Chicago Research benefits from
Mitsubishi's rich reserves of capital.</p>
<p>And while the volume of business done in stock-index
futures and options by Japanese investors remains relatively
small, that's far less true in the pits where Treasury-bond
and Eurodollar futures are traded. Treasury bond futures are
commitments to buy U.S. government bonds for the prevailing
price at a given date in the future. Eurodollar futures,
whose name refers to dollars held by investors outside the
U.S., are based on interest rates.</p>
<p>Japanese trading in these products, which big investors
use to manage risk, is increasing quickly, according to
Japanese Ministry of Finance data. Analysts say this trading
reflects more speculation in the futures and a growing
understanding among Japanese investors of the need to hedge
to protect their large holdings of U.S. bonds and their
dollar-denominated accounts.</p>
<p>In the Eurodollar market, for instance, trading by
Japan-based financial institutions rose to a monthly average
of 875,000 contracts during the first quarter of 1990. That's
up 18% from a 1989 first-quarter average of 743,000 contracts
a month. About 90% of those contracts were traded on the
Chicago Merc.</p>
<p>What's more, these figures don't include trading by U.S.
branches and subsidiaries of Japanese institutions, and
analysts estimate that on some days the U.S. branches can do
nearly as much trading as investors based in Japan.</p>
<p>In Treasury bond futures, Japan-based investors are
trading an average of about 568,000 contracts a month, up 49%
from 380,000 during the first quarter of 1989. The Chicago
Board of Trade accounts for about 95% of all those contracts.</p>
