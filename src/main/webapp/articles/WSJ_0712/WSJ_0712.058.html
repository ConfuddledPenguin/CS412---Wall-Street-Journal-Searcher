	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- The Senate overwhelmingly approved a
wide-ranging anti-crime bill that includes a partial ban on
semiautomatic "assault weapons" and numerous provisions aimed
at invigorating the investigation and prosecution of
savings-and-loan fraud.
   The omnibus bill, which passed 94-6, also would expand the
federal death penalty to cover 34 crimes, curb the
constitutional appeals process for death-row inmates, and
provide $900 million in federal assistance to local
law-enforcement agencies in the coming fiscal year -- twice
the amount proposed by the Bush administration.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Eager to appear tough on the widespread looting of S&Ls,
senators increased penalties for financial fraud, including a
new statute that would provide up to life imprisonment for
high-level thrift executives who conspire with three or more
other violators and derive more than $5 million from their
crimes. Other provisions would provide prosecutors with
broader authorization to use civil seizure and forfeiture
laws in bank and S&L fraud cases.</p>
<p>The Senate also authorized new spending of $162.5 million
for each of the next three years to hire more federal
investigators and prosecutors devoted strictly to
financial-institution cases. That amount would be in addition
to $50 million appropriated for such cases for the current
fiscal year, which ends Sept. 30. In addition, the Senate
authorized funds to hire 2,500 new federal agents and 480
prosecutors to deal with drug trafficking and other crimes.</p>
<p>The House is considering omnibus crime legislation of its
own, including various S&L enforcement provisions. But it
isn't clear when the full House will vote on these measures.
Equally unclear is whether President Bush would back a crime
package that includes the Senate's three-year ban on nine
types of assault weapons.</p>
<p>The Senate's rush to provide new money for thrift-fraud
prosecutions by the Justice Department came as the House
Appropriations Committee voted to give the Treasury
Department's Secret Service expanded authority to initiate
its own investigations of S&L-related crimes. The provision
is attached to a fiscal 1991 bill funding the Treasury
Department and is likely to touch off a turf war with the
Federal Bureau of Investigation, an arm of the Justice
Department that has tried to stop efforts by the Secret
Service to become more involved in reducing the current
backlog of thousands of cases.</p>
<p>Reflecting an apparent decision by the White House, the
Treasury officially opposes the expanded authority. But
behind the scenes, the Secret Service has promised allies in
Congress that it can make as many as 100 agents available
immediately, and 300 within the next fiscal year.</p>
<p>The Senate's election-year anti-crime package, which
seemed dead only several weeks ago, jumped back to life with
a high-voltage shock of S&L rhetoric. "We need to be cracking
down on the orgy of fraud and lawbreaking that occurred in
the savings-and-loan crisis," said Sen. Patrick Leahy (D.,
Vt.). The hefty batch of thrift-fraud provisions was added to
the omnibus bill at the last minute, with almost no partisan
bickering.</p>
<p>Last month, a filibuster orchestrated by the National
Rifle Association had threatened to kill the entire package.
But the powerful NRA repeatedly was unable to muster a
majority to eliminate the prohibition on assault weapons.
Meanwhile, quiet negotiations led by Sens. Joseph Biden (D.,
Del.) and Strom Thurmond (R., S.C.) kept the bill alive until
the almost desperate desire by lawmakers to take action on
the S&L issue assured its passage.</p>
<p>Many of the S&L-related provisions added to the Senate
bill, such as the provision for life imprisonment for "S&L
kingpins," appeared to be largely symbolic. Others included
those that merely formalize special thrift-fraud task forces
already created by the Justice Department.</p>
<p>The crime bill also would facilitate speedier restitution
to victims of S&L fraud, allow for public disclosure of
regulatory enforcement actions, and permit the government to
undo fraudulent transactions made by thrift executives.
Another provision would encourage individuals to report S&L
fraud to authorities by providing rewards for information
leading to convictions or civil recoveries. In civil cases,
the amount of such rewards would be tied to the value of
assets recovered and could total hundreds of thousands of
dollars.</p>
<p>William Seidman, chairman of the Resolution Trust Corp.,
urged Congress to pass the crime bill, saying it would "prove
to be a formidable deterrent to financial institution fraud
and abuse."</p>
<p>In a hearing before a House Judiciary subcommittee, Mr.
Seidman also defended the government's record in pursuing
crooked S&L directors and officers. The agency recovered more
than $100 million last year in liability claims against S&L
executives, he said, and an additional $200 million in
settlements and judgments in the first half of 1990.</p>
<p>The Senate dropped from the crime package a provision that
would have allowed, under certain circumstances, the use of
illegally gathered evidence in criminal trials.</p>
