	<p class="article-leader">CHICAGO -- Hartmarx Corp., hurt by a long slump in men's
suit sales, halved its dividend and took a charge of $51
million, primarily for closing 65 specialty stores.
   The charge, which also covers Hartmarx's plan to sell its
minority interest in its Mexican affiliate, brought the
company's net loss for the fiscal second quarter ended May 31
to $55.1 million, or $2.80 a share. In the year-ago period,
the apparel maker and retailer earned $3.1 million, or 16
cents a share.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Sales slipped slightly to $303.9 million from $304.5
million.</p>
<p>Hartmarx cut its quarterly dividend to 15 cents a share,
payable Aug. 15 to stock of record Aug. 1. The company had
paid a dividend of 30 cents a share.</p>
<p>Wall Street nevertheless reacted favorably. Hartmarx
stock, which has lost nearly half its value in recent months,
rose $1 to close at $11.375 in New York Stock Exchange
composite trading yesterday. "It's something they needed to
do," Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. analyst Josie Esquivel said
of the restructuring.</p>
<p>Harvey A. Weinberg, Hartmarx's chairman and chief
executive officer, said the moves were positive steps that
would help position the company for a recovery in menswear
sales.</p>
<p>Like other companies specializing in tailored clothing,
Hartmarx has been hurt by sluggish consumer demand and rising
wool prices that have pushed up the price of men's suits by
30% over the past two years. "It's been a pretty dismal
market," Mr. Weinberg said. But, he added: "I think that's
coming to an end and I'm encouraged" by spring 1991 orders
received by the company's manufacturing units. He said those
orders are running as much as 3% ahead of year-earlier
figures, compared with fall 1990 orders.</p>
<p>Hartmarx operates stores under such names as Wallachs,
Raleighs, Silverwoods and Baskin.</p>
<p>The stores slated for closing -- about 13% of Hartmarx's
retail operations -- are either unprofitable or marginally
profitable, Mr. Weinberg said. Hartmarx also plans to cut
costs by eliminating jobs in both the field and headquarters
organizations of its specialty store division. Mr. Weinberg
declined to say how many employees would be affected. The
company said that 15 of the 65 stores scheduled for closing
are Old Mill women's sportswear stores operated by its
Country Miss unit.</p>
<p>The 65 stores accounted for about $40 million in sales in
the latest fiscal year. But Mr. Weinberg said the company
hopes to transfer about 40% of the volume of shuttered stores
in major markets to other Hartmarx stores.</p>
<p>Hartmarx said it also intends to strengthen its specialty
store division by hiring two outsiders to fill senior posts
in marketing and merchandising.</p>
<p>Hartmarx's earnings from operations in the second quarter
were hurt by slack demand and markdowns, as well as deep
discounting by retail competitors that have held
going-out-of-business sales.</p>
<p>For the six months, Hartmarx said it had a net loss of
$52.8 million, or $2.68 a share, compared with a gain of
$12.9 million, or 66 cents a share, a year earlier. Sales
were $646.1 million, compared with $631.8 million.</p>
