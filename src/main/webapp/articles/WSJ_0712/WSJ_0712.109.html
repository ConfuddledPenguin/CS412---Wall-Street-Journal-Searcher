	<p class="article-leader">TORRANCE, Calif. -- American Republic Bancorp. said it
named William B. Oberholzer, 44 years old, as president of
its Republic Bank unit.
   Mr. Oberholzer was executive vice president of the
Republic Bank unit. In his new post, he assumes one of the
titles held by John B. O'Donnell before he resigned in late
May as president and chief executive officer of the parent
and unit.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>At the time, Mr. O'Donnell said in a letter to the boards
that he was resigning because he "may have inadvertently
engaged in activities which appear inconsistent with company
policy." The company didn't specify the policy, but said it
didn't suffer any losses as a result of the activities.</p>
<p>Mr. O'Donnell couldn't be reached for comment yesterday.</p>
