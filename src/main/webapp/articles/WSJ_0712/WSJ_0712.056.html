	<h3>Taiwan's Brokerage Industry Faces A Shakeout as Stock Prices Plummet</h3>

	<p class="article-leader">A five-month plunge in Taiwan's stock prices is putting
pressure on the country's securities companies, and brokers
say many of the firms could be out of business by year end.
   The first victim was Chao Chuen Securities Co., which
closed Tuesday. Brokers in Taipei say the small firm was
plagued by internal problems and its closure isn't likely in
itself to drag down other firms.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>However, Taiwan has fewer than 200 traded stocks and, with
the closing of Chao Chuen, 357 securities companies,
according to authorities in Taipei. With trading volume down
more than 50% from the high levels earlier this year, the
market can no longer support so many firms, brokers say.</p>
<p>"Without a doubt, Chao Chuen is really the first of many
to come, but it's not the domino that will cause the others
to go," says Peter Kurz, head of the Taiwan office of Baring
Brothers & Co.</p>
<p>Taiwan has some of the lowest trading commissions in the
world and some of the highest overhead costs. As individual
investors have swarmed into the market in recent years, the
number of securities companies vying for customers also has
soared, rising to the current 357 from only 27 in May 1988,
when the government lifted a long freeze on new brokerage
houses.</p>
<p>Customer defaults and trading losses already have taken a
toll on securities companies. And now, as volume continues to
shrink, some may call it quits and others may collapse.</p>
<p>Still, Taiwan survived a shakeout in the securities
industry in the early 1970s. However difficult the coming
upheaval may be, brokers believe a loss of many firms would
leave the industry leaner and better able to cope with a
developing market.</p>
<p>Taiwan's weighted stock index has dropped more than 60%
since its high point in February. It fell 6.3% yesterday.</p>
<p>Government regulations requiring each company to have a
trading floor and special equipment, and to carry out its own
stock settlements, keep overhead sky-high. Those expenses may
be too much for some of the smaller firms.</p>
<p>An additional complication is the fact that a large
percentage of stock transactions was funded by gray-market
margin lending, which isn't regulated by the government and
may not be backed by adequate capital.</p>
<p>In addition, some securities firms did their own margin
lending for stock transactions. To compete for customers
during the run-up in prices last year, many companies offered
loans and held about 30% of the shares as collateral. When
the market was booming, the system worked. Now, prices for
most of those shares are far below the purchase price and
customers have little incentive to pay off the loan. That
apparently is one of the problems that brought down Chao
Chuen, brokers say.</p>
