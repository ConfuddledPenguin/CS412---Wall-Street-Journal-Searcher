	<p class="article-leader">TOKYO -- Japan's economy will enter into a period of
gradual slowdown, but it will still expand at a respectable
4.1% pace in fiscal 1990 after inflation is taken into
account, a think tank predicted.
   Mitsubishi Research Institute said the Japanese economy,
following sustained expansion, will move on a "plateau" in
the fiscal year that began in April.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Nevertheless, it said, personal consumption will go up
4.0% with the help of income growth and will underpin the
economy despite a lower rate of increase in corporate capital
spending and housing investment.</p>
<p>Japan's economy has been expanding for 43 consecutive
months through June, the second longest postwar period of
expansion.</p>
<p>In fiscal 1990, Mitsubishi said, wholesale prices will
edge up 1.7% and consumer prices 2.5%, and the Bank of Japan
will maintain a tight credit stance. However, the research
institute said, the central bank is unlikely to raise the
official discount rate during this fiscal year from its
present level of 5.25%.</p>
<p>"As long as oil prices and other overseas conditions don't
show drastic changes," it said, "inflation, a source of most
serious concern in the process of economic growth in fiscal
1990 and 1991, won't worsen to the point where it could
seriously impede growth."</p>
