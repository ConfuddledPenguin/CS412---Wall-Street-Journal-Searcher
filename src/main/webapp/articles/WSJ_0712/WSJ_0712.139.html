	<p class="article-leader">NEW MILFORD, N.J. -- At Polifly Financial Corp., the torch
may be passing to a new generation.
   Earlier this month, Polifly announced the appointment of
42-year-old Joseph S. Paparatto as its new president and
chief executive officer. As president, he succeeds Gregg B.
Van Dam, who had left the firm in March in connection with a
consent agreement with federal regulators.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>And yesterday, three directors resigned, including
72-year-old Chairman Frederick T. Muller, who had been acting
chief executive officer prior to Mr. Paparatto's appointment.
Mr. Muller said, "It is an opportune time for us to resign
and enable Mr. Paparatto to nominate some individuals less
senior in years."</p>
<p>Resigning with Mr. Muller were John R. Speich Jr., 99
years old next month, and Herbert Hoexter, 90.</p>
<p>Polifly, the parent of Polifly Savings & Loan Association,
has reported heavy losses recently, the result of "high
levels of non-performing assets caused by a deterioration in
the New Jersey real estate market," according to the company.
Among other problems, the company has suspended dividends and
is the target of a civil class-action suit alleging
securities-law violations.</p>
<p>Recently, Polifly Financial & Polifly Savings entered into
the consent agreement restricting their activities. Any
default on the agreement could result in legal action against
the troubled thrift and its holding company.</p>
