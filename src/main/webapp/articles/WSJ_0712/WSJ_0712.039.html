	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan
Greenspan told a House panel that America's fiscal problems
have become so severe that he reluctantly supports a
constitutional amendment requiring a balanced federal budget.
   In 1979, as a private economist, Mr. Greenspan testified
against a proposal for a balanced-budget amendment. "At the
time, I was skeptical it could work," he said. But now, he
told the House Judiciary Committee yesterday: "The crucial
issue that I think creates the desire for a balance-budget
amendment is the bias that clearly exists in our system
toward deficits."</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The "very serious gridlock" Congress and administration
officials have encountered in trying to reduce the country's
massive budget deficit during the past few years, Mr.
Greenspan said, "suggests there is something in our system
that needs to be redressed, and I'd say regrettably by
constitutional means."</p>
<p>Mr. Greenspan didn't endorse a specific amendment but did
recommend a provision requiring more than a majority vote in
Congress to pass spending bills. He emphasized that he was
expressing his personal views and not those of the Fed.</p>
