	<p class="article-leader">HOBOKEN, N.J. -- Voters dealt a blow to development plans
on this Hudson River waterfront city, when they rejected a $2
billion real-estate complex by the narrow margin of 4,418 to
4,406.
   A coalition of anti-development groups forced the
referendum, following a Dec. 29 agreement between the Port
Authority of New York and New Jersey and Hoboken officials to
develop the waterfront. Opponents said the plan would cause
congestion and destroy the city's small-town atmosphere.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>As Hoboken's once-thriving port declined over the last
quarter century, city officials had hoped to replace
abandoned piers with a combination of offices and expensive
condominiums.</p>
<p>Even as neighboring New Jersey waterfront towns grew,
Hoboken's ambitious plans had a number of fits and starts,
primarily because the city has gone through several
administrations.</p>
<p>Among the issues still to be settled is the disposition of
a $7 million payment the Port Authority made to the city of
Hoboken early this year.</p>
<p>The referendum bars development for at least the next
three years on the waterfront site.</p>
