weight is his delight." -- Proverbs 11:1</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>GAITHERSBURG, Md. -- Richard Davis holds the weight of
America in his hands. It's a just weight, he believes. But he
isn't too sure about the one in France.</p>
<p>Mr. Davis is the Keeper of the Kilo -- the one man in
America charged with making sure that this country's official
kilogram weighs exactly that. He stores the kilogram -- a 1
1/2-inch cylinder of platinum and iridium -- in his
laboratory safe here and studies it as if it were an Old
Master.</p>
<p>This is the weight from which all other weights in the
U.S. are measured. If America's kilo is off, so is every
bathroom and butcher scale in the nation, not to mention
laboratory balance. (In 1959, the U.S. set the weight of one
pound at precisely 0.45359237 kilograms; one kilogram equals
about 2.2 pounds.)</p>
<p>But the King of Kilos is the international kilogram, which
is locked away in France, and something weird is happening:
It is losing weight, threatening to mess up measurements
world-wide.</p>
<p>The French have summoned Mr. Davis, a physicist at the
U.S. government's National Institute of Standards and
Technology, to investigate. "Every country has one mass guru,
and he's ours," says Barry Taylor, who edits the NIST Journal
of Research.</p>
<p>According to international treaty, a kilogram is a weight
equal to a plug of platinum-iridium stored at the
International Bureau of Weights and Measures in the Parc de
Saint-Cloud outside Paris. The French call this kilo "Le Gran
K" and treat it rather grandly, too. Le Gran K is locked in a
safe that requires three keys to open, including one held by
the Archivist of France. It has its own script insignia -- a
special K -- that's used in laboratory literature. And it has
rarely been disturbed for weighings since it was made in
1878.</p>
<p>But something has gone terribly wrong anyway, making for
Le Gran Mystere. The intrigue began last year, when George
Girard, a tall, balding measurement specialist at the
International Bureau, removed Le Gran K from its basement
safe, opened its glass-domed container and began comparing
the weight with seven other platinum kilos. He hoped to
recalibrate Le Gran K for the first time since shortly after
Paris was liberated from the Nazis.</p>
<p>Instead of harmony among the weights, he found discord. Le
Gran K, he discovered, had gotten lighter than six of the
comparison weights, called "the Witnesses." Indeed, Le Gran K
had shed as much as 75 billionths of a kilogram over the past
century compared with one Witness. "There was a slight
suspicion that this was happening in 1946," says Mr. Girard
through an interpreter. "Now we know precisely that it's
happening, but no one has a clear idea why."</p>
<p>For nearly any practical purpose -- weighing a bunch of
grapes in a supermarket, let's say -- that discovery won't
make a bit of difference. Seventy-five billionths of a
kilogram is lighter than a grain of sand. But in the precise
world of scientific measurements, a billionth of a kilogram
can seem as big as Jupiter. "If someone doesn't detect it,
differences get larger and larger and larger," frets William
Moore, who runs Los Angeles County's measurements laboratory.
"There's a word for this -- it's called chaos."</p>
<p>A cool head was clearly called for, and Mr. Davis had
already demonstrated his aplomb. For the past 12 years, the
44-year-old scientist has devoted himself to making sure
America's kilo, known simply as K-20, is a just weight. In
1983, he carted K-20 to France, where Mr. Girard weighed it,
for the first time in 35 years, against some of the
International Bureau's kilos. (Not Le Gran K, however, which
is used for measurements only every 45 years or so.)</p>
<p>Then Mr. Davis compared K-20 with the "working" weights,
made of stainless steel, that the U.S. laboratory uses to
calibrate weights sent to it by industrial and state labs. To
his dismay, he found that the working weights, and therefore
weights used all over the U.S., were off -- by 170 billionths
of a kilogram.</p>
<p>So on Jan. 1 of this year, the institute instructed labs
everywhere in the nation to reduce the value of their weights
by that amount. The world of precision measurement --
metrology -- breathed a bit easier on New Year's Day. Without
Mr. Davis's work, says Jerry Everhart, a metrologist at a
nuclear weapons plant in Miamisburg, Ohio, "eventually you'd
get in trouble -- you'd be off in the Milky Way."</p>
<p>A metrologist's life is a quiet one. Mr. Taylor, the NIST
journal editor and one of the field's few garrulous men,
boasts about "the romance of the next decimal point." But
that kind of talk embarrasses Mr. Davis, a modest man with a
brown mustache and a slight paunch. He walks quietly, talks
quietly, says he has no hobbies and spends his rare nights
out watching his wife, a violinist, play in baroque music
ensembles. He attempts a joke: " `Man is the measure of all
things' is a pun around here," he says of his laboratory,
where he is surrounded by metal weights that, of course, are
the real measure.</p>
<p>But there is no time for such hilarity. A kilo crisis
calls. So Mr. Davis is now in France for the Third
Verification, when national weights are measured against
those at the International Bureau.</p>
<p>Le Gran K was roused from its safe to be weighed against
the Witnesses for only the third time since 1878. Over the
next two years, two of the Witnesses will be weighed against
kilos from around the world, including K-20. After more than
four decades since the last time this happened, "the
uncertainty was becoming too large," says Terry Quinn, the
International Bureau's director.</p>
<p>But overhanging this proceeding is the questionable
stability of Le Gran K. Mr. Davis says he will spend a year
in Paris investigating leads, but he has already ruled out
foul play.</p>
<p>Only one person in the world, 62-year-old Mr. Girard, is
authorized to examine and weigh Le Gran K, and he has devoted
his life to keeping the kilo pristine. Metrologists study his
cleaning technique -- dirt could add mass to the kilo -- with
the awe of dance students watching Baryshnikov. The
International Bureau even plans to make an instructional
videotape of Mr. Girard rubbing kilos with chamois cloths.</p>
<p>Some metrologists blame the manufacturer for the problems.
Le Gran K and two other kilos were made in one batch in 1878;
40 more kilos, including K-20, were made in another batch
four years later. Johnson, Matthey & Co. of London made all
of them, plus a good many of a third batch of 23. The firm
may have made them slightly differently, the theory goes,
resulting in Le Gran K's batch getting lighter over time.</p>
<p>But Mr. Davis says there's no evidence of that. (A
spokesman for Johnson Matthey says the firm "doesn't know
anything" about the kilo problem.)</p>
<p>Mr. Davis thinks he knows the real culprit: polish. The
first 43 kilos were polished by the same person, A. Collot of
Paris, in the same way. But Mr. Davis believes that there may
be something in the emery-paste polish Mr. Collot used a
century ago that has affected how the kilos have kept up
their weight.</p>
<p>To test his theory, Mr. Davis will study the newest kilos,
in which diamond cutting tools are used to shine the
platinum. If the diamond-cut kilos differ from the older
polished ones in the way they respond to humidity and
cleaning, he believes, he may be on his way to solving this
kilo caper.</p>
<p>It's slow work, and frustrating, too. And although Mr.
Davis has made a name for himself as a kilo-sleuth, he says
he'd like to give it all up. He's cheering for his colleagues
who are studying phenomenally complicated ways to redefine
the kilos using measurements that don't depend on studying
the vagaries of a hunk of metal. "I don't worry about my
job," he says bravely. "That's like worrying about
blacksmiths when the automobile was invented."</p>
<p>Nine groups throughout the world are working on a kilo
replacement, without much luck so far. A group in Germany is
trying to count the number of atoms in a kilogram of silicon,
but since there are 21,510,714,285,700,000,000,000,000 --
approximately -- that's pretty tough. The U.S. standards lab
in Gaithersburg gave up on that approach a decade ago.</p>
<p>Instead, scientists here have constructed a two-story
contraption replete with lasers and superconducting magnets,
called the Absolute Volt, which measures the current and
voltage required to lift a kilogram. (A kilo then would
become a measure of electricity, not metal.) A group in
England has a similar experiment, but it is using
conventional magnets that weigh six tons and one ton instead
of superconducting magnets. Ed Williams, who's in charge of
the U.S. kilo-redefinition project, says he hopes to finish
his work by the year 2000 after spending $2.5 million.</p>
<p>Mr. Williams may change the kilogram forever, but he
modestly notes that metal weights would live on, too. "It
would be kind of awkward to put one of these in a grocery
store," he says of his invention.</p>
