	<p class="article-leader">DALLAS -- Southmark Corp. should sue its former auditing
firm, Grant Thornton, for negligence, and its former top
officers, Gene E. Phillips and William Friedman, for
mismanagement, a court-appointed examiner recommended in his
final report to the U.S. Bankruptcy Court.
   Characterizing his 500-page report as "a story . . . of
unsound acquisitions, overvalued assets, illusory sales,
phantom profits, hidden liabilities, insider dealing and
outsider cronyism," examiner Neal Batson also recommended
that the company further investigate the roles of Arthur
Weiss, current chairman, and certain directors in the
collapse of the real-estate conglomerate.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Southmark expanded aggressively as a full service
real-estate broker, management firm, syndicator and lender
until the market for real estate limited partnerships
collapsed in 1987. In obvious distress by 1988, the company
ousted Messrs. Phillips and Friedman in January 1989, and
filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection six months later.
Southmark attorneys don't believe Mr. Batson's report will
affect the confirmation of the company's plan of
reorganization, expected tomorrow.</p>
<p>In a prepared statement, Grant Thornton "emphatically
disagreed" with Mr. Batson's report. The accounting firm
asserted that "Southmark didn't fail because of its auditor.
Grant will not allow itself to be made a scapegoat."</p>
<p>An attorney for Mr. Friedman, Southmark's former vice
chairman, called the charges against his client unfounded.
Mr. Phillips, the company's former chairman, and current
Southmark officials couldn't be reached for comment.</p>
<p>Mr. Batson, who concluded that Southmark was insolvent by
late 1987 despite the apparent health of its financial
statements, identified $750 million in subsequent
transactions that could be challenged as preferential or
fraudulent transfers of assets.</p>
<p>Among the instances of "outsider cronyism" he cited was a
$2.2 million payment in 1988 to entities partially controlled
by Edwin T. McBirney III, the flamboyant former thrift
executive who was indicted yesterday by a federal grand jury
in Dallas in an unrelated case. The potential claims, the
examiner notes, represent "a significant opportunity" to
increase the payout to Southmark's creditors.</p>
<p>In hearings to confirm a plan of reorganization, Southmark
attorneys showed little enthusiasm for pursuing the largest
of those potential claims -- $481 million transferred by
Southmark to its wholly owned San Jacinto Savings Association
at the demand of thrift regulators.</p>
<p>Pursuing claims against the thrift, said R. Paul Wickes,
an attorney for Southmark, could lead to seizure of San
Jacinto by the Office of Thrift Supervision and "litigation
that never ends."</p>
<p>Southmark hopes to rebuild around its Houston-based
thrift. Its reorganization plan, which has been approved by
unsecured creditors and preferred shareholders, contemplates
a contribution of $100 million in capital to the thrift and
an orderly sale of its remaining assets. While the Office of
Thrift Supervision has agreed to the plan, it hasn't offered
any assurances that it won't seize the thrift subsequently.
As of March 31, San Jacinto had a negative net worth of $50.8
million.</p>
<p>Separately, the Securities and Exchange Commission
challenged clauses in the reorganization plan that would
shield current Southmark management from lawsuits. "The SEC
is raising it as an issue of legal significance to investors
generally" and to the regulators, said Gordon Robinson, an
SEC staff attorney.</p>
