	<p class="article-leader">A lawsuit linking an auto accident to the onset of a
chronic disease seems to open yet another new frontier in
personal-injury litigation.
   A New York appeals court has affirmed a jury's finding
that a car accident caused a woman sufficient stress to
trigger the symptoms of lupus, a chronic inflammatory disease
that weakens connective tissues and internal organs. The
woman, Corrie Collins, alleged that the accident "aggravated"
her lupus condition, which had previously been "quiescent."</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The court also upheld $300,000 in damages awarded by the
jury for Ms. Collins' pain and suffering, although it denied
her an additional $600,000 for lost wages and loss of
enjoyment of life.</p>
<p>Two of the five judges on the state Supreme Court
Appellate Division dissented from the decision, arguing that
"there is no medical proof that plaintiff's accident made her
alleged lupus any worse than it would have been from any
other precipitating cause."</p>
<p>Ms. Collins was a passenger in a car driven by Matthew
McGinley, a defendant in the case, who failed to stop at an
intersection and collided with another vehicle. Ms. Collins,
a high school student in 1981 when the crash occurred,
testified that shortly afterward she developed a facial rash,
a symptom of lupus. She also developed swelling of the eyes.
But she wasn't diagnosed with a form of the disease, systemic
lupus erythematosas, until 1986.</p>
<p>Thomas Leyden, a lawyer for Ms. Collins, said that
although previous cases have linked traumatic experiences to
the aggravation of other diseases -- such as arthritis and
Alzheimer's -- he knew of no other case suggesting that
stress caused a lupus flare-up. But, he said, "you should not
exclude lupus because it's not printed in the book up to
now."</p>
<p>Personal injury lawyers praised the appeals court's
decision, saying that research on lupus increasingly reflects
a link with stress.</p>
<p>Pamela Liapakis, a New York trial lawyer familiar with the
disease, said that the current state of research allows
doctors "to say on witness stands with a reasonable degree of
certainty that a stressful event could cause a flare-up."</p>
<p>But Jay Tressler, president of the International
Association of Defense Counsel, said the case was an example
of the effectiveness of the plaintiff's bar "in trying to
create expanded theories of recovery." He added, "I wish we
could bring the scales of justice a little more into balance
in determining what should be recoverable and what should
not."</p>
<p>And Arthur Lambert of New York's Lambert & Weiss, a lawyer
for Mr. McGinley, called the court's decision "astonishing,"
saying there is no way to prove that Ms. Collins had a
quiescent condition of lupus at the time of the crash. "The
only thing that showed after the accident was a rash, and
from a rash we got a verdict of $900,000."</p>
<p>Both sides say they may appeal the decision, since it
affirmed the jury's finding that stress caused the flare-up
but reduced Ms. Collins' damage award.</p>

<p>UPS IS ACCUSED of bias against employees who have beards.</p>
<p>United Parcel Service of America Inc., the world's largest
package-delivery company, prohibits all bearded employees
from working with the public. But in a civil lawsuit filed in
U.S. District Court in Chicago, the Equal Employment
Opportunity Commission said that under Title VII of the Civil
Rights Act of 1964, the Greenwich, Conn., company must exempt
workers who wear beards for sincere religious reasons.</p>
<p>EEOC filed the complaint on behalf of Aiyub Patel, who
brought the case to the agency, and others who might be
affected by the UPS policy. A UPS spokesman declined to
comment on the suit.</p>
<p>Mr. Patel, who left UPS in September 1989 after four
years, was an unloader, a post requiring no public contact.
When Mr. Patel, a Moslem, applied for a driver's position,
"he was informed of UPS's policy, which is to not have any
exceptions to their no-beard policy," said Zachary A. Tobin,
trial attorney at the EEOC district office in Chicago.</p>
<p>Under Title VII, Mr. Tobin said, a company must reasonably
accommodate such religious exceptions unless it can prove
"undue hardship on the conduct" of its business.</p>
<p>In Islam, beards are "purely a personal thing. Nothing in
the faith requires wearing the beard," said Charles L.
Geddes, professor of Islamic studies at the University of
Denver and director of the American Institute of Islamic
Studies there.</p>
<p>But Mr. Tobin said that "we're not an arbiter of religious
beliefs. In this case, Mr. Patel said it is part of his
religious beliefs that he must wear the beard. That's what we
go on."</p>
<p>EEOC has a similar case against UPS being litigated by its
Houston district office. That suit makes the religion claim
but also charges that the no-beard policy harms black males
because a number of them have a skin disorder,
pseudofolliculitis barbae, that makes shaving difficult.</p>
<p>The EEOC process requires that the agency try to settle
the issue before it begins litigation. Such efforts proved
fruitless, Mr. Tobin said.</p>

<p>ASBESTOS EMISSIONS prove costly in a New Jersey hotel-site
renovation.</p>
<p>In Newark, N.J., U.S. Attorney Michael Chertoff said
Tzavah Urban Renewal Corp., based in Brooklyn, N.Y., and four
other defendants agreed to pay a total of $330,000 under a
consent decree filed in federal court. The five had been
among parties accused of being responsible for
asbestos-emission violations in the renovation of the former
Old Military Park Hotel in downtown Newark between October
1987 and last August. In the decree, the defendants made no
admission of liability for violations.</p>
<p>The government alleged that Tzavah had ignored asbestos
rules at the renovation site, where it said
asbestos-insulated materials "were dry-stripped, dumped out
of upper-story windows and left exposed in huge refuse
piles." Airborne asbestos has been linked to diseases
including cancer.</p>
<p>The defendants' attorney, Damon R. Sedita, was unavailable
for comment, his office said. Tzavah officials couldn't be
reached for comment.</p>
<p>Earlier in the case, a $225,000 default judgment was
entered against Creer Industrial Corp., a demolition
contractor based in the Bronx, and its principal, William
Creer.</p>

<p>LAWYERS' BILLING RATES and incomes are on the rise.</p>
<p>Hourly billing rates for law-firm partners rose over the
past year, possibly reflecting law firms' efforts to cope
with escalating salaries for associates and the higher cost
of doing business.</p>
<p>The median billing rate for partners in early 1990 was
$150 per hour, up 8% from last year's rate of $139. The rate
for associates jumped only 3%, from $97 to $100.</p>
<p>The billing-rate figures appear in a survey of law-firm
economics conducted annually by Altman & Weil, a management
consulting group based in Newtown Square, Pa. More than 650
law firms nationwide completed a questionnaire about their
billing practices, compensation levels and staffing patterns.
The survey excluded solo practitioners.</p>
<p>Partners' median compensation rose 5%, to $141,203 from
$134,350. Associates' median salaries increased 8%, to
$60,270 from $55,635.</p>
<p>Ward Bower of Altman & Weil said, "The rise in billing
rates could be reflective of the fact that partners, who are
feeling the pinch in their incomes, are looking to make that
up by pushing billing rates upward."</p>

<p>COURT PANEL CRITICIZES ban on filming "Bonfire" scene in
courtroom.</p>
<p>A panel of judges, lawyers, media representatives and
state entertainment officials recommended that judges avoid
"content review" when deciding which films may be shot in New
Jersey's county courthouses.</p>
<p>The panel was established at the request of New Jersey
Supreme Court Chief Justice Robert N. Wilentz, who last May
banned the filming of a scene from "The Bonfire of the
Vanities" in an Essex County courthouse in Newark. The judge
complained that the scene, showing a group of black citizens
rioting, "could serve to seriously undermine the confidence
of black citizens in our court system."</p>
<p>But in an 11-page report, the 12-member panel, headed by
New Jersey Superior Court Judge Ralph V. Martin, expressed
concern that judges would become embroiled in non-judicial
disputes. The panel said that judges can dissociate
themselves from a film's content by requiring that the film's
credits include disclaimers.</p>
<p>Judge Wilentz's decision last May sparked widespread
protest from county administrators in New Jersey,
particularly in Essex County, where the movie's producers had
offered $250,000 for use of the courtroom.</p>
<p>A suit filed by Essex County pending in federal court in
Newark contends that the decision amounts to illegal
censorship. Judge Wilentz declined to comment while he
reviews the panel's report.</p>

<p>ALAN I. ROTHENBERG, president of the California state bar,
is leaving Manatt, Phelps, Rothenberg & Phillips, a Los
Angeles firm where he has specialized in corporate litigation
and sports law for the past 24 years, to join Latham &
Watkins. At Latham, a Los Angeles firm with 550 lawyers
nationwide, Mr. Rothenberg will be a senior litigation
partner. Says Mickey Kantor, a partner at 135-lawyer Manatt
Phelps, "It's a great loss to us professionally and
personally, but you don't expect partners to stay with you
forever."</p>
