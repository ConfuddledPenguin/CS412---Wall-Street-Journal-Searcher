	<p class="article-leader">CHICAGO -- UAL Corp. said its United Airlines unit
regained the top position among airlines in June for revenue
passenger miles. UAL had lost the No. 1 position to AMR
Corp.'s American Airlines two years ago.
   Most of United's growth is coming from its Pacific routes,
where traffic rose 35.6% in June from a year ago.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>United's June revenue passenger miles increased 8.4%, to
6.91 billion, from 6.37 billion a year earlier. A revenue
passenger mile is the revenue from one passenger flown one
mile.</p>
<p>American still isn't far behind United. American said its
June revenue passenger miles were 6.86 billion, compared with
6.88 billion last year, down 0.3%. An American spokesman
attributed the decline to a drop in traffic on American's
routes in the Caribbean and Mexico.</p>
<p>American recently started serving several countries in
Latin America, which should increase its passenger traffic in
the coming months.</p>
