	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Regulators' latest crackdown on Wall Street's
traditional "tombstone" advertisements will be headed for an
early grave, if a couple of giant securities firms have their
way.
   The National Association of Securities Dealers is trying
to stem a recent burst of creativity in tombstones, those
normally staid ads with heavy black borders that are Wall
Street's way of publicizing new securities offerings.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>But in the process of trying to eliminate confusion for
investors, the NASD, an industry self-regulatory group, has
disturbed industry giants such as Merrill Lynch & Co. and
American Express Co.'s Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. The firms
are fuming about a proposed NASD rule that would ban
brokerage firms from using "fictitious names" -- meaning any
name that isn't the official name of the brokerage firm -- in
their tombstone ads.</p>
<p>If forcefully applied, the rule would ban Merrill Lynch
from using Merrill Lynch Capital Markets in its tombstones,
and ban Shearson from using Lehman Brothers, the newly
resurrected name of its investment banking division, in these
ads. Shearson has built a whole strategy around bringing back
the Lehman name and using it for marketing purposes. And
Merrill Lynch, which plans to drop Capital Markets as a
marketing gimmick, anyway, still wants the right to use any
Merrill Lynch derivative it wants.</p>
<p>A Prudential Insurance Co. of America unit,
Prudential-Bache Securities Inc., also might have a problem
under the proposal, as it uses the name Prudential-Bache
Capital Funding in its tombstones.</p>
<p>Now the ball is in the court of the Securities and
Exchange Commission, where the NASD plan requires approval.
The proposed rule, Shearson complains in a letter to the SEC,
"represents an unnecessary intrusion into the business
practices of Shearson Lehman." Merrill Lynch, in a separate
letter, huffs: "The proposed changes . . . compromise our
ability to compete in the marketplace."</p>
<p>Prudential-Bache hasn't yet sent a letter to the SEC, but
a spokeswoman says the firm "has participated in discussions"
with Shearson and Merrill Lynch on the issue.</p>
<p>The NASD plan comes as regulators are accelerating their
scrutiny of what firms tell the public about securities. Two
years ago, the SEC imposed tough new rules limiting what
mutual funds can state in newspaper and magazine ads. The
NASD "is stepping up the same way we stepped up in mutual
funds a few years ago," says Robert Plaze, assistant director
of the SEC's division of investment management.</p>
<p>NASD officials say their proposed rule is part of a
broader effort to rein in some smaller brokerage firms'
increasing use of different names in ways that can confuse
investors. Clark Hooper, director of advertising for the
NASD, says the association has targeted "a lot of different
areas where we were seeing abuses. . . . Certain of our
members were allowing different names to be used by
{brokers}, for example, or specific branch offices, that were
not the name of the broker-dealer."</p>
<p>In one instance, an NASD official says, a brokerage firm
with 21 branches has been doing business under a different
name in each branch. "We're trying to make sure the public
knows with whom they're dealing," Ms. Hooper says.</p>
<p>Tombstones are simply formal announcements that a
brokerage firm has issued securities to the public. Though
the ads have been used in various forms since the early days
of Wall Street, current SEC rules on tombstones have been in
effect only since 1955.</p>
<p>Regulators adopted strict rules governing tombstones
because they didn't want firms to be able to tell investors
so much about an offering that customers didn't have to get a
prospectus before buying. The ads can include a company's
logo. Ads for bonds also can include the securities' yield.</p>
<p>But a recent NASD notice sent to brokerage firms reminds
the firms that under federal securities law, tombstone ads
for stocks, bonds and products such as limited partnerships
can't discuss investment objectives or "economic conditions,"
or include photos or statistical graphics.</p>
<p>Not all tombstones are created equal. For example,
tombstone ads for mutual funds allow far more extensive
descriptions of the company and its operations than brokerage
firms' ads for stocks, bonds and limited partnerships. (The
SEC has regulated mutual-fund tombstones since the early
1970s.)</p>
<p>The NASD says it has noticed problems with ads that
include the names of both brokerage firms and non-brokers,
such as financial planners. In its proposed regulation, the
association wants a clearer sense in ads of who is offering a
particular security.</p>
<p>Any reference to a division of a brokerage firm must
include the parent's name, too, according to the proposed
rule. This is the part that rankles Merrill Lynch and
Shearson.</p>
<p>In its letter to the SEC, Shearson says banning
"well-recognized trade names in tombstone announcements of
securities offerings" wouldn't serve any public good and
would crimp Shearson's efforts to "create the desired public
image for the firm." Even though Merrill Lynch will soon stop
using the name Merrill Lynch Capital Markets in its tombstone
ads, the firm wants to be sure it can use any variation of
its name in all its advertising and communications. (Merrill
Lynch doesn't want to be locked into using the cumbersome
Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Inc., the name of its
broker-dealer unit.)</p>
<p>A sticky problem for regulators: If they make an exception
for Shearson or Merrill Lynch, they may be flooded with
complaints from hundreds of much smaller brokerage firms
seeking equal treatment.</p>
<p>The whole issue is expected to be thrashed out tomorrow,
when the NASD board is to meet. Officials won't say whether
they will change the rule. But Joseph Hardiman, NASD
president, appears somewhat sympathetic to the issues raised
by Shearson and Merrill Lynch.</p>
<p>"We never intended to impact, in tombstone ads, the
Merrill Lynches, or Pru-Baches or Lehman Brothers," Mr.
Hardiman says. For example, he says that the NASD realizes
that Lehman Brothers isn't a "totally fictitious" name, even
though it isn't a brokerage firm on its own. "We're
addressing that issue," he says.</p>
