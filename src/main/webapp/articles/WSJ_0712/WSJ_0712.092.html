	<p class="article-leader">The Houston summit got the China question out of the way
early on, essentially telling the Japanese it was their
business if they wanted to reactivate a $5.2 billion,
five-year line of credit to China. Beyond that, the
summiteers didn't have much to say about China. Still, one
could argue that the summit did set conditions for any
eventual help for China, namely the ones laid out for the
Soviet Union: "Introduce more radical steps toward a
free-market economy."
   We hope this is essentially the message given repeatedly
to the mayors of six big Chinese cities who've just been sent
off on a 20-day tour of seven American cities. Leading the
group is Shanghai's Mayor Zhu Rongji, who is here to seek
backers for his vision of a multibillion-dollar special
industrial zone near Shanghai.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Funding for the tour, set up by the private National
Committee on U.S.-China Relations, includes a $55,000 grant
from the U.S. Information Agency. It is a minor sum, but one
provided by U.S. taxpayers and it suggests a further thaw in
U.S. relations with Beijing's Communists.</p>
<p>Yet Beijing has made no basic reforms since Tiananmen, or
actually since about 1986. To the contrary, it has tightened
economic and political control with a more active informer
network and has taken a backflop into deeper central
planning.</p>
<p>Still, there are obviously strong tendencies in the West,
notably at the White House, to get on with the business of
"helping" China. We are asked to believe that "Realpolitik"
demands nothing less. There's the
China-must-not-sink-into-isolation argument. There's even the
Chinese government's line that in killing democrats it only
did what it had to do to preserve "stability."</p>
<p>But Japan's Prime Minister Kaifu, President Bush and
private investors should take a closer look at China's
economic quicksand before entertaining thoughts of pouring in
fresh resources. The CIA's annual report on China's economy,
released June 28, predicts "continued weaknesses," and says
that "the growth rate of the once vibrant rural industrial
sector has dropped sharply, and the production of state-run
enterprises remains sluggish." The report adds that last year
more than one million local enterprises, mostly on the farms,
had to shut down for lack of credit and raw materials, which
had been diverted to big wasteful state enterprises.</p>
<p>For all the rightly praised reforms of the early 1980s,
China remains a state-planned economy, with no system of
property rights or independent law. Uncertainty about the
likely upheavals in the "stable" government after the death
or fade-out of 85-year-old Deng Xiaoping is also taking its
toll. For the country's most creative people, it is safest
right now to do nothing.</p>
<p>Private investors might also consider the recent report by
The Asian Wall Street Journal's Julia Leung, that China's
government "is dragging its feet in honoring loan guarantees
issued by troubled state enterprises." Better also to
remember that China's government wants to keep monopoly
control over raw materials while pursuing a parallel market
economy. This is precisely the recipe for arbitrage between
state and quasi-private enterprises that by early last year
had produced graft, wild state spending, soaring inflation --
and had many Chinese contractors reneging on agreements with
foreign businesses.</p>
<p>Prior to Tiananmen, China would have been very much on the
menu of topics discussed at an economic summit such as that
in Houston. Today, sadly, it is barely a footnote to the
agenda.</p>
