	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- The Commerce Department ruled that Mexican
shipments of gray Portland cement and clinker are being
dumped, or sold in the U.S. at less than their production
costs or home-market prices.
   The department's final determination will result in stiff
anti-dumping duties on imports from Cemex S.A., Mexico's
largest cement producer, and other Mexican suppliers if the
International Trade Commission affirms that such shipments
are injuring U.S. producers. The ITC has to rule on the
injury question within 45 days.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The Commerce Department found dumping margins of 57.96% on
Cemex shipments, 53.26% on those from Apasco S.A. de C.V.,
3.69% on Cementos Hidalgos S.C.L., and 57.66% on those from
all other Mexican suppliers. These findings are likely to
nudge overall cement prices higher in the Southwestern
states, Florida and California, where the Mexican products
have been in increasing demand.</p>
<p>The department acted on a petition from a group of cement
producers in Arizona, New Mexico, Texas and Florida. The
petitioners claim that rising Mexican shipments have
depressed prices in the Southwest and displaced U.S.
supplies. Gray Portland cement is widely used for public
works and business construction. Clinker is an intermediate
material that is ground into cement.</p>
<p>"Those are extremely large margins for a fungible
commodity that's sold solely on the basis of price," said
Joseph Dorn, a lawyer for the U.S. producers.</p>
<p>The Commerce Department estimated the value of last year's
Mexican shipments at $111 million.</p>
