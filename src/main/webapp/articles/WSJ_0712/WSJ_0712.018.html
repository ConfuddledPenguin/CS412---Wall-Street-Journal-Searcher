   California Its Youth</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>CALIFORNIA IS our most ethnically diverse state, meaning
its future is young.</p>
<p>The Center for Continuing Study of the California Economy,
based in Palo Alto, estimates that 40% of the state's
population is black, Hispanic, or Asian. By 2000, this share
may rise to half.</p>
<p>Blacks, Hispanics, and Asians are younger than
non-Hispanic whites. As these groups gain share in the
state's population, California will age more slowly than the
rest of the country. In 2010, its median age will be 36
years, compared with 39 years for the U.S. The median ages
are nearly identical now.</p>
<p>Youthful, ethnic populations are also more family-oriented
than non-Hispanic whites. Nearly half of Hispanic households
in California are married couples with children, compared
with only 24% of non-Hispanic white households. Nationwide,
the share of family households, which include single parents
and families without children, is expected to decline to 68%
in 2000 from 71% in 1990, while the share of nonfamily
households and singles rises. But in California, the share of
families could rise to 70% in 2000 from 68% in 1990.</p>
<p>Hispanics have the largest households in California,
averaging 3.82 people, followed by 3.39 people in Asian
households and 2.72 in black. The shrinking group of
non-Hispanic whites has the smallest households of all, only
2.42 people. According to the center, "these trends should
intensify, and California should become a comparatively more
child-oriented market in the next decade."</p>
<p>Health Coverage</p>
<p>Often Marked by Gaps</p>
<p>MOST AMERICANS have health insurance. But more than one
out of four don't have it all the time.</p>
<p>A survey by the Census Bureau followed people over a
28-month period from 1986 to 1988. Four percent of the
population had no health insurance, public or private, for
the entire period. Another 24% had no coverage at least some
of the time.</p>
<p>Men were more likely than women to lack health insurance
for one month or more, 30% vs. 27%. And although blacks and
Hispanics were more likely than whites to be covered by
Medicaid, they were more likely to lack health insurance.
Thirty-eight percent of blacks had no health insurance some
of the time, as did 52% of Hispanics.</p>
<p>A majority of young adults had no health insurance at some
point over the two-year period, 52%, compared with less than
1% of people aged 65 and older.</p>
<p>There are also differences in coverage by family status.
Only 23% of people who were in a married-couple family for
the entire survey period went without health insurance for
more than one month. Among those who were never in a
married-couple family, 34% went without health insurance for
at least a month. Those who changed their family status
during the survey period were most likely to go without
health insurance: 52% of those who spent just part of the
time in a married-couple family lacked health coverage for a
month or more.</p>
<p>Japanese Goods Rank</p>
<p>High With Students</p>
<p>COLLEGE students have a higher opinion of many Japanese
products than they do of those made in the U.S.</p>
<p>A Roper Campus Reports study found that college students
favor Japanese-made cars and home electronics over those made
in the U.S. About three-quarters of students surveyed think
that Japanese stereos and televisions are better than those
made in Europe or the U.S. Half think that Japanese cars are
the best (and 65% of students own cars).</p>
<p>Europe rates second in car quality, with 26% of students
picking them over Japanese or American cars. Only 18% say
American cars are the best. Students also think that European
watches are superior to all others.</p>
<p>The categories in which the U.S. wins big are sports and
apparel. Two-thirds of students surveyed rate American-made
casual clothes tops, and 70% say the U.S. makes the best
sports equipment and athletic shoes. (European bicycles,
however, are considered the best.)</p>
<p>The U.S. and Europe tied in dress clothes, with each
garnering 44% of the surveyed students' preference. Only 2%
of students surveyed say the Japanese make the best dress
clothes.</p>
<p>Odds and Ends</p>
<p>HAWAII may be the best place to be whether you're working
or not, according to 1989 data from the Bureau of Labor
Statistics. The state had the lowest unemployment rate in the
country last year, 2.6%. And many of those who were
unemployed chose to be -- almost 30% quit their previous
jobs. That is the highest rate of any state in a tie with
Connecticut. . . . According to the Census Bureau's March
1989 Current Population Survey, 82% of Hispanic households
have telephones, compared with 94% of non-Hispanic
households. The older and better educated Cuban subgroup is
much more likely to have telephones -- 92% of Cuban
households do, compared with only 76% of Puerto Ricans and
80% of Mexicans. . . . The median cost in the U.S. of a
2,400-square-foot suburban house with four bedrooms and 2 1/2
baths was $176,000 in the first quarter of this year. In San
Jose, Calif., the same type of house cost $497,800, based on
an analysis of recent home sales by Runzheimer International
of Rochester, Wis. That's more expensive than anywhere else
in the country. San Francisco came in second, followed by Los
Angeles, New York, Washington and Boston. The good news (for
buyers) is that in some cases, prices are down from 1989.</p>
