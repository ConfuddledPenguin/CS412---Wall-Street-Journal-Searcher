	<p class="article-leader">A suitor's "expression of interest" in Public Service Co.
of New Mexico yesterday gave Wall Street one more reason to
believe that this battered stock may finally be worth
investors' notice.
   The utility's shares surged after it disclosed that
Wheeler Peak Capital Corp., a local venture-capital concern,
has floated the idea of acquiring PS New Mexico for $12 a
share, plus a sliver of equity in the continuing company. The
stock closed at 11 3/4, up 2.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Wheeler Peak appears to be a one-man operation. That man
is Albert J. Robison, a former senior vice president and
chief financial officer for PS New Mexico, which like Wheeler
Peak is based in Albuquerque.</p>
<p>The 49-year-old Mr. Robison, who retired two years ago,
was traveling and couldn't be reached. He has, however, been
in touch with Southwestern Public Service Co. in Amarillo and
other potential investors about PS New Mexico. A Southwestern
PS official late yesterday confirmed that company's talks
with Wheeler Peak and its interest in certain PS New Mexico
assets.</p>
<p>After a trading halt for the early afternoon news, the
utility's stock resumed trading at 11, up one point from the
previous trade, but the shares posted further gains later.
Wheeler Peak's overture was seen as likely to flush out other
interested buyers, and PS New Mexico is more than ready to
consider offers.</p>
<p>The down-in-the-dumps company previously hired Morgan
Stanley to help it decide by summer's end whether to sell any
or all of its operations, said John Ackerman, PS New Mexico's
chief executive officer. "I told my work force that my own
personal direction is not to pursue a purchase," he said.</p>
<p>Public Service Co. of Colorado is often thought of as a
natural to acquire PS New Mexico. The Colorado utility needs
extra power and already is connected with PS New Mexico's
system. A spokesman for PS Colorado said company policy
doesn't allow comment on mergers and acquisitions.</p>
<p>PS New Mexico, pummeled by an ill-fated diversification
move and excess capacity, has suspended common dividends, cut
its staff by 20% and has sold off nonutility assets. A major
customer didn't renew a $110 million-a-year contract and
regulators ordered the already reeling company to reduce its
rates. PS New Mexico's common stock, which peaked three years
ago at 39 1/4 a share, has been languishing at about 10
recently.</p>
<p>But there's growing sentiment on Wall Street that PS New
Mexico may be through the worst. For investors willing to
hold on for a while, the utility's belt-tightening combined
with moderate but steady growth in electricity demand in its
service area may breathe life back into the moribund stock,
some analysts say.</p>
<p>"All the damage has been done," says Ed Tirello of Smith
Barney. He cites as a turning point the recent changes in top
management at the utility. Former chairman, president and
chief executive officer Jerry D. Geist, who had been
intimately associated with PS New Mexico's troublesome extra
capacity and diversification, resigned last month. Mr.
Ackerman, former head of the utility's gas company unit,
became president and chief executive.</p>
<p>"The prior manager had alienated the political machine in
the state," says Mr. Tirello, adding: "The new management has
the opportunity to mend that."</p>
<p>The New Mexico Public Service Commission has been wholly
unsympathetic to the utility's excess power problems,
refusing to let rate payers bear the cost of unneeded energy,
particularly the utility's $1.2 billion investment in the
Palo Verde nuclear project in Arizona.</p>
<p>Mr. Tirello says a turnaround hinges on the company's
ability to sell its excess electricity at a profit, which he
projects will happen by 1995 as the Southwest grows and power
becomes tighter. Right now, the company loses 1.5 cents to
three cents on every wholesale 1,000 kilowatts sold,
according to analysts' estimates.</p>
<p>Alan Berro, utility analyst with the mutual-fund giant
Fidelity Investments, is betting on a much quicker rebound,
even without a buy-out. Fidelity has bought 1,350,000 shares
on the theory that PS New Mexico will be out of the hole in
two years. "If the stock doubles at that time, I'm a hero,"
says Mr. Berro. He won't say how much the stock cost but
indicated it wasn't too far from $10 a share.</p>
<p>The two-year projection, Mr. Berro concedes, is his
best-case outlook. He's willing to sit tight even if it takes
longer. "I have a long-time horizon," he says.</p>
<p>A few analysts are ready to throw in the towel now. Barry
Abramson with Prudential-Bache says PS New Mexico's woes are
intractable. "Their financial progress is stuck and can't go
forward until the market conditions improve," says Mr.
Abramson, who recommends selling. He doesn't see a
stock-price improvement until 1993.</p>
<p>That's too long to wait in his opinion. "I just don't see
the light at the end of the tunnel," he says, "because the
tunnel is such a long tunnel."</p>
