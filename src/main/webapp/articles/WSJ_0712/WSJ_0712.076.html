	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Unlisted stock prices advanced behind a late
surge of buying on the New York Stock Exchange, ignoring
another earnings disappointment by Oracle Systems.
   Traders say buyers flooded into OTC stocks near the end of
the day after watching prices climb steadily on the Big
Board.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Investors have been waiting for prices to drop over
concerns about weak secondquarter earnings, but when prices
failed to fall, the buyers grew more brave, says Lance
Zipper, manager of OTC trading at Kidder, Peabody & Co.</p>
<p>"Even when {the market} sells off, it doesn't do so with
any gumption," Mr. Zipper says. "It just feels like a real
bull market."</p>
<p>Losses in Oracle's stock made a dent in the OTC market's
gains, however. The stock dominated trading for most of the
day, dropping 2 1/2 points to 19 7/8 on volume of more than
9.3 million shares.</p>
<p>The company disappointed Wall Street analysts and
investors for the second consecutive quarter by reporting
earnings below its estimates.</p>
<p>Late Tuesday, the company said it earned 39 cents a share
in its fourth quarter ended in May, up from 25 cents a year
earlier. But many analysts had expected the company to earn
between 45 cents and 50 cents a share in the quarter.</p>
<p>Those estimates were based on Oracle's projections, made
in May, that it would earn between 90 cents and $1 a share
for the latest fiscal year. Instead, Oracle earned 86 cents a
share for the year.</p>
<p>Oracle's trouble may have put the brakes on the OTC
market's rise. The Nasdaq Composite Index gained 2.93, or
0.64%, to 463.90. The New York Stock Exchange Composite Index
gained 1.2%.</p>
<p>OTC advancers led decliners, 1,050 to 838. Volume grew to
159 million shares from 142.3 million shares Tuesday.</p>
<p>While Oracle's latest earnings disappointment left more
than a few Wall Street analysts red in the face, it didn't
scare investors the way past disappointments have.</p>
<p>In March, Oracle stunned investors by announcing that its
third-quarter profit would be flat with the 18 cents a share
it earned in the year-earlier third quarter. That news sent
the stock plunging more than 30% in a single session on
recordbreaking volume of nearly 21 million shares. The Nasdaq
Composite Index dropped 2.81 points that day as the selling
spread to other technology stocks.</p>
<p>That wasn't the case yesterday. Second on the active list
was disk-drive maker Conner Peripherals, which gained 1 to 27
3/4 on volume of more than 4.5 million shares. Late
yesterday, Conner priced a 6.4 million-share secondary
offering at $26.75 a share. Also on the active list, Intel
rose 1 3/4 to 48, and Tandon rose 11/16 to 3 13/16. Microsoft
gained 1 3/4 to 75 1/2.</p>
<p>Analysts expressed frustration over Oracle's reluctance to
be more conservative in its forecasts but were quick to point
out that the problems weren't fundamental.</p>
<p>Chip Morris, a vice president and hightechnology analyst
at T. Rowe Price Associates, said his firm was a buyer of
Oracle shares yesterday.</p>
<p>"They've won the open systems database game" and are now
the dominant player in the field, Mr. Morris said. "Oracle's
going to be one of the horses you'll want to ride in the
1990s."</p>
<p>Oracle is one of the largest holdings in T. Rowe Price's
$1 billion New Horizons Fund as well as in its Science and
Technology Fund, Mr. Morris says.</p>
<p>But Oracle's management has yet to adapt to the slower
growth of a maturing company, analysts say, and continues to
plan expenses according to revenue growth targets that are
too optimisitc.</p>
<p>"Most shareholders would be happy to see Oracle plan
expenses for 35% to 40% revenue growth next year," says Mr.
Morris. "Then, if they grow at 50%, they could pass along the
excess to the shareholders."</p>
<p>Mr. Morris concedes that Oracle didn't become a $1 billion
company in a few short years by being conservative. But, he
says that as a public company, Oracle has an obligation to
shareholders to plan more realistically.</p>
<p>Dean Witter Reynolds and PrudentialBache Securities
yesterday lowered their estimates for the company's earnings
for the year ending in May 1991.</p>
<p>Athletic footwear maker Nike gained 1 7/8 to 89 1/8. The
stock has been climbing since it released a strong earnings
report Monday.</p>
<p>United Banks of Colorado gained 2 1/4 to 22 1/4 after
trading resumed from a halt imposed Tuesday. Norwest is in
talks with the company about a possible business combination.</p>
<p>Oshkosh Truck jumped 2 to 11 3/4. The company said it has
been selected as the producer of the U.S. Army's new
generation of heavy-duty transport truck. The contract, which
Oshkosh expects to sign within 30 days, is worth more than $1
billion, the company said.</p>
