	<p class="article-leader">A second study has confirmed that a Procter & Gamble Co.
drug successfully treated osteoporosis, a bone-weakening
disease that affects about 20 million women, mostly over age
50.
   The latest finding produced compelling evidence that the
drug, marketed as Didronal, can strengthen bones that become
brittle after menopause and can reduce fractures that result
from the condition.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"These are truly exciting results," said Nelson Watts, an
associate professor of medicine at Emory University School of
Medicine. "No other drug has established the level of safety
and effectiveness in treating osteoporosis, one reason why we
believe this drug might even be useful in preventing the
disease."</p>
<p>Dr. Watts was the lead investigator in a multicenter study
that compared Didronal against a placebo drug in 429 women
over two years. In a report published prominently in this
week's New England Journal of Medicine, Dr. Watts and his
colleagues said bone mass in the women's vertebrae increased
by 4.2% and 5.2% in two groups of women who took the drug as
compared to women given an inactive pill.</p>
<p>Moreover, the women treated with Didronal had 50% less
fractures than those who took placebo. Current therapy for
the condition includes the use of the hormones estrogen and
calcitonin, each of which can cause annoying and potentially
troublesome side effects.</p>
<p>Two months ago, another study of 66 women published in the
New England Journal found similar results. Norwich Eaton
Pharmaceuticals, the P&G subsidiary that sells Didronal and
funded the latest study, said it expected to use the data
from the two reports in an application it will file soon with
the Food and Drug Administration to market the drug to
doctors as a treatment for osteoporosis.</p>
<p>Didronal, known under the generic name etidronate, is
currently sold for use in treating a rare bone condition
called Paget's disease. Daily doses of the drug cost about
$2. In both research studies Didronal was administered in a
cyclical therapy in which patients took the drug for 14 days
out of every three months.</p>
<p>The second study's positive finding is expected to spur
growing enthusiasm among doctors and scientists because
Didronal is one of a class of drugs being developed by
several drug makers. These drugs, called diphosphonates,
appear to work by coating bone cells and preventing loss of
bone tissue.</p>
<p>The drugs also block the action of bone cells, called
osteoclasts, that normally break down bone material in a
natural process called bone remodeling. Women with
osteoporosis are unable to replace the bone material as
quickly as it is broken down.</p>
<p>Merck & Co. has said it is testing a similar drug called
alendronate sodium that it licensed from Istituto Gentili, an
Italian drug company. Other drug companies testing similar
products are Sandoz Pharmaceuticals Corp. and Ciba-Geigy
Corp.</p>
<p>Didronal was patented about 30 years ago as a chemical
thought useful as a detergent. In 1988, Norwich Eaton
received a new patent for the chemical for its use in
treating bone loss. Some analysts project the drug might
generate $500 million in annual sales if approved for the new
use by the FDA.</p>
<p>Dr. Watts of Emory said proving the drug prevented the
onset of osteoporosis would require testing it in thousands
of women over many years, and comparing their rate of
fractures to women who took placebo, an expensive project he
didn't think would be undertaken easily.</p>
<p>In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday,
Procter & Gamble closed at $89.25, up 87.5 cents.</p>
