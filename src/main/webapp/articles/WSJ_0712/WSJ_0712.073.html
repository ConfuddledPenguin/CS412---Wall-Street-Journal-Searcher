	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- The Securities and Exchange Commission said
it would move quickly to impose securities regulations on
banks if they are allowed to advertise trust department
investment funds to compete with mutual funds.
   The SEC said it plans to issue a mandate forcing the banks
to abide by securities laws if they are cleared to advertise
or market the funds, which like mutual funds, pool money into
a single investment vehicle. But even if the SEC took such a
step, agency officials concede that banks would be held to
more lax regulatory standards than mutual funds because the
SEC couldn't apply all its securities laws.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Top officials at the Office of the Comptroller of the
Currency, which issued the plan to allow such advertising,
said a decision on the proposal is at least two months off.
"No final decision has been made," said Frank Maguire, a top
aide at the office.</p>
<p>The comptroller's plan set off a firestorm immediately
after it was proposed in February. While much of the proposal
contains technical changes to banking rules, one measure
would allow banks for the first time to advertise the
performance of their trust accounts.</p>
<p>That brought strong criticism from the $1 trillion mutual
fund industry, which sees banks competing in its
almost-exclusive domain. Yesterday, Matthew Fink, general
counsel for the Investment Company Institute, said the mutual
fund trade group would sue the comptroller's office if the
rule is passed.</p>
<p>Congress is jumping into the act too. Rep. Edward Markey
(D., Mass.), who heads the House telecommunications and
finance subcommittee, said he plans to hold hearings on the
proposal when Congress returns from its summer recess.</p>
<p>Banks have long boasted that their 2,900 investment
trusts, which manage more than $100 billion belonging
primarily to wealthy individuals, on average outperform
mutual funds. They would love to compete with Fidelity
Investments and other mutual fund groups for the huge amount
of profitable investment business they can't now reach.</p>
<p>The comptroller's proposal would appear to open the door.
The agency is simply trying to streamline existing
regulations that allow bank trust funds to be mentioned only
in general terms in advertising, said Deputy Comptroller Dean
Miller. Moreover, SEC rules cover much of the same territory.</p>
<p>But the way the proposal was crafted, the mutual-fund
industry claims, would allow banks to compare performance
numbers with those of mutual funds. That would set the two
head to head, the Investment Company Institute contends.</p>
<p>SEC rules would take some measures to prevent banks from
getting too much of an advantage. For example, the regulator
has made it clear that the banks immediately would be
required to register with the SEC under the Investment
Company Act, which covers mutual funds. "We would like to
make such an interpretive release available to banks prior to
the time that they may take steps that might result in
violation" of securities law, SEC Chairman Richard Breeden
wrote to Comptroller Robert Clarke.</p>
<p>But banks are exempted from some securities statutes, so
the rules would be more lenient. For example, the SEC
wouldn't regulate the sales practices of banks as it now
monitors similar moves by mutual-fund salesmen, said an SEC
spokeswoman. "We couldn't have the hands-on regulatory
control," she said.</p>
<p>Even if the proposal is approved by Mr. Clarke, it's tough
to determine how it might affect the mutual fund industry. "I
don't think anybody at the SEC has been able to sit down and
figure out who might win out from a competitive point of
view," said Kathryn McGrath, who until recently headed the
SEC's investment management division.</p>
<p>Still, "it may shift the competitive advantage somewhat in
trying to attract pension plan money," said Ms. McGrath, who
is now with the law firm Morgan Lewis & Bockius. "That could
make life tougher competitively for mutual funds that go
after that end of the market."</p>
<p>But banking industry officials argue that the whole issue
is overblown. "It's been blown way out of proportion," said
James McLaughlin, the American Banking Association's director
of trust and securities. "It doesn't mean the comptroller
would allow banks to go willy nilly to run around and sell
these funds."</p>
<p>He said the comptroller may decide to hold back the
controversial advertising measure and move the other
technical provisions along.</p>
