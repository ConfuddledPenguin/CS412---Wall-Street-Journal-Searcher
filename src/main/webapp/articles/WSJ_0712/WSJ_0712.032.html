	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Copper futures prices rose sharply after large
purchases of the metal in London and continued reports of
production problems.
   The July contract, whose last trading day is July 27, rose
5.75 cents a pound to $1.2435, while the most-active
September contract was up 5.25 cents to $1.22.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>There was active Japanese and German buying of copper in
London yesterday as well as German purchases of futures
contracts that had recently been sold short, analysts and
trade sources said.</p>
<p>German buying of futures contracts in London was
associated with a rumor that a major German metals company
was covering its positions in connection with a failed
attempt to buy the Cananea copper mine in Mexico, analysts
said.</p>
<p>According to the unconfirmed reports, the German company
sold copper contracts to lock in prices in case of a market
decline after it bought the Mexican mine. But the company's
bid was rejected by Mexican officials, and so it repurchased
its futures contracts, helping the copper price to rise,
analysts and trade sources said.</p>
<p>The Mexican government took over the Compania Minera
Cananea last August, declared it bankrupt and fired its
workers just before they were to begin a strike. Cananea
produces about 140,000 tons of refined copper annually and is
Mexico's largest copper producer.</p>
<p>The Mexican government has been trying to sell the mine,
which returned to production under government control in
November. According to one analyst, the mine has encountered
some production problems and is functioning at about 90% of
capacity.</p>
<p>Late in the day, there was a report that workers at Minero
Peru, which accounts for about 75% of Peru's copper
production, had voted to strike Monday. Peru is the world's
sixth-largest copper producer.</p>
<p>Analyst Richard Hirsch of Sharps Pixley Inc., New York,
noted that the big Bougainville copper mine in Papua New
Guinea remains out of operation. Workers for Asarco Inc., a
major U.S. producer, have been on strike for almost two
weeks, "and now it appears that Peru is about to be hit with
a strike. There are labor problems in Zambia as well and a
recent cave-in in a Chilean mine," he added.</p>
<p>Coupled with those production problems, he said, has been
added demand. "Japan needs copper, and so does Germany,
because the economies of both countries are stronger than had
been expected," Mr. Hirsch said.</p>
<p>Another analyst observed that while American demand for
copper has softened, demand world-wide has remained strong.
The market is also strong technically, he said, and this has
brought in computer-led funds whose buying has been a major
support for futures prices.</p>
<p>In other markets yesterday:</p>
<p>GRAINS and SOYBEANS: Good weather and a forecast of more
of the same forced grain futures prices lower in a
continuation of last week's price slide. Though farmers were
late planting corn and soybeans this year, analysts said
fears that the crop would be severely affected aren't
materializing. "The crop may be tight, it may be low, but
it's not going to be a disaster, and that's why we have a
price break," said Mickey Luth, analyst for Shearson Lehman
Hutton Inc. in Chicago. Prices of corn, soybean and wheat
futures declined. Analysts said extremely low demand also is
a factor. "The demand for wheat is abysmal," said Katharina
Zimmer, analyst for Merrill Lynch in New York. "The Soviets
are not expected to be in the market for another month or
two, the Chinese have bought what they need, and the
Egyptians have no money." A government crop report on wheat
is due today, and analysts said the wheat market may be
volatile in anticipation of the report.</p>
<p>PRECIOUS METALS: Futures prices for gold and platinum
declined, while those for silver were slightly higher. August
delivery gold was off $1.50 an ounce at $355.60. October
platinum declined $7.60 an ounce to $481.30. September silver
was up 2.2 cents an ounce to $4.8970. According to one
analyst, the most significant development in gold was that
the price didn't continue to drop sharply following Tuesday's
declines, which were prompted by Middle Eastern selling of
the metal. Gold currently is a narrowly traded market because
there isn't any real incentive for traders to buy or sell
aggressively. Not only is there concern about further Middle
Eastern selling, but producers are poised to sell on any
rally, the analyst said. As for silver, he said, the price is
relatively very low, prompting little interest in selling the
metal. At the same time, there's no real demand for it
either, he said.</p>
<p>COFFEE: Futures prices fell back from early advances and
ended lower. The September contract was off 0.50 cent at 88
cents a pound. Initial demand for contracts was prompted by
reports that a Colombian coffee official made an unexpected
visit to Brazil, which gave rise to speculation that
discussions on restoring global export quotas might be
renewed, said Judith Ganes, an analyst for Merrill Lynch. The
quotas were suspended a year ago. Brazil recently called for
a meeting of the member nations of the International Coffee
Agreement, which will be held July 23, the analyst noted.
"When the visit of the Colombian official was reported,
traders apparently felt that there might be more substance to
the speculation of reviving quotas," she said. However, Ms.
Ganes noted that the new Brazilian administration has been
moving more toward a free market, and it didn't seem in
character that it would press for coffee export quotas. "The
larger Brazilian exporters not only don't want export quotas,
they'd like to see the whole International Coffee Agreement
abolished," Ms. Ganes said. "Smaller exporters, however,
would like to see them restored because they have been hurt
by the plunge in prices that followed the suspension of
quotas."</p>
