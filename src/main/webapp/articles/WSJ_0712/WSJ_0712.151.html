	<p class="article-leader">Centaur Partners Group, New York, said it has filed a
lawsuit against National Intergroup Inc.'s directors for
adopting an amendment to the company's shareholder rights
plan.
   Centaur Partners, which owns 16.5% of National Intergroup,
is waging a proxy fight against the Pittsburgh oil
transportation and aluminum and steel fabrication concern.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The lawsuit, filed in New York state court, seeks
compensatory and punitive damages from the directors. The
amendment provides that National Intergroup's "poison pill"
would take effect if any single shareholder acquired more
than 10% of its common stock.</p>
<p>The poison pill previously took effect only after a
shareholder acquired 20% or more of the company.</p>
<p>Last week, the Delaware Chancery Court ruled that the
amendment wasn't valid because it was adopted without
shareholder approval. National Intergroup has said it would
appeal the court's ruling.</p>
<p>National Intergroup called the lawsuit without basis and
said it would "seek sanctions" against Centaur Partners
because of the "frivolous nature of the action."</p>
<p>The company said the amendment was necessary to protect
shareholders from Centaur's attempt to acquire control of the
company without paying a premium for control.</p>
