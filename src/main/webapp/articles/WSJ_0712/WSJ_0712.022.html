	<p class="article-leader">THOMSON CSF, a French manufacturer of military equipment,
was selected by the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization
Service to provide the technological system for producing a
new generation of "green cards" for resident immigrants in
the U.S. The cards themselves will continue to be made in
Arlington, Texas. Thursday's edition incorrectly said the
cards would be made in France.

<p>SPAIN: EUROPE'S DRUG GATEWAY</p>
<p>Spain tops a list of European drug seizures in 1989.</p>
<p>Of the 171 tons of heroin, hashish and cocaine captured in
16 European nations last year, 39% was found in Spain,
according to a Spanish government report. The nation's
seizures accounted for 40% of all hashish taken in Europe,
32% of all cocaine and 15% of all heroin.</p>
<p>The figures underscore the claims of international
drug-enforcement specialists that Spain is the main gateway
for cocaine entering Europe from Latin America; for heroin
from the Middle East, mainly Turkey; and for hashish from
North Africa, mainly Morocco.</p>
<p>In the nations studied, heroin seizures rose 52% to 1,569
pounds last year from 1,034 pounds in 1988, the report said.</p>
<p>HIGH-SPEED TRAIN FOR SOVIETS</p>
<p>Japan's HSST Corp. has agreed in principle to sell the
Soviet Union technology for high-speed trains that float on a
magnetic cushion rather than run on wheels. The trains would
be used on a 20-mile line between central Moscow and
Sheremetyevo International Airport, said an official of HSST.
The memorandum calls for construction of the new rail system
to start next year and be completed by 1996, with costs
estimated at 90 billion yen ($607 million). HSST's trains can
move faster than 185 miles an hour.</p>
<p>A TURKEY IN LONDON</p>
<p>"Bernadette," a musical about the French peasant girl from
Lourdes who became a Roman Catholic saint, will close
Saturday, less than a month after it opened to scathing
reviews. The $2.25 million production, which was blessed by
Pope John Paul II, was dubbed "The People's Musical" after
its producer, William Fonfe, asked the general public to buy
shares in the enterprise. "I am very sad," Mr. Fonfe said.
"We had over 100 people on the payroll and they are going to
lose their jobs. We also have 2,000 investors who are
disappointed."</p>
<p>EAST GERMAN INVESTIGATION</p>
<p>East German authorities have frozen a total of 56 bank
accounts that contained combined holdings of as much as 100
million marks ($61 million), a government spokesman said. The
accounts belong to 26 private persons and the holders are
suspected of attempted manipulation in conjunction with
monetary union with West Germany, the spokesman said. There
are at least 100,000 marks in each of the accounts, he said,
adding that there is a suspicion that the money was obtained
illegally.</p>
<p>MEXICAN FINANCIER RELEASED</p>
<p>Eduardo Legorreta Chauvet, the Mexican financier who was
arrested last year on stock-fraud charges, was released on
bail late Tuesday after 16 months in jail. The release
followed a district judge's decision to drop charges of fraud
and falsification of documents against Mr. Legorreta,
formerly president of the Operadora de Bolsa investment
house. The judge found Mr. Legorreta guilty of a lesser
stock-law violation and sentenced him to a three-year jail
term; that sentence was commuted for time already served and
future community service. Bail was imposed to ensure that
service.</p>
<p>EXPERIMENTAL JAPANESE SHIP</p>
<p>Japanese shipbuilders christened the world's first ship
that will use superconductivity to move through water. The
185-ton Yamato No. 1 is dry-docked in the Kobe shipyard of
Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, Japan's largest shipbuilder and
a member of a consortium developing the ship's new
technology. The ship's developers said they view the vessel,
which will use electromagnetic force instead of a
conventional screw propeller, as a prototype for high-speed
seacraft. The main purpose of their project, however, was to
demonstrate that superconductivity could be used to power a
ship, they said.</p>
<p>WATERFORD STRIKE ENDS</p>
<p>Workers at Ireland's Waterford Crystal glassworks ended a
14-week strike yesterday after agreeing on cost-cutting
proposals with management.</p>
<p>The strike by 2,300 workers at Waterford's three plants
began over cost cuts, including the scrapping of bonuses for
500 glass cutters. Paddy Byrne, chief executive of the
crystal firm's parent company Waterford Wedgwood PLC,
welcomed the agreement but said: "It must be recognized that
we still have a long way to go in order to transform
Waterford Crystal into a robust and profitable part of the
Waterford Wedgwood group. Until this is achieved, the future
of the crystal division will not be secure."</p>
<p>The company said unions and management agreed to refer
issues still in dispute to binding arbitration.</p>
<p>Waterford has lost $64.2 million over the past three
years. Irish politicians had feared it might move production
of its crystalware to Czechoslovakia or East Germany if the
strike continued.</p>
<p>POSTSCRIPTS . . .</p>
<p>Israeli legislator Yehoshua Matza invited a group of belly
dancers and legal and rabbinical officials to Parliament to
discuss a Supreme Court decision forbidding rabbis from
withholding kosher-food certificates from establishments that
allow belly dancers to perform. The rabbis say belly dancing
is provocative, but the dancers reject the claim as religious
intolerance. . . . The next generation of "green cards" --
the resident permits issued to aliens living in the U.S. --
will be made in France by Thomson-CSF.</p>
