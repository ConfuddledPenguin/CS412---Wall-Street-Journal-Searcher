	<p class="article-leader">Taylor Devices Inc., North Tonawanda, N.Y., said that for
the year ended May 31, it expects to post net income of about
$320,000, or 13 cents a share, up sharply from fiscal 1989
profit of $42,400, or two cents a share.
   Taylor, which makes shock absorbers and other products,
said sales totaled $4.8 million, off an indicated 7.7% from
$5.2 million a year earlier. Officials said earnings
increased, despite the drop in sales, because of higher
profit margins on its shock absorber business and higher
engineering research fees, among other things.</p>
