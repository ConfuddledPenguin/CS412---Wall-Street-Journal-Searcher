	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- A feud between Wall Street and the government
exploded yesterday, as a few big bond dealers deluged the
Treasury Department with what amounted to bogus bids at
yesterday's auction of seven-year U.S. notes.
   The result: The government received a huge $47 billion in
bids for only $8 billion of notes. The number of bids was
more than double the $19.44 billion of tenders received at
the previous seven-year note auction in April.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>In flooding the Treasury with bids dealers knew couldn't
be fulfilled, analysts said, one or more of the biggest bond
dealers were retaliating for a last-minute change in bidding
rules by the Treasury. The rule change, announced just hours
before yesterday's auction, limited the maximum bid by any
one dealer at any one price to 35% of the size of the
government auction. (Dealers can, however, place multiple
bids at different prices.)</p>
<p>The Treasury said the 35% limit was aimed at preventing
big dealers from "squeezing" out their smaller rivals at
government auctions. That has been a problem, off and on, in
Treasury bond auctions for years.</p>
<p>But, "one or two dealers were aggravated at the Treasury's
rule, and they put in a large number of bids out of spite to
distort the auction results," said one person with knowledge
of the Treasury auction. Practically, the huge bids had
little effect on the price the Treasury paid to sell the $8
billion of notes, traders said.</p>
<p>Analysts said the surge in bids for the seven-year notes
wasn't a signal that investors were rushing to buy the notes
believing that interest rates are headed lower. Indeed, bond
prices fell and yields rose shortly after the auction's 1
p.m. EDT bidding deadline.</p>
<p>Defending the decision to change the Treasury's bidding
rules, Michael Basham, deputy assistant Treasury secretary of
federal finance, said, "We want to maintain the competitive
nature of the auction process for the taxpayer as well as the
investment community."</p>
<p>The Treasury auctions billions of dollars of government
securities each week to fund government spending and the
federal debt. For Wall Street, the auctions are a high-stakes
game; bond dealers don't hesitate to play hardball as they
compete to buy government securities and later resell them.</p>
<p>Traders charge that on June 27, Salomon Brothers Inc., one
of Wall Street's biggest and most aggressive firms, tried to
effectively "corner" the auction for new four-year U.S.
notes. It allegedly did this by bidding for more than 10
times the amount of bonds it could reasonably expect to be
awarded under then-existing Treasury rules.</p>
<p>Bids at that auction totaled $44.78 billion for $8.31
billion of notes, the highest ever at a four-year auction.</p>
<p>In order to prevent one firm from cornering the market on
a new Treasury bill, note or bond issue, the Treasury has a
longtime rule limiting any dealer from purchasing more than
35% of the securities sold at an auction. Typically, the
government receives far more bids for bonds than it accepts,
and it rations them among dealers.</p>
<p>A dealer, by bidding far in excess of the 35% limit, can
make it possible for himself to be awarded a relatively large
amount of bonds, while other dealers that are also rationed
end up with smaller amounts than they need.</p>
<p>Traders allege that Salomon repeated the tactic,
submitting a huge bid at Tuesday's $5 billion sale of
Resolution Funding Corp. bonds sale, and that the Treasury
rejected all or most of that bid. That's when the Treasury
decided to change its bidding rules. The Treasury has the
right to reject bids submitted at its auctions.</p>
<p>The Treasury's Mr. Basham wouldn't comment on whether
there had been abuses in the bidding process at the Refcorp
sale or any recent Treasury auctions. However, bids at the
Refcorp sale totaled $15.48 billion, well above the $5
billion of bonds sold.</p>
<p>Paul Mozer, a managing director in charge of government
bond trading at Salomon Brothers, wouldn't comment on the
Refcorp rumors, but he was highly critical of the change in
auction procedures.</p>
<p>"The Treasury made a rash decision without consulting the
dealer community about this change," Mr. Mozer told Dow Jones
Capital Markets Report.</p>
<p>"Potentially, this ties the hands of the larger dealers,
who, time in and time out, buy the bulk of the debt," Mr.
Mozer said.</p>
<p>He said the same six to eight dealers buy the largest
amount of securities sold at Treasury auctions every year and
are likely to continue to do so.</p>
<p>Mr. Mozer said that curbing the ability of the biggest
bond brokerage firms to take larger positions at auctions
will hamper "our ability to provide liquidity" in the bond
market.</p>
<p>Treasury Securities</p>
<p>Treasury bond prices ended little changed from Tuesday.</p>
<p>At the seven-year auction, the Treasury sold $8 billion of
securities at an average yield of 8.57%. The yield was down
from 8.62% at the previous seven-year note auction April 11.</p>
<p>Here are details of yesterday's auction:</p>
<p>Rates are determined by the difference between the
purchase price and face value. Thus, higher bidding narrows
the investor's return while lower bidding widens it.</p>
<p>Applications ........................... $47,015,398,000</p>
<p>Accepted bids ..........................  $8,000,188,000</p>
<p>Accepted at low price ..................            100%</p>
<p>Accepted noncompetitively ..............    $524,000,000</p>
<p>Average price (Rate) ...................  99.637 (8.57%)</p>
<p>High price (Rate) ......................  99.741 (8.55%)</p>
<p>Low price (Rate) .......................  99.586 (8.58%)</p>
<p>Interest rate ..........................          8 1/2%</p>
<p>The notes are dated July 16 and mature July 15, 1997.</p>
<p>Mortgage-backed Securities</p>
<p>Mortgage securities ended a subdued session with slim
price gains.</p>
<p>Among actively traded secondary issues, Government
National Mortgage Association 9.5% issues, Federal Home Loan
Mortgage Corp. 9.5% issues and Federal National Mortgage
Association 9.5% issues all advanced 3/32, to prices of 99
3/32, 98 3/8 and 98 29/32, respectively.</p>
<p>News that Fannie Mae's earnings in the second quarter were
$1.10 per share, fully diluted, up from 75 cents per share in
the second quarter of 1989 and from $1.06 per share in the
first quarter of 1990 had little impact in the secondary
market for Fannie Mae mortgage securities.</p>
<p>It was Fannie Mae's 10th consecutive quarter of record
earnings.</p>
<p>Corporate, Junk Bonds</p>
<p>Investment-grade corporate bond prices rose slightly
yesterday while junk bonds were 3/8 to 1/2 higher.</p>
<p>Junk bonds issued to supermarket chains were boosted by
news that sales at Safeway Inc. stores open more than a year
were up 4.1% in the latest quarter, traders say.</p>
<p>Safeway Stores Holding Corp.'s 11.75% senior subordinated
notes, due in 1996, ended 1/2 point higher at 102. Kroger
Co.'s 11 1/8% senior notes, maturing in 1998, also rose 1/2
point to trade at 100.</p>
<p>Junk bonds issued to Donald Trump's Atlantic City, N.J.,
casino, Trump Taj Mahal, slipped after a report that the
Trump Organization has begun negotiations with contractors
who claim they are owed $70 million for work on the resort
and hotel development.</p>
<p>Trump Taj Mahal Funding Inc.'s 14% first mortgage bonds,
due in 1998, ended 3/8 point lower at 51 1/2. Traders say
trading in the issues was heavy. Other Trump issues were
generally unaffected by the news.</p>
<p>Among new issues, the first offering of subordinated debt
in the U.S. market by a Japanese bank was warmly received by
investors. Sumitomo Bank International Finance N.V., a unit
of Sumitomo Bank Ltd., offered $500 million of 10-year
subordinated notes at a yield of 9.554%.</p>
<p>Sumitomo is expected to offer an additional $700 million
in floating rate notes in the European market today.</p>
<p>Municipal Bonds</p>
<p>Tax-exempt issues ended 1/8 point higher to 1/4 point
higher.</p>
<p>In the primary market, Phoenix, Arizona, issued $118
million of general-obligation bonds and street and highway
user revenue bonds.</p>
<p>An underwriting group led by J.P. Morgan Securities Inc.
is offering the $72.63 million general-obligation bond
portion of the issue. Those bonds were priced for reoffering
to yield from 5.90% in 1991 to 7.05% in 2014.</p>
<p>Clayton Brown & Associates Inc. is the lead underwriter
for the remainder of the deal, $45 million of street and
highway user revenue bonds. Those bonds were priced to yield
from 6% in 1991 to 7.20% in 2010.</p>
<p>In secondary dealings, the New Jersey Turnpike Authority's
7.20% securities of 2018 ended 1/8 higher at 99 to yield
7.24%.</p>
<p>Foreign Bonds</p>
<p>Japanese government bonds ended firmer on reports that the
Bank of Japan moved in the middle of the afternoon to cap the
incipient rise in short-term interest rates.</p>
<p>The Bank of Japan lent 200 billion yen ($1.35 billion) to
banks near the market's close. The central bank lent 300
billion Tuesday. The central bank intends the successive
rounds of lending to soothe the market's renewed speculation
that the Bank of Japan is going to push up interest rates
further.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, Washington, D.C.-based Smick Medley
International reported that the Bank of Japan is going to
boost its discount rate "in the next several months." Smick
Medley's report stirred Japan's financial markets, which
already had been looking for the Bank of Japan to tighten
sometime after September.</p>
<p>At the 3 p.m. JST close of the Tokyo Stock Exchange the
benchmark 10-year bond was quoted at a price of 86.95, up
0.21, erasing the decline of the previous day. The issue's
yield fell to 7.205%.</p>
<p>(Foreign bond yields are quoted here in local terms and
therefore differ somewhat from yields calculated for these
markets by U.S. investment firms, which tend to use the
semiannual compound measure to compare yields across
markets.)</p>
