	<p class="article-leader">THE SENATE VOTED to approve comprehensive anti-crime
legislation.
   The measure, which passed 94-6, includes a partial ban on
semiautomatic "assault weapons" and numerous provisions aimed
at invigorating the investigation and prosecution of
savings-and-loan fraud. The bill also would expand the
federal death penalty to cover 34 crimes, curb the
constitutional appeals process for death-row inmates, and
provide $900 million in federal assistance to local
law-enforcement agencies in the coming fiscal year -- twice
the expenditure that has been proposed by the Bush
administration.</p>

including a statute providing up to life imprisonment for
highlevel thrift executives who conspire with three or more
other violators and derive over $5 million from their crimes.</p>

<p>Hard-liner Ligachev failed in his bid for a top job in the
Soviet Communist Party, marking a clear victory for Kremlin
leader Gorbachev, who tried but was unable to keep the
staunch conservative off the ballot at a party congress.
Ligachev lost to a Gorbachev-backed candidate, Vladimir
Ivashko, in the race for deputy leader of the party.</p>
<p>Soviet coal miners staged a 24-hour walkout to demand that
the government resign. Hundreds of thousands of miners took
part, and a strike organizer claimed that 300,000 would halt
work in western Siberia alone.</p>

<p>Pro-Sandinista strikers removed barricades from several
streets in Managua after the government of Nicaragua's
President Chamorro indicated a willingness to negotiate an
end to 10 days of often-violent walkouts. Strikers are
demanding a wage boost and want the government to give up
plans to relinquish state-owned firms and farms.</p>

<p>A study is expected to be released today estimating the
amount of radiation emitted from a World War II weapons
plant, the Hanford Nuclear Reservation in Washington state,
in efforts to gauge its effect on health, researchers say.
The five-year study is the first major research into the
plant's release of massive quantities of radiation.</p>
<p>Energy Secretary Watkins said his department will take
more direct control of the contaminated Hanford plant as part
of a plan to clean up problems that exist at the nation's
nuclear weapons facilities.</p>

<p>A subcontractor received backward blueprints for Hubble
Space Telescope parts in 1981 by the telescope's prime
contractor, according to documents obtained by the Associated
Press. Disclosure of the faulty drawings from Perkin-Elmer,
now a GM unit, indicates NASA possibly knew for many years of
problems in Perkin-Elmer's work.</p>

<p>A Quebec police officer was killed in a gun battle with
Mohawk Indians blocking access to a golf course expansion
project in a town west of Montreal. Mohawk leaders also
claimed to have taken another provincial police officer
hostage. The Indians are struggling to prevent their
ancestral land from being used for the town project.</p>

<p>Senate investigators accused Johns Hopkins Hospital in
Baltimore of having shoddy billing practices that apparently
resulted in excessive Medicare payments. The accusation came
at a hearing by a Senate panel that has asserted that
Medicare pays up to $1 billion a year in claims that private
insurance should cover.</p>

<p>Mandela is suffering from a mild case of pneumonia,
according to his doctor, and is resting in Nairobi. The
71-year-old South African black nationalist leader, who has
been on a world tour to raise funds for the African National
Congress, arrived in Kenya from Ethiopia, where he had
attended an Organization of African Unity summit.</p>

<p>Polish farmers blocked hundreds of roads across the
country in a massive protest against government economic
policies. Police said tractors and other farm vehicles
clogged traffic throughout Poland in the two-hour warning
strike. For months, farmers have been demanding that minimum
prices be reinstated for their produce.</p>

<p>A House Appropriations panel approved a $20.7 billion
Treasury and Postal Service spending bill that would increase
IRS funding by 11.5% in fiscal 1991 and mandate stepped-up
tax enforcement against foreignowned U.S. companies. Over
$6.13 billion would be provided for the IRS in the budget
year starting Oct. 1.</p>

<p>The Democratic Party announced that its 1992 national
convention will be held in New York City. The formal
statement by party Chairman Ronald Brown had been expected
and confirmed reports that New York had been chosen over New
Orleans. New York officials believe the convention will pump
some $100 million into the city's economy.</p>

<p>The death toll reached 20 in four days of pro-democracy
protests in Kenya, but armed police reportedly quelled
violence in Nairobi. The nation's fledgling opposition vowed
to keep fighting for change, despite the resistance of
President Moi, who has ruled out ending a one-party system
until Kenya becomes "a cohesive society."</p>
