	<p class="article-leader">GENEVA -- The ruling body of the General Agreement on
Tariffs and Trade (GATT) gave the go-ahead to Venezuela's
membership application yesterday.
   A trade official said that as a condition of joining the
96-nation trade forum, which sponsors agreements to
liberalize world trade, Venezuela had agreed to limit import
tariff levels to 50%, and to reduce them to 40% within two
years.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Venezuela is the first member of the Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) to seek GATT membership.
The country derives 90% of its export income from oil, which
is covered by OPEC's production regulations.</p>
<p>The trade official said GATT's regular council meeting
also heard that agreement had been finalized on the opening
of South Korea's markets to imported beef.</p>
<p>Under the agreement, Seoul has to import at least 58,000
tons of beef this year.</p>
