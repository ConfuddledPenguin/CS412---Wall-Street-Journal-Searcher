	<p class="article-leader">First Executive Corp., in an unusual move, is attempting
to keep secret the details of two influential consultants'
reports that the insurance holding company publicly has
heralded as proof of its underlying financial strength.
   The wounded insurance holding company and its two main
units obtained a temporary restraining order blocking release
of the reports by the New York Department of Insurance. The
department was to turn over the studies to Joseph Belth, the
publisher of a monthly newsletter, "Insurance Forum." Mr.
Belth, a frequent critic of First Executive, had sought them
under a state freedom of information action. The restraining
order was obtained Friday from a state court in New York
City.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Los Angeles-based First Executive argued in its court
filing that the reports contain a wide range of delicate
proprietary information which, if released, "would cause
substantial injury" to its insurance units if competitors
latched on to details of products, pricing and future
strategy.</p>
<p>But First Executive's effort to hide details of studies it
has heralded presents a delicate dilemma for the troubled
company in a worried market: "It looks like they're
stonewalling," said James Ramenda, an analyst at Northington
Partners Inc. in Avon, Conn.</p>
<p>Among other things, First Executive has ballyhooed the
studies to policyholders, investors, and even a committee of
Congress. More importantly, the reports have become a focus
of analysis by state insurance regulators across the country,
who apparently have relied on the projections to conclude
that First Executive's troubled units should be allowed to
continue operations.</p>
<p>The reports, prepared by the Seattle-based actuarial firm
of Milliman & Robertson, were commissioned by First Executive
and its Executive Life Insurance Co., based in Los Angeles,
and Executive Life Insurance Co. of New York units under
orders from California regulators.</p>
<p>The studies assess possible impacts of certain
hypothetical rates of holders turning in policies and
declines in the value of the company's vast junk bond
holdings. Although only two reports have been cited, a
regulator with knowledge of the analysis said yesterday that
nearly a dozen studies have been prepared to date by Milliman
& Robertson, exposing the company's financial structure to
wide range of scenarios.</p>
<p>First Executive has said the reports are good news. "In
our view, these studies illustrate the capital strength and
resiliency of Executive Life Insurance Co. and Executive
Insurance Co. of New York." Fred Carr, chairman and chief
executive officer, wrote shareholders in First Executive's
recently mailed annual report.</p>
<p>In a four-page digest, distributed to policyholders,
investors, and the press in April, First Executive said that,
despite severe adverse hypothetical assumptions, the studies
found that Executive Life Insurance Co.'s book value would
actually rise from the $936 million reported for the end of
1989 to at least $1.01 billion by the end of 1994 and could
go as high as $2.13 billion at the end of that period under
the range of assumptions.</p>
<p>Despite this apparent good news, First Executive in its
court filing argued that to go beyond the digest version
would disclose a wide range of propriety information,
including pricing assumptions, commission structure,
investment strategy, and crediting of interest-rate costs.</p>
<p>Mr. Belth, echoing skepticism about the report by some
within the industry, said, "I think it's only reasonable that
people be allowed to scrutinize a study that First Executive
asserts proves its financial soundness."</p>
<p>Mr. Belth's lawyer, David C. Vladeck, of the
Washington-based Public Citizen Litigation Group, said Mr.
Belth will oppose First Executive's request for a permanent
injunction barring release of the reports. A hearing is
scheduled for Tuesday. Mr. Vladeck said First Executive's use
of the report to assert financial viability on one hand while
on the other declining to release its full contents "amounts
to a sophisticated game of hide-the-ball."</p>
<p>Copies of the reports also are being sought by a
congressional committee. In testimony last month, First
Executive's chairman, Mr. Carr, told the House Subcommittee
on Oversight and Investigation the reports were favorable to
the company and promised that a copy would be provided for
the committee record -- indicating public disclosure. John B.
Chesson, counsel to the subcommittee, said yesterday that,
despite "pursuing it with all due vigor," the committee has
yet to receive a copy of the reports.</p>
<p>A spokesman for First Executive said the company would
provide a copy to the subcommittee, but only on a
confidential basis.</p>
