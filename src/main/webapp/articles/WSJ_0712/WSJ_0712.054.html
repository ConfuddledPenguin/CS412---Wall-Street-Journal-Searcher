	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Fred R. Bleakley resigned as editor of
American Banker, a daily newspaper owned by Thomson
Publishing Corp.
   Mr. Bleakley, a former deputy business editor of the New
York Times, said he resigned because of a disagreement with
George W. Landgrebe, president of American Banker, who had
hired Mr. Bleakley. "George and I couldn't reach agreement on
my proposal to report directly to him," Mr. Bleakley said. "I
wasn't comfortable with other executives getting involved."</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Mr. Bleakley had been editor since April 1989, when he was
hired to thoroughly redesign the paper.</p>
<p>A successor to Mr. Bleakley wasn't named and executives of
Thomson Publishing couldn't be reached for comment.</p>
