	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- Congress is spending so much energy on the
NEA squabble this season that it is failing to plug an arts
drain gurgling right here by the Potomac. The sum at issue in
the noisy NEA debate is $170 million. Meantime, a smaller but
significant flood of federal dollars -- $45 million -- seems
set to pass with little audible protest. The recipient: this
city's Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts.
   The funding of Robert Mapplethorpe's homoerotica might not
seem to fall into the same category as the red-carpet sort of
arts activities -- symphony performances, inaugural balls --
that go on at Kennedy Center. But the National Endowment for
the Arts and the Kennedy Center are part of the same issue:
Does government owe the arts? To this question, the Kennedy
Center brings a second: Should government pay to make
Washington an arts capital?</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>To judge by some action behind doors here, Washington
thinks the answers are "yes." When Congress first created the
arts center as a "living memorial" to John F. Kennedy 25
years ago, it created an entity that today collects some $6
million in federal money annually. According to the center's
new chairman, James Wolfensohn, that amount is not enough.
"Bankrupt" was the first term he used to describe the
center's financial status when he took office this spring.
Before he even took his title, he collected promises from
congressmen and the White House for a onetime $45 million
rescue to pay off old debts and fix up the plant. Since he's
been chairman, he's busied himself sweet-talking
congressional committees in the name of deepening the
connection between government and the arts and making the
Kennedy Center into a national institution.</p>
<p>Mr. Wolfensohn, of course, can't be blamed for a mess he
inherited. And it is hard to fault him for cutting a deal
before taking a job -- it shows the same kind of tactical
talent he displays in his main career, as a world-class
adviser to investors in New York. It's true, too, that the
Kennedy Center is in need of repair: Since architect Edward
Durrell Stone's large Kleenex box of a structure opened in
1971, more than 66 million visitors have worn down its six
stages. Its garage needs a $15 million fix-up. The humid air
of Foggy Bottom has warped its white Carrara marble walls.
Sculptor Robert Berks's oversized, unflattering bust of John
F. Kennedy -- modeled in dotted clay that gives the president
a far worse complexion than he ever suffered from in real
life -- might also be a candidate for replacement.</p>
<p>Wolfensohn and Co. have a new arts agenda they hope will
put the Kennedy Center in the black -- and that, in future,
private funding will pay for all programming. For decades the
center's six theaters have featured a mishmash of programs --
some to packed audiences, some, like director Peter Sellars's
experimental projects, poorly attended. Packaging is the
Wolfensohn answer to this scattershot approach. A Texas
Festival is scheduled for next June, and the center is at
work planning a mega-festival in 1992 to honor Christopher
Columbus's discovery 500 years before.</p>
<p>Four million Americans now converge on the Kennedy Center
each year. Mr. Wolfensohn wants to draw even more. He's also
setting up a new television project to broadcast Kennedy
Center performances nationally, creating a "seventh stage"
that would bring arts treasures to citizen homes.</p>
<p>Under the Wolfensohn plan, though, this White (House)
Elephant may only grow larger. Some of the new-style projects
sound exciting, but they are contingent on an old-style
bailout. The Kennedy Center explains its troubles by pointing
out that the Center is a presidential monument -- and as such
is a legitimate recipient of federal monies. Much of the
fix-up money will go to the repair of that monument, whose
annual maintenance already costs more than that of the more
modest Lincoln Memorial, Washington Monument, Thomas
Jefferson Memorial and Vietnam Veterans Memorial combined.</p>
<p>What, though, is wrong with going to citizens now for
private gifts for the fixup? Back in the early 1960s,
Washington felt government ought to help fund the culture
that would yield a more habitable town. If the argument was
suspect then, today it borders on ridiculous. This is the
city of the Beltway, the city that these days is advancing on
New York as the nation's culture capital. It is the capital
that now sustains a nine-screen cinema, an Ann Taylor, and a
pack of eateries in formerly grimy Union Station. Surely, its
citizens have pockets deep enough to subsidize a major arts
center through charity.</p>
<p>The problem is in part one of sheer civic selfishness.
When other American towns have experienced booms like
Washington's they've built privately funded monuments to
public pride and responsibility. Parents from Bethesda may be
dragging their youngsters to Kennedy Center performances of
the National Symphony Orchestra, and White House staffers
certainly enjoy the perk of access to the White House's
Kennedy Center box. But when it comes to funding their
entertainment, these folks go where Washingtonians have
always gone: Capitol Hill.</p>
<p>A glance at the balance sheet of another "presidential"
culture venue, New York City's Lincoln Center, provides a
damaging comparison. In some senses, the finances of the two
centers are similar. Putting aside Mr. Wolfensohn's $45
million request for the Kennedy Center and money that goes to
the upkeep of the Kennedy Center "as monument," government's
(including state and local government money in the case of
Lincoln Center) contribution to both centers is about 3% of
their budgets. The difference is that Lincoln Center receives
about $69 million a year in gifts from corporations,
foundations, members and individuals. These days, the Kennedy
Center gets about $14 million.</p>
<p>Other models too exist for the Kennedy Center to copy. One
of them is New York's Carnegie Hall, whose admirable chairman
is Mr. Wolfensohn himself. Carnegie Hall does avail itself of
some government services -- the city of New York, for
example, is kind enough to cart away its garbage. But Mr.
Wolfensohn has kept Carnegie Hall out of deficit. That's
probably a good thing too, given New York's restrictions on
public spending and Mayor David Dinkins's obsession with
balancing the budget. Unlike Congress, the New York mayor
knows what he can't afford to fund.</p>
<p>Beyond the balance-sheet questions here lies a deeper
issue: the role of a capital in a free country. Centralizing
culture at the taxpayers' cost is a fine tradition. Kings in
old Europe did it regularly, and produced many of the world's
most pleasurable cities -- witness Paris, or London, or Mr.
Wolfensohn's own example, Moscow. But the tradition is not
really an American one -- Americans like their culture
supplied where it grows, in small towns and cities.</p>
<p>Seen in this light, the Kennedy Center is a more dubious
candidate for funding than even the much-beleaguered NEA
grantees. When NEA money goes to, say, the Dallas Opera, the
Walker Art Center in Minneapolis or Chicago's Lyric Opera,
that money is going to true grass-roots projects, however
iffy the taste of some of those projects might be.
Nevertheless, NEA funding is likely to be the subject of more
windy battles in coming weeks, while the Kennedy Center --
tied in the same bit of legislation -- should pass without
comment.</p>
<p>There are those, of course, who argue that the Kennedy
Center with all its troubles is an appropriate reminder of
the arrogant Kennedy era. The president lobbied the city for
a national culture center, and the Kennedy Center is a
living, tax-eating example of the costs of that kind of
commitment. You don't have to love John Kennedy, though, to
wish him a different sort of memorial. Take away Robert
Berks's pock-faced statue, and let Foggy Bottom's Kleenex box
earn its own keep. Then, it might conform to more citizens'
vision of an American Camelot.</p>
