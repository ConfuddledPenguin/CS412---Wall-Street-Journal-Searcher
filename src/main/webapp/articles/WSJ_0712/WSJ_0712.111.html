	<p class="article-leader">SASKATOON, Saskatchewan -- Potash Corp. of Saskatchewan
said it sold about 50 million Canadian dollars (US$43.2
million) of warrants to a group of Toronto-based securities
dealers.
   Potash said proceeds will be used to pay for its C$50
million acquisition of Saskterra Fertilizers Ltd. from
Calgary, Alberta-based Husky Oil Ltd. Saskterra's main asset
is a 40% stake in Saskatchewan's Allan potash mine, of which
Potash owns 60%.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Under the issue, Potash said it sold about 3,670,000
special warrants at C$13.625 each to an underwriting group
that includes Wood Gundy Inc., RBC Dominion Securities Inc.
and Nesbitt Thomson Deacon Ltd. Each warrant entitles the
holder to acquire one Potash common share, subject to certain
terms and conditions. Potash has about 35 million common
shares outstanding.</p>
<p>Saskterra and Husky Oil are affiliates of Calgary-based
Nova Corp. of Alberta, a big pipeline, oil and gas, and
petrochemical concern.</p>
<p>In Toronto Stock Exchange trading yesterday, Potash shares
closed at C$14, down 50 Canadian cents.</p>
