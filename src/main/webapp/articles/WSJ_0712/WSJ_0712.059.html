	<p class="article-leader">SAN JOSE, Calif. -- The semiconductor industry's leading
indicator dropped in June, reflecting seasonal factors and a
surge of orders earlier in the year that skewed June's index.
   The Semiconductor Industry Association's so-called
book-to-bill ratio for June fell to 1.06-to-1 from 1.14-to-1
in May. Both figures are preliminary. A book-to-bill rate of
1.06 means that for every $100 in products shipped, makers
received $106 in new orders.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The lower index shows that "we're headed for a normal
reasonable summer, not any kind of recession," said analyst
Erik Jansen of Robertson Stephens & Co. Orders typically fall
in mid-June, he said. And a rash of memory-chip orders in
March translated into deliveries in June that drove the index
down because of lower bookings in the month, he said.</p>
<p>The industry association late last year forecast a year of
no growth or slightly negative growth and June's index is
"right on target," said an association official.</p>
<p>June billings were $1.30 billion, 5% lower than the $1.36
billion posted in June 1989. Average monthly bookings for the
three-month period ending in June were $1.27 billion, 1.3%
higher than the year-earlier average bookings of $1.25
billion.</p>
