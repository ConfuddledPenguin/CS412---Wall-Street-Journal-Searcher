	<p class="article-leader">Just three years from now, Mick Jagger will be 50, making
the rock star an eligible subject for the one magazine whose
cover he probably never expected to appear on: Modern
Maturity.
   As unlikely as that prospect may seem, it points up the
biggest miscalculation made by a raft of new magazines aimed
at the so-called mature market, ad industry jargon for people
over 50. The Rolling Stones and their generation may be
hitting the half-century mark, but that doesn't mean they are
ready to start reading magazines that remind them of it.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Advertising Age magazine picked mature-market magazines
one of 10 top "categories to watch" in 1989. But after
several new entries stalled and some failed outright, the
prospects don't look bright for national magazines that
target older readers, particularly with the current
industrywide advertising slump. Moxie, a magazine for older
working women, was shelved just last week.</p>
<p>There are success stories in the category, in particular
Modern Maturity, but its success is in part due to an unusual
subscription system that keeps circulation high.</p>
<p>"The jury is out on whether we need magazines for the
mature market" at all, says Ken Dychtwald of Age Wave Inc.,
who has worked as a consultant to publishers.</p>
<p>The demographics that first drew many publishers to the
category remain enticing. According to research from Age Wave
and major advertising agencies, people over 50 account for
26% of the population and will reach about 30% by the year
2000. The age group controls about 50% of U.S. discretionary
income and 77% of U.S. household financial assets. The group
will grow three times faster than the under-50 market through
the turn of the century, and will be the best educated and
most affluent generation in the country's history.</p>
<p>Rather than abandon such a potentially lucrative market
altogether, publishers are rethinking their strategies for
tapping into it. There is no agreement on a sure-fire formula
for mature-market magazines, but two rules apply: keep the
editorial matter upbeat and never ever refer to age in the
title. There's good reason why magazine titles such as
"Grandparents" and "50 Plus" have been put to rest.</p>
<p>Weider Health & Fitness Corp.'s Moxie was shut down even
though it had met performance forecasts. Moxie, which
targeted older working women, was closed last week after only
10 months. The magazine was ahead of budget on advertising
pages, but Michael Carr, Weider executive vice president,
says it "strayed" from the company's focus of health and
fitness.</p>
<p>Weider, publisher of Shape, Flex, and Men's Fitness, says
it will relaunch Moxie in six months with a focus on health
and fitness. The mature market is "still a great market with
lots of possibilities," Mr. Carr says.</p>
<p>"Most of us look in the mirror and see someone 15 years
younger than our calendar years," said Richard Fontana,
publisher of Reader's Digest Association Inc.'s New Choices
magazine. "That's why this group needs to be sold more
aggressively then any group in the country today."</p>
<p>So far, Reader's Digest is the largest group publisher to
step into the field with its acquisition of 50 Plus magazine
in 1988. Reader's Digest revamped the magazine and renamed it
New Choices. Circulation has grown to 600,000, an increase of
16.6% in 1989, but advertising pages are expected to be flat
this year.</p>
<p>According to a 1990 Mediamark Research Inc. study,
magazines aimed at mature readers don't even make their lists
of priority reading. In the 55- to 59-year-old age range, for
example, computer magazines were the most often read,
followed by automotive, metropolitan/entertainment, science,
and men's categories. The 60- to 64-year-olds preferred
boating magazines, followed by women's fashions, crafts, and
airline magazines.</p>
<p>One publisher, Family Media Inc., hopes it has found a
mature-market magazine that will make it onto the
reading-priority list by appealing to older readers
interested in health and science. This month, it launched
Breakthroughs in Health and Science, a revamping of the
defunct Science Digest.</p>
<p>"People buy magazines that feed their interests rather
than to feed an age interest," says James A. Autry, magazine
group president of Meredith Corp. "We've done our research
and it doesn't lead to the compelling conclusion that we
should start our own magazine just for that group." The Des
Moines, Iowa, media company shut down Grandparents after just
a year, but now publishes Mature Outlook magazine for Sears,
Roebuck & Co. as part of a discount club.</p>
<p>Mature-market magazines have been stymied by a seeming
lack of interest by advertisers and a dearth of new products
meant for an older audience. Manufacturers and national
advertisers still largely focus on young families, or
consumers in the 24- to 45-year-old range. "For now, the
marketing money is concentrated on the young households,"
says Beth Rockwood, media group planning director, Young &
Rubicam. "There is lots of talk about the mature market as a
niche, but not a lot being done."</p>
<p>Over the past few years, Second Wind (for older couples)
was stranded by investors after a single issue. Renaissance
(for "preferred" bank customers) and Lifewise (a health
magazine) never made it past the prototype stage.</p>
<p>Even Lear's, the brainchild of Frances Lear, who pioneered
magazines for older women, is facing some trouble. After a
fast start in 1988, Ms. Lear in early June laid off 25
editorial staffers, and said, through a spokesman, that she
is looking for partners for her magazine company.</p>
<p>With ad pages projected as flat for the year, the magazine
that once proudly billed itself "for the woman who wasn't
born yesterday" has revised its focus from women over 40 to
women over 35, reasoning that "the women seeking change are
now younger than before," according to Ms. Lear. To boost
newsstand sales, Lear's is redesigning its covers to feature
celebrities, such as Carol Burnett and Anne Bancroft.</p>
<p>The heavyweight of the mature-market magazine field is
Modern Maturity, published by the American Association of
Retired Persons. With a paid circulation of 21.4 million, it
is the leading paid-circulation magazine in the country. But
the nonprofit AARP charges a mere $2.40 annual subscription
rate as part of its membership package, almost guaranteeing a
mammoth circulation.</p>
<p>Modern Maturity has set the tone for virtually all
mature-market magazines. Its personality profiles and
features are relentlessly upbeat. It doesn't shy away from
dealing with the issues of age, but virtually all subjects
are portrayed as active, optimistic, and energetic. A recent
story on volunteers: "Everyday heroes; they're helping
reshape America."</p>
<p>"We don't `down' anybody," says Robert E. Wood, publishing
director of Modern Maturity. The magazine turns away ads that
have "a downer attitude," says Mr. Wood: an ad for a pain
reliever that shows someone wincing in pain, for example, or
those for wheelchairs and crutches. Mr. Wood says that, were
the magazine to accept all these ads, revenue could increase
by a third.</p>
<p>At least one other publication in the field, Golden Years,
also benefits from an unusual subscription system. Once a
small giveaway magazine for Florida's Brevard County, Golden
Years has expanded to national distribution. Published by
Golden Years Senior News Inc., Golden Years' circulation has
reached 450,000, of which 310,000 copies are paid
subscriptions. About 100,000 are "qualified requested,"
(targeted readers who have asked to receive the magazine but
don't pay for it). Another 40,000 copies go to waiting rooms
at doctors' offices.</p>
<p>Some publishers are simply sitting out the senior
sweepstakes, relying on existing publications to draw an
ever-aging readership. At Time Warner Inc.'s magazine group,
for example, the average reader of In Health (a spinoff of
Hippocrates magazine) is 46.6 years old, while the average
ages of readers of Cooking Light, Sunset and Southern Living,
are all around 45.</p>
<p>"There won't be one big magazine for this group," says S.
Christopher Meigher III, executive vice president of Time
Inc. Magazines. "There is fragmentation, and the biggest
mistake would be to treat their interests as being the same."</p>
<p>But the day when marketers pay closer attention to the
older consumer is simply inevitable, according to some ad
agency executives and marketing consultants. "As the baby
boomers get older, they are taking the wealth with them,"
says Age Wave's Mr. Dychtwald. "And every single publication
will have to ask, `Do we track the boomers past 50, or do we
stick with the youth market?'"</p>
