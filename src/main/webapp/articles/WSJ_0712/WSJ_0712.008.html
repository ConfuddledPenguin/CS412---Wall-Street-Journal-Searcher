	<p class="article-leader">TURIN, Italy -- From his drafting table came the
dart-shaped Lotus Esprit, the wheels once used by that rakish
secret agent James Bond. Later, he came up with the DeLorean
DMC 12, the gull-winged silver sports car that was a design
sensation when it hit the market in 1981.
   Giorgetto Giugiaro may not have his name on the hood of
any car, but he has had plenty of influence on the world's
auto industry. At 51, he is one of the most productive and
sought-after car designers in the world. Ford, Saab,
Maserati, Volkswagen and Hyundai are among the dozens of auto
makers that have made the pilgrimage to his studio since it
opened in 1968. Design experts say perhaps a third of the
cars on the road bear his imprint, either directly or more
distantly through his influence on other car stylists.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Mr. Giugiaro is one of the "carrozzeria" of Turin,
car-body designers who serve, in effect, as trouble-shooters
of the auto industry. Big auto companies from near and far
turn to the carrozzeria when their own designers fall short,
or when they have difficulty breaking free of old ideas. Thus
these designers wield influence far beyond their size (which
is maybe $500 million of annual revenue among them).</p>
<p>Auto makers often pit the carrozzeria against an in-house
design team in hopes of spurring creativity. Since the cost
of developing a new model may exceed $1 billion, a car maker
may well consider it sensible to spend $3 million or $4
million to test its designs against those of the carrozzeria.
The project may be as big as creating a new model, or as
small as reworking a console.</p>
<p>For a top Turin designer like Mr. Giugiaro (pronounced
Gwe-jaro), whose business is known as Italdesign, such
projects provide the steady profits that subsidize the
often-controversial prototype cars he likes to create. Cars
like the Maya, a car he designed and built but couldn't get
an auto maker to manufacture, apparently because it was too
avant-garde.</p>
<p>The Maya would satisfy even the strongest lust for control
and comfort. A disk in the center of its steering wheel is
studded with buttons, putting control of the radio, the
defroster, the mirrors and other systems at the driver's
fingertips. Circling the cockpit is a chest-high leather
crash barrier intended to protect driver and passenger. "I
like this sensation of being enveloped, like a child in a
cradle," Mr. Giugiaro says.</p>
<p>But the Maya is no baby buggy. Under the hood is a
250-horsepower engine. "Everyone is driving fast," says the
designer, weaving in and out of traffic in downtown Turin.
"It's a conflict of modern society. The law says drive slow,
but in reality man wants to drive fast."</p>
<p>Such instincts have made Mr. Giugiaro something of a cult
figure in the auto and design worlds. Trendy restaurants in
Turin display posters of his work on their walls. Earlier
this year, when he visited General Motors Corp.'s design
center outside Detroit, young car stylists clamored for his
autograph.</p>
<p>"He is one of the handful of great designers in the
history of the automobile," says Carl Olsen, head of
transportation design at the Center for Creative Studies in
Detroit. Mr. Olsen ranks Mr. Giugiaro up with such style
gurus as GM's Harley Earle, who in the '50s brought tail
fins, hardtops, two-tone paint jobs and seas of chrome to the
masses.</p>
<p>Lately, Mr. Giugiaro hasn't restricted himself to cars.
The designer also is turning his hand to power boats,
cameras, watches, sewing machines, bicycles and sunglasses.
In Japan, a chain of boutiques specializes in apparel and
accessories of his design. Apple Computer Inc. has asked him
to visualize a new computer, though the project is so secret
that, when asked, Apple initially denied its existence.</p>
<p>Mr. Giugiaro has even taken it upon himself to improve on
Italy's national dish, pasta. His variation, introduced a few
years ago, has grooves to hold the sauce better. Europeans
snapped it up.</p>
<p>Cars, however, remain Mr. Giugiaro's passion, especially
sports cars. In the mid-1960s, he came up with the sleek
Maserati Ghibli, a car that can go 175 miles per hour; a
vintage Ghibli now commands as much as $295,000 at auction.
Mr. Giugiaro is proud of the design of the DeLorean, which is
the time machine in the "Back to the Future" movies. But in
his view, the car looked better than it drove. Even years
later, the thought of it amuses Mr. Giugiaro. "It rolls
around like a whale," he says.</p>
<p>A decade ago, when a rounded, bulletlike silhouette
predominated, he began setting trends with a more angular
look. Now, Mr. Giugiaro is leading the current move towards
curvier, more voluptuous cars.</p>
<p>"Our business is about emotions," says Chuck Jordan, GM's
vice president of design, "and there are not too many cars
out there that move you emotionally. Some of Giugiaro's do."
Mr. Jordan clearly is one of the designer's fans. He wears
Giugiaro-designed sunglasses and drives a Giugiaro-designed
Maserati Ghibli, which he calls "a sensation." But GM
generally doesn't employ outside car designers; it prefers to
keep such work in-house, where it has a staff of 1,200.</p>
<p>Mr. Giugiaro has done some pedestrian stuff, too. When
Volkswagen decided to retool its image and shed its
functional but decidedly inelegant Beetle, it turned to Mr.
Giugiaro. He came up with the boxy Volkswagen Rabbit, which,
though a disappointment in the U.S., was a big hit in Europe.
(There, it was called the Golf.) Some analysts credit the car
with saving Volkswagen, which was facing a dearth of new
products.</p>
<p>Fiat has sold millions of his sub-compact Pandas and Unos.
More recently, he has designed the Chrysler's Eagle Premier
and Hyundai's Excel, which are family cars, and the flashier
Isuzu Impulse. He also did the interior of Ford's sporty new
Capri. In all, Mr. Giugiaro has designed 70 production
vehicles; manufacturers have made more than 10 million of his
cars. "He showed you can make even utilitarian cars fun to
drive," says Stephen Bayley, former curator of London's
Boilerhouse Design Museum.</p>
<p>"My philosophy is to pay attention to man and his needs,"
says Mr. Giugiaro, who says he likes to dabble in the fine
arts. "When I paint, it can be pure emotion. But with design,
one must keep one's feet on the ground."</p>
<p>Mr. Giugiaro's modest origins may explain in part those
sentiments. Born in a village south of Turin, Mr. Giugiaro
studied art and drawing, just as his father, an artist, and
his grandfather, did. A sketch of a car got him a design
apprenticeship at Fiat at age 17.</p>
<p>His fluid and aerodynamic designs quickly drew attention.
By the time he was 21, Mr. Giugiaro was running styling
operations at Carrozzeria Bertone, one of the three top
car-body specialists in Turin. Nine years later, after a
series of successful designs for Alfa-Romeo, Maserati and
Ferrari, he struck out on his own.</p>
<p>With Aldo Mantovani, an engineering specialist, he formed
Italdesign, which in 1988, the most recent year for which
figures are available, had sales of about $56 million. Each
of the men still owns 40% of the company. (A bank owns the
rest.)</p>
<p>Mr. Giugiaro's office is crammed from floor to ceiling
with books on art, design and cars. In one corner, the
designer faces a giant drafting table, gracefully sketching a
rounded roof on a new coupe for a client. Italdesign usually
works on two or three car projects simultaneously. At the
same time, Mr. Giugiaro may be thinking about a half-dozen
industrial designs as well.</p>
<p>The design of a new car can take several weeks. Once the
designer has roughed out some ideas, they go to Mr.
Giugiaro's team of 15 stylists, who refine the ideas and come
up with detailed plans. Then modelers make clay mockups.
Next, builders construct prototypes that are painted and
fitted to look like the finished car. Eventually, Mr.
Mantovani's engineers start work on the blueprints of the
production car.</p>
<p>Italdesign's labyrinthine workshop is a car fanatic's
dream. Along one wall, huge presses smash steel sheets into
fenders and roofs. Nearby, three assembly bays, their
superstructures painted bright red, hold prototypes in
different stages of completion. Two engines sit atop crates
nearby. Italdesign builds everything but engines.</p>
<p>The atmosphere is friendly, but there's no question who is
in charge. In the paint shop, where the smell of turpentine
mixes with clay, Domenico Galante, a white surgical mask
hanging from his neck, calls Mr. Giugiaro "a tough boss."
Another former employee, who asks not to be identified
because he still collaborates with Italdesign, calls him a
"dictator."</p>
<p>Clearly, the designer is hard to please. Once, after an
all-night session to paint a prototype black, Mr. Giugiaro
changed his mind and ordered another all-night session to
paint it silver. The designer recently spent the final hours
before a major auto show rigging a special lighting system
for a car; he didn't like reflections in the paint. When
designers styled a racy grille for a sports car a few years
ago, Mr. Giugiaro took out a pencil and sketched a simpler
design. "He told us, `Your idea is nice, but not for this
car,' " recalls a staff designer.</p>
<p>Mr. Giugiaro has had some flops of his own. A few years
ago, he was widely ridiculed for a car he designed in which
the driver and the passengers were encased in individual
plastic bubbles. Then there was the four-passenger
convertible styled like a motorcycle. Driver and passengers
rode not on seats, but on saddles; the driver had the choice
of using a steering wheel or handlebars.</p>
<p>Though he's been designing for over three decades, Mr.
Giugiaro still seems as restless as a beginner. And, despite
his flops, he has lost none of his boldness. An example is
his research model for a new Bugatti, which caused a
sensation at Turin's recent auto show.</p>
<p>Bugatti, the famous builder of cars for Europe's kings and
tycoons, had fallen on hard times in past years. But a group
of entrepreneurs recently has been trying to rekindle
interest in the Franco-Italian auto maker, whose name alone
conjures images of timeless European luxury and romantic
jaunts on the French Riviera.</p>
<p>Mr. Giugiaro's design -- a low-slung, voluptuously rounded
roadster -- is an effort to capitalize on that image. But the
designer also continues to aspire to new challenges. "My idea
is simplicity," he says. "You can always do better. That's
why I am always looking at cars."</p>
