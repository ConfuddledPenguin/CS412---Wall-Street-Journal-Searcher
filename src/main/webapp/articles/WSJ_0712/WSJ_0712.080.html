	<p class="article-leader">Nynex Corp., which has had a lot of trouble this year, is
bracing for more.
   The telephone holding company was shocked by a record $1.4
million fine that the Federal Communications Commission
proposed in February after an FCC audit found $118.5 million
in alleged overcharges to its operating subsidiaries. Even
greater was the jolt in late May, when the company was
charged in a criminal indictment with violating the consent
decree that broke up the Bell System in 1984.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Now, another potential scandal is erupting at Nynex, one
that may do far more damage.</p>
<p>As part of closed regulatory proceedings in a state rate
case for the company's New York Telephone unit, evidence has
surfaced about a series of bawdy gatherings at Florida
resorts. Nicknamed the "perverts' conventions" by
participants, the raucous, weeklong sessions were held
annually from 1984 to 1988. They allegedly involved improper,
if not illegal, business contacts between employees of
Nynex's purchasing unit, Materiel Enterprises Co., and about
30 Nynex suppliers, some of whom picked up much of the tab.</p>
<p>According to rate-case documents, women were hired to
provide entertainment and sex for the attendees. Other
evidence being reviewed by state regulators draws a
correlation between suppliers' attendance at the conventions
and the volume of Nynex business steered to them. Questions
also have been raised about whether phone customers paid
higher rates because of deals cooked up by convention-goers.</p>
<p>People familiar with the Florida meetings say one Nynex
employee won the "Procurement Award" for three consecutive
years, apparently for "arranging for women" for the
conventions. Others won the "Most Valuable Pervert Award" and
the "Moon Over Miami Award." A Nynex unit vice president,
dismissed for being the ringleader, eventually sued the
company. He won a $1 million settlement and gave the company
a pledge of silence.</p>
<p>Nynex refuses to discuss the Florida meetings, citing its
policy against disclosing personnel matters. In arguments
presented in the New York rate case, the company contends
that such disclosures could strain marriages and hurt company
morale. Nynex also insists that the identities of those who
attended and the companies they represented, as well as the
alleged prostitution and other convention activities, are
"trade secrets" that needn't be disclosed.</p>
<p>"We're not eager to try this thing in the press," a Nynex
spokesman says.</p>
<p>But with all the revelations, a picture emerges of a
company that sometimes acted as if it wasn't subject to
certain regulatory rules or ethical standards. The record
also shows that Nynex officials hampered regulators by
holding back documents in the rate case and suggesting that
only people with dirty minds would pursue the Florida matter.
Moreover, Nynex has paid heavily for top-notch lawyers who
have kept a lid on public disclosures.</p>
<p>The Nynex spokesman contends there was "never any
indication" that customers were harmed or that favoritism was
shown to suppliers. Once the company learned of
purchasing-unit problems, the spokesman says, Nynex "quickly
and efficiently took appropriate action." In rate-case
documents, Nynex representatives say that although suppliers
may have picked up hotel tabs for some Nynex employees, no
business was discussed at the conventions. In any event,
Nynex didn't knowingly pay any of the expenses.</p>
<p>New York's attorney general is investigating allegations
of unusual transactions between company employees and certain
suppliers, possible insider trading in suppliers' stocks, and
suspected misallocations of lobbying expenses, charitable
donations and legal fees. In addition, the Manhattan district
attorney's office has been investigating alleged bid-rigging,
mostly on construction projects, by New York Telephone
employees.</p>
<p>Under the cumulative weight of such developments, the New
York State Public Service Commission staff, the state's
Consumer Protection Board and other parties are preparing to
seek drastic reductions in the company's proposed $1.4
billion rate-increase request over three years.</p>
<p>Another upshot is that Nynex has become the black sheep of
the Baby Bells. The federal indictment and proposed FCC fine
have not only hurt Nynex but also have tarred the six other
Bells trying to win credibility in their fight to get
Congress to lift all consent-decree restrictions. "We need
credibility to get our job done, and accusations like this
hurt all of us, because we are still viewed as the same,"
says Sam Ginn, the chief executive of Pacific Telesis Group.</p>
<p>In fact, Sen. Daniel Inouye, a Hawaii Democrat and
chairman of the Senate Communications subcommittee, cites
Nynex's behavior in opposing a bill to allow the seven Bells
to make telephone equipment. The FCC overcharge case, which
regulators contend proves their ability to catch illegal
behavior, albeit five years after the fact, "is more an
example of regulation by good fortune, hardly a policy for
the long run," he says.</p>
<p>In recent weeks, much of the drama has been unfolding in a
21st-floor conference room in an old New York Telephone
building overlooking the Brooklyn Bridge. Public Service
Commission lawyers, members of the state attorney general's
staff and several men fired by Nynex -- all parties to the
rate case -- sit at a huge table cluttered with papers and
interrogate New York Telephone officials. The object: to
trace the sometimes-obscure ways money flows at the company.</p>
<p>For five days, the lawyers deposed Guy Struve, a partner
at Davis Polk & Wardwell whom Nynex retained in 1988 to
investigate the Florida meetings and other related
activities. After Mr. Struve's investigation, Nynex ended up
firing the alleged ringleader of the conventions, Lawrence
Friedman. Mr. Friedman had been Materiel Enterprises' vice
president for purchasing, reporting directly to the
subsidiary's president.</p>
<p>Mr. Struve declines to comment about his work for Nynex.
Repeated attempts to reach Mr. Friedman were unsuccessful.</p>
<p>After his dismissal, Mr. Friedman sued Nynex in state
court in Manhattan claiming religious discrimination -- he is
Jewish. Nynex has made at least one payment on the $1 million
settlement. A provision in the settlement tied future
payments over a 10-year period to Mr. Friedman's continuing
silence on the matter, but last month a New York Telephone
lawyer officially freed Mr. Friedman -- and others who had
signed similar settlements -- to talk to the PSC, the
attorney general's office and the Consumer Protection Board.</p>
<p>One other employee, who assisted Mr. Friedman in planning
the conventions, was dismissed, and five more were
disciplined. People familiar with the company's security
procedures say the investigations left members of the Florida
convention group and other current employees spooked enough
to keep quiet.</p>
<p>Mr. Struve's $500,000-plus investigation, supported by
Kroll Associates, a private investigative agency, produced
11,000 pages of documents and conclusions. A central
conclusion: The atmosphere at the conventions was "boys'
night out," with no serious talk of business.</p>
<p>"One of the areas that we tried to question everybody
about was whether there was any discussion of business of any
sort at the conventions," Mr. Struve testified. "With two
exceptions, which I consider immaterial, the answer uniformly
was that there was absolutely no business discussion at any
of the conventions. Given the nature of the activities of the
conventions, that probably will not surprise you." Many of
the supplier employees, he added, weren't directly involved
in sales to Nynex.</p>
<p>Just after the Florida investigation began, Mr. Struve
testified that he and a Davis Polk senior partner, Robert
Fiske, concluded that the conventions episode wasn't a matter
for prosecutors. When state and federal regulators arrived,
the company produced confidential files and studies that
indicated no favoritism was shown to suppliers who attended.
Regulators didn't investigate further.</p>
<p>The 1988 investigation wasn't Mr. Friedman's first
go-round with Nynex; he was investigated by New York
Telephone security people in 1985 also involving the Florida
sessions. The company commissioned a follow-up review by the
New York law firm of Milbank, Tweed, Hadley & McCloy to see
whether it was missing something. The Nynex spokesman says
the investigation into unspecified allegations "came up with
nothing." That investigation and an earthy videotape for the
1987 convention that contained a brief appearance by another
Materiel Enterprises vice president poking fun at a
subordinate for attending the convention indicate that some
top officials at Materiel Enterprises knew about the
conventions.</p>
<p>Some participants in the rate case strongly disagree with
the conclusion that there weren't any ties between sales to
Nynex and the cavorting with Materiel Enterprises officials
in Florida.</p>
<p>"I don't know how Nynex's investigations could have missed
it, unless they really weren't looking," says Scott Rafferty,
a fired Nynex executive who initiated the Justice Department
investigations that led to Nynex's criminal indictment in
May. Mr. Rafferty took Nynex data that tracked the years that
each supplier had a representative at the Florida parties and
each supplier's sales to Nynex. Adjusting for companies that
didn't sell to Nynex, he ran the data through a computer to
find an average compounded annual growth rate.</p>
<p>Mr. Rafferty found a strong correlation: For suppliers who
attended, sales grew an average of 67% over the years,
including later years when their employees may not have
attended. For suppliers not represented at the Florida
sessions, sales to Materiel Enterprises crept along with
about 3.5% growth.</p>
<p>Mr. Rafferty was hired to direct the consulting operations
of Nynex's newly acquired Telco Research unit in the spring
of 1986. He said his salary was $110,000 a year. Then a
confident 30-year-old, he already had a solid resume:
Princeton undergrad, Yale law school, Rhodes scholar,
experience in telecommunications on Capitol Hill, and a stint
at McKinsey & Co., the consulting firm.</p>
<p>But Mr. Rafferty's vision of building a consulting
business at Nynex vanished quickly. In the fall of 1986, he
says, he questioned whether Telco's consulting activities
qualified under a waiver Nynex had received from the court
overseeing the Bell System consent decree. Shortly after
that, the consulting operation was disbanded, and he was
fired.</p>
<p>Nynex maintains that the consent decree had nothing to do
with it. The company cites "business reasons" for disbanding
the unit and won't discuss the circumstances of Mr.
Rafferty's departure.</p>
<p>Overnight, Mr. Rafferty became Nynex's worst nightmare: a
sharp, aggressive lawyer with abundant energy, intense
concern about his consulting clients and his reputation, and
a burning desire for vindication. Just after he was fired,
Barbara Morris, a Nynex lobbyist, passed along a suggestion
to Donald Reed, then head of Nynex's Washington office, from
a Nynex lawyer that "this guy should be neutralized fast . .
. before he goes over to DOJ {Department of Justice} and
suggests they look into Nynex operations for compliance" with
the consent decree. The Nynex spokesman says Ms. Morris was
trying "to find a way to defuse the tension."</p>
<p>This spring, Mr. Rafferty and several other former Nynex
employees intervened in the New York rate case, and, in an
unusual twist, the parties to the case won the right to
depose New York Telephone witnesses.</p>
<p>As a spinoff to that case, Mr. Rafferty recently filed a
complaint at the FCC alleging that Nynex improperly allocated
to New York Telephone and New England Telephone most of the
$7 million it paid to outside counsel, mostly Davis Polk, in
connection with a suit that he filed against Nynex and the
Justice Department investigations leading up to the
indictment.</p>
<p>The legal fees are likely to keep piling up as Nynex gets
ready for trial in late autumn in federal court in Washington
on a charge of willfully providing prohibited information
services. Although the single charge that came out of the
two-year investigation seems small -- Nynex's Telco Research
unit provided certain computer services to MCI Communications
Corp. -- the trial is certain to draw considerable attention
as the first criminal case charging a violation in the
consent decree.</p>
<p>In New York, the attorney general's office is also
investigating whether Nynex accounted improperly for
charitable donations and lobbying expenses. Already, the FCC
has excluded some lobbying expenses from interstate rates,
and the attorney general's office is investigating a long
roster of New York Telephone payments that may have gone to
charities but were listed under general and administrative
expenses. These include payments to such organizations as the
42nd Street Educational Theatre Culture, the Abraham Lincoln
Association and U.S. Olympic Committee.</p>
<p>Regulators generally allow utilities to earn a set
percentage of profits on their rate base. So, if New York
Telephone's rate base was padded by improper accounting for
charitable donations and the like, or by inflating the cost
of goods that the phone company buys from another Nynex unit,
customers would wind up paying more for phone service the
next time rates are reset.</p>
<p>Whether consumers have paid anything extra, or how much,
is uncertain because a rate moratorium has been in effect in
New York for the past few years. New York Telephone contends
that it has been making less than the 14% of its rate base it
is permitted to earn.</p>
<p>In addition to the rate case, investigators at the New
York state attorney general's office are delving into company
documents and depositions that could shed light on special
ties between Materiel Enterprises personnel and suppliers.</p>
<p>"Obviously, our first priority is the rate case, but there
are footprints all over the place," says Charles Donaldson, a
lawyer in the attorney general's office. "It is a question of
which trail to follow."</p>
