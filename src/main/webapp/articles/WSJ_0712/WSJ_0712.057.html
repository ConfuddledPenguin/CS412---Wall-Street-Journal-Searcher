	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- CBS Inc. posted a 16% increase in
second-quarter net income, helped by broadcasting the
National Basketball Association playoff and championship
games and by a drop in programming costs from a year earlier.
   The profit was a second-quarter record, but CBS said the
prospect for continued growth for the balance of the year was
"uncertain" amid a sluggish economy and increased costs for
rights to major sports events.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Profit rose to $138 million, or $5.36 a share, from $118.8
million, or $4.62 a share, a year earlier. Revenue rose 7% to
$828.8 million from $771.8 million.</p>
<p>CBS, the No. 3-rated network in prime time for the third
consecutive year, is gambling $3.6 billion over the next few
years on broadcast rights to big sports events, including
four-year major league baseball and football packages that
will begin this year. Each four-year deal is priced at $1.06
billion.</p>
<p>CBS Broadcast Group, which includes the network, TV and
radio stations and news and sports divisions and is CBS's
only major subsidiary, posted a 31% gain in pretax operating
profit to $180.9 million from $137.9 million.</p>
<p>Laurence A. Tisch, CBS president and chief executive
officer, said in a statement that the gain was because of
"improved" results at each of the three broadcast divisions,
the television network, television stations and radio. The
earnings at the television network, he said, were "enhanced"
by an expanded number of NBA playoff and championship games
and decreased entertainment programming costs related mainly
to the writers' strike which pushed costs into the second
quarter of 1989."</p>
<p>The 1989 second quarter was unusual because of the
writers' strike, which resulted in a delay of the 1988-89
prime-time season. As a result, programming costs increased
in that quarter because the networks broadcast more original
programming than usual. Traditionally, the networks begin
airing series repeats in the second quarter.</p>
<p>CBS's earnings "were much better than I expected," said
Jessica Rief, an analyst at First Boston Corp. Nevertheless,
Ms. Rief said she did not expect third and fourth quarter
results would meet year-earlier levels.</p>
<p>Commenting on the frenzied one-week period when
advertisers buy commercial time in advance of the 1990-91
prime time season, Ms. Rief said, "CBS took in $100 million
less in up-front advertising this year compared to last year
and, let's face it, they're getting increasing competition
from Fox" Broadcasting Co. Fox, a unit of News Corp., is
increasing the number of nights it programs to five from
three in September.</p>
<p>Moreover, Ms. Rief noted, the NBA, which helped CBS in the
second quarter, recently signed a deal to be broadcast on
National Broadcasting Co.'s network. NBC is a unit of General
Electric Co.</p>
<p>In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange, CBS
stock closed at $198.50 a share, up 62.5 cents.</p>
