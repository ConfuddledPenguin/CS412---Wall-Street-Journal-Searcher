	<p class="article-leader">Five Persian Gulf oil ministers urged the Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries to freeze its output ceiling in
an effort to push the average price of its basket of crudes
to at least $18 a barrel from the current $14.
   Meeting in Saudi Arabia, the five Persian Gulf members of
OPEC said in a statement that the recent erosion of oil
prices necessitated a "strict, practical and immediate
commitment by all OPEC members to the production ceiling set
out in the November 1989 accord, which is to be maintained
until prices rise to an acceptable level."</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Some oil analysts promptly labeled the statement a
"blueprint" for the midyear OPEC conference beginning July 25
in Geneva. The statement also affected oil and stock markets.
Oil prices rose again, and prices of oil company shares
increased in trading on U.S. markets.</p>
<p>The November agreement called for a production ceiling of
22.1 million barrels a day. But largely because of
overproduction by Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates, actual
output is running at least a million barrels a day more than
that. This has contributed to a world oil glut and helped
depress petroleum prices by one-third.</p>
<p>Ministers from Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates
participated in the meeting along with their counterparts
from Saudi Arabia, Iraq and Qatar. Without being more
specific, the joint statement suggested Kuwait and the United
Arab Emirates would cooperate with OPEC output curbs.</p>
<p>Although oil analysts credited some other factors besides
the Saudi meeting, prices of North Sea crudes reacted to the
news, rising 15 cents to 30 cents a barrel in European spot
markets. In heavy U.S. futures trading, crude oil for August
delivery closed higher for the third straight day, rising 53
cents a barrel to settle at $17.47. For the second day in a
row, several U.S. refiners increased field postings for West
Texas Intermediate crude by 50 cents a barrel.</p>
<p>In New York Stock Exchange composite trading, Unocal Corp.
was particulary active among oil issues, rising $1.50 to
$27.75 on a volume of 1.6 million shares. Other advancing
issues included Exxon Corp., Chevron Corp., Texaco Inc.,
Mobil Corp. and Amoco Corp. Among oil field-services
concerns, Baker Hughes Inc., Schlumberger Ltd., Halliburton
Co. and Rowan Cos. all posted gains.</p>
<p>The meeting of the five ministers followed a pattern. The
Persian Gulf group, holding most of the world's spare
oil-producing capacity, usually gets together just before an
OPEC conference. But oil economists saw this meeting as being
particularly significant, with President Saddam Hussein of
Iraq and King Fahd of Saudi Arabia clearly taking a stronger
hand in OPEC affairs.</p>
<p>"In my mind, the real OPEC meeting just concluded," said
Bryan Jacoboski, senior oil analyst at PaineWebber Inc.</p>
<p>Whatever influence the group of five may have on the eight
other OPEC members, industry officials saw nothing
controversial in the proposals. "This is a very positive
development," said a senior OPEC delegate from a country
outside the Persian Gulf.</p>
<p>Most of OPEC's 13 members, except for Kuwait and the
United Arab Emirates, have kept higher petroleum prices
rather than expanded production as their top priority all
along. That is because many are already producing at
capacity, and the price declines this year have cut deeply
into their revenues. Yesterday, for example, Iraq officially
endorsed a proposal by Iran to cooperate with its former
enemy in pressing for an oil price of $25 a barrel.</p>
<p>"For the first time now, all of them are singing the same
song," said Antonio M. Szabo, president of the management
science division of Bonner & Moore Consultants.</p>
<p>It wasn't immediately clear how the other Persian Gulf
countries would handle the situation with the United Arab
Emirates, which refuses to accept its OPEC quota of 1.1
million barrels a day. But there were hints that others could
reduce their quotas slightly to give more leeway to the
United Arab Emirates or raise the ceiling, if necessary.</p>
<p>Oil analysts speculated that if the ceiling were raised by
400,000 barrels a day, to 22.5 million, the United Arab
Emirates would have a quota of 1.5 million barrels a day and
parity with Kuwait. The analysts suggested that in return the
United Arab Emirates would trim its actual output from two
million barrels a day to 1.8 million. Kuwait also would
reduce its production from the current 1.7 million. That
would mean total OPEC output could drop below 23 million.</p>
<p>The statement from the ministers wasn't specific on this
matter, but it did say that the "forthcoming ministerial
meeting should not increase the current OPEC ceiling unless a
figure can be agreed that involves all 13 members, including
the United Arab Emirates." Also, the statement said, "a study
was undertaken to guarantee the UAE's return to the agreement
and {to ensure} that it abides by what it is allocated. It is
hoped that this issue will be resolved during the next few
days."</p>
