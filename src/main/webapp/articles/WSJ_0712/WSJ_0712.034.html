	<p class="article-leader">LOS ANGELES -- Ford Motor Co. said it is offering owners
of old gas guzzlers $700 a vehicle to scrap them. Ford said
it will buy 1,000 of the most heavily polluting cars here.
   The car company is piggy-backing on a program launched by
Unocal Corp. in April. Unocal offered to buy 7,000 cars made
before 1971 at a price of $700 a vehicle. More than 10,000
owners applied, leaving the company with a waiting list.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>A Unocal spokesman says Ford approached Unocal about
participating in the program. So far Unocal has scrapped
about 2,500 cars and plans to buy as many as 4,700 more, for
a total of 7,200, slightly more than the original plan.</p>
<p>Ford is combining its environmental gesture with a sales
pitch. Ford said it is offering sellers an additional $700
toward the purchase or lease of a new, low-emission Ford
vehicle, such as a Ford Festiva, Ford Escort or Mercury
Tracer. Ford said it is also making that offer to those who
sell their cars to Unocal.</p>
