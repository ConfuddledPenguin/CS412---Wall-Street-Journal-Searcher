	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- Fraudulent international investment schemes
cost Americans $1.1 billion in 1988 and 1989, the North
American Securities Administrators Association said in a
report to be presented to Congress today.
   "International scams are now the fastest growing fraud
problem with which state securities agencies are dealing,"
said Kansas Securities Commissioner M. Douglas Mays. Fueling
the growth are poor international regulatory cooperation and
increased interest in overseas investing.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Three out of four schemes involve U.S.-based promoters,
falsely claiming to be engaged in overseas investment
programs, which include precious metals, currency
speculation, bonds and foreign banking instruments, and
"norisk" high-yield certificates of deposit.</p>
<p>In contrast, overseas-based scams usually involve
high-pressure telephone sales operations, based in Costa
Rica, Panama or bogus offshore banks in the South Pacific,
according to the 100-page study to be presented at a
subcommittee hearing on investment fraud, chaired by Rep.
Douglas Barnard Jr. (D., Ga.).</p>
<p>International investment scams were the topic of a recent
Wall Street Journal column, Your Money Matters.</p>
