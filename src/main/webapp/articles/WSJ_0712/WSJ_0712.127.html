	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK (AP) -- Magazine publisher Dale Lang said he
plans to launch a television network this fall that will
feature direct-response advertising programs and reruns of
classic television shows.
   Mr. Lang, chairman of the newly created Star Television
Network Inc., said 23 independent UHF stations -- reaching
more than 13.7 million of the nation's 92 million TV-owning
households -- have agreed to carry the service starting in
September.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Stations that sign affiliation agreements will be given
eight hours of television programs a day, consisting of
movies, game shows and series like "Life of Riley," "The
Invaders" and "Richard Diamond," Mr. Lang said.</p>
<p>In exchange for the programs, the stations must run at
least four hours a day of direct-response programs, also
called "infomercials." These are program-length commercials
in which a marketer typically demonstrates a product and
invites viewers to call in to order.</p>
<p>Mr. Lang said Star Television and the producers of the
infomercials would share revenue from sales of the products
or services with affiliate stations.</p>
<p>A spokeswoman for Mr. Lang couldn't say how much was being
invested in the new network. The network will be transmitted
to member stations via satellite.</p>
<p>Mr. Lang also heads Lang Communications, a New York-based
media company that publishes Working Woman, Working Mother,
Sassy and Success magazines.</p>
