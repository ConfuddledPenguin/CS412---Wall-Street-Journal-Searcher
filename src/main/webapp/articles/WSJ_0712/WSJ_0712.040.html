	<p class="article-leader">Your May 23 page-one story "Data Switch: PC Networks Begin
to Oust Mainframes in Some Companies" is short on examples.
You begin with a discussion of an IBM 3090 system valued at
$3 million being replaced by PCs, make vague references to
$20 million mainframes (that apparently are not being
replaced by PCs), and immediately segue to an IBM 4300 and a
12-year-old Honeywell machine (the power of which probably
today resides in a single PC). In fact, you cite just four
companies that have replaced mainframes with PCs, and even
your references to such major corporations as AT&T and Baxter
indicate that only "some" of the work performed by mainframes
is now being done by PCs. Moreover, despite acknowledgments
regarding the limitations of PCs, the article, of course,
still includes the usual "mainframe is dead" comments.
   Gulliver being felled by the Lilliputians may appeal to
the imagination, but it has little to do with what is
happening in the computer business. Although industries such
as airlines, insurance and banking are replete with examples
showing that large 3090 systems and the data bases that
reside on those systems have generated a need for thousands
of personal computers, there are few examples, if any, of PCs
having replaced the mainframes involved.</p>

<p>Well, which is it? Are networked PCs going to vanquish
mainframes? Or are mainframes going to replace stock-fund
pros? Two of your stories on May 23 suggest both scenarios
are possible. In addition to the page-one story, there's
"Swapping Your Mutual Fund Manager for a Mainframe" in your
Money & Investing section.</p>
<p>Confusion over the role that mainframe computers are
playing in large corporations and institutions is evident.
The people with the clearest idea of what mainframes and, for
that matter, networked PCs will do in the future are
customers of such computing platforms.</p>
<p>In our recent survey of more than 3,000 such customers in
North America, they indicate that most new applications of
information technology within their enterprises continue to
be implemented on mainframes. They do say, however, that a
growing number of office-related functions are, indeed, being
performed by networks of desktop systems. They also believe
that PCs are far more likely to increase the workload of
their mainframe systems than to decrease it.</p>
<p>These customers, by the way, hardly feel threatened by
networked PCs. Most embrace them as a means of distributing
computer power throughout their organizations.</p>
