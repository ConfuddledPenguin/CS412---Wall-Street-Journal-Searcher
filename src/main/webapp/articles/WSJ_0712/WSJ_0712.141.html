	<p class="article-leader">Lewis Galoob Toys Inc., San Francisco, said it expected to
report "significant losses" for the second quarter and for
the year.
   The toy company blamed the projected losses on soft retail
sales and lower-than-expected sales of two big product lines.
Galoob said the losses also come because the company won't
begin significant shipments of new products until the third
quarter.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>In the year-earlier second quarter, Galoob had net income
of $4.7 million, or 49 cents a share, on revenue of $56.1
million. Galoob's stock closed at $4.75, up 25 cents, in
trading on the New York Stock Exchange yesterday.</p>
