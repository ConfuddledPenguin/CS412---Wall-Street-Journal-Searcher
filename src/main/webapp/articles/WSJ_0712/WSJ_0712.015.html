	<p class="article-leader">"Ghost" isn't awful enough to be a great trash movie, but
it often comes close. The ingredients are there for no-brains
junky pleasure: the supernatural, a suspense story that's
also a comedy, mawkish sentimentality, Whoopi Goldberg, and
the wonderfully plastic Patrick Swayze.
   This is the second picture this summer to kill off its
main character quickly, then have him remain on Earth as part
spirit, part human in order to help his loved ones. The first
film of the season to do this was "Ghost Dad," the most
recent of Bill Cosby's attempts to make people pay for what
they get for free on "The Cosby Show." Both films use roughly
the same special effects to propel their human-looking ghosts
through cars and doors. "Ghost Dad," however, firmly
establishes itself as a comedy and proceeds to fail in a very
specific way (by not being funny).</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The director of "Ghost," Jerry Zucker, never commits
himself to a particular vision. There's such a feeling of
uncertainty hanging over the whole enterprise that one half
expects Mr. Swayze, who is the ghost, to bump his head when
he tries to float through a door. Indeed, puzzlement is the
best way to describe the expression he wears throughout most
of the movie.</p>
<p>Yet there is something goofily endearing about his waxy
look of wonder. He would have been so perfectly cast as the
lead in one of the "B" science fiction movies that were so
popular in the 1950s. For a man with such a lithe, athletic
body, Mr. Swayze always seems awkward and uncomfortable. The
disparity worked better in "Dirty Dancing," where Mr. Swayze,
who was a professional dancer, was able to express himself
through his body movements. In "Ghost" his gawkiness serves
no obvious dramatic purpose.</p>
<p>Mr. Swayze plays Sam, a nervous young banker whose
cultural interests appear to be limited to Molly, the
ceramics artist he loves. The picture's rather tedious
opening sequences are meant to drive home the point that Sam
and Molly (Demi Moore) love each other with an intensity
matched in degree only by the intensity of their cuteness.
They aren't particularly clever or interesting; Sam tells a
friend that he and Molly are going to see "Macbeth" because,
"I think she likes the guys in tights, personally." The
director tries to compensate for Sam and Molly's
conversational deficiencies with a love scene shot with lewd
coyness.</p>
<p>The movie gains momentum after Sam dies his terrible death
but doesn't disappear and remains an unseen presence to all
the humans in the films (yet perfectly visible to cats and to
the audience). Sam learns that his death wasn't accidental,
that he was murdered, and that Molly is in danger. He heads
for the nearest storefront spiritual adviser (since the film
is shot in New York City there is one very nearby) and finds
Ms. Goldberg, posing as Oda Mae Brown, psychic.</p>
<p>Oda Mae is a charlatan who has taken in much money
pretending to hear voices from beyond. But for some reason
she really does hear Sam, who recruits her to help warn
Molly. As Oda Mae, Ms. Goldberg does some amusing bits of
business, though mainly she's a reminder that movie producers
simply haven't found a way to use Ms. Goldberg's talents. But
that's only one of the numerous questions left hanging in
"Ghost," which provides almost none of the internal logic
required of a supernatural story.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>I finally caught up with Sandra Bernhard's docudrama
"Without You I'm Nothing," another kind of supernatural story
whose internal logic is summed up very well by Ms. Bernhard:
"My father's a proctologist, my mother's an abstract artist.
That's how I view the world."</p>
<p>Ms. Bernhard puts on an astonishing performance in this
bizarre, funny and prickly satire of pop culture. Director
John Boskovich and Ms. Bernhard, who co-authored the script,
have constructed their show as a nightclub act interrupted by
exposition from Ms. Bernhard's manager and an actor friend.
Periodically a beautiful black woman, who appears to be Ms.
Bernhard's alter ego, floats enigmatically across the screen;
she's seen in one of these interludes reading Harold Bloom's
"Kabbalah and Criticism" outside a kosher butcher shop.</p>
<p>With her thick lips and nose and bulldog jaw, Ms. Bernhard
doesn't fit any mold of classic beauty. But she does have a
long, lean body that slides nicely into a slinky evening
gown, and Ms. Bernhard is obsessed with the definition of a
beauty that says she is one from the neck down and not one
from the neck up. The first time she appears in the film she
is sitting at a dressing table -- which she spritzes with
window cleaner -- wearing a sexy dressing gown and snipping
her split ends with small scissors. "I have one of those
really hard to believe faces," she muses.</p>
<p>She is an energetic and unpredictable storyteller, whose
subjects range from a wryly sentimental recollection of the
1965 World's Fair to a straight man's memory of a wild night
in a gay bar. She's a Jewish girl from Flint who has
fantasies of being a black woman, especially Diana Ross, or a
white suburban Christian lady with a brother named Chip. This
"nightclub act" takes place in a black jazz club. Ms.
Bernhard sings a variety of pop songs with great passion,
then provides a hilarious commentary on the subtext of those
songs.</p>
<p>Ms. Bernhard knows the boundaries and does her best to
test every one of them in outrageously inventive acts of
narcissism. "The critics are right," she says." I am a petty
bilious girl." She's also a great, eccentric talent.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>VIDEO TIP: Ms. Bernhard has never been cast better than
she was by Martin Scorsese in "King of Comedy," his
brilliantly bilious story about a would-be comic who decides
to make it by kidnapping a late-night talkshow host. This
underrated film has burning performances by Robert De Niro
and Jerry Lewis and, of course, Ms. Bernhard.</p>
<p>Ms. Bernhard's is one of a number of exciting standup acts
you can watch sitting down at home. My favorites include
"Robin Williams Live"; "Richard Pryor Live in Concert" (the
1979 film, not the later, inferior sequels); and "Divine
Madness," shot before Bette Midler became a movie star.</p>
