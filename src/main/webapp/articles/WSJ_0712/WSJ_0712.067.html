	<p class="article-leader">Assets of money-market mutual funds rose by about $4.7
billion in the eight days ended Tuesday, reversing the
outflows of the previous period.
   Assets of 430 taxable funds now stand at $379.2 billion,
up from $374.6 billion on July 2, according to IBC/Donoghue's
Money Fund Report. The Holliston, Mass.-based newsletter did
its regular weekly survey a day early last week because of
the July Fourth holiday, reporting a $4.3 billion drop in
assets for the previous six-day period.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Yields on taxable funds dipped slightly in the latest
period. The seven-day compound yield of the funds, which
assumes reinvestment of dividends, slid to 7.95% from 7.97%,
Donoghue's reported. Average yields have been at or just
below 8% since early this year.</p>
<p>"People may just be parking their cash," said Martha
Wittbrodt, editor of the newsletter. "The stock and bond
markets have been rather choppy" and yields on certificates
of deposit have softened in recent weeks, she noted.</p>
<p>Average maturity of money-fund investments, such things as
commercial paper (short-term corporate IOUs), Treasury bills
and bank CDs, shortened by two days to 43 days. Shorter
maturities are often thought to indicate that portfolio
managers expect interest rates to rise, because they permit
funds to grab higher yields sooner. But the current average
is well within the range of the last few months. Average
maturity has been as short as 29 days and as long as 53 days
in recent years.</p>
<p>The average seven-day simple yield of the taxable funds
slipped to 7.65% from 7.68%. The average 30-day simple yield
remained at 7.67%, while the average 30-day compound yield
stayed at 7.97%.</p>
<p>Assets of tax-exempt funds rose by about $3.2 billion in
the last eight days, Donoghue's said, while yields fell.
Assets increased to $78.9 billion; the average seven-day
compound yield of the 224 tax-free funds dropped to 5.30%
from 5.46%. The latest yield is equivalent to 7.36% for an
investor in the 28% tax bracket and 7.91% for someone paying
33%.</p>
<p>Average maturity for the tax-free funds lengthened to 49
days from 48.</p>
