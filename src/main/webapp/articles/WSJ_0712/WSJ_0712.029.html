	<p class="article-leader">DALLAS -- Edwin T. McBirney III, former owner of the
defunct Sunbelt Savings Association of Texas, was indicted by
a federal grand jury here, the second major indictment in the
past month by the Justice Department in its investigation
into thrift fraud.
   Mr. McBirney, whose life style and penchant for risky
business ventures earned him the nickname "Fast Eddie," is
one of a handful of former Texas thrift owners who have been
targets of the Justice Department's Dallas Bank Fraud Task
Force since the unit was formed three years ago. The
indictment came just four weeks after the indictment of
another flashy former thrift owner, Don R. Dixon, who owned
Vernon Savings & Loan Association. Mr. Dixon has pleaded
innocent to the charges against him.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Unlike the Dixon case, which was based on the alleged use
of thrift funds to reimburse employees for political campaign
contributions and female escorts, the indictment against Mr.
McBirney is based on actual loan transactions. Those
transactions contributed about $160 million in losses to
Sunbelt's total losses of more than $2 billion, according to
federal thrift regulators.</p>
<p>The 17-count indictment relates to Sunbelt's attempt to
finance a unit's 1984 purchase of about $700 million of real
estate in Southern California, including the Los Angeles
Airport Hilton and Anaheim Hilton at Disneyland hotels.</p>
<p>"The indictment is a typical case of government overkill,
in which they have taken a single transaction that, before
all the hysteria, would have been a two or three count
indictment," said Mr. McBirney's defense lawyer, Paul Coggins
of Dallas. "I don't see anything in the indictment that says
Mr. McBirney personally profited or acted contrary to the
interests of Sunbelt."</p>
<p>The indictment specifically alleges that Mr. McBirney
conspired with a vice president of the now-defunct Western
Savings Association of Dallas for Western to provide about
$30 million in financing for the California properties.</p>
<p>In exchange for the loan from Western, Mr. McBirney
"offered to give Western a $6 million profit on any piece of
property Western wanted to sell," the indictment says.</p>
<p>The property selected by Western was 708 acres on Lake
Lewisville, north of Dallas. Western lent a borrower $16.8
million to acquire the land from a Western unit; Sunbelt, at
the behest of Mr. McBirney, then lent the borrower $22.6
million to cover the principal of the Western loan, plus
interest, and a $6 million profit for Western, according to
the indictment.</p>
<p>The indictment accuses Mr. McBirney of misapplying Sunbelt
funds to keep the land loan current and of lying to Sunbelt
officers and Texas thrift officials about the status of the
loan.</p>
<p>The indictment further charges Mr. McBirney with fraud in
connection with Sunbelt's financing of a subsequent, interim
purchase of the Lake Lewisville land by Kenneth Hood, a
former Western vice president. Mr. Hood is one of 10 people
who have pleaded guilty to criminal charges related to
Sunbelt transactions and are cooperating in the ongoing fraud
investigation.</p>
<p>If convicted of all charges in the indictment, Mr.
McBirney faces a maximum possible sentence of 85 years in
federal prison and a $4.25 million fine. He is scheduled to
surrender to federal authorities today.</p>
<p>Mr. McBirney and five colleagues acquired Sunbelt Savings
in December 1982 and eventually merged it with four other
thrifts. During his ownership of Sunbelt, Mr. McBirney became
known for the expensive parties he gave for employees at
Halloween and Christmas.</p>
<p>Thrift regulators took control of Sunbelt in October 1986,
but Mr. McBirney didn't resign from the thrift's board until
June 1987. Less than a year later, Sunbelt, with $2.2 billion
in assets, was merged with seven other thrifts to become
Sunbelt Savings FSB.</p>
<p>Mr. McBirney currently is chairman and chief executive
officer of Dallas-based Oxidyne Group Inc., a troubled
holding company with interests in real estate and solid-waste
disposal technology.</p>
