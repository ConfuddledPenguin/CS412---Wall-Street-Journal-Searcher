	<p class="article-leader">KUALA LAMPUR, Malaysia -- Wages rose 10% in the second
quarter from a year earlier as Malaysia's economic expansion
continued to strain the labor market, according to the
Malaysian Institute of Economic Research.
   In its quarterly survey on business conditions, the
institute said 44% of roughly 500 businesses polled said they
had raised their wages in the second quarter, compared with
35% a year earlier. With companies' production demands
growing faster than the skilled labor pool, "more firms are
now willing to provide training for workers. Other firms have
resorted to personnel pinching by increasing wages," the
institute said.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The institute, financed by the government but
independently organized, said the competition for workers is
stiff.</p>
<p>Official government estimates put Malaysia's unemployment
rate at between 7.5% and 7.9% in 1989 and predict moderate
improvement to about 7% this year. But analysts note the rate
for skilled workers is much lower, and labor shortages have
been reported in certain regions.</p>
