	<p class="article-leader">FEAR OF FRAUD prompts more banks to nix credit card use
for new merchants.
   Banks get tougher about refusing new vendors' credit card
business as fraud involving direct marketers mounts. Industry
officials say illegal telemarketers alone cost the
credit-card banks about $200 million a year. Visa and
MasterCard recently cracked down on "boiler-room" telephone
pitchmen using high-pressure tactics to sell water purifiers,
security systems, vitamins and travel packages. They filed a
multimillion-dollar lawsuit over one such alleged scam that
netted at least $4 million.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Start-up businesses, like Peter Hochberg's fledgling line
of riding clothes, are most hobbled. Mr. Hochberg, a Hickory,
N.C., management consultant, pressed six banks in an
unsuccessful attempt to establish a Visa and MasterCard
merchant account to get his direct-mail business off the
ground. Mr. Hochberg notes the cards account for 80% of
mail-order purchases. "If I can't accept them, I'm out of
business."</p>
<p>Eventually, one of Mr. Hochberg's suppliers agreed to
process credit card purchases through his own account.</p>
<p>LEMON AID comes from overseas as a puckered U.S. crop
propels juice prices.</p>
<p>For the second month, lemon juice pops up on a
short-supply list from the nation's purchasing agents. Lemon
concentrate prices are at "historic highs, as far as I can
tell," says a buyer for Borden's ReaLemon. Price per gallon
is as high as $13, nearly double three years ago. Bad weather
in California cuts the crop to about 65% of normal, says
Sunkist Growers. The co-op members "are storing anything that
has any life in it rather than go to juice." Why? Fresh fruit
sells at a premium to processed.</p>
<p>Juice users increasingly turn to Argentina (also a lean
crop), Italy, Spain and Mexico. "We're buying from five or
six sources so the bulk is coming from overseas," says Dr
Pepper/Seven-Up. Consumers don't feel the squeeze so badly,
but prices vary. Robert Libbin, owner of a Ben & Jerry's in
Chicago, says some weeks his lemonade isn't profitable,
depending on the fruit's price. Recently it was $1.59 a
pound; on July 4, he sold a 16-ounce fresh lemonade for
$1.63.</p>
<p>HOSPITAL CREDIT ratings recover a bit, but many are still
on the critical list.</p>
<p>"Hospital bonds are probably the most volatile in the
municipal market," says Moody's William DeSante. Rankings
continue to erode, but at a reduced pace: Moody's downgraded
18 hospitals in both the first half of this year and the
first half of 1989, but upgrades rose to seven this year from
four in the 1989 half. At Standard & Poor's, the downgrade
ratio narrowed to 2-to-1 in the second quarter from 3-to-1 in
the first period. But recent "alarming growth" in the
non-investment grade category is likely to continue, says
S&P. Most at risk: hospitals with fewer than 100 beds.</p>
<p>Part of the problem in gauging hospital creditworthiness
stems from outside regulation, since Medicare and large
insurers hold prices down. And, unlike cities and school
districts, most hospitals can't simply raise taxes to
generate funds. "They are competing in terribly restrictive
environments," says Mr. DeSante. Higher borrowing costs
"increase the cost of care" and curb investment, says Richard
Clarke, head of Healthcare Financial Management Association.</p>
<p>In 1989, 5.7% of hospitals rated by S&P were ranked below
investment grade, up from only 1.2% in 1983.</p>
<p>BLASTED GOLFBALL] Canada's Whiteshell Nuclear Research
laboratories boost nuclear power with "atomic" golfballs that
are irradiated for "more bounce." The USGA tested the balls
in June and found no effect. But, as one tester says, golfers
"would sacrifice a live chicken if they thought it'd get them
10 more yards."</p>
<p>CHOW PASSES DOW: Interstate/Johnson Lane, a Charlotte,
N.C., broker, says goods inflation outpaces stock gains.
Since 1961, prices in Charlotte jumped 638% for a pound of
beef, 755% for a home and 620% for a foreign car. The DJIA
rose 414%.</p>
<p>PARENTS KNEW THIS. The Conference Board says families with
kids accounted for two out of every five dollars spent in
1989.</p>
<p>OUTWARD BOUND urbanites in search of jobs, housing may
foretell trend.</p>
<p>People migrated into cities like New York during the
1980s. Now, with a waning economy, "our guess is we're having
net out-migration," says Rosemary Scanlon, chief economist
for the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey. This time,
the migration may go beyond the now high-priced suburbs. Ms.
Scanlon notes that Los Angelenos head to Seattle and Arizona.
Employers have sniffed the change. "Housing is the No. 1
criterion now for moving business," she says.</p>
<p>Iowa, for one, makes hay on the trend. It stresses the
"American dream": affordable housing and good schools. A
recent media campaign target: New York. "The quality of life
thing's become more important," says an Iowa spokesman. The
Hawkeye State plays up its schools as a steady source of
educated workers. So far, government data don't reflect
migration from cities; the normal lag has widened while all
efforts focus on the 1990 Census.</p>
<p>Iowa has its eye on insurance, food, biotechnology and
telecommunications industries.</p>
