	<p class="article-leader">HOUSTON -- Coastal Corp. said it named former federal
energy regulator Martha O. Hesse to the board of its
natural-gas pipeline unit.
   Ms. Hesse, chairman of the Federal Energy Regulatory
Commission from October 1986 until November 1989, is now a
senior vice president of First Chicago Corp., a banking
concern. During her stint at FERC, the agency overhauled the
naturalgas and electric industries in an attempt to lessen
regulation.</p>

Energy and Commerce departments and with the U.S. Office of
Management and Budget. In Chicago, she was a co-founder and
chief operating officer of SEI Information Technology, a
dataprocessing consulting concern.</p>
<p>She was named to the board of Coastal's American Natural
Resources Co. unit, which includes the ANR Pipeline Co. Her
