	<p class="article-leader">Safeway Inc., citing improved gross and operating profit,
said net income rose threefold in the second quarter ended
June 16.
   Net rose to $23.6 million, or 25 cents a share, from $7.7
million, or 10 cents a year ago. Sales increased 5% to $3.44
billion from $3.27 billion.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The Oakland, Calif.-based company, which owns a chain of
supermarkets, said its operating profit margin was 3.85% of
sales, compared with 3.24% a year earlier, while interest
expenses declined. Gains in operating profit came from
improved buying, inventory control and mix of products, said
Safeway Vice President David Domeier. "Our ability to buy
better has a big impact on the bottom line," he said,
although he noted the net is a small percentage of sales.</p>
<p>Safeway's stock closed at $16.625, up 50 cents, in New
York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday.</p>
