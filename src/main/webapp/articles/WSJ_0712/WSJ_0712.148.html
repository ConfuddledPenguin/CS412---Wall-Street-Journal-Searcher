	<p class="article-leader">Granada Group PLC reported a 12% slide in pretax profit
for the six months to April 14 and said the slack demand that
slowed the television and leisure group in the first half is
unlikely to abate before the end of the year.
   Pretax profit totaled #63.3 million ($115.4 million), down
from #71.6 million in the first half of the previous
financial year and at the low end of analysts' expectations.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Profit after taxes and minority interests eased 7.7% to
#41.7 million from #45.2 million.</p>
<p>With no extraordinary gains or losses in the period, net
profit attributable to shareholders also stood at #41.7
million, less than half the year-earlier total of #86.1
million. Last year Granada reported a #40.9 million
extraordinary gain, largely on the sale of its majority stake
in Barranquilla Investments PLC.</p>
<p>The group also reported a 13% decline in sales to #763
million from #874 million. The slump had been forecasted by
the company at the time of its annual meeting in March.</p>
