	<p class="article-leader">CUPERTINO, Calif. -- An Apple Computer Inc. software whiz
will quit to start a secretive spinoff company with two
former Apple employees.
   Bill Atkinson, who designed Apple's Hypercard software,
will leave Apple to form General Magic Inc. with former Apple
employees Andy Hertzfeld and Marc Porat, Apple said. General
Magic's founders and Apple won't say what the new company
plans to make, except that it will develop a product that
bears the trademark Personal Intelligent Communicator.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"They have an idea that's under development," said an
Apple spokesman. "We can't tell you anything about it."</p>
<p>Whatever the product is, the ideas come from concepts
created by an Apple development project code-named Paradigm,
Apple said. Apple said it spun out the technologies because
they don't fit the company's mainstream business. Apple will
retain ties with the technology by becoming a minority
investor and the largest corporate shareholder in General
Magic. Apple Chairman John Sculley will serve on General
Magic's board, and Apple has a license to make and market the
spinoff's technologies, Apple said.</p>
<p>Mr. Hertzfeld was a chief developer of Apple's Macintosh
computer, but left the company about five years ago. Mr.
Porat, who left Apple to help start General Magic, was a
high-level engineering manager overseeing the Paradigm
project. Mr. Atkinson will maintain ties with Apple by
becoming an Apple Fellow Emeritus.</p>
