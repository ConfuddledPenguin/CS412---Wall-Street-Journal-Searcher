	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- Five senators came under renewed fire for
their involvement in the savings-and-loan scandal, while
President Bush voiced "great confidence" in the "honor and
integrity" of his son who also is under investigation for his
role in a thrift failure.
   Archibald Cox, chairman of the self-styled citizens' lobby
Common Cause and a onetime Watergate special prosecutor,
argued that the senators -- Alan Cranston (D., Calif.),
Dennis DeConcini (D., Ariz.), John Glenn (D., Ohio), John
McCain (R., Ariz.), and Donald Riegle (D., Mich.) -- violated
the Code of Ethics for Government Service in 1987. The
senators accepted campaign contributions from Charles
Keating, the chairman of Lincoln Savings & Loan's parent
company, and then met with regulators to ask about their
examination of Lincoln.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>In a brief filed with the Senate Ethics Committee, Mr. Cox
said the lawmakers created the "appearance" that they acted
"in an official capacity in response to gifts or other
benefits." Mr. Cox, who served as U.S. solicitor general in
the early 1960s, also asserted the senators violated
provisions of the ethics code that public officials should
"never discriminate unfairly by the dispensing of special
favors or privileges to anyone."</p>
<p>The senators have denied any wrongdoing, arguing that they
were only looking into a constituent's problems, and that
they didn't delay the takeover of Lincoln. Lincoln, based in
Irvine, Calif., was seized by the government in April 1989.
Its failure is expected to cost taxpayers $2 billion.</p>
<p>The ethics committee is investigating the actions of the
senators. Common Cause said it filed the brief "to address
arguments that Senate rules and standards do not explicitly
cover the actions involved."</p>
<p>In a news release, Sen. McCain said Mr. Cox "is simply
saying people should be judged guilty by association." The
other senators couldn't be reached for comment.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Mr. Bush was asked if he agreed with his son,
Neil, who has suggested that savings-and-loan regulators are
conducting a vendetta against him because he is the
president's son. Neil Bush is being investigated by federal
regulators and lawmakers because of his past relationship
with the failed Silverado Banking, Savings & Loan Association
in Denver. Its losses from speculative loans and insider
transactions are expected to cost taxpayers as much as $1
billion.</p>
<p>"As president, I'm determined to stay out of this and let
it {the system} work and let it work fairly," Mr. Bush said.
He added: "I have confidence in the honor and integrity of my
son. And if the system finds he's done something wrong, he
will be the first to step up and do what's right."</p>
