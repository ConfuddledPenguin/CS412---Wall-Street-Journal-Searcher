	<p class="article-leader">HOUSTON -- The leaders of the world's major industrial
nations agreed to a compromise statement on agricultural
trade that U.S. officials said would bolster American efforts
to reduce trade-distorting farm subsidies and could end a
logjam in current international trade talks.
   The statement came at the conclusion of the nations' 16th
annual economic summit, at which the U.S. and its allies also
decided to take divergent approaches on such issues as
providing aid to the Soviet Union and preserving the
environment.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>President Bush cast the summit's results in a positive
light. He said the summit nations had pledged to take
"difficult steps" to conclude a new world trade treaty. And
he said the meeting should please Soviet leader Mikhail
Gorbachev, whom he contacted immediately after the final
session to outline the results. In an ironic sign of the
West's growing stake in Mr. Gorbachev's political survival,
Mr. Bush also congratulated the Soviet leader on his
"landslide" re-election this week as head of the Soviet
Communist Party.</p>
<p>The agreement on agriculture came after more than seven
hours of negotiations concluding early yesterday morning.
Officials from the U.S., Canada, West Germany, France,
Britain, Italy, Japan and the European Community agreed to
assert in part that a future pact on agricultural trade
"should contain specific assurances that . . . participants
would reduce not only internal support but also export
subsidies and import protection in a related way."</p>
<p>"If it's not a breakthrough, it's progress," said U.S.
Trade Representative Carla Hills. She especially cited the
language specifically calling for reduction in the three
types of farm subsidies, internal, export subidies and import
protection. The U.S. has sought a commitment, particularly
from European Community nations, that each of these three
types of subsidy be reduced.</p>
<p>But the language didn't call for the elimination of export
subsidies, something the U.S. has sought. As a result, some
European participants claimed victory.</p>
<p>The president of the European Community, Jacques Delors,
said, "There's no victory, there's only a good compromise."
He said that the EC now is negotiating on all the aspects of
agricultural policy, while the U.S. and others now understand
that agriculture has a special social and political role in
Europe.</p>
<p>President Bush suggested the summit accord will improve
the prospects for a successful conclusion to the current
round of world trade talks being held under the General
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. "Each of us recognizes that
reaching this goal {of successfully concluding the trade
talks} will require difficult steps by all participants," Mr.
Bush said. "We won't hesitate to take them. This is
especially true for agriculture. We are committed by this
declaration to provide the strong political leadership
necessary to ensure a strong and enduring result."</p>
<p>U.S. officials, though, made it clear that much bargaining
lies ahead. "We're going to have a very tough negotiation,"
said Mrs. Hills. "It doesn't mean they've leapt into our
laps."</p>
<p>The world trade talks, which began in Uruguay in 1986, are
set to wind up this December. They are an attempt to extend
the GATT treaty to cover agriculture and textiles and to
address new issues, including intellectual property rights,
services and trade-related investments.</p>
<p>The U.S. side also was pleased that the summiteers
commended to their negotiators a recent text put forward by
the chairman of the GATT agriculture negotiating group, Aart
de Zeeuw.</p>
<p>Some European nations have been leery of that proposal
because it differentiates between various types of
agricultural subsidy. The EC has generally favored grouping
all agricultural subsidies together before reducing them.
Farm-exporting nations such as the U.S., Canada, Argentina
and many other developing countries fear that would lead to a
failure to address export subsidies and price supports, which
many economists believe most distort trade.</p>
<p>On many issues, the summit leaders glossed over
differences they brought to the meeting. Though they spent
much time discussing conditions in the Soviet Union, they
were unable to agree on a common strategy for aiding Mr.
Gorbachev's beleaguered economy, except to applaud his
restructuring program and to continue to offer him "technical
assistance" in moving toward a market-oriented economy.
Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady characterized the
discussions about assistance to the Soviet Union as "very
positive."</p>
<p>The group resisted West Germany's request to join now in a
united package of direct aid to the Soviets. On Tuesday, the
group agreed to commission a study of the Soviet economy by a
group of international financial institutions. That study,
which probably will be led by the International Monetary
Fund, would provide "the criteria for any assistance, so long
as we can ensure it's properly targeted," said British Prime
Minister Margaret Thatcher.</p>
<p>In a meeting with reporters, President Bush forcefully
ruled out direct aid until the Soviets restructure their
economy, scale back their military arsenal and reduce their
support for left-wing dictatorships.</p>
<p>"We're going to try in every way to facilitate that reform
because we are in a different age," the president said. "But
we have some problems. I'm not particularly enthusiastic
about the {Soviet} intercontinental ballistic missiles aimed
at U.S. cities. I find it a little contradictory to think
that they will continue to spend $5 billion a year for Cuba."</p>
<p>Several leaders said their differences reflect that the
world has become more secure. "With the threat from the
Soviet world considerably reduced, because of that Europe is
more able to assert its personality," said French President
Francois Mitterrand. But he added: "We don't want a situation
in which the EC exercises a sort of competitive leadership
with the U.S."</p>
<p>The other leading topic at the summit was the environment.
The summit leaders, as they did on Soviet aid, agreed to
several minimum common goals while opting to pursue their own
domestic strategies for curbing pollution and preserving the
environment.</p>
<p>The final communique singled out global climate change as
a subject of "key importance" and committed the nations to
"undertake common efforts to limit emissions of greenhouse
gases such as carbon dioxide." Many scientists believe that
the buildup of such gases in the atmosphere is causing an
increase in the Earth's temperature. West Germany has
committed itself to a 25% reduction in the level of carbon
dioxide emissions by the year 2000. But the other summit
countries won't adopt such stringent goals without additional
research, and the communique didn't set a specific target for
the group.</p>
<p>The communique also called for additional research on
climate change and for a phase-out of chlorofluorocarbons,
which are believed to reduce the earth's protective ozone
layer, by the year 2000. The leaders also pledged to help
developing nations preserve tropical rain forests and to
develop strategies for reforestation. And they promised to
launch negotiations aimed at a world agreement by 1992 to
preserve forest land.</p>
<p>U.S. environmentalists complained that the leaders
deliberately had played down environmental issues. Mr. Bush
dismissed the accusation, saying, "On the environmental
extreme, they don't want this country to grow." But even some
summit leaders acknowledged that there is much left to do.
Commenting on greenhouse gases and carbon dioxide emissions,
Mrs. Thatcher said: "That's the part we haven't really
tackled yet, that's the part that's difficult."</p>
<p>The 17-page communique commended the movement toward
free-market democracies in Eastern Europe and toward greater
European integration. It also welcomed a unified Germany and
advocated more discipline to curb trade-distorting
export-credit subsidies.</p>
<p>The summit praised the current system of international
economic policy coordination, endorsed current international
debt strategy and commended the recently announced U.S.
initiative to help Latin American countries. The U.S. expects
other nations will support the initiative, but they need time
to study it, Mr. Brady noted. As a gesture to debtor
countries making strong economic reform efforts, the summit
also encouraged the Paris Club, a group of western creditor
nations, to lengthen the repayment period on government
credits.</p>
<p>And in a nod to Japan, the summit took note of the
importance to that country of "a peaceful resolution of its
dispute with the Soviet Union over the northern territories,"
some small islands seized by the Russians in 1945.</p>
