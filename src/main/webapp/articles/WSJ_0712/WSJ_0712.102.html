	<p class="article-leader">A former Warner Communications Inc. shareholder filed a
lawsuit in Delaware Chancery Court against Time Warner Inc.
alleging the shareholders were deprived of appraisal rights
when Time Inc. acquired Warner earlier this year.
   The lawsuit, filed July 9, alleges that Time "misled
shareholders into believing they didn't have appraisal
rights," according to David Brower, an attorney representing
the shareholder, Howard S. Klotz.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Mr. Klotz, however, asserts that Warner shareholders
indeed have such rights and, Mr. Brower said, "if appraisal
rights were to take place, Warner shareholders would get more
money."</p>
<p>Mr. Brower said Mr. Klotz was "acting on behalf of all
Warner shareholders," and that he would seek class-action
status for the suit.</p>
<p>A spokeswoman for Time Warner said the company had not
seen the suit and couldn't comment.</p>
