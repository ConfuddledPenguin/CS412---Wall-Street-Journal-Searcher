	<p class="article-leader">PITTSBURGH -- Allegheny Ludlum Corp. said Robert P.
Bozzone, president and chief operating officer, was named
chief executive officer of this specialty steel producer.
   The specialty metals producer also declared a 3-for-2
stock split and increased its dividend to 33 cents a share
from 30 cents.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Mr. Bozzone, 57 years old, succeeds Richard P. Simmons,
59, who continues as chairman and chairman of the executive
committee. Mr. Simmons will concentrate on strategy,
acquisitions and management succession.</p>
<p>A graduate of Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, Mr.
Bozzone started at the company in 1955 as a metallurgist. He
held several management operating posts prior to being named
president and chief operating officer in 1985.</p>
<p>Both the split and dividend are payable July 2 to stock of
record June 8. Following the split, the quarterly dividend
will be 22 cents a common share. On a pre-split annual basis,
the dividend is increased to $1.32 a share from $1.20 a
share. The company said the dividend was raised because
"business has been stronger than anticipated." The split will
increase the number of the company's common shares
outstanding to 33,494,000 from 22,329,800.</p>
<p>Separately, Allegheny Ludlum said it agreed to acquire the
operating assets of Thinsheet Metals Co., a closely held
metals re-rolling concern with facilities in Waterbury, Conn.
The company has about 60 employees. Terms weren't disclosed.
The acquisition is expected to be completed later this
summer, the company said.</p>
