	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Bond markets world-wide are starting to spring
back to life after a long and painful slide.
   Bond prices this month have climbed around the world, due
in part to a rebound in foreign currencies against the U.S.
dollar and perceptions that interest rates in most countries
may have peaked. Meanwhile, investors are flocking to mutual
funds that buy bonds in countries from France to Japan.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The ticket to how long the rally lasts may be West
Germany, where forecasts of higher interest rates remain
common.</p>
<p>Last week's prices of British government bonds surged in
the biggest rally in 2 1/2 years with prices of long-term
bonds rising as much as four points, a gain of about 40
pounds for a bond with a #1,000 face amount.</p>
<p>"This has been the best month for international bonds
since July 1989," said Victor S. Filatov, an executive vice
president at J.P. Morgan & Co. So far in May, he said, the
total returns on foreign bonds have outperformed U.S. bonds
by an average of four percentage points.</p>
<p>When measured in U.S. dollars, British government bonds
have produced a total return of 8.52% so far this month,
according to J.P. Morgan. That compares with total returns of
7.39% for Japanese bonds, 3.16% for Australian bonds and
2.29% for French bonds and 2.01% for U.S. bonds.</p>
<p>These high total returns were due in part to a significant
decline in the value of the U.S. dollar on foreign-exchange
markets. For example, at the beginning of May when it took
159 yen to buy one U.S. dollar, a Japanese bond valued at
100,000 yen would have cost $629. But last week, after the
dollar had fallen to 153 yen, the value of that same bond
rose to $654 due to currency exchange. But in addition to
currency gains, investors in foreign bonds also have enjoyed
large capital gains as bond prices rose.</p>
<p>The turnaround in the global bond market is just beginning
to show up in mutual fund performance statistics. According
to Lipper Analytical Services, world income mutual funds --
which invest primarily in U.S. and non-U.S. fixed-income
securities -- eked out a small total return of just 0.15% for
the week ended May 3. That was a big change, however, from
the previous week when the funds turned in a total return of
negative 0.45%.</p>
<p>But whether the global bond rally continues depends
largely upon events still developing in West Germany, which
is in the process of merging with East Germany. The cost of
reunification between the two countries will be enormous.
Economists believe West Germany will issue record amounts of
new bonds to finance the union with financially troubled East
Germany. There's also inflationary potential in the currency
combination.</p>
<p>To attract buyers for the new bonds, economists say, West
Germany probably will be forced this year to boost bond
yields to 9.5% from a current level of around 8.5%.</p>
<p>"We are a little nervous about the path of European
rates," because of West Germany, said David Boardman, a
portfolio manager at Rowe Price Fleming International Inc.,
London. If West German rates rise, "it could stop the French
market from rallying further," he said. Interest rates in
many European countries track West German rates.</p>
<p>Such concerns haven't kept investors -- both large and
small -- from diving back into global bonds. Mr. Boardman
said his international mutual fund, which caters primarily to
U.S. investors, has been getting $1 million to $2 million in
assets each day -- a sign that investors believe that
international bonds offer a great deal of promise.</p>
<p>Mr. Filatov also notices a changing attitude among U.S.
investors toward foreign bonds. "The political and economic
uncertainties kept many investors on the sidelines" for most
of the year, he said. "The uncertainty is going away and
investors are beginning to find the fundamentals very
appealing."</p>
<p>Mr. Boardman isn't expanding his position in most European
bonds. Instead, he's moving into Australia and New Zealand.
"These markets were beaten up pretty bad last year but now
are benefiting from falling interest rates due to lower
inflation expectations." Investors in these bonds also get
high current yield, because interest rates -- while falling
-- are still much higher than in many European countries.
Yields on Australia's benchmark 10-year government bond, for
example, have fallen 1/4 percentage point in the past few
weeks but remain at a lofty 13.50%.</p>
<p>Thomas Prapas, managing director of fixed-income
investments at Clemente Capital Corp., likes French, Spanish,
Irish, Swedish and Italian bonds. "All those markets are
attractive. Most of these countries have inflation that has
been coming down, while West Germany's is going up," he said.
Mr. Prapas agrees with other analysts that events in West
Germany could hurt these markets in the short term. But he
says, "we're looking at this market over the next six months.
If West Germany decides to raise interest rates, that will
hurt a little bit in the near term, but the long-term looks
very good."</p>
<p>At Salomon Brothers Inc., international analysts are
preaching caution. In its latest report on the global market,
Salomon said the May rally "may soon enter a consolidation
phase." The principal exception is Britain, where bond market
sentiment could remain euphoric. Salomon said yields on
Britain's 10-year notes "could test 11.50%." The yield, which
was 13% at the end of April, was 12% on Friday.</p>
<p>Britain's bond-market rally was triggered by reports that
the United Kingdom might be on the verge of joining the
"exchange rate mechanism" of the European Monetary System --
an agreement designed to stabilize European Community
currencies.</p>
<p>To become a member, some analysts believe that Britain
must reduce inflation, which has been running between 7% and
10% in recent years but was running at an annual rate of 9.4%
in April.</p>
<p>Last week's rally in the British government securities
market capped a steady climb in the market that has pushed
yields one percentage point lower in one month. However, some
analysts are skeptical about any near-term entry of sterling
into the ERM and contend the recent rally has been overdone.</p>
<p>The British rally also was supported by a labor report
that said that U.K. unemployment rose in April for the first
time since 1986.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>Friday's Market Activity</p>
<p>Buyers flooded the junk bond market, sparking the
strongest rally that market has had in weeks.</p>
<p>Most junk bonds, high-yielding speculative-grade
securities with low credit ratings or no credit ratings at
all, gained between 1/2 point to 3/4 point. That was an
impressive showing considering prices of investment-grade
corporate bonds and most Treasury securities fell between 1/4
and 1/2 point.</p>
<p>Buying interest in junk was broadbased, and included a
wide variety of issues.</p>
<p>Among the leading winners: the pay-in-kind bonds of RJR
Nabisco Inc. The tobacco and food company's 14.07%
convertible pay-in-kind debentures chalked up one point to
end at 84 1/8.</p>
<p>The other widely held RJR issue, the 14.07% exchangeable
debentures, due in 2007, climbed 1 3/8 to end at 71.</p>
<p>Also higher were recently depressed bonds of R.H. Macy &
Co. Macy's 14 1/2% senior subordinated debentures, maturing
in 1998, advanced 1 1/2 points to 75 1/2, and its 14 1/2%
subordinated debentures, due in 2001, added 1 1/2 points to
end at 65 1/2.</p>
<p>But investors said liquidity in the $200 billion market
remains a problem.</p>
<p>"It's all bids and no offereds," said Dan Smith, a
portfolio manager at Lisle, Ill.-based Van Kampen Merritt
Inc. "You'll start out 96 1/2 bid and none offered, and
prices will creep up till you get a two-sided market."</p>
<p>Junk-bond prices rose steadily during all of last week as
prospects of declining interest rates have heartened
junk-bond investors.</p>
<p>According to First Boston Corp.'s high-yield index,
junk-bond issues have generated a 2% total return so far this
month. Advancing issues outnumbered declining issues by a
ratio of two to one, First Boston said.</p>
<p>Sam DeRosa-Farag, a high-yield analyst at First Boston,
said zero-coupon bonds continued to outperform cash-paying
bonds this month.</p>
<p>"Zero-coupon bonds tend to have higher returns in a bull
market and worse returns in a bear market," said Mr.
DeRosa-Farag. Strength in zero-coupon bonds is often
considered a gauge of investor confidence. When investors are
less skittish about the market, they are more inclined to
invest in junior securities like zero-coupon and pay-in-kind
bonds.</p>
<p>Among the zero-coupon issues that gained Friday were
Hospital Corp. of America bonds, which moved up one point to
end at 71, and Owens-Illinois Inc.'s zero-coupon bonds, which
surged 1 1/2 points to end at 50 1/2. Bonds of both Hospital
Corp. and Owens-Illinois have advanced this week on positive
earnings reports.</p>
<p>In the Treasury market, bond prices ended as much as 1/2
point lower in quiet trading.</p>
<p>Friday's quiet trading stood in sharp contrast to hectic
dealing a week earlier that saw the new bellwether 30-year
bond surge more than 2 points.</p>
<p>In late trading, the benchmark bond was quoted at 100
18/32, down 1/2 point on the day to yield 8.69%. In
when-issued trading activity, the new two-year notes to be
auctioned Wednesday were quoted to yield 8.62%, up slightly
from 8.58% on Thursday. The new five-year notes to be
auctioned Thursday were quoted at a yield of 8.69%, up from
8.64%.</p>
<p>The price slide started late in the morning when the
Federal Reserve executed weekend matched sale-purchase
agreements, a technical trading operation that drains
reserves out of the banking system and tends to keep interest
rates up. Investors saw the move as an effort on the Fed's
part to keep the closely watched federal funds rate near the
Fed's widely perceived 8 1/4% target level. The rate is what
banks charge each other on short-term loans.</p>
