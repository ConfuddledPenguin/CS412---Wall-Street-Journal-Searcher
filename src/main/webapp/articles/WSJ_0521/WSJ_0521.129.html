	<p class="article-leader">A Delaware court denied a request by investor Stanley
Stahl seeking to compel New York-based Apple Bancorp to hold
its 1990 meeting for shareholders on or before June 16.
   Mr. Stahl, who controls 31% of Apple's shares, is waging a
proxy fight to gain control of Apple's board. A New York
real-estate investor, Mr. Stahl has offered $38 a share, or
$121.6 million, for all of the bank's shares that he doesn't
own.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Apple's board has rejected that offer as inadequate, and
investors apparently think either Mr. Stahl will sweeten his
offer, or another bidder will emerge. On Friday, Apple shares
closed at $44.625 a share, unchanged, in composite New York
Stock Exchange trading.</p>
<p>Apple hasn't set a date for its annual meeting in order to
allow time to explore alternatives to Mr. Stahl's offer.</p>
