	<p class="article-leader">Forget Robert Mapplethorpe and Andres Serrano's
"body-fluid art." Have you seen what they're showing to the
public at the New Orleans Museum of Art in an exhibition
called Awards in the Visual Arts? Yes, it is funded by the
National Endowment for the Arts, with additional money from
BMW of North America and the Rockefeller Foundation. The pity
is that it won't cause the outcry heard over Serrano's
crucifix in urine or the most marginal Mapplethorpe
photographs. That is because, with a few exceptions, the
visual arts awards are so awful. They don't shock or amuse or
inspire or do much of anything.
   There are indeed serious issues involved in the dispute
over the charges that NEA has occasionally funded obscenity.
But this controversy has overshadowed an issue that is more
relevant to NEA's proper role and the state of art in
America.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The problem isn't obscenity. The problem is mediocrity.</p>
<p>Too much of the art produced in the United States now,
much of it with direct or indirect public subsidy, is simply
bad art. Indeed it is accorded status as art only because the
current art establishment -- the NEA, academics, some
curators, many newspaper art critics -- perpetuates the idea
that this work isn't the arid drivel it appears to be, but is
something serious. Not everyone agrees.</p>
<p>In a remarkable op-ed piece in the New York Times last
July, the well-known American painter Helen Frankenthaler
argued that notwithstanding the incendiary issues of Serrano
and Mapplethorpe, more attention ought to be directed at what
she called a "mediocre art enterprise."</p>
<p>As a member of an NEA advisory council, Ms. Frankenthaler
said, "I myself find the council -- the recommendations of
the panels and the grants given -- of increasingly dubious
quality. . . . I see more and more nondeserving recipients. I
feel there was a time when I experienced loftier minds,
relatively unloaded with politics, fashion and chic."</p>
<p>Well, of course Ms. Frankenthaler's plea for the
restoration of quality sank like a stone. Behaving like some
threatened bricklayers' union, the arts establishment has
locked arms to oppose anyone who dissents from the orthodoxy
they've imposed on American art.</p>
<p>And it is indeed an orthodoxy, though of a most unusual
sort. The artist's work, no matter how reductionist or
outrageous, has to be "understood." If they have created a
movement, it would have to be called hyper-solipsism. The new
school of criticism that has grown up with it is relentlessly
empathetic. This is from a very prominent newspaper critic's
review of Mr. Serrano:</p>
<p>"One of the more alarming aspects of the attack on the
endowment has been the assumption of many of those doing the
condemning that there is no responsibility to consider the
art as it was meant to be seen." He ends, "how can anyone
find in his work just obscenity and disrespect? It is hard to
believe that anyone whose faith is searching and secure would
not be grateful for what Mr. Serrano has done." Few critics
or administrators today would break ranks intellectually from
this orthodoxy. The director of the Corcoran in Washington,
who dissented from the majority on Mapplethorpe, was driven
from her job.</p>
<p>We are not reopening the familiar debate over modernity
and American society. Modern, or avant-garde work, is not the
problem. The problem is that the artists and intellectuals
who cry "free expression" to disallow any forceful critique
of their enterprise have achieved so little with their
freedom. Nor is it the publicly funded artists alone whose
achievement is so insubstantial.</p>
<p>The Pulitzer Prize committee can barely scrape up one
drama annually to bless. New music remains adamantly abstruse
and off-putting. It is interesting to note that rock music,
which has never received a dime of public money, continues to
produce young groups that are at least vital.</p>
<p>The NEA and its supporters are now posing themselves as
the fragile angel of creative inspiration, beset by
right-wing yahoos, philistines and Bible thumpers. In fact,
the NEA is mainly a bureaucracy. Worse, it is a Washington
bureaucracy, and hundreds of artists, writers and their
sponsors have become its dependent beneficiaries.</p>
<p>Some Members of Congress are talking about a revised grant
system that would essentially disburse blocs of money to
state arts agencies, which would make the individual grants.
That doesn't immediately solve the kinds of problems
discussed here, but it moves the issue in the right
direction. For instance, it might deflate the Mapplethorpe
problem. There is no good reason why a Cincinnati should be
held up to ridicule because it doesn't subscribe to every
last quirk of the life style in Manhattan.</p>
<p>At the least, turning authority over to the states would
get the decision-making debate over money and values out in
the country, which is where it belongs.</p>
