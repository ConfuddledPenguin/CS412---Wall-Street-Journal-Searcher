	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- How long is forever?
   In the case of the Omaha, Neb., billionaire Warren E.
Buffett, who has said of his stock investments, "Our favorite
holding period is forever," the end may be nearer than you
think.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The talk among some Wall Street merger specialists -- they
have lots of time to talk these days -- is that Mr. Buffett
has asked Salomon Brothers to explore the possible sale of
his 44% stake in Geico, a highly profitable auto and
homeowners insurance company.</p>
<p>Insurance industry executives who know Mr. Buffett and
Geico say the merger specialists are only half right. They
say that something does seem to be up at the insurance
company, but that the various possible outcomes are unlikely
to involve an outright sale of the 44% Geico stake held by
Berkshire Hathaway, which Mr. Buffett controls.</p>
<p>John Gutfreund, chairman of Salomon, is personally
involved in the project, the merger folks believe, probably
because Mr. Buffett, through Berkshire Hathaway, also owns
13% of Salomon.</p>
<p>Mr. Buffett didn't return phone calls last week seeking
comment on these reports. Neither did Mr. Gutfreund or
William Snyder, chairman of Geico. A Geico spokesman declined
to comment.</p>
<p>Buffett buffs point to a sentence that has appeared in the
annual report of Berkshire Hathaway for the past seven years:
"Regardless of price, we have no interest at all in selling
any good businesses that Berkshire owns."</p>
<p>But the insurance executives familiar with Geico
acknowledge that something is up at the company and that a
change in Mr. Buffett's ownership position -- most likely,
but not necessarily, a decrease -- could result.</p>
<p>The merger-makers are salivating at the size of a
potential transaction. Mr. Buffett's 6.85 million Geico
shares, for which he paid $45.7 million between 1976 and
1981, have an indicated market value of about $1.03 billion
at Friday's closing price of $150.50 a share. The stock
market value of all Geico shares is about $2.32 billion. A
buyer of Mr. Buffett's block or the entire company would be
likely to pay a premium above the market price.</p>
<p>Despite Wall Street's excitement about a possible sale,
insurance industry executives say that whatever changes are
brewing in the Buffett-Geico relationship don't stem from any
dissatisfaction on Mr. Buffett's part with Geico. Rather, the
executives say, any change is more likely to reflect an
effort by Geico's management to keep the company's strong
return on equity from eroding.</p>
<p>In a sense, Geico has been too successful for its own
good. The company's basic auto insurance business -- policies
sold to good drivers by phone and mail -- has helped generate
23% annual growth in per-share earnings over the past five
years. Though that growth is slowing, analysts still expect
growth of about 15% a year.</p>
<p>Retained earnings are piling up fast; Geico's per-share
earnings last year of $13.74 far outstripped its current
$2-a-year dividend rate. This increasing equity base makes it
tougher to produce an impressive return-on-equity figure.</p>
<p>Geico managers "have some real hard thinking to do right
now," Gerald Lewinsohn, a Merrill Lynch insurance analyst,
says. "If they just sit where they are and continue
disciplined underwriting, the company's return on equity is
going to fall."</p>
<p>The company's basic strategy of avoiding high-risk drivers
limits its growth. And its modest attempts to diversify into
reinsurance or to expand its life insurance sales have been
disappointing.</p>
<p>One way to boost return on equity, of course, would be to
limit the growth of shareholders' equity by paying bigger
dividends. Geico, in fact, increased its quarterly dividend
to 50 cents a share from 45 cents in February.</p>
<p>Another way to improve returns is to buy back stock, which
Geico also has been doing. But the company hasn't found
long-term holders in any rush to part with their shares.</p>
<p>All this leads some investment bankers and insurance
executives to conclude that Geico might offer to buy back
some of Mr. Buffett's shares, perhaps as part of a tender
offer for part of its stock. Though it might seem logical for
Geico to try to buy out Mr. Buffett entirely, Merrill Lynch's
Mr. Lewinsohn says Geico couldn't afford a buy-back that big.</p>
<p>Yet another option would be for Mr. Buffett, through
Berkshire Hathaway, to offer to buy out the remaining public
shareholders. At $200 a share, which is what Mr. Lewinsohn
believes Geico is worth, that would cost about $1.71 billion.</p>
<p>Berkshire Hathaway could certainly raise the money. But
Mr. Buffett hasn't become a billionaire by paying full price
for mature companies.</p>
