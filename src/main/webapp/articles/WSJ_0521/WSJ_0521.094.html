	<p class="article-leader">GREENBELT, Md. -- The Hubble Space Telescope took its
first photos of the universe, ending fears that it was
becoming a space turkey and offering hope that it may become
the space masterpiece promised instead.
   The orbiting telescope has been plagued by software
problems, jittery hardware and human error since it was
launched April 24. But yesterday, it aimed its main camera at
a nearby star cluster, known as NGC 3532, and relayed back
some striking shots. The space telescope was able to discern
that an image, which looked like an oblong blob in a photo
taken recently by a big telescope in Chile, was instead two
stars orbiting near each other.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"This is as good or better than {images} I've seen at Mt.
Palomar," said James Westphal, the Hubble astronomer in
charge of the camera, referring to the big California
observatory.</p>
<p>But the telescope -- at about $2.5 billion, the most
expensive spacecraft ever built -- still must improve
significantly to reach the ambitious goals set out for it by
the National Aeronautics and Space Administration. Space
agency officials have bragged that the telescope will be able
to pinpoint objects 25 times dimmer than those seen from
Earth and see back nearly to the time of the Big Bang.
Astronomers want to use that power to measure the age of the
universe more precisely and to search for such exotic
phenomena as black holes -- gravitational masses that swallow
any stars unfortunate enough to be in the way.</p>
<p>But before it starts those searches, NASA must upgrade the
telescope's focus by a factor of seven, Hubble scientists
said, and reduce the telescope's jitters by a factor of 10.
NASA has plans to accomplish both, and expects to start using
the telescope for scientific exploration in about 2 1/2
months.</p>
<p>Yesterday was a kind of christening for the telescope,
which astronomers call "first light." It was the first time
the telescope was used to record and transmit images to the
ground; it was also a test of how well the telescope is able
to focus using relatively coarse adjustments. With first
light, said Duccio Macchetto, one of the telescope's
principal scientists, "You know you have something that
works."</p>
<p>Hubble scientists and the press congregated around video
monitors at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center, which
controls the spacecraft from the ground. All the scientists
professed confidence in the telescope, but as first light
arrived, their bravura faded.</p>
<p>"Oh damn, I can't see from here," snapped John Bahcall, a
grey-haired astronomer wearing Reeboks who lobbied NASA and
Congress for years to build the telescope. After changing his
seat, he sat transfixed as the images appeared on the screen.
Edward Weiler, another Hubble veteran, rolled his tongue
compulsively, and called over to Mr. Bahcall: "We're almost
there, John."</p>
<p>The screen showed Mr. Westphal, an elfin man with a white
crew-cut and white beard, working on the images at a computer
terminal with two assistants elsewhere at Goddard. When it
became clear that the pictures were twice as good as
expected, tension turned to good cheer.</p>
<p>Afterwards, Mr. Bahcall congratulated Jean Olivier, the
NASA official in charge of the test, and speculated that Mr.
Olivier may have underestimated how well the telescope would
perform to make the results look better. Both he and Mr.
Oliver hail from Shreveport, La., Mr. Bahcall said, and
"That's the way we Louisiana boys do it."</p>
