	<p class="article-leader">RICHLAND, Wash. -- Washington Public Power Supply System
said it plans to sell $600 million of refunding revenue bonds
in the first week of June.
   WPPSS defaulted in 1983 on $2.25 billion of bonds, the
largest default in municipal bond history. This will be its
second bond sale this year. The new securities, which will
range in maturity from two years to 27 years, involve WPPSS
units 2 and 3, which didn't default. First Boston Corp. is
senior manager.</p>
