	<p class="article-leader">Pan Am Corp. put its Northeast shuttle up for sale just
weeks after its only competitor in that busy market, the
Trump Shuttle, went on the block. But it may be some time
before travelers see a change in the shuttle carriers.
   An airline or other buyer would face equal, though
somewhat different hurdles. The Department of Transportation
is likely to cast a watchful eye on the bidding. In the past,
the agency has stepped in to force competition in the shuttle
market. At the same time, transportation officials are wary
of the growing dominance of just a handful of carriers.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The carriers with the resources to buy either shuttle,
including Fort Worth, Texas-based AMR Corp.'s American
Airlines unit and Atlanta-based Delta Air Lines, also happen
to be among the most dominant. It is questionable whether the
agency will allow these expansion-minded carriers to gobble
up the shuttle routes as well. New York-based Pan Am hopes to
get at least $250 million to $300 million for its shuttle,
which it bought for $65 million in 1986.</p>
<p>A potential buyer probably wouldn't have clear financial
flying, either. The market is poor for financing buy-outs.
Even investors who manage to obtain financing could well
experience the same problems that have caused the New York
real estate developer and casino owner Donald Trump to want
to sell his shuttle just one year after he bought it for $365
million from Houston-based Texas Air Corp.'s Eastern Airlines
unit, now in bankruptcy-law proceedings.</p>
<p>Though the shuttle earned about $20 million a year under
Eastern, Mr. Trump has been unable to generate enough cash
flow to pay his debt service and turn a profit.</p>
<p>The shuttle market itself has some quirks. Traffic between
the New York, Washington, D.C., and Boston destinations isn't
expected to grow much beyond the annual estimated total of
four million passengers.</p>
<p>It is an expensive operation. The aircraft require high
maintenance because of the frequent take-offs and landings
they endure. Both shuttle airlines have to maintain backup
crews and aircraft, because every passenger is guaranteed a
seat without a reservation and departures are hourly. When
flights are delayed, it isn't unusual for one aircraft to
take off full, while another takes off almost empty just a
few minutes later.</p>
<p>Still, both shuttle carriers have valuable attributes, not
the least of which is the landing slots and gate space they
hold at New York's LaGuardia Airport and Washington's
National Airport. Landing rights at those two airports are
controlled. The only way new carriers can acquire those
rights and gate space is to buy it from carriers who have
them now.</p>
<p>Though the shuttle market isn't expected to grow, it isn't
expected to decline, either. Business travelers use it the
most. Therefore, it isn't affected as much as the leisure
travel market in times of economic slowdowns. Shuttle fares
have remained immune to the price cutting that has affected
other routes. Analysts say service and fares aren't likely to
change if new owners take over either shuttle.</p>
<p>Prospective buyers have come forward in the past. The Los
Angeles investor Marvin Davis is said to have considered
buying the Eastern shuttle, but never formally bid. America
West Airlines, Phoenix, Ariz., said it wanted to buy the
shuttle last year, but was unable to obtain financing. Mr.
Davis couldn't be reached to comment. An America West
spokesman said the airline remains interested in making
acquisitions.</p>
<p>A former Pan Am chairman, C. Edward Acker, is said to be
interested in Pan Am's shuttle, which the airline took over
under his tenure. Mr. Acker couldn't be reached.</p>
<p>Of the two shuttles, Mr. Trump's probably would fetch a
higher price. Besides the gates and landing slots, Mr. Trump
owns all of the aircraft that travel the routes. Pan Am
leases its shuttle aircraft. Also, Mr. Trump made several
improvements to the former Eastern aircraft, including
installing engine "hush kits" and fancier lavatories.
However, Mr. Trump might not be able to recoup his initial
investment because he took on heavy debt to finance the
shuttle purchase and make the improvements.</p>
<p>Eastern began the first shuttle operation in 1961 and
operated it largely without competition until 1980, when New
York Air, a unit of Texas Air, entered the market. When Texas
Air acquired Eastern in 1986, the Transportation Department
insisted Texas Air sell one of the shuttles. Pan Am took over
the former New York Air service.</p>
<p>Pan Am's decision to sell the shuttle, one of its few
profitable operations, reflects its worsening financial
condition. Pan is seeking a cash infusion from the sale to
continue operating its Pan American World Airways routes to
Europe and South America. The airline also needs cash to
continue making improvements in its service, aircraft
maintenance and security systems.</p>
<p>The Pan American unit is down to $56 million in cash on
hand, according to the company's first-quarter financial
reports. Pan Am also said it is putting its internal German
route system up for sale.</p>
<p>In New York Stock Exchange composite trading Friday, Pan
Am shares closed at $2.50, unchanged.</p>
