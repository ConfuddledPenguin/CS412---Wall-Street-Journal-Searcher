	<p class="article-leader">Lindley H. Clark Jr.'s April 19 editorial-page column,
"Indexation May Be Bad for Us," implies that tax indexing
somehow increases the chances of high inflation. That's
absurd.
   An unindexed tax system gives politicians an incentive to
continue or increase inflation. At current inflation rates, a
repeal of tax indexing would increase taxes by $140 billion
over the next four years. Does anyone seriously believe that
the hidden tax increases caused by repeal of indexing would
end inflation? It certainly didn't work in the 1970s.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The politicians who create inflation would be the biggest
beneficiaries. After repealing indexing, politicians could
"cut" taxes by $100 billion over the four-year period, spend
the $40 billion difference on pet projects, and look like
heroes to their constituents.</p>
<p>By taking the political profit out of inflation, tax
indexing helps control it. If there's an indexing culprit, it
is the indexation of congressional, high-ranking executive
branch and Federal Reserve officials' salaries. Consideration
should be given to rewarding the Federal Reserve officials
for low and steady rates of inflation.</p>
