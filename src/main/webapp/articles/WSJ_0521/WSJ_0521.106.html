	<p class="article-leader">Entergy Corp. said the New Orleans City Council voted to
reject a buy-out plan under which the city could have
acquired the company's New Orleans Public Service Inc. unit
and certain other properties for more than $700 million.
   The utility holding company previously said it would
rather not sell the assets. The buy-out plan was made under a
longstanding "perpetual right" held by the city allowing it
to purchase New Orleans Public Service assets at any time.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Under the proposal, the utility would have become city
property, but Entergy management would have continued to
operate it for five years. New Orleans Public Service
provides electricity to about 192,000 customers and gas to
about 159,000 customers in that city.</p>
<p>A proposed financing package called for the issuance of
more than $850 million of revenue bonds, on which payments
would be about $8 million a month for 20 years. A council
advisory committee estimated that consumers would save about
$8 a month under the plan.</p>
