	<p class="article-leader">Las Vegas, Nev. -- If one accepts the fact that not
everybody can be -- or should want to be -- Popeye, 12 pretty
good rounds of fisticuffs occured in the big shed behind
Caesars Palace here Saturday night. They were produced by
blade-keen Pernell "Sweetpea" Whitaker, a lightweight
champion with a proper lightweight's mentality. This is to
say that he sees his job as hitting the other guy without
being hit in return.
   Whitaker, from Norfolk, Va., played matador to Azumah
Nelson's bull, Nelson, from Ghana, being a big man in a
little man's body. The fight's pattern was the same from
opening to closing bell, with Nelson charging and Whitaker
parrying. The left-hander stuck his right jab into Nelson's
goatee about 500 times, and whapped his left into his foe's
ribs with about the same frequency. And when Nelson managed
to get too close for comfort, Whitaker did the Sweetpea thing
and ducked or slipped away.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The result wasn't pleasing to all of the 4,000 or so souls
who witnessed it; a guy sitting behind me, for example, kept
exhorting Whitaker to stand and fight. That, of course, was
easy for him to say, which is the essence of fandom, and
Whitaker was too busy at the time to reply. But, later, his
trainer, George Benton, took the trouble to explain.</p>
<p>"We told Pea to fight him (Nelson) like he had bad breath,
and Pea followed the plan to a `T'," grinned Benton. "We
thought we'd win this one any way we could, and look good the
next time."</p>
<p>I thought Whitaker looked plenty good this time, good
enough to win every round on merit save, maybe, the last two.
In fact, he had a point -- and, thus, the 12th round taken
from him by referee Mills Lane, who objected to his grabbing
and lifting Nelson's leg as the fighters clinched in the late
going. Whitaker who gets clownish if he's sure of a decision,
must have learned that trick from Harpo Marx. To place any
other rounds in Nelson's column, one had to value aggression
for its own sake.</p>
<p>And in fact -- and as anyone familiar with these things
probably has already guessed -- two of the three judges did
just that, making Whitaker's victory margin a spare two
points. In case you might be tempted to buy a used car from
them, their names are Harry Gibbs and Sid Nathan. Judge Dalby
Shirley displayed a tighter grip on reality by scoring it
116-111 for Whitaker, or nine rounds to three.</p>
<p>The switcheroo in this fight was that Nelson, the fella
who did the pursuing, was stepping up to the 135-pound
lightweight class. He came in as the World Boxing Council's
super-featherweight (130-pound) champ, and that title, in
turn, had been a step upward from the featherweights, where
he'd campaigned for most of his 11-year professional career.</p>
<p>The 31-year-old Nelson's stock in trade is power, as
attested by his 24 knockouts (and 32 wins) in 33 previous
bouts. Although normally well mannered, the African
participated in the fight's hype by allowing promoter Don
King to portray him as someone who'd been eating raw meat and
fighting lions with a switch, and by entering the ring in
leopard-spotted trunks and shoes. His own contribution to
press conference nonsense on Thursday was the observation
that Whitaker's "bones are too soft to beat someone like me."</p>
<p>Whatever its texture, Whitaker's frame was sufficiently
sturdy to support world's lightweight championship belts
conferred by the WBC and International Boxing Federation, (if
you're scoring, that's two of the ungoverned sport's four
governing outfits), and it was his titles that were on the
line Saturday. They are just the latest in a long list of
baubles captured by the swift 26-year-old.</p>
<p>Whitaker was a member of the 1984 U.S. Olympic boxing
squad, and his gold medal, at 132 pounds, was one of that
crew's record haul. If some of his teammates' titles were
devalued by the Soviet-bloc boycott, his was not, because
he'd beaten the best of the Cuban and East European fighters
in winning gold medals at the 1983 World Championships and
the Pan-American Games.</p>
<p>As a pro, Whitaker had entered the ring 22 times and had
his hand raised after 21 of them. The exception was a 1988
bout with Jose Luiz Ramirez for the WBC lightweight title in
Paris, France, Ramirez's adopted home city. Whitaker broke
his left hand early on in that one, but still fought so well
that, in the end, only Ramirez's close relatives and two of
the three judges gave the Mexican the nod.</p>
<p>Whitaker evened the score last August by pasting Ramirez
in his own hometown of Norfolk. In the opinion of two of the
judges in that one, Sweetpea lost nary a round of the 12.
That's boxing's version of a shutout.</p>
<p>In several rounds Saturday, Whitaker pitched a virtual
no-hitter, jabbing and then darting out of the reach of
Nelson's lunges. Nelson connected solidly a few times, but
without noticeable effect. The picture that will endure from
this go is of Nelson swinging at Whitaker along the ropes,
and hitting the robes because Whitaker had long since ducked
out.</p>
<p>Afterwards, Whitaker tipped his cap to his foe by calling
Nelson "a man who brought things out of me," and by cringing
in mock anguish at the thought of a rematch, even though
nobody suggested one.</p>
<p>Whitaker earned a reported $500,000 for the fight, his
first both in Las Vegas and on HBO television, boxing's "big
time." Unfortunately for him, he doesn't promise to grow much
physically, which seems to preclude more-lucrative bouts with
bigger guys, like Julio Cesar Chavez.</p>
<p>Shelly Finkel, Whitaker's co-manager, suggested that a
lightweight-title unification match, with World Boxing
Association beltist Juan Nazario, is a future possibility. So
are fights with Jeff Fenech, the Australian super-feather,
and Jorge Paez, the bouncy Mexican who fights in a skirt and
has weird things shaved onto his head.</p>
<p>That last matchup is especially intriguing. Off Saturday's
result, Whitaker might add the imprint of his right glove to
Paez's hairdo.</p>
