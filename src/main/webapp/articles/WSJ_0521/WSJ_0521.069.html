	<p class="article-leader">H. Ross Perot, billionaire, Eagle Scout, folk hero and
bureaucracy basher is no St. Francis.
   Just ask his former colleagues at Electronic Data Systems
Corp., the data processing firm he founded then sold to
General Motors Corp. in one of the most celebrated and
tumultuous deals of the merger-happy 1980s.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>EDS veterans know a different Mr. Perot from the one
celebrated in song and in mini-series. They know a sharp-eyed
Texas deal-maker who slipped GM a mickey in the agreement
that went with the auto maker's $700 million buy-out in 1986;
a ruthless enemy who uses the press and his political clout
to savage those who cross him; a media spin-master who
cultivates a homespun populist image one minute and the next
drops the full weight that comes with a multibillion dollar
fortune on two hapless Dallas police officers who caught his
daughter-in-law with a pistol in her car. (The officers let
her go, but according to the Dallas Times-Herald, Mr. Perot
"chewed them out" anyway.)</p>
<p>It is this less-attractive side of Mr. Perot that Business
Week writer Todd Mason sets out to expose in his "Perot: An
Unauthorized Biography" (Dow Jones-Irwin, 316 pages, $19.95).
Mr. Mason, who covered Mr.Perot and EDS while he was Business
Week's Dallas bureau chief, doggedly pursues his thesis that
the man lionized for championing Vietnam prisoners of war,
defying Iranian hostage-takers and sassing GM Chairman Roger
B. Smith, has more than a little clay on his shoes.</p>
<p>After Mr. Perot refused to cooperate, Mr. Mason turned to
aggrieved former colleagues, childhood acquaintances,
transcripts and newspaper clippings from Mr. Perot's 1989
court battle with EDS, and passages from hitherto-sealed
depositions by GM Chairman Smith and others to put together
his unflattering profile.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, Mr. Mason's poorly edited book is as
imperfect as his subject. Chapter Four, for example, starts
out promising details of how Mr. Perot fought the Social
Security Administration in the late 1960s to block the
agency's effort to audit EDS's books. Social Security
officials were concerned that EDS was making an undeserved
killing processing state Medicare claims.</p>
<p>But in the third paragraph, Mr. Mason lurches almost a
decade forward in time to late 1978 and Mr. Perot's exploits
in Iran. After two EDS executives were thrown in an Iranian
prison on trumped up charges, Mr. Perot whipped into shape a
group of employees to free them. Seven pages later, Mr.
Perot's ad-hoc commandos have beaten the odds to liberate
their colleagues and it's back to the Social Security
Administration.</p>
<p>For those who press on, there is some reward when Mr.
Mason retells the story of Mr. Perot's bitter split with Mr.
Smith, and his subsequent decision to launch a new company,
Perot Systems Corp., to compete with his old friends at EDS.
Mr. Mason delivers a clear-eyed account of the events
surrounding GM's controversial $700 million buy-out of Mr.
Perot, aided by the abundance of testimony and documentation
that spilled out of the Virginia courtroom where Mr. Perot
and EDS locked horns last year. That dispute focused on Mr.
Perot's claim that GM's buy-out left him free to hire away
EDS personnel and woo EDS clients.</p>
<p>Mr. Mason reports, for example, that Mr. Perot never put
the $700 million he got from GM in an escrow account to allow
the auto maker to change its decision, although he said he
had at the time. And he attacks the prescriptions Mr. Perot
offered for GM in a 1988 Fortune magazine article as "light
on specifics and long on leadership generalizations."</p>
<p>Mr. Mason's got the right idea. Mr. Perot's powers of
persuasion, whether focused on a huge company or a single
reporter, are wondrous. But a less-gifted individual who
tried his simplistic problem-solving methods or his battering
ram approach to critics would quickly come a cropper.</p>
<p>In fact, Mr. Perot himself is discovering that not
everyone cares for his mix of charm and bluster. After
details of his lucrative, no-bid contract to automate the
U.S. Postal Service got out in 1988, Mr. Perot got a painful
reminder that even billionaires sometimes have to play by the
rules. EDS tied up the deal in so many administrative
protests that Postmaster General Anthony Frank finally
abandoned it.</p>
<p>The problem is that despite all the information Mr. Mason
has collected, his book doesn't add much sting to a tale that
has been told to death. All that's really new is that now
each of the two sides in the Perot-EDS feud has a book.</p>
<p>Mr. Perot has the sympathetic portrait in "Irreconcilable
Differences," a gossipy 1989 account of his clash with Mr.
Smith written by former Wall Street Journal reporter Doron P.
Levin, now Detroit bureau chief for the New York Times. EDS
has Mr. Mason's dry indictment. Readers without an ax to
grind probably will prefer Mr. Levin's smoothly told yarn,
even though Mr. Mason is closer to the truth.</p>

<p>Mr. White is a staff reporter in the Journal's Detroit
bureau. He covered the litigation between Mr. Perot and EDS
in 1988 and 1989.</p>
