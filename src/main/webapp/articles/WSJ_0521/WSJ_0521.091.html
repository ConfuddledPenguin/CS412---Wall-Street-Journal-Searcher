	<p class="article-leader">STAMFORD, Conn. -- Sprague Technologies Inc. said its
board authorized the company to spin off its semiconductor
business to shareholders.
   The distribution, whose terms haven't yet been worked out,
is expected to occur in the third quarter. A company official
said Sprague would be filing documents with the Securities
and Exchange Commission in about a month.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The semiconductor business represents about 25% of
Sprague's total assets of $387 million, said Steven Meyers,
senior vice president, finance and administration. Mr. Meyers
said the spinoff doesn't require shareholder approval.
Sprague, which has about 18.2 million shares outstanding,
closed Friday at $5.625, up 50 cents, in composite trading on
the New York Stock Exchange Friday.</p>
<p>Edward F. Kosnik, president and chief executive officer of
the capacitor and electronic parts company, said the spinoff
would give the semiconductor group its own identity and that
the move would enable Sprague holders "to better realize the
underlying value" of that group.</p>
<p>Mr. Kosnik said the spinoff is timely because of the
semiconductor group's "new generation of product offerings
for the disk drive, computer peripherals and automotive
markets." The semiconductor group, which Sprague reports as a
discontinued operation, had profit of $100,000 on sales of
$28 million in the first quarter. Without the semiconductor
results, Sprague net income would have been $1.4 million, or
eight cents a share, on sales of $84.4 million.</p>
