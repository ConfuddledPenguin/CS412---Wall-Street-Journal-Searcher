	<p class="article-leader">LONDON -- Five months ago, cocoa prices were at their
lowest levels since the mid-1970s and the market was steeped
in gloom.
   Following a price surge of more than 50% during the past
five months, however, euphoria has supplanted depression.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Despite a huge world cocoa stockpile of 1,350,000 metric
tons -- equal to 61% of annual consumption, according to
estimates of merchants Gill & Duffus Group Ltd. -- most
traders expect prices to continue rising. A metric ton is
2,204.62 pounds.</p>
<p>Volumes and open interest in New York and London futures
markets "surpassed all previous records" in recent months,
Gill & Duffus says, as speculative commodity funds jumped
into the market.</p>
<p>"I cannot find a dealer who is pessimistic about the
market's prospects," says Robert Fish, managing director of
Primary Commodity Research Ltd., cocoa consultants. The
market is clearly overbought, he says. Yet there is so much
uncertainty about the political and economic outlooks in the
Ivory Coast, the world's biggest producer, that traders and
chocolate manufacturers don't dare buck the trend, Mr. Fish
says.</p>
<p>Cocoa futures prices soared last week. On Friday, the July
futures traded at a life-of-contract high of $1,493 a ton in
New York; the contract fell back to finish at $1,477, up $30.
Earlier this month, the contract was at $1,225 a ton.</p>
<p>Sparking the runup was news that Ivory Coast troops
surrounded the state's radio station, the presidential
residence and took over the airport in Abidjan, the capital,
demanding higher wages. After several hours they withdrew,
but the cocoa market remains jittery, dealers say.</p>
<p>There is concern that following several violent
demonstrations this year, Ivory Coast President Felix
Houphouet-Boigny will resign and a new government would back
out of previously negotiated cocoa commitments.</p>
<p>The Ivory Coast, which produces 625,000 tons of cocoa, or
26% of this year's world output, has already sold the
season's crop forward, dealers say. If a new government
decides to alter sales contracts, the market could be caught
short and prices could soar further, dealers say.</p>
<p>Much will depend on Philipp Brothers Ltd., a U.S. trading
firm and a unit of Salomon Inc., which holds 400,000 tons of
cocoa bought from the Ivory Coast, dealers say. For the
moment, however, the firm doesn't appear to have any plans to
sell cocoa at present prices.</p>
<p>World cocoa demand is likely to outpace production, and
prices could rise significantly during the next few years,
predicts Derek Chambers, head cocoa trader at Philipp
Brothers.</p>
<p>Major chocolate factories don't have sufficient stocks, he
says, because they were conditioned to many years of low
prices. Moreover, Eastern Europe will be "a driving force
behind chocolate consumption this decade," he predicts.
Demand there will soar to around 660,000 metric tons by the
mid-1990s from present levels of 280,000 tons, Mr. Chambers
says.</p>
<p>Eastern Europe could become a huge cocoa buyer, says Gill
& Duffus in a report, but there is a "genuine risk that the
region's huge economic problems will prevent it from
realizing its potential in the short term." Yet output fell
from last season's record crop and annual consumption rose
38% from levels a decade ago, Gill & Duffus says. So,
"fundamental changes" in the market "are promising."</p>
<p>Still, there is a "great danger" that the recent price
rally will encourage premature optimism and forestall the
improvements to the balance of the market, the firm says.</p>
<p>It is thus "too early to revise price expectations," Gill
& Duffus says. The 164,000-ton projected surplus of
production over consumption is still "sizable" and world
stocks are "of record proportions."</p>
<p>While dry weather could harm the present cocoa crops,
farmers in Africa and Brazil could produce more this year,
adds Peter Greenhalgh, an analyst at Landell Mills
Commodities Studies Ltd. Moreover if Ivory Coast exports
fall, Malaysia, another large producer, will be sufficiently
flexible to raise its exports, he says.</p>
<p>Looking ahead to other commodity markets this week:</p>
<p>Energy: Traders are expected to continue bailing out of
the June crude-oil futures contract, which goes off the board
at the end of tomorrow's trading day on the New York
Mercantile Exchange. Friday's pattern of a small rally caused
by bargain-hunters followed by late aggressive selling might
repeat itself today and tomorrow, analysts said. The June
contract fell 11 cents Friday, to close at $18.76 a barrel.
Exchange officials, citing a computer error, corrected
earlier reports of an 11-cent drop. Once the June contract
expires, traders will turn their attention to the weekly
statistics from the American Petroleum Institute to see
whether last week's API report showing an unexpectedly large
buildup in crude was a fluke or the beginning of an extremely
bearish trend.
</p>
<p>Precious Metals: Platinum prices rose strongly last week,
and exploded with a $14-an-ounce advance Friday, carrying
silver and gold up with it. Traders this week will anxiously
wait to see if it is just a blip or a definite trend.
Increasing concern over reports of labor unrest at mines in
South Africa spurred rising prices early last week. Then
technical considerations took over, accelerating the advance.
On Friday, surges in demand for contracts occurred as the
July futures price rose above $496 an ounce and then above
$504. The contract crested at $508.50, falling back to $507
at the finish for a gain of $14.10. There were also reports
of increasing tensions between the Soviet Union and
Lithuania, which one analyst thought may have contributed
some support. For months the premium of platinum over gold
has held in a range of $110 to $112 an ounce, said William
O'Neill, vice president of research for Elders Futures Inc.,
New York. On Friday, however, this price spread widened to
more than $130 an ounce, he said. That was significant, he
observed, because, "Traditionally, the strength of platinum
in the spread with gold has been a leading indicator of
strength in precious metals generally."</p>
<p>Grains and Soybeans: The weather will dominate the
attention of traders this week. A recent cold and rainy spell
delayed planting of corn and soybeans in parts of the
Midwest. However, some meteorologists are predicting better
chances for warm and dry weather this week, which would speed
planting and increase the chances of a full growing season
and good yields. If rainy weather continues to slow planting,
corn farmers might shift some of their acres into soybeans
because that crop can be planted later, said Richard A.
Loewy, president of AgResource Co., Chicago.</p>
