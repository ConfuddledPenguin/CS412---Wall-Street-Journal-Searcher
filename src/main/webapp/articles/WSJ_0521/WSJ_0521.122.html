	<p class="article-leader">Axa-Midi Assurances said it sold its 92% holding in a
Paris-based warehouse company to La Societe Magnant S.A. for
the equivalent of $731 a share, or $575 million.
   The warehouse company, Cie. des Entrepots & Magasins
Generaux, is traded on the Paris Bourse.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The sale price is almost twice the $296.5 million value
estimated by an independent appraiser in Axa-Midi's
application earlier this year to purchase Farmers Insurance
Group, Axa-Midi said. The sale of Farmers Insurance to
Axa-Midi was proposed by Sir James Goldsmith as part of his
$21 billion bid for B.A.T Industries PLC. California
insurance authorities rejected the sale of Farmers, saying
the leverage required would have endangered Farmers.</p>
<p>Axa Midi, Europe's seventh largest insurance company, said
it continues to look for a U.S. insurance company to buy.</p>
