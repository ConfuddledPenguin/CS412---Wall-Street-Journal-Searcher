	<p class="article-leader">ZEMEX Corp. directors voted to omit the second-quarter
dividend. The New York-based company paid a 2% stock dividend
in March and a five-cent dividend in December. Previously,
the company had been paying 10 cents quarterly. Don Shanks,
vice president, secretary and treasurer, said the company
decided to omit the dividend because it is raising funds for
capital improvements. A ten-cent quarterly dividend would
cost the company $711,000 a year. Zemex mines industrial
minerals and tin, and has an iron-powder plant. For the first
quarter, the company had a net loss of $101,000, or six cents
a share, on revenue of $10.3 million. In New York Stock
Exchange composite trading Friday, Zemex closed at $7,
unchanged.</p>
