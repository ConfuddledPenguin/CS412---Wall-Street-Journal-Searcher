	<h3>Politics & Policy: Apple-Pie Aspect of Environmental Taxes Draws Proponents Even From the Ranks of Lip Readers</h3>

	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- Rep. E. Clay Shaw Jr. is a loyal Republican
who has wrapped himself in President Bush's "no new taxes"
pledge. But when it comes to the environment, well, that's a
different matter.
   A few weeks ago, Rep. Shaw introduced a bill proposing a
new tax on polystyrene products, often used for fast-food
containers. "There's no question it's a tax," he admits, "but
it's a tax I view more as a deterrent than a revenue raiser."</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Taxing environmentally harmful activities -- be it the
spewing of sulfur dioxide into the air or the manufacture of
paper without using recycled pulp -- is looking increasingly
attractive on Capitol Hill, as both a means of raising
billions in revenue and a way of enhancing the environment.
"Keep an eye on environmental taxes," Ronald Pearlman, chief
of staff of the congressional Joint Committee on Taxation,
advised tax lawyers recently.</p>
<p>The idea is likely to come up in the current budget
negotiations between the Bush administration and Congress,
and a number of people expect any major deficit-reduction
package this year will include some kind of environmental
tax. Even if the summit talks fail, environmental taxes are
likely to stay on the table in the coming years. "It could be
a big area for tax legislation this year or the next several
years," Mr. Pearlman predicts.</p>
<p>Many lawmakers agree. "Clearly that's the direction the
chairman of our committee is heading," says Rep. William
Archer of Texas, the ranking Republican on the tax-writing
House Ways and Means Committee.</p>
<p>Rep. Dan Rostenkowski of Illinois, the influential Ways
and Means chairman, has called for $3.2 billion in
unspecified environmental taxes next fiscal year as part of a
plan to pare the budget deficit. The Congressional Budget
Office estimates about $22 billion could be raised in the
next five years through a tax on sulfur-dioxide and
nitrogen-oxide emissions -- industrial pollutants that cause
acid rain.</p>
<p>At least a dozen pieces of legislation have been
introduced in Congress this year using the tax code to crack
down on a range of perceived environmental evils, including
sulfur-dioxide, nitrogen-oxide and carbon-dioxide emissions,
polystyrene packaging, lumber cut from old redwoods, and
products made with unrecycled lumber, paper, plastics or
glass.</p>
<p>Revenue estimates haven't been completed for many of the
proposals, but joint tax committee economists believe a
number of the levies could raise substantial amounts.</p>
<p>"Frankly it's money from heaven," says Tom Ochsenschlager,
a partner in the office of federal tax services at the
accounting firm Grant Thornton. "Bush could go on TV with
Millie alongside, pat her on the head, and say this is not a
tax, it's a user fee. And it's only a user fee for those who
pollute the environment. And I'd be just tickled pink if this
tax disappeared because the idea is to change behavior."</p>
<p>The taxes may not fall solely on big corporate polluters.
Executives of Southern Co., a big utility holding company,
vow to raise electric rates if a proposed tax on
sulfur-dioxide emissions is enacted, meaning consumers would
foot at least part of the bill. "We couldn't absorb those
kinds of numbers," says Larry Westbrook, the company's chief
financial officer. "I'd have to think that whether you're a
steel or a chemical plant or any other business, you can't
absorb costs like this."</p>
<p>The Bush administration has said it opposes most of the
environmental-tax bills currently in Congress. But it hasn't
slammed the door completely on the idea. Michael Graetz,
deputy assistant Treasury secretary for tax policy, told the
Ways and Means Committee in March that the administration is
studying the possibility of a "virgin materials" tax to
encourage recycling. The idea would be to tax the content of
unrecycled raw materials, such as paper or glass, in
products.</p>
<p>Mr. Graetz said any environmental tax would have to
satisfy several criteria to gain administration support. For
instance, the levy must address a national -- not a regional
-- problem. And it must be easy to administer. Some committee
members read his remarks as a sign that the administration
could be receptive to some proposals.</p>
<p>In fact, President Bush has already agreed to an
environmental levy. Last year he signed into law, as part of
budget-reconciliation legislation, a new excise tax on
chlorofluorocarbons, pollutants that drain the earth's
protective ozone layer. Administration aides call this a user
fee, observes an aide to Rep. Fortney Stark (D., Calif.), who
introduced the legislation.</p>
<p>The tax showed lawmakers that environmental taxes are easy
to raise, adds a Ways and Means aide, noting that there isn't
any public outcry about environmental taxes.</p>
<p>At least not so far. But industry, still reeling from the
swift approval of the tax on chlorofluorocarbons, is
beginning to mobilize. The day after Earth Day, 46
representatives of some of the nation's largest industries
met in the downtown Washington offices of the National
Association of Manufacturers to plan a lobbying assault on
what they fear may be a growing trend in taxation.</p>
<p>"We don't want environmental taxes to be included in the
chairman's {proposals} for budget reconciliation," says
Monica McGuire, director of taxation at the manufacturers
association. But, she adds, "It's a hard tax to defeat."</p>
<p>That's partly because its a hard tax to fight. Political
lines tend to be drawn by region rather than party. Some
people say that industries that aren't affected by the
proposal don't seem interested in expending much effort to
fight them.</p>
<p>But many companies are incensed by the prospect of a new
pollution tax on top of stringent new regulations soon to be
enacted with the massive clean-air legislation currently
moving through Congress. Southern Co., which provides power
to four southeastern states, estimates that legislation
introduced by Rep. Stark to tax sulfur-dioxide emissions from
utility companies would cost the company $18 billion by 2013
on top of the extra $15 billion the company expects it will
have to pay during that period to comply with the clean-air
law.</p>
<p>The double whammy, says Mr. Westbrook, is unfair. "We're
talking about an awesome thing that hits us and hits our
customers."</p>
<p>Industry's main line of attack paints environmental taxes
as a foe of U.S. competitiveness. "An environmental tax, no
matter how you cut it, by and large taxes U.S.-based
production," says Robert Hill, associate director of taxation
for the Chemical Manufacturers Association. "It's absolutely
detrimental to our competitiveness."</p>
<p>Such arguments have sunk in with some lawmakers. "I for
one think we've got to be awfully careful how we move in this
direction because of concern for the macroeconomic impact,"
Rep. Archer says.</p>
<p>But Rep. Stark, the author of several environmental-tax
proposals, insists: "As long as care is given to setting the
right tax level, taxes based on environmental degradation
offer the potential of redirecting our economy to a more
efficient allocation of resources, as well as generating
significant revenues."</p>
