	<p class="article-leader">DOWNERS GROVE, Ill. -- ServiceMaster L.P. plans to revamp
its ownership structure sometime within the 18 months.
   C. William Pollard, chief executive, said he's considering
three alternatives for reshaping the company's ownership:
spinning off a segment, re-incorporating the company or
selling convertible debentures. Mr. Pollard, who will also
become the company's chairman on June 1, didn't indicate
whether he presently favors any of the choices.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>In a move that would facilitate a possible spinoff, the
company earlier this month named two presidents to head its
main operating groups, management services and consumer and
commercial services.</p>
<p>Analysts indicated they'd like the company to take public
the consumer and commercial services division, which is the
fastest-growing part of the company. Mr. Pollard declined to
say whether a spinoff would likely involve that unit.</p>
<p>ServiceMaster is considering the realignment because its
partnership structure is unattractive to institutional
investors. Less than 9% of its units are institutionally
owned, Mr. Pollard said.</p>
