	<p class="article-leader">TOKYO -- Laptop personal computers that weigh much less
and run much longer on batteries than current popular models
have taken a giant step toward mass market use, industry
officials say.
   Virtually all the major Japanese and American hardware
makers, as well as key software companies, agreed in meetings
here this month on industrywide standards for integrated
circuit memory cards, credit-card-sized replacements or
supplements for floppy and hard disks.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>An IC memory-card standard allows card-makers to produce
the same pieces, and software houses to write similar
programs, for the whole industry. It also makes it easier for
users to work with different brands. Those factors all help
create the critical mass necessary to attract hardware and
software companies, and to drive unit prices down.</p>
<p>"Everybody in the industry has been waiting for this
standard," says Tom Shigeta, senior staff manager of OEM
sales for Microsoft Co.'s Japan office. An official agreement
will be released by the beginning of June.</p>
<p>The technology still faces other hurdles, however, most
notably a price much higher than the market rate for floppy
disks.</p>
<p>The standards committee includes representatives from
International Business Machines Corp. and Japan's largest
personal computer and semiconductor makers, such as NEC
Corp., Toshiba Corp. and Fujitsu Ltd. Microsoft and Lotus
Development Corp. also played a major role in the
discussions.</p>
<p>The agreement doesn't require the participants to match
the standard. But many companies interviewed said they plan
to introduce personal computers based on the agreement within
the next two years. Most said they didn't want to be
identified because they don't want to reveal future product
plans. Fujitsu displayed a prototype memory-card machine at
an electronics show in Tokyo last week, and company officials
said they hope to sell such a machine in less than two years.</p>
<p>"By this December, there will be half a dozen {IC
card-based} PCs, some of the notebook type, others of the
pocket type," says Daniel Sternglass, president of Databook
Inc., an Ithaca, N.Y., peripherals company active in working
on the standard.</p>
<p>Currently, NEC, Atari Corp., and Poqet Computer Corp.,
Sunnyvale, Calif., which is 38%-owned by Fujitsu, make
computers using IC cards instead of disks, while many makers
sell machines that use cards in addition to disks. Several
electronic notebooks or organizers, such as the Wizard made
by Sharp Corp., also use IC memory-card technology. Of those
machines, only the Poqet machine currently is close to the
new standard.</p>
<p>IC memory cards eliminate the need for moving parts in
disk drives, cutting weight, energy use, and increasing
durability. Some companies say such machines could be made at
one to five pounds, compared with five to 10 pounds for most
current laptop machines. Many laptops drain their
rechargeable batteries within three hours. The Poqet PC
claims to run up to 100 hours on two AA-sized batteries,
although many analysts say it's too small to be considered a
true personal computer.</p>
<p>Such attributes are considered increasingly important as
the industry heads toward greater portability, spurred by a
wave of light laptops in the past year. In Japan, some
studies estimate that laptops, which had only a negligible
share of the PC market two years ago, could account for as
much as half of the market by 1992.</p>
<p>"PCs are getting smaller and smaller, lighter and
lighter," says Hiromi Yamamoto, a Toshiba technology
engineering manager. "Sometime in the future, a floppy disk
may be too big, and a new media will be required."</p>
<p>For now, IC cards are still very expensive. IC cards can
cost around $20, while comparable floppy disks sell for about
50 cents, some officials say. Some estimate costs will have
to be cut by one-tenth to make the technology commercially
viable. As a result, "many systems makers are probably still
skeptical," says Keiichi Adachi, an NEC engineering manager
who helped develop the hardware standard.</p>
<p>Advocates of IC memory cards say its advantages will
persuade users to pay a higher price. They also say costs
will come down as sales volume increases, and as technologies
improve.</p>
<p>The Japanese companies, represented by the Japan
Electronic Industry Development Association, and the American
companies, represented by the PC Memory Card International
Association, have agreed on physical standards for the cards
-- such as the dimensions and the number of pins -- and a
basic operating system, compatible with Microsoft's MS-DOS
and Digital Research Co.'s DR-DOS. Negotiations are
continuing on other features, such as making the software
execute on the memory card, but the companies say they expect
an agreement on some of those aspects by the end of the
month, and the rest by September.</p>
