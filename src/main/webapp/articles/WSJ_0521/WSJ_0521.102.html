	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- If it's an election year, Congress must be
getting tough on crime.
   Sure enough, the Senate is expected this week to take up
the omnibus crime bill, with some of the usual suspects in
the lineup: new death-penalty provisions, curbs on the
byzantine capital-punishment appeals process, and gun
control, among others.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>What's different about this year's sound and fury over
crime is the narrowing of the differences between the
parties. The Democrats have done the moving, and all of it's
to the right.</p>
<p>Swept up in the martial metaphors of the "war" on drugs,
Democrats will come to the Senate floor with law-and-order
proposals they can call their own. (Electric-chair politics
haven't heated up yet in the House, but will before the end
of the year.)</p>
<p>After floor speeches today, senators are scheduled to
begin battle over a hydraheaded bill introduced by Judiciary
Committee Chairman Joseph Biden (D., Del.). A blizzard of
amendments and substitutions will follow before a final vote.
Here are some of the possibilities:</p>
<p>-- Death penalty. Participants across the political
spectrum agree that the final bill is likely to bring
long-dormant federal death statutes into conformity with
current Supreme Court requirements.</p>
<p>The Biden package, borrowing language from conservative
Sen. Strom Thurmond (R., S.C.), would allow capital
punishment for 23 federal crimes. But in its current form,
the legislation wouldn't actually result in many executions.
For one thing, most of the crimes involved -- killing a
president or a Supreme Court justice, for example, or
deliberately causing a train wreck that results in death --
don't happen much.</p>
<p>Also, the Biden bill comes with an amendment by Sen.
Edward Kennedy (D., Mass.) that would provide a defense
against execution in jurisdictions shown to have meted out
death sentences in a racist manner. Conservatives warn that
the amendment would do away with capital punishment, not only
at the federal level but in the 37 states where it's legal.
The reasons are the abundance of studies purporting to show
racial bias and prosecutors' huge burden of proving that
racial considerations didn't affect sentencing.</p>
<p>As a result, you can expect a strong Republican effort to
strike the Kennedy amendment. In the same attack, GOP forces
are likely to try to add provisions for executing big-time
drug dealers, even in cases where prosecutors can't prove the
"kingpins" killed anybody.</p>
<p>-- Death penalty appeals. Democrats have come to agree
with Republicans on the need to limit so-called habeas corpus
petitions, by which death-row residents may challenge the
constitutionality of their convictions or sentences --
typically in multiple, piecemeal federal appeals.</p>
<p>In exchange for new restrictions, the Biden bill would
require states to provide lawyers who meet federal competence
standards at every stage of the criminal process. Republicans
would guarantee counsel -- if at all -- later in the appeals
process, and they wouldn't impose competence standards on the
states. More important, according to conservatives, the Biden
bill would open gaping loopholes, allowing repetitive
appeals. It would also reverse Supreme Court precedent to
allow inmates to take advantage of constitutional-law
decisions announced after their convictions.</p>
<p>"I'd be surprised if 10 senators actually know the
differences" among the several conflicting habeas corpus
proposals, says one senior Democratic aide who does. The real
negotiations will take place among staff members, and the
danger in this murky area is that many lawmakers won't know
exactly what they're voting for.</p>
<p>-- Gun control. The Democrats want to ban nine types of
semi-automatic weapons. Police groups and most public opinion
polls back such steps. The National Rifle Association
doesn't. The assault-weapons provision has a perilous future.</p>
<p>-- Exclusionary rule. This judge-made rule barring use of
unconstitutionally gathered evidence, long an election-year
favorite, so far has been overshadowed by the death penalty
and habeas corpus debates. Part of the reason is that
Democratic protectors of the rule have given so much ground.</p>
<p>The Biden bill would codify a major exception carved out
by the Supreme Court, which held in 1984 that where police
rely in "good faith" on a faulty search warrant, a judge may
admit the evidence found. Conservatives will try to extend
the exception for good-faith police violations to warrantless
searches, among other circumstances.</p>
<p>One side-effect of the Biden approach, much appreciated by
otherwise bruised-and-reeling civil libertarians: Turning the
Supreme Court decision into a statute would inhibit the
justices from attempting further erosion of the exclusionary
rule.</p>
