	<p class="article-leader">BUCHAREST -- In the political euphoria that swept
Communists out of power across Eastern Europe last year,
Romania played its full part. Dictator Nicolae Ceausescu was
deposed and executed; closed borders were opened; and
repressed spirits soared.
   But not for long. Even as Hungary, Czechoslovakia, Poland
and East Germany have moved rapidly toward democracy,
Romania's revolution stalled. And five months after Mr.
Ceausescu's fall, no elected, legitimate non-Communist
government has assumed power.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Yesterday's election, the first multiparty voting here in
53 years, still might not put such a government in power.
When results are officially declared later this week, the
winners are expected to be the interim president, Ion
Iliescu, and his National Salvation Front. He held an
overwhelming majority of the vote in exit polls last night.
But political opponents are alleging fraud. And militant
students are pledging to continue their protests against what
they say is a Communist government in disguise.</p>
<p>Romania's revolution, bloodier than those of its
neighbors, has proved the least revolutionary in its effects,
and the most likely to provoke further violence. During the
recent campaign, opposition politicians were threatened and
beaten. The almost daily street demonstrations often turned
violent. The joy of December vanished quickly.</p>
<p>To be free finally to speak about problems is not to solve
them. And Romanians have learned that the heritage of 45
years of eccentric, dictatorial rule is a nation without
modern technology, no longer able to produce food in
abundance, a nation lacking a management class and a
political structure that might be the basis for progress.
Optimists among Romanian politicians say it will take five
years to recover; pessimists say 10 years or longer.</p>
<p>"We're talking about the difference between the Middle
Ages and the Space Age," says Mihai Coman, the new dean of
Romania's first journalism school.</p>
<p>Of all the emerging Eastern European countries, the road
back will be the longest and most perilous here, the chances
of slipping again into dictatorship or chaos the highest. And
Romania is least likely to get support from the West.</p>
<p>Eastern Europe is way behind the West. Romania is way
behind the rest of Eastern Europe. Poland already has an
elected non-Communist government and a tough, market-based
austerity program. East Germany is being taken in hand by the
strong West German economy. Czechoslovakia is matching
political reform with economic restructuring. Hungary, which
like East Germany has now held elections, began setting up
free market structures, including a stock market, years ago.
In Budapest, where youths wearing Levi's jeans made in
Hungary crowd a downtown McDonald's, dozens of joint-venture
contracts are being signed each week. Bucharest has no
Levi's, no Big Macs and, so far, no deals.</p>
<p>Apart from countless visits by French government ministers
and welcome French humanitarian aid, the West has yet to
offer Romania much help. The U.S., for instance, doesn't
intend to grant trade concessions until a democratically
elected government is well-established.</p>
<p>Heavily favored to win the election is the National
Salvation Front, a ragbag including former communists who
served under the late Mr. Ceausescu, army officers who forced
Mr. Ceausescu to flee and then killed him, and a few
sometimes -- disillusioned intellectuals. The main opposition
Liberal and Peasants parties, groups revived after 45 years
in the political wilderness, complain that they haven't had
the time or means to organize an effective campaign against
the Front, which among other things dominated television
coverage and supplied most of the election officials. The 70
or so smaller parties that have cropped up faced similar
problems. Not even a substantial Front victory at the polls
will silence those who believe the election was essentially
unfair.</p>
<p>Romania's one advantage -- its lack of foreign debt --
will mean little until a stable political and economic
structure is in place to encourage foreign investment. Banks
aren't lending yet. "There's more difference today between
Romania and Hungary than there is between Hungary and West
Germany," says Gilles Courregelongue, France's consul general
in Bucharest. "Romania may have no debt, but it has no money,
either."</p>
<p>Mr. Ceausescu's 24-year rule became more and more a matter
of megalomaniacal whim. Much of the $11 billion he borrowed
went to build huge oil refineries that operate at a third of
capacity. Most of what Romanians produced was exported to pay
off the debt, and there wasn't much to export. Each year Mr.
Ceausescu announced a record grain harvest, but shops had no
bread. The claims weren't true. The official figure for 1989
was 60 million metric tons; the reality was only 16.9
million. Shoe factories had plenty of local leather, but no
imported glue, and soles fell off in the rain. Mr. Ceausescu
boasted that Romania was a modern country, even as its
1930s-vintage telephone system operated just 38 lines to the
U.S.</p>
<p>"The only thing we had in abundance," says economist
Daniel Daianu, "was lies."</p>
<p>The provisional government hasn't improved things much.
The death penalty was abolished, then restored. The Communist
party was banned. Both these issues were to be decided by
referendums, but that idea was dropped. Workers were given
three Saturdays off per month, in addition to Sundays off.
When production lagged, it became just two free Saturdays.
The craziest old laws have been abolished, including the one
requiring all typewriters to be registered with the secret
police so as to discourage anonymous political dissent. But
the old regime's basic structure -- and the bureaucrats who
run it -- remain in place.</p>
<p>Politics resumed with a bang after Mr. Ceausescu's
execution on Christmas Day. Demonstrations became a daily
ritual. And a sort of political catharsis took place on Feb.
18, when about 200 people demonstrating in front of the seat
of the provisional government (the former Foreign Ministry),
rushed past guards, ransacked offices, and briefly held
captive the deputy prime minister. Subsequent demonstrations
have also turned ugly.</p>
<p>Serban Papacostea, director of the Nicolae Iorga Institute
of History, watches the demonstrations from a ringside seat,
in his office across the square from the Foreign Ministry. He
says demonstrators are mainly peaceful anti-Communists
outraged that much of the National Salvation Front
leadership, including the interim president, Mr. Iliescu, had
been Communist Party officials under Mr. Ceausescu. "We've
gotten rid of only a part of the carcass of this imported
Communist monster," Mr. Papacostea says. "We're now in a
revolutionary pause. The people are catching their breath."</p>
<p>Getting rid of part of the carcass has, nevertheless, been
bracing for Romanians, even if the halting efforts of the
interim government suggest how far Romania has to go. History
student Ovioleu Cristeo recently went to the American Library
nextdoor to the U.S. Embassy to borrow Paul Kennedy's "Rise
and Fall of the Great Powers." In the past, security police
hanging around outside recorded names, threatening visitors,
so few dared to enter.</p>
<p>Mr. Cristeo's professor, Stefan Andreescu, now freely
speaks English or French to visitors and on the telephone.
Under the Ceausescu regime, contacts with foreigners were
discouraged.</p>
<p>A thriving flea market for handicrafts now coexists with
political orators, who have a lively soapbox in the
University subway station. The station had been closely
watched by security police. Competition from a new, private
taxi service has spurred state-owned taxis to respond to
radio calls for the first time, customers say. And there are
so many new newspapers -- more than two dozen at last count
-- that Romania is running out of newsprint.</p>
<p>Charles Hocker, a Romanian of German extraction, sees
another sign of change. An architect, Mr. Hocker will spend
the next two hours standing in line to buy meat at a butcher
shop near the university. "There's a big difference from
before," he says. "Now, at the end of the {wait} there's
meat." And at a subsidized price of about 25 cents a pound,
pork and beef are affordable.</p>
<p>Foreign businessmen are exhibiting the first signs of
interest in Romania, apparently a rich market because people
need so many things. The power breakfast has arrived.
Businessmen collect at the Intercontinental Hotel. By 7:30
a.m., the breakfast room is full, and men in suits are
shouting into both of the two telephones. "The answer is no,"
shouts a British voice. "When will the contract be ready?"
shouts a French voice.</p>
<p>What are they all doing here? "I really don't know," says
Fred Aeberhard, a Swiss animal-feed salesman, who has been
making the lonely trip to Romania for 15 years. "People
should come here to make contacts, or renew old ones," he
says. "It's too early to do any real deals." That's largely
because the game is too new. It has just become legal for
individuals to start their own businesses. Also just passed:
a relatively liberal joint-venture law, allowing up to 100%
foreign ownership with government approval.</p>
<p>Foreign companies might want to start with Romania's
computer industry, one of the most vivid examples of what's
wrong here, and how tough Romania's problems will be to fix.</p>
<p>Romania's lone computer maker, ICE-Felix Data Processing
Systems, began with great fanfare in 1972, at a time when Mr.
Ceausescu admired France and its technology. The plant was
modeled on a French state-owned factory in Toulouse, and for
its first five years it manufactured, under license, midsized
computers and components. The factory turned out its first
all-Romanian computers in 1977, and was the leading computer
supplier to the East bloc for the next few years, a sort of
Romanian IBM.</p>
<p>Then, in 1980, Mr. Ceausescu decided to start paying back
the debt he had built up. He also turned against computers,
deciding that they were going to give Romania a capitalist
taint. The company got no more money to import raw materials
or technology. Its foreign licenses expired. The plant was in
suspended animation for the next 10 years.</p>
<p>Today, the factory is still churning out 1980s era,
second-generation computers. They are big, slow and
expensive. A minicomputer with 250,000 bytes of memory sells
for about $30,000, perhaps 30 times what a better machine
might cost in the West. The Romanian computers are assembled
by hand by hundreds of women who solder imported Russian
microchips onto thick printed circuit boards. They work in a
huge, dusty, badly lit room. A ginger-colored cat licks its
paws under one assembly desk. Low tech doesn't require
super-cleanliness. Technical manager Traian Mihu says he
needs $10 million just to begin to improve his computers. He
doesn't have it. People from U.S. and European computer
companies have stopped by, he says, but no agreements on
joint ventures or technology transfer have been signed.</p>
<p>Mr. Mihu's woes stymie Constantin Donciu, chairman of the
computer graphics department at Bucharest Polytechnic. He is
on the cutting edge of Romanian high technology. Here, in the
computer graphics department, are trained the technicians who
will do competitive battle for Romania in world markets.</p>
<p>The one-room department houses six clunky, 12-year-old
display terminals, whose metal casings have been removed to
keep them from overheating. They are connected to a
filing-cabinet-size, nine-year-old computer with 256,000
bytes of memory (less than most lap-tops) and two aging
printers, one of which often doesn't work. All the equipment
says "Made in Romania" on it. Textbooks date from 1976.</p>
<p>"We're at least 15 years behind," says Mr. Donciu, patting
a terminal. "Since the revolution we can all speak frankly.
Frankly, this equipment is terrible."</p>
<p>The only machines his department can get are from
ICE-Felix, when it can afford them; it can't pay $30,000 for
ICE's outmoded new minicomputer. Mr. Donciu gets no technical
journals and last saw a borrowed computer magazine a year
ago. The Polytechnic's main computer room houses a
third-generation French mainframe that uses punch cards.
Students wait six days for their programs to be run.
Upstairs, behind locked glass doors sits another relic, an
ancient IBM 1130 computer that sometimes works.</p>
<p>Mr. Donciu looks through the doors. "It's like seeing an
exhibit in a museum," he says. "That's exactly where it
should be."</p>
