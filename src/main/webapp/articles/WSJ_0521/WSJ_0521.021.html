	<p class="article-leader">Taiwan shares continued their downward spiral Friday,
driving the market to a 13-month low.
   In Tokyo, stocks fell in slow afternoon trading Friday,
while London shares were mostly lower in active trading.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Taiwan's weighted index, which fell 131.97 points
Thursday, tumbled an additional 510.21 points, or 6.44%,
Friday, to finish at 7416.96, its lowest level since April
1989. The drop marked the largest single-day loss in
percentage terms on the exchange. On Wednesday, the index
plunged 510.41 points.</p>
<p>Trading volume including stocks and mutual funds totaled
about 997.9 million shares valued at 72.61 billion New Taiwan
dollars (US$2.66 billion), compared with Thursday's 1.3
billion shares valued at NT$98.62 billion. Among 196 losers,
177 stocks dropped to their 7% limits. Only two issues
managed gains.</p>
<p>Traders said worries over a demonstration planned for
Sunday hampered buying interest. Opposition and students did
march in Taipei Sunday against the nomination of Defense
Ministry Hau Pei-tsun as the new premier.</p>
<p>"Political concerns dominate the trend because no one
knows what will happen," said Frank Yeh, assistant manager of
Core Pacific Securities Co. He said the trend will become
more clear after Sunday.</p>
<p>The market hit a record high at 12495.34 on Feb. 10 and
has plunged nearly 41%, or 5078 points, since.</p>
<p>Concerns over capital outflow was a major factor adverse
to the market. The market blamed growing capital outflow upon
recent decreasing turnover.</p>
<p>Central Bank Gov. Samuel Shieh said Thursday that Taiwan's
capital outflow has hit about US$6 billion this year. It was
compared with US$8.25 billion in 1989.</p>
<p>Observers in general say Taiwan share prices will go
lower. There was no trading Saturday because of a typhoon.</p>
<p>In Tokyo, the Nikkei index of 225 selected issues was down
47.88 points at 32013.72 Friday. The index gained 93.98
points Thursday.</p>
<p>In early trading in Tokyo Monday, the Nikkei index was
down 184.01 points to 31829.71.</p>
<p>The Nikkei index fell 190 points in midafternoon trading
Friday on arbitrage selling before it bounced back on
arbitrage buying, traders said.</p>
<p>Volume on the first section was estimated at 480 million
shares, down from 591 million shares Thursday. Declining
issues outnumbered advancers 654 to 308; 164 issues were
unchanged.</p>
<p>The Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed in the
first section, which fell 4.54 points Thursday, was down
10.97 points, or 0.46%, at 2388.26.</p>
<p>The second-section index, which gained 6.82 points
Thursday, was up 6.06 points, or 0.16%, to close at 3868.26.</p>
<p>Volume in the second section was estimated at 17 million
shares, up from 16 million shares Thursday.</p>
<p>The market hardly responded to news of fast-paced growth
in Japan's money supply in April. The Bank of Japan said the
nation's money supply grew at an average 13.2% pace in April,
the highest level in more than 13 years. The report didn't
immediately spawn expectations of a tighter monetary policy,
observers said, because the Bank of Japan attributed the high
growth to an extraordinarily high amount of redemptions of
postal savings-system deposits.</p>
<p>News that wholesale prices rose 2.7% in April from a year
earlier likewise didn't move prices because there is little
concern at the moment over the possibility of a discount-rate
increase, said Fumihiko Ishii, manager of investment research
at Nomura Securities. Wholesale prices increased 0.6% from
March.</p>
<p>Participants predicted healthy trading next week,
encouraged by a widespread perception that the yen is
gradually stabilizing against the U.S. dollar around the
152-yen level.</p>
<p>Expectations for a technical rebound are helping stimulate
buying, traders said. Investors hunted for issues whose
recoveries haven't caught up with the pace of the Nikkei,
which has achieved a one-third recovery from its low of 28002
posted on April 2, compared with its all-time high of 38915
posted Dec. 29.</p>
<p>Friday's winners included a broad range of
consumer-electronics and parts makers. Sharp was at 1,760 yen
($11.57) a share, up 10. Anritsu gained 50, to 2720.</p>
<p>Sumitomo Electric Industries, which has developed a new
type of ceramic coil that becomes superconductive at high
temperatures, advanced 30, to 1580.</p>
<p>Pharmaceuticals were bought broadly.</p>
<p>Shionogi gained 20, to 1540, while Mochida advanced 130,
to 3990.</p>
<p>The London market consolidated from Thursday's impressive
rally which gave the key Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100
index its sharpest daily gain in more than two years. The
100-share index fell 15.3 points, to 2269.1, a touch above
its low on the day of 2268.5 and far below its intraday high
of 2321.4, reached after the start of official trading.</p>
<p>The 30-share index ended down 2.4 points at 1793.3. Volume
was a healthy 594.8 million shares, down from 645.4 million
the previous day.</p>
<p>In the futures market, the June FT-SE 100 index contract
finished at 2295.0, down from 2329.0 Thursday. "Everyone said
it would be a day of consolidation, and that's what
happened," said senior dealer Paul Corbett of Panmure Gordon
Ltd. brokerage house in London.</p>
<p>Although the FT-SE 100 started the session well ahead on
strong stock-index futures contracts and firmness in the
underlying shares, profit-taking and a retreat of
institutional investors trimmed share prices, dealers said.</p>
<p>In addition, a weak opening on Wall Street, which has
recently had greater influence than usual on London's
performance, helped shave Thursday's gains.</p>
<p>Most traders agreed that cash-laden institutional
investors would make a return to the market sometime next
week after prices dropped to what they considered
satisfactory buying levels.</p>
<p>Thursday's rally was largely driven by rumors that the
pound would enter the European Monetary System's
exchange-rate mechanism shortly. Although Chancellor of the
Exchequer John Major said Thursday that entry was months away
and that lower inflation is a precondition, dealers said
investors took heart at what they felt was a further
indication of the government's intent to fully join the EMS.</p>
<p>Most traders were optimistic about the market's short-term
potential, anticipating a drifting in prices for several days
and then another rally, although not as significant as
Thursday's 63.3-point surge.</p>
<p>Among blue-chip stocks, Great Universal Stores dropped 28
pence to 954 pence ($16.15) a share following a 24 pence rise
a day ago. Trafalgar House fell 15, to 305, after a 15 pence
gain Thursday, and Rank Organisation shed 10 to 789 following
a 22 pence jump a day earlier.</p>
<p>Pharmaceuticals group Reckitt & Colman posted the day's
biggest gains, advancing 11 to #12.17.</p>
<p>In other market activity:</p>
<p>Share prices closed higher in Milan, Stockholm and Zurich;
little changed in Frankfurt; mixed in Brussels, and lower in
Amsterdam and Paris. South African gold stocks closed lower.</p>
<p>Share prices closed lower in Manila, Seoul and Sydney; and
higher in Hong Kong, Singapore and Wellington.</p>

Perspective, Geneva. To make them directly comparable, each
index is based on the close of 1969 equaling 100. The
percentage change is since year-end.</p>
