	<p class="article-leader">Subversives once trafficked in bombs and rifles. Now they
can carry fax machines, computers, laser printers, video
cameras. On July 4 -- the date is no coincidence -- the
Soviet Union's democratic subversives plan to assemble in the
same place for the first time, in Prague, Czechoslovakia. It
ought to be a shot heard 'round the world.
   The Prague Conference, "The Peaceful Road to Democracy,"
is being held at the invitation of Czech President Vaclav
Havel. Charter 77, the Czech human-rights group, is a
co-conspirator. The main sponsor is the National Council to
Support the Democracy Movements in the U.S.S.R., a private
American group whose honorary chairman is exiled dissident
Vladimir Bukovsky. A co-sponsor is Democracy and
Independence, an umbrella group that speaks overseas for the
socialist empire's booming democracy movements. This
organization is led by Armenian dissident-in-exile Paruyr
Hayrikian.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The idea is to bring together leaders from the Soviet
Union's far-flung democratic groups to compare progress, set
strategy and draw more world attention. If Lenin were alive,
he'd probably admire the subversive potential. In fact, if
the Kremlin doesn't allow the democracy delegates to leave
the U.S.S.R., they plan to meet in Lvov, in the Ukraine, and
hold a parallel conference that communicates with the one in
Prague. The chairman of the Regional Soviet in Lvov,
Vyacheslav Chornovil, is in the democratic vanguard.</p>
<p>These brave U.S.S.R. democrats haven't got the Western
attention they deserve. The Balts are well known, but even
the mayor of Moscow is now a democratic reformer. The Russian
republic may be on the verge of electing Boris Yeltsin,
though it's fair to say Mr. Yeltsin's long Communist Party
ties make him suspect among some democrats. Gary Kasparov,
the chess champion, has resigned from the Communist Party and
is starting a democratic group. He'll be in Prague. And Mr.
Hayrikian, though stripped of his citizenship by Soviet
authorities, was still on the ballot when Armenians elected
their own Supreme Soviet yesterday. Democracy is stirring in
every Soviet republic.</p>
<p>One goal in Prague will be to give every Soviet delegate
who attends the meeting a modern "democracy kit." The
organizers need: Apple and IBM computers, printers,
photocopiers, fax machines, telephone-answering machines,
cameras, video cameras, walkie-talkies, tape recorders,
megaphones and 50 offset printing presses. In the Information
Age, these are the guns of liberty.</p>
<p>Many in the West fear these democratic movements might
destabilize Mikhail Gorbachev. And it's true that glasnost
and perestroika have allowed these movements to grow. But we
agree with the Baltic and other democratic leaders who say
Mr. Gorbachev must choose between the forces of reform and
the communist and military reactionaries. Perestroika is
indivisible. The general belief now is that Mr. Gorbachev
faces a watershed at the Communist Party Congress in early
July. A successful Prague rendezvous would signal to the
communists that the grass-roots pressure for democracy is
growing.</p>
<p>A democratic Soviet Union is in the long-term interests of
the U.S. Only a nation with popular checks and balances will
be trustworthy enough to take a non-threatening seat among
Western nations. No one knows yet if this is what Mr.
Gorbachev has in mind. But while we're waiting for Gorby, the
West can support at the Prague meeting July 4 those Soviets
who've already decided.</p>
