	<p class="article-leader">BOSTON -- MerchantsBank of Boston, the main subsidiary of
Merchants Capital Corp., was declared insolvent and its $350
million in assets placed under control of the Federal Deposit
Insurance Corp.
   The eight branches of MerchantsBank will reopen today as
offices of Bank of Boston Corp., the state's largest
commercial bank. Bank of Boston said it paid the FDIC $7
million for MerchantsBank's $340 million in deposits.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The failure of MerchantsBank, a Massachusetts-chartered
cooperative bank, marks the second insolvency at a
Boston-area financial institution in the past three weeks.
Late last month, federal thrift regulators took control of
Home Owners Savings Bank in Burlington, Mass.</p>
<p>Douglas Clark, the FDIC official put in charge of
MerchantsBank after Massachusetts regulators declared the
bank insolvent Friday afternoon, said the agency will sell
off the bank's assets. Mr. Clark said recent financial
statements indicate MerchantsBank had negative net worth of
about $11.3 million. But he said agency officials must now
re-examine the value of the assets, comprised mainly of real
estate loans. "I suspect the {ultimate} loss will be greater
than $11.3 million," Mr. Clark said.</p>
<p>Mr. Clark and Andrew Calamare, Massachusetts commissioner
of banks, said MerchantsBank represented substantially all of
the assets of Merchants Capital.</p>
<p>John Lakian, chairman and largest shareholder of Merchants
Capital, couldn't be reached to comment on the government
action, which came after the close of stock market trading on
Friday.</p>
<p>MerchantsBank stock, which has barely traded in recent
weeks, remained at six cents a share Friday on the national
over-the-counter market. In composite trading on the New York
Stock Exchange, Bank of Boston stock closed at $13 a share,
up 50 cents.</p>
