	<p class="article-leader">Corporate Capital Resources Inc., Westlake Village,
Calif., said the Securities and Exchange Commission has been
investigating the company since February for possibly
manipulating its stock price.
   Corporate Capital, a venture-capital firm, said the probe
relates to its lawsuit against Los Angeles-based Securities
Settlement Corp., a clearing broker. The suit alleges that
Securities Settlement manipulated Corporate Capital's stock
price, the company said.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Corporate Capital said the SEC is looking into whether
Corporate Capital participated in that alleged manipulation
or others since September 1988.</p>
<p>Securities Settlement officials couldn't be reached
immediately for comment.</p>
<p>The SEC also is investigating whether Corporate Capital
misstated its investment holdings in its financial reports to
the agency, the company said.</p>
<p>In an interview, Daniel Weston, Corporate Capital
president and chief executive officer, said: "We strongly
believe the results of the investigation will be favorable to
us and won't have any adverse effects on the company."</p>
<p>In national over-the-counter trading Friday, Corporate
Capital's stock closed at 12.5 cents a share, down 3.125
cents.</p>
