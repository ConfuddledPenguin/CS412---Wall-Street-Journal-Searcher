	<div class="article-body"><p>As the middleman for much of China's trade with the U.S.,
Hong Kong will be hit hard if Washington revokes China's
status as a most-favored nation.</p>
<p>According to the Hong Kong government, about 70% of
China's exports to the U.S. -- a total of US$8.5 billion --
passed through the British colony in 1989 in the form of
re-exports; many of those re-exports were goods made by Hong
Kong companies in neighboring Guangdong province but then
finished or packed in the colony. A Western economist
estimates that the Hong Kong economy receives about 15% of
the value of the re-exports from such activities as
packaging, insurance and shipping.</p>
<p>If Chinese goods entering the U.S. become subject to
sharply higher tariffs, government officials and businessmen
in Hong Kong predict that re-exports could be cut in half.
That would have an immediate impact on Hong Kong's trading
companies, shippers, insurers and banks involved in trade
financing.</p>
<p>"There would also inevitably be serious . . . effects on
other sectors of the economy and, above all, on the general
level of confidence in Hong Kong," Sir Piers Jacobs, Hong
Kong's financial secretary, recently warned.</p>
<p>SONY LOOKS AT EAST EUROPE</p>
<p>Japan's Sony Corp. said it is considering setting up a
distribution network in East Europe to market its consumer
electronic products. Officials said Sony's headquarters in
Tokyo has been mapping out marketing plans in consultation
with its subsidiaries in Europe. They noted, however, that it
will be some time before the company decides whether to move
into East Europe.</p>
<p>MORE TOURISTS FOR MEXICO</p>
<p>More foreign tourists visited Mexico and spent more money
in the first three months of this year than during the same
period a year ago, the Tourism Department said. The 1.7
million tourists, 100,000 more than a year ago, spent an
average of $560 each, 6.2% more than the average last year,
the department said. Spending in the first three months
totaled nearly $1 billion, compared with $867 million during
the 1989 period.</p>
<p>IRANIAN RESOURCES</p>
<p>More than half the resources available to Iran's defense
industry will be directed to civilian purposes, Tehran radio
reported. The broadcast quoted an official of the defense
ministry's industrial section as saying that 60% of the
section's resources will be used in public projects. He said
this would include electronics, communications and computers.
The plan is aimed at rebuilding some of the big industrial
complexes devastated in the eight-year war with Iraq, the
radio quoted the official as saying.</p>
<p>FINNISH CRUISE LINER</p>
<p>Finnish shipbuilder Rauma Yards Oy has begun the
construction of a twin-hull passenger liner that will compete
with existing luxury cruise ships in the Caribbean.</p>
<p>Diamond Cruises Ltd., which ordered the vessel at a cost
of over 500 million markka ($128 million), said cruises will
begin in 1992. The 18,400-ton ship has a passenger capacity
of 354 and will need a crew of 170. Newly founded Diamond
Cruises is 50% owned by non-Finnish investors, including the
U.S.'s Radisson Hotel Corp., which will market the cruises
and provide passenger services.</p>
<p>PRIVATIZATION IN NORWAY</p>
<p>The Norwegian government proposed selling an 80% stake of
the troubled state metals concern Norsk Jern Holding AS to
Norwegian private investors for 480 million kroner ($75
million). The metals concern Elkem AS agreed to buy 45% on
July 1, and a Norwegian private investors' group will buy 35%
later this year, Industry Minister Petter Thomassen said.
Payment will be due June 1, 1993. Mr. Thomassen said the
government also requested authority to sell the remaining 20%
to other buyers for 120 million kroner.</p>
<p>JAPAN ON THE ENVIRONMENT</p>
<p>Japan outlined ways to combat global warming but stopped
short of advocating sweeping steps to curb its own
industries.</p>
<p>Tokyo's annual environment white paper concentrated on the
ecological effects of what many people believe to be rising
world temperatures caused by massive emission of carbon
dioxide and other industrial pollutants. Japan should pass on
to developing countries its know-how on pollution control and
energy efficiency, and ensure its foreign aid goes to
ecologically sound projects, the document said.</p>
<p>The paper said that factories should agree to uniform
vacations for workers and close down for the holidays and
that the country should consider introducing daylight-saving
time to conserve energy.</p>
<p>Stock traders said demand for shares of companies linked
to energy conservation surged on the Tokyo Stock Exchange
Friday as a result of the report.</p>
<p>POSTSCRIPTS . . .</p>
<p>A team from Unesco and the Egyptian Ministry of Culture
announced plans to build a wall around the pyramids and
Sphinx to help control visitors and limit encroachment by a
nearby village that caters to tourists. All modern buildings
within the wall would be razed. . . . France's new high-speed
train, the TGV, established a world speed record for trains
Friday, with a speed of 320 miles an hour. It was the third
time this month that TGV broke all previous records.</p>
