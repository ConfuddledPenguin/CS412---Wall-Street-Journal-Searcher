	<p class="article-leader">Your April 11 editorial on medical insurance put to mind
an incident that occurred 35 years ago, which I thought might
be of interest.
   In the winter of 1955-56, I was traveling back from New
Haven with the Riverdale Fencing Team, with my parents as the
team chaperons. Usually it would have been a trip made by car
and school bus, but there had been a heavy snow overnight and
we were consigned to the tender mercies of the New Haven
Railroad. My parents shuffled all of us into the dining car
for a little sustenance. We were the only people in the
dining section of the car, but down at the other end in the
club section was a couple enjoying cocktails. It took us
about one second to realize that the man was none other than
Ed Sullivan, who was certainly one of the most recognizable
people in America in those days. There was the usual
schoolboy excitement in the presence of a celebrity and the
usual banter about who was going to be brave enough to
approach him for an autograph, or interview for the school
paper, or whatever. Sullivan was perfectly aware of us, as we
were not a small group, or especially quiet -- as we had
bested Yale in the day's match.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>None of us were making too much progress in deciding who
was going down to see him, and Sullivan was, of course,
innately aware of the subject of our conversation. Finally,
he leaned forward and gave us a big sweeping motion with his
hand, indicating that if we would all troop down the length
of the car we would be welcome. He was charming and we were
all captivated.</p>
<p>Then, he treated us to a 15-minute virtual diatribe on the
evils of medical insurance and how it was going to inflate
the cost of health-care delivery to unimaginable proportions.
My parents, who were in the insurance business, were of
course the only ones present who had the slightest idea of
what he was talking about; but the vehemence with which he
expressed his ideas left a deep impression on me, and the
fact that all of his predictions have come true has only
enhanced the memory of that experience.</p>
