	<h3>Latest From Microsoft Will Heighten Competition With Apple's Macintosh</h3>

	<p class="article-leader">CUPERTINO, Calif. -- Bill Gates swears he doesn't mean
Apple any harm.
   Maybe so. But Windows 3.0, a product he's so proud of that
even his mother will be on hand when Microsoft unveils it
tomorrow, presents the most formidable technical challenge
ever to the Macintosh, Apple Computer's main computer family.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Mr. Gates says he has always been interested in making PCs
easy to use. But he insists that only recently have they
grown powerful enough to handle the images and split-screens
needed to control them with simple, intuitive commands.</p>
<p>Yet Apple did precisely this six years ago, and became the
second largest supplier of personal computers in the world.
Apple created for its Macintosh a new system software, the
program that controls basic operations such as storing files
and sending documents to a printer. The Macintosh operating
system was entirely different from Microsoft's MS-DOS, the
standard for most other desktop computers.</p>
<p>In MS-DOS, programs' effectiveness is restricted by memory
limitations, and users risk confusion if they forget arcane
command codes. The Macintosh gave the user visual cues to
simplify mundane tasks like copying documents or storing
files.</p>
<p>Now Microsoft's new Windows, after two earlier,
disappointing Windows versions, comes close to matching the
most compelling features of the Macintosh. And it does so
within the familiar MS-DOS standard, so consumers don't have
to jettison their old programs. Windows even promises a
feature that Macintoshes won't have until next year: the
ability to automatically exchange data between two different
programs.</p>
<p>Computer experts say the Macintosh system still makes it
simpler to start up the machine, store files and hook up
printers, among other things. But those differences may not
overshadow the major advantage of PCs that use MS-DOS and
Windows: They are far less expensive.</p>
<p>Apple has less-costly models on the way. It will introduce
a color Macintosh for less than $2,000 as early as this fall.
And it doesn't concede that Windows is its equal: "Microsoft
is very good at comparing their intentions with our
realities," says Jim Davis, Apple's director of systems
software marketing.</p>
<p>But Apple takes Windows seriously enough that it has sued
Microsoft charging copyright infringement. Apple also worries
that it is too dependent on Microsoft for applications -- the
three best-selling packages for the Macintosh are made by
Microsoft -- and that in the future Microsoft may give less
attention to Macintosh applications. Over the years, some at
Apple have called for breaking with Mr. Gates, fearing that
his secret plan is to weaken Apple's position by imposing a
single software standard for all desktop users.</p>
<p>Yet today Mr. Gates enjoys cordial relations with Apple
chief executive John Sculley. About two months ago, he even
spent several hours helping Mr. Sculley hash out Apple's
technical direction.</p>
<p>Mr. Gates says the way for Apple to keep its edge is to
continue to deliver new ways of controlling the PC-voice,
handwriting, multimedia, whatever. But "Apple needs to
focus," he says. "John agrees. Now let's see if he picks the
right areas."</p>
