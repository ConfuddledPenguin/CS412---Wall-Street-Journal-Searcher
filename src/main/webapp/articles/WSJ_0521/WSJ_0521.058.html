	<p class="article-leader">DENVER -- Chemex Pharmaceuticals Inc. said that its
president and chief operating officer has resigned and that
the company has decided to terminate one of two research
agreements it has with Yale University and move into smaller
offices in a bid to cut costs.
   The pharmaceutical concern said that Edward S. Neiss
resigned from his executive positions and as a director
effective May 1 to pursue other interests. A company
spokesman said the decision was Mr. Neiss's choice. The
company said that Mr. Neiss's contract with the company was
to expire in July.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Chemex also said late Friday that it has notified Yale
that it will terminate a general research contract on Sept.
30, cutting its Yale research costs in half. The company
declined to disclose the amount of those research costs.</p>
<p>Chemex also said it agreed in principle with its landlord
to move into a 5,000 square foot office from a 32,000 square
foot office space in the same building. It said it expects to
move in a few weeks.</p>
<p>The company, which had a loss of $6.6 million last year,
said that it has an agreement for short-term debt financing
secured by certain company assets, but it declined to
disclose the amount or provide details of the agreement.</p>
