	<p class="article-leader">Montedison S.p.A. said its 1989 consolidated profit surged
73% to 1.156 trillion lire ($952.1 million), or 427 lire a
share, from 668 billion lire, or 247 lire a share, a year
earlier, because of a large capital gain from its
contribution to the Enimont S.p.A. chemical joint venture
with state-owned Ente Nazionale Idrocarburi.
   Excluding special items, profit fell 26% to 362 billion
lire. Gross operating earnings fell 29% to 978 billion lire,
and net operating profit plunged 52% to 420 billion lire.
Sales fell 58% to 5.861 trillion lire from 14.122 trillion
lire; adjusted revenue rose 7%, mostly because of the
acquisition of SIR S.p.A., a resins maker.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Montedison, 45%-owned by Gruppo Ferruzzi of Italy, an
agri-industrial and chemical concern, blamed the operating
results on a "consistent narrowing of margins" from
exceptionally good 1988 levels.</p>
