	<p class="article-leader">WEST CHESTER, Pa. -- Commodore International Ltd. said it
achieved an early success in its attempt to enter the federal
government market for personal computers.
   Commodore has won a five-year subcontract with the
Treasury Department under which it expects to supply more
than 3,000 of its Amiga personal computers. The subcontract
was awarded as part of a $400 million contract won by Sears
Business Systems, a unit of Sears, Roebuck & Co.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The subcontract comes six months after Commodore began
trying to enter the market -- even though Lloyd Mahaffey,
vice president of marketing, said he hadn't expected to make
a sale for a year or more. Because of the long purchase
cycles on government contracts, Mr. Mahaffey said, many
companies take 18 months or even longer to make their first
sale.</p>
<p>While it is obviously unclear whether additional contracts
will follow close on the heels of the first one, any success
would be welcomed by Commodore. The company's U.S. operations
have long been lackluster, and a new management team is
looking for improvement by focusing on the federal government
market, schools and corporate training departments.</p>
