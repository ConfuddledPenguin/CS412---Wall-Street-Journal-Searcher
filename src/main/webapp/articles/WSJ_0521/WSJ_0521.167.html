	<p class="article-leader">MALVERN, Pa. -- Vishay Intertechnology Inc. has decided to
make a "white knight" offer to acquire Crystalate Holdings
PLC, Felix Zandman, chairman, president and chief executive
officer, said.
   Last month, Crystalate asked Vishay to come to its rescue
after TT Group PLC made a hostile bid of about $45 million
for the United Kingdom-based maker of resistors and
automotive sensors. On May 3, Vishay announced that it was
considering making a bid.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"The decision {to make a competing offer} has been made on
our side," said Mr. Zandman, who is scheduled to begin
further talks with Crystalate executives in the U.K. early
this week. "We don't know yet what the response will be," he
said. But he indicated that Vishay might disclose the terms
of its offer by next Monday. He also implied that he
considers the TT Group bid to be low.</p>
<p>Crystalate is the parent company of Welwyn Electric in the
U.K. and two U.S. units, International Resistance Co. and
RCL/Shallcross Inc. The parent had sales of about $180
million for the year ended Sept. 30, 1989. Mr. Zandman said
Crystalate hasn't been profitable so far this fiscal year.</p>
<p>However, he indicated in an interview that acquiring
Crystalate would provide a significant boost to Vishay's
market positions in the U.S. and abroad. For example, Vishay
already has about a 33% share of the U.S. fixed-resistor
market, with $180 million in sales last year. In the same
market, the two U.S. units of Crystalate have a combined
share of about 10.4%.</p>
<p>Mr. Zandman noted that Vishay's growth rate in the
world-wide market for fixed resistors is about 6% to 7% a
year, compared with only about 4.5% for the industry as a
whole.</p>
<p>Vishay considers "reasonable" and "in the ballpark" the
recently increased estimates by analysts of 1990 sales and
earnings, Mr. Zandman said.</p>
<p>For the first quarter, Vishay reported a 49% increase in
net income on a 9% sales gain. The strong performance
exceeded analysts' expectations, and many of them have since
raised their projections for the full year.</p>
<p>The consensus for sales has jumped to the range of $440
million from $420 million. Fully diluted per-share earnings
are now expected to be in the range of $1.92 to $2.02, up
from about $1.80.</p>
<p>For 1989, Vishay reported net income of $17.8 million, or
$1.50 a share, on sales of $415.6 million.</p>
<p>Mr. Zandman said Vishay expects to realize cost-reduction
"synergies" of about $10 million this year through continued
efforts to consolidate sales, distribution and manufacturing
activities in the businesses it has recently acquired. As
examples, he cited consolidations of the company's Dale and
Draloric units' operations in West Germany and of Vishay's
Sfernice activities in England and France that would produce
combined savings of about $4.6 million.</p>
<p>Moreover, Vishay is beginning to benefit from lower
borrowing costs and general administrative expenses as it
integrates the recent acquisitions and pares debt. In the
latest quarter, for example, general overhead costs fell to
17.3% of sales from 18.2% in the year-earlier period, and
interest expense declined 4%.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Mr. Zandman said Vishay hopes to take advantage
of inexpensive manufacturing costs at its plants in Mexico,
South Korea and Morrocco, where wages are low, and in Israel,
where taxes are minimal and the government reimburses the
company for investments in equipment.</p>
<p>He also indicated that Vishay might sell its large
Sfernice complex in Nice, France, because real estate values
there are so high. The property was appraised last year at
about $12 million, he said, and the local market is "still
rising."</p>
