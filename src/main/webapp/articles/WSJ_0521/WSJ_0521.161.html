	<p class="article-leader">FRANKFURT, West Germany -- Officials celebrated the "hour
of birth" of a united Germany even as West Germans continued
to calculate how to pay for unification without raising
taxes.
   The West German Finance Ministry rolled out a second 1990
supplementary budget of 4.75 billion marks ($2.88 billion),
including a 2.75 billion mark provision to rescue East
Germany's tottering unemployment and pension systems. The
remaining two billion marks are to be Bonn's first cash
contribution to the 115 billion mark German Unity Fund, set
up last week to help finance East German budget deficits
through 1994.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>In a first supplementary budget in February, Bonn
allocated 6.87 billion marks to support hundreds of thousands
of East German refugees.</p>
<p>Separately, the West German central bank Friday announced
a record six billion mark, 10-year government-bond issue. The
issue was seen as the start of a long period of heavy
borrowing to finance other East German support programs.</p>
<p>At Friday's signing ceremony in Bonn of the treaty to
merge the two German economies and social systems on July 2,
government leaders were upbeat. "What we are experiencing
here is the hour of birth of a free and united Germany," West
German Chancellor Helmut Kohl said.</p>
<p>East German Premier Lothar de Maiziere, responding to
widespread anxiety in East Germany, said: "I only find it
amazing that in various parts of Germany there are more
worries than hopes." East German farmers and industry workers
fear mass unemployment if their border is thrown open to free
market competition with Western producers.</p>
<p>In an important appendix to the treaty, East Germany
agreed to permit foreigners to buy land for commercial
purposes, despite fears of a wholesale buy-out of their
country. Bonn set the condition of foreign private ownership
as a prerequisite for the treaty, arguing that only industry
investment in East Germany can provide for full economic
recovery.</p>
<p>Predictions of other East German funding programs in the
future have swelled fears of tax increases and rising
inflation after the West German mark is introduced as East
Germany's currency.</p>
<p>But Finance Minister Theo Waigel sought to allay those
concerns. "We would be taking leave of our senses if we
crippled a well-functioning {West German} economy with
increased taxes," he said during the weekend.</p>
<p>Indeed, Bonn is counting on West Germany's bustling
economy to help pay for East German relief. Humming along at
a 4% growth rate, West German business activity is expected
to generate 8.2 billion marks more in tax revenue than
originally planned. The Finance Ministry said the windfall
could hold Bonn's 1990 budget deficit to 30.9 billion marks,
compared with an earlier projected 32.9 billion marks.</p>
