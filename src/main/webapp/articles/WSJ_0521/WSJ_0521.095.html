	<p class="article-leader">Lotus Development Corp.'s $1.5 billion merger with Novell
Inc. collapsed at the 11th hour, eliminating a potential
challenge to the growing dominance of software industry
leader Microsoft Corp.
   The combination, announced April 6, had been hailed as
redrawing the balance of power in the booming
personal-computer software business. Analysts said at the
time that the planned merger provided a counterweight to the
power of Microsoft, Redmond, Wash. The deal's collapse leaves
Microsoft more dominant than ever and gives its two most
important challengers self-inflicted wounds.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Lotus's chairman and chief executive officer, Jim P.
Manzi, said in an interview that negotiations with Novell
fell apart late Friday, after Provo, Utah-based Novell's
board unexpectedly demanded that the new company's board be
made up of four directors each from Novel and Lotus, which is
based in Cambridge, Mass. Lotus, which had already made major
concessions to Novell to stregthen Novell's voice in
management, rejected the new proposal.</p>
<p>Mr. Manzi seemed stung by the sudden reversal. After all,
he said, Novell's chairman had first proposed the merger.
"It's a shame," Mr. Manzi said. "We ended up wasting a lot of
time and money talking with people who apparently didn't know
what they wanted."</p>
<p>Novell's version of the events couldn't be determined.
Raymond Noorda, Novell's chairman, president and chief
executive, was unavailable yesterday, a spokeswoman for him
said. She said the company's executives wouldn't have any
comment until today.</p>
<p>Analysts said the failure of the two companies to come to
terms is likely to lead to other partnerships. "This sets the
stage for a realignment of the software industry," Rick
Sherlund, an analyst with Goldman, Sachs & Co., said.</p>
<p>In a letter of intent signed April 5, Lotus and Novell
spelled out a four-three board with four directors from
Lotus, and designated Mr. Noorda vice chairman. Novell was to
be acquired through a stock swap of 1.19131 Lotus shares for
each Novell share.</p>
<p>But investors at first reacted negatively to the proposed
deal, and Novell holders were unhappy that it didn't offer
them a premium for their shares. Critics also raised
questions about whether the companies' technologies and
sharply different management cultures could be combined.
Indeed, analysts said institutional holders of Novell may
have pressured board members to alter terms of the deal.</p>
<p>Mr. Manzi said that in subsequent negotiations, Lotus had
agreed to make Mr. Noorda chairman of the combined companies,
with Mr. Manzi serving as president and chief executive, and
agreed to rename the company Lotus/Novell Corp. The revised
terms, meant to ensure a strong management role for Mr.
Noorda, were agreed upon Wednesday, Mr. Manzi said. He was so
sure the merger would go through that he left with his family
Thursday for a weekend vacation at Walt Disney World in
Orlando, Fla. "We thought we had a deal," he said.</p>
<p>But Novell's board met Friday and demanded that the
composition of the board be changed, Mr. Manzi said. "They
had repeatedly agreed to the four-three board, and we weren't
going to give in on this," he said. "A four-four board is a
prescription for deadlock."</p>
<p>The combined companies would have had revenue of more than
$1 billion, surpassing that of Microsoft and dominating their
respective markets. Lotus has long been the leader in
financial spreadsheet software with its best-selling 1-2-3
line, while Novell holds an estimated 60% market share in
network operating systems, the software that weaves
stand-alone personal computers into networks.</p>
<p>Analysts said the broken deal marks a major setback for
both companies, and leaves Microsoft in an even stronger
position on the eve of one of the largest product
announcements in its history. Microsoft tomorrow will
announce Windows 3.0, a strategic enhancement of its flagship
operating-system software package known as MS-DOS, the basic
operating software that controls most personal computers.</p>
<p>In the wake of the failed merger, "Microsoft emerges as
the big winner," said Mr. Sherlund of Goldman Sachs. Lotus
and Novell "have cast their future," he said. "It's likely to
be tougher for both of them -- and a lot easier for
Microsoft."</p>
<p>Analysts also said the collapse leaves open the
possibility that Novell will seek other partners. "They've
been down that road once, maybe they are willing to try
again," said David Readerman of Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc.
He didn't speculate on other potential partners.</p>
<p>The collapse of the deal led to speculation that another
suitor had emerged for Novell. But Mr. Manzi dismissed this
possibility and added that there was a no-shop clause in the
letter of intent, precluding Novell from seeking other
partners during negotiations.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, some Novell investors began accumulating
shares last week, betting that the deal would be broken and
that a richer one might be forthcoming, said Robert Therrien,
an analyst with PaineWebber Inc.</p>
<p>The merger's failure raises anew all of the long-term
strategic concerns that brought the two companies together.
With Microsoft in control of the basic software that runs
personal computers, nearly every other company in the
industry must tailor their products to work with those of
Microsoft. The company's lengthening shadow led one industry
executive to call it "the Standard Oil of the software
industry."</p>
<p>"Those concerns aren't going away," Mr. Sherlund of
Goldman Sachs said. "And it's going to be very awkward for
Novell and Lotus to go back to shareholders and tell them
that the compelling need they saw for this merger last month
is no longer so pressing."</p>
<p>In national over-the-counter trading Friday, Lotus shares
closed at $34.375, unchanged, and Novell shares closed at
$40.125, up 12.5 cents.</p>
