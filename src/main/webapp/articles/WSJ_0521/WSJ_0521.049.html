	<p class="article-leader">DALLAS -- Southwest Savings Association, one of the first
thrifts to participate in the controversial Southwest Plan of
1988, was placed in government conservatorship Friday after
losing a struggle to overcome losses on troubled real estate
loans.
   The conservatorship, under which the federal Resolution
Trust Corp. will take over management of the thrift, was
imposed two years to the day after Southwest Savings entered
the Southwest Plan by acquiring four insolvent Texas thrifts
with $2 billion in non-cash assistance from the government.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The Southwest Plan, before it expired in a storm of
criticism at the end of 1988, was the program launched by the
now-defunct Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp. to stave
off further insurance-fund losses from failing Texas thrifts.
Under the plan, scores of Texas thrifts were merged into 15
institutions that received varying degrees of government
assistance, including notes and income-tax breaks, to keep
them afloat.</p>
<p>For some of the new thrifts, such as First Gibraltar
Savings Association, the government assistance has led to
high profits for their owners and prompted calls in Congress
for a review and possible restructuring of the deals. But
Southwest Savings, which became Texas's third-largest thrift
with $5.4 billion in assets, wasn't destined to be among the
survivors, and a second government intervention was widely
expected.</p>
<p>The bulk of the assistance Southwest had received, or $1.5
billion, was in income and capital guarantees to cover losses
on $2.6 billion in assets held by the four thrifts it
acquired. The government never came through with guarantees
to cover Southwest's own troubled loans and repossessed real
estate, which proved to be the thrift's undoing.</p>
<p>By March 31 of this year, Southwest's tangible capital had
fallen to a negative $303.5 million, "with no prospect of
replenishment without federal assistance," the Office of
Thrift Supervision said Friday when it appointed the RTC as
Southwest's conservator.</p>
<p>The RTC named Steve Deaton as managing conservator to
replace C. Todd Miller as the chief executive of the thrift,
which has $3.9 billion in deposits and 69 branches across
Texas.</p>
<p>The Office of Thrift Supervision was careful to note the
accomplishments of Mr. Miller's management, pointing out that
operating costs had been reduced by almost $76 million during
the past two years and that the thrift had sold almost $404.6
million in repossessed real estate and other assets.</p>
<p>While in conservatorship, Southwest will continue to be
owned by the Caroline Hunt Trust Estate and its
beneficiaries, according to an RTC spokesman. The Office of
Thrift Supervision will have to place Southwest Savings in
receivership before it is offered for sale or liquidated, the
RTC spokesman said.</p>
<p>Southwest Savings has been another disappointing
investment for Caroline Hunt, heiress of oil man H.L. Hunt.
Through her Rosewood Corp. holding company, she has also
taken sizeable losses in real estate and in her holdings of
First Executive Corp., the Los Angeles-based insurance
holding company.</p>
<p>In other RTC actions in Texas on Friday, the agency was
appointed receiver for the $68.7 million First Savings & Loan
Association of Borger and for the $178.9 million First
Federal Savings and Loan Association of Conroe. New federal
mutual associations, to be managed by the RTC, were formed to
acquire certain assets and liabilities of each of the
institutions.</p>
<p>The RTC on Friday also approved the sale of Cornerstone
Federal Savings Association of Houston to Great Southwest
Savings of Houston at an estimated cost to the RTC of $24.3
million. Great Southwest acquired all of Cornerstone's $83.8
million in deposits and just over half of its $82.4 million
in assets.</p>
<p>In other Resolution Trust Corp. thrift sales and
liquidations:</p>
<p>--  Broadview Federal Savings Bank, Cleveland, with $1.35
billion in assets, was sold to First Federal Savings Bank,
Cleveland, a unit of Charter One Financial Inc., Cleveland.
The transaction is expected to cost the RTC $188 million.
First Federal will pay a premium of $11.9 million to take
control of $1.4 billion in Broadview deposits. It will
purchase $930 million of Broadview's assets and have three
months to return nonperforming assets.</p>
<p>--  Horizon Federal Savings & Loan Association, Metarie,
La., with assets of $358.5 million and liabilities and
deposits of $500.4 million, was closed Friday. Depositors
will be paid their funds. The payoff is expected to begin
Monday.</p>
<p>--  First Federal Savings & Loan Association of Southeast
Missouri, in Cape Girardeau, Mo., with $270.1 million in
assets was sold to Cape County Bank of Cape Girardeau, Cape
Girardeau, Mo. That transaction is expected to cost the RTC
$68.3 million. Cape County Bank will pay a premium of $2.5
million for $322.9 million in deposits, and take control of
$251.2 million of assets with options to return the
nonperforming assets.</p>
<p>--  Shawnee Federal Savings, with $221 million in assets,
Topeka, Kan., was sold to Bank IV, Topeka. The sale is
expected to cost the RTC roughly $18.2 million. Bank IV will
pay a $1.5 million premium for the $225 million in deposits,
and it will purchase $211.7 million of the assets, with
options to return the nonperforming ones.</p>
<p>--  The 10 offices of Phenix Federal Savings & Loan
Association, Phenix City, Ala., were sold to nine financial
institutions. Phenix Federal had total assets of $145.8
million and total liabilities of $177.4 million. The
acquirers will pay a premium of $2.7 million, and will also
purchase $5.5 million of the insolvent thrift's assets.</p>
<p>On Friday, the Resolution Trust Corp. also seized
Jonesboro Federal Savings & Loan Association, Jonesboro, La.,
which had $54.5 million in assets.</p>
