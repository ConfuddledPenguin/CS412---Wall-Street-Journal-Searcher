	<p class="article-leader">Par Pharmaceutical, Inc., Spring Valley, N.Y., reported a
$5.2 million net loss for the fiscal second quarter and said
it expects losses for the rest of the fiscal year.
   The net loss, equal to 47 cents a share, mainly reflects
product recalls by the Quad Pharmaceuticals subsidiary.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Sales plummeted to $13.7 million from $30.1 million. A
year earlier, net income for the second quarter ended April
1, was $2.8 million, or 25 cents a share.</p>
<p>Quad Pharmaceuticals has recalled 25 of its injectable
products because minor manufacturing changes were made
without properly following requirements of the Food and Drug
Administration. And in March, Quad adopted a voluntary
moratorium on shipments of all products subject to
FDA-approved abbreviated new drug applications.</p>
<p>Par's business also has been adversely affected by a
moratorium last year on shipments of its oral solid products.</p>
<p>For the six months ended March 31, the company had a net
loss of $5.6 million, or 51 cents a share, compared with
year-earlier net income of $5.5 million, or 49 cents a share.
Sales fell to $32.3 million from $58.1 million.</p>
