	<p class="article-leader">Synergen Inc. said that Hoffmann-La Roche Inc. plans to
discontinue support for Synergen's research program to
determine if its interlukin-1 receptor antagonist is a
potential treatment for inflammatory diseases such as
rheumatoid arthritis.
   Synergen, a Boulder, Colo., biotechnology concern, said
that payments from the U.S. unit of Switzerland's F.
Hoffmann-La Roche & Co accounted for 64% of its sponsored
research and development revenue of $11.9 million last year
and 61% of the $2 million it received in sponsored R&D during
the first quarter this year. But Synergen said it doesn't
expect Roche's termination of support to hurt its development
schedule for the product.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Synergen said it hopes to file with the Food and Drug
Administration later this year so that it can begin human
clinical trials with the protein, known as IL-1ra.</p>
