	<p class="article-leader">After a four-week civil trial, a jury in U.S. District
Court in Baltimore Friday found that Contel Corp. defamed two
former employees, and awarded the two men a total of $8
million in punitive and compensatory damages, according to
one of the plaintiff's lawyers.
   William P. Kamachaitis, former president of Contel's
Fairfax, Va., federal-systems sector, was awarded $2.5
million in punitive damages and $2 million in compensatory
damages. Thomas Hassey, former vice president for human
resources of the sector, won $1.5 million in punitive damages
and $2 million in compensatory damages, said Mr. Hassey's
lawyer, Charles F. Chester, of Rockville, Md.</p>

corporate officers in statements made to business
publications and Contel employees, as well as in internal
memos.</p>
<p>Mr. Kamachaitis and Mr. Hassey were dismissed in May 1987.</p>
