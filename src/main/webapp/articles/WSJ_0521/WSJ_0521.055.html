	<p class="article-leader">PHILADELPHIA -- Philadelphia Electric Co. appealed an
April 19 decision by the Pennsylvania Public Utility
Commission that granted the utility only $242.2 million of
the $548.6 million rate increase it requested.
   Philadelphia Electric said that by denying the rate
request, the commission unconstitutionally denied
shareholders any return on their investment in Limerick No. 2
nuclear power station. In denying most of the rate increase,
the commission disallowed the company's request to recover
the costs of building and operating the plant.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>In the appeal, filed with the Commonwealth Court of
Pennsylvania, Philadelphia Electric alleged that the
commission approved various aspects of the project in the
mid-1980s, and then "suddenly reversed course" this year.</p>
