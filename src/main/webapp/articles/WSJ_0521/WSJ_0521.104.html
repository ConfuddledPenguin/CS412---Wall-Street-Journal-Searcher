	<p class="article-leader">OS/2, the new PC operating system Microsoft announced for
IBM three years ago, today is an also-ran. It requires too
much computer memory, and some promised features haven't
arrived. It also can't run Windows applications.
   Microsoft has sold only a few hundred thousand copies of
OS/2. Mr. Gates seems to be trying to lower expectations for
it, saying he now expects it to coexist with the current PC
standard, MS-DOS, for years instead of replacing it.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>With IBM, Microsoft is at work on a new version of OS/2
that will run Windows. It will also make better use of the
most popular microprocessor, Intel's 80386. "We have to
provide a seamless, easy transition from the old to the new,"
says Microsoft president Jon Shirley. "That's something we've
failed to do in prior versions of OS/2." Mr. Gates insists
OS/2 will emerge later in the decade as the operating
software of choice for PC users.</p>
<p>"People said we'd fail" with Windows, he says. "Now
they're saying we'll fail with OS/2. We won't."</p>
<p>For Microsoft's sake, it better not. OS/2 is the only
operating system the company controls with as much power as
Unix, an older system created by American Telephone &
Telegraph, which is the standard for engineering and
scientific computers and is slowly catching on with
white-collar workers.</p>
