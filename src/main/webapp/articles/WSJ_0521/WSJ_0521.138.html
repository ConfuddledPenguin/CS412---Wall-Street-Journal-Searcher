	<p class="article-leader">VANCOUVER, British Columbia -- First City Financial Corp.,
which is controlled by Vancouver's Belzberg family, said it
is mulling a departure from the stock arbitrage business,
citing shrinking takeover activity and sour investments.
   "We're thinking of getting out of it altogether," Samuel
Belzberg, First City chairman, president, and chief executive
officer, said after the company's annual meeting.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Mr. Belzberg, whose investment savvy and reputation as a
corporate raider helped First City rack up big earnings
during the 1980s takeover boom -- often by acquiring stakes
in U.S. companies, threatening a takeover and then selling
out at a profit -- said losses on risk arbitrage trading
"fully account" for the sharp drop in first-quarter earnings
from First City's investment and trading arm, traditionally a
key profit generator.</p>
<p>For the quarter ended March 31, gains on investments and
trading totaled just 1.7 million Canadian dollars (US$1.4
million), he said, down from C$26.6 million a year earlier.
First City previously blamed falling earnings from its
investment and trading business for the company's poor
first-quarter earnings, released earlier last week, which
fell to C$5.2 million, or 10 Canadian cents a share, from
profit before special items of C$31.7 million, or 58 Canadian
cents a share, a year earlier, when a gain on the sale of an
investment made net income C$155.4 million, or C$2.82 a
share. Revenue rose to C$243.5 million from C$241.1 million.</p>
<p>Mr. Belzberg didn't specify which takeover-stock plays
went bad, though he distinguished between First City's risk
arbitrage activity and "long-term" investments, such as its
11.5% stake in Armstrong World Industries Inc. Indeed, most
of First City's securities investment profits in recent years
stem not from risk arbitrage, but from the sale of its
holdings in its own would-be targets, such as Armstrong.</p>
<p>Armstrong, a Lancaster, Pa.-based building products
company that has succeeded in outmaneuvering the Belzbergs,
hasn't followed the traditional script, however. First City's
paper loss on its Armstrong stake is about US$30 million.</p>
<p>W. Gordon Lancaster, executive vice president and chief
financial officer, said First City's New York arbitrage group
got burned in recent months on several deals that fizzled,
including Hilton Hotels Corp.'s failed attempt to auction its
assets. "As the takeover world has slowed, so has arbitrage,"
Mr. Lancaster said.</p>
<p>"We've made about the equivalent of a bond yield" on
arbitrage activity, he said, "which at the end of the day,
isn't a very sexy return."</p>
<p>Mr. Lancaster said that First City's portfolio of
arbitrage stocks now is about C$60 million, down from about
C$200 million at its peak, and that the company will probably
"unwind" the balance. Arbitrage stocks make up only a small
part of First City's securities investment and trading
assets, which totaled C$1.32 billion at the end of 1989.</p>
