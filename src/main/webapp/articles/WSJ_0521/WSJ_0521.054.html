	<p class="article-leader">AUCKLAND, New Zealand -- Carter Holt Harvey Ltd. said it
is buying Brierley Investments Ltd.'s 50% stake in their
joint-venture packaging concern Printpac-UEB for 110 million
New Zealand dollars (US$63.1 million).
   The New Zealand timber, building materials and packaging
concern said the purchase price will include NZ$30.5 million
and an issue of 30 million Carter Holt shares valued at
NZ$2.65 each.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The purchase, which would be retroactive to April 1, is
subject to approval by New Zealand's antitrust regulators,
Carter Holt said.</p>
<p>Carter Holt and Brierley formed Printpac-UEB in 1989 as a
vehicle to buy UEB Packaging Ltd.</p>
<p>Richard Carter, executive chairman of Carter Holt, said
that following the purchase of UEB Packaging last year, the
joint venture "is now a large, finely focussed and mature"
organization. "It is, therefore, now more appropriately
designed to operate under a single ownership structure," Mr.
Carter said.</p>
<p>Bruce Hancox, chairman of Brierley Investments, said his
company is satisfied with its investment in Carter Holt
through the share issue.</p>
