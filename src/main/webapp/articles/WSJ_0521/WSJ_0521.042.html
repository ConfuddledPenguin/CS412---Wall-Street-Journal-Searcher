	<p class="article-leader">KANSAS CITY, Mo. -- Cerner Corp. said it agreed in
principle to buy, for $11 each, 505,662 of its common shares
held by First Chicago Capital Corp. and its affiliates.
   The maker of clinical information systems said it expects
to complete the repurchase of the 13.8% stake in about two
weeks.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The First Chicago Corp. unit will finance one-half of the
buy-back over an 18-month period, Cerner said; the remainder
will be financed through a combination of operating funds and
Cerner's existing credit lines.</p>
<p>Cerner said it has had "a long and outstanding
relationship with our venture capital partner," but
"Considering our strengthened cash flows and the long-term
potential for Cerner's products in the market place, we
believe that the opportunity to repurchase our stock at $11
per share represents a sound investment for Cerner."</p>
