	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- Attorney General Dick Thornburgh failed to
disclose that his top personal aide, Robert Ross, had shown
deception on part of a lie-detector test during a
controversial internal Justice Department investigation, a
senior department official said.
   Mr. Ross's flunking part of the lie-detector test was "one
consideration" in his decision, announced last Monday, to
resign from the department, according to the senior official.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Mr. Thornburgh has known since late last fall that Mr.
Ross and another personal aide, David Runkel, had shown
deception on lie-detector tests but chose not to disclose the
matter "because something like that can ruin careers," said
the senior official, who was designated by the attorney
general's office yesterday to answer press questions on the
issue. Mr. Runkel has repeatedly refused to comment.</p>
<p>Mr. Ross couldn't be reached for comment. Previously, he
and other Justice Department officials have said his imminent
departure and Mr. Runkel's reassignment to less prominent
duties were part of a personnel shake-up having nothing to do
with the internal Justice Department investigation.</p>
<p>Interviewed yesterday on ABC's "This Week with David
Brinkley," Mr. Thornburgh denied a report in the Los Angeles
Times that he "helped conceal" Mr. Ross's deception to
protect his longtime personal assistant.</p>
<p>The lie-detector tests were administered as part of a
departmentwide criminal probe into who had disclosed the
existence of an investigation involving the office of Rep.
William Gray (D., Pa.). The disclosure of the Gray
investigation last May prompted accusations that it was a
Republican effort to undermine the congressman's ultimately
successful race to become the No. 3 official in the House
Democratic leadership.</p>
<p>Mr. Thornburgh in December announced that the internal
department review, conducted by Federal Bureau of
Investigation agents and Criminal Division prosecutors,
produced "insufficient evidence" for a criminal prosecution
or disciplinary action against current Justice Department
employees.</p>
<p>The senior department official who spoke yesterday said
that the deception indicated by the lie-detector tests of
Messrs. Ross and Runkel produced "leads" but that those leads
yield "no evidence" that either man was the source of the
Gray disclosure.</p>
<p>Mr. Thornburgh has conceded that Mr. Runkel effectively
confirmed the disclosure about Mr. Gray to the CBS television
reporter who broadcast the first report on the matter.</p>
<p>The senior department official said that at least some of
the questions put to Mr. Ross as part of the lie-detector
test "were relevant" directly to the Gray disclosure, as
opposed to being control questions on other matters. The
attorney general and his aides "were aware there would be
some embarrassment" if it became known that Messrs. Ross and
Runkel had shown deception, the senior official said.</p>
<p>Asked directly why Mr. Thornburgh didn't disclose the
lie-detector test results at the same time that he exonerated
his aides, the senior official responded: "That assumes an
obligation to disclose {the test results}. . . . That's
debatable."</p>
<p>In a separate review of the entire matter, the Justice
Department's solicitor general, Kenneth Starr, concluded that
Mr. Thornburgh had acted appropriately within his discretion.</p>
<p>Subsequently, Senate Judiciary Chairman Joseph Biden of
Delaware, a Democratic spokesman on the Gray affair, said he
was satisfied that "any further investigation of this matter
would not provide any further information and therefore is
not warranted."</p>
