	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- Want to buy a stake in Hungary's airline or
a piece of Argentina's telephone company? Both may be
possible in the near future, as the countries of Latin
America and Eastern Europe turn increasingly toward selling
off bloated state industries as a way out of dire economic
straits.
   In the struggle to attract both capital and know-how, the
money-hungry nations of these two battered regions see
"privatization" as their best hope for the future. They are
struggling to set aside national sensitivities about foreign
ownership, and are looking for ways to allow foreign as well
as local concerns to buy into their state-run companies.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Jumping on the trend, Wall Street investment bankers like
Morgan Stanley's Peter Jones and First Boston's Pedro-Pablo
Kuczynski have already spent months jetting around Latin
America and Eastern Europe to win mandates to sell off the
more marketable government assets.</p>
<p>Many people see privatization as the key to the future
success of economies in the two regions. "I don't see any
prospect for substantial change unless there is massive
privatization," says Shahid Hussein, the World Bank's vice
president for Latin America. But the process must be closely
managed, he cautions, noting that "you have to be very
careful that you don't substitute private monopolies for
public monopolies."</p>
<p>In addition, there's a fear that graft will creep into the
process. Leaders may decide to parcel out state assets to
their cronies, causing even greater concentrations of wealth
and inequality. "In any kind of massive sale like this, when
these countries are under a lot of pressure . . . there's a
concern about corruption," says consultant Alan Stoga of
Kissinger Associates. "It depends on the leaders' ability to
control it."</p>
<p>Perhaps the biggest concern of all is that foreign
investors will simply steer clear of the state offerings.
"What if these countries give a party," asks Mr. Stoga, "and
no one comes?"</p>
<p>Despite these worries, there is a growing desire to shrink
the state in Latin America and in Eastern Europe. Mexico has
already sold off its two largest airlines, while Chile has
sold off state power stations and financial institutions.
Hungary sold its state-owned light bulb maker, Tungsram, to
Austrian bank Girozentrale, which is the only major East
European sell-off to date.</p>
<p>The process has barely begun, analysts say. "The major
cases of privatization are still ahead of us," says Mr.
Hussein, adding that Eastern Europe is better positioned than
Latin America to take advantage of the trend. "The Western
European countries," he says, "are joining together to make
sure the reform effort doesn't fail" in Eastern Europe.</p>
<p>Privatization is intimately linked to the need to boost
investment. The governments lack sufficient funds or
creditworthiness to attract the money needed to keep
inefficient state concerns afloat. As Mr. Salinas said on his
last visit to Washington, "We'd rather spend the money on
education, health and basic services. We can't afford to do
that and still carry out expensive projects like modernizing
our telephone system."</p>
<p>Indeed, the economic success of Mr. Salinas's presidency
rests partly on the successful completion of selling the
government's 55% stake in Telefonos Mexicanos, the national
telephone company. That transaction, expected late this
summer, is likely to be the largest Mexican privatization,
with the whole company's value estimated at about $7 billion.</p>
<p>Like Margaret Thatcher's landmark sale of British Telecom
PLC, the Telmex sale will be a gauge of the level of investor
interest in state assets, and a test case for the
government's argument that privatization produces greater
efficiencies and stanches the hemorrhage of state funds
needed to keep such concerns solvent.</p>
<p>The biggest challenge may be overcoming sensitivities
about foreign investment, both in gringo-obsessed Latin
America and in democratizing Eastern Europe. In Hungary, the
Tungsram sale has already brought widespread criticism,
because Girozentrale turned around within months of
purchasing the company and sold it to General Electric Co. of
the U.S. for almost three times the original price. In Latin
America, the prospect that banks like Citicorp will end up
owning major assets by swapping bank debt for equity also
raises hackles.</p>
<p>On a recent visit to Washington, Czechoslovak finance
minister Vaclav Klaus outlined an unusual approach to the
matter of foreign investors. His plan would give Czechoslovak
citizens first crack at least at some of the state assets.
The state would issue certificates to citizens that they
could either exchange for shares in the privatization of
their choice or sell to other local investors. Only after
this process is completed would foreign investors be allowed
to buy in.</p>
<p>But the scheme has its critics. In the end Czechoslovakia,
like many countries, may decide foreign capital is so
desperately needed that it should be invited in at once.</p>
<p>In fact, the more bankrupt the country, the more eager it
seems to be to start privatization rolling. In hard-pressed
Argentina, President Carlos Saul Menem is aggressively
pursuing a privatization plan. The national telephone
company, Empresa Nacional de Telecommunicaciones, or ENTEL,
will be an early target. The national railroad may soon
follow.</p>
<p>"The government loses $2 million a day on the railways,"
says Mr. Stoga. "You need to get rid of holes in the budget
like that."</p>
