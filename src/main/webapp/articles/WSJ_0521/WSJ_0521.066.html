	<p class="article-leader">Pic 'N' Save Corp., struggling to keep control of its
board out of the hands of an investor group led by David H.
Batchelder, put itself up for sale but hinted that it didn't
expect any bidders would emerge.
   The investor group, Girard Partners Limited Partnership,
holds a 6.6% stake in Pic 'N' Save and is soliciting consents
from shareholders to install five of its nominees on the
company's seven-member board. If the group succeeds, it has
said it would buy the company or auction it off to the
highest bidder.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Pic 'N' Save said it would provide nonpublic information
beginning today to prospective buyers who sign a
confidentiality agreement with several standstill provisions.
Girard Partners would be forced to abandon for three years
its efforts to seize control of the board under one of the
provisions.</p>
<p>Pic 'N' Save's action appears to be a gambit to placate
investors who are moving toward Girard's camp. Pic 'N' Save
wants "to remove any doubts in the minds of our
shareholders," that value will be "maximized" through the
company's recently-modified operating plan, Lewis B.
Merrifield III, chairman and chief executive officer, said.</p>
<p>Pic 'N' Save, a Dominguez, Calif., retailer of close-out
merchandise, has a market value of about $493 million, based
on its current stock price. In national over-the-counter
trading Friday, the shares climbed 87.5 cents to $13.875. The
announcement, which came during the session, fueled trading
as more than 1.6 million shares changed hands.</p>
<p>Because it's difficult to borrow money under current
credit-market conditions, "the board has serious
reservations. . . . as to whether a proposal reflecting the
inherent value of the company will be forthcoming," Mr.
Merrifield said.</p>
<p>In an interview, he said that prospects for a bid were
somewhat better from a "strategic buyer," such as another
retailer, who might not need to borrow funds to make an
acquisition. In the past year, however, the company hasn't
received a single expression of interest from anyone, he
added.</p>
<p>Pic 'N' Save said its financial advisers would begin
"actively" contacting a "lengthy" list of potential bidders
today. A deadline for offers was set for June 20, the day of
the annual shareholders' meeting.</p>
<p>Some analysts doubted that the company could attract any
offers above its current market value. "The takeover premium
is already in the stock," said Sarah Stack, an analyst at
Bateman Eichler, Hill Richards Inc. in Los Angeles. On the
strength of Pic 'N' Save's business prospects, the shares
should be selling at under $10 a share, she thinks.</p>
<p>Ms. Stack also has said that Pic 'N' Save investors are
unhappy with the company's financial performance and may be
receptive to Girard's proposals. Last week, a former Pic 'N'
Save executive who owns about 1.4 million shares, or 4% of
the stock, agreed to support Girard.</p>
<p>In a letter mailed to shareholders late last week, Mr.
Merrifield disparaged qualifications of some of the Girard
nominees. Only one of more than a dozen takeover attempts
were completed by T. Boone Pickens while Mr. Batchelder was
part of his team, the letter stated. Of five public retail
companies run by Robert J. McNulty, only two reported an
operating profit for any period while Mr. McNulty was in
control, according to the letter.</p>
<p>Mr. Batchelder didn't return telephone calls made to his
office in La Jolla, Calif. Mr. McNulty couldn't be reached
over the weekend.</p>
