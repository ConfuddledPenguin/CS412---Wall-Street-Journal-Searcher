	<p class="article-leader">SAN JUAN BASIN ROYALTY TRUST said it won't pay a cash
distribution to stock of record May 31, because expenses
exceeded revenue by about $180,000. The Fort Worth,
Texas-based trust said it has been notified that royalty
income may be negative or negligible for the next several
months because of the cost for anticipated drilling of coal
seam natural gas wells, low seasonal demand for natural gas
and seasonally depressed natural gas prices.</p>
