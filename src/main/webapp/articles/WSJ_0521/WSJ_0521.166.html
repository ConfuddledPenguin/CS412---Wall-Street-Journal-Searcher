	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- The Department of Veterans Affairs for the
first time acknowledged a link between cancer and exposure to
Agent Orange, a herbicide used in the Vietnam War, and
announced it will pay disability benefits to Vietnam veterans
with soft-tissue sarcomas.
   In March, the VA said it would grant disability benefits
to Vietnam veterans with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, another rare
cancer. It was the first time the government recognized a
connection between cancer and service in Southeast Asia. That
conclusion was based on a Centers for Disease Control study
that found a correlation between non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and
service in Vietnam.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>But the CDC study didn't find any connection betwen
exposure to Agent Orange and cancer. Veterans groups have
long contended that exposure to Agent Orange has led to a
higher incidence of cancer among Vietnam veterans, and in its
ruling Friday, the VA department conceded that there may be
such a connection.</p>
<p>The latest decision rejects part of the CDC study, which
didn't find a link between service in Vietnam and five other
cancers, including soft-tissue sarcomas. But a VA advisory
committee reviewed scientific literature on the connection
between soft-tissue sarcomas and exposure to herbicides
containing dioxin and recommended that cancers be considered
service-connected and eligible for benefits.</p>
<p>The ruling by VA Secretary Edward Derwinski means that
approximately 1,100 veterans or their survivors will qualify
for compensation. The department estimates it will recognize
an additional 50 new claims a year for soft-tissue sarcomas,
which are difficult-to-diagnose tumors found on muscles and
connective tissue or in body fat. The VA projects it will pay
about $8 million a year as a result of the decision.</p>
