	<p class="article-leader">ARLINGTON, Va. -- Seth E. Schofield is being promoted to
the post of president of the namesake airline unit of USAir
Group Inc., making him the top contender to succeed Chairman
Edwin I. Colodny.
   Industry analysts said the promotion, to take effect June
1, moves Mr. Schofield above his top rival for the chairman's
job, Randall Malin, who is executive vice president,
marketing, at the airline unit, USAir, and the holding
company.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Mr. Schofield, 50 years old, is being promoted from his
position as executive vice president, operations, for the
unit. He will keep that title at the holding company.</p>
<p>A company spokesman confirmed that Mr. Malin, 53, will
report to Mr. Schofield at the unit. Both executives are on
equal footing at the holding company.</p>
<p>The question of who will succeed Mr. Colodny has been the
subject of much speculation, largely fueled by the fact that
Mr. Colodny, 63, will reach the company's retirement age in
about 13 months.</p>
<p>As late as two weeks ago, Mr. Colodny stayed quiet on the
subject. At the company's annual shareholders meeting, Mr.
Colodny wouldn't say whether or not he plans to continue
running the company after he turns 65. He said such a move
would depend on board approval. "The board is well aware" of
its options, he said.</p>
<p>He declined to comment on whether he had pegged someone as
a successor. Industry experts said Mr. Colodny might look
outside the company for a candidate.</p>
<p>As president of the unit, Mr. Schofield will be succeeding
Mr. Colodny, who will retain his posts as chairman and chief
executive officer at the airline unit. Mr. Colodny also
remains chairman and president of USAir Group.</p>
<p>Messrs. Malin and Schofield are vice chairmen of USAir
Group. The two men and Mr. Colodny will continue to make up
the office of the chairman at the holding company. The
triumvirate was created a year ago in preparation for the
merger of USAir and Piedmont Airlines. The merger was
completed in August but has been hamstrung by operational and
customer service problems.</p>
