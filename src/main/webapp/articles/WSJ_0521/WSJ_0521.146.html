	<p class="article-leader">LOS ANGELES -- A former engineer at Northrop Corp.'s
now-defunct Precision Products division was sentenced in
federal court here last week to one year and one day in
prison for his role in falsifying tests on parts for the
Navy's Harrier jet.
   The engineer, Howard Hyde, 49 years old, pleaded guilty in
January to one count of conspiracy and two counts of making
false statements in connection with tests of a part that
provides stability during the Harrier's vertical take-offs
and landings.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The only other individual who was successfully prosecuted
in the fraud case is Clarence Gonsalves, 62. As previously
reported, Mr. Gonsalves, a former Precision Products manager,
was sentenced last week to three years in prison and fined
$10,000 for falsifying tests on the Air Force's air-launched
cruise missile.</p>
<p>U.S. District Judge Pamela Ann Rymer said Mr. Hyde's
lighter sentence, compared with that for Mr. Gonsalves, owed
to Mr. Hyde's "extraordinary cooperation" wth the government
at an early stage of the investigation. But she said a prison
sentence was necessary as "a signal to industry that this
kind of behavior is unacceptable."</p>
<p>Just as opening arguments in a criminal fraud trial
against Northrop were to begin earlier this year, the
aerospace concern pleaded guilty to 34 counts of making false
statements to the government in connection with testing parts
for the cruise missile and the Harrier. It also agreed to pay
$17 million in fines.</p>
<p>As part of that settlement, the Justice Department agreed
to drop 141 additional counts. It also dismissed all charges
against the two highest-ranking corporate officials
implicated in the case, who were reinstated by Northrop after
the settlement. As part of the agreement, federal authorities
also closed their investigations into alleged improprieties
related to Northrop's making of MX missile parts and the B-2
bomber.</p>

<p>Corrections & Amplifications</p>
<p>CLARENCE GONSALVES is a former manager of the now-defunct
Western Services Department, Pomona, Calif., of Northrop
Corp.'s Precision Products division, and Howard Hyde is a
former senior engineer of the department. Recent editions
mistakenly said that the Precision Products division,
Norwood, Mass., was the unit that closed.</p>
