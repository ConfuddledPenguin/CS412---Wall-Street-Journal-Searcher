	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- Facing a protest by AIDS activists, the
Department of Health and Human Services moved a step closer
to carrying out its plans to accelerate the availability of
new drugs to critically ill AIDS patients.
   The agency said its proposed policy for so-called
parallel-track distribution of promising new drugs to people
with AIDS will appear in the Federal Register today.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Also today, AIDS activists plan to demonstrate at the
National Institutes of Health to publicize their charges that
the government is spending too little money on medical
research in general and on acquired immune deficiency
syndrome in particular.</p>
<p>HHS officials first announced their intention to adopt a
parallel-track system last July. The policy will speed new
therapies prior to the completion of the extensive clinical
tests the government usually requires before drugs can come
to market. It will apply to AIDS patients who have no
therapeutic alternatives, who have an immediately
life-threatening disease and who can't participate in
clinical studies.</p>
<p>AIDS activists and some medical researchers have argued
that it doesn't make sense to deny promising treatments to
desperately ill patients, even if the drugs haven't been
fully tested.</p>
<p>The new policy will allow early distribution and the
simultaneous completion of clinical tests. "We believe we
have built sufficient safeguards into parallel track to
ensure that it neither compromises the drug approval and
clinical trials process nor delays the speedy delivery of
promising" drugs from the laboratory to the bedside,
explained James Mason, assistant secretary of HHS for health.</p>
<p>Initially, the parallel-track policy will apply only to
people with AIDS, but the HHS said it will consider whether
it should expand the policy to cover promising new drugs for
other life-threatening diseases, such as cancer. The proposed
adoption of the parallel-track system is one example of how
people facing the prospect of death from AIDS have
successfully pressured the government to change its
traditional medical practices.</p>
<p>The HHS set a July 20 deadline for public comment on the
proposed policy, which describes who is eligible for the
program and sets the criteria for selecting new drugs for
parallel-track distribution.</p>
