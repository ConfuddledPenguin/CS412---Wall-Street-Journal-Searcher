	<p class="article-leader">PHOENIX, Ariz. -- John Carway, 44-year-old president and
38% owner of Verit Industries, a real-estate concern, was
elected chairman and chief executive officer.
   Mr. Carway, an Irish businessman who acquired his stake in
Verit and became its president last November, succeeds
Malcolm Stockdale, who resigned last week as chairman and
chief executive. Mr. Stockdale, 45, resigned after Verit's
acquisition of 56% of Houston-based Iroquois Brands Ltd. was
"rescinded."</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Mr. Stockdale, along with Mr. Carway, had led Verit on the
acquisition trail in recent months in an apparent attempt to
build the company into a multi-industry concern with
interests in construction equipment, real estate and control
of toxic wastes. Many of the proposed transactions involved
target companies in need of financial aid, and two of the
proposed acquisitions had become unraveled in the past month.</p>
<p>A previous Wall Street Journal story noted that terms of
transactions proposed by Messrs. Stockdale and Carway
sometimes called for issuance of large numbers of convertible
preferred shares and often were bewilderingly complex,
sometimes involving companies in the British Isle of Man tax
haven. The story also pointed out that Mr. Carway has
convictions on his record in Ireland for check fraud and in
England for marijuana possession.</p>
<p>Verit also said Arthur Andersen & Co. was appointed
auditor of the company. A previous auditor, Touche Ross &
Co., now part of Deloitte & Touche, quit auditing Verit's
books last November after a dispute with the company over
what it said could be inadequate disclosure of consulting
fees to a company controlled by Mr. Carway.</p>
<p>Verit also announced that it earned a profit of $316,000,
or four cents a share, in its third quarter ended March 31,
on sales of $9.3 million. The company said year-earlier
figures aren't relevant because the company's structure
changed after acquisition of two home-building concerns from
Emerald Homes Limited Partnership. The company didn't provide
earnings and sales figures for the nine months.</p>
<p>Philip J. Polich, 41, formerly vice president and chief
operating officer of Verit, was named to succeed Mr. Carway
as president. Jimmy Wood, 58, president of his own
Phoenix-based real-estate investment company, was elected
executive vice president, chief operating officer and chief
financial officer.</p>
