	<p class="article-leader">PARIS -- France's industrial-production index rose 0.7% in
March from February and was up 2.4% from a year earlier,
according to seasonally adjusted figures published Friday by
the National Statistics Institute.
   The March result was slightly weaker than forecasters had
anticipated. Many economists had expected the index to make
up most of the 1.8% drop recorded in February, when energy
output was held down by unusually warm weather.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The March result put the index at 112.7, up from 111.9 in
February and 110.1 in March 1989. The index uses 1980 levels
as a base of 100.</p>
