	<p class="article-leader">News International PLC, London, which is part of the
Australian-based News Corp. Ltd., said that it is setting up
a joint venture with Burda Verwaltungs G.m.b.H., of West
Germany, for printing units in both East and West Germany.
   No financial details are being released, said a News
International spokeswoman. A "great deal of discussion on
many factors" still has to take place, she said.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The agreement, so far, includes the current Burda plant in
Darmstadt being spun off into a new joint venture company
called Burda News Druck G.m.b.H. That company will print some
of the five million Sunday magazines, a supplement
accompanying News International's British Sunday newspaper
the News Of The World. There are no other details on how the
plant will be used, said the spokeswoman.</p>
<p>The two companies also agreed in principle to set up a
joint venture to print works in East Germany, said the
spokeswoman. No sites or financing proposals have been
decided, she said.</p>
