	<p class="article-leader">MILAN, Italy -- The discount rate at the Bank of Italy,
the central bank, was reduced one full percentage point to
12.5%, effective today, in a move aimed at restoring
stability to the European Monetary System, the treasury said.
   The treasury cited development of the Italian economy and
the ad hoc budget-deficit reduction package approved by the
government on Friday.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>It was the first time the discount rate -- the interest
rate at which the Bank of Italy lends funds to commercial
banks -- was changed since March 3, 1989, when the central
bank's key rate was raised to 13.5% from 12.5%. Thus, it is a
pivotal indicator of the central bank's monetary policy and
will help commercial banks set their lending rates to the
public. Under Italian law, the treasury decides on changes in
the discount rate, following a recommendation by the Bank of
Italy governor.</p>
<p>The move didn't surprise financial markets, though many
money-market operators had believed the Bank of Italy would
wait until June before easing its monetary stance.</p>
<p>The government approved an emergency package of spending
cuts and new revenue measures that will reduce the 1990
budget deficit by 11.75 trillion lire ($9.68 billion) to 136
trillion lire.</p>
<p>The treasury said the entry of the lira into the narrow,
2.25% band in the European Monetary System in January
triggered a large inflow of foreign capital, which had
"pushed the lira to its upper limit {in the EMS}, despite
conspicuous" interventions by the Bank of Italy. The lira
continued to strengthen, despite a cut in short-term interest
rates this year, which narrowed Italy's interest-rate
differential with other European countries.</p>
