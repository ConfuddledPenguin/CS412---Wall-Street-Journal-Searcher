	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Embattled Lionel Corp. posted a wider fiscal
first-quarter loss, citing higher expenses associated with
new stores opened late last year and lower existing-store
sales.
   The loss in the quarter ended April 28 was $6 million, or
44 cents a share, vs. $3.6 million, or 27 cents a share, a
year earlier. Sales grew 7.5% to $65.9 million from $61.3
million.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Lionel, which currently operates 92 toy stores in 15
states, said it plans to open 10 stores in major metropolitan
markets in 1990.</p>
<p>The company has been under pressure from some shareholders
to find a buyer. Earlier this year it turned down investor
Robert I. Toussie's $8-a-share, or $95.4 million, offer and
got him to drop the proposal. The stock since then has been
trading well below that level.</p>
<p>Trendex Capital Management Corp., a Fort Lauderdale, Fla.,
firm representing a dissident group of Lionel shareholders
with a 5% stake, has requested that Lionel clear the way for
would-be acquirers. It also asked Lionel to empanel an
outside committee to examine Lionel's relationship with Isaac
Perlmutter and Bernard Marden.</p>
<p>Messrs. Perlmutter and Marden are principals in a
media-buying company that has Lionel as a client, and Lionel
has purchased toy inventory from companies controlled by
them. Mr. Marden provided the cash for Otis Group Inc., a
newly formed entity, to buy half of Mr. Toussie's 9.9% Lionel
stake for $7 a share the day Mr. Toussie dropped his bid.</p>
<p>Lionel has refused Trendex's requests and has declined to
meet with Trendex, calling the firm "a disgruntled,
uninformed risk-arbitrager." As for any link with between
Otis and "any entities with which Lionel does business,"
Lionel told Trendex it knows of none, adding that it is
cooperating with a Securities and Exchange Commission
investigation of the Otis stock purchase.</p>
<p>Trendex, however, has provided Lionel with stock-trade
records showing that Mr. Marden provided the capital for
Otis. The investment firm said Lionel has agreed to
reconsider its requests at a future board meeting.</p>
