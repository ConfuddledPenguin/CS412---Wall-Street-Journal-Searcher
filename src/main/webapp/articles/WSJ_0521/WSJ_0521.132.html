	<p class="article-leader">SAN FRANCISCO -- (AP) Women can't be banned from jobs that
could harm a fetus, California's highest court ruled,
upholding a challenge to a company policy that affected even
women who have no plans to have children.
   The state Supreme Court on Thursday let stand a lower
court ruling that a battery company's fetal-protection
policy, keeping fertile women away from jobs that could
expose them to low levels of lead, amounts to sex
discrimination.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The company, Milwaukee-based Johnson Controls Inc., also
has a case pending before the U.S. Supreme Court over the
same policy.</p>
<p>The California appellate decision had called the policy
"blatant, overt gender-based discrimination" based on
"unfounded, unscientific stereotypic notions about women."</p>
<p>"We are in an era of choice. A woman is not required to
become a Victorian brood mare," said the 4th District Court
of Appeal in its 3-0 ruling Feb. 28 in a case from Fullerton.</p>
<p>But in a case stemming from a Johnson Controls plant in
Minnesota, a federal appeals court had upheld the policy. The
U.S. Supreme Court is expected to rule on the issue by
mid-1991.</p>
<p>However that turns out, Thursday's action, involving state
fair-employment law, should settle the issue for California,
a state lawyer said.</p>
