	<p class="article-leader">LOS ANGELES -- An aggressive cost-cutting program should
help Chrysler Corp. have "a pretty decent second quarter" but
temporary closings at the auto maker's two minivan plants
will likely mean a "tough" third quarter, according to Vice
Chairman Gerald Greenwald.
   In an interview here Friday, Mr. Greenwald declined to be
more specific about the company's earnings expectations.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>In the first quarter, Chrysler surprised analysts with a
$5 million profit from automotive operations -- a profit the
company attributed to the belt-tightening it began last year.
Net income dropped 80%, however, to $71 million or 32 cents a
share.</p>
<p>Mr. Greenwald said Chrysler will lose roughly 60,000 to
70,000 units of minivan production this summer because of
model-changeover closings lasting one month each at the auto
maker's Canadian and U.S. assembly plants. This means
Chrysler loses revenue it would have booked when it sold
these vehicles to dealers.</p>
<p>Chrysler's retail sales might not fall by the same amount,
however, because some dealers are stockpiling 1990 model vans
to tide them over, Mr. Greenwald said.</p>
<p>He added that Chrysler is "encouraged" by dealer orders
for some other Chrysler products and wants to add more
third-quarter production for several cars, including Spirit
and Acclaim sedans.</p>
<p>In the second quarter of 1989, Chrysler posted net of $341
million, or $1.46 a share. In the third quarter, Chrysler had
an operating profit of $22 million, or 10 cents a share. Net
was $331 million, or $1.42 a share, after a credit of $309
million, or $1.32 a share, from the sale of shares in
Mitsubishi Motors Corp.</p>
<p>At the last stop on the auto maker's six-city promotional
tour here Friday, Chairman Lee A. Iacocca confirmed that
Chrysler will go ahead with plans to build the
high-performance Viper sports car it unveiled at the 1989
Detroit auto show.</p>
<p>Chrysler officials said the budget for Viper was under $50
million -- roughly what Mr. Iacocca says Chrysler spends in
one month on advertising. Viper, which will generate more
than 400 horsepower with a V-10 aluminum engine, will go on
sale in early 1992 with a price tag under $50,000.</p>
<p>Annual output eventually could total 3,000 to 5,000 units,
but only about 500 will be available in the first year of
sales.</p>
