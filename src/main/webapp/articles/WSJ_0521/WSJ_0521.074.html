	<p class="article-leader">The stampede to slap stringent new regulations on cable
television appears to be losing momentum.
   Since last year, the threat of re-regulation has hovered
over the industry like a black cloud, hammering billions of
dollars out of the stock prices of cable operators, scuttling
the proposed sale of scores of cable systems and adding to
the worries held by already-dubious lenders.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>But as the industry gathers for the annual National Cable
Television Association convention in Atlanta this week, the
most feared threats -- that local authorities could regain
the power to cap rates and cable companies might be forced to
divest some assets -- seem to be receding. A dozen warring
factions in Washington haven't reached a consensus on just
how tough any new controls on cable should be. Unless the
various House and Senate committees sponsoring bills can
agree, legislation may not even pass before the current
session in Congress ends next fall. Analysts also note that
cable is not the most burning issue facing Congress.</p>
<p>Cable industry rivals argue that the fight isn't finished.
"It's in a state of flux, and it's simply too early to call,"
says John Sodolski, president of the U.S. Telephone
Association, which represents local phone companies in their
bid to be allowed into the cable business. And no one is
saying there won't be some new regulation of cable rates or
controls on other aspects of the industry's business.</p>
<p>But an intensified lobbying effort by such industry
bigwigs as Time Warner Inc. Chairman Steven J. Ross may have
helped to blunt the most onerous proposals. Until that effort
began in earnest recently, cable operators had been
ineffectual in efforts to persuade legislators to appreciate
the benefits of cable, such as vastly expanded programming
choices, and to understand that average price rises have
closely tracked general consumer price increases.</p>
<p>Cable officials contend the campaign for re-regulation was
bound to lose strength once the industry's case could be made
and once congressmen began grappling with the nitty-gritty of
how the new rules would work. Another advantage: the
diverging interests of cable's opponents, such as telephone
companies, broadcasters and movie companies.</p>
<p>"No consensus has emerged, even among those who are intent
upon imposing additional restrictions on cable," says Robert
Thomson, a vice president of Tele-Communications Inc., the
nation's largest cable operator. "It's probably good news for
the cable industry. It indicates that maybe the underlying
reasons aren't as strong-for doing anything."</p>
<p>But some in the industry fear another year of uncertainty
could hurt worse than new regulations. And the cable industry
has other woes. Though business is generally robust, with
subscribers and cash flow on the uptick, cable stocks
continue to take a beating. Dennis Leibowitz, an analyst at
Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette, calculates that $8 billion in
market value has been wiped out of the stocks of publicly
held cable operators, which account for 45% of the industry's
subscribers. And the transaction market for cable systems,
flooded with ready sellers and eager buyers last year, is at
a virtual standstill.</p>
<p>Analysts agree that uncertainty over re-regulation is
hurting both stock prices and system sales and that, if
anything, clearly spelled out new regulations might be a
boon. More worrisome, however, are tighter credit market
conditions in the wake of the savings and loans debacle and
problems with companies overextended by leveraged buy-outs.
Banks, skittish over new federal definitions of highly
leveraged transactions -- which would include most cable
acquisition loans -- are reluctant to provide financing, even
though no major cable loan has gone into default.</p>
<p>The credit crunch "increasingly has had much more impact
on deals not getting done or on stretching them out," says
Greg Ainsworth, a broker at one of the industry's leading
brokerage concerns, Denver-based Daniels & Associates. "I
don't see deals stopping, but the volume of deals will be
much slower, and it may take several quarters until things
turn around."</p>
<p>A number of cable systems that were put on the market have
been withdrawn, and other systems have languished on the
market for months without a nibble. Closely held Falcon
Holding Group in Los Angeles earlier this month agreed to
acquire systems serving 98,700 subscribers from First
Carolina Corp. in a stock transaction valued at a reported
$1,900 a subscriber; last year, systems were fetching more
than $2,400 a subscriber.</p>
<p>"Everyone was expecting this deal not to close, but it
did," adds John Waller III, whose Waller Capital Corp.
represented the seller. "While the market isn't as strong as
it was, this should indicate that deals are still getting
done."</p>
<p>The cable business was alarmed when the first major
proposal for regulation -- a bill sponsored by Sen. John
Danforth (R., Mo.) -- came out last fall. But a Senate staff
proposal floated more recently eased off on some of the
Danforth measure's toughest provisions. Now the proposal from
the staff of Rep. John Dingell (D., Mich.), the House
commerce committee chairman, eases back even further.</p>
<p>"The Dingell bill is a sign that the debate is moving back
toward the center and away from extremes," says James P.
Mooney, president of the National Cable Television
Association, which plays a lead role in lobbying against
re-regulation. But he adds that some provisos in the Dingell
draft "really give us heartburn."</p>
<p>The Dingell draft, for example, touches on the biggest
threat to cable: the idea of placing rate regulation of all
cable services back in the hands of thousands of local
government bodies that "tend to be somewhat tumultuous and
arbitrary in their decision-making," Mr. Mooney says.</p>
<p>But the new proposal throttles back on that threat by
regulating the prices of only basic-cable channels rather
than all services. It would set federal standards that local
governments would have to follow and allow cable companies to
"tier" off, or separate, whatever channels they choose,
removing them from basic service and raising prices as the
cable operators see fit.</p>
<p>Some analysts believe Congress appears increasingly
inclined to let the Federal Communications Commission rule on
such key issues as rate regulation and vertical and
horizontal integration by cable operators. The FCC has
promised to deliver to Congress by July a comprehensive
review of the industry's behavior since cable was deregulated
by the Cable Act in 1987. Although the FCC may be inclined to
make it easier for cable's competitors to obtain the same
programming and to limit cable's ownership of competing
services such as direct broadcast satellites, the agency is
unlikely to give cities back the regulation authority they
had before cable's broad deregulation three years ago.</p>
<p>The FCC is also looking at whether to toughen the Cable
Act's definition of "effective competition," now considered
three over-the-air channels in the same market. In systems
with no such competition -- less than 5% of the total-rate
increases are restricted by the Cable Act to 5% annually.
John Reidy, an analyst at Smith Barney, Harris Upham Inc.,
calculates that if the FCC redefines effective competition as
five over-the-air signals, 70% of cable systems would be
subject to the rate-rise limits under current law.</p>
<p>The cable industry launched a somewhat belated lobbying
blitz defined by repeated, personal visits. Time Warner's two
executives, Mr. Ross and President N.J. Nicholas, have
lobbied in Washington half a dozen times each this spring.</p>
<p>Gustave Hauser, chairman of cable-system operator Hauser
Communications Inc., met last week with two of cable's
harshest critics, Sen. Al Gore (D., Tenn.) and Sen. Ernest
Hollings (D., S.C.). "A lot of the urgency to just reach out
and regulate seems to have diminished," he says. Legislators
"want to do something, but something a lot less ferocious."</p>
<p>Says Tim Boggs, the Washington vice president for Time
Warner and a key lobbyist on the issue: "We're delivering a
very clear message" to Congress, "that what the industry
desires is certainty -- and certainty is reached by reaching
a compromise" on legislation.</p>
