	<p class="article-leader">Interlake Corp. said it completed the sale of its Arwood
investment casting unit's assets to a Wyman-Gordon Co. unit,
for about $54 million.
   Interlake, an Oak Brook, Ill.-maker of engineered
materials and handling and packaging systems, said proceeds
from the sale were used to prepay bank debt.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Arwood had 1989 sales of about $89 million; Interlake's
overall sales were $912.9 million. Investment casting is a
process which produces a highly finished product that
requires little additional processing.</p>
<p>Interlake last year borrowed heavily in a
recapitalization, including a special dividend to
shareholders that is generally thought to have deflected any
interest from what was then seen as a potential suitor.</p>
