	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- The mood in the currency market hasn't gotten
much friendlier toward the dollar, though selling pressure
has abated.
   The dollar was propped up late last week by traders buying
to cover previous sales that helped push the dollar down too
far too fast in recent weeks. But traders say the global mix
of interest rates probably will keep it from rising very high
in the near term.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Many analysts think U.S. interest rates are poised to edge
down because economic growth is apparently slowing. At the
same time, Japan and West Germany are expected to keep rates
around current levels or raise them to combat inflation.</p>
<p>As long as there are expectations for lower U.S. rates,
the dollar isn't expected to draw heavy buyers.</p>
<p>Declining interest rates generally tend to undercut a
currency by lessening purchases of investments denominated in
the unit. Also, yields on deposits of the unit are less
attractive in the Euro-currency market when rates decline.</p>
<p>"I think we'll see a little more dollar selling emerge. I
don't think we'll go too much higher," says Rick Porter,
manager of corporate trading at Westpac Banking Corp., New
York. "I'm in the sell-dollar camp" for the very short run,
he says.</p>
<p>Late Friday here, the dollar was quoted at 153.00 yen and
1.6477 marks, compared with 152.14 yen and 1.6495 marks late
Thursday. It was little changed from the week-earlier levels
of 152.65 yen and 1.6478 marks.</p>
<p>In early trading in Tokyo Monday, the dollar was quoted at
153.33 yen, up from Friday's Tokyo close of 152.90 yen.
Meanwhile, the dollar was trading at about 1.6510 marks.</p>
<p>Short covering rescued the dollar last week after it
dropped very close to an important psychological support at
150 yen. However, the dollar is still well below month-ago
levels of 158 yen and 1.67 marks. Even more short covering
this week won't lift the dollar anywhere near its month-ago
levels, traders say.</p>
<p>It has been tough for economists to get a handle on U.S.
rates this year because of mixed signals about growth and
inflation. But many think the Federal Reserve may get leeway
to ease its monetary policy slightly if a number of sectors
remain limp.</p>
<p>"Most people still believe the next move out of the Fed is
likely to be toward lower rates. That limits the upside for
the dollar," says Steven Wood, director of financial markets
research at Bank of America, San Francisco.</p>
<p>On the other hand, lower rates aren't seen likely in Japan
and West Germany soon.</p>
<p>The Bank of Japan may drain a substantial amount of funds
from the banking system in the near term to keep rates up and
prevent the yen from entering another nosedive, analysts say.
Persistent inflationary pressures are also expected to cause
the Japanese central bank to lean toward tightening.</p>
<p>Growth in Japan's broad money supply, M2 plus certificates
of deposit, climbed from an annual rate of 11.6% in March to
13.6% in April, the fastest clip since December 1976.</p>
<p>A Bank of Japan official attributed April's high rate to a
large inflow of funds from areas that aren't included in the
broad money-supply measure and to tax payments to local
governments.</p>
<p>Although the official termed those influences temporary,
he said the generally quick-paced money-supply growth is
worrisome. Japan has had double-digit growth in its broad
money supply for five consecutive months.</p>
<p>In West Germany, the Bundesbank is expected to keep a
tight clamp on credit before monetary union goes into effect
July 2. Although economists have played down the financial
markets' inflation fears, price pressures are still expected
to increase in both West Germany and East Germany after the
West German mark becomes the official currency of the weaker
nation.</p>
<p>"The clear risk is that rates would move somewhat higher"
in Japan and West Germany, says Mr. Wood of Bank of America.</p>
<p>While the dollar isn't expected to strengthen much against
the mark and the yen anytime soon, a free fall isn't seen as
probable either.</p>
<p>The dollar usually attracts flight-to-quality buying when
nervousness about German monetary union flares up. Also, any
weakness in Japan's stock and bond markets tends to send
traders flocking to the dollar. In fact, the dollar fared
well earlier this year because of those factors.</p>
<p>Some economists believe the dollar's softness will be a
short-lived phenomenon.</p>
<p>"The dollar has more upside potential from these levels
than downside," says David Resler, chief economist at Nomura
Securities International Inc., New York.</p>
<p>"The dollar has declined enough against the Deutsche mark,
and it is unsustainably weak at these levels," he says,
adding that the dollar may strengthen in coming months. The
dollar is currently almost 20% below 1989's intraday peak of
2.0475 marks, on June 15.</p>
<p>Mr. Resler bases his bullish forecast on expectations that
U.S. inflationary pressures will let up in coming months now
that weather-related food and energy price jumps from earlier
this year are gone. The annualized inflation rate, he says,
may fall to 3.5% to 4% from the current 4.7%.</p>
<p>On the Commodity Exchange in New York Friday, gold for
current delivery rose $5.20 to $374.70 an ounce. The close
was the highest since April 24. Estimated volume was a very
heavy five million ounces.</p>
<p>In Hong Kong Monday, gold was quoted at $373.45 an ounce.</p>
