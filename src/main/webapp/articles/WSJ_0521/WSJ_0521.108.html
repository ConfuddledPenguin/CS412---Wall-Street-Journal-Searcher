	<p class="article-leader">Small may be beautiful -- but not on the over-the-counter
market these days. The National Association of Securities
Dealers recently announced plans to tighten its listing
requirements early next year, removing hundreds of the
market's smallest stocks from its Nasdaq automated trading
system.
   That creates a quandary for individuals who own small OTC
shares. Should they sell stocks that are likely to be
delisted, or should they hang on?</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Delisting would relegate the stocks to a much more obscure
part of the market, making them even tougher to trade and
harder to follow than they are now, professionals say. As a
result, individual investors, who are by far the dominant
players in these illiquid shares, may see their holdings drop
sharply in value, at least in the near term.</p>
<p>"The few stocks I've traded that got knocked off the
(Nasdaq) system really suffered precipitous price drops,"
said Norman Kadehjian, an OTC trader at Josephthal & Co.
"I've been surprised at the tremendous damage" delisting can
bring, he said.</p>
<p>Of course, delisted stocks won't fall into total oblivion.
They'll trade on the NASD's new "electronic bulletin board"
and also on the so-called pink sheets, price lists published
daily on pink paper by New Jersey-based National Quotation
Bureau Inc., a unit of Commerce Clearing House Inc.</p>
<p>The first rule for investors in stocks that face
delisting, professionals say, is to avoid a knee-jerk
response. "Don't panic out," said Lawrence J. Goldstein,
general partner of Santa Monica Partners in New York and an
active investor in fitfully traded OTC stocks. "If you're
happy with the company, even though it may suffer a setback
in market value in the short run (as a result of delisting),
in the long run value will out."</p>
<p>Still, the pros do stress that this is a time to review
portfolios and to cast a hard eye on those cheap stocks that
may be languishing forgotten at $1 or less a share.</p>
<p>Many investors in such "penny stocks" didn't start out
that way, but simply stood by as their shares drifted down in
price over the years. "These price levels suggest a lot of
people just forgot about these stocks or are just too
embarrassed to sell them, in which case this may be an
opportunity to take the tax loss," said Boniface Zaino, a
managing director at Trust Co. of the West. "You've got to
have a very strong conviction to hold these kinds of stocks,"
he said, otherwise, "it's best to sell."</p>
<p>The revised listing standards won't be written in stone
until they get the final goahead from the Securities and
Exchange Commission, expected later this year. But NASD
officials say they don't anticipate any significant changes
in their proposal.</p>
<p>If approved as is, the plan would require all
Nasdaq-listed stocks to have: a "bid," or selling, price of
at least $1 (there is no price requirement currently); at
least $2 million in assets (up from $750,000); capital and
surplus of at least $1 million (up from $375,000); two firms
that make a market in the shares (instead of one); and
"public float," or shares in the public's hands, with a
market value of at least $200,000 (there is no float
requirement now).</p>
<p>More than 950 companies fail to meet at least one of those
criteria, according to research by Salomon Brothers Inc.;
some 725 of them, with a market value of over $3 billion,
don't measure up on price alone. NASD officials estimate,
however, that about 500 companies won't pass muster by the
time the new rules take effect.</p>
<p>Once a stock is delisted, it would have to meet even
stiffer requirements to get back on the Nasdaq system,
including a minimum bid price of $3 a share.</p>
<p>Just because a company may be a likely candidate for
delisting doesn't necessarily mean it's a bad investment.
"There are legitimate, good low-priced stocks," said Anthony
Broy, president of Hill Thompson Magid & Co., which makes
markets in OTC shares. "To penalize them all, I personally
think is throwing out the baby with the bath water."</p>
<p>But fear of potential delisting has already hurt many
small stocks since the NASD board announced the revised
listing standards in March. "A lot of these stocks are going
down in price because people are not trading them" in advance
of the rule changes, said Robert Flaherty, editor of OTC
Review magazine.</p>
<p>For instance, Nasdaq stocks that sell for less than $1 a
share underperformed the rest of the Nasdaq market by about
three percentage points in March and April, the Salomon
Brothers research shows. They lagged despite a heavy
concentration in sectors such as technology and health care
"that otherwise should have performed quite well," said Eric
Sorensen, Salomon's director of quantitative research.
"People just seem to have backed away" from cheap stocks
since the rules became public, he said.</p>
<p>Many OTC specialists say that much sharper price declines
can be expected in the months to come. "These stocks will
definitely go down with delisting. I'd stake anything on
that," said Walter Carucci, president of Carr Securities, an
OTC market-maker. "As it gets closer to the date, this will
become more and more of a factor" in performance, he
predicted.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, many low-priced stocks are scrambling to avoid
delisting by means of reverse stocks splits. Carom Capital
Corp. said the pending Nasdaq changes were the primary reason
behind its 1-for-4 reverse split in early May. Carom
shareholders have seen their stakes increase in value by
almost 17% since the split.</p>
<p>But reverse splits won't necessarily benefit investors. In
fact, traders say, the general rule is that such maneuvers
erode -- not build -- shareholder value. "With 25 years of
experience, I can tell you that unless the company hires an
investment banker or something to drum up interest, when a
reverse split takes place, the price always goes down," said
Carr's Mr. Carucci.</p>
<p>Consider Compuflight Inc. and Cybermedic Inc. The two
small OTC companies have each lost about 30% of shareholder
value since recent reverse splits.</p>
<p>Investors who decide to brave delisting will have a much
harder time getting information about their investments once
they fall off Nasdaq. "They'll have much less visibility
because there won't be the (market) float or sponsorship for
the press to cover them, and brokers won't hype them now,"
said OTC Review's Mr. Flaherty.</p>
<p>Even though the stocks will be on Nasdaq's bulletin board,
investors won't be able to look up the prices in the
newspaper, and even their brokers will have to call dealers
for quotes. And the dealers won't be obliged, as they are
now, to stand behind those quotes when brokers actually want
to execute a trade.</p>
<p>Less visibility and more uncertainty will tend to reduce
liquidity, widening the spread between bid and asked prices,
which means these stocks will be more expensive to trade. It
also means that individuals will have to be shrewder and to
shop around more to get a fair shake on price.</p>

<p>Friday's Market Activity</p>
<p>Over-the-counter stocks zoomed past exchange-listed issues
in the year's busiest trading session.</p>
<p>The Nasdaq Composite Index rose 2.57 points, or 0.6%, to
448.31, bucking the 0.4% decline in the Dow Jones Industrial
Average.</p>
<p>Volume jumped to a daily record for the year of 191.4
million shares, up from 171.4 million. Advancing stocks
outpaced decliners 1,060 to 872, as 156 shares climbed to new
highs and 75 hit new lows.</p>
<p>Peter Da Puzzo, co-head of world-wide equities for
Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc., said he continues to see signs
that investors are buying smaller stocks in expectation that
the OTC market will catch up with the recent gains of the Dow
Jones industrials.</p>
<p>Telefonos de Mexico, Mexico's nationwide telephone
company, weighed in with more than 17.6 million American
depositary receipts changing hands. David Learned, sales
manager of foreign equities trading at Shearson, cited the
recent approval by Mexico's lower house of congress of a plan
to privatize the nation's banks. Some investors are
speculating that the Mexican government will eventually sell
its remaining portion of Telefonos to the public, Mr. Learned
said. He added that some investors also are more optimistic
about the Mexican economy. Telefonos rose 1/32 to 1 11/16.</p>
<p>In other activity, Microsoft jumped 3 1/2 to 68 1/4 after
Cowen & Co. analyst Michele S. Preston "aggressively"
recommended purchase of the stock. Tomorrow, Microsoft is due
to unveil its long-awaited Windows 3.0 software program.</p>
<p>Ms. Preston said in an interview that she believes
combined revenue for the new product and related software
could exceed $1 billion in the next year. She also raised her
earnings estimate for Microsoft's fiscal 1991 ending June 30
to $3.50 a share from $3 a share.</p>
<p>Investors flocked to an initial public offering by
Mid-American Waste Systems, a non-hazardous solid waste
management business based in Winchester, Ohio. Priced at $24
a share, Mid-American jumped 4 1/2 to 28 1/2 on volume of
more than 3.6 million shares in its first day of trading.</p>
