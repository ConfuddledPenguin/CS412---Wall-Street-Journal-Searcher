	<h3>International: Japan's NTT Loosens Its `Family' Ties</h3>

	<p class="article-leader">TOKYO -- Many of the big victories in the struggle to
enter Japan's market don't involve knocking down formal trade
barriers. They aren't even multibillion-dollar export
contracts.
   They are foreign companies' first penetrations into the
tight-knit Japanese corporate "families" that work closely
together on a wide range of products.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>That was the significance of Nippon Telegraph & Telephone
Corp.'s announcement last week that it had selected three
foreign companies -- American Telephone & Telegraph Co.'s
AT&T International Inc. unit and Motorola Inc., along with
Telefon AB L.M. Ericsson of Sweden -- plus seven Japanese
partners, to develop its next-generation mobile-telephone
system.</p>
<p>Analysts say the size of the contracts probably wasn't
very big. (Terms of the agreement weren't disclosed). But
they could ultimately give those companies a large chunk of
Japan's burgeoning mobile-phone market, which, according to
Michael Jeremy of Baring Securities Ltd., could grow to 6.5
million users by 1998 from an estimated 400,000 today.</p>
<p>While AT&T has tried to modify its U.S. equipment for
Japan, "it's difficult for NTT to find something they can
use," says Allan Yoshimura, managing director of AT&T Japan's
network systems group. "By participating more closely in the
designs, it's a lot easier for us to address the specific
needs of NTT."</p>
<p>That's quite a change. Almost all NTT's procurement
previously went to its "family" companies, suppliers like NEC
Corp., Fujitsu Ltd., Hitachi Ltd. and Oki Electric Industry
Co. Even when it opened bids to outsiders, the family
companies had long been working with their "parent" to learn
equipment plans and to help design specifications. It was
nearly impossible for foreign companies to compete.</p>
<p>"This kind of long-term participation is traditional in
Japan, and it has puzzled some foreign companies as to why
they're not welcomed as a bidder on technologies where they
feel they can offer a competitive project," says Michael
Mintz, director of Dow Chemical Japan Ltd.'s office of
technology, who is pushing to get greater foreign access to
Japanese research. "The reason is that a number of `partners'
have been working with the future purchaser for many years."</p>
<p>Indeed, in many sectors, U.S. companies, frustrated with
years of low market share in Japan, are now pushing hard to
get equal access to future product plans. In some cases, the
access is limited because of keiretsu, formal networks
between manufacturers and suppliers, as well as banks and
other affiliated companies. Sometimes the exclusionary ties
are less formal but just as strong.</p>
<p>The semiconductor industry is a good case study in trying
to break into those relationships. In 1986, with the U.S.
share of the Japanese market below 10% and fading, the two
governments signed a five-year accord aimed at boosting
American sales here. For three years, market share stayed
stagnant, the U.S. imposed sanctions, and both sides traded
accusations.</p>
<p>But in the past year, the acrimony has faded and the two
sides have been working more closely together. Consumer
electronics is an area where the U.S. semiconductor market
share has been particularly low. For years, Japanese
companies simply argued that U.S. companies didn't make the
right kind of chips. But earlier this year, a bilateral
consumer task force drew up a report of Japanese makers'
needs and American supplier capacity, with plans on how to
match the two.</p>
<p>Similarly, high-definition television sets will go on sale
in the next couple of years, and Japanese electronics
companies are scouting around for suppliers. The old approach
would have been to contact informally their own semiconductor
divisions, and perhaps other friendly domestic companies. But
last month, top executives from all the major Japanese
electronics companies flew to San Francisco and gave detailed
blueprints of their HDTV sets to American semiconductor
companies.</p>
<p>"If you want to design integrated circuits" for the HDTV
system, "this tells you what it is, and where it's going, and
gives you three to five years to develop the product," says
David A. Hytha, president of the U.S. Semiconductor Industry
Association's Japan office and managing director of AT&T
Microelectronics' Japan office. "It's extraordinarily
valuable."</p>
<p>American auto-parts companies are also clamoring for more
early information. The U.S. says its share of the Japanese
market is under 1% and "one of the crucial issues is access
to the design phase," says a U.S. government official. In
order to stave off threatened sanctions last month, Japanese
industry officials met in Las Vegas to discuss ways of
plugging in more American parts.</p>
<p>In addition, U.S. companies are pushing to get more access
to the government research projects that, because all the
major Japanese companies participate, help shape the future
market. In fact, Japan's Ministry of International Trade and
Industry recently declared all its major research projects
open to foreign companies.</p>
<p>"I think we've got the barriers down now," says Dr. Mintz
of Dow Chemical. "Now, whether American companies feel they
are able to benefit by participation we won't know for
years."</p>
