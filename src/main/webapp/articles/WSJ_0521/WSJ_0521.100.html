	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Stock market skeptics had their hands full
last week, clinging to their disbelief.
   The Dow Jones Industrial Average set records on three
days, though it fell back 11.80 Friday to close at 2819.91.
Moreover, some prominent individual stocks that aren't in the
industrial average, such as Compaq Computer, also surged to
new highs.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>But few strategists and professional investors think
stocks have embarked on a new bull run of any great
significance. Instead, they think the market is merely
nudging the top rail a little higher on the trading-range
fence. Instead of the industrial average being confined below
roughly 2800, now a top of about 3000 is seen as a
possibility. But the market's trading-range syndrome, they
assert, will prevail.</p>
<p>The latest upward push began two weeks ago with a 63-point
rally in the Dow that vaulted the average over 2800. The
engine driving stocks' thrust was a powerful bond market
rally that pushed down long-term interest rates to 8.6% from
more than 9%. The big moves in both markets convinced many
strategists that declining interest rates will be essential
for stocks to rise further in the weeks ahead. Investors will
push up stock prices faster than corporate profits can grow
in a slowing economy, the theory goes, if interest rates fall
as inflation eases.</p>
<p>Skeptics have an arsenal of arguments to shoot holes in
this theory. For example, David Rajala, director of equity
investments at One Federal Asset Management, contends
inflation won't necessarily ease up as the economy grows
slowly.</p>
<p>"The Wall Street consensus is that slow growth means lower
inflation," says Mr. Rajala. "But we have trouble finding a
historical precedent for that. Normally, slow growth is
associated with high rates of inflation." He thinks inflation
will stubbornly remain around 5% this year, indicating that
bond yields will drift between 8% and 9% and stocks will be
confined in a range of about 2200 to 3000 in the Dow
industrials.</p>
<p>"It is hard for us to be convinced that this {latest
rally} isn't a move to a top of a trading range in the stock
market," says Mr. Rajala. "For us to believe that rates are
going to come down significantly, we feel we have to have
{some} quarters of negative economic growth" -- though not
necessarily consecutive quarters, which could qualify as a
recession.</p>
<p>There are other forces that will keep interest rates high
and cap the stock market rally, skeptics say. Demand for
capital from Eastern Europe; less foreign investment capital
from Japan; borrowing demands by the Treasury and by
Resolution Trust Corp., the thrift bailout agency -- all
these will keep rates up, says Byron Wien, managing director
at Morgan Stanley and the company's chief U.S. investment
strategist.</p>
<p>"You aren't going to get enough support from the bond
market to get a bull move," Mr. Wien says. If the industrial
average vaults over 3000 while bond yields stay at current
levels or move higher, Mr. Wien says he will sell stocks.</p>
<p>In the meantime, he has put a little bit more money to
work, taking his cash position down to 12% last Monday from
15% previously. Mr. Wien is one of those who think corporate
profits will start improving in the second half of this year.
"The economy still has a significant amount of natural
momentum," he says.</p>
<p>Even so, Mr. Wien is focusing on growth companies. He
would still buy technology issues, such as Sun Microsystems,
Intel, and Compaq Computer, even though they have rallied
strongly. Technology carries the heaviest weight of any
sector in his portfolio. Mr. Wien says he bought these shares
earlier this year because they were cheap, and the companies
had new products that would most likely create favorable
earnings surprises.</p>
<p>Skeptics also doubt any lasting buoyancy will come out of
the budget deficit-reduction process. To be sure, curbing
federal demand for capital would help lower interest rates,
which would probably boost stocks, says Arnold Moskowitz,
director of investment strategy at County NatWest Securities
USA. But for that happy outcome, he estimates at least $50
billion must be lopped from the fiscal 1991 deficit, which he
considers a big stretch for politicians facing an election
year.</p>
<p>But, just in case, Mr. Moskowitz has projected the effects
of declining interest rates: accelerating a trend of higher
capital spending, and lowering the dollar, which would
stimulate U.S. exports. To play higher capital spending and
rising exports, Mr. Moskowitz suggests such stocks as General
Signal, Honeywell, Eaton, General Electric, W.W. Grainger,
and Sundstrand.</p>
<p>There also are skeptics among analysts who focus less on
economic fundamentals and more on market history and other
technical factors. One of these is Laszlo Birinyi, president
of Birinyi Associates, a stock research company, who thinks
the most recent runup obscures rather than illuminates what's
happening in the market.</p>
<p>Mr. Birinyi closely examined the week that included the
rally on May 11 when the industrial average soared 63.07 to
2801.58. He found broad, indiscriminate moves in all stocks.
For example, the 50 largest stocks in Standard & Poor's index
were up 3.7% that week and the 50 smallest were up 2.3%. The
50 S&P stocks with the highest projected earnings increases
for the next five years rose 3.6%, while the 50 with the
lowest five-year earnings forecast rose 3%.</p>
<p>Normally, when investors pour money into most segments of
the stock market, analysts rejoice. But Mr. Birinyi doesn't,
because that spate of across-the-board buying didn't change
the underlying trends that have prevailed all this year.</p>
<p>This year through Friday, the 50 largest stocks in the S&P
500 are up 3.9% while the 50 smallest in the index are down
4.4%. As measured by five-year earnings forecast, the first,
second and third groups of 50 stocks each are up 5.6%, 3.9%
and 6%, respectively, this year; the three bottom 50-stock
tiers are down 3.6%, 4.1% and 4.9%, respectively.</p>
<p>The rally, Mr. Birinyi concludes, is still concentrated in
relatively few growth stocks, which doesn't bode well for a
broad advance in the market, and not even for the 30 Dow
industrials.</p>
<p>While the industrial average closed Friday just a few
points below its latest record, broader indexes were far
below their all-time highs -- the S&P 500 by 1.4%, the New
York Stock Exchange composite index by 2.9%, and the Nasdaq
composite by 7.7%.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>Friday's Market Activity</p>
<p>Stocks drifted lower Friday, but finished the week with a
gain.</p>
<p>The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 11.80 to 2819.91.
Advancing issues outpaced decliners 742 to 725 on the New
York Stock Exchange, where volume totaled 162,520,000 shares.</p>
<p>For the week, the industrial average advanced 18.33
points, or 0.65%, following a 3.37% gain in the previous
week. Standard & Poor's 500-stock index gained 0.75% for the
week, while the New York Stock Exchange composite rose 0.68%.</p>
<p>Prime Motor Inns jumped 1 5/8 to 13 3/4. The stock was one
of the Big Board's most active issues. Traders suggested that
buying by traders who previously had borrowed shares and sold
them, anticipating a price decline, was responsible for the
move, according to Dow Jones Professional Investor Report.</p>
<p>Two weeks ago, Prime agreed in principle with Blackstone
Capital Partners to form a joint venture to manage and
develop Prime's Howard Johnson and Ramada franchise systems.</p>
<p>That news spurred Manor Care to announce that it was
"extremely interested in making a proposal . . . more
favorable to Prime" than the Blackstone agreement. Manor Care
said Friday that it is still interested in buying Prime Motor
Inns, Professional Investor Report said. Officials at Prime
Motor Inns weren't immediately available for comment.</p>
<p>Chiquita Brands closed 3/8 higher to 20 1/2 on volume of
more than 1.8 million shares. A 6.1 million-share secondary
offering was priced at $20.125 a share Thursday.</p>
<p>A 4,250,000-share secondary offering of Leslie Fay, also
priced Thursday, pushed the stock up among the most active
issues. The issue was priced at $12.75 a share. Leslie Fay
closed at 13 1/2, up 1/2, on volume of more than 1.1 million
shares.</p>
<p>Home Depot hit another 52-week high, adding 1 1/4 to 56
1/2. Prudential-Bache Securities repeated its "buy"
recommendation on the stock for institutional and retail
clients last week.</p>
<p>Kay Jewelers added 5/8 to 8 3/8. Certain of the company's
officers and directors, who own a total of 40% of the
company's common stock, have said that they intend to buy as
much as one million more shares. Last Wednesday, Kay Jewelers
fell 2 3/8 after three banks announced that they may stop
lending money to the company.</p>
<p>UJB Financial added 1/4 to 16 3/4. Chilmark Capital has
acquired a large stake in UJB, and will be filing, as
required, with the Securities and Exchange Commission within
the next 10 days, according to Dow Jones Professional
Investor Report.</p>
<p>The American Stock Exchange Market Value Index rose 1.38
to 356.32. Amex volume totaled 13,041,010 shares, compared
with 13,760,530 shares Thursday. There were 275 issues
advancing, 267 declining and 255 were unchanged.</p>
<p>Home Shopping Network gained 1/2 to 7 1/4. A Florida-based
newspaper reported that the company has hired First Boston to
help find a buyer for the company. Neither Home Shopping nor
First Boston officials could immediately be reached for
comment. The newspaper also reported that Home Shopping had
applied for listing on the New York Stock Exchange.</p>
