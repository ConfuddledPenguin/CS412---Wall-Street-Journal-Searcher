	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- House and Senate negotiators tentatively
agreed to an estimated $1.7 billion in cuts and transfers
from Pentagon accounts to help cover the immediate costs of
increased foreign aid and domestic appropriations in the
fiscal year ending Sept. 30.
   The reductions are part of a more than $4 billion fiscal
1990 supplemental-spending bill pending in Congress and would
yield enough short-term savings to allow lawmakers to stay
within this year's ceilings under the Gramm-Rudman
deficit-reduction law.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Final approval of the package is contingent on agreement
over a separate adjustment of appropriations within defense
accounts to meet a shortfall in Pentagon personnel and
medical funds. The chairmen of defense appropriations and
authorizing committees are to meet early this week on the
second issue. Though no details have been released, these
transfers are believed to total more than $1.4 billion.</p>
<p>The sums involved are dwarfed by the size of the total
military budget. But the exercise illustrates the vagaries of
Gramm-Rudman and how the Pentagon -- and its allies in
Congress -- can maneuver to blunt the increased demands now
for defense cuts.</p>
<p>The $1.7 billion in proposed savings, for example, satisfy
the budget law but don't truly match the long-term costs of
the new domestic and foreign-aid expenditures, which will
spill over into fiscal 1991. And by using their authority to
transfer or "reprogram" funds, the defense appropriators can
act more independently and help the Pentagon reduce the net
impact from across-the-board cuts ordered last year under
Gramm-Rudman.</p>
<p>For example, under reprogramming the committees can move
money between slow-spending and fast-spending accounts on a
dollar-for-dollar basis. This is immensely helpful in
resolving an estimated $780 million shortfall in personnel
accounts owing to last fall's Gramm-Rudman cuts. Under
Gramm-Rudman rules, it would be necessary to cut
approximately $2 billion from slower-spending defense
appropriations. By using reprogramming, however, the
committees can step outside Gramm-Rudman, resolving the
problem and reducing the disruption to the military budget
far less.</p>
<p>Among individual accounts, funding for a costly explosives
plant backed by Sen. Bennett Johnston (D., La.) was
preserved, but critics of the Louisiana project succeeded in
delaying construction indefinitely. A provision requiring the
Pentagon to enter into a construction contract by Aug. 1 was
eliminated, and though the $238 million appropriation will
remain through fiscal 1992, there is strong opposition in the
House to the project's ever going forward.</p>
<p>The Bush administration, while frustrated by the defense
cuts, would be hard-pressed to resist them, since it has a
major stake in expediting $720 million in promised economic
assistance for Panama and Nicaragua. The measure also
includes $400 million in loan guarantees to help Israel
provide housing for incoming Soviet Jews, and in a footnote
to the bargaining last week, the $2.8 million fee charged the
Jerusalem government up front has taken on a symbolic
significance for at least some House lawmakers.</p>
<p>The Senate had set the fee at $1 million; the House bill
would have allowed up to $4 million in charges. Though the
accompanying written report doesn't refer to how the fees
were set, the final number represents a $1.8 million increase
from the Senate proposal and was apparently designed by House
foreign operations subcommittee Chairman David Obey (D.,
Wis.) in response to the Israeli government's admitted role
in helping finance a private organization involved in taking
over the St. John's Hospice in the old Christian quarter of
East Jerusalem.</p>
<p>The April incident provoked protests from Christian as
well as Jewish leaders for provoking tensions with the Arab
community, and the Israel housing ministry admitted it had
covertly channeled an estimated $1.8 million to help pay for
the reported $4 million purchase price.</p>
