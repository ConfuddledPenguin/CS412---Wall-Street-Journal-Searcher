	<p class="article-leader">Anti-drunk-driving activists want beer companies to
abandon their multimillion-dollar financing of car racing and
other motor sports, saying such sponsorships send the wrong
message.
   To bolster the case, the National Coalition to Prevent
Impaired Driving, a group of more than 100 traffic-safety and
public-health organizations, is holding a press conference
today to promote a new report, "Beer and Fast Cars: How
Brewers Target Blue-Collar Youth." The study concludes that
beer companies spend about $50 million a year "in a
sophisticated campaign to strengthen associations between
beer, cars and speed in a demographic group at elevated risk
of drinking and driving."</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The coalition wants beer companies to drop their
motor-sports sponsorships voluntarily, and non-brewers to
pick up the sponsorships. If the brewers don't move, the
groups vow to campaign for a legislative ban.</p>
<p>The attack is the latest public-relations headache for an
industry that in recent years has come under increasing
criticism for allegedly targeting young people, blacks and
Hispanics. James Sanders, president of the Beer Institute, a
trade association, calls the groups' complaint "ridiculous."
He says it "reached an absurd level that defies common
sense."</p>
<p>But the report's author, David Buchanan, an assistant
professor at the University of Massachusetts school of public
health, contends that the beer industry, faced with declining
consumption by health-conscious, white-collar Americans, is
targeting blue-collar youth involved in the car culture.
"This target group is accurately perceived by the industry to
include the largest number of heavy beer drinkers," he says.</p>
<p>At the same time, Prof. Buchanan says, young males from
blue-collar backgrounds are at disproportionately higher risk
of being killed in alcohol-related crashes.</p>
<p>The report, financed by the AAA Foundation for Traffic
Safety and produced by California's Marin Institute, a
nonprofit research and advocacy group, finds that motor
sports, which include drag racing, motorcycle racing and
"monster-truck" competitions, receive more sponsorship money
from the beer industry than any other type of sport.</p>
<p>"Beer companies are saturating motor events," says Michael
Schriefer, a pro race-car driver from Manhattan Beach, Calif.
"It's giving the young the wrong impression."</p>
<p>Typically, motor-sport events are festooned with banners,
bunting and posters decorated with the name of the beer
sponsor, and feature several beer-dispensing booths. Some
events have emcees who periodically urge spectators to buy
beer. Beer companies sometimes underwrite an entire event,
and other times sponsor individual teams or drivers.</p>
<p>Randi Lynn Hubbard, one of the few female monster-truck
drivers in the U.S., says there is so much beer consumed at
some events that she worries about the fans getting home
safely.</p>
<p>The report recommends that if an outright ban on beer
sponsorships is politically unfeasible, other steps should be
taken, such as limiting the cup size for beer sales to 12
ounces and halting sales at least one hour before an event
ends.</p>
<p>In reply, Stephen Burrows, vice president for consumer
awareness at Anheuser-Busch Cos., calls the report
"pseudoscience" based on opinion, not fact.</p>
<p>"We've determined that racing is a good place to reach our
audience, which is adults over 21," Mr. Burrows says. He adds
that "to conclude that people who wear blue jeans and go to
racing events are drunk drivers is an insult to people who
enjoy racing events." Moreover, he notes that Anheuser-Busch
has spent millions on its "Know When to Say When" ad
campaign, designed to foster responsibility among the
consuming public.</p>
<p>None of that is likely to mollify critics who argue that
the industry is targeting specific segments of society that
may be more vulnerable to alcohol abuse than others.</p>
<p>Spring break, for example, remains a controversy. At
Texas's South Padre Island, a favorite gathering spot for
college students, the beer companies this year "weren't
handing out beer, but they had displays, and they sponsored
all kinds of beach games," says Bobby Heard, a spokesman for
Texans' War on Drugs, which is headquartered in Austin. "We
don't want them involved in spring break at all."</p>
<p>Pat Taylor, director of the alcohol policies project at
the Center for Science in the Public Interest, says beer
companies should be banned from sponsoring rockband tours
because of their potential appeal to young people. She's also
concerned about malt-liquor advertising targeted to blacks
and Hispanics.</p>
<p>Beer-industry officials say such concerns are misguided.
"No studies have ever related these marketing or advertising
activities to an increase or decrease in alcohol abuse," says
the Beer Institute's Mr. Sanders. Rather, executives say,
these marketing tools promote a specific product among
consumers who already have decided to drink.</p>
<p>Brewers say the criticism of the industry's marketing
techniques comes from a group of activists who have a
paternalistic attitude toward the rest of the country. "We
believe the American public is smarter than these groups give
them credit for," says Anheuser-Busch's Mr. Burrows.</p>
