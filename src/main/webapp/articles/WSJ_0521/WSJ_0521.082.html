	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- Next week's U.S.-Soviet summit meeting here
will feature a partial agreement to reduce the superpowers'
arsenals of long-range nuclear missiles and a treaty to
destroy most of their chemical weapons.
   But, after four days of tough preliminary talks in Moscow,
no summit accords are in sight on the more pressing questions
on the future of post-Communist Europe. And a U.S.-Soviet
trade pact, once expected to be signed at the summit, seems
likely to be put on hold because of Moscow's campaign against
Lithuanian independence.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>During the talks, Secretary of State James Baker and
Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev were able to agree on
treaty language covering nuclear cruise missiles -- the
highly accurate, hard-to-detect weapons that had proved a
major sticking point in crafting the Strategic Arms Reduction
Treaty. And they readied for signing a pact that would, over
time, eliminate 98% of their vast inventories of poison gas
weapons.</p>
<p>That makes it likely that Mr. Gorbachev and President Bush
will be able to declare the missile treaty substantially
complete and the summit a political successeven though all
remaining treaty issues won't be worked out for months, and
the cruise missile deal announced Saturday is loaded with
loopholes and exemptions.</p>
<p>However, Mr. Baker and his advisers reported no progress
at Moscow on much touchier superpower negotiations. These
talks, on conventional arms control and German unification,
could lead to the formal demise of the already disintegrating
armed Soviet empire in Eastern and Central Europe. The
negotiations have supplanted the long-dominant nuclear
missile talks as the highest foreign policy priorities of the
Bush administration.</p>
<p>Despite new American concessions, no movement was marked
in the separate conventional arms-control talks, where Moscow
has dug in on terms for dismantling the huge Red Army
presence in Eastern and Central Europe. And U.S. officials
reported that Mr. Gorbachev remained adamantly opposed to the
entry of a reunified Germany into the Western Alliance.</p>
<p>"We had come with ideas designed to push this process
forward, but our counterparts weren't able to respond
meaningfully at this time," an exhausted Mr. Baker said at a
Moscow news conference Saturday evening.</p>
<p>"It seems clear the Soviets are just not ready to move
much on these issues at this summit," said one senior
American negotiator who participated in the five hours of
talks with Mr. Gorbachev and dozens more with Soviet Foreign
Minister Eduard Shevardnadze, his top aides, and an array of
Soviet generals. The U.S. negotiator added: "Unlike strategic
missile talks, issues like conventional troop pullbacks and
letting Germany go Western pose big domestic political
problems in the Soviet Union. And Gorbachev has enough
trouble at home without taking these on now."</p>
<p>In addition, it was said that the Soviet president firmly
rejected independence anytime soon for Lithuania and the two
other small Baltic nations incorporated into the U.S.S.R. by
force in 1940.</p>
<p>Mr. Gorbachev and Mr. Baker met with Lithuania's prime
minister in Moscow last week. But the Kremlin leader told
both that the small country must suspend its March 11
declaration of independence -- a step it has so far refused
to take -- before he will begin a lengthy "dialogue" that
could lead to secession. Meanwhile, Moscow has kept in place
an economic blockade of Lithuania.</p>
<p>Mr. Baker made it clear that if the Lithuania standoff
continues, chances are poor that next week's summit will
feature the signing of a new U.S.-Soviet trade treaty and the
waiver of trade restrictions -- even if Moscow completes work
on an emigration law that formerly had been the sole
condition for American trade liberalization. That law is
scheduled for a vote in the Soviet Parliament May 31.</p>
<p>Only a month or so after the May 30-June 3 summit, the
Soviet leader will convene the most critical Communist Party
Congress in years, a meeting at which he aims to purge his
hard-line opponents and force the party to give up much of
its power to government agencies.</p>
<p>Mr. Baker and his advisers believe Mr. Gorbachev wants to
go into the party's congress boasting of arms control
"progress" with the U.S. and a popular reception in
post-summit visits to Minnesota and California. But they
sense he wants to avoid tackling issues that remind party
hardliners and the Soviet public of the country's recent
retreats.</p>
<p>As a result, Mr. Bush could face a tough Mr. Gorbachev
next week and find it hard to push his European political
agenda, especially German unification within the North
Atlantic Treaty Organization.</p>
<p>During his Friday meeting with Mr. Baker, the Soviet
leader showed flashes of anger and complained that some
American actions, such as opposing a greater Soviet role in a
new European development bank, were making it hard for him to
fend off opponents of reform. On Lithuania and other matters,
he repeatedly told Mr. Baker that he is under intense
pressure from hardliners in the military and elsewhere to
drop his conciliatory stand toward the West and internal
dissenters.</p>
<p>The cruise missile agreements basically grant American
demands to exempt large quantities of those weapons from the
legal limits of the START treaty. Nuclear sea-launched cruise
missiles are excluded from the treaty altogether. They are
covered only in a side document that isn't legally binding
and doesn't include verification. That document limits each
side to a maximum of 880 of the naval missiles, over 100 more
than the U.S. Navy currently plans to build.</p>
<p>On air-launched nuclear cruise missiles, the U.S. won the
right to place 20 of the weapons on certain bombers but count
them as only 10 against the treaty limits. And an advanced
new conventional U.S. cruise missile called Tacit Rainbow was
exempted from the treaty's range limits in a last-minute
compromise that saved the Moscow talks.</p>
<p>The two presidents will be able to claim political credit
for other portions of the START treaty settled earlier,
including a 50% cut in heavy Soviet land-based missiles. But
several important issues, including how to count mobile
missiles, still must be decided. Soviet negotiators will fly
to Washington this week to work on those issues.</p>
<p>Overall, the START treaty would cut total superpower
strategic missiles by about 30%, with most cuts coming from
the Soviet side. While it will be the first arms pact to
actually reduce long-range missiles, it falls short of its
original goal of an overall 50% reduction. It is expected to
be formally signed late this year, after technicalities are
completed.</p>
<p>Under the chemical weapons treaty, the U.S. and U.S.S.R.
will immediately cease poison gas production and destroy all
but 5,000 tons each of their existing stocks-a roughly 80%
cut for the U.S. and a 90% cut for Moscow. Then, after a
multination pact is completed, the superpowers will further
cut their stocks to 500 tons each over eight years,
completing a 98% reduction for the U.S., 99% for the Soviets.
The remaining stocks would be held until the most dangerous
countries holding poison gas, such as Iraq and Libya, sign
the multinational accord.</p>
<p>Other, less significant treaties are also expected to be
signed at the summit. These include pacts curbing atomic
tests, setting maritime boundaries, regulating air and sea
transport, and expanding student exchanges and cultural
centers.</p>
