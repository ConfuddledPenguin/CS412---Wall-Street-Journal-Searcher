	<div class="article-body"><p>NEW YORK -- Five years ago, the famous toy seller FAO
Schwarz seemed like a derailed toy train.</p>
<p>Sure enough, the company still offered $7,000 rocking
horses and $14,000 toy Lamborghinis. But the electronic toys
and Cabbage Patch dolls that sold big were nowhere to be
found. Long the nation's most prestigious toy seller to the
carriage trade, FAO Schwarz was becoming insignificant.</p>
<p>But new owners, who purchased the company in 1985, have
revived this fortress under siege. When many companies begin
to stumble, they find failure isn't far away. But as the FAO
Schwarz experience shows, a company that is a fortress in its
marketplace often has such institutional strength that it can
recover from trouble -- at least, if owners are willing to
make big changes.</p>
<p>The toy-store chain has revised its product mix, appealed
to a broader audience and started an aggressive merchandising
program. Toy industry analysts say sales tripled to about $60
million annually, from $20 million in 1984. The company
doesn't release sales and earnings figures. But it says the
chain -- which was losing money five years ago -- is again
profitable.</p>
<p>"Of all the names people have tried to bring back from the
dead, FAO has been the most successful," declares Carol
Farmer, a retailing-industry consultant based in Boca Raton,
Fla. "It's remarkable what experienced managers and an
entrepreneurial spirit can do to a tradition-bound company."</p>
<p>For all its recent problems, the company once seemed to
enjoy an impregnable position in its market niche. Tracing
its history to Civil War days, the company offered childhood
excitement to generations of Americans, especially if they
were rich. Visiting the company's flagship store on Fifth
Avenue here was "like dying and going to heaven," recalls New
York venture capitalist Edwin Goodman. As a child, he says he
stood mesmerized for hours in front of the elaborate Lionel
train display, watching the trains meander through the
mountains and the forests. "It was absolutely hypnotic," Mr.
Goodman says.</p>
<p>At least one out-of-town five-year-old was so excited by
his first visit to the store that he fainted, recalls F.A.O.
(Fritz) Schwarz Jr., a New York lawyer.</p>
<p>His great grandfather, Frederick August Otto Schwarz, an
immigrant from Germany, opened the first Schwarz store in
1862, in Baltimore. After running the company profitably for
over a century, the family sold it in 1963. "My father asked
if anyone wanted to run the stores, and no one did," says Mr.
Schwarz.</p>
<p>The company lost strength under a series of owners, which
included Parents Magazine Inc. and W.R. Grace & Co.</p>
<p>At one point, for instance, the company concentrated on
stocking the store with expensive European-made toys, which
alienated domestic toy makers, industry executives say. And
when the industry boomed in the early 1980s because of such
new products as the Cabbage Patch Kids, FAO Schwarz refused
to carry them because they didn't fit its high-end image.</p>
<p>By the early 1980s, the entire chain was suffering. Big
discounters such as Toys 'R' Us Inc. and mass marketers like
K mart Corp. and Wal-Mart Stores dominated toy retailing.
With a policy of stocking only expensive items, FAO Schwarz
found itself ignored by consumers.</p>
<p>Many U.S. manufacturers routinely left FAO out of their
marketing plans. "We didn't care if we sold to them or not,"
says Herbert Raiffe, president of Gund Inc., an Edison, N.J.,
toy maker.</p>
<p>Even the store concedes its decline was creating a
depressing atmosphere. Peter Harris, now FAO Schwarz's chief
executive, says: "FAO had become a frightening kind of place.
It was scaring away customers." Mr. Harris, who had managed
the chain for a previous owner, acquired it in 1985, in
partnership with Philadelphia investment banker Peter Morse
and several FAO Schwarz employees.</p>
<p>The new owners brought in new capital and new directors
familiar with upscale retailing. Late in 1987, they raised
about $7 million in capital from Prudential Venture Partners,
New York, and Boston's Charles River Ventures. They expanded
the board to include Tiffany & Co. Chairman William Chaney;
Lew Frankfort, president of Coach Leatherware, and venture
capitalist Paul Hirschbiel of Prudential.</p>
<p>But the hard part was "to find a way to redeliver to
customers' expectations," Mr. Harris says. To the partners
that meant redefining the store's entire philosophy: Keeping
the upscale image but expanding it to include new generations
of customers. "We weren't competing for the customer that
shops at Toys 'R' Us or Wal-Mart. We're looking for an
upscale buyer of gifts," says Mr. Harris.</p>
<p>The company is emphasizing convenience over price by
providing new services. These include a "two-minute shop"
that offers pre-wrapped toys for quick shopping, free
gift-wrapping and a personal shopping service both for phone
customers and in-store shoppers. Customers who can't make
regular shopping hours can arrange visits at other times.</p>
<p>The company also stocks a broader range of products,
including more toys than before in the $15 to $25 range. The
store isn't abandoning its policy of selling $225 rocking
bluebirds or $295 table soccer sets; it's merely casting a
wider net for customers, explains Mr. Harris.</p>
<p>As part of its new merchandising strategy, FAO Schwarz
once again is courting big U.S. toy makers like Hasbro Inc.
and Tyco Toys Inc.</p>
<p>There's now an open-door policy for the smaller and less
heralded toy makers: They can visit during working hours and
be guaranteed a meeting with one of the store's buyers. "We
want to act as a showcase for smaller entrepreneurial
companies," says Mr. Harris.</p>
<p>Last November, FAO Schwarz helped launch Magnetic
Dimensions, an interactive, three-dimensional toy marketed by
Sicommerce Inc., New York, with a party for 5,000 guests. It
also devoted an exclusive display area and space to play with
the product. In the first eight weeks, the store sold 5,000
units at $50 each, says Robert Lieberman, vice president of
Sicommerce. "They launched the product and they made us a
star."</p>
<p>The flagship store itself, moved to a new location in
1987, also underwent a major transformation. Shoppers,
greeted by doormen dressed as toy soldiers, walk into a space
dwarfed by a 28-foot tall, electronic animated musical clock.
The surrounding space is filled with hundreds of plush
animals, some gigantic, some dwarf-like. A cage-like glass
elevator or a child-friendly slow-moving escalator takes
shoppers to the second floor where children can lounge about
and construct their Lego sets or watch transfixed as the
trains go by.</p>
<p>"The {New York} store is fresher than it's ever been,"
says Alan Hassenfeld, chairman and chief executive of Hasbro,
the nation's largest toy company.</p>
<p>Though the new owners have trimmed the chain to 15 stores
from 22 five years ago, they have opened a new store in San
Francisco and plan additional stores in Chicago and Tokyo.
They also have revived their catalog and plan to mail it to
over five million customers this year.</p>
<p>As in the early days of the store, Mr. Hassenfeld
declares, "it's once again the place where things happen."</p>
