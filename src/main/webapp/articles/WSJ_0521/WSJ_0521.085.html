	<p class="article-leader">HERNDON, Va. -- Newbridge Networks Corp. has signed a
two-year contract valued at $35 million to provide a line of
digital networking equipment to Bell Atlantic Corp., said
Peter Madsen, president of Newbridge's U.S. unit.
   Mr. Madsen said the contract could become a cornerstone
for the Ottawa company's new push into public
telecommunications networks.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Newbridge's end-user networks are installed in a phone
company's central offices rather than customer locations. Mr.
Madsen said this approach has several advantages, including
lower costs, higher level of service, longer depreciation
cycles, and "partitioning" that permits hundreds of network
customers to share equipment.</p>
<p>"We are in discussions with most of the other Bell
operating companies," Mr. Madsen said. "Some of them are
interested in similar applications at phone company central
offices, and others for customer-premises networks."</p>
<p>In addition, the company is testing equipment and software
programs with government customers in Australia, New Zealand,
Chile and Mexico.</p>
<p>Mr. Madsen declined to make an earnings estimate for the
year ended April 30. But he indicated that revenue almost
doubled from the previous year's level of 67 million Canadian
dollars (US$57 million). In fiscal 1989, Newbridge earned
C$9.1 million. The company went public in July 1989.</p>
