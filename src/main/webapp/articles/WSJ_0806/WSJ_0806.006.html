	<p class="article-leader">Huntway Partners L.P., Valencia, Calif., slashed by 71%
its second-quarter distribution to its preference unitholders
to 10 cents a unit, from 34.5 cents a unit.
   Huntway, an owner and operator of three refineries that
produce liquid asphalt for road construction and repair, said
the distribution will be paid Aug. 29 to unitholders of
record Aug. 14.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The partnership said it expects the reduced distribution
to be paid in future quarters until cash flow improves,
reflecting an expected deterioration in operating margins
because of lower liquid asphalt prices and "rapidly rising
crude oil costs."</p>
<p>Funds available for unitholder distributions also will be
depressed by "significant bank principal payments and capital
expenditures" in coming quarters, Huntway said. "Management
believes that the reduction of Huntway's outstanding
indebtedness and the upgrading of its facilities are the
appropriate actions" for the partnership's long-term health.</p>
<p>Huntway also reported second-quarter net income of $3.4
million, or 29 cents a unit, compared with a restated net
loss in the year-earlier quarter of $475,000, or four cents a
unit. Revenue in the latest quarter rose 24% to $29.9 million
from $24.1 million.</p>
<p>However, operating results fell short of forecasted levels
due to lower-than-expected sales volume in Southern
California, Huntway said. The partnership said that it "does
not anticipate that the operating performance of the second
quarter is sustainable" for the rest of the year.</p>
<p>Huntway said it anticipates increased demand for liquid
asphalt late this year, reflecting the implementation last
week of a five-cent-a-gallon increase in the California gas
tax. The increased revenue is earmarked for state
transportation spending, including construction and
maintenance of roads and highways.</p>
