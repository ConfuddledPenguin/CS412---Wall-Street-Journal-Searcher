	<p class="article-leader">OTTAWA -- Canadian External Affairs Minister Joe Clark
said the Canadian government has reached an agreement with
the Canadian Bankers' Association to prevent Kuwaiti money
from being withdrawn from Canadian financial institutions.
   Mr. Clark said Canada doesn't have the same legal basis as
other countries, including Britian and the U.S., to freeze
foreign assets. But the move, he said, will add up to a "de
facto freezing of Kuwaiti assets in Canadian institutions,
whether those institutions are in Canada or elsewhere."</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Members of the Canadian Bankers' Association include
Canada's commercial banks and other financial institutions.</p>
<p>Mr. Clark said he couldn't estimate the size of Kuwaiti
holdings in Canadian financial institutions. He said the
measure wasn't applied to Iraqi holdings because there aren't
"significant amounts of Iraqi assets" in Canada.</p>
