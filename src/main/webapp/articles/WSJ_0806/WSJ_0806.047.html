	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- The Commerce Department said anti-dumping
duties ranging from 1.7% to 3.17% should be assessed on
imports of synthetic-fiber sweaters from South Korea.
   Before the duties can be applied, however, the U.S.
International Trade Commission must decide whether the
imports, which totaled $476.1 million last year, have injured
the domestic industry. Affirmative rulings by both agencies
are required in anti-dumping cases.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The duties would offset the advantage of imports priced
below the cost of production or below the price charged in
South Korea's home market.</p>
<p>The Commerce Department delayed until Aug. 20 its
determination on what anti-dumping duties should be imposed
on sweater imports from Taiwan. Earlier, the department found
that some Hong Kong sweater manufacturers also have violated
the U.S. Anti-Dumping Act.</p>
<p>The ITC has scheduled a hearing for Thursday on sweater
imports from all three major Asian suppliers.</p>
<p>The Commerce Department said the dumping margins on the
imports from South Korea averaged 3.17% on man-made fiber
sweaters -- including jackets, vests, cardigans and pullover
garments -- manufactured by Hanil Synthetic Fiber Industrial
Co. and smaller amounts for sweaters produced by other
companies. These included 1.2% for Chunji Industrial Co.,
1.11% for Shinwon Tongsan, 0.92% for Yurim Co., 0.73% for
Young Woo & Co. and 1.3% for all other South Korean
producers.</p>
