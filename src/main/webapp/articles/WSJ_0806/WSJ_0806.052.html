	<p class="article-leader">Current efforts to reform civil RICO, one of the nation's
most powerful anti-fraud laws, could well walk this country
into a darker chapter of the S&L disaster. Nevertheless, it
was supported by L. Gordon Crovitz ("Two Cheers for This Bill
to Reform RICO," Rule of Law, June 27). "Anything to limit
RICO would help," he argued. Not quite, particularly if the
bill would retroactively deprive victims of the S&L scandal
-- as well as other similar frauds -- of effective relief.
   In 1970, Congress enacted the Racketeer Influenced and
Corrupt Organizations Act. It prohibits patterns of
racketeering activity against various kinds of enterprises,
including savings-and-loan associations. Racketeering
activity, too, includes fraud -- specifically bank fraud. In
addition to criminal sanctions, RICO -- like the antitrust
statutes -- authorized for victims a treble-damages claim for
relief. Like antitrust laws that underwrite freedom in the
marketplace, civil RICO underwrites integrity in the
marketplace.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>And now that those who clearly bear a major blame in the
S&L crisis -- real-estate brokers who set up deals,
accountants who cooked the books and lawyers who papered
bogus transactions -- may be held accountable in civil
litigation, they have come to Congress to ask that they be
exempted, retroactively, from the treble-damages provisions
of the law. Notwithstanding a financial crisis of
unparalleled proportions, they make the argument that we need
weaker, not stronger, anti-fraud laws.</p>
<p>At their urging, the RICO Amendments Act contains a
"gatekeeper" provision designed to winnow out inappropriate
civil litigation. The idea is fundamentally sound, but a
fight is fast developing in Congress over the size of the
gate. The lawyers, accountants and other professionals want
to narrow the gate to let pass through only "major
participants," which would be defined to include only the
"trigger men" of the fraud and to exclude those who only
"helped" pull the trigger -- the lawyers, accountants and
other professionals. In extolling reform at any price, Mr.
Crovitz did not tell his readers about this brewing fight,
and cheated readers out of the information needed to make up
their own minds about this important legislation.</p>
<p>Our deepest legal traditions stand squarely against
changing the substance of legal rights retroactively.
Retroactive penal legislation violates the ex post facto
clause of the Constitution. Among the founders, Madison
argued eloquently against all retroactive legislation in the
Federalist Papers.</p>
<p>RICO may be in need of rewriting as it applies in ordinary
commercial litigation, but it is not in need of such radical
surgery that would let off the swindlers -- and their lawyers
and accountants -- in the current thrift scandal. By making
the reform retroactive, we would be bailing out the Charles
Keatings and leaving their victims holding the bag, including
Mr. Keating's 23,000 bondholders, who were cheated out of
$200 million.</p>
