	<p class="article-leader">RasterOps Corp., riding strong demand for high-end
computer graphics products, estimated that earnings in its
fourth quarter ended June 30 exceeded analysts' forecasts
about 7%.
   Keith Sorenson, chief executive officer, said RasterOps
should post net income of 16 cents a share, or $809,600, on
revenue of $13 million. RasterOps, based in Santa Clara,
Calif., makes computer-peripherals, including high-end color
monitors and graphics devices for desktop computers.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Most analysts are expecting RasterOps to report net of 15
cents a share on revenue of $12 million. RasterOps is
expected to release its financial results today.</p>
<p>In the year-ago period, the company earned $301,000, or
three cents a share, on $7.2 million in revenue.</p>
<p>This is the first time RasterOps has disclosed quarterly
results since its initial public stock offering in May. The
stock was offered at $12 and closed Friday at $16.75 in
over-the-counter trading.</p>
<p>Founded three years ago, RasterOps has ridden burgeoning
demand for computers used in publishing and graphic arts. In
recent years, Apple Computer Inc. has been the major supplier
to the arts and publishing world because its Macintosh
computers are designed to process and display graphics. Apple
offers large-screen monitors and extra circuit boards that
improve its standard machines, but it did so only after
RasterOps and several other companies carved out the market.</p>
<p>About 85% of RasterOps's sales come from Macintosh-related
products, but the company is moving quickly to piggyback its
business onto that of International Business Machines Corp.,
the largest supplier of personal computers, and Sun
Microsystems Inc., the biggest supplier of workstations.</p>
<p>This week, RasterOps expects to begin shipping its first
products for IBM's PS/2 line of personal computers. The
company already sells products for Sun's Sparcstation models,
desktop machines popular with engineers and scientists.</p>
<p>RasterOps also intends to build peripheral devices for
Digital Equipment Corp.'s computers. Today, the company will
announce plans to develop devices for Digital's machines that
provide improved color and live video feeds or television in
a window on the monitor's screen.</p>
