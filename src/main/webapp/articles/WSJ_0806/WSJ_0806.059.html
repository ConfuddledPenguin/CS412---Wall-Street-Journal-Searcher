	<p class="article-leader">LOS ANGELES -- Times Mirror Co.'s agreement to purchase
50% of Los Angeles-based La Opinion, the nation's largest
Spanish-language daily newspaper, is a strategy to tap the
fast-growing Hispanic market, one of the few growth areas
open to newspapers.
   "It makes a lot of sense for Times Mirror to buy a stake
in this market," said Paul Marsh, an analyst for Bateman
Eichler Hill Richards Inc., a Los Angeles brokerage firm.
"It's one of the few newspaper revenue expansions left -- a
way to tap the Hispanic advertising dollar."</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Times Mirror's agreement is "a way of getting into the
Hispanic marketplace with a great deal of speed," said Kevin
R. Gruneich, analyst for First Boston Corp. "They could have
started up their own Spanish-language daily but that could
have bruised their audience's feelings and taken longer. They
could have looked like outsiders coming in to steal the
Hispanic market. This way, they are going through the
backdoor and ringing the doorbell on the way."</p>
<p>Times Mirror, publisher of the Los Angeles Times and other
newspapers, didn't disclose what it paid for the stake. Jose
I. Lozano, president of La Opinion, said that the Times
Mirror investment won't change the newspaper's editorial
content, management or Spanish-language format. The two
companies negotiated for about two years before reaching the
agreement, he said.</p>
<p>Times Mirror and La Opinion will form a new California
limited partnership, and La Opinion's current five board
members will be joined by four Times Mirror nominees on the
board.</p>
<p>"The infusion of capital will allow us to develop a number
of different plans, including expanding home delivery, market
research and infrastructure," Mr. Lozano said. The
newspaper's goal is to increase its daily circulation to
175,000 by 1995 from its current circulation of 101,300,
nearly all of which is newsstand sales.</p>
<p>Mr. Lozano said he is considering other steps, such as
opening news bureaus outside the Los Angeles area, including
Latin America. He also hopes to improve the newspaper's news
analysis and expand its news staff beyond its current 60
members, he said.</p>
<p>La Opinion is owned by the Lozano family, with Ignacio
Lozano Jr. serving as its chairman and editor-in-chief. With
the recent influx of immigrants from Central America and
Latin America into the Los Angeles area, La Opinion has been
attempting to broaden its audience by expanding its coverage
of those countries' communities.</p>
<p>About four million Hispanics live in the five-county Los
Angeles region, and about 800,000 households identify
themselves as Spanish-language dominant, Mr. Lozano said.
Unlike many English-language dailies, which have suffered
declines in readership in recent years, several
Spanish-language publications have expanded their readership
in areas such as Los Angeles, Miami and New York. According
to Times projections, Southern California's Hispanic
population will swell from about 29% of the region's
population to 40% by 2010.</p>
<p>The Miami Herald, a Knight-Ridder Inc. newspaper, was
among the first to approach the Spanish-language market with
a supplement in 1976. That supplement, now known as El Nuevo
Herald, has been expanded and refined into a daily section
that has helped the Miami Herald expand circulation and raise
its profile in the regional Hispanic community.</p>
<p>Hispanics in the U.S. tend to be younger than the
population as a whole, and expanding Spanish-language
publications may encourage future readership in either
language. "Studies show the key predictor of newspaper
readership is the presence of a newspaper in the home," said
Felix Gutierrez, vice president of the Gannett Foundation and
an authority on Spanish-language media. "If these people are
reading newspapers in Spanish, their kids and grandkids will
become acquainted with it."</p>
<p>Robert F. Erburu, chairman and chief executive officer of
Times Mirror, said the company will continue to publish its
bilingual supplement, Nuestro Tiempo, which is distributed 15
times a year in heavily Hispanic communities. If approved by
antitrust regulators, the transaction is expected to close in
September, Mr. Lozano said.</p>
