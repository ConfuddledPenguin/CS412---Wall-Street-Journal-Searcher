	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- Iraqi strongman Saddam Hussein has left
President Bush with a very unattractive set of options. The
economic sanctions the president is attempting to impose may
inflict as much pain on the U.S. as they do on Iraq, yet
there was growing concern last night that the president may
have to resort to even more drastic military measures to keep
Iraq's hands off Saudi Arabia.
   Mr. Bush is having surprising early success on the
economic front, getting both Western Europe and Japan to sign
on to the U.S.-led global embargo of oil exports from Iraq
and the Kuwaiti oil fields Iraq seized last week.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The administration is now considering a move to gain
United Nations support for a plan to blockade Iraqi oil
shipments through the Persian Gulf or either of two major
pipelines carrying oil out through Saudi Arabia and Turkey.
The blockade, which would be carried out in international
waters, would be accomplished by an international fleet,
including U.S. warships.</p>
<p>But the more the embargo succeeds, the more painful it
will be for American consumers. In all likelihood, there
isn't enough extra oil capacity in other countries to make up
for the more than 4 million barrels a day of oil that a
boycott and such a blockade would bottle up in Iraq and
Kuwait.</p>
<p>Under such a scenario, world oil prices could skyrocket,
at least temporarily, perhaps to as high as $35 a barrel, 40%
higher than they are today, an increase of about 25 cents a
gallon at American gas pumps.</p>
<p>The resulting disruptions could, in the short run, wreak
havoc on industrial economies world-wide.</p>
<p>The president yesterday used his toughest language yet
condemning the Iraqi move against Kuwait. Mr. Bush declared
that "these are outlaws -- international outlaws and
renegades," and he flatly pledged to roll back the Iraqi
invasion: "This will not stand. This will not stand, this
aggression against Kuwait."</p>
<p>And though Iraq claimed yesterday that it had begun
pulling troops out of Kuwait, Mr. Bush charged that Baghdad
"lied" and that its forces remained. He declared that Arab
leaders had "failed" to find their own solution within 48
hours of the invasion, as promised.</p>
<p>The president again refused to rule out the use of
military force against Iraq, and it seems clear that the U.S.
would move militarily if Saudi Arabia were attacked. U.S.
intelligence officials yesterday told the White House of
signs Iraq is actually preparing to seize the so-called
neutral zone on the Saudi-Kuwaiti border or to invade Saudi
Arabia itself, according to officials familiar with the
intelligence reports.</p>
<p>In one sign that the U.S. is preparing to react to such an
event, Defense Secretary Richard Cheney was dispatched for
talks to Saudi Arabia, which still doesn't want to allow
American forces on its soil as a precaution.</p>
<p>In the event of Iraqi aggression against Saudi Arabia, the
U.S. would have to hope that the quick dispatch of jet
fighters and big B-52 bombers from distant domestic and
foreign bases and the rapid deployment of a small contingent
of light ground forces would be enough to offset Iraqi
troops, who would be far closer to Saudi oil fields and more
heavily armed.</p>
<p>One option under study in the Pentagon, according to
defense officials who asked not to be identified, is the
possibility of bombing secret Iraqi facilities where Mr.
Hussein has scientists and foreign mercenaries working on
nuclear and biological weapons research. Iraq also has
underground storage sites for chemical weapons that are
vulnerable to U.S. bombs, some of which have the capacity to
penetrate deeply into the earth. Mr. Hussein "has a great
deal to lose here," says one expert.</p>
<p>Yet the complications facing any American military move
are sobering. In addition to the U.S.'s inability to position
forces ahead of time in the region, the puppet government
Iraq has installed appeared to raise a new obstacle yesterday
by hinting that it is prepared to take reprisals against
foreigners trapped in Kuwait, including an estimated 3,800
Americans.</p>
<p>There is disagreement among U.S. officials and Arab
diplomats about the chances of Mr. Hussein actually ordering
his troops to drive on into Saudi Arabia. Some diplomats
reported that Iraq has moved into at least part of the
neutral zone.</p>
<p>The intelligence assessment was based on satellite photos
and human intelligence reports showing the configuration of
Iraqi troops, movements between Iraq and Kuwait and the types
of arms and logistical supplies soldiers near the
Kuwaiti-Saudi border are receiving. Publicly, the White House
said Iraqi forces are five to 10 miles from the border.</p>
<p>But some American officials discount the new warnings of a
possible Iraqi move against the desert kingdom and its
enormous oil reserves. Middle Eastern diplomatic sources say
the Saudis themselves doubt that Iraq is preparing to move
and don't see the evidence in either satellite photos --
which the U.S. has begun providing to them in the last few
days -- or movements on the ground.</p>
<p>Although the movement toward meaningful sanctions picked
up momentum over the weekend, there remains doubt that the
international community has the will to make such measures
severe or long-lasting enough to be truly painful to Iraq.</p>
<p>The European Community agreed to impose broad sanctions,
including embargos on oil purchases from Iraq and Kuwait and
on arms sales to Iraq. And, crucial to hopes for a meaningful
trade embargo, Japan announced yesterday that it also will
embargo oil imports from Iraq and Kuwait.</p>
<p>But Japan seemed to want further international political
cover, suggesting its move depends on the United Nations
Security Council passing a resolution calling for broad
sanctions. American diplomats were busy trying to draft such
a resolution for quick passage. And there were hints that
China, though it has joined the international move to cut off
arms shipments to Iraq, may balk at endorsing broad trade
sanctions. As a Security Council member, China could block a
resolution it didn't approve of.</p>
<p>Even if a boycott is successfully assembled, bottling up
all crude exports from Iraq and Kuwait would drain more than
4 million barrels from the world's daily flow of oil. Other
oil exporters have 4.5 million to 5.5 million barrels a day
in currently spare surge capacity, estimates Daniel Yergin,
president of Cambridge Energy Associates, a
Massachusetts-based research and consulting firm. But perhaps
2 million barrels of that is in Saudi Arabia and another
800,000 barrels in the United Arab Emirates, both sources
that might be reluctant to pump full out while looking down
the barrels of Saddam Hussein's guns, Mr. Yergin notes.</p>
<p>As a result, the world could quickly find itself short
more than a million barrels a day in total crude supplies, a
situation almost certain to set off a price-boosting
scramble. In time, the higher prices would call forth
increased supplies and would help induce conservation. And in
the interim the U.S. and other countries could let some oil
out of their strategic stockpiles to ease the shortage. For a
time, however, the turmoil would likely be intense.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, there's no way of telling precisely how quickly
a full-scale embargo would pinch Iraq. But over time, the
sting would become painful, particularly because the country
already is in sad economic shape.</p>
<p>On the military front, two U.S. naval task forces are
converging on the Persian Gulf area. One, including the U.S.
carrier Eisenhower, is expected to take a position in the
eastern Mediterranean. A second, led by the carrier
Independence, is moving from the Indian Ocean toward a
position near the Strait of Hormuz, at the mouth of the
Persian Gulf.</p>
<p>A third U.S. naval task force, which will include the
cruise-missile-carrying Wisconsin and the carrier Saratoga,
is scheduled to leave Norfolk tomorrow for the Mediterranean.
A Defense Department spokesman asserted, though, that the
move was planned as part of the normal rotation to replace
the Eisenhower task force.</p>
<p>While attack aircraft from the carriers could reach
targets in Kuwait and Iraq with in-flight refueling, military
experts believe that the Saudis would let them operate from
Saudi airfields if the desert kingdom were attacked.
Airfields at King Khalid Military City, near the Saudi border
with Kuwait, have been equipped with spare parts and fuel for
such a contingency.</p>
<p>Such landing privileges would be seen by Iraq as a serious
provocation, and so far the Saudis have been reluctant to
give them, raising concerns in Washington. Sen. David L.
Boren (D., Okla.), chairman of the Senate Intelligence
Committee, said yesterday on ABC-TV's "This Week with David
Brinkley" that the Persian Gulf countries at risk "have to
give us forward basing rights, to put the air power and other
kinds of military forces physically into the region."</p>
<p>The U.S. could fly in heavier aircraft, such as tankers,
transports and bombers, to a staging point in Oman. The
Pentagon has spent over $300 million preparing an airfield
there, however the Omani government must approve U.S. use
during a crisis.</p>
<p>Mr. Hussein's tank columns, which have operated with
little air cover up to now, according to U.S. analysts, would
be extremely vulnerable to U.S. precision-guided weapons. If
the Iraqi dictator was tempted to use his missiles against
Saudi oil installations, the U.S. could retaliate with
heavier strikes against Iraqi targets, using FB-111's based
in the United Kingdom or B-52's from the U.S.</p>
<p>Squadrons of U.S. fighters based in Europe also could be
ferried quickly into the Persian Gulf region, once permission
is given to use the Saudi bases. Some planners think the
combined U.S. and Saudi air forces could defeat Iraq's
Soviet-equipped air forces within a day or two, barring
political constraints that would force the U.S. to operate
from distant bases.</p>
<p>The U.S. would probably move quickly into Saudi Arabia
some additional tactical radar equipment and operators, to
coordinate with American-made Airborne Warning and Control
System planes to monitor skies over Saudi Arabia and direct
Saudi and American fighter planes.</p>
<p>Far more difficult than air or sea support, military
planners say, would be to quickly get any significant
American ground force into Saudi Arabia to defend against
Iraq's heavily armored ground troops. Former Defense
Secretary Harold Brown says that a contingent of Marines or
troops from the 82nd or 101st Airborne Divisions could be
flown in, perhaps in as little as one day, because they
travel lightly.</p>
<p>"The trouble is that because they're light they wouldn't
do well against heavy forces," says Mr. Brown. And, he notes,
Iraq's Mr. Hussein "isn't Gen. Noriega," and his troops
wouldn't be as easy to repel as the Panamanian leader's
forces were. Though American and Saudi air forces have worked
closely together to plan and practice moves that would have
to be taken in a crisis, the U.S. doesn't have any experience
in moving significant ground forces to the kingdom.</p>
<p>Military planners say the Saudis are confident, though,
that they have the ability-using fighter aircraft, helicopter
gunships and ground forces of their own -- to cut the two
main roads that lead from Kuwait down the Saudi coast to the
kingdom's giant Persian Gulf oil fields. If those roads were
cut, the tanks would be forced onto the desert to travel,
slowing them down and making them far easier targets for air
attack by the Saudi's American-made F5 and British-made
Tornado aircraft.</p>
<p>One of the Iraqis' most inviting early targets would be an
industrial city the Saudis have built up through investment
of billions of dollars at Jubail, on the Persian Gulf coast.
But invading forces would have to move much further down the
gulf coast to reach the biggest Saudi oil fields and refining
facilities near Dhahran.</p>
