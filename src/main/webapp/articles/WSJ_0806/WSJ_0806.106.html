	<p class="article-leader">Cerus S.A. said that it has agreed to sell a 1% interest
in Societe Generale de Belgique to Deutsche Bank AG in the
first step toward unwinding its 15% stake in the Belgian
industrial holding company.
   A spokeswoman for Cerus, the French holding company of
Italian financier Carlo de Benedetti, declined to provide the
price for the sale, but 1% of Generale de Belgique can be
valued at about 2.09 billion Belgian francs ($63.9 million)
on the basis of 3,270 Belgian francs a share.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>As reported, Cerus built up its 15% interest during a
foiled takeover bid for Generale de Belgique in 1988, but has
repeatedly indicated that it wants to sell the stake when
prices become favorable.</p>
