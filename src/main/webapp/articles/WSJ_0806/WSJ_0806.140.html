	<p class="article-leader">OTTAWA -- Canada's composite leading indicator in May fell
0.4% from April, suggesting "the onset of a recession,"
Statistics Canada, a federal agency, said, citing weaker
household demand. May marked the fourth consecutive month
that the index declined.
   The agency also said Canada's gross domestic product, the
total value of the nation's output of goods and services,
declined 0.2% in May and 0.1% in April.</p>
