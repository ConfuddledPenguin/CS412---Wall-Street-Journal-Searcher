	<p class="article-leader">Regarding your June 27 editorial "The Court's Angels": the
U.S. Constitution can hardly be ". . . transformed into Holy
Writ. . . ." It always has been Holy Writ. The English
refugees who first settled these shores came here in large
part because the medieval mind-set of Tudor England was being
replaced by James I's modernizing ideas, and those who
couldn't adapt emigrated.
   The essence of medieval polity was that all authority was
ultimately vested in "natural law," i.e. God's law, which was
interpreted for the people's use by the church. While the
drafters of our Constitution were far removed from medieval
times ecclesiastically, their political instincts were still
rooted in Tudor England, not Stuart, Orange or Hanoverian.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Compare Britain and the U.S. in terms of the locus of
"sovereignty." In the former, the law is whatever the House
of Commons says it is, and that House is by and large a fair
reflection of the "vox populi". "The people" are, through the
representational mechanism of the House of Commons, indeed
sovereign.</p>
<p>In the U.S., by contrast, sovereignty is vested in a piece
of paper, the meaning of which, while reasonably clear when
written, is now available to the people only through the
interpretation of the Supreme Court. Our elected
representatives, both executive and legislative, are helpless
in the face of contrary "interpretations" by a majority of
our nine high priests.</p>
<p>You and I may understand, for example, that so long as the
U.S. does not have an "official" church, the Constitution's
prohibition of the "establishment" of religion is being
complied with, and no further action or decision is
necessary. However, the simple words in the Constitution no
longer mean what they say; they mean whatever our unelected
lifetime-appointed neoclergy decides they mean.</p>
<p>Therefore, unless there is a fundamental restructuring of
the American system of government, the Constitution will
remain, rather than be transformed into, "Holy Writ." I leave
it to you and your readers to figure out what can be done
about it.</p>
