	<p class="article-leader">WISBOROUGH GREEN, England -- It's a balmy Saturday, the
grass needs cutting, and -- like suburbanites everywhere --
Dan Steward is having trouble starting his lawn mower. Again
and again, he yanks on the rope. Finally, the riding
machine's engine sputters to life. Mr. Steward leaps aboard,
adjusts his crash helmet, checks his headlights and roars
off, waving to the cheering crowd.
   Crash helmet? Headlights? Cheering crowd?</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Welcome to the annual 12-Hour Endurance Classic of the
British Lawn Mower Racing Association.</p>
<p>If hell has a suburb, it looks like this. Thick billows of
smoke and dust roll across a 20-acre pasture as nearly 60
lawn mowers, souped-up and de-mufflered, scream around at
speeds approaching 50 miles an hour. Drivers take corners on
two wheels, sometimes leaving the ground altogether as they
bounce over ruts and potholes.</p>
<p>The din is brain-rattling, more like chain saws than lawn
mowers, with backfires that sound like cannon. From 9 p.m.
Saturday to 9 a.m. Sunday, the mowers race through gloom and
early morning mist, with only brief pit stops for fuel and
repairs. Most diabolical of all, not a blade of grass gets
cut: The mower blades have been removed for safety reasons.</p>
<p>Recognized by Britain's Royal Automobile Club as the
governing body for lawnmower racing, the BLMRA has been
staging such events for some 18 years. Nearly every summer
weekend finds the 200-member group zooming around some
farmer's field in England or Wales. Ordinarily the weekend
meets consist of 10-minute speed sprints along a "track"
marked with bales of straw. High point of the season is the
grueling 12-hour event, raced relay-style by teams of three
drivers.</p>
<p>This, a BBC commentator observed during the one and only
telecast of a race, "is a classic British sport: played by
fanatics, under absurd rules, generally in the rain."</p>
<p>If not absurd, the rules are certainly elaborate. Three
pages of fine-print dictate everything from the height of
front-mounted grass catchers to the shape of the seat. Most
importantly, the mowers must have been manufactured and sold
to mow home lawns (". . . not golf courses, public parks or
the rolling prairies of the American Midwest," the
regulations caution) and the engines must be identical to
those originally sold with the machine. Among the few
modifications allowed are changes in the driving gears or
pulleys to send more power to the wheels. In addition to
wearing crash helmets, contestants must attach ignition
cut-off switches to their bodies so that if they are thrown
off, the mower stops.</p>
<p>Lawn-mower races have the festive air of a county fair.
Tents and caravans line the track, families lounge in beach
chairs and tend barbecues while children and dogs run about.
At the 12-hour race, elaborate, flood-lighted pits line the
track, each with stocks of spare parts and even arc-welders
for repairs. That race draws hundreds of paying spectators.
The proceeds go to charity, and commercial sponsorship of
individual mowers is prohibited.</p>
<p>Off the track, mower racers are a friendly, easy-going
bunch, as befits an organization that had its start in a West
Sussex pub. Jim Gavin, general secretary of the BLMRA,
recalls that over numerous beers in 1972, he and several
other motorsports fans were trying to come up with something
different to race.</p>
<p>"All we could think of was combine harvesters, but there
were only three or four in the county," says Mr. Gavin, 52, a
travel consultant. "Then we realized that, after all, this is
England -- everybody has a lawn and something to cut it
with." Thus was born "the noble sport," as adherents call it.
And it soon acquired a proper Latin motto: "Per Herbam ad
Astra" -- "Through the Grass to the Stars."</p>
<p>The motivation? "It's the cheap man's motor sport, an easy
way to get into something very competitive," says Howard
Annett, a 40-year-old engineering-firm executive, as he
tinkers with his Atco mower. "I'd always been interested in
motor racing but never had the money or the courage to do
it." Though most of the racers are male, at least four women
drive their own mowers and others take part in teams.</p>
<p>The lure of the lawn occasionally draws big names, like
former Formula One champion Stirling Moss and sports-car
racer Derek Bell, five-time winner of the Le Mans 24-hour
endurance race. Teammates Moss and Bell have won the BLMRA's
12-hour race twice.</p>
<p>"It's a great feeling on a fast lawn with the wind at your
backs," Mr. Moss says, fondly recalling his team's first win
a few years ago. Mr. Bell has some painful memories.
"Absolute agony is what it is, bouncing around some great
bumpy field in clouds of dust]" he says. "It's like being
beaten about by a prizefighter for 12 hours."</p>
<p>It is indeed rough going. Many of the racers wear
eight-inch-wide body-builder's belts to keep their innards in
place. Minor injuries abound. This year's 12-hour racers
suffered several sprained ankles, a dislocated shoulder and
numerous bruises and burns. Even the scorer, with a laptop
computer, was injured. He had dashed onto the track to pull a
driver from under an overturned mower and had grabbed a hot
exhaust pipe. He was rushed to a hospital with burns on both
hands.</p>
<p>Mower racing shows signs of spreading to the Continent.
Last fall, at the invitation of the mayor of Limoges, France,
30 BLMRA drivers hauled their machines across the Channel to
race a newly formed group of French mower enthusiasts. What
they encountered was a shock, a classic confrontation of the
precise English with the free-form French.</p>
<p>Among the machines trotted out by the French: a racer
powered by a motorcycle engine, another invention constructed
from parts of a Land Rover, and a "mower" built from the
bodies of two Citroen 2CVs with a grass catcher bolted to the
front. One other French machine had a beach umbrella welded
to the back, along with a vase filled with flowers.</p>
<p>"Our first reaction was, `Hold on, chaps, these things
aren't built to our rules and regulations,'" recalls English
racer Mr. Annett. More worrisome, the English thought the
monster French machines might topple over on them during the
race. "We were terrified they would flatten us," says the
BLMRA's Mr. Gavin.</p>
<p>Anglo-French diplomacy produced a compromise: The larger
French machines would race separately in a newly created
class called "super prototypes." The "entente cordial"
resumed, and a good time was had by all.</p>
<p>"The French are all daft as brushes," says Pete Hammerton,
another English racer. "But they were great to us, and the
food was terrific." The second annual international race is
set for Limoges, Sept. 29-30.</p>
<p>In the most recent 12-hour race here, the first-place team
racked up 277 miles, more or less without mishap. The Ant
Hill Mob team, headed by Dan Steward, the racer who had
trouble starting his engine, finished fifth in its class. At
the end, however, the engine died again -- after 213 miles --
and the mower had to be pushed across the line.</p>
<p>The big news of the day was a new world's record set by
the Flying Doctors team of Group 1. This special class, which
races only once a year in a track adjacent to the riding
mowers', is for self-propelled "walk-behind" machines, though
"run-behind" would be more apt. A British sportswriter
described a Group 1 racer as "a demon nanny being towed by a
runaway, supercharged pram."</p>
<p>The 15 members of the Flying Doctors team, aged 12 to 45,
managed 105.1 miles during 12 hours, including pit stops for
rewelding of chassis and handlebars. This supplant's the
team's previous record, listed in the Guinness Book of
Records, of 101.1 miles, set in 1984.</p>
