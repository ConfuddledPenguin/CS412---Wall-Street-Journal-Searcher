	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- The Senate passed a bill that would broadly
expand the Securities and Exchange Commission's ability to
gather Wall Street information and for the first time allow
the agency to close the stock market in times of extreme
stress.
   The bill, passed by voice vote shortly before the Senate
recessed for the summer, marks the Senate's first broad-based
reaction to the sharp stock-market drops of October 1987 and
October 1989 and to the collapse of Drexel Burnham Lambert
Inc.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>But the Senate bill lacks a measure contained in the House
version allowing the SEC to ban some forms of program
trading, a provision opposed by the Bush administration.
House-Senate conference discussions are likely to focus on
how to recast the program-trading provision into something
the Senate and administration can support. The House bill
grants the SEC the power "to constrain during volatile
markets legitimate trading strategies which nonetheless
result in extraordinary volatility."</p>
<p>Moreover, both the House and Senate versions of the bill
exclude a Bush administration-sponsored proposal to grant the
SEC regulatory oversight of stock-index futures, which allow
investors to buy the equivalent of a basket of stocks but are
traded on a commodity exchange. Those futures currently are
regulated by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission.</p>
<p>The Senate legislation would allow the SEC to gather
information on holding-company parents of Wall Street
brokerage firms. Those parents often hold many of the risky,
short-term loans taken on by firms as interim financing for
takeovers.</p>
<p>But the SEC had expressed concern that it didn't have
jurisdiction over the parent -- only the brokerage unit --
and couldn't properly assess the risk to both entities. When
Drexel was forced to file for bankruptcy earlier this year,
the SEC noted, it moved huge sums to its financially strapped
holding company from the brokerage unit, eventually forcing
the subsidiary to fall under SEC capital rules. The SEC
argued that it was hampered in monitoring the situation by
the fact that it couldn't tell how badly the parent was
doing.</p>
<p>The bill gives the SEC other major data-gathering
abilities as well. It allows the agency to set up
record-keeping procedures for large securities transactions,
a measure designed to help the agency monitor troublesome
trades.</p>
<p>"It was clear from the events of last October, just as it
had been in October 1987, that the regulators did not have
sufficient information to fully assess the risks to the
system," said Sen. Christopher Dodd (D., Conn.), a sponsor of
the bill. The measure also will help the agency "detect
manipulative or other illegal trading activity."</p>
<p>The bill also would aim to strengthen the clearance and
settlement system for stocks, options and futures, reducing
the threats of systemic risk to financial markets.</p>
<p>Both the House and Senate versions also would grant the
SEC the power to close the stock market in times of severe
market stress. Currently, only the president can halt trading
on the overall market.</p>
<p>The provision was weakened in negotiations over the past
year after SEC Chairman Richard Breeden expressed concern
that investor uncertainty over whether the SEC would take
such a step would have a chilling effect on the market. So
the measure now would permit the SEC to close the market if
the president doesn't oppose the move.</p>
