	<p class="article-leader">When Saddam Hussein seized Kuwait Thursday morning, the
world quickly turned to the U.S. for leadership in dealing
with the crisis. The measure of trust reflected in that makes
it all the more poignant that the U.S. has such limited means
for restoring the status quo ante in Kuwait and punishing the
Iraqi tyrant for his outrageous act.
   To be sure, it was something of a feat for the U.S. to so
quickly organize a wide-ranging trade boycott and freeze of
Iraq's foreign assets, plus suspensions of arms shipments to
that country. But asset freezes and trade boycotts are a
dubious way of dealing with tyrants. The one results in
incredible legal tangles that hurt both sides. The other is
hard to enforce when it involves oil, a much sought-after
commodity that cannot easily be traced to its origins. There
are many holes to plug.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>If the boycott fails, nothing happens. If it has
significant success, it might cost the West far more in
higher oil prices than it would cost Saddam Hussein in lost
revenues. His refusal to pay foreign debts would add to the
cost. It's the old cutting-off-your-nose-to-spite-your-face
problem.</p>
<p>President Bush is threatening military action if Hussein
presses his campaign into Saudi Arabia, but the Iraqi
freebooter probably has judged his ground carefully. The West
has little prospect for deploying enough forces to overwhelm
a 1 million-man Iraqi army. Punishing Iraq with air power
probably involves risking a U.S. aircraft carrier in the
Persian Gulf against a sizable Iraqi air force equipped with
Exocet missiles. Winning permission from the Saudis or the
Arab emirates to base strike aircraft on their soil faces
their usual ambivalence over whether the U.S. is a reliable
protector. A blockade would require Persian Gulf military
action and the interruption of oil flows through pipelines
passing through Turkey and Saudi Arabia.</p>
<p>Saddam also can be expected to display further cleverness.
He now may pull some troops out of Kuwait and claim that he
has met world-wide demands. He learned from the Soviets in
Afghanistan and from the Vietnamese in Cambodia that
withdrawing troops is not the same as surrendering control.
He has installed his own puppet government in Kuwait and will
run it from Baghdad.</p>
<p>What friends does the West have in the area? Turkey and
Israel, of course. But they too have recent cause for
reservations about the reliability of their western allies.
After the Iraqi move last week, the initial Israeli statement
was that it would retaliate if attacked. That hardly needed
saying other than to possibly convey the meaning that Israel
intends to sit this one out if it isn't attacked. The
Israelis also couldn't resist saying, "we told you so," to
all those critics in the West who lately have been carping at
their "intransigence" toward the Arabs. They wondered whether
Iraq, by attacking another Arab country, now has demonstrated
to everyone's satisfaction that it, not Israel, is the
greatest threat to Mideast peace.</p>
<p>The Turks, for their part, are the stepchildren of NATO,
welcome to help defend the West if they can find the weapons,
but too "different" to merit membership in the best clubs,
such as the European Community. If they are asked to help
pull the West's chestnuts out of the fire through such
hostile acts as shutting down Iraq's pipeline across Turkey
or basing a NATO attack force on Turkish soil, they could
justifiably demand better future treatment.</p>
<p>Democrats in Congress and press critics are flogging the
Bush administration for its failure to foresee the Iraqi
strike. This time, some flogging is deserved. Having been
embarrassed by a tyrant it had assiduously courted with trade
subsidies, the administration attempted an alibi, saying that
Saddam's move was unexpected. In fact, few knockout punches
have been better telegraphed. London's Economist, among
others, had called the invasion a near-certainty a week
before it happened. Columnist William Safire had been
screaming at the top of his lungs about the attempt to cozy
up to a man with such a long and bloody record of treachery.</p>
<p>There is plenty of blame to go around, however. If
Congress was more prescient than the administration it wasn't
evident while it was whacking away at the defense budget just
before Saddam made his move. Indeed, it was whacking the very
things, such as the B-2 Stealth bomber, the C-17 airlifter
and a forward air base at Crotone, Italy, that would be most
useful in dealing with a war in the Middle East.</p>
<p>Such confusion is hardly new. U.S. policy in the Middle
East has been schizoid for years. In part, this is because
there is no area of the world where U.S. foreign policy has
been subject to a greater number of competing domestic
political pressures. U.S. politicians have so often given
Turkey the back of their hands, for example, because of
lobbying from powerful anti-Turkish Greek and Armenian
lobbies in the U.S.</p>
<p>While the U.S. has had a longstanding special relationship
with Israel and has invested large sums in Israel's security,
U.S. politics have mirrored the dove-hawk debate in Israel
itself. The fiasco that ultimately resulted from Israel's
1982 invasion and then withdrawal from Lebanon, leaving that
country a permanent abattoir presided over by Syria, was a
direct result of policy divisions in the U.S. and Israel.</p>
<p>Before that came the Carter administration's abandonment
of the Shah of Iran, another U.S. friend in the region, after
a revolutionary campaign against the shah had stirred loud
sympathetic echoes from the American left. President Carter,
of course, paid for that mistake with the hostage crisis. The
Reagan administration's effort -- by means of Israel and
unorthodox methods -- to reopen contact with Iran exploded
into the Iran-Contra affair, one of the most vicious fights
in the history of American politics.</p>
<p>Through it all, State Department operatives have persisted
in trying to build relationships with the Arab world. The
most notable success of such efforts was the Camp David
Egyptian-Israeli peace treaty. But the failures have been
equally prominent. Yasser Arafat has continued to foment
terrorism despite U.S. efforts to convert him into a
statesman. King Hussein of Jordan and Hosni Mubarak of Egypt,
two other putative U.S. friends, set up a cooperation council
with Saddam not long before he pulled last week's power play.
That complicates efforts to organize a moderate Arab front
against Iraq.</p>
<p>It can be argued that U.S. failures in the Mideast are
mainly a product of the complexities of the problem and the
fact that the Soviets have been competitors for influence in
the region. There is truth in that, but one still wonders how
Saddam's move could have been "unexpected" and how much it
will cost to remedy the oversight.</p>
