	<p class="article-leader">BOSTON -- In Massachusetts, where everybody talks about
the weather, restaurant owners want to do something about it
-- the talk that is.
   They want Boston TV weather forecasters to stop predicting
on Monday and Tuesday bad weather for the weekend ahead.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"I understand their side. There is a demand for it," says
Thomas Larson, owner of the Pillar House Restaurant in Newton
and chairman of the Massachusetts Restaurant Association
Weather Task Force. "But if the {long-range} forecast doesn't
look so good, hey, keep it a secret because it's so harmful
to business."</p>
<p>To that end, the association has solicited complaints and
forwarded packets of its members' letters to the weathermen.</p>
<p>Mr. Larson says the problem is that long-range forecasts
aren't very accurate. He doesn't object to three-day
forecasts, which he concedes are usually right.</p>
<p>Restaurateurs are bitter about predictions that keep
tourists away from Cape Cod or the Berkshires. "Before
Memorial Day weekend, weathermen forecast terrible weather on
the Cape," recalls Cindy Eid, public-affairs coordinator for
the Massachusetts Restaurant Association. "They told people
if they wanted a peek of sun to head north. But it turned out
to be one of the best weekends of the summer."</p>
<p>Frank Cardullo, owner of the Wursthaus Restaurant, says
his Hyannis branch suffered $75,000 in lost revenue last
summer on good weekends after rain had been predicted.</p>
<p>Other restaurant owners say winter-storm warnings are even
worse.</p>
<p>M.S.M. Management Co., Danvers, says that two years ago
inaccurate predictions of a big storm for Feb. 24 cost its
restaurants $100,000 in lost revenue. That same weekend, the
Harvard Club of Boston says, "the irresponsibility of the
weather forecasters" led to the cancellation of a dinner
party for 250.</p>
<p>Some weathermen are sympathetic. Dick Albert, of WCVB-TV
in Boston, says the letters have sensitized him to the
problem, but he adds that he has avoided five-day forecasts
for many years.</p>
<p>But most stations say it's more important to give the
public what it wants. "Whenever we don't have time to do it,
the public complains," says Barry Burbank, of WBZ-TV. He says
he makes it clear that the long-range view is less reliable
than the short-range picture: "We don't call it a forecast.
We call it an outlook," he says.</p>
