	<p class="article-leader">The Justice Department threatened to block Procter &
Gamble Co.'s plans to market Rhone-Poulenc Rorer Inc.'s
Maalox antacid because the pact violates antitrust laws.
   The joint marketing pact would make P&G, which makes Pepto
Bismol, the biggest player in the U.S. over-the-counter
stomach remedies market, which could "substantially lessen
competition," said James F. Rill, assistant attorney general
at the Justice Department's antitrust division.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The pact could result in higher prices for consumers, he
said. "This lack of market competition would generally harm
consumers nationwide," Mr. Rill said.</p>
<p>Federal prosecutors said they will file a civil antitrust
suit in U.S. District Court in Philadelphia to challenge the
pact. P&G and Rhone-Poulenc Rorer said they disagree with the
department's conclusion and are assessing their alternatives,
but declined to elaborate.</p>
<p>In March, P&G acquired the U.S. marketing and distribution
rights to a variety of Rorer Group Inc.'s over-the-counter
drugs, such as Perdiem, a laxative, and Ascriptin, a
combination analgesic-antacid.</p>
<p>The Cincinnati consumer products company had tried to
acquire all of Rorer's over-the-counter drug business, but
was rebuffed. Earlier this year, Rhone-Poulenc S.A. of Paris,
a chemical company, merged most of its drug business with
Rorer, of Fort Washington, Pa., to form Rhone-Poulenc Rorer.</p>
<p>The Maalox marketing alliance was considered a coup for
P&G's drug business because it gave the company the leading
antacid without the high costs of developing a new brand.
Rorer, in turn, would receive payments from P&G and gain
rights to develop and market certain P&G prescription drugs.</p>
<p>Rorer says Maalox has a U.S. antacid market share of about
15%, but the brand has faced stiff competition from rivals
Tums and Mylanta.</p>
<p>Justice department officials estimate that 1989 sales of
over-the-counter stomach remedies were more than $900
million. P&G and Rorer had combined sales in that market of
more than $236 million, officials said.</p>
