	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- The sharp rise in the unemployment rate and
the slump in hiring in July confirm that the U.S. economy is
slowing substantially.
   The civilian jobless rate, which has barely moved one way
or the other for nearly two years, jumped 0.3 percentage
point to 5.5% in July, the highest rate in two years, the
Labor Department said. It hadn't risen that much in one month
since February 1986.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Payrolls, dragged down by the dismissal of 160,000
temporary census workers, fell 219,000 in July. The number of
jobs in private industry dropped 45,000 as construction
employment declined sharply, factory payrolls continued to
shrink and the growth in private service industries came to
an abrupt halt.</p>
<p>In the past six months, private industry has added workers
at a rate of only 66,000 a month, the slowest rate since the
recession of the early 1980s. "The services industry has been
the major engine of job growth during the current economic
expansion," said Janet Norwood, commissioner of labor
statistics. "But that engine seems to have sputtered in
July."</p>
<p>Although the U.S. economy has been exhibiting signs of
sluggishness for months, the latest employment figures were
bleaker than most economists and investors had anticipated.
"The economy is deteriorating faster than expected," said
economist Elliott Platt of Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette
Securities Corp.</p>
<p>The new data dispel any lingering hope that the U.S.
economy is bouncing back from the lethargic growth of the
first few months of the year -- and indicates it is now
growing even more slowly than the Federal Reserve had
intended when it braked the economy in an effort to restrain
inflation.</p>
<p>The Fed, which last month pushed interest rates down a bit
for the first time in more than six months, is now likely to
ease more aggressively to try to head off a recession -- or
curtail one, if it has already begun.</p>
<p>A disproportionate share of the increase in unemployment
in July was among teen-agers, the Labor Department said. The
jobless rate among teen-agers rose 2.2 percentage points to
16.3%, about a percentage point higher than it has averaged
in the past two years.</p>
<p>"While we cannot say for certain why teen-agers had more
difficulty in the labor market this summer," Mrs. Norwood
said, "we do know that job growth in the retail trade and
services industries, which employ many teen-agers, has slowed
considerably."</p>
<p>The Labor Department figures highlighted the divergent
economic conditions among regions of the country. In
Massachusetts, the most populous state in recessionary New
England, the jobless rate hit 6.1% in July, up from 4.3% a
year earlier. In New York, it rose to 5.3%, up from 4.8% a
year earlier. But in California, the unemployment rate was
5.1%, up only slightly from June and down from 5.2% in July
1989.</p>
<p>The jobless rate rose in July even though the labor force
-- all those working or looking for work -- shrank a bit. The
surprisingly slow growth of the labor force in the past
several months has helped keep the unemployment rate steady
at the lowest levels in 15 years as the economy's growth rate
slowed.</p>
<p>In the past 12 months, the labor force has grown by only
660,000, the Labor Department said. In the past five years,
the labor force has grown by an average of two million from
one July to the next. Although the shrinking number of young
people entering the labor force is a major factor, economists
say it doesn't fully explain the slow labor force growth.</p>
<p>A measure of the national employment rate that includes
the armed forces rose to 5.4% in July from 5.1% in June.</p>
<p>The Labor Department's survey of employers, closely
watched by economists as among the most reliable guides to
the economy, showed hardly any bright spots.</p>
<p>Construction employment dropped 50,000 in July and has
declined more than 100,000 since last fall. Manufacturing
employment was down another 7,000, a smaller drop than in
recent months. Factories employed 325,000 fewer workers in
July than at the recent peak in March 1989. The
health-services industry, which has added an average of
50,000 jobs a month in the first half of the year, added only
half that many in July.</p>
