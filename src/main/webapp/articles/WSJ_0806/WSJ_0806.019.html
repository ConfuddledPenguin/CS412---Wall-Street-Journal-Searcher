	<p class="article-leader">EVANSVILLE, Ind. -- The banner over the counter proclaims
"Pizzaaah]" But nearly everyone in the restaurant is eating
something else. After all, this is McDonald's, where people
usually go for burgers and french fries.
   Evansville is among a half dozen test-market towns where
McDonald's Corp. is selling its version of pizza. But if
visits to several Midwest test sites are indicative,
McDonald's pizza has little pizazz. Orders are only
occasional, and customer reviews are mixed. A competitor says
that McDonald's share of the Evansville pizza market has
shrunk to barely 2% from an initial 7%. To stimulate sales,
McDonald's is heavily discounting some pies, and it has
broken its vow not to sell pizza before 4 p.m.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"We continue to get good customer acceptance of the
product," a company spokesman insists. But he won't say when
McDonald's will decide whether to go national with the
current product.</p>
<p>McDonald's fiddled with salads for seven years before
rolling them out. It is counting heavily on pizza to increase
evening traffic -- its slowest part of the day -- and to
offset what it admits are disappointing U.S. sales.</p>
<p>But the product's future may not depend on adults' tastes,
as Debbie Reid of nearby Newburgh attests. She recently
ordered $1.99 slices of McDonald's bacon double cheeseburger
pizza for her family for lunch. Her children -- who soon
abandoned their pizza for the carousel and slide in Ronald
McDonald's playland -- wanted to eat at McDonald's. Like
millions of other parents, Mrs. Reid acquiesced. "The kids
like it -- it's tolerable to me," she says.</p>
<p>Indeed, child power may be as important as the pepperoni
in McDonald's pizza; if kids like it, they will drag their
parents along for yet another meal.</p>
<p>McDonald's is also testing pizza in Fresno, Calif.,
Hartford, Conn., and Las Vegas, Nev., as well as a few
Chicago suburbs, but Evansville was the first site, and the
arrival of pizza there has touched off a veritable war.
Motorists are bombarded by billboards from Pizza Hut,
Domino's and Noble Roman's as well as McDonald's, whose
latest sign says simply, "Pizza tonight."</p>
<p>Price-cutting abounds. A McDonald's 12-inch pepperoni pie
is on sale for $4.99, down from $7.35 -- a price Pizza Hut
and Domino's quickly matched. Lunchtime offers a bargain
hunter's bonanza. Godfather's in nearby Henderson, Ky.,
features an all-you-can-eat pizza buffet for $2.99 between 11
a.m. and 2 p.m. A Mazzio's outlet across the road from a
McDonald's in Owensboro, Ky., advertises 99-cent slices.</p>
<p>At first, McDonald's avoided selling pizza for lunch
because it weakened the company's dinner-building strategy
and required making pies in advance, undermining freshness.
But last month it joined the noon feeding frenzy with
quarter-pie pieces. The company won't comment on its
lunchtime slices, other than to characterize them as "a
limited-time offer in Evansville only."</p>
<p>Pizza Hut, with 25 outlets in the market, continues to
snipe at the interloping hamburger giant, which has 27 stores
here. Its initial ads belittled McDonald's use of frozen
dough. Commercials now mock the entire product. "When we'd
mention McDonald's pizza in our focus groups, everybody
thought it was a joke," says David Novak, senior vice
president, marketing, for the PepsiCo Inc. unit.</p>
<p>That may be why McDonald's radio spots here refer to its
fare as "serious pizza." Also, while it can't match pizzerias
selling beer, McDonald's restaurants feature soda pop by the
pitcher at night.</p>
<p>Pizza Hut's Mr. Novak contends the battle -- though not
the war -- is over. "Our sales are growing in all of our
service segments in Evansville -- delivery, carryout and
dining," he says of the nation's largest pizza chain. Mr.
Novak cites the 2% market-share estimate for McDonald's but
adds, "We think they're going to get into the pizza category.
. . . I wouldn't say it's going to be this product, though."</p>
<p>The current pizza is McDonald's third public try. Samples
of the product here and in Downers Grove, Ill., west of
Chicago, found it uncharacteristically inconsistent. Toppings
weren't always evenly spread. Sometimes cheese slid off the
crust when slices were pulled from the pie. Often there was
only a blush of tomato sauce. And several patrons complained
about the crust's taste; one likened it to a biscuit.</p>
<p>To turn pizza into a winner, McDonald's must overcome
several problems. One is the speed issue. The promised
six-minute wait -- an ambitious and sometimes-elusive goal --
may be too long, even in the more leisurely dinner hour.
Drive-through customers may object to the inconvenience of
pulling over to the side to wait for orders.</p>
<p>Price is another factor. Restaurant industry analysts
blame some of McDonald's sales slippage on high menu prices.
At a minimum of $4.99 a pie, pizza becomes its most expensive
item. Even the $1.99 lunchtime slices cost more than any
sandwich on its Evansville menu boards. McDonald's seems to
be searching for the ideal price; its pies in Downers Grove
were costing about $1 more until last week, when prices fell
below those in Evansville.</p>
<p>There are also operational bugs. Although it was a slack
time, the Downers Grove crew got one couple's two-pizza order
fouled up. Drive-through pizzas sometimes come without
napkins. An Evansville menu board had different prices for
the same item. Stores in the Evansville-Owensboro market had
"save big dough" coupons for patrons charging pizzas on Visa
or MasterCard, but the discount price was $1 more than the
pizza was selling for at the time. Discount coupons at
Downers Grove had already expired.</p>
<p>"Pizza to them is like sandwiches to us. They throw a
wrench in the operation," a Pizza Hut supervisor here says.</p>
<p>Still, McDonald's seems committed to pizza. One Owensboro
restaurant has a separate "Pizza Shoppe" built into it,
including large windows for patrons to watch the cooking
operation.</p>
<p>Since starting its test, McDonald's has shrunk its pie to
12 inches from 14. One innovation: No polystyrene is used in
its pizza's packaging. Whole pies come in heavy-duty
cardboard boxes, while slices are boxed in slick white paper.</p>
<p>When customers order pizzas at the counter, they
immediately receive their drinks and other food. Later, red
wire racks are brought to their tables. The racks, which
serve as stands for the pizza, contain jars of grated cheese
and red peppers along with salt, pepper and a candle. The
pizzas arrive on perforated aluminum plates on red plastic
trays.</p>
<p>Consumer opinion on the product is mixed. "I love it,"
says Linda Mullins at Downers Grove. "Everything's fresh,
nothing's greasy. It's definitely different. Most pizzas,
everything's mooshy."</p>
<p>But Steven Rothman, a Wheaton, Ill., real estate broker,
likens it to "a supermarket product" that's neither tasty nor
spicy enough. "I don't think the product is going to last,"
he says.</p>
<p>Only a few pizzas were sold each hour during a recent
Friday night at the Downers Grove site a few miles from
McDonald's corporate headquarters. Unlike restaurants in
Evansville, the store there has no signs outside indicating
it has pizza. "We're not allowed to advertise it," the
manager on duty says. "We don't want the media to know."
Nonetheless, she says, "it's starting to catch on."</p>
<p>But in Henderson, Ky., Lori Putman, 19 years old, remains
unimpressed. A onetime crew trainer at a McDonald's
restaurant, she recently left for a Godfather's pizza house a
few doors away. When she quit, she says, her boss told her,
"`We're going to put Godfather's out of business.'" I told
him, `I don't think so, honey.'"</p>
