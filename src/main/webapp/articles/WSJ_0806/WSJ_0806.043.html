	<p class="article-leader">U S West Inc. said Jack A. MacAllister, who has headed the
Denver-based regional telephone operating company since it
was created in the Bell System breakup, will retire as chief
executive officer Dec. 31 but remain chairman.
   Mr. MacAllister, 63 years old, will be succeeded by
Richard D. McCormick, 50, who also will remain president and
chief operating officer.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Analysts said the transition should be smooth. "This is
not a dramatic change," Daniel Reingold of Morgan Stanley &
Co. said. "Perhaps Mr. MacAllister has a little more time for
golf, but he remains chairman of the board."</p>
<p>Mr. McCormick said in an interview that he plans to build
U S West's core and related businesses by improving products
for the telecommunications company's 25 million customers. U
S West, which also has interests in directory publishing,
real estate, cellular phones and computer software, has begun
an ambitious five-year, $10 billion program to upgrade its
network with digital switching and fiber optics. New products
and services are expected to bring in about $100 million in
revenue next year. In 1989, U S West earned $1.11 billion, or
$6.02 a share, on revenue of $9.69 billion.</p>
<p>Faced with a sluggish economy in much of its 14-state
territory, U S West has been looking for growth overseas. Mr.
McCormick said the company will continue this effort,
building its foreign business along the lines of its cellular
and network agreements with Czechoslovakia and Hungary. He
mentioned Eastern Europe as potential markets.</p>
<p>Mr. McCormick, an engineer who began his career with
American Telephone & Telegraph Co. in 1961, was president of
Northwestern Bell Co. before moving to U S West as executive
vice president in 1985. Northwestern Bell became part of U S
West when the regional Bell operating companies were created.</p>
<p>Mr. MacAllister probably will continue his role as an
industry and U S West spokesman, though he said he wants to
spend more time with his family. He also said he plans to
focus on public education issues and on job training and
employment for the homeless. At U S West, Mr. MacAllister has
put a premium on education, setting up programs aimed at
assisting public schools, rewarding outstanding teachers
throughout the company's territory, and exploring ways to
improve early childhood education.</p>
<p>Mr. MacAllister was named to head U S West shortly after
the breakup of the Bell System was announced in 1982. Prior
to that assignment, he was president of Northwestern Bell in
Omaha, Neb. He began his 40-year career as an
installer-repairman in Council Bluffs, Iowa, and held a
number of executive positions at Northwestern Bell and AT&T.</p>
<p>Of the initial chief executives of the seven Baby Bell
companies, only two others remain: John Clendenin at
BellSouth Corp., Atlanta, and William Weiss at Ameritech,
Chicago.</p>
