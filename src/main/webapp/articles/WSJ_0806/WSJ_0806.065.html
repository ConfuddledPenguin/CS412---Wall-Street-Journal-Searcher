	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- After Iraq attacked Kuwait, the Soviets
announced they would cut off arms shipments to Baghdad.
Quietly, however, they went one step further, ordering
weapons ships en route to Iraq to reverse course.
   This account, provided by a senior State Department
official, underscores the new Soviet willingness to cooperate
with the U.S. But just as the Soviets are powerless to force
President Saddam Hussein to withdraw his troops from Kuwait,
so too are the superpowers limited in how far they can use
their newfound unity to ease tensions among their client
nations elsewhere -- in Afghanistan, Southeast Asia and
Central America.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>As the superpower conflict ends, the Soviets are no longer
interested in dominating Third World states. Moreover, their
foreign aid is declining rapidly because of domestic
problems. For the U.S., the end of the Cold War means that
the nations that once followed Washington because it was
their shield against communism are now more inclined to go
their own way. And pressing domestic needs prevent the U.S.,
like the Soviet Union, from buying influence abroad.</p>
<p>"When something bad happens, the Soviets no longer assume
it's us causing it and we no longer assume it's them," says
Burton Pines, senior vice president of the conservative
Heritage Foundation. "Now the question is how much leverage
do we {the superpowers} have over everybody else?"</p>
<p>Moscow and Washington have been edging closer, for
example, to a common formula to resolve the thorny issue of
Cambodia. When the five permanent members of the United
Nations Security Council met in Paris in January, the Soviets
supported the general idea of elections there, but wouldn't
go along with setting up an international structure that
would have authority to actually administer an election.</p>
<p>Last week, when Secretary of State James Baker discussed
this issue with Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze
during talks in Irkutsk, Siberia, the Soviets endorsed a more
active role for the United Nations and for a Supreme National
Council in an election process. "It sure looked like our
positions were not very far apart," says a U.S. official who
participated in the sessions.</p>
<p>But getting real-world benefit from the agreement may be
another matter. U.S. officials aren't sure that Moscow can
get Vietnam, which installed the government in Cambodia, to
cooperate. Soviet aid to Vietnam has declined, and the
substantial assistance that Hanoi once received from Moscow's
former East European satellites has evaporated.</p>
<p>"Nobody knows how much leverage the Soviets still have
over Vietnam until they try to use it," says a U.S. official.</p>
<p>Concerning Afghanistan, Moscow and Washington are steadily
narrowing their differences but neither superpower is able to
impose solutions on the participants. Some of the U.S.-backed
mujahedeen guerrillas fighting Afghanistan's Communist
government are Islamic fundamentalists who are as
anti-American as they are anti-Soviet. And, one U.S. analyst
says, Moscow has never been succeeded in exercising total
control in Afghanistan.</p>
<p>Similarly, in El Salvador, Moscow "has made clear to us
that they'll make every effort to support a political
process," says a senior State Department official. "But we
just can't say if they will be able to deliver," he adds.
Leftist guerrillas in El Salvador still are being supplied by
Cuba, which shows no signs of bending to Moscow's new
cooperative line.</p>
<p>Mr. Pines of the Heritage Foundation says the new
U.S.-Soviet partnership may be most effective in bolstering
the efforts of the United Nations and other international
organizations in underdeveloped countries. During the Cold
War, many of these nations became embroiled in the East-West
ideological struggle and adopted Marxist economies. Nearly
all have become economic basket cases.</p>
<p>Now, Moscow could join the U.S. in promoting free market
economics. "All the Soviets would have to do is take some of
the resolutions passed recently by the Moscow city council,
send them off to places like Tanzania and say, try this,"
concludes Mr. Pines.</p>
