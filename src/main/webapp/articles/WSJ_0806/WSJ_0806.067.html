   Eschew Pop Quizzes</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>FOR YEARS, help-wanted classifieds have ended on a note of
invitation: The advertiser is an "equal opportunity
employer." Now, some end with a warning: "Drug-Testing
Employer."</p>
<p>Some companies view this as a courtesy. "I don't think
it's fair to spring something like that on someone," says
Linda Williams, human-resource manager at HomeFed Bank. The
San Diego financial institution began pre-employment
screening last fall, and thinks the warning itself may be a
deterrent. Besides, a surprise test is no way to begin a
relationship, says Ms. Williams. "You don't want to say,
`Hey, we really like you. Now go take a drug test.'"</p>
<p>As companies' drug policies evolve, firms are wrestling
with when and how to tell job candidates about the tests.
Most employees learn about them during the application
process.</p>
<p>Paris Couturiaux, vice president for human resources,
Twentieth Century Investors, a mutual fund, says the ad
warning helps prevent arguments later with people who believe
tests violate their privacy. The ad is like a prospectus, he
says. "If you don't want to {be tested}, don't apply."</p>
<p>Recruiters Faulted</p>
<p>For Resume Touch-Ups</p>
<p>WOULD AN executive recruiter lie on his own resume? Yes,
contends a recruiting-industry watchdog. And many recruiters
agree.</p>
<p>The watchdog is James Kennedy, publisher of Executive
Recruiter News, a trade publication. In recent issues, he
claims that various recruiters list credentials they don't
have.</p>
<p>His commentary hasn't gone unnoticed. Robert L. Smith,
chairman of the Association of Executive Search Consultants,
shot off a memo to members: "You might want to review your
own materials {to make sure they reflect} the level of
professional pride that you so justly feel." The group's
ethics committee made a brief inquiry into one headhunter's
background and cleared him.</p>
<p>Some in the industry complain that Mr. Kennedy exaggerates
the problem, harping on small or outdated inconsistencies.
For example, Andrew Sherwood of Goodrich & Sherwood, a New
York firm, acknowledges that for several years he used a
brochure claiming a Master's degree he almost finished but
never got. But that was 20 years ago.</p>
<p>The AESC's Mr. Smith says the recruitment industry has
"matured" only recently. Some people who once fudged have
long since come clean. The group's members, he notes, are
required to sign an ethics pledge. But its membership makes
up only a fraction of the industry.</p>
<p>Some of Mr. Kennedy's jabs have been aimed at claims made
by some executives in a new book, "The Career Makers," which
profiles 100 recruiters. The author, John Sibbald, a Chicago
headhunter, stands by his book. Mr. Kennedy, he maintains,
"does these little witch hunts." But he agrees that
recruiters occasionally misrepresent themselves. If their
firms find out, he says, they clean house quietly or sweep it
under the carpet.</p>
<p>Electronic Mail: Is It</p>
<p>For Your Eyes Only?</p>
<p>MOST EMPLOYEES use the office phone without much thought
about privacy. They apparently are no more careful about
electronic mail systems, or e-mail. But, sometimes, their
bliss is ignorance, experts contend.</p>
<p>A common hazard is "masquerading," when colleagues slip
into privileged networks or private mailboxes, says Lee
Sproull, an e-mail expert at Carnegie Mellon University.
"Borrowing" passwords is relatively easy, warns Michael Baum,
an attorney concerned with electronic security, especially if
users make obvious choices, such as a nickname.</p>
<p>Scarier for employees, though, may be management
monitoring. Most companies say they have policies protecting
privacy. But some do monitor, says Mr. Baum, even if "they're
not going to advertise it." The issue already has hit the
courts. One suit involves Alana Shoars, former e-mail
administrator at Epson America, who says she assured
employees of the computer maker that the system was private.
Then, she alleges, she found her boss reading reams of e-mail
printouts. When confronted, he fired her, she claims. His
stated reason, she adds, could only have been based on
something he read -- and misinterpreted -- in her own e-mail.</p>
<p>Ms. Shoars has sued Epson for wrongful discharge. Epson
claims she was fired for "insubordination" and that it had
"nothing to do with e-mail." Either way, says Mr. Baum, the
suit is sending "cold shudders" down some corporate spines.</p>
<p>Drucker Puts Name</p>
<p>On Nonprofit Group</p>
<p>PETER DRUCKER is lending his moniker to a group only
recently credited with management savvy.</p>
<p>The Peter F. Drucker Foundation for Non-Profit Management
will be launched this fall with the highly regarded author as
honorary chairman and Frances Hesselbein, former national
head of Girl Scouts, as president.</p>
<p>The foundation will provide service and education to
nonprofit groups, which Ms. Hesselbein terms the "third
sector" of the economy and its fastest-growing. Its founding
underscores that, as Mr. Drucker wrote last year in the
Harvard Business Review, nonprofits no longer consider
"management a dirty word."</p>
<p>In fact, he says, they often excel where for-profit
companies fail. Because they don't focus just on the bottom
line, they truly understand the customer, whether a Brownie
Scout or Salvation Army parolee. Ms. Hesselbein is the one
manager Mr. Drucker has said he would recommend to head GM.</p>
