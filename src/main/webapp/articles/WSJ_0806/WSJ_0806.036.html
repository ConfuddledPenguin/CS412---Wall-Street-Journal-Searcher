	<p class="article-leader">ROCKFORD, Ill. -- Elco Industries Inc., hurt by continued
softness in its auto-related business and start-up losses at
a joint venture, expects to report profit fell 30% in the
fourth quarter ended June 30.
   Jack W. Packard, chairman and chief executive of the maker
of fasteners, said earnings fell to about $1.4 million, or 29
to 30 cents a share, from $2 million, or 43 cents a share, a
year earlier. Sales rose slightly, to about $40 million from
$39.4 million a year earlier.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Elco's consumer business was strong, Mr. Packard said, but
failed to offset lower margins in its auto-parts business.
Mr. Packard said losses at the Rocknel Fastener joint venture
with Japan's Nagoya Screw Manufacturing Co. reduced
fourth-quarter earnings about $300,000, or six cents a share.
The joint venture was set up to supply U.S. factories of
Japanese auto makers.</p>
<p>Mr. Packard said he expects the venture's sales to reach
an annual rate of about $8 million by June 1991 and for it to
show a profit by the fall of that year.</p>
<p>Elco's fourth-quarter estimates indicate earnings for the
year of about $4.8 million, or $1.01 a share, down from $7.8
million, or $1.65 a share, a year earlier.</p>
