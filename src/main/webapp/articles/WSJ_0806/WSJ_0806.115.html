it raised its stake in G.R.I. Corp., a Chicago-based
mail-order marketing concern, to 13.75%, and that it plans to

group said it is analyzing possible steps that G.R.I. could
take to increase the value of its common stock. In connection
with its G.R.I. investment, the group said it may take
certain actions it considers appropriate, depending on
various factors, including G.R.I.'s response to its request
for board representation. G.R.I. officials weren't available
to comment.</p>
