	<p class="article-leader">When reporters sit down over a beer and talk about a
broadcast journalists' Hall of Fame, the name that always
comes up first is Edward R. Murrow. The gritty voice, the
dangling cigarette, the steely lyricism of his words, the
unflinching intensity of his convictions -- Murrow has long
been the standard for the TV newsman's trade. "We all wanted
to be like him," recalls CBS's Charles Kuralt.
   So it's not surprising that Susan Steinberg's two-part
biography on the American Masters series, "Edward R. Murrow:
This Reporter" (PBS, tonight, 9 p.m. EDT; check local
listings), lively as it is, is something of a sanctification.
If there is such a thing as a patron saint of broadcast
journalism, it's Ed Murrow. But the great irony of his career
is that while everyone reveres him now, back in the late
1950s, even his own company, CBS, couldn't wait to be rid of
him. And frankly, despite all the lip service, if Murrow came
back today, he'd have problems getting two minutes of air
time.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The marriage of Murrow and television was always a prickly
one. He was not a natural TV presence. You could tell by the
awkward way he held his cigarette, the stiff, off-center pose
that he adopted as he peered up into the camera. And he
wasn't only uncomfortable with appearing on TV, he was
uncomfortable with the very idea of TV. While fascinated with
the technology, Murrow looked down on the medium. He looked
down on TV newsmen, especially the first anchors like Douglas
Edwards, as "performers." Today's anchors may claim him as
some sort of progenitor, but Ed Murrow was never a news
anchor, and he was a reluctant TV reporter.</p>
<p>First and foremost, Murrow was a radio man. Overseeing
CBS's radio coverage in Europe during the late 1930s, he was
unable to find enough reporters to cover all the stories
around the time of Hitler's rise, and so he ended up on the
air himself, as a stopgap measure. Of course, Murrow would
eventually gather a team of journalists, great journalists
who would become known as Murrow's Boys -- among them Eric
Sevareid, Howard K. Smith, Richard C. Hottelet, who were all
interviewed for this documentary. And of course, Murrow would
become the greatest on-air radio commentator of them all.</p>
<p>"This . . ." and half a heartbeat later ". . . is London."
Murrow's broadcasts brought World War II home to America. His
fiercely evocative word portraits told of blitzkriegs and
bombings and air-raid shelters.</p>
<p>After the war came television, and with it, Murrow's two
series, "See It Now" and "Person to Person," which was a
fairly lighthearted peek into the linen closets of the rich
and famous, from Brando to Bogart, from Castro to Dick Clark.
"See It Now" was the eight-yearlong docu-series that
solidified Murrow's fame and established him as the
"conscience of CBS" (in CBS Chairman William Paley's words).</p>
<p>The high point of "See It Now" -- some say the most
courageous use of television ever -- was the show that took
on Sen. Joseph McCarthy in 1954 (this week's installment
tells how the decision to do it was made). According to one
story told in Ms. Steinberg's film, Murrow gathered all his
CBS staff together before the program aired and asked if they
had any secrets that might damage the show's integrity. One
admitted to a former wife who had been a member of the Young
Communists. A silence fell over the group, and then Murrow
said, "The terror is right here, in this room. We go tomorrow
night."</p>
<p>But after this high point came a gradual falling off, when
the senior management decided it was a little fed up with all
the controversy generated by this "conscience of CBS." TV was
going in one direction, Murrow another. Evidence of the break
was an industry speech in 1958 in which Murrow condemned
"evidence of decadence, escapism and insulation from the
world in which we live" on TV.</p>
<p>The basic conflict had been there since the beginning.
Murrow was always a word and idea man in a medium governed by
the logic of pictures. If his prose occasionally veered
toward the overstated, the overblown, even the pompous, there
was still no question that this was a writer. Unlike most
correspondents today, he was never afraid to use a metaphor.
Once on a bombing raid, he looked down on a series of
incendiary explosions in nighttime Berlin and called them "a
fistful of white rice on black velvet."</p>
<p>His type of skill is not in style anymore. Today, writing
counts for less and less on TV -- something Ms. Steinberg's
own documentary inadvertently proves. "Edward R. Murrow: This
Reporter" is certainly an engaging look at an important
career, with all sorts of recognizable faces (Dan Rather, Ted
Koppel, Diane Sawyer, Walter Cronkite) chiming in. That makes
it fun.</p>
<p>But in keeping with the current vogue in
documentary-making, this one has no narration (with the
exception of one or two voice-overs from Mr. Kuralt), no
through line, and for this kind of film, that's a real
shortcoming. A sense of structure is missing. Told as an oral
history, the program is a compilation of quotes touching end
to end like dominoes, but like a game of dominoes, it
meanders all over the place.</p>
<p>The program also suffers from something that Murrow would
never have countenanced: a shortage of facts. When was he
born? When did he die? The documentary rarely answers the
most basic questions -- who, what, when, where and why.</p>
<p>Worst of all, the show dribbles off to a soggy finish,
showing kids in high school today viewing one of Murrow's
last pieces (the powerful "Harvest of Shame") and explaining
why it's relevant to them.</p>
<p>To be fair, "Edward R. Murrow: This Reporter" is an
enjoyable collection of anecdotes, but what it lacks is a
strong guiding intelligence. In fact, like too much of
today's TV, it lacks exactly what Murrow could have given it.</p>
