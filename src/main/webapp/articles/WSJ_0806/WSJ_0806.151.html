	<p class="article-leader">The U.S. is lucky in having two friendly, oil-producing
neighbors. Too bad neither can come close to cranking out
enough to make up for lost Mideast oil.
   With its abundant crude reserves and close ties to the
Bush administration, Mexico at first glance seems like the
ace in the hole for the U.S. during the Iraq crisis. But look
closer, oil analysts say, and doubts emerge about Mexico's
ability to step up oil production enough to help fill the
void left by Kuwait's fall to the Iraqis.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Likewise, after spending billions of dollars on subsidized
oil exploration, Canadians are no longer promoting their
country as a counterweight to the Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries. Exploration has slumped and major oil
development projects have been shelved or canceled as a
result of the fall in oil prices and smaller-than-expected
oil finds. Canadian oil analysts see no sign of an early
turnaround even if the current Mideast crisis pushes up oil
prices.</p>
<p>"Canada doesn't look as promising as in the 1970s, when we
were wining and dining people from around the world with
regard to Dome Petroleum Ltd. and the Beaufort Sea," says Ian
Doig, editor of Doig's Digest, an oil publication. Dome
Petroleum ran up huge debts in Arctic exploration before it
was acquired by a Canadian unit of Amoco Corp. in 1988.</p>
<p>Venezuela may turn out to be the best hope. Analysts say
Venezuela could relatively quickly supply an extra 700,000
barrels a day -- replacing nearly half of Kuwait's daily
output of 1.6 million barrels. However, Venezuela hasn't yet
said whether it plans to increase production. And there's
still the question of filling the gap of Iraq's 2.8 million
barrels a day of output.</p>
<p>To be sure, continued high prices for oil could spur U.S.
oil companies to resume full-scale drilling activity in
Texas. Even so, the dependence on imported oil isn't likely
to go away.</p>
<p>Mexico has abundant natural resources. The government
estimates its reserves at 45 billion barrels of oil, with an
additional 21 billion barrels of condensate and dry gas.
Bernardo Grossling, a petroleum geologist at the U.S.
Geological Survey, says there's a good probability that
Mexico's reserves are as much as 260 billion barrels. "I
would put Mexico's potential higher than Saudi Arabia's," he
says.</p>
<p>It's extracting those reserves that's a problem. Petroleos
Mexicanos S.A., the Mexican state oil monopoly, is the
world's fifth-largest oil company and supplies about 11% of
U.S. crude. About 55% of the 1.2 million barrels it exports
each day go to the U.S. But Pemex is widely considered the
most inefficient operator.</p>
<p>"My best guess is that Pemex cannot increase production
too much, and wouldn't be able to sustain any increase it
does make for very long," says Benito Solis, a Mexican
economist and business consultant. Analysts say it would take
profound and politically delicate changes in Mexico's
nationalistic oil policy, hundreds of millions of dollars in
investment and lots of time for the country to achieve a
sustained increase in output.</p>
<p>Since the debt crisis of 1982, Mexico's capital investment
in Pemex has shrunk by 75%, as the government has milked the
state company's coffers to meet interest payments. Mechanical
problems stemming from neglected maintenance continually
plague drilling rigs in the Bay of Campeche. The company's
mammoth Morelos Petrochemical Complex is years behind
schedule and still $1.5 billion short of being finished.
Cutbacks in exploration have been so severe that Pemex last
year drilled only about half the exploratory wells it did in
1987.</p>
<p>Pinching Pemex from the other side is domestic demand that
is burgeoning by 7% a year, spurred by a growing population
and more vibrant economy. Consumption of gasoline has been so
great that the government had to import 10,000 barrels of
gasoline a day in the first five months of this year.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Mexico's proven reserves have declined 8% since
1984 and a Pemex study says Mexico mightn't have sufficient
crude to export by 1997 if it doesn't significantly increase
productivity.</p>
<p>Making Pemex more efficient would require a massive
restructuring. President Carlos Salinas de Gortari laid the
groundwork for such an overhaul last year when he arrested
the powerful and corrupt head of the oil workers' union. The
government followed up by cutting some union privileges,
expanding private-sector participation in petrochemicals, and
establishing a new marketing affiliate to push Pemex into the
spot market.</p>
<p>But investors say the government must find some
legislative formula for bringing private capital into
exploration and production. Pemex's poor reputation for
efficiency makes it hard for the company to find partners.</p>
<p>Some say the sudden increase in oil prices will postpone
needed reforms in Pemex. For each $1-a-barrel increase in the
price of oil, Mexico's revenues jump $450 million or $500
million. "Increased oil revenues reduce the pressure for
change," says Mr. Solis. "In the short term, it's great for
the budget."</p>
<p>Canada has a different set of difficulties tapping into
its large reserves, which aren't easily accessible. Industry
executives say crude prices would have to rise sharply to
warrant development of its costly far north reserves and its
big western Canadian deposits of tar sands, a tarlike mixture
of sand, clay, water and bitumen. In the meantime, Canada's
reserves are expected to continue declining. Since 1985,
production has exceeded annual additions to the reserves.</p>
<p>Canada's reserves of "conventional" crude oil are
estimated at 4.2 billion barrels. Conventional crude doesn't
include resources in the frontier areas and the tar sands
reserves that are produced by high-cost mining operations.</p>
<p>If a new oil supply crisis were to occur, Canada couldn't
immediately boost its production, because it doesn't have the
available capacity, said Hans Maciej, vice president of the
Canadian Petroleum Association, an industry group. Canada
exports about 700,000 barrels of crude oil a day, most of it
to the U.S. Midwest. It imports about 500,000 barrels a day
for its eastern Canadian refineries, leaving net exports of
about 200,000 barrels a day.</p>
<p>Three oil fields are due to be developed off the Canadian
east coast, but their production is expected to no more than
offset the expected decline in output from western Canadian
fields. The three fields include the Hibernia oil field off
the Newfoundland coast. Hibernia was discovered 11 years ago,
but its development has been delayed by jurisdictional
disputes and financial problems. If a final agreement on
Hibernia's development is reached later this month as
expected, the field would produce about 110,000 barrels of
oil a day, starting in 1996.</p>
<p>Bernard Picchi, oil analyst at Salomon Brothers Inc., said
the Canadian government can no longer afford its heavy
subsidies for oil exploration and development because of its
budget deficit, expected to total 28.5 billion Canadian
dollars (US$24.8 billion) this year. As a cost-saving
measure, the government recently terminated its exploration
incentives program for conventional oil drilling.</p>
<p>After two decades of subsidized exploration in the
Canadian sector of the Beaufort Sea, drilling in the region
has come to a halt this year for lack of interest among oil
companies.</p>
<p>The prospects also don't look bright for further
development of synthetic oil from the western Canadian heavy
oil and tar sands deposits. Synthetic crude oil production
plants are "extremely expensive refineries" and their
construction could never have been undertaken without
subsidies, says Mr. Picchi of Salomon Brothers.</p>
