	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- Wild forces have buffeted the dollar on
international exchange markets in recent days. First, signs
of a weak economy drove it to historic lows. Then, Saddam
Hussein's invasion of Kuwait brought investors scurrying back
to the greenback's safety and sent it soaring again.
   But one force has been noticeably absent from currency
markets for months: the U.S. Treasury. After a bout of
hyperactive intervention early this year, the Treasury's
dollar operatives have been unusually silent.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>In part, the Treasury's quiesence results from a
preoccupation with domestic problems. Secretary Nicholas
Brady has been tied up in budget talks. And the other major
nations in the Group of Seven, which coordinates
international economic policies, have also been focused on
events at home. Germany is concentrating on unification.
Japan is trying to fulfill its obligations to lower barriers
as part of its "structural impediments initiative" with the
U.S. For all three nations, exchange-rate concerns have moved
to the back burner.</p>
<p>"There appears to be an unwritten G-7 agreement that the
U.S., Japan and Germany will take a pause and bring their
domestic policies in line as part of their coordination
agreement," says David Smick, a Washington-based consultant
who closely monitors international monetary affairs.</p>
<p>The Treasury's restraint, however, also reflects a new
political reality. Since the first of the year, the
Treasury's exchange-rate policies have come under heavy
attack, first from the Federal Reserve and now from Congress.
The double-barreled assault may have given the Treasury
second thoughts.</p>
<p>Treasury officials have long claimed autonomy in acting in
international markets. Their efforts to influence exchange
rates by buying or selling dollars are conducted in
conjunction with the Fed, but the Treasury secretary has the
final word. "The Fed doesn't intervene unless the Treasury
approves," says Robert Solomon, a former Treasury official.</p>
<p>Moreover, the money used for such operations isn't
appropriated by Congress, but rather comes from an "exchange
stabilization fund," established in 1934 and free from
congressional scrutiny. Treasury officials are quick to cite
the wording of the 1934 law, which states that "decisions of
the Treasury Secretary as to the use of the ESF are final and
may not be reviewed by another officer or employee of
government."</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the Treasury this year has discovered there
are limits to its powers. That recognition began in March,
when the Treasury sold $1.7 billion in an effort to drive the
dollar down against the yen. The move had the unintended
consequence of sparking a revolt at the Fed. Central bank
officials complained the Treasury's massive and frequent
interventions were potentially costly and having little
effect. And they said that by selling dollars on the
international market, the Treasury was putting more money
into circulation and undercutting the Fed's efforts to
control inflation.</p>
<p>The revolt peaked in late March, when three Fed policy
makers -- Cleveland Fed President Lee Hoskins and Governors
Wayne Angell and John LaWare -- took the unusual step of
voting against an increase in resources for the Treasury's
exchange-rate efforts at a meeting of the Fed's policy
committee.</p>
<p>At about the same time, Vice Chairman Manuel Johnson
publicly criticized the Treasury's policies. And Chairman
Alan Greenspan did so privately, in urgent phone
conversations with Secretary Brady. The message finally got
through, and by early April the dollar bashing had stopped.</p>
<p>More recently, the attack on Treasury has come from House
Banking Committee Chairman Henry Gonzalez, a Texas Democrat
who helped the Treasury shepherd its savings and loan rescue
bill through Congress. Mr. Gonzalez believes the Treasury's
use of the exchange stabilization fund violates the
constitutional notion that Congress controls the nation's
purse strings.</p>
<p>Mr. Gonzalez is forfeiting a portion of his vacation to
hold a hearing on Aug. 14 looking into the matter. In a press
release announcing the hearing, he complained that the
exchange stabilization fund is a "$25 billion slush fund that
lacks accountability."</p>
<p>He said the Treasury's efforts to sell dollars and buy
foreign currencies had caused the foreign-currency holdings
of the U.S. to rise from $10 billion in July 1988 to more
than $46 billion today. If those currencies depreciate, he
said, "the taxpayer could be faced with the loss of billions
of dollars."
</p>
<p>Mr. Gonzalez proposes to allow Congress's General
Accounting Office to audit the stabilization fund. And he has
even suggested that Treasury be stripped of its intervention
authority. His committee, he said, "will evaluate whether or
not the Treasury Department should be in the business of
manipulating the foreign-exchange value of the dollar" and
will question "whether this powerful monetary tool should
rest entirely within the central bank."</p>
<p>Does Mr. Gonzalez really intend to take Treasury's
exchange rate intervention powers away? Probably not. But
he's clearly trying to make a point. "A spoiled brat
sometimes doesn't take a reprimand," he says in an interview.
"You have to whip him a little."</p>
<p>Treasury officials say there has been no change in their
policies, and that "intervention levels reflect market
condition." But with both the Fed and the Congress
questioning its authority, the Treasury may have to pull in
its horns. The result: The government's efforts to influence
exchange rates may become less aggressive in the future.</p>
