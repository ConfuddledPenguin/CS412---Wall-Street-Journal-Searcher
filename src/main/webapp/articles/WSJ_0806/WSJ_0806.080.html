	<p class="article-leader">MIAMI -- The Eastern Airlines pilots union said its
members authorized a strike if they don't reach agreement on
a new contract, but any such job action will have little
effect on the carrier.
   Most of the union pilots still aren't flying for the
airline. After being nearly grounded by a strike and
subsequent bankruptcy-law filing last year, Eastern refilled
its cockpits with 1,800 replacement pilots and pilots who
crossed the picket lines. By the time the Air Line Pilots
Association abandoned its job action last November, the
airline said it had all the pilots it needed and refused to
reinstate the former strikers.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Eastern has said repeatedly that any pilots strike would
be a "non-event." Martin R. Shugrue Jr., the court-appointed
trustee who is running Eastern, said, "It's hard to
understand how pilots who are not working can go on strike."</p>
<p>Eastern's 3,600 pilots initially went on strike in
sympathy with the airline's machinists. The current dispute
centers on the contract for pilots, in which they have said
they are willing to forfeit wage increases in favor of
getting their old jobs back.</p>
<p>The pilots union said contract talks are scheduled to
resume this week, supervised by the National Mediation Board,
the federal agency that oversees airline labor.</p>
<p>Federal mediators last month declared the two sides at an
impasse, and began a 30-day countdown that expires at
midnight EDT Aug. 10, after which the airline could impose
its own contract and the pilots would be free to strike.</p>
