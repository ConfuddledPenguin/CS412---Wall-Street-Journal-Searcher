	<p class="article-leader">After aggressive oil-industry lobbying, the Bush
administration reversed course to allow hundreds of millions
of dollars of Iraqi and Kuwaiti crude already on tankers
headed to the U.S. to unload.
   Initially the president embargoed all Iraqi imports,
including crude already ordered and paid for. That sent oil
companies scrambling for substitute supplies and partially
contributed to last week's big run-up in crude and gasoline
prices. Customs officials for a time even seized at least one
cargo belonging to Coastal Corp. in Corpus Christi, Texas.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Late Friday the Treasury department issued rules stating
that any oil loaded before last Thursday morning with a bill
of lading issued before then was exempt if it arrived in the
U.S. before Oct. 1. Any remaining payments due on such oil
would be made into a "blocked account" rather than to Iraq.</p>
<p>The precise amount of oil involved couldn't be determined.
But the U.S. had been importing about 633,000 barrels of
crude from those two countries a day; at current prices a
month's worth would exceed $430 million. Some industry
reports have put the amount of oil at sea 50% higher. A Coast
Guard spokesman in Washington said about 15 tankers carrying
Iraqi crude were due to dock at five ports along the Gulf
Coast just through next week.</p>
<p>A Treasury spokeswoman said the rules were issued "to
minimize the negative effects on the U.S. economy" while
making sure "that no benefits accrued to Iraq."</p>
<p>"I talked directly to Henson Moore," the deputy energy
secretary, said Ron Haddock, chief executive officer of
American Petrofina Inc. in Dallas. The company was awaiting
five million barrels of Iraqi and Kuwaiti crude loaded before
the embargo was issued. "Once people understood the situation
we had a sympathetic ear," Mr. Haddock said.</p>
<p>The company's Washington law firm also pressed the issue,
as did a group of companies through their main trade group,
the American Petroleum Institute, Mr. Haddock said.
"Embargoing that oil wasn't hurting Iraq, it was hurting U.S.
companies and consumers," he said.</p>
<p>In San Francisco, a Chevron Corp. spokesman said: "We had
people in our Washington office working with the government
on it." Chevron has nine million barrels of Iraqi crude on
order, including 1.9 million barrels that was waiting to be
unloaded at its Pascagoula, Miss., refinery. That process
began yesterday morning, he said.</p>
<p>A spokesman for Ashland Oil Inc., a large refiner and
retailer in Ashland, Ky., said: "We had a tanker on the water
with one million barrels." But he said Ashland hasn't decided
whether to try to take delivery because it hasn't paid for
the crude yet. About 500,000 barrels of Iraqi crude is
nearing an Amoco Corp. refinery, a spokesman said, with
several more cargoes also en route.</p>
<p>A Coastal spokesman said it was unloading the 500,000
barrels of crude that had been embargoed. "We have several
more tankers that apparently will be coming and will be
exempted," he added.</p>
