	<p class="article-leader">GENEVA -- New Zealand's economic reform program is likely
to promote its structural adjustment and economic growth,
according to a new study by the General Agreement on Tariffs
and Trade, or GATT, the international body that governs most
world trade.
   The study, a mix of praise and criticism formulated by the
GATT secretariat, said the reforms will "strengthen the
country's links with the world economy and provide for trade
policies and practices which are more firmly based on GATT
rules and principles."</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The report also said, "The potential gains from
international trade are particularly large for New Zealand."</p>
<p>At the same time, however, the study hinged its judgment
on the proviso that the reforms are "consistently and fully
continued and implemented."</p>
<p>The report said New Zealand's trade policies "have
generally become less distortive and more transparent over
the last 10 years."</p>
<p>And it continued, "With the recent orientation of
trade-related policies, the country is already a more
attractive market for many trading partners through improved
market access and the prospects of accelerated medium-term
growth in a more efficient New Zealand economy."</p>
<p>The report praised New Zealand's liberalization drive.
"The coverage of import licensing has been reduced, tariffs
have been cut through a general tariff reduction program,
most export incentive schemes and subsidies have been
eliminated, the role of the state in trade has been reduced,
foreign-exchange restrictions have been removed, and
financial controls and rules on foreign investments have been
relaxed," the report said.</p>
<p>But it added that the country is "still a considerable
distance from being an open economy." GATT said that New
Zealand's tariff rates "don't yet appear particularly stable
or predictable," and that marketing boards still "enjoy
considerable monopoly powers in domestic and foreign trade in
agriculture."</p>
