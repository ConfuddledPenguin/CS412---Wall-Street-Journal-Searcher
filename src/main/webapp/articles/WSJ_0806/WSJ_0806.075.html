	<p class="article-leader">World stock markets tumbled last week along with the
Kuwaiti government, and money managers fear that share prices
will continue to drop.
   Behind the world-wide stock decline are fears of an oil
shock that traders and investors believe will accelerate
already rising interest rates in many economies.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"The mood is very bearish, very troubled. People are
looking for direction and can't really find it," said Andrew
Smith, vice chairman and chief investment officer of London &
Bishopsgate International Inc., a New York money-management
firm. "There's always the fear in everybody's mind of a
repeat of the 1973 oil shock," when oil prices quadrupled and
precipitated a major recession.</p>
<p>That fear is plaguing world markets. At the end of the
morning session Monday on the Tokyo Stock Exchange, the
Nikkei index, an average of 225 stocks, stood at 28409.07,
off 1106.69 points, or 3.7%, from its closing level Friday.
"There is great uncertainty about what will happen in Iraq
and to world oil prices," said Mikio Fujino, an institutional
salesman at Nikko Securities Co.</p>
<p>Since Wednesday, the day before Iraqi troops invaded
Kuwait, the Nikkei index had fallen 6.9%; the Frankfurt Stock
Exchange's DAX index of 30 blue chips, 2.7%; the Paris
Bourse's CAC 40 index, 4.6%; and London's Financial
Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index, 2.3%. Over the same
period, the Dow Jones Industrial Average declined 3.1%, 60%
of that drop coming on Friday.</p>
<p>Smaller foreign markets fared no better. Last Thursday and
Friday, Taiwan plunged 11.1%, Spain, 5.1%; Thailand, 3.9%;
Italy, 3.6%, and Hong Kong, 3.2%.</p>
<p>And the worst may be yet to come. Michael Woodward,
investment director at Ivory & Sime PLC in Edinburgh,
Scotland, said, "The whole supertanker that's the investment
world takes time to react to these things." He notes that
when oil prices suddenly fell 35% in late 1985 and early
1986, short-term interest rates hardly budged, and it was a
month before stock markets took off.</p>
<p>But this time, world interest rates have already begun to
climb, reducing the appeal of stocks to investors. The yield
on 10-year U.S. Treasury notes rose to 8.43% Friday from
8.28% on Wednesday. In the same two-day period, equivalent
yields on West German bonds jumped 0.19 percentage point to
8.64% on a compounded semiannual basis; yields on 10-year
British government bonds, or gilts, were up 0.20 percentage
point to 11.55%. And the yield on Japan's benchmark 10-year
government bond climbed to 7.15%, a seven-year high, from
7.02% on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Worse, rates are headed even higher in Japan and Germany,
predicted Nicholas Sargen, an international economist at
Salomon Brothers Inc.</p>
<p>Even before last week's crisis, major world equity markets
were anything but euphoric. Slow growth and poor corporate
earnings hurt the U.S. market -- the world's largest -- while
high inflation, steep interest rates and a stumbling economy
threw a pall over British share prices. Meanwhile, worries
about rising inflation and expectations of higher interest
rates were hurting the West German and Japanese markets.</p>
<p>Now investors must contend with the specter of higher oil
prices. In conquering Kuwait, Iraq gains control of roughly
20% of the world's oil resources and raises fears of a cut in
supplies and higher prices. Taking Saudi Arabia -- Iraqi
units reportedly had been massed near that country's border
-- would boost that figure to about 45%.</p>
<p>"For equity markets, higher oil prices mean inflationary
pressures because they raise the unit costs of production,"
said Mr. Smith of London & Bishopsgate. At the same time,
central banks are expected to battle that inflation with
higher interest rates, which, in turn, raise borrowing costs,
squeeze corporate profits and make fixed-income investments
more attractive.</p>
<p>Salomon Brothers is warning clients that a $5-a-barrel
increase in oil prices will boost consumer prices by one
percentage point in Japan and Germany.</p>
<p>Investors haven't panicked yet. But they don't have much
appetite for buying stocks either. "Fund managers are all
sidelined, basically," said Stephen Wallace, director of
European equities for Barclays de Zoete Wedd Holdings Ltd. in
London. "It's like sitting on a fence with a wind; you can
get blown in either direction," he said.</p>
<p>By contrast, brokers are passing stocks around like hot
potatoes because no one wants to hold stocks in a war. "I
don't want to sit here with 5,000 of, say, Veba AG (a West
German power generation and chemical company); I sell to
Mary, and Mary sells to Tom, Dick and Harry," said Mr.
Wallace. "You can't sit there owning 5,000 to 10,000 shares
and see the price drift off 2%, 3% or whatever."</p>
<p>Confused about oil prices, interest rates and currency
movements, "people don't know how to interpret the situation.
They have been reluctant to use falling prices as a buying
opportunity," said Siegfried Hoecker, chief equity investment
officer for DB Capital Management International G.m.b.H., a
money-management unit of Deutsche Bank AG in Frankfurt.</p>
<p>"Equity markets are trading in a vacuum," said Nicholas
Duphie, senior vice president in charge of European equities
at S.G. Warburg & Co. in New York.</p>
<p>Furthermore, declines are being compounded by the low
trading volume in many overseas markets that were already
thin because of summer. "One order puts the market down
straight away," said Mr. Wallace of Barclays.</p>
<p>There are also signs that traders and investors are
getting more nervous with each day. On Thursday, markets in
the Netherlands, Australia and Norway rose. But on Friday,
the dam broke: Dutch shares fell 2.8%, Australian stocks,
1.8%, and Norwegian shares, 1.6%.</p>
<p>On Thursday, aggressive investors, particularly in France,
were willing to bottom fish. But on Friday, "they didn't want
to buy shares, fearing that today's low would be tomorrow's
high," said Jill Eisner, a vice president at Societe Generale
Securities Corp. in New York. French stocks continued to fall
on Friday even after the Paris exchange officially closed.</p>
<p>Those investors not frozen by fear and events are
maneuvering defensively. To some degree, Ivory & Sime,
primarily an equity manager, has moved into cash and
short-term government securities.</p>
<p>Within world stock markets, "investors are putting tin
hats on," buying oil stocks, food companies and brewery
shares, said Marcus Padley, an equity salesman at UBS
Phillips & Drew Ltd. in London. British stocks that have
bucked the downward trend include British Gas PLC, British
Petroleum Co., ASDA Group PLC, a food and dairy company, and
British Aerospace PLC, a defense company.</p>
<p>Some markets, particularly West Germany's and Japan's,
were already having problems before the Mideast crisis
erupted last week. "East Germany is taking up a lot of the
credit that has been provided {by West Germany} and taking it
up quite quickly," said Mr. Hoecker of DB Capital. "People
think the spending will add to inflation and drive {German}
interest rates back up," he said.</p>
<p>Interest rates in Japan had also begun to climb in
response to inflation fears. Iraq's invasion of Kuwait only
makes a bad situation worse.</p>
<p>"The key economic component for Japan is oil prices," said
Peter Davies, a vice president at Nomura Securities Co. in
New York. The Japanese import nearly all their oil, and about
70% of that from the Persian Gulf. He added, "They have a
rather heavy bet on the Middle East situation." Now, Mr.
Davies said, the Tokyo stock market suffers from "a triple
negative: higher oil prices, a weaker yen and pressure for
higher interest rates."</p>
<p>The Iraqi invasion sent Japanese institutions fleeing to
buy "safe-haven" dollars. That depressed an already weak yen.
At the same time, Japanese and foreign investors have been
selling stock-index futures so heavily, as a hedge against
slipping share prices, that they are pulling down prices in
the Tokyo stock market as well.</p>
<p>Moreover, to cushion losses from sales of poorly
performing stocks, Japanese institutions are also unloading
the shares of healthy companies on which they can realize a
profit, said Yumiko Miura, an institutional saleswoman at
Daiwa Securities Co. in New York. "This magnifies the
negative aspects of the market," she said.</p>
<p>Now some money managers predict the Nikkei index will fall
an additional 8.5% to 12% to 26000 or 27000 points before
stabilizing.</p>
<p>"Fear and uncertainty prevails, certainly more than
greed," said Ms. Miura.</p>

<p>Friday's Market Activity</p>
<p>Tokyo stocks plunged broadly in light trading Friday,
falling back from morning highs in the afternoon on a U.S.
news report that Iraqi troops were approaching the Saudi
Arabian border following their Thursday invasion of Kuwait,
and confusion and nervousness continued to dominate the
market.</p>
<p>The Nikkei index of 225 issues fell 729.42 points to
29515.76 -- below 30000 for the first time since May 1. The
index lost 592.81 points Thursday. First section volume was
estimated at about 430 million shares, up from 374 million
shares traded Thursday. Losers outpaced gainers 861 to 140,
and 111 issues were unchanged. The number of stocks dumped
was relatively small, traders said, noting that prices were
pushed down more severely by waves of selling related to
stock-futures arbitrage.</p>
<p>The Tokyo Stock Price Index of all first section issues,
which lost 31.25 points Thursday, ended off 40.76 at 2174.67.
The second section index, which gained 8.13 points Thursday,
lost 46.94 to 4397.45.</p>
<p>London share prices, battered in another somber session
marked by rumors about more Iraqi military moves, closed
lower, weighed down by the specter of rising inflation and
higher borrowing costs in response to dearer oil prices.
Market watchers said the Financial Times-Stock Exchange
100-share index also was pressured, as the premium between
futures and cash prices collapsed, while others said the
decline in the index below the 2300-point barrier added to
the malaise. The FT-SE 100 closed at 2284.6, down 19.9
points.</p>
<p>The Financial Times 30-share index retreated 18.0 points
to 1793.4. Volume registered a moderate 523.4 million shares,
compared with 561.5 million shares a day earlier.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, share prices closed lower in Frankfurt,
Amsterdam, Paris, Brussels, Zurich, Stockholm, Milan and
Madrid. South African gold stocks closed higher.</p>
<p>Equities finished lower in Sydney, Hong Kong, Singapore,
Taipei, Manila, Wellington and Seoul.</p>
<p>Here are price trends on the world's major stock markets,
as calculated by Morgan Stanley Capital International
Perspective, Geneva. To make them directly comparable, each
index is based on the close of 1969 equaling 100. The
percentage change is since year-end.</p>
