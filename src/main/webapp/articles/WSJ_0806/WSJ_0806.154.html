	<p class="article-leader">Now that the Savings and Loan crisis has reached the
political boiling point with the American people, Members of
Congress are desperately trying to shift the blame away from
themselves and onto someone else. Often the same Members who
are screaming for the Bush administration to "jail the S&L
crooks" were at the center of the disastrous policies of the
past decade.
   The latest pass-the-buck exercise begins today when Ohio
Senator Howard Metzenbaum convenes a hearing on the 1988
purchase of some Texas S&Ls by insurance executive James M.
Fail. Mr. Fail and Robert Thompson, a lobbyist he retained,
are accused of receiving sweetheart treatment from former
thrift regulator Danny Wall. "It's the most abominable
rip-off of the American taxpayer that I've ever experienced,"
thunders Mr. Metzenbaum. Last week, he issued subpoenas
directing Messrs. Thompson and Fail to appear today. Mr.
Thompson points out the Senator's subcommittee on antitrust
policy has zero jurisdiction over S&Ls. He may contest the
subpoena in court and not appear.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>There are legitimate questions raised by the Fail deal,
but we suspect they aren't the ones Senator Metzenbaum wants
answered. There are, however, real questions about the
apparently endless spectacle of sanctimonious Members of this
Congress handing down judgments of other people's behavior
while expecting no criticism of their own.</p>
<p>In probing Mr. Fail, for instance, Senator Metzenbaum can
bring to bear his own knowledge of how to make big money
without investing anything. In 1983, he collected a $250,000
"finder's fee" for making two phone calls to find a buyer for
a Washington hotel. The seller was a contributor to the
Senator's campaigns. After he was accused of using his office
to reap a windfall profit, he returned the money. At the
time, he expressed outrage at calls he be investigated by the
Ethics Committee.</p>
<p>Moreover, Charles Keating, of Keating Five fame, told a
meeting of Journal editors recently that Mr. Metzenbaum came
to his Arizona office to ask for a political contribution.
"He had been told by Senator Cranston that I was a soft touch
for money," Mr. Keating recalls. Senator Alan Cranston, one
of the Keating Five now under investigation by the Senate
Ethics Committee, was given nearly $1 million by Mr. Keating
for voter-registration programs. Mr. Metzenbaum was
interested in setting up similar programs in Ohio before his
1988 re-election race. Employees of Senator Cranston's groups
have since revealed that they were routinely pressured to
register only Democrats.</p>
<p>Mr. Keating said, "I told Metzenbaum we had nothing in
common, but he kept calling me asking for money." Mr. Keating
finally told Mr. Metzenbaum he should ask for money from
Senator Cranston's registration programs, and their talks
ended. Mr. Metzenbaum's press secretary says the Senator has
"no recollection" of meeting Mr. Keating, though she said
"it's possible."</p>
<p>The tactics employed by Senator Metzenbaum's committee
gumshoes also deserve attention. The Washington Post reports
that CNN reporter Brooks Jackson was told by Senator
Metzenbaum's staff that they had made an exclusive deal to
share confidential investigative data with the New York Times
in exchange for an agreement that the story would be held
until the day before a hearing. Brian McTigue, the Metzenbaum
staffer who gave the data to the Times, was fired last year
from Rep. John Dingell's Energy and Commerce Committee for
illegally taping a conversation with a witness.</p>
<p>We'll take Senator Metzenbaum's camera-mugging hearings
more seriously when he matches his zealous pursuit of S&L
"rip-offs" with his own hard-hitting probe into Congress's
financial relationships with Charles Keating and other
benefactors of Capitol Hill.</p>
