	<p class="article-leader">Saddam Hussein's military moves have suddenly made
investors look at oil stocks in a new light.
   The prospect of shrinking supplies from the Middle East
propelled oil shares higher Thursday and Friday morning even
though stock prices generally were collapsing. Although the
oils weakened Friday afternoon on profit-taking, many market
strategists believe more gains lie ahead as oil prices
stabilize at higher levels.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Now that the first indiscriminate surge in oil stocks is
over, analysts are left to ponder which companies will be
helped most by the expected higher prices for crude.</p>
<p>"My oil-price forecast is that oil prices will be whatever
Mr. Hussein says that he wants them to be," says a Friday
market bulletin from Robert A. Brusca, chief economist for
Nikko Securities Co. International.</p>
<p>Iraq's invasion of Kuwait "could lead down 50 different
paths, and 40 or 45 of them mean higher oil prices," says
Stephen A. Smith of Bear Stearns.</p>
<p>"The whole stock market, unfortunately, is going down, and
oil basically is the only game in town," said Kidder Peabody
analyst William Brown in a Wall Street Journal television
interview Friday.</p>
<p>Charles Maxwell of C.J. Lawrence Morgan Grenfell, often
considered the dean of oil analysts, thinks oil prices will
average about $24 a barrel next year, up from about $20 this
year and $19.50 last year.</p>
<p>To Bernard J. Picchi, Salomon Brothers' oil specialist,
companies involved mainly in exploration and production have
the advantage over those that also do a lot of refining and
marketing. For explorers, higher oil prices are a blessing.
For refiners, they're an added cost.</p>
<p>Accordingly, Mr. Picchi's favorites are Oryx Energy and
Louisiana Land & Exploration. Both are
exploration-and-production companies, both are mainly
domestic, and both produce a lot of natural gas.</p>
<p>At the moment, Mr. Picchi notes, natural gas can produce a
given quantity of energy more cheaply than oil. And natural
gas is less polluting. Yet natural gas stocks haven't moved
up as much as oil stocks, partly because much gas use is
seasonal -- for home heating.</p>
<p>After the pure explorers and producers, his next choices
lie in the realm of the big integrated companies -- those
that do refining and marketing of petroleum products, as well
as exploration and production. Mr. Picchi prefers those that
are "more production oriented," such as Atlantic Richfield
and Pennzoil.</p>
<p>In the next tier, he places the large international oils
like Royal Dutch/Shell, Mobil, Exxon, Texaco and British
Petroleum. He says they're too large to grow very fast, and
they "tend to be fairly large refiners." They "will benefit,
but less than the first category," he says.</p>
<p>Mr. Picchi says he'd be least likely to buy smaller
integrated oil companies "that have been mentioned repeatedly
as acquisition candidates" such as Murphy Oil, Amerada Hess,
and Kerr-McGee. In many cases they're "very fine companies,"
he says, but takeover speculation has bid up their prices too
much.</p>
<p>Mr. Maxwell, the industry veteran, sees things
differently. He says people look down their noses at refining
because the business was typically unprofitable in the past.
But that reputation stems from the days when exploration
enjoyed big tax advantages. Back then, it was in the oil
companies' interest to run their business so that the profits
were attributed to the exploration side.</p>
<p>Now the tax code has changed, he says, so this incentive
has vanished. Meanwhile, by his calculations, U.S. refineries
are running at about 95% of their true capacity, which is
often less than the officially stated capacity. Hence, he
doesn't view big refining operations as a drawback.</p>
<p>Mr. Maxwell likes the international oils such as Chevron,
Mobil, Royal Dutch, British Petroleum and Texaco, with Exxon
"slightly behind." He reasons that it's too expensive to find
significant amounts of new oil in the U.S. Oil consumption is
growing fastest in the Far East and Europe, he says, which
should benefit the internationals.</p>
<p>Mr. Maxwell also is fond of oil-service companies such as
Baker Hughes, Schlumberger and Halliburton. However, he
cautions that "these companies have done so well, they are
now a little on the expensive side."</p>
<p>Mr. Smith of Bear Stearns gives a little edge to domestic
producers. "Back in 1979, when oil was getting very
expensive, there was frequently a domestic premium," he
recalls. "I'll give a couple of extra points for having it
{oil} in a secure location."</p>
<p>His three favorites are Atlantic Richfield, Amoco and
Unocal. He, too, favors producers with extensive natural-gas
operations and expects natural gas prices to catch up with
oil. Freak weather last year is one reason gas prices
currently lag, he said. The winter started with the coldest
December in decades, then turned unusually mild, leaving many
users stuck with oversupplies of gas.</p>
<p>Walter Kass, a New York money manager, says he's getting
ready to take a flier on Devon Energy (traded on the American
Stock Exchange). He likes it because it's "all U.S., all
exploration." He plans to buy convertible preferred stock
rather than the common stock.</p>
<p>Mr. Kass already owns one unusual energy play -- Maritrans
Partners, a master limited partnership traded on the Big
Board. Maritrans transports oil with tugboats and barges (its
stock symbol is TUG). Though it recently had an oil spill in
the New York area, Mr. Kass says it responded quickly to
minimize the damage.</p>
<p>Marine transportation of oil is likely to be a growth
area, he says, because environmental concerns mean "you're
not going to see too many more pipelines built."</p>
<p>Of course, not everyone is on the bullish side of energy
stocks. In a report dated July 27, just before the Iraqi
invasion, Sanford C. Bernstein strategist David Eisenberg
wrote that oil service stocks are "20% overvalued" and that
investors should "gradually cash in your winnings here." The
energy sector as a whole should be slightly underweighted,
Mr. Eisenberg wrote. He couldn't be reached for comment
Friday.</p>
<p>Also, some analysts are fretting about the outlook for
companies that specialize in refining, since they will have
to pay more for oil to refine. For that reason, Dean Witter
Reynolds analyst Gene Nowak advised clients Thursday to avoid
Ashland Oil, Sun Co. and Mapco.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>Kuwait's rulers weren't the only royalty deposed by Iraq's
attack last week. By driving up oil stocks and punishing most
others, the Mideast war also helped dethrone General Electric
from the top of the stock market.</p>
<p>GE reigned for just a week as the U.S. company with the
largest market capitalization -- defined as stock price times
the number of shares. It lost $2 billion of market value last
week as the shares slid to 69 3/4 from 72. Its market
capitalization fell to $61.98 billion from $63.98 billion.</p>
<p>International Business Machines, long the U.S. leader in
market capitalization, also fell back to a market
capitalization of $61.98 billion at Friday's closing price of
108 1/8, down from $63.85 billion the week before.</p>
<p>The new leader? Exxon, whose shares rose 3 1/8 last week
to close at 53 1/8, adding $3.9 billion in market value for a
total of $66.3 billion.</p>
