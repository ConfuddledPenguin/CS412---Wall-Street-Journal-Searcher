	<p class="article-leader">PITTSBURGH -- National Intergroup Inc. posted a $281.7
million loss for the fiscal first quarter ended June 30 as
gains in its wholesale drug distribution business failed to
offset expected losses from the sale of non-core operations.
   In the year-earlier quarter, National Intergroup earned
$13 million, or 53 cents a share. Revenue rose 16% to $666.8
million from $577.2 million.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The dismal results are the latest bad news to hit the
company. Last month, National Intergroup lost three board
seats, including one held by Chairman Howard M. Love, in a
proxy battle to dissident shareholder Centaur Partners. While
still representing a minority on a 10-member board, Centaur
Partners wants to liquidate National Intergroup, which has
had seven consecutive years of operating losses.</p>
<p>With the stock market already skittish about the
Iraq-Kuwait situation, the reported loss of $13.01 a share
sent National Intergroup stock tumbling even further. In
composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange Friday,
National Intergroup stock closed at $15.875 a share, down $1
a share.</p>
<p>National Intergroup said earlier that it expected charges
from the sales of its Ben Franklin general merchandise chain
and Permian Partners L.P. oil operations, but it didn't
signal the extent of the write-off. The company created a
$239.5 million reserve to cover anticipated losses on the
sales of those operations, including $30.3 million in good
will relating to the Ben Franklin chain. The company also
recorded charges of $26.7 million to close its Pittsburgh
headquarters and $14.8 million relating to the sale of most
of its interest in National Steel to NKK Corp.</p>
<p>Gregory Drahuschak, an analyst with Butcher & Singer, said
no one expected such large write-offs but added that most
reflect the discontinuation of losing operations and not an
actual cash loss.</p>
<p>The company tried to put its best face forward, noting
that FoxMeyer Drug Co. posted a 40% rise in operating profit
and that National Intergroup should be profitable in the
second quarter. FoxMeyer, which is the only going operation,
earned $10 million on sales of $666.8 million, compared with
last year's $7.2 million on sales of $577.2 million.</p>
<p>"Though the loss is significant, it clears the decks and
allows us to move forward with our plan to focus our
attention and resources on the drug distribution business,"
said Mr. Love. He contended that the sales will "enhance our
ability to reduce debt and pay a special dividend or buy back
stock."</p>
<p>Centaur, which has questioned the company's commitment to
paying shareholder dividends, said it was disappointed in the
size of the write-offs. "We remain committed to a timely sale
of all of the assets of National Intergroup and distribution
of the proceeds to shareholders, as the best means to
maximize shareholder values," Centaur said.</p>
