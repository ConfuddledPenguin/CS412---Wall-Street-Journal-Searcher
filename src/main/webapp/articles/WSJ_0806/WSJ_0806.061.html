	<p class="article-leader">SEOUL -- South Korea's latest moves to ease regulations on
share ownership -- which are designed to stimulate the
sagging stock market -- are expected to prompt takeover
attempts by corporate raiders, according to industry
officials.
   The Korean Securities and Exchange Commission decided last
week to lift a rule prohibiting minor shareholders from
increasing stakes in listed companies to more than 10%.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The securities regulation agency also chose to lift a
restriction on major shareholders' stock purchases, allowing
them to hold as much as 51% stakes, to protect their
management rights.</p>
<p>The government aims to expand new demand and boost a
sluggish market, which has undergone 17 months of
bearishness. The new rules require commission approval for
purchases beyond former limits, but that approval will come
easily, commission officials said.</p>
<p>The new measure makes it easier for corporate raiders to
take over listed firms, says Hong Jin-Ki, an analyst at
Daishin Securities Co. By accumulating stock, or allying with
other shareholders, minor shareholders can increase their
stakes and outweigh major shareholders, he says. On the other
hand, major shareholders will try to enhance their ownership
to protect their management rights, he notes.</p>
<p>The rule was announced Wednesday and went into effect
immediately. Since then, investors have placed heavy emphasis
on small-capital and medium-capital shares, which are easy
targets for takeover attempts.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, small-capital shares with capital of less
than 5 billion won (US$6.9 million) rose 2.4% in their index
value, compared with a 1.8% gain for large-capital shares
with more than 15 billion won of capital.</p>
<p>On Thursday, that difference widened. Small-capital shares
rose a further 1.7% and middle-capital shares 1.2%, while
large-capital shares fell 0.4%.</p>
<p>Major shareholders of smaller firms are buying back shares
to protect management rights, says Kim Chong-Dae, general
manager at Tongyang Securities Co. Mr. Kim doesn't detect any
takeover attempts for small firms currently, but he expects a
lot of such attempts in the near future.</p>
<p>Analysts say the new measure will greatly stimulate
lackluster merger and acquisition activity. While there have
been friendly takeovers in South Korea before, there has
never been a hostile takeover before, partly because of
regulations on shareholdings and partly for cultural reasons,
says a foreign broker.</p>
<p>The average ownership of major shareholders in local
listed firms is estimated at about 25%, down from about 30%
at the time of original listing, Tongyang's Mr. Kim says. If
all major holders were to bring their stakes back to 30%
through stock buy-backs, about 4 trillion won would be
funneled into the stock market, he adds.</p>
