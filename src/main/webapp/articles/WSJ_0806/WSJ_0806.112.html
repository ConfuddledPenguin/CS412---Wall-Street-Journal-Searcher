	<p class="article-leader">Grubb & Ellis Co. said it was trimming planned expense
outlays by $7 million for the rest of 1990 and $11.5 million
next year, reflecting the soft national real estate market.
   The real estate services concern said in San Francisco
that the cuts amount to about 8% of budgeted expenses for the
1990 second half and a 6.4% reduction for next year. Its
plans include the closure or trimming of nine offices,
elimination of 75 staff positions and "major reductions in
travel and advertising."</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"The real estate services industry is in the midst of a
difficult economic period and we need to adapt to changing
market conditions," said Harold A. Ellis Jr., chairman and
chief executive officer. He said the firm was taking the
steps "in response to reductions in revenue expectations due
to softness in real estate markets nationwide."</p>
<p>For the second quarter, Grubb & Ellis reported a net loss
of $1.8 million, or 11 cents a share, compared with profit of
$340,000, or two cents a share, a year earlier. Revenue
declined to $84.6 million from $91.7 million.</p>
