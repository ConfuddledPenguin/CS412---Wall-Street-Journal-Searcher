	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- Fans of old-time aggressive regulation of
corporate mergers celebrated the Bush administration's early
declarations that the antitrust cops were back on the beat.
   In carefully orchestrated speeches, Bush officials have
stressed that the strident pro-merger ideology of the Reagan
era has ended. Justice Department investigations of alleged
pricing conspiracies in the airline industry, among other
businesses, suggest the administration's intention to get
tough -- or at least tougher than its predecessor.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>But free-market rumblings from two influential federal
appeals courts may foreshadow hard times for antitrust
enforcers who back their rhetoric by bringing lawsuits. In
unusually harsh opinions, three-judge panels from the Ninth
Circuit court in San Francisco and the Washington, D.C.,
Circuit court have recently rejected Justice Department
attempts to stop mergers.</p>
<p>Legal scholars observe that Reaganite hostility to the
very idea of merger enforcement has become increasingly
fashionable among sitting federal judges, roughly half of
whom the former president appointed. Judge Alex Kozinski, a
Reagan appointee writing for the Ninth Circuit in a movie
theater-merger case decided in May, said, "The market has its
own fail-safe mechanisms. . . . More fundamentally, in a free
economy the market itself imposes a tough enough discipline
on all market actors, large and small."</p>
<p>Were this true, notes Prof. Stephen Calkins of Wayne State
University Law School, no mergers should ever be challenged
by the government.</p>
<p>Judge Clarence Thomas, a Bush appointee who served in the
Reagan administration, last month scolded senior antitrust
prosecutors as if they were ill-prepared law students.
Writing for a divided D.C. Circuit panel in a merger case
involving a drilling-rig business, Judge Thomas said the
government's basic argument was "devoid of support in the
statute, in the case law and in the government's own merger
guidelines."</p>
<p>James Rill, the Justice Department's antitrust chief,
insists that two defeats don't constitute a trend. "Losing
any cases is losing too many," he says. But "if you are going
to have a strong merger-enforcement program, you are going to
lose some." In the movie theater case, he has asked for a
rehearing before the full Ninth Circuit. He hasn't decided
whether or how to appeal in the D.C. Circuit case.</p>
<p>Mr. Rill acknowledges -- approvingly -- that since the
mid-1970s, judges from the Supreme Court on down have looked
more skeptically at government claims that mergers in
concentrated industries necessarily impair competition. But
he notes that under his leadership, the Justice Department's
Antitrust Division has won many more court cases than it has
lost.</p>
<p>More importantly, Mr. Rill says, the division typically
"wins" without having to go to court at all. In more than a
dozen instances over the past year, companies have dropped or
restructured deals in response to the mere threat of a
government lawsuit, he says. Indeed, private lawyers report
that corporate clients considering mergers are more concerned
today about possible antitrust problems than they have been
since 1981.</p>
<p>But that deterrent effect will fade if it becomes apparent
that calling the government's bluff may result in a courtroom
victory. The Kozinski and Thomas opinions, which upheld
earlier trial court decisions, provide potent ammunition for
future defendants.</p>
<p>Broadly speaking, both opinions rejected the Justice
Department's central contention that mergers eliminating
competitors in an already concentrated market tend to give
the surviving companies the power to raise prices
excessively. Judges Thomas and Kozinski underscored the
government's failure to prove that consumers or companies
doing business with the defendants would suffer as a result
of the challenged mergers.</p>
<p>In reviewing the acquisition of a hard-rock hydraulic
underground drilling rig business, Judge Thomas observed that
buyers of such complicated and expensive machinery are highly
sophisticated. This sophistication, the judge concluded,
ensures that manufacturers will have to scramble to please
buyers, keeping prices reasonable even in a concentrated
market.</p>
<p>Judge Kozinski took every opportunity to praise the
defendant movie-theater acquirer in the Ninth Circuit case as
a hard-driving capitalist who provided good service and
continued to face the prospect of new competitors entering
his market in Las Vegas. Demonstrating his scornful amusement
at the government's case, Judge Kozinski peppered his 25-page
opinion with the names of some 200 movie titles.</p>
<p>"It is a tribute to the state of competition in America,"
he wrote, "that the Antitrust Division of the Department of
Justice has found no worthier target than this paper tiger on
which to expend limited taxpayer resources."</p>
<p>Among the lessons to be drawn from these cases, according
to Prof. Calkins, is that "the government can't afford to
file a lawsuit where customers aren't concerned about the
merger."</p>
<p>The cases discussed were U.S. vs. Baker Hughes Inc. (D.C.
Circ.) and U.S. v. Syufy Enterprises (Ninth Circ.).</p>
