	<p class="article-leader">A Los Angeles federal judge invalidated a novel government
order that would have forced former Columbia Savings & Loan
Association Chief Executive Officer Thomas Spiegel to place
$21 million in escrow before a hearing on charges that he
wasted assets of the insolvent thrift for personal gain.
   Judge Stephen Wilson held that the Office of Thrift
Supervision exceeded its authority when it made the escrow
demand last month as part of an administrative complaint
against Mr. Spiegel. Mr. Spiegel is charged with misapplying
$21 million in thrift funds for a variety of personal uses.
The OTS also is seeking a $5 million civil penalty. The case
is considered the largest single civil matter that thrift
regulators have brought against an individual.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Judge Wilson held that, under relevant federal statutes
passed by Congress, the OTS was limited to taking emergency
action only in cases where there was evidence of ongoing or
future harm to an institution, as opposed to cases in which
it was acting primarily to correct past alleged abuses. Mr.
Spiegel hasn't been an official of the Beverly Hills, Calif.,
thrift since last December, and thus hasn't been in a
position to affect the affairs of the institution, his
attorneys argued. The government had argued that there was a
threat that Mr. Spiegel might move his assets offshore or
otherwise dissipate them.</p>
<p>Judge Wilson also held that the order would have resulted
in an unconstitutional taking of property without a hearing.</p>
<p>Previously, the judge had temporarily barred the
government from enforcing the order, and late Friday he made
his decision permanent. The government could appeal the
ruling. OTS officials couldn't be reached.</p>
<p>Rather than a major turning point in the case, the
decision is more of a public relations blow to government
regulators' recent efforts to assume a tough-cop legal
posture against operators of troubled or failed S&Ls.</p>
<p>Dennis Perluss, Mr. Spiegel's lawyer in Los Angeles, said
he was "delighted" at the ruling. In the past, he said,
thrift regulators have "only been interested in taking
actions before an administrative hearing that were designed
to prevent future injury, such as to remove an officer. What
we had is a much more aggressive and far-reaching action. In
effect, they wanted the judgment to be paid in advance."</p>
<p>Mr. Perluss added, however, that he understood that the
OTS was considering adding charges to its complaint against
Mr. Spiegel. A hearing on all charges is currently scheduled
for Sept. 4 in Los Angeles.</p>
<p>Columbia's insolvency reflects nearly $1 billion in losses
from declining values and losses in junk bonds that Mr.
Spiegel and Columbia purchased, largely from Drexel Burnham
Lambert Inc. and junk-bond chief Michael Milken. Despite the
losses, Columbia hasn't been taken over by regulators,
although a takeover is considered likely. The thrift's new
managers recently agreed to sell the junk-bond portfolio to a
Canadian investor partnership for $3 billion.</p>
