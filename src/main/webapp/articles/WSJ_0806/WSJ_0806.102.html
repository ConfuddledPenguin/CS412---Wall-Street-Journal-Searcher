	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Oppenheimer & Co. will name a new mergers
chief and launch a restructuring group in a bid to beef up
its deal-making presence.
   The securities firm plans to announce today that Managing
Director Edward C. Stanton III will lead its 10-member
mergers-and-acquisition department. It also will name Charles
A. Tulloh III to head a new restructuring group, and J. Brian
McGrath to run the firm's leisure and entertainment group.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Mr. Stanton, 47 years old, fills a void left since early
1989, when former Oppenheimer merger head John Sanzo left for
First Boston Corp. Since 1987, Mr. Stanton has been a
co-general partner at a Houston leveraged buy-out fund; he
earlier had worked as an investment banker at Lehman Brothers
and Blyth Eastman Dillon.</p>
<p>In an interview, he conceded that Oppenheimer "needs more
M&A firepower"; the firm has never been a force in investment
banking. But he said Oppenheimer plans to move slowly. "We
don't want to do anything outlandishly aggressive," he said.</p>
<p>Mr. Stanton expects energy companies, including oil and
gas exploration concerns and electric utilities, to be
acquisition candidates in the coming months. The
financial-services areas, particularly banks and insurance
companies, also will be active, he said.</p>
<p>Oppenheimer has a lot of mergers ground to make up. It has
advised on just 14 deals since January 1989, including six
with a disclosed value that totals just $166 million,
according to Securities Data Co.</p>
<p>However, Mr. Stanton said, "You don't have to be No. 1 to
make a lot of money."</p>
<p>Oppenheimer's investment banking department has a staff of
60; the firm has 2,400 employees, including 600 brokers.</p>
<p>Mr. Tulloh, 44, joins Oppenheimer as a senior vice
president from Mellon Bank in Pittsburgh, where he built and
directed the bank's commercial-credit recovery group. At
Oppenheimer, he will arrange exchange offers, debt
restructurings and private placements, among other things.</p>
<p>Still, some analysts say Oppenheimer is getting into the
restructuring game late; big Wall Street firms have been
jostling to repair the problems at debt-laden companies since
before the collapse of the junk-bond market last fall.</p>
<p>Oppenheimer "wasn't a major reason for the overleveraging
of corporate America," Mr. Stanton said. "Maybe it'll have a
niche in restructuring."</p>
<p>Mr. McGrath, 48, will head the firm's leisure and
entertainment investment-banking group, based in Los Angeles.
Since 1988, Mr. McGrath has been a management consultant to
the entertainment industry; he earlier had been president and
chief executive officer of Coca-Cola's international
entertainment operations and spent 10 years at Viacom
International.</p>
