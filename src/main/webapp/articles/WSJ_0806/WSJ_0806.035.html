	<p class="article-leader">The Italian aerospace group Aeritalia S.p.A., faced with
an uncertain outlook for defense-related sales, is driving to
expand its commuter-aircraft business and develop markets in
other sectors of civilian aviation.
   Following the signing of its first contract with the
Airbus Industrie consortium earlier this year, Rome-based
Aeritalia is negotiating jointly with Aerospatiale S.A. of
France to buy the troubled commuter-plane maker de Havilland
Aircraft of Canada Ltd., a unit of Boeing Co.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The Italian state-owned group also is working with
Aerospatiale on studies for a 100-seat regional jetliner to
complement the smaller ATR-42 and ATR-72 turboprop commuter
planes that the two companies already build in a 50-50 joint
venture, Avions de Transport Regional.</p>
<p>For the moment it is the de Havilland talks that top the
agenda. Seattle-based Boeing bought the company from the
Canadian government for $112 million in 1986 and has since
invested hundreds of millions of dollars in an unsuccessful
attempt to turn it around. Now, Aeritalia and Aerospatiale
have a chance to snap up a major competitor and gain access
to a wider market.</p>
<p>"Today it is certainly important to have a large share of
the market . . . The ATR consortium already has 23% of the
world market, and if we add de Havilland we'll have 45%,"
Fausto Cereti, Aeritalia's managing director, said in an
interview in Rome.</p>
<p>The ATR consortium was set up in 1982, initially to build
the 48-seat, $9.2 million turboprop ATR-42 plane. The
consortium later added a larger version, the 66-seat, $12
million ATR-72. Between them, the two aircraft have won a
total of 435 orders and options from 45 customers, with 185
planes delivered so far.</p>
<p>De Havilland is competing in a similar market with its
three versions of the Dash 8. The two types currently flying
seat as many as 39 and 54 passengers, respectively, while de
Havilland is planning to build a new series seating 65 to 70
people.</p>
<p>"We have an outline accord on the eventual purchase of de
Havilland by Aerospatiale and Aeritalia. But we have to see
whether the conditions are acceptable for the shareholders of
Boeing, Aeritalia and Aerospatiale and the Canadian
government," Mr. Cereti said. News of the talks has provoked
a stormy debate in the Canadian press, with critics
contending the European companies are more interested in
eliminating a competitor than developing the company.</p>
<p>"If we buy de Havilland, we'll see what products to
develop," Mr. Cereti said, refusing to be drawn on specific
plans for the company.</p>
<p>While pursuing the de Havilland acquisition to broaden its
commuter plane sales, the 100-seat regional jet project is
another angle Aeritalia is pursuing to deepen its penetration
of the civilian market.</p>
<p>"The demand is there in the market. There are many
airlines asking us if we can supply a 100-seater plane," Mr.
Cereti said. But he added that the specifics of any eventual
production model would depend on customer requirements.</p>
<p>Aeritalia's interest in acquiring joint control of de
Havilland is part of the group's wider strategy to become a
world market leader, not only in commuter planes but also in
other sectors of civilian aviation, particularly the
refurbishing and maintenance of aircraft and avionics.</p>
<p>Defense-sector sales accounted for nearly 60% of
Aeritalia's 1989 consolidated revenue of 2.4 trillion lire
($2.06 billion). With defense budgets under pressure in Italy
and the West following the disintegration of the communist
regimes, the group is anxious to reduce its reliance on
defense contracts to about 50% of sales within the next
couple of years.</p>
<p>As part of this aim it is about to embark on a major
corporate restructuring, merging with Selenia S.p.A., another
state-owned group in the electronics and aerospace sector.
Both companies are owned by Finmeccanica S.p.A., the
engineering holding company for the giant state industrial
conglomerate Istituto per la Ricostruzione Industriale. But
despite past cooperation, the concerns have until now
operated as separate corporate entities.</p>
<p>"It's the sum of two forces who already work together . .
. It's a question of putting the right label on a bottle of
wine that has already matured," Mr. Cereti said.</p>
<p>But analysts, while recognizing the company's success in
winning contracts in a competitive market, have been somewhat
critical of its overall business performance.</p>
<p>"It's true that Aeritalia, according to what they say, has
had a very good performance in terms of orders, but that
hasn't translated into any reasonable profit," said Gabriele
Muzio, analyst for SBC Stockbroking in London.</p>
<p>Consolidated net profit attributable to the company fell
to L60.4 billion last year from L77 billion in 1988, despite
a rise in orders to L5.89 trillion from L4.89 trillion.</p>
