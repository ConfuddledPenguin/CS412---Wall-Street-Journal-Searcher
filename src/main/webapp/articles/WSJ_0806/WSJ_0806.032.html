	<p class="article-leader">HONG KONG -- A delicate balancing act by Hong Kong's
government has offered the satellite-broadcasting industry a
new lease on life while attempting to allay the concerns of
the territory's cable-television company.
   The government of the British crown colony announced
recently that it will legalize the use of satellite dishes in
Hong Kong but will require communal-dish operators and
satellite broadcasters to first obtain licenses. A ban had
been in effect on the installation and use of satellite
dishes, although it was enforced only loosely.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The new ruling grants individuals the right to own and
operate a satellite dish for personal use, without a license.
Operators of communal dishes, serving more than one viewer,
must apply for a license.</p>
<p>The decision will allow HutchVision, a unit of the Hong
Kong trading company Hutchison Whampoa Ltd., to proceed with
its plans to offer satellite-broadcasting service in Hong
Kong.</p>
<p>At the same time, some observers said, the requirement
that communal-satellite dishes be licensed marked an attempt
to protect Hong Kong Cable Communications, or HKCC, the
consortium that is to operate Hong Kong's first
cable-television service. HutchVision and HKCC have failed to
agree on a broadcast-sharing arrangement.</p>
<p>Officials of HKCC, owned by Wharf (Holdings) Ltd., Sun
Hung Kai Properties Ltd., U S West Inc., Shaw Brothers (Hong
Kong) Ltd. and Coditel S.A., couldn't be reached for comment
on the government's announcement.</p>
<p>HutchVision said it welcomed the government's ruling.
However, an individual close to HutchVision called the
decision far from satisfactory because the requirement that
dishes be licensed in some cases "could be potentially
restrictive and prohibitively expensive for the ordinary
citizen."</p>
<p>Another potential roadblock could be the drafting of the
regulations governing satellite broadcasting, which could
take as long as a year.</p>
<p>Last year, prior to HKCC's winning the cable award, Hong
Kong's Executive Council proposed to legalize the dishes. But
the government, not wishing to jeopardize the pending
cable-franchise agreement, put the proposal aside. The
successful launch of AsiaSat, Asia's first privately owned
satellite, rekindled local interest in developing an Asian
satellite-telecommunications industry.</p>
<p>The plan announced recently, though, goes one step further
than last year's proposal by also requiring that satellite
broadcasters be licensed. By broadening the regulations, a
telecommunications consultant said, the government attempted
to reassure HKCC that it won't allow unchecked competition
from satellite broadcasters.</p>
<p>With a commitment to invest between HK$4 billion and
HK$5.5 billion (US$515 million and US$708 million) in the
cable system, "HKCC might abandon the project if it becomes
economically unfeasible," the consultant said.</p>
<p>Added John Ure, a telecommunications expert and research
fellow at Hong Kong University: "The government is committed
to a cable system. Cable's capacity is much greater than that
of satellites. It would be a pity for Hong Kong to lose the
possibility of getting cable simply because satellite gets to
broadcast first." Even so, he noted that from HKCC's
perspective, the government decision on satellite dishes
"certainly doesn't give {HKCC} what they wanted, which is to
hinder the broadcast of satellite-TV in Hong Kong."</p>
<p>HKCC has said that it has exclusive rights to all the
territory's cable-related services. It argues that to provide
Hong Kong viewers with television broadcasting services via
satellite, as HutchVision plans, requires the partial use of
cable services. Communal-satellite dishes, HKCC says, operate
like mini-cable systems, relaying satellite signals from the
dishes along cables into the homes of independent viewers.</p>
<p>HutchVision has reserved half of the available capacity on
AsiaSat. Last week, it reached an agreement with the
satellite's operator under which HutchVision will pay rent on
the satellite's reserved capacity until year's end. For 1991,
full leasing agreements are to be signed or the space will be
relinquished.</p>
