	<p class="article-leader">The Amalgamated Transit Union has begun negotiating with
Blackstone Group, a New York investment banking firm, on a
plan to buy Greyhound Lines Inc. "We are trying to put a deal
together that would lead to the purchase and reorganization
of Greyhound Lines and get striking drivers back to their
jobs," said Earle Putnam, ATU general counsel.
   The ATU's strike against Greyhound began March 2. On June
4, the company filed for protection from its creditors under
Chapter 11 of the federal bankruptcy code, blaming
strike-related losses for its action.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The involvement of Blackstone Group, with its $800 million
buy-out and investment fund, adds muscle to the union's
recent efforts to wrest control of the ailing unit of
Dallas-based GLI Holding Co. away from Chairman Fred Currey.</p>
<p>Blackstone Group's efforts are being led by one of its
general partners, Richard Ravitch, a turnaround specialist
and former public official who devised a successful bailout
plan for the New York State Urban Development Corporation
during the mid-1970s. Mr. Ravitch helped rebuild the New York
State Metropolitan Transit Authority following a bitter 1980
strike. In 1989, he ran unsuccessfully for mayor of New York
City.</p>
<p>"We are exploring the situation, but before we make a
decision, we have to collect more information," Mr. Ravitch
said through a spokesperson.</p>
<p>Greyhound spokesman George Gravley said the company hadn't
yet heard from Blackstone Group. "They haven't contacted us;
we don't have anything to say," he said. Greyhound officials
have previously said the company is not for sale.</p>
<p>Persons close to the situation said Blackstone Group plans
to ask closely held Greyhound for detailed financial
information in the near future. If the company refuses such
data, the union or Blackstone Group will try to get it
through federal bankrupcty court, union leaders said, adding
that an ATU-Blackstone Group buy-out bid might also be made
through the court in the form of a competing plan of
reorganization to Greyhound creditors.</p>
<p>Under federal bankruptcy court rules, Greyhound maintains
until Oct. 4 the exclusive right to propose a reorganization
plan, but Mr. Putnam said the union might petition the court
to shorten that period.</p>
<p>"We'll do what we have to do to proceed," said Brian M.
Freeman, who has been retained as investment advisor to the
ATU.</p>
<p>In recent weeks, Mr. Freeman and ATU officials have met
with other Greyhound creditors in an effort to gain support
for a union buy-out bid. None have yet agreed to support a
possible ATU-Blackstone Group bid, but those talks continue,
said Mr. Freeman, who recently engineered a proposed union
buy-out of UAL Corp.</p>
<p>Union leaders said any proposal would probably include an
employee stock ownership plan, reinstatement of striking ATU
members that Greyhound has replaced with new hires, and a
settlement of the union's unfair labor practices case pending
against Greyhound.</p>
<p>That case, the result of a complaint filed by the
Milwaukee, Wis., regional office of the National Labor
Relations Board, is set for trial before a federal
administrative law judge in next month. A ruling in the
union's favor could force Greyhound to reinstate striking ATU
members and give them back pay totaling an estimated $3
million per month, or more.</p>
<p>With the prospect of such a huge backpay claim looming,
some Greyhound creditors have said that peace with the ATU is
crucial to Greyhound's successful emergence from Chapter 11.</p>
