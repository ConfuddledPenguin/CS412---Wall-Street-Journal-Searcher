	<p class="article-leader">East Rutherford, N.J. -- In a day of frantic and
often-tortured matings between champion athletes and
products, a heaven-made match turned up here Saturday
afternoon. Harmonious, a dark-brown trotting horse of
imposing mien, won the historic Hambletonian stakes at
Meadowlands Race Track with a stomach full of Maalox.
   Osvaldo Formia, Harmonious's Argentine-born trainer, said
the animal was given several, horse-sized doses of the
antacid after he was found colicky and scratched in his
paddock at White Birch Farm in Allentown, N.J., early
Thursday morning. The wounds apparently were incurred when
Harmonious sought succor by rubbing against the enclosure's
fence.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"We couldn't do much about the scratches, but we could
treat the colic," said Formia, unsolicited. "The Maalox
quieted him right down."</p>
<p>Thus fortified, Harmonious frisked to victory over nine
other three-year-olds in the second division of the
best-of-three-heat race, then repeated the performance an
hour later in what would be the finale. His second-heat
victims included first-division winner Embassy Lobell, who'd
entered the showdown as an even-money favorite to
Harmonious's 6-to-5.</p>
<p>Starting from the No. 2 post position, Harmonious trailed
Embassy Lobell and early-leader Royal Troubador until the
head of the homestretch before high-stepping away to win by a
generous head. That was pretty much the pattern he'd followed
in capturing his earlier go at odds of 8 to 5. It was a
tribute to his constitution, and abdominal well-being, that
he traveled that second mile in 1:54 1/5, a whit faster than
his 1:55 first circle, before the crowd of 32,000.</p>
<p>It's fitting that Maalox was associated with this 65th
Hambletonian, because harness racing has been suffering from
the box-office equivalent of heartburn for some time. U.S.
attendance in the sport slid to about 15.5 million last year
from a peak of 28.1 million in 1975, and while per capita
wagering has increased it hasn't kept total handle from
falling steeply, too.</p>
<p>Harness-racing stalwarts are adamant about the main reason
for the slide. "It's politics," snorts Delvin Miller, a
longtime horse owner, trainer and driver, and track owner.
"Off-track betting is killing us in New York, and so are the
casinos and state lotteries elsewhere. Who needs to go to a
racetrack to bet these days?"</p>
<p>But it also could be that the rural roots of the
horse-and-buggy sport are stretching ever thinner in this
urban age. The Hambletonian, named for a plenipotent, 19th
century sire, is a notable transplant, having been moved to
the huge, glass-enclosed Meadowlands plant across the Hudson
River from New York in 1981 after a 24-year run at the Du
Quoin State Fair in bucolic Southern Illinois. While the move
has boosted the event's purse to Saturday's record $1,346,000
from $293,000 in 1980, there are many who'll tell you it just
ain't the same.</p>
<p>Starting next year, the Hambletonian will be altered in
another basic way. The event has been a multi-heat affair
since its inception in 1926, with the winner having to cross
the finish line first twice before hostilities cease. Next
year, to satisfy television's lust for predictability, it
will be decided in a single, one-mile dash if 10 or fewer
trotters enter.</p>
<p>If there are 11 or more starters, the field will be split
into divisions, with the top handful of finishers from each
qualifying for the final. The winner of that run will be the
champ, whether or not he or she won either of the initial
heats. If Harmonious or Embassy Lobell hadn't won Saturday's
second heat, they would have had to go at it yet again,
head-to-head, risking the rancor of the anti-cruelty lobby.
In 1976, the colt Steve Lobell collapsed from exhaustion
after finally winning the Hambletonian in a fourth heat, and
narrowly survived. That triggered the race's last format
change.</p>
<p>It was a relief that anyone won on Saturday, because
they're still arguing about who took last year's Hambo. That
one's third-heat runoff ended in an unprecedented dead heat
between Probe and Park Avenue Joe. After much travail, in and
out of court, the two were declared co-champs, but the
winner's purse went to Park Avenue Joe's owners because his
2-1-1 placings in the heats were better than Probe's 1-9-1.
Probe's owners, contending that their animal's faster winning
times should prevail, are appealing, legalwise. One would
think they'd get the rules straight after all these years.</p>
<p>Saturday's race provided an interesting twist on that saga
because many of the same humans involved in the Park Avenue
Joe-Probe hassle came down to the wire again. Harmonious is
owned by the Antonacci family, which also owns Probe; Embassy
Lobell's proprietor is Lou Guida, who also owns Joe.</p>
<p>Guida, a multiple Hambletonian winner as are the
Antonaccis, said the purse hassle was "nothing personal, just
a business situation," and Guy, the Antonacci clan head, went
along. But trainer Formia, who'd also guided Probe, demurred.
The dispute "took the fun out" of the 1989 co-title, and it
was nice to win this one outright, he declared.</p>
<p>Among those taking bows for Harmonious's triumph, none was
more deserving than Formia. The lean former groom, a
prospective U.S. citizen, brought Harmonious to the race with
but $15,900 in winnings, the smallest wallet in the field.
But he'd prepped him with six races over the Meadowland strip
and had enlisted as his driver John Campbell, harness
racing's all-time money leader and winner of the race in 1987
and '88.</p>
<p>"He's a big horse, and not pretty, and he was a late
bloomer. The more I raced him, the more I liked him," said
Formia. "It made no sense to travel him. This is where we
wanted him to do well."</p>
<p>"They did a great job in preparing this horse. He kept
improving every race, even though it was against lesser
competition," testified Campbell. At the suggestion that the
Hambo is becoming "his" race, the mustached Canadian did not
bridle. "It's a good race to be lucky," said he.</p>
