	<p class="article-leader">ST. PAUL, Minn. -- Northwest Airlines said it will raise
ticket prices for domestic flights $8 each way starting
Thursday to offset rising jet-fuel prices, prompted by the
Iraqi invasion of Kuwait.
   But other carriers said only that they were studying the
issue. Airlines generally don't raise fares across the board,
if a major competitor balks.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The move by the Northwest Airlines unit of NWA Inc. comes
during a disappointing travel season that has prompted many
airlines to offer unusual discounts. Northwest stressed that
its fuel surcharge isn't a "permanent revision" to its
pricing structure and will be reviewed periodically.</p>
<p>The airline said the surcharge is necessary because its
fuel prices have risen eight cents a gallon since Wednesday
and are expected to increase further. Fuel is an airline's
second-largest expense after labor costs.</p>
