	<p class="article-leader">CAMBRIDGE, Mass. -- Lotus Development Corp., struggling
with slumping earnings, has begun a cost-cutting program that
includes a hiring freeze and layoffs of as many as 40 people.
   The layoffs, while small relative to Lotus's 3,100-member
work force, indicate management's concern about the company's
outlook. In the past, Lotus has occasionally closed small
divisions, but employees were generally absorbed elsewhere by
the fast-growing software producer.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Revenue is growing more slowly than it used to, so
"They're doing everything they can to keep the lid on" costs,
said Richard Sherlund, an analyst with Goldman, Sachs & Co.
But he warned that with growing competition, Lotus will have
to be careful about reducing advertising and marketing
spending. "Market share may be more difficult to hold," he
said.</p>
<p>In national over-the-counter trading Friday, Lotus shares
fell 50 cents to close at $22, amid the market collapse. The
stock, which traded at $34 as recently as July 17, has fallen
steadily since officials warned that earnings are likely to
decline in the current quarter.</p>
<p>By most measures, Lotus isn't overstaffed, analysts said.
Jeffrey Tarter, publisher of SoftLetter, an industry
newsletter based in Watertown, Mass., said Lotus's revenue
per employee last year of $188,000 was above the industry
average of $175,000.</p>
<p>But William Bluestein, an analyst with Forrester Research,
a market research firm in Cambridge, said, "Their cost
structure is out of line, considering they are a mature,
single-product company." Lotus continues to get about
two-thirds of its revenue from its 1-2-3 spreadsheet, despite
repeated efforts to diversify its product line. In the second
quarter, earnings more than doubled to $23.5 million, or 54
cents a share, on revenue of $175.2 million, from a year
earlier.</p>
<p>Robert Schechter, chief financial officer, played down the
significance of the job cuts. He said that through
consolidation and re-evaluation of some positions in the
marketing area, 17 jobs were eliminated. As many as 20
additional people will be fired, but they will be replaced
later by people with different skills, Mr. Schechter said.</p>
<p>In a memo sent to all Lotus managers last month, Mr.
Schechter said that through year end, hiring is frozen, with
a few exceptions, and that any new hires must be approved at
the senior vice presidential level. Even filling vacancies
created by attrition will require approvals, he wrote. Only
senior vice presidents can authorize hiring search firms.
About 10% to 14% of Lotus employees leave annually.</p>
<p>Lotus is trimming in other areas, too. Even purchases of
new personal computers now require special approvals. The
small army of contract programmers that had been working in
the company's spreadsheet division isn't being retained;
their work will be done by current employees. And Lotus aims
to cut travel and entertainment spending 50% in the second
half.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, Lotus will add employees in some areas,
including paid customer support, consulting, and sales and
support of its Notes software product, Mr. Schechter said.
"We continue to see lots of ways to grow this business," he
said.</p>
