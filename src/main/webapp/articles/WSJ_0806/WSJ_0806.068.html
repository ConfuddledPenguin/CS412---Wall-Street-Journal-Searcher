	<p class="article-leader">UNISYS Corp. (Blue Bell, Pa.) -- Standard & Poor's Corp.
said it lowered its ratings on this computer maker's senior
debt to triple-B-minus from triple-B, and subordinated debt
to double-B-plus from triple-B-minus. The rating concern also
downgraded the Unisys Finance unit's senior debt to
triple-B-minus from triple-B. S&P confirmed its double-B-plus
rating on the parent's preferred stock. A total of $5 billion
in debt and preferred is affected. S&P cited sluggish demand
and stiff competition in the mainframe business, and the
difficulty of bringing other computer products to market. It
said Unisys "faces a difficult transitional period" over the
next two years, and raised the prospect of further rating
drops if the company has a weak second half or doesn't reduce
its debt.</p>
