	<p class="article-leader">BOSTON -- Bank of New England Corp.'s report of a
second-quarter loss -- despite a one-time windfall --
increases the odds that it will have to seek new capital and
may be sold outright.
   The bank reported a quarterly loss of $33.3 million, or 49
cents a share, despite one-time gains of $91 million from the
sale of assets and the successful launching of many programs
in its recovery plan. A year earlier, it reported net income
of $37 million, or 52 cents a share.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Moreover, the bank didn't show any improvement in its
precariously low capital ratio.</p>
<p>"We're fighting a great fight," said Lawrence K. Fish,
chairman, who was hired to rescue the bank in March. "The
things we're doing are the right things. But we need time."
He added that the success of the moves depends on "the
economy and factors outside of our control."</p>
<p>In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange
Friday, the bank's common closed at $2.625, unchanged, on
volume of 346,600 shares.</p>
<p>Bank of New England, with $23.07 billion in assets, is one
of the nation's 30 biggest banks. It is trying to survive in
the wake of huge losses caused by helter-skelter expansion
and loosely monitored lending practices during New England's
1980s boom.</p>
<p>One analyst calls Mr. Fish's survival moves -- selling off
assets, improving liquidity and revamping credit policies --
"a case study in how to rescue a bank." But, "in its core
operations, the bank is continuing to lose money," says Don
Kauth, a regional bank analyst with First Albany Corp. "With
their capital levels what they are, they simply can't afford
to lose any more."</p>
<p>The most merciless number on the bank's balance sheet is
nonperforming assets, which climbed from $2.2 billion on Dec.
31 to $2.67 billion at the first quarter's end, and rose $110
million in the second quarter to $2.78 billion. Mr. Fish
termed them "the gorilla on our books."</p>
<p>Nonperforming assets continue to drain bank earnings until
they can be sold off. "You have to take a step back and
realize they still have to pay interest to customers who
deposited all that money. . . . so every interest payment {to
depositors} becomes a loss," says Gerard Cassidy, an analyst
with Tucker Anthony.</p>
<p>Bank officials estimate that carrying the nonperforming
assets costs it $250 million a year. That cost hinders
efforts to improve its meager 1.65% capital ratio, a measure
of bank health that regulators monitor closely.</p>
<p>Last March, federal regulators ordered the bank to boost
its capital ratio to 3% by May 31. Most banks are expected to
have at least a 6% capital ratio.</p>
<p>Bank of New England hasn't been able to meet that
requirement despite a large reduction in assets and a
one-time windfall from sale of its leasing company,
commercial loan offices and custody business in the second
quarter. The bank needs at least $300 million in fresh
capital to meet its capital-ratio requirements.</p>
<p>Analysts speculate that the bank will have to seek
capital, possibly overseas. Mr. Fish confirmed that he
recently went to Japan but declined to elaborate. He added:
"We will do whatever we need to do, as promptly as possible"
to address the capital situation.</p>
<p>Leo R. Breitman, the bank's vice chairman and chief credit
officer, conceded that "we haven't yet found the last bad
loan on our books." The bank is foreclosing on a growing
number of the nonperforming loans. To sell them, the bank has
begun looking to institutional investors and foreign buyers.</p>
<p>One of its largest foreclosed properties, a 1,000-acre
Cape Cod development with a golf course, country club and
luxury homes, has drawn substantial foreign interest, says
Mr. Breitman. "Of course, they want the golf course, but not
the homes," he says, adding: "Residential real estate up here
is tough to sell."</p>
<p>"All real estate in New England is tough to sell," adds
Tucker Anthony's Mr. Cassidy. "Land values are falling,
people are losing jobs and it doesn't look like it will get
better anytime soon."</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Mr. Fish says, the bank is vigorously attacking
the "areas it can control."</p>
<p>The bank's credit policies have tightened markedly under
Mr. Fish and a group of managers he has hired from outside
who meet once a week to handle the bank's 50 largest problem
loans.</p>
<p>Liquidity, as well, has improved. The bank has not tapped
the Federal Reserve for funds in six weeks and doesn't expect
to do so anytime soon. In case of a liquidity problem, the
bank, in a shrewd move, has begun discussions aimed at
becoming a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank system, where
terms for borrowing by banks are somewhat easier. The bank's
improved cash position is largely attributable to its robust
retail banking program, which brought in more than $1 billion
in certificates of deposit in the second quarter.</p>
<p>However, the CDs, some paying almost 9% interest, are
among the highest yielding CDs in the country, says Robert K.
Heady, publisher of Bank Rate Monitor, a North Palm Beach,
Fla., monitoring service.</p>
<p>Such expensive products are squeezing the bank's net
interest margin, which fell 0.23% in the second quarter to
2.31%. Now that liquidity has improved, a priority in the
currrent quarter, according to Mr. Fish, will be to reduce
expenses in the bank's retail and commercial areas, which
will form the core of its future business.</p>
<p>"Commercial loans will continue to be the bank's bread and
butter, especially among midsized companies of between $2
million and $100 million" in revenue, says Mr. Breitman. The
commercial loan portfolio shrunk in the second quarter by
$2.1 billion, largely from the selling off of profitable
communications loans and repayments by clients who have moved
to other banks. But, the bank added about $500 million in new
commercial loans.</p>
<p>While Mr. Fish notes that less than 2% of the bank's
customers have left, many of the defections are among large
commercial accounts and holders of CDs worth $100,000 or
more.</p>
<p>"The fellow we used to work with at the bank left; his
boss left, his boss's boss left and his boss's boss's boss
was fired," says John Bartlett, chief financial officer of
Unifirst Corp., a Woburn, Mass.-based uniform manufacturer
and leaser with about $200 million in annual revenue. Mr.
Bartlett said he pulled the company's $8 million in CDs from
the bank and is now looking to move a $12 million line of
credit as well. "This is a business of continuing
relationships and we really don't know anyone there anymore,"
he added.</p>
<p>The process of shrinking the bank from last year's $31.5
billion in assets to its current $23.1 billion, has meant the
departure of as many as half the original officers corps,
according to estimates by current and former executives.</p>
<p>Among those who remain, morale is generally high, largely
due to Mr. Fish's tireless cheerleading. He says he spends
part of each day calling branch managers and loyal bank
clients with "telephone hugs," and regularly sends employees
baskets of candy and notes of encouragement.</p>
<p>But the bank's uncertain prospects are causing good
feelings to fray even among the faithful.</p>
<p>"We're getting a little tired of Larry saying `This is the
best job he's ever had,'" said one bank manager after a
meeting with Mr. Fish and other top officers last week. "This
is the worst job some of us ever had. Cheerleading is fine,
but, in here, some of us are worried about the future."</p>
