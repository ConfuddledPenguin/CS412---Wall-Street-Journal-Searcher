	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- A silver lining in Iraqi's invasion of
Kuwait could be a boost in the Texas economy caused by a
surge in oil prices.
   But anyone who hoped, as some in Washington did, that a
resurgence in Texas might shrink the costs of the savings and
loan bailout is likely to prove wrong in this case,
economists and others said.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Nearly half the real estate the government seized from
savings and loan associations is in Texas -- in raw land,
office buildings and abandoned homes. The final cost of the
S&L cleanup -- at least $130 billion, plus hundreds of
billions more in interest -- depends largely on how quickly
the government can sell that property, and at what price. The
Texas real estate market is heavily influenced by oil prices.</p>
<p>But even the more optimistic analysts don't believe an
oil-price increase would substantially reduce the costs of
the S&L mess. "To the extent that it sticks, that will help
the asset values of S&L portfolios," said Bernard Weinstein,
an economist at University of North Texas, "but it's not
going to solve the S&L problem."</p>
<p>Officials at the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas met early
Friday to assess regional economic effects of the invasion,
but following the meeting one official said he didn't expect
a big effect on the Texas economy. The Dallas Fed said Texas
is no longer as dependent on energy jobs as it was 10 years
ago. The energy industry represents just 9% of the Texas
economy, compared with 19% in 1981, said Harvey Rosenblum,
chief economist for the Dallas Fed.</p>
<p>Still, both economists said, it will spur jobs. Mr.
Weinstein projects that if oil stays at $24 a barrel, the
Texas economy could get an $8 billion annual boost. That
translates into 64,000 new jobs, Mr. Weinstein said. "It
could be just the tonic Texas needs to avoid slipping into
recession."</p>
<p>But the key question for Texas is whether the prices
remain high. Fluctuating oil prices have taught some hard
lessons to Texas oil men in the past decade, said Paul
Horvitz, an economist at the University of Houston and
formerly a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank of Dallas.</p>
<p>"There's a lot of fear that higher prices won't be
maintained. People are afraid to make the investment in more
production or exploration."</p>
<p>Overall U.S. economic health could more broadly influence
the cost of the bailout. "No one factored in an Iraqi attack
on Kuwait," said Martin Regalia, chief economist for the
National Council of Savings Institutions. "When the economy
is growing so darn slow, we could get a lot of short-term
negative effects of a recession -- marginal institutions
would fail, property prices would fall," which would drive up
the bailout costs.</p>
<p>Moreover, noted Mr. Horvitz, many of the real estate
developments that now are wards of the Resolution Trust
Corp., the S&L bailout agency, were built during the dizzy
1980s boom. "Those were planned when the motto was
$85-a-barrel oil by 1985," he said."Developments feasible at
that price just aren't going to come back when oil is $25."</p>
<p>While the jump in oil prices produced some excited
speculation in Washington, most Texas businessman were
wearily skeptical about another boom driven by Arab oil
states clamping down on production.</p>
<p>That would be "the worst thing that can happen to Texas,"
said Thomas Wageman, president of Sunbelt Savings in Dallas.
"The previous boom was driven by a cartel and it wrecked
Texas. We sure as hell don't need anything else like that
again."</p>
<p>"We're not going back to the thrilling days of yesteryear
and that's probably good," said Mr. Weinstein, the economist.</p>
