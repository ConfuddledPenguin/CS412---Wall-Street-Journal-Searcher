	<p class="article-leader">SEATTLE -- Despite big losses and lower-than-anticipated
TV ratings at the Goodwill Games, Ted Turner said he is
committed to sponsoring the games in 1994 in Leningrad.
   But Mr. Turner, chairman and chief executive officer of
Turner Broadcasting System Inc., acknowledged that the
company's board might veto the idea.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Speaking on the final weekend of the self-styled Olympiad,
Mr. Turner said the 17-day event had scored a rating of about
3.2, meaning the games were watched by 3.2% of the
40-million-or-so households that could receive the
broadcasts.</p>
<p>That's roughly 60% of the viewership that Atlanta-based
Turner Broadcasting had promised to advertisers. This lack of
viewers means the company will have to provide free air time
-- perhaps as much as $18 million worth, according to
executives close to the company -- to make up the difference.</p>
<p>Such "make goods," as the free time is called, could push
Turner Broadcasting's loss on the Seattle games to as much as
$40 million. But Mr. Turner tried to sound upbeat in
assessing the event. "In my view, these games were more
successful" than the 1986 Goodwill Games in Moscow, he said,
citing improved TV viewership and a fivefold increase in
advertising sales.</p>
<p>Looking to 1994, Mr. Turner said he would like to support
a third Goodwill Games in Leningrad. But on the question of
whether Turner Broadcasting's board might have other
thoughts, Mr. Turner said: "It's a possibility. Anything is a
possibility."</p>
<p>Indeed, the games might be able to survive the company's
departure. Nikolai Rusak of the Soviet Union's Goskomsport
athletic authority insisted the games would go on in
Leningrad in 1994, with or without Turner Broadcasting.</p>
