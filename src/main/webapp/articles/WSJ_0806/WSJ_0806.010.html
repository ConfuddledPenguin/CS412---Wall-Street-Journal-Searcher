	<h3>Quarterly Review of Profits: Second Quarter, 1990 --- Companies' Net Income Fell 11%, And More of the Same Is Expected</h3>

	<p class="article-leader">The continued weakness of the economy was reflected in
another poor profits showing in the second quarter. On a
year-to-year basis, it was the fourth consecutive decline,
and analysts see little hope for improvement in the current
quarter.
   In the second quarter, net income of 639 major
corporations fell 11% from a year earlier, a Wall Street
Journal survey finds. This compared with an 18% drop in this
year's first quarter. After-tax earnings on continuing
operations dropped 7% in the second quarter.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Lynn Reaser, vice president and senior economist of First
Interstate Bank of Los Angeles, thinks the only chance for
improved profits is a stronger move toward easier money by
the Federal Reserve. "If that happens we might even get a
modest year-to-year gain in after-tax profits by the fourth
quarter. At the moment, however, earnings are still being
squeezed by rising wage-and-benefit costs."</p>
<p>Analysts at Goldman Sachs, a brokerage firm, see
indications that companies are already bolstering profit
margins, mainly by holding down labor costs through slower
hiring.</p>
<p>In an advance report late last month, the Commerce
Department estimated that the inflation-adjusted gross
national product rose at an annual rate of only 1.2% in the
second quarter. That's below the level most economists had
been predicting for GNP, which is the total value of the
nation's output of goods and services. At last report the 52
economists interviewed monthly by Blue Chip Economic
Indicators, a Sedona, Ariz., newsletter, had been looking for
a 1.8% growth rate in the second quarter.</p>
<p>"Below-average economic growth will hold profits
essentially flat over much of the 1990-92 period," say
economists at the Lexington, Mass., consulting firm of
DRI/McGraw-Hill. "Although no recession is expected soon,
neither is a boom."</p>
<p>Most analysts, however, expect economic growth to begin to
show some improvement late this year and in 1991. The Blue
Chip group at last report was expecting GNP to rise 2.2% next
year, not exactly a roaring upturn but enough to be of some
help to profits.</p>
<p>Among major groups, earnings fell for autos, banks,
thrifts and steel in the second quarter, while oil companies
and the computer industry posted mixed performances.</p>
<p>A weaker U.S. economy, strong Japanese rivals and troubles
overseas combined to batter profits for the Big Three U.S.
auto makers. General Motors, Ford and Chrysler all blamed
weak demand and discounts that averaged about $1,000 a
vehicle for slumping U.S. auto profits. Despite massive
cost-cutting, the Big Three can't simultaneously maintain
earnings growth and charge prices that a soft market will
bear. Meanwhile, Ford and GM had big losses in Brazil, where
economic upheaval is hobbling many manufacturers' operations.</p>
<p>Detroit won't get much relief during the rest of the year.
The Big Three are bargaining with the United Auto Workers
union to replace national contracts that expire Sept. 14. If
talks break down, a strike could cut output and hurt
suppliers, too. Meanwhile, Ford and Chrysler have signaled
plans to widen profit margins by boosting prices. But
analysts say big increases may not stick in a recession-wary
market flooded with competitively priced Japanese cars.</p>
<p>Chrysler faces a special problem. Output of its profitable
minivans will slump this summer as the plants that build the
vehicles close for major retooling.</p>
<p>Bank earnings were weak because of continued high levels
of problem loans, especially for commercial real estate.
Manufacturers Hanover took a $100 million onetime charge for
the elimination of about 1,400 jobs. At several banks,
including J.P. Morgan, strong trading results helped offset
otherwise flat corporate finance activities. A few banks,
including Norwest and Banc One, managed to post healthy gains
in earnings.</p>
<p>Analysts expect banks' nonperforming loans to continue to
rise in the third quarter, keeping up the pressure on
earnings. However, the rate of increase in problem loans is
expected to slow somewhat.</p>
<p>Thrifts were pounded by real estate problems, which
increasingly reflected weakness in California. That's
troubling to many big thrifts, because California has been
the last major real estate market to withstand the localized
real estate slumps plaguing the Southwest, Northeast and
other regions.</p>
<p>CalFed said its loss in large part reflected deterioration
in California markets. HomeFed, after special credit reviews,
added $234 million to its reserve for loan losses in the
second quarter.</p>
<p>Other thrifts avoided the trouble. Great Western boosted
its return on assets to 0.82% from 0.58% a year earlier.
Golden West, bouyed by some of the lowest costs in the
business, saw its return on assets jump to 0.95% from 0.86%.</p>
<p>Steelmakers, faced with higher costs and lower prices and
shipments, saw profits plunge from last year's robust levels.</p>
<p>Nucor, one of the few steelmakers with improved earnings,
had higher shipments on all key products and wasn't squeezed
by new union contracts signed by most major steelmakers last
year. Along with those higher labor costs, Bethlehem Steel
was hampered by scheduled maintenance programs at its prize
Sparrows Point plant, which significantly reduced capacity
and forced it to buy steel from other producers to meet
customer orders. Armco, the only major steelmaker to report a
loss, took about $101 million in unusual charges, including
$56 million relating to a litigation settlement, while Inland
Steel Industries was penalized by start-up costs from a
high-tech steel finishing mill.</p>
<p>Still, steelmakers -- which had expected a soft 1990 --
have been buoyed by recent strength in automotive orders and
the partial realization of price increases.</p>
<p>Oil profits were mixed depending on the strength of
companies' gasoline refining and marketing operations, which
in some cases posted record results. Sharply lower crude
prices reduced exploration and production profits almost
across the board. But those lower prices for oil -- the
feedstock for gasoline -- combined with stable pump prices to
propel big increases in refining earnings. Petrochemical
results declined sharply as a glut continues. Exxon's
year-earlier quarter included an $850 million provision to
clean up the Alaskan oil spill. Mobil had one-time gains and
losses in the 1990 and 1989 quarters; without them earnings
would have declined 18%.</p>
<p>With the surge in oil prices already this quarter, major
oil companies expect to report much stronger results, mostly
reflecting the run-up since the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait.</p>
<p>The computer industry's results in the latest quarter were
again mixed, as competition remained cutthroat. Some
companies also reported slowing demand in parts of Europe,
which would cause big problems, because the European market
has been making up for weakness in U.S. sales for the past
few years.</p>
<p>IBM did better than expected, but, even there, there were
worrying signs. Mainframe sales slowed, and IBM may face
problems starting in the second half as it tries to manage
the transition to a new generation of the big computers.
Digital Equipment reported its first loss because of a $400
million charge related to a plan to cut 5,000 to 6,000 jobs.
It was also one of those companies seeing weakness in Europe.
NCR and Amdahl had strong quarters, but Unisys and
Hewlett-Packard posted lackluster results, and Tandem had
problems in Europe.</p>
<p>Cray's results showed their normal sharp fluctuation,
which reflects the timing of supercomputer sales.</p>
<p>The spotty results are likely to continue for the next
quarter or two, especially if IBM does run into problems on
its mainframes or if the problems in Europe spread to more
computer makers.</p>
<p>Here are the second-quarter profits for various industry
groups and comparisons with the year-earlier quarter. When
individual companies report for three-month periods other
than calendar quarters, the nearest comparable periods are
used. In all the tables, 000s are omitted.</p>

<p>Earnings for most aluminum producers were hurt by slumps
in the automotive and construction markets. Maxxam's
consolidated earnings include forest products and real
estate, and also reflect above-market prices for aluminum
under long-term contracts and increased production from a
Jamaican refinery.</p>
<p>Copper company earnings were generally lower because of a
3%-4% decline in the average spot price of copper. Cyprus
Minerals earnings were also affected by a large write-down
for its coal operations. Magma Copper, however, boosted
profit by increasing output.</p>
<p>Gold prices changed moderately compared with the
year-earlier quarter, but the cost of recovering gold
increased. Newmont Mining slashed costs and increased its
gold output. Net income at Newmont Gold, the company's
primary business unit, rose 35%. Homestake Mining's earnings
increased because of an asset sale.</p>
<p>Lingering overcapacity continued to hurt forest-product
companies. Newsprint and uncoated white paper producers
managed price increases in the quarter, but markets and
prices for linerboard and containerboard weakened. Pulp
prices also declined from a year earlier.</p>
<p>Several companies blamed operational difficulties for poor
earnings. Some analysts believe the cost of raw materials has
peaked. But there are growing worries in the Pacific
Northwest over restrictions brought by the designation of the
spotted owl as a threatened species. Moreover, analysts said
timber sales will begin to reflect the drop in housing starts
as the year proceeds.</p>
<p>Dow Chemical, Quantum, Vista and Carbide were hurt by the
continuing slump in prices for basic plastics and other
commodity chemicals. Dow Chemical's results also reflected
higher manufacturing costs because of prolonged plant
maintenance, a strike in Brazil and power outages. More
diversified companies, such as Du Pont and Monsanto, fared
better, though their sales of agricultural chemicals were
hampered by adverse weather. Du Pont also noted lower demand
in the U.S. for apparel and carpet fibers. Lubrizol benefited
from higher prices for its specialty chemicals. Hercules had
higher interest expenses, and its effective tax rate rose to
49% from 38%. Analysts expect continuing low
commodity-chemical prices this year, given additions in
production capacity.</p>

<p>In the oil field sector, a pickup of more than 20% in U.S.
drilling activity along with steady overseas activity boosted
re sults. The giant equipment and service companies reaped
the benefits of several years of cost-cutting and industry
consolidation. A number of companies also said they were able
to make price increases that stuck. And drilling companies
narrowed their losses as restructuring is paying off. This
sector could show steady improvement if expected increases in
drilling activity materialize.</p>
<p>With prices and volume low for the quarter, natural-gas
pipeline companies felt the pinch. Customers in the Northeast
switched to other fuels, while markets in the Midwest
continue to be overrun with competitors. Those and other
factors combined to hammer Panhandle Eastern, which slashed
its dividend 60% and expects more belt-tightening because of
environmental cleanup costs and adverse regulatory rulings.
That company has tabled a number of expansion projects and
could see a further drop in volume when certain rates to the
Northeast go up in December. Meanwhile, Burlington Resource's
pipeline unit saw a 4% increase in operating profit.</p>
<p>Coal companies posted higher earnings for the quarter
largely from stronger prices and volume. Another reason for
the improvement was that last year's results were hurt by
wildcat strikes staged in support of the United Mine Workers
union against Pittston.</p>

<p>Slow industrial freight shipments pared rail earnings at
Consolidated Rail, Norfolk Southern and Santa Fe Pacific. But
Burlington Northern benefited from strong coal shipments, and
CSX reported improved results at its rail, barge and
container shipping units. Excluding gains of $62 million from
sale of subsidiaries in the 1989 quarter, CSX's earnings from
continuing operations rose 20%.</p>
<p>Trucking-company earnings were hurt by overcapacity and
higher fuel and labor costs. Consolidated Freightways said
losses at its Emery air-freight unit more than offset
earnings improvement at its truck units. A 3% rate increase
implemented in June is expected to boost third-quarter
results for carriers that handle less than full-truckload
shipments.</p>
<p>The slump in second-quarter net at American President, an
ocean, rail and truck transporter, reflected a decline in
international shipment volumes, rate pressures and increased
equipment costs.</p>
<p>The air-freight industry performed about as expected, with
Airborne Freight continuing its torrid growth and Federal
Express still having problems overseas. Airborne, known as
the industry's lowest-cost producer, is still benefiting from
problems at Consolidated Freightways' Emory unit, and may
also be eating into Federal Express's U.S. business. Federal
Express continues to post international losses of millions of
dollars a month, and is facing lower Asian demand and slower
U.S. volume growth as well. Airborne is expected to continue
its heady growth, while there's no end in sight for Federal's
woes.</p>
<p>In transportation equipment, the downturn in the market
for big trucks continued to squeeze profits, and there's no
consensus on when a rebound might start. Navistar sees an 18%
decline in industry shipments of heavy trucks and a 4%
decline in medium trucks for its fiscal year, which ends Oct.
31. Cummins Engine says third-quarter production of heavy
trucks is expected to fall 10% from a year earlier; it
expects a loss for the period. But Eaton, which makes truck
transmissions and axles, sees "indications" the heavy truck
market will improve by year end.</p>
<p>Profit gains continued for heavy machinery, but a steep
decline at giant Caterpillar dragged down overall results.
Brazil's stiff anti-inflation and economic-reform plan was
partly behind the tumbling profit at Caterpillar. Troubles in
Brazil also curbed the profit gain at Clark Equipment. Sales
of Caterpillar's construction equipment slowed in the U.S.
and other industrialized nations. For the full year, the
company expects "substantially lower" profit than in 1989.
While farm-equipment sales for companies such as Deere are
likely to continue robust, there are signs of a slowdown for
other heavy machinery. Clark says "emerging softness in world
markets" could reduce its second-half earnings. Deere is "cau
tious" on the outlook for sales of its construction equipment
in North America.</p>

<p>Housing starts fell again in the second quarter,
particularly in the northeastern U.S., reflecting weakening
demand and a liquidity crunch affecting small builders
brought on by the S&L debacle. In California, where
homebuilding had remained relatively healthy, concern over
anticipated defense cuts has stalled consumer confidence and
started to weigh heavily on new construction. Standard
Pacific and Kaufman & Broad said the weakening California
market contributed to earnings declines. Analysts predict a
continued drop in homebuilding through year end.</p>
<p>Retailers are likely to report mixed results for the July
quarter. But some companies posting higher profits are
expected to show smaller increases than in recent quarters.</p>
<p>Sears Roebuck, which operates on a calendar year, already
reported a 39% decline in net income; but sluggish sales and
higher expenses resulted in a 78% profit plunge at the
company's core U.S. retail business. Analysts expect J.C. Pen
ney to report sharply lower earnings, and Nordstrom and
Dayton Hudson are likely to post slightly lower net. U.S.
Shoe projects a profit decline because of falling sales at
its Lenscrafters stores. Earnings growth is likely to remain
robust at Wal-Mart, Dillard, Limited and Gap. K mart is
expected to show a small increase in profit.</p>
<p>Hotel and casino companies faced continued overcapacity in
the lodging market, as well as new casino competition. Some
hotel operators, including Marriott, Motel 6 and La Quinta
Motor Inns, reported slight to moderate improvement in
operating results. Hilton Hotels experienced mixed results
from its hotels and a sharp drop in operating revenue at one
of its Las Vegas, Nev., casinos. Golden Nugget's large new
Las Vegas casino-resort produced a major improvement in
earnings, while Aztar's operating improvement was
overshadowed by a provision for a legal judgment against the
company. Circus Circus Enterprises' fiscal quarter ended
April 30 didn't include results from its big new casino in
Las Vegas.</p>
<p>Some analysts worry that sluggishness in consumer spending
may rub off on travel and tourism in this quarter.</p>
<p>The restaurant business generally remained soft. Price
discounting at fast-food sites was rampant, intensifying
competition and squeezing profit margins. McDonald's 10%
earnings gain trailed analysts' expectations. The quarter was
brighter for casual sit-down places, such as Shoney's.</p>
<p>Casual sit-down restaurants have benefited from the
narrowing gap in non-promotional menu prices between
midpriced diners and fast-food outlets. For the third
quarter, with the same trends intact, Montgomery Securities
forecasts a 12% increase in McDonald's per-share earnings and
a 44% gain for Shoney's.</p>
<p>Entertainment-industry earnings "are becoming weaker,"
said Harold Vogel, a first vice president at Merrill Lynch &
Co. "The domestic box office is down from a year ago and the
cost of making and releasing films is up." Theme-park
attendance, he said, "has flattened out for the current
quarter." Lisbeth Barron, a vice president of research at
S.G. Warburg Securities, said Time Warner was hurt by
weakness in magazine earnings and flat performance in its
Home Box Office unit. "The record business has slowed
dramatically," she added. Paramount's year-earlier results
include $70.9 million in after-tax income from discontinued
operations.</p>
<p>Demand for outboard engines continued to decline.
"Sluggish demand for boats continues. It's more of the same
for Outboard Marine and Brunswick," said Mr. Vogel.</p>
<p>In the media sector, television networks stood out with
moderate to strong results. CBS was boosted largely by its
telecast of the National Basketball Association playoffs and
championship game, and by a drop in programming cost from a
year earlier. At Capital Cities/ABC, lukewarm results were
due to sluggish advertising sales at its television and radio
stations and to losses on the new baseball contract at its
80%-owned cable channel, ESPN.</p>
<p>Ad demand continued its fall for most newspapers, and that
led to poor results for most newspaper-based media companies.
Gannett, the country's largest newspaper publisher, reported
its first quarterly drop in earnings in more than 22 years.</p>
<p>Although fuel prices moderated somewhat,
weaker-than-expected domestic traffic and select fare wars
depressed airline earnings. Results at AMR's American
Airlines also were hurt by start-up costs for its new service
to Latin America. Midway Airlines' loss reflected continuing
expenses at its new Philadelphia hub. Delta was aided last
year by a strike at its chief competitor on the East Coast,
Eastern Airlines. UAL would have seen its profit fall if it
hadn't been for a one-time gain of $77.3 million from the
sale of aircraft.</p>
<p>Analysts are predicting the third quarter will be even
more disappointing for the airlines than the second quarter
was because of slow traffic and fare discounting. "We were
looking to start to see improvement in the third quarter, but
that's now looking tough," one analyst said.</p>

<p>The food sector's strong showing reflected healthy sales
and lower commodities prices. More abundant soybean and corn
crops helped Archer-Daniels-Midland's results grow
substantially. General Mills benefited from continued good
volume gains of ready-to-eat cereals. Campbell Soup cited
better cost controls in North America and higher profit in
Argentina. Dean Foods, alone in reporting a decline in net
income, actually posted an operating earnings gain, but
year-earlier figures included proceeds from the sale of its
Baskin-Robbins business. Hershey Foods' latest results
include a $35 million gain from sale of a Swedish
confectionery unit. Prudential-Bache Securities food analyst
John McMillin expects many sector companies to report
low-double-digit profit gains for the current quarter.</p>
<p>Food retailers continued to enjoy healthy to
better-than-expected overall gains, thanks to robust sales,
improved margins, better cost controls and lower interest
rates. Analysts cited the greater control that supermarket
companies are exercising in wholesale buying and continued
expansion of upscale specialty departments.</p>
<p>Von's reversed the loss it sustained a year earlier after
absorbing the acquisi tion of Safeway's stores in Southern
California.</p>
<p>From beer to soft drinks to bottling, the big beverage
companies uncorked profit increases. Strong business overseas
more than offset weak sales at home for Coca-Cola. Pepsi's
domestic soft-drink volume growth outpaced Coke's, and
Pepsi's earnings were bolstered by higher sales of snack and
restaurant foods. Coca-Cola Enterprises' net included several
extraordinary items, notably a $55.6 million pretax gain from
the sale of a business. Anheuser-Busch and Adolph Coors
reported higher beer shipments, reflecting strong sales of
new brands.</p>
<p>Personal care companies reported solid earnings.
International sales remained strong, while continued low
materials costs and slight price increases boosted profits.
Neutrogena, a specialty soap and shampoo maker, was the clear
exception; earnings plunged because of increased competition,
swollen inventories and problems with new products.</p>
<p>Profits continued strong for household product concerns,
and profit margins continued to expand, thanks in part to a
long truce in the consumer goods marketing wars. With
international sales healthy, profits got a boost from
favorable currency translations. More of the same is expected
for the current quarter.</p>
<p>Once again, tobacco makers reported large gains, despite
the industry's troubled image. Strong sales overseas and
smaller-than-expected volume decreases in the U.S. are
expected to continue.</p>

<p>Industry "fragmentation" is the watchword in
semiconductors, with Intel enjoying big profit from its
microprocessor monopoly while companies selling more standard
chips, such as Advanced Micro and National, see profit
margins eroded by price competition. Analysts expect Intel to
maintain a fat profit in the current quarter while a seasonal
summer slowdown brings continued sluggishness for other chip
makers and for equipment makers such as Applied Materials,
which still feel lingering effects of last year's chip slump.
Companies expect the profit picture to remain fragmented
until next year, when chip demand is expected to pick up
across the board. National had a $174 million special gain in
the 1989 quarter.</p>
<p>Software makers continued to benefit from strong sales of
desktop computers and the growing appetite for more
sophisticated business software. Lotus Development posted the
biggest profit gain on the strength of broad acceptance of
its newest spreadsheet products. Microsoft's net income was
boosted by rapid growth in Europe and the initial reaction to
its new version of its Windows product. Novell and Oracle
Systems were aided by the continued shift to networked
computing, which puts a premium on the data base and
networking software sold by them.</p>
<p>At American Telephone & Telegraph, a costly credit-card
launch and sluggish equipment sales shaved long-distance
gains and cut profit. Motorola's profit increase was powered
mainly by higher semiconductor and cellular equipment sales.
Communications Satellite inched up after software problems in
its Video Entertainment unit offset gains in its
International and Systems businesses.</p>
<p>Most aerospace companies' results reflected general
weakness in Pentagon contracting. The big loser was General
Dynamics, which took a stunning $500 million in write-offs to
reflect overruns on the Navy's A-12 attack plane program and
the Army's Sincgars radio project. McDonnell Douglas,
co-developer of the A-12, used a different accounting method
and sidestepped any charges. A year earlier, it posted $93
million in write-offs on its C-17 military cargo and KC-10
tanker programs. Northrop's year-before results included a
$150 million loss provision on a classified research
contract.</p>
<p>The outlook is mixed, with commercial aircraft makers and
defense-electronics companies expected to outperform the
field. Peter Aseritis of First Boston says the picture will
become clearer only after the pending military budget is
complete.</p>
<p>Many medical-equipment makers continued to benefit from
dominant positions in specialized and stable markets. In the
biotechnology field, Amgen remained one of the few concerns
that could cultivate a profit, as many companies remained in
the start-up phase.</p>
<p>St. Jude Medical said the latest period's results
reflected continued penetration of its primary heart-valve
market. Stryker has achieved its growth rate by bringing out
such well-received products as hip implants and surgical
tools.</p>
<p>In general, "there is a greater certainty of earnings
growth with health care relative to other industries," said
Leonard Yaffe, an analyst at Montgomery Securities. "Given
the demographics and pricing flexibility, companies can grow
at more predictable rates."</p>

<p>Many insurers saw their property/casualty results shrink.
Pricing continues soft as companies vie for commercial
business. Higher earnings in the group health insurance area
boosted results for several of the multiline insurers. For
life insurance companies, better interest-rate spreads,
expense reduction and a continued decline in policy
cancellations helped improve profitability.</p>
<p>Kemper took $161.1 million in special charges. Cigna said
the poor conditions in the property/casualty market will
constrain its results this year and in 1991. It expects to
take a charge of no more than $65 million as it accelerates
the consolidation of some offices. Aetna benefited from gains
in its group health insurance and its pension and investment
businesses.</p>
<p>Securities firms' profits rebounded a bit from a depressed
first quarter, with Merrill Lynch and Salomon reporting a
modest revival in investment-banking revenue. But
year-to-year profit comparisons were poor because 1989's
second quarter was particularly strong. Despite the rebound
at Merrill and Salomon, investment-banking and underwriting
revenue at most firms stand at six-year lows. Many securities
firms continued to increase the customer assets they manage,
which rake in steady fees.</p>
<p>But even near-record levels in the stock market couldn't
revive sluggish trading, a revival that analysts say is
necessary to jump-start the flagging earnings at many big
firms. This quarter won't be much better for many brokers,
particularly compared with 1989's strong third quarter,
analysts say.</p>

<p>United Telecom's local phone business remained strong, but
profit was hurt by big losses at long-distance unit US
Sprint. At other carriers, regulatory changes and sluggish
regional economies hampered earnings. Profit at Southern New
England Telecommunications slumped on slow growth in its
Connecticut base and a 5% cut in rates. Contel was bruised by
a first-quarter acquisition of some McCaw Cellular
Communications properties. But Centel gained from traffic
growth as well as reduced interest expense.</p>

<p>ITT's net included an after-tax gain of $1.07 a share on
the June sale of 7% of Alcatel N.V. to Compagnie Generale
d'Electricite in Paris. Excluding the gain, ITT's results
were better than expected, said analyst Theresa Gusman of
Salomon Brothers. Most of GE's gains came in such businesses
as aircraft engines, power generation and medical equipment,
where sales cycles are long and where its manufacturing
operations are working off a huge backlog of orders. Textron
cited continued strength in financial services and lower
costs on fixed-price contracts. Teledyne's operating profit
fell from a year earlier in all segments except consumer
products.</p>
