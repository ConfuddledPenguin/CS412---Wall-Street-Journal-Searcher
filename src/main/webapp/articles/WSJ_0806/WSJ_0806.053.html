	<p class="article-leader">CULVER CITY, Calif. -- Grant Tinker's latest show, "WIOU,"
is a one-hour drama about a struggling Midwest TV station
that just can't seem to get anything right.
   The same might have been said about Grant Tinker Gannett,
or GTG Entertainment, the ill-fated joint venture between the
former chairman of the National Broadcasting Co. and Gannett
Co. That three-year partnership was terminated last March
after a series of programming failures, including a costly
syndicated version of the Gannett-owned national newspaper
USA Today, and prime-time series such as "TV 101" and
"Raising Miranda" for CBS and "Baywatch" for NBC. The shows
weren't liked by critics or viewers.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Now, like the fictional TV station that will be depicted
in "WIOU" for CBS Inc.'s network, Mr. Tinker is poised to
begin again, this time without a company handing him a blank
check. He has yet to find another financial partner despite
hiring the investment-banking firm of Furman Selz Mager Dietz
& Birney in January. New backers may well be leery; Gannett
spent more than $40 million in prime-time production costs,
more than another $45 million on "USA Today on TV," $24
million to buy the Culver City studios for the venture and
another $25 million in renovations.</p>
<p>Mr. Tinker insists the need for a new backer "is not that
urgent," and "we're not as desperate as you might think." The
production of "WIOU," which will premiere this fall, is being
financed by Orion Television Entertainment, a unit of Orion
Pictures Corp. "Orion's development season didn't work as
well as they might have hoped, so they're a willing partner,"
says Mr. Tinker. Orion has three series on the 1990-91
network prime-time schedule; the other two are "Lifestories"
on NBC and "Equal Justice" on ABC.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, Mr. Tinker's difficulty in jump-starting his
career as a supplier of TV shows underscores the fickle
nature of the broadcasting business. While he was chairman of
NBC in the early 1980s, Mr. Tinker turned around the
third-place network, focusing on high-quality shows such as
"Cheers" and "Hill Street Blues." Before joining NBC, Mr.
Tinker had built one of the most respected small programming
suppliers, MTM Entertainment, which produced "The Mary Tyler
Moore Show" and "The Bob Newhart Show."</p>
<p>With such past successes under his belt, Mr. Tinker seemed
like a sure bet for Gannett, which had been anxious to enter
the television-production business. But three of Mr. Tinker's
first offerings never made it past their initial production
orders from CBS, and NBC canceled "Baywatch" after one
season. Other projects, including a situation comedy about
two bakers and another about an alien visiting Earth, didn't
make it past the pilots.</p>
<p>In part, Mr. Tinker appears to be a victim of changing
tastes and expectations among viewers, who have come to
expect the unexpected, whether it's the oddball nature of
"Twin Peaks," or the off-kilter animated family, "The
Simpsons." So, Mr. Tinker is eschewing his trademark
touchy-feely situation comedies, and betting instead on a
hard-edged office drama, the first project of the new GTG --
which no longer stands for Grant Tinker Gannett, but now
conveniently stands for Grant Tinker Group. Notes Mr. Tinker,
"It saves on new stationery and business cards."</p>
<p>Mr. Tinker, 64 years old and looking fit, trim and
relaxed, says he doesn't quite understand all the attention
placed on his start-up attempts. "You get tired of people
taking hits on you for things that didn't work," he says
evenly. "Sure, I'm disappointed the Gannett venture turned
out as it did. It was a disappointment. But it takes a while
to get up to speed."</p>
<p>Other network bosses have tried to make the transition
into programming with mixed results, and success often takes
years. Fred Silverman, Mr. Tinker's predecessor at NBC,
failed as an independent producer for four years in the early
1980's, but finally struck pay dirt with a
made-for-television film based on the vintage TV character
Perry Mason. He is now one of the most successful independent
producers for television with four one-hour dramas,
"Matlock," "Heat of the Night," "Father Dowling Mysteries"
and "Jake and the Fatman," spread over the three major
broadcast networks. He also has an animated series, "The
Pigsburg Pigs," for News Corp.'s Fox Broadcasting Co.'s
Saturday morning lineup this fall.</p>
<p>"Grant Tinker has nothing to prove to anybody," says Mr.
Silverman. "I had huge flops when I first started." He cited
as examples "Thicke of the Night," a syndicated talk show
with Alan Thicke that disappeared shortly after its premiere,
and a situation comedy, "We Got It Made." "That failed
twice," he says. "Once on network, once in syndication. In
television production, you can be a hero one day and a bum
the next day."</p>
<p>But Mr. Tinker's snail's pace surprises even some
supporters. "I would have expected more Grant Tinker shows on
the air by now," says Warren Littlefield, president of NBC
Entertainment. "Grant's the first to admit he's made
mistakes, and he's certainly someone I'd bet on for future
success."</p>
<p>Mr. Tinker has hired some younger executives, notably the
creators of "WIOU," Kathryn Pratt, 38, and John Eisendrath,
31, both novices to prime-time television. Both, however, are
veterans of TV newsrooms, having worked at WBBM, the
CBS-owned station in Chicago, where Ms. Pratt was an on-air
health reporter and Mr. Eisendrath was a writer-producer.
They joined GTG and worked as story editors on "TV 101,"
which depicted a high school TV-production class.</p>
<p>"They're writing about what they know about," says Mr.
Tinker. "We're going back to what we did at MTM. We always
believed in letting writers do what they want to do."</p>
<p>Initial reaction to "WIOU" is positive. Tom Shales, the
Washington Post's influential TV critic, wrote that the show
"is certain to restore luster to" Mr. Tinker. He described
"WIOU" as a "high-gloss, quality show with a fresh, flashy
cast . . . a snappy, crackling, richly entertaining hour in
the tradition of `L.A. Law.'"</p>
<p>Mr. Tinker is creating and producing "WIOU" even though,
he says, "doing dramatic shows for TV isn't much of a
business right now." One-hour dramas aren't selling well in
the syndicated market, as opposed to half-hour comedies. It
is in syndication where production companies make their
money. Studios sell their shows to networks for less money
than it costs to produce them in the hopes of making a
financial killing in syndication.</p>
<p>Sitting with his feet up on a coffee table, shoes off
revealing pale pink socks, Mr. Tinker says, "You know, it's
funny. At MTM, we had four, five shows going at once. Here,
we have only one." But he adds, "that's how I want it now.
Slowly start over. First get one on the air and have it
stick, then another, and then another. We'll be fine."</p>
