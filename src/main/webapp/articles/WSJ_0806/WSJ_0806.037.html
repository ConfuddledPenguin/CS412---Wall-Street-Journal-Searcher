	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- The Department of Health and Human Services
proposed a schedule of basic fees ranging as high as $2,870
to be paid by medical laboratories to cover the cost of new
federal inspection.
   Even labs that are exempt from regulation would have to
pay $156 every two years.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Under a 1988 law designed to improve the accuracy of
clinical tests, all laboratories, including those in doctors'
offices, must be certified as meeting new federal standards
in order to receive payments from Medicare and Medicaid.
These federal health programs for the elderly and the poor
pay about 40% of the nation's clinical lab costs.</p>
<p>The law requires that the government charge fees high
enough to pay for the cost of the inspection and
certification program. It will cover more than 300,000 labs,
a huge expansion of current Medicare regulations that cover
some 12,000 labs.</p>
<p>The American Medical Association and other groups have
complained that regulations that HHS proposed in May to carry
out the law are too costly and complex. The large volume of
comments the department has received on the May proposals
could delay the start of the program.</p>
<p>Many labs will be inspected every two years, although labs
that perform only simple, low-risk tests, such as urine
pregnancy tests, will be exempt from regulation. Under the
fee proposal, however, they would still have to pay $156
every two years to maintain their certificate of waiver. All
other labs would have to pay a one-time fee of $261 for a
provisional certificate of compliance.</p>
<p>When regulated labs are inspected they would then pay a
fee ranging from $840 to $2,870, depending on their size. The
inspection fees would be paid every two years. The
department's Health Care Financing Administration also
proposed fees for follow-up investigations, if necessary, and
for hearings if sanctions are imposed.</p>
<p>The federal government would pass most of the fees on to
the state agencies that will perform inspections. A separate
set of fees would cover inspections performed by professional
accreditation groups rather than state agencies.</p>
<p>"Patients demand and deserve accurate, high-quality
medical laboratory work," HHS Secretary Louis Sullivan said.
"The fees will support our system to assure that these
requirements are met." The department is allowing 60 days for
comment on the proposed fee schedule before deciding on its
final form.</p>
