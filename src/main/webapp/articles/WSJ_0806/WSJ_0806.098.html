	<p class="article-leader">Real estate investor Martin J. Raynes agreed on Friday to
sell a real estate company that manages $3.5 billion in New
York residential properties to the Macklowe Organization, a
New York real estate development, construction and hotel
management company.
   The move capped a week of restructuring that also cost Mr.
Raynes his general partnership in a massive Manhattan
cooperative conversion project. As a specialist in apartment
conversions, Mr. Raynes built a residential real estate
empire in the 1980s.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Neither party disclosed how much Macklowe paid for the
operation, which manages 11,300 cooperative apartments in New
York City. Macklowe's executive vice president, Kent Swig,
said the cash transaction would be financed by the Macklowe
company.</p>
<p>Mr. Swig said that his company had been "looking to go
into third-party management for some time now." He said,
"Under the present contracts, it's not a tremendously
profitable operation." But he predicted that co-op boards
would be willing to pay more for improved services under
future contracts.</p>
<p>Earlier in the week, Mr. Raynes was forced to restructure
his debt with Chase Manhattan Bank in connection with the
troubled Lincoln Towers cooperative conversion project in
Manhattan. In exchange for refinancing a $5.5 million
personal loan guarantee that Mr. Raynes failed to meet, Chase
required him to cede control over the 6,200-apartment
conversion project to his two partners in the deal, Mendik
Co., a large New York property owner, and the Equitable Life
Assurance Society of the United States.</p>
<p>The Lincoln Towers project was the largest in a string of
acquisitions by Mr. Raynes that he planned to convert into
cooperatives and sell to investors as tax shelters. The 1986
Tax Reform Act, however, eliminated the tax-shelter incentive
for investors to buy co-ops occupied by renters. The
subsequent collapse of real estate prices saddled Mr. Raynes
with maintenance obligations for many apartments still
occupied by renters. Earlier this year, his company, M.J.
Raynes Inc., also lost control over 1,900 apartments on the
Upper East Side.</p>
<p>Other real estate developers suggested that Mr. Raynes's
cash squeeze forced him to sell his co-op management business
last week.</p>
<p>But a spokeswoman for Mr. Raynes said the sale was not
connected to the debt restructuring. She characterized the
sale as part of the "winding down of his entire apartment
conversion business." She described the managment business as
only "marginally profitable."</p>
<p>The sale, she said, would leave Mr. Raynes with a small
real estate company that would focus on the massive Hunter's
Point mixed-use project in Queens, in which Mr. Raynes is an
investor, as well as on marketing for other developers.</p>
