	<p class="article-leader">FRAMINGHAM, Mass. -- Perini Investment Properties Inc.
said it suspended its dividend and announced a decline in
second-quarter cash flow to three cents a share from 23 cents
in the year-ago period.
   The real-estate investment trust blamed the decline on a
drop in distributions from joint ventures, which it called
"largely a timing item," increased interest payments in the
quarter and a decline in cash flow from certain operating
properties.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The company said it expects these conditions to affect
operating cash flow for the remainder of the year. But it
said that certain planned transactions "could significantly
improve" results.</p>
<p>In a statement, the company said it elected to suspend the
dividend in keeping with the board's policy of paying out 50%
to 60% of current cash flow. But the statement said the board
reaffirmed its belief that the net current per-share value of
the company's assets is "substantially in excess" of the
current share price.</p>
