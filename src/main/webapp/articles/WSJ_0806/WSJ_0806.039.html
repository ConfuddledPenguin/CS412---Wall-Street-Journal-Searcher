	<p class="article-leader">Randall D. Hubbard, a horse-racing enthusiast and chairman
of AFG Industries Inc., acquired 9.9% stakes in two companies
that own and operate the Hollywood Park race track in
Inglewood, Calif., and said he may seek their control.
   Hollywood Park Realty Enterprises Inc. owns the
thoroughbred race track and 347 acres of surrounding land
roughly five miles east of the Los Angeles International
Airport. Hollywood Park Operating Co. operates the track.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>In national over-the-counter trading Friday, the
companies' shares, which are paired for trading, rose 75
cents to $30.</p>
<p>Mr. Hubbard said that "if you took a survey of patrons and
employees I think you'd find a lot of dissatisfaction with
the park. . . . I think the park can be brought back to being
one of the premier tracks in the country."</p>
<p>Mr. Hubbard said he wants board representation initially,
but that he hasn't ruled out a proxy contest. "I haven't seen
their business plan. We're willing to listen. If we're
satisfied, then representation on the board would be fine."</p>
<p>Hollywood Park Realty's board has seven members and
Hollywood Park Operating's board has 11 members.</p>
<p>In a statement, Hollywood Park said "it makes no sense to
turn control of the company over to someone with no
experience managing a major thoroughbred race track." Mr.
Hubbard, however, owns Ruidoso Downs in Ruidoso, N.M.,
Woodlands Race Track in Kansas City, and is a partner in the
Los Alamitos race track, which Hollywood Park sold last year.</p>
<p>Hollywood Park has reported three consecutive years of
losses, stemming in part from its disastrous attempt to
expand into real estate development with the purchase of the
Los Alamitos track and adjacent land in Cypress, Calif.,
several years ago. Last year, the Hollywood Park companies
had a combined loss of about $11 million, compared with
losses of $10 million in 1988 and $6.3 million in 1987.</p>
<p>Hollywood Park management "drained all the cash out of the
company" to pay the interest on the loan used to acquire Los
Alamitos, said Kenneth Campbell, editor of Realty Stock
Review, a Montale, N.J., investment newsletter. Development
was blocked by a zoning dispute and Hollywood Park finally
sold Los Alamitos last year to restore Hollywood Park's
financial stability.</p>
<p>Hollywood Park said second-quarter profit rose 87% and
that recently implemented initiatives promise future profits.
In June, the companies paid their first dividend on common
stock in nearly three years.</p>
<p>The initiatives include experimental night races and an
expanded program to simulcast races at other race tracks and
legal betting parlors, said a spokesman for the companies.
The track has undergone a major renovation in recent years
and was the site of the national Breeder's Cup race in 1984
and 1987, he said.</p>
<p>In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission,
Mr. Hubbard said he acquired 391,882 paired shares of
Hollywood Park Realty and Hollywood Park Operating, including
271,983 shares bought in the open market from June 19 to July
31 for $26.50 to $30.52 each.</p>
<p>Mr. Hubbard may have an ally in Denver investor Thomas W.
Gamel, who owns a 5.6% stake. Last year, Mr. Gamel threatened
a proxy fight and called for the ouster of Marjorie L.
Everett, chairman and chief executive officer of Hollywood
Park Operating. After he was offered a board seat, Mr. Gamel
withdrew his rival slate and agreed not to acquire more stock
as long as he is a director.</p>
<p>Mr. Gamel declined to comment on Mr. Hubbard's actions.
Mr. Gamel, Mr. Hubbard and a third investor offered to buy
Hollywood Park in 1986 for about $133 million, or $35 a
share. The offer was rejected by the board.</p>
<p>Last month, a Beverly Hills, Calif., partnership headed by
Harry Ornest increased its stake to 9.9%. Mr. Ornest is an
executive with Hollywood Park Realty.</p>
<p>At Dec. 31, according to an SEC filing, Mrs. Everett held
an 11.1% stake in the realty company and a 6.2% stake in the
operating company; other directors who own paired shares
include investor and former talk-show host Merv Griffin,
1.3%, and investor Marvin Davis, 4.8%. Mr. Davis resigned as
a director in May.</p>
<p>Two years ago, Mr. Hubbard led an investor group that took
AFG Industries private and moved the glassmaking concern to
Fort Worth, Texas, from Irvine, Calif. He also was involved
in an unsuccessful bid by AFG and other partners in 1986 for
Lear Siegler Inc. The aerospace and industrial concern later
was taken private by Forstmann Little & Co. in a $2.1 million
leveraged buy-out.</p>
