	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Stocks took a hard fall Friday. But the Dow
Jones Industrial Average remains above 2800, and that's still
too high, many strategists say.
   Far more than a mere correction, Friday's spasmodic
sell-off in stocks was the first significant re-evaluation of
stock prices since October 1989. The ebullient assumptions of
a "soft landing" -- a slowly growing economy with moderating
inflation -- seemed dashed.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Now the interrogation begins: Investors will review every
stock in their portfolios and ask if it's worth the risk of
owning.</p>
<p>"I am going to be rigorous," says James Craig, manager of
the $1.2 billion Janus Fund. "Whether it's Barbie Dolls with
Mattel or TV revenue at Capital Cities/ABC, we will
re-evaluate everything."</p>
<p>Because of last week's events, he adds, "my complacency
with a rocking-along slow growth has been called into
question. And my complacency with low inflation has been
called into question."</p>
<p>For three weeks, the caution flag has been waving over the
stock market. Dozens of companies delivered surprisingly soft
second-quarter earnings, and gave analysts no cheer about the
second half of the year. Recent economic reports, including
the one Friday showing unemployment rose in July, point to
weakening growth.</p>
<p>But this message went unheeded by many stock investors.
After last year's 31.7% gain in Standard & Poor's 500-stock
index, most money managers were more inclined to take the
risk of racing with the market than to drop out and preserve
their capital. Investors gave into what Henry Van der Eb,
manager of the Mathers Fund, calls "seductive
rationalizations."</p>
<p>But today the naysayers are standing on the high ground,
and they foresee even lower stock prices.</p>
<p>"We've gone from, `Don't worry, be happy,' to a more
realistic interpretation" of stocks' worth, says Abby Joseph
Cohen, the chief strategist at Barclays de Zoete Wedd. The
first hammer blow of this shift in perception could hit the
market this week as investors re-evaluate both earnings
estimates and the multiple of per-share profits that stock
prices should properly command.</p>
<p>The S&P index closed Friday at a price 15.91 times the 500
companies' aggregate earnings over the past year. That
price/earnings ratio is still too high, says Carmine Grigoli,
chief strategist at First Boston. "Pricing the market at 16
times earnings is a ridiculous valuation" given the more
immediate risks of a recession now, he says. A more
reasonable valuation would be 13, in his opinion, and to get
there stocks would have to fall about 13% from current
levels.</p>
<p>Ms. Cohen doesn't think investors are prepared for a
declining stock market. "People have got it into their heads
that bear markets are over very quickly," she says, like the
1987 crash. But back then the economy was strong, while now
it is limping at a near-recessionary pace and an inflation
shock is threatened by higher oil prices. "We are likely to
see a gradual erosion" in stock prices over several months,
she says.</p>
<p>Most large institutional investors have to be at least
partially invested in stocks, in good times and bad. The
marginal buyers, who can have a big impact on stock prices,
tend to be the "asset allocators," who have the flexibility
to dart among stocks, bonds, and cash, and the millions of
small investors. One sure sign that a lengthy correction is
under way would be if either group bailed out of stocks to
any significant degree.</p>
<p>So far there's no evidence of such moves, although as the
stock market fell on Friday mutual fund companies were
swamped with telephone calls. Early Friday afternoon,
Vanguard Group called up its "Swiss Army," a band of its
money market fund managers, company lawyers and accountants
who are drafted to help handle customers' calls during busy
periods.</p>
<p>"Anybody who can answer the phone is doing so," reported a
spokesman for Twentieth Century Investors, where the call
volume on Friday was close to double its normal level.
"Whenever you have this sort of day, all kinds of {investors}
come out of the woodwork."</p>
<p>At Baltimore's T. Rowe Price Associates, the call volume
was running over 25% above normal. Many investors switched
out of stock funds and into money market funds.</p>
<p>But some investors took the Kuwait crisis as a buying
opportunity. The T. Rowe Price New Era Fund, a natural
resource stock fund heavy in precious metals and energy
shares, enjoyed strong sales on Friday.</p>
<p>At Financial Programs in Denver, investors switched out of
the fund group's two money market funds and into Financial
Strategic Energy Portfolio. "That tells me that since 1987
people have become a lot shrewder and aren't so quick to
panic," says a spokesman for Financial Programs.</p>
<p>As for asset allocators, these investors have generally
increased their stock investments through the summer, says
James Carmack, a consultant who tracks them. He says he
talked to one such investor Friday who decided to remain
fully invested in stocks.</p>
<p>Such investors don't suddenly change their minds about
everything, which is why bear markets don't strike like
lightning. Prolonged declines in stock prices typically
consist of slow capitulation by one investor after another.</p>
<p>Or it could be that small investors and asset allocators
are looking way beyond today's bad news. Jack McCarthy,
manager of the $3.6 billion Affiliated Fund says there is a
case to be made for higher stock prices. Certainly a
correction is taking place, he acknowledges, and he even
expects a six-month recession in this year's second half.</p>
<p>But just as investors are giving up on stocks, it might be
time to buy. Mr. McCarthy says weak economic growth will
prompt the Federal Reserve to pump money into the economy,
"and the stock market will go up." Meanwhile, rising
unemployment should moderate inflation concerns.</p>
<p>Therefore, he concludes, "We are not in a bear market."</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>Friday Market Activity</p>
<p>Stock prices plunged in a torrent of selling sparked by
nervousness over Iraq's military actions and evidence that
the U.S. economy may be heading for a recession.</p>
<p>But the market took comfort in a Soviet statement that
Iraq would soon withdraw from Kuwait, and prices finished
well above their session lows.</p>
<p>After being down more than 120 points, the Dow Jones
Industrial Average finished with a loss of 54.95 at 2809.65.
That was the industrials' lowest close since May 11.</p>
<p>Market players dumped stocks across the board, traders
said. Oil issues, which shot up on news of the Iraqi
invasion, ran into selling even though oil prices continued
climbing.</p>
<p>Declining issues routed advancers on the New York Stock
Exchange by about 1,457 to 264. Big Board trading swelled to
292,360,000 million shares, the busiest since October's
"mini-crash."</p>
<p>For the week, the Dow Jones industrials fell 88.86 points,
or 3.1%, the second largest weekly point loss this year.
Standard & Poor's 500-stock index lost 2.4%, the New York
Stock Exchange Composite Index dropped 2.3% and the Dow Jones
Equity Market Index fell 2.6%.</p>
<p>Concerns about recession surfaced in the market after the
July employment report proved considerably weaker than
anticipated. And reports that Iraq was amassing troops near
the Saudi Arabian border also sent shock waves through the
market, traders said.</p>
<p>The Big Board's new restrictions on program trading, which
require index-arbitrage traders to wait for stock prices to
rise from previous trades before executing the stock side of
their transactions, went into effect for the first time at
9:53 a.m. EDT, after the industrials showed a loss of 50
points. This "circuit breaker" mechanism was approved last
month by the Securities and Exchange Commission.</p>
<p>Although traders said index-arbitrage selling was a factor
in the market's downturn, the Big Board curbs "indicated that
the index arbs couldn't be selling aggressively," said
Christopher Pedersen, head of trading at Twenty-First
Securities.</p>
<p>Another "circuit breaker" took effect in the afternoon
when September futures on the S&P 500 index showed a loss of
12 points. Starting at 1:19 p.m. EDT, a special Big Board
computer file known as the "sidecar" handled program trading
orders in the underlying stocks for a five-minute period.</p>
<p>The rally in oil stocks faltered. Exxon added 1/8 to 53
3/8 in volume of 3.3 million shares, while USX, which owns
Marathon Oil, closed up 1/4 at 34 7/8 and was the Big Board's
most active issue with 5.1 million shares changing hands.</p>
<p>But Chevron skidded 1 5/8 to 78 3/4; Texaco fell 1 1/4 to
64 5/8; Mobil eased 3/8 to 66 7/8; Amoco dropped 3/4 to 57
1/2; and Unocal went down 7/8 to 32 3/8. Among oil services
issues, Baker Hughes slid 1 to 32 3/8; Schlumberger dropped 1
1/4 to 67 1/2; Halliburton eased 1 5/8 to 55 3/4; and
McDermott International lost 2 1/2 to 32.</p>
<p>Raytheon soared 3 1/8 to 63 7/8. Analysts told The Wall
Street Journal that the company is either planning or
proceeding with sales of its Patriot defense missile system
to Saudi Arabia, Israel and Italy.</p>
<p>General Dynamics, which is selling tanks to Saudi Arabia,
rose 3/4 to 29. Other defense stocks also bucked the market's
fall: Lockheed rose 3/8 to 28 3/8; McDonnell Douglas went up
1/2 to 44 1/2; Northrop climbed 1/2 to 15 1/8, and E-Systems
rose 5/8 to 27 1/2.</p>
<p>Boise Cascade jumped 4 7/8 to 36 3/8 amid rumors that the
company may receive a takeover offer. Prices ranging from $50
to $70 a share were cited in the speculation, according to
Dow Jones Professional Investor Report. The company and
International Paper, a rumored suitor, both declined comment;
International Paper advanced 1 5/8 to 58 3/8.</p>
<p>Selected regional bank stocks also showed strength. Banc
One gained 1 to 27 3/4; Signet Banking rose 1 5/8 to 16 1/8
and Bank of Boston added 5/8 to 10 3/4.</p>
<p>The American Stock Exchange Market Value Index fell 5.52
to 346.63, bringing its loss for the week to 2.5%. Volume
Friday totaled 26,650,000.</p>
<p>Put warrants on the Nikkei average of 225 Japanese stocks
rose sharply, indicating that market players expect the Tokyo
stock market's plunge in the wake of the Iraq-Kuwait conflict
to continue.</p>
<p>PaineWebber's warrants added 1/2 to 4 1/4 as more than 1.2
million were traded. Salomon's January 1993 warrants rose 3/8
to 10 7/8; Eksportfinans' warrants gained 3/8 to 4 1/8, and
Denmark's went up 3/8 to 11 7/8.</p>
