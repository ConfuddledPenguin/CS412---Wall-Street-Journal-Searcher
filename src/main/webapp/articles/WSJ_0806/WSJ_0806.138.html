	<p class="article-leader">LOS ANGELES -- Federal Judge David V. Kenyon approved a
new map of county supervisorial boundaries here with a
voting-rights order that could shift the balance of power in
one of the nation's most populous counties.
   Judge Kenyon's order creates a new district designed to
assure that a Hispanic is elected to the county's five-member
governing board, but also allows candidates who don't live in
the district to seek to represent the district on the board.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Judge Kenyon adopted the redistricting plan proposed by
the American Civil Liberties Union and the Mexican American
Legal Defense and Education Fund. An estimated 35% of the
county's 8.7 million residents are Hispanic, according to a
demographer who drew up the plan.</p>
<p>The Los Angeles County plan affects more people than any
other local voting-rights case and may serve as a precedent
for other municipalities, said Chandler Davidson, a Rice
University sociology professor and author of a book about the
underrepresentation of minorities in state and local elective
offices.</p>
<p>Noting that most of the voting-rights litigation has
occurred in the deep South and Texas, Mr. Davidson said
"California is ripe for this type of litigation," with large
Hispanic, black and Asian minorities. "There are a lot of
potential plaintiffs out there."</p>
<p>Conservative county supervisors Michael Antonovich and
Deane Dana said they filed a motion Friday with the 9th
Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco to block the
judge's order. With the new district lines the pair face
losing their sway over the board.</p>
<p>"It's a judge running wild -- making law instead of
interpreting law," Mr. Antonovich said. "It's disgusting to
see Judge Kenyon work with two special interest groups . . .
in pursuing their liberal ideological agenda."</p>
<p>ACLU attorney Mark Rosenbaum disagreed saying, "The board
of supervisors is the most powerful local government in the
United States and some want it to remain an exclusive
all-white club . . . but {the judge's order} means for the
first time in 115 years the club is open to Hispanics."</p>
<p>Under the plan adopted by Judge Kenyon, a supervisorial
district represented by a retiring conservative supervisor
was redrawn to give it a Hispanic majority. The other four
districts would undergo minor adjustments that will generally
preserve the voter bases of two liberal and two conservative
supervisors.</p>
<p>Judge Kenyon's order could change 10 years of a
conservative majority on the board, possibly leading to
sweeping reversals on health care and social services
spending policies. The order was the judge's solution to
correct supervisorial boundaries that he earlier found
discriminatory.</p>
<p>The decision also sets a special election for Nov. 6 for
the new Hispanic majority district and voids results of a
June primary election. The district had been represented by
conservative Supervisor Pete Schabarum, who is retiring.</p>
<p>Judge Kenyon ruled June 4 that the board discriminated
against Hispanics when redrawing district boundaries after
the 1980 census. He found the supervisors violated the
federal Voting Rights Act and ordered the board to submit a
plan that would make it easier for a Hispanic win a seat.
Last week, he rejected the board's proposal as "nonsensical"
and "insensitive" to Hispanic and black residents.</p>
<p>In setting the new election date, the judge waived a
residency requirement to permit the two top June election
finishers under the old boundaries to run as candidates in
the redrawn district. Ironically, the top vote getter was
Sarah Flores, an Hispanic woman who is also a conservative
Republican. If she were elected in November, she would become
the first Hispanic supervisor since 1875, but the board would
continue to be dominated by conservatives.</p>
<p>Ms. Flores, a former assistant to Mr. Schabarum, blasted
the judge's order because it voided what she called the only
election in the last 30 years in which a Hispanic has a
chance of winning.</p>
