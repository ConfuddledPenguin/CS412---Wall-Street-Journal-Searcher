	<p class="article-leader">VENLO, the Netherlands -- A century ago, farmers pushing
wheelbarrows of vegetables to market sometimes paused here at
a bar run by Frans Maas. One day, Mr. Maas hit on a business
idea: He offered to group his customers' vegetables into one
big load and ship them to Germany in a horse-drawn cart.
   Since then, Mr. Maas's company has gradually built up
expertise in organizing shipments throughout Europe, handling
customs procedures and working around the myriad restrictions
protecting local haulers in each country. The Maas family
expanded the business intuitively -- "by a feeling in your
fingers," says Hans van Oijen, the current chairman of Frans
Maas Beheer N.V. "Now," he adds wryly, "we call it a
strategy."</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Over the next few years, Frans Maas Beheer and its rivals
will need all the intuition and strategy they can muster.
Faster than almost any other business, freight transport is
being revolutionized by the European Community's plan for a
unified market after 1992 and the opening of Eastern Europe
to freer trade. Both developments mean more goods will be
moving longer distances, creating a huge increase in demand
for transport services.</p>
<p>At the same time, deregulation is gradually removing the
restrictions that have long shielded inefficient operators.
As a result, trucking companies' profit margins -- already
thin in recent years -- are likely to shrink further just as
the biggest players are investing heavily to build up
Europewide networks.</p>
<p>"We're going to see a blood bath for some time," says Hans
Jansen, a corporate strategist for Kuhne & Nagel Group, a
transport company based in Switzerland. "Profits will suffer
-- that's quite clear. We're preparing for it." Both Kuhne &
Nagel and Frans Maas hope to be among the 10 or 15
pan-European companies expected to dominate the market once
the shakeout is over.</p>
<p>The free-for-all on the freeways won't come overnight, for
restrictions are falling away only in stages. July 1 the EC
began providing a limited number of permits allowing trucking
concerns based in one country to carry goods within the
borders of another. That means fewer trucks will have to
return all the way home empty, and thus more capacity will be
available, pushing down prices. The number of such permits is
due to rise in each of the next two years. In October, EC
transport ministers are scheduled to make politically
sensitive decisions about how fast to proceed.</p>
<p>For many of Europe's 300,000 trucking companies -- most of
them small, family outfits with one or two vehicles --
deregulation will be devastating. In West Germany, considered
the most protected market, the main asset of most small
trucking companies is a license to operate in that country.
Once any EC hauler has that right, the license will be
worthless.</p>
<p>Other EC members accuse Bonn of dragging its feet on
transport deregulation in order to protect those small
haulers. At the same time, some transport specialists argue
that deregulation should be slowed until there is greater
harmony among EC members on taxes and road-user fees, making
competition fairer. Even if the process is delayed, however,
industry executives see the trend toward open roads as
unstoppable.</p>
<p>"The forces behind deregulation are fierce," says Cees
Ruijgrok, a transport consultant in Delft. He says big
manufacturers, fed up with paying extra to protect marginal
haulers, will maintain the pressure for change.</p>
<p>At A.T. Kearney Inc. in Brussels, consultants predict that
competition will intensify enough to push road-transport
prices down about 15% over the next five years.</p>
<p>Many of the tiny haulers are likely to survive by keeping
costs low and acting as subcontractors to the pan-European
operators. Most vulnerable, analysts say, are midsize
trucking companies with high overheads and no specialized
skills to offer. Many of these operators are already selling
out to the giant companies.</p>
<p>The giants fighting for dominance in Europe include three
Switzerland-based companies -- Kuhne & Nagel, Panalpina World
Transport AG and Danzas AG -- as well as Nedlloyd Groep N.V.
of the Netherlands, LEP Group PLC of Britain, Schenker & Co.
of Germany and Bilspedition AB of Sweden. Such companies act
as freight forwarders -- or organizers of traffic -- often
using small subcontractors to do the actual hauling.</p>
<p>"We are not in the business of moving goods as such,"
explains Henk Rootliep, chairman of Nedlloyd, which over the
past two years has used acquisitions to triple its
road-transport revenue to 2 billion guilders ($1.08 billion)
annually. "We are in the business of controlling cargo
flows."</p>
<p>For now, Nedlloyd is earning minimal profits from road
transport. But the company is gambling that it will be able
to integrate its acquisitions into a cohesive network and
emerge as one of the biggest survivors in a high-growth,
high-technology business.</p>
<p>Growth is expected to kick into overdrive as a new Europe
takes shape. Over the next 15 years, Kearney projects,
international transport volumes will double in Europe. Part
of the reason for this is that manufacturers will be
centralizing production in huge factories serving all of
Europe rather than producing on a national level. The
centralized approach means that raw materials and finished
goods need to be shipped farther.</p>
<p>That is where the high technology comes in. The biggest
transport companies tout their abilities to use Europe-wide
networks, linked up with computers, to find the cheapest ways
to move goods. They also offer to take on such tasks as
warehousing, inventory management, quality control, labeling,
packaging and even invoicing. For manufacturers trying to
concentrate on their core businesses, farming out such
logistical tasks can have strong appeal. In Switzerland, for
example, chocolate maker Jacob Suchard AG recently assigned
Danzas to build and operate an automated warehouse.</p>
<p>At the same time, however, new competitors are challenging
the traditional road-transport companies. TNT Ltd. and
Federal Express Corp., both best known for their airborne
cargo services, are competing more and more with
road-transport companies in Europe, focusing on customers
willing to pay a premium for fast service.</p>
<p>Japanese transport companies also are gaining a foothold
in Europe. Just last month, for instance, Mitsui O.S.K. Lines
Ltd. bought a small Dutch trucking company to use as a base
for building up a European network.</p>
<p>"Everybody is looking toward acquisitions," says Mathieu
Vanderbroeck, a transport consultant at Knight Wendling in
Brussels. That interest has pushed up prices to what some
people in the industry consider risky levels, and good
acquisitions are becoming hard to find -- particularly in
France, where numerous foreign companies are searching.</p>
<p>For all the British government's hesitations over European
unity, U.K.-based transport companies are among the most
enthusiastic about Continental Europe.</p>
<p>NFC PLC operates a distribution center for Marks & Spencer
stores in France and provides similar services to Galerias
Preciados, a Spanish retailer. Christian Salvesen PLC hauls
Iglo frozen foods in Germany. LEP's road-transport arm
distributes spare parts for units of General Motors Corp. in
the Benelux countries.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the race is on to establish networks in Eastern
Europe. Danzas has set up a joint venture in Hungary. Kuhne &
Nagel opened its first offices in East Germany last spring
and will soon open one in Poland; it has appointed a
representative in Prague and is negotiating a joint venture
in Yugoslavia.</p>
<p>Frans Maas, with 1989 revenue of Fl 812 million, is still
in the second tier of Europe-wide transport companies but is
considered one of the best managed. Its share price has
nearly quadrupled in value since the company went public in
1987.</p>
<p>In the simple brick headquarters that houses Frans Maas's
central staff of two dozen people, Mr. van Oijen says the
company's strategy calls for concentrating on what it knows
best: organizing shipments in Europe. To cover the rest of
the globe, Frans Maas relies on joint ventures, such as the
one it is setting up with Sea-Land Corp. of the U.S. It also
expects to collaborate with KLM Royal Dutch Airlines, which
owns 31% of Frans Maas.</p>
<p>Like many others, Frans Maas wants to use its computer
expertise to manage its customers' logistical needs all the
way from raw materials to the store shelf. Its biggest such
contract is with Rank Xerox Manufacturing (Nederland) B.V.,
for which Frans Maas distributes copiers and related products
throughout Europe. Under that long-term contract, Frans Maas
and Rank Xerox are bound together by computer cables and an
intimate knowledge of each other's businesses. That makes it
harder for Rank Xerox to switch to another transport company
offering a slightly cheaper service.</p>
<p>Such comprehensive "dedicated-logistics" arrangements
account for less than 10% of Frans Maas's revenue. Mr. van
Oijen says many factory managers are reluctant to become so
dependent on one transport company, but he predicts that more
of them will be converted. Toward that end, Frans Maas
promises to save companies large amounts by trimming their
inventories to the bone and taking on responsibility for such
projects as managing warehouses.</p>
<p>"We have to offer the customer something special," Mr. van
Oijen says. "Driving from A to B -- anybody can do that."</p>
