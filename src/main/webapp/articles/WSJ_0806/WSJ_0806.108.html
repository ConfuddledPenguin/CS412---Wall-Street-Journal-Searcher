	<p class="article-leader">Laidlaw Inc. said it increased its holdings in ADT Ltd. to
28.8%, from 27.7%.
   The transaction, which has an indicated value of $34.1
million, brings Laidlaw's stake in ADT to about 284.6 million
common shares.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The shares were acquired from Michael Ashcroft, a director
of ADT. Laidlaw granted Mr. Ashcroft an option to repurchase
the stock at the price the company paid for it, $3.10 a
share, for a period ending Dec. 31, 1999 -- an agreement
Laidlaw can terminate on six months' notice any time after
Jan. 15, 1993.</p>
<p>A spokesman for Laidlaw said the Burlington, Ontario-based
transportation and waste-services concern would continue to
evaluate market and economic conditions before deciding to
purchase additional stock in ADT.</p>
<p>Laidlaw earlier indicated it would be reluctant to
increase its stake in ADT beyond 30% because of British
takeover regulations that require a company acquiring more
than a 30% holding to extend an offer to the rest of the
company's holders.</p>
<p>ADT is a Bermuda-based security services and auctions
concern. Laidlaw is 47%-controlled by Canadian Pacific Ltd.,
a Montreal transportation, resources and industrial holding
concern.</p>
