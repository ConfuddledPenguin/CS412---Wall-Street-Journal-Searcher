	<p class="article-leader">Waterford Wedgewood PLC Chairman Howard Kilroy said a
14-week strike at the Anglo-Irish glass and dinnerware
maker's crystal division, which ended in July, will hurt 1990
earnings, but he didn't make any specific forecasts.
   In a letter to shareholders, he said, "The strike has been
extremely damaging to us, both in financial and human terms,"
though new work rules should result in "significant cost
savings" in the future; the crystal division's plant was shut
in the April strike, when workers refused to implement a
cost-cutting plan. "The heavy costs associated with the
strike will clearly have a seriously negative effect on our
1990 results," he said, "but it is obviously premature for me
to make any forecasts of a financial nature at this time."</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Mr. Kilroy also said supply difficulties and a weak dollar
"were working seriously against us." The company depends
heavily on the U.S. market.</p>
