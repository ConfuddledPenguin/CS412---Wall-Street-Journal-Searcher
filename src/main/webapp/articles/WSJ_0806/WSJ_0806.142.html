	<p class="article-leader">Americans may have Saddam Hussein to thank for the
Recession of 1990.
   Friday's bleak report that the unemployment rate rose
sharply to 5.5% suggests that even before Iraq's invasion of
oil-rich Kuwait last week, America's wheezing economy had
ground to a virtual halt. Since the invasion, oil prices have
jumped about $5 a barrel, and many economists now see the
chances of a recession raised from a possibility to a
probability.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"I'm the gloomiest I've been since 1979," says Allen Sinai
of the Boston Co.</p>
<p>After nearly eight years of a growing economy, the
confident consumers of the Reagan years have turned cautious
and are slowing their purchases. The credit boom of the 1980s
has given way to the credit squeeze of 1990. The auto and
housing industries have long been weak. In the past 12
months, the economy has grown barely 1%. Now, the surge in
unemployment has followed a recent string of bad numbers,
including a 1.5% drop in factory orders in June, and suggests
that growth may have stopped altogether.</p>
<p>Add to that an increase in oil prices, and you have what
many economists consider a sure recipe for recession.
Moreover, a successful boycott of Iraqi oil would drive oil
prices into the stratosphere and practically guarantee a
recession in the U.S.</p>
<p>The Bush administration tried to put the best face on the
unemployment numbers, brushing away talk of recession. But
privately, one administration economist acknowledged that the
White House, after stripping away special factors, judged
Friday's labor report the worst since the end of the 1982
recession. The administration's top economic policy makers --
Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady, Budget Director Richard
Darman and Economist Michael Boskin -- were known to be
increasingly concerned. In private, they were described as
more and more frustrated with the Federal Reserve, which may
hold the best hope for keeping the economy afloat.</p>
<p>Faced with a weakening economy, the central bank is likely
to move as early as this week to cut interest rates. Fed
Chairman Alan Greenspan is worried by the employment numbers
and fears that the credit problems may be biting too deep.</p>
<p>But any such move will probably be modest, perhaps cutting
the key federal funds interest rate by a quarter percentage
point -- much less, in any case, than the administration is
hoping for. The gap between what the White House wants and
what the Fed is willing to provide is wide -- and
administration officials say it grew even wider after the
Iraqi invasion.</p>
<p>The oil-price rise that it unleashed is a double-edged
sword for the U.S. economy, simultaneously reducing growth
and raising inflation. So, for Mr. Greenspan, the invasion
poses a painful dilemma.</p>
<p>If he tries to cushion the economy by flooding it with
money and lowering rates, he might avoid a recession for a
while. But that would risk aggravating inflation; that's what
happened in the oil-shocked 1970s, when the U.S. suffered
double-digit price increases. Mr. Greenspan was in government
at that time, serving as an economic adviser to President
Ford, and he is determined not to wade through that swamp
again.</p>
<p>But if Mr. Greenspan tries to press the anti-inflation
fight as his No. 1 priority, he may have to tolerate a
recession. That's always an unappealing prospect, but
especially so right now. The Fed is clearly worried that a
recession, by dragging down additional thrift institutions,
could make the savings-and-loan crisis even more appalling
than it already is. Even worse, a recession might undermine
substantial numbers of weak banks. Moreover, Mr. Greenspan
would be taking a hard line in an election year, to the
predictable outrage of an administration clearly allergic to
tight credit.</p>
<p>The Iraqi invasion also throws a huge new obstacle in the
budget talks currently under way between the administration
and Congress. Negotiators had privately been counting on a
new energy tax as a big money-raiser in the effort to bring
down the deficit. But with gasoline prices already projected
to increase at least 10 cents a gallon, the political
appetite for a tax that would push that further is certain to
fade.</p>
<p>There is likely to be "less interest among summiteers in
energy taxes, gasoline taxes or, for that matter, excise
taxes, that would increase the rate of inflation," says
Robert Reischauer, the director of the Congressional Budget
Office. To the contrary, Republican Sen. Pete Domenici of New
Mexico says several of his Senate colleagues have even begun
to inquire about enacting costly new tax breaks to encourage
domestic oil production.</p>
<p>Cutting defense spending also may be more difficult in the
wake of the Iraqi invasion, negotiators say. And talk of
recession is certain to raise fears that a budget pact will
make the nation's economic problems even worse in the short
term. "With the economy in a state of slow growth, people get
worried that any adjustment will tip us over," says Rep. Bill
Frenzel, a Minnesota Republican. "The momentum is in the
hands of the big spenders."</p>
<p>Budget negotiators still hope they can cut a
deficit-reduction deal after returning from their August
vacations. Senate Budget Committee Chairman Jim Sasser of
Tennessee reasons that economic problems may even be a spur
to action.</p>
<p>But if there is a deal, it now seems likely to be more
modest than that originally envisioned by the budget
summiteers. Administration officials have even discussed the
possibility of a package that makes only shallow cuts in the
deficit in the first year but promises bigger cuts later --
after the economy has recovered. "The real question," said
House Budget Committee Chairman Leon Panetta of California,
"is whether the agreement will be as bold as any of us would
like."</p>
<p>Whether the economy will fall into recession is still far
from certain. Although the latest figures show widespread
weakness, a continued pickup in American exports,
particularly to Europe, promises some help to the economy.
And Mr. Boskin, the chairman of the president's Council of
Economic Advisers, continues to predict that "the economy
will pick up in coming months."</p>
<p>Others are less certain. "The chances of a recession have
risen," says Victor Zarnowitz, an economist at the University
of Chicago. "Maybe they aren't higher than 50%, but they are
very close to that."</p>
<p>If the economy does turn down, most analysts expect the
recession to be relatively mild. Although the economy is
awash in excessive debt, it isn't suffering from the high
inflation rates and other excesses that made the slumps of
the 1970s and 1980s so painful. "If we have a recession, it
will probably feel like recessions of the 1950s and 1960s,"
says Harvard economist Lawrence Summers.</p>
<p>Unemployment is also likely to remain well below its
double-digit rates of 1982. With fewer teen-agers and women
entering the work force these days, finding jobs for those
who want them is simpler.</p>
<p>But even without 1982-style joblessness, the bite of a
recession would nevertheless be felt -- and indeed already is
being felt in some areas. Falling home prices in New England,
for instance, are making many people feel substantially less
prosperous. Bernice Cramer bought a home for $437,000 in
Newton, Mass., in June 1988 and has watched its value
nosedive. She figures it is now worth $50,000 to $75,000 less
than when she bought it.</p>
<p>"I love my house, I'm glad I bought it, but I threw away a
lot of money," Ms. Cramer says. As a result, the business
consultant and her family are having to be more cautious in
their spending. "We get along with one car, instead of buying
a second one."</p>
<p>Although New England may be the worst hit, other areas of
the country are experiencing a housing-led recession as well.
Robert Gordon, a professor of economics at Northwestern
University, says the prosperous North Shore of Chicago is
also seeing a dearth of real-estate sales. And declines in
housing prices are spilling over into other sectors of the
economy as house-poor consumers trim purchases.</p>
<p>"Rising housing prices and rising housing equity give
people a kind of financial flexibility and an air of optimism
that has positive effects" throughout the economy, says
Thomas Juster, a consumer-behavior specialist at the
University of Michigan. "But in these weaker housing markets,
where the house is worth less than people paid for it," the
opposite is true, and spending declines. Mr. Juster adds that
a fall in real-estate values is far more damaging to consumer
spending than, say, a fall in stock prices because few
Americans own substantial amounts of stock.</p>
<p>A recession would also be unusually mild for
manufacturers. In the past, goods producers have taken the
biggest hit when the economy turns down, while service firms
have been less badly battered. This time, however, many
manufacturers are getting a boost from healthy exports.</p>
<p>Bankruptcies are likely to be common in a recession of
1990, if it occurs. The debt craze of the 1980s left many
companies with more debt than they can possibly service in a
sluggish economy. Some have already started to default;
others are sure to as the economy slows.</p>
<p>But Harvard's Prof. Summers argues that debt-driven
bankruptcies may not hurt the economy as much as previous
business shake-ups. In 1982, he notes, companies were going
belly up because their products or services had suddenly
become uncompetitive in the world market. In 1990, however,
many of the debt-burdened companies would remain profitable
if it weren't for their debt. Those companies may simply be
sold off to new owners, causing losses for the banks and
junk-bond holders who lent them money but without causing big
layoffs.</p>
<p>Even if the economy steers clear of a recession, the
immediate future is hardly bright, however. Economic growth
is likely to remain what it has been for the past year:
sluggish.</p>
<p>"The long-term growth rate is very important," Mr.
Zarnowitz says. In the '50s and '60s, he notes, recessions
were frequent, but growth was stronger between recessions.
Now, the economy seems to have settled into a long,
slow-growth expansion, averaging only 1.2% growth over the
past year. "It's not clear to me this isn't worse," he says.</p>
