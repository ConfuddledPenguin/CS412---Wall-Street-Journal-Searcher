	<p class="article-leader">LONDON -- Higher oil prices will eventually crimp the
demand for copper and other base metals, dealers say.
   "The negative impact on world economic growth is likely to
reduce consumption of base metals," says Hans Murmann,
managing director of Metallgesellschaft Ltd. in London.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>By paying more for gasoline and heating oil, consumers
will have less money to spend on washing machines,
refrigerators and automobiles, he says. And because profit
growth is already under pressure, many companies are
beginning to postpone plans to invest in plant and equipment.</p>
<p>"I was edgy about the copper market before the Iraqi
invasion of Kuwait," Mr. Murmann says. "Now, I am downright
concerned."</p>
<p>During the oil crises of the 1970s, base metals prices
initially surged before declining, says Angus MacMillan,
analyst at Billiton-Enthoven Metals Ltd. This time around,
high interest rates and slack economies could restrain the
market, he says.</p>
<p>Copper futures prices peaked at $1.29 a pound last week
and the September contract closed at $1.2550 on Friday, down
3.4 cents from Thursday but up from $1.05 in June. The summer
surge was the result of reduced supplies from Chile, Peru and
Zambia and a spurt in orders from a Japanese buyer, London
dealers say.</p>
<p>But since the middle of July, London Metal Exchange stocks
jumped to 104,000 metric tons from 46,000 tons. While the
rise in stocks indicates there isn't a critical shortage of
copper, dealers say, Japanese buyers withdrew on Friday as
soon as they became worried about higher oil prices.
Moreover, producers are taking advantage of the higher price
levels by hedging future production on the metals exchange,
dealers say.</p>
<p>Previous to last week, the copper, zinc and other base
metals markets ignored the U.S. economic slowdown because of
surging orders in Japan, other Far Eastern countries and West
Germany, dealers say.</p>
<p>But Far Eastern nations are geared to imported oil and a
prolonged period of higher petroleum prices will hurt their
economies, dealers say. As a result, metals consumption could
wane.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, dealers were also optimistic on hopes
that the liberalization of Eastern Europe would eventually
generate a boom in base metals demand, dealers say. Instead,
Eastern European mines are selling more copper and zinc to
Western merchants, dealers say. Demand at home is weak.</p>
<p>"The market was far too optimistic, says Philip Sewell, a
consultant at Commodities Research Unit Ltd. in London. His
company is forecasting a drop in Eastern European metals
consumption in the next three to four years, he says.</p>
<p>Now that the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe have
abandoned their special trading relationship, Mr. Sewell
says, they must import oil and other commodities at free
market prices. That situation means they must export as much
as they can.</p>
<p>Eastern Europe produces 800,000 tons of copper, nearly 10%
of world output, he says. About half the copper comes from
Poland, the fourth largest producer in the world.</p>
<p>Bulgaria, Yugoslavia and Poland are also large-scale
miners of lead and zinc, Mr. Sewell says. And scrapped
equipment from obsolete factories in East Germany and other
Eastern states could also raise supplies of base metals, he
notes.</p>
<p>"The destruction of the Iron Curtain is a statement of
bankruptcy, which will increase the burden on Western
Europe," says Roger Hornett, a director of Sassoon (Europe)
Ltd., London securities dealers. Meanwhile across Europe,
steel prices have fallen as demand softened, bulk chemical
prices have dropped drastically and increased competition has
produced a price war in the auto market.</p>
<p>Despite these concerns, other analysts are confident that
base metals prices will hold firm.</p>
<p>"I will only be worried if oil prices soar to $30 a
barrel," says Neil Buxton, metals analyst at Shearson Lehman
Hutton. At current oil prices, economic growth will underpin
demand for base metals, he says. Meanwhile, a "myriad of
supply problems and political unrest in major producing
nations" should keep the market tight, he says.</p>
<p>Edwin Arnold, metals analyst at Merrill Lynch, Pierce,
Fenner & Smith in London, predicts copper prices will recover
because the major economies are unlikely to slip into
recession.</p>
<p>Looking ahead to commodities markets this week:</p>
<p>Energy</p>
<p>U.S. petroleum futures prices are expected to continue
their meteoric rise this week, driven mostly by the response
of the industrialized world to Iraq's invasion of Kuwait. An
embargo by the U.S., echoed in Japan and Europe, of Iraqi and
Kuwaiti goods including oil, can't help but push world crude
prices higher. Late last week, even before economic sanctions
were announced outside the U.S., crude prices gained as much
as $3.50 a barrel in a day's trading, with outer months on
the New York Mercantile Exchange reaching their trading
limits immediately and staying there. Refiners have increased
their posted prices for crude oil and service stations are
already passing the costs on to motorists.</p>
<p>Traders and analysts will be relying on their considerable
international intelligence gathering mechanisms this week to
figure out what Iraq President Saddam Hussein has in mind for
Kuwait's oil production, now that Iraqi troops have begun
their exit from that tiny sheikdom. Prices could falter a bit
as rumors that Iraq would proceed to Saudi Arabia are proved
untrue.</p>
<p>Gold</p>
<p>This week promises more of the same volatility that shook
the gold market following Iraq's invasion of Kuwait.</p>
<p>December gold futures ended little changed, up only 50
cents an ounce at $386.40. The uncertainty of the market was
reflected in the inconclusive ending, which was about in the
middle of a trading range of almost $9. After falling at the
start in a continuation of selling from late Thursday, the
December contract rose on a report that Iraq had massed
troops on the Saudi Arabian border and had even penetrated
Saudi soil.</p>
<p>This report was later denied, causing prices to fall. They
retreated further on another report that the Soviet Union had
been assured Iraq would soon withdraw its troops from Kuwait.</p>
<p>They fell still further just before the close on a news
service report that said Iraq's president would meet with his
defeated opponent, Kuwait's Emir, Sheik Jabar al-Ahmed
al-Sabah, in Saudi Arabia.</p>
<p>"The most anyone can foresee at the moment is that the
principals are going to sit down and talk about the
situation," says Alan Posnick, senior vice president of MTB
Banking. "That creates the perception that a solution might
be found, which would be negative for gold."</p>
<p>However, until there is a resolution, this week will see a
continuation of the nervous volatility in gold prices, Mr.
Posnick says.</p>
<p>Livestock and Meats</p>
<p>Last week featured a roller-coaster ride of gains and
retreats in the prices of pork-belly and hog futures
contracts, and this week isn't likely to be much different.
Analysts predicted a choppy week of trading, especially in
pork-belly futures, as dual pressures of relatively strong
demand and increasing fresh supplies of slaughtered hogs push
prices up and down.</p>
<p>Hog slaughter increased about 9% last week from the
previous week. On Wednesday and Thursday, as more fresh pork
became available, demand decreased for frozen pork bellies
out of storage, exerting downward pressure on pork-belly
futures prices. Yet demand is fairly strong, which caused
prices to rebound Friday and likely will continue as a price
factor this week. Pork bellies are used to make bacon, and
low cash prices for pork bellies have generated interest in
bacon among retailers, says Thomas Morgan, president of
Sterling Research Corp., Arlington Heights, Ill.</p>
