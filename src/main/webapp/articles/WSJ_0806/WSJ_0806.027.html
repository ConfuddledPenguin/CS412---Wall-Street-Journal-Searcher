	<p class="article-leader">AMHERST, N.Y. -- Mark IV Industries Inc. said its board
approved the repurchase of up to 1.5 million shares, or about
11% of the company's 14 million common shares outstanding, in
open-market or private transactions.
   Since April 1989, the maker of industrial products has
purchased about 3.3 million common shares under previously
authorized stock repurchase programs. The company said it
will repurchase the stock over a period of time because it
believes its stock to be "an appropriate investment."</p>
