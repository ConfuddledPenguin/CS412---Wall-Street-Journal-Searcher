	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- Congress went home for the summer amid a
rush of legislation demonstrating a renewed aggressiveness in
the Democratic leadership and underscoring major policy
differences with President Bush going into the fall
elections.
   Landmark oil-spill and AIDS-treatment bills were sent to
the White House with broad support from both parties. But the
tone was set more by the forceful role of Speaker Thomas
Foley in partisan debates over civil rights and campaign
finance. Commanding strong discipline in the South, the
Democratic leadership crushed a Republican, pro-business
amendment on employment discrimination standards. And in one
rowdy, late-night fight, Mr. Foley overrode objections in his
own party to win adoption of legislation seeking to limit
election spending.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Separately, intelligence legislation approved by the
Senate would curb U.S. covert funding for wars in Cambodia
and Afghanistan. And the administration suffered a major
setback on what became an almost party-line, 54-44 vote in
the Senate over the direction of the Strategic Defense
Initiative.</p>
<p>The Democrats' show of force served to divert attention
from the failure of Congress to act on the budget. But when
lawmakers return in September, they will be faced with the
immediate threat of massive across-the-board spending cuts. A
two-month debt extension, approved before adjournment, will
continue government borrowing until the new fiscal year
begins in October. But the greater test will be meeting an
ambitious schedule agreed to by the leadership and the White
House calling for the completion of budget negotiations by
Sept. 10 and swift enactment of a deficit-reduction package.</p>
<p>Following is a summary of major legislative action before
adjournment Saturday:</p>
<p>Debt and Budget</p>
<p>Congress sent to the White House legislation raising the
federal borrowing limit by about $73 billion, to $3.195
trillion from $3.122 trillion. The increase is judged
sufficient to keep the government operating through Oct. 2,
and the bill won quick approval after threats from lawmakers
to attach amendments failed to materialize.</p>
<p>Left pending in the Senate is a long-term debt resolution
that would extend the borrowing limit through fiscal 1991 and
raise the debt ceiling to $3.44 trillion. Efforts to bring up
the measure late Saturday failed when conservatives objected
because the leadership wouldn't permit them to offer their
proposal for a capital-gains tax cut as an amendment. The
debt-ceiling bill could yet serve as a vehicle to carry any
deficit-reduction agreement that emerges this fall but, for
the moment, both parties find it easier to agree on new
spending.</p>
<p>Minutes before adjourning, the Senate rushed through a
more than $28 billion transportation bill for the new fiscal
year, after tacking on a $10.9 million provision sought by
GOP Leader Robert Dole of Kansas for a highway project in
Wichita. The bill represents a $1.31 billion increase above
the administration's budget and proposes federal rules to bar
interstate truckers and bus drivers from using radar
detectors.</p>
<p>Campaign Finance</p>
<p>Adopted 255-155, the bill proposes a $550,000 spending
limit for most House elections and a matching tax credit of
up to $50 for in-state individual contributions. The measure
stops far short of a Senate-passed ban on political action
committees and, to prevail, the leadership was forced to kill
a more far-reaching package calling for public financing and
deeper cuts from both PAC contributions and those of wealthy
individuals.</p>
<p>Civil Rights</p>
<p>By a 272-154 margin, the House approved legislation to
reverse Supreme Court decisions last year regarding the
application of laws prohibiting employment discrimination.
The measure closely resembles a comparable Senate-passed bill
but faces strong opposition in the administration, which
argues that the standards of proof and level of damages
permitted in the measure would impose an unfair burden on
business and encourage quotas.</p>
<p>In response, proponents agreed to a $150,000 cap on
punitive damages for employers with fewer than 100 workers,
and language was added to say that nothing in the bill should
be interpreted as requiring hiring or promotion quotas. The
Republican alternative, backed by the Chamber of Commerce,
failed 238-188. The Democratic victory reflected strong
pressure in party ranks by the Black Caucus and Majority Whip
William Gray. Rep. John Lewis (D., Ga.), a hero of the 1960s
civil rights movement, delivered an emotional appeal in a
meeting of the party's whip organization. The Democratic
delegations from his native Alabama as well as the Carolinas
later voted en bloc with the party. Georgia's delegation, by
comparison, was conspicuous in its opposition to the
leadership and, in Arkansas, Rep. Beryl Anthony, chairman of
the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, and Rep.
Bill Alexander, who received help from black lawmakers in his
campaign this year, sided with the GOP.</p>
<p>Environment</p>
<p>Ending a 16-year stalemate, the oil-spill legislation
requires all new tankers operating in U.S. waters to be
equipped with double hulls. Federal liability limits are
increased and, despite administration objections, the measure
leaves states free to set unlimited liability for shippers
and other parties responsible for spills. Final approval came
on a 360-0 roll call but only after the House voted 281-82 to
block an industry effort to strip an attached provision
imposing a moratorium -- opposed by Mobil Corp. -- on
drilling off North Carolina's coast.</p>
<p>Separately, a House-Senate conference on clean-air
legislation reached agreement on provisions designed to phase
out production of chlorofluorocarbons and other chemicals
used in refrigeration and insulation but harmful to the
stratospheric ozone layer. The standards would generally
demand that production be phased out faster over the next
decade than now required under international agreements
signed by the U.S. Production of CFCs and carbon
tetrachloride would end by 2000, and methyl chloroform by
2002. For HCFCs, which are less damaging substitutes for
CFCs, output would be banned in 2030.</p>
<p>Health & Safety</p>
<p>AIDS-treatment legislation sent to the president would
initially authorize an estimated $880 million annually for
health care and early-intervention services by states and
emergency-relief grants to areas hardest hit by the epidemic.
Fifteen metropolitan areas, including New York, Boston,
Dallas and San Francisco, are expected to qualify in fiscal
1991 for the emergency aid, which is authorized at $275
million but still subject to actual appropriations.</p>
<p>Separately, the Senate approved legislation that would
require the use of child safety seats for infants and
toddlers on domestic commercial airline flights.</p>
<p>Trade</p>
<p>Congress approved an amalgam of trade provisions,
including a restructuring of the customs user fee charged on
most imports. Trade benefits under the Caribbean Basin
Initiative would be made permanent, and the bill also would
make permanent the current ban on the export of unmilled logs
from federal land in the lower 48 states.</p>
