	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- In the wake of the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait,
short-term and long-term interest rates are parting company.
   Investors, worried about the inflationary impact of rising
oil prices, are shying away from buying long-term Treasury
bonds, driving long-term interest rates higher.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>But convinced that the Federal Reserve may soon cut
short-term interest rates to revive a weakening economy, they
are snapping up short-term notes.</p>
<p>"I think short-term rates will continue to go lower" on
expectations that the Fed will ease credit, said Maria
Fiorini Ramirez, president of Maria Ramirez Capital
Consultants Inc., a unit of John Hancock Freedom Securities.</p>
<p>But even if the Fed reduces short-term interest rates, she
said, long-term rates may spurt still higher on fears that a
weak economy won't reduce stubborn inflation.</p>
<p>The bond market's schizophrenic behavior is showing up
clearly in the gap between yields on two-year Treasury notes
and 30-year bonds, which is now the widest it has been in two
years.</p>
<p>Traders refer to this as a "steepening yield curve," and
economists generally regard it as a sign that investors have
become jittery about the prospects of rising inflation.</p>
<p>Yields on two-year Treasury notes have fallen sharply in
recent weeks and now are about 7.8%. Meanwhile, yields on
30-year Treasury bonds have risen slightly to about 8.56%.
The difference between the short-term and the long-term
yields, which is called the yield spread, is about 3/4
percentage point. Ms. Ramirez said the spread is likely to
widen to one full percentage point.</p>
<p>The yield curve had been slowly steepening for several
weeks as short-term interest rates fell faster than long-term
rates. But last week, when Iraqi troops invaded Kuwait,
investors made a mad dash for short-term Treasury securities,
buying up three-month and six-month bills as well as
two-year, three-year and five-year Treasury notes.</p>
<p>"Nobody was willing to sell" short-term securities, said
James Capra, a senior vice president at Shearson Lehman
Government Securities Inc.</p>
<p>Some of the buying was so-called "flight-to-quality"
purchases made by investors rushing to get cash out of the
Middle East and into the U.S., which is considered a safe
haven. But the bulk of buyers last week were domestic traders
and arbitragers who are betting that the Fed will soon cut
the benchmark federal funds rate from its current level of
8%, which in turn will boost the value of securities
purchased when rates were higher and allow those investors to
book profits.</p>
<p>A cut in the federal funds rate, which banks charge each
other on overnight loans, could also nudge other short-term
and intermediate-term rates lower. Commercial bankers could
react to such a move by cutting the prime, or base, lending
rate for corporations as well as short-term consumer lending
rates like those on home-equity loans.</p>
<p>Speculation that the Fed will soon ease interest rates has
been swirling for weeks, but the prospects that such an
easing will occur sooner, rather than later, were heightened
on Friday when the government released a bombshell July
employment report.</p>
<p>The biggest surprise was that employment growth actually
declined, the first time that has happened since June 1986.
The Department of Labor said the number of non-farm jobs
declined 219,000 last month. Even when layoffs of temporary
census workers were excluded, the decline was 57,000.</p>
<p>With so many workers handed pink sheets, the unemployment
rate jumped 0.3 percentage point to 5.5%.</p>
<p>"The employment numbers confirmed that the economy is
weak; I think the Fed will ease," said Samuel D. Kahan, chief
financial economist at Fuji Securities Inc. He said that if
the Fed decides to make its move, it will likely do so early
this week -- before the Treasury's huge quarterly auction of
government securities. Otherwise, he said, the Fed may wait
until late this month to ease rates, after its next
policymaking Federal Open Market Committee meeting.</p>
<p>Mr. Kahan and many other economists on Wall Street think
the Fed will probably ease despite oil-inspired inflation
fears.</p>
<p>"Central bankers always say that their job is to fight
inflation, no matter what," Mr. Kahan said. "But the truth of
the matter is, this central bank will only fight inflation
when it is sure that economic activity is growing. If it
looks like the economy is sliding toward recession, the fight
against inflation will be postponed -- not aborted -- but
postponed."</p>
<p>But the long-term end of the bond market is worlds apart
from the short end. In fact, long-term investors are worried
about how events unfolding in the Persian Gulf will affect
inflation.</p>
<p>Fears of spiraling prices came from two sources. One is a
big spike in oil prices triggered by the Iraqi invasion of
Kuwait, which raises the specter of less-plentiful and
more-expensive oil supplies. The other is the six-cent rise
in hourly earnings in the July employment report, a figure
that analysts say makes the threat of inflation even greater.</p>
<p>With the threat of inflation looming large, investors are
cooling toward long-term Treasury bonds. They are not
dumping, but simply aren't buying any new ones. And that's
depressing prices.</p>
<p>Still, at a time when the stock market appears shaky, the
economy is on the verge of recession and numerous financial
uncertainties exist, some investors are sticking with
long-term Treasurys.</p>
<p>"You can get 8.5% yield on 30-year Treasury bonds and that
looks pretty good to us," said Ian MacKinnon, head of
fixed-income investments at Vanguard Group. "If it turns out
that what Iraq has done is push inflation up, then I will
have to modify my outlook," he said.</p>
<p>All of this is a mixed blessing for the Treasury, which is
scheduled to auction $32.25 billion of securities this week
in its quarterly refunding of the federal debt. The Treasury
will sell $11.5 billion of three-year notes tomorrow, $10.5
billion of ten-year notes Wednesday and $10.25 billion of
30-year bonds Thursday.</p>
<p>"Considering the appetite for short-term securities, the
first auction should be the smoothest," said Ms. Ramirez. She
said, however, that the ten-year and 30-year bonds may
encounter more investor resistance.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>Friday's Market Activity</p>
<p>Prices of long-term bonds continued to tumble in the
aftermath of Iraq's conquest of Kuwait.</p>
<p>The benchmark 30-year Treasury bond fell nearly 1 1/4
points, or $12.50 for a bond with a $1,000 face amount, on
Thursday as news of turmoil in the Middle East sparked
speculation that oil supplies would become less plentiful and
more expensive, putting upward pressure in inflation.</p>
<p>The bond rout continued Friday with prices of the
benchmark 30-year bond plunging an additional 1 1/8 point.</p>
<p>Prices of short-term issues, however, rose as employment
data hinting of a recession seemed to indicate the Federal
Reserve might have to ease policy quickly to keep the
economic expansion alive.</p>
<p>In the corporate-bond market, the payment-in-kind bonds of
RJR Nabisco Inc. settled sharply lower after investment firm
Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co. -- which controls RJR -- bought
back a hefty chunk of its exchangeable bonds Thursday.
Payment-in-kind bonds pay interest in the form of additional
securities.</p>
<p>The bonds fell because investors assume that the
repurchase of RJR Nabisco's pay-in-kind bonds is nearly
complete.</p>
<p>Officials at RJR Nabisco declined to comment on the
buy-backs, but traders estimate that RJR in the past three
weeks has bought back $1.5 billion of its 17% bonds of 2007.
Much of that buying was done last Thursday, traders said,
when Iraq's invasion of Kuwait spooked many participants in
the financial markets. People familiar with the open-market
repurchase program estimate that RJR did most of its
purchases at 90 cents to 94 cents on the dollar.</p>
<p>On Thursday alone, KKR, working through Goldman, Sachs &
Co., bought between $800 million and $1 billion of the RJR
bonds, according to people familiar with the repurchase. At
least some of those purchases were below the bonds' New York
Stock Exchange closing price of 91 3/4 cents on the dollar,
traders said. KKR, Goldman and RJR all declined to discuss
their roles.</p>
<p>Market sources speculated that some of the bonds may have
come from the accounts of takeover-stock speculators as well
as from Nebraska investor Warren Buffet. Mr. Buffet declined
to comment.</p>
<p>RJR's 17% exchangeable payment-in-kind debentures ended 1
3/4 points lower to close at 90 on robust volume of nearly
$20 million on the New York Stock Exchange. RJR's 17 3/8%
convertible payment-in-kind debentures fell 2 1/8 points to
close at 111 1/2 on relatively heavy volume.</p>
<p>In the broader high-yield market, junk bonds, or
speculative-grade securities with low credit ratings or no
credit ratings at all, finished 1/2 to 3/4 point lower.</p>
<p>Hard hit were the junk bonds of casinos operated by real
estate developer Donald Trump. Trump Plaza Funding Corp.'s 12
7/8% first-mortgage bonds ended down three points at 76,
while the Trump Taj Mahal Funding Corp.'s 14% bonds closed
down 1 1/2 points at 44 in over-the-counter trading.</p>
<p>Some Trump bonds have been been falling due to news that
gaming revenues at the Trump casinos fell sharply during
July.</p>
