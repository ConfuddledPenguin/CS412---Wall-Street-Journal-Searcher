	<p class="article-leader">PITTSBURGH -- Directors at Allegheny International Inc.,
succumbing to pressure from banks, creditors and
shareholders, agreed to a plan that will turn the company
over to archrival Japonica Partners.
   But directors did manage to get in one last dig: rewarding
themselves with a half-year's severance pay.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The reorganization plan, a modified version of a
company-sponsored plan, was confirmed by the U.S. Bankruptcy
Court Friday and effectively ends a contentious 2 1/2-year
process. The plan calls for a completely new board and
management. Japonica is expected to take control Aug. 15,
when the company will be renamed Sunbeam/Oster Corp.</p>
<p>Directors initially balked at amending their own plan to
allow Japonica to buy newly issued stock from banks,
creditors and shareholders, thus boosting its stake to an
estimated 90% from 50%, and to install new management.</p>
<p>However, the board relented on Friday after disgruntled
creditors wrote letters saying that failure to support the
Japonica modifications, which had a consensus backing them,
would be considered a breach of fiduciary duty and subject to
lawsuits.</p>
<p>The modified agreement calls for Japonica to pay banks
$6.60 a share, creditors $7 a share and warrant holders $1.53
per warrant. A key revision, which helped gain creditors'
support, gives creditors 45 days to decide whether they want
to take cash or retain their shares.</p>
<p>"Usually security holders don't get a choice," said Wilbur
Ross of Rothschild Inc., who advised unsecured creditors.
"Here they can make up their own mind as to whether they want
to remain as investors with Japonica."</p>
<p>Japonica will combine $270 million in the company's
existing cash and $97 million in equity commitments from its
primary investors, Steinhardt Partners Inc. and Mutual Shares
Fund, to pay banks and creditors of Allegheny's Sunbeam unit.
By Aug. 15, Japonica must also provide commitments for about
$95 million to buy remaining stock and warrants, and a $110
million credit facility for working capital.</p>
<p>The additional financing doesn't seem to be an obstacle,
said Robert Sable, an attorney representing unsecured
creditors. "Barring any unforeseen catastrophe, I'm confident
this thing will finally be over and we can go on living
normal lives," said Mr. Sable, who has seen a series of
earlier buy-out and reorganization plans fizzle.</p>
<p>As part of the agreement, board members will receive a
half year's severance pay. Although executives often receive
severance pay, such payments to directors are considered
highly unusual by those working on the bankruptcy case. The
board severance pay and the one-year severance pay to
chairman Oliver S. Travers total $650,000.</p>
<p>The agreement also gives James D. Milligan, whom Allegheny
had tapped to run the reorganized company, a $1.5 million
severance agreement as long as he doesn't compete with
Allegheny for two years.</p>
<p>Paul B. Kazarian, one of the Japonica partners, would be
named chairman, succeeding Mr. Travers. Mr. Kazarian said
presidents of operating units would remain and that employees
would be offered equity in the company.</p>
<p>"This is as close to a win-win-win situation as you can
get," Mr. Kazarian said. "Creditors get top dollar, the
company gets its own plan confirmed with slight
modifications, and the company and stakeholders get a balance
sheet with close to $300 million of new equity."</p>
<p>Mr. Travers said he was optimistic the company would
emerge from bankruptcy under this agreement and "that the
company would work closely with Japonica."</p>
<p>Allegheny International is a manufacturer of small
electrical appliances. Japonica Partners is an investor group
based in New York.</p>
<p>Separately, Allegheny reported that losses in the third
quarter ended July 1 widened to $32.1 million from $15.3
million. Sales rose slightly to $237.3 million from $234.9
million.</p>
