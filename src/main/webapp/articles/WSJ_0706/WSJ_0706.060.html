	<p class="article-leader">TOKYO -- Sales of imported cars, trucks and buses in Japan
climbed 25% to set a monthly record for June of 22,253 units
from 17,840 units a year earlier, the Japan Automobile
Importers' Association said.
   Statistics show sales of imported, foreign motor vehicles
topped year-earlier levels for the 78th month in a row.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Sales for the first six months of this year set a record
of 113,622 units, representing a 40% gain from 81,318 units
in the first half of 1989.</p>
<p>The association said booming personal consumption was
behind the strong gain, as Japan's economy continues to
expand for the 43rd month in a row.</p>
<p>The strong increase from year-earlier levels was traced in
part to a Japanese consumption tax imposed in April, 1989,
which replaced a higher commodity tax. The price gap between
Japanese cars and imported cars also has narrowed as Japanese
auto makers have unveiled more expensive models.</p>
<p>By country, in all imported vehicle categories, West
Germany was the source of 13,531 units, up 16% from 11,708
units. The trend of rising sales of West German cars since
the introduction of a consumption tax is not likely to
change, despite an average price rise of 3% for West German
models in the domestic market.</p>
<p>Sales of all U.S.-made vehicles grew 28% in June to 2,898
units from 2,258 units. Sales of all British vehicles
registered a 67% upsurge to 2,230 units in June from 1,338
units.</p>
<p>French car sales showed a 43% jump, totaling 1,520 units,
while Swedish sales registered a 29% increase to 1,305 units.</p>
