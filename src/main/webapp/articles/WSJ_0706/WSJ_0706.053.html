	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Citicorp, responding to insurance industry
efforts to prevent it from using a Delaware subsidiary to
sell insurance, told the Federal Reserve that there aren't
any legal grounds to prohibit it from taking advantage of a
recently enacted Delaware law.
   Since the passage of the legislation giving
state-chartered banks insurance powers, Citicorp has been
preparing to underwrite and sell insurance through its
state-chartered unit, Citibank Delaware.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>In a memo to the Fed, the nation's largest banking company
said federal banking regulations allow state-chartered
subsidiaries of banks to engage in any activities in which
state-chartered banks themselves can engage.</p>
<p>The insurance industry has argued that the Delaware law
permits banks to circumvent federal regulations that prohibit
banks from selling and underwriting insurance.</p>
