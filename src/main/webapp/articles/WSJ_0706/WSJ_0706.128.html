	<h3>Credit Markets: Bonds Fall on Surprisingly Strong Auto Sales, Creating Anxieties About Today's Jobs Data</h3>

	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- News that car sales surged in late June gave
big bond dealers the jitters yesterday, prompting them to
sell bonds out of fear that today's employment report may
also deliver surprising results.
   Prior to the release of the car-sales data, many bond
dealers loaded up on long-term Treasury bonds. They were
betting that the employment report would show an economy
that's growing weaker and revive speculation among investors
that the Federal Reserve would lower interest rates to stave
off recession. That, in turn, would cause bond prices to
soar.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>But after the car-sales data were released, "the tone
became a little more apprehensive" as players reconsidered
just how weak the jobs statistics will be, said Joseph Liro,
a vice president and money-market economist at S.G. Warburg
Securities & Co. Inc.</p>
<p>Domestic auto sales were estimated yesterday to have been
running at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of eight million
units in the June 21-30 period, the highest rate since
February. Industry analysts had expected an annual rate of
about seven million units.</p>
<p>In response to the data, bond prices slid. The benchmark
30-year Treasury bond fell more than 1/4 point, or $2.50 for
a bond with a $1,000 face amount. The issue's yield, which
moves in the opposite direction of its price, rose to 8.40%.</p>
<p>Bond-market analysts said the auto data, which was the
highlight of an otherwise dull session, inspired some market
participants to liquidate their holdings of longer-term
bonds. Most of the trading was executed by bond dealers,
while retail investors remained quiet on the sidelines.</p>
<p>"Some dealers decided to lighten up their positions and
take profits in response to the auto-sales report, which came
in much stronger than expected. The report introduced a bit
of caution to the market," said William Sullivan, director of
money-market research at Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. "If auto
sales had come in weaker, then {dealers} may have decided to
buy the market instead of sell it."</p>
<p>Mr. Sullivan said the price movements were exaggerated by
the market's thin trading condition, which was curbed by the
lingering effect of the Independence holiday on Wednesday and
caution ahead of the jobs data.</p>
<p>Trading typically slows to a crawl on the day before the
release of jobs statistics, and this session was no
exception.</p>
<p>The data are considered the most important of the
government's monthly economic releases because they provide
the first official reading of how the economy fared in a
given month.</p>
<p>Surprises in the report often jar the bond market. The
softer-than-expected May employment report issued on June 1,
for instance, pushed bond prices up more than a full point, a
gain of about $10 for a bond with a $1,000 face amount.</p>
<p>The employment report, however, is taking on more
significance this time because it comes on the heels of the
Federal Reserve's two-day Federal Open Market Committee
meeting that ended Tuesday.</p>
<p>There is speculation that members of the FOMC may have
decided to ease monetary policy if the jobs data point up
extremely sluggish economic growth.</p>
<p>"I think the Fed adopted an asymmetrical directive with a
bias toward easing," said Mr. Liro of S.G. Warburg. But "to
get an immediate ease, you're going to have to need some very
weak numbers" in the jobs report, he adds.</p>
<p>Treasury Securities</p>
<p>Yields rose on long-term and intermediate-term Treasury
securities yesterday, but short-term rates declined due
largely to reports that Bush administration officials are
considering a proposal to impose a tax on the sale of
securities as a way of reducing the budget deficit.</p>
<p>The excise tax would apply to the sale of stocks, options
and debt, but not Treasury securities. Some analysts said
that money was leaving the stock market and flowing into
Treasury bills, which is where some investors park cash
temporarily.</p>
<p>The benchmark 30-year bond ended at a price of about 103
20/32 to yield 8.40% compared with a price of 103 28/32 to
yield 8.38% on Tuesday. The financial markets were closed
Wednesday in observance of Independence Day. The latest
10-year notes ended at a price of 103 1/32 to yield 8.395%,
the price was down from 103 4/32 to yield 8.38% on Tuesday.</p>
<p>But short-term rates were lower. The discount rate on
three-month Treasury bills ended at 7.67% for a
bond-equivalent yield of 7.91%, while the rate on six-month
bills ended at 7.58% to yield 7.97%.</p>
<p>Junk, Corporate Bonds
</p>
<p>The junk bonds of Southland Corp., which operates the
7-Eleven convenience-store chain, rose sharply yesterday on
news that the Securities and Exchange Commission approved its
plan to refinance $1.8 billion in debt and some cumulative
exchangeable preferred stock.</p>
<p>The exchange offers would provide bondholders with debt
securities totalling about $550 million. In addition,
bondholders and preferred shareholders are being offered
approximately 18.5% of Southland's common stock in the
exchange offers. Existing shareholders -- led by the
Dallas-based Thompson family, which founded Southland --
would retain approximately 6.5% of the common stock and,
following consummation of the exchange offers, the Japanese
companies Ito-Yokado and Seven-Eleven Japan would purchase
75% of the stock.</p>
<p>Southland's 16.75% subordinated debentures due in 2002
ended the day up one point at 13. The 15.75% senior
subordinated notes, due in 1997, were unchanged at 23.</p>
<p>The junk bonds of Charter Medical Corp. jumped on news
that the company is considering proposals for the sale and
lease-back of several of its hospitals.</p>
<p>The announcements were an attempt to assure bondholders
that the heavily financed company had the ability to make
interest payments on outstanding debt. The company also said
it was "current with all debt obligations," and added that it
had $50 million in cash and a $30 million line of bank credit
available.</p>
<p>Charter Medical's 14% senior subordinated debentures,
which reached an all-time low of 38 last week, were bid at 40
1/2, up 1/2 point on the day. The company's 14.25%
subordinated debentures ended 1/2 higher at 22.</p>
<p>In the broader market, most junk bonds barely budged from
Tuesday's level in activity that one trader described as "the
slowest day of the year." Prices were also little changed
among investment-grade bonds.</p>
<p>Foreign Bonds</p>
<p>Most major foreign government bonds ended lower yesterday.</p>
<p>British government bonds, called gilts, fell sharply
despite continued firmness in the pound. Traders said
profit-taking by overseas investors was mostly responsible
for the huge price declines.</p>
<p>Selling also stemmed from concern about the government's
budget outlook. Local newspapers reported that the central
government may provide #2.5 billion ($4.44 billion) in
additional grants to municipal governments to discourage
increases in a politically unpopular new local tax charge.</p>
<p>Britain's 11.75% bond due 2003/2007 fell 1 3/32 point to
100 27/32 to yield 11.62% while the 12% notes due in 1995
fell 3/4 point to 99 1/8 to yield 12.26%.</p>
<p>In Japan, prices of government bonds followed the movement
of the yen to lower levels.</p>
<p>At the 3 p.m. JST close of the Tokyo Stock Exchange, the
price of the benchmark 10-year yen bond was 86.85, down 0.10
point to yield 7.22%.</p>
<p>In West Germany, government bonds ended about 0.35 point
weaker in what traders term a technical correction, unrelated
to economic events.</p>
<p>Even the new German Unity Bonds, which were launched on
Wednesday, slipped yesterday. The 10-year 8.75% German Unity
Bond fell 0.40 point to 100.60 to yield 8.66%.</p>
<p>(Foreign bond yields are quoted here in local terms and
therefore differ somewhat from yields calculated for these
markets by U.S. investment firms, which tend to use the
semiannual compound measure to compare yields across
markets.)</p>
<p>Municipal Bonds</p>
<p>Actively traded municipal bonds finished unchanged to 1/4
point higher in snail-paced dealings.</p>
<p>With market participants sluggish after Independence Day
and cautious before Friday's release of the U.S. employment
data for June, there was little action.</p>
<p>But traders say the market is still in good shape because
of talk about tax increases and speculation that Federal
Reserve easing of interest rates is around the bend.</p>
<p>The New Jersey Turnpike Authority's 7.20% securities of
2018 ended 1/8 higher at 98 7/8, pushing the yield down to
7.27% from 7.28% late Tuesday.</p>
<p>Mortgage-Backed Securities</p>
<p>In what turned out to be the expected limp trading day,
mortgage securities prices ended unchanged to slightly
firmer.</p>
<p>Among actively traded secondary issues, Federal Home Loan
Mortgage 9.5% securities for July delivery were unchanged at
98 30/32 and Federal National Mortgage Association 9.5%
securities for July were flat at 99 14/32.</p>
