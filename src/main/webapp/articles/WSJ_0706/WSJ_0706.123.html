	<p class="article-leader">Mannesmann AG of West Germany said profit for the first
six months was "at the same good level of the year earlier,"
when the steel and engineering concern earned 179 million
marks ($108.5 million).
   Chairman Werner Dieter didn't specify first-half earnings
data, but told the annual meeting that sales climbed a
preliminary 8% to 11.1 billion marks from 10.26 billion marks
a year earlier. Excluding sales from Kraus-Maffei, in which
Mannesmann acquired a 71% stake late last year, sales climbed
only 2%, he said. A strong 1989 second half helped boost
annual profit 73% to 505 million marks, on a 9% rise in sales
to 22.3 billion marks.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Separately, Mannesmann said it plans to raise 724.6
million marks through a 1-for-10 issue of new shares. The
2,898,485 new shares, which will be entitled to half the 1990
dividend, will be offered to existing holders at a price of
250 marks apiece, a 30% discount from Mannesmann shares'
closing price yesterday of 360.50 marks on the Frankfurt
Stock Exchange. Mannesmann said the new capital will be used
for the company's further growth.</p>
