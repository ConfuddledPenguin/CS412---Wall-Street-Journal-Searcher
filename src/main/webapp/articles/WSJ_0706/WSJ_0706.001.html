	<p class="article-leader">Boston -- Mark Morris may have been director of dance at
the Theatre Royal de la Monnaie in Brussels since 1988, but
he remains very much part of the U.S. dance scene. One reason
is that for the past two years Boston's Dance Umbrella has
had the wit to invite him and his company, officially called
Monnaie Dance Group/Mark Morris, to show the American public
what they have been up to in Belgium.
   In 1989, Dance Umbrella gave the American premiere of Mr.
Morris's choreographed version of Purcell's opera "Dido and
Aeneas," a daring and revelatory evening-length production
finally brought back to these shores last month by the
Brooklyn Academy of Music. In June of this year, Dance
Umbrella presented the Brussels company in a mixed bill that
included both sets of Brahms's "Love Song Waltzes"; a solo
danced by the choreographer, "Ten Suggestions"; and the
American premiere of a major work, "Behemoth." With this rich
and brilliant program, Mr. Morris reaffirmed his standing, at
the age of 33, as the leading dance creator of his
generation.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>It is important to stress that Mr. Morris's talents
encompass dance in a comprehensive sense, and not simply of
the post-modernist variety. In "Drink to Me Only With Thine
Eyes," which in 1988 gave American Ballet Theatre its most
stimulating new work since Twyla Tharp's "The Little Ballet,"
he showed a thoroughgoing mastery of classical ballet
technique. Not only did he modulate easily from wit to
eloquence, he also showed enough confidence in the form to
enrich its resources without falsifying its nature.</p>
<p>It is, however, not in the U.S., at ABT, but on the other
side of the Atlantic, at the Monnaie, that he has been given
the opportunities he needed to extend his creative reach.
(Since the departure of artistic director Mikhail
Baryshnikov, ABT has apparently shown no sign of interest in
the choreographer.) Not only did the Brussels company supply
him with the complex musical resources, both choral and
orchestral, necessary for full-length projects such as "Dido"
and Handel's "L'Allegro, Il Penseroso ed il Moderato," it has
also enabled him to create a series of diverse and
fascinating works in many styles and moods. During the past
year, these have ranged from the sinister "Wonderland" --
performed to Schoenberg's "Five Pieces for Orchestra" by
guest artists Mikhail Baryshnikov and Rob Besserer -- to the
joyous "Love Song Waltzes" and "New Love Song Waltzes" of
Brahms.</p>
<p>Music is a crucial feature of Mr. Morris's work, not
simply because, in Balanchine's phrase, it provides a floor
for the dancers to walk on, but because for the expatriate
choreographer it is the essential source of new discoveries
about space, time, movement, mood, meaning. His musical
sympathies are astonishingly wide. A devotee of the baroque,
and particularly Bach, Mr. Morris has also used the work of
composers as disparate as Virgil Thomson, Giuseppe Verdi and
Lou Harrison, not to mention groups like The Violent Femmes
and Bob Wills and His Texas Playboys.</p>
<p>Mr. Morris uses music in various ways, sometimes as a
visual realization of the music's spirit and style, and
sometimes as a deliberate contrast to them. In both sets of
"Love Song Waltzes," he translates Brahms's passionate
lyricism into images of emotional susceptibility and
fulfillment. In "Ten Suggestions," on the other hand, he uses
Alexander Tcherepnin's charming "Ten Bagatelles" for a series
of capers mocking pretension and solemnity.</p>
<p>That Mr. Morris should have now created a work,
"Behemoth," danced to silence is hardly as surprising as some
have found it. As one quickly sees, the absence of music is
not the gimmick it is in, say, Jerome Robbins's sentimental
"Moves," but the inevitable response to a special set of
needs. Mr. Morris said in a recent interview that he had
dispensed with music because he couldn't find anything
suitable for his expressive purposes.</p>
<p>These are grim. "Behemoth" is about collective terror,
anxiety, heartlessness. A further investigation into the
nameless fears projected in last season's "Wonderland," it is
also the obverse of "Love Song Waltzes" and, especially, "New
Love Song Waltzes." In those works, love irradiates the
smallest as well as the most expansive of gestures. In
"Behemoth," feeling is submerged in apprehension and
uncertainty. Left for the most part in gloom, the dancers
wear tiny reflective shards, faintly flickering tokens of
their almost extinguished humanity.</p>
<p>In this world, empathy is banished, and survival has
become the highest goal. Seen only as members of a group, the
dancers re-enact the plight of the prisoners in "Fidelio,"
though in existential rather than political terms. Their only
hope is located, not in themselves, not in their fellow
victims, but in some impersonal force beyond the deadening
circumstances of their confinement. As the lights brighten,
the performers raise their hands above their heads in a
gesture of yearning that betokens placation as much as
spiritual dependence. In this state of physical constraint
and emotional desolation, individuals are distinguished only
to emphasize their desperate plight.</p>
<p>Played against the back wall of an undecorated stage,
"Behemoth" offers none of the comforts of theatrical
make-believe. Music, which usually organizes as well as
flavors Mr. Morris's works, here gives way to blankness.
"Behemoth" is not itself a statement of despair, however, but
a picture of despair. Its division into 10 brief segments
implies structure, the existence of providence. The absence
of music, moreover, does not produce silence, but lets us
hear the affecting sound of dancers breathing, jumping,
shuffling and at one point painfully dragging themselves
across the stage.</p>
<p>Americans can next see the Morris company at the Brooklyn
Academy of Music in October, the latter probably with Mr.
Baryshnikov.</p>
