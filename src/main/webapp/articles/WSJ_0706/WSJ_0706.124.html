	<p class="article-leader">Berisford International PLC reported that pretax profit
for the six months ended March 31 skidded 41% to #21.4
million ($38 million) from #36.4 million a year earlier, as
strong earnings in the British conglomerate's main sugar
operations failed to offset losses in its property, commodity
and financial services units.
   Profit before taxes, less minority interests and before
extraordinary items dropped 22% to #16.1 million from #20.8
million. The latest results included a #160.6 million
extraordinary loss, mostly from provisions against
investments in the declining New York property market;
year-earlier extraordinary losses totaled #38.5 million.
Earnings per share fell 23% to 3.3 pence from 4.3 pence. The
net loss attributable to shareholders, after taxes and
special items, widened to #144.5 million from #26.3 million.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Sales rose 10% to #998 million from #907 million.</p>
<p>Berisford said that, given its weak financial position,
the board decided to forgo an interim dividend. A year
earlier, the company paid an interim dividend of 1.8 pence a
share.</p>
