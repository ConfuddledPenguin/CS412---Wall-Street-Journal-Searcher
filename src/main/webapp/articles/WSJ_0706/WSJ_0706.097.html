	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- The Federal Reserve decided not to ease
credit at its meeting this week, despite signs of a slowing
economy, according to government officials.
   The Fed's lack of action was apparent yesterday when the
central bank made no moves to lower short-term interest
rates. However, officials said they believed the directive
approved by the Fed at its meeting earlier this week provided
Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan with the freedom to ease credit
if further signs of economic slowing appeared. A key
indicator of the economy's health comes out this morning when
the Labor Department releases employment figures for June.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The Fed's lack of action prompted an unusual rebuke from
Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady yesterday.</p>
<p>In comment to a small group of reporters, Mr. Brady
argued, "In the U.S., it seems to me, it's not a wise idea to
emphasize an undying, forever attack on inflation if it
jeopardizes growth."</p>
<p>In recent months, the Fed has been unwilling to cut
interest rates because of its continued concern about
inflation. That has led to increasingly loud administration
jawboning for lower interest rates.</p>
<p>"In our opinion, the inflation is in the services area,"
Mr. Brady said. "It's not clear you can get that down to zero
without jeopardizing growth." He acknowledged that "others
feel differently," but he declared, "I think they're wrong."</p>
<p>Troubles with the savings and loans and with real estate
"are becoming more apparent," Mr. Brady continued. "It's
quite clear that they would be helped by lower interest
rates."</p>
<p>An agreement between the White House and Congress to
narrow the deficit could get the Fed to move, according to
Mr. Brady. "I think Chairman Greenspan has indicated that if
we get a budget agreement, he believes interest rates will
come down. I do too." But Mr. Brady added, "I don't think we
should wait around."</p>
<p>Nevertheless, Mr. Brady noted that the Fed "carries on its
own deliberations" and is "an enormously sensible group of
individuals."</p>
