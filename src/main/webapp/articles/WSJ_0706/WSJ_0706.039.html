	<p class="article-leader">SHENZHEN, China -- The fledgling stock market in this
Chinese laboratory of capitalism is facing its first scandal:
an epidemic of outsider trading.
   In Shenzhen, high rollers shun the official stock exchange
in favor of dealing on the street just outside. There, they
speculate feverishly -- and illegally -- forcing stock prices
skyward and arousing concern among China's economic planners,
who still find the notion of stock markets distasteful.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"This is the best place in all of China to make money,"
says Liang Xing, as he works the crowd to find a buyer for
his 10,000-share certificate of Vanke Co., one of Shenzhen's
five publicly listed companies. Mr. Liang says he can make
$45 a day trading, or as much as many Chinese workers earn in
a month. His secret? "I buy low and sell high," he says with
a laugh.</p>
<p>This wasn't what officials envisioned when they opened
Shenzhen's miniature stock exchange two years ago. In
Shenzhen and other select cities, authorities have allowed a
few companies to issue stock to raise investment capital and
help soak up excess savings. While officials have permitted
secondary markets to develop, they have tried to discourage
the wild speculation that fuels trading on Shenzhen's Red
Lychee Avenue, dubbed China's Wall Street by some local
traders.</p>
<p>This year, traders in Shenzhen, a southern Chinese
"special economic zone" adjacent to Hong Kong and susceptible
to the British colony's laissez-faire ways, have engineered
China's first bull market. In the first four months of the
year, Shenzhen traders swapped shares valued at a total of
nearly $13 million, double the value of stock trading in all
of China last year, according to government estimates. Most
Shenzhen transactions occurred on the black market.</p>
<p>The bull market has caused the share prices of Shenzhen's
listed enterprises to surge. Vanke, a manufacturing and
trading concern, made its debut last year by issuing 28
million shares at the equivalent of 21 cents each. Now,
black-market traders are getting as much as 50 cents a share,
an increase of 138%.</p>
<p>Fang Chenli, a young man wearing a T-shirt bearing the
Playboy logo, is trying to sell 1,000 shares of Champagne
Industrial Co. for the equivalent of $3.40 a share. At the
exchange, the posted price is only $3. Black-market buyers
are often willing to pay a premium because it can take more
than a week to receive share certificates from the official
exchange.</p>
<p>The 1,000 shares Mr. Fang is hawking are registered in
someone else's name, but Mr. Fang carries a photocopy of that
person's identity card. Both the 1,000-share certificate and
the ID-card copy have changed hands several times since the
shares were first purchased more than a year ago.</p>
<p>For months, authorities allowed Shenzhen's illegal stock
trading to flourish. But the government's patience is wearing
thin. Last month, authorities called for an end to stock
trading outside the official exchange. For now, government
moves have restrained the black market, but it remains to be
seen if they will succeed in the long run.</p>
<p>"Ours is a stock market with socialist characteristics,"
says Zhou Daozhi, a Shenzhen official of the People's Bank of
China, which oversees share issues. "Socialist
characteristics," Mr. Zhou explains, is code for not allowing
wild price swings and for ensuring that stock tenders don't
exceed 50% of state-owned enterprises.</p>
<p>"The purpose of our stock market is definitely not to
privatize state companies," Mr. Zhou says.</p>
<p>Such statements show how far China has retreated from
plans to use share issues to speed privatization and resolve
the thorny question of business ownership in a socialist
economy. Proponents of reform argue that if state enterprises
are owned by "the whole people," as is the case now in China,
no one has to bear the responsibility for enterprise losses.</p>
<p>Zhao Ziyang, who was sacked as Communist Party chief after
the suppression of last year's pro-democracy movement, once
saw the widespread sale of stock in state-owned enterprises
as a major goal of China's economic reform. Mr. Zhao even
sang the praises of stock markets in a 1988 meeting in
Beijing with conservative U.S. economist Milton Friedman.</p>
<p>Control of the Chinese economy has since passed to more
cautious hands, and many ambitious reform plans have been
scrapped. Beijing's current hard-line government has
criticized Mr. Zhao's meeting with Mr. Friedman as a
precursor to the democracy movement, which Beijing dismisses
as a "counter-revolutionary rebellion."</p>
<p>Shenzhen officials cautiously predict that their stock
market will come to resemble a Western-style stock exchange,
though they say they need time to study how such exchanges
work.</p>
<p>For some tips, they might head out to Red Lychee Avenue
and talk to people like Chan Wing-ming, a 21-year-old office
worker. Mr. Chan has earned a few thousand dollars -- a small
fortune in China -- trading stocks on the street in his spare
time. "Whenever I need money, I come here to trade," he says,
scanning the crowd for potential buyers. "Look, I'd like to
talk more, but I've got to go. Time is money."</p>
