	<p class="article-leader">Management gurus may wail about product quality, customer
service and global markets, but few things worry corporate
America more these days than its workers.
   Even as layoffs continue, demographic changes have
companies expecting shortages of qualified recruits. Many
businesses are trying to do more with fewer employees.
Attention is shifting to recruiting, training and retaining
the most productive people. But staying competitive in pay
and benefits is more costly than ever. And many companies,
fearing an economic downturn and stiffening foreign
competition, are hesitant to promise their workers long-term
security.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Senior executives from five companies traded concerns
about this complex agenda in a roundtable interview with Wall
Street Journal reporters Gilbert Fuchsberg and Amanda Bennett
at last week's convention of the Society for Human Resource
Management. The executives all fretted about health-care
costs and the prospect of new hiring and firing constraints
arising from the civil-rights bill now pending in Congress.
But they disagreed on whether loyalty will rise again in the
'90s as a popular commodity in factories and offices.
Highlights from the discussion follow, grouped by topic.</p>
<p>BENEFITS MUST GO, NOT GROW</p>
<p>MICHAEL R. LOSEY, president, human resources, Unisys
Corp.: The issue is cost. Human resources isn't just
delivering programs. It's minimizing cost. And most cost in
most companies walks with two feet.</p>
<p>WILLIAM F. WAYLAND, executive vice president, human
resources, Textron Inc.: I believe {health care} is the
single most important cost issue the human-resource
profession will have to deal with. We are paying $3,200 or
$3,300 or $3,500 a year per employee, and the Japanese are
paying virtually nothing.</p>
<p>Go back to the auto companies in the late '60s and '70s.
From basic health-care coverage, prescription drugs were
added, and mental health was added, and then dental was
added, and then hearing was added and then legal fees were
added. Then they started peeling them away again. The legal
is disappearing, and the vision is beginning to disappear.</p>
<p>W. THOMAS VAN ETTEN, senior vice president, human
resources, Sun Bank/Miami N.A.: We spend a lot of time trying
to educate supervisors and managers to the fact that we write
off that PC over a four- to five-year depreciation schedule.
But as soon as you hire somebody, you've got a {growing}
expense that's there for life. You're going to pay them more,
spend more for benefits, give them more vacation. Are we
getting a return on that investment?</p>
<p>MORE LAYOFFS INEVITABLE</p>
<p>MR. LOSEY: {When Burroughs merged with Sperry to form
Unisys,} we had 125,000 people; today I have 78,000. General
Motors has fewer people {than in the past}, IBM has fewer
people, Apple has fewer people. I don't know a company that
isn't downsizing.</p>
<p>MR. VAN ETTEN: I see companies downsizing as they grow {in
sales}. They will continue to grow but hold the line on
management as long as they possibly can.</p>
<p>JAMES A. PERKINS, senior vice president, personnel,
Federal Express Corp.: {Many recent layoffs happened} because
the company lost market share or suffered some kind of
setback. It's in everyone's best interest -- the employees,
the stockholders, management and everyone -- to improve
productivity. We're growing, but I think the common problem
that we all face {is} tremendous pressure because of
competitiveness to continue to improve quality and
productivity and lower the cost to the customer.</p>
<p>LOYALTY IS THREATENED</p>
<p>MR. WAYLAND: I don't think we will see a lot of allegiance
to companies. We will see that whittled away. There will be
more portability. There's going to be that much more of a
demand for talent. I think we're going to be able to attract
and keep the shop-floor worker in small-town America. But the
technical people and the management people I think are going
to move. I think we're going to go back to the 1950s, when
people moved from location to location.</p>
<p>WANDA A. LEE, corporate vice president, human resources,
FHP Inc.: I think you're going to see more use of independent
contractors {who} come in and stay for six months. You won't
treat that person as an employee. You're going to treat them
as a vendor, which is probably how they're paid. So you're
going to have a shifting work force. Not that you wouldn't
prefer to keep {employees}, but maybe you wouldn't because
maybe there is no growth for them and they're going to become
dissatisfied. I see companies that are also saying let's get
into career development, recognizing that chances are, the
freedom to leave can become the freedom to stay.
</p>
<p>MR. PERKINS: The trend in the future will be a reversion
to the past. I think {employees} really want a long-term,
trusting relationship with their company. They really want to
have a history and a pride. But I don't think any longer the
employee can go to work with the idea of trying to decide how
they can do less. Instead, it has to be a mindset that they
need to able to do and produce more.</p>
<p>PRODUCTIVITY IS A PUZZLE</p>
<p>MR. PERKINS: I think there is an increasing awareness that
a company's human resources {are} a competitive weapon. There
is an awareness that well-trained, highly motivated employees
really can make a difference in terms of improved
productivity, improved quality.</p>
<p>MS. LEE: Machines used to do a lot of the work, and what
did you do? You improved the way the machine could function
so that it could function better with less power. {That's}
what we haven't learned how to do with people. How can you
help people produce more by helping them work smarter, not
harder? That's the new model that we have to develop. Over
the next 10 years we'll have no choice but to learn how to
measure productivity in an information age. But we're not
there now.</p>
<p>CIVIL RIGHTS REVISITED</p>
<p>MR. PERKINS: As the new {civil rights} legislation is
written, people will be allowed to sue for pain and suffering
and punitive damages {when alleging that they were denied a
job or promotion because of discrimination}. What should a
company do {if}, out of 50,000 managers, there is one manager
who discriminates against an individual? Under the new
legislation, the person will be able to sue for punitive
damages -- and how much are we talking about here? Are we
talking about a couple of hundred dollars or are we talking
about several million dollars?</p>
<p>MS. LEE: I think we all believe in equal employment
opportunity, but the way that this is designed . . . benefits
attorneys more than anyone else.</p>
<p>MR. VAN ETTEN: We are going to be looking at a labor
shortage. It's already here. Who wants to discriminate
against anybody as long as they are properly trained,
educated, alert and ready to work?</p>
