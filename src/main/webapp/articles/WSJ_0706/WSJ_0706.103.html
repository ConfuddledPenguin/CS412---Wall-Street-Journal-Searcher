	<p class="article-leader">Northern Telecom Ltd., in a continuing effort to
streamline operations, said it will close a small
manufacturing facility in St. John, New Brunswick, by
November.
   The facility, which employs 122 people and has been
operating since 1945, manufactures inductors and transformers
used in older technology telecommunications equipment. The
shutdown will bring to four the number of facilities
Toronto-based Northern has closed since 1988.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"The business for those parts {made in St. John} has gone
away as the technology changed," a spokesman said. "Some
production will be absorbed into locations where we have
overcapacity."</p>
<p>He said some workers can try out for sales positions in a
new customer center Northern plans to open in St. John by
year end. For employees who don't stay, Northern has set
aside $5 million, most of which will be used for severance
pay and to aid relocation and retraining.</p>
