	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- The stock market decisively broke its longest
winning streak in two months, as prices finished broadly and
sharply lower in light, post-holiday trading.
   Profit-taking in advance of today's release of June
employment data, coupled with several rounds of
futures-related selling, sent the Dow Jones Industrial
Average tumbling 32.42 points to 2879.21. This was the
largest decline since June 22, when the Dow industrials
slipped more than 44.35 points.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>News that aides to President Bush are considering a
possible tax of as much as 0.5% on securities sales
"overshadowed the market," said Richard Meyer, head of
institutional trading at Ladenburg, Thalmann & Co. Though
traders refused to attribute the market's decline solely to
the tax issue, they said some big institutions now will
increase hedges on stock positions by selling futures, for
example, to insulate portfolios from the day-to-day swings
that might come from Washington's tax debate.</p>
<p>Prices had finished higher in each of the previous five
sessions, with the Dow industrials gaining a total of 69.30
points, or 2.4%, in that period. The performance was the
market's best since the average posted seven consecutive
advances in a late April-early May rally.</p>
<p>Traders reported little demand to support prices, because
many institutional investors remained on vacation after the
July Fourth holiday.</p>
<p>Also, uncertainty about the outcome of today's employment
report kept buyers on the sidelines. Though the June data is
generally expected to show a modest pickup in job creation,
some expect to see signs of economic weakness, which could
prompt the Federal Reserve to lower interest rates.</p>
<p>The report is expected to show that nonfarm payrolls rose
83,000 overall and went up 132,000 after excluding the
layoffs of temporary census workers, according to a consensus
of economists polled by Dow Jones. Payrolls rose 164,000 in
May, but the hiring of census takers accounted for 145,000 of
the increase.</p>
<p>Declining stocks routed advancers on the New York Stock
Exchange by 1,058 to 397.</p>
<p>The breadth of the sell-off also could be seen in the
declines in broad averages. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock
index fell 4.48 to 355.68, the Dow Jones Equity Market Index
lost 3.69 to 331.03, and the New York Stock Exchange
composite index tumbled 2.16 to 194.45.</p>
<p>Big Board volume dropped to 128,320,000 shares from
130,050,000 shares on Tuesday.</p>
<p>The "mediocre up market" of the past five sessions gave
way to "some profit-takers, ready to cash in" after the
advance, said David Holt, director of technical research at
Wedbush Morgan Securities, Los Angeles.</p>
<p>At least four rounds of sell programs tied to stock-index
arbitrage hit the market during the session, putting further
pressure on share prices. The first two flurries struck
within the first half-hour of trading, when the Dow
industrials dropped more than 23 points.</p>
<p>The market's leaders over the course of its rally-growth
stocks and consumer issues with a history of steady earnings
improvement -- weren't spared from the sell-off. Philip
Morris dropped 1/2 to 47 1/2 in New York Stock Exchange
composite trading of 1.7 million shares, Merck dropped 1 1/2
to 86 1/8, Coca-Cola went down 5/8 to 44 1/4 and General
Electric slid 7/8 to 70 1/4 on slightly more than one million
shares.</p>
<p>Auto stocks were hit especially hard, even though
late-June sales reports showed that U.S. car sales climbed to
their highest levels since February. General Motors fell 1
1/8 to 47 1/4 and Ford Motor slid 1 to 44, while Chrysler
eased 1/4 to 15 1/4.</p>
<p>Avon Products placed first on the Big Board's list of most
active issues, as the result of a block trade of 3.98 million
shares, or 7% of the Avon shares outstanding. Chartwell
Associates bought the block from a partnership of the
investor Irwin Jacobs and Amway. Chartwell said its partners,
who include the investor Gordon Getty and the Fisher brothers
of New York, plan to buy an additional 1.2 million Avon
shares from the Jacobs-Amway partnership within the next 30
days. The stock lost 3/4 to 37 on composite volume of 4.7
million shares.</p>
<p>Panhandle Eastern fell 2 1/8 to 21 3/8, on 1.4 million
shares, reflecting speculation that the company may reduce
its dividend as a result of lower-than-expected natural gas
prices and its heavy debt load from its acquisition last year
of Texas Eastern. Panhandle, which previously said it
wouldn't lower the annual dividend of $2 a share, declined to
comment on the latest talk, but said its board "is expected
to thoroughly review" the payout policy at its July 25
meeting.</p>
<p>Genentech went up 1/2 to 29, on 1.2 million shares, and
Eli Lilly gained 1 1/2 to 86 1/4, following the release of a
study that found that elderly men can benefit from regular
injections of human growth hormone, produced by both
companies. Researchers in Wisconsin found that the drug can
reverse atrophying of muscles and increases in fat tissue.</p>
<p>Another drug stock that avoided being caught in the
market's sell-off was Rorer Group, which rose 1 to 72 5/8.
Standard & Poor's upgraded ratings on Rorer's debt issues to
reflect the company's planned merger with Rhone-Poulenc of
France.</p>
<p>Gulf States Utilities added 1/8 to 11. Moody's Investors
Service placed its ratings on the company's long-term debt
and preferred stock under review for a possible upgrade,
citing Gulf States' tentative agreement to resolve a dispute
about power purchases from Southern Co.</p>
<p>British Steel dropped 7/8 to 24 3/8, on 2.6 million
shares, with a set of dividend-related trades by institutions
accounting for the bulk of the volume. The stock has a 5.1%
dividend yield, and stock of record tomorrow will receive the
next quarterly payout.</p>
<p>McDonnell Douglas climbed 1 7/8 to 40 7/8, amid
indications the U.S. and South Korean governments have
resolved differences that had blocked a proposed sale of the
company's F/A-18 fighters to South Korea.</p>
<p>Motel Six, buoyed by recent speculation that Kohlberg
Kravis Roberts may sell its 53% stake in the partnership,
went up 1/2 to 17 7/8 in active trading. KKR declined to
comment on its plans.</p>
<p>HomeFed fell 1 1/4 to 19 5/8, but closed well above its
intraday low of 18. The bounce came after Merrill Lynch
upgraded its short-term investment rating on the stock to
"hold" from "below average," citing its drop in price.</p>
<p>Waban gained 3/8 to 8 1/8 and Circuit City Stores added
1/4 to 26 7/8, after releasing June sales reports. Waban's
sales rose 19% from a year earlier, and sales at Circuit City
rose 23% overall and 6% for stores open at least one year.</p>
<p>Tootsie Roll Industries gained 1 1/8 to 48 3/8, setting a
52-week high for the third consecutive session. Prescott,
Ball & Turben featured the stock in the latest monthly issue
of Investor News, a newsletter sent to the firm's clients on
Monday. Elliott Schlang, an analyst, said his price target
for Tootsie Roll over the next six months is $52 a share.</p>
<p>The American Stock Exchange Market Value Index fell 2.18
to 358.49. Amex volume totaled about 8,520,000 shares,
compared with about 11,730,000 a day earlier. Declining
issues outnumbered those advancing, 321 to 216, and 234
finished unchanged.</p>
