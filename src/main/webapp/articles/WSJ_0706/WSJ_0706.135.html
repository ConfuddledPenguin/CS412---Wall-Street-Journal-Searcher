	<p class="article-leader">NATO AGREED to revise its defense policy in view of
changes in the East bloc.
   On the first day of a two-day London summit, the Western
allies generally accepted a proposal by Bush to declare that
NATO will use nuclear weapons only as a "last resort," U.S.
officials said. The allies also agreed to an American
proposal for inviting Soviet leader Gorbachev to address an
alliance meeting. The invitation would be a way of showing
that the group wants to enter an era of cooperation with its
adversaries in Eastern Europe. The U.S. and Bonn apparently
reached a compromise on a pledge for cutting back the army of
a newly united Germany.</p>

to fear from allowing a unified Germany to become a full
member of the revamped organization.</p>

<p>Albania's foreign ministry pledged to grant passports to
the hundreds of Albanians who have sought refuge in foreign
embassies in the capital in an effort to flee their Communist
homeland. The ministry appeared to deny a report that
Albanians would no longer be able to apply for visas. The
number of asylum-seekers rose to 600.</p>

<p>Gorbachev appeared to have staked an unassailable claim to
remain head of the Soviet Communist Party as critics
attending a party congress showed no indications of fielding
any alternative candidates. The Soviet leader is facing
re-election when the meeting comes to a conclusion next week.</p>

<p>Czechoslovakia's Parliament re-elected Havel as president.
The election of the former dissident playwright to a two-year
term culminated a seven-month transition to democratic rule.
Havel had served as interim president after last year's
peaceful revolution toppling the Communists. The Parliament
was voted into office last month.</p>

<p>Israel's defense minister said he would cut troops in the
occupied territories if violence eased in the 30-month-old
Palestinian uprising. Arens, who was named to his post last
month, made the comment during a tour of the Israeli-occupied
Gaza Strip.</p>

<p>Poland's agriculture minister resigned in anticipation of
a major cabinet shake-up by leader Mazowiecki, who is under
pressure to dismiss holdover Communists from key posts. A
government spokeswoman indicated the prime minister would
announce policy changes today, but she declined to say how
many ministers would be ousted.</p>

<p>India's governor in Kashmir gave security forces sweeping
powers in their battle to quell a separatist revolt in the
strife-torn region, where at least 700 people have been
killed in six months. Leaders of the protests in Kashmir,
India's only Moslem-majority state, have been demanding
independence or annexation by neighboring Pakistan.</p>

<p>The U.S. and Britain plan to argue at next week's economic
summit in Houston that a controversial plan for $15 billion
in international aid to the Soviet Union is premature.
Surprisingly, leading Soviet economists and officials agree.
They say the help would be welcome, but that the country
isn't ready to absorb it.</p>

<p>Kenyan police detained three more prominent individuals
linked to recent calls for a legalized opposition in the
one-party state. The detentions of a former vice president's
son and two lawyers brought to 10 the number of people seized
in a two-day sweep.</p>

<p>Defense attorneys filed an appeal in a Massachusetts court
on behalf of David and Ginger Twitchell, a Christian Science
couple found guilty Wednesday of manslaughter for withholding
medical treatment from their son, who died in 1986 of a bowel
infection. The couple, who said they relied on spiritual
healing, face up to 20 years in prison.</p>

<p>Colombian security forces seized about 800 pounds of pure
cocaine at an airport in northwestern Colombia as a wave of
drug-related terrorism intensified in major cities, officials
said. The cocaine was found aboard an airplane that was about
to take off for the U.S., according to an army statement.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>About 5,300 rebels fought Liberian troops in Monrovia's
suburbs, according to an insurgent source, while soldiers
ransacked stores and restaurants in the capital. More
government advisers left the country as Doe clung desperately
to power. The president has shown no sign of departing and
has rejected a U.S. offer to help him flee.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>Serbian authorities dissolved the local legislature and
government in Kosovo, the troubled southern province
administered by Yugoslavia's largest republic. Serbian
officials also acted to gain control of Kosovo's media. The
moves came in the wake of Monday's independence declaration
by ethnic Albanian deputies in the local assembly.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>Sri Lankan troops shot and killed 27 Tamil rebels in a new
wave of violence in the northern and eastern parts of the
Indian Ocean island, and the government said it planned to
hold new elections in Tamil-dominated areas. At least 14
soldiers were also killed in rebel attacks. The guerrillas
launched their latest offensive June 11.</p>
