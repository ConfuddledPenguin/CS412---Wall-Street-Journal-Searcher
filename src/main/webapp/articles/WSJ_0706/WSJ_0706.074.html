	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- The Conference Board reported that its index
of help-wanted advertising continued its steady decline in
May, slipping two points to its lowest level in four years.
   The independent business research group said the index
fell to 137 in May, down from April's revised 139. The index
lags 15 points behind the year-earlier level of 152. The
index is based on a survey of help-wanted advertising volume
in 51 major newspapers.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Conference Board economist Ken Goldstein said, "The word
`cautious' best describes the labor market right now. There
is a definite softness in demand." The index, a seasonally
adjusted indicator of hiring plans, uses 1967 as a base of
100.</p>
<p>Despite increases of 7.5% in the South Atlantic region,
2.6% in the West South Central region and 0.6% in the East
South Central region, the remaining six regions of the
country showed declines in May from the April level.</p>
<p>The most severe declines continue to be in New England and
the Middle Atlantic regions. Both were down about 9% in their
regional indices in the past two months, and both recorded
steep declines in help-wanted ad volume, by about 33% and
20%, respectively, from year-earlier levels.</p>
<p>Still, Mr. Goldstein expects a "turnaround," first in the
Western labor markets and then eastward, spurred by export
activity in the second half of this year.</p>
