	<p class="article-leader">FRANKFURT, West Germany -- West German production of raw
steel in the first half fell 6.7% to 19.38 million metric
tons, compared with a year earlier, the Federal Statistics
Office said. A metric ton is equal to about 2,204.62 pounds.
   First-half output of raw iron declined 8.2% to 15.28
million metric tons.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>In June, the country produced slightly more than three
million metric tons of raw steel, down 12% from a year
earlier, and smelters made 9.8% less raw iron at 2.4 million
tons.</p>
<p>Steel and iron production in West Germany has been soft
this year, in part because end users in some sectors
stockpiled supplies last year.</p>
