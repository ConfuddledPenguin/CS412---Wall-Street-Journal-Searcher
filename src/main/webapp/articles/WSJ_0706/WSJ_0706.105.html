	<p class="article-leader">VANCOUVER, British Columbia -- Placer Dome Inc. said it
raised its stake in Stikine Resources Ltd. to just 45.3% from
45%, under an extended 67.50 Canadian dollar (US$58.09) a
share tender offer that expired late Wednesday.
   The bid result leaves control of Stikine, half-owner of
British Columbia's rich Eskay Creek gold project, undecided.
Placer Dome's spokesman said a 6.1% block of Stikine shares
that a Toronto arbitrage firm disclosed it held last month
wasn't tendered to the offer.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"We're examining our options," in light of the bid
results, the spokesman said. "We need to knock on some doors
to try to pry loose" the remaining Stikine shares, he said.</p>
<p>Placer Dome's rival, Toronto-based Corona Corp., owns 3%
of Stikine and has agreed to acquire a further 42% of the
company from its principal shareholders. Pending regulatory
approval, Corona further plans an offer to acquire all
Stikine shares that aren't held by Placer Dome.</p>
<p>Corona currently owns a 34% voting stake in Prime
Resources Group Inc., Stikine's Eskay Creek partner.</p>
<p>Placer Dome and Corona, both major gold producers, have
been battling for control of Eskay Creek, though Corona said
earlier this week it will pursue talks with Placer Dome that
could lead to joint ownership of the gold property. Placer
Dome's spokesman said it would "look favorably" on talks with
Corona.</p>
<p>In Toronto Stock Exchange trading yesterday, Stikine
closed at C$71 a share, up C$1. Placer Dome's shares closed
at C$18.25 each, down 37.5 Canadian cents, and Corona's Class
A shares closed at C$7.375 each, down 25 cents.</p>
