	<p class="article-leader">Millipore Corp. said sales from its continuing lines of
business grew 12% in the second quarter compared with the
year-ago period, while sales in the first half grew 11% from
a year earlier.
   Millipore said the growth rates exclude results from its
process water division, which was sold in November.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Including results from the process water division,
Millipore said, sales growth was 4% over the year-ago quarter
and 3% over the year-earlier six months. Had currency
exchange rates remained constant in 1989 and 1990, Millipore
said, its growth rate, excluding results for the sold
division, would have been 10% for both the quarter and first
half.</p>
<p>For the 1989 second quarter, Millipore had net income of
$13.5 million, or 48 cents a share, on sales of $167 million.
For the first half, Millipore had net income of $25.9
million, or 93 cents a share, on sales of $327.8 million.</p>
<p>Millipore, a Bedford, Mass., analytical and purification
products concern, will release its second quarter results
later this month.</p>
