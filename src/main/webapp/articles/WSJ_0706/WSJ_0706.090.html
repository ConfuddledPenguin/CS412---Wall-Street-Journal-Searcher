	<p class="article-leader">Peter Thompson, chairman of British & Commonwealth
Holdings PLC, resigned yesterday, a company statement said.
   The one-line statement said only that the official had
resigned as a director of the London financial services
concern.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Company officials weren't immediately available for
comment.</p>
<p>Philip Arkless, company secretary, later said the
resignation was effective July 2. He said Mr. Thompson hadn't
given a reason for his departure in his letter of
resignation.</p>
<p>Mr. Arkless also said it wasn't clear at this stage
whether Mr. Thompson would be replaced, given the company's
"unusual circumstances."</p>
<p>British & Commonwealth is under the administration of
Price Waterhouse given its inability to raise bank financing
last month.</p>
