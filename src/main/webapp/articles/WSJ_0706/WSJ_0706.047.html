	<p class="article-leader">Michael D. Copeland's June 7 editorial-page article, "No
Red Squirrels? Mother Nature May Be Better Off," says that
the use by environmentalists of the Endangered Species Act
"is often a subterfuge for achieving other goals, such as the
prevention of development."
   Subterfuge, as I understand it, implies dishonesty at
worst, evasion at best. It doesn't fit. We use the Endangered
Species Act -- along with the National Environmental Policy
Act, the Clean Water Act, the Clean Air Act and scores of
other laws -- to achieve environmental protection.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Mr. Copeland attacked my colleague Andy Stahl for
acknowledging that the spotted owl was a useful ally in the
campaign to save a little of the pitiful remnant of
old-growth forest that still stands in the Pacific Northwest.
"Evidently, Mr. Stahl is more concerned with old-growth
timber than with the spotted owl," wrote Mr. Copeland, as if
that were a crime. Of course our goal is to protect old
growth: You can't have spotted owls without it. No one has
ever denied, to my knowledge, that we are in favor of
preserving old growth.</p>
<p>Mr. Copeland exhibits considerable bravery in advocating
the extinction of species we know very little about. Bravery?
Make that arrogance. Historic extinctions caused by nature
are not necessarily equivalent to extinctions caused by man.
The latter reflect decidedly unnatural upsets and imbalances
in natural systems that we perpetuate at our peril.</p>

<p>Using Mr. Copeland's logic, it could be argued that the
world would be better off without giant pandas, California
condors, the American bald eagle and developmentally disabled
people. Just who is to decide what species (or class) should
be sacrificed?</p>
<p>Perhaps he should note that the past extinction of species
as a natural byproduct of evolution was not generally
something that happened overnight as a result of some
developer's whim or greed.</p>

<p>I take exception to Mr. Copeland's contention that many of
the world's species are irrelevant since they stand in the
way of development projects.</p>
<p>He makes two specious arguments. The first is that natural
mass extinctions, such as that of the dinosaurs, permit the
human race to extinguish more species or certain subspecies.
I assert on moral grounds that the human race has no such
right. Mr. Copeland's second argument is that biological
diversity, such as the existence of subspecies within one
species, is of no value. That argument is in serious error,
as demonstrated by the medical-research value of certain
species to humans as well as the interdependence of various
species within certain ecological systems. In certain cases,
the loss of one species can cause the collapse of an entire
system.</p>
<p>In conclusion, I agree that development decisions should
not be totally blocked due to ecological considerations.
However, such development must clearly carry the burden of
proof that species extinction would not be the result. A
mountaintop observatory is not worth the extinction of any
species.</p>

<p>In response to Mr. Copeland's squirrel bashing and
greed-motivated rationalizations on the future of endangered
species, he quotes Harvard Prof. Stephen Gould on his
assessments of mass extinctions through time, stating that
today's species represent less than 1% of all species that
have ever existed. Extinctions of species through time were
caused by natural forces, before man ever walked on this
earth. Man is omnipotent when it comes to survival. He can
easily wipe out anything of his choosing. If we allow bending
of the rules of the Endangered Species Act, when would it
stop? We should be doing all we can to save that 1%.</p>

<p>Mr. Copeland's critique relies on arguments that belittle
the benefits of "individual animal or plant categories." We
can test the persuasiveness of those arguments if we
substitute the phrase "individual humans or class of humans"
for "individual animal or plant categories" and if we imagine
Mr. Copeland is not disputing the wisdom of this law, but
rather the wisdom of laws against murder and genocide.</p>
<p>His assertions could then be paraphrased as follows: (1)
More than 95% of all humans who have ever lived are now dead;
(2) despite these many deaths, the human population is
actually increasing, past deaths making room for present
numbers; (3) nature obviously entails death as well as life,
so we may be wasting time, effort and money on humans who
will die over time regardless of our efforts; (4) human
traits that have helped folks survive in the past are not
particularly important to future longevity, so preserving
lives will not necessarily increase the life span of folks to
come.</p>
<p>All these statements may be true. They are not necessarily
meaningful, however. They fail regarding human exterminations
for the same two reasons Mr. Copeland's arguments fail
regarding animal extinctions. First, he implicitly assumes
that teleological benefit-cost ethics are the only ones
relevant to decision-making in this case. Such ethics serve
nonmoral ends such as consumer welfare. He ignores imperative
ethics that find rightness or wrongness intrinsic to deeds
themselves, e.g., "Thou shalt not kill."</p>
<p>Mr. Copeland could defend himself by saying that
imperative ethics should be ignored when it comes to keeping
people alive; that we should, for example, calculate the
benefits before spending added costs of, say $300 billion a
year on more medical care for the expiring elderly; and that
imperative ethics should likewise be ignored for species
preservation. This would be a good answer for Mr. Copeland if
by "species preservation" he meant efforts to keep alive
species that would die naturally from causes unrelated to
mankind's actions, just as it is a good argument when
considering health care for hopelessly ill humans. But we are
not talking about "species preservation" in this sense, which
brings us to the second flaw.</p>
<p>The Endangered Species Act attempts to outlaw
exterminations of species insofar as they are caused by human
overharvesting or habitat destruction. People may find
imperative ethics useful here -- even imperative. Such ethics
are useful in assessing the genocide of the Tasmanian
Aborigines and our laws against the painful slaughter of
animals, not to mention more obvious matters. Similarly, the
Endangered Species Act reflects our attempt to apply
imperative ethics to the way we treat other species, not the
way Mother Nature treats them.</p>
<p>These distinctions are critical. If Mr. Copeland could
convince us that the conscious taking of life forever lies on
the same moral plane as letting it expire naturally, then
teleological ethics might overrule imperative ethics, and his
arguments depreciating the benefits of individual species
might be meaningful.</p>
