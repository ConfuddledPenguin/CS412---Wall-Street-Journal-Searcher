	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- Ernst & Young was barred by an
administrative law judge of the Securities and Exchange
Commission for 45 days from taking any new accounting
business at its New York regional offices for alleged
"improper professional conduct" in audits done by a
predecessor firm.
   The order by administrative law judge Jerome K. Soffer was
effective June 28, its issue date. The SEC's accounting
division previously alleged that work done by Ernst & Whinney
for U.S. Surgical Corp. in 1980 and 1981 resulted in
unqualified audit reports on statements that significantly
overstated U.S. Surgical's income. Ernst & Whinney merged
last year with Arthur Young & Co.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>In addition, the administrative order censured Michael L.
Ferrante, managing partner of Ernst & Young's office in White
Plains, N.Y., who was the firm's partner supervising the
audits of U.S. Surgical, a Norwalk, Conn.-based maker of
surgical stapling devices. The order doesn't affect the
firm's work begun prior to June 28.</p>
<p>An Ernst & Young spokesman in New York said, "This is a
very old matter in which civil litigation was concluded many
years ago without any payment from the firm. We feel that
after almost 10 years, it is time to put the matter behind
us." He said the bar was only for new clients that are
subject to SEC reporting requirements and only affected audit
work. Calls to Mr. Ferrante at the White Plains office were
referred back to Ernst & Young's main office.</p>
<p>One expert on the accounting profession said he saw little
if any practical harm to Ernst & Young. "Clients or potential
clients will only wait" until the 45 days runs out, said Jim
Emerson, editor of the Professional Services Report in
Seattle, which monitors the accounting profession. "The only
injury is going to be negative visibility, which is not
helpful in light of other things, like the S&L crisis. The
climate right now is very touchy" with accounting firms, he
said.</p>
