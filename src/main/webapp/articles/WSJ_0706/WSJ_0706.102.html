	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- The Securities and Exchange Commission's staff
has opened the door a little wider for accounting firms to do
more consulting work for their auditing clients.
   The SEC staff ruled that Arthur Andersen could do
consulting work for a client it audits because the accounting
firm had separated its auditing and consulting businesses,
avoiding a potential conflict of interest. Although the
decision doesn't alter existing rules regarding auditors'
independence, it could have broad implications for other
accounting firms, which increasingly have been doing
consulting work as part of their overall business.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The ruling came in response to a request by Arthur
Andersen to have the relationship between its auditing
clients and Andersen Consulting be considered indirect and
therefore allowable. The Andersen consulting business, which
previously was part of the accounting firm, was separated
last year in a restructuring under which they both report to
a parent firm in Switzerland, Arthur Andersen & Co. S.C.
Andersen, of all the big U.S. accounting firms, has the
largest consulting business, with about 40% of the world-wide
company's revenue coming from consulting. For most other big
U.S. accounting firms, consulting work accounts for between
15% and 25% of overall revenue.</p>
<p>The ruling probably will increase competition for
consulting contracts between accounting firms and firms that
derive their business solely from consulting, which often
involves computer systems networks. And it comes at a time
when accountants are being criticized for not being tough
enough on some of their auditing clients, particularly in
light of the savings and loan crisis. Some critics wonder
whether the ruling will only further impair the independence
of auditors.</p>
<p>The ruling represents "another barrier falling" between
the traditional separation of accounting and consulting, said
David Lord, managing editor of Consultants News, a trade
publication. "For the purists in this field, it's an absolute
outrage."</p>
<p>The American Institute of Certified Public Accountants,
the major professional body for U.S. accountants, recently
effectively allowed its members to accept contingent fees and
commissions from non-audit clients, which softened the
division between auditing and consulting. In that case, an
accountant might recommend a client purchase a financial
instrument to improve a company's health, then take a
commission on the advice.</p>
<p>In its ruling, the SEC staff concluded that as a result of
Andersen's restructuring, business relationships between
Andersen Consulting and auditing clients of Arthur Andersen
wouldn't violate independence rules for accountants as long
as the individual contract relationships have no material
effect on any of the parties. The standard for what
constitutes "material" is subject to interpretation, but it
is generally regarded as having a "significant" effect on net
income.</p>
<p>The ruling represents somewhat of a turnabout for the SEC,
which rejected a similar petition by Andersen and two other
firms in December 1988. But the latest Andersen petition
"represented a different set of facts," said Edmund Coulson,
chief accountant of the SEC. Mr. Coulson said that Andersen
"undertook a fairly significant change" in the way it does
business because of the restructuring, and that influenced
the latest ruling.</p>
<p>The existing SEC rules on independence prohibit direct or
materially indirect business relationships between an auditor
and its clients. Accounting firms have maintained that doing
consulting work for their auditing clients doesn't impair
their independence, and that audit and consulting functions
are kept at arm's length, said Arthur W. Bowman, editor of
Bowman's Accounting Report. Accounting firms had circumvented
the rules by avoiding certain relationships expressly
prohibited.</p>
<p>Mr. Bowman said that last year, although about 88% of the
Andersen accounting firm's clients didn't use the firm for
consulting work, about 23% of the consulting firm's business
came from auditing clients, and that may happen more as a
result of the ruling. In its fiscal year ended Aug. 31, 1989,
before the restructuring, Andersen derived $1.94 billion of
revenue from accounting, auditing and tax work and $1.44
billion of revenue from consulting work.</p>
<p>The ruling "is great for the accounting profession, and
makes it easier to generate cross-selling revenue," Mr.
Bowman said.</p>
<p>Indeed, the ruling will "reduce a lot of concerns among
audit clients who have not been able to joint venture with
our consulting arm," said Lawrence Weinbach, managing partner
and chief executive of the Arthur Andersen parent company.</p>
<p>The SEC's Mr. Coulson declined to predict whether other
firms would follow Andersen's lead in restructuring. Although
Mr. Weinbach said he expected other accounting firms would
have to "seriously look at their structure" in the wake of
the ruling, he said the Andersen restructuring didn't occur
because of the SEC's previous rejection of its petition. The
two other accounting firms that joined Andersen in the
earlier petition declined to comment.</p>
<p>The latest ruling comes amid a larger study of auditors'
independence being conducted by the SEC. The study arose in
part from efforts of major accounting firms to ease some of
the conflict-of-interest rules for auditors in joint ventures
with clients, including the narrower issue examined in the
Andersen case.</p>
<p>The ruling is "interesting" because it may be "charting a
new course in the area of independence," said Gary Previts,
professor of accountancy at Case Western Reserve University
in Cleveland. "Materiality isn't so much the issue as is the
objectivity that exists not only in the mind of the auditor
but in the eyes of society," Prof. Previts said.</p>
