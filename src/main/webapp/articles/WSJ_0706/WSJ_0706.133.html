	<p class="article-leader">A NEW ENERGY TAX is being pushed by the Bush
administration as a way to help cut the budget deficit. The
levy would bring in an estimated $20 billion a year, more
than any other part of the revenue-raising package being
considered. The tax would apply to various sources of energy,
including coal and petroleum, and would add five or six cents
a gallon to the price of gasoline.

	<div class="article-body"><p>Japanese auto makers grabbed a record 28% share of U.S.
car sales in the first half of 1990. Sales of North
American-made autos, meanwhile, surged 11.9% in late June to
their highest rate in six months.</p>

<p>Hughes Aircraft Chairman Malcolm Currie received some of
the classified data illicitly obtained by a defense-industry
ring, court records assert. But a criminal probe of the GM
subsidiary's top officer seems unlikely to lead to an
indictment.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>Thrift regulators brought administrative charges against
former Columbia chief Thomas Spiegel. They are seeking $24
million for an alleged spending spree with insured deposits.</p>
<p>Charges against Bush's son, an ex-director of a failed
S&L, will be heard in public, the government announced.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>Avon holders Irwin Jacobs and Amway sold most of their
stake to two Chartwell Associates partners. The deal appears
to give Chartwell, which includes a Mary Kay officer, more
leverage with Avon managers.</p>

fell 32.42 points. Bond prices also sank, and the dollar was
mixed.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>The Federal Reserve decided not to ease credit at its
meeting this week, despite signs of a slowing economy,
government officials said.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>Stock funds returned an average of 5.89% in the second

small-company growth funds both returned more than 7%.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>Price Waterhouse could face contempt penalties if it
violates securities laws, under a permanent injunction sought
by the SEC. The agency claims the accounting firm is likely
to break the law without such an order.</p>
<p>Accounting firms could do more consulting work for their
auditing clients under an SEC staff ruling.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>UAL halted talks with aircraft makers about the purchase
of up to $15 billion in jets, under pressure from a union-led
buy-out group. The group is offering preferred status to
vendors in exchange for financing.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>Gannett is expected to post a decline in second-quarter
profit, its first such year-to-year drop in more than two
decades. The reversal signals that an industry slump has
finally taken hold at the newspaper concern.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>An architects trade group settled U.S. charges that it
violated antitrust law by discouraging competitive bidding
and discounts by its members.</p>
<p>---</p>

Squibb since their merger last year.</p>
<p>---</p>

the gambling-services firm's stock less than two weeks before
its price plunged last month.</p>
