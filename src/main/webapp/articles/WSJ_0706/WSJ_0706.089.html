	<p class="article-leader">Medical supply companies are expected to report earnings
growth averaging 12% to 15% for the second quarter,
continuing a robust performance despite government and
corporate efforts to hold down hospital costs.
   For the strongest performers, analysts say, earnings
growth reflects the strength of new products, stability in
the rate of hospital admissions and changes in hospital
buying practices. But it also underscores the success of
diversified business lines, particularly pharmaceuticals, for
such concerns as Johnson & Johnson and Abbott Laboratories.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"Calling some of the major {companies} hospital suppliers
is a bit of a misnomer," says Daniel T. Lemaitre, health-care
analyst at Cowen & Co. "Some of these companies have as
little as 35% of sales going to hospitals." Even so, Mr.
Lemaitre says, their hospital businesses are healthy in part
because patients admitted to hospitals these days are sicker
and require more surgical procedures, thus leading to some
growth in unit sales.</p>
<p>Adds Joseph D. France, who tracks hospitals and
medical-supply concerns at Smith Barney: "Hospitals are
focusing more {purchases} on fewer vendors, which benefits
the larger companies." In addition, companies are beginning
to establish small price increases, compared with cuts of up
to 15% in the mid-to-late 1980s, he says. The increases are
"low single-digit," he says, but "it's better than a sharp
stick in the eye" and should contribute to what he sees as
strengthening results over the next 12 months.</p>
<p>Johnson & Johnson is expected to report second-quarter
profit of about $1 a share, up 12% to 14% from 89 cents or
$297 million a year ago. The improvement reflects
double-digit increases in sales, strong results from its
Ethicon wound closure business and success with
erythropoietin, or EPO, a drug for dialysis patients,
Hismanal, a non-sedating anti-histamine, and a new diagnostic
test for hepatitis-C.</p>
<p>Johnson & Johnson, based in New Brunswick, N.J., says it
understands that $1 a share is the consensus second-quarter
forecast on Wall Street, but hadn't any other comment. Mr.
Lemaitre sees the potential for "an upside surprise" and
projects Johnson & Johnson at $1.05 a share, up nearly 18%.</p>
<p>Analysts see Abbott's earnings rising about 15% to 16%, to
about 55 cents a share, from $212.6 million or 47 cents a
share a year ago, adjusted for a 2-for-1 stock split. The
growth reflects stronger sales that were slowed last year by
problems in its infant-formula business. One big success,
says Mr. Lemaitre is IMx, an automated test used to diagnose
such diseases as hepatitis, cancer and thyroid dysfunction.
Sales of the product could reach $250 million this year, its
second full year on the market, the analyst says. Abbott,
North Chicago, Ill., said it hadn't any comment.</p>
<p>Baxter International, Deerfield, Ill., is expected to
realize some benefits from its recently announced
restructuring, but analysts seem uncertain about the precise
impact on second-quarter results. Kent Blair, analyst with
Donaldson Lufkin Jenrette, looks for a 5% to 10% increase,
while Mr. France lists Baxter at 40 cents a share, up 14%
from $104 million, or 35 cents a share, a year ago. "The
thing most people will pay attention to is the gross margin
improvement," says Mr. Lemaitre, who sees it improving to
above 35% from 33.7% in the first quarter. Baxter declined to
comment on analysts' projections.</p>
<p>Becton Dickinson & Co. is expected to report a 20% profit
rise, to about $1.20 a share from $39 million, or 99 cents a
share, from continuing operations. Year ago net after special
gains was $86.4 million, or $2.19 a share. The year-ago
quarter was particularly weak due to a glut of surgical
gloves and heavy spending to protect its syringe business
from competition, says Mr. Blair. With both problems behind
it, "we're pretty optimistic that Becton is going forward,"
Mr. Blair says. Becton, Franklin Lakes, N.J., didn't have any
comment.</p>
<p>C.R. Bard Inc. continued to struggle in the quarter with
the impact of the U.S. recall last year of its line of
angioplasty catheters, and analysts see another year of
turmoil ahead for the Murray Hill, N.J., concern. Bard is
expected to report earnings off by nearly 50% to 20 cents a
share from the year earlier $21.3 million, or 39 cents a
share. George Davis, Bard's chief financial officer, said the
estimate is "in the ballpark."</p>
<p>Among the major hospital companies, National Medical
Enterprises Inc., Los Angeles, is expected to report profit
up 17% to about 74 cents a share, from $54.8 million or 64
cents a share from continuing operations a year ago.
Year-earlier net income, after a loss from discontinued
operations, was $5.5 million, or seven cents a share. With
strong results in each segment of the industry -- acute,
psychiatric, and rehabilitative care -- National Medical "is
outperforming the industry in general," says John Hindelong,
a Donaldson Lufkin Jenrette analyst. National Medical
declined comment.</p>
<p>Humana Inc., Louisville, Ky., recently reported an 18%
profit rise for its fiscal third quarter ended May 31. Net
income was $85.3 million, or 84 cents a share, up from $72.3
million, or 72 cents a share, a year ago, reflecting strength
in both its hospital and insurance businesses.</p>
<p>Net at Community Psychiatric Centers, Laguna Hills,
Calif., was up 2% in its second fiscal quarter ended May 31
over a year ago, the company recently reported, but income
from continuing operations rose 16% to $23.9 million, or 52
cents a share, from $20.6 million, or 45 cents a share. Much
of the growth reflected price increases and the addition of
new facilities, analysts said, noting that patient days and
admissions at hospitals open more than 12 months fell
slightly from the year ago period, while average revenue per
patient day was higher.</p>
