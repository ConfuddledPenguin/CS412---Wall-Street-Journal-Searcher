	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Despite his troubled finances, real estate and
casino developer Donald Trump made a multimillion-dollar
property tax payment yesterday as requested by the city, a
spokeswoman for the Trump Organization said.
   "It was paid in full," the spokeswoman said.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>New York City officials had asked the owners of more than
400 of the biggest real estate parcels in New York to make a
total of $1.1 billion in payments by midnight yesterday.</p>
<p>The semiannual payments are normally due July 1, but
because of delays in passing the city budget, the deadline
was pushed back to July 5 for utilities and other properties
valued at more than $15 million.</p>
<p>Among other assets, Trump owed $2.2 million on a 76-acre
former railroad yard on Manhattan's West Side, $1 million on
the commercial section of Trump Tower and $900,000 on the
Trump Parc condominiums, according to the New York City
Department of Finance.</p>
<p>Trump last month escaped default on $351 million of bonds
issued for his Atlantic City, N.J., casinos by winning a bank
loan agreement and $20 million in fresh funds. The loan
allowed him to make a crucial overdue interest payment.</p>
<p>Trump had negotiated for weeks with his bankers in an
effort to obtain a $65 million loan but ran into opposition
from some lenders who did not want to participate in the new
package. In the end, seven banks agreed in principle to lend
the larger sum and released $20 million immediately.</p>
