	<p class="article-leader">Electro Scientific Industries Inc., Portland, Ore., said
it anticipates posting a loss for its fourth quarter ended
May 31, but it declined to estimate the deficit.
   The maker of electronic equipment cited deferred expenses
from development projects and cleanup costs related to the
sale in April of its Ballantine Laboratories Inc. unit to a
New Jersey company.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>In the fiscal 1989 fourth quarter, Electro Scientific
earned $2.2 million, or 36 cents a share, on sales of $23.6
million.</p>
<p>The company throughout the latest fiscal year was plagued
by slumping sales. For the fiscal nine months ended Feb. 28,
Electro Scientific had a loss of $3.1 million, or 52 cents a
share, on sales of $57.7 million. As part of a recent
cost-cutting program, the company has reduced its work force
15% to about 680 employees.</p>
