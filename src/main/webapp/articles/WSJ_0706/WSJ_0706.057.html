	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Citicorp's head of North American corporate
finance, George L. Davis, resigned in what appears to be the
first fallout from a shuffling of top officers in January.
   Mr. Davis, 55 years old, couldn't be reached for comment.
However, a memo from Chairman John S. Reed to policy
committee members said that "the business has changed
considerably from that envisioned in 1987," when Mr. Davis
rejoined the large banking company. Mr. Reed's memo added,
"George feels that he can make a greater contribution
elsewhere."</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Mr. Davis had left Citicorp in 1981 to become executive
vice president at First Chicago Corp. under Chairman Barry
Sullivan.</p>
<p>Mr. Davis's resignation, Citicorp executives said, isn't
related to the bank's rising levels of problem loans for
corporate takeovers and commercial real estate, two troubled
areas that Mr. Davis oversaw.</p>
<p>Rather, a bank executive who asked not to be identified
linked the departure of Mr. Davis, who is noted for his
credit analysis skills, to a political setback suffered by
Vice Chairman Lawrence Small, his patron within Citicorp.</p>
<p>The January reorganization diminished Mr. Small's
influence within Citicorp and, some executives said, hastened
Mr. Davis's departure. In that shake-up, the traditional
commercial and investment banking functions were merged, and
the resulting wholesale bank split into two groups -- one
managing the developed countries, consisting of North
America, Japan and Europe; and the other managing the
developing countries.</p>
<p>As part of that shake-up, Mr. Small, who had run the
world-wide commercial bank, was placed in a lesser role as
the top liaison with corporate clients, and Richard S.
Braddock, head of consumer banking, was elevated to the
long-vacant presidency.</p>
<p>Mr. Small, a hard-charging, ambitious executive, was
considered by some the leading contender for the president's
job. However, Citicorp executives said disagreements grew
between Messrs. Reed and Small, especially over the tough
bargaining stance advocated by Mr. Small toward debt
negotiations with Brazil and other Latin American borrowers.</p>
<p>At the time of the reorganization, Mr. Reed and other
Citicorp executives -- as well as Mr. Small himself --
insisted Mr. Small hadn't lost out. "With the age difference
of only two years between John and myself, I've never thought
that it was particularly logical for me to aspire to be chief
executive officer," Mr. Small said at the time.</p>
<p>Michael A. Callen, who had been sector executive for
investment banking, was put in charge of wholesale banking in
the developed countries. Citicorp executives speculated that
Mr. Callen wants to fill key posts, such as Mr. Davis's
position, with personnel loyal to him.</p>
<p>Mr. Callen was traveling yesterday and couldn't be
reached.</p>
