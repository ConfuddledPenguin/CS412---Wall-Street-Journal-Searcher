	<p class="article-leader">CHARLOTTE, N.C. -- CCAIR Inc., a commuter airline that
feeds passengers to USAir, said it filed for protection under
Chapter 11 of the federal Bankruptcy Code, citing cash-flow
problems.
   CCAIR, which is among several carriers that does business
as USAir Express, said it has suffered a cash squeeze since
USAir, the Arlington, Va.-based carrier with which it has a
marketing agreement, began paying it on a monthly basis
instead of weekly. The switch came after USAir Group Inc.,
the parent of USAir, acquired Piedmont Airlines, the carrier
that CCAIR had cooperated with.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"Our traffic is good and we've got a lot of good
employees," said J. Edward Bacon Jr., vice president-sales
and services at CCAIR. "It's basically just a cash-flow
problem."</p>
<p>Mr. Bacon said negotiations for a line of credit recently
fell through, prompting the bankruptcy-law petition, which
was filed yesterday in federal bankruptcy court here. He said
the bankruptcy filing listed assets of $26 million and
liabilities of $13 million. He said the commuter line is
continuing to operate.</p>
<p>A USAir spokeswoman wouldn't comment. The two carriers are
unrelated in ownership, but have a marketing agreement under
which CCAIR provides commuter feeder service to USAir at its
Charlotte hub. CCAIR flies to 23 cities in North Carolina,
South Carolina, Georgia, Tennessee, Virginia and West
Virginia.</p>
<p>For the third quarter ended March 31, CCAIR had a loss of
$1.5 million, or 26 cents a share, on revenue of $15.5
million. That compared with a loss of $350,999, or seven
cents a share, on revenue of $13.7 million in the
year-earlier period.</p>
<p>Under Chapter 11, a company continues to operate under
protection from creditors' lawsuits while it works out a plan
to pay its debts.</p>
