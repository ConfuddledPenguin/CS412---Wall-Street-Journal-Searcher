	<p class="article-leader">Unlisted stock prices fell further in a market shaken by
more weak second-quarter earnings outlooks.
   Weakening expectations rattled the OTC market Monday and
Tuesday, and more pessimistic projections disturbed investors
yesterday.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"They're definitely putting the jitters into the market,"
says David Memmott, OTC trader at Dillon, Read & Co. Mr.
Memmott says OTC investor enthusiasm could be damped further
by a few disappointments early in the second-quarter
reporting period that will begin later this month.</p>
<p>Many players stayed home yesterday, leaving some OTC
trading desks thinly staffed in anticipation of light
activity for the remainder of the week. The absences were
evident in volume, which totaled a mere 97.8 million shares,
compared to Tuesday's 131 million shares.</p>
<p>The Nasdaq Composite Index dropped 2.57, or 0.56%, to
459.19, but suffered less than the New York Stock Exchange
Composite Index, which fell about 1.1%.</p>
<p>Robert O'Toole Sr., head of institutional sales trading at
Shearson Lehman Hutton, says "buyers were on strike"
yesterday.</p>
<p>OTC advancers trailed decliners, 676 to 1,094.</p>
<p>Late Tuesday, Microcom slashed its previously reported
fiscal fourth-quarter and year-end results and said it also
expects to report a bigger loss for the first quarter than
had originally been anticipated.</p>
<p>The company's stock lost nearly half of its value in June
after the company announced that it would lose money in the
first quarter ended June 30. The stock dropped nearly 30%
yesterday, down 2 5/8 to 6 1/8.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, Mentor Graphics startled owners of its shares
by announcing that its second quarter profit would amount to
a mere 10 cents a share or less, far below expectations and
down sharply from the 29 cents a share reported in the
quarter a year ago. The company's stock suffered a 4 3/8
point loss Tuesday and fell another 7/8 to 16 3/4 yesterday.</p>
<p>Specialty retailer Sharper Image slipped 3/8 to 4 7/8
after announcing that it expects to report a second-quarter
loss of 15 cents to 20 cents a share, compared with last
year's second-quarter profit of one cent a share. The company
blamed "the current retail environment" for the loss.</p>
<p>Roadway Services fell 1/2 to 34 1/2. The trucking company
reported this morning that profit in the second-quarter fell
to 58 cents a share from 67 cents in the same quarter a year
earlier. The latest quarter's earnings were below analysts'
estimates.</p>
<p>Other OTC transportation stocks slipped, including trucker
Yellow Freight Systems, off 1/4 to 26 7/8, and school-bus
operator Laidlaw, whose Class B shares eased 3/8 to 23 1/8.
The Nasdaq Transportation Index was the worst performing
sector of the OTC market, dropping nearly 0.9%.</p>
<p>Hibernia Savings Bank lost 1 1/4 to 5 3/4 after omitting
its quarterly dividend. On Tuesday, the bank said it will
report losses for its second quarter and six months due to
real estate loan-loss provisions.</p>
<p>Workstation makers Tandon and Sun Microsystems both edged
higher. Tandon gained 1/16 to 3 13/16 on heavy volume, while
Sun Microsystems gained 1/8 to 33 1/4.</p>
<p>Apple Computer, however, fell 1/2 to 43 1/2, while
chip-maker Intel lost 1/2 to 47.</p>
<p>Foremost fell another 3 3/8 to 22 1/4. On Tuesday, the
stock dropped 4 1/2 after the insurer said it had ended
efforts to find a buyer for the company.</p>
<p>Hamilton Oil added 4 1/2 to 39 3/4 after it announced the
discovery of natural gas in the Irish Sea off the West coast
of England.</p>
<p>Altos Computer gained 7/8 to 8 1/4 after signing an
agreement to be acquired by Acer Group for $8.35 a share.</p>
<p>NEC's American Depositary Receipts rose 1 1/2 to 66. The
Japanese company has unveiled a mainframe computer that it
calls the world's fastest. However, analysts are skeptical
that the new machine will boost the company's tiny share of
the world mainframe market, according to an article that
appeared in this newspaper yesterday.</p>
<p>CCAIR, which does business as USAir Express, said it filed
a petition for reorganization under Chapter 11 of the U.S.
Bankruptcy Code. The stock lost 7/8 to 1 1/4.</p>
<p>Insurance brokers firm Poe & Associates added 3/4 to 12,
while fellow brokers Hilb, Rogal & Hamilton rose 1/4 to 14.
Yesterday's "Heard on the Street" column in this newspaper
reported that some analysts are saying now is the time to buy
insurance brokerage stocks. Those analysts say the pricing
cycle for property and casualty insurance has bottomed and
may be ready for an upswing. Poe and Hilb, Rogal were two
firms cited as good buys by an analyst quoted in the story.</p>
<p>Specialty soap maker Neutrogena added 1 3/8 to 23 1/8. At
least one analyst attributed the move to "short covering," in
which investors who have sold borrowed shares of the stock
buy new shares to repay their stock loans, according to Dow
Jones Professional Investor Report. Socalled short sellers
hope to gain from a drop in the price of a stock, and cover
their loans when they believe a stock's price has hit bottom.</p>
