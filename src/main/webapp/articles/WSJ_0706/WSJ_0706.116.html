	<p class="article-leader">LOS ANGELES -- First Executive Corp.'s chairman and chief
executive officer, Fred Carr, saw his 1989 compensation drop
nearly as drastically as the junk-bond market did last year,
taking a toll on the life insurance holding company.
   The company's newly issued proxy statement for its annual
meeting July 30 shows that Mr. Carr received cash
compensation of $604,734 in 1989, or roughly a third of the
$1.8 million he received in 1988. The 1988 sum included $1.25
million in deferred incentive compensation in addition to a
base salary of $600,000, according to last year's proxy.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>A new employment contract signed in December provides,
among other things, that Mr. Carr would receive $6 million in
cash or three times his base salary and average incentive pay
for the two preceeding years, if he resigns under certain
conditions following a change in control at the company.</p>
<p>The filing further states that First Executive, once a key
client of Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc., bought about $2.35
billion and sold about $1.1 billion in securities through
Drexel last year before the firm's collapse. It also holds
about $19 million of commercial paper issued by Drexel that
is in default.</p>
<p>Executive Life, First Executive's operating unit, sued
Drexel to recover part of the unpaid first-quarter rent on
office space in Beverly Hills, Calif., that it sublet to the
brokerage firm. In May, Drexel paid Executive Life $400,000
to settle the suit, the filing shows.</p>
