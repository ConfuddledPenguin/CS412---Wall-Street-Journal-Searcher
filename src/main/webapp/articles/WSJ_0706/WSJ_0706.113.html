	<p class="article-leader">For investors in stock mutual funds, the message from the
past three months is: Caution didn't pay.
   By venturing abroad or loading up on stocks of companies
with fast-growing earnings, some funds picked up handsome
returns for the quarter. But conservative fund managers who
sat on cash found themselves sitting out a rally.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Growth funds and small-company growth funds both had total
returns -- price change plus dividends -- of more than 7% for
the quarter, according to Lipper Analytical Services. The
average general stock fund returned 5.89% for the quarter
while the Standard & Poor's 500 Stock Index rose 6.29%.</p>
<p>The quarter's gains were an abrupt turnaround from the
first quarter, when the average stock fund slipped 2.31% and
the plodding money market funds ranked as the second-best
performing category of mutual funds.</p>
<p>"Investors are looking for companies that have
above-average earnings growth," says Gordon Fines, manager of
the $800 million IDS Growth Fund. The economy is sluggish,
but "inflation isn't a problem and interest rates are stable.
Against that sort of benign backdrop, investors are drawn to
growth stocks."</p>
<p>Mr. Fines's fund was up 16.45% for the past three months,
helped by both big-company growth stocks such as Wal-Mart
Stores Inc. and Waste Management Inc. as well as smaller
growth stocks including Flightsafety International Inc.,
Adobe Systems Inc. and Novell Inc.</p>
<p>According to A. Michael Lipper, president of Lipper
Analytical, funds that bought growth stocks -- whether they
were big company growth stocks or small company growth stocks
-- were the big winners in the quarter. "It paid to assume
risk," notes Mr. Lipper. "Growth is back, and high growth is
back even more."</p>
<p>Among general domestic stock funds, small-company growth
funds were the top performers for the second consecutive
quarter. But after seven years of lagging behind the market
averages, most small-cap managers aren't yet ready to uncork
the champagne.</p>
<p>"It's not size that's done it, it's growth," says Roy
McKay, manager of Scudder Development Fund, a small-company
stock fund that was up 16.36% over the past three months.
"It's the growth that's doing well. Companies with
consistently growing earnings have done well."</p>
<p>Not all stock fund managers are cheering. Many fund
managers missed part of the rally because they were holding
too much cash. As a result, over the past three months the
average fund trailed the market by 0.4 percentage point. Very
conservative fund managers did even worse. The equity income
funds were up just 2.6%.</p>
<p>It's been rough going for some highly regarded fund
managers. Mario Gabelli, who pulled in assets of $1.1 billion
when he launched the broker-sold Gabelli Value Fund in
September, was up just 1.41% in the second quarter. Mutual
Shares and Windsor Fund, both of which trailed the market
badly in 1989, continued to struggle. Michael Price's Mutual
Shares was up 2.51% in the quarter, while John Neff's Windsor
eked out a gain of 1.37%.</p>
<p>Just as the riskier stock funds did well in the second
quarter, so too did the riskier bond funds, notes Mr. Lipper.
Bond funds that hold longer maturity bonds did well, and
high-yielding junk bond funds snapped their yearlong losing
streak. Junk funds were down 5.57% for the past 12 months,
and the list of the 25 poorest performing mutual funds now
includes 11 junk funds. But for the most recent quarter, junk
funds bounced back 4.1%.</p>
<p>International stock funds, which invest outside the U.S.,
outstripped their domestic counterparts over the past three
months. Though funds that invest in the Pacific region -- and
especially Japan -- bounced back smartly in the second
quarter, the hottest international funds this year have been
those investing in Europe.</p>
<p>Oppenheimer Global, which is up 13.7% this year, has 75%
of its assets invested in Europe. "We emphasize `theme'
areas," explains fund manager Kenneth Oberman. "Our theme
areas are not very sophisticated. They're mostly things on
the front page of the newspaper rather than the back page of
the business section." Mr. Oberman says he was attracted to
European companies by such themes as the 1992 economic
integration of Europe, perestroika and the long-run rise in
spending on health care.</p>
<p>Among specialty funds, the past three months were
particularly kind to funds investing in technology, health
care and biotechnology. Gold funds were the biggest losers in
the quarter, down 10.27%, and the list of the
second-quarter's poorest 25 performers includes 23 precious
metals funds.</p>
<p>Daniel Leonard enjoys the dubious distinction of managing
one of the quarter's best performing funds, Financial
Strategic Portfolios-Technology, and one of the poorest
performers, Financial Strategic Portfolios-Gold.</p>
<p>On the technology front, "we've been in the tank for seven
years," says Mr. Leonard. "We've had a nice move, but the
stocks are still at pretty attractive price-earnings ratios."
Technology stocks, after performing well all year, took a
beating at the end of May, but he says the group now is
starting to rebound.</p>
<p>"The software stocks were particularly rewarding during
the quarter," notes Mr. Leonard, who thinks software
companies such as Electronic Arts and Software Toolworks Inc.
should continue to perform well for the rest of the year.</p>
<p>As for gold, Mr. Leonard is pessimistic about the metal's
price. "The two reasons you want to own gold," he says, "are
inflation and uncertainty in the world." Mr. Leonard sees
little reason for enthusiasm on either count.</p>
<p>So where has Mr. Leonard got his money? "I've got it in
technology," says Mr. Leonard the investor. "I expect it'll
stay there for a while."</p>
