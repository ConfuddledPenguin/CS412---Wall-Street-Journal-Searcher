	<p class="article-leader">London I think I should begin this piece by saying that I
like Ivan Lendl, the tennis player. He is punctual and
polite, and able to make small jokes in a language not his
own (English), no small feat. I interviewed him once, and he
invited me to his home, showed me around and offered me a
Diet Coke. That may be no more than expected in most circles,
but in jockdom it passes for high hospitality.
   He is conscious of the history of his sport and concerned
about his place in it, other attributes that many top
athletes do not share. Further, he does not pretend to
disdain what he has not been able to obtain, another minority
position among the accomplished.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>As anyone who can follow the bouncing ball knows, what
Lendl hasn't been able to obtain is a Wimbledon singles
title, which would round out a rare career "Grand Slam." How
much he wants one has been a main topic of discussion at
these proceedings, which enter the men's semifinal round
today with him still in it.</p>
<p>The bony-faced Ivan and the assembled press have spent the
fortnight fencing about the meaning of the word "obsessed."
The former Czech lad, now a 30-year-old Connecticut squire,
won't accept that psychologically loaded label, but has said
he would trade all of his previous Grand Slam crowns,
numbering eight (three French, three U.S. and two Australian
Opens), for the All-England bauble. That might not amount to
obsession, but the price Faust paid wasn't much higher.</p>
<p>Lendl has gone about his quest in his characteristic way,
which is to work very hard at it; this is a guy who, if he's
not playing tennis, is running, bicycling, pumping iron or
engaging in some other athletically useful activity. He and
his coach, Tony Roche, have noticed that Wimbledon is played
on grass, and have shaped their spring schedules around
spending as much time as possible on the surface. This
entailed skipping the claybound French Open, where Ivan is
very much at home, and at which he would have been the
favorite.</p>
<p>It's here appropriate to note that finding a grass tennis
court is no easy matter. The things are difficult and
expensive to maintain, yield bad bounces in the best of times
and wear down easily; by the time this tournament is over,
Wimbledon's famed and pampered Centre Court will be as much
brown as green, and sport wellworn ruts along its back and
center lines.</p>
<p>I have played tennis for 25-odd (really odd) years, and
have never set foot on a grass court. Neither, I'd guess,
have you. There are some here in England, of course, and a
scattering in Australia and the U.S., mostly at clubs that
also have "cricket" or "croquet" in their names. The surface
is, in a word, archaic, which is why it's silly to call
Wimbledon the world's tennis championship, as some do. But
that's another subject.</p>
<p>If any of the above indicates that Lendl has been a
failure in this tournament over the years, it's
unintentional. He's reached the finals twice -- in 1986 and
1987 -- and last year led Boris Becker, the eventual
champion, two sets to one in a semifinal before bowing. He
thus reasoned that a little improvement would go a long way,
and that greater grass-court familiarity would provide it.</p>
<p>Asked the other day what he's worked on, he mentioned his
footwork and return of serve, and, naturally, his volleying,
the last of which dispenses with erratic grass-court bounces.
But he added: "Mostly it's just spending the time on grass;
not having to pack all my preparation into a few days. This
year, if it rained, we could do something else and not worry
that we were losing time we couldn't make up."</p>
<p>It could be that Ivan is right, but it also could be that
he's wrong, and that longer lawn time won't help him. My view
is that the ability to play successful grass-court tennis is
a knack, like juggling or being able to memorize whole pages
of a telephone book at a glance. Players of all styles and
nationalities have won here, some with little or no
background on the stuff.</p>
<p>Sweden, for example, has about as many grass courts as it
has Club Meds, but its Bjorn Borg won Wimbledon five times,
and he was a bred-in-the-bone base liner to boot. Germany has
a similar lack, but in 1985 a 17-year-old Becker showed up in
the men's draw for the first time, said the German equivalent
of "aw, shucks," and whupped everybody country-style. He's
done it twice more since, without special preparations, and
is back in the semis again today.</p>
<p>It could be that Lendl secretly shares my view, because he
has shown little pleasure in his labors here to date. He
dropped a set in his first-round match with Christian
Miniussi (ranked 116th), another in round three to Bryan
Shelton (No. 125), another in the fourth round to Alex
Antonitsch (48), and yet another in Wednesday's quarterfinal
with Brad Pearce (120), a chunky Utahan whose main previous
distinction was that he'd made the doubles final in a
tournament in Schenectady.</p>
<p>Poor Ivan has grouched around more than usual, and
continually taps his shoes with his racket between points.
That latter gesture perhaps expresses a wish to be back home
on clay, where shoe-tapping serves a purpose (to knock out
the dirt).</p>
<p>After his match with Shelton, a pleasant but limited young
player from Huntsville, Ala., Lendl explained how the
wham-bam of grass-court tennis offended his methodical
nature. He noted that while Shelton's forehand was lacking,
"you can't expose his weakness on grass. His serve is big,
and every now and then you get a funny hop on the serve, and
then he comes in and hits some decent volleys." So instead of
something like 6-3, 6-2, 6-1, the scores were 7-6, 6-7, 6-4,
6-4, and "whew."</p>
<p>It's true that Lendl has been aggressive here, looking,
for a change, a bit more comfortable at the net than a hooked
salmon. It's also true that after beating the Austrian
Antonitsch on Tuesday he declared, "I'll never stay back
again," meaning that he wouldn't revert to his base-lining
ways.</p>
<p>But he quickly smiled and said he was kidding, which
looked truest of all. If he does win here, Wimbledon just
might never see him again.</p>
