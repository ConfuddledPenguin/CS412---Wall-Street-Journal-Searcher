	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- The American Institute of Architects, a
Washington trade group, settled federal antitrust charges
that it had discouraged competitive bidding and discounts by
its 55,000 members.
   Although the AIA denied any wrongdoing, it agreed to a
proposed court order that would block it from barring or
deterring architects from competitive bidding, discounting
fees and providing free services.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The proposed court order, or consent decree, was filed in
federal court in Washington by the Justice Department and
requires a judge's approval. The decree would settle civil
charges by the department, including the allegation that the
Chicago chapter of the AIA in 1984 adopted a policy statement
prohibiting practices such as competitive bidding and
discounting. Federal antitrust prosecutors had investigated
the group for four years.</p>
<p>David Perdue, the AIA's associate general counsel, said
such statements "reflected anxieties and concerns about
financial returns of {architectural} firms" in the mid-1980s.
But he insisted that the policy statements hadn't affected
architects' fees. Mr. Perdue said the AIA agreed to the
consent decree to prevent the cost and distraction of a
trial. The decree would require the architects group to pay
$50,000 to the government for the expense of its
investigation. Mr. Perdue said the group has already spent $2
million in legal fees in connection with the investigation.</p>
<p>The Justice Department investigated alleged antitrust
violations by the AIA in the early 1970s. That inquiry
resulted in a narrower consent decree barring restrictions on
competitive bidding.</p>
