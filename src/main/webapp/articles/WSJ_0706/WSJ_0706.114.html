	<p class="article-leader">Amdura Corp. said a federal district court approved the
sale of assets in its subsidiary Coast to Coast Stores Inc.,
to Servistar Corp., a dealer-owned hardware cooperative based
in Butler, Pa.
   The Coast to Coast unit sells hardware to individually
owned retail stores operating under the Coast to Coast
franchise. The asset sale will include inventory, two
distribution centers and such intangibles as the Coast to
Coast trademark. The sale, expected to close within 35 days,
is being valued by the companies between $59 million and $75
million.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Amdura, a Denver-based automotive and hardware distributor
and specialty manufacturer, bought CoastAmerica Corp., the
parent company of Coast to Coast Stores, only two years ago.
But the resulting debt of more than $260 million proved to be
more than Amdura could handle, forcing it this past April to
seek protection from creditors under Chapter 11 of the
federal Bankruptcy Code.</p>
<p>Approximately 1,100 stores are involved in the sale.
According to the sales agreement, they will operate as a
separate unit of Servistar.</p>
<p>An Amdura spokesman also acknowledged that the company is
still soliciting bids for Amdura National Distributing Co.,
another hardware distributor, but declined to further
comment.</p>
