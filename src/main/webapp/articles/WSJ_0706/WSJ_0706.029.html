	<p class="article-leader">TAIPEI -- Taiwan's trade surplus during the first half of
1990 totaled $4.94 billion, a 20% decline from the same
period last year, the government announced Thursday.
   But the monthly surplus for June was $1.09 billion, up 23%
from a year ago, said the directorate general of Budget,
Accounting and Statistics.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Exports in the first six months this year totaled $31.87
billion, down 0.8% from the first half of 1989. Imports
totaled $26.93 billion during the first half of 1990, an
increase of 3.9%, the agency said.</p>
<p>Officials attributed the reduced trade surplus to lower
exports. Higher wages and production costs have weakened
Taiwan's competitiveness in foreign markets.</p>
<p>Taiwan's surplus with the U.S., its largest trading
partner, totaled $4.04 billion in the first half of 1990,
down 27% from the same period a year earlier.</p>
<p>Taiwan registered a surplus of $800 million with the U.S.
in June, down 17.1% from June 1989.</p>
<p>Taiwan's exports to the U.S. totaled $1.72 billion in
June, while imports totaled $920 million.</p>
<p>Taiwan's trade with Japan, its second largest trading
partner, registered a deficit of $3.71 billion in the first
half this year, rising 15.5% from period a year ago.</p>
<p>The June deficit with Japan was $710 million in June, up
6.1% from the June 1989.</p>
<p>The government has projected a 1990 trade surplus of $11
billion, compared with the $13.93 billion surplus last year.</p>
