	<p class="article-leader">A Monsanto Co. blood pressure drug is more effective among
black patients than two competing drugs, University of
Maryland researchers said.
   In a study of 394 patients, Verapamil SR, a calcium
channel blocker, reduced hypertension in as many as 73% of
cases, while captopril, an ACE inhibitor marketed by
Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. was effective in 57.1% of patients
and ICI Pharma's atenolol, a beta blocker, had a 59.6%
effective rate, the researchers said. ICI Pharma is the U.S.
arm of Britain's Imperial Chemical Industries PLC.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Verapamil SR is marketed under the trade name Calan SR by
Monsanto's G.D. Searle unit, which funded the study,
published in the current issue of Archives of Internal
Medicine.</p>
<p>Previous research has shown that diuretics and the class
of drugs known as calcium channel blockers appear to be more
effective among blacks than the other types of blood pressure
medicines. This study was the first to compare the three
classes of medicines among black patients.</p>
<p>Drug companies often support clinical trials that compare
the effectiveness of competing drugs to use in marketing
their products. This study demonstrates that all three
medicines worked well among blacks, says Matthew R. Weir,
medical director of clinical research at the University of
Maryland Hospital, Baltimore. Patients responded best to the
calcium channel blocker, but the effectiveness of the other
two drugs was higher than previous studies have shown, the
study says.</p>
<p>Hypertension is more prevalent among blacks than
non-blacks and such illness as coronary artery disease,
stroke and kidney disease develop earlier among blacks.
Researchers think differences in blood chemistry and other
factors partially explain blacks' susceptibility to
hypertension, as well as their varied responses to different
classes of medicines.</p>
<p>Calcium channel blockers help lower blood pressure by
reducing the heart's workload. Beta blockers block certain
nerve impulses and slow down the heart's activity, reducing
its need for oxygen. ACE (for angiotensin converting enzyme)
blocks the action of a kidney enzyme that causes blood
vessels to tighten. One reason researchers think blacks are
less responsive to ACE inhibitors, for instance, is that
blacks typically already have low levels of renin, the enzyme
the drug blocks.</p>
<p>Doctors commonly prescribe diuretics to black patients,
but researchers are increasingly concerned that these
medicines increase the risk among both black and non-black
patients for heart disease, high cholesterol and abnormal
blood chemistry, Dr. Weir says. The study shows that "there
are drugs that work well in blacks besides diuretics."</p>
<p>Diuretics, at a cost of about $5 a month, are much cheaper
than the other drugs, which range from $20 to $30 a month per
equivalent dose, he adds.</p>
