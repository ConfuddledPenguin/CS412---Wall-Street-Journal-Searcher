	<p class="article-leader">LONDON -- Diamond sales of De Beers Consolidated Mines
Ltd. rose to a record $2.48 billion in the first half, an 7%
increase from a year earlier, the company said.
   But sales in the second quarter were slower than in the
buoyant first quarter. Dealers described the diamond market
as quiet. They estimate that of the first half's sales, De
Beers sold about 60% in the first three months.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The record sales partially reflect a diamond price
increase of 5.5% at the end of March, the company said. De
Beers, which controls about 80% of the world rough diamond
market, decided to raise prices following buoyant sales in
January and February.</p>
<p>De Beers reported sales of 2.32 billion for the first half
of 1989. In the second half of the year, the company had
sales of $1.77 billion. Second half sales tend to be lower
than the first half because of seasonal buying trends, De
Beers said.</p>
<p>Because the diamond market appears to be slowing, total
sales in 1990 might be around $4.1 billion, about the same
annual level as the previous two years, dealers predict.</p>
<p>Although sales of medium and high quality diamonds are
still reasonable, the market in poor quality diamonds, priced
at $350 a carat or lower, is weak, De Beers said.</p>
<p>The U.S. market, which accounts for about two fifths of
world diamond jewelry sales, is particularly slow, dealers
said. Japanese diamond imports surged in the first two
months, but since then consumption has waned. Trade in the
European markets, however, is fair, they said.</p>
<p>After the boom between 1986 to 1988, the market is
returning to normal, De Beers said.</p>
<p>But Jacques Zucker, a director of Zucker-Berkovic PVBA,
Antwerp diamond dealers, said, "Diamond manufacturers are
being squeezed by falling margins." Prices of polished
diamonds haven't matched the 21% rise in De Beers's rough
diamond quotes during the past 18 months, he said.</p>
