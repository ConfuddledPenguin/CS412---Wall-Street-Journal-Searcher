	<p class="article-leader">In your May 23 Mount Graham editorial "A Species of
Extremism" you said, "no one has shown persuasively that the
project would harm the squirrel." For the record: All state,
federal and University of Arizona biologists who prepared the
official biological documentation have opposed it. Fish and
Wildlife Service biologists, under oath, testified against
it. Scientists nationwide have signed petitions opposing it.
University of Arizona biologists risked tenure and signed.
Max Planck and Ohio State scientists oppose their own
institutions' participation.
   You also stated: "Telescope backers promise to reforest
the logged areas." For the record, government biologists say
it takes 200 years to create the old-growth forest the
squirrel requires. It should be noted that only the
University of Arizona would be allowed to cut trees in
"critical habitat," having obtained congressional exemption
from all our environmental laws. Do you suggest we spend
millions of taxpayer dollars on a captive-breeding program so
the astronomers can destroy the squirrels' homes and food
supply?</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>You said the project requires 26 acres, but that is only
the project "footprint." The government says the project
would destroy some 130 acres of squirrel habitat -- mostly
within the mountaintop's ecologically priceless 600-acre
virgin spruce-fir forest.</p>
<p>What you did not say is that there are other places (New
Mexico, Nevada, Utah, Arizona, South America, etc.) for
advanced design telescopes that do not destroy endangered
species or irreplaceable ecological treasures. Studies have
ruled Hawaii's Mauna Kea far superior. Mount Graham was
listed in a recent study as 37th worst of 58 sites in the
Western U.S. Is a Univerity of Arizona astronomer's driving
convenience reason to trash our environmental laws?</p>
<p>Jobs lost is pure hokum. There are institutions dying to
steal the University of Arizona's collaborators. Jobs follow
the collaborators.</p>
<p>Regarding your disavowal of subspecies that "are found
elsewhere, have many subspecies or can be relocated" -- by
that definition you demean human races, preclude plant
varieties for lifesaving drugs and miracle grains, and ensure
a barren North America without grizzly bear, Florida panther
or Key deer since all the above are subspecies.</p>
