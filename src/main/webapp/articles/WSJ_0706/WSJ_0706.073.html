	<p class="article-leader">BATESVILLE, Ind. -- Fewer people are dying, and an
increasing number don't want to be buried.
   Those are the facts behind flat earnings for the nation's
biggest casketmaker, Hillenbrand Industries Inc. "In the last
two years there have been fewer deaths in the U.S. and Canada
than what the funeral industry had anticipated," the company
said in reporting results for its Batesville Casket Co. unit.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>While Batesville was able to offset a revenue decline by
raising prices on caskets and boosting its market share, a
Hillenbrand spokeswoman acknowledged that the company had
unused plant capacity.</p>
<p>"We are poised for growth when it does come," she said,
alluding to government statistics that indicate the future
will bring more customers because of the aging population.
Indeed, Social Security Administration figures show that U.S.
deaths dropped to 2,141,000 last year from 2,171,000 in 1988,
but should increase to 2,164,000 this year.</p>
<p>Another negative element for the industry: More and more
people are choosing cremation over burial. "The West Coast is
a very active area for cremations, as is the Northeast," the
spokeswoman said, adding, "In the heartland of the U.S.,
there is a much more traditional view." Despite that trend,
most who wish their remains to be burned first still want a
funeral service with a casket, she said.</p>
