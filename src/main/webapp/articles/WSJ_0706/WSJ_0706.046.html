	<p class="article-leader">MOSCOW -- When Western leaders meet in Houston next week,
the U.S. and Britain plan to argue that a controversial plan
for massive aid to the Soviet Union is premature.
Surprisingly, leading Soviet economists and officials agree.
   West Germany and France have proposed an immediate $15
billion infusion of international aid, while Britain and the
U.S. say cash won't do any good unless serious economic
reforms are in place. Soviet economists say that the help
would be welcome, but that the country simply isn't ready to
absorb it yet.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"I'm not sure such aid today would be effective," says
Oleg Bogomolov, an influential radical economist. "It won't
solve any of the cardinal problems."</p>
<p>Even Soviet government officials reject the quick fix of
using Western funds to fill empty Soviet shelves. "All the
money in the world probably won't be enough to speed up
economic reform if we only do it through consumer goods,"
says Andrei Bugrov, a Foreign Ministry official specializing
in international economic relations.</p>
<p>Before any aid could be effective, some Western and Soviet
experts argue, the country must start price reforms,
industrial privatization, reconstructing its banking system
and building better supports for foreign investment. Linking
the aid to such economic conditions could actually help
Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev push through unpopular
reforms.</p>
<p>But political conditions would be out of the question,
Soviet officials say. And many countries that are considering
participating in the aid plan clearly have their own
political agendas.</p>
<p>West Germany, which initiated the idea, wants Soviet
acceptance of German reunification. The U.S. says it might
not participate unless the Soviet Union stops funding Cuba
and cuts its own military spending. Japan, now the world's
biggest creditor, won't give economic aid until it and Moscow
resolve their dispute over four islands north of Japan that
the Soviet Union has held since 1945.</p>
<p>"Any intention to call the Soviet Union on the carpet in
Houston and dictate political conditions is extremely
unrealistic," wrote Lev Strzhizhovsky in Pravda, the
Communist Party daily. "There can be only one approach and
everyone in Houston should know it: `yes' to assistance, but
`no' to political conditions."</p>
<p>The aid package is likely to dominate discussions at the
Houston meeting of seven major industrial nations. The G-7
summit participants -- the U.S., Japan, West Germany, France,
Britain, Italy and Canada -- are split on whether giving aid
is a good idea at all, and if so, how to go about it.</p>
<p>The goal of France and West Germany is to help Moscow
through a difficult transition from 70 years of command
economy to a supply-and-demand market system. As a statement
of support for Mr. Gorbachev and his perestroika policies,
the aid plan emerged at the right time, just before the
crucial congress of the Communist Party that is now under way
and which could determine whether perestroika continues or
stalls.</p>
<p>Last year, the G-7 countries called on the Soviets to
undertake specific economic reforms. Since then, several
reforms have been proferred and rejected, and the Soviet
economy has spiraled downward. Inflation is estimated at 10%,
the budget deficit last year hit 100 billion rubles ($170
billion at the official exchange rate or $16 billion at the
more realistic tourist rate), and hard currency debt now
stands at about $45 billion.</p>
<p>When West Germany first suggested the aid plan last month,
it clearly wanted to give Mr. Gorbachev quick relief until a
more acceptable reform program could get off the ground. Some
of the money was proposed for food and consumer goods, to get
products on the shelves immediately.</p>
<p>On its own late last year, the Gorbachev government
imported about 10 billion rubles of soap, food and clothing
in an attempt to soothe the tempers of striking miners and
frustrated city shoppers. At first the shipments did the
trick, but within a month the shelves were bare again and
nothing fundamental had changed.</p>
<p>Many Soviet economists say that's the reason aid should be
linked to specific economic reforms or sorely needed
infrastructure such as roads and telecommunications. The
money must be earmarked for specific investments to avoid the
problems that plagued Poland in the 1970s, when tens of
billions of dollars of foreign investment and loans were
wasted, leaving the country with a huge foreign debt and lots
of outmoded equipment.</p>
<p>Frustrated by the government's cautious approach to
reform, other Soviet economists say attaching economic
conditions to the aid could be just the lever needed to get
things moving. Without such external pressure, the stumbling
blocks in the way of economic reform will take too long to
remove.</p>
