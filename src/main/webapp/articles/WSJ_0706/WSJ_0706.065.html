	<p class="article-leader">BUSH HOPES to boost Gorbachev with kind words at Western
summits.
   The White House worries because hardliners now accuse the
Soviet leader of "losing" Eastern Europe. To bolster him,
Bush pushes NATO to declare at the end of its London meeting
today that the West is scaling back militarily throughout
Europe. Western leaders also may send Baker or another high
official to brief Gorbachev this weekend, during the Soviet
party congress.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Bush aides want next week's Houston summit of
industrialized nations to help Gorbachev -- without granting
the Soviets huge economic aid yet. The meeting could issue
the West's first broad statement of a willingness to help,
but Moscow would have to meet conditions before new aid
flows.</p>
<p>Bush sympathizes with Gorbachev about conservatives'
attacks on him, cracking: "I know the feeling."</p>
<p>REGULATORS WORK to quell criticism they are still too lax
in the thrift cleanup.</p>
<p>The Resolution Trust Corp. readies an ambitious plan to
sell a huge chunk of real estate and other assets acquired
from insolvent institutions. Congress complains the agency
has moved too slowly, but the likely fire-sale prices may
enrage lawmakers. Meanwhile, regulators frustrate S&L groups
by refusing to ease limits on loans to single developers as
much as S&Ls wanted.</p>
<p>Banks and S&Ls are worried about a tough new government
policy of disclosing how much they lend in their own
communities. Consumer groups will use the records, which also
grade lending to low-income people, to challenge mergers.
"Think about how your report will look in the local
newspaper," a Fed official warns bankers.</p>
<p>BUDGET NEGOTIATORS find deficit-cutting is tougher than
partisan posturing.</p>
<p>Hopes diminish that Bush's about-face on taxes will
produce a quick accord. Officials remain far apart on how
deeply to cut defense and government benefits. But growing
turf battles suggest talks are getting serious; for instance,
Senate Finance Chairman Bentsen, who fears a higher gasoline
tax, demands that his committee shape any tax increase.</p>
<p>To get the talks moving, Sen. Domenici and House Ways and
Means Chairman Rostenkowski discuss a bipartisan tax plan.
Both favor higher consumption taxes. Democrats press to raise
the top income-tax rate for wealthier taxpayers to 33% from
28%. But there is new talk of a "revenue-neutral" compromise:
a new 31% or 32% rate to replace the present 28% and 33%
brackets.</p>
<p>Bush may face a choice between raising the top tax rate
and getting a significant deficit accord.</p>
<p>SULLIVAN'S SLOWNESS discourages candidates for the NIH
director's job, scientists warn. The top research slot has
been vacant nearly a year. The human services chief recently
has interviewed some candidates, but after asking a panel how
to make the job more attractive, he hasn't acted on its
proposals to give the director more authority, independence
and pay.</p>
<p>INDUSTRIAL ESPIONAGE? The Senate Banking Committee pushes
a bill calling on the CIA to keep track of foreign efforts to
make inroads into U.S. high-technology markets. Bush
administration free-traders oppose the idea. But with the
Soviet threat diminishing, some in the intelligence community
would welcome a new role.</p>
<p>SUNUNU SWELTERS under criticism from Republican
conservatives. At Bush's behest, he shows GOP senators
compromise language on the job-discrimination bill, but the
lawmakers, already mad about Bush's tax flip-flop, claim he
caved in to liberals. The White House, which wants a bill
Bush can sign, says Sununu hadn't endorsed the proposal and
was just trying to do his job.</p>
<p>BROADCASTERS GRAPPLE with how to handle inflammatory
commercials from fringe candidates. After airing an ad from
Georgia lieutenant gubernatorial candidate J.B. Stoner
declaring "Praise God for AIDS" and assailing blacks, Jews
and gays, one Atlanta TV station ran a disclaimer telling
viewers that federal law requires it to air the commercial
uncensored.</p>
<p>DRUG WARS fade from the Washington political agenda. The
Drug Enforcement Administration begins to scale back
far-flung search-and-destroy operations in Peru and Bolivia.
The agency admits it failed to meet its goal of cutting
cocaine trafficking by 50%, but says the program helped raise
drug prices in some American cities. Critics say prices are
up because Colombian traffickers are cutting the cocaine
supply to raise profits.</p>
<p>Bennett is less visible in his second year. He hasn't
halted interagency squabbling, and he feuds with Democrats,
who say he overemphasizes law enforcement and doesn't do
enough to help drug abusers get treatment. Creation of the
drug czar's post "hasn't made any difference," says Karst
Besteman, executive director of the Alcohol and Drug Problems
Association.</p>
<p>Cocaine use among the middle class is leveling off, but
heroin imports surge, thanks partly to bumper poppy crops.</p>
<p>MINOR MEMOS: Presiding over the Senate, John Glenn, a
former Marine combat pilot, crisply announces that the Senate
will recess until "0830 hours." . . . A Dole staffer calls
the budget talks "Darman Poker: You sit at the table,
everybody antes, nobody wins and Darman gets all the cards."
. . . National Security Chief Scowcroft dodges a question in
a press briefing by saying: "That's a good question, and let
me state the problem more clearly without going too deeply
into the answer."</p>
