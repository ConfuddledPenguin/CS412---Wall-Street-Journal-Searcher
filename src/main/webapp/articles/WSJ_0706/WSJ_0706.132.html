	<p class="article-leader">BRUSSELS -- Groupe Bruxelles Lambert S.A. is showing
renewed vigor four months after the collapse of New York
securities firm Drexel Burnham Lambert Group Inc., once one
of its biggest money makers.
   GBL, which controls a small empire of oil, banking,
insurance and broadcasting interests, has begun selling
peripheral assets, building up its cash reserves and
concentrating its firepower where it will have the most
effect.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>To write off its indirect stake of about 20% in Drexel,
GBL was forced to take a charge of 3.2 billion Belgian francs
($93.7 million) against its 1989 earnings.</p>
<p>Though the financial damage was relatively small, GBL was
stung by criticism over its handling of the affair. Analysts
reproached the company for not having sold its stake in the
mid-1980s, when the junk-bond house was still flying high.
They also criticized GBL for having let itself become so
dependent on an investment over which it had no control.
Drexel, which in its glory days accounted for as much as 40%
of GBL's profit, never deigned to give its big Belgian
shareholder a board seat.</p>
<p>GBL's lack of control made it look like a passive
investor, and analysts made unflattering comparisons with
Belgium's largest big holding company, Societe Generale de
Belgique S.A., which has reinvigorated large parts of its
empire in the two years since it came under the control of
France's Cie. de Suez.</p>
<p>Now the normally secretive GBL is depicting itself as a
decidedly active investor, willing to buy and sell. At a
shareholders meeting in May, GBL's chairman, Albert Frere,
said GBL would concentrate on a limited number of
high-quality companies, primarily ones based in Europe and in
which GBL can have a significant influence.</p>
<p>In the past, concedes Emile Quevrin, a GBL director, the
company was spread too thinly. But he says that problem was
partly a legacy from investments made long before Mr. Frere
took command as part of a 1981 rescue of GBL. One of those
legacies was Drexel; another was Cie. Internationale des
Wagons-Lits & du Tourisme S.A., a Franco-Belgian travel
company best known for operating sleeping compartments on
trains.</p>
<p>GBL and related companies owned about 26% of Wagons-Lits
but had to contend with two other big shareholders, with
which the Belgians didn't always agree on strategy. Thus,
last week, GBL announced an agreement to sell most of the
Wagons-Lits stake to Generale de Belgique for more than BF10
billion.</p>
<p>That was the latest in a series of sales announced by GBL
and Pargesa Holding S.A., a Geneva-based company, which is
headed by Mr. Frere and Paul Desmarais Sr., chairman of Power
Corp. of Canada, and which owns about 38% of GBL.</p>
<p>In June, GBL and Pargesa put up for sale their controlling
stake in Henry Ansbacher Holdings PLC, which owns a small
London merchant bank. Pargesa's Parfinance S.A. affiliate,
meanwhile, has recently agreed to sell minority stakes in
Societe Parisienne d'Entreprises & de Participations, a
holding company for the engineering concern Groupe Schneider;
and in Cie. Francaise de l'Afrique Occidentale, a trading
company. In April, Pargesa sold its minority stake in Banque
Paribas (Suisse) S.A. to Cie. Financiere de Paribas of
France.</p>
<p>GBL retains large minority stakes in Petrofina S.A., a
Brussels-based oil and petrochemical company; Royale Belge
S.A., an insurer; Banque Bruxelles Lambert S.A., and Banque
Internationale a Luxembourg S.A., as well as a dominant stake
in the Luxembourg-based broadcaster RTL and interests in
Belgian electric utilities.</p>
<p>In addition, through various companies, Messrs. Frere and
Desmarais control nearly 10% of Paribas, giving them a
serious voice at the prestigious French merchant bank.</p>
<p>GBL hasn't disclosed how much it will raise with all of
its asset sales, but analysts figure that the company will
have considerable cash on its hands. Mr. Quevrin, the GBL
director, said part of the proceeds will be used to help GBL
achieve its long-stated aim of raising its stake in Petrofina
to 25% from about 20%, but he said GBL will wait for
favorable market conditions.</p>
<p>The rest, he said, is likely to be used for new investment
opportunities. Mr. Quevrin declined to say what sort of
opportunities GBL is studying but said the company would
favor industries with which it has some experience. Even so,
the executive made it clear that GBL doesn't want to be
tightly bound by a strategy. "We are very opportunistic," he
said.</p>
<p>One reason GBL is moving faster, Mr. Quevrin suggested, is
that its ownership structure has become a bit less complex.
Last February, Messrs. Frere and Desmarais strengthened their
grip on Pargesa, announcing that they jointly controlled just
over 50%, which in turn gave them a better hold on GBL.</p>
<p>Analysts welcome GBL's livelier approach. "It's the good
old GBL," says Patrick de Bellefroid, chief analyst at the
Brussels brokerage firm of Puissant Baeyens Poswick & Cie.
"Albert Frere remains a king-size deal maker."</p>
