	<p class="article-leader">UAL Corp. suspended talks over its planned purchase of up
to $15 billion in aircraft until Aug. 9, the deadline by
which a union buy-out group must arrange financing to acquire
the company.
   According to people familiar with the $4.38 billion
buy-out effort, the airline holding company's board approved
suspension of the long-running talks under pressure from
members of the buy-out team.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The buy-out group is seeking to use preferred-supplier
status as a carrot to entice financial backing from the likes
of plane manufacturers Boeing Co. and Airbus Industrie and
engine maker General Electric Co.</p>
<p>The unions are said to have argued that a UAL jet order at
this time would have undercut their talks with suppliers.
Gerald Greenwald, the former Chrysler Corp. vice chairman now
heading the UAL buy-out effort, made the argument in a recent
letter to UAL's board, according to a person familiar with
the buy-out.</p>
<p>In an internal memo issued yesterday to employees, the
company said its action is "an effort to be as accommodating
as possible" to the buy-out team. Board members discussed the
action in telephone interviews Monday and Tuesday; a company
spokesman declined to comment.</p>
<p>A spokesman for the buy-out group, United Employee
Acquisition Corp., said for UAL to place the order "at this
point limits options" suppliers might be considering. "The
issue here is to give suppliers time to examine the means by
which to include financing in their aircraft bids," he said.</p>
<p>For weeks, industry observers had been waiting for UAL's
United Airlines unit to announce its record order for as many
as 150 jetliners. United was negotiating with Boeing, Airbus
Industrie and McDonnell Douglas Corp. for the planes,
industry sources said.</p>
<p>At the same time, members of the buy-out group have met
with airlines and suppliers in the U.S. and Europe, seeking
support for their financing efforts. The potential investors
are believed to have included Boeing, Airbus Industrie,
General Electric, Rolls-Royce PLC, British Airways PLC and
Guinness Peat Aviation, a leasing firm.</p>
<p>While Boeing wouldn't comment on the state of what a
spokesman calls "intense" talks with United about its fleet
needs, any United-Boeing deal would have the potential to be
a landmark for the Seattle-based aircraft manufacturer.</p>
<p>Boeing counts United among its strongest customers
historically. And United is considered a prime candidate to
place one of the several big orders Boeing would need to
launch its proposed 767-X airliner, a 350-seat plane designed
to compete with Airbus A-330s and A-340s and McDonnell
Douglas MD-11s that are much farther along in the development
process. The 767X would be designated the 777 when Boeing
formally launches the plane.</p>
<p>The Boeing spokesman confirmed that the 767-X and the
company's highest-priced product, the four-engine 747-400,
have been involved in the negotiations with United.</p>
<p>Boeing's order-taking this year, while strong, has been
lagging behind last year's record clip. More than $32 billion
of Boeing planes were ordered in the 1989 first half. United
placed orders for narrow-bodied Boeing 737s and 757s in April
1989 in a $7 billion transaction, potentially worth more than
twice that amount if all options are exercised. At the time,
UAL Chairman Stephen M. Wolf said that order, as well as the
order now delayed, were designed to stop United's "erosion of
market share and put us back in a vigorous growth mode."</p>
<p>In 1987, Boeing's close relationship with United took on a
new dimension when terms of the sale of 11 Boeing 747-400s
called for Boeing to acquire $700 million of notes issued by
United's parent company. That seller-financing arrangement
was widely seen as a way for Boeing to help United fend off a
hostile takeover.</p>
<p>A spokeswoman for the Douglas Aircraft unit of St.
Louis-based McDonnell Douglas wouldn't comment on United's
decision to delay talks. She added that United currently
operates DC-10s, and has been discussing the possible
purchase of 350-seat MD-11s as replacements. McDonnell
Douglas expects to deliver the first of the new MD-11s to
airline customers in the fourth quarter.</p>
<p>An Airbus spokesman, saying the United decision reflects
"a very dynamic situation" at the airline, said that his
company "will be back there at the table when the opportunity
presents itself again." Airbus "remains enthusiastic" about
the prospect of selling United a mix of 295-seat A-340s and
335-seat A-330s, he said.</p>
