	<p class="article-leader">ST. LOUIS -- The beer industry, led by Anheuser-Busch
Cos., is about to launch an intense lobbying effort to head
off an increase in the federal excise tax on beer.
   Built around the theme, "Can the Beer Tax," the blitz is
meant to alert the nation's estimated 80 million beer
drinkers to the likelihood of a tax increase. Newspaper ads
are to run early next week. Broadcast ads are being
developed.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The ads are part of a wide-ranging campaign to ignite
public ire over what the industry calls an unfair, regressive
tax that would hurt the working man but do little to shrink
the deficit. Last week, President Bush said that tax
increases are needed to narrow the deficit. Higher taxes on
alcohol, tobacco and gasoline are considered a strong
possibility.</p>
<p>Anheuser, the world's largest brewer, and its competitors
are worried that any tax increase would depress already flat
sales.</p>
<p>The federal excise tax on beer, now $9 a barrel, hasn't
been raised since 1951, although most states have since
tapped the so-called "sin tax" as a revenue source.</p>
<p>Industry sources speculate that the tax could be raised
anywhere from 100% to perhaps 600%. The Beer Institute, a
Washington trade group, estimates that a doubling of the tax
would result in a 4% volume decline in retail sales. The
current federal excise tax on a six-pack costing $3 is 16
cents. A doubling of the tax, then, would add another 16
cents, but the institute estimates that the total increase
would be about 25 cents because of price rises during
distribution.</p>
<p>The lobbying campaign also is to include calls on
congressional members by beer distributors, petitions
circulated at country-music concerts, briefing books for the
media, banners flown over beaches and an 800 phone number
that triggers a personalized letter to the caller's
legislator.</p>
<p>While some tactics, including print ads, have been in
preparation for months, President Bush's recent reversal on
taxes threw an Anheuser task force into high gear, working
through the holiday on Wednesday. "We ruined a lot of
people's Fourth," one company executive said. "This is an
uphill battle," said another.</p>
<p>A 100% increase in the excise tax on beer would raise
perhaps $1.5 billion, according to the Beer Institute. "No
one at Anheuser-Busch is against evenhanded efforts to curb
the federal deficit . . . but excise taxes are anything but
evenhanded," say letters written by the company's chairman
and chief executive officer, August A. Busch III, to
employees, wholesalers and suppliers. The letters argue that
any tax would "hurt the business performance of our . . .
entire industry for years to come."</p>
<p>Although the summit talks haven't turned to specific tax
increases, higher alcohol and tobacco taxes are among
possibilities mentioned by negotiators. Besides raising
money, advocates say, the levies would discourage consumption
of harmful substances. But Democrats protest that relying
heavily on consumption or sales taxes would be regressive.
And some Republicans say the taxes wouldn't raise enough
money to compensate for the political controversy that would
provoke.</p>
<p>Anheuser's lobbying actually began on the Fourth of July,
when some of its 960 distributors used parades and festivals
to buttonhole politicians and distribute petitions. In
Connecticut, the state beer wholesalers association hired a
plane to drag a "Can the Beer Tax" banner along the coast. In
Texas, industry representatives sought petition signatures at
various "freedom" festivals and at the Waylon Jennings-Willie
Nelson concert in Austin.</p>
<p>In Jasper, Georgia, a life-size replica of a Clydesdale
horse with a banner urging voters to contact their
congressmen and senators appeared in a parade. The grand
marshal was Sen. Wyche Fowler Jr., a Democrat and part of the
bipartisan budget summit group, the membership of which is
targeted for heavy lobbying.</p>
<p>Anheuser's plans, part of what it calls Operation
Preparedness, also include speakers on taxes who can be
booked on radio talk shows; a minority interest group
speakers bureau; "Ax the Tax" nights at American Legion
halls; and plans to capitalize on media interest in the
advertising campaign itself. Another possibility, if the bugs
can be worked out, is a computer game called "You Balance the
Budget."</p>
<p>Newspaper ads, which will appear across the country
starting Monday, show a woman wearing a large diamond
bracelet and holding a can of beer. The copy, which says
Americans already pay more excise tax on the beer than the
jewels, urges beer drinkers to make Congress "read our lips"
and gives an 800 number to call. The ads are signed by the
Beer Institute.</p>
<p>While Anheuser is considering radio and television ads
with its own signature, Miller Brewing Co., the nation's No.
2 brewer, "won't be doing any advertising," says a
spokeswoman for the Philip Morris Cos. unit. "We believe the
Beer Institute is doing a fine job of explaining how we
feel."</p>
