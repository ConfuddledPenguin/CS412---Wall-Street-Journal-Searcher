	<p class="article-leader">PRAGUE -- The most curious Fourth of July parade of the
year formed in the wide boulevard known to the world as
Wenceslas Square. Under overcast and chilly skies,
unrecognizable flags flowed up the avenue between planters of
red petunias and around concentric circles of marigolds and
geraniums. Beneath the statue of a mounted St. Wenceslas,
with the neo-Renaissance National Museum looming behind, 50
or so marchers stopped before an unplanted muddy circle,
dipped their flags, laid red, yellow and white carnations,
and departed in silence.
   The carnations bedecked a ring of paraffin, innumerable
candles having burned themselves into a wall around the mud.
Within this fortification stood many five-liter jars and cans
for flowers, a stake with a braided tinfoil crown, and
pictures of Czech heroes. At the center was the largest, a
photo of young Jan Palach, who burned himself to death on
this spot in January 1969 in protest of the quenching of
Prague's Spring by Soviet tanks a few months earlier.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>One of the flags -- green, red and blue bars with a star
and crescent -- flew over an independent Azerbaijan from 1918
to 1920. Free Georgia lasted from 1918 to 1921; its flag had
a maroon field, with a black bar over a white bar in the
corner. "Black for the past, white for the future, and maroon
for the robe of Christ buried in Georgia," its bearer
explained. There were also luckier flags, those of Lithuania,
Latvia and Estonia, restored to use in their homelands in the
past two years. The one recognizable flag was that of Israel,
flown for Soviet Jewry. The most curious was a blue
background with a yellow symbol looking like a horseshoe
divided by a bar; it was the symbol of the Crimean Tatars,
dating from the third or fourth century.</p>
<p>The marchers had come to one of the world's newest
democracies to celebrate the American Declaration of
Independence 214 years earlier. Some had carried their flags
from within the Soviet Union, and some from various places of
exile around the world. They sought for their homelands the
independence and democracy of America and Czechoslovakia.
Czech President Vaclav Havel welcomed them at the July 4
opening of "The Peaceful Road to Democracy," their three-day
public conference. "You are dissidents; this means you are
people who are waging your struggle on the basis of the ideal
of human rights." He added that he too had been a dissident
and political prisoner, and had learned "the indivisibility
of freedom and justice. If they are threatened anywhere they
are threatened everywhere."</p>
<p>These Soviets and former Soviets had hard-won credentials
as democrats. The meeting was organized by prominent exiles;
it was opened by author Vladimir Bukovsky and Armenian leader
Paruyr Hayrikyan. They were joined by equally brave souls who
still reside in the Soviet Union, including world chess
champion Gary Kasparov and Gennadi Burbulis, spokesman for
the anti-Gorbachev interregional group within the official
Congress of People's Deputies. They joined in a simple
message: The West should understand that Mikhail Gorbachev
does not represent reform.</p>
<p>"Unable to govern and concerned only about preserving
their own power, Gorbachev and his colleagues in the
leadership are willingly or unwillingly dragging the country
toward the abyss of civil war," declares the delegates'
resolution, the Prague Appeal. "We appeal to the public and
the governments of the West not to support Gorbachev and his
`perestroika' which is pushing the country to the brink of
destruction. Your support is needed by the democratic forces
opposing the communist regime."</p>
<p>A question about Mr. Gorbachev sets off an emotional round
of statements from various delegates. It was under Mr.
Gorbachev, they point out, that troops were sent into Tbilisi
and Baku; bloodshed has already occurred. Under Mr.
Gorbachev, they say, the KGB continues to foment ethnic
strife; the nationalist, anti-Semitic Pamyat "exists only
because of the KGB." Despite hard-line attacks on Mr.
Gorbachev's policies at the current Party Congress, the
delegates see Mr. Gorbachev as the hard-liners' man and his
reforms as mere concessions to the reality that the system
has not worked.</p>
<p>The Soviet Union is "the disappearing state," says chess
champion Kasparov, and Western worries about a hard-line
alternative without Mr. Gorbachev are "a Christmas tale." The
delegates complain that "the West has underestimated or even
ignored the democratic forces emerging inside." They point
out that Pamyat candidates pulled only 1% of the vote in
elections. Despite shooting in the Caucasian republics, they
take a benign view of the Red Army; Mr. Bukovsky says the
troops "are people; they have families."</p>
<p>Most of all, delegates don't want a new leader; they want
a much bigger change. "We are not an opposition to the
Communist Party within the system; we want to end the entire
totalitarian system," says Sergei Skripnikov of the
Democratic Union in Moscow. "The people of the Ukraine have
been part of the most terrible experiment in the history of
mankind, the making of a new society in the name of Marx and
Lenin," says Anatoly Shibyko of Rukh, the Ukrainian group he
says counted 280,000 members as of September.</p>
<p>These attitudes leave an ambivalence about Boris Yeltsin,
who is seen in the West as the main democratic opponent of
Mr. Gorbachev -- but who, after all, has played a prominent
part in the Communist system. Anatoly Koryagin, a
psychiatrist jailed and exiled for opposing political abuse
of psychiatry, sees Messrs. Gorbachev and Yeltsin in
alliance, or potential alliance, to perpetuate the system by
combining Mr. Gorbachev's popularity outside the Soviet Union
and Mr. Yeltsin's popularity within. Mr. Bukovsky, while
saying Mr. Yeltsin retains much of his socialist outlook,
sees him as a positive step: "He's evolving; he's
developing."</p>
<p>The prospect of Western aid for the present regime leaves
the delegates here nearly frantic. Mr. Kasparov derides
attitudes of Western leaders, for example a statement by
Margaret Thatcher that reunification of Germany might become
an issue "in the next 10 years," and complains that the West
is now readying $18 billion to $20 billion in aid for the
Soviet Union. Armando Valladares, the most famous exile from
Fidel Castro's prisons, notes that the Soviet Union still
provides an unrepentent Castro with massive financial
support, and observes, "Aid the Soviet Union receives from
the West should not be used to maintain a dictatorship in
Cuba."</p>
<p>Some of the rhetoric in the conference hall here carries
echoes of political exiles throughout history. Pretenders to
this throne have wandered the world for generations waiting
for their opponents to collapse from within. And with the
small exiled bands comes an amateurish streak, as when a huge
map of Soviet republics is taken down just before the
official opening, apparently because of its depiction of
Nagorno-Karabakh, the Armenian enclave in Azerbaijan.</p>
<p>Yet, in fact, the open and civilized debate over
Nagorno-Karabakh at the conference is truly impressive,
especially since both Armenian and Azeri delegates agree that
the recent inter-ethnic conflict was provoked from Moscow.
And the lost-cause echoes die when the listener remembers
that half of the delegates come from within the Soviet Union.
Especially so after the events of 1989, when communist
regimes here in Czechoslovakia and elsewhere in Eastern
Europe did indeed crack from within, despite secret police
and local and even Soviet troops. Given this, surely Western
governments and opinion leaders ought at least to listen to
the kind of voices heard here.</p>
<p>Paruyr Hayrikyan, forcibly exiled to Ethiopia in 1988, won
91% of the vote when he ran for a seat in the Armenian
Supreme Soviet in the elections last May. Paul Weyrich, the
American political activist, reports that when he tried to
get Vice President Dan Quayle to present a dinner award to
Mr. Hayrikyan, the White House decided the exile was "a
destabilizing influence." Similarly, delegates here are still
angry over the shabby White House reception of Lithuanian
Prime Minister Kazimiera Prunskiene, who was stopped for gate
security like an everyday visitor.</p>
<p>The exiles here, too, have personally earned a hearing by
simple human courage. Mr. Hayrikyan spent 16 years in Soviet
labor camps. Mr. Bukovsky served 12, Mr. Koryagin seven.
Ayshe Seytmuratova served three as spokeswoman for the
Crimean Tatars, whom Stalin forcibly relocated to Central
Asia. Poetess Irina Ratushinskaya was sentenced to 12 years
including 120 days of solitary confinement, although she was
released early -- two days before the Reykjavik summit.</p>
<p>Others tell stories even more related to the symbolism of
a Prague July Fourth. Yakov Suslensky, a Jewish activist now
in Israel, was sentenced to seven years for writing a letter
opposing the 1968 invasion of Czechoslovakia. Vladimir
Dremlyuaga served six years as one of seven Russians
protesting the invasion in Red Square -- the first Russian
political demonstration, he says, in 51 years. Petro Ruban, a
woodcarver, served a total of 22 years; one of his four
arrests was for sculpting a Statue of Liberty to celebrate
the American bicentennial.</p>
<p>Western leaders and Western governments have been
instrumental in rescuing most of these people from Soviet
prison camps, but tend to ignore them once they are free.
Western governments are understandably interested in the
welfare of their own people, not in righting the wrongs of
Soviet society. But exiles can claim some painfully won
understanding of the forces in their own society. And after
1989, there's room to wonder which is the best practitioner
of "Realpolitik," the State Department or the exiles.</p>
<p>In any event, whether celebrated with strange flags or
not, the Fourth of July is about more than fireworks and
barbecues. The century in which we live has horrors worse
than taxation without representation, but Jefferson's words
still ring of something deep in the nature of man. The
Soviets who gathered to celebrate Independence Day in Prague
came only to claim their inalienable rights.</p>
