	<p class="article-leader">Federal thrift regulators brought administrative charges
against Thomas Spiegel, the former chief executive officer of
Columbia Savings & Loan Association, alleging a spending
spree with federally backed deposits and seeking a record $24
million in restitution and penalties.
   The Office of Thrift Supervision alleged that Mr. Spiegel
used funds from the Beverly Hills, Calif., thrift to pay for
European travel for him and his wife, a $55,000 gun
collection including Uzi submachine guns and automatic
pistols, $7,000 in tickets to a Michael Jackson concert, and
personal use of Columbia Savings aircraft and four resort
condominiums.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The thrift office said one of the condominiums, in Jackson
Hole, Wyo., was used almost exclusively by Michael Milken,
the former Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. junk-bond chief who
pleaded guilty earlier this year to securities fraud, and his
brother, attorney Lowell Milken, without reimbursing
Columbia.</p>
<p>As part of the restitution, the office is seeking $6.4
million from Mr. Spiegel for losses allegedly suffered by
Columbia in a partnership with Michael Milken that bought two
30-seat jets and built a luxury airplane hangar. Neither of
the Milken brothers was charged with any wrongdoing. Columbia
Savings bought several billion dollars of high-yield,
high-risk junk bonds from Drexel.</p>
<p>In a statement, Mr. Spiegel said he was "outraged" at the
thrift office decision and forcefully denies all of the
charges. He said the office had refused to meet with his
attorneys to discuss the allegations and to give him a "fair
chance to respond."</p>
<p>His statement continued: ". . . historically, OTS and its
predecessors have been abysmal failures and now, in panic and
for purely political reasons, OTS is seeking scapegoats to
divert public attention from its gross incompetence." Mr.
Spiegel is being represented by New York criminal defense
lawyer Robert Morvillo, who recently successfully defended
Saudi businessman Adnan Khashoggi against charges linked to
former Philippine First Lady Imelda Marcos.</p>
<p>The case against Mr. Spiegel is an important one for the
thrift office. Not only was it initiated on the same day the
office announced a new policy of making such administrative
actions public, but it is the largest number of charges, the
largest restitution, and the largest civil fine ever sought
from an individual by the agency.</p>
<p>Also, Congress, responding to constituents' outrage about
the costs of the S&L bailout, is in a paroxysm of election
season denunciation of S&L crime and will be watching the
case carefully. If the allegations are proven, Mr. Spiegel
would join the list of S&L executives who have used thrifts
as personal piggy banks.</p>
<p>Thrift office director Timothy Ryan wouldn't say whether
any criminal action was being sought against Mr. Spiegel, but
he said the Justice Department was involved in the
investigation that led to the administrative charges. He also
said the thrift office is investigating "at least three other
institutions" and their junk-bond dealings with Drexel.</p>
<p>The administrative action comes as Columbia is being
required, under last year's savings-and-loan bailout law, to
liquidate its once hugely profitable junk-bond holdings.
Currently valued at about $2.9 billion, the portfolio has
declined in value by about $1 billion over the last six
months, leaving Columbia insolvent and on the verge of
federal takeover. Company officials have expressed confidence
that they will be able to sell the bonds, however, to help
minimize the institution's losses.</p>
<p>Mr. Spiegel, whose father Abraham is Columbia's chairman,
resigned under pressure as Columbia's president and chief
executive in December and was a consultant until this past
spring.</p>
<p>In addition to the costs for the airplanes, the thrift
office is seeking the following restitution:</p>
<p>-- $2.9 million for a bonus paid to Mr. Spiegel last year.
Regulators objected when Columbia paid Mr. Spiegel a $3
million bonus, the thrift office said, and in response, Mr.
Spiegel returned $600,000. The office is seeking the return
of the remaining $2.4 million plus interest.</p>
<p>-- $5.7 million for losses allegedly incurred by Columbia
on $28 million in loans made to Howard Schneider, a luxury
auto dealer and friend of Mr. Spiegel. The office said Mr.
Schneider lent Mr. Spiegel a Mercedes 560 SEL and a Bentley
while the loans were being negotiated. The office alleged the
loans were made at below-market interest rates and weren't
properly documented. Mr. Schneider wasn't charged with
wrongdoing.</p>
<p>-- $2.4 million for allegedly unauthorized payments made
to a charitable foundation controlled by Mr. Spiegel. The
thrift office said most of the foundation assets were
invested in junk bonds and Columbia stock.</p>
<p>-- $1.1 million for the alleged personal use of four
condominiums owned by Columbia, including two in Jackson
Hole, one in Indian Wells, Calif., and one in Deer Valley,
Utah.</p>
<p>-- $463,000 allegedly used for personal expenses,
including four trips to Europe for Mr. Spiegel and his wife,
$55,000 in guns, the Michael Jackson tickets and also tickets
to a Steve Winwood concert, $2,000 for a French wine-tasting
course and $1,700 for silverware.</p>
<p>The total restitution of $19 million would go to Columbia.
The thrift office is also seeking $5 million in civil
penalties that would go to the government.</p>
<p>The action freezes Mr. Spiegel's funds and assets with any
financial institution until he establishes an escrow account
or puts up other security to guarantee the restitution. He is
also prohibited from voting his Columbia stock. Mr. Ryan of
the thrift office said the agency is convinced Mr. Spiegel
has the wealth to pay the restitution and fine. The office
also is seeking to bar Mr. Spiegel from working in any
federally insured bank or thrift in the future.</p>
<p>Mr. Spiegel has 20 days to reply to the thrift office and
request a hearing.</p>
<p>Mr. Spiegel's compensation at Columbia has long been an
issue for regulators. In 1985, for instance, he earned an
estimated $9 million in salary and benefits, roughly 17 times
what the chairman of the nation's largest S&L was making.
Columbia was also the top-earning S&L in the country at that
time, but the package drew a public rebuke from federal
thrift regulators.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, regulators ordered that a $500,000
annual consulting fee that Mr. Spiegel was receiving from
Columbia be reduced to $1 a year.</p>
