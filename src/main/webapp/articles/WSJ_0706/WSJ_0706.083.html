	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- Assets of the nation's 513 money market
funds fell $2.24 billion to $382.7 billion in the week ended
July 4, according to the Investment Company Institute, a
trade association here.
   Assets of 250 general purpose funds fell $723.9 million to
$133.21 billion, and assets of 102 broker-dealer funds fell
$1.29 billion to $157.88 billion. Assets of 161 institutional
funds fell $222.8 million to $91.61 billion.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Individual accounts were most affected by the decline in
money market fund assets. Dr. Jacob Dreyer, vice president
and chief economist at the institute, said, "Strong advances
in prices of stocks and bonds in the week preceding the
Fourth of July drew some money out of short-term funds,
especially those in the broker-dealer category, and into
long-term funds."</p>
