	<p class="article-leader">LOS ANGELES -- The Gallery of History, with its elegant
displays of rare documents signed by notables from John F.
Kennedy to Lou Gehrig, looks like a museum. Except, of
course, for the price tags.
   Here in a corner of the cavernous Beverly Center shopping
mall, customers can plunk down the plastic for a beautifully
mounted battlefield communication from Napoleon ($29,995).
Film fans can snap up a handsome frame containing signed
memorabilia from "Gone With the Wind" ($19,950). And cradled
in mahogany is the ultimate gift for an Americana buff:
Abraham Lincoln's famous letter to Grace Bedell, the young
girl who suggested he grow a beard to help win the
presidency.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Price? $1.25 million.</p>
<p>Once no one would have dreamed that Honest Abe's mail
would be peddled in a mall store right next door to Banana
Republic, the safari-theme clothier. But these days,
manuscripts are hot commodities. Emancipated from dusty
vaults and archives, they are popping up on the shelves of
retailers eager to place them on living room and office walls
around the U.S. (Until the publicly traded Gallery of History
chain bought the Lincoln letter a few years ago from a
private collector, the prized manuscript had been kept in a
safety deposit box.)</p>
<p>A new breed of document hounds, some with dollar signs in
their eyes, is flooding the field once dominated by a small
circle of scholars, dealers and private collectors. The
demand has sent prices spiraling.</p>
<p>Inevitably, the old guard is squaring off against the new.
Old-line collectors say newcomers often treat pieces as
high-yield investments rather than irreplaceable historical
documents. They also warn that those jumping on the bandwagon
for profit may get burned by the vagaries of speculation in
the burgeoning market, overpricing based on fancy packaging
gimmicks, and even forgers.</p>
<p>"If you want to invest in manuscripts, buy CDs and
Treasury notes," sniffs Dr. William Coleman, a philographer
for more than 35 years and past director of the Manuscript
Society, an august group of document hobbyists. Collectors
should buy because they appreciate the material, he argues,
not because they hope to make a killing.</p>
<p>Others decry the trend toward framed documents being
retailed as art. "Serious collectors don't buy framed
material," says Dr. Norman Boas, a retired Mystic, Conn.,
physician who has collected Lincolnalia and other
presidential manuscripts for nearly half a century.</p>
<p>Todd M. Axelrod, Gallery of History's founder, dismisses
the criticism as sour grapes. "I took the ball away from the
East Coast establishment," snaps Mr. Axelrod, who calls
documents "the last `collectible' of unique, one-of-a-kind
pieces that is still within the reach of the middle class."
Other Gallery sites include New York, Dallas, Washington and
its headquarters city, Las Vegas, Nev.</p>
<p>Many collectors and dealers contend that Mr. Axelrod and
others selling framed documents charge inflated prices for
pieces that could be bought at auction for hundreds,
thousands, and occasionally even tens of thousands of dollars
less.</p>
<p>"There's a place for these retail galleries if you're
investing in a piece of furniture," says Herman Darvick, a
Rockville Centre, N.Y., dealer and past president of the
Universal Autograph Collectors Club, whose membership is
considered a bit more casual than the Manuscript Society's.
"But don't buy it as an investment, because you're investing
in a frame." Selling pricey framed pieces as investments, he
says, gives document dealers "a bad name."</p>
<p>A rare sketch of Mickey Mouse signed by Walt Disney,
mounted with the entrepreneur's photo and an explanatory
plaque, is priced at $79,995 at the Los Angeles Gallery of
History store. (Almost all of the store's pieces come with a
photograph or other piece of art and a plaque.) Mr. Darvick
says he sold a signed Mickey Mouse piece to Mr. Axelrod in
February for about $11,000. Mr. Axelrod, seated in his Las
Vegas office surrounded by rare documents, says he paid Mr.
Darvick more than that for the Disney work, and was unsure
whether the piece was the same one on display here.</p>
<p>Mr. Axelrod concedes that consumers can buy unframed
manuscripts for less through auctions and other dealers, but
says his company offers an inventory of more than 100,000
documents -- one of the nation's largest private document
collections -- preserved to "Library of Congress standards."
The research and 10 year guarantee of authenticity, he says,
give the consumer a "measure of comfort" from dealing with an
established enterprise.</p>
<p>Although splashy pieces tend to grab attention -- there's
a $33,000 Richard Nixon letter about Vietnam on display here,
along with a $55,000 display signed by all seven astronauts
from the ill-fated Challenger mission -- Mr. Axelrod says the
average purchase is between $2,000 and $3,000.</p>
<p>In that price range, buyers can get well-known sports and
entertainment figures such as Jimmy Stewart, James Cagney and
Ty Cobb. Right now, some of the more popular historical
figures, whose documents often sell for much more, are Albert
Einstein and John F. Kennedy. Abraham Lincoln, a perennial
favorite, is also particularly hot at the moment.</p>
<p>No one disputes that historical documents are often
undervalued when compared with art, coins and other
collectibles. "I find a lot of parallels to the stamp and
coin business," says Ira Goldberg, president of Superior
Stamp & Coin Co., a Beverly Hills, Calif., auction house that
recently conducted the Manuscript Society's annual auction.
As investments, he says, "autographs are 25 years behind the
times." Many manuscripts by U.S. presidents, for example,
fetch only a few hundred to a few thousand dollars, as do
documents associated with notables such as Amelia Earhart,
Irving Berlin, Frank Lloyd Wright and Charles Lindbergh.</p>
<p>Joseph Maddalena, a Beverly Hills dealer, contends that
clashes between older and newer collectors are inevitable as
their numbers swell from a few thousand to an estimated
100,000 within a few years, and prices for quality pieces
appreciate at double-digit rates.</p>
<p>The presence of free-spending, well-financed collectors
such as late publisher Malcolm Forbes and industrialist
Armand Hammer has publicized the allure of old autographs.
Blue-chip document buffs have helped auction houses such as
Sotheby's, both in terms of strong prices for quality works
and in broadening the market. "There's more depth to the
market now," says Marsha Malinowski, senior cataloger for
European and American literary manuscripts. "Before, you
could count the heavy hitters on one hand."</p>
<p>Document collectors must be on the lookout for fakes. At
the recent Manuscript Society auction in Los Angeles, a rare
letter supposedly written by religious leader Mary Baker Eddy
was withdrawn when it turned out to be the handiwork of
Joseph Cosey, a notoriously skillful American forger. (Cosey
forgeries are sought by some collectors who admire his
talent.)</p>
<p>Kenneth W. Rendell, a Newton, Mass., document expert who
was hired by Newsweek magazine to examine the "Hitler
Diaries" in 1983 and who declared them forgeries, recommends
that consumers buy only from reputable dealers offering
unconditional lifetime authenticity guarantees. Be leery, he
adds, of those who offer 30-day guarantees and refuse to
publish prices. But Mr. Rendell says the fear of forgery
shouldn't keep prospective collectors out of the field.
"Fraud has to be kept in perspective," he says.</p>
<p>There are other perils for the uninitiated, including
automated-pen signatures that perfectly reproduce the
signatures of busy politicians and celebrities, and public
relations firms and secretaries that routinely crank out
their employers' John Hancocks. Mr. Rendell and some other
dealers say they shy away from Hollywood memorabilia, along
with much of the work of modern presidents and most living
persons, for those reasons.</p>
<p>As is true with other investments, says Mr. Darvick, the
Rockville Centre dealer: "If you shop for bargains, you're
going to get burned."</p>
