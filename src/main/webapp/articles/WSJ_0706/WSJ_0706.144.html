	<p class="article-leader">SAN JOSE, Calif. -- Altos Computer Systems said it agreed
in principle to be acquired by Acer Group, a Taiwan computer
maker, for $94 million.
   The $8.35-a-share offer is considerably higher than the
range of $4.87 a share to $7.37 a share that Altos stock has
traded in since January. However, news of the offer sharply
pushed up Altos's share price in national over-the-counter
trading yesterday. The stock closed at $8.25, up 87.5 cents
from Tuesday's close of $7.375.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Altos, which had been shopping for a suitor, first
disclosed its discussions with Acer last week. The U.S.
company, a maker of multiuser computer networks, has stumbled
in recent quarters, the result of bloated inventories and
higher-than-anticipated costs associated with new products.</p>
<p>Under the terms of the buy-out, Altos would be operated as
a separate unit of Acer, maintaining its own corporate name
and products. The Acer offer gives Altos "the critical mass
and name recognition" it needs to grow, said Ron Conway,
president of Altos.</p>
<p>Acer, a maker of IBM-compatible computers, said the
buy-out would help Acer improve the systems capabilities of
its laptop and notebook-size computers. Acer is Taiwan's
largest computer maker, with more than $700 million in
revenue; the company has a network of 10,000 dealers in more
than 70 countries.</p>
<p>Altos designs, makes and markets multiuser computer
networks for distribution in about 60 countries. For its
third fiscal quarter ended March 31, the company posted a net
loss of $1.7 million, or 16 cents a share, on sales of $32.6
million. A year earlier, it had a loss of $3.7 million, or 31
cents a share, on revenue of $32.4 million.</p>
