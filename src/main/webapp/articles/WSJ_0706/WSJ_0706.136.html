	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Shearson Lehman Hutton Holdings Inc. has
scheduled its annual meeting Aug. 9 for a shareholder vote on
becoming a wholly owned subsidiary of American Express Co.
   Holders of record June 15 will be asked to vote on a
proposal to approve the previously announced merger agreement
with American Express. Under the terms of the agreement, the
travel and financial services company would acquire the
roughly 30% of the brokerage firm's common shares outstanding
that it doesn't already own.</p>
