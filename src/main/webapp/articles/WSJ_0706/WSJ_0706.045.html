	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Minneapolis investor Irwin Jacobs and Amway
Corp. have sold most of their stake in Avon Products Inc. to
two partners in Chartwell Associates L.P., Avon's largest
shareholder.
   Mr. Jacobs said he sold the shares because he recently
concluded that a hostile takeover of Avon was impossible. The
stock purchase, however, appears to give Chartwell greater
bargaining leverage with Avon management, Wall Street
analysts said. Although few believe a tender offer is
imminent, one analyst said Avon's management may be pressured
into leading a leveraged buy-out of the giant cosmetics and
gift company.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Altogether Chartwell acquired 3.976 million shares of Avon
from A/J Partnership, which is controlled by Mr. Jacobs and
Amway, a direct-selling company based in Ada, Mich. Chartwell
paid approximately $37.50 a share, or $149.1 million, for a
stake equivalent to 7% of Avon's common. Chartwell also
agreed to buy another 1.233 million Avon shares from A/J
Partnership within 30 days.</p>
<p>Chartwell's acquisition follows a court decision last week
invalidating an attempt by Avon to reduce the threshold of
the company's share rights plan to 12.5% from 20%. If the
courts had ruled in favor of Avon, Chartwell would have been
forced to keep its Avon holdings under that 12.5% level or
activate the anti-takeover defenses.</p>
<p>When both purchases are complete, Chartwell will own 14.8
million shares of Avon common, or 26.2%. According to John
Cox, an Avon spokesman, Chartwell's voting stake will then
amount to 19.8%, slightly below the 20% level at which Avon's
shareholder-rights plan becomes effective. Included among
Chartwell's holdings are 50,000 shares of Avon preferred.</p>
<p>In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange
yesterday, Avon shares closed at $37, down 75 cents apiece.</p>
<p>Chartwell includes Mary Kay Corp. Vice Chairman John
Rochon; the Fisher real estate family of New York, and oil
heir Gordon Getty. The shares purchased from A/J Parthership
were acquired by Mr. Getty and the Fisher family a little
more than a week after a pact calling for Mr. Rochon to serve
as an Avon consultant ended suddenly. Avon and Chartwell had
agreed to Mr. Rochon's presence, as well as the creation of a
special advisory committee and the election of two Chartwell
candidates to Avon's board, as part of an accord to avoid a
costly tender fight.</p>
<p>In an interview, Mr. Jacobs said he sold the stake because
he had lost faith in Avon's management and because he has
concluded that circumstances today "make it impossible to do
a hostile takeover. I decided there is no longer any reason
for us to have positions in our portfolio of a hostile
sense."</p>
<p>Thus resolved, the investor said he called the Fisher
brothers last week and indicated the block was available.
Final details weren't worked out until yesterday morning, Mr.
Jacobs said.</p>
<p>Although the Fishers -- together with Mr. Getty -- agreed
to buy 5.2 million of the 5.7 million shares held by the
Jacobs-Amway partnership, Mr. Jacobs declined to say whether
A/J Partnership continues to hold any Avon shares.</p>
<p>Mr. Jacobs wouldn't say why the sale is being done in two
parts, other than to cite "technical reasons." The investor
said the partnership realized a profit of about $63 million
and netted slightly more than $50 million after carrying
costs. Documents filed with the Securities and Exchange
Commission show that the partnership paid between $21.875 and
$32.29 for its shares.</p>
<p>Amway and Mr. Jacobs separately made offers to acquire
Avon last year but each were rebuffed.</p>
<p>An Avon spokesman said the company wasn't surprised that
Mr. Jacobs and Amway had agreed to sell their shares. "We
never thought of A/J Partnership as long-term investors, and
the sale of their stock eliminates a major source of
instability in Avon's ownership," said Mr. Cox. "Chartwell
has said it is a long-term investor, and their acquisition
today would seem to confirm that." James Preston, chairman
and chief executive officer of Avon, declined to be
interviewed.</p>
<p>Analysts who follow Avon suggested that the new Chartwell
acquisitions will give the partnership additional clout with
Avon management but they doubt a tender offer is likely soon.</p>
<p>"What this does is give Chartwell a stronger hand in terms
of influencing management," said Abraham Karp, president of
the Karp Financial Group, a Tarrytown, N.Y., institutional
research firm. "Avon let a superb machine run down, and
Chartwell will now push to make the company more profitable."</p>
<p>Andrew Shore, an analyst with Prudential-Bache Securities
Inc., suggested that Chartwell may be trying to force Avon's
management to take the company private.</p>
<p>"There really isn't a strong reason for Avon to be public
because the company doesn't have capital needs," said Mr.
Shore. "When the domestic business achieves the right profit
margins, the business is self-financed." Although Mr. Shore
believes a tender offer is unlikely at this time, he
suggested that a bid of $41 a share would be enough to win
Avon.</p>
