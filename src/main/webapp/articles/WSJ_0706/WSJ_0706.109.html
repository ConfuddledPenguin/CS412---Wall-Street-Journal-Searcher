	<p class="article-leader">SYDNEY -- Arco Coal Australia Inc. said it reached
tentative agreement with a number of Japanese and European
steelmakers for the purchase of coal from a proposed new mine
near Emerald in the state of Queensland.
   Production capacity at the proposed Gordonstone
underground mine is about four million metric tons a year
with reserves of about 900 million tons, said Arco Coal
Australia, a unit of Los Angeles-based Atlantic Richfield Co.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Development of the mine would cost about 500 million
Australian dollars (US$399 million) and take more than two
years, Arco Coal Australia estimated. The company has a 65.5%
interest in Gordonstone. Suncorp, controlled by the
Queensland government, has a 29.5% stake and Lend Lease Corp.
of Australia has the remaining 5% interest.</p>
<p>Ian Knight, managing director of Gordonstone Coal
Management Pty. Ltd., the venture that would develop the
mine, said a memorandum of understanding has been reached
with Japanese steelmakers for a five-year coal shipment
beginning in 1992 and rising to an annual rate of 1.2 million
tons in the third year. The company also has purchase
agreements with some Western European government-owned
enterprises, he said.</p>
<p>The venture still needs various Australian government
approvals and approval from Atlantic Richfield's board of
directors. "It's on the agenda for the last week of this
month," said a spokesman for Arco's Coal division in Denver.
Arco Coal Australia is making agreements with customers
before a final decision is reached to proceed with developing
the mine.</p>
