	<p class="article-leader">MADRID -- A Spanish gas utility being set up by
state-controlled oil firm Repsol S.A. and savings bank La
Caixa will offer shares to outside investors, in a public
flotation that could be worth between 45 billion pesetas and
80 billion pesetas ($445.1 million and $791.3 million).
   Repsol Chairman Oscar Fanjul said the two partners are in
discussions with Spain's National Stock Market Commission
over details of a plan to merge their gas interests,
announced last week.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Depending on the results of an audit and the size of the
assets to be transferred by both partners, Mr. Fanjul said
the new mega-utility is expected to be worth between 90
billion pesetas and 170 billion pesetas. Its shares will be
listed on the stock exchange through a public flotation that
could take place some time in the first half of 1991, he said
in an interview.</p>
<p>The project calls for the formation of a holding company
jointly owned by La Caixa and the state oil and gas agency
Instituto Nacional de Hidrocarburos, which controls Repsol.
INH will hold its 50% stake through Repsol and its sister
company, Enagas S.A, the state gas firm.</p>
<p>The joint holding company, in turn, will own at least 51%
of a mega-utility controlling local gas utilities whose
capital will be open to outside shareholders.</p>
<p>Neither of the two companies to be created has yet been
given a name, and details of the project will be determined
after an audit of both firms' gas interests.</p>
<p>However, the new utility's principal assets will be
controlling stakes in Barcelona-based Catalana de Gas S.A.,
of which La Caixa owns 24% and Repsol 14%, and Gas Madrid
S.A., of which INH controls 87% directly and through Repsol.</p>
<p>A final decision concerning the size of the new utility's
Gas Madrid stake will depend on an audit to value the
Catalana shares to be transferred, Mr. Fanjul said.</p>
<p>Because the project involves the takeover of Catalana, the
new utility will also be obliged to offer minority Catalana
shareholders a chance to exchange their shares for shares in
the new firm. The number of shares to be floated publicly
will depend on the shareholders' response to this offer, Mr.
Fanjul said.</p>
<p>Analysts said the operation could present an attractive
opportunity for investors to gain access to a new Spanish gas
utility on the model of British Gas or Gaz de France.</p>
<p>But they said the success of the operation is likely to
depend on the terms offered to Catalana shareholders, many of
whom traditionally have shown strong loyalty to the company.</p>
<p>An additional uncertainty is the attitude of British Gas,
which recently acquired 10% of Catalana and which hasn't
shown any interest at this stage in joining the Repsol-La
Caixa project.</p>
