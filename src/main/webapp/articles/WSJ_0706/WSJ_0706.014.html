	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Pfizer Inc. said it agreed to sell its citric
acid business before the end of the year to
Archer-Daniels-Midland Co., a Decatur, Ill., processor of
soybean, wheat and corn products, including ethanol fuel.
   A spokesman for Pfizer, a health care and pharmaceuticals
concern, said it was too soon to discuss terms of the
transaction. Pfizer said the sale is expected to generate a
gain.</p>

$180 million in 1989 and employs 700 people. Citric acid
products are used in foods and beverages and as a replacement
for phosphates in laundry detergents.</p>
