	<p class="article-leader">ROCKFORD, Ill. -- Sundstrand Corp. said it will
"accelerate" the financial reporting of its Brazilian
operation, wrapping five months' results from the financially
pressed unit into the second quarter.
   Like those of many other companies, Sundstrand's operation
in Brazil has been hit hard by effects of a stringent
government-imposed anti-inflation plan.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The company's accounting move will consolidate the bulk of
the worst fiscal news from Brazil into one quarter, and may
also lessen misgivings investors have shown toward Sundstrand
stock because of the company's Brazilian exposure.</p>
<p>In April, the maker of aerospace and industrial equipment
said second-quarter earnings would be reduced by $2 million
to $3 million as a result of its problems in Brazil. But
yesterday, the company announced that it expects losses at
the Brazilian unit will lower overall net by about $7
million.</p>
<p>In the year-ago second period, Sundstrand's net-boosted by
a $10.3 million gain from sale of a division -- was $37.9
million, or 94 cents a share, on sales of $394.3 million.</p>
<p>Sundstrand has historically consolidated the results from
Sundstrand do Brazil on a three-month lag basis, with the
earnings from the quarter ended in December appearing, for
example, in the parent's firstquarter earnings.</p>
<p>"Given the current economic situation in Brazil,"
Sundstrand said it would be "more informative to its
shareholders if (the company) reduces this financial
reporting lag to one month."</p>
<p>Brazil's wrenching economic program is pinching a host of
U.S. companies who operate there: Last month, the stock of
Caterpillar Inc. went into a tailspin from which it hasn't
yet recovered, after the heavy-equipment maker disclosed
bigger-than-anticipated problems in the region. Other
companies feeling earnings pressure from Brazil include
Allied-Signal Inc., Armco Inc. and Whirlpool Corp.</p>
