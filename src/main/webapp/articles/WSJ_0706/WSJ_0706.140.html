	<p class="article-leader">Reports on productivity are sending a worrisome message
about the U.S. economy.
   Productivity, widely regarded as the truest reflection of
underlying economic vigor, has risen only slightly over the
past year and actually fell in the early months of 1990. And
many economists foresee very slow gains, at best, in coming
months.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The lackluster performance, many analysts say, reflects in
part the steadily growing role of services. Service
businesses now account for about 77% of all U.S. private
nonfarm jobs, which include jobs in manufacturing, mining and
construction. This figure is up from 70% in the mid-1970s and
60% in the early 1960s.</p>
<p>But the service sector accounts for only some 47% of the
economy's total output. Service-sector jobs generally don't
lend themselves as readily to productivity gains as jobs in
manufacturing, whose share of total employment has fallen to
about 17% from more than 30% in the early 1960s.</p>
<p>In the first quarter, overall productivity in nonfarm
businesses fell at an annual rate of 2.7%, according to U.S.
data. This decline was the steepest drop since early in the
1981-82 recession, and it occurred even though productivity
in manufacturing rose at an annual rate of 4.9% in the
quarter; sharply falling productivity in service businesses
wiped out the gain.</p>
<p>Some economists, it should be noted, maintain that the
productivity picture is less bleak than it seems, because
productivity is difficult to measure in service businesses
and may be understated in the official Labor Department
figures.</p>
<p>Gerald Faulhaber, a professor at the University of
Pennsylvania's Wharton School of Business, thinks the
"government may be missing gains in service productivity." As
an example, he cites the work of secretaries, who "with the
spread of word processors are doing a higher level of work,"
which isn't given enough weight.</p>
<p>Maury Harris, a PaineWebber Inc. economist in New York,
believes the Labor Department may not be taking into
full-enough consideration improved quality in the service
sector. He notes that capital spending has risen fastest in
service businesses recently and wonders how such spending can
continue "at a swift pace" without corresponding productivity
gains.</p>
<p>Edwin R. Dean, associate commissioner of labor statistics
concedes that "there's some reason to think that we may be
understating service productivity." He adds that "we don't
necessarily take account of all quality changes. No one
really knows."</p>
<p>In any event, there's little question that productivity
gains generally are more difficult to achieve in service
businesses. "Part of the problem in services is that new
people entering the labor force -- often those with the least
skill -- tend to go into service jobs," says Uday S.
Karmarkar, a professor at the University of Rochester's Simon
Business School.</p>
<p>Another large factor in the productivity slowdown, many
analysts say, is the length of the current business
expansion.</p>
<p>"Productivity typically shows the sharpest gains in the
early stages of an economic expansion and the narrowest gains
in the late stages," says Geoffrey H. Moore, director of
Columbia University's Center for International Business Cycle
Research. The current expansion, he notes, is 7 1/2 years
old, which is more than twice the average for earlier
expansions.</p>
<p>"Given this expansion's very old age, it's hardly
surprising that productivity has slowed," Mr. Moore says.</p>
<p>The pattern of slowing productivity reflects in part a
diminished supply of untapped labor after many recession-free
years. The labor pool -- in terms of the percentage of the
working-age population not at work -- has declined
persistently since the most recent recession, hitting record
lows in recent months. May's figures were 36.7%, within a
whisker of March's record of 36.6%. A further drag on
productivity has been earlier retirement among a relatively
productive group: males who are 45 to 54 years old.</p>
<p>A slowdown in productivity, and then an actual decline,
occurred for example in the latter stages of the long 1975-80
expansion. Productivity gains narrowed from 3% in 1976, to
1.8% in 1977, and to 0.9% in 1978. And then, in the upturn's
final year, the gains disappeared. In the final quarter of
1979, the last of the expansion, productivity fell at an
annual rate of 2.2%.</p>
<p>If a recession should develop in coming weeks, as some
economists predict, history shows the recent decline in
productivity could well be followed by further sharp drops.
Productivity fell at an annual rate of 2.6% in the 1980
second quarter, the low point of that year's recession, and
output dropped at annual rate of 5.8% in the early months of
the 1981-82 recession, which preceded the current expansion.</p>
<p>More likely than a recession, in the view of many
forecasters, is that as the year winds down the economy will
continue to expand sluggishly and productivity will follow
suit. The anticipated gains will fail to match hourly pay
increases, and so profits will remain under pressure as labor
costs climb.</p>
<p>Already on the increase, labor costs per unit of output
rose 4.5% last year, up from 2.7% in 1988 and 2.6% in 1987.
The 1989 rise was the sharpest gain since 1982, a recession
year.</p>
<p>Some economists note that productivity gains have also
narrowed abroad in recent years, for much the same reasons as
in the U.S. However, the record abroad is generally superior
to the U.S. performance.</p>
<p>A Richmond Federal Reserve Bank study shows that in a
recent seven-year interval the productivity of U.S.
businesses rose only 0.6% annually, compared with gains of
2.8% in Japan, 2.4% in France, 2% in West Germany and 1.9% in
Britain. The report also shows that the rate of private fixed
investment in the U.S., at about 15% of gross national
product, has persistently trailed comparable rates abroad.
For example, the rate in Japan has ranged near 25% and in
West Germany around 20%.</p>
<p>Kurt Richebacher, an economic consultant based in Zurich,
blames America's "retarded productivity growth" largely on
"the abysmal performance of U.S. savings and investment
during the 1980s." Investment, he adds, "is the wellspring of
productivity growth."</p>
<p>For all the dark spots, it should be added that the U.S.
productivity picture is not without a few bright ones. While
productivity growth has lagged behind in the U.S., in
absolute terms U.S. productivity remains at the top in global
rankings.</p>
<p>On a per-employee basis, for example, economic output in
Japan in 1989 came to only 72.7% of the U.S. level, according
to Labor Department data. Other comparable rates were 82% in
West Germany, 85.9% in France, 39.8% in South Korea, 87.3% in
Italy, 71.5% in Britain, 77.2% in the Netherlands, 67.7% in
Sweden, and 94% in Canada.</p>
<p>In addition, there are increasing signs that individual
U.S. companies -- in services as well as in manufacturing --
are finding new ways to spur productivity.</p>
<p>In the Webster, N.Y., plant of Xerox Corp., for example,
robots long used to paint copiers recently were assigned such
relatively sophisticated tasks as welding.</p>
<p>And American Express Co. recently increased productivity
of its personnel through faster settlement of billing
disputes. For instance, when a credit-card holder in Florida
with a good credit record ordered a ring from a Chicago
jeweler, the ring arrived with a stone missing.</p>
<p>"Under our old rules, there would have been exchanges of
letters taking weeks," says Roger H. Ballou, president of the
firm's travel-services group. "But not now -- we got busy
with fax and phone messages and in three days the client had
the ring fixed and back."</p>
