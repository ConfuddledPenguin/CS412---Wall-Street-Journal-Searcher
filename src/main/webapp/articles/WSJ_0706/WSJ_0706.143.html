	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- The unlikely trio of farm subsidies, Soviet
aid and global warming threatens to spoil President Bush's
get-together in Houston next week with leaders of his six
Western allies.
   The economic summit will pit the U.S. against the European
countries on each of these major issues. For Mr. Bush, the
host of the summit, it will be difficult to emerge unbruised.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>On agriculture, the U.S. wants to use the summit to push
for an agreement with its allies to eliminate most farm
subsidies, an issue it feels is crucial to breaking the
deadlock in the current round of international trade talks.
But on that score, it faces heavy resistance from France,
Italy, West Germany and Britain.</p>
<p>On Soviet aid, it's the West Germans and the French who
are eager to use the summit to push for immediate action. The
U.S. urges waiting for more Soviet commitment to
market-oriented economic reform before shelling out money
that the U.S. fears would be wasted.</p>
<p>And on the environment, the Europeans, led by the West
Germans, want to agree on steps to cut back "greenhouse"
gases, which many scientists fear will raise the Earth's
temperature by trapping too much heat from the sun and cause
possibly dramatic climate changes. The most troubling
greenhouse gases are the result of burning fossil fuels like
coal and oil, and steps to curb these emissions would have
big economic impacts. But the Bush administration isn't
convinced by the European arguments and stresses the need for
more research as well as proven environmental measures like
energy conservation and tree-planting.</p>
<p>The likely outcome: a summit of heavy quarreling and hard
bargaining between the U.S. and Europe on issues that are
crucial to the future world order. The two other summit
countries -- Canada and Japan -- generally lean toward the
U.S. position on the major issues, with Canada being
particularly supportive on the need for far-reaching
agricultural reform.</p>
<p>Yet, however bad the tiffs between the summit countries on
these major issues, it's likely they'll all sign off on a
final communique that carefully papers over their differences
on these and other subjects.</p>
<p>"Any summit is a snapshot of international negotiations in
the economic and political world in that year, and this year
there are three or four processes that are in a critical
stage," Richard McCormack, undersecretary for economic and
agricultural affairs at the State Department, said in an
interview. Progress on these issues at this summit will
require tough talking between the leaders themselves.</p>
<p>"This isn't a technicians' summit, but a summit of
political leaders" said Mr. McCormack, who is President
Bush's sherpa -- as guides to Himalayan summits are known --
for the second year.</p>
<p>The Houston summit will be a sharp contrast to last year's
celebration in Paris, which coincided with the bicentenary of
the French Revolution, when the leaders had so little left to
discuss that they even canceled their final dinner and went
their separate ways half a day early.</p>
<p>The agriculture issue is particularly important because
lack of agreement threatens to undermine the current Uruguay
Round of talks under the world's trade treaty, the General
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. Those talks, begun in 1986 in
Punta del Este in Uruguay, aim to rewrite the world's trade
rules, extending them to cover practically all of the globe's
commerce. They are scheduled to conclude in December in
Brussels.</p>
<p>The U.S. is adamant about the need for reform in
agriculture. "Trying to get agreement on going forward
fruitfully on the Uruguay Round would be very important to me
and all of us here," President Bush told reporters recently,
"and I'd put that at the top" of the Houston agenda, he
added.</p>
<p>Earlier this week, U.S. Trade Representative Carla Hills
said the U.S. most wants "a recognition by European
participants that agriculture is key to the round." She also
noted that the spat over agriculture pits the European
Community against practically all the world's other
food-exporting nations.</p>
<p>Without progress on agricultural reform, the U.S. fears
that many developing countries will desert the GATT talks and
that there will be a breakdown of the freetrading system
leading to "more unilateralism, and a couple of years of real
excitement" before negotiations could begin anew, Mr.
McCormack said.</p>
<p>But the Europeans remain leery of any reforms in
agriculture that will cut into their $9 billion a year of
export subsidies, or into the billions of dollars they spend
on price supports. The former are particularly helpful to the
big exports of France's relatively efficient farmers, while
the latter help to protect West Germany's relatively
inefficient agriculture.</p>
<p>A senior European Commission official told reporters
yesterday that the Europeans wouldn't bring to Houston new
initiatives on farm subsidies but would continue to push for
a recognition that "our agricultural systems are different."
He said EC President Jacques Delors would seek to impress on
President Bush that the EC can't eliminate its subsidies as
the U.S. would like it to.</p>
<p>The crumbling Soviet economy also is dividing the allies.
West Germany, eager for Soviet endorsement of its planned
union with East Germany, recently lent Moscow five billion
marks ($3.03 billion), and is canvassing for more Western
aid. France also is keen to help the Soviets. But the U.S.,
Canada, Japan and Britain remain opposed. "None of our
bilateral issues are solved," says a Japanese government
official discussing his country's relations with the Soviet
Union.</p>
<p>Moreover, the European Community itself hasn't yet put
together a Soviet-aid plan. At its recent summit in Dublin,
the EC agreed to study the issue and come up with a proposal
by October.</p>
<p>The U.S. and the Europeans, along with other developed
nations, already are moving together to deal with one
world-wide environmental problem: the depletion of the
Earth's protective ozone layer, which shields out the sun's
harmful ultraviolet rays.</p>
<p>But greenhouse gases and threats of global warming pose a
stickier issue that still is likely to cloud the summit
atmosphere. The U.S. is spending massive amounts of money on
researching the global-warming issue and wants to wait until
it gets what it considers conclusive results.</p>
<p>On all three key issues -- agricultural trade, Soviet aid
and the environment -- West Germany, Europe's emerging
superpower, is unlikely to want to offend Mr. Bush. "You
shouldn't forget that German unification is Chancellor Kohl's
top priority, and we have been very supportive of him," says
a senior U.S. administration official, discussing the Houston
summit.</p>
<p>And Mr. Bush himself appreciates the variety of opinions
in the group. "Nobody says we've got to move in lockstep on
all of this," he told reporters recently. "I have great
respect for Kohl, and great respect for Mrs. Thatcher's
approach, and Mitterrand's approach, all of them. I think
there are nuances of difference there. But that doesn't
weaken the prospects for the economic summit. Those aren't
dividing issues that are going to render us asunder from the
Brits, or the French, or the Canadians, who look at some of
these issues a little differently."</p>
