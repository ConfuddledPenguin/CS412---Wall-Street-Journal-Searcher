	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Standard & Poor's Corp. cut ratings on the
debt of three Finnish banks, reflecting an increasingly
deregulated and competitive operating environment.
   The three banks "have some common problems," each with its
own particular difficulties, "but it all comes out of the
deregulated and competitive market," said Virginia L. Manzer,
an analyst at S&P.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The credit-rating company cut the senior unsecured debt of
Kansallis-Osake-Pankki to double-A-minus from double-A. The
bank's subordinated debt falls to single-A-plus from
double-A-minus. A total of $3 billion of securities are
affected.</p>
<p>S&P cut Union Bank of Finland Ltd.'s $1.6 billion of
senior unsecured debt to double-A-minus from double-A. And
Postipankki Ltd.'s $415 million of senior unsecured
obligations dated Jan. 1, 1988, and later fell to
double-A-plus from triple-A.</p>
