	<p class="article-leader">The Securities and Exchange Commission, in an unusual move
against a major accounting firm, is seeking a permanent
injunction barring Price Waterhouse from violating securities
law.
   In a trial that began yesterday in federal court in New
York, the SEC said the injunction is necessary to ensure that
the accounting firm doesn't commit securities fraud in
connection with audits it does for clients. SEC attorneys
said the case is one of the first in which the agency has
sought such a court order against a major accounting firm.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>If an injunction is issued, the firm could be held in
contempt of court and would face additional penalties if it
were ever found guilty of violating the securities law. The
injunction would also be a black eye for the firm, because
the SEC claims that Price Waterhouse is likely to break the
law unless the injunction is ordered.</p>
<p>The charges stem from work that Price Waterhouse did in
1980 for AM International Inc., a Chicago-based maker of
business graphics equipment. In 1985, the SEC filed a civil
suit accusing Price Waterhouse and three of its partners of
violating securities laws by approving AM's fiscal 1980
financial statements. The SEC claims that the firm and its
partners should have disclosed in their auditing report that
AM was using improper and possibly inaccurate accounting
methods.</p>
<p>"Where an entry says `black,' they'll have you believe it
means `white,'" said Kevin O'Rourke, an SEC attorney, in his
opening arguments. The non-jury trial is being heard by U.S.
District Judge John E. Sprizzo.</p>
<p>Mr. O'Rourke said Price Waterhouse had altered documents
to cover up the alleged misconduct.</p>
<p>David R. Jewell, an attorney for Price Waterhouse and the
three partners also named in the suit, said the firm had
taken proper accounting steps in dealing with AM
International.</p>
<p>"As to the individual defendants and as to the firm, the
evidence will simply not support the SEC's allegations," Mr.
Jewell said in his opening statements to the judge. He said
that any alterations that were made in the firm's reports
were done following standard review procedures.</p>
<p>The three individual defendants in the case are Daniel
Jerbasi, a partner who currently does auditing work; Benjamin
Perks, a partner in the firm's Chicago office who now works
with the firm's litigation support group; and Michael LeRoy,
a former partner who has since left the firm and no longer
works as an accountant. The SEC is also seeking an injunction
against the three individuals.</p>
<p>The SEC could face a tough task in convincing Judge
Sprizzo that a general injunction against the firm is
required. He said he will issue the injunction only if it is
proved that the firm itself was derelict in training or
controlling its partners.</p>
<p>"You have to persuade me that just because they were bad
boys in the past, they will be bad boys in the future," the
judge said.</p>

<p>LAWYERS CAN INFORMALLY interview employees of firms they
sue, court rules.</p>
<p>New York's highest court ruled that lawyers litigating
against a corporation can informally interview certain
employees without the consent of the corporation's lawyers.</p>
<p>Reversing most of a lower court ruling, the New York Court
of Appeals said it isn't necessary "to shield all employees
from informal interviews in order to safeguard the
corporation's interest." Instead, the court said, an opposing
lawyer can talk informally with employees who aren't
responsible for making decisions that may affect the case.</p>
<p>The case involves a construction worker, Thomas Niesig,
who alleges he was injured when he fell from a scaffolding at
a building construction site. He filed a complaint against
J.M. Frederick Construction of New York Inc., Plainview,
N.Y., the project's general contractor, which brought in Mr.
Niesig's employer, DeTrae Enterprises Inc., as a defendant.
Mr. Niesig's lawyer then requested informal interviews with
DeTrae employees who were on the site when the accident
allegedly occurred.</p>
<p>"What the court below had in effect done is turn our
adversary system of justice into a one-sided system of
justice, saying that corporate counsel could have access to
facts and witnesses but that outside attorneys and anyone
suing a corporation could not have access," said Emily Bass,
Mr. Niesig's lawyer.</p>
<p>But Frederick Simpson, who represented J.M. Frederick in
the appeal, warned that the court's decision will pose an
ethical dilemma for a lawyer because "he's not going to know
until he's into this informal discussion whether these people
are within the class of corporate employees that can be
spoken to." Lawyers for DeTrae couldn't be reached for
comment.</p>
<p>The NAACP Legal Defense and Education Fund, the Legal Aid
Society, the National Organization for Women and the New York
Attorney General's Office are among the groups that filed
friend-of-the-court briefs on behalf of Mr. Niesig.</p>

<p>STRANGE BEDFELLOWS unite in an appeal to the high court.</p>
<p>The consumer-oriented Public Citizen Litigation Group
filed a brief urging the Supreme Court to hear an appeal by
Colorado Interstate Gas Co., a Coastal Corp. unit. Included
among Colorado Interstate's high-powered battery of lawyers
is former judge Robert Bork, whose nomination to the Supreme
Court was opposed by Public Citizen in 1987.</p>
<p>The consumer group is an unlikely ally for Colorado
Interstate's other lawyers as well. Lead counsel in the case
is Rex Lee, the former solicitor general who frequently
represents business interests in top court appeals, and
William Baxter, the Stanford Law School professor and former
Justice Department antitrust chief.</p>
<p>The appeal challenges the ruling last September of a
federal appeals court in Denver. The appeals court threw out
most of a $412.3 million damages award that Colorado
Interstate won in a lawsuit against Natural Gas Pipeline
Company of America, a MidCon Corp. unit. A federal district
court found that Natural Gas Pipeline breached a contract
with Colorado Interstate and attempted to monopolize gas
sales in violation of U.S. antitrust law.</p>
<p>Among other points, the appeals court decided that a
Federal Energy Regulatory Commission order implicitly
pre-empted the breach of contract claim by Colorado
Interstate. Public Citizen's brief argues that if federal
agency orders are going to pre-empt state laws, it ought to
be done expressly -- not implicitly -- in a federal law or in
an agency ruling.</p>
<p>The top court is expected to decide in October whether to
hear the case.</p>

<p>MINPECO S.A., the Peruvian minerals company that won a
$134 million judgment in the silver conspiracy trial of 1988,
filed a suit yesterday against Brazilian investor Naji Robert
Nahas, one of the defendants, to enforce the judgment. The
suit, filed in the Supreme Court of Brazil, in Brasilia,
seeks the total amount of the jury award plus $105 million in
attorneys fees and interest. Two years ago, a jury in New
York federal court decided that Mr. Nahas, a resident of Sao
Paulo, and the Hunt brothers of Dallas, among others, had
conspired to manipulate world silver prices in 1979 and 1980.
So far, Minpeco has collected $92 million on the judgment.</p>

<p>MUDGE ROSE MERGES with New Jersey law firm. The 290-lawyer
New York firm of Mudge Rose Guthrie Alexander & Ferdon has
merged with Edwards, Villoresi, Perrucci & Paulsen of
Parsippany, N.J., which has 20 lawyers. A spokesman for Mudge
Rose, which is known for its municipal bonds practice, said
the merged law firm plans to immediately add about 15
additional lawyers in New Jersey. Cary Edwards, who founded
Edwards Villoresi in March 1990, is a former New Jersey
attorney general and former Republican gubernatorial
candidate.</p>

Japanese clients with business in the U.S. It will be staffed

Seiden, both trade law specialists who have previously lived
in Japan.</p>
