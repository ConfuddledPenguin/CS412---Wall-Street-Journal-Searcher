	<p class="article-leader">The pharmaceutical industry, largely immune to the
sluggish earnings bug that has hit many sectors of the U.S.
economy, is expected to post a second-quarter earnings gain
of 14% to 16%.
   Profit at several major U.S. drug makers is estimated to
have climbed by between 18% and 20%, reflecting the strong
sales of premium-priced drugs, price increases and benefits
from a weakening dollar abroad.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Securities industry analysts said high-margin products
propelled hearty earnings at Eli Lilly & Co., Merck & Co.,
Schering Plough Corp., Warner-Lambert Co. and Bristol-Myers
Squibb Co. But earnings at Pfizer Inc. and Upjohn Co. were
estimated to have risen by about 10% or less.</p>
<p>"Profit growth looks particularly strong {in the industry}
when you compare it to performance elsewhere {in the
economy}," said Ronald Nordmann, a drug industry analyst with
PaineWebber Inc.</p>
<p>Mr. Nordmann said that while per-share earnings rose about
15% to 16% for the first half of 1990, he expected profit
growth to rise even more sharply for the rest of the year,
moving ahead by about 18% in the third quarter and 21% in the
fourth.</p>
<p>Analysts said Eli Lilly's quarterly profit would jump the
greatest, increasing about 25% from the $217.1 million, or 75
cents a share, reported in the second quarter of 1989. Growth
was spurred by explosive sales of the anti-depressant drug,
Prozac.</p>
<p>Patricia Lea, an analyst at Vector Securities
International Inc., Deerfield, Ill., said Prozac sales, far
from prosaic, rose during the quarter at an annual rate of
$700 million to $800 million, up from the $320 million it
registered in 1989. The drug has received a boost from a host
of news stories citing it as relatively safe, with fewer
annoying side effects than other anti-depressant medicines.</p>
<p>Eli Lilly's growth also was due to strong sales of its
catheters, devices used to diagnose heart disease. In
Indianapolis, a spokesman said the company wouldn't comment.</p>
<p>Analysts believe Merck's earnings rose about 20% to 21%,
due to continued strong sales of several products, including
its cholesterol-lowering agent, Mevacor; Pepcid, an
anti-ulcer drug; and Vasotec, a heart disease drug. Merck,
with a large presence in Europe and Japan, previously had
been hurt by adverse foreign currency translations as a
result of a strong dollar. Analysts said such translations in
the second quarter won't hurt drug makers with overseas
business as the dollar's value has softened.</p>
<p>In the second quarter of 1989, Merck earned $396.6
million, or $1 a share. Merck, based in Rahway, N.J.,
declined to comment.</p>
<p>Bristol-Myers was expected to post a profit gain of about
20% from the $345 million, or 66 cents a share, it reported
in the 1989 second quarter. Analysts said the company was
helped by the combination of sales forces resulting from the
merger between Bristol-Myers and Squibb last year.</p>
<p>In particular, sales of Bristol-Myers' drug Capoten, which
competes against Merck's Vasotec, benefited from the
additional marketing clout. The company's antibiotic Duracef
gained sales when a court banned the sale of generic
competitor following a lawsuit over the drug's patent.</p>
<p>"Bristol-Myers also implemented some very aggressive price
hikes for some of its products," said Robert Uhl, an analyst
at Salomon Brothers who tracks drug price increases. He said
that during the quarter the company increased prices by 14%
for the company's Squibb line of drugs and 17% for its
Bristol Laboratories line. The New York company declined to
comment.</p>
<p>Analysts said profit for Warner-Lambert and
Schering-Plough was expected to jump about 18% to 20%.
Warner-Lambert profit was buttressed by sales of Lopid, a
anti-cholesterol drug, while Schering moved ahead on sales of
Proventil, an asthma medicine, and its broad line of other
prescription drugs.</p>
<p>In Morris Plains, N.J., Warner-Lambert, which earned
$112.4 million, or 83 cents a share accounting for a stock
split, in the year-earlier period, declined to comment.
Schering-Plough, in Madison, N.J., which earned $120.5
million, or 54 cents a share after a stock split, also
declined to comment.</p>
<p>Analysts said that profit for Pfizer and Upjohn are
estimated to have risen more slowly, growing by between 8%
and 10%. Analysts said the Pfizer earnings were damped by
marketing costs related to the sale of several new drugs, and
the analysts said the cost of several other product
introductions later this year also may slow earnings growth
for the rest of the year. New York-based Pfizer earned $135.7
million, or 80 cents a share. It declined to comment.</p>
<p>Upjohn, which earned $94.6 million, or 51 cents a share,
in the 1989 second quarter, continued to suffer from slowing
sales of its leading drug products, Xanax and Halcion,
analysts said. Even so, earnings benefited from a pretax gain
of $35 million to $40 million from a pension settlement. In
Kalamazoo, Mich., the company declined to comment.</p>
