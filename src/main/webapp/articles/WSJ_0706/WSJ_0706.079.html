	<p class="article-leader">Ralph Nader has just returned from a look at the new
Soviet man and is more than a bit discomfited at the shape of
things to come. While he did establish links with a new
consumer federation there, the latest Village Voice reports
he was "bewildered" by the fascination with free-market
ideology he found. "It's creeping anarchy," he told the
Voice. "Here is a system that was once ruled in an iron
grasp, and it's just falling out of control. . . . They're
swinging from Marx to Milton Friedman. They are the world's
experts on bureaucracy and the state. But they don't know
anything about what the market is going to do to them."
   Perhaps not, but it's our impression that the Soviet
citizenry has a crystal-clear view of what the public
bureaucracy has done to them. We called Mr. Nader for
amplification, and he outlined his nightmare of what a future
Soviet Union may look like.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>A drive toward capitalism "means they will jump from the
frying pan into the fire. They are in danger of joining the
Third World and becoming an imitative economy and an
imitative culture borrowing everything from the West. They
are going from criticizing all that's Western to being
sycophantic about everything Western."</p>
<p>Mr. Nader says many Soviets are only too willing to "sell
out" and become tools of multinationals poised to flood the
Soviet Union with useless products. "They don't need
Coca-Cola," he says. "They need nutritious fruit juices." He
warns that the Soviet Union is about to become a dumping
ground for the worst aspects of Western culture and
commercialism.</p>
<p>Some of his Soviet hosts seem to have taken Naderism with
a grain of salt. Mr. Nader told Leningrad's Mayor Anatoli
Sobchak, an ardent free-market advocate, that democracy can
be perverted by powerful private interests. The Voice reports
that Mr. Sobchak gently told Mr. Nader that "our problems are
at a different level" and that "the key task is to wean power
away from the state and invest it in society. We must worry
about private power, but the immediate task is reducing the
power of the state over the economy."</p>
<p>Mr. Nader was also startled when told by Moscow's reform
leaders that they wanted to create independent television
networks with foreign help. "I told them that even capitalist
America doesn't allow foreign ownership of television
properties," he says. "If they do that Western companies will
simply flood them with mindless American-style
entertainment."</p>
<p>That's a thought worth pondering. Dumping segments of
"L.A. Law" on the Soviet Union might turn the whole reform
movement away from the U.S. system. Still, Sergei
Stankevitch, Moscow's deputy mayor, reminded him it was
impossible for them to create new networks without foreign
investment. "Why not try to combine leisure entertainment and
serious problems?" he asked Mr. Nader.</p>
<p>Mr. Nader says he is still hopeful the Soviets can be
rescued from a headlong rush into the free market. He hopes a
nationwide consumer movement will act as a braking mechanism.
One possibility, we suppose, would be to rehabilitate former
KGB officials as Nader's Raiders or the Soviet Public
Interest Research Group.</p>
<p>Of course, if Mr. Nader really wants to slow the pace of
change, he could just parachute in a few hundred U.S.
trial-lawyer friends. Once the American plaintiffs' attorneys
started suing the socks off the fledgling private sector,
that would guarantee that the Soviet Union would remain
uncorrupted by Western capitalism.</p>
