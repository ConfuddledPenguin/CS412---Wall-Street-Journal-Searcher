	<p class="article-leader">HOLLYWOOD -- Judging by early box office returns from the
July Fourth holiday, News Corp.'s Twentieth Century Fox film
"Die Hard 2: Die Harder" looks like it has a chance this
coming weekend to produce the top-grossing opening week of
any summer movie.
   On 2,378 screens Wednesday -- a day when fireworks
displays and holiday barbecues competed for audiences -- the
film grossed $5.9 million. In Tuesday night special
screenings on 1,800 screens across the country -- with some
theaters featuring one show, others two -- the movie grossed
$3,692,833; these totals, however, won't be included in the
five-day "weekend gross" figures released Monday.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>These figures could make "Die Harder" competitive with the
top opener of the summer so far, Carolco Pictures Inc.'s
"Total Recall," which grossed more than $35 million in its
first week.</p>
<p>"Die Harder," co-produced by action-movie mogul Joel
Silver, is estimated to have cost a whopping $62 million just
to make, plus an additional $30 million to market and place
into theaters. The original "Die Hard," also starring Bruce
Willis, grossed $85 million in 1988.</p>
<p>Putting this sequel into production was one of the first
official acts by new Fox film Chairman Joe Roth when he
assumed his current post less than a year ago. The studio has
lagged behind most other major studios in the past few movie
seasons.</p>
