	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- With people back from summer recess, the
question on nearly every investor's mind is the one posed by
stock market strategist Abby Joseph Cohen: "How low can it
go?"
   Her answer is of more than passing interest. Ms. Cohen,
the strategist at Barclays de Zoete Wedd, was bearish well
before Saddam Hussein sent stocks into a tailspin.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>She was cold to the market while it rallied last year. She
was bearish after the Dow Jones Industrial Average soared
late this spring. And she is bearish now -- perhaps bearish
enough to make investors wish their vacations could last a
little longer.</p>
<p>To quote from Ms. Cohen's most recent report: "The sharp
decline in equity prices has not significantly improved the
valuation of equities, since much of the decline has been
offset by the rise in interest rates."</p>
<p>Moreover, she says, judging by the level of long-term
rates now and Wall Street's consensus projection for
corporate earnings, "U.S. equities are still some 15% above a
theoretical buy price."</p>
<p>Ms. Cohen, herself just back from the New Hampshire
mountains, makes no pretense of calling the bottom. She says,
"The bottom for the market is a moving target."</p>
<p>But it requires little insight to guess the direction in
which she believes things are headed. As interest rates since
Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait have risen, and as the
economy has seemed to falter, she has set her sights lower.</p>
<p>"The bottom in equity prices cannot be gauged," she
writes, "until . . . economic fundamentals have shown some
sign of stabilization. We're not there yet."</p>
<p>Ms. Cohen's opinion is noteworthy not only because she has
recently been right, but because of how she arrives at it.
Ms. Cohen, a refugee from the defunct Drexel Burnham Lambert,
pays attention to bread-and-butter fundamentals -- she
watches current and projected levels of corporate earnings
and long-term interest rates.</p>
<p>She was unmoved by peace, perestroika, European unity and
other themes and supposed market panaceas. She is, on the
other hand, very much interested in projected corporate
profits.</p>
<p>This year, she thinks that the Standard & Poor's 500 will
post average earnings of $22 a share, almost even with 1989
-- and little changed from her own Jan. 1 projection of
$22.50 a share.</p>
<p>Wall Street market strategists as a group began the year
on a far more bullish note, projecting $26 a share, according
to Institutional Brokers Estimate System, a service of Lynch,
Jones & Ryan. But since then, the crowd's optimism has
steadily eroded. The latest consensus estimate for 1990 is
$23.99 a share.</p>
<p>Although estimates have fallen, Ms. Cohen argues that they
are still too high. And most strategists continue to stick
with bullish earnings estimates for 1991 -- the Institutional
Brokers Estimate consensus for next year is $25.43 a share,
compared with Ms. Cohen's $21.</p>
<p>Thus, she argues, one shoe has yet to drop. While
investors in recent weeks have become unwilling to pay high
multiples for earnings, they haven't sufficiently readjusted
earnings estimates.</p>
<p>"The consensus economic forecast does not incorporate a
recession, nor a flattening (let alone a decline) in
corporate profits," Ms. Cohen says. "We think the downward
adjustment process will accelerate over the next several
weeks, especially for 1991 estimates."</p>
<p>What, then, is a "fair" level for stocks? Ms. Cohen
doesn't know and doesn't much care. Brokers sell stocks when
their clients believe the stocks are cheap, not when the
price is "fair."</p>
<p>Ms. Cohen defines stocks as being cheap -- or at her
"theoretical buy price" -- when they are low enough to
provide an expected annual return of four percentage points
above prevailing bond rates. In other words, investors should
seek a premium, or a margin of safety, in return for risking
money on stocks.</p>
<p>Based on the current level of rates, and on Wall Street's
current earnings forecast, Ms. Cohen says the S&P 500-stock
index won't be attractive until it reaches about 270 to 280,
considerably below its close yesterday of 324.39, up 1.30.</p>
<p>Ms. Cohen's earnings forecast, she says, "is basically a
call on the economy," where, she says, "I think conditions
are deteriorating."</p>
<p>Economic growth, she says, was tepid at best before the
Iraqi invasion, and stock prices -- based on consensus
earnings estimates -- had reached "substantially overvalued
levels."</p>
<p>The invasion, she says, may boost profits of a few
companies -- notably those in the oil patch. But in general,
she says the invasion and the resultant oil-price rise are
likely to slow down an economy that was in no need of brakes.
Corporate profits in particular, she says, are likely to
weaken in cyclical industries such as manufacturing, in
retailing and in other areas.</p>
<p>"The growth rate peaked in early 1988," Ms. Cohen says.
"Even without a recession, I don't see any reacceleration
soon. The confidence of consumers and of business
decision-makers has been shaken."</p>
<p>One bullish factor: If the economy and corporate profits
do weaken, she says, interest rates could well drop back,
reflecting less demand from borrowers. And another bullish
note: She says the dollar's decline will boost the overseas
earnings of multinationals.</p>
<p>But in general, Ms. Cohen says, "There is very little
stimulus out there." Though the Federal Reserve's monetary
policy could become stimulative, she says, it hasn't yet
become so, and the Fed can't do much to loosen credit while
foreign central banks are tightening.</p>
<p>What's more, U.S. banks have become less willing -- or
less able -- to lend, and Japanese money supply growth is in
a bind. The Japanese central bank is tightening, and Japanese
banks -- their assets hurt by the plunge in Japanese stocks
-- are under increasing pressure to cut back lending, she
says.</p>
<p>Ms. Cohen's conclusion: To believe that stock prices are
attractive, one has to believe that interest rates will fall
by at least one percentage point and that consensus earnings
estimates are correct. She says that's believing too much.</p>
