	<p class="article-leader">LONDON -- The London-based Kuwait Investment Office has
opened a multibillion-dollar credit window for Kuwaiti banks,
offering short-term credit to help financial institutions
meet as much as $7 billion in unsettled claims.
   The move, disclosed by Kuwaiti Central Bank Governor Sheik
Salem Abdul-Aziz al-Sabah in an interview, marks the first
indication of concrete steps Kuwait is taking to rehabilitate
the financial credibility of its $100 billion overseas
economy. Sheik Salem said the nation's banking system has
suffered a major "liquidity squeeze" in the wake of the Aug.
2 Iraqi invasion and a subsequent world-wide asset freeze.
Such moves have halted billions of dollars in international
financial transactions among Kuwaiti, U.S., European and
Japanese banks.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Sheik Salem said Kuwait's main economic objective now is
to restore international credibility to the Kuwaiti financial
system by meeting international obligations.</p>
<p>Kuwait, thanks to its oil wealth, is a creditor in the
world economy, but the Iraqi invasion and swift asset freeze
blocked accounts, cut credit lines and locked Kuwait into
billions of dollars of short-term liabilities that need to be
unscrambled. "Our priority is to get our banks to meet their
interbank and foreign-exchange obligations," said Sheik
Salem. "We must meet out debts so our counterparties don't
suffer."</p>
<p>Sheik Salem is among the principal figures behind efforts
to organize a Kuwaiti economy-in-exile in the wake of the
Iraqi invasion. In addition to heading the central bank, he
also sits on the board of the Kuwait Investment Office, the
London-based agency that manages the bulk of Kuwait's
overseas assets. These holdings include plantations in
Malaysia, office buildings in Texas and major strategic
shareholdings in such blue-chip companies as Daimler-Benz AG
and British Petroleum Co.</p>
<p>Sheik Salem said the Iraqi invasion hasn't prompted
changes in investment strategy or operations at the
investment office. In particular, he rejected traders'
speculation that the office intends to reduce its big
investments in Western markets. "We are still a long-term
investor," he said. "We think there are a lot of good
opportunities in all markets -- including the U.S."</p>
<p>His comments came only hours after Kuwait's Prime
Minister, Crown Prince Sheik Saad al-Abdallah al-Salem
al-Sabah, told a London news conference that his nation would
consider contributing financially to multinational military
efforts in the Persian Gulf. He also vowed to continue the
fight against Iraq. "We will fight, we will struggle and we
will fight again with all our friends and Arab brothers who
have rejected the Iraqi aggressors," he said.</p>
<p>In the interview, Sheik Salem shrugged and said, "I don't
know," when asked the total value of unsettled international
claims. (Kuwaiti banking sources estimate them at between $5
billion and $7 billion.) "Our biggest problem has been
information," said Sheik Salem. Many banking records have
been lost in Kuwait. Many Kuwaiti bankers -- outside the
country when the invasion occurred -- are regrouping in
London to try to reconstruct records. Sheik Salem said it may
take another three weeks before enough information is
available to unscramble the claims.</p>
<p>There are about a dozen financial institutions that could
tap the short-term credit -- ranging from the National Bank
of Kuwait, which has $14 billion in assets, to smaller, local
institutions. Kuwaiti bankers and officials in London say
only a fraction of the available Kuwait Investment Office
resources have been drawn down to meet claims.</p>
<p>Sheik Salem said that arranging the credit window didn't
require special British government approval. He said
international banking authorities, including the Bank of
England, are helping the Kuwaitis come up with ways of paying
their international debts -- in effect, signaling that the
investment office is being given a quite free hand to manage
Kuwaiti assets.</p>
<p>Big institutions such as the National Bank of Kuwait have
drawn only $100 million of the $300 million line available,
and have satisfied more than 80% of claims, according to
insiders. "We have not fixed a limit on {investment office}
assets" that could be tapped to meet remaining claims, Sheik
Salem said. "We will provide the necessary funds to meet any
mismatch" of trading positions.</p>
<p>The Kuwaitis are taking other steps to keep their
financial system ticking. Sheik Salem said eight of the
country's biggest banks have formed a Kuwait Banks
Association in London to serve as a clearinghouse for
information. The group includes the National Bank of Kuwait,
Commercial Bank of Kuwait, Gulf Bank, Alahli Bank of Kuwait,
Bank of Kuwait and the Middle East, Burgan Bank, Industrial
Bank of Kuwait and Kuwait Real Estate Bank.</p>
<p>The Kuwaiti authorities also are supporting bank efforts
to sell some assets to third parties to raise capital to meet
short-term claims.</p>
