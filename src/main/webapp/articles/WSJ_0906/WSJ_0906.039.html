	<p class="article-leader">The Federal Reserve more or less signals its monetary
policy by moving, or by not moving, the interest rate on
federal funds, the reserves that banks lend one another for
very short periods of time. Over the short term, the Fed can
strongly influence the funds rate by buying or selling
Treasury securities in the open market; these actions either
pump reserves into the banking system or pull them out.
   That sounds simple enough, but the operation has become a
bit complicated in the past several months. With the economy
obviously sluggish, the Fed has wanted to lean a little
toward ease when it can do so without worsening the
also-worrisome inflation outlook. This has encouraged market
participants to watch the central bank's market actions
anxiously for any sign of the occasional move toward monetary
ease.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>On the day before Thanksgiving last year, the funds rate
stood at about 8 3/8%, slightly below the 8 1/2% rate that
the markets thought was the Fed's current target. So what did
the central bank do? It injected more reserves into the
banking system, convincing the markets that it wanted a lower
funds rate -- and thus an easier monetary policy.</p>
<p>Well, it turned out that the Fed didn't want an easier
policy at all. On the day after Thanksgiving and on the
following Monday the central bank aggressively pulled out
reserves, pushing the funds rate back up to the desired 8
1/2%.</p>
<p>What happened? No one knows for sure. The market
assumption is that the Thanksgiving surprise stemmed from a
Fed misjudgment of the reserves the banking system wanted or
needed. In any case, the central bank has continued to use
the funds rate as its policy signal, with some unusual
results.</p>
<p>Presumably the Fed still wanted to give the economy a
friendly little nudge upward, when and if it could be done
without inflationary effects. Since Thanksgiving, in fact,
the funds rate has declined from 8 1/2% to 8%. To keep it
from falling faster, however, the Fed has had to pull
reserves out of the banking system. Since Thanksgiving, bank
reserves, the funds that make it possible for banks to make
loans to businesses and individuals, have actually declined.
So the central bank, which apparently thought it was moving
cautiously toward ease, was actually rather vigorously
tightening money.</p>
<p>Last month another Thanksgiving-type surprise seemed
possible, but the Fed avoided it. Whether its tactic was
desirable is at least a matter for debate.</p>
<p>A little explanation may be necessary. Banks hold reserve
balances with the Federal Reserve to meet their reserve
requirements -- on average over a two-week maintenance period
-- and to handle clearing of transactions among banks. Since
the Fed doesn't pay interest on these funds, the banks
naturally try to keep the reserve balances as low as
possible. They can borrow reserves from other banks through
the fed funds market and, in emergencies, they can borrow
directly from the Federal Reserve.</p>
<p>In the reserve-maintenance period from Aug. 8 to Aug. 22,
Consolidated Edison threw a monkey wrench into the banks'
careful planning: On Aug. 13 it had a massive power outage in
lower Manhattan. There were a lot of news stories about
executives trapped in elevators or sweltering without air
conditioning, but less was said about the fact that wire
transfers of funds among banks and the Fed were fouled up.</p>
<p>As Paul Kasriel, vice president and monetary economist at
Chicago's Northern Trust Co. recounts the period: "The real
rub came on the last day of the period, Aug. 22, when the
funds rate spiked to 60%. . . . Now we are talking money]"</p>
<p>Obviously, there was a large reserve deficiency on that
day. Some banks were allowed to borrow from the Fed at the
discount rate of 7%, but many had to pay much higher rates.
As Mr. Kasriel comments, the banks, with their earnings
already sagging, didn't need this.</p>
<p>The Federal Reserve could have supplied reserves to tide
the banks over what was a short-term problem. But if it had,
a lot of people in the markets and the media might have
concluded that the Fed, despite the Mideast mess, soaring oil
prices and market turmoil, was pushing ahead toward easier
money. The Thanksgiving surprise again. Heaven forbid.</p>
<p>So the Fed's mission was accomplished. Certainly, with the
funds rate spiking up to 60%, no one assumed the Federal
Reserve was hellbent to ease money. And surely no one thought
the Fed had simply decided to forget about economic growth
and launch all-out war on inflation. But there was a better
way.</p>
<p>"Wouldn't it be simpler and less costly to society for the
Fed to publicly announce its funds rate target every day?"
Mr. Kasriel asks. Indeed it would. Federal Reserve officials
react with horror at the idea, but I have yet to see what
damage it could do. Even the Fed, with the problems it has
had since last Thanksgiving, must be able to see that the
idea has some virtues.</p>
