	<p class="article-leader">B.A.T Industries PLC said first-half pretax profit sank
11% to #592 million ($1.1 billion) from #668 million a year
earlier.
   Per-share earnings dropped 20% to 20.5 pence from 25.5
pence.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Sales for the British tobacco and financial services
conglomerate rose 13% to #9.38 billion from #8.27 billion a
year earlier. The results reflect damage arising from a
protracted battle B.A.T mounted to deflect a takeover bid by
Sir James Goldsmith. The company wrote off #26 million in
costs for regulatory hearings and defense costs in the fight.</p>
<p>The battle hastened a restructuring at B.A.T that included
the disposal of the company's U.S. retailing operations.
These sales created #414 million in profits, which translated
into a further 10.7 pence-a-share interim dividend, upping
the total paid so far this year to 20.7 pence from 19.6 pence
a year earlier.</p>
<p>The biggest setback occurred in the Eagle Star insurance
business, which was hit by heavy payments from storms. Eagle,
which also extends property loan guarantees, had to raise its
reserves #40 million.</p>
