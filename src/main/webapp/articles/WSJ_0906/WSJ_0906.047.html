	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Over-the-counter stocks crept higher in quiet
trading as investors remained cautious about the economy and
the likelihood of peace in the Persian Gulf.
   The Nasdaq Composite Index advanced 0.77 to 382.44, a 0.2%
gain. Volume rose slightly to 89 million shares from 78.1
million Tuesday. Advancing stocks overtook decliners, 1,019
to 784. But stocks falling to new lows continued to swamp
those reaching new highs, 110 to 12.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>At least one OTC stock got a boost from the Middle East
conflict. Survival Technology rebounded 1 1/4 to 10 3/4 after
the Bethesda, Md., maker of nerve gas antidote kits said it
received a contract worth about $4.8 million from the
Department of Defense. The shares last month rose to a
52-week high of 15 1/4 as the company began to see a pickup
in orders for the kits following the U.S. troop deployment in
the Persian Gulf.</p>
<p>Overall, traders said much of the day's trading was
lackluster as investors continued to wait for news on the
economic front or from the Middle East. "I haven't been made
a believer in a rally," said E.E. "Buzz" Geduld, president of
Herzog, Heine & Geduld in New York. Mr. Geduld said he isn't
seeing enough conviction among investors in OTC stocks to
convince him that the shares will rally.</p>
<p>Technology issues ended the day mixed. Mr. Geduld said
interest in the issues wasn't very keen. Oracle Systems, the
day's most active stock, fell 1/2 to 10 5/8 as some analysts
reported expectations of slowing growth in the semiconductor
industry.</p>
<p>Among other technology issues, Intel fell 1 to 32 1/2;
Conner Peripherals added 5/8 to 22 1/4; Sun Microsystems
gained 1/8 to 29 1/8; Adobe Systems advanced 3/8 to 28 1/2;
Seagate Technology fell 1 to 9 and Microsoft tumbled 3 1/4 to
59.</p>
<p>Financial and insurance issues were among the day's
gainers. First Liberty Financial rose 3/4 to 6 1/4;
Cincinnati Financial jumped 1 3/4 to 85 1/2; insurer Old
Republican International added 1/8 to 25; and NAC Re, a
reinsurance holding company, advanced 1 3/4 to 30 3/4. The
Nasdaq Insurance Index gained 1.88 to 447.56. Two of Nasdaq's
three other financial indexes ended the day higher.</p>
<p>Strong earnings fed gains in two restaurant stocks:
Cracker Barrel Old Country Store rose 1 1/2 to 23 1/2 and
Vicorp Restaurants climbed 1 7/8 to 24 1/2. Cracker Barrel,
of Lebanon, Tenn., reported that net income for the fourth
quarter ended Aug. 3 rose to 47 cents a share from 36 cents a
year earlier. Vicorp, headquartered in Denver, said net
income for the third quarter ended Aug. 5 jumped to 41 cents
a share from 25 cents a year earlier.</p>
<p>Peerless Manufacturing gained 1 to 16 3/4 after the Dallas
maker of equipment for the natural gas industry posted
operating profit for fiscal 1990 ended in June of $1.52 a
share up sharply from five cents in 1989.</p>
<p>Earnings growth also boosted Duty Free International 1 3/4
to 20 1/4. The Ridgefield, Conn., operator of duty-free
retail stores reported that net income for the second quarter
ended July 31 rose to 41 cents a share from 35 cents a year
earlier.</p>
<p>G-III Apparel Group slid 1 1/4 to 6 3/4 after the New York
apparel maker said it expects to report that earnings for
fiscal 1990, ended July 31, ranged between $1.70 and $1.80 a
share, up from $1.28 in 1989 on a pro forma basis.</p>
<p>That projection is well below the range indicated last
week by G-III chief financial officer Alan Feller. Mr. Feller
said last Monday the company expected year-end earnings in
the range of $1.95 a share, an estimate given by Oppenheimer
& Co. analyst Dennis S. Rosenberg. Oppenheimer underwrote an
initial offering of G-III last December at $13 a share.</p>
<p>Advanced Logic Research fell 1/2 to 9 after the Irvine,
Calif., maker of microcomputer systems announced a 14% price
cut in one of its computer products.</p>
<p>FNB Rochester continued its slide after calling off merger
talks Tuesday with a Turkish investor group. Shares of the
Rochester, N.Y., bank holding company tumbled 1 1/4 to 6 3/4
after Tuesday's 3/4-point fall.</p>
<p>Analysts comments sparked gains in Medical Care
International and Borland International and losses in K-Swiss
and Chips & Technologies, according to Dow Jones Professional
Investor Report.</p>
<p>Donaldson Lufkin & Jenrette initiated analyst coverage of
Borland with a "buy" recommendation and put the Scotts
Valley, Calif., maker of computer software products on its
list of shares recommended for purchase. Analyst Scott Smith
told DJPIR he thinks the company's "broad product line and
new product momentum" will allow Borland not only to emerge
as a software leader but also weather a recession. Borland
rose 1/2 to 17 1/8.</p>
<p>Medical Care International gained 1 1/4 to 38 after
Donaldson Lufkin & Jenrette analyst John F. Hindelong
repeated a "buy" opinion on the Dallas operator of outpatient
surgical centers Tuesday after the market closed. Mr.
Hindelong told DJPIR he expects Medical Care to earn $1.45 a
share in 1990 compared with 96 cents a share in 1989. A group
including FMR Corp., a Boston holding company, has an 11.8%
stake in the company.</p>
<p>Class A shares of K-Swiss tumbled 1 1/4 to 18 1/2 after
Merrill Lynch analyst Brenda Gall reduced her 1990 and 1991
earnings estimates for the newly public maker of athletic
footwear. DJPIR reported that Ms. Gall maintains her
near-term "attractive" and long-term "buy" opinions on the
stock.</p>
<p>K-Swiss Chief Financial Officer George Powlick said that
Goldman Sachs & Co. analyst Jay J. Meltzer also recently
lowered his earnings estimates. However, Mr. Powlick declined
comment on the analysts' actions and on specific estimates.
K-Swiss went public June 5 at $17.50 a share in an
underwriting led by Goldman Sachs.</p>
<p>Chips & Technologies fell 3/4 to 11 1/2 after Goldman
Sachs analyst Rajiv Chaudhri downgraded his investment rating
on the stock to "hold" from "attractive" and lowered his
earnings estimates for the San Jose, Calif., maker of
computer chips.</p>
<p>Mr. Chaudhri said continued pressure on prices, erosion of
market share and increasing operating expenses are likely to
curtail the company's earnings for the next several quarters,
DJPIR reported. He cut his earnings estimate for the
company's fiscal first quarter ending Sept. 30 to 15 cents a
share from 35 cents, compared with the year-earlier earnings
of 58 cents a share.</p>
