   Hasn't Found a Home</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>GOOD DESIGN can get you to first base, but
product-liability worries can make it hard to score. Ask John
Gatzemeyer.</p>
<p>While a student of industrial design at Syracuse
University, Mr. Gatzemeyer, now living in Schenectady, N.Y.,
developed a safety rail to help young children go up and down
stairs. Made of 42-inch plastic poles, the rail clamps or
screws to any existing adult stair rail, bannister or wall.
Height can be adjusted as a child grows.</p>
<p>Mr. Gatzemeyer's design won a first prize last year from
the Juvenile Products Manufacturers Association, which
sponsors student work at Syracuse, and a gold award from the
Industrial Designers Society of America this year. But it's
winning nervous looks from industry.</p>
<p>Fisher-Price declined to produce the Gatzemeyer child rail
because, says product designer Ken Morton, the toy company
saw only a "small market opportunity." A second reason was
fear of getting sued if some child got hurt. "We're a little
bit afraid to do anything with a product that has anything to
do with stairs," says Mr. Morton.</p>
<p>"Product liability is definitely getting worse," says Jim
Stephenson, president of Degree Baby Products, West Hills,
Calif., which is currently considering the Gatzemeyer child
rail. Small companies, unable to obtain liability insurance,
are forced either to "forget the idea or sell it to someone
who's big enough to afford the insurance," Mr. Stephenson
adds.</p>
<p>Worries about lawsuits are stifling new products, agrees
William MacMillan, chief operating officer of the Juvenile
Products Manufacturers Association. "The threat of massive
product-liability claims is causing a reduction in
innovation," Mr. MacMillan says. "It means fewer products on
the market."</p>
<p>Design Instruction</p>
<p>May Have a New Look</p>
<p>IN CAMBRIDGE, Mass., a new school is forming that promises
to take a more businesslike approach to teaching graphic
design.</p>
<p>Students at the New School of Design will gain an
appreciation of both the value that good design adds to
business and the costs of design work, "things not frequently
taught in schools," says president James Davies. The school's
trustees, council of advisers and teachers will be chosen
mostly from the ranks of professional designers. Students
will serve internships in leading design offices.</p>
<p>The New School hopes to start with 20 graduate students in
the fall of 1992. Meanwhile, it's looking for $2 million in
funding.</p>
<p>Tents and Canopies</p>
<p>Get Down to Business</p>
<p>THE CIRCUS is coming to town -- and to the office.</p>
<p>FTL Associates, New York, designs outdoor tents -- most
recently a portable performance pavilion to be shared by the
City of New York, the Metropolitan Opera and the
Philharmonic. But FTL also likes to put tents inside offices.</p>
<p>There the main purpose of these tensile forms is to act
like a photographer's umbrella, reflecting and diffusing
light and reducing glare on computer screens. What's more, a
canopy over a conference area can serve as a landmark that
helps guide visitors through a maze of desks. And, says FTL
principal Nicholas Goldsmith, office tents "soar and sail and
lift the spirit." He cautions: "The person who wants a
mahogany desk with brass trim won't want to have a tent."</p>
<p>The Bradford Exchange, which sells limited-edition plates
and other collectibles, asked FTL to hang 15 tents at
different levels over a 30,000-square-foot area in its
offices in Niles, Ill. Chief Executive Richard Tinberg says
the tents help remind Bradford employees of the company's
"commitment to creativity."</p>
<p>On the negative side, says Mr. Tinberg, the
silicone-coated fiberglass forms haven't been cleaned since
they were installed five years ago. Lowering them would
require "a very, very major effort," he says. The project's
architect, Thomas Hickey, says the tents, which cover 200
desks, probably added 10% to the cost of the building.</p>
<p>On a smaller scale, working with lighting designer Peter
Barna of New York, FTL has also designed a prototype office
lighting system that uses winglike structures attached to the
tops of partitions to beam light up, overhead canopies to
reflect light down, and backlit desk panels to minimize
computer glare. Designer Goldsmith says the panels are much
less expensive than individual "task" lights at each desk,
and the system as a whole is cost competitive.</p>
