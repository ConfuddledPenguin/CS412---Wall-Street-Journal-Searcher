	<p class="article-leader">World oil inventories are beginning to shrink as a result
of the Middle East crisis, suggesting tight supplies may lie
ahead at the consumer level.
   While more than enough oil is available now, shortages
could develop by the last half of the fourth quarter, John
Easton Jr., an assistant energy secretary, told a House
committee yesterday.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Whether oil supplies become that tight or not, the mere
prospect of such a development is keeping prices firm.
Petroleum prices rose again yesterday, though traders
attributed the increases more to tough talk by President
George Bush and Iraq's Saddam Hussein than to fundamental
supply and demand factors.</p>
<p>North Sea crudes increased between 65 and 95 cents a
barrel. U.S. refiners raised field postings for West Texas
Intermediate, the American benchmark crude, 75 cents to
$28.25 a barrel. In U.S. futures trading, the price of a
similar crude for October delivery was up 65 cents to settle
at $29.77 a barrel. Though the futures price of October
gasoline fell 2.25 cents a gallon to 92.27 cents, traders had
expected a correction in the wake of Tuesday's big run-up of
more than eight cents a gallon.</p>
<p>Above-ground stores of crude oil and petroleum products --
enough to be considered a surplus before Iraq's Aug. 2
invasion of Kuwait -- still are relatively high. They have
provided a comfortable cushion for the world's fuel users,
despite the loss to oil markets of 4.3 million barrels a day
that Iraq and Kuwait had exported before the global embargo.</p>
<p>But they aren't expected to remain at such levels much
longer. Inventories are coming down, oil analysts say,
because petroleum demand has risen beyond seasonal
expectations on war fears, and because of the time it is
taking for promised supply increases to reach the market.
Several producers with idle capacity, including leading
members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries,
are increasing output sufficiently to replace the bulk of the
missing Iraqi oil. But production technicalities and shipping
delays will delay the effect on oil markets by several weeks.</p>
<p>As a result, "We are beginning to see the initial evidence
of some drawdowns" in oil inventories, said John Redpath, an
analyst with Energy Security Analysis, which tracks world oil
supplies.</p>
<p>Though petroleum products generally had been considered to
be in balance before the Iraqis occupied Kuwait, there was a
surplus of crude oil. The crude "overhang," as the glut was
known in the industry, was estimated to be 100 million to 300
million barrels.</p>
<p>Washington-based Energy Security Analysis set the crude
surplus at the lower end of the range. In late July,
according to its estimates, crude oil accounted for 1.56
billion barrels of the total petroleum inventories of 2.8
billion barrels.</p>
<p>"Since then, it's very conceivable we have used 60 million
barrels of the overhang" of 100 million barrels, Mr. Redpath,
the analyst, said.</p>
<p>The International Energy Agency estimates that inventories
have been drawn down steadily since the Middle East crisis
developed but at rates averaging only about 300,000 barrels a
day. However, the Paris-based agency reported yesterday that
it expects a "large" drawdown in commercial inventories this
month, before the effect of the OPEC output increases becomes
significant. Some International Energy Agency officials have
estimated that this month's withdrawals could exceed one
million barrels a day.</p>
<p>The U.S. had been expected to be relatively immune to the
inventory reductions for a while, because it had been
receiving only modest amounts of Iraqi and Kuwaiti oil. But
yesterday, signs emerged that the U.S. already is affected.
According to the American Petroleum Institute's weekly
report, U.S. crude oil inventories dropped 4.4 million
barrels last week to 372.2 million.</p>
<p>Because oil companies have the inventories from which they
can draw supplies as needed, the world oil market "is
generally well supplied," according to the International
Energy Agency's monthly oil report yesterday. But the
International Energy Agency forecasts that supplies will
become "increasingly tighter" during the peak-demand winter
months.</p>
<p>In testimony before the House Government Operations
Committee yesterday, Mr. Easton, the Energy Department
official, agreed. He said that while the current oil supply
is more than adequate, shortages could develop before year
end. He said the Energy Department is "readying" the 590
million-barrel Strategic Petroleum Reserve for use "when the
conditions of the statute and public policy require it."</p>
<p>So far, the Bush administration has refrained from drawing
on the reserve the government has built up to protect the
country from an oil emergency. But Mr. Easton insisted that
the government stands ready to tap into it. "We are prepared
to use it in concert with our allies at the time we see
significant supply interruption," he told the House
committee.</p>
<p>Mr. Easton also predicted that by December, through
heightened U.S. production efforts, "We will have been able
to secure out of Alaska alone an additional 250,000 barrels
{of oil} a day."</p>
