	<h3>Marketing & Media: Summer Movies Failed to Outdraw 1989 Record Crop</h3>

	<p class="article-leader">Despite a raft of big-budget, high-profile movies,
Hollywood's studios sold between $1.85 billion and $1.9
billion of tickets this summer, falling short of last year's
record $2 billion-plus take for the Memorial to Labor Day
season, according to preliminary industry estimates.
   Although the second-highest grossing summer on record, it
was disappointing for some studios that pushed out expensive
movies hoping to match the success of last year's hits.
Warner Bros.' "Batman," for example, did about $230 million
in the summer months last year; the highest grossing film
this summer was Paramount Communications Inc.'s "Ghost,"
which sold about $125 million of tickets in 53 days of
release through Labor Day.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>According to preliminary estimates from Variety, Walt
Disney Co. was the summer's market share leader, with close
to 18% of the box office, followed by Paramount, with about
16.4%, and MCA Inc.'s Universal Studios, with about 14.7%.</p>
<p>"This was a good summer, not a great summer, with a lot of
pictures doing great business but no out-and-out runaway
blockbuster," said Philip Garfinkle, executive vice president
of Entertainment Data Inc. in Beverly Hills, Calif.</p>
<p>Only three movies other than "Ghost" took in more than
$100 million, and none appears likely to increase revenue
much before new fall movies push them out of theaters.
According to figures compiled by Entertainment Data and
Baseline Inc., "Total Recall," produced by Carolco Pictures
Inc. and distributed by Sony Corp.'s Tri-Star Pictures unit,
was No. 2 at the box office with $116.6 million; "Die Hard
II," produced by News Corp.'s 20th Century Fox Film Co., was
third with $109.7 million; and Disney's "Dick Tracy" sold
$103.7 million of tickets.</p>
<p>Disney was able to take the box office lead thanks to
"Dick Tracy" and a number of other more modest films that
performed respectably, including "Arachnaphobia," the
re-release of the animated "The Jungle Book," "Ducktales: The
Movie," and even "Ernest Goes to Jail." But the studio also
got a big boost from a movie released in March that continued
to be a big hit over the summer: "Pretty Woman," which has
taken in close to $170 million at the box office so far and
is still doing business.</p>
<p>As many industry executives and analysts feared at the
beginning of the season, there was a glut of big-budget,
action-oriented films; as each new film opened, it hurt
movies already in the market.</p>
<p>Moreover, a number of the more expensive movies, which
cost between $50 million to $60 million to produce and $20
million or more each to market, performed well below
expectations. Paramount's "Days of Thunder," for example,
sold about $80.6 million of tickets. Another Paramount
release, "Another 48 Hours," also sold about $80 million of
tickets. Even the No. 2 hit of the summer, "Total Recall,"
was expected to sell far more tickets. The films could get a
big boost from foreign release, however, not to mention video
and television markets.</p>
<p>Other disappointments included such sequels as Warner's
"Gremlins II" which sold only about $40.2 million of tickets
for the Time Warner Inc. unit; Orion Pictures Corp.'s
"Robocop II"; and Fox's "Exorcist III," which has sold only
about $20.8 million of tickets.</p>
<p>Although a number of movies released late in the summer
are doing respectable business, they too, appear to be
affected by an overall glut, and threatened by new releases.
Warner's "Presumed Innocent" is by far the most successful of
the late entries, selling close to $68 million of tickets.
But the studio's comedy, "My Blue Heaven," starring Steve
Martin, is faring less well, selling only about $18 million
of tickets. Warner was disappointed by the results of another
comedy released earlier in the summer, "Quick Change," which
sold only about $14 million of tickets.</p>
