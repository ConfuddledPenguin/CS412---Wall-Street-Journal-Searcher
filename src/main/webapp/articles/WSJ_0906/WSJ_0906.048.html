	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Pinnacle West Capital Corp., after agreeing to
a power-swapping deal that ended efforts by PacifiCorp to
acquire the company, said it would use proceeds from the deal
to reduce debt.
   At a meeting with securities analysts, Pinnacle West said
it would add the proceeds to its $750 million debt-reduction
plan, increasing the plan to $970 million by the end of 1993.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Analysts were surprised yesterday by the subdued reaction
of investors attending the meeting, many of whom saw Pinnacle
West stock plunge Tuesday to $12.375 a share from $16.125 as
arbitragers unloaded stock in large quantities. The stock
recovered, however, to $12.875 a share yesterday in another
day of heavy trading. Volume on the New York Stock Exchange
totaled 1.7 million shares yesterday and 2.2 million on
Tuesday compared with 130,000 on Friday before the
announcement of the pact.</p>
<p>"People came out of the meeting with a feeling that while
there would be no instant gratification from a sale of
Pinnacle West, the company was doing the right things to
improve in the long run," said Barry Abramson, a utility
analyst with Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. Last Friday,
Pinnacle West announced an agreement to swap electric power
on a seasonal basis with PacifiCorp, effectively ending
efforts by PacifiCorp to acquire Pinnacle West for $21 a
share, or $1.82 billion. PacifiCorp agreed to pay $220
million in cash for exchange of power from Arizona Public
Service Co., a Pinnacle West utility subsidiary.</p>
<p>Yesterday, Pinnacle West Chairman Richard Snell praised
the pact, saying he was "absolutely convinced" that it was a
"heck of a deal." Mr. Snell said that with the addition of
$220 million, Pinnacle would be able to retire $970 million
in debt by the end of 1993. As result, Pinnacle West hopes to
raise the book value of the company to $20 a share compared
to $16.31 in 1989 and restore its common-stock dividend by
the end of 1993. The company suspended its quarterly payout
of 40 cents a share last October.</p>
<p>After the meeting, Mr. Snell said in an interview that
PacifiCorp's $21-a-share offer was "substantially" below the
company's own assessment of its value. He wouldn't elaborate,
but some analysts said the difference was about $3 a share.</p>
