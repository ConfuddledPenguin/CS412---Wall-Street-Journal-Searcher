	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- The Food and Drug Administration began its
crackdown on misleading health claims on food labels by
challenging Ralston Purina Co. and five other companies on
their assertions regarding the health benefits of oat bran.
   Ralston Purina and its Continental Baking Co. unit were
the largest food processors to be targeted yesterday with
so-called regulatory letters from the FDA, according to
agency officials. The food industry has been anxiously
awaiting the first batch of letters as an indication of how
the FDA plans to curb the proliferation of dubious health
claims in recent years.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>One FDA official said that the six companies were singled
out because the agency believed it could, if necessary,
develop strong enforcement cases against them under the Food,
Drug and Cosmetic Act. In its letters, the agency demanded
that the companies justify their oat bran claims or stop
making them altogether. Typically, companies are given 10
days to respond to regulatory letters.</p>
<p>"We are, in effect, trying to establish the boundaries of
what we think is appropriate in the way of health claims and
what we think is inappropriate," an FDA official said.</p>
<p>Last night, a Ralston Purina spokesman in St. Louis
confirmed that the FDA had challenged claims being made for
two products containing oat bran -- Ralston Purina's Oat Chex
cereal and Continental Baking's Oatmeal Goodness bread.</p>
<p>"We're just beginning to review the matter," said the
spokesman, Pat Farrell. "We believe that we are in compliance
with all labeling requirements regarding all our products."</p>
<p>Oat Chex went on the market in September 1989 with
expectations that it would "benefit from continuing consumer
interest in oat bran," according to Ralston Purina's latest
annual report. Oatmeal Goodness bread, another new entry, has
been "a highly successful product" for Continental Baking,
the nation's largest producer of bakery goods, the annual
report said.</p>
<p>It couldn't be determined last night exactly what the FDA
found objectionable about the claims for these two products.
Moreover, officials wouldn't identify the other companies
that received letters from the agency's Center for Food
Safety and Applied Nutrition.</p>
<p>In this instance, the agency is intent on curbing claims
about how fiber helps lower cholesterol levels and reduce the
risk of a heart attack. Oat bran is a source of soluble
fiber. The thrust of the regulatory letters sent by facsimile
machine yesterday was that the products don't contain enough
oat bran to make any difference from a health standpoint.</p>
<p>In most cases, the product has less than one gram of oat
bran in each serving, according to an FDA official. Clinical
studies show that it takes 50 grams a day to have beneficial
effects, he added. What's more, the agency still hasn't
decided whether oat bran does reduce the risk of heart
attack.</p>
