	<p class="article-leader">THE U.S. RECEIVED a report that Iraqi soldiers shot an
American in Kuwait.
   The State Department said it didn't have details about the
severity of the man's injuries, and that it had been unable
to obtain more information from Iraqi authorities in Kuwait.
Earlier, Iraq's Saddam Hussein again called for a holy war
against American forces in the Persian Gulf and their Arab
allies, as Bush warned that sanctions against Iraq must
succeed or "we will review our options." Although Iraq
released more foreign women and children, Saddam Hussein said
Iraqi children could starve as a result of the embargo, and
he called for the overthrow of the governments of both Egypt
and Saudi Arabia.</p>

been grounded since May 29.</p>
<p>Engineers will order Magellan to start mapping the surface
of Venus later this month even if they don't understand why

to begin last week.</p>

<p>North Korea demanded that South Korea release jailed
dissidents and stop joint military exercises with the U.S. as

saying to do so would perpetuate national division.</p>

<p>The FDA anticipates damage claims from Chilean fruit
growers and exporters who argue that the agency erred last

FDA lab.</p>

<p>South Africa's de Klerk invited groups of all races to
join negotiations on a new constitution, and the president

township shooting that killed 11 people Tuesday.</p>

<p>A study concluded that children exposed to heavy amounts
of tobacco smoke at home are more than twice as likely to
develop lung cancer later in life than those who grow up in
smoke-free homes. The finding adds to a growing body of
evidence that nonsmokers may suffer adverse health effects
from other people's smoke.</p>

<p>The U.S. is expanding talks with Vietnam, seeking an
accord to end nearly 20 years of civil war in Cambodia,

stable outcome to the conflict," and added that the new
meetings with Hanoi would be held in Laos.</p>

<p>Bush and drug czar Bennett said the government is making
progress in its war on drugs, although victory isn't in

doing enough to help poor addicts living in urban areas.</p>

<p>Angola's parliament approved austerity measures to help an

include major cuts in spending on embassies abroad.</p>
