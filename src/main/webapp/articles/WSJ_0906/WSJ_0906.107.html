	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- Frederick Bush, who was President Bush's
chief fund-raiser in the 1988 election, was appointed
commissioner general of the U.S. pavilion at the 1992
Universal World's Fair in Seville, Spain.
   The appointment, announced by the United States
Information Agency, doesn't require Senate confirmation.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Mr. Bush, who isn't related to the president, was involved
in the influence-peddling scandal that unfolded last year at
the Department of Housing and Urban Development. His company
received a $268,000 technical-assistance grant over the
objections of reviewing officials at HUD. Apparently because
of that incident, which didn't result in any criminal
charges, the Senate returned to the president Frederick
Bush's nomination to be ambassador to Luxembourg.</p>
<p>In his new post, Mr. Bush will attempt to raise about $21
million for the pavilion from U.S. corporations, states and
municipalities, according to a USIA official. The U.S.
government will put up an additional $14 million. The USIA
official said that Mr. Bush won't be paid by the government;
his salary will come from nonprofit entities such as
foundations.</p>
