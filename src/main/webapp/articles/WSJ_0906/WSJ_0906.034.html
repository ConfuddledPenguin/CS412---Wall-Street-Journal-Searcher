	<p class="article-leader">"Never forget -- we all sailed here with God," says a
Greek leader trying to pep up the spirits of the huge armada
beached at Asian Troy for 10 years to repossess Helen. He's
right: Troy is doomed.
   Homer's "Iliad" (c. 700 B.C.) tells of a few decisive but
not final incidents in this 10th year. As the epic opens with
its rousing invocation: "Rage-Goddess, sing the rage of
Peleus's son Achilles," the fierce ace of the Greek army is
leaving the fighting to sulk in his tent. It is Achilles's
tantrum that forms the epic's heart. When he returns, it is
to avenge the death of his friend, Patroclus, killed by
Hector, the noblest of the Trojans. Achilles's rampage
embroils in blood the very elements and highest gods, only to
subside in two astonishingly courteous ceremonies:</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>We read how a civil and amused Achilles presides over
Greek funeral athletics in Patroclus's honor. We read with
even more amazement of the meeting between Achilles and
Priam, the father of the murdered Hector, who begs him to
return his son's corpse: "I have endured what no one on earth
has ever done before  -- /I put to my lips the hands of the
man who killed my son." Gently, Achilles consents. He knows
that it is his turn to die next.</p>
<p>It is the cruelest and the tenderest, the least humane and
the most profound of war stories. "War and Peace" alone has
the scope of the "Iliad," along with its frightening
altitude, as if told from a sheer height above a humanity
that is viewed, to use Eliot's words, as "some infinitely
gentle/infinitely suffering thing."</p>
<p>Robert Fagles, chairman of comparative literature at
Princeton and distinguished translator of Aeschylus and
Sophocles, now has a go at this greatest of Greek poems
(introduction and notes by Bernard Knox, Viking, 683 pages,
$35). How does he do? Very well indeed. I noted with surprise
that Richmond Lattimore's "Iliad," the first good modern
Englishing, appeared as long ago as 1951. Lattimore stressed
the Greek's alienness and hieratic, formulaic stiffness as he
marched with unsmiling literalness and monotony in a
loose-fitting, six-beat, dactylic armor. Lattimore wrote: "I
put my lips to the hands of the man who has killed my
children." Notice how Mr. Fagles's words, which are in fact
closer to the Greek, have the rhythm of English verse.</p>
<p>Between Lattimore and Mr. Fagles came Robert Fitzgerald,
who crucially returned to a five-beat, iambic meter, the
natural and native English beat. Mr. Fagles keeps the basic
five-beat iambic line but lets in air and space by often
expanding to six beats (like Alexander Pope before him) and
contracting to three. His verse units breathe and the
reader's eye is not confronted with 700 pages of lock-step
line-lengths.</p>
<p>His happiest idiom is hard contemporary American: ". . .
look out/a heavy wave of ruin's about to break your neck."
"But night came in too soon. That's what saved them." "You've
only plunged him deeper in his pride." "My comrade's death
has cut me to the quick." "The gods are hard to handle --
/when they come blazing forth in their true power." ". . .
the wild mountain hawk, the quickest thing on wings."</p>
<p>A lot of the "Iliad" is speech-war conferences, frontline
challenges and ripostes -- Mr. Fagles's purified
colloquialism is ideal here. And he does bloody action
clearly: ". . . ramming the spearhead square between his
teeth so hard/he hooked him by that spearhead over the
chariot-rail/hoisted, dragged the Trojan out as an angler
perched/on a jutting rock ledge drags some fish from the
sea."</p>
<p>He offers simplicity ("the funeral fires sank low, the
flames died down"). He offers pathos ("the boy goes up to his
father's old companions,/tugging at one man's cloak,
another's tunic,/and some will pity him, true,/and one will
give him a little cup to drink,/enough to wet his lips, not
quench his thirst"). And provides simile's energy ("She
{Athena} put fresh strength in his back, spring in his
knees/and filled his heart with the horsefly's raw
daring-/brush it away from a man's flesh and back it
comes,/biting, attacking, crazed for sweet human blood").</p>
<p>Compare Mr. Lattimore's unmusical "haul off the body and
give it to the dogs of Troy" with Mr. Fagles's "drag the
trunk away to glut the dogs of Troy." The dance of ds, rs, ts
and gs in the latter shows a poet at work, and at work in a
specifically English-language tradition.</p>
<p>We can hear Milton in Mr. Fagles's "our great work lies
all before us, still to do," Keats in his "all your deathless
ease," Whitman in his "You are goddesses, you are there, you
know all things," and Shakespeare everywhere. And we also can
hear Ali in the words of the boxer Epeus, "I am the
greatest]" That's as accurate as and livelier than Mr.
Lattimore's "I claim I am the champion" or Mr. Fitzgerald's
"I'm best, I don't mind saying" -- neither of which sounds
like anything a boxer might conceivably utter.</p>
<p>Pope remains the greatest translator (for one thing, he
can handle the divine comedy in Homer better than anyone
today), but Mr. Fagles can claim to be the 20th-century
champion.</p>
<p>Hint to first-time readers: Read the "spine" books of the
narrative (1, 9, 16, 18, 22, 24) first; get an overall feel
for the big things; then go back and plunge in with a relaxed
sense of who are the stars and who the extras; play at being
a god.</p>
