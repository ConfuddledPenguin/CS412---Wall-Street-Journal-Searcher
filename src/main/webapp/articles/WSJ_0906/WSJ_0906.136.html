	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- After months of searching, Bertelsmann AG
appointed Paul D. Neuthaler chairman and chief executive
officer of its Bantam Doubleday Dell Publishing Group unit.
   Mr. Neuthaler, who will assume his post Monday, fills a
void left by Alberto Vitale, who quit last November to run
rival publisher Random House Inc. The 47-year-old Mr.
Neuthaler, with a 25-year career in publishing, has been
immersed for the last decade in scientific and professional
publishing, as opposed to the general-interest or trade
publishing for which Bantam Doubleday is known.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The choice surprised many in the publishing industry
because Mr. Neuthaler hadn't been among the rumored
candidates for the job and hasn't much experience as a
manager in trade publishing. While Bantam Doubleday Dell on
the whole is profitable, losses continue at Doubleday, where
the publisher was replaced in January. A spokesman said
losses have been narrowed considerably at Doubleday, helped
partly by the success of the reissued, expanded Stephen King
novel "The Stand."</p>
<p>However, Bertelsmann executives have made clear that
financial acumen was at least as important as publishing
experience in a chief executive. Also, Bertelsmann has said
in the past that it was interested in acquiring some
professional and scientific publishing properties, which is
Mr. Neuthaler's area of expertise. For the past four years,
Mr. Neuthaler has been a partner in closely held JPT
Publishing Group Inc., the owner of scientific and
professional publishing properties with annual revenue of
about $100 million.</p>
<p>Such publishing fields tend to be more stable and steady
in their earnings, and Bertelsmann has prosperous interests
overseas in technical and professional publishing.
Bertelsmann hired Mr. Nuethaler in the mid-80s to search for
such properties for the company to buy in the U.S. However,
having spent about $800 million for Doubleday and RCA Records
in 1986, Bertelsmann wasn't inclined to make additional
purchases and Mr. Neuthaler left the company.</p>
<p>Mr. Neuthaler, who has a doctoral degree in literature and
wrote his dissertation on an obscure 17th-century Welsh poet,
said that while his career has lately focused on technical
publishing, he got his start editing general-interest books
at such publishing houses as Simon & Schuster.</p>
<p>"I'm a publishing executive and formats and subjects not
withstanding, I think there are a lot of transferable
skills," he said. "I also have a lot to learn."</p>
<p>Bernhard von Minckwitz, who has been interim chief
executive officer, was given the new title of executive
chairman of Bantam Doubleday. He won't oversee the day-to-day
operations. He continues to be president of Bertelsmann
Publishing Group International.</p>
