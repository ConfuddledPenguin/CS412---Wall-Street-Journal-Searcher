	<p class="article-leader">Lukens Inc. said it should have "record results" for
fiscal 1990, compared with last year's net income of $41.5
million, or $4.73 a share.
   Speaking to security analysts, W.R. Wilson, Lukens
chairman and chief executive officer, said the company
intends to find more export markets for its specialty plate
steels.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Mr. Wilson suggested that acquisitions are part of the
growth plan. The "ideal candidate" for acquisition is a
company that would generate $225 million in sales and
operating margins of 11% or more, he said.</p>
<p>Lukens officials said that representatives of the United
Steelworkers of America union have agreed to meet next week
to discuss a new contract. The union's contract doesn't
expire for another year, but the Coatesville, Pa.-based
company has asked the workers to open talks early.</p>
