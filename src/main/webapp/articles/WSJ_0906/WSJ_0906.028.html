	<p class="article-leader">Dusty old regulations from a bygone era are costing many
futures-market investors big bucks, charge money managers who
are campaigning to get the rules changed.
   Investors attracted by the potentially big profits in
commodity futures are often advised not to trade on their own
but to turn their money over to professional managers, whose
job it is to move nimbly into and out of these fast-moving
markets.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>But those profits are being severely trimmed by
regulations put in place 60 years or so ago, when futures
markets -- and investors' interests -- were vastly different
than they are now.</p>
<p>At least, that's the contention of commodity trading
advisers, which is what money managers are called in the
futures markets. They argue that rules limiting how many
futures contracts they can hold at any one time cost their
clients untold millions in lost profits or
bigger-than-necessary losses. By no mere coincidence, if
clients' profits were larger, advisers would reap fatter
performance fees.</p>
<p>So-called position limits set the maximum number of
futures contracts an individual or organization can control
in total and in each contract month. They are set for each
commodity by futures exchanges, under Commodity Futures
Trading Commission guidelines. There are no limits on other
investments, such as stocks and bonds.</p>
<p>Position limits date from the 1920s and 1930s, when their
purpose was to prevent markets from being "cornered" -- that
is, preventing any one market participant from taking such a
large position that he could dictate the prices at which
other players had to trade. The limits have been increased
from time to time, but not enough to satisfy the large
commodity mutual funds and pool operators -- which didn't
exist 60 years ago.</p>
<p>Some commodity trading advisers assert these limits force
them into portfolio holdings they consider less than optimal,
which results in forgone profits or increased losses. A few
advisers say position limits are one reason they're deserting
U.S. markets to trade more overseas.</p>
<p>One large trading adviser tells how position limits hurt
his clients in the 1988 bull market in grains and soybeans.
The firm bought the maximum amount of soybean futures, 2,400
contracts, in December 1987. His trading system, however,
called for the purchase of 4,800 contracts. By the time the
soybean position was sold out in June 1988, drought had
pushed up soybean prices to the extent that his firm made
about $34 million for its clients. While that was a
respectable 5% gain on the fund's assets, "we would have made
twice that if there were no limits," he laments.</p>
<p>Peter Borish, director of research at Tudor Investment
Corp., Paul Tudor Jones's trading company, which has $475
million under management, says limits are one factor that
influences how much money an adviser can effectively manage.
He says that last December his firm returned $200 million in
profits to its clients, rather than reinvesting it, because
Mr. Jones believed he couldn't achieve big enough returns.
One reason for this decision, Mr. Borish says, was position
limits.</p>
<p>Many commodity trading advisers say they could live with
overall limits if they were permitted to deal entirely in the
most actively traded contracts. As it is, while the limit on
soybeans is 2,400 contracts, for example, no more than 600
can be in any one contract month.</p>
<p>One adviser specializing in agricultural commodities
recalls selling wheat futures in May 1989 because, if prices
fell as he expected, he could buy back the contracts for less
than he sold them. Because of the monthly limits he had to
sell some May contracts when his preference was for July and
September. One night, news broke of a Soviet wheat purchase,
and the next day prices shot up.</p>
<p>Clients who were in the May futures lost $700 a contract
while those in July and September lost only about $325 a
contract. Some customers became aware of the discrepancy when
they saw their friends' quarterly account statements
reflecting lower average losses. "Such differences are not
much fun to try to explain to a client," says this adviser
ruefully.</p>
<p>Peter Matthews, chief portfolio strategist for Mint
Investment Management Co., with about $1 billion under
management, says that when Mint started nine years ago about
30% of the portfolio was allocated to agricultural
commodities. "Today, that fraction is less than 10%," he
says, "but we would like it to be closer to 20%."</p>
<p>He says the relatively smaller participation in
agricultural markets has caused a larger fraction of his
firm's funds to be allocated to financial futures, where
limits are very large, or to overseas markets, which have no
limits.</p>
<p>Financial futures, introduced over the past 20 years, have
large position limits because nobody can corner these
markets: The futures are either based on readily available
securities, such as U.S. Treasury bonds, or are settled in
cash, such as stock-index futures. And U.S. exchanges' share
of global futures and options trading declined to 75% from
91% between 1985 and 1989, according to Molly Bayley, a
former executive director of the CFTC and now a consultant.</p>
<p>Mr. Matthews advocates the CFTC's allowing trading
advisers higher limits or, ideally, no limits at all. "We
already have so many people looking at us that there is no
way we would not be noticed if we tried to do something
improper," he says.</p>
<p>But the CFTC doesn't seem to be in a mood to accommodate
the advisers. John Mielke, director of surveillance for the
CFTC, says the Commodity Exchange Act long ago decided that
excessive speculation leads to excessive price volatility and
by definition that is bad. He notes that the largest pool of
speculative capital today is in commodity pools, so it is
"logical to extend the regulatory mandate of position limits
to these pools."</p>
<p>However, Patricia Gillman, a former staff attorney with
the CFTC and now in practice in Washington, says position
limits are a very crude regulatory tool. "Unlike 50 years
ago, today we have all kinds of computer-based tools to help
regulators monitor market participants," she says.</p>
<p>Mr. Mielke of the CFTC responds, "There might be better
ways to address concerns (about market concentrations) than
(speculator position) limits but nobody has brought them to
our attention."</p>
<p>Still, the CFTC isn't unmindful of the need for change. In
October 1988 it adopted a rule that provided, in certain
cases, an exemption from limits for positions that have a
common owner but are independently controlled. On July 24 the
CFTC proposed a rule that would broaden the eligibility for
such exemptions for trading advisers.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, various committees at the Chicago Board of
Trade are considering rule changes that would increase
current limits in soybeans and grains, says Fred Grede, vice
president for administration. He says these changes are in
response to requests from trading advisers, adding how the
committees are also hearing from hedgers and floor brokers.
"There is some controversy about these proposals," Mr. Grede
observes.</p>
