	<p class="article-leader">MONTREAL -- Charles Bronfman, majority owner of the
Montreal Expos, said directors extended the deadline for the
sale of the baseball team, giving a group of potential local
buyers more time to put together a formal offer.
   After a meeting of the team's board Tuesday evening Mr.
Bronfman wouldn't specify the new deadline but told reporters
"we're pretty darned encouraged" the Expos will be sold to
Quebec buyers.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Mr. Bronfman, co-chairman of Seagram Co., and his two
minority partners originally set a deadline of Sept. 1 for a
local bid. They set a price of 100 million Canadian dollars
(US$86.2 million).</p>
<p>Expos president Claude Brochu and a local investment
dealer have been scrambling to put together a group of local
buyers. "The pressure isn't off, believe me," Mr. Brochu said
after Mr. Bronfman's announcement.</p>
<p>So far only one potential investor has stepped forward. A
unit of Desjardins Group, a financial services concern, said
it is ready to put up C$5 million as part of a buying group.
Desjardins also said the Quebec and Montreal governments will
have to help the local group acquire the Expos.</p>
