	<p class="article-leader">TORONTO -- The Canadian Auto Workers union selected Ford
Motor Co. of Canada as its target for labor negotiations with
the Canadian subsidiaries of the Big Three auto makers.
   Union contracts with the companies and their parent
companies in the U.S. all expire Sept. 14.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>In these pattern-setting negotiations, the union targets
one company and the contract reached with that company serves
as a model for the others. The United Auto Workers in the
U.S. has selected General Motors Corp. as its negotiating
target.</p>
<p>Robert White, president of the CAW, said Ford Canada, a
unit of Ford Motor Co., was chosen because the company trails
General Motors of Canada Ltd. on some benefits and because
the company is in a strong financial position.</p>
<p>Donald McKenzie, chief negotiator at Ford Canada, said the
company welcomes the CAW's decision. "In this process of
patterned bargaining, a settlement that ultimately is going
to evolve at this table is one that is shaped by the way our
company perceives issues . . . and will ultimately be an
agreement that we can live with, tailored to Ford."</p>
<p>With the auto industry in decline, the Canadian economy in
a slump and the Canadian dollar at a 10-year high against the
U.S. currency, the talks aren't likely to be easy. Mr. White
said they would be the "most difficult (talks) since the
early 80s." He said it won't be easy to reach an agreement
with Ford Canada without a strike of the company's 12,000
unionized employees.</p>
<p>A strike at Ford Canada's operations would have a quick
ripple effect on Ford Motor Co. in the U.S. The Canadian
company is the only producer of Ford's Crown Victoria and
Grand Marquis cars in North America and the only source of
V-6 engines used in Thunderbird and Lincoln models, which are
produced in U.S. plants. Parent company officials said it
would take about two weeks before U.S. operations would be
affected by a strike in Canada.</p>
<p>Mr. McKenzie said the company has made some preparations
in anticipation of a strike, but wouldn't discuss inventory
levels.</p>
<p>Dennis DesRosiers, an industry analyst, said the tone of
the negotiations will be dictated, to a large degree, by
industry conditions. "Ford's hands are, to a large degree,
tied. They'll have to bargain hard -- they can't give away
the ship," he said.</p>
<p>Still, industry analysts say the CAW is in a better
bargaining position than the UAW. Labor costs in Canada are
lower than in U.S. plants and, although vehicle sales on both
sides of the border have slowed down, some of the Big Three's
more successful models are built in newer, more efficient
assembly plants in Canada. As a result, there have been
proportionately fewer workers laid off in Canada than in the
U.S.</p>
<p>So, while job security is the major issue in the U.S.
talks, union demands in Canada are broader. The CAW said it
is seeking higher wages, improved benefits and more time off.</p>
