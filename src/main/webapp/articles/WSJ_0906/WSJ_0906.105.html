	<div class="article-body"><p>A case of burnout on Wall Street has sparked a bright new
day for hundreds of terminally ill children. Brooklyn-born
Thomas V. Karaban, 46 years old, had fought his way from
back-office clerk to high-powered securities dealer. After 10
years of running a bond trading department, he was living "in
suburban heaven" in Middletown, N.J. He was also living on
coffee and cigarettes -- "a 16-cup and a five-pack man," as
he describes himself at that time. In 1983, on the edge of
collapse, he decided there had to be a better way and quit
the Street.</p>
<p>This enforced departure, which brought a year "flat on my
back," helped Mr. Karaban find his better way and a whole new
perspective. While coaching a local junior hockey team during
his new-found leisure, he was told about a baby who needed a
liver transplant. He staged a hockey tournament and raised
$7,000 for the child. At the urging of the child's parents,
he went on to raise an additional $50,000.</p>
<p>Helping children stricken with terminal or catastrophic
illness would be his new purpose in life, Mr. Karaban
decided. With $200,000 of his own savings, he set up the
Rainbow Foundation in 1984. Since that time the foundation
has helped more than 2,000 children with cash, medical
equipment, airline tickets to special hospitals, even a
funeral for a child whose parents couldn't afford one.</p>
<p>Mr. Karaban found the new work more than compensated for
the limousines and luxury lunches that had gone with his Wall
Street job. His philosophy is "kindness first and foremost."
Too many social welfare agencies, he says, have a clinical
approach. "They're almost too professional and they have
somewhat of a tendency to dehumanize the medical situation."</p>
<p>The Rainbow Foundation emphasizes the human touch. When
Mr. Karaban learned that a three-year-old cancer sufferer in
Hackensack, N.J., was especially depressed at being in the
hospital over Christmas, the foundation sent him a tree and
presents. For Easter, they brought him a live rabbit and a
magician. When the boy died that June, Mr. Karaban says, "it
hit us like a ton of bricks."</p>
<p>For a six-year-old girl who became a paraplegic after an
automobile accident, Mr. Karaban arranged flights to Miami,
which has a special center to treat such patients. But he
also included a special three-day detour to Disney World.</p>
<p>The children are the foundation's prime concern, but
families get help too. A New Jersey truck driver's
eight-year-old boy, for instance, was suffering from cancer
and the family was dipping into their mortgage money to meet
the medical bills. The week the boy died, the bank was
threatening foreclosure. The Rainbow Foundation stepped in to
help meet the mortgage payments.</p>
<p>Staffed entirely by volunteers, Mr. Karaban's foundation
gets more than 95% of its funds from individual and corporate
donations. Revenue last year was close to $160,000, with more
than 90% going directly to sick children or their families.</p>
<p>After six years as a full-time philanthropist, however,
Mr. Karaban found he could no longer carry the burden alone.
"I have one child in college and another ready to go," he
says. He went back to a Wall Street house this spring to head
up trading in federal agency bonds, but running the Rainbow
Foundation still takes up a major part of his time, and he
has added a new goal.</p>
<p>A member of a New Jersey state committee on child-abuse
prevention, Mr. Karaban is appalled that the state has no
permanent facility to treat abused children. The present
system -- putting children in foster homes or institutions --
is no real refuge for an abused child, Mr. Karaban argues. He
wants a state facility that will be "not an institution but a
place like a home." The governor's committee on which he sits
has just submitted a report to Gov. James Florio calling for
such a service. If Mr. Karaban's record of the past few years
is any clue, New Jersey will get one before too long.</p>
