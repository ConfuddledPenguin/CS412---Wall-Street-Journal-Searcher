	<p class="article-leader">POUGHKEEPSIE, N.Y. -- International Business Machines
Corp. introduced its long-awaited next generation of
mainframes, in an announcement that stuck pretty close to
expectations.
   The most powerful of the new mainframes, which will cost
as much as $22.8 million, will be available in about a year.
IBM, making the announcement at a mainframe facility here,
said those machines will be 1.7 to 1.9 times as powerful as
its fastest existing machine. IBM executives said they
expected that increase -- to what consultants say is more
than 210 mips, or million instructions per second -- will let
IBM maintain bragging rights as the seller of the fastest
mainframe around.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>With Hitachi Ltd. and Fujitsu Ltd. of Japan planning to
start shipping very powerful new generations of
IBM-compatible mainframes at around the same time, though,
consultants have said that the race will at least be closer
than ever, and that IBM could for the first time find itself
in second or third place in terms of processing power. IBM
has been losing market share in the mainframe area, falling
from its traditional 90% of the IBM-compatible market to
around 80% currently, and any loss of top-gun status for IBM
could help that erosion continue.</p>
<p>While waiting for the most advanced machines in the new
System 390 family to become available, IBM will sell five
"transition" machines. The machines, though labeled as part
of the new family, will essentially just repackage the guts
of the existing line in the new, refrigerator-sized cabinets.
Those machines, available immediately, also will include
fiber-optic channels, which sharply increase the speed at
which the mainframes can grab data from storage devices and
allow those devices to be located as much as six miles from
the mainframe, compared with a 400-foot limit at the moment.</p>
<p>Frank Gens, a consultant with International Data Corp.,
said the prices on the transition machines amount to a 16% to
20% price cut off the machines now being sold. That is in
line with the normal annual drop in computer prices.</p>
<p>George Conrades, an IBM senior vice president, said in
response to a question at a news conference that he thinks
the transition models will let IBM move to the new line
without hurting its revenue or earnings outlook.</p>
<p>"There's no question that in June and July there has been
some pause, but . . . we see a resumption in demand and
supply . . . and would expect to (meet our projections) both
this year and next," he said.</p>
<p>Some securities analysts have worried that IBM's mainframe
revenue will plunge in coming quarters, as customers stop
buying the current technology while they wait for the most
powerful of the new machines to become available. Many
customers interviewed in recent weeks have said they plan to
take a wait-and-see approach in deciding whether to buy a
transition machine or whether just to wait a year for the
more powerful machines. "There's really nothing new" in the
transition machines, said Peter J. Daboul, senior vice
president of information systems services at Massachusetts
Mutual Life Insurance Co. He added that "we're beginning to
see the mainframe becoming more of a commodity."</p>
<p>Any disruption in sales would be serious for IBM because
IBM's mainframes -- together with related peripheral devices,
software and maintenance -- account for more than half of its
revenue and earnings. Partly because of such concerns, IBM's
stock has tumbled from more than $122 in recent weeks;
yesterday, it closed at $102.375, down 12.5 cents in
composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange.</p>
<p>IBM also announced minicomputers as part of the System 390
family that replace two of its current lines -- the venerable
4381 and the 9370 family. The comparable machines in the new
line run as much as four times as fast as the current 4381s
and twice as fast as the 9370s. The ratio of price to
performance is as much as 50% better on the new machines, IBM
said, and consultants have said they should sell well. Some
of the machines are available right away, and all but one are
available by next March, so these machines could help take up
any slack created by any transition problems for their bigger
brothers.</p>
<p>The minicomputers will be able to use the same operating
systems that control the basic functions of the mainframes,
making these machines more of a family and less of a
hodgepodge. Using the same operating systems means a customer
could take an application, such as a payroll system, and run
it on any system from the least powerful in the 390 family up
to the most powerful, which is more than 100 times as fast.</p>
<p>IBM also announced versions of two of its big operating
systems -- VM and VSE -- that will, among other things, let
users write bigger programs and handle larger data bases than
they can now.</p>
<p>In addition, IBM announced "sysplex" capabilities, which
will let users lash together as many as eight of the new
mainframes in a way that should give them much more
flexibility and access to much more power. At the moment, if
the mainframe handling, say, an automated teller machine is
busy, someone has to wait to get his cash, even if the
mainframe's neighbor is sitting idle. Under "sysplex," the
transaction could automatically be passed to another machine.
The increase in available power will become even more
important as the decade unfolds if IBM is right that the
mainframe is moving away from its traditional work of
handling payroll and accounting and is becoming a "server,"
controlling the vast data bases that companies are trying to
make available to employees instantaneously to speed their
ability to make decisions.</p>
