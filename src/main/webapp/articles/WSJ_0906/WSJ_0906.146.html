	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Merrill Lynch said Dennis J. Hess, one of the
architects of its successful cash management account program
for individual investors, has resigned after 20 years with
the company.
   Mr. Hess, 50 years old, was senior vice president of
diversified financial services in the consumer-markets
sector. A spokesman for Merrill Lynch said Mr. Hess, who will
serve as a consultant to the company, resigned voluntarily. A
successor wasn't immediately named.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Mr. Hess helped devise Merrill's pioneering Cash
Management Account, which acts similarly to a bank and
brokerage account. It combines a securities account with
check-writing and credit-card privileges. Some Merrill
investors put the proceeds of securities sales into the
moneyfund part of the account.</p>
<p>Mr. Hess also had been responsible for management of the
company's insurance, mortgage, lending, credit, domestic
banking, trust service and real estate syndication business.</p>
<p>Mr. Hess was traveling yesterday and couldn't be reached
for comment. In a statement, he called his more than 20 years
at Merrill Lynch "highly rewarding," but said he considered
now "the appropriate time in my career to seek new
challenges."</p>
