	<p class="article-leader">MILAN -- The Italian government gave the green light to
sell its interest in the Enimont S.p.A. chemical venture to
Montedison S.p.A. if their difficult partnership fails to
survive.
   Minister of State Industry Franco Piga first urged state
energy agency Ente Nazionale Idrocarburi, which owns 40% of
Enimont, to reaffirm with Montedison its willingness to
pursue the joint venture under their original agreement. He
also suggested a management structure distributing
responsibility between the private and public partner.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>However, Mr. Piga said, "If this hypothesis isn't
feasible, ENI could propose to sell its entire stake to
Montedison" at a predetermined price.</p>
<p>It was the first time the government had indicated its
willingness to divest itself of the chemical venture before
the time period stipulated in the founding pact.</p>
<p>Mr. Piga added that if Montedison didn't agree to buy out
ENI at the predetermined price, ENI would buy out
Montedison's stake at that same price.</p>
<p>Montedison has repeatedly stated its desire to buy ENI's
stake; it has also refused to sell its own shareholding in
the joint venture.</p>
<p>Despite the government's acknowledgement that Enimont
should revert to single ownership if the current relationship
can't be sustained, Mr. Piga didn't specify when or how the
failure of the partnership would be determined.</p>
