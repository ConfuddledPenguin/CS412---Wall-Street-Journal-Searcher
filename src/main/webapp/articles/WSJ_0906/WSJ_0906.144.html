	<p class="article-leader">The Federal Trade Commission, cracking down on the cozy
relationship between big-time college sports and television,
plans to charge the College Football Association and Capital
Cities/ABC Inc. with violating federal antitrust laws in a
five-year broadcast contract.
   In a five-page administrative complaint to be formally
filed today with an administrative law judge, the commission
said the contract restricts competition in the marketing of
college football telecasts, reducing the selection of games
for consumers.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The FTC action threatens the ABC network's lock on nearly
all nationally televised college football games. Earlier this
year, the CFA and ABC signed a $215 million contract that
committed 63 of the association's 66 members to broadcast
their football games on the network from 1991 to 1995. The
FTC could seek to have the contract voided and could prohibit
any other agreements that restrict competition.</p>
<p>A lawyer familiar with the case said the FTC filing will
result in private negotiations between the agency and the
defendants. If no compromise is reached, the administrative
law judge would rule on the complaint after a hearing in
Washington Nov. 13. The defendants can appeal a ruling to the
full commission.</p>
<p>Lewis Engman, the Washington lawyer for CFA, said his
client's broadcast arrangement doesn't restrain competition,
noting that "there are hundreds of football games available
now" on television. He said the CFA is "confident the
commission ultimately will see that the contracts are good
for viewers and competiton." Capital Cities/ABC officials
couldn't be reached for comment yesterday.</p>
<p>The FTC, in bringing charges against ABC Sports and the
Denver-based College Football Association, essentially is
pursuing an arrangement that has been in force since 1984,
first between the CFA and CBS Inc., and now involving ABC.
The FTC complaint isn't expected to affect CBS's broadcasts
of CFA games this year.</p>
<p>In 1984, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that the National
Collegiate Athletic Association had violated antitrust laws
by acting as the sole, mandatory negotiating agent for all
college teams in the bargaining for television rights.</p>
<p>A spate of smaller contracts with various college
conferences followed, with teams able to decide whether to
take part in the television contracts. ABC made the most of
the new pacts. ABC already has an exclusive arrangement with
all teams in the Big Ten and Pacific 10 conferences and ABC
added the CFA contract in February, which gave the network a
monopoly on nearly all nationally televised college games.
The CFA consists of about 20 major independent universities
and most of the major athletic conferences.</p>
<p>That monopoly was broken only by the surprise withdrawal
of the University of Notre Dame, which signed its own, more
lucrative television deal with General Electric Co.'s NBC
network.</p>
<p>The FTC refused to confirm or deny the plans for a
complaint, but said it will hold a news conference this
morning "to announce a major antitrust action concerning
college athletics."</p>
