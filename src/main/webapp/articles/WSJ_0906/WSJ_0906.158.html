	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Prosecutors will attempt to bring their full
case against Michael Milken before a federal judge next
month, even though the government agreed to accept a plea
bargain in April.
   Prosecutors say they plan to urge U.S. District Judge
Kimba Wood to consider additional allegations against Mr.
Milken when she sentences him. These alleged crimes will be
detailed in a sentencing memo that Judge Wood is scheduled to
receive on Monday in federal court here.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>In the April agreement, Mr. Milken, the former head of
Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.'s junk-bond department, pleaded
guilty to six felony counts related to unlawful trading. The
government didn't agree to recommend any specific sentence,
as Mr. Milken's lawyers had hoped.</p>
<p>The government hopes that evidence of additional crimes --
presented in the memo and in live testimony by Ivan Boesky
and others -- will induce Judge Wood to dole out a stiff
sentence for the crimes to which Mr. Milken pleaded guilty.
The maximum prison sentence for these counts is 28 years.
Sentencing is scheduled for Oct. 1.</p>
<p>The U.S. Supreme Court and lower federal courts have ruled
in a series of cases that the government may ask a sentencing
court to consider alleged conduct for which the defendant
wasn't convicted and didn't plead guilty. The rulings are
controversial because they appear to penalize defendants for
crimes the government never proved beyond a reasonable doubt
that they had committed.</p>
<p>The sentencing memo is expected to include charges that
Mr. Milken helped prominent savings and loan executives,
among others, to defraud the public and violate tax laws, and
that Mr. Milken engaged in commercial bribery with certain
money managers.</p>
<p>Prosecutors may be particularly eager to air their full
case because they were recently stung by a pre-sentence
report written by the federal probation agency. That report
is understood to have favored Mr. Milken's position that his
contributions to society outweighed his crimes. While
probation agency recommendations can be very influential in
the sentencing of violent criminals, the recommendation could
be less significant in this case because there will be so
much additional information presented by both sides.
Probation reports are almost never made public.</p>
<p>Prosecutors have held lengthy discussions with attorneys
for Mr. Milken in recent months detailing what they plan to
say in their memo. Mr. Milken's lawyers are expected to
submit their own memo next week disputing those claims.</p>
<p>A judge isn't obligated to take the government's
additional allegations into consideration when deciding on an
appropriate sentence. But if Judge Wood decides she wishes to
consider the additional evidence in meting out a sentence,
Mr. Milken is entitled to defend himself at a hearing.</p>
<p>Lawyers for witnesses who aided the government in its case
against Mr. Milken have confirmed that they were told by
prosecutors that the government will seek to present the full
force of its case against Mr. Milken at any such hearing.
Prosecutors have told these attorneys that such a hearing
could last for more than three months.</p>
<p>Assistant U.S. Attorney John Carroll, the lead prosecutor
in the Milken case, declined to comment. A spokesman for Mr.
Milken also declined to comment.</p>
<p>A similar battle over sentencing erupted earlier this year
in the case against Robert M. Freeman, the former head of
arbitrage at Goldman, Sachs & Co. who pleaded guilty to a
single charge of insider trading. In that case, the judge
said that in issuing a sentence, he wouldn't consider any
crimes other than that to which Mr. Freeman pleaded guilty.
The government alleged that Mr. Freeman committed some 20
other crimes.</p>
<p>Robert McCaw, a lawyer for Mr. Boesky, the convicted
former stock trader, said he is watching the situation "with
great interest, and we'll see what happens." The government
has asked a federal court in Los Angeles to prevent
plaintiffs' lawyers in a civil suit from taking testimony
from Mr. Boesky until after Mr. Milken's sentencing, in order
to "protect" the government's interest in the case against
Mr. Milken.</p>
<p>Steve Andrews, the lawyer for James Dahl, a former Drexel
bond salesman, said, "We've spoken to the government about
potentially testifying" against Mr. Milken. Reid Weingarten,
a lawyer for Cary Maultasch, another former Drexel bond
salesman, said, "We have caught wind of the possibility of a
hearing. From our vantage point, this is an unfortunate
development that is likely to help neither the government nor
Mr. Milken."</p>
<p>If these and other witnesses were called, lawyers for Mr.
Milken would be allowed to cross-examine them as if they were
trying the case before the jury. But in such hearings, which
are rare, the government's burden of proof is lower than in a
criminal trial. It must prove its case simply by a
preponderance of evidence, rather than beyond a reasonable
doubt.</p>
<p>Legal experts said the argument for having such a hearing
is stronger in the Milken case than in the Freeman case
because the charges to which Mr. Milken has pleaded guilty
are broad based, and public attention in his case is
formidable.</p>
<p>A hearing has drawbacks for both sides. It could expose
Mr. Milken to significant public embarassment and further
civil liability if those he once hired at Drexel are now
forced to testify against him. For the government, a hearing
could further delay Mr. Milken's cooperation with the
government's continuing investigation, and would postpone
additional cases prosecutors intend to bring against Mr.
Milken's associates. Mr. Milken's lawyers would also likely
attempt to discredit many of the government's witnesses.</p>
