	<p class="article-leader">Say this for the new thinking in the Soviet Union: They
are at least able to recognize what needs fixing. Their
schools, for instance. It now appears that the Soviets are
exploring the choice movement in education. Choice is among
the reforms being touted by Edward Dneprov, the new Soviet
minister of education. He told the London Times that he has
long wanted to dismantle the centralized and authoritarian
Soviet education system. He foresees instead a system of
independent public and free-market private schools that will
accept school vouchers equivalent to the cost of educating a
child for one year. Pilot programs are already in the works
in Moscow and Rostov. Given the vociferous opposition to
choice from the educational establishment in the U.S., Soviet
students may have the freedom to attend the school of their
choice before Americans do.</p>
