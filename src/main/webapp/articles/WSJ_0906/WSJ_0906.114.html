	<p class="article-leader">MENLO PARK, Calif. -- Consolidated Freightways Inc. said
it is bringing in a co-founder of Federal Express Inc. to
help rescue Consolidated's money-losing Emery Worldwide
acquisition.
   Named by Consolidated as chairman and chief executive
officer of Emery was Arthur C. Bass, 58 years old, a veteran
top executive in both the airline and air freight industries
who helped start Federal Express and is credited with turning
around a number of troubled companies. Emery is a direct
competitor of Federal Express in the air freight and express
delivery market.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Mr. Bass's challenge now is to turn around Emery, which
has had losses of $145 million since being acquired by
Consolidated in April 1989 for $470 million in debt
assumption and cash. Emery at that time was known as Emery
Air Freight Corp.</p>
<p>Though Emery's losses narrowed to $36.6 million in the
second quarter from $70 million in the first period, analysts
say its future remains highly uncertain.</p>
<p>"The air freight market is treacherous and competition is
fierce," analyst G.A. Lidgerwood of First Boston Corp.
observed in a recent investment report. "Therein lies the
investment dilemma."</p>
<p>James R. Allen, vice president of Consolidated, attributed
Emery's losses to increased competition, a slowdown in the
international market and a softening of the domestic air
freight business. Mr. Allen said Emery also alienated some
customers by imposing a 7% fuel surcharge in June 1989.</p>
<p>But this year, Mr. Allen said, Emery has been able to cut
losses significantly by trimming the number of terminal
facilities, revamping flight schedules and making other
adjustments to increase operating efficiency. Mr. Allen added
that Consolidated is leaving it up to Mr. Bass to determine
other ways to increase revenue.</p>
<p>Reached by telephone yesterday, Mr. Bass said that he
hadn't yet had time to devise any specific money-making
strategies, pending a further look at the company he will be
heading. Mr. Bass most recently was president and chief
executive officer of Cooper Cos., New York.</p>
<p>Cooper said it named Richard W. Turner, president of
CooperVision, its optometric and ophthalmic business, as its
interim president and chief operating officer.</p>
<p>Analyst George V. Robertson of Alex. Brown in Baltimore
said that Mr. Bass probably will concentrate on increasing
Emery's business volume and revenue rather than on imposing
any more cutbacks.</p>
<p>Mr. Bass's position at Emery is a newly created one.
Donald G. Berger, who had headed the subsidiary as Emery
president, will continue in that title but will report to Mr.
Bass, according to Mr. Allen.</p>
<p>Consolidated's stock closed at $12.375, up 25 cents,
yesterday in New York Stock Exchange composite trading.</p>
