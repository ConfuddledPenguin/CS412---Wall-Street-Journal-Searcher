	<p class="article-leader">While George Bush was assembling his world-wide offensive
against Saddam Hussein, he took a few moments to sign his
name to something that doesn't comport with the
administration's commitment these days to a new world order.
Not unless protectionism is the order of the day.
   Mr. Bush signed into law a virtual ban on exporting logs
from public lands in the Pacific Northwest. Senator Bob
Packwood and other Northwest Congressmen wanted to redirect
the wood going overseas into the dying sawmills of their
region. Japan, the big overseas customer, prefers to use its
own mills attuned to local preferences. Until recently the
administration had opposed the export restrictions. But this
was before the spotted owl was drafted from obscurity by the
environmental lobby to sell the preservation of the
old-growth forest ecosystem.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Recall that it was the Bush administration which this
summer designated the spotted owl as threatened. That ruling,
though expected, has juiced up the environmental
protectionists. "There can be no doubt," the President said
on signing the export ban, "that high levels of export of
unprocessed timber have contributed to the decline in habitat
that caused this species to be listed" as endangered.</p>
<p>An irony of this "endangered species" gambit is that it
actually obscures how deeply felt the underlying economic
issues are in the Northwest. In fact, its effect extends into
Northern California (where the extremist environmental group
Earth First] is, among other acts, blocking logging trucks)
and even down as far as the mountains of Northern Arizona.
Estimates of job losses from logging cutbacks range as high
as 102,000 in the Northwest, so the timber-industry side is
as emotional about the matter as the greens.</p>
<p>In Washington, proceeds from log sales support schools
throughout the state. Democratic Governor Booth Gardner, an
opponent of log exports, must tread gingerly under the
Packwood provision, which gave him special powers to curb the
shipments. Timber interests fear a heavy foot.</p>
<p>But shutting off log exports from state lands (federal
lands have long been out of bounds) isn't going to be enough
for some. Rep. Peter DeFazio (D., Ore.) argues that private
lands should be treated no differently. Here, however, the
natural instincts of politicians really start transgressing
property rights. But Mr. DeFazio insists that mill workers
are going to be wiped out unless that next step is taken. As
always, protectionism expands inexorably.</p>
<p>Job-loss claims are always suspect, whether they're about
loggers or millers or candlestick makers. For instance, it's
also been pointed out that "saving" these milling jobs will
come at the expense of blue-collar jobs lost on the docks
when the export ban takes hold. This game can also lead to
silliness: Mr. DeFazio got the Forest Service to draft a
scheme to minimize lost logger jobs with make-work such as
tearing up old logging roads.</p>
<p>The truth is that jobs are lost all the time in a dynamic
economy, and while that can cause considerable immediate
grief for those caught unprepared, most industrious people
can get back on their feet soon if an economy is healthy and
creating new jobs. That's the critical element: fostering
economic growth. Protectionism impedes new economic growth.</p>
<p>This is not to deny that the situation in the Northwest
poses difficult choices for policy makers. The better
solution, though, would be to use the market more creatively
to find answers, rather than thwart it as Mr. Bush has done
by signing the Packwood bill.</p>
<p>What that ought to mean in the Northwest, and wherever
land use is in question, is (1) private property, the bedrock
of market-based prosperity, is respected; and (2) where
public property or resources are disputed, their proper
pricing should be the goal, along with the elimination of
subsidies. Translation: Privatize where possible, with
perhaps some land going to groups such as the Nature
Conservancy.</p>
<p>If the body politic indeed concludes that an owl, or the
ecosystem, deserves special protection (often, it appears,
for merely psychic rewards) then buy off enough of the
logging operations to satisfy that goal. Increasingly
economists are exploring this type of environmental
perestroika as an alternative to arbitrary rule making.</p>
<p>Better to develop this approach to resolving competing
resource interests than to encourage yet more clumsy
politicking. The log ban, in typical Rube Goldberg fashion,
contains an out whereby an adverse ruling under the General
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade would void the export cutoff,
but its backers think they can skirt that because the measure
can be justified under GATT as conservation. This is the sort
of finagling that breeds public cynicism -- and more
finagling.</p>
<p>The Japanese, not surprisingly, are fuming over the
President's decision to support the ban. Thus, recent gains
in the U.S.-Japanese trade relationship are now offset to
some degree by this latest action. Over the long run, this
sort of frustrating, zero-sum policy only provides long-term
work for the politicians.</p>
