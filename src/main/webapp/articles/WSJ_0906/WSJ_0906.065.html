	<p class="article-leader">DALLAS -- J.C. Penney Co., under pressure from sportsmen's
groups, pulled from its shelves a line of boys' clothing
carrying an anti-hunting message.
   Attached to the "Environmental Protection Department" line
of clothing are cards that say "Absolutely no hunting of wild
and free animals while wearing this garment," and "Wild life
protected by man surround the world with pure thoughts."</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>But both Penney and the maker of the clothing, H. Cotler
Co. of New York, insist they weren't trying to sell a
message. "We were just trying to sell the merchandise," said
Howard Cotler, head of Cotler Co. Added Duncan Muir, public
relations manager for Penney: "It is our policy not to take a
position one way or the other on these sorts of issues." In
this case, he said, after receiving numerous complaints
company officials decided that "frankly, we've made a
mistake."</p>
<p>Muir said he didn't know how many pieces of clothing were
being pulled from shelves, and he wouldn't disclose Penney's
investment in the line.</p>
