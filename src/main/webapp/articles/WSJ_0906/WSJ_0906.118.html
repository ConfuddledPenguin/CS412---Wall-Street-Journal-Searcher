	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Metropolitan Life Insurance Co. and CS First
Boston Inc. said they have formed a London-based
money-management unit that will begin offering international
investment services to U.S. pension funds.
   The joint venture, called CS First Boston Global Fund
Managers Ltd., is the latest example of how U.S. money
managers are catering to a surge in international investments
by U.S. pension funds.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"We have wanted to have an international investment
product capability for the institutional marketplace for some
time," said Kevin Putt, a Metropolitan Life vice president.
"The question was whether to affiliate or to purchase" an
international investment operation, he said.</p>
<p>The big insurer began its money-management venture with CS
First Boston this year by contributing assets and money from
Metropolitan Life's own pension fund. The venture currently
oversees about $150 million in Metropolitan Life money, with
that total expected to rise to $215 million by year end, Mr.
Putt said.</p>
<p>The first two products offered to U.S. pension funds will
be pooled funds for international stocks and bonds. MetLife
owns 45% of the joint venture. CS First Boston, in which
MetLife holds about a 10% stake, and CS First Boston's parent
company own the rest of the venture. CS First Boston is the
parent of the U.S. brokerage firm First Boston Corp.</p>
