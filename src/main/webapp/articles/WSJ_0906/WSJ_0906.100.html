	<p class="article-leader">COLLEGE PARK, Md. -- Eugene L. Roberts Jr., who retired
recently as executive editor of the Philadelphia Inquirer,
accepted an appointment as a tenured professor in the
University of Maryland's College of Journalism.
   Mr. Roberts, 58 years old, headed the Inquirer's news
operations for 18 years, a period during which the paper won
17 Pulitzer Prizes and achieved dominance in its market.
Before joining the Inquirer, he had been a Vietnam war
correspondent and national news editor for the New York
Times.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>He will join the journalism faculty at College Park in
September 1991, teaching courses in such subjects as newsroom
management, reporting, editing and journalism ethics. While
at the university, he is expected to remain a consultant to
Miami-based Knight-Ridder Inc., which owns the Inquirer.</p>
<p>Reese Cleghorn, dean of the college, said Mr. Roberts also
will become a senior editor of Washington Journalism Review,
a national monthly with a circulation of 30,000 that is owned
by the college, and he will be involved in developing various
"international initiatives" for the school.</p>
<p>Journalism and communications schools at other
universities, including Stanford, Columbia and North
Carolina, also tried to recruit Mr. Roberts.</p>
