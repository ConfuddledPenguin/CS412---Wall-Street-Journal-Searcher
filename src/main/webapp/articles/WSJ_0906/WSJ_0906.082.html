	<p class="article-leader">CHICAGO -- The Chicago Mercantile Exchange proposed
tightening a so-called circuit-breaker rule limiting the
one-day moves in its Standard & Poor's 500-stock index
futures contract.
   Under the proposal, trading would be halted after the
contract moved up or down 20 points, instead of the current
30-point limit. The futures exchange said other
circuit-breaker rules for the contract would remain as they
are now. The rules are intended to reduce market volatility.</p>

Commission.</p>
