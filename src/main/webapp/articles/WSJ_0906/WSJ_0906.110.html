	<p class="article-leader">G-III Apparel Group Ltd., New York, said it expects to
post per-share earnings of $1.70 to $1.80 for the fiscal year
ended July 31.
   Although the maker of leather apparel said the estimate
would represent an increase of 30% to 40% from the
year-earlier's $1.28 a share, it would be below the range of
$1.85 to $1.95 it estimated last week. Average weighted
shares outstanding rose about 20% in fiscal 1990.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>In national over-the-counter trading yesterday, G-III
Apparel's shares closed at $6.75, down 16%, or $1.25.</p>
<p>Morris Goldfarb, president and chief executive officer,
said profitability was lower than expected because of
"pressures in the retailing environment" that affected the
company's profit margins. Officials added that the earlier
estimate was given before the company had all the figures.</p>
<p>Mr. Goldfarb said the company was "encouraged" by sales so
far in the fiscal 1991 first quarter.</p>
<p>The company also estimated sales for the year rose 64% to
about $162 million from $99 million a year earlier.</p>
