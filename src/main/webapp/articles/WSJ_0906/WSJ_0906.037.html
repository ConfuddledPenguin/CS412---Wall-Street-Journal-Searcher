	<p class="article-leader">Manhattan wine merchant Michael Aaron has been through a
Bordeaux buying frenzy before. But after selling out of
Chateau Petrus -- at $3,000 for a 12-bottle case -- he
declares, "I've never seen anything like this."
   George Schaefer's Skokie, Ill., wine store also ran out of
the coveted 1989 Petrus, at $208 a bottle. Demand was so hot
that the store had to limit sales to three bottles per
customer. Customers begged to pay more if Mr. Schaefer would
let them buy extra bottles.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Few if any of these panting customers have ever tasted the
wine they're buying. It hasn't even been bottled yet. But
with members of the trade calling the 1989 Bordeaux "the
vintage of the century," many wine drinkers are convinced the
wine's cost is only going to grow and bottles will only
become more scarce. So instead of waiting for the new
Bordeaux to reach retailers -- it won't be available until
1992 -- they're buying so-called wine futures that reserve
them a supply at today's prices.</p>
<p>Trouble is, wines of the century are proliferating. Most
experts agree that technical improvements in wine making
helped Bordeaux produce some excellent wine in the 1980s. But
as some see it, this only led to a feast of hype and
hyperbole.</p>
<p>In the 1980s, more than ever, vintners leaped to say that
one vintage after another was among the finest. To many
authorities, claims that the 1989 Bordeaux is yet another
vintage of the century are wearing as thin as grape skin.</p>
<p>"It's been another case of hysteria," says Stephen Tanzer,
editor of the New York Wine Cellar, a wine journal. "They
were trumpeting this vintage before the grapes were picked."</p>
<p>Adds Paul Gillette, publisher of the Wine Investor, a Los
Angeles newsletter: "It's a shame you can't sell Bordeaux
futures short, because I'd be shorting these."</p>
<p>Major wine merchants started offering futures in the 1950s
to allow wine drinkers to reserve supplies of Burgundies,
California cabernet sauvignon and even some kinds of port and
Champagne. But the practice is most popular in Bordeaux,
which produces more fine wine than any other region in the
world.</p>
<p>California wine makers, who say 1989 will be a great year
for them, too, watch the Bordeaux futures market with
undisguised envy. Chuck Wagner, general manager of Caymus
Vineyards in Napa Valley, says his best wine, which sells
wholesale for $50 a bottle, already is expensive by
California standards. But, he adds, "If you're asking me
would I like to sell it for $200, I'd say hell yes."</p>
<p>How intense is the market for '89 Bordeaux? At the Wine
Merchant in Beverly Hills, Calif., which allowed unlimited
purchases, a customer bought $120,000 worth of futures and
wired the money from a Swiss bank account. Another man
purchased 18 cases, rented storage space from the merchant
for 12 years and left instructions that no one touch the wine
until the 21st birthday of his nine-year-old son. The better
wines, which take years to mature, might be ready to drink by
then.</p>
<p>Chicago lawyer Tony Ponzio, an experienced collector with
more than 1,000 bottles in his cellar, bought three cases of
'89 when futures were first offered in the spring. Since
then, prices have risen as much as 30%. "I'm unsettled by the
high prices," he says, but he quickly adds: "I'll probably
buy some more right now."</p>
<p>Headiness over the new Bordeaux began to build last summer
with news that the region was enjoying hot, dry and sunny
weather -- ideal grape-growing conditions. Then in the
spring, following the annual tasting, word started to spread
that the wine was truly great.</p>
<p>On the cover of its April 30 issue, the Wine Spectator, a
full-color tabloid, asked, "1989 Bordeaux: Vintage of the
Century?" And a respected French magazine, Cuisine and Wine
of France, answered the question by reporting that nine of 22
Bordeaux wine makers agreed in a survey that it was.</p>
<p>America's most influential wine critic, Robert Parker Jr.,
doesn't go that far. In an interview, he calls the new
Bordeaux "probably one of the three best vintages since the
'61." In his sober-looking newsletter, the Wine Advocate,
wines from 38 chateaux received a score of 90 or higher on a
scale of 100.</p>
<p>Mr. Parker wrote that the Chateau Haut-Brion, whose
proprietor claimed to have made his best wine since 1959, is
"one of the most profound Haut-Brions I have ever tasted." He
agreed with the owner of Chateau Petrus that his 1989 rivaled
his 1947. He declared the Chateau Le Gay "staggering."</p>
<p>In a rare recommendation, Mr. Parker advised readers to
buy futures to avoid likely price increases.</p>
<p>In May, he predicted that the price of first growths --
wine from such premier chateaux as Lafite-Rothschild,
Mouton-Rothschild, Latour and Margaux -- would rise 60% in
two years. Other top 1989s, Mr. Parker wrote, would rise up
to 50% in the next 12 to 18 months.</p>
<p>Since then, even Mr. Parker has been surprised by the
prices. He calls the current price for Petrus
"reprehensible." At this point, he doesn't expect prices for
first growths to rise more than an additional 20% in the next
two years.</p>
<p>Mr. Parker had suggested buying futures only once before,
in the spring of 1983, after tasting the 1982 vintage. That
helped set off a Bordeaux frenzy back then. The wine
developed so well that the recommendation helped make Mr.
Parker's career.</p>
<p>But his prognostication also fostered a battle of
superlatives among wine critics. "Robert Parker made his fame
taking a strong stand on the 1982," says Claude Kolm, owner
of the Fine Wine Review, a San Francisco newsletter. "The
result is that every year now people try to duplicate what he
did."</p>
<p>At the same time that such reviews took hold, news emerged
that Bordeaux planned to cut allocations to U.S. importers by
a fifth. Never mind that the 1989 harvest was one of the
biggest ever.</p>
<p>Growing demand among wine drinkers in Europe and Japan
accounted for some of the cutbacks. But wine experts say
chateau owners, who always keep some of their production in
reserve, initially held back more in order to test market
reaction to higher prices -- or, some people speculate, to
help drive prices higher. "The Bordelais, being very
perceptive and shrewd marketers, have really played on this,"
says Mr. Kolm of the Fine Wine Review.</p>
<p>With shortages of the highly publicized Bordeaux looming,
U.S. distributors scrambled to lock in supplies. Determining
prices was difficult: Various chateau owners released their
prices at various times over a three-month period beginning
in late February.</p>
<p>Importers say wine from the best properties cost, on
average, about 30% more than 1988, an outstanding year in its
own right. Only about half of the increase resulted from the
falling value of the U.S. dollar.</p>
<p>In normal years, importers have time to consider offers
when wine brokers known as negociants call. But the new
vintage was going so fast that importers sometimes had only a
day to decide.</p>
<p>The race among merchants to snap up the new wine was
equally hectic. "With a vintage that's been hyped like this
one, we started getting calls from retailers around the
country before we even knew the prices," says Richard
Carretta, an executive vice president at William Grant &
Sons, an Edison, N.J., wine importer. "I've never had that
happen in my life."</p>
<p>Mr. Carretta says some major retailers even offered to pay
a 5% premium over the asking price, no matter what the price
turned out to be, to be sure their stores were stocked.</p>
<p>At the retail level, the price of Bordeaux futures has
soared. In Manhattan, the New York Wine Cellar's Mr. Tanzer
says, first growths that came out in late April at $800 a
case are now selling -- if they haven't sold out -- for up to
$1,000. "I was offered Petrus at $2,200 that I suspect is
close to $4,000 now," he says.</p>
<p>In some instances, the 1989 Bordeaux is selling for more
than even a proven vintage. The 1989 Chateau La Conseillante,
which Mr. Parker predicted to be "the finest La Conseillante
since the 1949," sold in August for $60 to $70 a bottle. A
bottle of the 1982 vintage, on the shelf and ready to drink,
can be purchased for $50.</p>
<p>Some retailers have justified the increases with a
now-or-never marketing approach. In a full-page advertisement
in the New York Times, Zachys Wine and Liquor in Scarsdale,
N.Y., touts "The Great Bordeaux of 1989" and says: "First
offerings of '89s are being instantaneously snapped up and in
some of the more sought after Bordeaux there is a frenzy in
the bidding."</p>
<p>But the store's ad director, Robert Chapman, says, "I
don't think it's a market to buy Bordeaux futures. The '89s
are spotty. They're good wines but they're not that great."</p>
<p>Other merchants are adamant that the wine is worth it.
"Based on the quality, I think the prices are justified,"
Sherry-Lehmann Inc.'s Mr. Aaron says. "By the way, we are
going to be raising some of these prices in October."</p>
<p>That probably won't slow demand, much of which seems to be
driven by firsttime buyers. Mark Golodetz, a writer for Wine
Times magazine in Pleasantville, N.Y., estimates that
newcomers account for one-quarter of the demand for Bordeaux
futures. Jim Arsenault, a Washington wine merchant, says,
"We've had first-time buyers spend $20,000 and up."</p>
<p>Carl Gebuhr, a Michigan cardiologist, read about the new
vintage, talked it over with a local wine merchant and
reserved four cases of less expensive '89s for $1,000 -- the
most he has ever spent on wine at one time. Dr. Gebuhr says
he isn't a wine collector and probably couldn't tell the
difference between '89 and other good vintages, but says: "If
it lives up to the hype, I'm probably going to save some
money."</p>
<p>The image of unsophisticated buyers pushing wine prices to
unprecedented heights -- in a market already full of a
decade's worth of good wine that often costs less -- has led
inevitably to talk of a Bordeaux futures crash. It has
happened before, in the early 1970s, leaving thousands of
customers losing money when they thought they were saving it.</p>
<p>Abdallah Simon, chairman of Seagram's Chateau & Estate
Wines Co. in New York, a large Bordeaux importer, says the
market "has absorbed the '89 vintage at the highest level of
prices we've ever experienced." But he adds, "There's got to
be some point at which people will not pay more."</p>
<p>What's a wine drinker to do in such an environment? Roman
Weil, a wine collector and business professor at the
University of Chicago, says it may depend on whether you are
a "wine drinker," who cares mainly about taste, or a "wine
fondler," who "admires the label and gets a big kick out of
drinking the best."</p>
<p>"If you're a wine fondler, you're going to want some '89,"
Mr. Weil says. "If you're a wine drinker -- if you just want
wine that tastes good -- my first advice is this: Buy '88
Burgundy."</p>
