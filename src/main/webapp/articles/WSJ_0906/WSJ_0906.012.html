	<p class="article-leader">CAMDEN, N.J. -- Campbell Soup Co. reported a fiscal
fourth-quarter loss of $238.4 million, or $1.84 a share,
reflecting hefty charges for its expanded program of
divestitures and restructuring.
   In May, the maker of canned soups and other foods put up
for sale some of its least profitable foreign operations,
conceding that those businesses couldn't deliver adequate
returns. At the time, the company said it expected to record
a one-time charge of about $55 million, or 43 cents a share,
against earnings for its fourth quarter, which ended July 29.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>In early July, Campbell expanded the restructuring effort,
putting several North American businesses on the block and
targeting three plants for closing. The additional moves
resulted in a charge of $247 million, or about $1.90 a share.</p>
<p>Yesterday, Campbell said the aggregate after-tax charges
were $301.6 million, or $2.33 a share, matching the amounts
outlined in the earlier announcements.</p>
<p>In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange,
Campbell shares closed at $49.25, down 50 cents.</p>
<p>In the year-earlier fourth quarter, Campbell had a net
loss of $194.7 million, or $1.51 a share, including one-time
restructuring charges of $261 million, or $2.02 a share.
Fourth-quarter sales increased 11% to $1.44 billion from $1.3
billion.</p>
<p>David W. Johnson, who arrived in January from Gerber
Products Co. to become president and chief executive officer,
praised Campbell's domestic divisions for strong performance.
He said there were "solid volume increases" in frozen
seafood, ready-to-serve soups, frozen breakfast products and
spaghetti sauces.</p>
<p>But he said overseas operations "continued to be
disappointing." His remarks omitted the fact that Campbell's
international operating earnings in the third quarter
actually rose 45% to $16.7 million. Moreover, even excluding
the one-time charges, the company's fourth-quarter earnings
were down about 4%.</p>
<p>John M. McMillin, a food-industry analyst at
Prudential-Bache Securities Inc., said he suspects Mr.
Johnson is "finding the turnaround more difficult at Campbell
than it was at Gerber." Mr. McMillin said Mr. Johnson has
"sorted out the mess" at Campbell but hasn't "gotten rid of
the mess yet," alluding in particular to overseas businesses
that haven't been sold or revitalized.</p>
<p>For the year, Campbell said net income was $4.4 million,
or three cents a share. In fiscal 1989, Campbell earned $13.1
million, or 10 cents a share, after restructuring charges.
Excluding the one-time charges for both years, Campbell said,
per-share profit rose 11% in the latest full year. Sales
gained 9.4% to $6.2 billion from $5.67 billion.</p>
