	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- A Delaware law that was expected to permit
big banks to underwrite and sell insurance nationwide was
effectively crippled by the Federal Reserve Board.
   The Fed decision, in response to a challenge to the law by
a coalition of insurance trade groups, specifically curtails
insurance activities by a Citicorp unit, Family Guardian Life
Insurance Co. But the decision also will make it impossible
for other banks to take advantage of the law, banking trade
group officials said.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"This essentially ends the effectiveness of the Delaware
law," said Edward Yingling, a top official of the American
Bankers Association.</p>
<p>Big banks have been hungering in recent years to get into
the insurance underwriting and sales business but have been
unsuccessful in their attempts to win that power from
Congress, though a few states allow a small number of banks
to underwrite insurance.</p>
<p>The Delaware law, passed in May, appeared to open the door
for big New York and regional banks to underwrite insurance
nationwide through state-chartered subsidiary banks in
Delaware. Citicorp had already moved to underwrite insurance
through Family Guardian, and Chase Manhattan Corp. had
indicated it intended to take advantage of the new law.</p>
<p>The law brought a worried response from some members of
Congress concerned about states moving to expand bank powers
in the wake of the $150 billion savings-and-loan crisis,
which some have attributed partly to the expanded powers of
state-chartered thrifts. And the Federal Deposit Insurance
Corp., which insures the banking industry, indicated several
weeks ago that it would likely move to curtail some of the
activities allowed by the Delaware statute.</p>
<p>The Fed regulates bank holding companies, and the framers
of the Delaware law believed they had gotten around the Fed's
restrictions on insurance underwriting by allowing insurance
operations within the state-chartered bank subsidiary of the
holding company.</p>
<p>But in its decision, the Fed said it ordered Family
Guardian to stop the underwriting activities because the
Delaware law created so many so-called firewalls -- such as a
rule that the insurance activities be kept separate from the
banking operations -- that "the practical effect" was to
"treat the insurance division as a separate corporate
entity." Under federal banking laws, the Fed allows
subsidiaries to undertake the insurance activities only if
the state law allows the banks to run the insurance business
legally as part of the bank.</p>
<p>"It's ironic that the basis for the decision is that the
Delaware law had too many firewalls to protect the bank,"
said Mr. Yingling, adding that he expected the Fed decision
would be challenged in court, by individual banks or by the
ABA.</p>
<p>Citicorp officials couldn't be reached to comment after
the Fed released its decision late yesterday.</p>
