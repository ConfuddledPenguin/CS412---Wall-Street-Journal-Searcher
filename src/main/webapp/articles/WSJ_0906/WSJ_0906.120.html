	<p class="article-leader">A SOUTH AMERICAN FORTUNE</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Fifteen years after the death of her Argentine husband in
Venezuela, a 51-year-old Uruguayan widow learned he had left
her a $100 million estate.</p>
<p>"God has given me everything," Teresita Semperena told
Uruguayan television from her modest house in the rural town
of Minas. In Montevideo, the Venezuelan Embassy said the
widow would soon travel to Caracas to take charge of the
estate of her deceased husband, Juan de Anchorena.</p>
<p>Ms. Semperena said she married Mr. Anchorena, a member of
a prominent Argentine family, in 1963 after they met in
Montevideo. They moved to Venezuela where they led a lavish
life for 12 years until Mr. Anchorena died. Ms. Semperena
said she then returned to Uruguay and never had enough money
to return to Venezuela to find out about her husband's
estate.</p>
<p>Ms. Semperena said she would distribute most of her
inheritance among relatives and charities, keeping just
enough "for a nice house and a motor car."</p>
<p>AUSTRALIA'S `ECONOMIC VANDALISM'</p>
<p>An Australian government minister said the nation's
investment managers were "underscrutinized" and were
"accessories" to "economic vandalism" in the 1980s. Industry
Minister John Button, addressing a business conference, said
the nation's capital markets still are performing poorly and
this is an obstacle to economic progress. "In the 1980s, many
of those who decided where our scarce capital was invested
were dazzled by our entrepreneurs who preferred debt-driven
corporate strategies to equity in real activity," he said.

<p>HELMUT KOHL'S PLANS</p>
<p>West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl plans to add four East
German officials to his cabinet to help him govern what is
now East Germany between the Oct. 3 unity date and all-German
elections scheduled for Dec 2. Government sources said the
four East Germans would be ministers without portfolio. They
said the top candidates are East German Prime Minister Lothar
de Maiziere; Guenther Krause, Mr. de Maiziere's leading unity
negotiator; Sabine Bergmann-Pohl, president of the East
German parliament; and Rainer Ortleb, head of the East German
Free Democrats.</p>
<p>JAPANESE TV PROGRAM</p>
<p>Japan Broadcasting Corp. reportedly will begin
broadcasting an English-language television economic-news
program in the U.S. and Europe on Oct. 8. A Japanese news
agency said "Japan Business Today" would be shown in the U.S.
on FNN from 5:30 a.m. to 6:00 a.m. EST, Monday through
Friday. The program will air in Europe on Super Channel, a
London-based cable-TV channel.</p>
<p>IRISH EMIGRATION DECLINES</p>
<p>Emigration from Ireland has dropped after a decade in
which 6% of the population left in search of work. Official
statistics show emigration down to 31,000 people in the year
ended in mid-April from a peak of 46,000 the year before.
Total net emigration in the 1980s was 216,000. Analysts
attribute the decline to dimmer job prospects in Britain and
predictions that Ireland's unemployment rate soon will fall
from its current 17.5% level.</p>
<p>ROBUST YEAR FOR FRENCH TOURISM</p>
<p>France's Tourism Minister Jean-Michel Baylet, using early
figures, predicted more than 44 million visitors this year, a
jump of more than one million from 1989, when the
Revolutionary Bicentennial celebrations drew record crowds.
Despite the falling dollar, the number of U.S. tourists is
expected to rise 10% to 2.75 million in 1990. The increase is
also fueled by an expected 5% jump in West German visitors to
9.6 million and an 8% rise in English tourists to 8.4
million.</p>
<p>POLAND'S NUCLEAR-ENERGY PLANS</p>
<p>Poland postponed plans for a switch to nuclear energy
until the end of the century and halted work on its first
nuclear-power plant.</p>
<p>The government voted heavily to scrap the nuclear-power
station at Zarnowiec, near the Baltic port of Gdansk, which
has been under construction since 1982. The official news
agency PAP said ministers agreed it would cost more to finish
Zarnowiec, originally scheduled to start up this year, than
to build an equivalent conventional plant.</p>
<p>The decision to shelve plans for a nuclear-energy program
until the year 2000 followed years of intense debate. Poland
faces a mounting energy shortage and has suffered enormous
ecological damage from its coal-burning power stations.</p>
<p>Plans drawn up under the former communist government
provided for construction of nuclear plants supplying 7,860
megawatts by the year 2000 and 28,000 megawatts by the year
2020.</p>
<p>POSTSCRIPTS . . .</p>
<p>In Abu Dhabi, the wife of the ruler of the United Arab
Emirates paid $2.7 million for a plate of Kuwaiti dumplings.
Shaika Fatima, wife of President Sheik Zaid bin Sultan
al-Nahayan, bought the food at a charity event to raise money
for Kuwaiti families displaced by Iraq's invasion. . . . An
Australian sailor who failed to return to his ship when it
sailed last month from Perth for the Persian Gulf said he
decided to stay ashore after viewing television scenes of
President Bush playing golf. The seaman, 23-year-old Terry
Jones, was charged in Sydney yesterday with being absent
without leave.</p>
