	<p class="article-leader">BELLWOOD, Ill. -- Sanford Corp. said its board approved
the buy-back of as many as 1.5 million of its 14.8 million
common shares.
   The maker of pens and other office and school supplies
said the stock purchases would be made in the open market or
in privately negotiated transactions over the next 18 months.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Henry Pearsall, chairman and chief executive officer, said
the decision was made because "it looks like the best place
to put our money." In national over-the-counter trading
yesterday, Sanford's stock rose 50 cents a share to $18.50.</p>
