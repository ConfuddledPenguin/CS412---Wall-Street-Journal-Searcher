	<p class="article-leader">These would seem like heady days for McDonnell Douglas
Corp., what with the company's F-15 and F/A-18 jet fighters
and Apache attack helicopters soaring off to defend the
U.S.'s Middle East allies.
   Ever since Iraq swept into Kuwait, the talk of the
aerospace industry has been how the nation's top Pentagon
contractor is likely to benefit from the crisis, winning new
orders for its aircraft and finding additional support for
its new C-17 military cargo plane.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>But the battle McDonnell Douglas remains most concerned
about is right in Long Beach, Calif., where it makes
commercial jetliners. There, the enemies are shop-floor
inefficiency and poor morale.</p>
<p>Consider the plight of Tyee Aircraft Inc., which has tried
in vain to deliver thousands of metal tubes to McDonnell
Douglas's airliner factory for the past five months. Because
paperwork is being held up in the company's Byzantine
purchasing system, it won't accept the shipment.</p>
<p>"My people are frustrated," says Tom Unger, Tyee
Aircraft's president. "McDonnell Douglas has stacks of paper,
and they don't know how to manage them. The normal turnaround
on this should be four to six weeks." Meanwhile, $60,000
worth of parts gather dust in Tyee's Everett, Wash.,
warehouse.</p>
<p>So it goes more than 18 months into the "total quality"
revolution at McDonnell Douglas.</p>
<p>Sparked by Chairman John McDonnell, the reorganization
aimed to produce aircraft at a reduced cost by getting the
rank and file more involved in decision-making and
eliminating snags on the assembly line. The streamlining also
was intended to improve communication between engineers and
assemblers, marketers and planners -- "to end the
finger-pointing and frustration caused by lack of authority
and accountability," in the words of one internal memo.</p>
<p>Just the opposite has happened.</p>
<p>Miscalculations about how long it would take to install
the new arrangement have left many workers discouraged and
confused. Misjudgments about how many new projects could be
taken on at once has led to overload. And a recent hiring
boom has created lots of overlapping functions.</p>
<p>"Management is going to have to get the hourly workers
back on their side," says Richard Rios, president of the
United Auto Workers local that represents about 20,000
personnel in Long Beach. "They've lost their respect for the
company."</p>
<p>Few are willing to write off McDonnell Douglas. "On a
scale of one to 10, they are not Chapter 11," asserts Cyrus
J. Lawrence Inc. analyst Howard Rubel.</p>
<p>Indeed, management just asks for a little patience. Mr.
McDonnell, the son of the aerospace company's founder,
insists that McDonnell Douglas is now in a position to trim
$700 million annually from its cost structure, an amount
translating to a bottom-line gain of $12 a share. "We are in
the process of turning things around," he says in a rare
interview. The cost-saving plan, Mr. McDonnell says, will
"put this corporation on very solid footing."</p>
<p>But many see a more treacherous path ahead. The company's
announcement in July that it will pare as many as 17,000 jobs
by year end -- 13% of its work force -- is strong evidence to
some that cracks have developed in the foundation of
McDonnell Douglas's rebuilding strategy. Should the fissure
widen, it could dash Mr. McDonnell's plans to have the strong
commercial airliner market cushion the downturn in defense
spending, which is still expected despite the rattling of
Saddam Hussein's saber.</p>
<p>A senior executive at one big McDonnell Douglas customer
says airlines have begun seeking assurances that the Long
Beach plant will be able to turn out on time the aircraft
they have ordered. The acid test, he says, will come during
the next four months, when the new MD-11 jetliner is to be
certified by federal authorities, and the first deliveries
made. If McDonnell Douglas "can get their credibilty back
with the MD-11, the airlines will support the company," he
adds. "If not, it's a downward spiral." Just this week, at
the aerospace industry's big show in Farnborough, England,
the general manager of the MD-11 declared that the program is
on track and that "no show-stoppers" have been encountered
during extensive evaluations of the plane's performance.</p>
<p>Michael Durham, chief financial officer for American
Airlines's parent, AMR Corp, says he is confident that, "in
the long run, McDonnell Douglas will emerge a healthy
corporation" because "every company that has tried to change
itself -- and that includes us -- has gone through some
wrenching times." Nonetheless, American officials are openly
upset that the three-engine MD-11 is burning more fuel than
expected during tests, saying it could cost the carrier $7.3
million a year in lost cargo capacity. McDonnell Douglas and
engine maker General Electric Co. say they're working on a
technical solution.</p>
<p>Yet that sort of fix will be far easier to execute than
restoring McDonnell Douglas's esprit de corps.</p>
<p>Sitting over drinks recently at Me 'N' Ed's Pizza Parlor,
a favorite worker hangout in Long Beach, a half-dozen union
members crab that antagonism between labor and management has
grown since the installation of Mr. McDonnell's so-called
Total Quality Management System. One recent directive, for
instance, requires hourly employees to obtain a pass when
leaving the plant other than for a shift change or lunch
break. "I guess we're not to be trusted as much as salaried
people," grumbles mechanic Ed Marshall, a 26-year company
veteran.</p>
<p>"All I want to do is get a full day's work for a full
day's pay," explains John Capellupo, the hard-nosed deputy
president of the Long Beach unit.</p>
<p>Last year, McDonnell Douglas had a $222 million operating
loss at the subsidiary, which other businesses could only
partly offset, creating an overall $37 million operating
loss. Net income, even after a large benefit from an
accounting change, fell 37% from the prior year, to $219
million. The company's return on sales was less than 1%, far
below Mr. McDonnell's goal of 5%.</p>
<p>The MD-11 has caused much of the financial drain, and some
analysts believe debt could balloon to $4 billion next year.
Mr. McDonnell and other top executives have even taken pay
cuts to compensate. Once the company begins to get the $100
million, 350-seat jets to its customers, however, cash flow
will improve greatly.</p>
<p>Earnings have brightened a bit recently, but the company
managed to turn a second-quarter profit of $57 million only
by challenging the government to pay for cost overruns on two
Navy projects, the A-12 attack plane and T-45 trainer. Some
analysts believe this move has only served to delay sizable
write-offs. "We'll prove them wrong," Mr. McDonnell
maintains.</p>
<p>At least some union officials agree the company is on the
right track. Says Bruce Lee, regional UAW director: "There is
definitely some daylight at the end of the tunnel."</p>
<p>But even Mr. Lee sees problems, and he blasts the company
for poor planning. Simply put, McDonnell Douglas tried to
bring too many new programs on line at once: the MD-11, the
MD-90 twin jet and C-17 military transport. As a result,
employment soared to roughly 50,000 this year from a low
point of 15,000 in 1983.</p>
<p>Now come the corrections, which also are causing a furor.
So far, it's the little things that have peeved folks the
most: the snack truck that doesn't come around as often, a
20-minute walk from the parking lot resulting from
scaled-back shuttle-bus service. "It seems like every few
months they throw everybody up in the air and let them come
down again," says Mr. Unger of Tyee Aircraft. The recent,
largely unexplained departure from Long Beach of Joel Smith,
one of the drafters of the total-quality system, has made
observers more skeptical than ever that things will be
patched up quickly.</p>
<p>Without doubt, the clock is ticking, and Mr. McDonnell
agrees that "there is a lot of uncertainty" lingering in Long
Beach. But once the financial picture brightens, he promises,
so will workers' attitudes.</p>
<p>"I still have a strong vision of us becoming the
pre-eminent team of people creating the highest-quality
aerospace products and services," Mr. McDonnell wrote in
"Spirit," the corporate magazine. "To achieve that vision we
must each now be single-minded and performance-driven to
surmount our current challenges.</p>
<p>"We do not have the luxury to take time to mourn our
losses."</p>
