	<p class="article-leader">MOSCOW -- At the hush-hush Kompozit military installation
on the edge of the Soviet capital, Arkady Ratnovsky shows off
a high-tech laser device he designed to cut parts for rocket
motors. But the Soviet missile business isn't the growth
industry it once was. So today, Mr. Ratnovsky's computerized
laser carves ornate wooden mouldings for windows instead.
   The engineer doesn't sound too happy about the change, but
orders are orders. "We don't have a choice," he says.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Mr. Ratnovsky is part of the much-heralded Soviet
"conversion" program. As the Cold War winds down, the Kremlin
is hoping to transform its enormous military sector, which
accounts for a fourth of the nation's output of goods and
services, into a powerful machine that produces badly needed
consumer goods. Following Mikhail Gorbachev's December 1988
pledge at the United Nations to slash military spending,
factories that once made rockets and tanks are now supposed
to churn out everything from saucepans to baby carriages.</p>
<p>But the conversion program isn't turning out to be the
economic panacea that the Kremlin had hoped. Critics contend
that, despite all the optimistic talk, conversion remains
largely windowdressing.</p>
<p>The government initially thought it would be a handy way
to save money and cut the budget deficit. Instead, officials
are discovering they will have to spend huge sums to switch
military factories to civilian production. A government
program under consideration calls for outlays of 40 billion
rubles (about $64 billion) over the next five years to help
cover the costs.</p>
<p>Conversion has had some impact. Military plants boosted
their production of consumer goods by 22% in the first half
of this year. And the Soviet aircraft firm Sukhoi is close to
agreement with the U.S.'s Gulfstream Aerospace to develop a
supersonic executive jet. But the program still has far to go
to alleviate the chronic shortages of goods in Soviet stores.</p>
<p>Critics contend that it is a waste of talent to use highly
skilled defense engineers to mass-produce blenders and
saucepans. The workers, meanwhile, can't get used to keeping
an eye on costs, something they could long ignore. And
because conversion has cut profits, the government has
promised to keep defense workers' salaries from falling. That
will cost it 350 million rubles ($560 million) this year
alone.</p>
<p>Conversion is also hampered by technical difficulties.
Last year, only 23% of the consumer items made by military
industry were up to world standards, Soviet officials say,
dashing the government's hopes of producing top-quality
goods. Mr. Ratnovsky, for example, first tried to use his
laser contraption to make wooden tennis rackets, but the glue
in the plywood caught fire. Cutting window frames fills the
room with smoke, but he appears to have solved the flame
problem.</p>
<p>Vladimir Pylnikov, a manager responsible for coordinating
Kompozit's workshops, chides the government for its naive
hope that conversion would be quick and cheap. "It seemed to
them that they handed over the equipment and on that very
equipment we should make new products," he says.</p>
<p>In fact, the Soviet defense industry has long produced
consumer goods. According to data Soviet officials presented
to a recent U.N.-sponsored conference in Moscow on
conversion, 40% of defense plants also make items for the
civilian economy. Thus defense industries make all Soviet
televisions, video recorders and sewing machines, as well as
most of its vacuum cleaners.</p>
<p>Officials say they want the estimated 1,000 defense plants
to increase civilian production by 50% in the next five
years. But the question of how the program should be
implemented is contentious. State planning officials want to
issue detailed orders to defense factories about what they
should produce. But as the Kremlin seeks to shift away from
strict central planning to a more market-oriented economy,
some consider such an approach outdated. Vsevolod Avduevsky,
an engineer who runs a conversion committee set up by the
Academy of Sciences, wants planners to get out of the
workshops.</p>
<p>"You can't have market reform with 25% of civilian
production by state orders," Mr. Avduevsky says.</p>
<p>As part of the U.N. conference, foreigners were allowed a
rare look inside a defense plant, Kompozit, a 15-minute drive
north of the Soviet capital. In addition to window frames,
Kompozit turns out tubs for gardeners, made with a carbon
composite material once used for the Soviet space shuttle.
But production is hardly high-tech. On the day the foreign
delegation came through, the full shift was four workers
stretching the carbon material over metal frames. Between the
four of them, they manage to make one bin an hour.</p>
<p>"We're used to just producing samples," shrugs plant
director Stanislav Polovnikov.</p>
<p>More critical views were hard to come by. Whenever
visitors struck up conversations with workers, managers
quickly stepped in to make sure they got the official story.
But the Soviet press has been more open.</p>
<p>The weekly New Times reported that the ministry of
aircraft industry, which makes advanced fighters, last year
produced only 21% of the civilian products it was supposed
to. One factory director was quoted as saying that making
electric tea kettles was "too complicated."</p>
<p>At Kompozit, which is primarily a research and development
plant, there are different problems. Engineers here are
supposed to design products using the advanced materials they
originally developed for the Soviet space program, and to
pass the designs on to civilian factories. But Mr. Polovnikov
says civilian factories are far behind their counterparts in
the West and can't cope. "It turns out that they don't have
the competence or the ability to accept our achievements," he
complains. The government says military researchers came up
with 120 innovations for civilian production in 1989, but
only 23 were actually introduced.</p>
<p>One result is that researchers are growing restless; some
are moving to better-paying jobs in private-sector
cooperatives. To stanch the flow, Kompozit built a health
club and a clinic for employees. It is also developing knives
and sausage racks for the meat processing industry -- for
which it hopes to be paid in hot dogs and salami, easing a
shortage of meat that affects even defense-industry workers.</p>
<p>"We can only compete on quality of life," Mr. Pylnikov
says.</p>
