	<p class="article-leader">Minoru Isutani, a Japanese investor and golf-course
developer, has acquired Pebble Beach Co. of Pebble Beach,
Calif., from Miller-Klutznick-Davis-Gray Co., a Denver real
estate partnership anchored by investor Marvin Davis of
Beverly Hills, Calif.
   Terms of the transaction weren't disclosed, but people
familiar with the deal put the price tag in excess of $800
million and possibly as high as $1 billion. The sale includes
the famous Pebble Beach Golf Links; the Lodge at Pebble
Beach; the Inn and Links at Spanish Bay; Spyglass Hill and
Del Monte golf courses; the 17-mile Drive, a well-known
coastal stretch of road in California; and undeveloped real
estate on the Monterey Peninsula.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Thomas A. Oliver, president of Pebble Beach Co., said
several bidders had been interested in the property, and
negotiations with an affiliate of Mr. Isutani's U.S.-based
company, Cosmo World Inc., had gone on for several months.
Mr. Oliver declined to discuss financial details of the
transaction. Calls to Cosmo World's office in Los Angeles
weren't returned, but officials said in a statement that no
changes in management at the property were expected.</p>
<p>Mr. Isutani, who owns several golf courses in Japan, is
developing golf courses and resorts in Los Angeles, Las Vegas
and Hawaii. Cosmo World also owns the Ben Hogan Co. golf
equipment company in Texas.</p>
