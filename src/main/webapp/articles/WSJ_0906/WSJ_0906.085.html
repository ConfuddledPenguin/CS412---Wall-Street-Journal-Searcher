	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Investors drove down the dollar, betting that
the employment report due tomorrow will be bleak enough to
convince the Federal Reserve to ease interest rates.
   The dollar tumbled to 1.5585 marks from 1.5815 Tuesday and
fell to 141.70 yen from 143.50, though trading was light.
Against the yen, the dollar sank to its lowest level since
late December.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Stock and bond prices ended higher after seesawing much of
the day, also in thin trading. Many investors were sitting on
their hands awaiting the jobs report or further developments
in the Mideast. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 14.85
points to 2628.22.</p>
<p>Underlying the renewed bearishness about the dollar is the
growing belief that the U.S. economy is weakening and that
rising oil prices may tip it into recession. The October
futures contract for crude oil rose an additional 65 cents a
barrel to close at $29.77 yesterday, extending Tuesday's
$1.80-a-barrel surge.</p>
<p>Yesterday, some currency and bond traders seized on a
rumor in the morning that the Fed had gotten an early look at
the August employment numbers and that the results were
extremely weak.</p>
<p>In such a thinly traded market, that rumor, which
apparently was unfounded, was enough to help drive down the
dollar and boost bond prices. After a brief lull last week,
the speculation about a Fed easing "hit fever-high peaks
again," said Roberta D. Olson, fixed-income portfolio manager
at Banc One Asset Management, Columbus, Ohio. "It's the only
thing to look at this week."</p>
<p>A Fed move to reduce U.S. interest rates would make the
dollar and dollar-denominated investments less attractive
compared with those in other countriesespecially in Germany
and Japan, where interest rates have been rising.</p>
<p>Graham Spiers, head of currency trading at Travelers
Investment Management, Hartford, Conn., said that the
dollar's drop yesterday began in Japan, with the yen's
firming against several European currencies as well as the
dollar.</p>
<p>Part of what sparked the sell-off there was the failure of
one Japanese firm's large dollar purchase to add much
strength to the dollar, said David Gilmore, senior
foreign-exchange analyst at McCarthy, Crisanti & Maffei.</p>
<p>Mr. Gilmore said the dollar is coming under pressure in
Japan as big institutions there take profits in overseas
markets and convert them into yen to dress up their books for
the first half ending Sept. 30.</p>
<p>Long-term U.S. Treasury bond prices rose a half point, or
$5 for each $1,000 face amount, and "bonds being so strong
had a lot to do with the strength in equities," said Paul
Hennessey, head of equities trading at Boston Co.</p>
<p>Much of the boost in the stock market came from oil
stocks, which headed higher on the continued rise in oil
prices. Chevron, Texaco and Exxon -- all parts of the Dow
Jones Industrial Average -- posted strong gains for the day.</p>
<p>In major market action:</p>
<p>Stock prices rose in light trading. Volume was 120.6
million shares on the New York Stock Exchange, where
advancers outnumbered decliners, 953 to 571.</p>
<p>Bond prices rose. The yield on the Treasury's benchmark
30-year bond eased to 8.96%.</p>
