	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- The dollar slid to a 1990 low against the yen
late yesterday, after Japanese investors set the tone by
selling off the greenback at the start of the global trading
day. The U.S. currency declined sharply against other major
currencies as well.
   U.S. traders cited a widespread expectation that the
Federal Reserve will act as soon as tomorrow to signal an
easing in monetary policy by lowering the target for its
benchmark federal funds rate to 7 3/4% from what is now
thought to be a target of 8%.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The release of U.S. employment data tomorrow is expected
to provide the confirmation of economic weakness that the Fed
needs to ease credit, observers said.</p>
<p>Late in the New York trading day, the dollar was changing
hands at 141.70 yen, below 143.50 yen in New York late
Tuesday. The dollar hasn't closed below 142 yen in New York
since Dec. 26, 1989, when it was at 141.85 yen.</p>
<p>Against the mark, the dollar was quoted at 1.5585 marks,
down from 1.5815 marks late Tuesday in New York. Sterling was
trading at $1.9043, up from $1.8790.</p>
<p>In early trading in Tokyo Thursday, the dollar was quoted
at 141.85 yen, down from 142.30 yen at the close there
Wednesday. Meanwhile, the U.S. currency was trading at about
1.5612 marks, down from Wednesday's Tokyo close of 1.5688
marks.</p>
<p>The fed funds rate is the rate banks charge one another on
overnight loans and is the most sensitive indicator of the
direction of U.S. interest rates.</p>
<p>Several analysts and traders said the expectation of the
Fed's easing was only one of the factors behind the dollar's
slide.</p>
<p>David Gilmore, foreign-exchange analyst at McCarthy,
Crisanti & Maffei in New York, said the dollar's slide began
shortly after a big Japanese investor tried to force the
dollar higher with a huge buy order at 143.00 yen early in
the global day. When the market saw what Mr. Gilmore said was
a billion-dollar order go through with little benefit to the
dollar, it decided to sell the greenback, he said.</p>
<p>After the decline set in, traders looked around and found
the likelihood of the Fed's easing as a plausible explanation
for the day's mood, Mr. Gilmore said.</p>
<p>There are many reasons to sell the dollar, said Kevin
Weir, vice president at Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce in
New York. In addition to the expectation of lower interest
rates, there is the U.S. budget deficit, which is making its
way back into the news after being displaced by the Persian
Gulf crisis, he said.</p>
<p>And the Gulf standoff itself, as it drags on, only
increases the pressure on the federal budget, Mr. Weir said.</p>
<p>"You can't balance the budget at the same time as trying
to fight a war," said Christa Bleyleben, vice president at
Bank of Boston.</p>
<p>The yen strengthened despite another sharp drop in the
Tokyo stock market Wednesday.</p>
<p>U.S. traders said Japanese corporate investors were
repatriating their money in part to improve their earnings
picture at the midway point in their fiscal year.</p>
<p>The consensus among U.S. traders and analysts was that the
Fed would lower the fed funds target rate by 25 basis points
and some speculated that the Fed may even move to lower the
discount rate from its current 7%. The discount rate is the
price the Fed charges on loans to banks.</p>
<p>Mr. Gilmore, at McCarthy-Crisanti, said he expects the Fed
to ease in two stages: first lowering the fed funds target to
7 3/4 by early next week and then by another 25 basis points
after inflation reports are released later this month.</p>
<p>While interest rates in the U.S. are expected to head
lower, those in West Germany and Japan will remain unchanged
or rise, observers said.</p>
<p>In Europe, the dollar fell against major currencies.
Sterling was supported by renewed speculation over its entry
into the exchange rate mechanism of the European Monetary
System.</p>
<p>In Tokyo, traders said increasing bearishness toward the
U.S. currency helped push the dollar below the expected
support level of 142.50 yen. The dollar finished Wednesday at
142.30 yen, well below 144.05 yen late Tuesday in Tokyo.</p>
<p>But traders predicted the dollar is approaching its
near-term lows. They said buying interest below 142 yen
should prove strong.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, on the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for
current delivery settled at $386.10 an ounce, up $2.40.
Estimated volume was a moderate 3.6 million ounces.</p>
<p>In Hong Kong Thursday, gold was quoted at $389.25 an
ounce.</p>
