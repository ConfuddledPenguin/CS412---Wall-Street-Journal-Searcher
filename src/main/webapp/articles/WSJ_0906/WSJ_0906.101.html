	<p class="article-leader">CHICAGO -- Bruce W. Mittelstadt, a 50-year-old
soybean-futures broker, pleaded guilty to one count of mail
fraud and one of commodity fraud, and agreed to testify
against other indicted traders, in return for the government
asking that he receive a lenient sentence.
   Mr. Mittelstadt was charged more than a year ago with
racketeering conspiracy and more than 50 counts of wire fraud
and violating the Commodity Exchange Act. Neither he nor his
attorney, James Montana, could be reached for comment.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>So far, eight of the 19 soybean-futures traders indicted
last year for fraud have pleaded guilty, as have six of the
21 indicted yen-futures traders.</p>
<p>In addition, Martin J. Riley, a yen-futures trader,
pleaded no contest to charges of mail and wire fraud and
violating the Commodity Exchange Act. The plea has the effect
of a guilty plea, except that it can't be used against him as
an admission of guilt in a civil proceeding.</p>
<p>Over the past 10 days, two other traders, one from the
yen-futures pit at the Chicago Mercantile Exchange and one
soybean-futures trader from the Chicago Board of Trade, also
pleaded guilty to reduced charges.</p>
<p>Opening arguments in the trials of the remaining 11
soybean-futures traders and 14 yen-futures traders are
scheduled to begin next week; the trials could last more than
four months.</p>
