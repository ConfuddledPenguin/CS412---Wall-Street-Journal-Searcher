	<p class="article-leader">John Cogan, a senior fellow at the Hoover Institution and
a former deputy director of the Office of Management and
Budget, and Timothy J. Muris, a law professor at George Mason
University and a former executive associate director of OMB,
recently completed a study of domestic discretionary spending
in the 1980s. A summary follows:</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>In the current budget summit, not all spending cuts have
been created equal. Domestic discretionary programs -- these
for which Congress annually appropriates funds -- are widely
felt to be exempt from serious restraint.</p>
<p>This view follows from the conviction that these programs
were deeply slashed during the Reagan years. As Rep. William
Gray (D., Penn.), former chairman of the House Budget
Committee declared: "We've squeezed the fat, the skin and
some of the muscle out of these domestic programs. Now we are
down to the marrow."</p>
<p>But contrary to the prevailing view, budget data reveal
that domestic discretionary spending grew only slightly less
quickly than inflation during the years 1981-89. There was
one year of budget cutting, 1981, followed by seven years of
rapid growth, growth that has accelerated in the 1990s. By
1989, this growth had effectively restored the aggregate
level of non-entitlement domestic spending to its
inflation-adjusted 1981 level.</p>
<p>How could the widely held view that the domestic budget
has been cut viciously be so utterly wrong? One problem is
that the most frequently used measures of government spending
are highly misleading. For example, it is often assumed that
the figures the government shows for "outlays" are the same
as total spending. This is not correct. Outlays are recorded
net of certain payments made to the government from the
public. Worse, outlays are recorded only when a check is
actually issued, not when the government takes on an
obligation. Outlays for many programs, therefore, often occur
years after the programs have been funded.</p>
<p>Another commonly used but misleading indicator is
"appropriated budget authority." In theory, appropriated
budget authority is the amount of money an agency has to
spend on a program. In fact, though, appropriated budget
authority is only one method of financing a program. Other
methods have been used with increasing frequency during the
1980s, to enable Congress to produce the appearance of budget
cutting while the total amount available to spend has been
maintained or increased.</p>
<p>One such method is to require the public to pay a user fee
for a particular government service and to allow the agency
providing the service to use the proceeds to cover a portion
of the agency's cost. By increasing the amount of the fee and
reducing the amount of appropriated budget authority,
Congress can increase the amount of money the agency has to
spend while reducing the agency's budget on the government's
books.</p>
<p>This is what occurred in the Department of Commerce's
Patent and Trademark Office. Application fees were increased
in the early 1980s and the proceeds made available to the
agency to spend. Revenues from the fees rose from zero in
1981 to nearly $100 million in 1989. As a result, the actual
amount the agency had available to spend rose to $201 million
in 1989 from $116 million in 1981. The budget books,
meanwhile, claim a cut in the office's budget authority to
$109 million in 1989 from $116 million in 1981. The office's
outlays show a similar decline, to $108 million in 1989 from
$112 million in 1981.</p>
<p>Another method Congress has found to finance discretionary
programs while concealing their cost is to transfer money
from entitlement programs to discretionary programs. For
example, funds appropriated for the Food Stamp program were
quietly transferred for several years during the 1980s to the
Agriculture Department's Extension Service to finance some of
its activities.</p>
<p>None of the conventional measures of spending accurately
capture the monetary size of subsidized housing programs. In
the Department of Housing and Urban Development's subsidized
housing programs, the government enters into long-term
contracts with landlords to make housing units available for
low-income families at low rents. According to law, the
budget authority for these long-term contracts must be
appropriated on a "full funding" basis -- meaning that the
maximum expected costs of the contract are to be appropriated
before the contract is begun. If the government intends to
pay a $6,000 a year housing subsidy for 10 years, the "full
funding" rule requires the Appropriations Committee to
appropriate not $6,000 but $60,000. The rule is designed to
ensure that the government's full long-term liability is
accounted for when it decides to subsidize housing units.</p>
<p>But the rule has an unfortunate side effect. By shortening
the length of the typical contract, the amount of
appropriated budget authority required to finance any
particular number of housing units can be reduced. The
housing budget can be "cut" while the number of subsidized
housing units is allowed to expand. This is precisely what
happened during the 1980s. Faced with pressures by the Reagan
administration to reduce appropriations, Congress cut the
average length of new contracts in half and continued to
finance additional housing units. Although budget authority
for subsidized housing programs declined by nearly 77% the
number of subsidized units and the number of families living
in these units increased by one-third.</p>
<p>Once official budget data are adjusted to account for all
the various forms of spending, and the misleading impact of
housing programs is eliminated, the true extent of budget
growth is revealed. In the aggregate, spending grew slightly
less than inflation during the 1980s. Discretionary programs
were cut by 14% between 1981 and 1982, but over the next
seven years inflation-adjusted spending grew to eliminate the
impact of the cuts. Although the final results for fiscal
year 1990, which ends September 30, are not yet available,
budget authority alone for that year increased by an amount
about three times the inflation rate. Thus, if measured
through 1990, domestic discretionary spending growth in the
1980s exceeded the rate of inflation. And congressional
action to date would increase spending in 1991 by an even
greater amount than in 1990.</p>
<p>We also collected data on bureau-level spending between
1981 and 1989. (Bureaus are typically administrative units
within agencies or departments, and they usually administer
more than one government program.) The data, presented in the
accompanying table, indicate that the increases in funding
levels in the 1980s were broadbased. Fifteen bureaus with
budgets of $1 billion or more registered inflation-adjusted
increases of at least 20%. These bureaus have responsibility
for a wide spectrum of government activities, ranging from
tax collection to environmental protection. Although much has
been made of the large growth in the defense budget during
the Reagan years, the budgets of the first 13 bureaus listed
in the table grew faster than the Department of Defense's
budget.</p>
<p>Some bureaus did suffer major declines in budgetary
resources. Unlike the increases, the reductions were heavily
concentrated in a few large bureaus, particularly inner-city
job training, energy programs and programs to fund local
development projects for buildings, transit and dams. Just
eight bureaus accounted for 76% of all budget cuts. The
combined value of these cuts was, in today's dollars, some
$26 billion. The rest of the domestic discretionary budget
grew a total of 18%, after inflation, in the 1980s.</p>
<p>Many advocates of increased spending for domestic programs
assert that because total non-entitlement domestic spending
was reduced during the 1980's, some restoration of resources
is in order. This view is wrong. There may be compelling
reasons for budget increases in certain domestic
discretionary programs, but the alleged austerity of the
Reagan years is not one of them.</p>
