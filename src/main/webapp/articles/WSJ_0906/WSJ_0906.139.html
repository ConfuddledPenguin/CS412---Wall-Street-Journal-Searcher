	<p class="article-leader">WHITE PLAINS, N.Y. -- The former president of a Teledyne
Inc. division pleaded guilty to one count of making false
statements to the Defense Department in connection with an
alleged scheme to defraud the Navy on a helicopter contract.
   The ex-president of Teledyne Hydra-Power, 69-year-old
Cirino Giampapa of Massapequa, N.Y., entered the plea in U.S.
District Court here. Also, Morton Baine, 54, of New Rochelle,
N.Y., a former Teledyne Hydra-Power controller, pleaded
guilty to conspiring with others at the division to defraud
the U.S. and to submit false claims to the Defense
Department.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The U.S. Attorney's office in Manhattan said the alleged
scheme involved the submission of fraudulent labor-hour
figures to inflate the prices Teledyne Hydra-Power charged
for parts. The government said the false claims totaled more
than $4.5 million.</p>
<p>Teledyne Hydra-Power is a division of Los Angeles-based
Teledyne Inc., which has diverse manufacturing interests. In
November, Teledyne Inc. agreed to pay the U.S. $11.9 million
to cover the overcharges and penalties.</p>
<p>Mr. Giampapa, who will be sentenced Nov. 14, faces a
possible fine of as much as $10,000 and a maximum prison
sentence of five years. Mr. Baine, whose sentencing is
scheduled for Nov. 8, faces a fine of as much as $250,000 and
five years in prison.</p>
<p>Carl Bernstein, attorney for Mr. Baine, declined comment.
Walter Bonner, Mr. Giampapa's attorney, couldn't be reached.</p>
