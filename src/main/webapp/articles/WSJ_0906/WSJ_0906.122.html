	<p class="article-leader">Seagram Co. reported that net income for the second
quarter ended July 31 rose 3% on a strong performance in the
Montreal distiller's international wines and spirits
business.
   Net was $205 million, or $2.18 a share, compared with $199
million, or $2.07 a share, in the year-earlier period.
Revenue rose 8.7% to $1.42 billion from $1.30 billion.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The earnings reflect a charge, which Seagram declined to
disclose, for 177 job cuts announced in July in the marketing
and sales force of the U.S. distilled-spirits business.</p>
<p>Seagram's Brazilian operations outperformed its
expectations for the period. However, a spokesman said the
company remains "cautious" about the affiliate's operations
for the full year, citing Brazil's volatile economy and the
stringent economic controls the government put in place a few
months ago.</p>
<p>In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday,
Seagram shares fell 37.5 cents to $75.375.</p>
