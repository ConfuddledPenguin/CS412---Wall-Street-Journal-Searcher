	<p class="article-leader">Your Labor Letter regarding the immigration legislation
before Congress (page one, Aug. 14) neglected to mention that
under the Senate proposal, S. 358, many classes of workers no
longer would be able to immigrate legally to the U.S. That
bill eliminates all employer-sponsored immigration of
low-skilled and unskilled workers.
   This will hurt many U.S. businesses and workers.
Restaurants, hotels, poultry-processing plants and other
industries will be hurt. Most severely affected will be
working women, who will find it even harder to find care for
children, elderly and handicapped family members.
Professional women with demanding schedules will be hardest
hit.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Current law is much too restrictive, since employers must
wait more than four years to obtain visas for nonprofessional
employees to fill jobs for which there are no available
American workers. This is hurting American business. The
Senate proposals make the situation worse.</p>
<p>S. 358 and H.R. 4300 must be amended to ensure that
American businesses can obtain the workers they need to carry
on their work.</p>
