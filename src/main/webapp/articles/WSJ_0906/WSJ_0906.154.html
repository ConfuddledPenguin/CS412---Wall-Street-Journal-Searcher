	<p class="article-leader">The Spanish government is pulling out all the stops in its
efforts to find a partner for the troubled truck maker
Empresa Nacional de Autocamiones S.A., or Enasa, owned by the
Spanish state holding company, Instituto Nacional de
Industria.
   Spain has asked the West German government to overrule its
cartel office and approve a takeover bid for Enasa by MAN AG
and Daimler-Benz AG, and has reopened contacts with Fiat
S.P.A. of Italy, officials said. Enasa has chalked up losses
of about seven billion pesetas ($70.8 million) so far this
year, owing to a sales slump caused by uncertainty about the
company's future.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Earlier this year, Bonn's cartel office challenged on
anti-competition grounds plans for MAN to acquire 60% and
Daimler 20% of Enasa. Attempts to find other buyers,
including Fiat, met with failure. If a German solution fails,
Spanish officials said, Enasa's parent will turn again to
Fiat in hopes of negotiating an alternative solution. A Fiat
spokesman said he couldn't comment on such a prospect.</p>
