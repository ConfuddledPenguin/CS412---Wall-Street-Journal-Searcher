	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- The Bush administration appears close to
agreeing to provide Israel with a sophisticated air-defense
system and $400 million in loan guarantees to build housing
for Soviet Jewish emigres.
   Following a meeting at the State Department between
Secretary of State James Baker and Israeli Foreign Minister
David Levy, an Israeli source said that the U.S. promised to
supply Israel with Patriot air-defense missiles from Defense
Department inventories. Israel has asked for the equipment
because of threats by Iraq and because the U.S. recently
agreed to supply Saudi Arabia with over $2 billion in
military equipment.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>In addition, Mr. Baker said "we made good progress" on
working out details for providing the loan guarantees. The
Israeli source said that an agreement in principle was
reached and that details will be worked out in the next few
days.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, the administration held up Israel's
request for the loan guarantees, insisting that Jerusalem
give assurances that they wouldn't be used to build houses in
the occupied territories.</p>
<p>While seeking the support of Arab governments for its
actions against Iraq, the U.S. has asked Israel to maintain a
low profile in the Persian Gulf crisis. Mr. Levy is expected
to meet with President Bush today.</p>
