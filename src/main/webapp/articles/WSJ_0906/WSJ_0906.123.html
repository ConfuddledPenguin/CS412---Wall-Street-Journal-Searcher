	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- As the bipartisan budget talks reconvene
after a monthlong hiatus, differences within and between the
parties appear as great as ever, while projections of the
fiscal 1991 deficit continue to grow.
   President Bush will preside when the talks resume tomorrow
at Andrews Air Force Base in the first of what is scheduled
to be three or four days of negotiations aimed at
accomplishing what the first 12 weeks of talks didn't: a
package of spending cuts and tax increases that both parties
endorse as a way to shrink the federal deficit $50 billion
next year and $500 billion over five years.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Democratic budget negotiators caucused yesterday for the
first time in more than a month, but differences between the
House and Senate persist. Staffers say Democrats are talking
not about a firm deficit-reduction proposal but about
presenting a menu of deficit-reduction options to
Republicans.</p>
<p>White House Chief of Staff John Sununu and Budget Director
Richard Darman, meanwhile, met separately with negotiators
for House Republicans, some of whom have begun calling for a
tax cut to revive the economy even though the administration
is expected to offer its tax-increase plan when the
negotiations resume.</p>
<p>Mr. Darman told Republicans he is projecting the fiscal
1991 deficit will reach a record $250 billion without some
action, up from his estimate of $232 billion two and a half
weeks ago.</p>
<p>Some negotiators predict Congress will have to return
after the election for a lame-duck session. "No doubt about
it," said Sen. Wyche Fowler (D., Ga.), who is Senate Majority
Leader George Mitchell's delegate at the negotiations. But
others, notably House Speaker Thomas Foley (D., Wash.),
dismiss that notion. House Budget Committee Chairman Leon
Panetta (D., Calif.) insists, "We know we can't walk out of
the room without agreement."</p>
<p>Negotiators face intensifying pressure to reach some sort
of agreement this month -- either a substantial
deficit-reduction package or a face-saving accord that delays
any politically painful decisions until after the election or
even until next year.</p>
<p>The weakness in the economy, exacerbated by the spurt in
oil prices, has created a near-crisis atmosphere.</p>
<p>Although several self-imposed deadlines for a resolution
of the budget talks have come and gone, negotiators now
confront some real deadlines. Without a change in the
Gramm-Rudman deficit-reduction law, $85 billion in
across-the-board spending cuts will take effect Oct. 1,
crippling the federal government. At about the same time,
Congress must pass legislation authorizing the Treasury to
borrow money and authorizing the government to spend money in
fiscal 1991. Those bills could serve as a vehicle for either
a deficit-reduction package or a slide-by package to defer
tax rises and spending cuts.</p>
<p>Negotiators from both political parties publicly say they
remain committed to cutting the deficit $50 billion in fiscal
1991 and $500 billion over five years. "We've always been at
50-500 and that's where we'll stay," House Majority Leader
Richard Gephardt (D., Mo.) said after the Democrats' caucus.
And Mr. Darman, arriving for the his session with House
Republicans, said, "We don't see any change in that."</p>
<p>But privately, lawmakers and their aides suggest that the
first-year figure, at least, will erode as much as $25
billion as negotiators respond to the changed military and
economic situation. Central to the deliberations is defense
spending. The Bush administration would shave about $6
billion from projected defense spending while some Democrats
want to cut more than twice that sum. The Iraqi standoff has
undercut support for such deep defense cuts, however. And if
savings from defense shrink, Democrats will demand lower
domestic cuts in turn. Then proposed tax revenues, which
would probably make up half of any package, would also be
lowered. The result is a package adding up to substantially
less than $50 billion.</p>
<p>A faction led by negotiator Newt Gingrich of Georgia, the
House Republican whip, now is arguing that a budget-cutting
package with tax increases could tip the economy into
recession and that tax cuts are needed instead. But others,
such as Rep. Panetta, say that a substantial
deficit-reduction pact is more necessary than ever to send
financial markets a positive signal and encourage the Federal
Reserve to lower interest rates.</p>
<p>The Democrats' menu of options is likely to include an
increase in the top personal income tax rate to at least 33%
from the current 28%, an increase in taxes on alcoholic
beverages and tobacco and perhaps an energy tax of some sort.</p>
<p>The administration, which has criticized Democrats for
failing to offer a deficit-reduction plan before the
congressional recess, is expected to put on the table a
controversial plan of its own that was leaked in July. It
calls for, among other things, an increase in taxes on beer,
wine and liquor as well as a $10,000 ceiling on federal
income-tax deductions for state and local taxes.</p>
