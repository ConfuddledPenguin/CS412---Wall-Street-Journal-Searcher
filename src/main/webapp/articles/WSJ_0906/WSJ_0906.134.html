	<p class="article-leader">Rhone-Poulenc S.A. of France, a pharmaceutical and
chemical concern, said first-half net income fell 13% to 2.18
billion francs ($410.9 million) from 2.49 billion francs a
year earlier. The results are after payments to minority
interests but before priority dividends.
   Operating profit declined 20% to 3.75 billion francs from
4.69 billion francs. Finance charges rose to 1.66 billion
francs from 1.02 billion francs.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Consolidated revenue increased 7.8% to 39.99 billion
francs, but decreased 5.6% on a comparable structural basis.</p>
<p>As in the first quarter, Rhone-Poulenc blamed Brazil's
economic stabilization program and the franc's recent
strength for the company's poor showing. Brazil, which has
imposed austerity measures, represents 7% to 8% of group
revenue.</p>
<p>The company gave no indication that conditions would
improve during the second half, citing "a worsening economic
situation" owing to "the dollar's slide, higher oil prices
and slowing growth."</p>
