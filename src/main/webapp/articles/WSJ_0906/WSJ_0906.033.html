	<p class="article-leader">Peter J. Wallison's call for private deposit insurance is
right on target in citing federal deposit insurance as the
primary source of the S&L debacle (editorial page, Aug. 16).
The institutional arrangement he proposes to replace federal
insurance with, however -- while an improvement on the
current system -- is still a step removed from true market
discipline.
   "Negotiated contractual arrangements" within the banking
system to monitor investment risk and, hence, adjust
private-insurance premiums assume a level of knowledge on the
part of insurers that doesn't exist. The best way to
determine the "risk" in a portfolio is to look at its market
value, which is near impossible to do with cost accounting
and thin-to-nonexistent secondary markets.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Depositor discipline, which Mr. Wallison casually
dismisses, would solve this problem. He argues that
depositors don't consider their money in financial
institutions as "investments." Well, if there were no federal
deposit insurance they'd start looking at those funds as
investments quicker than you could say "incentives matter."
Perhaps they might take their funds out of S&Ls, causing the
industry to disappear. Since the industry itself is a
creature of government, that wouldn't be all bad.</p>
<p>More likely, however, depositor discipline would be based
on a system in which Consumer Report-type organizations would
provide market valuations of the portfolios of these
institutions, thereby informing depositors of the true level
of capital available to protect deposits.</p>
<p>Under such a system financial institutions would be
compelled to disclose the nature of their investments, and
they would end up having to mark to market their portfolios.
This in turn would lead to broad secondary markets in these
investments, hence increasing the liquidity of the
institutions and reducing the likelihood that "runs" could
shut down solvent banks. (That runs would shut down poorly
managed banks should be viewed as a positive aspect of
depositor discipline. The market works where government
regulators don't.)</p>
<p>It is not at all clear that depositors in a true market
system would require insurance at all, federal or private.
They don't in the case of money-market funds, which is what
S&Ls probably would evolve into in any case.</p>

<p>There currently is no private source of deposit insurance
available; we have looked in the past and even the
prestigious and far-reaching Lloyd's has expressed no
interest. To create such a private structure would be a
monumental task. Then it begs the question of who would
regulate the insurer? What if the insurance industry, already
reeling from the impacts of high-yield bonds and falling
real-estate values, fails? Who will bail it out? Are we not
just creating a future problem rather than a solution to the
current problem?</p>
<p>I shudder to think of what would happen to small banks if
such a private insurance case would happen. The private
insurers would want to make the underwriting as efficient as
possible. It would be much easier to assess the risk of a few
institutions than many. The small banks would eventually
disappear.</p>
<p>The idea of a self-insured pool is equally unappealing --
and fallacious. Here Mr. Wallison falls prey to the illusion
presented by big numbers. He cites the 550 largest banks and
thrifts with total capital accounts of $165 billion (I did an
analysis of the 258 largest banks and came up with equity
capital of $121 billion, which means that the thrifts don't
contribute much). What Mr. Wallison doesn't say is that the
seemingly huge capital available (by my analysis of March
1990 data) is only 5.56% of equity, 7.52% primary capital
(includes loan loss reserves) or 8.01% total capital
(includes subordinated debt). Further, the risk capital ratio
is only 8.10%.</p>
<p>The numbers become less important when one also considers
that the 258 largest banks also have 30% of their capital or
2.29% of assets in nonperforming loans, only 1.89% of which
is reserved. A quick and dirty analysis takes the net
available capital of those 258 banks from 5.56% to 5.16%. The
available capital is hardly a comfort -- only five cents of
every dollar available for growth, exigencies and, for Mr.
Wallison, systemic risk sharing. In contrast most small banks
have capital ratios of well over 8% and risk capital of
nearer to 15% -- even after the adjustment for asset quality.
Being insured by Citicorp would do little to calm sleepless
nights.</p>

<p>Private insurance, be it banking syndicates or commercial
insurers, should insure deposits; however, the government
should remain as the insurer for, say, up to $25,000 in
deposits per household.</p>
<p>Remember, the original intent of deposit insurance was to
protect the small depositor from ruin that came with a bank
failure. A combination of commercial insurance and government
insurance (for the small deposits) would allocate risks
efficiently and at a much lower cost to the banking system.
This would make U.S. banks more competitive and remove most
of the expensive bureaucracy and political favoritism
inherent with the current method.</p>
