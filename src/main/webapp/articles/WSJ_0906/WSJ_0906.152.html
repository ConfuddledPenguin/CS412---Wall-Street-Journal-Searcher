	<p class="article-leader">TOKYO -- The Japanese stock market plunge is picking up
speed again.
   Spooked by fears that the settlement of some futures
contracts next week could trigger another massive sell-off on
the stock market, investors dumped stocks. Stock-index
futures -- contracts that obligate holders to buy or sell a
basket of stocks at a set price on a specific date -- fell so
sharply they were suspended from trading.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>In London, shares closed up, but were unable to match the
day's high in a cautious market still crippled by low volume.</p>
<p>Tokyo's Nikkei Index of 225 issues plunged 829.30 points,
or 3.3%, to 24078.34. So far this week, the index has fallen
1900 points, or 7.3%.</p>
<p>In Tokyo Thursday, the Nikkei index shed another 244.89
points to close the morning session at 23833.45.</p>
<p>At one point Wednesday, the indicator fell below the
24000-point level, before recovering on heavy buying by
brokerage firms. Turnover was light at about 380 million
shares, up slightly from Tuesday's 331 million shares.</p>
<p>Alarmed by the market's continuing nose dive, regulators
late Wednesday eased margin requirements to the
lowest-possible legal level. Investors now can buy stock by
putting up collateral equivalent to 30% of the value of the
stock they buy.</p>
<p>Japan's stock market has been battered for more than a
month by worries that Iraq's invasion of Kuwait on Aug. 2
could drive up energy prices in this oil-dependent country,
spurring inflation and forcing authorities to bolster
interest rates. The Bank of Japan raised its benchmark rate
just this past week. "Investors are terrified by the shadow
of creeping interest rates and oil prices," an analyst at
Yamaichi Securities Co. noted.</p>
<p>Wednesday, though, the market was rife with fresh rumors
of trouble. Many suggested that the futures settlement a week
from today could bankrupt some securities firms. The rumors
centered on one firm, Sanyo Securities Co., which is thought
to have a substantial number of unprofitable futures
contracts outstanding. A spokesman for Sanyo confirmed that
it holds some futures positions for its own account, but he
denied that the firm is in financial danger.</p>
<p>Still, traders said they fear that next week could bring
bigger troubles for Tokyo's faltering market.</p>
<p>"There is a big, big danger," said Philippe Baudin,
assistant general manager of options at Societe Generale
Securities Ltd., a French-owned firm. "There is dynamite in
the market."</p>
<p>Kazuto Aizawa, an analyst at Kangyo Kakumaru Securities
Co., said the market is fraught with "investor concern over
the future price outlook, so share prices declined sharply on
small-lot selling."</p>
<p>Individuals who bought shares on credit also contributed
to Wednesday's decline, analysts said. While the amount of
so-called margin borrowing -- loans made to finance stock
purchases -- has declined to 829.55 billion yen ($5.78
billion) as of Aug. 31 from a peak of about 1 trillion yen in
the middle of March, the borrowing remains high in view of
the steep share price decline in the past six months.</p>
<p>Benedicte Ivey, a saleswoman at Credit Lyonnais Securities
Ltd., said stock bought with borrowed money accounts for
2.15% of the Tokyo market's total capitalization -- above the
2% level that "is considered by most as the danger level."</p>
<p>Some experts expect a considerable rise in selling next
week, when the loans backing a large amount of that stock
will come due for payment.</p>
<p>Another factor hurting the market Wednesday was the
approaching end of the fiscal half-year for many
institutional investors. Life insurance companies and trust
banks usually close their books in the days leading up to
Sept. 30. Kimitoshi Hasegawa, a senior fund manger of
Dai-ichi Mutual Life Insurance Co., attributed the stock
market's decline to "internal factors."</p>
<p>In London, Wednesday's disclosure of several company
interim results caused a nervous start to the session as
market expectations for the earnings had been poor. All seven
of the company results were "disappointing" said one trader,
but were still generating trade in the U.K. market.</p>
<p>Thin volume remained a dominant feature, as share prices
ticked better in tandem with the futures market, said one
trader. He added that arbitrage situations were "dragging the
main market up."</p>
<p>The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100 Share Index gained
4.2 points to 2152.2. The Financial Times 30 Share Index
closed up 1.3 points at 1672.2. Volume was a scant 344.9
million shares, above Tuesday's level of 286.2 million
shares.</p>
<p>Among the many company results disclosed, composite
insurer Sun Alliance reported a 38% drop in pretax profit on
the back of increasing storm damage claims. The stock slipped
10 pence to 279 pence (19 cents to $5.25).</p>
<p>B.A.T Industries posted an 11% drop in pretax profit on
losses in its insurance business. Nevertheless, the stock
managed to add 2 pence to 526 pence.</p>
<p>Williams Holdings shed 13 pence to 217 pence. The
construction concern reported a pretax loss of 15% as high
U.K. interest rates dented the consumer and building products
market. Another building products company Wimpey saw pretax
profit fall 72% following a prolonged weakness in the U.K.
housing market. Wimpey closed down 27 pence at 175 pence.</p>
<p>Blue Circle also suffered from depressed housing markets
in the U.K. as well as in the U.S. Pretax profit fell 7.8%
but the stock gained 5 pence to 205 pence.</p>
<p>Also, shares closed slightly higher in Paris, Brussels,
lower in Frankfurt, Madrid and Stockholm, flat in Zurich and
mixed in Amsterdam and Milan. South African gold stocks
closed marginally lower.</p>
<p>And stocks closed lower in Sydney, Hong Kong, Seoul,
Manila, Taipei and Wellington, and were mixed in Singapore.</p>
<p>Here are price trends on the world's major stock markets,
as calculated by Morgan Stanley Capital International
Perspective, Geneva. To make them directly comparable, each
index is based on the close of 1969 equaling 100. The
percentage change is since year-end.</p>
