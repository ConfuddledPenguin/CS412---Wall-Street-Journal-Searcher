	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Stock prices moved higher in another slow
session, as the market managed to shrug off more tough talk
from Iraqi President Saddam Hussein.
   Energy stocks were at the forefront of the advance as
crude-oil prices edged toward $30 a barrel in New York
trading. Some favorable analyst comments provided a boost to
the gas pipeline sector.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The Dow Jones Industrial Average, which skidded to a loss
of nearly 19 points in late morning trading as statements
from the Middle East sparked a brief wave of selling, closed
with a gain of 14.85 at 2628.22.</p>
<p>Among broader indexes, Standard & Poor's 500-Stock Index
gained 1.30 to 324.39, the New York Stock Exchange Composite
Index gained 0.80 to 177.93 and the Dow Jones Equity Market
Index rose 1.10 to 300.35.</p>
<p>New York Stock Exchange volume, which had fallen short of
100 million shares in the two previous sessions and set
successive lows for the year, remained relatively light with
120,610,000 shares changing hands. There were 953 advancing
issues on the Big Board against 571 decliners.</p>
<p>"People are still on tenterhooks with respect to the
Mideast crisis, and there's a large body of people who fear a
long stalemate and don't want to make any {market} moves,"
said Stefan D. Abrams, chief investment strategist at Kidder,
Peabody & Co.</p>
<p>But analysts said the market's ability to recover from its
late-morning sell-off -- which took place as Saddam Hussein
reiterated his call for a "jihad," or holy war, in the
Mideast -- encouraged investors to do some buying.</p>
<p>"The market appears very much sold out," said Jack
Solomon, a technical analyst at Bear, Stearns & Co., noting
that the industrial average has stabilized around the 2600
level over the past week and a half and the "urgent selling"
of recent weeks "seems to be completed."</p>
<p>Meanwhile, only 29.1% of the investment advisers surveyed
last week by the Investors Intelligence service were bullish
on stocks. That percentage was the lowest since December
1988, said Michael Burke, the survey's editor.</p>
<p>By contrast, Investors Intelligence found that 52% of the
market newsletter writers had a bearish opinion of the
market, while 18.9% anticipated a correction in share prices
over the next few weeks.</p>
<p>"People are scared," Mr. Burke said, because of the
potential economic damage from the recent jump in the price
of oil and the potential for even higher oil prices.</p>
<p>Oil stocks rallied as October crude-oil futures closed at
$29.77 a barrel, up 65 cents, in New York trading. Exxon
gained 3/4 to 50 7/8 in composite trading of 1.3 million
shares, while Chevron rose 1 3/4 to 77 5/8, Texaco rose 1 3/4
to 63 3/4, Mobil climbed 1 3/8 to 65 3/4, Amoco advanced 1
1/2 to 57 3/4 and Atlantic Richfield added 3 1/8 to 138 3/4.
Within the oil-services sector, Halliburton gained 1 3/8 to
54 1/2 and Schlumberger rose 1 1/8 to 65 1/8.</p>
<p>Coastal climbed 1 1/4 to 36 3/8 and Enron gained 1/2 to
52, boosted by Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette's positive
comments on the two gas pipeline stocks. Analyst Curt Launer
told Dow Jones Professional Investor Report he expects
Coastal to benefit from a seasonal rise in natural-gas prices
this winter and a new refinery it will open in Aruba later
this year, while Enron is "well positioned" to benefit from
growth in gas demand from California. Enron Oil & Gas,
84%-owned by Enron, jumped 1 3/4 to 25 3/8.</p>
<p>Columbia Gas System, which Mr. Launer singled out along
with Coastal as the best-positioned pipeline companies in the
current environment, added 3/4 to 47. Among other pipeline
stocks, Panhandle Eastern rose 3/4 to 15 1/2, Transco Energy
rose 1 to 44 and Enserch gained 5/8 to 25 5/8.</p>
<p>International Business Machines, which unveiled a new
generation of mainframe computers as expected, eased 1/8 to
102 3/8 on 1.5 million shares. The line, called System 390,
represents IBM's first new mainframe series in five years.</p>
<p>Other key technology issues were widely mixed. Digital
Equipment climbed 1 to 66 1/2 and Cray Research rose 1/2 to
35, while Compaq Computer fell 2 1/2 to 45 3/8,
Hewlett-Packard lost 1 1/8 to 34 3/8 and Motorola slipped 2
to 69 1/8.</p>
<p>United Technologies, whose Otis Elevator unit agreed to
acquire a majority stake in an East German elevator company,
gained 1 5/8 to 50. Terms weren't disclosed. Separately, the
company's Sikorsky Aircraft unit and Korean Air agreed to
work together to produce helicopters for South Korea.</p>
<p>Pinnacle West Capital rebounded 1/2 to 12 7/8 on 1.7
million shares after tumbling 3 3/4 Tuesday in response to an
agreement that ended PacifiCorp's fight to acquire the
company. At a meeting with analysts, Pinnacle West said it
expects to reduce its consolidated debt by $1 billion by the
end of 1993 and restore its common-stock dividend.</p>
<p>Castle & Cooke rose 2 5/8 to 35 5/8. The company scheduled
a news conference to discuss "employee-related matters" amid
speculation that it will phase out pineapple operations on
the Hawaiian island of Lanai and rumors about plans for its
two major businesses, food and real estate.</p>
<p>Mylan Laboratories added 1 1/2 to 18 3/8. Sandoz
Pharmaceutical agreed to promote Eldepryl, a treatment for
Parkinson's disease which is marketed by a joint venture of
Mylan and Bolar Pharmaceutical. Bolar gained 1/2 to 4 3/4 in
American Stock Exchange trading.</p>
<p>U.S. Surgical rallied 3 7/8 to 51 3/4 and traded as high
as 52 1/4, a 52-week high, after favorable comments from
analysts at Dean Witter Reynolds and PaineWebber. Both
analysts cited the company's prospects in laparoscopic
surgery, a new technique that reduces the amount of time
required for doctors to perform operations and for patients
to recover.</p>
<p>Pier 1 Imports, which estimated that it would post net
income of seven or eight cents a share for the second quarter
ended Sept. 1, fell 1/8 to 7 5/8. In the year-earlier period,
its net equaled 20 cents a share. Separately, the company
doubled the size of a stock-repurchase program to four
million shares.</p>
<p>The American Stock Exchange Market Value Index rose 2.67
to 325.41. Volume totaled 10,590,000 shares.</p>
