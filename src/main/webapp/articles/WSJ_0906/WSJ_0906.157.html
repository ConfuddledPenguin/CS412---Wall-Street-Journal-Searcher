	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Investors ignored the Mideast crisis and drove
bond prices higher after car makers reported a sharp decline
in sales of new cars and trucks made in North America.
   The Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond rose 1/2 point, a
gain of $5 for a bond with a $1,000 face value, while the
issue's yield eased to 8.96%.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Junk bonds, which posted the worst performance on record
in August, ended unchanged to slightly higher.</p>
<p>In early trading, the Treasury bond market was essentially
unchanged to modestly higher. But prices rose on news that
sales of North American-made cars and trucks were running at
a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 7.1 million units in
late August, down 21% from the same period a year ago.</p>
<p>The weak report revived concerns that the economy is
nearing a recession and that the Federal Reserve may be
forced soon to reduce interest rates in an effort to
stimulate economic activity.</p>
<p>"After sales figures for General Motors and Chrysler came
out, it became clear that domestic auto sales are not
robust," said Steve Ricchuito, chief economist at Barclays de
Zoete Wedd Securities Inc.</p>
<p>Although Honda Motor Co. and Toyota Motor Corp. posted
strong sales, the market gave more weight to statistics
reported by the Big Three, which were interpreted as a
further sign that U.S. manufacturers are in poor shape.</p>
<p>Market participants paid little attention to Mideast
turmoil or the price of oil yesterday, an abrupt departure
from previous trading sessions. Since Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion
of Kuwait put world-wide oil supplies in jeopardy,
fluctuations in the price of oil and tough talk from Iraqi
leader Saddam Hussein have been the primary focus of the
fixed-income market.</p>
<p>But yesterday, "Saddam was very bellicose again, but the
market tended to look through it," said James Fralick, senior
economist at Morgan Stanley & Co. "People are looking away
from Saddam and the Middle East and back to the real
economy."</p>
<p>The market was also helped as Wall Street traders began
buying long-term bonds in an effort to balance their
portfolios ahead of tomorrow's potentially market-moving
employment report. Many dealers were holding a higher
proportion of shorter-term securities.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Salomon Brothers Inc. reported yesterday that
its junk bond index posted a negative total return of 3.87%
last month, its largest monthly drop on record. Salomon's
high-yield market index tracks 476 issues representing about
$87 billion of securities.</p>
<p>Merrill Lynch & Co., which tracks more than 700 issues
that have a combined face value of more than $104 billion,
said its high-yield index posted a negative total return of
3.83% in August. An analyst at Merrill Lynch said that was
the worst ever and the poorest showing since October 1987,
after the stock market crash, when the index declined 2.6%.</p>
<p>By comparison, the Treasury market posted a negative total
return of about 1%, although long-term Treasury bonds
declined about 5%.</p>
<p>Analysts said the junk market's weak performance reflected
the bond market's losses and a sharp decline in stock prices.
The Standard & Poor's 500 index was down 9% in August, its
worst showing since October 1987.</p>
<p>"The stars have never really been aligned like this in the
high-yield market," said Joseph Bencivenga, director of
high-yield research at Salomon. He said the burgeoning number
of defaults, the conflict in the Middle East and the looming
recession "conspired to make for a very bad August."</p>
<p>Treasury Securities</p>
<p>The Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond ended at 97 22/32,
up from 97 6/32 on Tuesday. Two-year note ended at 100 5/32
to yield 8.02%, compared with 100 3/32 to yield 8.05% on
Tuesday.</p>
<p>Short-term rates fell. The discount rate on three-month
Treasury bills ended at 7.38% for a bond-equivalent yield of
7.60%. The rate on six-month bills ended at 7.31% for a
bond-equivalent yield of 7.67%.</p>
<p>Junk Bonds</p>
<p>News that underwriters at Merrill Lynch & Co. will delay a
$200 million junk-bond offering by Stone Container Corp. was
a mild disappointment for the supply-sparse junk bond market.</p>
<p>The issue would have been one of just handful of such
offering this year. So far in 1990, only five junk bond
issues have come to market, representing $397 million in
high-yield financing, according to Securities Data Co. That
compares with $21.8 billion in new junk bond financing in the
same period last year.</p>
<p>The lack of supply has been a source of concern for buyers
as well as underwriters, whose business has dried up.</p>
<p>Arnold Brookstone, chief financial officer at Stone
Container, said the Chicago-based paper and packaging
products company has postponed its plans for a "road show"
presentation of its senior note issue until market conditions
improve.</p>
<p>In a road show, the company travels around the country
seeking potential investors. Typically, offerings are priced
shortly after the road show circuit ends.</p>
<p>Mr. Brookstone said the recent deterioration in the
high-yield market would have forced the company to offer
investors "significantly" higher rates than it originally
planned.</p>
<p>Municipal Issues</p>
<p>Municipal bonds were unchanged to as much as 1/2 higher in
thin dealings.</p>
<p>More than $295 million in new debt was priced, with the
majority of the deals well received by investors, traders
said.</p>
<p>A Goldman Sachs & Co. group priced $110 million Maine
State Housing Authority single-family mortgage revenue bonds
to yield from 6.40% in 1992 to 8.13% in 2032.</p>
<p>Among active bonds, New Jersey Turnpike Authority's 7.20%
issue due in 2018 was unchanged at 98 1/2 to yield 7.31%.</p>
<p>Mortgage, Asset-Backed Securities</p>
<p>Prices of mortgage securities trended higher in dull
trading.</p>
<p>In the secondary market, 9 1/2% securities for September
delivery issued by Government National Mortgage Association,
Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp. and Federal National
Mortgage Association all rose 6/32 to 98 5/8, 98 5/32 and 98
22/32, respectively.</p>
<p>One trader said activity in conventional mortgages
indicated that a real estate mortgage investment conduit, or
Remic, deal backed by either Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac
securities may be in the offing.</p>
<p>In the asset-backed sector, Valley National Bank of
Arizona offered $300 million of credit-card notes via J.P.
Morgan Securities Inc. The notes, which are collateralized by
Visa and MasterCard receivables, were priced with an 8 7/8%
coupon to yield 8.97%. The notes have an average life of
three years and are rated triple-A by Moody's Investors
Service Inc. and Standard & Poor's Corp.</p>
<p>Foreign Bonds</p>
<p>Three Japanese banks tapped the eurobond market in what
some analysts believe could be the beginning of a flood of
new Japanese subordinated debt issues.</p>
<p>Fuji Bank Ltd., Bank of Tokyo Ltd. and Nippon Credit Bank
Ltd. issued a total of $1.8 billion of subordinated debt,
bringing the total since late June to $3 billion.</p>
<p>Some analysts estimate that half a dozen other Japanese
banks could bring an additional $3 billion to market in the
next three weeks. Among the names rumored are Sanwa Bank
Ltd., Mitsui Taiyo Kobe Bank Ltd. and Mitsubishi Bank Ltd.</p>
<p>In July, Sumitomo Bank Ltd. issued $1 billion of
subordinated debt in the U.S. credit markets and in Europe.
The offering represented the first time that a Japanese bank
issued subordinated debt.</p>
<p>Japanese banks are being forced to raise subordinated debt
to boost their capital, which has been depleted along with
the steep plunge in Japanese share prices. New international
guidelines require banks doing international business to have
capital equal to 8% of their assets, as of March 1993.</p>
<p>Under the guidelines, some of which come into effect as
early as 1991, Japanese banks are allowed to count 45% of the
unrealized gains on their huge holdings in Japanese companies
as capital. Thus, Japanese bank capital has sunk along with
the 38% drop in the Japanese stock prices.</p>
<p>In trading, most eurodollar bonds ended unchanged to 1/8
point higher.</p>
