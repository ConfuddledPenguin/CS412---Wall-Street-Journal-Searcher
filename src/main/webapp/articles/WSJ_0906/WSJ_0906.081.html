	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- The International Trade Commission, ruling
that the U.S. knitwear industry is injured by imports,
authorized the imposition of anti-dumping duties on more than
$1 billion in annual shipments of synthetic-fiber sweaters
from Taiwan, Hong Kong and South Korea.
   The ITC's final ruling will hit the Taiwanese imports
hardest; it authorizes the U.S. Customs Service to collect
additional duties ranging from 21.38% to 24.02% on most of
those shipments. The ruling also will lead to duties of 5.86%
on sweaters from Hong Kong's leading suppliers and of 0.73%
to 3.17% on those from South Korea.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Dumping is defined as selling at prices below the cost of
production or at below the price in the home market. Dumping
duties are designed to offset the allegedly unfair price
advantage that imports have over U.S.-produced ones. The ITC
acted on a petition brought by the National Knitwear &
Sportswear Association, a New York trade group representing
most of the affected U.S. producers.</p>
<p>The ruling isn't expected to have an immediate impact on
department-store prices because most of the imported sweaters
to be sold this winter are already in U.S. warehouses. But
Seth Bodner, executive director of the knitwear association,
predicted that prices will rise beginning in the 1991-1992
season -- unless the Commerce Department finds that the
dumping has ceased. "Some of the Korean producers will have
to either raise their prices in the off-season or accept
higher dumping margins," he said.</p>
<p>Mr. Bodner also predicted that the U.S. government will
compel U.S. importers to be more scrupulous about the origin
of the Asian sweaters they purchase. The Commerce Department
in the course of its investigation looked into charges that
some sweaters shipped as part of Hong Kong's quotas were made
in China.</p>
<p>The ITC vote was 2-1, with Commissioners David Rohr and
Seeley Lodwick finding there was injury to the domestic
industry and Commissioner Don Newquist declaring the opposite
view. Acting ITC Chairman Anne Brunsdale recused herself from
voting on the case.</p>
<p>U.S. apparel importers expressed disappointment with the
ruling. "Imports have filled a void for high-quality fashion
and novelty sweaters; they have not damaged a domestic
industry," said Gail Cumins, counsel to the American
Association of Exporters and Importers' Sweater Group. She
warned that consumers will be the ones hurt because "the
sweaters they want to buy just won't be available at prices
they can afford."</p>
