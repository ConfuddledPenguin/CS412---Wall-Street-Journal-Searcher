	<p class="article-leader">Boise Cascade Corp. agreed to sell its paper mill in
Vancouver, Wash., and certain inventories for $72 million to
Appleton Papers Inc., a unit of the Wiggins Teape Group Ltd.
in London.
   Under terms of the sale, Appleton will pay $60 million for
the mill and $12 million to purchase finished goods
inventories.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The transaction, expected to be completed by the end of
the year, comes as part of the Boise, Idaho, company's plan
to boost profits by reducing its pulp and paper presence in
the Northwest.</p>
<p>Weak paper prices and unanticipated complications with
maintenance and repair at several of Boise Cascade's pulp and
paper mills contributed to a shortfall in earnings for both
the first and second quarters.</p>
<p>With the purchase of the Vancouver facility, Appleton,
based in Appleton, Wis., will add approximately 100,000 tons
of paper-making capacity. The 450 people currently working at
the mill are to be retained under the Appleton ownership.</p>
<p>Boise Cascade stock closed at $30.125, up $1, in trading
yesterday on the New York Stock Exchange.</p>
