	<p class="article-leader">LAUSANNE, Switzerland -- China will abide by an
international ban on trade in ivory, according to an
organization that monitors trade in endangered wildlife
species.
   Beijing's decision was prompted by the closure of
traditional export markets in Japan, the U.S. and Western
Europe where governments have outlawed all ivory trade,
according to Jacques Bernez of the Convention on
International Trade in Endangered Species.</p>
