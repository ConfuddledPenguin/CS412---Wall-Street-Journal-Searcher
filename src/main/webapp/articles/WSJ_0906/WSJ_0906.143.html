	<p class="article-leader">LOS ANGELES -- A state court judge in San Antonio, Texas,
awarded the producers of the movie "Communion" $115 million
in a default judgment against units of beleaguered Management
Co. Entertainment Group and Virgin Holdings Ltd., a closely
held British company controlled by Richard Branson.
   Pheasantry Films Inc. and Bancannia Film Distribution, an
Australian company, had alleged that the defendants failed to
pay them $5 million owed for the production of the movie. The
suit also charged that the defendants misappropriated the
revenue from the distribution of the movie and failed to
promote the movie properly. The award includes $100 million
in punitive damages.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Management Co. Entertainment has struggled under a large
debt load following its $83 million acquisition in July 1989
of Virgin Vision Ltd., a U.K. distribution company, from
Virgin Group Ltd., another company controlled by Mr. Branson.
Director Nicolas Roeg and two other creditors have filed a
petition in federal bankruptcy court here seeking to force
the company's movie unit into involuntary liquidation.</p>
<p>Yesterday, Stephen Chrystie, a lawyer for Mr. Roeg and the
other creditors, said his clients had granted a one week
extention after receiving a letter from bankruptcy counsel
for Management Co. Entertainment. Mr. Chrystie said the
letter said that if Management Co. Entertainment can't pay
its creditors by Sept. 13, it plans to file for protection
from creditors under Chapter 11 of the federal Bankruptcy
Code. Management Co. Entertainment officials, now in London,
didn't return repeated telephone calls.</p>
<p>Management Co. Entertainment, a movie production, talent
management and distribution company, is currently in default
on more than $100 million in debt. Its major creditors
include G.E. Capital, a unit of General Electric Co.</p>

<p>MANAGEMENT CO. ENTERTAINMENT GROUP Inc. said that if its
M.C.E.G. Productions Inc. unit can't pay its creditors by
Sept. 13, the unit plans to file for protection under Chapter
11 of federal bankruptcy laws. An earlier story misstated the
entity that may file for protection.</p>
