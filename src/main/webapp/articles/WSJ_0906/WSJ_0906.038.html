	<p class="article-leader">A woman I know in Los Angeles told me recently she'd just
watched the best movie she'd seen in a long time, a picture
called "Metropolitan." Then, in her spacey, friendly L.A. way
she reconsidered, and said, "It wasn't a movie exactly, it
was, well, it was like a movie but really all it was was a
bunch of people having conversations. Really interesting
conversations, and when it was over I didn't want to leave,
the way some parties used to be a long time ago, when I went
to parties."
   In fact, "Metropolitan," a movie that has the intimate
design and feel of an engaging piece of theater, takes place
in a series of parties, debutante parties during Christmas
week in Manhattan. Though the picture's intertitles give the
picture's time as "not long ago," "Metropolitan" is in part
about the timelessness of, well, debutante parties and the
tiny inbred population that keeps such traditions alive. Its
upper-class teenage characters would fit comfortably in a
Noel Coward drawing room, or uncomfortably in one of Woody
Allen's mannered ensemble pieces.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The oddness is even odder considering that this witty,
pristine work is a first-time film. Actually, director and
writer Walt Stillman has started out the way many new
directors do; he has concocted a low-budget, idiosyncratic
bit of street theater. It's just that his action mostly takes
place in expensive living rooms, and his street is Park
Avenue.</p>
<p>This is not the location usually highlighted on the New
York City map consulted by contemporary, independent film
makers who almost uniformly equate urban with gritty,
dangerous, violent. They generally like to check out the
action in Harlem, the Bronx, Little Italy, Greenwich Village.</p>
<p>Mr. Stillman preferred to explore the city from the lofty
insularity of the ruling class. He has made his people both
ridiculous and endearing, youthful relics who understand the
silliness of their social routine even as they rigorously
adhere to the rules of ceremony. They have the education and
the leisure time to ponder their place in the universe, while
wearing tuxedos and pearls, or loafers and cashmere sweaters
from Bergdorf's.</p>
<p>Mr. Stillman apparently knows his subject from experience:
He's a Harvard graduate who then spent years dabbling in this
and that. He was an editor; wrote fiction and nonfiction for
many publications, including this one; he married a woman
from Barcelona and became the sales representative for
Spanish films. He went on to work in a family business,
representing cartoonists and illustrators; nights, he worked
on the script for "Metropolitan," which he wrote between 1984
and 1989.</p>
<p>Shot in a deliberately artificial style, in part to save
money, Mr. Stillman's film cost less than $500,000. But his
settings are hardly low-budget; his characters live in
buildings where uniformed guards protect the entryways, and
elevators open into the foyers of individual apartments.</p>
<p>His world might as well be the moon for most of us, and
that is precisely what makes this dotty gabfest so engaging
(or offputting to those who can find nothing redeemable in
the lives of the very rich). There is something warped yet
entirely believable about this group of young friends who
mainly sit around talking. They talk about the existence of
God, about socialism, about divorce, about the decline of the
haute bourgeoisie -- and about romance. They talk a lot about
romance because they are, after all, teenagers.</p>
<p>Perhaps not surprisingly, "Metropolitan" has been
attracting sellout crowds in Manhattan since it opened a
month ago at the Paris Theater, just off Fifth Avenue and
across the street from the Plaza Hotel. Predictably, too, it
has done very well in East Hampton. But it also has done
respectable business in Los Angeles, Chicago and San
Francisco. Now its distributor, New Line Cinema, plans to see
how this particular kind of well-born weirdness will play in
less obvious markets.</p>
<p>"Metropolitan" opens next week in 20 more cities,
including Cincinnati, Minneapolis and Dallas. This may seem
like a gamble, yet it is somehow in keeping with New Line's
main successes, which have been with movies whose broad
appeal -- even though they are about teenagers -- has never
been obvious: "Nightmare on Elm Street," the John Waters
film, "Hairspray," and the year's biggest sleeper hit,
"Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles."</p>
<p>Most of the world probably will regard the circle of
friends in "Metropolitan" as teenage mutants. They call
themselves the Sally Fowler Rat Pack; Sally is the pragmatic
blonde who cements the group and then is the most willing to
leave it all behind. She's played by Dylan Hundley, a
graduate of the Lenox School on Manhattan's East Side, who is
undeniably authentic in her film debut.</p>
<p>The young actors who fill out the requirements for a
well-grounded group are all quite good, especially
Christopher Eigeman as Nick Smith, the acerbic
participant-commentator. They dance (the rhumba and the
cha-cha), they play bridge (and strip poker in a really
risque moment), and they wonder whether the two innocents in
their midst -- Audrey and Tom -- will ever fall in love.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>VIDEO TIP: As the "Metropolitan" characters discuss the
dismal state of the bourgeois class, the earnest intellectual
shows just how smart he is by invoking the name of Luis
Bunuel's "The Discreet Charm of the Bourgeoisie." Dinner has
never been more fun, or more difficult to get on the table,
than in the Spanish director's 1972 French film.</p>
