	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- The chairman of the House Banking Committee
proposed that deposit insurance be drastically reduced to
perhaps three insured accounts per depositor and said he
would consider lowering the insurance level from the current
$100,000 per account.
   Rep. Henry Gonzalez's plan was the opening salvo of a
debate over the federal deposit insurance system for banks
and thrifts. The debate is expected to reach its zenith early
next year, when the Treasury Department is to make
recommendations of its own. The costs to taxpayers -- at
least $150 billion -- from bailing out the broke S&L
insurance fund has spurred policy makers to look for changes.
Mr. Gonzalez said he was offering his plan, with many
provisions still unsettled, to get the debate under way.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Separately, the nation's top thrift regulator warned that
the tougher S&L accounting rules contained in last year's
thrift-cleanup law still may be insufficient.</p>
<p>In a suggestion that will probably give the banking
industry fits, Mr. Gonzalez called for giving the Federal
Deposit Insurance Corp. freedom to increase as much as
necessary the premiums that banks pay for insurance coverage.
The Texas Democrat worries that the bank insurance fund is in
a weak condition after handling the record number of bank
failures in the past few years.</p>
<p>Mr. Gonzalez also recommended assessing premiums on
deposits held in foreign branches of U.S. banks, an idea that
splits the banking industry between its big banks, which hold
the foreign deposits and don't want to pay the premiums, and
small banks all over the country, which don't have foreign
deposits. Though foreign deposits aren't protected by law,
the small banks argue that regulators usually cover them in
bailouts.</p>
<p>And to help lessen losses to the insurance fund when a
bank or thrift is bailed out, Rep. Gonzalez proposed that
regulators take over institutions before they reach
insolvency -- when assets are less than liabilities -- and
still have a small amount of net worth. That idea is popular
with regulators but makes the banking industry nervous.</p>
<p>But the suggestion that may get the most notice from the
general public was Mr. Gonzalez's proposal to limit multiple
insured accounts. He said it "might be reasonable" to give
depositors insurance on a maximum of three accounts: "a
personal account, a separate business account, and a separate
custodial account like an {individual retirement account}."
Currently, an individual can have an almost unlimited number
of insured accounts by placing deposits in different banks or
thrifts.</p>
<p>Mr. Gonzalez also said he "would consider actually
reducing the $100,000 deposit coverage," noting that the
average account is about $8,700. The banking industry
generally is united in its opposition to lowering the amount,
fearing that it would prompt depositors to withdraw funds.
Mr. Gonzalez said depositors could pay extra for coverage
above the limits.</p>
<p>Perhaps more significantly, Mr. Gonzalez said he was upset
that regulators had ignored the $100,000 limit in most bank
failures and covered even deposits that exceeded the limit.
Regulators have usually covered all deposits at big banks
because of the feared effects on the financial system if the
depositors were cut off at $100,000. They have covered all
deposits in most small banks and thrifts as well.</p>
<p>Most experts believe this "too big to fail" policy has to
be tamed before such changes as lowering the deposit
insurance limit will have any effect. Mr. Gonzalez said the
insurance limits should be enforced, even for big
pension-fund deposits that have thousands of beneficiaries.
If the regulators adopted these suggestions, it would be a
radical change in the way bank failures have been handled in
recent decades.</p>
<p>The American Bankers Association, an industry trade group,
didn't have any immediate comment on the proposal, but the
group has called for maintaining the $100,000 limit and
imposing a loss of about 10% on deposits above the limit. The
plan, the association says, would ensure that the insurance
fund didn't lose money.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Timothy Ryan, director of the Office of Thrift
Supervision, said that generally accepted accounting
principles, or GAAP, sometimes gloss over the poor health of
some S&Ls.</p>
<p>"It is in both our interests to move existing accounting
principles toward economic reality as quickly as possible,"
Mr. Ryan told the American Institute of Certified Public
Accountants.</p>
<p>Unless GAAP rules change to better reflect reality, he
said, "GAAP will become increasingly irrelevant as a
regulatory tool."</p>
<p>The debate over how to apply accounting rules and whether
they should be revised is expected to continue. Just
yesterday, a federal court ruled in favor of owners of
Franklin Savings Association, Ottawa, Kan., who were
contesting a government takeover earlier this year. The
dispute centered on how the government accounted for
Franklin's losses.</p>
<p>S&L accounting rules were the subject of intense debate a
year ago, as Congress drafted the S&L cleanup law. Throughout
the 1980s, government S&L regulators allowed sick
institutions to operate under more lenient "regulatory
accounting principles," which permitted thrifts to delay
accounting for losses. Meanwhile, liabilities, backed by the
taxpayer, grew to hundreds of billions of dollars.</p>
<p>Also yesterday, two of Neil Bush's business associates,
who defaulted on $130 million in loans from Silverado
Banking, Savings & Loan Association, refused to appear before
a congressional panel this week. Rep. Frank Annunzio (D.,
Ill.), chairman of a House subcommittee, said he would seek
subpoenas to compel Denver businessmen Bill Walters and
Kenneth Good to testify about defaulting on the loans while
owning several homes and contributing to the Republican
National Committee.</p>
<p>Neil Bush, the son of the president, was a board member of
Denver-based Silverado for three years.</p>
