	<p class="article-leader">Yesterday Iraqi President Saddam Hussein called for an
Islamic holy war against U.S. forces in the Persian Gulf,
proclaiming: "Victory is very near." It occurs to us that the
last person who decided to issue a declaration of war against
the United States -- holy or otherwise -- was General Manuel
Noriega. Shortly thereafter, U.S. troops were landing in
Panama and Noriega was on the run.</p>
