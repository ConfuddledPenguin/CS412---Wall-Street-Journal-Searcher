	<p class="article-leader">JAKARTA, Indonesia -- Foreign-exchange losses at a major
private bank have led to an unprecedented shake-up in
Indonesian banking that could test the country's financial
system.
   In a move that stunned bankers, Indonesia's central bank
fired the entire board and top management of P.T. Bank Duta,
an institution with links to President Suharto. The
dismissals badly tarnish one of the president's closest
associates and could have broad implications for other banks
in Indonesia.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Local and foreign bankers generally welcomed firm steps by
Bank Indonesia, the central bank, to support Bank Duta,
saying such action is necessary to ensure the credibility of
the banking system. But at the same time, the
foreign-exchange problem -- not yet explained -- increases
anxieties about Indonesia's rapidly expanding financial
system. It also reinforces concerns about shortcomings in the
management and supervision of banks.</p>
<p>"There could be many banking problems we haven't heard
about yet," one foreign banker said. If there are more
"shocks" like Bank Duta, he added, "we're in for a real tough
time."</p>
<p>Financial problems at Bank Duta, disclosed in a central
bank statement Tuesday night, haven't caused any panic. Bank
Indonesia moved to ensure that Bank Duta stays in business.
The bank remained open normally Wednesday and no runs on
funds were reported. Central bank Gov. Adrianus Mooy appealed
to the public to "stay calm since Bank Duta can carry out its
activities."</p>
<p>Bustanil Arifin, the dismissed bank chairman and longtime
friend of Mr. Suharto, declined to answer reporters'
questions yesterday about the size of the foreign-exchange
loss, and deferred inquiries to the central bank. But Bank
Indonesia also wouldn't give any details about the
foreign-exchange trades, saying only that there were
"operational mistakes" that resulted in financial problems at
Bank Duta. The central bank appointed trustees to temporarily
manage the bank and said in its statement that it would
"carry out tighter supervision and more intensive guidance"
for Bank Duta.</p>
<p>Bank Duta is considered politically important because 72%
of its shares are controlled by three charity foundations
chaired by Mr. Suharto. It also is viewed as being
well-connected because Mr. Bustanil is related to Mr.
Suharto's wife.</p>
<p>According to the prospectus for a public share offering by
Bank Duta last April, three retired military men own 24%
shares each in the bank. The three in turn represent Dharmais
Foundation, Supersemar Foundation and Dakab Foundation, all
headed by Mr. Suharto. A cooperative of Bank Duta employees
holds 8%, and the remaining 20% is owned by the public.</p>
<p>Bank Duta's share offering, which raised the equivalent of
$119 million, was well-received "in good part because people
thought they were buying the safest bank politically, and it
had to perform well," one Jakarta stock analyst said.</p>
<p>The most prominent person to lose his job was Mr.
Bustanil, who long served as president of the bank's board of
commissioners, a supervisory team that Indonesian companies
have above a board of directors. Mr. Bustanil, a 64-year-old
retired major general, also is minister of cooperatives and
chairman of the State Logistics Agency, which runs the
government's important operations to buy and stock rice and
other commodities.</p>
<p>Mr. Bustanil still retains those two positions, but
political analysts predicted his high standing with Mr.
Suharto will be hurt badly by Bank Duta's losses.</p>
<p>"For Bustanil to lose his bank position, those forex
losses must be real big," said one foreign banker. "It's a
tremendous loss of face for a man whom Suharto has counted
on."</p>
