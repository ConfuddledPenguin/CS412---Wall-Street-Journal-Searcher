	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- A federal judge denied a request for an
injunction prohibiting Home Box Office Inc. from using any
programs containing music by composers represented by
Broadcast Music Inc.
   The injunction request is the latest episode in an
entrenched and growing legal battle between the cable
industry and societies such as BMI that monitor musical
performances and collect fees for composers and publishers.
As previously reported, HBO, a unit of Time Warner Inc., had
a license with BMI that expired at the end of 1989; HBO
hasn't paid performance fees to BMI for several months.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Judge John Sprizzo said, in denying the injunction, that
BMI hadn't proved "irreparable damage," and added that it is
clear that HBO is willing to take a new license. The judge
hasn't yet ruled on the underlying issue of the case --
whether BMI can legally charge local cable operators as well
as cable programmers such as HBO.</p>
<p>Judge Sprizzo directed HBO and BMI to try to negotiate
interim fees for HBO to pay until the matter is settled. If
the two parties are unable to agree on interim fees, the
judge said he would set them following a hearing Oct. 5.</p>
