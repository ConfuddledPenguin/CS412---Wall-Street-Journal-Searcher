	<p class="article-leader">TORONTO -- Abitibi-Price Inc. said its unionized workers
in Eastern Canada set a strike deadline of 8 a.m., Sept. 10.
   Abitibi, the second-largest newsprint producer in the
world, said members of the Canadian Paperworkers Union voted
77% in favor of a strike if agreement isn't reached before
the deadline.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The company said negotiations with the union will resume
here Sept. 7. Talks were suspended Aug. 20 so that the union
could take a strike vote.</p>
<p>A strike would close most of Abitibi's newsprint mills,
which are concentrated in Eastern Canada. Abitibi has total
annual newsprint capacity of about 1.95 million metric tons,
or about 8% of North American capacity. A metric ton equals
about 2,204.62 pounds.</p>
<p>A strike wouldn't have an immediate impact on newspaper
publishers and other newsprint users. Publishers of U.S.
daily newspapers had an average 41-day supply of newsprint on
hand at the end of July. As well, other newsprint makers can
boost their output in the event of a strike. But supplies are
already fairly tight and a strike at Abitibi would put upward
pressure on prices, newsprint buyers said.</p>
<p>An Abitibi spokeswoman said that when talks were suspended
only minor issues had been settled. "We're very early in the
negotiations process," the official said.</p>
<p>The union declined to comment until it notifies its
members, but a union official confirmed the vote results and
strike deadline.</p>
