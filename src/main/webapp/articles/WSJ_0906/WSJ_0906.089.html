<p>A nap is what I wish to do;</p>
<p>I feel like I've been hit, post-luncheon,</p>
<p>By someone with an ax or truncheon.</p>
<p>The world can go downhill on skids</p>
<p>As long as I can close my lids.</p>
<p>Revile me as a lout and loafa --</p>
<p>But go away. I want my sofa]</p>

<p>Double Dippers?</p>
<p>Bankers in highly leveraged deals</p>
<p>Have an enviable position of power,</p>
<p>In getting big fees when they're put together,</p>
<p>And again when they start going sour.</p>
