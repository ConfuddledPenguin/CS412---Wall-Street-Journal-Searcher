	<p class="article-leader">JOHANNESBURG, South Africa -- Red carpets are being rolled
out for the South African government in some very unlikely
places these days.
   Kent Durr, the minister of trade, industry and tourism,
had just arrived in Moscow last month when he heard a radio
station dedicate a song to his delegation. The disk jockey
said the tall and tanned Mr. Durr, the first South African
cabinet minister ever to visit the Soviet Union, looked like
a "movie star." Until then, the Soviets had viewed the
Pretoria government as a cabal of ugly racists.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>A few days later, President F.W. de Klerk stepped off a
plane in the African country of Madagascar and was greeted
with a banner newspaper headline screaming "Welcome to You."
His smiling face beamed from the front page. This was from a
country that routinely labeled South Africa the "racist
republic."</p>
<p>What's going on here? As the caption on Mr. de Klerk's
picture said, "A whistlestop visit under the sign of
realpolitik."</p>
<p>The realpolitik of desperately poor Africa is that if the
continent is to have a chance at recovery it needs open
economic ties with South Africa, the only high-tech, First
World economy south of the Sahara. In Eastern Europe,
realpolitik dictates that nations retooling their communist
economies take help wherever they can get it.</p>
<p>For South Africa, long shunned by the world for its
race-segregation policies, realpolitik means rejoining the
international community through any door that opens, even if
it is via the two regions of the world, Africa and Eastern
Europe, that have been its fiercest critics. Pretoria began
shedding its pariah status earlier this year by embarking on
a series of political reforms aimed at ending apartheid and
white minority rule.</p>
<p>"We may not smell of roses yet," says a South African
cabinet minister, "but we are no longer the polecat of the
world."</p>
<p>In spite of trade and financial sanctions, commerce has
always existed between South Africa and both Eastern Europe
and black Africa. For instance, Polish vodka has always found
its way to South Africa, and South African wine has been
available in Poland, albeit under a disguised label. The
goods either moved under the table or through a third party,
which raised the costs to both sides. Now, this trade is
coming out of the closet.</p>
<p>"For the first time in my life I'm not penalized for being
a white South African," says Frans Roelofse, a director of
Headquarters Ltd., which earlier this year opened South
Africa's first export-import joint venture in Hungary. A few
months later it set up shop in Mozambique and will soon be
doing business in the Ivory Coast. "In the past it's been so
frustrating," says Mr. Roelofse. "We simply couldn't go here
or there."</p>
<p>East European traders feel the same sense of freedom.
"Communism is gone," says Stefan Mathews, the Polish-born
director-general of the Polish-South African Chamber of
Commerce in Johannesburg. "No more communists, so now you can
trade with whom you like."</p>
<p>As a result, South Africans are showing up in the most
unexpected places these days, and the most unexpected people
are showing up here. In the past few months, Pretoria has
opened up official trade offices in Zaire and Hungary, and an
unofficial one in Warsaw. While South African businessmen
juggle invitations from Mozambique and Gabon, trade
delegations from Romania, Bulgaria, Poland, Hungary and
Czechoslovakia bump into one another in South Africa. Even
Miss Hungary came for a look.</p>
<p>Mr. Roelofse says South Africans and East Europeans, in
particular, make ideal, albeit strange, bedfellows. "Both of
our peoples are tired of living in make-believe systems,
where you're told to believe B when the reality is A," he
says. "Now we just talk reality to each other. When we're
doing business, they don't say to me, `OK, first renounce
apartheid and apologize for the past 40 years.' Likewise, I'm
not going to say to them, `You apologize for 40 years of
communism.'"</p>
<p>Ironies abound. The Soviet Union, for instance, welcomed
Mr. Durr before receiving Nelson Mandela. The Soviets have
been the biggest backer, both in money and weapons, of Mr.
Mandela's African National Congress in its long fight to
topple Pretoria's white minority government. Yet it was Mr.
Durr, representing one of the world's most rabidly
anti-communist governments, who planted a fir tree near the
site of the Chernobyl nuclear disaster on behalf of the
people of South Africa. Mr. Mandela, who has been circling
the globe since being released in February from 27 years in
prison, still hasn't stopped by Moscow.</p>
<p>"We have been the poorer for not knowing each other," said
Mr. Durr after his Soviet travels. "We will both benefit and
be the richer by sharing our experience, culture and economic
potential."</p>
<p>Mr. de Klerk's Madasgascar trip was also laden with irony.
Madagascar never missed a beat at Organization of African
Unity meetings when it came to denouncing Pretoria. But with
his economy deteriorating, and with political intrigue as
thick as the island's tropical air, Madagascar President
Didier Ratsiraka made a nighttime phone call to Mr. de Klerk
-- following the release of Mr. Mandela -- to talk about
establishing trade links.</p>
<p>"When one is in politics you have to face reality," Mr.
Ratsiraka said after entertaining his visitors from Pretoria.
"At one stage it was in the best interests of my country to
break relations with South Africa. We now have commercial,
economic and cultural relations with the new South Africa
because it is in the best interests of Madagascar."</p>
<p>Neither visit produced much in the way of immediate trade
or diplomatic ties. But for the South Africans, just getting
a foot in the door after all these years of being locked out
is most important.</p>
<p>"Our economic future lies in industry, and it must be
export-led," says Stefanus Naude, director-general of
Pretoria's department of trade and industry.</p>
<p>The Polish-South African Chamber of Commerce is ready to
show the way. "We just want to get on with business," says
Mr. Mathews. On the wall behind his desk is a Polish flag,
with a gold crown on the eagle's head, just as it was before
the communists took over. The walls are decorated with
pictures of Polish kings and princes.</p>
<p>Mr. Mathews produces a catalog of a Polish bicycle-maker.
"They're looking for agents here," he says. He rifles through
a stack of business cards, Polish and South African, and says
there is a potential deal attached to each one. He talks
about engineering more than $100 million in two-way trade
this year. Someone in Poland wants dried flowers, someone
here wants fishing nets. Warsaw wants fruit juice,
Johannesburg wants shoes.</p>
<p>"We want to give people what they want, not what they have
been told to want," says Mr. Mathews. "Simple things, for
everyday survival. Poles don't want guns or ammunition. They
want fertilizer. South Africa has fertilizer. Perfect."</p>
