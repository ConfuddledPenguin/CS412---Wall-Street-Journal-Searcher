	<p class="article-leader">PARENTS PAY for some programs lost to state school budget
cuts.
   Last year, Worcester, Mass., groups raised thousands of
dollars through cake sales, car washes and outright
hat-passing to fund interscholastic sports as well as buy
books and audio-visual tools in that financially strapped
state. But this year the $100,000 "Sports Alive" program is
still up in the air. Maureen O'Sullivan, head of the
Worcester teachers' union, warns: "When you start funding
education through bake sales, you're in trouble." Affluent
moms and dads in Brookline, Mass., pay more this fall for a
private "extended day" service.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>At Hewlett-Woodmere schools, in Nassau County, N.Y.,
parents now foot travel costs for debate meets, science fairs
and the like. Bert Nelson, schools superintendent, says: "If
a child is successful at an activity, it can begin to get
expensive." California's controller approves a touchy
cost-of-living jump for schools. Some districts adjust to
shoestring budgets by chopping administrative costs: Shawnee
Mission Schools in Johnson County, Kan., cut $1 million in
expenses last year to compensate for a tiny budget. Next
year, it plans to add several language classes.</p>
<p>Standard & Poor's says 11 states offer "credit
enhancements," aiding bond ratings by assuring debt payments.</p>
<p>UNMASKED: Army surplus stores unload skads of quite
dubious gas masks.</p>
<p>Faddists buy some, but real fears of chemical warfare in
the Mideast spark sales of masks for shipment to relatives
overseas. The Jewish Defense Organization considered buying
surplus masks here for Israel but rejected the idea. JDO's
Mordechai Levy says the masks "wouldn't work in anything
other than a barnyard fire."</p>
<p>In New York, Unique Clothing Warehouse sells 20 of its
$16.99 gas masks a day, compared to 20 a week before Iraq's
invasion of Kuwait. MASH Army and Navy sells about 50 masks a
week. Weiss & Mahoney says it sold several hundred $14.95
masks and can't get more. Some buyers ignore warnings that
masks may guard only against low-grade fumes, not mustard and
nerve gas. Raphael Farber, Israeli tourism head in the U.S.,
says his country stockpiles millions of masks and calls the
buying "the result of panic by people who don't rely on
governments to deal with problems."</p>
<p>BIG BIONIC BROTHER comes of age -- with high-tech,
high-cost security devices.</p>
<p>Corporate spending on surveillance and services may top
$22 billion, up 13% from last year, says Leading Edge
Reports, Cleveland. Fastest-growing niche: biometric access.
A $5,000 gizmo from Eye-Dentify, Portland, Ore., scans
blood-vessel patterns of the retina (more distinct than
fingerprints) while International Electronics, Needham
Heights, Mass., offers an $1,800 system using vocal
passwords. Keys are stolen, cards lost, says John Waldstein.
"But you always have your voice with you."</p>
<p>Plain old snooping gets a lift, too. Tiny cameras, now
with color and sound, shrink out of view to watch employees
as well as customers. Security Tag Systems, St. Petersburg,
Fla., electronically links cameras to cash registers at 100
convenience stores, logging a picture of each sale. Such
scrutiny makes "sweethearting" transactions difficult, says
Security Tag's Kenneth Mortenson. Some retailers "bug"
service counters with microphones to hear how sales clerks
deal with customers.</p>
<p>Hallcrest Systems, McLean, Va., says financial crime costs
$114 billion a year, will reach $200 billion by 2000.</p>
<p>WOMEN VENDORS call lack of capital a major obstacle, says
a study by the Center for Advanced Purchasing Studies, Tempe,
Ariz. Another pitfall to winning corporate contracts: buyers'
good old boy networks.</p>
<p>`ENERGETIC' TEENS boost utility bills (no kidding),
consuming 54% more electricity and 13% more natural gas than
teen-less households, says a study by CMS Energy's Consumers
Power Co., Jackson, Mich.</p>
<p>TAKE A SEAT, but ante up first. Directorship, a Westport,
Conn., consultant, compiles a database of possible corporate
board candidates. It costs $125 to be listed.</p>
<p>SET IN STONE, catalog prices can torment business when
costs -- like oil -- jump.</p>
<p>Sticking to published price is a badge of honor for Sears,
Roebuck & Co., Spiegel Inc., Crate & Barrel, Disney's
Childcraft and others. But some brace to bite the bullet as
world events upset some carefully hedged offerings. "If our
costs go up, our profits go down," says Gordon Segal, Crate &
Barrel president. He fears factories may add oil surcharges
to freight bills as in the 1970s. Barry Marchessault,
Childcraft president, notes the industry's biggest cost
variables are postage, paper and printing -- two of which
could be hurt by oil prices.</p>
<p>Rising polypropylene prices already add to the cost of
making the $797 Porta-Bote listed in a Sears catalog. But the
price is good through next March: Sears locks in supply price
early on with suppliers. "We're stuck with that," says Sandy
Kaye, president of Porta-Bote. But he adds the energy crisis
provides a silver lining: Sales of the light, foldable boat
soar. Crate & Barrel says prices for handblown glass made in
Eastern Europe may jump 20% to 30% next year. Why? Furnaces
are oil-fired.</p>
<p>Simmons Market Research Bureau says half of adult
Americans bought something by mail or phone last year.</p>
<p>BRIEFS: A Stamford, Conn., businesswoman launches Pen Pals
From the Past, a kids' reading and history service. . . .
Canetti Inc., N.Y., offers insomniacs the "Count Sheep
Series": A booklet depicts thousands of tiny woolies; an
audio tape counts them.</p>
