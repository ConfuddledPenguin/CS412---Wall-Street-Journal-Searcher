	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- The drive for better car gasoline-mileage is
about to collide with auto safety.
   That is the conclusion of the Insurance Institute for
Highway Safety and some government auto-safety officials, who
warn that tougher fuel-economy rules -- an increasingly
popular idea because of the Mideast turmoil -- will
inevitably result in smaller vehicles and higher death rates.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>But environmental groups and some highway safety advocates
vociferously disagree. Saying that stricter mileage rules
would hurt safety is "totally untrue and bogus," asserts
consumer advocate Ralph Nader.</p>
<p>The increasingly nasty battle over fuel-economy standards
could determine what kind of cars consumers will be driving
in coming years. It promises to come to a head this fall,
when Congress takes up legislation sponsored by Democratic
Sen. Richard Bryan of Nevada that would require auto makers
to increase the fuel efficiency of their fleets by 20% in
model year 1995 and 40% by 2001.</p>
<p>Contending that the legislation could hurt safety, the
Insurance Institute, which is funded by the insurance
industry, points to a number of studies to back up its
argument. One, just completed by the institute, found that 11
types of General Motors Corp. cars downsized since 1977 had
significantly higher death rates than than their earlier,
larger counterparts. It also found that while death rates for
Toyotas and Nissans in 1979 were 56% higher than for domestic
Ford and GM cars, the rates have gotten much closer as the
Japanese cars have gotten bigger and the American cars
smaller.</p>
<p>A little-noticed 1989 study by the Transportation
Department's National Highway Traffic Safety Administration
showed similar results. Noting that "narrower, lighter,
shorter cars have higher rollover rates than wide, heavy,
long ones," the agency found that the reduction in car sizes
since 1970 has resulted in approximately 1,340 additional
deaths in single-vehicle rollover crashes each year. And a
study last year by a Brookings Institution researcher and a
Harvard University professor predicted that over the next 10
years, the fuel-economy rules would be responsible for up to
3,900 additional fatalities involving smaller 1989 models
alone.</p>
<p>On the other side of the debate are some safety and energy
analysts, who deny that tougher fuel-mileage rules would
inevitably lead to another round of vehicle downsizing. They
say available technology could provide major mileage gains --
if only car companies were compelled to use it to make cars
more fuel-efficient rather than faster and more powerful.</p>
<p>"At 45 miles per gallon, we aren't talking about
downsizing the vehicle, and therefore, safety doesn't enter
into it at all," says William MacGavern, staff attorney for
the U.S. Public Interest Research Group, a lobbying group. He
says front-wheel drive, the use of four, rather than two,
valves per cylinder, improved aerodynamic styling, extra
intake and exhaust valves, and continuously variable
transmissions can turn gas-gulpers into gas-sippers without a
major slimming down.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, if downsizing does occur, these analysts
say, smaller cars can be made safer by installing air bags
and other safety equipment. "You can build safety into small
cars if you want to do it," says Clarence Ditlow, executive
director of the Center for Auto Safety, a consumer group
often critical of car manufacturers.</p>
<p>Similarly, Joan Claybrook, president of Public Citizen, an
advocacy group, and a former NHTSA administrator, pointed out
that under her tenure, the traffic-safety agency built
experimental vehicles that got from 32 to 50 miles per
gallon, yet protected occupants in 50 mile-per-hour frontal
crashes. The vehicles were made of lightweight, high-strength
steel filled with foam.</p>
<p>Sen. Bryan's bill would be the most sweeping change in the
fuel-economy law since the original standards were
established in 1975 in response to the first oil shock. Fuel
economy is much improved from 15 years ago but in recent
years has begun to lag; it slipped 4% from 1988 to 1990,
according to the Insurance Institute. Car makers currently
must meet a fleetwide average of 27.5 miles per gallon.</p>
<p>The auto industry, which is adamantly opposed to tighter
fuel-economy rules, denies that technology alone -- without
downsizing -- would allow it to comply with the gas-mileage
requirements now pending in Congress. But industry officials
won't publicly discuss the safety implications of
fuel-economy rules, saying they could be sued if they admit
that their small cars aren't as safe as their big ones.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, most people on both sides of the
fuel-economy debate acknowledge that, everything else being
equal, small cars aren't as safe as large ones. "You can't
repeal the laws of physics," says Brian O'Neill, president of
the Insurance Institute.</p>
<p>The institute found that the 1989 fatality rate for the
smallest cars on the road was three deaths per 10,000
registered vehicles, compared with 1.3 deaths for the largest
cars. While a modest tightening of the fuel-economy standards
might not have a big impact on safety, much tougher rules
could lead to a "substantial increase" in the fatality rate
from what it would otherwise be, he contends.</p>
<p>In the institute's study of the GM cars, researchers
concluded that, after downsizing, occupant death rates during
1985-1989 increased for 10 of the 11 types of cars examined,
and stayed the same for the 11th. For example, the rate for
the 1980-81 model F-cars (Chevrolet Camaros and Pontiac
Firebirds) was 2.3 deaths per 10,000 registered cars. After
downsizing in 1982, the rate for 1982-1983 Camaros and
Firebirds increased to 3.3. A GM spokesman said the car maker
hadn't examined the report in detail, but that large cars
offer an "extra measure of protection."</p>
<p>Mr. Nader doesn't dispute that but says the "great
leveler" is air bags, and he notes that the Bryan bill
includes a provision encouraging manufacturers to equip small
cars with air bags. Mr. O'Neill counters that air bags, while
beneficial, don't work in every accident: They don't protect
occupants involved in side crashes, for example, or in
frontal crashes so severe that the passenger compartment is
crushed.</p>
