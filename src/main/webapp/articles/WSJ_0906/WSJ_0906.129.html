	<p class="article-leader">GULF CRISIS shows few signs of boosting small firms' slice
of defense sales.
   Some small businesses have received "letter contracts," or
quick orders, for extra supplies of such items as desert
camouflage nets, Pentagon officials say. But, overall, small
and medium-sized Defense Department contractors are getting
few new orders as the result of Iraqi President Saddam
Hussein's threat to world oil supplies, says Donald Grigg,
president of the Association of Small Research, Engineering
and Technical Services Companies. "There may be an initial
uptick for some of the larger companies, but we also might
see a reduction in programs sooner because so much was spent
on {opposing} Iraq," he says.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>During the first three quarters of fiscal 1990, the
Defense Department met its goals for small-business
contracting by spending $14 billion on prime contracts and
another $14 billion in subcontracts with smaller companies.
But critics contend that defense officials set contracting
goals they can comfortably meet, making it difficult to
evaluate the department's effort. The Pentagon continues to
fall far short of congressionally mandated goals of spending
5% of its prime-contract dollars and 5% of subcontracing
money with minority-owned and other small, disadvantaged
concerns. At the end of the third quarter, the agency had
spent $2.3 billion, or 3% of the total, for such prime
contracts, and $1 billion, or 2.7% of the total, for such
subcontracts.</p>
<p>A word to the wise for small technical businesses: Go
East, as in Eastern Europe, says Mr. Grigg. "Almost
everything we do is needed there."</p>

<p>SON OF S&L SELLOFF: SBA seeks marketing plan for assets of
failed SBICs.</p>
<p>With about 170 failed Small Business Investment Companies
in liquidation proceedings, the Small Business Administration
has become the not-so-proud owner of such assets as common
stock in closely held concerns, preferred stock and loans to
companies. But instead of establishing its own version of the
Resolution Trust Corp., the federal agency in charge of
assets from bankrupt savings and loan institutions, SBA
officials plan to hire a private contractor to help place a
dollar value on the assets and market them.</p>
<p>The initial sales effort will probably include something
under $100 million in equity and assets, says Ron Cibolski,
chief of the SBA investment division's liquidations branch.
Given the magnitude of the SBIC problem, he says, "It could
be much more at some point." The SBA wants to have its plan
in operation within the next few months. But it is moving
cautiously because it wants to ensure the government gets a
fair price and because valuing assets and equity in closely
held corporations is very difficult, Mr. Cibolski says.</p>
<p>The marketing plan could range from an auction sale to
sending mailers to likely purchasers, he says.</p>

<p>SBIC FALLOUT? Pressures from investigations into SBIC
failures may have influenced Charles Gillum's recent
departure as SBA inspector general to become the Agriculture
Department's deputy inspector general, some SBA officials
suggest. They say Mr. Gillum was caught between demands of
the Senate Small Business Committee for very detailed
information on the problems and his own icy relations with
the SBA's investment division and administration. His office
turned up much of the bad news about the floundering program,
but some of its own decisions were questioned in the process.
Mr. Gillum couldn't be reached for comment. The Agriculture
Department's inspector general office that he will head is
several times the size of the SBA operation.</p>

<p>ECONOMIC GLOOM is growing among small businesses.
According to the National Federation of Independent
Business's latest quarterly survey, only 17% of 2,100
business owners queried expect the economy to improve,
compared with 22% in the second quarter. More than one fifth
-- 22% -- see worse times ahead, up eight percentage points.</p>
<p>The overall small-business optimism index, which includes
expected business conditions, fell to a seasonally adjusted
98.2 for the third quarter from 100.8 for the second and was
the lowest since 1982.</p>
<p>"Small-business owners don't like what they see on the
horizon," NFIB President John Sloan said. "And now with the
Iraqi invasion, there will be even less hope for an upturn
this fall."</p>
<p>The National Association of Wholesaler Distributors, which
represents small and large concerns, also said its confidence
index, based on a survey of 219 firms, recently showed a
decline.</p>

<p>FRANCHISING FRACAS: A congressional report urges more
safeguards.</p>
<p>A House Small Business Committee report calls for federal
legislation setting minimum standards of protection for the
legal rights and financial interests of franchisees. The
report's biggest bombshell: that some franchisees should be
entitled to payment for part of the value of a business when
the franchise is terminated. The issue of the day, says the
report, isn't whether franchisers fairly disclose contractual
terms to potential franchise holders, but the abuses of
continuing franchise relationships. Some 17 states have
enacted laws to prevent abuses such as requiring equipment
purchases from the franchiser at above market prices and
ending the franchisee's contract with little notice.</p>
<p>New York franchising attorney David Kaufmann says the idea
that some compensation is due a franchisee when his contract
expires "strikes at the heart" of the franchise relationship.
In an article submitted to the New York Law Journal, he
argues that franchisees essentially buy a business on an
installment plan, with nothing owed them when the contract
expires. But the committee staff maintains that Congress
recognized the legal and financial rights of franchisees in
earlier statutes protecting auto dealers and gasoline
franchisees. The committee will hold hearings on the issue
later this month.</p>
<p>When a franchise contract is terminated in California,
state law requires franchisers to offer to repurchase all of
the inventory that a franchisee was required to buy.</p>

<p>SMALL TALK: Technological treasure? House Small Business
Committee Chairman John LaFalce (D., N.Y.), and Sen. Rudy
Boschwitz (R., Minn.), introduce bills to create a computer
data base with information about federally sponsored research
under way in federal labs and in universities. . . . Silver
lining: Small-business lobbyists figure that with Iraq and
the budget deficit to occupy lawmakers, "Congress," as one
lobbyist puts it, "won't have time to come up with anything
ridiculous for small business."</p>
