	<p class="article-leader">In 1987 I won $70,000, a reputation, and probably an
epitaph. "He was on `Jeopardy]'" is how I am often introduced
and frequently recognized. Being on television does have an
unavoidable glamour. People will gather around me, craving to
hear "all about Hollywood," as if nine appearances on a game
show qualifies me as a hot-tub intimate of the stars. I also
am expected to live up to the intellectual image of
"Jeopardy]"; everyone feels entitled to try stumping me with
trivia questions.
   Of course, there is the inevitable interest in how I have
spent my winnings. Despite the many temptations awaiting a
bachelor with money, I have not dissipated my fortune or
myself. The only urge that I gratified was to quit my job in
public relations and pursue a career as a writer. My
"Jeopardy]" windfall spares me from starving while I am
waiting for the New Yorker to appreciate me.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Many people are disappointed, however, that I am not
making a career of being a game-show hustler. Having enjoyed
fame and fortune on "Jeopardy]" how could I possibly resist
the enticements of "Wheel of Fortune" and "Hollywood
Squares"? I am advised to be a professional contestant, and
plunder one game show after another. In fact, the television
networks have a policy against that, and so do I. I would not
want to be on any game but "Jeopardy]"</p>
<p>On the other shows, the prizes are the attraction; on
"Jeopardy]" the game itself is the appeal. A witty,
stimulating test of knowledge and recall, "Jeopardy]" poses a
tempting challenge: "Are you as smart as you think you are?"
I wanted to know; so I traveled to California at my own
expense, survived the audition's tests and interviews, and
achieved my footnote of fame. Once the dream had been
realized, my adventures on game shows were over. So I
sensibly thought; I forgot that dreams can recur.</p>
<p>Three years later, a familiar voice from Hollywood
reintroduced himself and "Jeopardy]" to my life. Glenn was
the staff member in charge of the contestants, and now he
extended me a second chance to be one. "Jeopardy]" was
inviting its past champions to compete in what promised to be
the Armageddon of trivia: "Super Jeopardy]" This tournament
would start in three weeks and air as a summer series on
Saturday night on ABC. The greatest players ever on
"Jeopardy]" would vie to prove who was the best, and I was
among the chosen.</p>
<p>If the honor were not incentive enough, "Super Jeopardy]"
also would provide transportation, hotel accommodations and
$5,000 for each contestant. Of course, there would be
additional inducements for winning. The tournament was
organized as nine quarterfinal matches, three semifinals and
one final match. A winner of a quarterfinal game would
receive $10,000. Victory in a semifinal match would be worth
$25,000. Then, in the final game, the three remaining
contestants would compete for the prize of a quarter million
dollars.</p>
<p>Although elated by the invitation, I considered my
prospects with reasonable anxiety. The competition would be
more formidable than I had yet faced; worse, I was not as
sharp as I used to be. When still part of the corporate
world, I would read several newspapers and magazines
ostensibly for my work. Since my literary retreat, however, I
had become oblivious to vogues and fads. The celebrities on
the cover of People were increasingly unfamiliar. I had some
studying to do, and but three weeks to do it.</p>
<p>Part of my regimen included scanning the past 200 issues
of "Time" magazine. I also read the newspaper with more than
usual care. I made a point of reading reviews by pompous
critics, the types who drop as many allusions as punctuation
will allow. My purpose was to look up the references if I did
not already know them. Finally, I would make up and subject
myself to a gauntlet of "Jeopardy]" questions.</p>
<p>The questions on the show are a mischievous mix of the
profound and the trivial, on any subject under the sun and
past the censors. One could just as easily be asked about
Howdy Doody as the French Revolution. The questions can not
be too esoteric or complicated, since the game requires
succinct responses; but even if a contestant doesn't have to
explain Kierkegaard, he might have to spell it. The most
challenging questions often are about the obvious rather than
the arcane. "For whom was Tuesday named?" That kind of
provoking thought is what makes "Jeopardy]" so confounding
and entertaining.</p>
<p>I was studying and packing until the very last minute. The
flight to California was routine, and my hotel was pleasant
although nothing the Japanese would buy. I arrived at the
studio no worse for the four hours of sleep that my nerves
begrudged me. There were 12 of us scheduled to compete. If
only as familiar faces, we already knew each other, since we
all were "Jeopardy]" fans as well as veterans. We acted as if
it were a reunion rather than a tournament. That homecoming
spirit pervaded the studio; being a star-struck Midwesterner,
I felt flattered to be remembered by Alex Trebek, the host of
"Jeopardy]"</p>
<p>(What is he really like? Even when the cameras are off,
Alex is suave, clever and sly. In his astute manner, Alex
reminds me of a Jesuit, not the benevolent activist of today,
but the intriguing charmer of history and Dumas novels.)</p>
<p>The one exception to this homecoming familiarity was
"Jeopardy]" itself. A number of changes had occurred to make
the game more "exciting" for prime time. Everything was
bigger but not necessarily brighter. One attempt at theatrics
incited a mutiny by the contestants.</p>
<p>During the final "Jeopardy]" question, smoke props were to
be set off, cloaking the contestants in a dramatic mist. In
fact, it was choking us, and we prevailed upon the studio to
drop that gimmick. Since this also was the first day of
taping, everything was entitled to go wrong: short circuits,
jammed mechanisms and miscalculating score boards. We endured
more than three hours of delays.</p>
<p>So how did I do? In the quarterfinal game, I played with
embarrassing recklessness, often trying to answer questions
before I had read them. My enthusiastic inaccuracies about
Burundi, Escoffier and the state fish of Alaska left me in
second place going into "Final Jeopardy]" The contestants
confronted this question: "At the time of this president's
inauguration, there were five former presidents still alive,
more than at any other time." I was the only one who knew
that the answer was Abraham Lincoln.</p>
<p>My apparent brilliance and victory ironically were due to
Nancy Reagan and a review of her book, "My Turn." Both she
and her ghostwriter had contended that there now were four
living former presidents, more than in any other time in
history; the book reviewer commented that Mrs. Reagan
evidently did not consider Lincoln worth knowing. That
sarcasm proved to be a valuable recollection.</p>
<p>The semifinal game started off as an exercise in
martyrdom. Despite my earnest ringing of the buzzer, in the
first third of the game I was consistently slower than my two
opponents. Fortunately, as the game progressed, I finally
acquired some coordination and made a fierce comeback. The
match's outcome largely was determined by luck.</p>
<p>One of my rivals was an actor from New York, and he found
a "daily double" in the category of Broadway musicals. The
daily double allowed him to wager all he had on a single
question. He could not resist the temptation, and he was not
obliging enough to be wrong. That gave him a lead of 10,000
points, and even with my best effort, the most I could do was
to finish second.</p>
<p>The finals will proceed without me, but my bruised vanity
has no restraint upon my enthusiasm for "Jeopardy]" I will be
an obsessive viewer of the "Super Jeopardy]" tournament,
which culminates, this Saturday, in that final game, for a
quarter million dollar prize. Of course, I will be
vicariously playing.</p>
<p>At least I am the richer for the $10,000, the anecdotes,
and an hour more of videotape to add to my "Jeopardy]"
legacy. Someday, my grandchildren will look in amusement and
wonder at those tapes of gramps when he had hair, reflexes
and a memory. I hope that they realize the real lesson of
"Jeopardy]": Intelligence has glamour, too.</p>
