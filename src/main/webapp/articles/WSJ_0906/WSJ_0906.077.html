	<h3>A U.S. Platoon That `Lives for the Night' Dreams of Training, and Beer, by Day</h3>

	<p class="article-leader">NEAR BATTLE POSITION COORS, Saudi Arabia -- The action
here begins at 4 p.m. As soon as the torchlike sun begins to
wane, the men who have dozed through the searing heat in the
skimpy shade afforded by camouflage nets mount their armored
vehicles.
   "We live for the night," says Lt. William Owen, a balding
Nebraskan with the expression of someone who is perpetually
worried. He heads a platoon in the Army's 24th Infantry
Division (Mechanized) -- the first U.S.-based armored unit to
reach the field here.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>He has plenty to worry about. When it comes to fighting
armored battles in the desert, the platoon is the basic unit.
And Lt. Owen's platoon -- like many of those hastily
assembled at Fort Stewart, Ga., for the Persian Gulf crisis
-- is missing some pieces. One of his four Bradley Fighting
Vehicles has broken down and the sun has fried the radio in a
second one.</p>
<p>Moreover, the unit arrived 10 men short of its authorized
32-man strength, and the spare parts Lt. Owen, 26 years old,
needs to fix things are still somewhere being unloaded from a
boat.</p>
<p>This site, a gut-wrenching hour's drive over the scrubby
desert from the nearest paved road, is only a temporary
training area for the 24th. When dusk comes, Lt. Owen and his
men begin training for a move farther north in Saudi Arabia,
where they may have to face an armored attack from Iraq.</p>
<p>This is a place where the men dream of cold beer. (Battle
Position Amstel and Battle Position Anheuser are not far
away.) And their officers dream of training. Until Aug. 7,
when the 24th was put on alert for duty in the Gulf, the
Army's budget crunch was so severe that much of the platoon's
$10.5 million of equipment couldn't be taken out for routine
operations.</p>
<p>Sgt. Frank Rivers, 31, the platoon's second in command, is
still having trouble adjusting to the change since then. "Now
all of a sudden we're the No. 1 priority," he says. "We can
get all the supplies we want." He spends most of the evening
instructing troops how to load the Bradley's wire-guided TOW
anti-tank missiles.</p>
<p>Since the North African campaign in World War II, the
desert has been considered tank country. While lightly armed
units can fight in the hills and forests of Central Europe,
there are few places here for soldiers to hide.</p>
<p>Hence, the Bradley, a way to move infantry around the
desert under the protection of armor. The cannon and TOWs of
the Bradley, in turn, help protect the vehicle's companion --
the M-1 tank -- from enemy infantry.</p>
<p>You also can sleep in and on a Bradley, which becomes
important after 11 p.m., when training stops. Lt. Owen
prefers the rear hatch cover, which he props up with an
ammunition case. His lanky driver, Ronald Parker, 28, somehow
manages to stretch out in the vehicle's cramped cockpit.</p>
<p>The vehicle's gunner, Pvt. Roger Taylor, 23, sprawls
nearby on a poncho, ignoring the scorpions and the
thumb-sized dung beetles that patrol after midnight.
"Soldiers," says Sgt. Rivers, "can sleep anywhere."</p>
<p>At 4:30 a.m., with the first hint of light, it's back into
the Bradleys again for maneuvers on the now-cooler sea of
sand. Lt. Owen's vehicle takes the lead and he uses flag
signals from the turret to guide the other two -- a way of
compensating for the broken radio.</p>
<p>When morning training ends, sometimes there are dealings
with the neighbors. Several hundred camels graze nearby, and
Lt. Owen and his fellow officers have taken great pains to
stay away from them and to avoid churning up the roads used
by the Bedouins who herd the camels.</p>
<p>There are signs their efforts will pay off. One Bedouin,
after carefully circling Lt. Owen's platoon in his pickup
truck, stopped for a chat. While Arabic is not one of the
things Lt. Owen and his men have been brushing up on, they
soon caught the gist.</p>
<p>"He kept slamming his fist into his palm and saying
`Saddam . . . Saddam,'" explains Lt. Owen, referring to
Iraq's strongman, Saddam Hussein.</p>
