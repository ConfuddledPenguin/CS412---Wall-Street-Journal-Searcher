	<p class="article-leader">DALLAS -- Valhi Inc. and NL Industries, Inc., two
companies controlled by Dallas financier Harold Simmons, said
they agreed in principle to merge in a transaction valued at
$411 million.
   Under terms of the agreement, Valhi, a chemical and
industrial concern, would issue 1.6 shares of its common
stock for each of the 22.6 million shares of NL common shares
it doesn't already own. Valhi currently holds about 66% of
NL, a petroleum services concern. The companies said the
agreement won't be completed if the average price of Valhi
common shares stays below $9.50 a share for the 20 trading
days ending two trading days before a shareholder vote on the
merger. Also, Valhi can terminate the merger if its average
price for the same period is above $13 a share. In composite
trading on the New York Stock Exchange, Valhi closed
yesterday at $11.375, up 25 cents a share.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The companies said the merger was subject to, among other
things, approval of Valhi's board and shareholders and
approval by a majority of NL shares present and voting, other
than those held by Valhi. The companies said that NL's board,
including its outside directors, approved the merger and
received an opinion from Salomon Brothers that the proposed
terms were fair to its shareholders, other than Valhi.</p>
<p>Steven L. Watson, vice president and secretary of Valhi,
said that both managements think the merger will be
beneficial to the separate shareholder groups. He wouldn't
comment further.</p>
