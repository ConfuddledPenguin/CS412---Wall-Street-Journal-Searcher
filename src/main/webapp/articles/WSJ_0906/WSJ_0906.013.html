	<p class="article-leader">Lawrence Weiss, one of Citicorp's top technology
executives, works at a desk surrounded by 14 boxes of
"Underoos," kids' underwear cleverly packaged to look like
superhero costumes. Mr. Weiss created Underoos in an earlier
job and keeps them nearby as a reminder of the marketing
principle behind them: The best new products are variations
on comfortable old products.
   Today he is applying that lesson to a lumpy beige gadget
that resembles an ordinary telephone. Citicorp is gambling it
will catch on as a bank-at-home device better than an earlier
system that let customers dial up their accounts via personal
computer.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"The trick is to mask the new technology," Mr. Weiss says.
"It's an Underoo."</p>
<p>This same philosophy is behind a cornucopia of products
sneaking computing power into the home in the guise of more
familiar devices. Other projects in the works use embedded
computer technology to let people trade stocks on a Nintendo
Co. game machine, receive written messages on an American
Telephone & Telegraph Co. telephone, search databases of
articles and listings on a television set and program
household appliances with a television's remote control.</p>
<p>Products such as these are crashing onto the turf of the
personal-computer industry, which has long promised to make
the PC as ubiquitous as a telephone or a TV. Right now, the
PC industry is wooing the home market more aggressively than
ever, led by lavish new products from International Business
Machines Corp. and Tandy Corp. These and other companies
paint pictures of every household using a computer to send
messages, read news, play games, bank and shop. PC makers
scoff at the idea that simpler household gadgets could ever
do these jobs.</p>
<p>But so far home computers have shaped up as a narrow
market. Only about a quarter of all American households have
PCs. Most use their computers for limited, utilitarian tasks,
such as writing or doing leftover office work.</p>
<p>Now, instead of home computers becoming household items,
household items are turning into home computers.</p>
<p>"People said there were going to be two or three computers
in every home like there are two or three telephones," says
A.C. Markkula, an Apple Computer Inc. founder and present
vice chairman. "They're right, but the physical
implementation isn't what they had in mind. Instead of having
three things that look like PCs, people will have many pieces
of equipment that are in essence PC technology but are buried
in refrigerator doors, and lighting systems, and VCRs and TVs
and CD players and telephones."</p>
<p>Mr. Markkula has founded a new Silicon Valley company
called Echelon Corp., which is working on ways to link all
the hidden microchips in a home or commercial building into
one communications and control network. Echelon won't say
more about its products until it unveils them later this
year.</p>
<p>Right now the most promising buried PCs are showing up
inside telephones. In a Citicorp pilot program, about 400
customers already are using the home-banking phone, which has
a little screen, a hidden keyboard and microchips that let it
handle all manner of banking tasks. The bank says it wants to
ship hundreds of thousands more of the phones over the next
few years, though it won't dislose a specific timetable.</p>
<p>The unit lets a user transfer funds, buy certificates of
deposit and send anyone a check. Eventually, the bank plans
to let customers check stock quotes and trade securities.</p>
<p>AT&T is working on a rival product dubbed SmartPhone,
which it is promoting as the standard telephone of the
future. SmartPhone, slated for a 1992 introduction, has a
small screen and built-in software for adding customized
programs. For instance, AT&T says, a customer could set the
phone so that pressing one button would place an order for
his usual pizza, or his usual seats at a baseball game.</p>
<p>Personal computers are "wrong for things that occur to us
suddenly and (that) we expect to be able to deal with quickly
and move on," says Michael Grisham, the AT&T strategic
planning executive who conceived the SmartPhone. But if you
took the SmartPhone apart, he says, "you'd find that what's
inside is pretty much the same as what's in a PC."</p>
<p>Televisions also are starting to converge with computers.
Viewers operate some new digital TVs by clicking a cursor
over windows and menus, just as with a PC and a mouse. Next
week, InSight Telecast Inc., a Palo Alto, Calif., start-up
partly owned by Japan's giant Sumitomo Corp., will introduce
a system that will let viewers call up a week's TV listings
on their screens and push some remote-control buttons to tell
a videocassette recorder which shows to record. The system
will be able to follow the instructions even if a show starts
late or runs long.</p>
<p>Other companies are turning TV screens into terminals for
information databases. Owners of Zenith Electronics Corp.
digital sets can call up news stories and read them on their
screens. Great American Communications Corp., a Cincinnati
media company, distributes the stories through special
signals that chips inside the TV can read.</p>
<p>In Montreal, 30,000 cable customers have a broader service
that lets them call up news, recipes, movie schedules,
weather and many other services by punching numbers on a TV
remote control.</p>
<p>Le Groupe Videotron, the cable company that provides the
service, outfitted its channel boxes with computer chips that
handle the information.</p>
<p>The largest maker of cable boxes, General Instrument
Corp.'s Jerrold division, has even bigger plans to expand a
TV system's reach. Earlier this year, it demonstrated a cable
remote-control unit that flips over to become a telephone.
It's also working on features that will let the same unit
control any other electrical appliances in the home. Jerrold
expects to begin selling the units next year.</p>
<p>Another ambitious plunge into the PC's terrain is under
way at Nintendo, the video-game maker. Next year it plans to
introduce a service that will send information and games over
phone lines to televisions with Nintendo sets. The first
features will include a stock-trading service from Fidelity
Investments, the Boston mutual-fund giant. Later, Nintendo
envisions offering electronic mail, shopping and consumer
information, such as comparative prices for car insurance.</p>
<p>Nintendo runs the considerable risk that people won't feel
comfortable doing their personal finances with the same toy
they use for Cybernoid and Super Mario Brothers. On the other
hand, unlike the PC industry, it has a fast-growing customer
base addicted to its products. By year's end, Nintendo says,
more than 30% of American families will own its machine.</p>
<p>To consumers who already have to find the neighbor's kid
to help them program their VCR, the prospect of phones and
TVs sprouting strange new functions and commands could be
distressing. Indeed, the danger in all these projects is that
they'll make a home's simplest machines as forbidding as a
personal computer.</p>
<p>"Taken to its logical extreme you could generate a
backlash from the public," admits Bruce Huber, marketing vice
president of Zenith's consumer-products group.</p>
<p>For their part, PC makers say the disguised computers are
just feeble imitations of the real thing. "Once you get this
data in on your phone, what do you do with it? Do you write
it down?" asks Robert Amezcua, the product manager for IBM's
two-month-old PS/1 home computer. "If I'm really going to do
stock analysis, I want to be able to run my analysis program
or my financial spreadsheet."</p>
<p>Tandy Vice President Howard Elias says the PC industry is
just starting to bring out easy-to-use products that will
finally let it break open the home market. Tandy's month-old
1000 RL comes with simple programs for organizing recipes,
creating shopping lists, planning meals and posting messages
for family members.</p>
<p>Some people say the ultimate home-information appliance
will come out of the blue, rather than evolving from
something familiar. "The big developments of the 20th century
were not extrapolated," says Alan Kay, a pioneer in the
personal computer's development and currently a senior
research fellow at Apple. "Companies rarely come up with
replacement technology for their old technology."</p>
<p>He rattles off a string of examples: Railroads didn't
invent the airplane, Western Union didn't invent the
telephone, A.B. Dick didn't invent the photocopier, Smith
Corona didn't invent the word processor.</p>
<p>"A lot of the uninteresting stuff flows smoothly from the
past," Mr. Kay says. "But all the interesting stuff is like
thunderstorms."</p>
