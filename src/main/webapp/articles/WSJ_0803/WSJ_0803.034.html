	<p class="article-leader">WELLINGTON, New Zealand -- Air New Zealand Ltd., the
country's international air carrier, said it is firing 600
staff and scrapping its fleet of 15 Fokker Friendship F27
aircraft to become more competitive on domestic services.
   Jim Scott, chief executive of Air New Zealand, said the
provincial routes will be included on main trunk routes
serviced by its bigger Boeing 737 aircraft because of heavy
competition on those main routes.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Air New Zealand's main competitor on the trunk routes is
Ansett New Zealand Ltd., a unit of Ansett Transport
Industries Ltd., an Australian domestic airline owned jointly
by Rupert Murdoch's News Corp. and transportation company TNT
Ltd.</p>
<p>"Today's reality is that Air New Zealand is contesting the
main trunk routes with a totally overseas-owned competitor
who has chosen to concentrate its efforts on these higher
volume and, thereby, more profitable routes," Mr. Scott said.</p>
<p>The company said that since Air New Zealand isn't allowed
to contest Ansett's home markets in Australia, it can't
afford any longer to serve less-profitable provincial routes
in New Zealand with the F27 fleet.</p>
<p>Air New Zealand is 35% owned by Brierley Investments Ltd.
of New Zealand and 20% owned by Qantas Aiways Ltd.,
Australia's state-owned international airline. Japan Air
Lines Co. and American Airlines Inc. each own 7.5%, and the
remaining 30% was floated on the New Zealand stock exchange
in 1989.</p>
