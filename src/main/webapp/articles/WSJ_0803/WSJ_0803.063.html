	<p class="article-leader">When a church opens its doors for worship, it opens them
to everyone, and that should include the homeless, no matter
their physical or mental condition. But this Christian
response can also be dangerous -- witness last year's
horrifying murder of a worshipper in St. Patrick's Cathedral
by a deranged homeless man.
   At the church where I am rector, a midtown Manhattan
Episcopal parish, just such people -- homeless and
unmistakably very mentally ill -- do sometimes wander in
during our Sunday services. One man in particular, swathed in
torn and dirty clothes and unable to speak coherently, has
come in several times; he walks quickly up a side aisle,
enters a pew near the front, kneels and seems to pray, though
it be only babbling.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>He even came in briefly while the new Episcopal bishop of
New York was conducting confirmation ceremonies. As on
previous occasions, he knelt, seemed to pray, then jumped up
and walked out down the center aisle, speaking frantically
but causing only minimal disturbance.</p>
<p>But on a recent Sunday, his pattern changed radically. As
my associate minister was giving her sermon, the man came
quickly up the center aisle in a very agitated state. He
entered a front pew, knelt and then stared at the woman in
the pulpit. Suddenly, he scrambled from the pew and ran
toward her, shouting.</p>
<p>My associate stopped speaking but held her ground in the
pulpit. Fortunately, two laymen reacted quickly and ran up to
either side of the man, touched his arms gently and quietly
persuaded him to leave. They escorted him back down the
center aisle as he raged and shouted.</p>
<p>"And we will pray for him, too," my associate told the
congregation.</p>
<p>Though only a brief intrusion, it left us all a bit
shaken, realizing how differently and violently such an
incident might have ended. And, of course, thoughts of our
own safety aside, we are concerned for the hundreds of people
such as our anguished visitor who are living on the city's
streets, most of them seemingly mentally ill. Our church,
like so many in the city, has programs to aid the homeless.
But our concern also leads us to a philosophical, legal and,
sometimes, religious debate with ourselves: Should insane
people who roam the streets be confined against their will or
should they be allowed to remain free?</p>
<p>Many are on the streets as a result of the closing of
mental institutions in the 1960s and '70s. Critics who
campaigned against these institutions said they were more
barbaric prisons than hospitals for healing; sadly, the
community-based outpatient clinics that were supposed to have
replaced them have never materialized.</p>
<p>When I began my ministry in New York City in the early
1970s, I, too, argued that these unfortunates were better off
on the street than in some hellish asylum. Now, I am not so
sure.</p>
<p>A friend who is both a professor of philosophy and an
Episcopal priest doesn't accept the position that society's
overriding concern is for the freedom of movement of the
insane. "I am a member of the American Civil Liberties Union
and I am a Christian," he told me. "The ACLU part of me says
they should not be locked up; the Christian part of me says
that it is not right to let them roam the streets in such
terrible shape."</p>
<p>My friend's statement of the alternatives shows that it's
not simply a question of confining the disturbed against
their will or letting them live free -- for what does "free"
mean in such cases? How could the man who lunged toward the
pulpit in our church be described as exercising his free will
if he is clearly unaware of what he is doing? How could he be
said to have civil rights that include freedom of movement if
his actions are driven by inner compulsions over which he has
no control?</p>
<p>Surely not only the Christian would take a larger view
that leaving the man in a degraded state not only doesn't
help him but casts a moral shadow over the society that is
guaranteeing him his putative freedom of movement. Surely not
only the Christian would wonder if we would all be better off
if the man were confined and had a better chance for a more
human existence.</p>
<p>We need, then, to recognize that confining at least some
of the mentally ill may be the best thing for them -- not
just pragmatically, for the good of society, but in humanist
and spiritual terms, for their own good. Already, in New York
City at least, there appears to be wide public sympathy for
measures to keep the homeless from bus and train stations. As
these measures could reflect a coming wave of resentment of
the homeless themselves, it may be time to find ways to get
the mentally ill homeless off the streets.</p>
<p>As for those who are not insane but who are in danger of
being committed by unscupulous relatives, their rights can be
safeguarded, while those who clearly cannot care for
themselves are cared for. While the indigency of the street
people should make us careful about sweeping them out of
sight for our convenience, we can maintain institutions for
the mentally ill in humane and dignified ways rather than
allowing the least of these, our brothers and sisters, to
suffer the effects of their alleged freedom.</p>
