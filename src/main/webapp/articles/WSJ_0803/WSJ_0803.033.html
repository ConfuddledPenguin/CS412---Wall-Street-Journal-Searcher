	<p class="article-leader">William Anthony Rand, whose now-defunct Rand Theaters Inc.
was furiously expanding last year, was jailed by a state
judge in Little Rock, Ark., for contempt of court.
   The demise of Mr. Rand's highflying, movie-theater empire
was described in a page one article in December in this
newspaper.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Mr. Rand was jailed along with his wife, Mary Ann, by
Judge Robin Mays after a hearing over $71,000 he had been
ordered to deposit with the court. The money was the proceeds
of a sale of a home in the resort community of Eden Isle in
Cleburne County, about 100 miles north of Little Rock. First
American Title Insurance Co. of the Midwest, Memphis, Tenn.,
filed suit in March seeking part of the proceeds from the
sale. Its attorney, Marian M. McMullan, claimed in court that
the Rands hid the money by putting it in bank accounts and by
distributing it among friends and relatives.</p>
<p>Ms. McMullan also says Mr. Rand is the subject of a
federal criminal investigation in Little Rock over the
operation of the theater chain, and state tax officials say
they turned over office records in response to a federal
grand jury subpoena earlier this year. The U.S. Attorney's
office in Little Rock wouldn't comment, but it is believed
part of the investigation involves alleged fraud in the
leasing of theater equipment.</p>
