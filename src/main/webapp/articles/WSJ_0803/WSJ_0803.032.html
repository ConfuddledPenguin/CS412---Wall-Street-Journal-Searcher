	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- Small business has a hit list for this
fall's congressional elections.
   The Free Enterprise Political Action Committee, an arm of
the National Federation of Independent Business, has targeted
nine Senate and House Democrats the PAC considers anti-small
business. They include Sen. Carl Levin of Michigan, Sen. Tom
Harkin of Iowa and Oklahoma Rep. Mike Synar. The three
lawmakers vigorously deny they are foes of small business.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The drive to defeat candidates reflects the growing
political involvement of the NFIB, the largest small-business
group. It is the first time that the federation's PAC has
gone after more than a few lawmakers and the first time it
has opposed House members. The move also bucks the usual
corporate PAC pattern of backing incumbents, a practice that
helps most federal lawmakers return to Washington every
election.</p>
<p>"The PAC's board isn't happy that the small-business
community, the creator of jobs, is seen as the enemy, that
we're always on the defensive," says John Motley, the NFIB's
chief lobbyist. "At the last meeting they were telling us we
weren't being aggressive enough in supporting challengers."</p>
<p>Taking the gloves off, the NFIB wrote its members in
Michigan last month that Sen. Levin's membership on the
Senate Small Business Committee is "nothing more than a smoke
screen to cover up his lack of support for free enterprise."
The group's literature declares that it is "mad as hell at
Sen. Levin and isn't going to take it anymore."</p>
<p>Sen. Harkin, the NFIB said in a recent letter to its Iowa
members, "does not care how many small firms may be
overburdened or driven out of business because of the
anti-small business policies he supports." The group is
telling its Oklahoma members that Rep. Synar has "voted
against you 80% of the time."</p>
<p>NFIB President John Sloan says the group decided on which
legislators to oppose based on its tally of key votes in
Congress. These included bills to mandate parental leave for
companies with more than 50 employees, raise the minimum
wage, bar discrimination against the disabled and notify
workers in advance of large layoffs and plant closings -- all
legislation the group opposed as unduly increasing government
involvement in small businesses. A 70% pro-small business
rating earns lawmakers the federation's Guardian of Small
Business award, while a score below 40% means the group will
begin supporting their opponents.</p>
<p>The political targets are returning the fire. Sen. Levin
says: "John Sloan's agenda is not a small-business agenda,
but a partisan, political agenda. He uses small business to
influence elections -- mainly for Republicans." He says that
"most Michigan citizens and business" would agree with his
vote for a 60-day notification of plant layoffs and closings.</p>
<p>Rep. Synar says the NFIB is trying to flex its muscle
because it is losing congressional votes on important issues
such as the minimum wage, child care and parental leave. "I
consider those pro-business issues. They don't because
they've taken it on themselves to be the final judge of
what's good for business," Rep. Synar says.</p>
<p>Sen. Harkin's campaign manager, Tim Raftis, accuses the
NFIB of trying to "whip up opposition" to the senator's
sponsorship of the disability-rights bill recently signed
into law by President Bush. "From the reactions we've gotten
back, small-business owners have reacted very negatively to
NFIB's attacks," Mr. Raftis says.</p>
<p>The NFIB's Mr. Sloan defends the federation's action. "The
'80s taught us if you really want to influence policy, work
to get your friends elected," he says. In addition to harsh
rhetoric against incumbents, the NFIB also is contributing
money to challengers, including $9,000 to Rep. Bill Schuette,
a candidate in Michigan's GOP primary to pick Sen. Levin's
opponent; $10,000 to Sen. Harkin's opponent, Rep. Thomas
Tauke; and about $5,000 to Rep. Synar's rival, Jack Ross, a
small-business owner.</p>
<p>Mr. Motley denies that the NFIB is targeting Democrats,
although it usually opposes "Democrats from the labor wing of
the party." Although there aren't any Republicans on the NFIB
list of nine targets, the group's PAC won't challenge such
Democratic senators as Howell Heflin of Alabama or James Exon
of Nebraska.</p>
<p>In the past, the NFIB has challenged a few senators in
small states, such as former Republican Sen. Lowell Weicker
of Connecticut, while using most of its contributions to
support incumbents. This year, however, far more resources
will go to challenging incumbents. The nine target elections
account for almost one-third of the 30 races slated to
receive Free Enterprise PAC contributions. "But our members
don't want us to squander money to make a point," says Mr.
Motley. "There has to be a chance the person will win."</p>
<p>The NFIB also concedes that its campaigns can stumble: The
group supports GOP Sen. Jesse Helms's re-election bid in
North Carolina, but it won't get as heavily involved as in
some other races because it has found that some federation
members love him and others hate him.</p>
<p>Most of the other small-business organizations don't have
PACs. But the Chamber of Commerce, which endorses candidates,
and the Small Business Legislative Council, which doesn't
endorse, support the NFIB's aggressive stance. So does
National Small Business United, which started its own PAC
nine months ago but says it doesn't have enough money to
spend on such an effort now.</p>
<p>"I'm glad they're doing it," says John Satajag, president
of SBLC. "You can't allow people in Washington to use the
rhetoric of supporting small business and never be
accountable."</p>
<p>But the SBLC is "less confrontational as a group," Mr.
Satajag adds. "There are a lot of intangibles that don't show
up in a vote count" such as the one the NFIB uses. He cites
for example a behind-the-scenes effort by Arkansas's
Democratic Sen. David Pryor on the Pepper Commission to
explain the small-business viewpoint on opposing mandated
health benefits to his fellow commissioners.</p>
<p>The NFIB's challenge to incumbents risks creating powerful
enemies. But Larry Sabato, a University of Virginia professor
of government who wrote a book on PACs, says the organization
could win big by bucking the usual practice of backing office
holders.</p>
<p>"One of the least favorable aspects of PACs is their
slavish devotion to incumbents of all types. It really does
suggest prostitution to people," says Prof. Sabato.</p>
<p>"The vast majority of our members," says the NFIB's Mr.
Motley, "don't want anything from government except to be
left alone, and a Congress that doesn't look to small
business every time they want to provide an interest group
with some benefit."</p>
