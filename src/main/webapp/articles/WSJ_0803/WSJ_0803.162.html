	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Help-wanted advertising continued its steady
decline, slipping in June to its lowest level since the
mid-1980s.
   But the Conference Board, which compiles the advertising
index, said it was optimistic that help-wanted advertising
will pick up in the second half as the labor market improves.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The help-wanted index fell to 133 from May's 134 and from
a year-earlier 147. The index, a seasonally adjusted
indicator of hiring plans, uses 1967 as a base of 100.</p>
<p>The independent business research group said it projects a
sustained growth of at least 2% in the gross national product
in the second half, which is expected to boost the job growth
rate, and in turn, advertising for jobs.</p>
<p>"I'm not looking for a huge bounce back, but rather a
subdued one," said Ken Goldstein, an economist with the
Conference Board.</p>
<p>Still, that's good news for job-seekers who have seen
help-wanted ads steadily decline. The index in October
reached a high of 150, but now is at its lowest point since
1985. The index is compiled from surveys of advertising
volume in 51 major newspapers every month. However, the
Conference Board noted that 37% of the newspapers reported
rising want-ad volume, compared with a revised 22% in May and
24% in June 1989.</p>
<p>Much of the improvement in the job market is expected to
come from growth in export-driven industries in the second
half, Mr. Goldstein said. "And it remains a feature of this
outlook that the turnaround is likely to show up earliest in
the Western labor markets and then sweep eastward."</p>
<p>The Conference Board said ad volume rose modestly in four
regions while five regions had declines. Ad volume increased
in the West South Central region, 1.7%; South Atlantic, 0.8%;
New England, 0.5%; and Mountain region, 0.4%.</p>
