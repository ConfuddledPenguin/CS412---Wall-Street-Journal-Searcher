	<p class="article-leader">BUFFALO, N.Y. -- Pratt & Lambert Inc. said soft demand for
adhesives depressed second-quarter net income 7% from a year
earlier, but it expects "reasonably strong" third and fourth
quarters.
   Net fell to $2.3 million, or 40 cents a share, from $2.5
million, or 41 cents a share, a year earlier. The company's
stock repurchase program reduced average shares outstanding
6% for the 1990 period. Sales fell 2% to $65.4 million from
$66.7 million a year ago.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The paint, coatings and adhesives concern declined to make
a specific earnings projection. In the 1989 third quarter the
company earned $1.9 million, or 33 cents a share, on sales of
$63 million.</p>
<p>Chairman R. D. Stevens, Jr. said the modest sales decline
in the latest quarter reflected soft demand for adhesives
used in construction, footwear and recreational vehicles.
"While we don't look for an early recovery in these markets,
we anticipate that strengthening sales during the second half
in other lines will more than eliminate the current
shortfall," Mr. Stevens said.</p>
<p>In the first half, net fell 2% to $3 million, or 52 cents
a share, from $3.9 million, or 62 cents a share, a year
earlier. Sales fell 1% to $124.8 million from $126.1 million.</p>
