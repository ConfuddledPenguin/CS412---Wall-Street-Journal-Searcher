	<p class="article-leader">Nynex Corp. has asked the Federal Communications
Commission for an experimental license to test whether new
digital radio technologies could replace wire links between
homes and telephone company locations.
   The test, which is scheduled to start next year, will be
the first time a U.S. phone company has tried to use digital
radio transmission in its "local loop" to deliver
conventional telephone service in metropolitan areas. Nynex
said a wireless system eventually could improve service at a
significant cost savings. Currently, some phone companies
provide radio links to remote farms, ranches and tiny
mountain communities.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The regional Bell company said it plans to use radio
transmission between New York Telephone facilities and
residential areas of New York City, Boston and White Plains,
N.Y. Nynex said it will test two different digital radio
technologies known as Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA)
and Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA). The digital
technologies increase the capacity of transmissions over
radio frequencies compared with current analog technology.</p>
<p>The FCC generally approves experimental licenses as long
as the tests don't interfere with existing service. But the
agency makes no guarantee that spectrum allocated for a test
of new technology will be made available on a permanent
basis.</p>
<p>"This is along the same lines as our investigation of
fiber optics," said Ken Raymond, director at the Nynex
Science and Technology Center. "Given the population density
of an area and the age of the existing telephone plant, we're
trying to determine whether a wireless application might make
sense."</p>
<p>Mr. Raymond said that later this year the company will ask
equipment suppliers for proposals on building the wireless
system. The company, he said, is trying to find out if
customers would receive better service, or at least the same
service as they currently receive, if the link from their
building or neighborhood to the New York Telephone facility
is made over radio waves. Initially customers should notice
no difference in their phone service, he said. But in 1992,
the company may introduce a portable phone that customers
could use around their neighborhoods, much like a cordless
phone with an extended range of a block or so.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, Nynex announced that its Mobile
Communications Co. unit plans to roll out the nation's first
wireless personal telephone service in Manhattan. That
service will rely on the emerging CDMA technology.</p>
<p>CDMA systems can offer up to 20 times the call-handling
capacity of current cellular telephone systems. The CDMA
systems assign an electronic code to each call signal,
allowing more calls to occupy the same space and be spread
over an entire frequency band.</p>
<p>TDMA, the generally accepted standard for future digital
transmission, places each call signal into a time slot and
transmits it within a single frequency. TDMA offers three to
seven times the capacity of current cellular systems.</p>
<p>Nynex didn't disclose the amount it expects to spend on
the experiment.</p>
