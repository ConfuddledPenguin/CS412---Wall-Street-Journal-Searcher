	<p class="article-leader">It is apparently Herbert R. Northrup's anti-union bias
that leads him to denigrate the proposal of United Air Lines'
unions to buy the company ("Not All Employee Ownership Plans
Will Fly," Manager's Journal, July 2). There can be no other
rational explanation for confusing employee ownership with
employee control, as he does.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Contrary to his unsupported assertion that "union power
and management control" will be "concentrated in the same
hands" at United, a fair reading of the public documents and
statements of the principals involved in the deal leaves no
question that professional management -- not union leadership
-- will run the airline.</p>
<p>In fact, the governance and management structure
contemplated for United is no different than that of scores
of successful public and wholly or partially employee-owned
companies with union or stockholder representatives on the
board.</p>
<p>Basic research would have revealed to Prof. Northrup the
overwhelming evidence that neither union politics nor
short-term planning typifies the management of these firms.
Indeed, at 100% employee-owned companies, exactly the
opposite is true, as it is at any profit-oriented
corporation.</p>
<p>Such a normal corporate approach is all the unions are
seeking. After five years of merger mania, wild
diversification and revolving-door CEOs, the unions saw no
other way to stabilize their company than to buy it. Clearly,
they are not going to destabilize it now by trying to run it.</p>

<p>Mr. Northrup's information on seniority is incorrect.
During the initial Employee Stock Ownership Plans (ESOP)
meetings more than three years ago, we posed this question to
the advisers: "Certainly you do not expect us {Air Line
Pilots Association} to run this company?" They responded:
"No, professionals will do it." It appears to me that Gerald
Greenwald of the United Employee Acquisition Corp. is well on
his way to this end.</p>
<p>If Mr. Northrup had read the history of the Air Line
Pilots Association (ALPA) and been cognizant of the events in
the past 10-plus years at United, he would have known about
management's efforts to displace organized labor from the
property when they should have been aggressively seeking to
make United Airlines the No. 1 carrier.</p>
<p>ESOP is not a pipe dream, but an opportunity for
enthusiastic employees to make a service-oriented company
great; and once they do so, they can share in its success.</p>

<p>---</p>
<p>For Mr. Northrup, putting labor in the pilot's seat is
tantamount to a corporate tailspin -- contradicting the
proponents' assertion that shared responsibility is a virtue.
Both perceptions stem from the way the employees' financial
interest is structured. Shifting a (reported) $2 billion in
employee compensation out of the category of wages and into
that of shareholder revenue acts as a fulcrum in matters of
corporate governance. The question is, in whose favor will
strategic decisions tilt: labor or capital?</p>
<p>To the proponents of employee ownership, this question is
irrelevant. From their viewpoint, compensating employees in
the coin of capital will cause the interests to coalesce,
propelling the firm to superior performance. Both parties
stand to benefit.</p>
<p>But does this interpretation bear scrutiny? On the
superficial level of "employee motivation" it is appealing,
but it overlooks a fundamental point: By accepting an
uncertain capital reward, the employees are taking on a risk
appropriate to the long run -- and giving up a contractually
guaranteed wage appropriate to the need for "income now." To
the extent of this exchange, they will be working at the
behest of management without any certainty of reward.</p>
<p>What happens when a risky investment opportunity confronts
the need for job security and a predictable income stream?
What would be the reaction to introducing an innovative
operating technique that threatens working relationships and
relative rates of pay? At such a juncture, the commonality of
labor and capital interests is likely to undergo a subtle
transformation into an alliance between labor and management
-- in opposition to the shareholder interest in maximizing
residual profits. Management's stake in conducting "business
as usual" will be commensurate with that of the employees.
And decisions that are risk-averse will be justifiable in the
interest of maintaining labor peace.</p>
<p>In other words, on top of the rigid escalation of wage
rates pointed out by Mr. Northrup, this unimaginative
proposal for employee investment imposes an operational
straitjacket. In the competitive environment of a deregulated
airline industry, UAL shareholder complacency would not seem
well-advised.</p>

<p>---</p>
<p>Mr. Northrup writes that the ESOP attempt at United will
fail because, "When union power and management control are
concentrated in the same hands, the result . . . is likely to
lead neither to fiscal responsibility nor to more democratic
participation by individual workers."</p>
<p>Even though the ESOP initiative did not begin until almost
a year later, Mr. Northrup attempts to blame the Air Line
Pilots Association for the failure of the Frontier deal
because in his words, "A merger of United with Frontier would
have added millions to the cost of ALPA taking over control
of United." The insinuation is that ALPA did not want the
Frontier pilots to come over at United pilots' contractual
rates. Exactly the opposite was true. Richard Ferris,
then-chief executive of UAL, did not want the Frontier pilots
to be paid at United contract rates under any circumstances.
This was illustrated in litigation by the former Frontier
pilots in a federal district court, which ruled that one of
the primary reasons for Mr. Ferris's pursuit of Frontier was
to use the Frontier pilots' relatively low pay scale as a
lever in negotiations with the United pilots.</p>
<p>In a completely separate deal less than 12 months prior,
Mr. Ferris, who wanted a smooth merger of the Pan Am Pacific
division into the United operation, acted differently. He had
no objection to an even larger number of former Pan Am pilots
being merged with full seniority and full pay. For most of
these pilots, that action resulted in a 30% raise and a much
higher total cost to United than the Frontier deal would ever
have been.</p>
<p>Mr. Northrup then goes on to say, "The proposed machinists
union agreement also exhibits unbridled union power." He
insinuates that the machinists will set terms and conditions
for nonunion employees and have "carte blanche to organize
the thousands of United's nonunion clerical and reservations
employees." The machinists' union by law has always had the
right to attempt to organize anybody, and employees have the
right to vote yes or no for representation, as the passenger
and reservations agents at United have done several times. As
for setting terms and conditions for nonunion employees, that
is just not true.</p>
<p>The most astounding of Mr. Northrup's statements was that
directors' decisions would be made on a "political basis
rather than on a long-range economic basis, because union
officials must make re-election their prime objective." In
1980, when United was the largest carrier in the U.S., Mr.
Ferris stated that "there is no money in the short-haul
market" (a statement that USAir loves to this day). The UAL
directors heartily embraced Mr. Ferris's philosophy,
resulting in the start of United's slide toward its current
No. 2 position. Was that decision based on long-range
economic planning or a desire to stay in Mr. Ferris's good
graces and enjoy all the perks associated with being a board
member of UAL?</p>
<p>For Mr. Northrup to say business decisions made by
United's management and board will be done so in order to
ensure re-election of its unions' leaders is ludicrous: All
union work by representatives of the Association of Flight
Attendants and ALPA is strictly voluntary -- recall is no
threat to a volunteer.</p>
