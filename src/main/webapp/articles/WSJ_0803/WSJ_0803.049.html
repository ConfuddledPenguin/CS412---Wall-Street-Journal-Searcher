	<p class="article-leader">HONG KONG -- A growing dispute over the importation of
foreign workers has sparked friction between the government
of this British colony and labor unions and has highlighted
an issue that analysts say has at least as much bearing on
Hong Kong's economic future as the well-publicized "brain
drain."
   At the heart of the dispute is the government's proposal
to let in as many as 14,700 foreign workers by year end, a
nearly fivefold increase from a quota of 3,000 last year,
when the government first allowed foreign labor to be
imported. The bulk of this year's quota would be filled by
10,000 "operatives," or low-skilled workers for manufacturing
jobs, while the balance would be divided between 2,700
semi-skilled workers and 2,000 manual laborers.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Government planners argue that the territory is suffering
from a labor shortage and that the importation of foreign
workers is essential if Hong Kong is to maintain its
competitive edge in the world economy. Labor leaders say the
colony's work force can meet current job needs and that the
sharp rise in foreign labor proposed by the government is
partly aimed at undercutting local workers' wages and
benefits.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, some suspect that the government may be trying
to work both sides of the fence by imposing added costs on
employers seeking to hire foreign workers and so encouraging
the employers to try harder to hire locally. One analyst has
suggested establishing a more liberal immigration policy as a
less costly and less bureaucratic alternative to the
government's plan.</p>
<p>While labor and government hurl claims and statistics at
each other, analysts note that even if labor isn't in short
supply at present, a shortage is almost unavoidable in the
next few years and could become acute. The analysts point to
an expected surge in demand for construction workers for huge
airport and seaport projects scheduled to begin in a couple
of years and to demographic trends that are likely to deplete
portions of the work force needed for manual jobs and
manufacturing.</p>
<p>"Our population is aging, and our economy is growing,"
says Richard Wong, director of the Hong Kong Center for
Economic Research, a privately funded research group. Other
analysts note that more young people are choosing the
services sector over the labor end of the work force. "The
labor shortage is not a cyclical phenomenon. It's a long-term
trend," Mr. Wong says.</p>
<p>K.Y. Yeung, secretary of the Education and Manpower
Department, says the government holds with that long-term
view. He says that since 1985, job vacancies have tripled,
with 102,000 reported last year.</p>
<p>Union leaders, while conceding that the government may
eventually need to import labor, decry the decision to do so
now. "The government's timing couldn't be worse," says Lee
Cheuk Yan, a spokesman for the recently formed Action
Committee Against the Import of Labor. "Investment incentive
has declined, and the economic situation is in a low-growth
stage."</p>
<p>Labor leaders note that last year's 3,000-worker quota,
which eventually brought in 2,700 foreign manual laborers,
came when economic forecasts for the colony were rosier than
they are today. Private economists forecast a rise in
unemployment this year to 1.7% from 1.3% in 1989. (Government
figures for the March-May period put unemployment at 1.6%,
compared with 1.5% for the same period last year.) Labor
leaders also point out that the number of reported job
vacancies has declined in recent months, according to
government figures.</p>
<p>Especially troublesome to labor leaders and union
advocates is the sharp jump in the government's proposed
quota for foreign workers this year. "For the government to
expand to 14,700 this year from just 3,000 last year seems
unreasonable," says Y.C. Tam, Legislative Council member and
vice chairman of the Hong Kong Federation of Trade Unions.
"We are worried that once the importation begins, older and
unskilled workers will be affected. And how many workers will
the government import next year?"</p>
<p>"We are well aware of the labor sector's views," says
Stanley Wong, principal assistant secretary in the Education
and Manpower Department. "But the fact remains: We suffer
from a labor shortage, and this is a constraint on Hong
Kong's ability to grow."</p>
<p>Advocates of imported labor also point to the recent spate
of illegal immigrants found working on local construction
sites as evidence of the continuing labor shortage. Union
advocates argue that the immigrants' willingness to work for
lower pay means they are stealing jobs from local workers
rather than filling a need.</p>
<p>In the first half of this year, 13,300 illegal workers
were arrested, twice the number for the same period last
year, according to the government. Increased unemployment in
southern China and news of Hong Kong's huge infrastructural
plans have contributed to the influx of illegal immigrants,
says Ian Strachan, deputy secretary for security. Mr.
Strachan concedes that jailing illegal workers hasn't been an
effective deterrent and that changes in laws to penalize
their employers are under consideration.</p>
<p>However that issue is resolved, analysts say the flood of
illegal workers at least serves as a reminder that, by many
projections, the construction industry's current work force
of nearly 70,000 can't meet future requirements. During the
1990s, the government estimates that more than 20,000
additional workers will be needed just to build the
territory's 127 billion Hong Kong dollar (US$16.36 billion)
airport and port facilities. In addition, the government
plans to construct 527,000 public-housing units by 2001.</p>
<p>Anthony Chan, an economist at the consulting and
publishing firm Business International, forecasts that
building and construction growth will increase by an average
of 2.9% a year in the first half of this decade, compared
with an average of 0.7% a year over the past five years.</p>
<p>Besides disputing the government's claim of a labor
shortage and questioning the timing of the importation plan,
labor leaders argue that the proposal aims to undermine local
gains in wages and benefits. "The labor-importation scheme is
a political decision, not an economic decision, based on the
business sector's demand for cheap labor," says Mr. Lee of
the Action Committee Against the Import of Labor.</p>
