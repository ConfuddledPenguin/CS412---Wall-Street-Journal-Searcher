	<p class="article-leader">MILAN -- Banca Nazionale del Lavoro today declined to say
if it was considering action with respect to the $2.7 billion
it is owed by Iraq.
   A spokesman of Italy's largest commercial bank said only
that it is "attentively following the situation" and will "in
any case abide by any decision the (Italian) government might
take."</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The bank last year was rocked by an international
financial scandal involving nearly $3 billion of irregular
credits to Iraq. The credits were extended by the bank's U.S.
branch in Atlanta without the authorization of its North
American management.</p>
<p>The bank's top management was forced to resign over the
scandal, which is still being investigated by U.S. and
Italian authorities.</p>
