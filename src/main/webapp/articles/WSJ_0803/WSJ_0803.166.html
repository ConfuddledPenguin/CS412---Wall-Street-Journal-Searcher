	<p class="article-leader">LOS ANGELES -- Times Mirror Co. is expected to announce
that it purchased a 50% interest in La Opinion, one of the
nation's largest Spanish-language newspapers.
   A spokeswoman for Times Mirror, which publishes The Los
Angeles Times and other newspapers, said last night that she
couldn't confirm the report. La Opinion is based in Los
Angeles.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The Los Angeles Times already publishes a monthly
Spanish-English section that circulates in Spanish-speaking
neighborhoods. Newspaper executives had been rumored to be
considering making the section weekly.</p>
<p>Besides the Los Angeles Times, Times Mirror publishes
Newsday and New York Newsday, the Baltimore Sun newspapers,
the Hartford (Conn.) Courant, the (Allentown, Pa.) Morning
Call, the (Stamford, Conn.) Advocate and Greenwich (Conn.)
Time. Times Mirror also has interests in cable television,
book publishing and other businesses.</p>
<p>La Opinion was founded Sept. 16, 1926, Mexico's
independence day, by Ignacio Lozano Sr. and has become one of
the largest and one of the most financially successful
Spanish-language dailies in the U.S. Ignacio Lozano Jr.
serves as chairman and editor in chief, while his son and
daughter, Jose Ignacio Lozano and Monica Lozano Centanino,
serve as publisher and managing editor, respectively.</p>
<p>Jose Lozano did not immediately respond to telephone calls
late Thursday.</p>
<p>La Opinion's circulation is about 100,000, nearly all of
which is sold on newsstands. Over the years, it has broadened
its coverage beyond the Mexican-American community to serve
the growing Central American community in the Los Angeles
area.</p>
<p>According to internal Times projections, Southern
California's Hispanic population will swell from about 29% of
the region's population currently to 40% by 2010.</p>
