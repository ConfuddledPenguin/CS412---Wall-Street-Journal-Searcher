	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Moody's Investors Service Inc. affirmed its
current ratings on $21 billion of RJR Nabisco Inc. debt,
despite RJR's plans to overhaul its balance sheet.
   The rating firm also assigned a below-investment-grade
rating, B-3, to the $1.8 billion of convertible preferred
stock RJR plans to issue as part of its $6.9 million
refinancing.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Moody's, which has generally rated RJR's bonds below the
ratings given them by Standard & Poor's Corp., said RJR's
recapitalization should favorably impact the food and tobacco
giant's capital structure over the long term. However, it
said potential increases in sales and excise taxes at the
federal and state levels could hamper RJR's ability to boost
its free cash flow from raising cigarette prices in the U.S.</p>
<p>Moody's said its existing ratings on RJR's debt, most of
which are below investment grade, or junk, "continue to
accurately reflect" the risks RJR faces.</p>
