	<p class="article-leader">CINCINNATI -- U.S. Shoe Corp. said a class-action suit,
filed against the company after it retained Merrill Lynch
Capital Markets to explore sale of all or parts of the
specialty retailer, was conditionally dismissed at the
request of plaintiffs' counsel.
   The suit, brought by shareholders who bought their shares
after Aug. 15, 1988, was dismissed by U.S. District Judge
Carl B. Rubin in Cincinnati.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>James J. Crowe, vice president and general counsel at U.S.
Shoe, said plaintiffs made a number of allegations, including
questioning whether management was serious about selling all
or part of the company.</p>
<p>In April 1989, Merill Lynch pulled out of an agreement to
acquire the company's footwear division in a $422.5-million
leveraged buy-out. Merrill Lynch didn't offer any
explanation, but U.S. Shoe attributed the action to concern
about the junk-bond market and the performance of the
struggling, footwear division.</p>
<p>The court order also includes dimissal of litigation
against various U.S. Shoe directors and officers and against
Merrill Lynch & Co.</p>
