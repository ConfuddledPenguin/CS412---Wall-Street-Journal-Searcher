	<p class="article-leader">Hilton Hotels Corp., prompted by the volatile stock
market, said it temporarily suspended its offering of liquid
yield option notes due in 2005 with a principal amount of
$650 million.
   Barron Hilton, the hotel and casino company's chairman,
said Hilton's stock doesn't reflect the company's value.
Hilton's stock has been pushed down in recent days by
disappointing second-quarter earnings, concerns about the
casino industry and a lackluster travel market.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The offering of zero-coupon notes would result in proceeds
of about $270 million to the Beverly Hills, Calif., company,
which Hilton had said it planned to use for general corporate
purposes. The notes would be subordinated and convertible
into Hilton common. A company spokesman said Hilton will
proceed with the offering if the stock recovers sufficiently.</p>
