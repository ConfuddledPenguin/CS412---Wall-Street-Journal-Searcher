	<p class="article-leader">Iraq's seizure of Kuwait and the Kuwaiti oil industry
seems sure to be felt quickly by Americans. But just how
severely isn't so predictable.
   World oil prices surged yesterday after Iraqi President
Saddam Hussein sent troops rolling across his nation's
100-mile border with Kuwait and swiftly conquered the tiny
sheikdom. The startling move threatens to put oil prices on a
new, higher plane that could continue for years.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"Oil in the teens is, for the foreseeable future,
nostalgia," predicts Shahrokh Nikkhah, a senior vice
president at Prudential-Bache Securities. He sees U.S. crude
oil prices settling into a range of $26 to $27.50 a barrel.
Only weeks ago, U.S. oil was selling as low as $16 a barrel,
and some less-desirable Mideast crudes were $4 a barrel
cheaper than that.</p>
<p>How far oil prices might rise in the near term is a
guessing game. Much depends on the next moves not only by
Iraq and its Persian Gulf neighbors but also by the
industrialized nations that consume most of the world's
petroleum. And most of all, it may depend on the U.S., which
immediately barred Iraqi and Kuwaiti crude -- now in Iraq's
hands -- from American shores.</p>
<p>Erratic as they are, oil prices could of course fall as
fast as they now are climbing. Industry fundamentals really
haven't changed yet; there still is a world oil glut, and the
price increases are largely due to a change in market
psychology.</p>
<p>World oil markets were thrown into turmoil yesterday,
however, with prices surging between $1.50 and $3.50 a barrel
for the day. In the U.S., spot prices of West Texas
Intermediate, the benchmark crude, topped $23 a barrel
yesterday. Another key oil, North Sea Brent, rose from $20.20
a barrel to $22.70.</p>
<p>For Big Oil such news was cause for rejoicing. Though
companies will pay more for any oil they buy, most also drill
for, produce and sell crude themselves. What they get for
that oil will be up just as sharply. Also, refining profits
can improve despite higher raw material costs if end products
like gasoline go up enough.</p>
<p>But government officials in Washington estimate that the
rise in oil prices that has already occurred, if it sticks,
could add a full percentage point to consumer prices over the
next year. It also could cut a half percentage point off the
nation's growth -- a serious blow to an economy growing at an
annual rate of just over one percentage point.</p>
<p>The hit could be felt most acutely by gasoline buyers, who
might have to pay an extra 10 cents or so a gallon, and later
this year by families who heat their homes with oil.
Consistently higher oil prices also would be a heavy blow to
airlines and the chemical industry. They would make life more
difficult for auto makers, both domestic and foreign.</p>
<p>With control of Kuwaiti reserves, Iraq now has the power
to drive up oil prices, according to Philip Verleger, senior
fellow at the Institute for International Economics. "They
can easily make a $25-a-barrel price happen," he believes.
"They could even make $30 a barrel."</p>
<p>For some time, however, the impact of any Iraqi moves will
be softened somewhat by current unusually high levels of oil
stocks. Mr. Verleger says stocks total about 1.65 billion
barrels, compared with the normal 1.5 billion. Moreover, the
U.S. strategic petroleum reserve, squirreled away in
underground salt domes in Texas and Louisiana, now is big
enough to carry the country through any temporary supply
disruptions.</p>
<p>However, some 60% to 70% of the oil imported into the U.S.
is priced on the basis of spot-market quotes, and a surge in
spot prices would be felt quickly.</p>
<p>There's no denying American vulnerability. With domestic
oil production slipping gradually but inexorably, about half
of U.S. oil supplies are now imported. In the first five
months of this year, Iraq and Kuwait combined were the
fifth-largest suppliers to the U.S., after Saudi Arabia,
Venezuela, Nigeria and Canada, according to the American
Petroleum Institute. Iraq provided about 610,000 barrels a
day, and Kuwait about 121,000. Together, that was about 9% of
U.S. oil imports. OPEC as a whole provided about 54%.</p>
<p>How tough things get for U.S. oil users will depend
largely on how hard a line the U.S. takes against Iraq and
Iraq-controlled Kuwait. Many oil traders spent much of
yesterday trying to figure out how new U.S. import curbs will
be implemented. "We're walking around here saying, `stay
calm, stay calm, stay calm,'" says Gerard Vetromile, vice
president of crude trading for Chevron Corp.</p>
<p>President Bush's order is already causing temporary
dislocations. Mr. Vetromile says Chevron took title to some
Iraqi crude two weeks ago, but the oil hasn't yet arrived at
the company's giant Pascagoula, Miss., refinery. "If the U.S.
government says we can't take that crude, it could create a
refining problem for us by next week," Mr. Vetromile says.</p>
<p>American Petrofina is already stuck. It has four million
barrels of Iraqi crude at sea heading toward its refinery in
Port Arthur, Texas. One tanker carrying 500,000 barrels is
due today. "We've been told by the customs people that we
cannot unload that crude," says Ron Haddock, chief executive.
He says the company has only a three-week supply of crude on
hand and is being forced to hunt for other supplies.</p>
<p>Sen. Bennett Johnston, a Louisiana Democrat, predicts that
members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries
may be intimidated by Iraq into sticking to their production
quotas. "The implications for this country are stark," he
says. "OPEC discipline has now been insured by the point of a
gun."</p>
<p>At a joint news conference in Colorado yesterday
afternoon, President Bush and British Prime Minister Margaret
Thatcher didn't address directly the question of whether the
industrial nations would engage in a full-scale embargo of
oil from Iraq and Kuwait.</p>
<p>Any such oil embargo would be far different from that in
1973. Then, it was producers who struck against consumers. A
1990 embargo, should it occur, would be a consumers' boycott.
That this could even be contemplated probably is a tribute to
the stored supplies of the Western nations, as well as Iraq's
isolation from the rest of the world, including Arab
neighbors.</p>
<p>However, the upshot in the marketplace of such an
eventuality could match that of the past -- surging oil
prices. And whether the U.S., Europe and Japan could deal
more effectively with such a surge remains to be seen.</p>
<p>If America's embargo isn't widely observed, it would mean
little. Oil is a fungible commodity, and its ownership can
easily be disguised. And as of last night, there wasn't any
indication that the U.S. would press other nations hard to go
along.</p>
<p>But even oil prices modestly above current levels could do
some damage. "Our economy would change from a growing to a
declining economy by the fourth quarter," says Donald
Ratajczak, economic forecaster at Georgia State University.</p>
<p>Michael Boskin, the chairman of the President's Council of
Economic Advisers, attempted to play down the effects in
testimony yesterday morning on Capitol Hill. A 25% rise in
oil prices would have "some deleterious impact on our
economy," he acknowledged, but he argued that "our economy
today is much better able to absorb modest price increases."
He noted in an interview later that companies now have more
flexibility to switch to natural gas and other forms of
energy.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Rep. Toby Roth, a Wisconsin Republican, urged
fellow lawmakers "to focus an eagle eye" on what oil
companies do about pricing.</p>
<p>Whatever the oil companies plan to do, people ranging from
economists to truckers are scrambling to figure out how to
cope with suddenly unpredictable oil prices. And some
service-station operators are already talking about
gasoline-price gouging -- by their competitors.</p>
<p>"There's going to be some gouging out there, you can be
sure," says Sasan Faraji, manager of Fenway Park Exxon in
Boston. He says he won't raise his prices unless his own
costs go up. But a nearby competitor, whom he won't name, has
just added another 5/10ths of a cent to his prices, he
alleges. "All this just hit us this morning," he says.
"People are still trying to figure out where Kuwait is -- or
was."</p>
<p>Gasoline prices in California have just gone up five cents
a gallon, though apparently the rise is due to a gas-tax
increase aimed at expanding mass transit and improving road
maintenance. Stephen R. Shelton, executive director of the
Southern California Service Station Association, expects
retail gasoline prices to increase, but not for at least 30
days because of current ample inventory.</p>
<p>Eventually, though, motorists may take a heavy hit.
Generally, each $1 increase in a barrel of crude could
translate into about 2.5 cents a gallon at the pump. Thus, a
sustained $4-a-barrel increase would drive gasoline up almost
10 cents a gallon. Already, American Petrofina says it is
raising gasoline prices by a nickel a gallon. Among those
feeling the effects of this would be the auto industry.</p>
<p>The Iraqi action catches foreign and domestic auto makers
in the middle of a move toward more powerful, less fuel
efficient cars spurred by a relative decline in gasoline
prices during the late 1980s. New-car fuel efficiency has
fallen two years in a row, after rising steadily since 1978.
Japanese auto makers contributed heavily to this decline,
introducing new models with powerful V-6 and V-8 engines.
Now, auto makers face the risk of a consumer shift in buying
patterns.</p>
<p>A 10-to-20-cent-a-gallon rise in gasoline prices might not
have much impact, "but 50 {cents} would," says Bennett E.
Bidwell, chairman of Chrysler's automotive operations. Adds a
Toyota spokesman: "We figure that to have any effect on
sales, it would have to be at least a quarter."</p>
<p>If consumers do react to this latest oil problem by
returning to smaller, more efficient cars, Japanese auto
makers seem best-positioned -- much as they were more than a
decade ago. The average fuel economy of cars sold by Toyota
Motor Corp. in the U.S. is 31.8 miles to the gallon, down
from Toyota's 33-mile-a-gallon average a year ago but still
better than the domestic average of 26.9 miles to the gallon.
Nissan's average is 30.8 miles a gallon.</p>
<p>General Motors Corp. and Ford Motor Co., despite major
advances in fuel economy, still rely heavily on full-size,
V-6 and V-8 cars for their U.S. profits. Chrysler Corp.'s
highest-profit vehicles, minivans and Jeep Cherokees, average
less than 20 miles a gallon in city driving.</p>
<p>As voracious consumers of fuel, airlines will feel the
higher prices rapidly. The airline industry estimates that
every penny rise in the price-per-gallon of jet fuel adds
$150 million to annual costs.</p>
<p>"We're on our third bottle" of antacid, says Jack Zaves,
who manages the fuel needs of American Airlines, which uses
some 2.4 billion gallons of jet fuel a year. "How do you
plan?"</p>
<p>UAL Corp., the parent of United Air Lines, has said that
every penny change in the price-per-gallon of jet fuel causes
an approximately $22.5 million change in United's annual fuel
bill. The huge carrier is accustomed to major changes. Its
average cost-per-gallon last year was 64 cents, up from 56
cents in 1988 but far below the 83 cents in 1985. Most of
United's fuel is provided under contracts with major U.S. oil
refiners, but it also purchases minor volumes of fuel on the
spot market at Gulf Coast and New York Harbor locations and
offshore from the Mideast.</p>
<p>"Fuel surcharges are imminent," promises Dean Cannon,
president of Cannon Express Corp., a Springdale, Ark.,
trucking company. Fuel accounts for about 22% of his
operating costs, and Mr. Cannon says that by noon yesterday
it is was already going up. He says he plans to send a letter
today to warn about 500 of his customers of higher rates.</p>
<p>The threat of possibly sharply higher oil prices is
already being felt all around the industrial world. The
inflationary potential is a big problem for countries such as
Britain, Italy and Spain, which are already struggling to
wring out stubbornly high inflation. For countries fighting
to stave off a recession -- Britain as well as the U.S., for
example -- that problem has suddenly become worse, too. Even
under the threat that slowdowns will turn into recessions,
central bankers will find it more difficult to reduce
interest rates while climbing oil prices are pushing up
inflation.</p>
<p>On the other hand, an excessive climb in oil prices would
depress world-wide consumption. "Forces like recessions come
into play," says Tom Burns, a Chevron economist. "So demand
goes down a bit. This has been of extreme concern to some
OPEC producers."</p>
<p>Moreover, higher prices would encourage the U.S. and other
non-OPEC countries to expand oil development that isn't
profitable when prices are lower. "Longer-term, oil that is
today marginal or not economic suddenly becomes considerably
more attractive," Mr. Burns says. He cites the expansion of
enhanced-recovery projects in existing U.S. fields. In
addition, West African and Latin American countries could
raise their oil output if prices climb. The Soviet Union and
Mexico still have a lot of untapped oil.</p>
<p>Previous price surges, in 1973 and 1979, ended for
precisely such reasons. Consumption declined for several
years, partly because of widespread conservation. And
supplies expanded as oil companies stepped up development of
new areas such as Alaska's North Slope and the North Sea.
Beginning in 1980, OPEC, for the first time in its history,
lost market share.</p>
<p>The economic jolts from higher oil prices could be
widespread, however:</p>
<p>-- For West Germany and Japan, the expected rise in oil
prices may well be the last straw that pushes central bankers
to increase interest rates. Tokyo stocks entered a tailspin,
amid expectations of higher inflation and a move by the Bank
of Japan to raise the discount rate it charges on loans to
financial institutions.</p>
<p>-- For Spain and Italy, higher oil prices are damaging.
"Italy is very reliant on external supplies of energy," says
Eugenio Namor, an economist at San Paolo Bank in Turin. He
predicts that recent reductions in inflation will be
reversed.</p>
<p>-- For struggling East European states, Iraq's invasion
may make it all the more painful to wean themselves from
subsidized oil purchases from the Soviet Union. Not only will
they have to pay hard currency for oil and gas but also
higher prices than expected just last week.</p>
<p>-- For Sub-Saharan Africa, a higher cost of oil imports
could cut deeply into hoped-for economic growth. With
interest rates stuck at lofty levels or rising, the cost of
capital also will be a constraint.</p>
<p>The specter of higher energy prices especially worries
Japan. Surging oil prices in the 1970s triggered severe
inflation and forced companies to restructure their
manufacturing operations drastically.</p>
<p>This time, Norbert Walter, chief economist at Deutsche
Bank AG, predicts another response from Japan: "an export
offensive in Europe." He reasons that with the
already-sluggish U.S. economy hit by higher energy costs,
Europe will be the one major market to which Japan can turn.
Japan's financial institutions, however, may well concentrate
their investments at home, at least for several months.</p>
<p>In any event, one clear winner is Mexico. Each $1-a-barrel
increase in oil prices raises its revenues about $500 million
a year, bolstering its balance of payments at a time when it
is under pressure.</p>
<p>Mexico will face its own frustrations, though. Petroleos
Mexicanos S.A., the state oil monopoly and the world's
fifth-largest oil company, has limited room to increase
production and take advantage of higher prices. Since
Mexico's debt crisis exploded in 1982, public investment in
the oil company, known as Pemex, has plunged about 75%.</p>
<p>"I don't think there's anything significant they could do
in the next three months or so to raise production," says
George Baker, a Berkeley, Calif., oil consultant who follows
the company. "Fundamentally, they're at a full-production
schedule now and have been for a year."</p>
