	<p class="article-leader">SEATTLE -- The National Labor Relations Board said it will
charge Nordstrom Inc. with several violations of federal
labor law in its handling of a dispute with the United Food &
Commercial Workers union if the retailer doesn't agree to
settle the case by Aug. 10.
   The labor board already has charged Nordstrom with
violations stemming from a yearlong dispute with United Food
& Commercial Workers locals 1001 and 367. Contract talks with
the two locals, whose pacts covering Seattle-area salespeople
expired last year, broke down after the company proposed
making union membership optional.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>In the latest case, Larry McCargar, assistant to the labor
board's regional director in Seattle, said the agency found
merit to union allegations that Nordstrom illegally assisted
some employees' efforts to decertify the union, disciplined
and discriminated against employees who supported the union
and promised employees additional benefits if the unions are
decertified, among other things.</p>
<p>A spokesman for Nordstrom said the company is "not
agreeing with what the NLRB has said, but we are going to
move to settle."</p>
