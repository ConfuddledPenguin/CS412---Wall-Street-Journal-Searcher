	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- Rep. Fortney Stark charged that Health and
Human Services Secretary Louis Sullivan, who is black, is "a
disgrace to his profession and his race" because of his
opposition to national health care and abortion.
   Dr. Sullivan demanded an apology from the California
Democrat, who made his remarks twice yesterday, once in front
of cameras. "I wish he had the guts to make his comments to
my face," Dr. Sullivan said in a statement. "It's too bad
ultraliberals like Pete Stark haven't progressed to the point
that they can accept the independent thinking of a black man
that does not conform to their own stereotyped views."</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The White House issued a statement saying that Rep.
Stark's "bigoted assault on the integrity and ability of
Secretary Sullivan is an affront to the Congress and the
Democratic party. We trust that the Democratic party and its
chairman, Ron Brown, will disassociate themselves from
Congressman Stark's ill-tempered and shameful remarks." Mr.
Brown is also black.</p>
<p>Mr. Stark, a leader on health issues, is pushing a costly
national health plan that the Bush administration opposes.
"The people who are going to suffer because of the policies
he's blindly accepting from the administration are the
minorities in this country," Mr. Stark said of Dr. Sullivan.</p>
<p>Mr. Stark made his remarks at a time when racial tensions
in the capital already are unusually high because of the drug
trial of District of Columbia Mayor Marion Barry. Some of the
mayor's supporters assert that the charges against him were
racially motivated.</p>
