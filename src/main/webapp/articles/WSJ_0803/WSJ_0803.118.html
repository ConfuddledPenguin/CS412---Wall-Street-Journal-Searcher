	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Stock prices dropped sharply amid the heaviest
trading since last October's "minicrash" as the market
responded to news of Iraq's invasion of Kuwait.
   Market players flocked to buy a broad range of energy
stocks as oil prices surged following the invasion, while
precious-metals and defense issues also attracted buying
interest.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>But the Dow Jones Industrial Average went down 34.66
points to 2864.60 despite a strong showing by its oil
components, and the recent slump in consumer and other growth
stocks accelerated.</p>
<p>Three oil issues -- Exxon, Chevron and Texaco -- lifted
the industrial average by a total of more than 11 points. USX
and Du Pont, which also have substantial oil operations,
recorded modest gains as well.</p>
<p>Brisk activity in those and other oil stocks boosted
volume on the New York Stock Exchange to 253,090,000 shares
from 176,810,000 Wednesday. The latest total was the highest
since 416.3 million shares were traded last Oct. 13, when the
industrial average plummeted more than 190 points.</p>
<p>This time around, the U.S. followed the lead of overseas
stock markets, which dropped sharply in response to reports
of the invasion. For example, the Nikkei index of 225
Japanese issues dropped 1.9% and the Financial Times-Stock
Exchange 100-Share Index, a measure of prices on the London
stock market, fell 1.5%.</p>
<p>On Wall Street, the developments in the Middle East
further unsettled a market that has been unnerved recently by
disappointments in second-quarter corporate earnings reports
and indications that the latest union-led buy-out offer for
UAL might fail to get financing.</p>
<p>"We were in a nervous market before," said Thomas
Callahan, senior vice president of U.S. equities at Yamaichi
International (America), "and now we've had something that
obviously caught a lot of people by surprise."</p>
<p>In the sell-off that followed, declining stocks outpaced
advancers on the Big Board by 1,211 to 464. Standard & Poor's
500-Stock Index tumbled 4.04 to 351.48, the New York Stock
Exchange Composite Index dropped 2.02 to 192.36 and the Dow
Jones Equity Market Index fell 3.86 to 325.63.</p>
<p>Prices fell sharply from the opening bell and then tumbled
to their session lows at late morning amid bursts of
futures-related program selling related to stock-index
arbitrage. The industrial average hit bottom just about the
2850 mark with a loss of more than 47 points.</p>
<p>Chevron, which went up 1 5/8 to 80 3/8 on Big Board
composite volume of 12 million shares, and Texaco, which
climbed 2 5/8 to 66 5/8 on 6.2 million shares, were one-two
on the Big Board's list of most active issues.
Dividend-related trading by institutions boosted the activity
in both stocks.</p>
<p>Exxon rose 1 1/8 to 53 1/4 as four million shares were
traded. USX, the parent company of Marathon Oil, added 1/2 to
34 5/8 on 3.2 million shares; Du Pont, the parent of Conoco,
rose 3/8 to 41 3/8 on 1.2 million.</p>
<p>Composite volume in five other oil issues exceeded two
million shares each: Mobil, which advanced 1 7/8 to 67 1/4;
Unocal, which climbed 2 1/8 to 33 1/4, Phillips Petroleum,
which rose 7/8 to 29 5/8; Occidental Petroleum, which rose
3/8 to 26 1/4, and Amoco, which added 2 7/8 to 58 1/4.</p>
<p>Global Marine added 1/8 to 5 1/4 on 3.4 million shares.
Elsewhere in the oil-services sector, Schlumberger tacked on
2 1/4 to 68 3/4, Halliburton went up 1 3/4 to 57 3/8 and
Baker Hughes rose 1 3/8 to 33 3/8.</p>
<p>Trading in precious-metals and defense stocks wasn't
nearly as brisk, although the Iraqi action served as a
catalyst for solid performances from both groups.</p>
<p>Among gold stocks, a traditional hedge against inflation,
Battle Mountain Gold added 1/4 to 12 1/8, Newmont Mining
climbed 1 1/4 to 50 7/8, Hecla Mining rose 1/4 to 12 1/8 and
ASA Ltd. gained 3/4 to 49 1/2. In the defense sector, which
has been under pressure recently in anticipation of cutbacks
in U.S. military spending, Raytheon gained 2 3/4 to 60 3/4,
General Dynamics gained 1 1/2 to 28 1/4, Martin Marietta rose
5/8 to 38 5/8 and McDonnell Douglas climbed 1 to 44.</p>
<p>Oil-refining stocks were an exception to the energy
sector's rally. Sun Co. lost 1 3/8 to 35 1/2, Mapco fell 1
3/8 to 43 and Ashland Oil went down 1 5/8 to 32 1/4; Dean
Witter Reynolds analyst Eugene Nowak recommended that
investors avoid the issues, as higher oil prices raise
refining costs.</p>
<p>Although the market avoided a steep drop, further weakness
can be expected based on the increase in oil prices, said
Suresh L. Bhirud, chief investment strategist at Oppenheimer
& Co.</p>
<p>"The risk here is that the price of oil can go up much
higher than people are willing to believe," Mr. Bhirud said,
putting further pressure on a world economy that already is
showing the strain of sluggish growth and rising inflation.</p>
<p>For stocks, the results of such a move in oil could be
what he labeled as "a prolonged, painful Chinese torture" in
which share prices go down gradually rather than plunging and
then rebounding immediately, as was the case in the
"minicrash" last October.</p>
<p>"The key thing is that you've taken a lot of bullish
arguments out of the game," Mr. Bhirud said, including the
possibility that interest rates will head lower and that
inflationary pressure won't become excessive.</p>
<p>But Edward M. Kerschner, chairman of the investment policy
committee at PaineWebber, said the "war dance" in response to
the Iraq-Kuwait hostilities hasn't changed his opinion that
the Dow industrials will remain within 10% on either side of
2900 in the next few months.</p>
<p>The Dow Jones index of casino stocks plunged 7.3%, more
sharply than any other industry group. Circus Circus
Enterprises set the pace for the downturn by plunging 6 3/4
to 54 1/2 in active trading; the stock had surged to a
52-week high of 70 7/8 in mid-July.</p>
<p>Consumer stocks were generally hit hard in the sell-off as
the sharp increase in oil prices heightened concerns about
the economic outlook. Eli Lilly went down 2 to 82 5/8 on 2.6
million shares, while Philip Morris retreated 1 1/4 to 46
5/8, Coca-Cola Co. dropped 1 1/4 to 44 1/8, PepsiCo slid 1
1/8 to 76,  Procter & Gamble tumbled 3 1/4 to 82 1/4, Merck
dropped 2 5/8 to 87 1/4, Bristol-Myers Squibb fell 2 3/4 to
62 1/4 and Colgate-Palmolive lost 2 3/8 to 68 3/8.</p>
<p>Shares of the Big Three auto makers slumped in brisk
trading. General Motors fell 1 1/2 to 43 7/8, Ford Motor went
down 1 1/4 to 39 7/8 and Chrysler lost 5/8 to 14 3/8.</p>
<p>Fund American soared 11 5/8 to 49 3/4 on 2.7 million
shares after agreeing to sell its main subsidiary, Fireman's
Fund Insurance, to West Germany's Allianz. The company said
it plans to spend more than $800 million on a self-tender
offer or distribution after completing the sale and to
liquidate the rest of its assets over a three- to five-year
period.</p>
<p>But other insurance stocks generally fell along with the
market. American International Group lost 3 to 71 and Capital
Holding dropped 1 to 46 3/4 after their second-quarter
earnings reports, while General Re fell 3 to 82 7/8, American
General slid 1 to 45 and Unum dropped 7/8 to 53 3/4.</p>
<p>The American Stock Exchange Market Value Index dropped
1.15 to 352.15 despite gains in oil and gold issues, both
heavily weighted in the index. Volume totaled 20,300,000
shares.</p>
