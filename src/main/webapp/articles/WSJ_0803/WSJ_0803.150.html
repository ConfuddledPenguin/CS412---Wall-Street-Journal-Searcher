	<p class="article-leader">Iraq's Saddam Hussein has redrawn the map of the Middle
East, and underscored how difficult it is for the superpowers
-- even when they agree -- to control world events in the
post-Cold War era.
   The Iraqi president already had the Arab world's biggest
army. Now, his lightning conquest of Kuwait has in one stroke
doubled the oil under his control -- to fully 20% of the
world's reserves.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>But while his invasion of neighboring oil fields and
territory may ease Iraq's immediate economic and strategic
concerns, the political fallout from his aggression has
clearly isolated Mr. Hussein in the international community.
The U.S., the Soviet Union and numerous other countries
swiftly condemned the invasion, and a few, including the U.S.
and France, froze Iraqi and Kuwaiti assets on their
territory.</p>
<p>Mr. Hussein's actions smashed any traditional notion of
Arab brotherhood governing politics in the region. His attack
humbled Egypt, which had sought a negotiated end to tensions
between Iraq and Kuwait, and threatened to push Syria closer
to the moderate Arab camp. It left Saudi Arabia, with its
infant military, particularly anxious about Mr. Hussein's
further designs.</p>
<p>"I think he {Mr. Hussein} has finally convinced everyone
that he is incorrigible and a threat to regional peace," says
Michael Dewar, deputy director of the International Institute
for Strategic Studies in London.</p>
<p>Still, most notable in the events in the Mideast this week
is the influence -- or the lack thereof -- exercised by the
superpowers.</p>
<p>No longer is there a predictable East-West world order to
guide U.S. responses to world events. A new, more complicated
order reigns. The inability of the Bush administration to do
much about the Iraqi invasion shows just how difficult and
frustrating it will be for the U.S. to control events.</p>
<p>"We've ended the Cold War and we've now begun the new era,
the war over resources," suggests Judith Kipper, an analyst
at the Brookings Institution. "This is over money and oil."</p>
<p>There are few attractive American responses. The American
military presence in the region -- eight warships in the
Persian Gulf and the aircraft carrier Independence and its
contingent in the distant Indian Ocean -- isn't an adequate
force to roll back Iraq's enormous, war-hardened army.</p>
<p>President Bush initially said that military intervention
wasn't under consideration, though Kuwait had asked the U.S.
to send troops. Later yesterday, he declined to rule various
options either in or out.</p>
<p>Even if the U.S. wanted to move to prevent Iraq's forces
from moving farther, into Saudi Arabia, the task would be
difficult. The U.S. would have to send a large chunk of its
European-based ground forces and their support equipment to
the kingdom. That could take weeks and would require a
request from a Saudi government that wants American
protection but always has been reluctant to ask for it
publicly. President Bush and Saudi King Fahd talked by phone
for half an hour last night and discussed "possible options
for dealing with the situation," the White House said.</p>
<p>"In the past neither the Kuwaitis nor Saudis have been
inclined to allow American bases or forces on their soil,"
says former Energy and Defense Secretary James Schlesinger.
"I think that it would be desirable from a Saudi point of
view and an American point of view that there be an American
presence."</p>
<p>The U.S. also doesn't have attractive nonmilitary options
for stopping Iraq. President Bush yesterday banned most
transactions with Iraq, which Treasury officials said include
the import of Iraqi and Kuwaiti oil. The House of
Representatives voiced its support by voting to cut off all
trade with Iraq.</p>
<p>But a boycott by the U.S. alone will be meaningless. Iraq
can find other buyers for its oil. Only a boycott with wide
international participation would be effective, and in the
past, such boycotts have collapsed because some countries
inevitably buy from -- or sell to -- the target country.</p>
<p>The Bush administration yesterday was contacting its
allies, urging them to emulate its economic sanctions against
Iraq. But there were few signs that the State Department was
actively lobbying yet for an international embargo of Iraqi
and Kuwaiti oil, which by some estimates could cause world
oil prices to double.</p>
<p>President Bush and British Prime Minister Margaret
Thatcher suggested at a joint press conference in Colorado,
where they held a previously scheduled meeting, that
international restrictions on the purchase of Iraqi oil might
be considered in the United Nations Security Council within
days. (The Council yesterday condemned the Iraqi invasion.)</p>
<p>This isn't the first time that a Third World conflict has
spun out of the reach of the superpowers, of course. But
Iraq's move may signal that such uncontrollable crises will
become more of a rule than an exception. Unlike at times in
the past, the U.S. and the Soviet Union can't negotiate over
the heads of their regional proxies to reach a settlement, as
they did in the 1973 Middle East war.</p>
<p>Rather, Iraq's Saddam Hussein represents precisely the
kind of Third World leader -- independent-minded and armed
far beyond what would have seemed possible just a few years
back -- who may pose the clearest threat to international
stability in the 1990s. The shift in the longstanding world
order may well embolden such leaders to act on their own to
help shape the new global power structure. "Without the
East-West alignments, countries feel freer to move," says Ms.
Kipper.</p>
<p>As if to underscore the irrelevance of the superpowers
during events in the Mideast Thursday morning, the news of
Iraq's invasion reached Secretary of State James Baker and
Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze while they were
meeting in remote Siberia. Mr. Shevardnadze didn't know of
the attack until Mr. Baker told him. Later, the Soviet Union
announced it would cease arm sales to Iraq.</p>
<p>Another option under discussion last night would require
far more than simple Soviet and American action. Officials of
several nations have discussed the possibility of strangling
Iraqi oil sales by choking off export routes. That would
require cutting off two large pipelines, one which runs from
Iraq through Saudi Arabia, another that runs through Turkey.
It would also require the U.S. Navy to block Iraqi shipments
from the Persian Gulf.</p>
<p>Such a blockade might be feasible, some diplomats say, in
light of the widespread dissatisfaction with Iraq. But it
would call for strong political resolve from all sides,
including the Arab League, which, as of late last night,
hadn't taken a stand on the invasion despite Kuwait's demand
that it send an Arab liberation force. Many in the League,
which has long been a disunified and ineffective
organization, fear Iraq's military might themselves. In fact,
most Arab leaders, at least initially, failed to either
condemn or condone the attack. Mr. Bush said he is being
cautioned to go slow by Arab leaders such as Egypt's Hosni
Mubarak.</p>
<p>With no clear, practical steps to take, the U.S. and the
Soviet Union resorted to dramatic political symbolism. Mr.
Baker was flying to Moscow late yesterday to issue a joint
statement criticizing the invasion with Mr. Shevardnadze.</p>
<p>The Bush administration has known for more than a week
that an Iraqi invasion was possible. Some members of Congress
criticized the White House for failing to head off the Iraqi
move. Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Claiborne
Pell, for example, called Mr. Hussein "the Adolf Hitler of
the Middle East," and said if "the administration had acted
earlier, Hussein may have gotten the message that his
lawlessness wouldn't be tolerated."</p>
<p>But the White House has been reluctant to mount a
pre-emptive move without an explicit request from the nations
involved. The best response the U.S. could muster was a
modest, hastily assembled joint naval exercise with the
United Arab Emirates. The Iraqis were evidently not
impressed.</p>
<p>"We will turn Kuwait into a graveyard if any outside power
intervenes," Mr. Hussein said after claiming that Iraqi
troops had entered Kuwait at the request of a revolutionary
group that had overthrown the government. Asked for evidence
of this, Iraqi officials declined to comment.</p>
<p>Thursday's invasion gives back to Mr. Hussein two assets
he squandered in his eight-year war with Iran: oil wealth and
access to the sea. By raising the price of oil and possibly
securing some or all of Kuwait's vast fields he will be able
to free himself of a crippling war debt estimated at over $50
billion.</p>
<p>That could free Mr. Hussein to pursue his grander regional
ambitions. Among them: settling scores with Syria, and
championing the cause of Palestinians, particularly in
Israeli-occupied lands. Earlier this year, fearing an Israeli
strike against a vast military buildup that has made Iraq the
world's biggest arms buyer over the last five years, Mr.
Hussein threatened to "scorch half of Israel" with chemical
weapons if it attacked him.</p>
<p>"Israel is his target. He's preparing himself better,"
contends Ofra Benja, an Iraq specialist at the Dayan
Institute in Tel Aviv. "But the danger is there for everybody
-- Saudi Arabia, Jordan, Syria."</p>
<p>Indeed, until two weeks ago, Kuwait seemed low on the list
of Iraq's potential enemies. The emirate bankrolled Iraq
through its war with Iran, lending between $10 billion and
$20 billion, and pumped oil on Iraq's behalf. It also has
generously funded the Palestinian cause and is home to some
300,000 Palestinian refugees.</p>
<p>But Iraq never accepted Kuwait's borders, opposing the
state's independence from Britain in 1961 and engaging in
armed clashes with it in 1973 and 1976. Resentment grew as
Kuwait, with only 750,000 nationals, became ever richer.</p>
<p>Explains a diplomat from a nearby Gulf emirate: "Arabs
have been asking why should a power like Iraq have to put up
with borders that were a colonial invention? It is possible
to see all these countries -- the United Arab Emirates,
Bahrain, Qatar -- as imperialist creations that allow the
West to play one against the other in the interests of cheap
oil."</p>
<p>In Iraq, Mr. Hussein was faced with a postwar economy
ravaged by 45% inflation, lack of foreign exchange and
shortages of even the most basic foodstuffs. Mr. Hussein had
little experience as a peacetime manager: Since becoming
president in 1979 he has been constantly at war, with Iran,
his own Kurdish minority and, by proxy, with Syria in
Lebanon. Yet another campaign -- this time against weak,
oil-rich neighbors -- must have seemed an easy way to divert
attention from domestic ills.</p>
<p>Indirectly, the invasion of Kuwait also is a way for Mr.
Hussein to thumb his nose at the small state's ally, America.
The U.S. has disappointed Mr. Hussein by not pouring aid into
his country after the war. More important, Iraqi isolation
has been deepened by Western criticism of its brutal domestic
policies and bully-boy tactics abroad. Last Saturday, in an
interview with this newspaper, an Iraqi diplomat threatened:
"If you want Saddam Hussein to invade Kuwait, just keep up
that boycott talk in the U.S."</p>
<p>Mr. Hussein has attacked a sophisticated city-state, in
which even student leftists drive gold Mercedeses with car
phones and "I love democracy" bumper stickers. Kuwait's
citizens enjoyed far more rights than Mr. Hussein's bitterly
repressed population of 14 million. Kuwait's press is among
the freest in the Arab world, and its well-educated
population has been agitating for a more open political
system, although calls for the overthrow of the al-Sabah
family, which has ruled Kuwait since 1752, were extremely
rare.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, Iraq claimed it had come to the aid of
"youth in Kuwait" to end "the rule of corruption and
terrorism exercised by the clique of the former government."
Iraqi troops and tanks poured across the border Thursday in a
blitzkreig assault as warplanes and helicopters bombed
Kuwait's airport and royal palaces. The surprise assault met
sporadic resistance from the greatly outgunned Kuwaiti
forces, an estimated 200 of whom were killed or wounded by
Thursday afternoon. Among the reported dead was one of the
brothers of the Kuwaiti emir. Others of the royal family are
reported to have fled to safety in Saudi Arabia. The 3,000 to
4,000 Americans living in Kuwait didn't appear to be in
danger, although a few U.S. oil workers apparently were moved
by Iraqi troops.</p>
<p>Kuwait's future remains unclear. Some 60% of Kuwait's
population is imported labor, principally from poorer Arab
countries and the Indian subcontinent. These people don't
have the vote or a large share in the state's wealth, and
could be manipulated by Iraqi largess to support a puppet
government. Kuwait's Shiite minority also may be won over
with promises of a greater share of power.</p>
<p>If Iraq stays in Kuwait, it will gain control of numerous
oil refineries and almost 4,000 Kuwaiti service stations in
Europe, which market gasoline under the Q8 brand. Iraq, until
now, has had to stick to crude-oil production alone because
it lacked the funds to buy such "downstream" facilities
abroad. With its greater control over OPEC production under
current quotas, Iraq also would have a commanding say over
oil pricing. And it will gain a new shipping channel. Iraq's
only other outlet -- the Shatt al-Arab waterway -- is choked
with sunken vessels from the Iran-Iraq war, and remains the
subject of a territorial dispute with Iran.</p>
<p>While Western countries condemn the invasion, and Arab
diplomats scramble to defuse tensions, Kuwaitis themselves
wonder whether their country will ever be the same. "He has a
giant piggy bank in his hands. Why should he give it back?"
asks Naser al-Marri, an official with the Kuwaiti Investment
Authority, now working in London. "He won't, unless the world
makes him."</p>
<p>In the short term, then, it seems Mr. Hussein has gambled
again and won. But in the process, he has sown dangerous
seeds of distrust and instability in the Arab world. Some
pressure also may be off Israel's new right-wing government,
which already is saying that Mr. Hussein's actions show that
Iraq, not Israel, is the threat to stability in the region.
Yesterday, Israeli Defense Minister Moshe Arens denounced
Iraq's actions but said Israel planned no military response.
He added that Kuwait's "occupation by Iraq doesn't change our
strategic situation."</p>
<p>If Mr. Hussein decides to remain in control of Kuwait, he
also may find the citizens of that land less pliant than
those in his own country. On Thursday, hundreds of anxious
Kuwaitis stranded in London swarmed their country's embassy,
waving posters of their deposed emir and shouting "Kuwait is
for Kuwaitis]" and "Down with Saddam]"</p>
<p>Khalid Juma, a 25-year-old law student in London for a
one-month summer course, wondered if his chosen career made
sense any more. "The only law that matters now comes in a
tank," he said. "I should be training for guerrilla warfare."</p>
