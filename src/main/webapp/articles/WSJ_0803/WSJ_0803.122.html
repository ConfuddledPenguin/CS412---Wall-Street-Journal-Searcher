	<p class="article-leader">Reed International PLC, a British publishing concern, will
pay #72 million ($133.6 million) for Estates Gazette Ltd., a
family-owned commercial property magazine.
   The London company said it may pay an additional five
million pounds depending on the Gazette's advertising revenue
in the three years to December 1993. The sale is expected to
be completed Aug. 31, Reed said.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The agreement was struck on condition the deal isn't
referred to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission for
investigation on competitive grounds, and could lapse if it
is referred.</p>
<p>Peter Davies, Reed International chairman, said the
acquisition fits in with Reed's other trade publications,
which include Computer Weekly, Flight International and
Farmers Weekly.</p>
<p>Peter Wilson, owner of the Estates Gazette, said the price
paid for the business was "fair" and in the best interests of
the company.</p>
<p>Reed shares shed five pence to 428 pence ($7.94) in line
with the broadly lower market on the London Stock Exchange.</p>
