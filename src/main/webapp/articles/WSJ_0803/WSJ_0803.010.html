	<p class="article-leader">TOKYO -- Chiyoda Corp., a plant-engineering company, said
it secured an order for two fertilizer plants, valued at
about 50 billion yen ($339.8 million), from Saudi Arabian
Fertilizer Co., known as Safco.
   The Japanese concern, formerly called Chiyoda Chemical
Engineering & Construction Co., will build the plants on the
Al-Jubail industrial site; one will turn out 500,000 tons of
ammonia and the other 600,000 tons of urea a year.
Construction, expected to take 29 months, will begin after
Chiyoda receives formal notification of the order, the
company said.</p>
