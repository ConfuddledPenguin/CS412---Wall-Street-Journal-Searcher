	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- Iraqi troops invading Kuwait picked up a
small group of American oil workers and moved them to an
unknown location, U.S. officials said.
   It wasn't clear whether the Iraqi troops intended to
capture the workers, who were near the Iraq-Kuwait border, or
merely were moving them out of the way of the invasion,
officials said. But American diplomats in Iraq were being
ordered by the State Department to ask the Iraqi foreign
ministry to locate the workers, and to tell Iraq's leaders
that they would be considered responsible for the workers'
fate.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>President Bush, asked about the workers at a news
conference, said he didn't know of the incident but warned
that there would be a "dramatic" effect on the U.S. attitude
if Americans were "threatened or harmed."</p>
