	<p class="article-leader">HIGHLAND PARK, Mich. -- Chrysler Corp. expects its share
of the U.S. car market to increase to about 10% next year
with the help of lower prices on some vehicles, the addition
of two economy-priced models and improved business with fleet
buyers.
   In the first half, Chrysler's share of the car market fell
to 8.9% from 10.6% a year earlier, putting the No. 3 U.S. car
maker in danger of falling behind Honda Motor Co. and Toyota
Motor Corp. for the year.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Chrysler announced preliminary 1991 retail prices that
include Jeep Cherokee prices as much as 5.8% below 1990
prices prior to July. Chrysler raised Cherokee prices $118
this summer. The Cherokee has been one of Chrysler's most
popular and profitable vehicles in recent years, but new
competitive models from other auto makers, notably Ford Motor
Co., have chipped away at Chrysler's lead with the four-door
Jeeps.</p>
<p>In response, Chrysler dropped the base price of the
mid-level Cherokee Laredo models to as low as $16,166 from
$17,535. It also added an even less costly four-door Sport
model with a base price of $14,863. But the auto maker also
raised the base price of the entry-level Cherokees nearly 4%.
The cheapest 1991-model Cherokee will cost $13,822, compared
with $13,295 before the July price rise.</p>
<p>Chrysler also dropped 1991 retail prices on its
poor-selling Eagle Premier and Dodge Monaco sedans as much as
5.7% in hopes of sparking consumer interest. The base 1991
Eagle Premier will cost $15,250, compared with $15,350 for
the 1990 models. The base 1991 Monaco will cost $13,895,
compared with $14,995 for the 1990 model. Chrysler must sell
300,000 of the cars by 1992 or pay a penalty to French auto
maker Renault under a parts agreement.</p>
<p>"We're trying to shift some of the windfall from Renault
to the customers," Bennett E. Bidwell, chairman of the auto
maker's Chrysler Motors unit, said about the Premier and
Monaco prices.</p>
<p>Another aim of Chrysler's strategy is to reduce the
reliance on rebates and incentives that have become confusing
to consumers, Mr. Bidwell said.</p>
<p>But not all 1991 Chrysler vehicles will have lower base
prices. Chrysler's redesigned 1991 minivans, for example,
will cost between 5% and 13% more than the base 1990 models
cost before July. The price of the 1991 minivans will range
from $13,195 to $25,905 for the luxury-packaged Chrysler Town
& Country version. The 1990 prices for the minivans ranged
from $11,995 to $23,500 prior to the July price rise.</p>
<p>Mr. Bidwell, however, called such price comparisons
"unfair," because Chrysler added more than $800 of previously
optional equipment as standard features on the 1991 models.
Adjusting for the new standard features, Mr. Bidwell said
minivan base prices increased 2.6% from similarly equipped
1990 models.</p>
<p>The new standard equipment includes automatic
transmissions, which Mr. Bidwell said 95% of all minivan
owners selected instead of the base manual transmission on
the 1990 minivans. But the standard engines remain the same.</p>
<p>Overall, the company argued that when new standard
equipment is factored in, its 1991 base prices rose 0.9% from
similarly equipped 1990 models. That number also reflects an
adjustment that gives more weight to high-volume,
lower-priced cars.</p>
<p>Mr. Bidwell said Chrysler expects to build market share
several ways. The company will be "more competitive" in
selling cars to fleet customers, such as rental car
companies. Chrysler scaled back its fleet sales this year,
saying it wasn't making enough profit on the business.</p>
<p>And Chrysler expects to add sales when it gets back into
the entry-level car business with the Dodge Shadow America
and Plymouth Sundance America compact cars. Base prices on
the Shadow and Sundance America models will begin at $7,599.
The company hasn't had a low-priced subcompact since it
stopped making its Dodge Omni and Plymouth Horizon
subcompacts earlier this year.</p>
<p>Separately, Chrysler extended discounts on remaining 1989
and 1990 vehicles through Aug. 10.</p>
