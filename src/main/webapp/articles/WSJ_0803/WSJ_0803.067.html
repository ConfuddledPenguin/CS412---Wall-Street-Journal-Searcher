	<p class="article-leader">Westerners rubbed their sleepy eyes yesterday morning to
the news that Saddam Hussein had made his big play for the
Persian Gulf's oil.
   His takeover of Kuwait capped a week in which the U.S.
Congress has been busily gutting the President's military
budget. It came after a long string of warnings, including
one from the Journal's Karen Elliott House, that feeding Mr.
Hussein cream won't turn him into a pussy cat. Now, someone
has to figure out how to put the pussy cat back in his cage,
and that won't be easy.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>President Bush responded yesterday by freezing Iraqi
assets in the U.S. and launching a trade embargo, policies
Jimmy Carter employed with such great effect against Iran at
the outset of the hostage crisis. Iraq probably has some
assets in the U.S., but it is doubtful that they are anywhere
close to matching the size of its total external debt;
yesterday the Iraqis replied that they'd stop debt repayments
to the U.S.</p>
<p>Basically, what Saddam Hussein has conducted is a good
old-fashioned caravan raid of the type his ancestors, and
multitudinous other war-makers throughout history, would
understand quite well. Not only is Chief Hussein looting a
very rich country, with external assets estimated at $100
billion, but he is wiping out his $10 billion debt to the
Kuwaitis. He used that $10 billion to help buy the arms he is
now employing for liquidating the debt.</p>
<p>What effect the invasion will have on the world-wide
supply of oil is a more complex question than it might at
first seem. London initially marked up crude-oil futures by
some $2 a barrel to over $22. Presumably, Mr. Hussein intends
to sell his stolen oil -- he needs the money -- so supply
curtailment is not a certainty. But there can be no doubt
that he has gained important leverage in the world market.</p>
<p>Some other factors aid his leverage. The Soviet Union's
producing and distribution infrastructure has been breaking
down because of shoddy construction and poor maintenance and
it has had to curtail its exports to such places as Poland
and Czechoslovakia. The Soviets yesterday joined the
world-wide chorus of complaint against Mr. Hussein, but they
desperately need foreign exchange, and an oil-price increase
would help offset their lost shipments. It should also be
remembered that the Soviets have been his number one arms
supplier (the French are second).</p>
<p>Which raises the question of military retaliation against
Iraq. Hussein's million-man army is not the Panamanian
self-defense force. The U.S. has no ground forces in the
region, in no small part because allies like Kuwait were
unwilling to accept American bases. Our NATO allies have
consistently insisted that a threat to their Gulf oil
supplies is an "out of area contingency." The U.S. yesterday
headed a carrier task force for the Persian Gulf, but for
carriers the Gulf is a constraining puddle. Iraq has some
fairly sophisticated attack fighters, with Exocet missiles,
and might score a lucky hit.</p>
<p>The U.S. has the means to conduct discriminate raids
against Iraqi economic targets, and should be reading this as
a possibility. But Mr. Hussein's threats to gas half of
Israel are probably meant to hold it hostage against
precisely such raids. The Israelis, lately treated with some
disdain by the American foreign policy establishment, have a
lot of muscle but indicated yesterday that they will sit on
their hands unless they themselves are attacked.</p>
<p>Against those limited options we must set the high stakes
involved. You can bet that Mr. Hussein made some serious
calculations of his chances for getting by with his theft of
Kuwait, and also that those calculations do not stop with
Kuwait. The way to get real leverage on world oil prices, he
will surely reason, is to steal Saudi Arabia's oil as well.
He is militarily capable of doing so, unless the Saudis
seriously resist and the West is united in their aid -- both
highly doubtful.</p>
<p>Mr. Hussein could easily take control of the entire Gulf
oil region except Iran, which would give him a real prospect
of controlling the world oil price, at least for a time. He
could levy billions of dollars of taxes on Western oil
consumers. These taxes would beyond doubt be devoted to his
military machine, particularly to the development of nuclear
weapons and missiles to allow him to threaten and intimidate
not only the Gulf Region but the developed world.</p>
<p>Years of fecklessness have left the West without a good
response to Saddam Hussein. Faced with ideological conflict,
its leaders have forgotten the ancient threat of piracy, all
the more serious in today's interdependent world. The need to
stand up to pirates should come clear as the West finishes
rubbing its eyes. Western leaders have a lot of new thinking
to do. We do not know where it ends, but it starts with a
recognition that they have huge interests involved.</p>
