	<p class="article-leader">The dollar quickly soared as Iraq's invasion of Kuwait
raised the specter of war, but the advance slowly eroded as
traders turned their attention back to weak U.S. economic
growth.
   This wild ride produced hectic trading, and left many
traders confused if not frightened.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"It was a very, very bloody day for most traders," said
Manfred Totzauer, a senior trader at Citibank in Frankfurt.
He explained that many of the market's large players had
positioned themselves for further declines in the dollar, and
the invasion news caught them off-guard.</p>
<p>Because these players -- large banks, institutional
investors and multinational corporations -- have positions
amounting to tens or even hundreds of millions of dollars,
some losses yesterday easily ran into millions of dollars,
traders said.</p>
<p>Initially, "there was panic; the market was caught short
dollars and people had to buy," said Peter Stein, a trader at
Commerzbank AG in Frankfurt. "It's always like this when
there are international shocks."</p>
<p>In late New York trading, the dollar stood at 1.5915 marks
and 149.25 yen, up from 1.5885 marks and 147.18 yen late
Wednesday. The British pound fell marginally to $1.8545 from
$1.8555 late the day before.</p>
<p>But over the preceding 24 hours, the volatile dollar
rocketed from a low of 1.5818 marks and 146.50 yen in very
early Thursday trading in the Far East to intraday highs of
1.6215 marks, and 151.58 yen -- up 2.5% and 3.5%,
respectively -- in early European activity. By late afternoon
in New York, the dollar had fallen back 1.9% from its high
against the mark and 1.5% from its high against the yen.</p>
<p>In early trading in Tokyo Friday, the dollar was quoted at
149.75 yen almost an hour after the opening; it closed in
Tokyo Thursday at 148.90 yen. Meanwhile, the U.S. currency
was trading at about 1.5955 marks, down from Tokyo's Thursday
close of 1.6038 marks.</p>
<p>Many traders expect the dollar to resume its recent
decline unless the Iraq-Kuwait situation escalates. "The
Iraq-Kuwaiti incident will not break the basic trend for the
dollar," which has been falling recently because of a
weakening U.S. economy, lower U.S. interest rates and higher
rates abroad, said Friedrich W. Menzel, a risk manager for
Citibank in Frankfurt. "What we are seeing will probably be
very short-lived."</p>
<p>But some analysts think such interpretation is
short-sighted or simplistic. "This isn't just an increase in
prices," argued Lawrence A. Veit, an international economist
at Brown Brothers Harriman & Co. "The territorial integrity
of every state in the Middle East is now threatened. In a
sense, there's a natural alliance between Iraq and Iran. This
is a confrontation between the high-population countries in
the Middle East that want higher oil prices in the near term
and the low-population countries that want lower prices in
the short term."</p>
<p>The dollar typically jumps during periods of international
tension as international investors flee into the U.S.
currency and dollar-denominated investments as a "safe
haven." Yesterday, the dollar's initial climb was
exaggerated. Many traders and investors, who had sold dollars
in expectation that the currency would keep falling, began
scrambling to buy them back either to cut losses or to lock
in profits. Those purchases, in turn, triggered so-called
stop-loss orders -- instructions that traders, investors and
corporations leave with banks to buy or sell currencies at
specific levels -- driving the dollar further upward.</p>
<p>"It kept going as each market opened; each market had to
have a chance to react to the invasion," said Ian Spence,
chief dealer at Manufacturers Hanover Trust Co.</p>
<p>Eventually, however, traders ended up holding more dollars
than they wanted to, said Mr. Spence, "and following the
invasion, nothing else really happened: The U.S. didn't
declare war; Russia didn't declare war." Moreover, Iraq's
embassy in Washington said the invasion forces might withdraw
from Kuwait in a few weeks. As a consequence, traders and
others spent the rest of the U.S. trading day undoing some of
their previous purchases.</p>
<p>Roberto Bianchi, a first vice president at Union Bank of
Switzerland in Zurich, said, "At the {dollar's} higher
levels, there was selling by people who had missed the move
in the past week and looked at this as an opportunity to sell
dollars."</p>
<p>Meanwhile, traders began reassessing the consequences of
higher oil prices that would result from Iraq's ability to
control roughly 20% of the world's oil reserves. "With their
strong currencies, the European economies look better
equipped to handle stronger oil prices than the U.S.
economy," said Mr. Bianchi of Union Bank. He added that
higher prices would also make it more difficult for the U.S.
to boost gasoline taxes as a means of closing the budget gap,
as has been suggested.</p>
<p>The U.S. currency has been plagued by a softening economy,
lower U.S. interest rates plus rising rates abroad. Such a
combination normally reduces the dollar's allure to
international investors and speculators. In addition, the
large U.S. budget and trade deficits have hurt the dollar.</p>
<p>Despite the renewed bearish dollar sentiment, the yen
remained relatively weak against the U.S. currency. "The yen
should be the largest loser {from higher oil prices}. The
Japanese are totally dependent on oil imports, and any
threats to supply are going to be very threatening to the
Japanese," said Jeremy Rumble, assistant chief dealer at
Royal Bank of Canada in London. Because oil is priced in
dollars, any weakness in the yen further increases petroleum
costs to Japanese buyers and adds to Japanese inflation,
which the Bank of Japan is already concerned about.</p>
<p>Some traders contended that while continental European
countries and Japan could withstand higher oil prices better
than the U.S. -- because their economies are more buoyant --
an actual cut in supply would hurt them more and also their
currencies.</p>
<p>"Although the U.S. is a 50% importer," that's much less
than most of Continental Europe and Japan imports, said Mr.
Rumble. "The mark, yen and Swiss franc will be hurt." By
contrast, the dollar and sterling would benefit. Britain as
well as Norway control oil reserves in the North Sea.</p>
<p>Mr. Veit of Brown Brothers added that with West German
production labor costs equal to $19.89 an hour compared with
$14.88 in the U.S., "the mark is an overvalued currency."</p>
<p>Furthermore, "the potential impact of inflation is going
to be a lot worse in Japan and Germany, particularly in
Japan, where you also have a weak yen," said Mr. Veit. At
current exchange rates and with Brent North Sea oil at $25 a
barrel, he said that the cost of a barrel of oil in yen terms
will be 50% higher than its 1989 average. That compares with
a 37% rise for U.S., a 22% boost for Britain and only 18% for
West Germany.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, "the fact remains that the U.S. economy is
still fundamentally weak. There are a lot of fundamentals
that argue for a weaker dollar, and those just don't go away
because there's a war in the Middle East," said Mr. Spence of
Manufacturers Hanover. "We can pretend today never happened.
We had this one-day blowout; we're back to basics."</p>
<p>On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for current
delivery settled at $376.80 an ounce, up $3.50. Estimated
volume was a heavy 6.5 million ounces.</p>
<p>In early trading in Hong Kong Friday, gold was quoted at
$374.95 an ounce.</p>
