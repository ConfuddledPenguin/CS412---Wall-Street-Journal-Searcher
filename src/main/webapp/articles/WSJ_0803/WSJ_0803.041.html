	<p class="article-leader">TOKYO -- Japan's Toyota Motor Corp. and Fujitsu Ltd.
agreed to establish a company to develop and market
engineering software, the two companies said.
   The joint venture, Toyota System Research Inc., will be
set up next month in Nagoya, with Toyota taking a 65%
interest and computer maker Fujitsu putting up the remaining
35% in the 300 million yen ($2 million) project, Toyota said.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The venture would aim to match Fujitsu's basic knowledge
as a computer maker with Toyota's applied knowledge as a
computer user to develop software capable of responding to
technological advances in laboratory and factory automation,
artificial intelligence and computer-aided engineering, or
CAE, Toyota said.</p>
<p>The company will initially focus on developing and
marketing software for the automobile industry, chiefly for
rapidly expanding CAE applications, Toyota said.</p>
<p>Sales for the first year are targeted at 500 million yen,
with a goal of three billion yen annually after five years.</p>
<p>Operations are tentatively scheduled to begin in November,
with a work force of 30 people. Over the next five years, the
number of employees is seen rising to 250.</p>
