	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- US Sprint Communications Co., stung by a loss
of market share to its rivals in the long-distance telephone
industry, began a new advertising campaign aimed at reversing

services offered by the United Telecommunications Inc. unit
and invite customers to call a toll-free number to have their
service switched to Sprint from another carrier, such as
American Telephone & Telegraph Co.</p>
