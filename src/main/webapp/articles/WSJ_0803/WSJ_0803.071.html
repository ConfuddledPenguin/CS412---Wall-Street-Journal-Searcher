old, was named to the board of this refrigeration and air
conditioning distributor, expanding the board to nine
members. Mr. Houser also was named president and chief
executive officer of MLX's Refrigeration & Air Conditioning
Group. Formerly, Mr. Houser was president of the Mid-Central
and Western Operations of that group. In his new role, Mr.
Houser assumes some of the former responsibilities of William

for Mr. Houser to allow the company to focus better on its
refrigeration and air conditioning business, which accounts
for more than 85% of the company's sales.</p>
