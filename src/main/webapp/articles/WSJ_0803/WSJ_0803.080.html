	<p class="article-leader">CAMBRIDGE, Mass. -- Polaroid Corp. said the U.S. Court of
Appeals for the First Circuit dismissed a class-action suit
brought against it by Irving Backman, on behalf of investors
who purchased stock and options in early 1979.
   In January, a majority of three judges on the court voted
to overturn a $30 million judgment against the company for
not promptly disclosing material information, and ordered the
case retried in a lower court.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Polaroid appealed that decision, and in today's ruling a
majority of the full U.S. Court voted to dismiss the suit.</p>
<p>As reported, Irving Backman alleged the company didn't
promptly disclose news of problems with its Polavision
product. The product was withdrawn from the market in the
fourth quarter of 1979, after the company took a $68 million
write-off.</p>
<p>The court ruled that Polaroid "did not, at any material
time, know that Polavision was a commercial failure."</p>
<p>In July 1987, a federal jury awarded $9.75 a share in
damages to shareholders who had bought stock in January and
February of 1979, for a total of $30 million.</p>
