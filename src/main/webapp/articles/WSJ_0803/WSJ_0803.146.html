	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Iraq's invasion of Kuwait sent bond investors
scrambling for cover yesterday on fears that war between the
two Middle East nations will cause oil prices -- and
inflation -- to soar.
   The sell-off started during overnight trading in Tokyo and
continued in London and New York. Traders said activity was
busiest in London, where dealers reported heavy selling by
investors from all around the world, including those in the
U.S., Britain, Saudi Arabia and Japan.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Even investors in smaller countries were big sellers. "We
were extremely busy in Singapore," said Lawrence Leuzzi, a
managing director at S.G. Warburg & Co.</p>
<p>The prospects of higher oil prices not only increase the
odds that inflation will accelerate, but could force the
Federal Reserve to change monetary policy.</p>
<p>News that oil prices are rising, "is coming at the worst
possible time, when the economy is already extremely weak and
when there is a major effort underway to reduce the size of
the budget deficit," said Norman Robertson, chief economist
at Mellon Bank Corp. He said that rising oil prices will make
it difficult for the Federal Reserve to further reduce
interest rates. At the same time, high oil prices will drag
down already weak business activity.</p>
<p>"If not recession, this certainly carries the threat of
stagflation, where oil prices rise and exacerbates inflation
and at the same time reduces the economic growth rate. It's a
very vicious brew here," said Mr. Robertson. The economist
estimates that if oil prices rise to $25 a barrel, the
nation's inflation could rise about 1/2 of a percentage point
to between 4.5% and 5%.</p>
<p>On the New York Mercantile Exchange, September crude
settled at $23.11 a barrel, up $1.57 on the day. The contract
traded as high at $23.80.</p>
<p>The yield curve steepened in reaction to yesterday's news,
as prices of short-term securities ended unchanged to
slightly lower while prices of long-term bonds were
clobbered.</p>
<p>The Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond fell 1 1/4 point, a
loss of about $12.50 for a bond with a $1,000 face amount.
The issue's yield, which moves in the opposite direction of
its price, jumped to 8.45%.</p>
<p>Two-year notes, on the other hand, fell less than 1/8
point to yield 7.88% while three-month bills ended unchanged
to yield 7.66%.</p>
<p>Some traders detected signs of "flight-to-quality" buying
of short-term Treasury bills yesterday, but were surprised
there wasn't more of this, in view of the financial market's
reaction to the Iraqi invasion. Because U.S. Treasury bills
are considered the safest securities in the world, investors
often sell out of other securities and aggressively buy
Treasury bills when there is political or economic upheaval
in other parts of the world.</p>
<p>But trading yesterday was dominated by investors making
"yield-curve trades," essentially selling long-term Treasurys
while buying short-term securities on expectations that these
securities will outperform the market in the coming weeks and
months.</p>
<p>In the wake of the Iraqi invasion, economic data released
yesterday passed more-or-less unnoticed. Those reports were
the latest data on claims for unemployment and factory
orders. As trading quieted late yesterday afternoon, however,
the market began to focus on the July employment report due
this morning.</p>
<p>The market is looking for the report -- the first official
indication of the economy during July -- to confirm signs of
marked economic deterioration.</p>
<p>"The question is, if it is a good number, how high can the
market go, now that they've fallen like this," says one
trader.</p>
<p>Economists surveyed by Dow Jones Capital Markets Report
estimate on average that nonfarm payrolls increased by 5,300,
or by 130,000 excluding layoffs of census workers.
Unemployment is seen rising 0.1% to 5.3% during July.</p>
<p>Treasury Securities</p>
<p>The Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond ended at a price of
103 2/32, down from 104 8/32. The issue's yield climbed to
8.45% from 8.35%. Two-year notes were quoted at 100 6/32 to
yield 7.88% compared with 100 9/32 to yield 7.83%.</p>
<p>Short-term rates were little changed. The discount rate on
three-month bills was unchanged at 7.43% for a
bond-equivalent yield of 7.66% while the rate on six-month
bills was modestly higher at 7.31% to yield 7.67%.</p>
<p>The Treasury Department auctioned $4 billion of 44-day
cash management bills yesterday. The average rate was set at
7.60%.</p>
<p>Here are details of the auction:</p>
<p>Rates are determined by the difference between the
purchase price and face value. Thus, higher bidding narrows
the investor's return while lower bidding widens it.</p>
<p>            44-day Cash Management Notes</p>
<p>Applications ............................ $28,376,000,000</p>
<p>Accepted bids ...........................  $4,029,600,000</p>
<p>Accepted at low price ...................             86%</p>
<p>Average price (Rate) ....................  99.071 (7.60%)</p>
<p>High price (Rate) .......................  99.072 (7.59%)</p>
<p>Low price (Rate) ........................  99.071 (7.60%)</p>
<p>Interest rate 7.78%. The notes are dated Aug. 7 and mature
Sept. 20, 1990.</p>
<p>Corporate, Junk Bonds</p>
<p>Junk bonds ended between 1/2 and 3/4 point lower. Trading
was limited, however, and junk-bond dealers said that in most
cases prices were simply quoted lower. Junk bonds are
speculative-grade issues that carry low ratings or no ratings
at all.</p>
<p>Among the high-yield bonds that suffered losses were
pay-in-kind bonds of RJR Nabisco Inc., which staged a partial
rebound after falling more than two points earlier.
Pay-in-kind bonds pay interest in the form of more securities
instead of cash.</p>
<p>RJR Nabisco 17 3/8% convertible pay-in-kind debentures
fell one point to 113 5/8 on the New York Stock Exchange.
RJR's 17% exchangeable pay-in-kind debentures finished one
point lower at 91 3/4.</p>
<p>Despite yesterday's declines, First Boston Corp. said its
junk-bond index showed a positive return of 3.23% in the
month of July.</p>
<p>Advancers outpaced decliners by more than four to one, and
the value of the First Boston high-yield index reached 149.45
in July, surpassing its July 1989 peak of 147.91.</p>
<p>"This is the first time the market has recouped all the
losses from mid-1989 till February," said Sam DeRosa-Farag, a
high-yield analyst at First Boston.</p>
<p>In addition, Mr. DeRosa-Farag pointed out that bonds,
which are trading at between 60 to 80 cents on the dollar,
are beginning to outperform bonds trading at par and above.</p>
<p>Bonds in the 60-cents to 80-cents on the dollar range
produced positive returns of 4.6% in July compared with a
2.1% positive return generated by bonds trading at par and
above, said Mr. DeRosa-Farag.</p>
<p>In the investment-grade market, prices of high-grade
corporate bonds ended between 3/4 point to one point lower.</p>
<p>Municipal Securities</p>
<p>Municipal bonds finished 1/4 to 1/2 point lower in calm
dealings.</p>
<p>Despite the slight losses, traders said the supply
shortage in municipals continues to provide solid support and
foster bullish sentiment.</p>
<p>Among actively traded secondary issues, the New Jersey
Turnpike Authority's 7.20% securities of 2018 finished 1/4
point lower at 99 1/2, pushing the yield up to 7.23% from
7.21% late Wednesday.</p>
<p>In the new issue sector, the Pennsylvania Housing Finance
Authority's $80 million single-family mortgage revenue bonds
were priced by a PaineWebber Inc. group.</p>
<p>The bonds, which are subject to the alternative minimum
tax, were priced at par to yield from 6.30% in 1994 to 7.65%
in 2023.</p>
<p>Mortgage-, Asset-Backed Securities</p>
<p>Mortgage-backed securities ended lower.</p>
<p>Among actively traded issues:</p>
<p>Government National Mortgage Association 8.5% securities
were down 13/32 at 95 17/32, and the 9.5% issues, at 100
12/32, were down 10/32.</p>
<p>Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp. 9.5% issues were off 9/32
at 99 25/32, and Federal National Mortgage Association 9%
issues were down 11/32 at 97 31/32.</p>
<p>Foreign Bonds</p>
<p>Iraq's overnight invasion of Kuwait caused global bond
prices to tumble.</p>
<p>In West Germany, prices were sharply lower. But traders
said there has been little panic-selling. The trend much of
the day was set in the Bund futures pit in London.</p>
<p>Bonn's 8.75% benchmark bond due 2000 fell 0.63 point to
100.32 to yield 8.69%.</p>
<p>British government bonds, called gilts, ended with losses
of as much as 3/4 point, but they had been down by well over
a point at midday.</p>
<p>Britain's benchmark 11.75% bond due 2003/2007 was quoted
late at 102 15/32, down 22/32 to yield 11.37%.</p>
<p>In Tokyo, dealers said the market closely followed the
movement of the U.S. dollar, with yen bonds recovering from
their lows whenever the the dollar retreated from its highs.</p>
<p>At the 3 p.m. JST close of the Tokyo Stock Exchange, the
yield on Japan's benchmark No. 119 bond was 7.575%. The price
was down 0.34 point to 85.29.</p>
