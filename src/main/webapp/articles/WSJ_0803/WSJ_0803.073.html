	<p class="article-leader">Kuwait tried to sell about $100 million of U.S. Treasury
securities in London early yesterday as Iraqi troops invaded
its territory, but it was rebuffed by most securities
dealers, traders said.
   Kuwait had been selling U.S. Treasury notes and bonds for
several days to raise cash as tensions with Iraq increased,
the traders said. But as news of Iraqi troops entering Kuwait
hit the newswires, dealers in U.S. government bonds stopped
doing business with Kuwait because they feared that the
Persian Gulf nation might not be able to deliver the
securities.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>A manager at a Swiss securities firm said: "We could not
transact business with Kuwait because we were not sure if
we'd get paid."</p>
<p>Jonathan Binder, a bond salesman in the New York office of
British securities dealer James Capel & Co., said that most
large dealers received calls from Kuwait trying to sell
securities, mostly three-to-seven-year Treasury notes.</p>
<p>However, some British-based securities firms were
cautioned by the Bank of England that trading with Kuwait
could be risky.</p>
<p>One firm that did trade with Kuwait, despite the Bank of
England's warning, was Midland Montagu Securities, a unit of
Britain's Midland Bank PLC. But according to an executive at
Midland, which announced a few weeks ago that it would no
longer be a primary dealer of U.S. government bonds, the firm
purchased only foreign currency from the Kuwait Investment
Office. The government-owned office holds a 10.5% stake in
Midland Bank.</p>
<p>A $100 million trade is considered small for the U.S.
Treasury bond market, where more than $100 billion of bonds
trade daily. But if such a trade were to sour, it could be
devastating for a single securities firm.</p>
<p>Even after a decade, dealers haven't forgotten the
problems they had when the U.S. froze Iranian assets during
the hostage crisis. In some cases, it was two years before
dealers were compensated for cash and securities owed them by
Iranian accounts.</p>
<p>Late in the day, the British government froze Kuwaiti
assets as did the U.S. and several other countries.</p>
<p>Today, "in a period where securities firms and brokers are
going out of business" because of tough conditions in the
Treasury market, "everybody was worried about doing business
with Kuwait," said an economist at a British securities firm.</p>
<p>Kuwait's government has been a big buyer of U.S. Treasury
notes and bonds, which are viewed by U.S. and foreign
investors alike as the safest securities in the world. The
market for U.S. government securities is also the largest
securities market in the world, which tends to make it easy
for investors to liquidate the securities at a moment's
notice to raise cash. This was Kuwait's plan.</p>
<p>The Iraqi invasion of Kuwait sent prices of U.S. Treasury
bonds spiraling lower yesterday.</p>
<p>The rout began in Tokyo, where the price of U.S. Treasury
bonds fell 3/4 point, or about $7.50 for each $1,000 face
amount. The rout spilled over into London, where heavy
selling among U.S., Japanese, Saudi Arabian and other foreign
investors caused prices of U.S. bonds to fall as much as 1
1/8 point.</p>
<p>"The Saudis were selling a large amount of seven-year and
10-year Treasurys to raise money," said Capel's Mr. Binder.</p>
<p>Fears that rising oil prices would spur inflation were
also a major factor behind yesterday's rout.</p>
<p>Kuwait's efforts to sell U.S. Treasurys added more
confusion to an already deteriorating market in London and
caused U.S. Treasury prices there to fall even further. At
one point trading came almost to a standstill, as traders
scrutinized their books for names of other firms they didn't
want to do business with because of possible heavy exposure
to Kuwait.</p>
<p>Said one economist for a British firm: "Traders were
saying, anybody who does business with Kuwait, we are not
going to do business with. Then, for a moment, they didn't
want to do business with anyone."</p>
