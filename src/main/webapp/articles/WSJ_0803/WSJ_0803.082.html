	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- The World Bank approved a $300 million loan
to Poland, primarily to help the Eastern European country pay
for essential imports as it moves ahead with its economic
reform program.
   The international agency said the loan, which will be
disbursed in two installments, also would support an
expansion of Poland's so-called safety-net programs,
including unemployment compensation and retraining of workers
displaced during the current effort to restructure various
industries.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>World Bank President Barber Conable promised earlier that
the bank would provide loans to Poland to support the
country's economic reforms. The $300 million loan is its
first credit of this type to the country, according to bank
officials.</p>
<p>In another action, the World Bank cleared a $125 million
loan to Indonesia to help provide credits to small borrowers,
primarily in rural areas.</p>
<p>The bank also approved a $75 million loan for rural
development projects in Colombia's Andean and coastal areas.</p>
<p>The World Bank loans carry a variable interest rate,
currently 7.72% annually.</p>
