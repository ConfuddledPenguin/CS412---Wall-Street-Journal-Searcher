	<p class="article-leader">CINCINNATI -- Pete Rose Way, by any other name, would
smell a lot sweeter.
   The City Council thought it made a hit when it named a
street after Mr. Rose in 1985. But with the former baseball
star heading to prison this month, the city's action looks
more like an error.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>When the city changed the name of Second Street six days
before Mr. Rose broke Ty Cobb's hit record, it slid under
regulations that require people to be dead for at least five
years before having streets named in their honor. Now, after
Mr. Rose's tax-fraud conviction, the council feels caught off
base.</p>
<p>"This was done very hastily," says Councilwoman Bobbie
Sterne. "It's a great public lesson."</p>
<p>Reggie Williams, linebacker for the Cincinnati Bengals
turned city councilman, wants to take Mr. Rose's name off the
downtown street. But he knows he may be caught in a rundown
for bad-mouthing Mr. Rose. "Pete Rose walks on water in
Cincinnati," he says.</p>
<p>Others balk at changing the name. "There were about
500,000 Cincinnatians who agreed with us at the time," says
Councilman Peter Strauss. And besides, he adds, changing the
name could cost the city about $400,000 in new signs.</p>
<p>That's not to say the city council hasn't discussed the
problem.</p>
<p>Councilman James Cissell proposes renaming the boulevard
"Wager Way." Ms. Sterne thinks the city could save money by
painting over the "Pete" on all the signs. One letter in the
Cincinnati Enquirer suggests "Cooperstown Bypass," referring
to Mr. Rose's dwindling prospects of being named to
baseball's hall of fame.</p>
<p>The two-mile, six-lane Pete Rose Way is the first thing
many visitors see when they enter the city. It also passes
under the Suspension Bridge, a geographical coincidence that
has assumed new meaning since Mr. Rose's suspension from
baseball last year for gambling.</p>
<p>Pete Rose Way isn't the only celebrity street in town.
Cincinnati boasts the usual Washington, Jefferson, Lincoln
and Madison streets, and it also has roads honoring Martin
Luther King and "Mad" Anthony Wayne, the Indian fighter. But
in this city, Pete Rose tops the list of notables. "Probably
a higher percentage of people know Pete Rose than knew Mad
Anthony Wayne," says city engineer Thomas Young.</p>
<p>Maybe that's why they waited until Gen. Wayne was dead.</p>
