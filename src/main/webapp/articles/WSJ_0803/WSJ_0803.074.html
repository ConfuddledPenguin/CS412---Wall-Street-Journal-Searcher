	<p class="article-leader">Thomson McKinnon Asset Management L.P., a New York-based
mutual-fund adviser, settled with findings by the Securities
and Exchange Commission that it failed to properly disclose
certain fees charged customers.
   Without admitting or denying the charges, Thomson McKinnon
agreed to comply with required internal procedures.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The SEC asserted Thomson McKinnon didn't adequately
disclose multiple fees or that it benefited from the "float"
-- or interest earned -- on customer funds before the funds
were invested for customers.</p>
<p>The SEC noted that the retail business has been sold and
the company no longer earns float benefits on customer
transactions.</p>
