	<p class="article-leader">A federal appeals court ruled that Continental Can Co.'s
dismissal of workers approaching qualification for two
pension plans violated the federal statute regulating
employee benefits known as the Employee Retirement Income
Security Act of 1974, or ERISA.
   The Third U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Philadelphia
upheld a lower court order barring the Norwalk, Conn.,
company from continuing the practice in the future.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Plaintiffs' lawyers said the case could affect thousands
of workers and cost Continental millions of dollars.
Continental is now a subsidiary of Peter Kiewit Sons Inc., a
construction company based in Omaha, Neb. A lawyer for Kiewit
could not be reached for comment.</p>
<p>The class action suit was filed in 1983 by four former
steelworkers at Continental plants in Passaic, N.J., and
Chicago. The suit alleges that Continental implemented a plan
at its 46 plants to fire employees before they reached the
so-called "Magic Number," a combination of the workers' age
and years of service that qualified them for layoff benefits.
The benefits were adopted under a collective bargaining
agreement reached with the United Steelworkers of America,
AFL-CIO, in 1977.</p>
<p>Continental has argued that it began laying off workers in
the 1970s due to adverse economic conditions in the steel can
industry. The company says that its actions do not violate
ERISA and that few of the plaintiffs were close to qualifying
for the benefits when they were laid off.</p>
<p>Trials in the case are proceeding plant by plant. The
current decision involves the St. Louis plant, which produced
food, beverage and general packaging cans and employed the
largest number of plaintiffs in the case.</p>
<p>In June 1989, a lower court found that 315 St. Louis
workers had been victims of Continental's plan and could seek
monetary damages against the company. George L. Priest, a
professor at Yale Law School, was appointed by the court to
handle those damage claims, which are still pending and can
be appealed later by Continental.</p>
<p>The plaintiffs are also seeking damages under the
Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations law, or RICO.
Those claims are scheduled to be tried in April 1991.</p>
<p>The appeals panel found that Continental failed to prove
that, absent the plan, the workers at the St. Louis plant
would have been fired anyway. But the panel did find that the
lower court erred by precluding Continental from making the
same defense at future trials involving the other plants. In
order for those workers to collect damages, the panel wrote,
they must show that Continental's plan was implemented at
their plant and led to their layoff.</p>
<p>Edwin C. Thomas, a lawyer for Continental with the Chicago
firm of Bell, Boyd & Lloyd, said the decision could affect
other companies with similar collective bargaining
arrangements. "What this means is that companies would be
operating at risk if they considered the cost of this layoff
benefit in any way in taking management actions. That is an
enormous change in business practices not anticipated by
Congress when they passed ERISA."</p>
<p>But plaintiffs' lawyers said that under ERISA employers
would still be free to consider costs when designing pension
plans and to change them if they prove too expensive. "But it
should be done across the bargaining table," says Dan
McIntyre, a solo practitioner in Falmouth, Maine, who is
representing the plaintiffs. "You can't do it in an
underhanded way by pretending a benefit exists but making
sure people don't get it."</p>

<p>CONGRESSMAN INDICTED for tax evasion, embezzlement from
HUD project.</p>
<p>A federal grand jury in Brooklyn, N.Y., charged Rep. Floyd
Flake (D., N.Y.) with 17 counts of conspiracy, fraud, tax
evasion, and filing false returns and financial statements.
U.S. Attorney Andrew Maloney in Brooklyn said the congressman
and his wife failed to report $141,700 in income from 1983 to
1987 -- including $75,000 embezzled from a senior citizens
home and $66,700 in personal expenses paid by the Allen
A.M.E. Church, where Mr. Flake is pastor.</p>
<p>Mr. Flake, 45 years old, issued a statement saying he and
his wife are innocent and that they expect to be acquitted.
His wife, Margarett, was charged with nine counts. "The
prosecutor is attempting to substitute his judgment on how a
church should manage its affairs and how a pastor should
fulfill his special duties in an inner city, minority
community," Mr. Flake said in his statement.</p>
<p>Some of the charges involve an $11 million senior-citizens
home that the Allen church built in 1981 under Mr. Flake's
leadership. The center was largely paid for with a grant from
the U.S. Housing and Urban Development Department, and its
day-to-day operations are paid for primarily with HUD
subsidies. Rep. Flake, elected in 1981, became pastor at the
6,000-member church in Queens in 1976.</p>
<p>The Flakes are accused of misappropriating money from the
home by having the church overbill the project for
transportation costs and then pocketing the excess amount.</p>

<p>PRIVACY OF CORDLESS phone conversations is protected in
New York.</p>
<p>A state appellate court in Manhattan ruled that New York's
eavesdropping law prohibits the government from intentionally
listening in on such conversations, which are broadcast over
radio waves and can be easily monitored.</p>
<p>The decision grants greater protection than federal courts
have provided to cordless-phone users. The U.S. Supreme Court
earlier this year declined to hear an appeal of a lower
court's ruling that citizens have no right to expect that
their conversations on such phones will be private. Lower
courts also have ruled that the federal law against
unauthorized wiretapping doesn't apply to cordless phones.</p>
<p>"This is another example of where New York courts are
becoming more protective of individual rights than the
federal courts," said Arthur Eisenberg, legal director of the
New York Civil Liberties Union.</p>
<p>In the appeals court case, a man was convicted of drug
possession after an off-duty police officer reported
overhearing suspicious conversations through his cordless
phone at home. The officer determined that the conversations
were coming from a nearby apartment, and he gave prosecutors
tapes of what he heard.</p>
<p>While ruling that cordless-phone calls are protected under
New York law, the appeals court upheld the defendant's
conviction, ruling that enough additional evidence was
gathered independent of the eavesdropping.</p>
<p>Ronald L. Kuby, who with attorney William M. Kunstler
represented the defendant, said he plans to appeal. "The
whole case got started on the basis of this illegal
eavesdropping," Mr. Kuby said.</p>

<p>SENATE COMMITTEE warns nominees to quit discriminatory
clubs.</p>
<p>The Judiciary Committee unanimously approved a resolution
declaring that it considers it "inappropriate" for nominees
for federal bench or Justice Department posts to belong to
clubs that discriminate on the basis of race, color,
religion, sex, disability or national origin. Such
memberships have been the subject of debate in a number of
recent confirmation hearings, including those of Supreme
Court Justice Anthony Kennedy and John Dunne, the Justice
Department's civil rights chief.</p>
<p>The resolution, sponsored by Sen. Edward Kennedy (D.,
Mass.) isn't binding, however, and doesn't require that a
nominee who belongs to a discriminatory organization
automatically be rejected by the committee. Continued
membership in such clubs is an "important factor senators
should consider in evaluating nominees," the resolution
states. There also is a loophole excusing nominees who "are
actively engaged in bona fide efforts to eliminate the
discriminatory practices" in a club to which they belong.</p>
<p>Despite these qualifications, civil rights advocates
praised the committee's action. The Kennedy resolution "will
contribute significantly to breaking down one of the most
pernicious barriers to the advancement of women and
minorities," the Alliance for Justice, a liberal advocacy
group in Washington said.</p>
<p>In an aside, the resolution urges lawmakers to get their
own house in order. "So as to promote a consistent policy on
this issue," it states, "any senator belonging to such a club
should resign."</p>
