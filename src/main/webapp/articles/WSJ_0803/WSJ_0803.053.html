	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Habersheir Securities Inc. of Atlanta was
expelled from the National Association of Securities Dealers,
and a principal of the firm was barred from the securities
industry for alleged failure to maintain accurate records and
required net capital.
   The disciplinary action was among a number taken by the
NASD, the self-regulatory agency for the over-the-counter
markets.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Habersheir, also known as W.D. Fard Securities Inc., also
was fined $15,000 while the principal, Raymond R. Khalif of
Newark, N.J., was assessed $10,000. The firm and Mr. Khalif,
who couldn't be reached, were fined and suspended under an
NASD action announced early this year.</p>
<p>Hampton Securities Inc. and principal Delores Easthom,
both of West Palm Beach, Fla., settled with the NASD,
agreeing to a total fine of $147,700.</p>
<p>The firm, which went out of business around last
September, had been expelled under a previous action; Ms.
Easthom was barred as a principal and suspended in any

unfair prices for securities. Ms. Easthom couldn't be
reached.</p>
<p>Marvin W. Fulford of Asheville, N.C., was fined $205,000

<p>Except as noted below, the individuals and firms involved
in NASD disciplinary proceedings couldn't be reached for
comment:</p>
<p>Jackson W. Moore, president of Union Planters Corp.,
parent of the investment subsidiary, said the NASD matter
"involved some transactions that happened probably close to
two years ago." The firm already has charged off the fine, he
said. "Rather than going to the expense and distraction of
going to litigation, we proceeded with a negotiated
settlement of the matter," the executive said.</p>
<p>Mr. Heiner said, "We disagree with the interpretation by
the NASD of the facts. The firm did not benefit by the amount
the agency told us we had to give back."</p>
<p>Mr. Ingber said, "The arbitration hearing is just
symbolic. Everybody told (me), `you're just wasting your
time.' They were right."</p>
<p>Mr. Heidtke said the firm made a market in a local
low-price stock. Because the issue was a pink-sheet stock,
regulators argued that the markups the firm charged should
have been based on the bid price, or on the firm's cost,
rather than on the more-usual asked price.</p>
<p>Shearson declined to comment, as did Messrs. Castille,
Crawford, Durando, Giordano, Halloran, Ostrand and Thacker.</p>
<p>A spokeswoman for Prudential-Bache said the NASD matters
occurred "several years ago" and that the firm settled
without admitting or denying wrongdoing "to put the matter
behind us."</p>
<p>A spokesman for Kochcapital declined comment.</p>
