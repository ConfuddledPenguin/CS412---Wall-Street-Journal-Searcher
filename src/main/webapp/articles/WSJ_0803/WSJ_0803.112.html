	<p class="article-leader">HOUSTON -- Harold Simmons' holdings, like an amoeba, keep
multiplying by dividing.
   One of the companies controlled by the Dallas financier,
Baroid Corp., has said that it is considering a plan to
separate into two publicly traded companies through a
tax-free spinoff. Baroid itself was created in December 1988,
when it was spun off from NL Industries, also controlled by
Mr. Simmons through his Valhi Inc. holding company.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Baroid said that under the plan, which would be considered
during a board meeting scheduled the week of Aug. 20, one
company would consist of its existing petroleum services
business while the other would comprise the company's
Titanium Metals Corp. of America, its titanium metals
business and certain mining operations.</p>
<p>In March, Baroid acquired the 30% of Titanium Metals that
it didn't already own from Allegheny International Inc. for
$50 million.</p>
<p>Robert J. Leidich, Baroid's vice president and general
counsel, said the company is considering the spinoff because
the two businesses are different. The company hopes that,
separately, the two would be more highly valued by the
market.</p>
<p>Valhi currently holds 43% of Baroid and about 63% of NL.
In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange, Valhi
closed yesterday at $12, down 25 cents.</p>
