	<p class="article-leader">The Rise and Fall
   Of Family Incomes</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>FOR THREE out of four Americans, median family income rose
or fell at least 5% during 1985 and 1986. For one out of
three, the change was big enough to move them to a different
income quintile.</p>
<p>In a new study, the Census Bureau divided the U.S. into
five equal-sized family income groups, with each quintile
comprising roughly 45 million Americans (the number grows
each year with the population). At the end of 1986,
two-thirds were in the same relative position that they had
been in at the beginning of 1985.</p>
<p>Of the one-third that changed quintiles, 18% moved to a
lower quintile, and 16% moved up to a higher one. (The upward
and downward moves don't necessarily balance because of
population additions and subtractions during the study
period.)</p>
<p>Young people were most likely to move to a different
income quintile. Nineteen percent of 18- to 24-year-olds
moved up, and 20% moved down. Elderly people had the most
stable incomes. Only 8% of those age 65 or older moved to a
higher income quintile, and 16% moved down.</p>
<p>Being at the top -- or bottom -- doesn't mean staying
there. One out of four people who were in the top income
quintile in 1985 had fallen to a lower quintile in 1986.
Likewise, 18% of those who started at the bottom moved up.</p>
<p>Roles in the Home</p>
<p>Can Vary Over Time</p>
<p>AGE AND SEX have a lot to do with people's family roles.</p>
<p>Young adults have the greatest variety of household roles.
Thirty-nine percent of young men age 18 to 34 head their own
families, while 3% are married to family heads. The
designation "head of household" was self-defined by the
people surveyed in a Census Bureau study.</p>
<p>For young women, the situation is reversed. Fourteen
percent head families, while 44% are spouses of heads.
Thirty-one percent of young men live with their parents, 5%
live with other relatives, and 23% don't live in families at
all (most of them live alone). Since so many young women are
spouses, only 23% live with mom and dad, and 3% with other
relatives; 15% don't live in a family.</p>
<p>By middle age, 73% of men are family heads. Five percent
of men ages 35 to 54 are spouses of heads, and 6% live with
parents or other relatives. The share living alone or with
nonrelatives is down to 16%. Two-thirds of middle-aged women
are spouses, and 19% head families. Four percent live in some
other relative's household, and 11% live outside of a family
group.</p>
<p>Men's head-of-household status peaks in the mature years.
Fully 76% of men age 55 or older head families. Four percent
are spouses of heads, 4% live with other relatives, and 16%
don't live in families. For older women, widowhood vies with
spousehood. Nearly half of older women are still spouses, but
34% are no longer in families (many are widows living alone).
Twelve percent of women age 55 or older head families, and 5%
live with other relatives.</p>
<p>Romance in America,</p>
<p>And How It Pans Out</p>
<p>ONE DIVORCE occurs for every two marriages in the U.S.,
but this doesn't mean that half of people are divorced.</p>
<p>A Census Bureau report shows that 8% of Americans age 15
or older are currently divorced. Seven percent are widowed,
26% haven't been married and 59% are married (including 2%
who are separated and 1% who have a spouse absent for other
reasons, such as military duty).</p>
<p>It takes two to marry, but men are more likely than women
to be married, 58% vs. 53%. This is because there are more
women than men in the population, especially at the top end
of the age spectrum. Twelve percent of women are widows,
while only 3% of men are widowers.</p>
<p>Since the male population is slightly younger than the
female population, men are more likely than women to be
single. Thirty percent of men have never married, compared
with 23% of women. The difference in age may also explain why
9% of women are divorced, compared with less than 7% of men.
Also, because the married category includes remarriages, and
because men are more likely to get remarried, that leaves
fewer of them in the divorce pool.</p>
<p>Odds and Ends</p>
<p>ONLY ONE out of five Americans trust the way insurance
companies collect and use personal information about
customers. A Louis Harris study on consumer attitudes
regarding privacy issues, sponsored by Equifax Inc. of
Atlanta, found that hospitals are most trusted to use
personal data responsibly, followed by the Census Bureau and
the Social Security Administration. Consumers are most
distrustful of direct-marketing companies; only 6% think that
such businesses collect and use information about people in a
responsible way. . . . College students are busy people.
According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, 87% of the 1.3
million part-time college students enrolled in the fall of
1989 were working, and another 4% were looking for work.
Among the nearly seven million full-time college students,
46% had jobs and 7% were looking for them. . . . Mexican food
has gone mainstream, with 41% of homemakers buying the
fixings for it in food stores. According to Mediamark
Research of New York, college-educated women, people under
age 45 and working parents are most likely to buy taco
shells, nachos and other Mexican foods. Mediamark also finds
that light beer drinkers are better-educated and more
affluent than the average regular beer drinker.</p>
