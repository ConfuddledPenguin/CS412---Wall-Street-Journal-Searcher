	<p class="article-leader">The U.S. travel and tourism industry is having a slow
summer for the second year in a row.
   Nearly every sector of domestic leisure travel -- from the
sprawling California theme parks to the quaint inns of
Nantucket, Mass. -- is reporting that business is flat or
down 5% to 10% from last year. Many airlines, hotels and car
rental companies say domestic business is flat, too.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>That's a big change from the double-digit increases the
industry reveled in during most of the 1980s. More
importantly, the slowdown comes only a few months after air
travel began rebounding, which had raised some hopes that the
industry wouldn't be hurt badly by the nation's weakening
economy. Now, most experts are worried that the $320
billion-a-year travel industry may be headed for a prolonged
slump.</p>
<p>"Just about nobody is doing very well," says James
Cammisa, publisher of Travel Industry Indicators, a
Miami-based newsletter. "Everyone has come down a notch," he
says. Like most experts, Mr. Cammisa says the shaky national
economy seems to be keeping travelers home. "In bad times,
discretionary travel is the first to go," he says.</p>
<p>The news is good for travelers, since the slowdown is
keeping many travel prices down. But it's troubling for
airlines, because most of them are in the midst of big fleet
expansions. It's also worrisome for several huge new resorts,
casinos and theme parks -- ranging from the Excalibur Hotel
in Las Vegas to MCA Inc.'s Universal Studios Florida in
Orlando -- that have opened in the past few months.</p>
<p>To be sure, a few regions, such as parts of Florida and
Texas, are experiencing a strong summer. But overall, U.S.
airline boardings fell 0.7% in June from year-earlier
figures, and analysts say July doesn't look much better. "The
industry is just having a soft summer," says John Tague,
marketing vice president for Midway Airlines. The National
Park Service, meanwhile, says June traffic volume was flat.</p>
<p>Although Walt Disney Co. doesn't release attendance
figures, analysts suspect that Disneyland's business is at
best flat and that DisneyWorld in Orlando is ahead of last
year. Universal Studios Hollywood concedes its total gate is
off slightly, with stronger local attendance mitigating the
lack of foreign and out-of-state visitors. "The tourists are
not here" in Southern California, says Joan Bullard, a
spokeswoman for the MCA tour.</p>
<p>One of the hardest-hit areas is New England, according to
travel experts. Some Nantucket hotels, for example, say
business is off 10% to 40% during the week. "We're not a
bunch of happy campers right now," says Elizabeth Oldham,
executive director of the Nantucket Island Chamber of
Commerce.</p>
<p>Along with the unstable economy, travel experts say high
airline fares may be contributing to the slowdown. The fare
increases have slowed down this summer, but prices are still
50% higher on some routes than a few years ago. Other travel
specialists are worried that as the baby boom generation gets
older, the percentage of people in their 20s, a large
traveling group, is shrinking. They say baby boomers also may
be a little burned out from all their past trips.</p>
<p>"Americans went on a travel binge in the '80s," says John
Savich, director of the Michigan Travel Bureau. "Now, they
just have less of a drive to travel, particularly on long
trips."</p>
<p>Few analysts are optimistic that there will be a
turnaround this fall. Often, airlines drop fares in this
season, which gives the travel industry a boost. But fuel
prices are expected to rise sharply soon, and that could
discourage a lot of carriers from dropping prices. "If you
asked me a month ago, I would have said there would be
discounting in the fall," says Sky Magary, executive vice
president of marketing for Northwest Airlines, a unit of NWA
Inc. "Now, I'd say there would be less of it."</p>
