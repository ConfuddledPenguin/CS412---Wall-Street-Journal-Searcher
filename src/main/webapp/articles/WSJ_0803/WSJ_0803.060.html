	<p class="article-leader">JACKSON CENTER, Ohio -- Thor Industries Inc. said it filed
suit against Rexhall Industries Inc., alleging that Rexhall
violated a non-compete agreement, among other things. Thor is
seeking more than $10 million in damages.
   Thor, a maker of recreational vehicles, said the action
stems from its purchase in 1985 of Establishment Industries
Inc. from several individuals, including Rexhall's founder
and majority shareholder. At the time, Thor said it had
obtained non-compete agreements.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The suit, filed in Los Angeles federal district court,
also names Herbert F. Boeckmann II and William J. Rex. Mr.
Boeckmann was the principal shareholder of Establishment. Mr.
Rex, a former president of Establishment, is founder and
majority shareholder of Rexhall Industries, which is a
Saugus, Calif.-based maker of motor homes.</p>
<p>Officials at Rexhall couldn't immediately be reached for
comment.</p>
<p>Also a party in the suit is Airstream Inc., a Thor
subsidiary. Airstream alleges that Rexhall has unfairly
competed and infringed on a trademark. Airstream seeks to
enjoin the use of the trademark. The subsidiary also seeks
unspecified damages, Thor said.</p>
