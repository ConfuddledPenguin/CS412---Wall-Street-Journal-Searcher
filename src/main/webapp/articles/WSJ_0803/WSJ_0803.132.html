	<p class="article-leader">McDonnell Douglas Corp. adopted a shareholder rights plan
to guard against unwanted takeovers.
   Although the aerospace giant said the plan "isn't being
adopted in response to any effort to acquire control" of the
company, its balance sheet has been weakened of late by cost
overruns on several military programs and continued
development expenditures on the MD-11 commercial jet. The
company last month announced it will eliminate up to 17,000
jobs by year-end in an effort to cut costs by as much as $700
million annually.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Under the rights plan, shareholders of record Aug. 13 will
receive dividends allowing them to buy McDonnell Douglas
common stock at half price once a suitor gets 20% or more of
the company. If the suitor gets more than 20% but less than
50%, McDonnell Douglas has the option to exchange one share
of common stock, or a fractional share of a new series of
preferred, for each right other than those held by the
suitor.</p>
<p>The rights expire in 10 years unless redeemed earlier.
McDonnell Douglas may redeem the rights at one cent per right
any time until 10 business days following the acquisition of
a 20% stake in the firm.</p>
