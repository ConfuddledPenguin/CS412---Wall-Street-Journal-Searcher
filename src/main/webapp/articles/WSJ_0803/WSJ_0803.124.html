	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- The bipartisan budget talks sputtered to a
temporary halt as political maneuvering reduced the chances
for a substantial deficit-reduction accord before Election
Day.
   In a fitting conclusion to 12 weeks of unfruitful
bickering, negotiators spent days trying to agree on a choice
of secluded location where talks can resume after Labor Day
for a last try at reaching a compromise.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>If several days of hard bargaining in September fail, then
President Bush and the Democrats in Congess will probably be
forced to choose:</p>
<p>They can accept $85 billion or $100 billion in painful
spending cuts triggered by the Gramm-Rudman deficit-reduction
law, which could cripple the government just before the
elections. Or they can make the more likely choice of
agreeing on a "fig leaf," somehow altering the Gramm-Rudman
law to lighten the pain of spending cuts and delay the hard
choices until a lame-duck session or even next year.</p>
<p>As the talks recess for a month, a tug-of-war between the
urge to seek partisan advantage and the imperative to shrink
the deficit continues -- both within the two parties and
between them. House Democrats want to put forward a
deficit-reduction plan; Senate Democrats block them. Mr. Bush
concedes that tax increases are necessary; House Republicans
vow to oppose them. Republicans demand that the
Democratic-controlled Congress surrender some power over
spending; powerful Democrats, particularly Senate
Appropriations Committee Chairman Robert Byrd of West
Virginia, say they will never go along.</p>
<p>If the talks are to succeed in September, the partisan
urges will have to give way. But as the congressional
elections approach, that seems unlikely. Indeed, some
negotiators say only a new atmosphere of urgency -- perhaps
prompted by looming automatic spending cuts or a
deteriorating economy or an extraordinary presidential plea
-- will force a compromise that wipes out the deficit over
five years, which is the goal of the talks.</p>
<p>"Ultimately, there needs to be concurrence this really
needs to be done," says House Budget Committee Chairman Leon
Panetta of California, who is among the Democrats most eager
to cut a deal with the White House. "If that's not there,
it's not going to happen."</p>
<p>It's certainly not there yet. "There is not a sense of
crisis in the land," says Sen. Wyche Fowler (D., Ga.). "I do
not sense that -- outside of Washington -- they are waiting
with bated breath."</p>
<p>The familiar obstacles to a compromise remain. Democrats
want to tax the rich; Republicans don't. Republicans want to
cut government benefit programs deeply; Democrats are
reluctant. Democrats want a quick reduction in the Pentagon
budget; Republicans don't.</p>
<p>A less prominent issue also stands in the way, namely Mr.
Bush's insistence that Congress alter the budget process so
the appropriations committees have less freedom to spend.</p>
<p>"Without process change, I don't know how you get
something," says Senate Republican Leader Robert Dole of
Kansas. But powerful Sen. Byrd, the former majority leader
who now chairs the Appropriations Committee, is warning
privately that he will fight any erosion of Congress's power
over spending.</p>
<p>He has made the issue such a cause within Democratic
caucuses that fellow Democrats have grown weary of his
lectures, one of which he actually read. As his committee
considers fiscal 1991 spending bills, Sen. Byrd's leverage is
strengthened. He recently asked subcommittee chairmen to keep
a list of those who ask for home-state projects while
supporting Mr. Bush's proposal to give the president the
ability to knock out individual items from spending bills. He
was only half-joking.</p>
<p>The net result of all this politicking is that President
Bush's attempt to negotiate a deficit accord with Democrats
well in advance of a crisis and the fall election season has
failed.</p>
<p>The administration tried to cajole the Democrats, but the
bipartisan spirit was dissipated by anti-tax Republicans in
the House. It tried to scare the Democrats with frightening
figures about the spending cuts that loom should the budget
talks fail, but that just persuaded them that Mr. Bush won't
allow the cuts to take effect. And, most recently, the
administration threatened a barrage of partisan rhetoric, but
the message got garbled when House Minority Whip Newt
Gingrich (R., Ga.) delivered it so harshly that the White
House had to tone it down.</p>
<p>As a result, the Democrats have had a free ride for months
-- and they are enjoying it. "The president and the
Republican budget negotiators can't agree on what they want,
and it shows," Sen. Fowler said on the very day that the
administration was trying to put Democrats on the defensive.</p>
<p>Rep. Panetta and Sen. Fowler represent the two ends of the
tug-of-war within the Democratic camp. Rep. Panetta has been
arguing for months that Democrats ought to make concessions
and begin bargaining.</p>
<p>Sen. Fowler, more of a poker player, figures Mr. Bush
needs a budget agreement more than the Democrats do. He and
his allies argue that their sit-on-our-hands strategy
prompted the only significant move in the past 12 weeks: Mr.
Bush's abandonment of his campaign promise not to raise
taxes.</p>
<p>Among congressional Republicans, the roles are reversed.
Sen. Pete Domenici (R., N.M.), who has been wrestling with
the deficit for a decade now, keeps refining the
deficit-reduction plan in the thick red binders his staff has
been carrying around for weeks. But so far, it hasn't been
endorsed by Republicans, let alone offered to Democrats.</p>
<p>His antagonist within the GOP is Rep. Gingrich, the No. 2
House Republican. "The White House has been far more patient
than I would be," Rep. Gingrich says, explaining that Mr.
Bush "truly believes that other people can be convinced to be
reasonable." He adds: "The Democrats in Congress are doing
what they can to convince him that that's not a very smart
assessment."</p>
