	<p class="article-leader">Video Jukebox Network Inc. said Tele-Communications Inc.
has agreed to invest $5 million in the company for a roughly
10% stake, lending credibility to the fledgling pay-per-view
concern.
   Miami-based Video Jukebox operates a so-called interactive
cable-TV network that lets viewers select music videos they
want to watch by making a telephone call to a 900 number.
Phone companies bill callers $2.50 per request, keep as much
as 70 cents a call for themselves, and pay Video Jukebox the
rest.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Video Jukebox, in turn, shares 20% to 25% of its "jukebox"
revenue with cable operators that carry the network.</p>
<p>Denver-based Tele-Communications is the largest cable
operator in the U.S., controlling about 12 million
subscribers. Its cable system in Miami was the nation's first
system to carry the Video Jukebox Network, which now has
about 9.5 million subscribers. But since the network first
aired in 1985, no other Tele-Communications-owned systems
have added the channel to their offerings.</p>
<p>Hence, in addition to the equity investment,
Tele-Communications is now in an excellent position to boost
Video Jukebox's growth by distributing the channel to a wider
audience.</p>
<p>"I love this interactive stuff," said Peter Barton,
Tele-Communications' senior vice president of programming.
"It enhances the audience's relationship with the TV set.
Customers like it. We're very bullish on it."</p>
<p>In over-the-counter trading yesterday, Video Jukebox's
shares rose $1.25 to close at $7 bid.</p>
<p>Though Video Jukebox is the most interactive of cable
networks on the air today, its technology is still a long way
from where media analysts and the company's own executives
say the industry is headed. Its 9.5 million subscribers are
divided among 109 separate "jukeboxes" nationally, meaning
that viewers must wait while the requests of other
subscribers connected to a given system are played before
their own request comes on.</p>
<p>Eventually, with the spread of fiber-optic networks that
can carry massive amounts of data, Video Jukebox and others
will be able to sell customized TV programs to individual
homes.</p>
<p>Currently, said Andrew Orgel, Video Jukebox's president
and chief executive officer, the average wait per Jukebox
Video request is about 25 minutes, depending on the market
and time of day.</p>
<p>"We feel somebody should have to wait no more than 40
minutes to see a video," said Mr. Orgel. The channel, he
said, wants to develop one "jukebox" system for every 30,000
to 40,000 subscribers. The ratio is currently one for every
87,000 viewers.</p>
<p>Mr. Orgel said the company also wants to sell between
three minutes and six minutes per hour of advertising time,
beginning later this year. And he said Video Jukebox is
planning to test a non-music network, using the same
technology, in the fourth quarter.</p>
<p>John Reddan, an analyst with John Moran & Associates, said
Video Jukebox's revenue per "jukebox" system has grown 12% in
the past 18 months. He estimates the company now collects
$11,000 per system per month, compared with $9,800 in the
beginning of 1989 -- without having advertised the channel.</p>
<p>"The future of TV is interactive, but that's really many
years away," said Mr. Reddan. "This is interactive today."</p>
<p>For the first quarter, Video Jukebox posted a loss of
$322,147, or three cents a share, compared with a loss of
$680,804, or 10 cents a share, a year earlier. Its revenue
climbed in the quarter to $2.6 million from $376,986.</p>
