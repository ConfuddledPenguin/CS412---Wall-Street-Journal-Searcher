	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- The House voted to let airports slap
departure taxes of up to $3 on passengers, but the Senate may
ground the proposal.
   The House bill would let the nation's 71 largest airports
impose the fees to pay for airport expansion and noise
reduction. There would be a limit of two charges per one-way
trip, but a passenger could end up paying as much as $12 on a
round trip with intermediate stops.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>After a contentious debate, the House, by a 252-171 vote,
rebuffed a bid by Rep. Doug Bosco (D., Calif.) to delete the
provision permitting the taxes.</p>
<p>"Airline passengers are once again on the verge of being
taken for a ride by the White House," said Rep. Norman Mineta
(D., Calif.), an opponent of the fees, officially dubbed
passenger facilities charges. "The Congress shouldn't license
this slap at the consumer." He said the government should
first spend the $8 billion surplus in the aviation trust
fund, which is financed by the 8% airline ticket tax.</p>
<p>But Glenn Anderson (D., Calif.), chairman of the House
Public Works and Transportation Committee, argued that the
new fees are needed to augment the spending.</p>
<p>Transportation Secretary Samuel Skinner has made approval
of the fees a top priority, and that was reflected in the
vote on the Bosco amendment. Republicans voted overwhelmingly
against the amendment, while Democrats were split.</p>
<p>Still pending before Congress is a Bush administration
proposal to increase the airline ticket tax to 10% from 8%.
That proposal is expected to be adopted as part of the budget
negotiations.</p>
<p>The House bill also authorizes $17.7 billion in spending
by the Federal Aviation Administration on airport development
and air-traffic control programs for the next two years. The
final vote on the bill was 405-15.</p>
<p>In the Senate, prospects for the legislation are murky.
Sen. Ernest Hollings (D., S.C.), chairman of the Commerce
Committee, and Sen. Wendell Ford, (D., Ky.), chairman of the
aviation subcommittee, oppose the passenger facilities
charges. According to their aides, the senators don't plan to
pass an FAA authorization bill this year because they don't
want to provide a vehicle for the departure-tax provision.
The agency would receive funding in any case.</p>
<p>Congress banned departure taxes in the early 1970s because
some local governments were using the money for non-airport
projects -- a practice prohibited under the new House bill.
Airports levying departure taxes would be required to
relinquish up to half of their regular federal funding. Most
of the unused federal funds would go to a discretionary fund
for smaller airports.</p>
