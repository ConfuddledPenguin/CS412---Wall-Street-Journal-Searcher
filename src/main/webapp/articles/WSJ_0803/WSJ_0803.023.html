	<p class="article-leader">Regarding "Davis-Bacon: Racist Then, Racist Now" by Scott
Alan Hodge of the Heritage Foundation (editorial page, June
25): First, Mr. Hodge states that the "Davis-Bacon {Act} was
written to prevent black workers, mostly from the South, from
competing with Northern construction trades," when in fact on
March 19, 1928, a letter from the Commissioner of Labor
Statistics stated that a Southern contractor on Long Island
had "brought with him an entire outfit of Negro laborers from
the South, housed them in barracks and boxcars, permitting no
one to see them." We submit this legislation was passed to
prevent exploitation of all workers, and not, as Mr. Hodge
suggests, to prevent black workers from competing for jobs.
   Second, Mr. Hodge asserts that "the Labor Department uses
local union wage scales as a proxy for the `prevailing
wage,'" when in fact a 1986 study of 3,358 wage decisions
issued by the Labor Department showed only 881, or 26.2%,
were based on union rates.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Third, Mr. Hodge's statement that the "debate on
Davis-Bacon has focused primarily on its costs, the estimated
$1.5 billion it costs U.S. taxpayers to pay union scale," is
unprovable. We have already proved that these rates are not
based on union scale; our study also showed that 44.7% of the
1986 decisions issued provided a wage rate below the poverty
level recognized by the Census Bureau. In fact, we found
prevailing wages issued in 77 decisions that were at or below
the minimum wage.</p>
