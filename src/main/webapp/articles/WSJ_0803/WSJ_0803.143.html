	<p class="article-leader">TI Group PLC, a British industrial-engineering concern,
said pretax profit jumped 29% in the six months ended June
30, as growth in most of its core activities continued
despite difficult conditions in some of its key markets.
   Pretax profit rose to #63.3 million ($117.5 million) from
#49.2 million a year earlier, hitting the top end of the
range of market expectations.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Profit after taxes and minorities firmed 28% to #42.5
million from #33.1 million, while per-share earnings were up
22% at 27.0 pence from 22.2 pence.</p>
<p>Net profit attributable to shareholders gained 29% to
#41.7 million pounds from #32.3 million after an #800,000 net
extraordinary loss on the closure and disposal of businesses.
The extraordinary loss was equal to that reported a year
earlier.</p>
