	<p class="article-leader">A USX Corp. spokesman said the company will invest about
$200 million in a pipeline in the North Sea to transport gas
to the United Kingdom.
   Pittsburgh-based USX had said it would become 20% owner of
the 148-mile pipeline, which will transport gas from the
company's Brae fields. Those fields have an estimated 2.3
trillion cubic feet of gas, of which USX owns about 900
billion cubic feet.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Separately, USX said it is offering $800 million principal
amount at maturity ($251.1 million of gross proceeds) of zero
coupon convertible senior debentures due 2005.</p>
<p>First Boston Corp. is managing the underwriting syndicate.</p>
<p>Each debenture is offered at $313.93 per $1,000 principal
amount at maturity and is convertible at the option of the
holder -- at any time on or prior to maturity -- into, at the
company's option, 8.207 shares of USX common stock or cash.
The conversion rate is based upon an initial premium of 12.1%
above USX's closing stock price of $34.125 on Wednesday.</p>
