	<p class="article-leader">Benham Capital Management Group is hoping to lead the
mutual fund industry into the future by drawing on its
chairman's past.
   The chairman, James Benham, spent seven years as a Merrill
Lynch stockbroker before launching the Mountain View, Calif.,
fund company in 1972. As a broker, he found that limit orders
-- buy and sell orders that are triggered if a stock hits a
predetermined price -- were a favorite trading technique with
some customers.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Now Mr. Benham is hoping limit orders will prove equally
popular with mutual fund investors. On Aug. 13, Benham, which
has $6.3 billion in assets, will launch its "open order"
service, which will allow investors to buy and sell mutual
fund shares at predetermined prices.</p>
<p>Mr. Benham reckons the open order service will catch on
with investors in Benham's gold stock index fund and its
seven zero-coupon bond funds. "We probably have share prices
as volatile as anybody's," Mr. Benham says. "Some of those
{zero-coupon} funds move as much as 5% in one day." A
zero-coupon bond pays no interest, so the investor instead
can make gains from the narrowing of the bond's discount as
the redemption date approaches.</p>
<p>Here is how the open order system will work. If a Benham
money market investor wants to buy, say, one of the fund
group's volatile zero-coupon bond funds, he will specify a
buy price that is lower than the bond fund's current share
price. If the bond fund falls to the specified price, money
is automatically switched out of the shareholder's money
market fund and into the bond fund.</p>
<p>Benham also will allow shareholders in its gold and bond
funds to sell at predetermined prices that are above the
current fund share price. If the fund share price hits this
predetermined price, Benham will switch the shareholder's
money into one of its five money market funds.</p>
<p>There will be no charge for switching among Benham's 21
no-load funds, though shareholders will be limited each year
to six round-trip exchanges for each fund. Mr. Benham says,
"We're not trying to turn people into traders."</p>
<p>Mr. Benham had also hoped to introduce a variation on the
stop-loss order, which stock investors use to limit their
losses in the stock market. With a stop-loss order, a stock
position is automatically sold if the share price falls to a
specified level.</p>
<p>But the Securities and Exchange Commission said it had
some concerns about stop-loss orders, so Mr. Benham decided
to seek approval only for the open order system. "In perhaps
six months or a year, we'll go back and apply for stop-loss
orders," he says.</p>
<p>News of the innovation has received a tepid response from
others in the fund industry. "It is very innovative," says
Neal Litvack, a marketing vice president with Fidelity
Investments of Boston. "We'll be watching it very carefully.
But from a conceptual standpoint, it does run contrary to the
investment approach that we advocate to our investors, which
is a buy-and-hold approach."</p>
<p>Kurt Brouwer, president of Brouwer & Janachowski, a San
Francisco investment advisory firm, doubts that the idea will
catch on. "You're kind of encouraging people to trade, and
most fund groups don't want to do that," Mr. Brouwer says.</p>
<p>"I don't think we're going to lose any shareholders over
this," says a spokesman for T. Rowe Price Associates,
Baltimore, who reckons the open order system will encourage
needless short-term trading.</p>
