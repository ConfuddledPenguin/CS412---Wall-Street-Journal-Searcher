	<p class="article-leader">WICHITA, Kan. -- Kansas Gas & Electric Co. said its board
recommended that shareholders reject the $27-a-share, or
about $857 million, hostile tender offer launched last month
by Kansas City Power & Light Inc.
   The utility's response wasn't unexpected; earlier this
week, it filed suit to, among other things, block its
unwanted suitor from looking at its holder list.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Kansas Gas & Electric said its financial adviser, Morgan
Stanley & Co., considered the offer price inadequate.
Directors cited reservations about the "many conditions"
Kansas City P&L placed on its offer, and the "many months,
perhaps more than a year, that could be required in
attempting to satisfy those conditions, if indeed they can
all be satisfied."</p>
<p>Kansas Gas & Electric said the offer "doesn't reflect the
values inherent in the company," and "raises substantial and
serious legal questions and numerous uncertainties under
federal and state statutes." Kansas City P&L has said its bid
is in "full compliance with all applicable laws."</p>
<p>The two neighboring utilities already jointly own 94% of a
big nuclear plant. Kansas City P&L launched its unusual
hostile bid after repeated overtures for a friendly deal
failed.</p>
<p>Kansas City P&L said yesterday it believes the bid price
is "full and fair." It added, "We continue to emphasize our
strong desire to achieve a negotiated transaction."</p>
