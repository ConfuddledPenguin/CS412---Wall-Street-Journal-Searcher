insensitive are funding municipal aquariums." -- Fortune)</p>
<p>Some companies who've had bad press</p>
<p>(More so than they would wish),</p>
<p>In looking to improve PR</p>
<p>Are reeling in the fish.</p>
<p>They're pouring money into plans</p>
<p>To house aquatic creatures,</p>
<p>Hoping generosity</p>
<p>Will dampen other features.</p>
<p>They hope to drown their critics out,</p>
<p>To silence or to bury 'em;</p>
<p>They look forward to the dawning of</p>
<p>The new Age of Aquarium.</p>

<p>Mature Judgment</p>
<p>Everything's relative, they say,</p>
<p>And that goes for the passage of time:</p>
<p>Old age is always fifteen years</p>
<p>Older than what I'm.</p>
