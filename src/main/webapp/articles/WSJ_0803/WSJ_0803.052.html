	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- Imagine being paid as much as $50,000 a year
to do such things as standing for hours in the hallway of a
public building.
   Of course, it isn't just any hallway. Still bleary-eyed at
7:15 a.m., Terry Bolger waits in the marble hallway of a
congressional office building, second in a line outside the
regal, chandeliered chamber where the House Ways and Means
Committee writes the nation's tax laws.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>By the time the committee convenes hours later, more than
a hundred people will have lined up behind Mr. Bolger, a tax
analyst for the public-relations firm of Hill & Knowlton Inc.
Like him, most will be buttonholing congressional staffers,
poring through committee papers, and jostling each other, all
in the attempt to glean the smallest bit of information, or
even of rumor, about what the committee may do next.</p>
<p>Mr. Bolger and his colleagues represent a relatively new
creature in Washington: the information-gatherer who chases
paper for his employer, usually a law, public-relations or
accounting firm.</p>
<p>Unlike the stereotypical glad-handing lobbyist, these
agents don't seek to persuade politicians, only to collect
information before anyone else knows it exists and to speed
it to their employers' clients. And while the fat-cat
lobbyists focus on the 535 people in Congress who vote on
issues, the information-gatherers work on the hordes of
staffers who work for those people.</p>
<p>With budget summiteers meeting behind closed doors to
negotiate what could become a large tax increase, the
information-gatherers are hard at work, looking for any
tidbits about the tax package that may emerge.</p>
<p>"Our job is the paper chase," says Catherine Schultz, who
pursues tax information for the Washington law firm of Miller
& Chevalier. "If there is an inkling that something might be
out there, we've got to get it. Time is a very crucial
element." The information she collects is used in myriad
ways. One client might want an early warning about a possible
tax change so it can try to head off the change before the
rumor solidifies into legislation. Another might want to
complete a contemplated corporate acquisition before a tax
loophole favoring it is closed.</p>
<p>Other major congressional committees are also watched
closely. But Ground Zero for the information-gatherers is the
hallway by the Ways and Means Committee, where offhand
decisions made quickly in the wee hours can cost corporations
and investors billions of dollars. A little-noticed
anti-takeover tax bill approved by the committee in October
1987, for example, was later cited as a factor in that
month's stock-market crash. So it is at Ways and Means that
the elite of the information-gatherers has formed a
tight-knit network.</p>
<p>Until the 1980s, no such class of data-oriented lobbyists
existed. Congress-watching was simpler when congressional
power was more concentrated. Until the early 1970s, big-time
lobbyists generally could track a committee just by knowing
the thinking of its chairman.</p>
<p>But now power is more dispersed among members of Congress.
That means junior members must be watched. It also means
those junior members can hire more staffers, who themselves
can be valuable sources of information. Since 1972, the
number of staffers on Capitol Hill has increased about 50% to
about 30,000.</p>
<p>During the 1980s, Ways and Means moved a tax bill almost
every year, making watching it a full-time, year-round task.
As the tax bills proliferated, so did the people who are paid
to monitor them. They are characterized by their cellular
telephones, used to quickly communicate with clients, and
their generous expense accounts, used to schmooze
congressional staffers.</p>
<p>At first the information-gatherers tended to operate
separately. But the ups and downs of the sweeping 1986 tax
bill sensitized much of corporate America to the importance
of unrelentingly keeping track of what the Ways and Means was
up to. The market for these legislative monitors boomed.</p>
<p>Over the years, information-gatherers for law, accounting
and public-relations firms have formed an informal
data-sharing network. Not unlike the groups that occasionally
spring up among reporters on a beat, the network's
approximately 30 members share information.</p>
<p>"Everybody doing it on their own would be just horrible,"
says Ms. Schultz, a resourceful 32-year-old considered one of
the best of the group. "I may talk to a staff person and you
might talk to a committee member, while someone else may get
a document, and then we share notes."</p>
<p>Two unspoken but crucial rules govern the group: Be
accurate, and share what you get as soon as possible.
Intentional violators of these rules are ostracized.</p>
<p>And violations do occur. Jean Hartman, who follows tax
legislation for Deloitte & Touche, the big accounting firm,
recalls a colleague asking to borrow a document to copy in a
nearby congressional office. When she stepped outside a few
minutes later for a breath of air, Ms. Hartman saw the woman
hailing a cab to go downtown with another lobbyist.</p>
<p>But generally, network members cooperate. Two years ago,
for example, Ms. Schultz and a few others sensed that the
conventional wisdom was wrong on an obscure provision of the
pending Technical and Miscellaneous Revenue Act of 1988.</p>
<p>"Everybody was saying that the bill was dead,"she
remembers. "But a few of us didn't give up on it." Early one
evening she and her colleagues camped out in front of an
office where an informal meeting was taking place and waited
for a hint of a deal.</p>
<p>At 3 a.m., some staff people who had been in a back room
with Ways and Means Committee Chairman Dan Rostenkowski (D.,
Ill.) emerged and indicated the bill was in fact alive. That
meant a provision in the bill extending the government's
authority to issue bonds was alive, and that information
alone was expected to give the bond market a slight boost.</p>
<p>This was news that Ms. Schultz's bond-trading clients on
Wall Street could use. Despite the hour, she ran to a phone
and began notifying them, and they were grateful to be
roused. "The clients, basically, were thrilled to know that
we were able to get that information when everyone else
thought it was a dead issue," she says.</p>
<p>"It's a very, very strong network," says Lori Pickford,
who follows the tax committee for the New York law firm of
Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom. During last year's tax
bill, she said, "We worked 24 hours around the clock. When
you spend that much time together, you get on a more personal
level." Indeed, insiders count four marriages among network
members over the last five years.</p>
