	<p class="article-leader">SOVIETS' CHEMICAL WEAPONS</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The Soviet Union has a stockpile of 40,000 tons of
chemical weapons, about 10,000 tons less than previous
independent estimates, the country's commander of chemical
forces was quoted as saying.</p>
<p>The weapons are all stored in Soviet territory, Stanislav
Petrov was quoted as telling the Communist Party newspaper
Pravda. Mr. Petrov told Pravda there are no facilities in the
Soviet Union to destroy the chemical weapons, despite a
superpower agreement to eliminate 80% of them immediately.</p>
<p>A destruction plant was built at Chapayevsk, 550 miles
southwest of Moscow, but was closed last summer after local
residents complained it would add to already high pollution
levels. Mr. Petrov told Pravda the Chapayevsk site would
become a training center for workers who destroy chemical
weapons.</p>
<p>The Supreme Soviet legislature was asked to find a safe
site to build a replacement for the Chapayevsk facility, but
so far no lawmaker has volunteered a district in which to
place the plant.</p>
<p>WORLD SUMMIT FOR CHILDREN</p>
<p>Thirty-eight presidents (including George Bush), 20 prime
ministers and two kings have confirmed that they will
participate in the World Summit for Children at the United
Nations this September, organizers said, adding that it would
be the largest gathering of world leaders in history. Some 80
leaders have yet to respond. The gathering, whose
co-chairpersons are Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto of Pakistan
and Prime Minister Brian Mulroney of Canada, will focus on
such topics as disease prevention, nutrition, education and
child labor.</p>
<p>STRIKE THREAT IN BRAZIL</p>
<p>Brazilian oil workers want a 280% pay raise from the state
oil monopoly Petrobras and will strike in September if their
demands are not met, a union leader said. "The 280% figure
represents losses caused by inflation during the last year,"
said Mozart Queiroz, a director of the Oil Workers Union. "If
we cannot reach an accord we will begin a strike on Sept. 4."
Petrobras, which produces 665,000 barrels of oil per day, has
about 60,000 workers represented by 19 unions nationwide. Mr.
Queiroz said he expected Petrobras to offer a raise of
between 60% and 70%.</p>
<p>EUROPEAN EXPORT CAMPAIGN</p>
<p>The European Community is planning a major
export-promotion campaign in Japan. EC officials said a
multimedia advertising campaign to improve the image of
European products would be launched next year with a budget
of well over $1 million. The campaign will focus on four
industries: furniture, jewelry, health foods and testing and
measuring equipment. The Japanese must realize that there is
more to be found in Europe than Gucci shoes and Louis Vuitton
bags, EC officials said.</p>
<p>AIDS IN UGANDA</p>
<p>At least one million Ugandans -- out of a population of
about 17 million -- are believed to be infected with the AIDS
virus, said Samuel Okware, head of Uganda's AIDS-control
program. He said that as of July there were 17,000 diagnosed
AIDS cases in Uganda, an increase of nearly 50% from the
number recorded in December. Dr. Okware also said that
heterosexual contacts were responsible for more than 90% of
AIDS cases diagnosed in Uganda and that slightly more women
were dying of the disease than men.</p>
<p>JAPANESE RESEARCH</p>
<p>Joint research projects between companies and universities
are on the rise in Japan, jumping 21% in fiscal 1989, ended
last March, from the previous fiscal year, the Education
Ministry said. Ministry officials said the fiscal 1989 total,
705 projects, was five times the number in 1982 when the
joint industry-university research system started. The
officials said joint research projects in fiscal 1989
amounted to 3.37 billion yen ($22.9 million), a fivefold
surge from fiscal 1982.</p>
<p>AN ORDER FROM THE EC</p>
<p>The European Community ordered Spain to allow private
express-mail companies to compete with the state postal
service for international deliveries.</p>
<p>The EC said Spain's post-office monopoly violates EC
competition law and gave the government two months to change
its rules. Meanwhile, the community is putting pressure on
Danish authorities to abandon similar practices.</p>
<p>Because of EC action since 1984, West Germany, France,
Belgium and Italy have abandoned most curbs placed on
international courier firms. The community has also ordered
the Netherlands to scrap restrictive practices, but that
country is appealing the decision to the European Court of
Justice.</p>
<p>The latest move is "further evidence of the {EC}
commission's determination" to ensure that the express-mail
market is open to competition, said Michael D'Arcy of the
Dublin-based International Express Courier Conference.</p>
<p>POSTSCRIPTS . . .</p>
<p>Soviet newspapers hailed the nation's first press-freedom
law, which took effect Wednesday. "Goodbye censorship," read
a headline in the government newspaper Izvestia. . . . Rather
than destroy surplus apples, oranges and lemons, the European
Community wants to hand the fruit out to charitable
organizations and the poor. The commission's budget will pay
for handling and packaging costs.</p>
