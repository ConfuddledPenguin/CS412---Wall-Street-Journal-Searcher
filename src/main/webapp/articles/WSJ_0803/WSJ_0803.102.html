	<p class="article-leader">EL SEGUNDO, Calif. -- The Environmental Protection Agency
said it served Rockwell International Corp. with a federal
enforcement order charging hazardous waste violations at its
facility in Palmdale, Calif.
   The EPA said it proposed a civil penalty of $54,400. In
addition to paying the penalty, Rockwell was ordered to come
into compliance with Federal hazardous waste regulations
within 30 days.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Rockwell, a defense and industrial concern, said a March
EPA audit of its Palmdale facility determined that there were
nine violations of applicable environmental regulations. Five
of these violations were corrected within one week of the
inspection and another one was corrected in July, Rockwell
said. The company said it is working with the EPA to resolve
the remaining issues to insure full compliance with federal
regulations.</p>
