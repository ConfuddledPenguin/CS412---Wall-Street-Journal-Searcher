	<p class="article-leader">A Transportation Department administrative law judge
recommended that United Airlines be selected to fly the
highly sought Chicago-Tokyo route, saying the carrier's
proposal is "substantially superior" to one by its arch
rival, American Airlines.
   The recommendation by John Mathias, the administrative law
judge, was a big boost for the unit of Chicago-based UAL
Corp. and a stinging disappointment for American, a unit of
AMR Corp., Fort Worth, Texas.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>But the contest for the potentially lucrative route is far
from over. The case now goes to Patrick Murphy, deputy
secretary for policy and international affairs, who will
review Mr. Mathias's recommendation and consider any appeals
that are filed. His decision, in turn, will be reviewed by
top department officials.</p>
<p>The Chicago-Tokyo route is one of six to be handed out by
the Transportation Department by Nov. 3. Under a pact with
Japan signed last November, the U.S. may grant passenger and
cargo flying rights between six U.S. cities and Japan. Three
routes will involve Tokyo.</p>
<p>Mr. Mathias made the following recommendations yesterday
for the other routes: Atlanta-based Delta Air Lines, Los
Angeles-Tokyo and Portland, Ore.-Nagoya, Japan; American, San
Jose, Calif.-Tokyo; Phoenix, Ariz.-based American West
Airlines, Honolulu-Nagoya; and the Continental Airlines unit
of Houston-based Continental Airlines Holdings Inc.,
Seattle-Nagoya.</p>
<p>Airline industry officials have been closely watching the
Japan route case, particularly because of the financial
stakes involved. The six routes up for grabs -- especially
the three to Tokyo -- are considered hefty revenue
generators. Traffic in the Pacific Rim is expanding about 20%
annually, more than twice the rate of domestic growth, and
passengers who travel on these long flights usually are
business travelers willing to pay high fares. UAL has
projected it would gain $300 million in revenue annually from
the Chicago-Tokyo route alone.</p>
<p>The administrative law judge, in his recommendation on the
Chicago-Tokyo route, said United would be a stronger
competitor than American. "The record evidence shows that on
an international market level, American cannot compete with
JAL (Japan Air Lines) and Northwest out of the Chicago market
to the extent United can," he said. Northwest Airlines is a
unit of NWA Inc., St. Paul, Minn.</p>
<p>Mr. Mathias also said that "American is totally unable to
match" service provided beyond Tokyo to other Asian cities by
JAL and Northwest. He did recommend that backup authority be
granted to American, but such authority is rarely used.</p>
<p>The administrative law judge's recommendation was
especially disappointing for American, because the
department's public counsel had endorsed the airline for the
route. The public counsel is a department lawyer charged with
representing the "public interest." In this case, Public
Counsel Thomas Mahoney concluded that awarding American the
route would foster competition, because United already has a
strong presence in the Pacific Rim.</p>
<p>American has been counting on getting the route to boost
its ambitious plans to become a global carrier. The airline
already has expansions of its trans-Atlantic and Latin
American route systems in the works. Routes to the Pacific
would have completed the picture.</p>
<p>"We're bitterly disappointed," American said in a
statement that was highly critical of yesterday's
recommendation, because of United's existing route network in
the Pacific. "We can only conclude that the plethora of
political endorsements United was able to secure were given
greater weight than we believe were appropriate."</p>
<p>American had tentatively agreed, subject to a favorable
recommendation from the administrative law judge, to buy two
new Boeing Co. 747-400 aircraft, a bow to the department's
preference to award routes to the airline that can fly the
most passengers. At $330 million for the pair of jets,
American was to pay a hefty premium for the planes,
especially as it usually prefers smaller, more cost-efficient
jetliners.</p>
<p>American also lost out in its bid to fly between Los
Angeles and Nagoya, dimming its Pacific ambitions. The route
recommendations, American said, "will have a profoundly
adverse impact on our company."</p>
<p>Stephen Wolf, UAL chairman, said that if United is chosen,
"the ability of the U.S. to compete in the international
marketplace will be strengthened."</p>
