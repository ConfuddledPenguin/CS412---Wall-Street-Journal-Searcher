	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Around International Business Machines Corp.
in the 1960s, typewriter salesmen were known for spending so
much time sweet-talking secretaries that the typewriter
business became known as "the romance division."
   These days, IBMers sometimes call it "the pots and pans
division," and the employees in Lexington, Ky., who make the
machines "the boat people." Typewriters aren't the wave of
the future.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>So maybe it was inevitable that IBM would get out of the
typewriter business, and this week, the computer giant
announced its intention to sell it. The buyer is Clayton &
Dubilier, a New York investment firm. For IBM, the sale will
end its already moribund Selectric Era, when its typewriters
were found everywhere in corporate America and even in many
homes and college dormitories.</p>
<p>From the 1960s on, IBM sold 15 million Selectrics, the
most popular typewriters ever. For much of that period IBM,
with 80% of the total American typewriter market, dominated
it more than it does the computer industry today.</p>
<p>A generation of typists loved the ease with which they
could change the Selectric's typeface by removing the
"golfball," its round typing element. They loved the way the
golf ball moved across the page, so that the carriage needed
no return, making it unlikely to knock over a cup of coffee
or a stack of paper. The keyboard of the heavy, long-lived
Selectric had a rock-solid feel; even today,
personal-computer makers tout their "Selectric-style
keyboards." And when a fast typist worked the Selectric, he
-- or she -- made music, a muted clatter of wordwork done
well.</p>
<p>Even today, a lot of people won't give up their
Selectrics. Ron Javers, editor of Philadelphia magazine, says
he still does almost all his work on the Correcting Selectric
that sits next to his personal computer. He says the staff
kids him that he turns on the computer only to get some light
on the Selectric. "I've never lost a story on the
typewriter," he says. "I've lost a few on the computer."</p>
<p>Gibson Carothers, a Minneapolis gag writer who used a
Selectric to produce such coffee-mug lines as "Life's a
beach" and "Life's a bitch, and then you die," says he's been
using a Selectric for 25 years and isn't about to stop now.
"I love it," he says. Now he's using the machine to write
messages for wastebaskets -- such as "Thank you for your
suggestion."</p>
<p>The Selectric has made history. When the Soviets managed
to eavesdrop on the U.S. Embassy in Moscow in the mid-1980s,
they did it by slipping bugs into hollowed-out parts of the
embassy's Selectrics. Stephen Cannell, a Hollywood producer
known for his devotion to the Selectric, used one to produce
the scripts for such series as "The A-Team" and "Hunter" --
either a point for, or a point against, the Selectric,
depending on your tastes. Tom Clancy used his Selectric to
write "The Hunt for Red October," although he has since
defected to a Macintosh computer.</p>
<p>IBM's electric typewriter business actually began during
the Depression, when IBM became the first company to
successfully market an electric model. Many companies had
spent decades trying to perfect one. The first IBM was an
ugly black machine with red keys. Other ugly machines
succeeded it. Attachments to hold ribbons made one look as if
it had ears.</p>
<p>The typewriter business got a bit of pizazz in the 1950s.
Among other things, IBM made a white machine, for the
chairman to present to Pope Pius XII. Not until the Selectric
appeared 29 years ago this week, however, did IBM achieve its
near monopoly.</p>
<p>IBM made the Selectric in a variety of colors, and
emphasized color in its marketing so much that the company
sometimes seemed to be in the office-decor business. Amy
Wohl, now a consultant in Bala Cynwyd, Pa., says that when
she was a secretary at an ad agency she once ordered emerald
green Selectrics to match the office furniture.</p>
<p>Shari Dunston, an IBM marketing executive, says someone in
Tennessee once ordered a Selectric in University of Tennessee
orange. The customer sent IBM a pennant to show the exact
color. As the machine went down the IBM assembly line, the
pennant went with it.</p>
<p>In football, Kentucky and Tennessee are archrivals. And
IBM's Kentucky employees, Ms. Dunston says, were tempted to
ruin the Tennessee orange. Good humor prevailed. When the
Tennessee fan got his Selectric and lifted the top off, he
found the message "Go Big Blue" inside -- Big Blue, in this
case, meaning Kentucky, not IBM.</p>
<p>In the early 1970s, IBM introduced the Correcting
Selectric. It came with a kind of sticky ribbon to lift
errors from the page. That really clinched IBM's control of
the market. When Exxon Corp. tried to make a splash in the
office equipment market in the late 1970s, Ms. Wohl says,
some Exxon executives bragged to her that they had hired a
well-regarded IBM Selectric salesman. "I just laughed," she
says. IBM had the market so sewn up that, she says, "the IBM
salesman didn't have to sell these things at all. They just
took orders for them."</p>
<p>IBM held patents that kept anyone else from cloning a
Selectric. Exxon never succeeded in office equipment and gave
up in the mid-1980s after spending $500 million on its
effort. By this time, however, electronic word processing had
begun to spread, and Selectric sales peaked. By the
mid-1980s, typing classes at many high schools had been
replaced by "keyboarding" classes.</p>
<p>IBM fought back by adding electronic features to the
typewriters -- a spelling checker, memory, a digital display
and others. That helped to keep the typewriter business
profitable even though its growth had stopped.</p>
<p>Still, IBM lost more than half its share of the typing (or
word-processing) market as new technologies took hold. IBM
tried to double the Selectric's speed to keep up with some
computer printers but never managed it. IBM introduced a
typewriter that displayed a page of type on a tiny screen,
but typists were accustomed to seeing a full-size page. The
machine became, in IBM parlance, a "boat anchor" -- which
nobody can type with.</p>
<p>The buyer of IBM's typewriter business will be able to use
the IBM name for some years, so the logo will remain on store
shelves for a while yet. It will take longer for the 15
million existing Selectrics to give up the ghost, although
they will be used mainly for typing envelopes. IBM has
already dropped the Selectric name. It did so in 1987, after
the typewriter had evolved beyond much resemblance to the
orginal.</p>
<p>Larry Bacon, a senior vice president in charge of data
processing at Travelers Corp., says it has been ages since he
has seen a typewriter in daily use at the insurance company.
He does know of one Selectric that's still around, tucked
behind a pillar in a data center. Sometimes, late at night
when things are quiet, over the hum of the millions of
dollars of mainframes, you can still hear someone hunting and
pecking out a note on the old machine.</p>
