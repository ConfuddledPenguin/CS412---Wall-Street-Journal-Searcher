	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Saddam Hussein's war is bad news on Wall
Street.
   Although oil and defense stocks rallied yesterday, the
market sank on fears that Iraq's invasion of Kuwait will lead
to sustained higher oil prices, dragging down broad swatches
of the economy as the oil shocks of the 1970s did.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Analysts warned that the outlook for corporate earnings,
inflation and economic growth has darkened appreciably.</p>
<p>"Fundamentally, it's not good for bonds. It's not good for
corporate earnings. And therefore, it's not good for stocks,"
says Steven Einhorn, the investment strategist at Goldman,
Sachs.</p>
<p>According to Mr. Einhorn, only about 15% of the issues in
the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index are energy-related and
could benefit from yesterday's news. For the other 85%, war
news was bad news.</p>
<p>And Wall Street, which had seemed to be laughing off one
piece of bad news after another, was gloomy yesterday on the
general economic outlook. "The economy was teetering on a
cliff anyway," says Michael Harkins, an investor in New York
who isn't new to bearishness. "This could push it over" into
recession.</p>
<p>Though the jury is out on that one, few dispute that
higher oil prices raise the risk of recession. Put simply,
because the U.S. is an importer, a rise in prices "siphons
purchasing power to external sources," says Richard Rippe,
economist at Dean Witter.</p>
<p>And in some sense that goes deeper than the impact on oil
prices, Wall Street seems to fear that the invasion marked a
turning point.</p>
<p>The invasion and higher oil prices, for instance, could
revive both the expectation and the reality of inflation,
worsen the U.S. trade deficit and make it tougher for
Congress to cut defense spending and arrive at a budget
agreement. And for all those reasons, the Federal Reserve may
be less apt to loosen credit.</p>
<p>Call it a nest egg for less certain times: John Connolly,
chief investment strategist at Dean Witter, yesterday
recommended that the firm's clients move 20% of their
investment portfolios into cash.</p>
<p>"This is not a passing event," Mr. Connolly says. "This is
not something that is going to go away this afternoon. It is
a basic change in oil politics in the Middle East."</p>
<p>But while it never hurts to have some liquid assets, in
general, the notion that one should realign assets according
to the morning's headlines is highly suspect. So much, in
this case, depends on the actions of an Iraqi dictator who is
unlikely to tip off your broker before he changes course.</p>
<p>And oil prices have had a history of doing the unexpected.
As Shad Rowe, an investor in Dallas, points out, "although
everybody is getting excited, that doesn't alter the fact
that oil is in oversupply."</p>
<p>Iraq intends to cut back on supply. The question, as Mr.
Rowe frames it, is: "Is the Iraqi army more powerful than
supply and demand?"</p>
<p>If the crisis is resolved quickly, says Stefan Abrams,
chief investment strategist at Kidder Peabody, "all we're
looking at is a moderate increase in the price of oil." That
would be disruptive, he says, but not catastrophic.</p>
<p>However, Abby Joseph Cohen, U.S. strategist for Barclays
de Zoete Wedd, says the invasion comes at an especially bad
time for the stock market.</p>
<p>"The way the market has been priced {relative to earnings
and interest rates}, you had to believe the bullish story" to
invest, she says. Wall Street, she notes, has been
forecasting earnings of about $25 a share for the S&P 500 for
1990.</p>
<p>But if oil prices rise, that figure will be tough to reach
-- it may have been out of reach anyway. Rising oil prices
thus make the stock market look even more dicey.</p>
<p>"Until recently, the market put a positive spin on every
piece of news," Ms. Cohen says. But it is hard to put a
positive spin on Saddam Hussein.</p>
<p>One area for which the invasion is bullish is defense. "It
does show that the world isn't quite the halcyon place that
some might have you believe," says Wolfgang H. Demisch, an
analyst with UBS Phillips & Drew. Just maybe, then, Congress
will think twice before cutting back spending on conventional
weapons.</p>
<p>And suppliers to the Middle East will probably find their
customers a bit more ready to do business. Raytheon is one
possible beneficiary; analysts say Raytheon is planning or is
in the process of selling its Patriot defense missile system
to Israel, Saudi Arabia and Italy. Raytheon's shares rose 2
3/4 yesterday to 60 3/4.</p>
<p>General Dynamics, which is selling tanks to Saudi Arabia,
also could benefit from stepped-up tensions in the Middle
East, but analysts say the overall impact on the company is
likely to be small. The stock closed at 28 1/4, up 1 1/2.</p>
<p>And as a result of the past year's lessening of tensions
in Europe, Congress and the U.S. public seem agreed that
defense spending should be cut back. Analysts doubt that the
invasion will be enough to deter Congress from that general
course.</p>
<p>"Under Carter and Reagan, we had nine years of 20% annual
growth in {defense} procurement," says Judith Comeau of
Goldman Sachs. The U.S., therefore, has "an inventory of
aircraft, ships and electronics" that could be deployed in a
regional crisis, she says.</p>
<p>"Playing" oil stocks is similarly chancy. Although oil and
oil-service, natural gas and other energy stocks rose
yesterday, that is old news as far as investors are
concerned.</p>
<p>Stephen A. Smith, oil analyst with Bear Stearns, sees a
"tendency" toward higher oil prices. But Mr. Smith, and just
about every other oil analyst, was caught off guard by Iraq's
strike. Its next step is apt to be no less surprising.</p>
<p>Plenty of stocks -- railroads, airlines and even companies
dependent on airline travel such as Walt Disney -- were
rocked yesterday.</p>
<p>However, Michael Sherman, chief strategist for Shearson
Lehman Hutton, cautioned against making rapid portfolio
changes such as dumping airline stocks.</p>
<p>One problem with that strategy, he says, is that airlines
are more dependent on the level of travel than just on the
price of oil.</p>
<p>And more fundamentally, investors who sell on such widely
known bad news end up selling when everyone else is selling
-- usually the worst time to do it.</p>
