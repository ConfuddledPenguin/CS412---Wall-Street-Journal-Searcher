	<p class="article-leader">LOS ANGELES -- Union Exploration Corp., the 95%-owned
production and exploration arm of Unocal Corp., reported a
45% plunge in second-quarter net income, largely because of
lower crude oil prices, unsuccessful drilling efforts and
higher well-repair costs.
   The company, formerly Union Exploration Partners Ltd.,
said net slid to $28.3 million, or 11 cents a partnership
unit, from $51.5 million, or 21 cents a unit, a year earlier.
Revenue fell 2.9% to $172.9 million from $178.0 million.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>As of 9 a.m. EDT yesterday, Union Exploration ceased to be
a limited partnership and was converted to corporate status,
now trading on the New York Stock Exchange and Pacific stock
exchanges under the symbol UXC.</p>
<p>Union Exploration was established in the wake of a 1985
takeover battle lead by Texas oilman T. Boone Pickens Jr.,
who sought to acquire Unocal. As part of its settlement with
Mr. Pickens, Unocal agreed to put many of its oil and gas
producing and exploration properties in the limited
partnership.</p>
<p>The company said adverse trends in the latest quarter were
partly offset by higher volumes of natural gas sales. Daily
natural gas sales rose 13% to 480.4 million cubic feet from
426.2 million cubic feet a year earlier. Crude oil sales
averaged 54,300 barrels a day, compared with 54,200 barrels a
year earlier.</p>
<p>Exploration and development outlays rose 31% to $76.1
million from $58.2 million a year earlier.</p>
<p>Net in the first half fell 38% to $98 million, or 39 cents
a partnership unit, from the year-earlier $157.6 million, or
64 cents a unit, which included $61.4 million in one-time
gains for natural gas contracts. Revenue declined 8.1% to
$377.7 million from $411 million.</p>
<p>Unocal on Monday reported a 38% surge in second-quarter
net income to $165 million, or 70 cents a share, as a result
of a $132 million one-time gain from the sale of the
company's Norwegian operations.</p>
