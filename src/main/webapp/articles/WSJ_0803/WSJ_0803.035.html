	<p class="article-leader">NATICK, Mass. -- Prime Computer Inc.'s share of an Army
computer contract is expected to amount to more than $100
million, the largest in the company's history, industry
sources say.
   The $700 million, multiyear contract was awarded Friday to
Electronic Data Systems Corp., a General Motors Corp. unit.
Spokesmen for both companies refused to disclose how much of
that contract would go to Prime.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The contract calls for EDS to provide up to 20,000
computers and systems for general office use by the Army,
Navy and defense logistics agency by 1995. A spokeswoman for
the Army's information systems procurement agency confirmed
that Prime's machines will be "the heart of the system." But
she wouldn't break out the company's potential share.</p>
<p>The subcontract appears to be a major win for Prime, which
has been struggling to cut costs and reverse huge losses it
suffered in the wake of a hostile takeover attempt. Prime was
taken private in 1989 by a unit of D.H. Whitney & Co., a New
York investment firm.</p>
