	<p class="article-leader">MANCHESTER, N.H. -- Northeast Utilities said it and the
committees representing investors and creditors of Public
Service Co. of New Hampshire agreed to extend to Sept. 30 the
target date for the first step of Northeast Utilities'
proposed $2.3 billion acquisition of PS New Hampshire.
   Northeast Utilities, based in Hartford, Conn., is
currently managing PS New Hampshire, which has been operating
under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code since 1988. Under
Chapter 11, a company can continue operating while protected
from creditors' claims.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Under the bankruptcy reorganization plan, PS New Hampshire
will replace its existing financial obligations with new debt
and preferred and common stock. Northeast Utilities had
expected to complete the refinancing by Aug. 1.</p>
<p>The reorganization plan, under which Northeast Utilities
will ultimately acquire PS New Hampshire has already been
approved by shareholders, creditors and the federal
bankruptcy court.</p>
<p>Northeast Utilities said the delay in the target date for
the refinancing was needed primarily to assess appeals that
may be filed as a result of the New Hampshire Public
Utilities Commission's approval last month of a rate plan
filed in connection with the reorganization.</p>
<p>Parties to the rate case have 20 days to ask that the
commission reconsider its decision and the commission has 10
days to respond. If the commission denies requests for
reconsideration, the parties have 30 days to appeal to the
state supreme court.</p>
<p>If the rate plan approval is appealed in court, Northeast
Utilities said a further delay of the reorganization could
occur.</p>
<p>Final federal regulatory approval of the acquisition of PS
New Hampshire is expected by late spring.</p>
