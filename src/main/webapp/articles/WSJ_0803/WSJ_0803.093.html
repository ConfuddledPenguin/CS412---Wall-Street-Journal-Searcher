	<p class="article-leader">LONDON -- Saddam Hussein may have grabbed control of
Kuwait's revenue source -- oil -- but not its huge financial
assets.
   Over the past 30 years, tiny Kuwait has poured its oil
wealth into an investment portfolio spread around the world.
Yesterday, the U.S., Britain and France froze Kuwaiti assets
in their respective countries to prevent their seizure by
Iraq. And Switzerland moved in that direction by ordering
Swiss banks to reject any withdrawals of Kuwaiti assets that
seem suspicious.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Much of Kuwait's global portfolio is controlled by the
London-based Kuwait Investment Office, renowned as much for
its secrecy as for its wealth. The investment office has
never disclosed finances, but analysts peg the value of its
assets at about $100 billion.</p>
<p>They range from major stakes in big German industrial
companies to Malaysian plantations to smaller positions in
U.S. concerns. In an uncharacteristically bold move, the
investment office rocked British political and business
circles in 1987 when it began amassing a stake of almost 22%
in British Petroleum Co., since cut to 9.8%. The Kuwaitis
also have been the most prominent foreign investors in Spain.</p>
<p>"They've been one of the largest single, identifiable
investors in world markets," says Richard O'Brien, chief
economist at American Express Bank in London. Aside from the
BP foray, he adds, the Kuwaitis generally have been passive,
long-term investors. "They're not just a short-term,
hot-money speculator."</p>
<p>Kuwait established the investment office in London in the
1950s, with a mission to invest oil profits for the benefit
of future generations when the oil runs out. The office grew
into a heavyweight in the 1970s, as then-booming oil prices
poured billions into its coffers. In recent years, investment
income has contributed more to national revenue than has oil.</p>
<p>The fund's growth was masterminded from nondescript
offices in the City, London's financial district. Nothing on
the outside of the Kuwait Investment Office's headquarters
building facing St. Paul's Cathedral indicates it is home for
anything other than a tuxedo-rental shop. The entrance to the
lavishly furnished offices above the shop is marked only with
the building's address.</p>
<p>Yesterday, a heavyset security guard stood in front of the
entrance, turning away visitors. He refused to say whether
anyone was inside. The curtains at every window in the
seven-story structure were drawn.</p>
<p>The office's most visible investment was the BP stake,
amassed in late 1987 and early 1988. The Kuwaitis snapped up
shares in Britain's biggest company after the U.K.
government's disastrous public offering of its 31.7% BP stake
in late 1987. Although the Kuwaiti office initially insisted
it was a long-term investor in BP, British officials fretted
that the oil-rich Arab country eventually might try to
control the U.K.'s main oil producer.</p>
<p>The row threatened the two nations' historically close
diplomatic and trading relations. Eventually, the British
government ordered a partial divestiture of the stake, a
decision the Kuwaiti spokesmen greeted with "extreme regret
and astonishment." Shortly afterward, in January 1989, BP
agreed to buy most of the stake back from the Kuwaitis for
#2.41 billion (valued at $4.37 billion at the time). The
Kuwaitis retain 9.8% of BP.</p>
<p>The BP imbroglio may well account for the Kuwaiti office's
recent management shake-up, its biggest in years. In
February, longtime London-based director Fouad Jaffar -- an
urbane, Western-educated Kuwaiti who had masterminded the
fund's growth -- was succeeded by Sheikh Fahd Mohammed
al-Sabah, a member of the royal family. Under Mr. Jaffar's
leadership, the investment office had become more aggressive,
moving in and out of stocks quickly.</p>
<p>In the U.S., the Kuwait Investment Office has tended to
hold its investments below disclosure thresholds. But reports
filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission indicate
that, as of February 1989, the investment office had a 5.8%
stake in Knogo Corp., a Hauppauge, N.Y., maker of security
devices. Santa Fe International Corp., a San Francisco-based
oil and gas concern, is a subsidiary of state-owned Kuwait
Petroleum Corp. Santa Fe officials said operations were
normal yesterday.</p>
<p>Among other assets in Britain, the Kuwaiti office owns
11.3% of travel and financial-services concern Hogg Robinson
PLC, 10.5% of Midland Bank PLC and 10% of hoteliers Mount
Charlotte Investments PLC. The office also owns St. Martins
Property Corp., builders of London Bridge City -- a huge
riverfront office complex across the Thames from the
capital's financial district.</p>
<p>Elsewhere in Europe, the Kuwaitis own major stakes in some
of West Germany's biggest companies. They own roughly 20% of
metals concern Metallgesellschaft AG, and just under 20% of
chemicals giant Hoechst AG. They also have about 14% of
Daimler-Benz AG. These German investments have been generally
passive.</p>
<p>The Kuwait Investment Office has moved more aggressively
in Spain, a hotbed of investment since its 1986 entry into
the European Community. In that year, the Kuwaitis took on
ailing paper concern Torras SA, since then building it into
one of Spain's largest industrial holding companies. The
Kuwaitis own 72% of Torras, with the remaining 28% held by
management and Javier de la Rosa, the company's vice
chairman.</p>
<p>Torras has direct and indirect interests in some 170
companies in the chemical, food, paper and financial services
sectors. Its chemical concern, Ercros S.A., is Spain's
largest. Torras also owns 24.9% of property concern Prima
S.A.</p>
<p>The Kuwaitis also have extensive holdings in southeast
Asia. Singapore's G.K. Goh Securities estimates the Kuwait
Investment Office's biggest investment in the Singapore and
Malaysian stock markets is Malaysian plantation, property and
manufacturing conglomerate Sime Darby Bhd. Sime says the
Kuwaiti office's holding is 5.4%.</p>
<p>Among other assets, analysts say the Kuwaiti office also
holds 49% of Singapore-based brokers J.M. Sassoon; 19% of
Singapore's Cycle & Carriage Ltd., an automobile-industry
concern; and one-third of Singapore's OUB Centre, the city's
tallest office block.</p>
<p>In Hong Kong, the Kuwaiti office owns about 37% of Dao
Heng Holdings Ltd., holding company for Dao Heng Bank. Dao
Heng Holdings is capitalized at US$312 million on Hong Kong's
stock exchange. Dao Heng Bank is among the six biggest of the
territory's 30 or so local banks. Kuwait also has about US$8
billion invested in Japan, according to the Japan-Kuwait
Friendship Society.</p>
<p>The Kuwaitis have kept a lower profile in North America.
In Canada, the Kuwait Investment Office has a stake in the
partnership led by Gordon Investment Corp. that plans to buy
Columbia Savings & Loan's $3-billion junk-bond portfolio.</p>

<p>THE KUWAIT INVESTMENT OFFICE sold its 5.8% stake in Knogo
Corp. in August 1989, according to Knogo officials. In
Friday's edition, it was reported that the Kuwaiti office
owned the stake as of February 1989, according to reports
filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. As a
passive investor, the Kuwaiti office is only required to file
notification of the sale to the SEC annually.</p>
