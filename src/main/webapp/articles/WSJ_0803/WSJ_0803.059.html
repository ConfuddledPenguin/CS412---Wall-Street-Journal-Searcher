	<p class="article-leader">DEARBORN, Mich. -- Ford Motor Co. officials hinted they
may be willing to offer the iron-clad job protection its
biggest union wants in return for concessions that help the
auto maker boost quality and productivity.
   United Auto Workers executives praised Ford's proposal,
outlined in general terms yesterday, as one setting a
positive framework for negotiations. The union has made job
security and pension benefits its top priorities in the
talks.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"The message we got across the table today is that {Ford
is} listening to us," said Ernest Lofton, the UAW vice
president in charge of the union's Ford negotiations.</p>
<p>Although still in the early stages, the UAW's contract
talks are going better at Ford than at General Motors Corp.
or Chrysler Corp. All three companies are negotiating
concurrently for new three-year pacts with the union. The
three contracts expire Sept. 14.</p>
<p>Talks are moving more smoothly at Ford principally because
the company's operations are leaner than its U.S. rivals.
That gives Ford more flexibility to make job security
promises.</p>
<p>"The people we're dealing with here at Ford are unlike
those at GM or Chrysler," Mr. Lofton said.</p>
<p>Ford has objectives of its own, chiefly quality
improvement. The auto maker also hinted that it will ask the
union to accept less in the way of pay and benefits
improvements in return for job security.</p>
<p>By signaling their willingness to negotiate strict job
security provisions, Ford officials are angling to become the
union's strike target. That would give Ford the chance to
negotiate an agreement that would set the pattern for
contracts at GM and Chrysler. In effect, Ford could set the
terms for labor relations at the rival U.S. companies.</p>
<p>Many in the auto industry still expect the UAW to choose
GM as its target and force a showdown over job security
there. The No. 1 auto maker has laid off more than 30,000 UAW
members in the past three years.</p>
<p>However, a UAW spokesman suggested Ford may have improved
its chances.</p>
<p>"If Ford meets all of our requirements and the other
companies are dragging their feet, then Ford will be the
target," a UAW spokesman said.</p>
