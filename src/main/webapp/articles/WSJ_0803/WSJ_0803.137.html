	<p class="article-leader">Lone Star Technologies Inc., Dallas, said its Lone Star
Steel Co. unit filed a plan of reorganization in U.S.
bankruptcy court in Dallas calling for the parent to retain
100% of the unit by contributing up to $36 million in new
financing.
   Under the plan, Lone Star Steel would pay off 61% of
creditors' allowed pre-bankruptcy nonpriority claims in cash,
using internally generated funds and the parent company's
contribution, Lone Star Technologies said. Lone Star Steel
lists $211.7 million in pre-petition liabilities.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Lone Star Technologies said the plan calls for the
unsecured creditors committee to dismiss a lawsuit it filed
on the unit's behalf seeking to recover $109.3 million from
the parent.</p>
<p>Lone Star Technologies said that, if creditors reject the
plan, the unit will proceed with an alternative plan to
provide creditors with full recovery of their claims in cash
and securities of the unit. Under the alternative plan,
creditors would receive $70 million in cash, $50 million face
amount of subordinated notes, $30 million in liquidation
preference of preferred stock and 46% of the unit's common.</p>
