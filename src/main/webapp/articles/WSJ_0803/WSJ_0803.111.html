	<p class="article-leader">Great Country Bank said it had a $2.3 million loss in its
fourth quarter, ended May 31, after increasing its loan-loss
reserves.
   The Ansonia, Conn., savings bank said it added $3.3
million to reserves, boosting fiscal year provisions for loan
losses to $15.1 million. For the year, the bank reported a
loss of $9 million.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Great Country said the added reserves reflect its
expectations of problem loans related to a weakened
Connecticut real estate market. Property values have been
dropping, leaving many banks with difficult-to-sell real
estate after foreclosing on delinquent mortgages.</p>
<p>In the 1989 fiscal fourth quarter, Great Country had net
income of $677,000, or 31 cents a share. For all of fiscal
1989, it had net of $3.2 million, or $1.45 a share.</p>
