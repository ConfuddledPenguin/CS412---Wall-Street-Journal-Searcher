	<p class="article-leader">Allied-Signal Inc., Morris Township, N.J., said it will
build a $160 million polyester-fiber plant in Longwy, France,
to serve passenger car tire, seat belt and other markets.
   The plant is expected to begin operating in early 1993 and
employ about 300.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Allied-Signal, an aerospace, automotive-products and
engineered-materials company, currently makes
high-performance polyester in North Carolina; its industrial
polyester sales total about $150 million a year, including
European exports.</p>
<p>The company said the new plant will serve European
customers as well as take advantage of new markets in Eastern
Europe. Although the European tire market currently uses
rayon, nylon and polyester reinforcement, the company said it
believes European tiremakers will "follow the lead of U.S.
and Far East manufacturers who have switched to the use of
all polyester for tire reinforcement."</p>
