	<p class="article-leader">Federal regulators took control of National Bank of
Washington following the bankruptcy-law filing of its parent,
Washington Bancorp.
   The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency said it
placed the bank into conservatorship and appointed William S.
Ogden conservator. Mr. Ogden, formerly vice chairman of Chase
Manhattan Bank, served as chief executive of Continental
Illinois National Bank & Trust Co. after the government took
control of it in 1984.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The regulators said a conservator was appointed to
safeguard the bank's assets of about $1.6 billion and to
provide for an orderly sale of the bank.</p>
<p>Washington Bancorp. filed Wednesday for court protection
from creditors under Chapter 11 of the federal Bankruptcy
Code. The company isn't related to Washington Bancorp Inc.,
based in Hoboken, N.J.</p>
