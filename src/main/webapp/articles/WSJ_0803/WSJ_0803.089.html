	<p class="article-leader">PARIS -- Usinor Sacilor S.A.'s aggressive foreign
expansion strategy is provoking criticism from abroad that
the steel group's state-owned status has given it an unfair
advantage over private companies.
   The French group has spun itself a web of cross-border
alliances in recent years through a series of takeovers and
partnerships that have made it the world's second-largest
steel producer after Japan's Nippon Steel Corp.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Usinor's latest move came last week when it announced
plans for a friendly takeover of New York-based Edgcomb
Corp., one of the biggest steel-trading concerns in the U.S.,
for an undisclosed amount.</p>
<p>Edgcomb is the latest in a string of acquisitions by
Usinor in the U.S., where it is now the biggest producer of
stainless steel and has reached a critical mass in long steel
products.</p>
<p>With a solid U.S. trading and distribution network now
under its belt, analysts say, Usinor is now poised to carve
itself a niche in flat products, the steel industry's
mainstay.</p>
<p>LTV Corp., another large U.S. steelmaker, disclosed a few
months ago that Usinor Sacilor had indicated it was
interested in discussing the acquisition of a minority
interest in LTV's steel unit, which produced 8.4 million tons
of raw steel and had revenue of $4.1 billion in 1989.
Officials at the French group say the talks remain at a very
preliminary stage, however.</p>
<p>But Francis Mer, chairman of the steel group, rejects
suggestions that Usinor has delusions of grandeur and says
Usinor isn't expanding for the sake of size alone. "If one
day we become the world's biggest steel producer it won't be
because we set out to do so," he said in an interview.</p>
<p>Mr. Mer doesn't believe that Usinor will ever catch up
with its Japanese competitor. Although Nippon Steel claims to
have production capacity of 28 million tons, compared with
Usinor's 23 million tons, the figure is nearer to 40 million
tons if all Nippon's affiliated companies are included.</p>
<p>Usinor Sacilor's biggest foreign takeover to date was its
acquisition last year of a controlling stake in West
Germany's Saarstahl in a move that made the French group the
second-biggest German producer after Thyssen AG.</p>
<p>Usinor's expansion plans got a boost this week, when the
European Community Commission cleared the way for Usinor and
British Steel PLC of the U.K. to expand further into
specialist markets. Usinor's Sollac unit will be allowed to
purchase two units from their parent company, Anglo-French
packaging specialist CMB S.A.</p>
<p>"Usinor reflects the imperialistic style that appears to
be in vogue in France at the present time," commented Peter
Dupont, a steel-industry analyst with UBS-Philips & Drew Ltd.
of London, referring to the wave of foreign takeovers by
French state-controlled industrial concerns in recent months.</p>
<p>Usinor's chief executive says he would prefer to be in a
position to issue common shares rather than nonvoting
securities, as many nationalized companies have done in
recent years.</p>
<p>Analysts say it's significant that during the difficult
years, Usinor Sacilor was able to maintain its expenditure on
improving productivity when private-owned concerns couldn't.</p>
<p>"Part of the reason may be that with the state's backing,
Usinor could take out loans on more-favorable terms than its
competitors. This raises the question of whether or not the
playing field was level," comments Mr. Dupont of Philips &
Drew.</p>
<p>Vincent Mordrel, an analyst with Parisian brokerage DLP
James Capel, points out that unlike steel companies in the
U.S., Usinor didn't have to worry about shareholder reaction
to quarterly earnings reports.</p>
<p>Usinor Sacilor returned to profitability in 1988 after 12
straight years of losses, but Mr. Mer says it's unlikely that
the 1990 earnings performance will match that of 1989, when
consolidated net profit after payments to minority interests
climbed to 7.592 billion francs ($1.41 billion) from 4.633
billion a year earlier.</p>
<p>He explained that steel demand was boosted artificially
last year by stockbuilding linked to the inability of
producers to meet rapidly rising demand. Right now there's a
stock depletion trend that has pushed production levels below
those of actual consumption, but this phenomenon is
temporary, and production should start moving in line with
demand next year.</p>
<p>Mr. Mer says steel demand in Europe is projected to rise
by between 2% and 3% annually in volume terms over the next
four or five years, provided that interest rates don't rise
significantly.</p>
