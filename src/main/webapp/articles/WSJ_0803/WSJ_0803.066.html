	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Bear Stearns Cos. posted a 30% drop in net
income for its fiscal fourth quarter, capping a mixed
earnings season for Wall Street securities firms.
   The big securities firm, citing the cyclical downturn on
Wall Street, said net for the quarter ended June 30 was $33.5
million, or 32 cents a share, compared with $47.6 million, or
43 cents a share, a year earlier. Revenue edged up to $640
million from $629.7 million. Many analysts had expected the
firm to earn between 40 cents and 43 cents for the quarter.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Despite the results, however, Bear Stearns remains one of
the few securities darlings among financial-services
analysts.</p>
<p>"I'm not table-pounding any of these stocks, but Bear is
the only one I have a buy on," says Larry Eckenfelder, an
analyst with Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. "It still has
good value and not a lot more downside."</p>
<p>Yesterday, Bear Stearns shares closed at $12, down 62.5
cents, in composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange.</p>
<p>Bear Stearns's results bring to a close an uneven period
for securities-firm earnings. For the first time in nine
months, securities firms as a group broke into the black in
the June quarter. But the results were mixed: Merrill Lynch &
Co. surprised analysts with a jump in investment-banking
revenue, while Morgan Stanley Group Inc.'s shares have
dropped 18% since its disappointing earnings were released
last week.</p>
<p>Bear Stearns's per-share results are adjusted for a 5%
stock dividend declared yesterday, to be distributed with the
regular quarterly cash dividend of 14 cents on Aug. 31.</p>
<p>Commissions were a little softer than some analysts were
expecting; apparently an anticipated investment-banking deal
didn't close before the quarter ended, some analysts said.
Commission revenue for the quarter was down 22% to $77.9
million.</p>
<p>Investment banking revenue rose 4.3%. An increase in
interest and dividend income was offset by an increase in
interest expense.</p>
<p>For the year, Bear Stearns's net income fell 31% to $119.4
million, or $1.10 a share, down from $172.4 million, or $1.54
a share. Revenue was flat at $2.4 billion. Commission revenue
was down 2% but investment banking revenue dropped 17%.</p>
<p>Strong performances in the areas of mortgage-backed
securities, government bond and stock trading helped the
fourth quarter, Bear Stearns said.</p>
<p>In a statement, Chairman Alan C. Greenberg said "fiscal
1990, particularly the first six months, was a tough year for
the investment banking and brokerage industry." In light of
that, he said, "we are proud of our results for the quarter
and the year."</p>
<p>Indeed, Mr. Greenberg showed good spirit and a touch of
humor about the results. "I have always heard that we are in
a cyclical business. I am eagerly awaiting the next upward
cycle," he said in the statement.</p>
