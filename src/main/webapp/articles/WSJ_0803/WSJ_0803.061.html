	<p class="article-leader">ATLANTA -- Coca-Cola Enterprises Inc. said it filed a
shelf registration with the Securities and Exchange
Commission to offer up to $1 billion in debt securities and
warrants.
   The big Coke bottler, 49%-owned by Coca-Cola Co., said it
planned to offer senior debt securities and warrants to buy
debt securities, among other issues. The offerings, it said,
would be made "from time to time."</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>In November, Coca-Cola Enterprises had made a similar $1
billion shelf registration. A spokesman said that there have
been several note issues since then, including a $250 million
offering in March, and that most of the previous shelf filing
authorization has been exhausted.</p>
