	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- The Senate approved a $20.8 billion energy
and water bill incorporating major increases in funding for
the cleanup of nuclear weapons plants and providing $318
million toward the Energy Department's massive
superconducting supercollider.
   Defense waste management and environmental funding would
grow by almost two-thirds to $2.68 billion in fiscal 1991,
and an additional $513.7 million is allocated for the cleanup
of civilian facilities. Though more modest, the money for the
ambitious supercollider atom smasher further commits the
government to the ever-costlier project, which is now priced
at $8.6 billion, according to the most recent estimates by
Energy Department officials.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Adopted by a simple voice vote, the underlying measure is
the first of the fiscal 1991 appropriations bills to clear
the Senate, and its swift passage testifies to the continued
power of the chamber's Western and Southern interests, which
have a major stake in the science and water projects funded
in the bill. Appropriations Committee Chairman Robert Byrd
(D., W.Va.) hastened the debate along from his vantage point
as the presiding officer in the Senate, and Republicans
offered little resistance despite the Bush administration's
reservations about the total spending.</p>
<p>In the most striking case, only a single Republican, Sen.
William Roth of Delaware, opposed a $1 million amendment
ordering the Interior Department to pay what amounts to a tax
credit on a hydroelectric project in southeast Idaho. Delayed
by environmental reviews, the power project failed to qualify
in time for energy tax credits that expired in late 1988. And
the thrust of the amendment, adopted 76-23, was to make the
project whole by forcing a compensating payment now from the
Treasury.</p>
<p>Western environmentalists and sportsmen opposed to the
project lobbied against the provision, which critics argue
would most directly benefit Salt Lake City-based Bonneville
Pacific Corp., which would develop the project for a rural
electric cooperative. The administration opposed similar
legislation passed by the House in a separate bill. And Sen.
Bill Bradley (D., N.J.), a member of the Senate Finance
Committee and chairman of the water and power subcommittee of
the Senate Energy Committee, warned that the chamber was
setting an extraordinary tax precedent by using the
appropriations process in this manner.</p>
<p>Total spending in the bill represents an estimated $580.2
million increase above the administration's request, and at a
time when Senate Appropriations subcommittees are being asked
to cut back, the energy and water measure has enjoyed a
charmed life. Sen. Pete Domenici, the ranking Republican on
the Senate Budget Committee, used his position to help ensure
the allocation would be as generous as the one approved by
the House. Within these limits, the New Mexico senator
protected tens of millions of dollars for the Los Alamos
national laboratory in his home state.</p>
<p>Among the university projects funded in the bill is $4
million for Fort Hays State University near the home town of
Senate Minority Leader Robert Dole. In recent months, the
Kansas Republican has shown a new appetite for steering money
back home. Mr. Dole recalled Mr. Byrd once telling him: "You
never ask for anything around this place." Now the senator is
asking -- and getting. Pittsburg State University in Kansas
would receive $6 million under a Treasury and Postal Service
bill approved this week by Mr. Byrd's panel, and Mr. Dole
secured at least $4.3 million for a Kansas highway project in
a separate transportation bill.</p>
