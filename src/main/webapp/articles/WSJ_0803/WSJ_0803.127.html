	<p class="article-leader">Continental Airlines Holdings Inc., Houston, recorded its
first profitable quarter since late 1986, but it would have
posted another loss without special gains totaling $123.2
million at its Continental unit.
   In addition, the parent, which recently changed its name
from Texas Air Corp., lost control of its Eastern Airlines
unit early in the second quarter and no longer has to report
that troubled carrier's losses.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>For the quarter, Continental Airlines Holdings had net
income of $98.3 million, or $2.21 a share, on revenue of
$1.51 billion. In the year-ago quarter, it reported a net
loss of $109.3 million, or a loss of $2.88 a share on revenue
of $1.4 billion.</p>
<p>The company said it was excluding the results of Eastern
Airlines from April 19 on, when a bankruptcy judge appointed
a trustee to take control of the unit. As a result of an
accounting change, then, the Continental Holdings'
second-quarter results include only 18 days of Eastern
results, in which the financially ailing carrier had a loss
of $12.6 million on revenue of $115.9 million.</p>
<p>For the six months, the parent company reported a net loss
of $8.8 million, or 51 cents a share, on revenue of $3.37
billion, compared with a net loss of $364.9 million on
revenue of $3.28 billion.</p>
