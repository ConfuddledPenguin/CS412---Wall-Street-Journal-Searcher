	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- June factory orders declined a sharp 1.5%,
providing fresh evidence that the health of the U.S.'s
manufacturing sector is deteriorating.
   The Commerce Department reported that orders fell to
$237.4 billion in June after increasing a revised 2.2% in May
to $241.1 billion.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Taken with other recent economic news, the orders data
suggest that "there are renewed signs of weakness in
manufacturing following some signs of firming" earlier in the
year, said Norman Robertson, chief economist for Mellon Bank
in Pittsburgh.</p>
<p>"The outlook for manufacturing employment is certainly
bleak," he said. "The prospect for output is for lackluster
gains at best over coming months." Mr. Robertson said he
believes that the economy will squeak by without a recession
but said it will be close.</p>
<p>Yesterday's report was consistent with three issued
Wednesday that detailed an uninspired performance by the
economy. The government's index of leading indicators was
unchanged for June, while construction spending was flat for
the same month, according to the Commerce Department. In
addition, the National Association of Purchasing Management's
July index of manufacturing health plunged.</p>
<p>The decline in June factory orders was concentrated in
durable goods, which are items expected to last at least
three years. Orders for these goods skidded 2.8% to $125.08
billion after rising 4.1% in May to $128.74 billion. The June
drop reflected decreases in orders for defense capital goods,
primary metals, electrical machinery and related products.</p>
<p>The 2.8% drop in durable-goods orders was smaller than the
3.2% decline estimated by the department last week. Orders
for nondurable goods were about unchanged in June from May at
$112.32 billion.</p>
<p>Brian Keyser, an economist at First Fidelity Bancorp. in
Philadelphia, said the data confirm his view that the economy
will grow at an anemic pace in the next few months. "We'll be
in the same weak environment we've been in for the last year
or year and a half," he said, adding that commercial and
residential construction will continue to be a drag on the
economy.</p>
<p>The figures are adjusted for seasonal variations.</p>
