	<p class="article-leader">LONDON -- In a new effort to counter Japanese competition,
the European Community is in talks with Washington to expand
trans-Atlantic cooperation in electronics research.
   The talks, begun quietly in Washington and Brussels last
month, explore ways to coordinate existing U.S. and EC
research programs on semiconductors, computers and other
aspects of "information technology," according to EC Science
Commissioner Filippo Maria Pandolfi. If successful, the talks
may expand opportunities for each region's corporate and
academic researchers to collaborate in the other's government
electronics programs.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The talks are the latest EC response to the growing
success of Japanese electronics companies in Europe, and the
declining health of Europe's own computer and semiconductor
industries. In recent months, nearly all of Europe's major
computer makers have reported tumbling profits or losses.
Japanese manufacturers, meanwhile, have posted rapid gains --
highlighted by an agreement Monday by Fujitsu Ltd. to buy
control of Britain's biggest computer maker, the
International Computers Ltd. unit of STC PLC.</p>
<p>The research-program talks are "a major effort to
establish a new background of cooperation with the U.S.," Mr.
Pandolfi said in an interview. "I have nothing against the
Japanese, but I have {begun} this preliminary activity to
support our international competitiveness." He said
cooperation with the U.S. would help European industry by
strengthening EC research programs, slated to total 5.7
billion European Currency Units ($7.4 billion) through 1994.</p>
<p>In Washington, however, officials were eager to play down
any characterization of the talks as anti-Japanese. From the
U.S. perspective, "there isn't any strategic motive for this,
other than seeing what might be useful" in making U.S.
research programs more effective, said Charles Brownstein, an
acting assistant director at the National Science Foundation.
He added that the Bush Administration won't decide whether to
go ahead with the EC research cooperation until a study on
the subject is completed this month.</p>
<p>The possibility of EC-U.S. collaboration is a new twist in
global technology trade. For most of the 1980s, the two
regions competed bitterly against each other in high-tech
research programs, jealously excluding each other's
researchers from projects. But in Europe, the Japanese are
beginning to supplant the Americans as the biggest source of
high-tech trade worries. The EC's deficit in electronics
trade with Japan has surged rapidly, leading the EC into a
series of anti-dumping investigations against Japanese makers
of photocopiers, computer peripherals and other products.</p>
<p>The eight days of U.S.-EC discussions last month, in
Washington and Brussels, involved about 75 scientists and
bureaucrats involved in U.S. and EC research programs.</p>
<p>Besides Mr. Brownstein of the National Science Foundation,
which spends about $200 million a year on
information-technology programs, U.S. representatives at the
talks included President Bush's science adviser and an
official of the Pentagon's Defense Advanced Research Projects
Agency, or Darpa. Darpa subsidizes the Sematech program, a
collaborative effort by U.S. semiconductor makers to bolster
their technology in the face of Japanese competition. Mr.
Pandolfi said he hopes the U.S. and EC will agree soon to
continue such talks, by establishing a permanent task force
on research collaboration.</p>
<p>One specific issue under consideration is whether to
increase ties between Sematech and Europe's semiconductor
project, called Jessi. Jessi, which gets EC and national
government subsidies of about 500 million marks ($314.7
million) a year, began two years ago as Europe's response to
Sematech.</p>
<p>But in a further sign of changing attitudes here to the
U.S. and Japan, last January the Jessi board decided to let
the European operations of U.S.-based International Business
Machines Corp. participate in some Jessi research. IBM's
semiconductor operations are among the largest in Europe and
were welcomed for the technology they could contribute to
Jessi. Likewise, Sematech has begun considering the admission
of some U.S. units of such European chip makers as N.V.
Philips of the Netherlands. A further meeting on
Jessi-Sematech collaboration is scheduled for next month at
the Sematech program's headquarters in Austin, Texas.</p>
