	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- The U.S. emergency oil stockpile already is
big enough to counter any temporary supply disruption from
the Mideast conflict, and Iraq's invasion increases the
chances that it will get significantly bigger.
   The "strategic petroleum reserve," placed in salt domes in
Texas and Louisiana, now contains almost 590 million barrels
of crude that the government began stockpiling in response to
the Arab oil embargo of 1973-1974. That's enough to offset
all imports for 75 days at current import levels. Plans call
for the reserve to reach 750 million barrels by the
mid-1990s.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>House and Senate conferees have been debating a proposal
to increase the flow of oil into the reserve to bring it to
one billion barrels, and the Mideast war gives the provision
a boost. Until now, the Bush administration had opposed the
higher level partly on the grounds that the likelihood of a
supply disruption was minimal. At a news conference late
yesterday afternoon, Deputy Energy Secretary Henson Moore
said the government "has seen nothing to cause us to rethink
that decision." But many people on Capitol Hill expect the
higher level to be approved.</p>
<p>Mr. Moore told reporters that he expects neither the
invasion nor the U.S. embargo of Iraqi oil to result in a
"long-term, significant increase" in oil prices or a
disruption in supplies to the U.S. Thus, he said, the Bush
administration has no plans to tap the reserve. He cited the
current oversupply of oil on world markets and high levels of
domestic commercial stocks of crude oil and refined products.</p>
<p>The invasion of Kuwait sparked a debate on whether to use
the reserve to ease the supply disruption that would ensue if
the U.S. and several of its allies tried to impose a world
quarantine on Iraqi oil. Philip K. Verleger, a visiting
fellow at the Institute for International Economics, called
for using the reserve oil to help ease the impact of sharply
higher prices that would occur if such an embargo worked.
With an effective embargo, he predicted, prices could reach
$45 a barrel.</p>
<p>But Mr. Moore said no thought has been given to using the
oil in that way. The reserve "isn't designed as a pricing
mechanism," he said.</p>
<p>Currently all the oil in the reserve is owned by the U.S.
But under pending legislation required to authorize the
continued build-up of the strategic reserve, the U.S. would
be allowed to begin leasing some of the crude as a way to
reduce the cost of filling the reserve. Under this plan, an
oil supplier would lease the oil to the U.S. for a fee that
proponents say could be as low as 50 cents to $1 a barrel.
Saudi Arabia and Venezuela have expressed interest in such an
arrangement, according to congressional aides.</p>
<p>Under the leasing plan, the U.S. in case of an emergency
would take possession of the oil and be free to use it. When
and if any was sold, the supplying nation would get the
proceeds.</p>
<p>The president can decide to draw down oil from the reserve
after determining there is a serious disruption to the flow
of imported oil or the potential for such an interruption.
The Bush administration also would determine the rate at
which the oil could be used, based on an estimate of how long
the disruption is likely to last.</p>
<p>The 75-day supply of imported oil that the reserve could
offset compares with more than 100 days in the early 1980s.
The number of days has declined even as the reserve has grown
because U.S. consumption of foreign oil has shot up in recent
years.</p>
