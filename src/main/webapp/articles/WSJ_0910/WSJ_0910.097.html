	<p class="article-leader">DALLAS -- Tandy Corp., bristling at Texas Instruments
Inc.'s increasingly aggressive patent protection campaign,
accused its north Texas neighbor of fraudulently claiming
certain microprocessor technologies as its own.
   In a complaint filed in U.S. District Court for the
Northern District of California, Tandy, a Fort Worth
electronics maker and retailer, also charged that Texas
Instruments, a semiconductor maker and defense concern,
violated federal antitrust laws, by demanding "unreasonably
high" royalty payments and by requiring Tandy to buy licenses
it didn't need in order to obtain other crucial Texas
Instruments technologies.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>It isn't at all certain that Tandy's claims will prevail
in court, but several industry observers said the lawsuit
could blunt Texas Instruments' strategy of using legal
threats to squeeze new revenue out of technology it has
pioneered over the years.</p>
<p>"This lawsuit is just another example (resulting from)
TI's legal department trying to outmarket the marketing
department," said Bruce Entin, a spokesman for LSI Logic
Corp., a Milpitas, Calif., semiconductor maker, which has
been accused by Texas Instruments of infringing patents on a
basic chip-making process. "TI seems to have made a practice
of using its patent portfolio as a way to produce profits,
rather than as a way to protect intellectual property," he
added. LSI denies any wrongdoing.</p>
<p>A spokesman for Texas Instruments declined to comment on
the Tandy lawsuit, saying officials hadn't had a chance to
review it.</p>
<p>Vigorous enforcement of decades-old patents has paid off
for Texas Instruments so far. Analysts estimate that it
collects about $100 million a year in royalties from Japanese
and South Korean companies for a basic memory-chip
technology. And last December, Texas Instruments was granted
a patent in Japan for the basic integrated-circuit
technology, a patent that analysts say could bring the
company $150 million to $650 million a year.</p>
<p>But Texas Instruments has also made some enemies,
particularly when it started putting the squeeze on U.S.
companies. Tandy, which owns the nationwide chain of Radio
Shack stores, said its dispute began last year, when Texas
Instruments notified Tandy that its Grid Systems Corp.
subsidiary was infringing several patents in making certain
laptop computers. The suit was filed in California in part
because Grid is based there.</p>
<p>The claims covered several functions of microprocessors,
the ubiquitous chips that serve as the brains of tens of
millions of computers around the world.</p>
<p>Tandy said it agreed to a licensing arrangement at
inflated prices and involving certain technologies it didn't
even need because of Texas Instruments' dominance of the
market. "Because of the number, importance and uniqueness of
the patents it owns or controls, TI has the ability to
control prices and/or exclude competition in the license
market in the U.S.," the lawsuit claims.</p>
<p>In a somewhat unusual twist, Tandy also claims that Texas
Instruments fraudulently obtained a key microprocessor patent
in 1973, but that the chip was invented years earlier by Ted
Hoff of Intel Corp. The suit charges that Texas Instruments
"concealed" this information from the U.S. Patent Office, and
that the patent is thus "invalid and unenforceable."</p>
<p>Roger Borovoy, a former Intel general counsel, said it
could be true that Mr. Hoff, a legendary figure in the
computer industry, invented the microprocessor. But he said
that Texas Instruments beat Intel in filing a patent, and
that it would be difficult now to overturn this patent. He
said Tandy would have to prove that Mr. Hoff not only
invented the device, but that he didn't stop working on it.
"I'm not saying it isn't possible to do, but it's a very
tough burden of proof," he said.</p>
<p>The dispute was further clouded by the U.S. Patent
Office's decision a few weeks ago to grant a far-reaching
microprocessor patent to Gilbert P. Hyatt, a previously
obscure inventor living in La Palma, Calif.</p>
<p>"The question of ownership is so complex it makes rich men
out of patent lawyers," said Richard Shaffer, editor of
Technologic Computer Letter, a trade publication.</p>
