	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- If you listened to many technical analysts,
you got out of stocks before Iraq invaded Kuwait and
sidestepped an avalanche of falling stock prices. What are
these technicians saying now?
   Stay out -- at least for a while. Then get back in, but
only for a short-run rally. The market's long-term trend is
down, they say.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>A lot of people pooh-pooh technical stock market analysis
as nothing more than statistical tea-leaf reading --
especially when the market is moving logically in line with
economic trends. But as the economic landscape is obscured by
the fog of other factors -- the threat of a Mideast war, for
example -- and the market zigzags, investors increasingly
seek out the technical gurus.</p>
<p>"The more people are confused, the more they look to the
technical types for help," says Joseph Feshbach, technical
analyst at Shearson Lehman Brothers.</p>
<p>Technicians basically peer under the hood at the market's
inner workings to discern what will happen next; they place a
lot of weight on stock price trends, with trading volume a
close second. Fundamental analysts, by contrast, diagnose the
health of the economy, an industry and individual companies,
concentrating on such things as earnings growth, product
lines and dividends.</p>
<p>"If you stuck to the technicals coming into August," says
Timothy Clark, associate director of research at Avatar
Associates, "you would have been in pretty good shape."</p>
<p>For the first half of the year, many bullish investors
ignored the yawning gap between the briskly advancing Dow
Jones Industrial Average and the lagging broader market
indexes. They looked the other way as New York Stock Exchange
trading volume dwindled while the industrial average rose.</p>
<p>"The market can't keep rising when you have those kinds of
divergences, but you never know when it will end," Mr. Clark
says. Though technical analysts were warning investors away
from stocks even before the Dow set new records in July,
"sometimes what's needed is a catalyst" to bring about the
sometimes-abrupt adjustment. Before the 1987 crash it was
rising interest rates. This summer, it was Saddam Hussein.</p>
<p>Nowadays, many technical analysts are looking at their
repertoire of stock-market statistics from a new perspective:
For the first time since 1982, they are interpreting the data
in the context of a bear market rather than a bull market.
For example:</p>
<p>PUT-CALL RATIO: Many analysts follow the ratio of volume
in put options (a bet that stock prices are headed lower) to
the volume in call options (a bet that prices will rise). In
a bull market, heavy volume in puts during an intermediate
decline in the market suggests stock prices will soon resume
climbing, they say. That's because puts are popular with
high-risk speculators who bet against the odds. But in a bear
market, heavy put volume can be generated by conservative
investors who are recognizing a trend.</p>
<p>Put-option volume soared in mid-August when the industrial
average was at 2760, encouraging some investors with
bull-market views to get back into stocks. But put volume
continued to climb and the Dow sank to 2483 on Aug. 23. Some
once-bullish investors were badly burned.</p>
<p>One reason for their misjudgment is that they, like the
vast majority of portfolio managers, "weren't running money
10 years ago," says Kenneth Spence, technical analyst at
Salomon Brothers. "Most of these people have looked at these
sentiment indicators only in a bull trend." But they mean
different things in a bear market, which is what Mr. Spence
believes we are in now.</p>
<p>TRADING VOLUME: The Dow hit its recent low below 2500 on
heavy volume, which is another troublesome signal for
technical analysts.</p>
<p>"We need to see power" when the market rises to feel good
about any interim rallies, says Richard Arms, a technical
analyst with Eppler, Guerin & Turner in Albuquerque, N.M.
"Right now we're still not seeing the money pouring in on the
upside, but we are seeing it pour out on the down side."</p>
<p>ADVANCERS VS. DECLINERS: Another much-watched technical
indicator is the 10-day average of the short-term trading
index, which was developed by Mr. Arms. This is a ratio of
volume in advancing and declining issues against the ratio of
the number of rising stocks to falling ones. An index of 1.0
or higher indicates selling pressure is greater than buying
interest. Under 1.0, the index is considered bullish.</p>
<p>Like the put-call percentage, the Arms trading index
expresses a form of investor sentiment that varies depending
on the market's overall trend. In a bull market, the index
climbing to 1.25 during a decline in stock prices signals
that bargain-hunters are about to swoop in and push the
market higher. But in a bear market, a similar index reading
can mean further declines are in prospect before a rebound
materializes.</p>
<p>But how much deeper the market might fall, and then how
much it might bounce back, is a matter of individual
judgment. Mr. Arms says the index currently suggests the Dow
might fall back to about 2500 in a matter of days, which
could present a good buying opportunity. The subsequent rise,
other analysts say, probably would be limited to about the
2700 level, 300 points shy of the July record.</p>
<p>Timing is another issue. Mr. Spence of Salomon Brothers
agrees with Mr. Arms that the Dow will revisit the 2500
level, but he predicts it will take two to three weeks. He
thinks this decline will occur on shrinking volume and that
declining issues won't overwhelm advancers, as they did on
Aug. 23. "That would indicate a dissipation of selling
pressure in the market," he says.</p>
<p>Then would follow an advance lasting six to eight weeks,
Mr. Spence says, with the Dow stopping at 2700. "What you get
essentially is a rally in a downtrend," he says.</p>
<p>Mr. Feshbach of Shearson thinks the Dow will be confined
in a range of 2475 to 2725. "The best thing to do now is what
the charts are telling us to do: It's tough for the growth
stocks. The interest rate-sensitive stocks are dead. So you
should be long on some gold stocks, energy, and commodities
stocks such as Freeport-McMoRan and Burlington Resources, and
short the retail and technology stocks."</p>
<p>Not everyone is so pessimistic. Donald Fishback, research
director of Investment Institute Research in Cincinnati, for
example, is looking for a range of 2500 to 3000 for the rest
of this year. While he concedes interpreting sentiment
indicators is risky business, he is convinced that
bearishness is overdone and the market has nowhere to go but
up.</p>
<p>"You don't want to step in front of a freight train, which
we did in August by turning bullish too early," he says, "but
when the (short-term trading index) starts to head down, then
it's a good time to step in and buy stocks."</p>
<p>But maybe the real lesson in all this isn't so, well,
technical. "If investors are starting to respect the
technicians," says William Raftery, technical analyst at
Smith Barney, Harris Upham, "you know we're darn close to a
bottom."</p>

<p>Friday's Market Activity</p>
<p>The stock market moved higher in quiet trading, supported
by falling oil prices and optimism about President Bush's
apparent resolve to reduce the federal deficit.</p>
<p>Shares of so-called "defensive growth" companies -- those
expected to deliver strong earnings gains even if the economy
slips into a recession or war breaks out in the Middle East
-- set the pace for the advance.</p>
<p>The Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 23.26 to 2619.55.
In the energy markets, crude oil for October delivery tumbled
$1.39 a barrel, to $30.04.</p>
<p>President Bush's expression of confidence that
congressional budget negotiators would be able to complete a
deficit-reduction agreement at their summit meeting over the
weekend, along with his reaffirmation of a $50 billion target
for fiscal 1991 deficit cuts, spurred buying interest,
traders said.</p>
<p>Just 123,800,000 shares traded on the New York Stock
Exchange. Advancing issues topped decliners by 922 to 560.</p>
<p>The Big Board's composite index added 1.45 to 177.51;
Standard & Poor's 500-stock index gained 2.94 to 323.40, and
the Dow Jones Equity Market index rose 2.71 to 299.63.</p>
<p>For the week, the Dow industrials rose 5.19 points, or
0.2%.</p>
<p>Among blue-chip issues falling into the "defensive growth"
category, PepsiCo gained 3/4 to 25 1/4 in Big Board composite
trading of 1.4 million shares, Philip Morris climbed 1/2 to
45 1/4 on 1.2 million shares, McDonald's rallied 1 1/8 to 27
7/8 on 1.2 million shares, Coca-Cola Co. rose 1 to 42 1/8,
Procter & Gamble rose 1 1/2 to 78, Merck gained 1 1/4 to 81
1/8 and Pfizer added 1 3/4 to 71 1/8.</p>
<p>UAL, parent of United Airlines, climbed 8 to 100 1/4 as a
report from Prudential-Bache Securities revived hopes that a
union-led group will be able to complete its long-delayed
buy-out of the company. Analyst Paul Nisbet wrote that the
group's $201-a-share buy-out proposal or one "constructed
more conservatively" -- possibly around $180 a share --
should be completed by October, barring an outbreak of a
Middle East war, according to Dow Jones Professional Investor
Report.</p>
<p>Speculation that investor Marvin Davis may again be
interested in UAL following the sale of Pebble Beach Co.,
which had been owned by a real estate partnership he
controls, may have spurred the stock's sharp gains as well,
Mr. Nisbet said. A spokeswoman for Mr. Davis, who offered to
buy UAL last year, declined to comment.</p>
<p>Compaq Computer dropped 7/8 to 44 5/8 on 1.3 million
shares. This newspaper's Heard on the Street column Friday
noted, among other things, that some of the company's
notebook-sized laptop computers have been developing hairline
cracks after brief use.</p>
<p>International Business Machines advanced 3 1/8 to 105 1/2
on 1.6 million shares. Traders attributed the strength to
optimism about the prospects for IBM's new line of mainframe
computers.</p>
<p>Toys `R' Us, the most active Big Board issue, fell 5/8 to
23 1/8 on 2.4 million shares. Wertheim Schroder lowered its
estimates of the toy retailer's 1990 and 1991 earnings.</p>
<p>Equimark rose 1/2 to 5 3/8 following the resignation of
Alan S. Fellheimer as chairman and chief executive officer of
the bank holding company, which omitted its common stock
dividend earlier last week.</p>
<p>Saatchi & Saatchi skidded 1/2 to 3. The British company
suspended dividends on its ordinary shares and some of its
preference shares, citing a lack of available reserves to
make the payouts.</p>
<p>The American Stock Exchange Market Value Index fell 0.73
to 323.77, but rose 0.1% for the week.</p>
