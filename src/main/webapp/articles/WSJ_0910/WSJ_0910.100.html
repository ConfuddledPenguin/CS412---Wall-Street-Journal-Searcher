	<p class="article-leader">Kansas Gas & Electric Co., Wichita, asked the Federal
Energy Regulatory Commission to defer action on Kansas City
Power & Light Co.'s $27-a-share, or $857 million, bid to
acquire Kansas G&E.
   Kansas G&E's motion on Friday asked regulators to deny the
Kansas City, Mo., utility's request for expedited approval of
its acquisition plans; the takeover bid was launched July 23.
Kansas G&E claims the federal agency should wait until a
federal lawsuit, which challenges the legality of the tender
offer, is resolved.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The motion filed with the regulatory agency stated that
"it would not be in the public interest for the commission or
the parties to consider the application if the transaction
forming its basis is illegal." A Kansas City P&L spokesman
said the offer complies with all legal requirements.</p>
<p>In New York Stock Exchange composite trading Friday,
Kansas G&E shares closed at $25.375, up 50 cents, and Kansas
City P&L shares closed at $29.75, up 37.5 cents.</p>
