	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- The board of KPMG Peat Marwick nominated Jon
C. Madonna to succeed Larry D. Horner as chairman and chief
executive officer of the accounting and consulting firm's
U.S. practice, sources close to the company said.
   Although a spokesman for the firm declined to confirm or
deny Mr. Madonna's nomination, he said the 34-member board
had met over the weekend to nominate a successor to Mr.
Horner and that partners likely would be notified today of
the board's choice. Mr. Madonna, 47 years old, is currently
head of the firm's San Francisco office.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The board's nomination doesn't guarantee that Mr. Madonna
will be elected by a majority of the firm's 1,850 partners,
scheduled to meet Oct. 3 and 4. According to the spokesman,
the firm's bylaws allow for 5% of the partners to nominate
their own candidates; they have until Sept. 20 to do so.</p>
<p>The source also said that James G. Brocksmith Jr., 49, who
heads the firm's Chicago office, was nominated as deputy
chairman. Robert W. Beecher, who would reach the mandatory
retirement age of 60 if he stands for another term, is
currently deputy chairman.</p>
<p>Mr. Horner announced in early August that he would not
seek re-election. His terms at KPMG's U.S. and international
practices end Oct. 3 and Dec. 31, respectively. P.J. Butler,
senior partner of the U.K. practice, has been chosen to
succeed Mr. Horner at the international practice.</p>
<p>KPMG Peat Marwick was formed in the December 1986 merger
of Peat Marwick International and Klynveld Main & Goerdeler.</p>
