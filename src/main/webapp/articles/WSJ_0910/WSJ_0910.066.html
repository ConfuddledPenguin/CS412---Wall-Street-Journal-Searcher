	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK - B&H Ocean Carriers Ltd. and B&H Maritime
Carriers Ltd., separately traded companies that are operated
by the same management, said their boards approved proposals
to purchase as much as 20% of their shares outstanding.
   B&H Ocean has about 4.1 million shares and B&H Maritime
about 3.1 million shares outstanding. Michael S. Hudner,
president of both shipping concerns, said the stocks were
significantly undervalued. Through the buy-back programs, Mr.
Hudner said, the companies intend "to both draw the attention
of investors to this situation and to directly increase
shareholder value."</p>
