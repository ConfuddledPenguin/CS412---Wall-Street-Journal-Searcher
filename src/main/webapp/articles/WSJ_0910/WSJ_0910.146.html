	<p class="article-leader">LOS ANGELES -- Shareholders of Odyssey Entertainment Ltd.
and Double Helix Films Inc. approved the merger of the
film-distribution concerns with a new company, Communications
& Entertainment Corp.
   Communications & Entertainment, based in Los Angeles, was
formed in December for the purpose of the merger. J. David
Marks, Odyssey's former chairman and chief executive officer,
is president and chief executive of the new company.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Mr. Marks said that Communications & Entertainment will
"cover the world marketplace demand for film." Both
predecessor companies distributed foreign and U.S. films
overseas, with Odyssey selling mainly to theatrical markets
and New York-based Double Helix mainly to video, television
and cable markets.</p>
<p>"The combination will resolve (Odyssey's) liquidity
problems, which were at worst short-term," Mr. Marks said.
Last month, Odyssey said it needed additional working capital
to continue its operations at current levels. In its first
quarter ended June 30, Odyssey posted net income of $263,916,
including a $600,000 fee from Double Helix for consulting
services.</p>
<p>In the merger, each share of Odyssey common stock will be
exchanged for one share of Communications & Entertainment
Class A stock. Each Class A share is convertible into common
at a conversation ratio of .6375. Each share of Double Helix
common will be exchanged for one share in the new company.</p>
<p>In national over-the-counter trading Friday, Odyssey
shares closed at $1, up 9.36 cents, and Double Helix shares
closed at $2, up 6.25 cents. Communications & Entertainment
said its Class A and common shares will begin trading today
under the symbols CECO.A and CECO, respectively.</p>
