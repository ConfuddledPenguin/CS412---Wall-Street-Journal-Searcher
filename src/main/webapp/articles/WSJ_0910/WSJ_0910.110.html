	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- In a rare show of unanimity, many economists,
bond strategists and big investors are predicting that the
Federal Reserve will reduce short-term interest rates within
four weeks.
   But practically none of them expect the lower rates to
help the economy or the bond market.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>It is rare when large numbers of market pros agree on
anything. Right now, there is a widespread consensus that the
nation's central bank will soon lower the closely watched
federal funds rate 1/4 to 1/2 a percentage point from its
current target level of 8%. The federal funds rate, which
banks charge one another on short-term loans, is extremely
sensitive to changes in Fed policy.</p>
<p>Yet many economists say that a move by the Fed, if it
comes at all, will be too late to stimulate economic growth
and may not stave off a recession.</p>
<p>"It doesn't matter whether they ease now or in four weeks
from now. There is not a lot they can do to influence the
path of the economy during the balance of 1990," said Robert
H. Chandross, vice president and senior economist at Lloyds
Bank PLC.</p>
<p>Mr. Chandross, along with many of his colleagues, found in
Friday's employment report the latest evidence that weakness
in the economy is spreading. The Bureau of Labor Statistics
reported that the unemployment rate rose to 5.6% of the work
force, its highest level in two years. The report also showed
that jobs growth now is weaker than during any time since the
last recession.</p>
<p>Hardest hit last month were the construction and
manufacturing industries, where the number of jobs declined
by 40,000 and 45,000, respectively.</p>
<p>Nancy Kimelman, chief economist at Thomson Financial
Networks, said the employment report was "legitimately bad
news for the economy" that warrants an immediate Fed easing.
She said that if the Fed doesn't lower rates by early this
week, it will have missed its "window of opportunity" to do
so without putting much strain on the financial markets.</p>
<p>Later this week, "the Fed will run into some obstacles,"
she said, specifically, the next inflation report -- Friday's
producer price index.</p>
<p>The data are widely expected to show a sharp rise in
inflation, with most economists estimating an August
inflation rate of between 1% and 1.5%, which translates into
an annual inflation rate of more than 12%.</p>
<p>An easing after the inflation reports might cause yields
on long-term bonds to rise further, and widen the gap between
short-term and long-term rates.</p>
<p>That would be a major blow to bondholders, who already
have seen the value of their holdings depreciate sharply this
year. The yields on 30-year Treasury bonds, for example, have
risen from 7.97% at the start of the year to about 8.91% late
last week. The nearly one-percentage point rise in the yield
translates into a price decline of nearly 6% so far this
year.</p>
<p>The possibility that long-term rates will continue to rise
has prompted bond market strategists at several investment
banking firms on Wall Street to recommend that investors
continue to bail out of long-term bonds.</p>
<p>Merrill Lynch & Co. bond market strategist Thomas J.
Sowanick recommended on Friday that fixed-income investors
pursue a strategy of swapping 30-year bonds and other
long-term securities for notes and bills with shorter
maturities.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>Friday's Market Activity</p>
<p>Bond prices ended higher, reflecting signs of a weakening
economy, the chance of an interest rate easing and optimism
about a deficit-reduction agreement.</p>
<p>The Treasury's 30-year bellwether bond ended at 98 7/32,
up 3/8 point from Thursday. The issue's yield, which moves in
the opposite direction from its price, eased to 8.91% from
8.95%.</p>
<p>In addition to Friday's weak employment report, the bond
market was buoyed by signs that a budget accord might not be
far off. Analysts said the Persian Gulf crisis has spurred
politicians to settle budget issues.</p>
<p>Falling oil prices also provided the fixed-income markets
with some support, although analysts say that as long as oil
remains in a $26-to-$30-a-barrel range, near-term price
action in Treasury securities will be minimal. October oil
futures settled $1.39 lower at $30.04.</p>
<p>In the tax-exempt municipal market, Standard & Poor's
Corp. said it is considering downgrading its Single-A rating
on $606.31 million of New York City Triborough Bridge &
Tunnel Authority mortgage recording tax special-obligation
bonds, Series 1988 and 1989. Interest payments on the bonds
are paid from taxes collected by the city on new mortgages.</p>
<p>S&P said its action reflects a significant erosion in
mortgage recording tax receipts over the past six months.</p>
<p>On the new-issue calendar, more than $2 billion in new
securities are scheduled to be priced this week.</p>
<p>In one of the largest deals anticipated, New York City
will sell approximately $750 million of general obligation
bonds via negotiation. Bear, Stearns & Co. will serve as lead
underwriter.</p>
<p>The issue's ratings are currently under review by Moody's
Investors Service Inc. and S&P.</p>
<p>The city's existing general obligation bonds are rated
single-A by Moody's and single-A-minus by S&P.</p>
<p>Philadelphia is expected to sell $395 million of temporary
loan notes via a Merrill Lynch Capital Markets group.</p>
<p>Philadelphia and underwriting officials have yet to
announce the backing on the issue. A letter of credit is
expected, covering approximately $225 million of the notes
and backed by a consortium of banks, including at least one
foreign bank and Philadelphia area banks.</p>
<p>The city's existing general obligation bonds are rated Ba,
which is below investment grade, by Moody's. S&P rates them
triple-B-minus. Philadelphia is the only major city in the
U.S. with a junk-bond credit rating.</p>
