	<p class="article-leader">MILWAUKEE -- Johnson Controls Inc., the U.S.'s largest
maker of automotive batteries, said it may sell all or part
of its slow-growth battery business.
   The company said it retained Salomon Brothers to explore
options for the battery group, which in fiscal 1989 earned
$34 million on sales of $659 million. Johnson Controls said
that besides possibly selling all or part of the business, it
could link up with a partner or opt to keep the business. The
company didn't set a deadline for the review.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>A spokeswoman said the decision to review its options on
batteries reflects the dim outlook for the kind of profit
growth Johnson Controls is seeking for its segments, which
also include facility-management services, auto seats, and
plastic containers. In the year ended Sept. 30, the company
earned $97.5 million, or $2.55 a share, on sales of $3.68
billion.</p>
<p>"While we are looking for slightly improved earnings in
fiscal 1990 and 1991, the battery business's participation in
a slow-growth market will preclude the desired kind of profit
growth," the spokeswoman said. The U.S. automobile industry
has been in a 3 1/2-year-long sales slide.</p>
<p>Officials also believe that while long-term prospects for
batteries are good, the business will require a "relatively
high rate of capital expenditures over the next several
years," she said. Johnson Controls spent $44 million in
capital-spending funds in fiscal 1989 on the battery group,
which operates 17 U.S. plants and has 5,500 employees.
Overall capital spending last year was $192 million.</p>
<p>About 85% of Johnson Controls' battery sales are for the
replacement market. The company makes all the batteries for
Sears, Roebuck & Co., the largest replacement-battery
retailer. But Johnson Controls also is an original-equipment
supplier to every major domestic and foreign auto maker
except General Motors Corp., which supplies its own
batteries. Excluding GM, Johnson Controls has an estimated
50% share of the original-equipment battery market.</p>
