	<p class="article-leader">Seeq Technology Inc. said it will stop mass producing
chips at its San Jose, Calif., plant and will take a pretax
charge of up to $10 million to lay off 95 employees and
convert the plant to a research-and-development facility.
   After the conversion, which is expected to be completed in
March 1991, Seeq said it will have all its chips made for it
by other companies under contract. Seeq said that the
conversion, which will result in a $8 million to $10 million
charge in its fourth quarter, will reduce expenses and allow
it to concentrate on developing new products, new
technologies and marketing.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Seeq began contracting out some of its production in 1989
when it formed a pact with a U.S. unit of the Netherlands'
N.V. Philips, which makes parts to Seeq's specifications in
an Albuquerque, N.M., plant. Taiwan's Hualon Microelectronics
Corp., which holds 10% of Seeq's stock, also began making
chips for Seeq in July.</p>
