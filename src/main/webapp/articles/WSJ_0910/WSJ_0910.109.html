	<p class="article-leader">Worthen Banking Corp. said it completed the controversial
acquisition of certain assets and liabilities of Independence
Federal Bank, making the bank holding company's Worthen Bank
& Trust Co. unit the first commercial bank in Arkansas to
operate a statewide network of branches.
   Arkansas banking authorities had opposed Worthen's plans
to purchase the failed thrift from the Resolution Trust
Corp., arguing that the move would violate state restrictions
on bank branching. But a federal appeals court in St. Louis
ruled that the RTC, the federal agency handling the S&L
cleanup, has the power to override such state banking laws.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Worthen, Little Rock, Ark., said it paid $1.5 million to
acquire $320 million in deposits and certain assets of
Independence, including 20 branch locations. The purchase
more than doubles the number of communities served by
Worthen.</p>
