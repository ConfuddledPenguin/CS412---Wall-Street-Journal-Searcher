	<p class="article-leader">Porsche AG, citing a strong climb in domestic sales and an
improved product mix, said group sales in the year ended July
31 jumped 21% to 3.045 billion marks ($1.96 billion) from
2.526 billion marks in the previous year.
   The West German sports-car maker said earnings "improved
further" from last year's earnings due to cost-cutting
measures introduced last year and an increase in sales
volume. It provided no details. Last year, net income more
than doubled to 54.2 million marks from 25.3 million marks in
the previous year.</p>
