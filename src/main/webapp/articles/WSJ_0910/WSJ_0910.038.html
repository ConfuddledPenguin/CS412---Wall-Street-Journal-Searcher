	<p class="article-leader">SEYMOUR, Conn. -- Lowell Weicker is administering a jolt
to a state that has long regarded itself as the land of
steady habits.
   The former senator, a Republican who won national
attention for attacking Richard Nixon during Watergate and
who angered Ronald Reagan by opposing Contra aid, Star Wars,
tax overhaul and school prayer, is running for governor as an
independent and is ahead in the polls.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>A towering Connecuticut Yankee in a rumpled size-17
pinpoint oxford-cloth dress shirt, Mr. Weicker is the bull in
the genteel china shop of this state's politics. The shards
are already flying.</p>
<p>Mr. Weicker, defeated two years ago by Democrat Joseph
Lieberman in a fight for a fourth Senate term, contends the
public has "a total revulsion toward both political parties."
But Republican state Rep. Robert Maddox claims the Weicker
campaign is "one of the greatest charades since Barnum and
Bailey were around."</p>
<p>Whether visionary or opportunist, Mr. Weicker has
transformed the race to succeed retiring Democratic Gov.
William O'Neill into a three-ring circus, with himself at the
center of the tent. Rep. John Rowland, the Republican
nominee, and the two Democrats battling in tomorrow's primary
-- Congressman Bruce Morrison and state Rep. William Cibes --
have been forced to struggle for bits of the limelight.</p>
<p>If Mr. Weicker prevails in November's election, his real
challenge remains ahead. Like other New England states,
Connecticut suffers from deep economic distress; in a time of
economic growth, the state still lost 50,000 manufacturing
jobs in five years. The current state budget is balanced
precariously on $570 million of onetime savings, including
deferred pension contributions for state employees and
teachers, and the state faces the possibility of running a
deficit of $1 billion or more next year.</p>
<p>"The next governor is going to have an enormously
difficult job -- the biggest challenge any Connecticut
governor has faced in modern times," says former GOP Rep.
Lawrence DeNardis, president of the Connecticut Public
Expenditure Council, a nonpartisan analysis group. "The size
and scope of the problems are staggering."</p>
<p>Mr. Weicker's response is one part Ronald Reagan, one part
Franklin Roosevelt: repeal the corporate-tax surcharge and
the utility tax on nonmanufacturing businesses, establish $25
million of targeted tax incentives for depressed rural areas
and big cities, and start a public-works program to provide
jobs.</p>
<p>The magnitude of Connecticut's problems is feeding Mr.
Weicker's attack. "If I get elected," he says, "there's a
shot being fired across the bow of the two parties."</p>
<p>This anti-politics movement is being led by a rebel who is
still a registered Republican. Mr. Weicker, whose family
built the Squibb pharmaceutical fortune, prepped at the
Lawrenceville School before going on to Yale and the
University of Virginia Law School. Today he lives in a
250-year-old house in Greenwich that is paneled with wood
from Daniel Webster's home; monogrammed cocktail napkins
carrying the words "Applejack Farm," the 17th-century name of
the property, sit on the coffee table. Two of his
standard-bred trotting horses run at Rosecroft Raceway in
Maryland. His adjusted gross income last year was $448,000.</p>
<p>He has given Connecticut's well-entrenched two-party
system its biggest shock since 1938, when Socialist Jasper
McLevy siphoned off enough votes to enable a Republican to
defeat longtime Democratic Gov. Wilbur Cross. If he wins, Mr.
Weicker would be only the third independent governor in the
U.S. this century, and lawmakers and pundits already are
contemplating how the hoary customs of Hartford might fare if
the governor has no party members to call on in the
legislature.</p>
<p>"There will still be a legislature full of Republicans and
Democrats," says Morton Tenzer, a University of Connecticut
political scientist. "Weicker doesn't have any candidates of
his own, and he won't have any `Weickerite' members of the
legislature."</p>
<p>But already there are defections from the two major
parties. Last month, Mr. Weicker won the backing of two
Republicans, former gubernatorial candidate Joseph McGee and
state Rep. Mae Schmidle, and of a prominent black Democrat
from New Haven, state Rep. Walter Brooks.</p>
<p>"To blacks he offers an opportunity to see a
transformation of the political process," says Wendell Harp,
a Democratic architect from New Haven. "Here we have an
opportunity to have a major office won by someone who has no
ties to the two parties. It gives us an opportunity not to be
taken for granted." John Einhorn, a New Haven alderman
prominent in Republican political circles, adds: "We need
something new, a new direction."</p>
<p>Mr. Weicker's gambit has caused bitterness within the
Republican Party. Marie Phelan, former GOP town chairman in
Killingsworth, says she's "in tune with his views" but won't
support Mr. Weicker because "I have a real problem with what
he's doing." Fellow Republicans told the Fairfield GOP
chairman that he was "finished" when he announced his support
of Mr. Weicker, who had been regarded as something of an
ideological turncoat when he was running on the Republican
line.</p>
<p>Many analysts attribute Mr. Weicker's 1988 defeat to the
failure of conservative Republicans to vote for him. "I have
no reason to complain about what he's doing now," says GOP
state Rep. Thomas Scott. "I've wanted him out of the party
for 10 years."</p>
<p>Mr. Weicker's campaign as an independent -- technically
he's running as a candidate of what he calls "A Connecticut
Party" -- is itself a symbol of how the Republican Party has
changed. He came out of the liberal wing of the GOP that, in
Connecticut, had its deepest roots in his home town of
Greenwich and in the executive suites of the insurance
companies of Hartford. These Republicans, clearly
establishment figures, were strong supporters of Wendell
Wilkie in 1940 and later sided with Thomas Dewey and Dwight
Eisenhower against Robert Taft.</p>
<p>Today, Connecticut's Republicans are more conservative,
more Catholic and have more working-class roots than they did
when Mr. Weicker became a member of the Connecticut general
assembly and launched a career that would take him to the
House and finally the Senate. In time, Mr. Weicker, now 59
years old, grew weary of the estrangement he felt in his own
party. He is running as an independent as much by necessity
as by choice.</p>
<p>"If I was going to do this, it wasn't going to be for a
philosophical discussion within the party," he says. "I don't
want some delegate from some town putting his finger in my
eye and asking me why I voted for the Panama Canal Treaty. If
I was going to do it, I was going all the way."</p>
<p>So now Mr. Weicker is wagering that the state that
produced practical men like Eli Whitney and Seth Thomas might
again show the rebellious streak that also offered refuge to
such iconoclasts as patriot leader Nathan Hale, abolitionist
John Brown and writers Harriet Beecher Stowe and Mark Twain.
He's seeking to make a virtue of his lack of party
nomination, boasting that he was nominated not by "900
politicians huddled in the Civic Center" but by the 105,430
people who signed his ballot petition.</p>
<p>"This is deregulated politics," he says. "All I've done is
created more competition. Business has high prices and bad
products when there is a monopoly. The same is true with
politics. The two-party system has gotten people in a hell of
a lot of trouble in this country."</p>
