	<p class="article-leader">Baltimore Bancorp asked federal regulators to investigate
whether T. Rowe Price Associates Inc., the bank's largest
shareholder, is illegally trying to influence the company's
actions.
   In a letter to the Federal Reserve Board, Baltimore
Bancorp alleged that T. Rowe Price, which owns 9.4% of the
company, is attempting to exercise a "controlling influence"
over the bank without required federal approval.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission
last week, T. Rowe Price said it was considering its options
in light of Baltimore Bancorp's recent rejection of an
unsolicited $17-a-share offer from a unit of Allied Irish
Banks PLC.</p>
<p>T. Rowe Price said in the filing that it "may communicate
with management, other shareholders or any other interested
persons to determine what alternative courses of action may
better serve" its interests. The Baltimore investment firm
also said it might sell or buy more shares.</p>
<p>"It's very clear {T. Rowe Price} is trying to influence
what management is doing," said H. Rodgin Cohen, an attorney
with Sullivan & Cromwell, which is representing the bank.
"And you can't exercise control of a bank without getting the
Federal Reserve's prior approval."</p>
<p>In a statement, T. Rowe Price said its actions are
"consistent with all applicable laws and regulations."</p>
