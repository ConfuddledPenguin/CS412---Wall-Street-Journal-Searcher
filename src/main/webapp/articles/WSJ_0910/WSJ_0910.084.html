	<h3>The Outlook: Troubling Signs Of Slower Growth</h3>

	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- The prospect for a recession is the economic
topic grabbing headlines and financial-market attention these
days. But recessions come and go. A more important question
for American living standards is how the economy will perform
over the next decade or two. And there are troubling new
signs that the answer isn't good.
   For the first 25 years after World War II, the U.S.
economy did a fine job of achieving every parent's dream: a
better life for his or her children. Economic growth averaged
better than 3% a year. There were ups and downs, recessions
and recoveries, but the upward trend was always clear.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>In the past two decades, however, the assumption of
steadily rising living standards has been challenged. Growth
slowed sharply in the 1970s. It picked up some in the 1980s,
but generally remained short of the strong growth in the 25
years after the war.</p>
<p>Optimistic economists, including those who advise
President Bush, have argued that the growth trend will
rebound in the 1990s to the 3% average of the early postwar
years. But other economists, including some who make monetary
policy at the Federal Reserve, have been cautiously looking
for growth of about 2.5% a year.</p>
<p>"We must accept the fact that the real economy can, over
the foreseeable future, grow at a rate of no more than about
2.5%," New York Federal Reserve Bank President Gerald
Corrigan said in December 1988. "Growth at a rate in excess
of that amount would entail wholly unacceptable risks of
accelerating inflation."</p>
<p>Now comes evidence that Mr. Corrigan may have been too
optimistic. After sifting through the latest revisions of
government data, some economists are beginning to wonder if
the nation's growth trend has dropped to well below 2% a
year.</p>
<p>That troublesome conclusion can be culled from revised
Commerce Department figures released earlier this summer but
widely ignored. They show that growth last year was
substantially slower than previously reported. The nation's
total output, or gross national product, expanded only 1.8%
after adjusting for inflation, rather than the 2.6%
previously reported. Yet unemployment remained at a 15-year
low of 5.3%, suggesting that the economy, while sluggish, may
be growing at its full potential.</p>
<p>"What it is telling us is that when we are fully employed,
which is where we've been since 1988, we grow only 1% to 2%,
not 2% to 3%," says economist Paul Samuelson, the Nobel
laureate at Massachusetts Institute of Technology. "It also
means that's all you should expect." If growth remains that
slow, living standards seem sure to stagnate.</p>
<p>The economy can grow in two ways: by putting more people
to work or by making each worker produce more. When nearly
everyone is working, the second way -- greater productivity
-- is the primary engine of growth. In the U.S., however, a
decade or more of inadequate investment in education and
equipment has made productivity gains disappointingly slim.</p>
<p>There's the possibility, to be sure, that the new data are
misleading. They may be revised again someday. Moreover,
productivity gains may increase if the slow-growth phenomenon
stems from transitory circumstances. Commerce Undersecretary
Michael Darby, who oversees the GNP figures, claims the
numbers are temporarily distorted by the slump in the
Northeast, with its highly skilled, productive workers, and
the recovery in the Southwest, where each additional worker
employed adds relatively little to the GNP total.</p>
<p>But there is no doubting the troubling implications if Mr.
Samuelson's interpretation is correct. "It would be
dreadfully profound," Mr. Darby acknowledges.</p>
<p>In such circumstances, the Fed, to keep the economy from
overheating and reigniting inflation, would presumably try to
hold growth to 2% a year or less. Americans would have to
keep working harder -- longer hours, more moonlighting --
just to keep up, since wages wouldn't rise much. More would
find that their living standards weren't much better than
their parents' and the dream of steady economic progress
would fade.</p>
<p>To avoid this, the U.S. needs to invest more. Then
productivity can grow more rapidly. But a nation can invest
for tomorrow only as much as it saves today -- or borrows
from foreigners. The recent record suggests Americans don't
save enough, with the federal deficit consuming much of what
they do save.</p>
<p>This is why many economists argue that the best course is
to cut the budget deficit now. Higher taxes and lower
spending may pinch the economy over the next year or so and
increase the odds of recession. But such measures would also
help to solve the overriding problems that cloud the outlook
for the longer run.</p>
