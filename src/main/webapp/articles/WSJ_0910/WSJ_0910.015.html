	<p class="article-leader">Olsten Corp., in a move that would triple its home
health-care business, said it agreed to acquire Upjohn
HealthCare Services Inc., a unit of Upjohn Co.
   Terms weren't disclosed, but some analysts estimated the
transaction value at $60 million to $70 million. The unit,
which provides home health-care and supplemental staffing to
hospitals and nursing homes, accounted for $182 million, or
about 6%, of Upjohn's total 1989 revenue.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>With the acquisition, Olsten of Westbury, N.Y., obtains a
national network of home health-care offices already in place
and a new foothold in Canada. For Upjohn, the Kalamazoo,
Mich., maker of ethical drugs, the sale effectively ends its
arduous efforts to lift a business that's been a drain on
profits.</p>
<p>"This particular division was a problem area for Upjohn,"
said Jerry Levine, analyst with Merrill Lynch. "It never made
a lot of money for them and it didn't have synergy with the
company's plans."</p>
<p>For Olsten, however, the acquisition allows it to
"effectively blanket North America with offices,"said Frank
N. Liguori, the company's chief executive officer. "It saves
us years of internal growth and development."</p>
<p>Olsten, which provides temporary personnel for the office
and home health-care markets, earned $18 million on revenue
of $580 million in 1989.</p>
