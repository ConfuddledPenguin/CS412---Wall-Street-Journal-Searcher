	<p class="article-leader">Rax Restaurants Inc., hurt by slower sales at its
fast-food outlets and higher operating costs, said it will
slash 25% of its 130-person corporate staff as part of a
restructuring plan.
   "It's important that we deal with our internal expenses at
this time since they are such a major component of our
costs," said Ira A. Hermann, president and chief executive
officer of Rax, based in Columbus, Ohio.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>For the third quarter ended April 30, Rax reported a loss
of $736,000, or 10 cents a share, on revenue of $27.4
million.</p>
<p>The chain of 450 restaurants has spent heavily on new
products. The products have shown promise, but other chains
have introduced similar menu items.</p>
<p>The fast-food industry also has been hit by a drop in
customer traffic, analysts said, and there is the added
pressure to keep prices low as the bigger chains discount
products to attract more business. The price-cutting
strategies can work because some customers "at the margin
notice if the price is 10 cents more or less" and will switch
to other restaurants, says Michael Mueller, restaurant
analyst at Montgomery Securities in San Francisco.</p>
