	<p class="article-leader">MANILA, the Philippines -- Fuel price increases made
necessary by the Mideast crisis pose a looming challenge to
Philippine President Corazon Aquino's battered
administration, which already is reeling from a string of
natural and man-made disasters.
   The price increases, which are expected before the end of
the month, are likely to feed inflation and risk triggering
transport and labor strikes that military rebels could
exploit as a reason for another coup attempt.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Apparently in an effort to damp anticipated protests and
shore up eroding support from the non-communist left, Mrs.
Aquino has offered to begin talks with the communist-led
National Democratic Front. The front has yet to reply to Mrs.
Aquino's proposal, but NDF officials have been quoted as
saying they are interested because of the likely propaganda
boost the talks would give to the group's struggling
insurgency.</p>
<p>Diplomats and analysts, however, worry that Mrs. Aquino's
strategy could backfire by intensifying right-wing impatience
with her government at a time when it already is vulnerable
to military insurrection.</p>
<p>Fears of another coup attempt have been heightened by the
21 bombings that have rocked Manila in the past three weeks,
the latest occurring Wednesday night about 500 meters from
the president's residence. Officials blame the bombings on
rebel soldiers, including Gregorio "Gringo" Honasan, leader
of three previous coup attempts, including one last December.</p>
<p>Talk of a coup dominates local media: Columnists write
that they are more concerned with "coup-wait" than Kuwait.
And though few people openly call for a military uprising,
many say they are deeply disappointed by Mrs. Aquino's
failure to make full use of the tremendous prestige she
garnered when she was swept to power in a February 1986
popular revolt that ended 21 years of corrupt rule by
Ferdinand Marcos.</p>
<p>"In the Marcos years, there was no hope. She (Mrs. Aquino)
offered hope in the beginning, but now the mood is turning
black," says Luis Virata, managing director of Exchange
Capital Corp., an investment-advisory affiliate of Jardine
Fleming Holdings Ltd. "There is a crisis of confidence."</p>
<p>Mr. Virata says he is worried less about the bombs --
which have caused heavy damage but relatively few injuries --
than about the government's failure to ensure such basic
services as garbage collection, electricity and flood
control. "Government is not doing its job," he says.</p>
<p>Last month, monsoon rains twice flooded Manila, paralyzing
the city and killing about 25 people. The floods were
worsened by uncollected garbage that clogged the city's storm
drains. Thousands of slum dwellers were left homeless.</p>
<p>Disappointment with Mrs. Aquino's government cuts across
class lines. Ronnie Graga, a 25-year-old security guard, says
he has seen "no improvement" since Mrs. Aquino came to power.
"We were not fortunate in Marcos's time, and we are not
fortunate in Cory's time," he says. "With oil prices going
up, I can only imagine that life will get worse."</p>
<p>Supporters of Mrs. Aquino say she has survived challenges
that could have toppled a more experienced leader. Since the
December coup attempt, the sixth during Mrs. Aquino's
presidency, the Philippines has been battered by drought and
a devastating earthquake, as well as the floods.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the army is fighting a rebellion on the
southern island of Mindanao, where Alexander Noble, a former
presidential security chief, is leading animist tribes
against the government. According to local press reports,
more than 8,000 people have been displaced since the campaign
began in mid-August.</p>
<p>Last week, Sen. John Osmena, a former supporter of Mrs.
Aquino, urged the president to dismiss her cabinet and pass
executive power to an ad hoc committee that would manage
state affairs until a new president is elected in 1992. As
expected, Mrs. Aquino scorned the suggestion, asserting that
her government will withstand both military threats and a
"constitutional coup" such as that proposed by Sen. Osmena.
Few took the senator's suggestion seriously, but the exchange
highlighted the extent to which support for Mrs. Aquino has
crumbled.</p>
<p>In such an environment, the president now must push
through a fuel price increase opposed by organized labor and
many of the grass-roots groups that helped bring her to
power.</p>
<p>The left-leaning Kilusang Mayo Uno, one of the country's
two biggest labor federations, has staged rallies against a
fuel price increase and called for a general strike if fuel
prices rise. The comparatively moderate Trade Union Congress
of the Philippines also opposes a fuel price adjustment. "If
oil prices are increased it will cause a chain reaction,"
says Avelino Valerio, vice president of the TUCP. "We will
have to demand wage increases."</p>
<p>There are no official figures on the likely impact of
higher fuel prices on inflation, which now is running at an
annual rate of about 13% and is projected by some senior
government officials to reach 18% by the end of the year.</p>
<p>Inflation aside, a rise in gasoline prices alone risks
inflaming one of Manila's most powerful labor groups: drivers
of the brightly colored jeepneys, the principal means of
transport for most of the capital's residents.</p>
<p>"Our drivers can hardly provide their families with three
meals per day," says Oscar Lazaro, president of one of the
city's many jeepney drivers associations. "If they (the
government) increase the price of oil and gasoline, fares
must go up." Mr. Lazaro adds that drivers' earnings already
have been trimmed by mounting congestion, which daily brings
Manila traffic to a near standstill, reducing the number of
runs per jeepney.</p>
<p>Labor leaders suggest that the government should cushion
the blow of higher oil prices by reducing fuel taxes, which
now average about 32%, or by suspending payments on the
country's foreign debt, a course Mrs. Aquino has rejected.</p>
<p>The Philippines depends on petroleum for 65% of its energy
needs and imports nearly all of the 240,000 barrels of crude
it uses each day. Domestic fuel prices are based on a
crude-oil price of $16.53 a barrel and an exchange rate of
21.9 pesos to the dollar. Since the start of the latest
Mideast crisis on Aug. 2, crude-oil prices have risen to
about $30 a barrel, while the Philippine currency has fallen
to nearly 25 pesos to the dollar. During the same period,
local fuel prices have remained constant.</p>
<p>The government uses an Oil Price Stabilization Fund to
compensate the three oil companies operating in the country
for losses by providing a forward cover on exchange rates and
subsidizing the difference between crude-oil prices and
domestic fuel prices. (The oil companies have been
petitioning the government for fuel price increases.)</p>
<p>The fund was intended as a buffer, to be built up during
times of low world oil prices by maintaining relatively
higher domestic prices. However, Mrs. Aquino and the
legislature authorized a cut in domestic prices last year,
after crude prices declined. When crude prices climbed again,
the fund quickly fell into deficit.</p>
<p>This year, the government allocated five billion pesos
($207 million) to subsidize the fund. The allocation was
quickly exhausted and industry sources estimate that the fund
now owes the oil companies an additional 6.5 billion pesos
for oil already delivered.</p>
<p>Without a price adjustment, the Philippines would owe the
oil companies as much as 12 billion pesos by the end of the
year, depending on world crude prices, industry sources says.</p>
<p>Matthijs V.P. Venker, vice president of Pilipinas Shell
Petroleum Corp., says officials and the Philippine business
community understand the need for a fuel price increase. "It
is up to them to bite the bullet on this, and the earlier
they bite it the better," he says, adding that an increase
likely will be announced before the end of the month.</p>
<p>Those who want to see Mrs. Aquino weather her current
troubles hope that her offer to open talks with the
communists and other recent efforts to mend fences with
grass-roots groups will ease the way for a price increase.
"Labor will be a serious problem if it is not premanaged,"
says Melinda Quintos de Jesus, a columnist active in the
movement that helped bring Mrs. Aquino to power. Strong
leadership could make the difference, she says, but adds that
there is a growing sense that "the government is being
overtaken by these many crises."</p>
