	<p class="article-leader">Gemini Partners Limited Partnership, seeking to unseat
Healthco International Inc.'s board, said it has a majority
of consent cards executed by Healthco shareholders that, if
certified, would mean removal of Healthco's current board.
   Healthco, a dental-equipment company based in Boston,
responded by questioning the validity and the number of the
consents collected by Gemini.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Gemini, a New York limited partnership with a 9.96% stake
in Healthco, said it delivered to Healthco written consents
representing holders of about 4,200,700 shares, or about 54%,
of Healthco's common stock outstanding out of a total of
7,734,592 shares as of June 25, the record date for the
consent solicitation.</p>
<p>But Healthco questions Gemini's count. "Based on our
review, it appears that Gemini doesn't have, as it has
claimed, consents representing more than 50% of Healthco's
stock. Moreover, all of Gemini's consents would appear to
have been obtained in violation of federal proxy rules and
therefore, are invalid," Healthco said.</p>
<p>Gemini filed a lawsuit last week in Delaware Chancery
Court against Healthco and its current directors seeking a
judgment declaring that the current board has been lawfully
removed by Healthco shareholders and that Gemini's
seven-member slate has been elected in their place.</p>
<p>Healthco, which last agreed to be acquired for $19.25 a
share, or about $250 million, by Hicks, Muse & Co., a Dallas
leveraged-buy-out specialist, postponed the annual meeting
scheduled for Sept. 6 to Sept. 25. The postponement was
announced the night before the meeting was to be held. The
record date for the meeting remains the same. The acquisition
is subject to shareholder approval.</p>
<p>In its lawsuit, Gemini charges that the Healthco meeting
was postponed "only after it was virtually certain that
Healthco's stockholders were about to oust the board" in
favor of Gemini's slate.</p>
<p>Gemini has charged that the board agreed to the Hicks Muse
acquisition to avoid losing the consent solicitation. It said
that the acquisition price is inadequate and that it may
retain an investment banker to help seek buyers for Healthco.</p>
<p>Healthco said the meeting was postponed because the
Securities and Exchange Commission expressed concern over
whether stockholders would have time to react to the
acquisition agreement and because of "misinformation" in the
marketplace concerning the proposed acquisition.</p>
<p>Separately, Healthco's counsel said late Friday that the
company has been told by Hicks Muse that it filed suit in
Texas against the Healthco board backed by Gemini. The suit
asserts that the Gemini group violated certain agreements in
the merger accord between Healthco and Hicks Muse. The suit
asks unspecified damages and charges breach of good faith by
the Gemini-backed board.</p>
