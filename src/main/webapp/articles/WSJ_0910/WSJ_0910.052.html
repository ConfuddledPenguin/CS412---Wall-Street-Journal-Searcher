	<p class="article-leader">QANTEL Corp. (Hayward, Calif.) -- Karl H. Niemuller will
resign as president and chief executive officer and Alan H.
Friedman will resign as chief financial officer, both
effective Dec. 6. Last December, Matthew E. Tutino resigned
as head of the minicomputer maker, citing a desire to move on
to other projects. In a news release, Qantel said Niemuller
resigned "for personal reasons," but would continue serving
on the board. Successors have not yet been named.</p>
