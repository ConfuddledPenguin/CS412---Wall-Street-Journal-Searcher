	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Economists shave a bit more from already thin
forecasts and brace for a big oil-inflation hit this week.
   Following Friday's weak jobs report, coming data on August
industrial production and capacity utilization are expected
to at best hover around July levels. And the much-awaited
initial impact from the oil crisis hits the August producer
price index -- the consensus view calls for a jump of 1.3%,
up from July's dip of 0.1%. A soft August retail sales report
is also in the cards, although the economic hand won't be
dealt until Friday, when all the data are released. The
week's only other major indicator is July consumer credit,
due out today.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"The whole economy is just hanging on by its toenails,"
said Lawrence Kudlow, economist at Bear, Stearns & Co., New
York. He said the weak employment data suggest real gross
national product could drop into the negative column in the
third quarter. One negative reading on GNP, or the total
value of the nation's goods and services, doesn't make a
recession. But it could be an official starting point. Still,
Mr. Kudlow is among the group that says the recession may
already be under way.</p>
<p>"Real business people have been telling me we're in a
recession for six months. And that's good enough for me,"
said Mr. Kudlow. Still, he isn't a "doom and gloomer" and
expects only a short duration for any downturn.</p>
<p>Robert McGee, chief economist at Tokai Bank Ltd., New
York, lowered his expectations for August industrial output
on the basis of the weak employment data. Mr. McGee now
expects a decline of 0.2% in industrial production;
previously he thought output would maintain July's flat
reading. He also shaved his estimate for the related capacity
utilization reading to 83.1% from 83.3%. In July, the
nation's factories operated at 83.4% of capacity.</p>
<p>One forecast economists haven't changed much since the
Iraqi invasion of Kuwait: sharply higher producer prices.
"That's baked into the cake," said Mr. McGee, who expects a
jump of one percentage point in wholesale prices.</p>
<p>Both producer and consumer price indexes are expected to
soar for a while. The August consumer price index, due out
next week, is expected to jump 0.8%, according to MMS
International, a unit of McGraw-Hill Inc., New York. But
economists will also be keeping tabs on the inflation gauges
minus their volatile energy and food components. Excluding
food and energy, August producer prices are expected to
increase 0.3% and consumer prices 0.4%, according to MMS.</p>
<p>August retail sales are also expected to be soft, slipping
0.1%, according to the consensus view. In July, retail sales
gained 0.1%. Ironically, the energy crisis could help support
sales through higher gasoline-station receipts. Excluding
autos, August retail sales are expected to increase 0.2%,
about the same as in July.</p>
<p>Donald Fine, chief market analyst at Chase Manhattan Bank,
New York, said he's ratcheting down expectations for the
third quarter largely because of the weak employment data.
Mr. Fine had been expecting GNP growth of 1% in the period,
but now thinks a range of 0.5% to 1% is more realistic.</p>
<p>Still, he believes the quarter will manage to stay out of
the red largely because of the giant service sector, which
has stimulated job growth throughout this economic expansion.
While service business employment has been slowing, "it will
still carry us into the positive category" for the quarter,
Mr. Fine said.</p>
