	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Prime-time soap operas may be nearly extinct,
but the new television season that begins later this month is
riddled with its own sort of melodrama:
   Which antihero will win the nation's heart: a beer-bellied
slob named Uncle Buck or a street-wise rapper who has
annointed himself the Fresh Prince? Will America dump its
favorite dad for a spiky-haired, unrepentant punk named Bart
Simpson? Might "Twin Peaks" freaks just stop caring who
killed Laura Palmer and resurrect the career of that
perennial goofball, Carol Burnett?</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>And then there's the biggest question of all: Will the Big
Three networks succeed in slowing or halting their steady
decline as viewers turn to alternatives?</p>
<p>Last season, the three networks played it safe, serving up
shows that the critics dismissed as dull, bordering on
stupid. But they came away with no new hits, and their share
of the nightly audience slid to a lowly 65%, down two points
from the previous season and off sharply from an 86.2% share
a decade ago.</p>
<p>This time around, the Big Three are embracing risk and
aiming for fare that is quirky, controversial and -- whenever
possible, it seems -- in questionable taste. The networks and
their Fox stepsister are poised to launch nearly three dozen
shows this season. They are also assigning new time slots to
19 returning series, an unusually high number of scheduling
changes.</p>
<p>Some fret about the extent of the switches. "On the one
hand, all this change creates excitement," says Robert A.
Iger, the top programming executive at ABC, owned by Capital
Cities/ABC Inc. "But on the other hand, we're creating chaos
that could turn out to be detrimental. I just don't know how
you stop this."</p>
<p>The network moves will force the audience to make tough
choices, or, worse, compel techno-klutz viewers to finally
bone up on how to program their videocassete recorders to
tape one show while they watch another.</p>
<p>Here is a preview of some of the key battles:</p>
<p>MONDAYS AT 8 P.M.</p>
<p>America has a penchant for picking new antiheroes, and
this season the choice may boil down to CBS's Uncle Buck -- a
rotund, foul-mouthed guardian of three bratty, wise-cracking
kids -- or NBC's Fresh Prince, a cocky, mug-for-the-camera
rap singer who postures with a hard-edged sweetness.</p>
<p>For CBS's "Uncle Buck," the other looming issue may be
whether a John Candy vehicle can work without its driver. The
latter-day Fatty Arbuckle won raves in the movie, but the
weekly character will be played by a lesser known -- and
smaller -- big guy, Kevin Meany. Can Mr. Meany's gross
habits, which include tossing a lit cigar into a fish tank,
attract an audience?</p>
<p>NBC hopes "Fresh Prince of Bel Air" is a fish-out-of-water
premise that can jumpstart the network's Monday lineup. The
show stars Will Smith as an inner-city kid from Philadelphia
whose parents ship him cross-country to live with his
wealthy, stuffy relatives.</p>
<p>Both shows target the young audience. "We're in the best
possible position," says Andy Borowitz, co-executive producer
of "Fresh Prince," adding that "NBC finished No. 3 in the
time period last year, so anything we do will be an
improvement." Advance word from critics and ad executives is
positive for "Fresh Prince" -- and negative for the Buckster.</p>
<p>WEDNESDAYS AT 10 P.M.</p>
<p>Take your pick: NBC's traditional, tough-talking TV cop --
played by the Clint Eastwood of series fare, former football
player Fred Dwyer, sans his gorgeous sidekick of six seasons
-- or ABC's bellowing baritone, who walks a beat on the
cops-and-crime musical "Cop Rock."</p>
<p>"Hunter" represents more of the same, starting its seventh
season of the usual bang-bang and "works for me" acting of
Mr. Dwyer. But for ABC, "Cop Rock" figures as a big risk: It
is a police drama presented as a musical, with original songs
scored by the acerbic Randy Newman.</p>
<p>"Cop Rock" is the second series produced for ABC by "Hill
Street Blues" co-creator Steven Bochco, who is under an
exclusive contract to the network. Mr. Iger, president of ABC
Entertainment, is betting on weirdness, and Mr. Bochco has
served him well before: "Doogie Howser M.D." on ABC was the
only semi-success of any new show last fall. And in some
ways, the "Doog Man," as he is affectionately known, was just
as off-center -- the show focuses on a 16-year-old, pubescent
surgeon and manages to make him believable.</p>
<p>But the surprise sleeper could well turn out to be CBS's
"WIOU." While "Hunter" and "Cop Rock" play up policemen and
are expected to draw a macho crowd, "WIOU" chronicles the
goings-on at a hapless local TV station and aims to appeal to
women. Sponsors take note.</p>
<p>THURSDAYS AT 8 P.M.
</p>
<p>It's spike-haired Bart and his cartoon family on Fox's
"The Simpsons" against the series that is credited with
turning around NBC, "The Cosby Show." Add to the face-off a
goofy yet expensive show, CBS's "The Flash," and viewers may
see the hottest contest of the week. All three series aim for
youngsters, who control the dial at 8 p.m. and bring their
folks along with them.</p>
<p>Will the fatherly advice doled out by Bill Cosby get
drowned out by the doltish rantings of the overweight,
bumbling Homer Simpson -- the patriarch that far more men can
identify with?</p>
<p>New episodes of "The Cosby Show" premiere Sept. 20, while
originals of "The Simpsons" won't appear until Oct. 11. But
Bill Cosby has been whupping Bart for three consecutive weeks
now, and already Fox's rivals are gloating.</p>
<p>"Cosby is still the champ," declares Bernie Kukoff,
co-executive producer of the long-running, highly rated show.
He's even considering taking a shot at "The Simpsons" by
including an apt joke in a later episode.</p>
<p>"I'll admit the results so far have made us more nervous
about a move we didn't want in the first place," says Sam
Simon, co-executive producer of "The Simpsons." "We were much
more fragile than people thought, and I think it was much too
soon to move us. But the show is important to everyone at
Fox, so they won't let us die on Thursdays."</p>
<p>CBS, in third place in the prime-time ratings for three
consecutive years, thinks "The Flash" will drain young
viewers away from Fox's radical dude, Bart Simpson. "We're
the underdog with the least amount to lose," says Jeff
Sagansky, president of CBS Entertainment. "We think we could
be the spoiler when the season starts."</p>
<p>The series that will benefit from having three shows chase
the same audience features a cutesy nun who solves crimes.
The earnest ABC series "Father Dowling Mysteries," which
features singer Ricky Nelson's daughter as a nun and Tom
Bosley, the dad from the old "Happy Days" series, as the
father, draws an older crowd and may win big among women over
25, an attractive target for advertisers.</p>
<p>SATURDAYS AT 10 P.M.</p>
<p>Forget about who killed Laura Palmer. The real mystery of
"Twin Peaks" is whether many viewers still care. Fans were
miffed when the seven-episode trial series ended last season
without solving the central mystery. Now, how long will it be
before mainstream America tires of the dare-to-be-quirky
techniques of David Lynch, the off-kilter film director who
co-created the series?</p>
<p>Saturday at 10 o'clock is the lowest-viewing hour of the
week, but ABC is betting that people are at home doing
something else. Last season "Twin Peaks" wowed America and
got lots of ink by taking a tired formula, the soap opera,
and adding a pinch of the bizarre. Long shots of a traffic
light swinging in the breeze; a young lady with an uncanny
talent involving her tongue and the stem of a cherry; and a
dreamy, dancing dwarf were among the elements that taxed
viewers' tolerance.</p>
<p>But programmers question whether the novelty can last as a
recurring weekly staple. "The show is important for a
network's signature in wanting to be different," says ABC's
Mr. Iger. "I didn't put it on Saturday to kill it. People are
watching their TV sets on Saturday night, but they're not
watching network television. We have to give them a reason
to."</p>
<p>"Twin Peaks," for all of its calculated loopiness, will go
up against some rather traditional rivals. CBS Inc.'s network
will air the sometimes-hot news show "48 Hours." NBC will
broadcast the comedy anthology "Carol & Co.," in which the
venerable Ms. Burnett plays a different role every week.</p>
<p>Warren Littlefield, president of NBC Entertainment, the
programming division of General Electric Co.'s National
Broadcasting Co. network, remains confident that NBC will
continue to win the night. "We feel we have the show viewers
want," he says. He also professes to be unconcerned that
millions of young viewers may tune to ABC to find out what
kind of pie will send FBI agent Dale Cooper swooning, or that
older viewers may turn to CBS to find out how its
correspondents spent two days and two nights.</p>
