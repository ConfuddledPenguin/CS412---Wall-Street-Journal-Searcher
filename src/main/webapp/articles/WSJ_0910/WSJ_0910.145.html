	<p class="article-leader">TOKYO -- Earnings of major Japanese corporations are
expected to fall 0.2% in the year ending March 31 from the
previous year, putting an end to a three-year stretch of
gains, a research institute attached to Sanyo Securities Co.
said.
   The think tank said its survey of 494 companies showed
that pretax earnings by all industries will drop as a result
of surging oil prices and interest rates. Sales are expected
to edge up 0.5%.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>When oil companies and electric power suppliers are
excluded, however, earnings will register a 3.2% gain, while
sales will remain flat, the Sanyo institute said. Oil and
electric power companies are expected to suffer most heavily
from the rising oil prices.</p>
<p>The research institute, citing the reasons for its guarded
earnings projections, expects oil prices to jump some 50% in
the second half of this fiscal year due to the intensifying
Mideast situation while the series of five increases in the
official discount rate since May last year will make their
combined impact felt. In addition, a slowdown in the U.S.
economy will serve to brake Japan's exports, it said.</p>
<p>Sanyo sees oil prices averaging $24.5 a barrel during this
fiscal year, up from an average $17.9 a barrel in fiscal
1990.</p>
<p>It forecast that manufacturer earnings will rise 3.8%,
slowing from double-digit gains in the three previous fiscal
years, while non-manufacturer profits will display a 7.7%
decline.</p>
<p>The shipbuilding, construction and service industries will
post pretax earnings gains of more than 10%, while the
machinery and auto industries will also fare well, it
predicted.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the paper-pulp and oil industries will
each register declines, of 18% and 13%, respectively, the
institute said.</p>
