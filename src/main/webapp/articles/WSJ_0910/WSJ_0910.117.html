	<p class="article-leader">MILWAUKEE -- Hiring plans by U.S. employers continue to
weaken, although they haven't yet fallen to pre-recession
levels of 1975 and 1980.
   The latest quarterly survey of 15,000 companies by
Manpower Inc. found that 23% plan to enlarge their work
forces in the fourth quarter, while 11% plan reductions.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The gap between the percentage of employers predicting
staff increases and those planning to decrease hiring
activity is the narrowest for any fourth quarter since 1981,
the employment-services concern said. That difference of 12
is well below the 18-point gap for the third quarter, when
26% of the employers anticipated hiring and 8% foresaw
reductions. The quarterly surveys aren't seasonally adjusted.</p>
<p>Prior to the 1982 recession, the gap -- which is used as a
yardstick of hiring expectations -- fell to 11 in the 1980
and 1981 fourth quarters. Manpower officials said the
yardstick was also lower than present in the 1975
pre-recession period.</p>
<p>The survey was conducted before the Middle East crisis
erupted, and Mitchell Fromstein, Manpower's president, noted
that activation of military reserve units could alter
employer hiring plans if workers remain on active duty for an
extended period. Activated reservists are guaranteed
immediate return to their jobs when released from active
duty.</p>
<p>The latest survey results were heavily influenced by the
economically troubled Northeast, where the gap between those
planning to hire and those planning reductions dropped to 5.
The Midwest continues to be very stable, the survey suggests,
with weakening trends emerging in the South and the West.</p>
<p>Among industries, wholesale and retail trades are the
strongest as they staff up for the Christmas holiday selling
season. Still, hiring plans in that sector don't quite reach
the usual level of activity, Manpower officials noted. The
education field continues to rebuild after years of reduced
job opportunity, and service concerns also have active hiring
plans.</p>
<p>In manufacturing, demand for workers is waning after two
years of strong hiring. While 21% of manufacturers see their
employment increasing, 10% expect to reduce job rolls. In
construction, for the first time in eight years, more
employers expect to decrease their work force than add to it.
And in the finance, insurance and real estate sector, only
14% plan further hiring while 11% are trimming their staffs.</p>
