	<p class="article-leader">The following is adapted from an article by Yossi Sarid, a
prominent member of the left-wing Ratz-CRM party in the
Israeli Knesset. The article was originally published in the
Israeli newspaper Haaretz on Aug. 17. Mr. Sarid has long
advocated dialogue with the Palestine Liberation Organization
and Ratz-CRM is generally considered to be the most
sympathetic of the Israeli political parties to the
Palestinian position. This article touched off an outpouring
of similar statements from the Israeli left doubting whether
compromise with Palestinians is possible.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>It has always been my position that two peoples have
rights to the land of Israel-Palestine, Jews and
Palestinians, and that the alternatives are therefore clear:
either compromise and partition or endless war. It has also
been my position that Israel's rule of law is undermined by
the occupation of the West Bank and Gaza and by the human
rights violations that occur there. I have in the past urged
Israel to negotiate with the PLO and I still believe that
some compromise peace must be arrived at with the Palestinian
people. But the endorsement of Iraq's invasion of Kuwait by
the PLO, by supposedly moderate Palestinians not affiliated
with the PLO and even by many of the Arabs who live inside
Israel and hold Israeli citizenship has put a knife in the
back of the peace process.</p>
<p>For years I have tried to explain to any Palestinian who
would listen that the Palestinian national movement must not
base its hopes on the Soviet Union. The leaders in the
Kremlin -- I said -- support the PLO today, but tomorrow, if
it is in their best interest, they will withdraw their
support. Only the Palestinians and Israel have any
substantial interest in a solution to the Palestinian
problem. Such a self-explanatory statement invariably met
with furious objection. Palestinians really seemed to believe
that the Soviet position would remain unchanged forever.</p>
<p>Now the Palestinians have found a new savior -- Saddam
Hussein. The Palestinian leaders, who have moved from one bed
to another (and there is no Arab leader who has not shared
his bed with them) have learned nothing. Would Saddam, who is
ready to sell his own mother, not sell them?</p>
<p>The PLO has dedicated the past two years to convincing
Israelis and others that it has changed, that it has
reconciled itself to the existence of the State of Israel and
has abandoned terrorism. The PLO has kicked that bucket over.</p>
<p>Saddam Hussein has already initiated two wars against his
neighbours. He who has gored a Moslem country as well as an
Arab country is an ox proven dangerous, who will most
certainly be willing to gore the Jewish State. The Israeli
Arabs must be aware of this imminent danger or they would not
demand to be supplied with gas masks for their defense. And
yet, polls suggest that 62% of these Arab Israeli citizens
support Saddam Hussein. Two Arab Knesset members, Abdul Wahab
Darawshe and Muhammed Miari, have publicly backed Saddam as
well. How can these people find a kind word to say about the
man who threatens to use chemical weapons against the country
in which they live -- and in which they claim to want to
continue to live? For the first time Mr. Darawsheh and Mr.
Miari have thrown doubt upon their loyalty to the state in
which they claim citizenship. They will pay for this mistake
dearly.</p>
<p>The Palestinian leadership, both inside and outside the
West Bank and Gaza, justify their support of Saddam Hussein
by citing the corruption of the Kuwait emirs who invested the
nation's capital in international businesses and not in the
"intifada". But Saddam has been no more generous to them: He
invested billions of dollars of his nation's capital in an
unnecessary war with Iran. He buried these billions together
with thousands of people. The Kuwait emirs may have been
rotten sovereigns, but if Yasser Arafat or Mr. Darawshe or
one of the moderate Palestinians who has expressed sympathy
for Saddam, like Faisal Husseini, had to choose a place to
live -- in rotten Kuwait or revolutionary Iraq -- I have no
doubt which they would choose. In Kuwait, at least, they
would not be constantly under the danger of execution.</p>
<p>Pan-Arab slogans that glorify revolutionary regimes that
treat human rights with contempt are immensly hypocritical.
When such slogans are used by local Palestinian leaders one
wonders to what extent they have internalized and assimilated
the democratic values of Israel.</p>
<p>If it is permissible to support Saddam Hussein -- who
murdered tens of thousands of "regime opponents" without
blinking an eyelid, who gassed Kurds, men, women and children
-- then it is perhaps not that bad to support the policy of
Mr. Shamir, Mr. Sharon and Mr. Rabin. In comparison with the
crimes committed by Saddam Hussein, the sins of the state of
Israel are snow white. When reading the black pages about
Iraq in Amnesty International's book on human rights in Iraq,
one can conclude that Messrs. Sharon and Rabin are almost
benevolent. Mr. Arafat, Mr. Husseini and Mr. Darawsheh must
not be surprised if the moral protest against the horrors
committed in the occupied territories becomes in the future a
faintly heard cry.</p>
<p>Had I supported the establishment of a Palestinian State
only because the Palestinians deserve a state I would now
withdraw that support. However, I continue to demand their
right for self-determination and an independent state because
it is my right to rid myself of the occupation and its evil
influence. The Palestinians perhaps deserve the occupation,
but we Israelis do not. But in my effort to free Israel from
the burden of occupying the West Bank, I do not need Messrs.
Arafat, Husseini and Darawsheh. Until now I have sought
outthe Palestinian leadership, because I believed this was
the only way to progress in the peace process. As far as I am
concerned, they can now look for me.</p>
