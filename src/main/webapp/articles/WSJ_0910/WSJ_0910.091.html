	<p class="article-leader">In rating the performances of Congressmen, the group
Environmental Action included a population-control vote,
which would have sent millions of dollars to a U.N. fund that
has programs in China, whose population policy of one child
per family includes forced abortions and sterilizations. When
criticized for including this volatile issue as a litmus test
in an environmental rating, Environmental Action replied that
it was important because, "the pressure of population growth
on the environment can undo all the progress we have made."</p>
