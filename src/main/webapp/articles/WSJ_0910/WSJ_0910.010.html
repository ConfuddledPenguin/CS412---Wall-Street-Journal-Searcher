	<p class="article-leader">BOSTON -- Nobody in the newspaper business has managed a
more fortuitous diversification than Affiliated Publications
Inc., publisher of the Boston Globe.
   It turned an $80 million investment in McCaw
Communications Inc., that began back in 1981 into a $2.6
billion bonanza for shareholders when it spun off its
holdings in the cellular company in May 1989.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>But now McCaw is gone and the Globe is mired in the
weakened New England economy. So Affiliated is trying to
diversify again. Through acquisitions, it is building a
specialty magazine subsidiary specializing in entertainment
and media. In July it added AdWeek, the No. 2 publication in
the advertising field to its BPI Communications Inc.
subsidiary, which also includes Billboard, the recording
industry bible, and Hollywood Reporter, a daily movie
newspaper.</p>
<p>Affiliated executives concede that specialty publishing
doesn't offer the once-in-a-lifetime returns of McCaw. But
Arthur Kingsbury, executive vice president, says the
magazines "will make us less dependent on the New England
economy, and entertainment happens to be a growing industry."</p>
<p>"Analysts have been impressed with Affiliated's management
and the (magazine) subsidiary," says J. Kendrick Noble, an
analyst with PaineWebber Inc. But the New England economy may
continue to decline and Mr. Noble expects Affiliated's
earnings from continuing operations to drop for the third
year in a row.</p>
<p>Last year, Affiliated reported profit from continuing
operations of $43.6 million or 63 cents a share, a 16%
decline from the prior year. Losses from the McCaw
investment, accounted for as discontinued operations, made
Affiliated's net income $16.4 million, or 23 cents a share.
Revenue for the year was $542.1 million, up 1.4% from the
previous year. Specialty publishing accounted for 20% of
revenue.</p>
<p>In the first half of this year, profit from continuing
operations fell 35% to $13.9 million, or 20 cents a share, on
a 1.3% revenue decline to $265.8 million.</p>
<p>Newspaper companies traditionally have been
acquisition-minded. "When they're doing well, they generate
so much money they have to buy something," says Cornelius
V.V. Sewell of Argus Research. "Newspapers don't grow a
helluva lot, and circulation doesn't grow at all." Newspapers
used to buy other newspapers but prices have been driven sky
high. Moving into other fields is risky, however, because
publishers' skills don't always help in other businesses.
"These days, nobody's diversifications are doing much on the
plus side," says Mr. Sewell.</p>
<p>Affiliated got into specialty publishing in 1987, selling
some radio stations and buying Billboard and a number of
smaller magazines for $100 million.</p>
<p>Gerald Hobbs, who remains as president of BPI
Communications, says Affiliated was an appealing acquirer
because its arms-length relationship with McCaw "indicated
their willingness to let us operate autonomously."</p>
<p>Magazine analysts say the AdWeek purchase looks like a
good deal. Industry sources say Affiliated paid $17 million
in cash and assumed about the same amount of debt for 80% of
the magazine. The company had been unprofitable because of
heavy interest costs incurred when one founder bought out his
two partners, but Mr. Kingsbury says it is profitable on an
operating basis.</p>
<p>Affiliated's expertise in circulation, advertising sales
and production meshes well with its magazines, Mr. Kingsbury
says. However, the magazines won't boost results immediately.
For one thing, the advertising slowdown that hurts the Globe
hurts publications like AdWeek as well.</p>
<p>For another, Affiliated is still investing in the unit. It
is building up an entertainment newswire which recycles
stories from Billboard, Hollywood Reporter and the Globe to
some 50 newspapers that subscribe to the service. That
service won't be profitable until 1991, Mr. Kingsbury says.</p>
<p>Affiliated's specialty group also is starting an
innovative computer service that can listen to radio stations
and pick out when and where particular records are played.
Mr. Kingsbury predicts the service will be purchased by
record companies trying to determine which stations are
playing their new releases to target their promotion dollars.
Later, the service can be expanded to monitor television for
advertisers seeking to audit the playing of their commercials
and to monitor competitors.</p>
<p>Mr. Kingsbury is noncommittal about further acquisitions
although he says, "we always have an ear to the ground."
However, he notes that following the AdWeek purchase
Affiliated has a record $150 million in debt. That leaves
Affiliated's debt at about 16% of its stock market
capitalization, still below the newspaper industry average of
21%.</p>
<p>In specialty publishing, as in most other fields, the
leading magazine is usually much more successful than
competitors and much more costly to buy. Affiliated is
betting that by putting together such No. 2 publications as
Hollywood Reporter and AdWeek, with Billboard, a No. 1 in its
field, it can create a top group. "Our coverage is adequate
to say we're the leading information provider in the
entertainment field," Mr. Kingsbury says.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, it will take substantial additional
acquisitions before specialty publications are large enough
to make up for the decline at the Globe.</p>
<p>New England's slump is clearly visible in the newspaper's
results. High-margin classified advertising has been
hammered, falling 17% in the second quarter, as helpwanted
advertising from the area's computer makers, defense firms
and financial services firms evaporated. Real estate ads are
down sharply as well, only partly offset by an increase in
ads from auctioneers for foreclosed properties. Overall
advertising lineage was down 10.4% in the second quarter.</p>
<p>Mr. Kingsbury says that despite the current advertising
problems, "I'm quite bullish on the Globe." Despite the
competition of News Corp.'s tabloid Boston Herald, the
Globe's daily circulation has edged up in each of the last
two years, rising to 521,932 in the period ended July 1.
Sunday circulation appears to have hit a plateau at 787,396,
but is increasingly profitable thanks to a price increase to
$1.50 from $1.25.</p>
<p>And with many of the once fast-growing suburban papers
forced to retrench recently, Mr. Kingsbury says: "When this
market turns around, we'll be stronger going out than when we
came in." The Globe has now created five zoned editions with
regional stories and lower advertising rates to attract local
grocers and other advertisers who couldn't previously afford
the Globe.</p>
<p>As a newspaper, some critics charge that the Globe has
lost its luster. Once routinely ranked as one of the nation's
top five newspapers, the Globe now may have slipped out of
the top 10, says Mark Jurkowitz, media critic for the weekly
Boston Phoenix. "In terms of national reputation, they're
waning," he says.</p>
<p>The Globe has been shut out in recent Pulitzer Prize
awards after winning seven from 1980 to 1985. It was widely
criticized for perceived boosterism of Gov. Michael Dukakis's
presidential campaign. And the Globe, along with the rest of
the Boston media and law enforcement, was fooled in the case
in which Charles Stuart shot his wife and claimed she was the
victim of a black mugger. Mr. Jurkowitz says Globe editors
are worried about how the paper will be portrayed in a coming
TV movie of the event. A writer from the rival Herald is
working as a consultant on the movie.</p>
<p>However, the Globe remains the biggest, most influential
and best paper in New England. When the economy turns, it can
return to being one of the most profitable newspapers in the
country. "With luck that will be 1991, but there are those
who say 1992," says Mr. Kingsbury. "At this point there's no
point to being anything but cautious."</p>
