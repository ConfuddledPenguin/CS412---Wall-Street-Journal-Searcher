	<p class="article-leader">Heineken N.V. combined higher volumes of beer sales and
higher prices to put the fizz back in its profit, which
surged 18% in the first half.
   The rise to 165.4 million guilders ($94.3 million) in the
first half from 140.3 million guilders a year earlier
surprised Dutch analysts who had predicted a rate of earnings
growth of between 5% and 10% for the Amsterdam-based beer
concern.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>On a per-share basis, profit was 5.15 guilders, up from
the year-earlier 4.37 guilders. Analysts had expected around
4.6 guilders.</p>
<p>The brewer said it expects second-half earnings to at
least match those of the year-earlier's 185.2 million
guilders. Although the forecast was conservative, analysts
noted Heineken has a tradition of understating its
performance.</p>
<p>Sales increased by 7.5% to 4.15 billion guilders from 3.86
billion guilders.</p>
<p>Heineken, which announced its results after the close of
trading Friday, closed at 114.7 guilders, up 0.9 guilder in a
generally stronger market.</p>
