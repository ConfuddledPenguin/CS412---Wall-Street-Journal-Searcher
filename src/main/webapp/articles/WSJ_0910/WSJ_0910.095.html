	<p class="article-leader">Gevaert N.V. said group net profit rose 31% to 1.1 billion
Belgian francs ($34.4 million) in the first half, up from 842
million francs a year earlier.
   The Belgian company said operating profit grew 25% to 1.04
billion francs. Gevaert also said it expects consolidated
earnings for the year to exceed 1.7 billion francs. However,
the company warned that "the evolution of stock exchange
prices since June 30, 1990, does not allow . . . to put
forward a final figure."</p>
