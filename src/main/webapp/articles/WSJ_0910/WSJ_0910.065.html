	<p class="article-leader">After years of invading small towns and squeezing out
scores of mom-and-pop merchants, Wal-Mart Stores Inc. may
have finally met its match in its own back yard: Scarlett
Rabalais, who runs a bunch of hot dog stands in Texas.
   Last month, Sam's Wholesale Club, a Wal-Mart unit, ordered
Ms. Rabalais's Hot Diggity Dogs company to remove its 21
hot-dog stands from outside Sam's stores, where for four
years they had operated with the blessing of the Wal-Mart
unit, which got a 10% cut of sales. In the eviction notice,
Sam's officials said the company intended to sell its own hot
dogs, as it already does at stores outside Texas. They did
offer to relieve Ms. Rabalais of her stands, at a price
"based on fair market value."</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>What the company didn't offer was any promise to hire Ms.
Rabalais's 90 workers -- most of whom are elderly or
disabled. Ms. Rabalais, who says she started Hot Diggity Dogs
to provide employment for such people, argued for the
preservation of their jobs. But she contends that her pleas
went unheeded -- until, according to Ms. Rabalais, Sam's own
customers started tipping off Texas newspapers to the story.</p>
<p>After newspapers in Dallas and Houston published articles
about giant Wal-Mart evicting tiny Hot Diggity Dogs and its
work force, company officials suddenly became eager to "work
out the problem," Ms. Rabalais says. They even invited her to
meet with them tomorrow at company headquarters in
Bentonville, Ark.</p>
<p>Ms. Rabalais says she can't discuss the agenda for
tomorrow's meeting. The reason: Company officials,
embarrassed by the publicity, "asked me not to talk with the
media anymore," she says. "And I promised."</p>
<p>In Bentonville, a Sam's spokeswoman says the discount
marketer has gotten a bad rap. The company promised all along
to interview Ms. Rabalais's workers, she says, and now it is
prepared to guarantee jobs to them, assuming they pass drug
tests and dress-code standards. "The elderly and handicapped
fit into our corporate culture," she says, adding that Sam's
could provide employee benefits not offered by Hot Diggity
Dogs.</p>
<p>And with a unit of Wal-Mart, the so-called low-price king,
running the stands, customers would benefit as well, she
contends. "We could probably offer a lower-cost hot dog," she
says.</p>
