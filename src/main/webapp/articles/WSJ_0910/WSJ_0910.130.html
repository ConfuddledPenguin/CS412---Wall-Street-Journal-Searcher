	<p class="article-leader">LITTLE ROCK, Ark. -- TCBY Enterprises Inc. said its board
more than tripled the quarterly dividend to 10 cents a share
from three cents, payable Sept. 25 to stock of record Sept.
19.
   TCBY, a franchiser of retail stores that sell frozen
yogurt, didn't give a reason for the increase, and company
officials couldn't be reached for comment.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>TCBY's stock price has fallen sharply in recent weeks,
following news of declines in sales for stores open at least
a year and a disclosure by the company that it expects to
report that net income for the third quarter ended Aug. 31
fell to between 25 and 30 cents a share from 43 cents in the
year-earlier period.</p>
<p>In New York Stock Exchange composite trading Friday,
before the dividend news was released, TCBY shares closed at
$6.375, down 12.5 cents.</p>
