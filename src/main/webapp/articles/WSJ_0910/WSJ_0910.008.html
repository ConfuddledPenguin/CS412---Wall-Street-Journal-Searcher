	<p class="article-leader">TORRANCE, Calif. -- Toyota Motor Corp. plans to build a
second car-assembly plant in the U.S., and will announce the
site in the next 30 to 60 days.
   The move comes as Japan's auto makers, thanks to their
eight existing "transplants" in the U.S., are making gains in
the American auto market that Detroit's Big Three
manufacturers didn't imagine possible just a few years ago.
Japanese auto makers took a 34% share of U.S. car sales last
month, a record for the group. That exceeded the market share
of industry leader General Motors Corp.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Including cars sold by the Big Three that were made in
Japanese-owned or managed plants, the Japanese built 39% of
the autos sold in the U.S. in August.</p>
<p>So far this year Japan's auto makers have nearly 30% of
the U.S. car market, up from about 25% in the first eight
months of last year. Toyota itself has been especially
strong. Its market share in the U.S. has surged to 9.2% so
far this year, up from about 6.8% a year ago.</p>
<p>Toyota's new car-assembly plant might be built adjacent to
its existing factory in Georgetown, Ky., said James Olson,
vice president of external affairs for the company's U.S.
marketing arm. But he said several other sites also are being
considered. All are within easy reach of the corps of
auto-parts suppliers located along the Interstate 75 corridor
between Detroit and Nashville, Tenn.</p>
<p>It isn't clear what car model or models Toyota will build
at the plant, which could be open within two years of the
announcement. Toyota builds the compact Camry model at its
Kentucky plant and some Corolla subcompacts at its
joint-venture factory with GM in Fremont, Calif. In addition,
Toyota is putting a truck-assembly line in the Fremont
factory that will build 100,000 compact pickups a year
beginning next July. Toyota also has an assembly plant in
Canada.</p>
<p>While Toyota hasn't previously acknowledged its intention
to build another U.S. assembly plant, it has hinted at the
possibility. Toyota officials had said they want to boost
U.S. sales to about 1.5 million cars and trucks a year by
1995, up from the current 950,000, and to build about half of
those vehicles in the U.S. and Canada. Those goals implied
that another plant would be necessary.</p>
<p>Japanese auto makers started building plants in the U.S.
in the early 1980s because of governmental restrictions on
exports of their cars to the American market. Big Three
executives welcomed the move -- in fact, they actively
demanded it -- because they figured such plants would provide
a "level playing field" and end the Japanese advantage in
production costs. But now, Big Three executives concede that
the Japanese transplants have a cost advantage of about $600
a car.</p>
<p>"What we really have is tremendous competition from the
transplants," said Chrysler Corp. Chairman Lee A. Iacocca in
a recent interview. "I don't have a perfect answer for that,
okay?" Indeed, Chrysler has closed three U.S. assembly
plants, one-third of its total, in the past two years.</p>
<p>Other Japanese car companies also are boosting their U.S.
production capacity.</p>
<p>Nissan Motor Co., for example, is greatly expanding the
size of its production facilities in Smyrna, Tenn. Honda
Motor Co. opened its second U.S. assembly plant last fall,
and is gradually accelerating toward two-shift production
there. In all, Japanese auto makers will be able to build
about three million vehicles in the U.S. and Canada by 1995.</p>
<p>This rapid expansion isn't without risks, however. Many
auto-industry officials, including some Japanese executives,
believe that not all the transplants will prosper. One they
cite as potentially vulnerable is the Indiana joint-venture
plant owned by Fuji Heavy Industries and Isuzu Motor Co. Both
companies have suffered from sluggish sales in the U.S. And
because the factory builds a car for Fuji's Subaru subsidiary
and a truck for Isuzu, its abilities to achieve economies of
scale are limited.</p>
