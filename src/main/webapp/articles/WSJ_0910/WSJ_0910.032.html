	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- A Fort Worth, Texas, securities firm agreed to
be expelled from the National Association of Securities
Dealers for what the agency charged was excessive and
unsuitable trading, causing a more than $750,000 loss in an
institutional account.
   Vautrain Nelson Lefevre, Endsley & Durham Inc. didn't
admit or deny wrongdoing in also agreeing to a $25,000 fine
and settling the charges. Lynn D. Vautrain, a Fort Worth
principal at the firm, agreed to a $10,000 fine and two-week
suspension without admitting or denying the charges.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>From about May 31 to July 19, 1988, the NASD charged, the
firm executed about 124 trades in the account of State Bank
of St. Libory of St. Libory, Ill. The trades generated the

<p>Except as noted below, the individuals involved in the
NASD proceedings couldn't be reached for comment.</p>
<p>Mr. Vautrain said, "Due to the activities of one account
executive engaged as an independent contractor in Little
Rock, Ark., it was determined by the NASD that he wasn't
properly supervised. The only allegation against myself was a
failure to properly supervise the account executive."</p>
<p>Mr. Cameron said that a customer asked him, as a personal
favor, to write a letter saying that the customer had
invested $5,000 in certificates of deposit, though the money
hadn't actually been invested. Mr. Cameron said he didn't
earn "a single dime" in the matter.</p>
<p>Mr. Fried said the NASD "came to their judgment, came to
their conclusions. With the proper amount of money to defend
my position, they could have been reversed." He said that
taking into consideration that he has had "35 years of an
unblemished career on the Street" and that the matter
occurred at "a time of high stress, I think there were
mitigating circumstances."</p>
<p>Fundamental, Hugo Marx & Co. and Shearson declined
comment.</p>
<p>Messrs. Amburn and Standard also had no comment.</p>
