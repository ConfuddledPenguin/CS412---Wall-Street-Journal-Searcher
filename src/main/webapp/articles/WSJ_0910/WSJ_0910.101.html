	<p class="article-leader">What television writers think of as the important problems
of our time is always worth noting, especially since the
important problems of our times and those television
identifies as such frequently don't have much in common.
Still, sometimes they do, particularly now that prime time is
dabbling in stuff best described as the new realism.
   Take NBC's ambitious new series, "Law & Order," the first
segment of which (airing Thursday, 10-11 p.m. EDT) admittedly
doesn't have a lot to get real about. Its subject is how the
majesty of the law and the wit and wisdom of our police
cooperate to defeat a criminal doctor, the chief of medicine
no less, of one of New York's most distinguished hospitals.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The doctor, it appears, is a dipsomaniac who has been
killing patients by misprescribing medication. Next week's
installment concerns a young ballerina turned subway
vigilante. A person could get the impression from this lineup
that it is our killer professional class -- middle-class
cardiologists and ballerinas and such -- who are out there
committing the mayhem keeping our court system busy.</p>
<p>How did these plot lines hatch, one sometimes wonders when
watching TV? From what seed did this life spring? Much of the
time such questions are doomed to remain among life's
imponderable mysteries, but in the case of these two segments
of "Law & Order" the answer is clear, despite disclaimers in
the credits informing us that any resemblance to real persons
is purely coincidental. To say this is to give the word
coincidental a new meaning.</p>
<p>For those who recall the notorious death of Libby Zion,
daughter of the New York journalist Sidney Zion, which
occurred shortly after she entered one of New York's most
prestigious hospitals to be treated for a fever, episode one
should ring a coincidental bell. That death, it was charged,
was caused by the negligence of attending doctors, who
administered medicine that was contraindicated. Entitled
"Prescription for Death," Thursday's "Law & Order" segment
follows the lines of this tragedy closely before switching
focus to the fiction about the hushed-up crimes of the
hospital's nationally renowned cardiologist, a role Paul
Sparer plays with crusty panache. Maybe it just seems that
way, but this could be the first time in ages that prime time
has portrayed a case of alcoholism in such purely
condemnatory terms. There is no enlightening talk here about
the disease of addiction, no talk of rehabilitation, no Betty
Ford clinics in this doctor's future.</p>
<p>The inspiration for next week's episode will need no
explaining, it being obvious from the first seconds that
Bernhard Goetz has been reborn for television in the person
of a woman. A lean and spare blonde like the original, this
incarnation of Goetz is, also like the original, a victim of
an earlier mugging who is determined never to be a victim
again. When two black teenagers crowd threateningly up
against her in the subway, carrying, some say, a screwdriver,
the ballerina plugs them with her unlicensed gun. Much of
what happens next will be familiar. One of the toughs she
hits is paralyzed from the waist down.</p>
<p>Its weaknesses aside -- which include overdrawn
characterizations and dialogue bearing no resemblance to
human discourse -- "Law & Order" has the makings of an
intelligent hit. It has pace and it has polish, and as these
things go, a stellar cast. There is, for example, Steven
Hill, in the role of Manhattan's district attorney. He is one
of our better character actors, and one invariably splendid
at conveying the fatigued, slightly corrupt intelligence of
seasoned top officials. Set in a New York City police
precinct, the program expends its first half-hour on the
apprehension of the criminal, the second on the way the
courts deal with the case. Its flaws -- writers' flaws and
point-of-view flaws -- are obvious in this script that flits
from viewpoint to viewpoint, that gives voice to all
arguments equally. In television, this sort of to-ing and
fro-ing often parades itself as complexity, and in this "Law
& Order" is no exception.</p>
<p>We also get to see a lot of two extremely loquacious
detectives, who spend their days sharing moral precepts and
analyses of the system, in an endless rat-a-tat-tat of neatly
polished epigrams. The same holds for the character of the
earnest assistant district attorney (Michael Moriarty), a
well nigh unbearable prig, who argues the cases in court. Not
for nothing does the lawyer for the female Goetz accuse him
of "Jesuitical casuistry," a term, it is safe to say, that
doesn't get a lot of use on prime-time series, or, for that
matter, in the courtrooms of New York City. The particularly
interesting thing about this series, at least so far, is the
evidence of an effort to grapple with uncomfortable facts.
When a prime-time series begins, as this one does, to push
and prod at issues like white fears and black crime, in ways
that would have been unthinkable say, 15 years ago, the
quality of the prodding seems -- almost -- beside the point.
As Dr. Johnson once said about women preaching (in the days
when it was still possible for a sexist to utter benighted
comments without getting his skull crushed), the wonder is
not that they do it well but that they do it at all.</p>
<p>The subway episode in fact makes no bones about the fears
that white and black citizens alike feel, when confronted by
a gang of black teenagers in a subway or street. Television
has come a long way, evidently, from the '70s, when Norman
Lear's way of dealing with such issues was to construct a
story line in which two black criminals break into Archie
Bunker's house. Whereupon they are revealed to be models of
wit and cerebration, gallant and kindly to Edith -- your
typical urban mugger in short, in every way morally superior
to Archie, particularly, the script let us know, because
Archie kept a gun in the house.</p>
<p>To be sure, "Law & Order" does take pains to underline the
dangers of guns, though the assistant district attorney's
passionate plea that the courts not encourage people to arm
themselves against crime lest we have a new Dodge City, is an
argument that does not air at the most opportune of times,
considering the number and brutality of the crimes armed
criminals have visited on unarmed innocent citizens. Still,
"Law & Order" in most other ways puts its finger on the issue
burning in the public gut, the issue that is just what the
title says it is.</p>
