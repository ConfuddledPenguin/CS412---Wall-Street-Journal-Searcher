	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- In three days of budget talks, Democrats
proposed sharply higher income-tax rates for upper-income
Americans and new levies on energy consumption and luxury
goods, while Republicans proposed an even bigger
capital-gains tax cut than President Bush.
   The closed-door talks continued into the evening yesterday
in a converted bar in the officers' club at Andrews Air Force
Base near here. Budget negotiators, who are hoping to reach
agreement by tomorrow, are scheduled to meet with President
Bush for two hours this morning. Bush administration and
congressional aides said progress toward a deficit-reduction
compromise has been excruciatingly slow.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>In opening rounds, the two sides clearly staked out
contrasting positions. Democrats, determined to hit the
wealthy hard, called for increasing the top nominal
income-tax rate to 35% from the current 28%, and for an
additional 10% surcharge on taxpayers earning more than
$500,000 a year.</p>
<p>Republicans continued to resist any increases in
income-tax rates and proposed cutting to 15% the
capital-gains tax rate, now a maximum of 33%. In January,
President Bush proposed cutting the rate to 19.6% over three
years.</p>
<p>In a spirited debate yesterday, participants said House
Majority Leader Richard Gephardt of Missouri argued strongly
that any cut in capital-gains taxes would have to be paired
with higher income-tax rates. White House Budget Director
Richard Darman, Sen. Bob Packwood (R., Ore.) and Sen. Phil
Gramm (R., Texas) insisted no income-tax rate increases would
be acceptable to Republicans.</p>
<p>"This is like a basketball game," White House Chief of
Staff John Sununu said yesterday on ABC News's "This Week
with David Brinkley." "It almost all happens in the last two
minutes. Oct. 1 is when the clock goes off." Under the
Gramm-Rudman deficit-reduction law, deep across-the-board
spending cuts will be triggered Oct. 1 unless there is a
deficit-reduction accord.</p>
<p>Although the two sides were inching closer on some issues,
the two sides remained billions of dollars apart on how
deeply to cut the defense budget and continued to disagree on
domestic spending. Democrats infuriated some Republicans with
an initial proposal to increase spending on various domestic
programs, including education and parks, by more than $70
billion over the next five years, aides said.</p>
<p>In one hopeful sign, however, congressional aides said
negotiators yesterday were approaching a consensus to pare
projected spending on federal benefit programs, such as
Medicare and government employee pensions, by between $10
billion and $11 billion.</p>
<p>What's more, both sides now favor expanded tax breaks for
child-care expenses, with the Republicans proposing a more
modest plan. Both sides proposed higher taxes on alcoholic
beverages. And both sides are shunning any increase in
tobacco taxes, apparently figuring the political fight with
tobacco-state legislators isn't worth the revenue.</p>
<p>Both Republicans and Democrats would substantially
increase taxes on life insurance companies and extend the 3%
tax on long-distance telephone calls.</p>
<p>In addition to raising the income-tax rate and imposing
the new surcharge, Democrats also proposed raising the
alternative minimum tax for individuals -- paid by
upper-income individuals who would otherwise avoid taxes
under the regular tax system -- to 26% from the current 21%.
These three proposals alone would raise $9.2 billion in
fiscal 1991 and $97.8 billion over five years, a summary
prepared by Democrats shows. The Democratic proposal also
would extend the 1.45% payroll tax for Medicare to cover
wages above the current earnings limit of $50,400.</p>
<p>Congressional aides said the Democrats also suggested
increasing the top corporate income tax rate to 35% from the
current 34%, although that wasn't included in the Democrats'
initial written proposal.</p>
<p>The Democratic energy tax proposals include a seven-cent
increase in the nine-cent-a gallon federal gasoline tax and
an oil-import fee that would be triggered only when the price
of oil falls below $20 a barrel, with all the oil-import
revenue devoted to assistance to low-income Americans. The
package also includes a new tax on all energy sources that
would begin at 2% but double to 4% in the second year.</p>
<p>GOP staffers said the Republicans also are contemplating
energy taxes, although they apparently haven't been formally
put on the table. The popularity of energy taxes is something
of a surprise because the Persian Gulf crisis already has
pushed up oil prices sharply, but the negotiators apparently
decided that the public believes the crisis offers strong,
new reasons to encourage conservation. Both sides are
proposing tax incentives for oil and gas drillers.</p>
<p>As expected, the Republicans proposed to limit taxpayers'
deductions for income tax payments to state and local
governments to $10,000 a year. This is their major
alternative to the rate increases suggested by the Democrats.</p>
<p>Among revenue-losing provisions, Republicans would extend
a variety of soon-to-expire tax breaks, including those that
subsidize corporate research and help the self-employed
purchase health insurance. They also would expand tax breaks
for individual retirement accounts. The Democrats have a
similar plan for IRAs.</p>
<p>For the benefit of poor people, Democrats would sweeten
the refundable earned income tax credit and slightly raise
the standard deduction taken by taxpayers who don't itemize.</p>
<p>Democrats suggested a new tax on luxury goods of 10% of
the purchase price in excess of $25,000 for autos, $1,000 for
electronics, $5,000 for jewelry and $500 for furs.
Republicans were said by aides to be contemplating a 5% levy
on luxury goods.</p>
<p>On alcoholic beverages, the Democrats would raise $9.1
billion over five years by doubling the federal tax on beer
and wine. The tax is currently at 16 cents on a sixpack of
beer and three cents a bottle on wine. For reasons that
weren't immediately clear, the Democrats' initial proposal
excluded sparkling wine. They also proposed increasing the
tax on distilled spirits to $14.50 per "proof gallon" of
alcohol from the current $12.50 a gallon.</p>
<p>The Republicans opening bid would raise $22.8 billion over
five years by raising taxes on beer and wine, but not hard
liquor.</p>
<p>Both Republicans and Democrats have presented plans that
they say would cut the deficit by about $50 billion in fiscal
1991, which begins Oct. 1, and by $500 billion over the next
five years. But both sides rely on deficit-reduction measures
that the other side says are ephemeral. The Democrats, for
instance, figure on raising $1.5 billion in the first year
and $9.2 billion over five years from intensified government
debt-collection efforts.</p>
<p>Even if negotiators agree to cut the projected fiscal 1991
deficit by $50 billion, they would be nearly $100 billion
away from the $64 billion deficit target in the Gramm-Rudman
law, according to White House budget office estimates. Aides
also concede that to reach a compromise, negotiators may be
forced to trim the first-year package to substantially less
than $50 billion. In any event, all sides have agreed that
any deficit accord would have to include a change in the
Gramm-Rudman deficit target.</p>
