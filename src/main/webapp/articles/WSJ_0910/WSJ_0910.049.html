	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- In recent years, the New York newspaper wars
have resembled trench warfare: tough talk, a few big bangs,
but little movement.
   Now a battered New York economy may turn up a casualty or
two, something that years of competition couldn't. In
jeopardy is the future of one of the city's most brassy
combatants, the 189-year-old tabloid New York Post. Moreover,
uptown at the Daily News, management is haunted by labor
union troubles that could cripple the paper. It has become
plausible that, in the end, New York could be left with just
two newspapers, the New York Times and New York Newsday.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>At the Post, labor unions are scrambling to find $17
million in concessions for real estate mogul and owner Peter
Kalikow. But a broader question remains: Can any paper in New
York, besides the Times, make money?</p>
<p>Through the 1980s, most major metropolitan daily
newspapers were able to raise advertising rates at will, and
maintained operating profit margins of 15% to 20%. Despite
the national slump in newspaper ads in the past two years,
chains such as Knight-Ridder Inc. have largely maintained
those margins. But profits have become a rarity for New York
papers.</p>
<p>The Post wasn't profitable even in the boom years of the
1980s, when it was owned by Rupert Murdoch. At Tribune Co.'s
Daily News, which had sporadic profit in the '80s, falling ad
linage and burdensome union contracts have contributed to
losses expected to swell as large as $45 million this year.</p>
<p>Times Mirror Co.'s six-year-old New York Newsday is
estimated to be losing at least $10 million annually as it
fights to take hold in New York (though Newsday on Long
Island, from which it was spun off, remains profitable). Even
at the New York Times, big drops in ad linage are squeezing
the paper's profit margin.</p>
<p>The ad problems are amplified by the papers' labor costs,
the highest in the country. "The cost side is half the
problem," says Edward Atorino, newspaper analyst for Salomon
Brothers Inc. "The other half is declining ad dollars. It's
almost a no-win proposition for the papers. Things wouldn't
improve that much if the Post were out."</p>
<p>New York may not be the same without the sassy Post, but
there's no denying its dire straits. Mr. Kalikow said last
week that he will fold the paper this Saturday unless its
unions come up with as much as $17 million in "temporary"
savings. Mr. Kalikow, who bought the paper in 1988, is
looking for reductions in payroll and employee benefits and
price breaks from suppliers.</p>
<p>Richard T. Nasti, general manager of the Post, says the
paper already has negotiated "meaningful reductions" in
prices with paper suppliers and is renegotiating contracts
with other suppliers. "If the unions want this to succeed, we
have to close a $27 million gap," Mr. Nasti says.</p>
<p>The Post's most meaningful savings may have been at least
partly symbolic. Two weeks ago, Mr. Kalikow pushed for, and
got, the resignation of Valerie B. Salembier, the Post's
high-priced president. Well regarded in publishing circles,
Ms. Salembier had salary and benefits estimated at $500,000.</p>
<p>Industry analysts and other publishers are betting that
the unions will make concessions and the Post won't fold. But
they say Mr. Kalikow is putting off the inevitable. Because
of the Post's losses over the years -- $80 million so far
under Mr. Kalikow and about $150 million under Mr. Murdoch --
it's unlikely that anyone else would be interested in buying
the paper.</p>
<p>In Mr. Kalikow's favor is his reputation of working with
the unions in a "candid and open" fashion, according to union
leaders. "We aren't asking for a broad management-rights
clause" that would undermine the unions' authority, says the
Post's Mr. Nasti. "We aren't blaming the unions for our
problems."</p>
<p>That's a far cry from the situation at the Daily News,
where contract negotiations have turned nasty. Begun in
January, the talks are largely stalled now. Whatever the Post
is able to achieve with its unions is unlikely to affect the
Daily News's bargaining position.</p>
<p>John Sloan, Daily News vice president, says the Post wants
only "cosmetic relief and a temporary life-support solution."
The Daily News clearly wants more, though management denies
it is trying to break the unions. "We are seeking to address
the fundamental problems," Mr. Sloan says. "We want to regain
management control of our business, such as in hiring, and
eliminate rampant labor abuses in our contracts."</p>
<p>The tough talks have led the unions, which represent about
3,000 News workers, to hold a loud rally outside the Gramercy
Park home of Daily News publisher James Hoge and to issue
bumper stickers that read "The Daily News is bad news for its
workers. Stop the Hog(e)]" Last week, the unions began asking
major advertisers to boycott the Daily News until progress is
made on the contract.</p>
<p>"Kalikow is willing to listen and negotiate," says Barry
Lipton, president of the New York Newspaper Guild. "The Daily
News is trying to force a strike. They are trying to mug us."
In case of a strike, the Daily News has a replacement force
standing by to put out the paper.</p>
<p>Should the Post fold, and the Daily News have to revert to
a replacement work force, New York Newsday could be in a
position to capitalize on its several advantages. Its parent,
Times Mirror, is profitable and patient. It is the only
newspaper in New York that can print color daily (the Daily
News promises to build a color printing plant, and the New
York Times has yet to break ground on one for its daily
editions). Newsday is slowly winning over more upscale
advertisers. And, more significantly, it has labor peace.</p>
<p>To this point, however, New York Newsday has been a labor
of love for Times Mirror. Circulation has climbed gradually
to 225,000 after six years, even though its 25-cent cover
price -- the lowest in town -- was expected to bring faster
growth. In part, the paper still is perceived as a Long
Island newspaper. Also, it has no history in the city and is
competing against three entrenched rivals.</p>
<p>Newsday acquired cachet by stealing star columnist Jimmy
Breslin from the Daily News, but he costs a princely $400,000
a year, according to insiders. Expensive promotion drives in
Manhattan and Brooklyn and its bargain newsstand price also
have cost Newsday dearly.</p>
<p>Analysts estimate that New York Newsday is losing $10
million to $15 million a year. Robert Johnson, publisher,
says those estimates overstate the losses, though he declines
to be more specific. He says New York Newsday should become
profitable in three to four years, or sooner if either the
Daily News or Post folds.</p>
<p>For New Yorkers, losing the Post's gossipy Page Six would
be like losing an institution. For advertisers, fewer
newspapers would mean less competition and higher ad rates.</p>
<p>"If we end up with just Newsday and the Times, both papers
will be more ambitious in raising prices because of the lack
of competitors," says Robert Hutchinson, an advertising
executive at Manufacturers Hanover Trust Co. in New York.
"Professionally, we could easily replace the Post with other
local media, but personally I would hate to see it happen."</p>
