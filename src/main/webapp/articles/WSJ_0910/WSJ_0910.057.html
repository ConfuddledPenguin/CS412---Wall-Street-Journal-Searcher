	<p class="article-leader">Oracle Systems Corp. President Lawrence Ellison, once
caught speeding in his red Ferrari three days in a row,
apparently has been driving his own company too fast as well.
   Oracle said it would report 30% revenue growth for its
fiscal first quarter ended Aug. 31, but added that
"unfortunately" the Redwood City, Calif., company had built
up its operations in expectation of 50% growth. As a result,
expenses outpaced revenue, causing a quarterly loss of about
20 cents a share, the first in the computer software
company's 13-year history. With about 137 million shares
outstanding, that would translate to a loss of $27.4 million.
Oracle officials said final results for the quarter will be
announced Sept. 25.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Following Oracle's disclosure of its woes late Thursday,
the company's stock slipped Friday in national
over-the-counter trading, dropping $1.75 a share to close at
$8.125 a share, with nearly 10 million shares changing hands.
The stock has tumbled 71% from its peak in March of $28.375,
losing about $2.77 billion of market value in the process.</p>
<p>In a move that analysts said was tied to the quarterly
loss, Oracle last week replaced Gary D. Kennedy as head of
its Oracle USA unit. Michael S. Fields, vice-president, U.S.
field sales and consulting, was promoted to president of
Oracle USA, while Mr. Kennedy retains his title as head of
another Oracle subsidiary.</p>
<p>All this is a shock for the one-time darling of Wall
Street. Oracle had exploded from $23 million in sales in 1984
to nearly $1 billion in fiscal 1990, with earnings routinely
growing in excess of 100% a fiscal year. The company's growth
resulted from its position as the only software company to
offer data base products, crucial for corporate
record-keeping, that work on all kinds of computers, ranging
from mainframes to personal computers.</p>
<p>Oracle said Thursday it was reducing its revenue growth
rate goal for the current fiscal year to 30% from 50%.</p>
<p>Analysts reacted to the ugly surprise by changing their
"buy" recommendation for Oracle stock to "hold" and even
"avoid." Most analysts had expected Oracle would at worst
post earnings about flat with the $11.6 million, or $0.09 per
share, earned in the year-ago first quarter. The loss also
seemed to contradict Oracle's earlier statements that
disappointing third-quarter earnings for fiscal 1990 reported
last March were an anomaly, reflecting only an accounting
glitch.</p>
<p>Instead, analysts agreed, the loss indicates that Oracle's
growth-at-any-cost strategy has come back to bite the
company. Analysts say a zealous sales force has made promises
to customers -- such as features in forthcoming products --
that Oracle later couldn't keep.</p>
<p>It also appears Mr. Ellison didn't accurately gauge a
general slowdown in the software market that began last
February. Despite the disappointing third quarter, which
produced flat earnings for his company, Mr. Ellison directed
Oracle to continue with an ambitious sales program based on
the forecast for revenue growth of 50%. Oracle had begun to
put the brakes on expenses in the fourth quarter, "but not
quite fast enough to achieve earnings targets," according to
a July 13 report by Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette.</p>
<p>Oracle also hurt itself by implementing a controversial
new strategy whereby salespeople would receive only one-half
their sales commission up front rather than the full
commission they used to receive up front, said Thomas A.
Galvin, a New York analyst for Smith Barney.</p>
<p>"That had a disruptive influence on the sales organization
that has contributed to lower revenues," Mr. Galvin said.</p>
<p>Besides the sales snafus, Oracle also has faced continuing
accounting problems. Last month, for instance, the company
restated its financial results for the last three quarters of
its fiscal year ended May 31. However, the restatement didn't
result in changes in the company's net income or revenue for
the year.</p>
<p>To help regain its financial footing, analysts said Oracle
will have to make a number of adjustments, including probable
layoffs in the sales force. Most importantly, Mr. Galvin
suggested, Oracle needs to adjust its high-growth philosophy
to one more in tune with the current market.</p>
<p>"If they can make their way through the next two
quarters," Mr. Galvin said, "the demand for relational data
base products should be healthy enough over the next two to
three years that Oracle should be able to prosper at a 15% to
20% rate of growth."</p>
<p>Said Kenneth Burke, an analyst at Alex. Brown in San
Francisco: "They are going through an awkward adolescence."</p>
<p>Oracle officials declined comment beyond a prepared
statement from Mr. Ellison, who said: "We continue to grow
faster than our competition and increase our share in all
four software market segments -- mainframe, minicomputer,
workstation and {personal computers}. As we adjust to a more
conventional growth rate, our company will be stronger than
ever."</p>
<p>Oracle is the largest marketer of relational data base
software, and ranks a close third, behind Microsoft Corp., in
terms of overall software sales.</p>
<p>Competitors of Oracle, who might be inclined to crow about
their rival's bad fortune given their widespread dislike of
the intense Mr. Ellison, were unusually somber.</p>
<p>"You don't want to see anyone in database hurting because
we're all in the same boat," explained an executive at a
competing company, who didn't want to be identified.</p>
