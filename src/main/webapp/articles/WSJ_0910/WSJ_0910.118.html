	<p class="article-leader">Ford Motor Co., Detroit, said the Atlanta assembly plant
that builds the Ford Taurus and Mercury Sable and the Lorain,
Ohio, plant that builds the Econoline Wagon will shut for a
week each because of slow sales.
   The Atlanta facility has been down a total of four weeks
so far this year. The latest production cut comes at a time
when Ford's dealer-inventory levels of the cars are
relatively low. At July 31, there was a 63-day supply of the
Taurus and a 50-day supply of the Sable. About a 60-65-day
supply is considered an ideal inventory level in the
industry.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>But sales of the models are slumping. In the latest 10-day
period, sales of the Taurus and Sable fell 32.7%.</p>
<p>The shutdowns will idle a total of 2,500 hourly workers.</p>
