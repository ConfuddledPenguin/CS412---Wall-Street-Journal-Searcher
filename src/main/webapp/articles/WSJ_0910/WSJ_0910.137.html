	<p class="article-leader">BRUSSELS -- British Airways filed a formal complaint with
the European Community Commission charging Lufthansa with
anti-competitive behavior regarding its bid for 26% of East
Germany's state-owned airline, Interflug.
   British Airways, which itself held unsuccessful talks with
Interflug this year, said, "We feel that if Lufthansa is
allowed to carry on (with its plans for the airline) it will
make free and fair competition in Germany very difficult and
will not be in the general interests of fair competition."</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The West German Federal Cartel Office has said it will
object to Lufthansa's plans to take a stake in Interflug
because such an all-German combination would be dominant in
the national market. The cartel office's final ruling on the
bid is expected by the end of October.</p>
<p>EC officials declined to comment on the British Airways
complaint. Lufthansa officials weren't available for comment.</p>
<p>Separately, the West German magazine Der Spiegel is
expected to report that British Airways has made a bid for a
49% stake in Interflug. A British Airways spokesman said that
the company wouldn't confirm or deny the report.</p>
