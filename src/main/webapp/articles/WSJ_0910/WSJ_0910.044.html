	<p class="article-leader">TORONTO -- Noranda Inc. and Trelleborg A.B. said they
signed a $1.73 billion refinancing of their joint purchase
last year of Falconbridge Ltd.
   The refinancing consists of two floating-rate, seven-year
term credit facilities: a $950 million syndicated bank
facility arranged in Europe and a 900 million Canadian dollar
($779 million) syndicated bank facility arranged in Canada.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The facilities replace C$2.25 billion in bridge loans
arranged with six Canadian banks at the time of the
companies' C$2.85 billion acquisition of Falconbridge. The
original loans would have been due Jan. 31, 1991. A Noranda
spokesman said terms of the new financing are "slightly
better" than the original facilities but couldn't say if it
would result in any savings to the mining company. Trelleborg
is an industrial group based in Sweden.</p>
