	<p class="article-leader">Tate & Lyle PLC said it has made an offer to Berisford
International PLC to buy the troubled British conglomerate's
British Sugar subsidiary.
   Terms weren't disclosed, but David Lang of Henderson
Crosthwaite estimates the value of British Sugar at #1
billion ($1.91 billion).</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Tate & Lyle is one of several companies currently in talks
with Berisford about the sale of British Sugar.</p>
<p>In March, Tate & Lyle made a preliminary offer for all of
Berisford International, which is posting losses related to
its U.S. property and jewelry interests.</p>
<p>In July, Tate & Lyle withdrew the offer after the
Monopolies and Merger Commission announced it would review
the merger plan for its impact on competition.</p>
<p>Berisford Chairman John Sclater said in July that the
company is seeking to sell assets, including British Sugar,
to cut debt.</p>
