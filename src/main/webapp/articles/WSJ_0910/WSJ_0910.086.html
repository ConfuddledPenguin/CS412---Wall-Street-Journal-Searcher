	<p class="article-leader">The word went out in November 1989 that socialism is dead,
but the message doesn't seem to have arrived in Ontario yet.
Voters in Canada's biggest and richest province gave the
socialist New Democratic Party a huge majority in the
provincial legislature on Thursday -- a majority that the NDP
intends to use to raise taxes, impose centralized control of
wages (via "comparable worth") and pull Canada's health care
ever closer to a Soviet-like model. It makes us wonder if
some Canadians are still getting their European news by dog
sled?</p>
