	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- Federal regulators found, in a spot audit of
television and radio stations, that political candidates
often are overcharged for campaign advertisements.
   The Federal Communications Commission staff said that 16
of 20 TV stations it checked charged political candidates
more than commercial advertisers for air time in virtually
every time period the agency analyzed. At one station, the
agency said, candidates paid $5,500 for a 30-second
advertisement, while commercial advertisers paid only as much
as $3,000.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Under federal law, broadcasters aren't supposed to charge
candidates more than they generally charge commercial
advertisers. And during the 45 days before a primary election
and the 60 days preceeding a general election, candidates are
supposed to be billed the same low rates as a station's "most
favored commercial advertiser."</p>
<p>Candidates fared better with radio stations, but Roy
Stewart, head of the FCC's Mass Media Bureau, said that may
reflect generally less use of radio for political
advertising.</p>
<p>Mr. Stewart said the agency is continuing its
investigation into compliance by the stations, and that it
could eventually decide to fine some of them. Nevertheless,
he said the main purpose of the audit and the report released
Friday was educational: The FCC wants to help the broadcast
industry comply with the law, especially since broadcasters
should be offering even cheaper rates to political candidates
now that there are less than 60 days before the general
election.</p>
<p>This week, the FCC plans to send broadcasters information
in question-and-answer form on the campaign advertising
rules, and it will hold a seminar in Washington on
compliance. In addition, the agency is planning to make a
videotape that explains broadcasters' obligations.</p>
<p>The rules, however, are hardly clearcut. The problem, Mr.
Stewart said, is that broadcasters "are not aware of the full
range of their responsibilities in advising political
candidates" on advertising rates.</p>
<p>Edward O. Fritts, president of the National Association of
Broadcasters, said he was pleased with the educational
effort. But he took issue with the FCC's approach, saying it
was "unfortunate the commission issued a report which gives
the impression that it has made final conclusions when it has
not, and that presumes there are violations" before
broadcasters even responded to the audits.</p>
<p>Sen. John Danforth (R., Mo.), a friend of FCC Chairman
Alfred Sikes, said the audit "confirms what candidates have
known for some time," and called the FCC's action a
"constructive first step." He called for enactment of
campaign finance legislation already approved by the Senate
Commerce Committee, which is designed to clarify the existing
law so as to ensure that candidates pay no more than
commercial advertisers.</p>
<p>The FCC's audits, which began on July 16, covered four
television stations and two radio stations in each of five
metropolitan areas: Cincinnati, Dallas-Fort Worth,
Philadelphia, Portland, Ore., and San Francisco. Mr. Stewart
said the cities were selected because they are geographically
diverse and some of the stations serve markets in two or
three states, and thus were likely to be used by more
candidates.</p>
