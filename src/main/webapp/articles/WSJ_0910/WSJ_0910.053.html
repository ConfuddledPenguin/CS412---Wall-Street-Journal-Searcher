	<p class="article-leader">Your patronizing editorial ("Energy Lesson 1," Aug. 8)
"explaining" why it is "necessary" for retailers of petroleum
products to raise immediately the price of inventory stocks
in anticipation of an impending increase in wholesale prices
is an insult to the intelligence of Journal readers.
Extending your logic to other industries, it would be
necessary for automobile dealers to raise the price of cars
in inventory to the anticipated replacement cost upon
notification of a forthcoming increase in the manufacturer's
wholesale prices. Everyone knows it is not possible for
automobile dealers, or retailers in any other industry, to do
that. Moreover, even those who buy your convoluted logic will
realize that the petroleum retailers in your example will
profit excessively by charging customers the "anticipated"
increased price for inventory stocks, and will then realize
their normal profit when they actually sell new supplies
purchased at a higher price.
   Americans are noted for their common sense and sense of
fair play. That, rather than the economic ignorance implied
by your editorial, explains why people of all backgrounds are
enraged by the sharply higher prices they are being forced to
pay for gasoline and fuel oil.</p>

<p>I read your Dick and Jane's "Energy Lesson 1" editorial
with dismay. Why so quick to be condescending when it may be
you who have missed the point? We all understand pricing with
an eye toward "r-e-p-l-a-c-e-m-e-n-t costs." It's the switch
to inventory cost pricing when the feed stock prices drop
that highlights the contradiction. When the price of oil went
down in recent years the gasoline prices stayed high for a
while, we were told, because of high-priced oil inventories.</p>
<p>I fear your patronizing lesson concerning one method of
pricing missed the issue.</p>

<p>Rip-off. Again, RIP-OFF. That's R-I-P-O-F-F. This is the
only way to summarize the fraudulent energy crisis resulting
from Kuwait being Saddamized. Believe it or not, we consumers
are not all ignorant about the oil market -- we know
perfectly well that unrest in the Middle East (so what else
is new]) does not lead to an instant oil shortage. We are
also aware that:</p>
<p>-- Given time for shipment, refining, transportation
through the system and storage, it is approximately two
months' time from the extraction of oil to pumping into our
cars;</p>
<p>-- A large surplus of oil was amassed by oil companies and
governments during the period of low crude-oil prices in the
mid-to-late 1980s;</p>
<p>-- Iraq and Kuwait together account for a whopping 4% of
U.S. oil consumption;</p>
<p>-- None of the major American oil companies have a sizable
stake in Iraq or Kuwait.</p>
<p>While you correctly state that it is unjust to blame
service-station operators for raising prices if their costs
go up, it is certainly appropriate to be suspicious of the
oil companies' lust in chalking up their "replacement costs."</p>

<p>What is making Congress and consumers upset is that the
"replacement cost" theory does not work when prices are
declining.</p>
<p>When crude-oil prices fell from $30 a barrel to $12 a
barrel, retail gasoline prices lagged behind by six months,
and even then did not move proportionally to the crude-oil
price drop.</p>
<p>While I am certainly not advocating any form of price
controls, and I agree that the free market eventually works,
your editorial neglects to explain why the amazing
sensitivity of the market on the way up is not mirrored on
the way down.</p>
