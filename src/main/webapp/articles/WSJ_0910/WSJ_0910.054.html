	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Kidder, Peabody & Co.'s busy program trading
unit has lost yet another key member.
   Last week, senior trader Robert Deutsch left Kidder to
join Nomura Securities International Inc. The unit also
recently lost options trader Ramesh Menon to County NatWest
Ltd., which is building a program trading unit under the
direction of executive director Gregory Kipnis, formerly of
Morgan Stanley Group Inc.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The departures come six months after Nomura jumped into
program trading with the hiring of Joseph R. Schmuckler,
formerly in charge of customer program trading at Kidder.
Kidder is a unit of General Electric Co.</p>
<p>Mr. Deutsch was an important member of Kidder's
proprietary stock-index arbitrage unit, led by senior vice
president Peter Klein, according to people familiar with the
unit. When he starts at Nomura next month, Mr. Deutsch will
be responsible for stock-index arbitrage strategies in U.S.
markets.</p>
<p>"We've brought in a first-class team of traders," said Mr.
Schmuckler, who has hired a staff of 10 market makers and
analysts, including former members of Salomon Brothers equity
department.</p>
<p>Thomas Ryan, head of equity trading at Kidder, said the he
has no plans for restructuring the program trading unit. "We
are quite pleased with the people we have and the results
that we're getting," Mr. Ryan said.</p>
<p>For much of the summer, Kidder has been one of the most
active program trading firms, principally due to a large
amount of stock-index arbitrage for the firm's own account.
Recent New York Stock Exchange data show that Kidder traded
6.9 million shares for its own account in program trading
strategies during the week ended Aug. 24. Overall, Kidder
traded 9.8 million shares in program trading strategies, and
9.3 million of that was stock-index arbitrage.</p>
<p>In stock-index arbitrage, traders dart between stocks,
futures and options to profit from fleeting price
differences.</p>
