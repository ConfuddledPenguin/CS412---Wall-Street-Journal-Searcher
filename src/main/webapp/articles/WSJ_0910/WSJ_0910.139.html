	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Some popular gold stocks, prized for their
scarcity, are about to become a lot less scarce. Many
investors in the stocks aren't happy about this.
   In coming weeks, U.S. and foreign investors will be hit by
a tidal wave of more than $1 billion of gold stocks and
warrants to buy shares. There will be new issues of Coeur
D'Alene Mines and Newmont Mining, which owns 90% of Newmont
Gold. And parent companies will be unloading part of their
stakes in Newmont Mining and Amax Gold.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>These issues will follow a recent stock sale in Europe and
Canada by American Barrick Resources. Analysts think other
gold companies also could climb on the bandwagon.</p>
<p>"The moment they see a chance to raise money," North
American gold mining companies "swamp the market with new
shares," says John Brimelow, director of international
research at Keane Securities in New York. "It undermines
confidence in owning the stocks." The same thing happened
during the 1987 runup in gold shares, Mr. Brimelow says.</p>
<p>The $1 billion for the four issues involving American
Barrick, Amax Gold, Newmont Mining and Coeur D'Alene assumes
that investors exercise all the warrants that will be issued.
This represents a huge increase -- perhaps 4% or more -- in
the publicly traded market for North American gold mining
shares, which has an estimated value of roughly $30 billion.</p>
<p>Already in the week since the onslaught of offerings was
announced, some gold stocks have wilted. Sentiment about the
Mideast crisis has played a big part in the drop. But the
bountiful supply of new shares could temporarily "stop the
momentum of the rally" in gold stocks that began in July,
says Lucille Palermo, an analyst for the International
Investors gold funds.</p>
<p>Among the gold issues announced, Britain's Hanson
Industries plans to cut its 49% Newmont stake to 26% by
selling shares to the public. Amax will slice its 87% Amax
Gold stake to 54%. The figures for both companies assume that
investors exercise the warrants that will be part of the
offerings.</p>
<p>The question some people are asking: If all these
companies are selling into a rally, why should investors buy?</p>
<p>Caesar Bryan, who runs the Lexington Gold Fund, advises
gold-stock fans not to buy gold shares from investment
bankers at the offerings. Rather, he says, investors should
wait till the air has cleared after the issues are brought
out, then buy stock in the open market.</p>
<p>"I don't bust my gut" buying stocks from securities firms
when shares of the same companies already are available in
the market, he says. Investment banking fees are a percentage
of the offering price -- so the higher the price the bigger
the fees.</p>
<p>The latest rally in gold shares began in July but has
faltered a bit. For instance, Amax Gold, which in July traded
as low as 12 7/8, went as high as 19 3/8 before its offering
was announced; Amax Gold was at 15 1/8 Friday. Gold stocks
still are pretty expensive, selling at multiples of 30 to 50
times estimated per-share profit for this year. The average
stock has a multiple of around 14.</p>
<p>Of course, gold is a universal currency and gold shares
are popular in troubled times like these. And for many
investors, big-name North American gold shares are the only
things to buy: They won't put money in shares of strife-torn
South Africa or lesser-known Canadian and Australian gold
stocks.</p>
<p>So North American gold stocks could be in hot demand if
the gold bullion price soars, which could happen if war
breaks out in the Middle East. Indeed, thanks to strong
foreign demand, Barrick's recent issue of five million shares
is said to have sold like hotcakes.</p>
<p>There's a big debate on Wall Street about whether
companies that are planning to unload gold shares are smart
sellers who are cashing in because they think gold stocks are
peaking.</p>
<p>Keane Securities' Mr. Brimelow, who is "cautiously
optimistic" about gold bullion prices, doubts that gold
companies are smart sellers. He thinks they're just
perennially skeptical about their own business, which tends
to be volatile.</p>
<p>A spokesman for Amax Inc., parent of Amax Gold, says, "We
always wanted to have more {Amax Gold} shares in the
marketplace." Amax Inc.'s sale of stock and warrants in its
gold unit would triple the number of publicly traded Amax
Gold shares.</p>
<p>At the International Investors gold funds, analyst Ms.
Palermo says it makes sense for companies to sell stock when
their shares are expensive. With new money, companies can
grow, she says, and in the long run that's good for
investors, too.</p>
<p>But most of the new money to be raised in the new gold
offerings won't find its way into the coffers of the mining
companies themselves.</p>
<p>For instance, Hanson could pocket $650 million from the
planned sale of Newmont stock and warrants. That calculation
is based on Friday's price for Newmont of 45. But Newmont
itself would raise only about $160 million by issuing new
Newmont shares.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Amax Inc. could take in more than $300 million
by selling Amax Gold stock and warrants. But Amax Gold won't
see a dime from its parent's offering.</p>
<p>Newmont Mining is "selling stock to help the company
grow," says James Hill, investor relations officer. Newmont
will use the money for exploration and to buy precious metals
assets, he adds. Newmont Mining mines a lot of different
metals so its stock has a lower multiple than "pure" gold
plays.</p>
<p>The Newmont issue is expected in October. No date has been
set for the Amax Gold issue.</p>
<p>Hanson is known as a smart seller. Last year, it sold 50%
of Smith Corona to the public at 21; Friday the stock was at
4 1/2. And Hanson bought Newmont at lower prices, so it would
show a nice profit on the stock sale.</p>
<p>A spokeswoman for Hanson says, "We wouldn't presume to let
people think we have that much knowledge of gold prices. We
followed the lead of Newmont and other professionals who
think this is an opportunity in the marketplace." After
cutting its Newmont stake to 26%, Hanson still will be one of
the world's biggest gold players; it owns the whole of
Consolidated Gold Fields.</p>
<p>Analysts believe Hanson once hoped to sell its entire
Newmont stake to another company at a big premium over the
current market price, but found no takers. Hanson's
spokeswoman says the company "never actively tried" to sell
the stake, although "it's safe to assume people were aware we
had this {Newmont} position and they know we are
approachable."</p>
<p>Mr. Bryan of the Lexington Gold Fund says investors have
to watch out for more sales of gold shares later by companies
such as Hanson and Amax. Their holdings are "overhanging the
market," he says, and "I don't see that much demand out
there" for a lot of gold stocks. Mr. Bryan adds that he
hasn't recently had any big cash inflows into his fund.</p>
<p>Some smart buyers, it seems, aren't interested in buying
gold shares at these prices.</p>
<p>In Canada, Placer Dome once showed interest in buying a
big Newmont Mining stake. Earl Dunlop, Placer's investor
relations officer, won't say if Placer ever talked with
Hanson. But he says, "We have looked at many {acquisition}
situations but haven't found one where the return would
exceed the cost of capital" needed to acquire the company.</p>
<p>Placer, he says, sees much more value in buying
undeveloped gold properties, and now is doing just that.
Except to pay for acquisitions of properties, Mr. Dunlop
says, Placer hasn't any current plans to issue new stock.</p>

<p>NEWMONT MINING Corp. of Denver sold its last non-gold
interest in July and now is solely a gold company. The
company's business was misstated in Monday's edition.</p>
