	<p class="article-leader">UNITED MERCHANTS & MANUFACTURERS Corp. (New York) --
Standard & Poor's Corp. said it raised its rating on this
textile maker's subordinated debt, citing the company's
payment of interest arrears and its debt restructuring. S&P
upgraded to double-C from D the rating on 13.75% senior
subordinated notes, due 2000, and 4% convertible subordinated
debentures, due in November. The rating concern also said
United Merchants' newly issued 3.5% senior subordinated
secured debentures, due 2009, are rated double-C. The new
debt was issued as part of the debt restructuring, in
exchange for a part of 13.75% and 15% debentures. About $170
million of debt is affected. Despite the debt restructuring,
a third bankruptcy-law filing is possible, because of
continuing poor operations, S&P said. United Merchants'
viability remains questionable, without significant operating
improvements and asset sales, it said.
