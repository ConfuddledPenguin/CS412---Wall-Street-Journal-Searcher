	<p class="article-leader">BRUSSELS -- Lufthansa German Airlines said it intends to
press its case for buying 26% of the East German state-owned
carrier Interflug, despite the West German Federal Cartel
Office's warning that the bid will be rejected.
   The antitrust agency has noted that Lufthansa, 51%-owned
by the state, already dominates the West German domestic air
market and the market from West Germany to European
destinations. A Lufthansa-Interflug combination would control
53% of these markets.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>But Lufthansa said Interflug is too small to affect
Lufthansa's market position greatly. Interflug has
drastically trimmed its flight program recently. Moreover,
Lufthansa has no landing rights at airports in East or West
Berlin. A value hasn't been assigned to the 26% Interflug
stake Lufthansa wants to buy.</p>
<p>"We don't understand why the cartel office objects,"
Lufthansa said. "But their decision isn't final. We have
until mid-August to write them and state our intentions."
Under West German law, any stake exceeding 25% is considered
a merger. The antitrust agency said Lufthansa could challenge
a ban in court. Or Lufthansa could ask the West German
Economics Ministry to overrule such a decision, in which case
the airline would have to prove that the proposed acquisition
is for the common economic good.</p>
<p>Interflug said it will back Lufthansa's effort to win
approval for the deal, though Interflug itself can't respond
to the West German cartel agency.</p>
