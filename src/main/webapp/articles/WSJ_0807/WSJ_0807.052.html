	<p class="article-leader">Those evil Democrats] With their "sonic boom of elation"
at the president's change of lips, they gave your editorial
writer an apoplectic attack ("Lipping It Up," June 28). I am
sure that the resulting high blood pressure blurred his
vision and he didn't notice that, in his written statement,
the president never bothered to admit that he duped the
American people and is now hiding behind the "bipartisan
leadership."
   To write that "the Democratic Party exists now for the
purpose of raising taxes" is sheer demagoguery. Anyway, if
the Democrats are not going to raise taxes and generate
revenue, how are you going to pay for all the B-2s that
George Bush wants to build, the new fighter planes, Star Wars
deployment, etc., etc.? How are you going to take care of all
those S&L payments that will come due over the next 30 years?
Cut Medicare you say? Well, I don't know. There are thousands
of doctors out there, hundreds of businesses running
hospitals; they make a good living off Medicare and they
probably vote Republican.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>I think you have a problem. And you can't let the deficit
grow indefinitely or the Japanese will stop lending us money.
What to do? How about joining the Democrats in writing a
pragmatic, responsible budget and ensuring that the money is
spent wisely and honestly. No more S&Ls, no more HUDs, no
more defense scandals. Simple, isn't it?</p>
