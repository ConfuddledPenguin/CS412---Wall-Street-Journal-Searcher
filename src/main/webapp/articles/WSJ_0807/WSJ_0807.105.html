	<p class="article-leader">Rubbermaid Inc. said it signed a definitive agreement to
buy Eldon Industries Inc. in a stock transaction that will
expand Rubbermaid's office products business.
   The acquisition, the company's largest to date, should
enable Rubbermaid to take advantage of the growing
service-related industry and the creation of more home
offices. The purchase also gives Rubbermaid a strong brand
name and more clout in selling to major retailers.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Under terms, each of Eldon's 9.3 million shares will be
converted into no fewer than 0.5438 and no more than 0.6320
Rubbermaid share. In composite trading on the New York Stock
Exchange, Rubbermaid closed at $36.875, down $2.625, giving
the transaction an estimated value of $186.5 million to
$216.7 million. The transaction wasn't announced until after
the market, which plummeted yesterday, was closed.</p>
<p>The number of Rubbermaid shares to be issued will be from
5,448,000 to 6,332,000. The Wooster, Ohio, company said the
exact number will equal $23.75 divided by the price of
Rubbermaid shares during the 10 trading days ending three
days prior to Eldon's stockholders meeting. The meeting's
date hasn't been set, but Eldon officials said they hope the
meeting will be in November.</p>
<p>The agreement is subject to Eldon shareholder and
regulatory approval. Rubbermaid said it has already received
commitments from stockholders representing 29% of Eldon's
stock. Rubbermaid also said the transaction would be
accounted for as a pooling of interest and thus wouldn't
affect 1990 per-share earnings.</p>
<p>Eldon, which earned $8.6 million on sales of $112.6
million in 1989, has a strong brand name in a variety of
office products from plastic to leather and wood. The
Inglewood, Calif., company has a stronger presence in the
commercial market than Rubbermaid, which has relied more on
the consumer side of office products with its wastebaskets,
chairmats and files.</p>
<p>"Eldon has a larger commercial business," said Jay
Freedman, an analyst with Kidder, Peabody & Co. "Now when
Rubbermaid starts dealing with some of the larger retailers
it can go in with a much broader product line."</p>
<p>Rubbermaid has been interested in acquiring companies that
complement its own product lines, have strong brand names,
and synergies in manufacturing. Eldon uses an injection
molding process, which is a Rubbermaid hallmark.</p>
<p>Richard Agins, Eldon vice president and general counsel,
said the agreement "maximizes shareholder value and gives
Eldon more options for growth." He said the combination is
partly a response to the emergence of office product
"superstores." Analysts have said that such stores put strong
downward pressure on wholesale office supply prices. Citing
this trend among other things, Avery International Corp. and
Dennison Manufacturing Co., two large office products
concerns, agreed to merge in May.</p>
