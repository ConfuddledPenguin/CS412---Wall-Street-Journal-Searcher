	<p class="article-leader">MAZDA MOTOR Corp. sold 120,030 imported cars in the Jan. 1
to July 30 period. For the period, Mazda's total car sales
were 163,170 vehicles and its combined car and truck sales
were 214,079 vehicles. These statistics were misstated in the
car sales table in yesterday's edition because of incorrect
information provided by Mazda. A corrected market share table
appears {in this issue}.
