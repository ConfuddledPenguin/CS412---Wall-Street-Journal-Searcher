	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- The productivity of U.S. businesses, paced
by an increase in the manufacturing sector, rebounded in the
second quarter from a disappointing first quarter, the Labor
Department reported.
   The productivity of all U.S. businesses -- output per hour
worked -- increased at an annual rate of 1.9% after falling
at a 1.5% rate in the first quarter. Nonfarm productivity
rose at an annual rate of 1.6%, its first gain in six
quarters. Manufacturing productivity rose at a rate of 3.7%,
somewhat slower than the 5.1% rise in the previous quarter.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Gordon Richards, staff economist for the National
Association of Manufacturers, said he was "a little bit
surprised how strong {the productivity figures} WERE,
considering how slowly GNP grew." The Commerce Department has
estimated that real gross national product, or the nation's
total output of goods and services, adjusted for inflation,
rose at a 1.2% annual rate during the period. "I think if the
productivity figures are correct," said Mr. Richards, "they
suggest that GNP may be revised upwards."</p>
<p>But Priscilla Trumbull, senior industrial economist at
WEFA Group, was less optimistic. "It's a fairly bad report
for the non-manufacturing side of things," she said. "It
shows a weakness in a number of sectors, and yet labor costs
are increasing."</p>
<p>The measure of the productivity of American business is an
important indication of the economy's strength and
competitiveness. If companies can improve their productivity,
they can raise employees' wages without raising prices or
cutting profits. Productivity increases can be attributed to
advances in technology that allow workers to work more
efficiently, a more highly skilled work force and increases
in capital investment.</p>
<p>In an indication that inflation pressures remain, wages in
the second quarter rose at an annual rate of 5.9%, the most
since the second quarter of 1987. Real wages, which take into
account the effect of inflation, rose at an annual rate of
2.2% during the second quarter, the first time in seven
quarters that wages have risen faster than inflation. In the
first quarter, wages rose at an annual rate of 3.8%, while
real wages fell at a rate of 4%.</p>
<p>The labor costs of a unit of production grew at a 4%
annual rate, following a rise at a 5.3% rate during the first
quarter.</p>
<p>Donald Straszheim, an economist with Merrill Lynch & Co.,
says that inflationary pressures from the increasing labor
costs should be limited: "As slow growth continues, some
relief from labor cost pressures is expected, but not
immediatelyhefty wage increases were reported for June and
July. Still, better inflation figures are possible in 1991,
after the recent run-up in oil prices has worked its way
through."</p>
<p>While the manufacturing sector's productivity rose, the
overall increase was tempered by a sluggish service sector.
The overall annual growth rate of 1.6% in the nonfarm sector
was far short of the 3.7% growth in the manufacturing sector,
an indication that services continue to be a drag on
productivity. The Labor Department doesn't publish separate
statistics for the service sector.</p>
<p>The figures are adjusted for seasonal variations.</p>
