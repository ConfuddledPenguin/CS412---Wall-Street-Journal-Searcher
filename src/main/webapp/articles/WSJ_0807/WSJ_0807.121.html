	<p class="article-leader">La-Z-Boy Chair Co., Monroe, Mich., said it expects to post
a decline in earnings for the first quarter ended July 29,
because of weaker industry sales and poor performance by some
of the company's operations.
   Though fiscal first-quarter financial results won't be
available until the week of Aug. 20, preliminary indications
are for earnings "well below" the year-earlier 13 cents a
share, Charles T. Knabusch, chairman and president, said. In
the fiscal 1990 first quarter, La-Z-Boy earned $2.3 million
on sales of $117.7 million.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>La-Z-Boy, a maker of reclining chairs and upholstered
furniture, said that unless a "marked improvement in the
economy and industry sales" occurs, its fiscal 1991 earnings
also will decline from the year-earlier net income of $28.3
million, or $1.58 a share, on sales of $592.3 million.</p>
