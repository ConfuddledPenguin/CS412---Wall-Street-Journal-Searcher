	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- The Food and Drug Administration approved a
new Burroughs Wellcome Co. drug to treat premature babies
suffering from respiratory distress syndrome.
   The drug, to be marketed under the name Exosurf Neonatal,
provides a synthetic surfactant -- a soapy substance that
coats the inside of the lungs and keeps them from collapsing
when the infant exhales -- until the lungs can produce the
substance on their own. Exosurf is administered soon after
birth to babies on a mechanical ventilator.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>About 250,000 babies are born prematurely each year, about
50,000 of them suffer from respiratory distress syndrome and
about 5,000 die from the condition, according to Eva Kemper,
an FDA information officer.</p>
<p>Tests of Exosurf have shown it reduces the death rate from
RDS 50% or more. In addition, the substance may reduce the
time babies must spend on artificial breathing machines.</p>
<p>The drug was invented by Dr. John Clements of the
University of California, San Fransciso, and licensed by
Burroughs, Research Triangle Park, N.C., a unit of Wellcome
PLC, London. Under the Orphan Drug Act, which encourages the
development of drugs for diseases that afflict low patient
populations, Burroughs will have a seven-year monopoly to
manufacture Exosurf.</p>
<p>Abbott Laboratories of Abbott Park, Ill., has developed a
drug called Survanta that is designed to achieve the same
results. Survanta, which is awaiting FDA approval, is made
from cow lungs, while Exosurf is a synthetic product made
from chemicals.</p>
