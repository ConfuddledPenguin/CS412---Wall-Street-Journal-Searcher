	<p class="article-leader">GREENWICH, Conn. -- W.R. Berkley Corp., an insurance
holding company, said it could face a third-quarter charge of
$10 million, or 84 cents a share, following arbitration of a
reinsurance dispute.
   The potential charge stems from an unfavorable ruling by
an arbitration panel involving a dispute between a Berkley
subsidiary and several of its reinsurers. The reinsurers had
refused to cover losses paid by Admiral Insurance Co., a
property-casualty unit of Berkley, on bonds that guaranteed
the performance of real-estate limited partnerships.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The arbitration panel's ruling requires the reinsurers to
cover some of the losses, but far less than Admiral had
requested. The lower-than-expected award would require
Berkley to write down amounts previously reflected as
reinsurance receivables.</p>
<p>"We are disappointed in the award and are presently
considering our alternatives, including the possibility of
appeal or other legal action," said Robert S. Gorin, senior
vice president and general counsel of Berkley.</p>
<p>In the third quarter of 1989, Berkley -- whose
subsidiaries operate in regional property and casualty
insurance, specialty lines of insurance and insurance service
operations -- reported earnings of $12.1 million, or $1.03 a
share.</p>
<p>Berkeley shares closed yesterday at $36, down $2, in
national over-the-counter trading.</p>
