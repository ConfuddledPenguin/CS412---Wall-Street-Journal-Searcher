	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- A New York state trial court, backing
Southland Corp. in a dispute with New York's attorney
general, said franchisers in the state may negotiate deals
that vary from the terms in franchise documents.
   "The decision, the first of its kind, is expected to have
a broad impact on the way franchisers operate nationwide,"
said David J. Kaufmann, attorney for Southland, Dallas-based
franchiser of 7-Eleven stores.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The office of Attorney General Robert Abrams is studying
whether to appeal the decision of Justice Elliott Wilk.</p>
<p>The dispute arose last year, after Southland negotiated a
deal with the Riese Organization, under which the New York
real estate concern would open 7-Eleven stores in Manhattan.
After the negotiations, Southland moved to amend its
franchise papers. Attorneys for the state argued that
amendments must come first; talks, second.</p>
<p>Before clearing the amendment, the state asked Southland
to sign an "assurance of discontinuance" of improper
franchising practices and pay $1,000 in costs. Southland did
both, but sought in the court case to establish that New York
franchise law permitted the original negotiations.</p>
<p>Justice Wilk ruled that the office of the state's attorney
general had exceeded its authority "by creating a substantive
requirement that a franchise must be offered on terms
unilaterally decided upon by the franchiser, without input
from prospective franchisees via post-registration
negotiations."</p>
