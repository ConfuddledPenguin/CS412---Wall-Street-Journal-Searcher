	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Small investors, spooked by the specter of a
prolonged stock market slide, have begun bailing out of stock
mutual funds.
   While there weren't any signs of a mass exodus, many large
mutual-fund groups said investors yanked more money out than
they put into stock funds on Friday. Yesterday, those
redemptions accelerated; several funds became heavy sellers
of stocks, raising cash to meet any further redemptions,
traders said.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"We're not seeing a panic and people blowing out, but
obviously they are moving away from equity funds until the
smoke settles," said Robert Leo, an executive vice president
and director of mutual funds at Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc.</p>
<p>The redemptions appear to have stopped the budding
stock-fund recovery in its tracks: Through June, investors
had poured $13.8 billion more into stock funds than they
pulled out, putting the fund industry on track for its best
year ever. Once again, it seems, small investors entered the
stock market in droves just in time for prices to tank.</p>
<p>The most frenzied activity has involved funds sold
directly to investors, rather than through brokers. Fidelity
Investments, the nation's largest fund group, said net
redemptions were "moderate" Friday. Yesterday, the outflow
from Fidelity stock funds was the largest since last autumn,
traders said. A Fidelity spokesman said the firm has "more
than ample cash to meet any redemptions we might experience."</p>
<p>Investors also pulled out more money yesterday from stock
funds than they put into them at other big direct-market
groups, including Vanguard Group Inc., T. Rowe Price
Associates Inc., Twentieth Century Investors and Janus
Capital Corp.</p>
<p>So far, redemptions are nowhere near the levels that
followed the October 1987 stock market crash or the "junk"
fund sales stemming from the minicrash of October 1989.</p>
<p>And much of the redemptions, which have come primarily
from growth stock funds and international portfolios, have
been switched into money market funds. This means the assets
have stayed within the fund companies, but these firms earn
more from stock funds because they require more active
management.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the activity has put many big fund companies
on guard. Groups such as Fidelity and T. Rowe Price have
added extra staff members to answer telephones. Fidelity's
flagship Magellan Fund has raised its cash position to 8%
from about 7% less than two weeks ago.</p>
<p>While investors had been pouring in about $5 million a day
into T. Rowe Price stock funds in July, they took out about
$15 million on Friday, officials of the firm said. But this
represents less than 1% of T. Rowe Price stock fund assets
and is far less than the outflow during previous market
debacles, they said.</p>
<p>"Anybody who had been thinking of reducing their equity
exposure had a good excuse to do it," said Steven Norwitz, a
T. Rowe Price vice president.</p>
<p>At Janus, investors pulled $14 million out of its three
stock funds on Friday and funneled the money into the Janus
money market fund, a spokeswoman said. As more than $1.6
billion is invested in Janus's stock funds, she said, the
outflow "wasn't overwhelming."</p>
<p>Twentieth Century, which has several aggressive-growth
stock funds that are susceptible to skittish investors, said
yesterday's stock fund outflows exceeded those on Friday.
"But we're not being avalanched," a spokesman said, declining
to quantify the redemption activity. "It's nothing that's
raising alarm bells here."</p>
<p>Shearson Lehman, as at many other fund groups, has seen
the most significant investor reaction in its
aggressive-growth and capital-appreciation funds. Money
flowing into Shearson's stock funds has plunged as much as
25% in recent days, said Mr. Leo, Shearson's mutual funds
director.</p>
<p>Vanguard said its stock funds outflow yesterday was the
heaviest since last autumn. But one reason for this, the firm
said, is that money has been streaming into its stock funds
for most of this year. "It's a warped yardstick," Brian
Mattes, a Vanguard vice president, said.</p>
<p>For their part, fund groups emphasize that investors have
learned to buy on market drops. But some fund specialists
said investors may be surprised this time. This is because
the most recent stock market decline could be prolonged, they
said, considering the uncertainty about the Middle East and
the weak state of the economy.</p>
<p>"You can't always look at what happened the last time
around," Donald Phillips, editor of Morningstar Inc.'s Mutual
Fund Values publication, said. "If you expect this to be
quick and painless, you may be as wrong as people were in
October 1987, when they expected the drop to be long and
drawn out."</p>
