	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- The American Stock Exchange disciplined three
former employees of Interstate Securities Inc. and one of
Advest Group Inc. for alleged rule violations.
   The four settled the Amex charges without admitting or
denying wrongdoing.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The former employees at Interstate, which is now
Interstate/Johnson Lane, Charlotte, N.C., are Jeffrey Siegel
of New York and Clifford Butcher and Brenda Scott of Tampa,
Fla. The former employee of Advest Group, Hartford, Conn., is
Matthew Kulkin of Boston.</p>
<p>Mr. Siegel was barred from association with Amex member
firms for two years; Ms. Scott was fined $12,000; Mr. Butcher
was suspended from certain options transactions for six
months and fined $7,000; and Mr. Kulkin was fined $10,000.</p>
<p>Mr. Butcher declined to comment; the others couldn't be
reached.</p>

<p>Corrections & Amplifications</p>
<p>MATTHEW KULKIN is a broker at Advest Group Inc.'s Advest
Inc. subsidiary. Yesterday's edition incorrectly said he no
longer is employed at the brokerage company.</p>
