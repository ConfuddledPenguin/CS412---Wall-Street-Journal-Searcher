	<p class="article-leader">Former Wall Street stock speculator Salim "Sandy" Lewis
agreed to pay $475,000 to settle a Securities and Exchange
Commission civil suit accusing him of securities-law
violations.
   The lawsuit, filed yesterday in federal court in
Manhattan, alleged that Mr. Lewis committed fraud and
violated record-keeping rules in connection with American
Express Co.'s sale of part of its Fireman's Fund Corp. stake
in 1986. The SEC accused Mr. Lewis of manipulating the price
of Fireman's Fund stock with the help of Jefferies & Co., a
Los Angeles brokerage firm.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Last August, Mr. Lewis, 50 years old, pleaded guilty to
three felony counts in connection with the stock-manipulation
scheme. He was sentenced to three years' probation and fined
$250,000.</p>
<p>In settling the SEC civil suit, Mr. Lewis neither admitted
nor denied the allegations. His attorney, Theodore Wells Jr.,
said, "Although we believe no one was hurt by the trades in
question and there were no financial losses by investors in
the marketplace, the settlement was made to avoid lengthy and
costly litigation with the government."</p>
<p>The SEC said that the $475,000 is meant to partially make
up for the effect of Mr. Lewis's actions on the market price
of Fireman's Fund stock at the time.</p>
<p>As part of the settlement, Mr. Lewis also agreed not to
violate any securities laws in the future. Mr. Lewis, of
Short Hills, N.J., was formerly head of S.B. Lewis & Co., a
securities broker and dealer.</p>
<p>The SEC said that in the stock-manipulation scheme, Mr.
Lewis arranged for Jefferies to cause the price of Fireman's
Fund stock to close at a certain level on May 8, 1986, so
that American Express could sell its stake at a more
advantageous price. In return, Mr. Lewis told Boyd Jefferies,
then chairman of the brokerage firm, that he would make up
for any loss that Mr. Jefferies sustained on the transaction.</p>
<p>At the time of his guilty plea, Mr. Lewis said he made the
arrangement with Jefferies in an attempt to counter the
efforts of so-called short sellers who were trying to drive
down the price of the stock before a planned secondary
offering.</p>

<p>FREEZE ON SPENDING by Manville trust is extended until
Sept. 6.</p>
<p>The order by Judge Jack B. Weinstein of federal court in
Brooklyn, N.Y., gives the asbestos personal-injury trust
additional time to restructure its financing. Last month the
judge had set yesterday as the deadline for the trust to come
up with financing changes to solve its cash shortage. But he
agreed to extend the deadline after hearing a report from
bankruptcy-court special adviser Leon Silverman, who said
progress was being made in solving the trust's money woes.</p>
<p>The trust, which is independent of Denver-based Manville
Corp., was set up in 1986 to pay all asbestos personal-injury
claims against the company. The trust was the cornerstone of
Manville's bankruptcy-court reorganization plan.</p>
<p>At a joint hearing before Judge Weinstein and New York
state Justice Helen Freedman, Mr. Silverman said discussions
are under way to come up with cash for the trust and to
reduce its operating expenses. Although he wouldn't disclose
details, Mr. Silverman said, "We have identified means for
refinancing the trust to provide meaningful funds for the
short term" without jeopardizing the trust's long-term
financing.</p>
<p>Mr. Silverman said at the hearing that other changes are
being made to reduce the likelihood that asbestos victims
will take the trust to court, rather than settle their
claims. That would translate into major savings for the
trust, since litigation costs are its largest expense. For
instance, changes are likely to be made in determining which
claims are paid first, and the trust is seeking to
standardize the amount it pays on certain asbestos claims.</p>
<p>After the hearing, Mr. Silverman said he thinks an
agreement in principle can be reached on the refinancing by
Sept. 6.</p>
<p>Despite Mr. Silverman's report, Judge Weinstein criticized
the company's response so far to the trust's problems. "I'm
not convinced that management understands the seriousness of
this matter," said Judge Weinstein, who has authority over
all issues arising out of Manville's bankruptcy-law
reorganization. "{Manville's} management may not act as if
they are bound only by the letter of those agreements that
set up the trust."</p>
<p>Thomas Stephens, Manville's chief executive officer,
declined to say what steps the company is considering taking
to aid the trust. But he said, "There is no higher priority
to the company, and we are giving it our full attention."</p>
<p>Also, Judge Weinstein said he will rule on a motion
seeking a class action for all asbestos personal-injury
claims after a meeting of federal judges in Washington
Friday.</p>
<p>The judges are meeting to come up with a national approach
to easing the backlog of asbestos cases in the courts.</p>

<p>A FORMER BROKER WINS $23.4 million defamation award from
Dean Witter.</p>
<p>The former commodities broker, who was fired from Dean
Witter Reynolds Inc. in 1982, successfully claimed that the
Sears, Roebuck & Co. unit had libeled and slandered him in
filings with securities exchanges and in a statement to a
potential employer.</p>
<p>The jury verdict, which includes more than $15 million in
punitive damages, is believed to be one of the largest
defamation verdicts in Texas. Two Dean Witter employees were
also defendants.</p>
<p>Daniel Waite, who his lawyer says earned approximately
$400,000 a year, alleged in state district court in Houston
that Dean Witter filed false termination forms with the
Commodities Futures Trading Commission, the Chicago
Mercantile Exchange and other securities and commodities
exchanges. On the form, called a U-5, Dean Witter claimed
that Mr. Waite had violated a New York Mercantile Exchange
regulation requiring the brokerage firm to know the location
of the commodities covered by the commodities contract,
according to Michael D. Sydow, Mr. Waite's lawyer in Houston.</p>
<p>But, according to Mr. Sydow, a New York Mercantile
Exchange official testified that the regulation was only a
proposed rule. On the U-5, the company also wrote that Mr.
Waite was fired "as a result of this incident and
demonstrated inability to follow other company policies."</p>
<p>In a statement, Dean Witter spokesman James M. Flynn said
the company is "disappointed and surprised" about the
verdict. "It has always been our policy to comply with all
regulatory requirements and to conduct our business in the
best interests of our clients. After careful review of these
responsibilities and requirements, we believe our actions
regarding this matter were taken in good faith."</p>
<p>He said Dean Witter planned to appeal the verdict.</p>

<p>A CAR DEALER FILED an unusual suit blaming GM for his
firm's collapse.</p>
<p>The dealer, who had filed for bankruptcy-court protection,
alleges that General Motors Corp.'s GMAC finance arm set up
the "financial dismantling" of his 35-franchise empire by
pushing him to expand rapidly by taking on heavy debt and
then tightening the credit reins.</p>
<p>In the lender-liability suit, Richard T. Pepe of Vineland,
N.J., is trying to establish that GMAC, in effect, became his
partner by arranging loans that covered more than 100% of the
price he paid for additional franchises in the 1980s. Mr.
Pepe, who said he paid himself $3.5 million a year, is
seeking $115 million from GMAC for his business failure.</p>
<p>Industry officials fear such suits may become more common
as car dealers who became overextended in the booming sales
years of the late-1980s increasingly fail in the current
climate of lower sales, lower margins and higher interest
rates.</p>
<p>General Motors declined to comment on the suit.</p>
