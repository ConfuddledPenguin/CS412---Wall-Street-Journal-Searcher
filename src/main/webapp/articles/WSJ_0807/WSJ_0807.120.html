	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Gold futures prices rose strongly in moderate
trading, closing at or near their highs of the day in
response to the continued Middle East tension.
   The soonest-to-expire August delivery ended at its high of
the day at $384.70 an ounce, up $7.30. The most-active
December contract settled at $393.80, just shy of its high of
$394, for an advance of $7.40. Trading volume was estimated
at 34,000 contracts, down from 57,078 Friday.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>September silver rose five cents an ounce to $4.92 after
trading as high as $4.9350. October platinum edged $2.30 an
ounce higher to $490.40. It traded as high as $491.70.</p>
<p>Considering gold's lackluster performance Friday, when it
traded over a $9 range before closing about unchanged,
yesterday's move was "quite good," according to Craig Sloane,
precious metal analyst for Smith Barney, Harris Upham.</p>
<p>Reports that Iraqi troops were massing near the Saudi
Arabian border was the principal price-firming factor, Mr.
Sloane said.</p>
<p>"The tension in the Middle East is growing, and it can
only go so far," he said. "Iraq doesn't seem to be giving way
under international pressure triggered by its invasion into
Kuwait, and President Bush is talking tough. Sooner or later,
something's got to give."</p>
<p>An important factor for precious metals, Mr. Sloane said,
is the impact of the Middle East situation on Japan. "The
stock market there has been steadily dropping and is now
close to the level of several months ago when it was at its
weakest."</p>
<p>Japan is a major buyer of precious metals. "But things
aren't going well for them in many ways. The boom in oil
prices could significantly affect their economy. The yen is
easier, and interest rates there are higher. If they decide
to pull back as precious metals buyers, the impact on gold
and, particularly, platinum, could be significant. Japan is
the leading platinum buyer. This could be why platinum was
such a lagging market," Mr. Sloane said.</p>
<p>James Kneafsey, president of Cambridge Financial
Management in Cambridge, Mass., said the close at its high
for the day was "a good sign" for gold. "If it can continue
to rise, it can test $400."</p>
<p>However, Mr. Kneafsey termed the advance "grudging," which
he attributed partly to the change in the Soviet political
posture. "In the past, a critical situation such as the one
in the Middle East would have had traders reacting with alarm
as to what the Soviet Union would do," he said. "That
unsettling factor isn't present at the moment. One indication
of this is that European currencies are strong, something
that would have never happened in the past in such a major
crisis."</p>
<p>Ken Gettinger, vice president, precious metals, for Union
Bank of Switzerland, New York, said traders were reassessing
the Middle East situation, which accounted for slower trading
than on Friday.</p>
<p>"Prices rose because Iraq didn't appear to be withdrawing
its troops from Kuwait, which on Friday they were expected to
do," he said. Other price-firming developments for gold, he
said, were the drop in the stock market, the weak dollar and
the strong oil market.</p>
<p>"The strength in oil is causing the word `inflation' to
pop up more in people's minds," Mr. Gettinger said. "This is
causing traders to seek a safe haven in gold from other
investments."</p>
<p>According to Robert Kwasney, editor of Kwasney Economics,
of Secaucus, N.J., the strength in oil will give gold only a
short-term boost.</p>
<p>"This isn't an inflationary scenario, like in the 1970s
when the Federal Reserve was pumping money into the banking
system," Mr. Kwasney said. "Over the long run, if gold
continues to rise, it will be because of currently present
fundamentals, such as the fact that the Soviet Union has
stopped selling gold and that there is a potential for civil
unrest in South Africa."</p>
<p>Rick Lawson, vice president of the Rhode Island Hospital
Trust National Bank of Providence, R.I., said buying interest
in all precious metals products has increased because of the
Middle Eastern crisis. This includes legal currencies as well
as bullion products, he said.</p>
<p>"Demand for platinum products, which had been weak
recently, also has perked up," he said.</p>
<p>In other markets yesterday:</p>
<p>COPPER: Futures prices recovered from early declines to
end higher. The September contract rose 0.85 cent a pound to
$1.2635 after trading as low as $1.2280. The close was just
under the day's high of $1.2650. Some buying of copper by
Japan in London contributed to the firmer tone, analysts
said. One analyst, Bernard Savaiko of PaineWebber, observed
that traders are preoccupied with the negative implications
of higher oil prices on the economies of industrialized
nations. The impact could be particularly acute in Japan,
which is a major copper buyer. If that buying declines,
global demand for copper could fall sharply, he said. "The
situation in the Middle East is very uncertain," he said. "If
it intensifies and major nations are drawn into a conflict
there, it is well to remember that copper is called the
`metal of war,'" he said. Copper is used in armaments
generally, such as shell casings, in transportation and in
communications. "If there is a broader conflict, copper's war
role could far offset any negative impact on copper demand
because of economics," Mr. Savaiko said.</p>
<p>SUGAR: Futures prices gained in profit-taking. The October
contract ended with a gain of 0.52 cent at 10.42 cents.
Demand for contracts largely consisted of purchases to offset
previous sales, according to Sandra Kaul, analyst for
Shearson Lehman Brothers. The October future's price dropped
almost 1 3/4 cents a pound over the past two weeks to as low
as 9.80 cents, and traders decided to take profits, she said.
The Middle Eastern crisis could affect Brazil and cause some
concern over that nation's sugar supply, according to Ms.
Kaul. "Brazil imports the bulk of its oil from Iraq, and it
claims it will continue to do so despite the attempts of many
countries to boycott Iraqi oil shipments," she said. Any
blockade of Iraqi shipments of oil would force Brazil to step
up its production of fuel ethanol to avoid an energy crisis,
according to Ms. Kaul, which "would absorb sugar earmarked
for export and cause concern over world market supplies and
prices."</p>
<p>GRAINS AND SOYBEANS: Prices of soybean futures contracts
rose strongly in light trading on speculation of the economic
impact of Iraq's invasion of Kuwait. The price of the
November soybean futures contract rose 11 cents a bushel. The
price of the December corn futures contract settled five
cents higher a bushel, largely in sympathy with soybean
prices. Analysts said increases in crude oil prices caused
traders to speculate that foreign producers of oil may be in
a better position to buy grain in the future. Any hint of an
increase in foreign demand would have the effect of pushing
up grain futures prices. Some of the rally in soybean futures
prices may also have been in anticipation of Thursday's
supply and demand report for the soybean crop. "There's some
concern that frost could become a factor, although none of
the most prominent weather forecasters are touting frost
right now," said Mike Gazall, grain analyst for Refco Inc. in
Chicago. Because planting of the soybean crop was late this
year, an early frost could damage the crop, which would cause
futures prices to rise.</p>
