	<p class="article-leader">LONDON -- Burmah Castrol PLC, a British petroleum
producing and refining concern, said it sold its 29.7% stake
in Premier Consolidated Oilfields PLC for 138 million pounds
($256.2 million).
   The 139 million shares were sold through British stock
brokers Kleinwort Benson Securities for 99 pence a share,
Burmah said.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Kleinwort Benson refused to comment on whether it has
since sold the shares to investors.</p>
<p>Burmah said it sold the stake to raise cash for investment
in its international marketing of specialized oil and
chemical products. The decision didn't reflect a lack of
confidence in Premier's "long-term prospects," Burmah said.</p>
