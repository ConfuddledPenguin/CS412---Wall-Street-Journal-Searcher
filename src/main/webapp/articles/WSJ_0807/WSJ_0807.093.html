they have certified to the Federal Trade Commission that they
have cooperated with its request to provide additional
information for the proposed merger of the two companies.
   In addition, the companies said they reached an agreement

of the merger until Aug. 31, six days beyond the standard
20-day waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act.</p>
