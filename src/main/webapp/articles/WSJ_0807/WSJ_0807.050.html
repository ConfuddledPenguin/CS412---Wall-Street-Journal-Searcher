	<p class="article-leader">TOKYO -- Sales of imported cars, trucks and buses in Japan
climbed 17.1% in July to 20,304 units from 17,339 units a
year earlier, the Japan Automobile Importers' Association
said. The results mark a record for the month and the 79th
consecutive month of year-to-year increases.
   Import sales have been rising since January 1984. Though
17% growth is high, an association official said,
year-to-year increases have been below 20% so far this year,
which could make it impossible to reach the association's
target of selling 240,000 units in 1990. Japanese dealers
sold 180,000 imported vehicles in 1989.</p>
