	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- By seizing Kuwait, Saddam Hussein has made
himself a possible broker in the U.S.-Iranian dispute over
the six U.S. hostages held in Lebanon by pro-Iranian
kidnappers.
   That's because Iraq now gains control over 15 pro-Iranian
Shiite terrorists who have been imprisoned in Kuwait and
whose freedom has been demanded repeatedly by both the
kidnappers and Iran's government as a condition for releasing
the U.S. hostages.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The Shiite group, members of the pro-Iranian Da'wa party,
includes a brother-in-law of one of the Lebanese
hostage-holders, Imad Mugniyah. Mr. Mugniyah's faction,
Islamic Jihad, or Islamic Holy War, has demanded the release
of the Da'wa prisoners in return for freeing the U.S.
hostages it says it holds, including Terry Anderson, chief
Middle East correspondent of the Associated Press.</p>
<p>Kuwait's charge d'affaires in Jordan, Faisal al-Mukhaizem,
told the Reuters news agency Sunday that the 15 had been
taken to Baghdad Friday. "They are going to use them as
bargaining counters," Reuters quoted the diplomat as saying.
Earlier, ABC News had reported that the men had been freed
during Iraq's invasion of Kuwait.</p>
<p>But U.S. intelligence hasn't been able to confirm either
report or other claims that the prisoners have been executed.
"We just don't know where they are right now," says one State
Department official.</p>
<p>The 15 men are serving sentences for the December 1983
bombings of the U.S. and French embassies and other targets
in Kuwait City that killed six people and injured about 60.</p>
<p>The Kuwaiti ruling family had refused to release the
prisoners, despite recent appeals from Iranian officials
eager to end the hostage crisis in order to rebuild ties to
the West and gain financing for reconstruction in the wake of
their country's war with Iraq. One reason, U.S. officials
say, is that the conservative Kuwaiti rulers agreed with the
U.S. policy of refusing concessions to the hostage-holders.
Another was that the terrorists had tried to overthrow the
Kuwait government and rouse the country's large Shiite
population to rebellion.</p>
<p>U.S. intelligence analysts believe that any
Iraqi-controlled regime could be just as likely as Kuwait to
keep the Shiite prisoners in jail, or even kill them. The
Da'wa party has actively opposed Saddam Hussein's regime and
carried out killings and terrorism within Iraq as well as
Kuwait, with the aim of establishing an Iran-style Islamic
Republic in Baghdad. Saddam Hussein's regime is made up of
minority Sunni Moslems ruling a majority Shiite population.</p>
<p>In addition, Mr. Hussein would be eager to prevent Iran
from ending the hostage crisis and possibly improving
relations with the West.</p>
<p>But Mr. Hussein might also use the prisoners as a
bargaining chip to exercise influence over Iran or the U.S.
He could release them, as Iran wishes, in return for
concessions from Tehran, such as support for his new puppet
regime in Kuwait, whose ruling family was hated in Tehran. Or
he could threaten to execute or harm them, placing the U.S.
hostages in danger of retaliation, in an effort to blackmail
the Bush administration.</p>
<p>For its part, Iran might be prompted to step up its
pressure on the kidnappers to free the six Americans, to
seize an opportunity to gain Western sympathy.</p>
