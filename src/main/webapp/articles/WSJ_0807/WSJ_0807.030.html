	<p class="article-leader">CLEVELAND -- Cleveland-Cliffs Inc. said it expects to post
a third-quarter gain of $15 million, or $1.28 a share, from
the sale of assets.
   The iron ore concern said it entered into an agreement to
sell its forest lands and related assets in Michigan's Upper
Pennisula to Ben Benson, a businessman in Accomac, Va., for
about $25 million. Cleveland-Cliffs, which will retain
mineral interest on the land, said the sale completes its
exit from the forest product business.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>A year earlier, Cleveland-Cliffs earned $16.5 million, or
$1.42 a share, including a $1 million loss from discontinued
operations. Revenue was $95 million.</p>
