	<p class="article-leader">International Business Machines Corp. plans to unveil on
Aug. 21 several new models of its popular AS/400
minicomputer, a product that continues to defy gloomy
predictions, according to industry consultants.
   The new models will be clustered at the low end of the
AS/400 family, the consultants said. They will be easier to
use than previous AS/400s, because IBM also plans to
introduce a new version of the minicomputer's operating
system.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Since its introduction in 1988, the AS/400 has become a
runaway success that contributes about $13 billion a year to
IBM's revenue, producing more than $1 billion in profit,
consultants said. Revenue from the product line increased 19%
in 1989. In the first half of 1990, it grew at a double-digit
rate again, IBM said last week, despite some analysts' fears
that it had started to hit roadblocks.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, the low end of the family has consistently
underperformed IBM's higher-priced AS/400s. Thus, this
month's announcement, which will include an entry-level
minicomputer priced in the $10,000 range, should cheer
skeptics.</p>
<p>Consultants said the easy-to-use machines may help attract
users of a previous IBM minicomputer, the System/36. So far,
System/36 users have resisted moving to the AS/400 because
its operation is more complex and transferring software can
be difficult.</p>
<p>For these prospective customers, identified by consultants
as a potential $20 billion market, the new operating system
will ease users through the more complex aspects of the
AS/400. It also will make connecting to other computers,
including non-IBM machines, easier.</p>
<p>For entry-level minicomputer users, IBM plans to offer a
new version of its AS/Entry, a machine that uses System/36
technology and is incompatible with the rest of the AS/400
family. Unlike its predecessor, however, this computer looks
the same as other AS/400s, and can be upgraded to a regular
AS/400 by replacing a few circuit boards.</p>
<p>IBM also will announce the availability of a speedy,
high-capacity disk drive for all models of the AS/400. These
new drives will replace a slower drive that accounted for at
least $3 billion in revenue last year, said consultant David
Andrews of ADM Inc., Cheshire, Conn.</p>
<p>The disk drive was announced in February for use in IBM's
new RS/6000 workstations. "It's quite exciting technology,
and it's very big business," said Mr. Andrews. Another
technological advance last seen in the RS/6000 -- the
four-megabit memory chip -- will also make its AS/400 debut
on Aug. 21, he added.</p>
<p>An IBM spokeswoman confirmed that the Armonk, N.Y.,
computer giant will make several AS/400 announcements that
will focus on the low end "in the very near future," but
declined to give details.</p>
<p>In an interview last week, Robert LaBant, the new general
manager of IBM's minicomputer operation, also refused to be
specific about the new products. But he and other IBM
executives were unreservedly upbeat about the prospects for
the AS/400, which they said is now entering its "growth
phase."</p>
<p>"We have tremendous demand," Mr. LaBant said. "We're all
working overtime. . . . Demand is going to stay very high."</p>
<p>Mr. LaBant and the other executives sketched out an
impressive first half for the AS/400, which they said
achieved double-digit growth in both revenue and units in the
U.S. World-wide, the AS/400 recorded only single-digit unit
growth, but revenue grew in double digits because sales were
skewed toward the high end. They added that in both the first
and second quarters, AS/400 shipments were
"supply-constrained," meaning machines weren't produced fast
enough to fill orders.</p>
<p>Sales to sites with more than one AS/400 also have done
well, with the installed base doubling since September. Mr.
LaBant said one customer -- identified by consultants as
Allstate Insurance Co., a unit of Sears, Roebuck & Co. -- is
installing "hundreds of AS/400s a month." An Allstate
spokeswoman said she couldn't confirm the report.</p>
<p>Such numbers suggest the AS/400, which many analysts have
predicted will be outflanked by personal computers and
workstations such as the RS/6000, has a long way to go before
it's declared dead.</p>
