	<p class="article-leader">There's at least one silver lining to the tumult in the
Middle East over Saddam Hussein's takeover of Kuwait. For
awhile, we don't have to endure yet more press accounts and
official pronouncements about how the West Bank is the source
of all the problems that attend this region. After the sands

about the area.</p>
