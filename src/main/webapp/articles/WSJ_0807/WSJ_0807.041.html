	<p class="article-leader">The world changed last week. A grandiose Middle East
dictator took control -- not just of a neighboring sheikdom,
but of the West's economic destiny in the 1990s.
   Saddam Hussein, an insular leader who has had almost no
contact with the Western world, nonetheless appears to have
read the West's aversion to military involvement with
unerring accuracy. Indeed, President Bush took four days even
to suggest forcing the eviction of Iraqi invaders from Kuwait
-- and to dispatch his secretary of defense to Saudi Arabia
to seek "permission" to protect that country. The Iraqi
leader effectively has what he wants, for now -- the ability
to dictate world oil prices through the occupation or
intimidation of major Middle East oil producers.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The West is congratulating itself on a rare show of
rhetorical unity, is pledging boycotts of Iraqi-Kuwaiti oil
and is making feeble noises about resisting Iraqi aggression
against "vital interests" in Saudi Arabia, the world's
largest repository of oil. But it all looks to be too little
too late.</p>
<p>Our vital interest is not merely some particular piece of
Middle East real estate. It is the free flow of oil at
tolerable prices. And that already has been lost. Regaining
it is entirely possible -- but only with patience,
persistence and, yes, military power. It is false comfort to
believe that if Saddam Hussein stops at Kuwait, the problem
has been contained. Saddam Hussein certainly is smart enough
to know that he doesn't need to invade Saudi Arabia to
dictate its oil policy; his invasion of Kuwait and the
absence thus far of a serious Western response ensures that
Saudi King Fahd meekly will follow Iraq's line on oil
production and pricing. Saddam is the wolf and Fahd the
sheep. But it is Western consumers who will wind up being
slaughtered.</p>
<p>Just as Western leaders in the late 1930s deluded
themselves in believing that Adolf Hitler's ambitions could
be bought off with one more little piece of Central Europe,
the West today deludes itself in believing that Saddam
Hussein's ambitions end with Kuwait. Whether he chooses to
gobble another oil sheikdom now or later, the Iraqi leader
has an ambition: to rule the Middle East through military
threat, political intimidation and economic might. Barring
Western military action, little stands in his way. Saddam
Hussein used $50 billion in Kuwaiti and Saudi loans over the
past decade to buy weapons he now uses against Kuwait. In
coming years he will use Western money extorted for oil to
buy weapons he uses against future victims.</p>
<p>A West that can't seem to learn the military lessons of
Munich now at least has the possibility of reordering its
flabby political and economic priorities. To begin with,
Americans ought to dispense with the illusion that we now
live in a kinder, gentler world. A multi-polar world with
regional aggressions unrestrained by superpower influence is
going to be a more dangerous and violent age. The end of the
Cold War, in short, will be the beginning of an era of Hot
Wars. One need only watch the Soviets flapping in rhetorical
chorus with the West over Iraq's aggression to realize that
superpower amity has little effect on regional enmity.</p>
<p>As the president and Congress continue to argue over the
degree to which the military budget should be slashed, all
parties owe the American people a greater degree of honesty.
Those seeking to decimate the defense budget ought to at
least grant that it will make America's response to actions
like Saddam Hussein's not just improbable but impossible.</p>
<p>Those, like the president and the Pentagon, who argue for
maintaining military strength legitimately can be asked the
question: Under what circumstances do you ever intend to use
military force? If the military's purpose is to protect
America's vital national interests, surely those amount to
more than rescuing a few score Americans in a Liberian coup.</p>
<p>Military analysts talk of the year it would take to
assemble a ground defense of Saudi Arabia. What, one wonders,
has the Pentagon been doing during the 1980s? If the
proponents of maintaining military strength are correct --
and they are -- then the U.S. response cannot be to wallow in
the experience of Vietnam. If $300 billion buys us a military
capability that truly cannot be employed, then the U.S. would
be better off following the Japanese example and using that
sum to "buy" friends and bribe adversaries.</p>
<p>That's no policy for a great power. But the sad truth in
today's Washington is that the distinction between doves and
hawks comes down to a choice between low-cost or high-cost
appeasement.</p>
<p>In the end, the question is this: what, if not the West's
oil supplies, constitutes a vital national interest? Lest we
forget, it was only 17 years ago that Americans fumed in long
gas lines and the country believed itself hostage to Mideast
oil producers' whims. In 1974, only about 12.3% of America's
oil imports came from the OPEC countries. That figure is now
about 28%.</p>
<p>It may not be part of Saddam Hussein's agenda to put
Americans back in the gas lines. But almost surely it is
within his power. In a recent interview with this newspaper,
the Iraqi leader stated that it was his policy to raise the
price of oil in order to acquire funds to rebuild his
war-exhausted economy. He also said he wanted to acquire
sophisticated weaponry sufficient at least to equal Israel.</p>
<p>Noting that the price of oil was around $14 a barrel, the
president in late June said "this does not represent half of
the real value of the oil price in 1971. Who is responsible
for this injustice? They are some of the Western states and
some of my friends in the region who do not see beyond their
noses. . . . No one can rule out using the economy or the
role of his economy to defend himself."</p>
<p>The West mustn't delude itself about Saddam Hussein's
grand design: dominating oil prices is but a means to
dominating the Middle East. He is no Mideast madman to be
cowed by threats, bought off by bribes or grudgingly
tolerated as a Gadhafi-like nuisance. He is shrewd,
calculating, relentless and ruthless. Most important, he is
vain and amoral, unchecked by any internal or external
inhibitions. He is loyal only to himself. For instance, his
friend and supporter, Jordan's King Hussein, who visited
Baghdad less than 24 hours before the Kuwaiti invasion, was
unwittingly dispatched home to call Mr. Bush and assure him
Saddam Hussein had no intention of military action against
Kuwait.</p>
<p>Over the next days and weeks the world is likely to see
more evidence of Saddam Hussein's calculating character.
Almost certainly, he and his new Kuwaiti puppets will
continue to round up foreigners -- Americans, British, French
-- and threaten their lives if the West seeks to retaliate.
Saddam understands, far better than Americans, the degree to
which Western policy can be made hostage to hostages.</p>
<p>Saddam may even eventually pull some substantial portion
of his forces out of Kuwait. But the Iraqi leader plays for
the long term. He survived an eight-year war with Iran
because he cares nothing for the human costs to his people.
He will count on outlasting any short-term show of Western
resolve.</p>
<p>To a journalist who has spent substantial time in Saudi
Arabia over the past decade, the Saudi reaction in coming
months is fully predictable -- as was Saudi unwillingness
even to condemn strongly the invasion of a fraternal
sheikdom. The Saudi royal family, which numbers some 4,000
princes, has presided over its vast oil reserves by having
only one policy -- an insurance policy that pays protective
premiums to every tough-guy or terrorist in the region. It is
a policy that hopes for the benefits of an American security
blanket without paying the political price of allowing an
American military presence in the kingdom. It is the same
policy that the Kuwaitis pursued. If the Saudis persist, they
almost surely will come to the same end.</p>
<p>The one safe assumption about Saudi reaction these days is
that the princes are fueling their private planes and further
feathering their overseas bank accounts, while whispering to
Saddam Hussein that they will defer to him on oil prices.</p>
<p>For the U.S., the point is not to be deceived by Saddam
Hussein's cunning, deterred by Saudi Arabia's cowardice or
distracted by the inevitably vain search for unified Western
action. America has simply to pursue its own interest -- the
free flow of oil at acceptable prices.</p>
<p>Saddam Hussein now controls oil prices. He must be forced
out of Kuwait and the U.S. must demonstrate its staying power
in the region to preclude future Iraqi intimidation of major
Mideast oil producers. The U.S. must immediately institute a
naval blockade of Iraq, which is the only way to enforce at
least a partially effective boycott of Iraqi-Kuwaiti oil. A
fully effective embargo would require disrupting pipelines
that carry the flow of Iraqi oil through Saudi Arabia and
Turkey. These nations should act immediately to stop those
flows. Anticipating this, Iraq has already sharply reduced
the flow of oil to Turkish pipelines. It is possible Saudi
Arabia might be persuaded by Defense Secretary Richard Cheney
to shut the flow through its country.</p>
<p>Surely, given American air and naval dominance, this level
of immediate military confrontation is feasible and
sustainable. The U.S. is, after all, a nation that once was
willing to institute a naval blockade of Cuba in the face of
Soviet threats of nuclear Armageddon. It is a nation that was
willing to maintain a 15-month military airlift to
beleaguered Berlin. If the rest of the Western world wishes
to assist the U.S. that is good -- but America can't make its
interests hostage to the absence of a Western consensus.</p>
<p>It is of course true that an effective blockade of Iraq
would remove 20% of the world's oil production from the
market, driving prices higher and making a recession more
likely. So be it. American consumers are going to pay higher
prices for their gasoline one way or another. Better to pay
that price as a temporary byproduct of stopping Saddam
Hussein than to pay it in perpetual ransom to a tyrant
holding the global economy hostage.</p>
<p>The time has come to present the Saudis with a simple and
realistic ultimatum: Accept an American military presence
immediately or an Iraqi military domination down the road.
Minimally, the Saudis ought to allow U.S. naval and air
forces to use Saudi ports and airfields and to permit the
prepositioning of materiel for a possible land defense of the
kingdom.</p>
<p>If the Saudis decline U.S. help now, it will make their
own demise that much more likely. It also will make U.S.
military intervention in the region that much more difficult
-- but in the end, no less inevitable. For all of today's
flapping and dawdling, for all the concern over diplomatic
niceties and military difficulties, the handwriting is on the
wall. Whether this month, next year or somewhere in the
1990s, this country will conclude that the world's oil
supplies and its own economic destiny simply cannot be
subject to the whim of a single Middle East despot. The U.S.
will have to act for its own self-preservation.</p>
