	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- The New York Mercantile Exchange raised
margins on energy futures after trading ended yesterday.
   Margins, the good-faith deposits necessary to buy or sell
contracts, were increased by $1,000 on crude oil and
petroleum products to stand at $4,500 for customers and
$4,000 for clearing members. Natural gas margins rose to
$2,500 for customers and $2,000 for clearing members, also a
$1,000 jump.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>This is the exchange's second round of energy margin
increases since Iraq's invasion of Kuwait last week sent
world petroleum prices skyward.</p>
<p>"When the markets are volatile, we increase the amount of
money people have to put down," a spokeswoman for the
exchange said. "It's a question of protection."</p>
