	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- The former top trader of Jefferies & Co. and
another senior trader agreed to six-month suspensions from
the securities industry to settle civil charges of
securities-law violations in major Wall Street cases.
   The two settlements wrap up major loose ends from
Jefferies & Co. Chairman Boyd Jefferies's decision to
cooperate with the government. Mr. Jefferies, who has been
barred from the securities industry for life for his role in
several illegal stock transactions, is eligible to apply for
reinstatement in 1992.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Jefferies's ex-trading director James Melton and Senior
Vice President Michael Landy settled the Securities and
Exchange Commission charges without admitting or denying
guilt. Both men cooperated with federal prosecutors under
immunity from criminal prosecution but had no such agreement
with the SEC against any civil action. The agency noted in
the settlement agreements, however, that the suspensions were
shorter than they would have been if the men hadn't
cooperated.</p>
<p>Mr. Melton was a witness in the recent stock-manipulation
conviction of GAF Corp. and James Sherwin, its vice chairman.
In 1986, the company and Mr. Sherwin asked Mr. Jefferies to
boost the stock price of Union Carbide Corp. before the sale
of a large block of Carbide stock, according to testimony at
the trial. In return, GAF and Mr. Sherwin agreed to indemnify
Jefferies, a Los Angeles brokerage firm, against any loss in
the stock trading.</p>
<p>The SEC also said that when Jefferies bought the shares,
it did so in its own name, concealing that GAF was the actual
owner of the stock. Jefferies had losses of about $40,000 in
the transactions, which was to be paid by GAF through a plan
devised to conceal the true reason for the payment, the
agency said. But that check was never sent, Mr. Jefferies
said at the criminal trial, because a few days later Ivan
Boesky was indicted on insider-trading charges. Mr. Boesky's
testimony to prosecutors eventually led to Mr. Jefferies's
plea agreement and subsequent assistance.</p>
<p>Mr. Melton, as the firm's head trader, was the firm's
liaison with Mr. Sherwin, the SEC said. He handled the buying
and selling of the Carbide shares, making sure that his
purchases were the last of the day so that they would keep
the stock price high, the agency added. After the purchases,
he would call Mr. Sherwin to inform him of the transactions,
the SEC said.</p>
<p>Mr. Jefferies, who also entered a plea agreement with
federal prosecutors, was the star witness in the GAF trial.</p>
<p>An attorney for Mr. Melton, Michael Klowden, said his
client "was disappointed that the commission decided to take
this action in light of the fact that {Mr. Melton}
voluntarily came forward and cooperated. His decision to
settle the matter was to get it behind him." He said Mr.
Melton, who left Jefferies last year, has returned to school.</p>
<p>In the other case, Mr. Landy was a key witness in the
recent securities-fraud conviction of former Singer Co.
Chairman Paul Bilzerian last year. As a Jefferies senior vice
president, Mr. Landy helped the investor "park" stock, or
hold shares for Mr. Bilzerian to conceal their true
ownership.</p>
<p>In three separate deals between May 1985 and September
1986, Mr. Bilzerian asked Mr. Landy to buy stakes in Cluett,
Peabody & Co., H.H. Robertson Inc. and Armco Inc., according
to the SEC. The agency said that Mr. Landy purchased the
blocks and was protected from any loss by Mr. Bilzerian, who
has since been convicted on criminal charges and sentenced to
four years in prison.</p>
<p>Mr. Landy's attorney, Michael Mitchell, said, "Mr. Landy
chose to settle this matter rather than to litigate it
because of the cost in both time and money." But Mr. Mitchell
expressed anger over the handling of his client's case. "It
is a sad day when one branch of the government uses immunized
testimony for its benefit and then, when the witness's
usefulness has ceased, another branch of government turns on
the witness and sanctions him."</p>
<p>Mr. Mitchell said that Mr. Landy will remain at Jefferies
for about two weeks.</p>
