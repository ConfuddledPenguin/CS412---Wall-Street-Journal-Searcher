	<p class="article-leader">LOS ANGELES -- An investor has sued Management Co.
Entertainment Group Inc. and five of its current and former
officers and directors for allegedly issuing misleading
statements and failing to disclose the company's precarious
financial condition.
   Elfriede Glancy, in a complaint that seeks class action
status in federal court here, charged that the entertainment
company failed to disclose that it was struggling to avoid
bankruptcy and was having trouble arranging financing.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The suit claims the company's problems were not reflected
in its 1989 annual report and its 10-K report to the
Securities and Exchange Commission. Officials at MCEG weren't
available for comment.</p>
<p>The suit alleges that MCEG failed to report that it would
not be able to adequately fund and operate its business after
a proposed acquisition of distributor Virgin Vision Ltd. for
approximately $83 million.</p>
<p>MCEG said in July that it was negotiating a standstill
agreement with G.E. Capital, a unit of General Electric Co.
in connection with $72.5 million in loans that are past due.
The company borrowed that amount as part of its financing for
the acquisition last year of Virgin Vision, an independent
movie television and video distributor.</p>
<p>The company said it is currently working on restructuring
those loans. However, in a July filing with the Securities
and Exchange Commission, the company said if it is unable to
reach an agreement on restructuring the loans, it could be
required to seek protection from creditors under federal
bankruptcy laws.</p>
<p>The suit seeks unspecified compensatory and punitive
damages.</p>
