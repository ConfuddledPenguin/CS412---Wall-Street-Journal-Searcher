	<p class="article-leader">TOKYO -- It may be time to scrap the image of the loyal,
hard-working Japanese employee.
   Lifetime employment? At one of Japan's largest insurance
companies, Dai-Ichi Mutual Life Insurance Co., only
two-thirds of new male recruits expect to finish their
careers there. Indeed, after only two months on the job,
nearly a third already have contemplated quitting.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Truthful? Four in 10 new male workers at the insurance
company say they would lie to cover up the fact that they
overslept on a weekday. For most, the biggest change in their
lives resulting from their new jobs was having to get up
early.</p>
<p>These tradition-shattering findings are contained in a
survey the company recently conducted of more than 300 new
recruits. The results were published in the employee
newsletter at Dai-Ichi, one of Japan's major employers with a
sales force of more than 60,000.</p>
<p>Dai-Ichi has surveyed new employees before, but always
about themselves, a spokesman says. This was the first time
they were asked their views about working and the company.</p>
<p>To some extent, the employees say, their answers reflect
changes in Japan. When young recruits start work, says Koji
Noda, a 22-year-old who joined Dai-Ichi in April, they
discovered "they have to do things they didn't or couldn't
see in the company's PR brochure."</p>
<p>To be sure, many of the survey's findings confirm
stereotypes about office workers in Japan. For example, new
male employees at the insurance company are most interested
in automobiles, while new women recruits mostly want to
travel. The men would prefer to get married at age 30, the
women at 25.</p>
<p>More surprising, perhaps, was the finding that workaholic
Japanese men aren't always as hard-working as their so-called
office lady counterparts. Only a third of the men said they
would stay at work if a boss asked them to put in overtime on
an evening when they had a date scheduled. Forty-one percent
of the women said they would labor for the company in those
circumstances.</p>
