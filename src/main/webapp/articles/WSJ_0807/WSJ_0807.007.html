	<h3>UAL Buy-Out May Be Further Snarled By Soaring Oil Prices, Fears of Recession</h3>

	<p class="article-leader">Skyrocketing oil prices and rising recession fears have
further darkened already dim prospects of a $4.38 billion,
$201-a-share union-led buy-out of United Airlines parent UAL
Corp.
   UAL stock plunged $12.50 to $110 a share yesterday -- its
lowest level since early 1989 -- in composite trading on the
New York Stock Exchange only two days before UAL's board
meets to decide whether to extend Thursday's financing
deadline.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Although banks were still trying to round up loan
commitments before the board meeting, many traders have
concluded that the acquisition has, as one put it, "big, big
problems."</p>
<p>People familiar with the buy-out said Security Pacific
Corp. has joined Bankers Trust New York Corp. and
Manufacturers Hanover Corp. as lead banks for the
acquisition, following last week's withdrawal of three other
banks from the core bank group.</p>
<p>One unconfirmed report said the banks are making a
last-ditch attempt to gain loan commitments for about $2.5
billion, an amount reduced from an earlier target of roughly
$4 billion. Banks have been asked to give their commitments
today, before the UAL board meets, the report said. None of
the banks involved would comment.</p>
<p>But the prospects for the buy-out have deteriorated
steadily for the past six days. Between Monday and Wednesday
of last week, UAL stock fell $27.125, to $135.875, when three
major banks balked at participating. Since Iraq invaded
Kuwait Thursday, the stock has fallen a further $25.875.</p>
<p>Timothy Pettee, an airline analyst at Merrill Lynch & Co.,
said the run-up in oil prices so far is enough to boost the
price of jet fuel to 80 cents a gallon from its prewar level
of about 60 cents -- a 33% increase. He said that could
translate to an increase of roughly $400 million in UAL's
annual jet-fuel bill, which last year totaled $1.35 billion.
UAL's total costs are currently about $10.3 billion a year.</p>
<p>Although some other airline analysts said United's fuel
bill might rise as little as $150 million annually, any
increase is bound to have a significant impact on the
airline's profit. Last year, UAL earned $324.2 million, or
$14.96 a share. This year, Mr. Pettee predicts that if fuel
prices remain at their current levels, profit could tumble to
$7 a share.</p>
<p>Helane Becker, airline analyst at Lehman Brothers, said,
"If we thought {the buy-out} was shaky before, this makes it
much more shaky. I think the banks are going to be a whole
lot more nervous about lending than they were six weeks ago
or even six days ago."</p>
<p>There has been speculation that the union group may
restructure its offer, which currently includes $155 a share
in cash and $35 a share in notes, plus a security tied to a
sale of an interest in United's computer reservation system.</p>
<p>Reducing the cash component of the bid and increasing the
amount of notes would enable the buy-out group to use less
debt. But it's unclear whether the UAL board would approve. A
spokesman for the buy-out group, which is also seeking junior
financing from the airline's suppliers and other sources,
wouldn't comment.</p>
<p>At its meeting tomorrow, the board is considered likely to
grant an extension of perhaps 30 to 60 days for the buy-out
group to continue to seek financing. The group is led by
United's pilots and machinists unions, and includes flight
attendants and non-contract employees.</p>
<p>However, the group faces a far more hostile climate in
which to complete the financing than it had in the first four
months since the UAL board accepted its offer April 9 under
the threat of a proxy fight.</p>
<p>At its current level, analysts say United's stock isn't
far from the level at which it would trade on fundamentals
alone, without any chance of an acquisition. Until the
Mideast oil crisis raised the specter of a recession, that
level was considered to be $90 to $120 a share. Now, with
UAL's projected earnings falling amid concerns about a
recession, the range is closer to $70 to $100.</p>
<p>If anything, some traders believe the Mideast crisis will
give the UAL unions a convenient excuse for falling short on
financing they wouldn't have been able to obtain anyway. Even
before, banks were reluctant to make loans for leveraged
buy-outs and had qualms about lending to a union-controlled
enterprise.</p>
<p>But what isn't clear is how United can extricate itself
from a limbo in which the pilots, which first bid for United
in 1987, keep making acquisition attempts but keep falling
short. Mr. Pettee said, "This has been a three-year ordeal,
and I wouldn't be surprised if it goes on for another three
years."</p>
