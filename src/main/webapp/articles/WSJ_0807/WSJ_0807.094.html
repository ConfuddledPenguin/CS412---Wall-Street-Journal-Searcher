	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- The U.S. subsidiary of Nomura Securities Co.
will be fined $180,000 and censured by the New York Stock
Exchange for alleged violations of exchange rules, according
to people familiar with the case.
   A hearing is scheduled for today to examine a settlement
surrounding allegations that Nomura Securities International
Inc., the U.S. unit of the giant Japanese securities firm in
1987 violated net capital requirements. These involve
situations where a firm allows its net capital to fall below
levels prescribed by the exchange.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>People familiar with the case said the violations were
relatively small, involving several hundred thousand dollars.</p>
<p>As in most disciplinary cases, Nomura will settle without
admitting or denying wrongdoing, according to individuals
familiar with the case. A Nomura spokesman declined to
comment; so did an exchange spokeswoman.</p>
<p>While not the biggest fine, the penalty would be one of
the steepest leveled against a Big Board member firm. Since
1987, the exchange and other "self-regulators" of the markets
have been under increased pressure to impose stiffer fines
for violators of market rules.</p>
<p>Last month, the New York Stock Exchange censured American
Express Co.'s Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc. unit and fined it
a record $500,000 in a case involving Shearson's trading of
E.F. Hutton & Co. stock during 1986 takeover talks.</p>
