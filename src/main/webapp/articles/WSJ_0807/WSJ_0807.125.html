	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Transwood Consortium Fund, a British
investment partnership, said it plans to buy what is left of
former proxy solicitor Don Carter's business.
   Mr. Carter in the mid-1980s built up a profitable business
helping figures such as T. Boone Pickens wage proxy fights.
But Mr. Carter's own finances came under investigation by New
York state last year. Mr. Carter resigned from his firm, then
known as the Carter Organization, and last winter pleaded
guilty to grand larceny and tax evasion charges.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Mr. Carter's former business, currently known as Quorum
Communications Inc., employs 70 people, down from its peak of
140. Quorum is at "break-even," according to Peter Earl, a
Transwood executive leading the acquisition proposal.</p>
<p>Mr. Earl said Transwood plans to pay 7.1 million pounds
($13.1 million) to buy Quorum and its British parent, VPI
Group PLC.</p>
