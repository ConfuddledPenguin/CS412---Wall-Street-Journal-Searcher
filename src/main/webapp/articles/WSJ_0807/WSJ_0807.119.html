	<p class="article-leader">J.C. Penney Co. said its business services unit signed a
"major" five-year contract to continue providing
point-of-sale authorization of credit cards to Amoco Oil Co.
   Terms of the contract weren't disclosed. But J.C. Penney
Business Services Inc. is the largest provider of
point-of-sale authorization services to the petroleum
industry, and Amoco accounts for 13% of all retail outlets
that use the Penney system.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The original contract had a term of three years, with an
option to renew for two years. But with the first three years
expired, Amoco chose to renew for five.</p>
<p>In a related agreement, Dallas-based Penney said its J.C.
Penney National Bank will continue to provide settlement for
all Visa and MasterCard bank card purchases made at 3,000
Amoco service stations.</p>
