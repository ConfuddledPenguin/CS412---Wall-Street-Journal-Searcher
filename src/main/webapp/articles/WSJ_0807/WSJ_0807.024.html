	<p class="article-leader">SAN FRANCISCO -- Philip Woodward's story is a vintage tale
of boutique wine making by nouveau Californians of the 1970s.
And, while it's too soon to report a happy ending, the smooth
aging of Chalone Inc. belies the downbeat cast of the
domestic industry.
   Mr. Woodward, a Northwestern University MBA, was
transferred to the Bay Area in 1970 by Touche Ross to run a
small-business consultancy. In Detroit previously, he'd
developed an appreciation of the grape, so he gravitated
toward the emerging wineries of his new region. Robert
Mondavi, an early and still prominent figure, was a client.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The most fateful association, however, was with Richard
Graff, a Harvard music major whose family had bought 30 acres
of vines in the mountains above the Salinas Valley. There it
made Chalone wines in a former chicken coop, but Mr. Woodward
had a business plan with bigger ideas. In summer 1972 he quit
the accounting firm, plunging from atop the Alcoa Building
into a basement office on Sutter Street.</p>
<p>With Mr. Graff as chairman and Mr. Woodward as president
and CEO, Chalone has established itself as an independent but
publicly held producer. Although small ($13 million in annual
sales) in relation to the Gallos of the industry it is one of
only two pure U.S. wine plays in the stock market. (The other
is Canandaigua of New York state.)</p>
<p>Chalone -- which now also has the Carmenet, Acacia and
Edna Valley wineries in California -- reports a sales rise of
14% in dollar terms, 10% in case volume for the first half of
1990 vs. the 1989 period. This marks a return to strong
growth after stillness last year. Why is the company bucking
the industry trend?</p>
<p>Because, as Mr. Woodward and other insiders are quick to
suggest, no one trend exists. "I don't think there is a wine
industry anymore, just like there's no real automobile
industry or computer industry anymore," he says. "It's so
segmented." Although the U.S. wine market has declined by
more than 10% since 1986, expensive varietals have continued
steadily upward. Buyers are out there, but the competition is
getting tougher. Gallo is moving upscale in a big way.
Several of the quality California wineries -- Beaulieu,
Beringer, Clos du Bois -- have been bought by big beverage
marketers. Mondavi has teamed with Mouton-Rothschild of
France to produce the Opus One cabernet blend.</p>
<p>Chalone has a foreign combination of its own, with
Domaines Barons de Rothschild (Lafite), that entails
cross-ownership, shared distribution channels and a $12
Lafite wine to be marketed by Chalone in the U.S. The
alliance is key to Mr. Woodward's plan to expand overseas. He
likens his company to "all the best chateaus in France.
They're already in these markets throughout the world -- why
shouldn't we be?" Sales abroad should account for 7% of the
company's gross this year (up from 1% three years ago) and
Mr. Woodward hopes to hit 20% in five years. Trade barriers
haven't been a significant problem except in Canada, where
the recent liberalization pact should help.</p>
<p>In the U.S., he looks most to Florida for growth, as the
state attracts affluent retirees from strong Eastern markets.
But California is king, still accounting for 65% of the
company's total volume.</p>
<p>Yet California may be turning to vinegar for wine
producers. John De Luca, president of the San Francisco-based
Wine Institute, is still grousing about the "reproductive
toxicant" warning signs that the state's Proposition 65
required for alcohol sales, and he's trying to fight another
ballot measure this fall that would impose a $1.29 a gallon
tax on wine (the industry is sponsoring a competing item that
would set a lower levy). But the biggest and most uncertain
political peril is the so-called Big Green initiative, also
in November, to restrict vastly the use of agricultural
chemicals. It could be a corker, as sulfur compounds are
universally used to keep grapes from mildewing on the vines.</p>
<p>Chalone may be as vulnerable to that latest environmania
as others in the business, but Mr. Woodward finds that as a
top-end seller (80% of his wine this year will retail for
more than $14 a bottle) his operation isn't as susceptible to
per-volume tax hikes and anti-drinking campaigns. Still, it
isn't healthful for the industry to have U.S. per-capita
consumption remain a third or less of that in several
European and South American countries. The entry-level market
matters.</p>
<p>"New consumers aren't going to start off drinking Chalone
Chardonnay at $25, but they're going to drink white
zinfandel, and hopefully some of those would eventually drink
the products that we make," he says. "I don't think these
labeling laws do anything to help that. A lot of people are
still confused about what `contains sulfites' means."</p>
<p>However, "consumers who drink our wines are sophisticated
enough to look at that and almost makes jokes of it like they
do in Europe." It's no laughing matter at the French border,
however, where he says such notices are forbidden. For a
while, Chalone blocked out the sulfites warning on every
bottle; now it includes it on a rear label that is omitted
from overseas shipments.</p>
<p>Foreign standards come into play in another way in Mr.
Woodward's import arrangement. Recently the Food and Drug
Administration began impounding such shipments because a
suspect Japanese fertilizer was used in some French
vineyards. "We can't do anything with it until they do this
long inspection," he beefs.</p>
<p>He treats the fetal-alcohol syndrome scare more seriously,
admitting "there's a lot of evidence {pregnant women} should
abstain. On the other hand, my wife drank wine right up to
the day she had our twins, and we have two great kids there."</p>
<p>Generally, Chalone plans to stick to the premium market,
but the Lafite arrangement has given it a stake in a Chilean
winery, a hot source of bargains these days. "You can buy a
cabernet from Chile in the supermarket at $4.99," Mr.
Woodward says. "It's really tough to find anything made in
this country at that price that's anywhere near that quality.
A lot of that's got to be labor costs."</p>
<p>In-country but out of state, Chalone's found value in 200
acres in Washington's Columbia Valley. The land cost $750 an
acre vs. $15,000 to $25,000 in California, and by 1993 should
be producing a merlot the company will call Canoe Ridge.</p>
<p>So Chalone will grow in its niche. For Mr. Woodward,
tieless on an average workday but around to pick up the
company phone himself after 6 p.m., it's the payoff from
"knocking on doors" to find the first few hundred investors.
At 51, he claims no desire to sell, saying he doesn't even
pay attention to the capital-gains tax. He'd just like to be
back in the old Folger's Building two blocks down Howard
Street. The company had to flee after last year's earthquake,
but even now in modern surroundings he decries as "like being
in Houston," it's a long way from being a CPA -- and from the
basement. At Touche Ross, "they thought I was absolutely
crazy" to leave. Here's to insanity.</p>
