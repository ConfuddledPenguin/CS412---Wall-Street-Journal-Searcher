	<p class="article-leader">THE COURSE OF MONETARY UNION</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The monetary and economic unification of the two Germanys
has been progressing smoothly since its start on July 1, West
German Finance Minister Theo Waigel was reported as saying in
an interview with the newspaper Die Welt.</p>
<p>Monetary union "on balance just a few weeks after it began
is without doubt positive," Mr. Waigel was quoted as saying.</p>
<p>In the interview, Mr. Waigel noted that the
consumer-buying explosion that had been feared prior to the
monetary union hasn't occurred; rather, East Germans have
shown a tendency toward saving.</p>
<p>Mr. Waigel reportedly noted that East Germans are taking
advantage of a "building savings account," which enables them
to save toward building or buying a home under favorable
conditions.</p>
<p>NO BIG MACS NEAR SEOUL PARK</p>
<p>A plan to open a McDonald's franchise next to Olympic Park
in southern Seoul was rejected because of public concern
about commercialization of the historic facility, municipal
officials said. The outlet was built last month, but its
opening had been delayed pending city approval. The fast-food
restaurant is about 100 feet from the six-story Gate of World
Peace at the main entrance to the park, which was the
centerpiece of the 1988 Seoul Olympics.</p>
<p>JAPANESE SPEED LIMITS</p>
<p>Motorists will be able to drive at speeds of up to 85
miles an hour by the next century on two planned expressways
in central and western Japan, a Japanese news agency
reported. The current top speed limit on Japanese highways is
65 miles an hour. In addition to the new speed limit on the
sparsely populated mountainous parts of the new No. 2 Tomei
Expressway linking Tokyo with Nagoya and the Nagoya-Kobe
Expressway, the limit will also be increased to 65 from 50
miles per hour in urban areas, the Construction Ministry
reportedly said. Construction of the expressways will begin
in 1992, for completion in the early 21st century, the news
agency said.</p>
<p>PEACE CORPS IN THE PHILIPPINES</p>
<p>The U.S. plans to bring back its Peace Corps volunteers to
the Philippines and would consult the Philippine military on
safe places for postings, U.S. Ambassador Nicholas Platt
said. Mr. Platt accompanied Peace Corps worker Timothy
Swanson to a meeting with President Corazon Aquino yesterday,
four days after communist guerrillas freed Mr. Swanson from
50 days captivity. The U.S. ordered the withdrawal of all
Peace Corps volunteers from the country in June.</p>
<p>SUZUKI TRAINS SOUTH KOREANS</p>
<p>South Korea's Daewoo Group will send employees to Japan
this year for training with Suzuki Motor Co., the Japanese
company said. Daewoo initiated the training program to expand
its experience in production of minicars, a Suzuki spokesman
said. Daewoo will begin building the compact vehicles at a
new factory later this year. The employees will spend one to
two months with Suzuki.</p>
<p>PORTUGAL'S MONETARY POLICY</p>
<p>The Bank of Portugal may impose new curbs on
foreign-capital inflows, Vice President Antonio Borges
reportedly said. "We are forced to pursue a tight monetary
policy with consequences for Portuguese investment, while the
main reason behind monetary growth is the inflow of foreign
capital," the central-bank official was quoted by the Diario
de Noticias newspaper as saying. Officials of the bank are
worried that capital inflows, which totaled $4 billion in the
first six months of 1990, are fueling an inflation rate that
now stands at over 13%.</p>
<p>VIETNAMESE RICE CRISIS</p>
<p>Vietnam has been exporting so much rice that in the last
month domestic prices for the staple have doubled in Ho Chi
Minh City and some provinces, Radio Hanoi reported.</p>
<p>Exporters "have rushed to the city to buy up all the rice
available," Vietnam's official radio said. "This has given
the people the impression that there is a scarcity of rice,
thus prompting many families to buy rice to keep in reserve."
The report gave no price figures.</p>
<p>Officials are trying to control rice prices by banning
sales to unauthorized exporters and placing one agency in
charge of buying and selling grain within Ho Chi Minh City,
formerly Saigon, the radio report said. Vietnam exported 1.15
million tons of rice in the first six months of 1990, double
its exports for the same period last year.</p>
<p>Vietnam went from food shortages in 1988 to become the
world's third-largest rice exporter last year. Economic
reforms have given farmers incentives by allowing them to
keep more profits.</p>
<p>POSTSCRIPTS . . .</p>
<p>The World Health Organization urged that all passenger
aircraft institute a smoking ban. "We are now calling for all
airlines to be smoke-free. We think it's sensible, we think
it's possible and we think the airlines would support it,"
said a WHO official. . . . A trial program by Hong Kong's
Mass Transit Railway Corp. to add Japanese-language train
announcements to existing announcements in Cantonese and
English was cut short following a negative response from
passengers, a Japanese news agency reported. "People said
that Hong Kong is not a Japanese community, and we shouldn't
cater for a minority, or upgrade the status of Japanese
people," an MTR official was quoted as saying.</p>
