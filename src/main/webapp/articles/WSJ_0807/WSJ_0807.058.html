	<p class="article-leader">PARIS -- Airbus Industrie said Mexicana de Aviacion signed
a contract to buy 22 of the European aircraft consortium's
A-320 commercial jets and take options on an additional 14
planes, firming up a commitment that was announced in May.
   Financial details of the order weren't disclosed, but
people in the industry estimate the price of one Airbus A-320
jet, without spare parts or training, at $40 million.
Delivery of the jets is scheduled to begin during the second
half of 1991.</p>
