	<p class="article-leader">LONDON -- New car sales in Britain in July fell 11% from a
year earlier and, largely because of seasonal factors,
declined 68% from June, the Society of Motor Manufacturers
and Traders Ltd. said.
   Sales of passenger vehicles, as measured by new car
registrations, dropped to 45,707 in July from 51,093 in July
1989 and 142,697 in June.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Imports in July accounted for 49% of the market, compared
with 55% in June and 52% in July 1989. The latest month's
figures represent the first time since July 1987 that
domestically produced cars outsold imports in the British
market.</p>
