	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Eastern Airlines and eight of its top managers
pleaded not guilty to federal charges that they failed to
perform mandatory maintenance on the carrier's planes and
falsified related records.
   A federal grand jury in Brooklyn indicted Eastern and nine
current and former management employees last month. One of
the managers pleaded guilty July 30.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The 60-count indictment charged that some employees
engaged in "pencil whipping," or signing off on work that
wasn't performed, at Eastern's maintenance bases at John F.
Kennedy International Airport and La Guardia Airport in New
York and Hartsfield International Airport in Atlanta.</p>
<p>Eastern currently is being overseen by a trustee appointed
by the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Manhattan, where the company
filed a petition under Chapter 11 of federal bankruptcy law
in March.</p>
