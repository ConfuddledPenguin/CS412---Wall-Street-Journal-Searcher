	<p class="article-leader">Once upon a time, when the idea of a National Endowment
for the Arts was under consideration, I had some lively
arguments with my conservative friends. I supported the idea,
they opposed it. Their opposition was based on the simple and
straightforward principle that the state had no business
involving itself in this area, which should be left to
private philanthropy. I argued that it would be good for our
democracy if it showed an official interest in educating the
tastes and refining the aesthetic sensibilities of its
citizenry.
   I won the argument and now wish I hadn't. They were more
right than, at the time, they could know.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>In retrospect, I can see that my error derived from the
fact that I really had only a superficial understanding of
what was happening in the arts world and no understanding of
what this portended for the future evolution of what we now
call "the arts community." I was raised in a generation that
was taught to appreciate the virtues of modern art, from
Renoir to Picasso and even to Jackson Pollock and "abstract
expressionism," though I had to admit that this last stage
had no appeal to me. "Pop art" and "minimalist art" I tended
to dismiss as trendy fads.</p>
<p>But what I was utterly unprepared for was the emergence of
what is now called "post-modern art," which is a politically
charged art that is utterly contemptuous of the notion of
educating the tastes and refining the aesthetic sensibilities
of the citizenry. Its goal, instead, is deliberately to
outrage those tastes and to trash the very idea of an
"aesthetic sensibility."</p>
<p>It is very difficult to convey to people who do not follow
the weird goings-on in our culture an appreciation of the
animating agenda of the "arts community" today. An ordinary
American reads about a woman "performing artist" who prances
nude across the stage, with chocolate smeared over her body,
and though he may lament the waste of chocolate or nudity, it
does not occur to him that she is "making a statement," one
that the "arts community" takes seriously indeed.</p>
<p>Even museum trustees in Washington, D.C., or Cincinnati --
an elite, educated, and affluent group of arts
philanthropists -- had no idea what Mapplethorpe was up to in
his photograph of a man with a bullwhip handle inserted into
his rectum. All they knew is that Mapplethorpe was a very
talented photographer (which he was), that no such talent
could ever create an obscene work (which is false) and that
any discriminating judgment on their part was a form of
censorship that verged on the sacrilegious. Those trustees
are there to raise money and watch the museum's balance
sheet. They may or may not know what they like, but they
would never presume to assert what is, or is not, "art." To
qualify to become a museum trustee these days one must first
suffer aesthetic castration.</p>
<p>To reach our current condition, it took a century of
"permanent revolution" in the arts, made possible,
ironically, by a capitalist economy which created affluent
art collectors and entrepreneurial art dealers. "Patrons" of
the arts were replaced by "consumers" of the arts, giving the
artist an intoxicating freedom.</p>
<p>It was the artist, now, who told us what was and was not
"art" -- not the patron, or the philosopher, or the public.
The function of the spectator was to welcome revolutions in
taste by permitting himself to be intimidated and
indoctrinated by the "arts community," consisting of artists
themselves but also and especially (since artists are not
usually articulate) art critics, art professors, art dealers,
museum directors, etc. The most important spectators who were
so intimidated and indoctrinated were the media, which now
automatically approach anything declared to be "art" by the
"arts community" with the kind of deference, even
pseudo-piety, once reserved for the sphere of religion.</p>
<p>As with most revolutions, some impressive creative
energies were released, some enduring accomplishments were
achieved. But, again as with most revolutions, the longer it
lasted the more the destructive impulse began to dominate
over the creative. Yesteryear's creative contributions were,
after all, what the latest revolutionary phase had to subvert
and overthrow.</p>
<p>After World War II, it became ever more difficult to
distinguish artists from publicity-hungry pseudo-artists,
from people "making statements" of one kind or other, such
"statements" being the essence of pop art, minimalist art,
environmental art, and now post-modern art. That practically
all of this activity was infused by an anti-bourgeois ethos
was unsurprising, since it was simply mirroring the literary
and academic culture in this respect. The bourgeois way of
coping with this situation was to purchase and "consume" this
art as a commodity, to inventory it and then at some point to
expel it from its system into an underground sump, usually
located in the basement of museums. Cooptation, not
censorship, was the strategy.</p>
<p>But this strategy does not work with the last and, one
suspects, final phase of the revolution we are now
witnessing. Today, the destructive element has almost
completely overwhelmed the creative. What the "arts
community" is engaged in is a politics of radical nihilism;
it has little interest in, and will openly express contempt
for, "art" in any traditional sense of the term. It is no
exaggeration to say that the self-destruction of "art" is a
key point in its agenda, accompanied by the "deconstruction,"
not only of bourgeois society, but of Western civilization
itself.</p>
<p>"Deconstruction" is an intellectual-ideological movement
that is enormously popular in the humanities departments of
our universities, which seek to free themselves from the
"hegemony" of Dead White Males (DWMs is the common reference)
such as Shakespeare or Dante so as to justify offering a
university course on, say, the TV program "The Simpsons."
There are no standards of excellence other than those we
improvise for ourselves, which is why members of the "arts
community" can solemnly believe and assert that whatever they
do is "art." The public has the right -- nay, the obligation
-- to support it, but not to question it.</p>
<p>What they do, in fact, is powerfully shaped by certain
radical ideological currents; radical feminism, homosexual
and lesbian self-celebration and black racism are among them.
This explains why, though it is "de rigeur" to insult public
figures, no one in the "arts community" would ever dare
insult the Rev. Louis Farrakhan. Any such painting would
promptly be vandalized, to the applause of an "arts
community" opposed to censorship. It also explains why there
is so little pornography, in the traditional sense, in
post-modern art. Such pornography evokes lust for
heterosexual engagement, which post-modern art disapproves of
since it is thought to debase women. Only homosexual and
lesbian sex are allowed to be celebrated.</p>
<p>But if pornography is limited to the homosexual sphere,
obscenity is unlimited. The purpose of such obscenity is to
deride the Judaeo-Christian-humanist idea of "human dignity"
that Western civilization has fostered. If Western
civilization is itself an obscene heritage of racism, sexism
and "elitist" oppression, obscenity is obviously an
appropriate response.</p>
<p>Where will it all end? One does have the sense that we are
witnessing either a final convulsion in the history of modern
art (and of modern culture) or, perhaps, a final convulsion
in Western civilization itself. Most of us would incline to
credit the first alternative. But where does that leave the
National Endowment for the Arts, founded in a different time
and on quite different assumptions about the role of the arts
in American life?</p>
<p>The most obvious response would be to abolish the NEA --
perhaps over a period of a few years to mitigate the
financial shock. This is not going to happen, however. After
all, many major institutions -- symphony orchestras, for
instance, and large museums -- have inevitably become
dependent on NEA grants. The trustees of these institutions
have considerable influence with members of Congress, who are
much happier opening funding spigots than closing them. And
the media, it goes without saying, would be horrified at such
an effort at "censorship," now redefined to include the
absence of government funding.</p>
<p>A more limited response would be to move the NEA away from
involvement with the most active and turbulent sectors of the
"arts community" by requiring that it make only grants of
more than $50,000 or $100,000. The institutions receiving
this money will be held responsible for any re-grants they
make.</p>
<p>Most of the controversial grants one hears of are
small-to-modest. But they do serve an important role in
legitimating the activity that is being funded. With $10,000
from the NEA, an "experimental workshop in the arts" can
approach foundations and corporations with a plausible claim
to respectability. That is precisely why they will fight
tooth and nail for the continuation of the small-grants
program -- grants made by other members of the "arts
community," their "peer groups," to their friends and allies.
Just how Congress will respond to such a reform, now being
bruited, remains to be seen.</p>
<p>But one interesting and important fact has already become
clear: Our politics today is so spiritually empty, so morally
incoherent, that -- except for a few brave souls -- liberals
have been quick to dismiss as "yahoos" anyone who dares to
confront this assault on the foundations of liberalism and
conservatism alike. A great many conservatives, for their
part, having long ago been ideologically disarmed, are more
embarrassed than interested at having to cope with this issue
at all. Something is definitely rotten in the vital areas of
our body politic.</p>
