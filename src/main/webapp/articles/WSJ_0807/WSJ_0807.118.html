	<p class="article-leader">Schering AG of West Germany, a pharmaceutical and chemical
company, said first-half profit rose 12% to 182 million marks
($114.3 million) from 162 million marks a year earlier.
   But sales, damped by strongly negative foreign currency
translation factors, edged up just 0.8% to 3.22 billion marks
from 3.19 billion marks.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Buoyed by strong first-half profit growth, the company
upgraded its cautious estimate of flat full-year earnings,
saying it expects an improvement.</p>
<p>Profit for the parent company, which includes domestic
performance and exports but excludes results of most foreign
and some domestic units, rose 12% to 137 million marks from
122 million marks. The parent's sales increased 4.4% to 1.69
billion marks from 1.62 billion marks. Its sales abroad were
up 6.1% at 1.16 billion marks, compared with the year-earlier
1.09 billion marks, and sales in West Germany rose 0.8% to
530 million marks from 526 million marks. On a world-wide
group basis, including the parent's results, foreign sales
were flat at 2.537 billion marks.</p>
