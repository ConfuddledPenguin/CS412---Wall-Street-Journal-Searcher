	<p class="article-leader">As a theatrical historian who enjoys all the arts, I can
share Edwin Wilson's contempt for political and religious
extremists who would censor what we read or watch, but I am
dismayed when he concludes his essay with the observation
that "debating whether we should have an NEA at all . . . is
a wrongheaded exercise in demagoguery" ("In Search of an
Authentic Debate," Leisure & Arts, June 29). Battling
censorship ought to be a duty for every decentminded citizen;
advocating that taxpayers be forced to underwrite the arts
(and saying the subject is not open to legitimate discussion)
is quite another matter. There are good and proper arguments
for closing down the National Endowment for the Arts.
   In American theater from the plays of Eugene O'Neill or
George S. Kaufman and the musicals of Victor Herbert or
Jerome Kern through the later masterpieces of Tennessee
Williams and Richard Rodgers, producers and their private
investors could bank on reasonable assurances that playgoers
lining up at the box office would give them a handsome
profit. When films from "Birth of a Nation" on to more recent
blockbusters could not be financed from a studio or
producer's earlier earnings, banks were happy to lend money,
again feeling confident that public response would lock in a
return on their investment. Book buyers saw to it that
publishers of favorites from Twain to Michener kept ledgers
in black ink.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>True, in other countries in other times enlightened
princes often harbored and nurtured fine talent. But that has
not been nor should it be the American way. In fact, it is
not a truly analogous situation.</p>
<p>Somerset Maugham once wrote something to the effect that
the classics in any field are culled from bygone, popular
successes. Discovery of an Emily Dickinson is extremely rare.
So why not let book buyers, concertgoers, theater lovers and
kindred souls in the other arts decide with their purchases
what they want to see and what therefore should be offered.
Bureaucrats doling out support to self-indulgent eccentrics
is a waste of time and money. Who needs islands covered with
plastic sheeting, five-hour-long operas and pictures of
religious figures bathed in urine? Or do I hear a cry for
government underwriting to revive Restoration masques?</p>

<p>What can Mr. Wilson mean by a "vigorous, informed debate"
that prohibits the mention of abolition? It is all too easy
to label one's philosophical opponents "demagogues" and avoid
facing fundamental questions about the role of government in
the arts by ridiculing the likes of Sen. Jesse Helms and the
Rev. Pat Robertson.</p>
<p>As we say to the neighborhood bullies, Mr. Wilson, pick on
somebody your own size. Well-meaning people in high places
who would like to test their philosophical and moral
foundations on this issue before lumping us together with
Messrs. Helms and Robertson might search out representatives
of that (very small) minority of us in the arts who oppose
forcing others to support our chosen and privileged
profession.</p>
