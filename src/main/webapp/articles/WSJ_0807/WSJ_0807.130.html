	<p class="article-leader">Stocks and bonds plunged around the world as investors
took flight from heightened risks caused by Middle East
turmoil and surging oil prices.
   With recession fears growing rapidly, the Dow Jones
Industrial Average tumbled 93.31 points in heavy trading to
close at 2716.34. That was the biggest one-day drop since
October's "minicrash." Stock prices also fell sharply in
Japan, which imports nearly all its oil, as well as in
Britain, Germany, Spain, and France.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Yesterday's financial markets were "tumultuous and scary,"
said John Rosenthal, senior partner at Silberberg, Rosenthal
& Co., a New York brokerage firm. However, "It absolutely
didn't feel like Oct. 19 or 20, 1987. At no time was there
panic selling," said Donald Stone, vice chairman of the New
York Stock Exchange and senior partner at Lasker, Stone and
Stern. "But it felt like the market was under real pressure."</p>
<p>So were bonds. Fearing that higher oil prices will sharply
accelerate inflation, investors bailed out of long-term
bonds. In the biggest rout in about three years, Treasury
bond prices plummeted 2 5/8 points, or $26.25 for each $1,000
face amount. The yield on 30-year Treasury bonds climbed to
8.80% from 8.56% late Friday. Bond yields also jumped in most
major international markets, including Britain, Japan and
Germany.</p>
<p>Many "junk" bonds -- high-yielding, high-risk bonds issued
by companies with low credit ratings or no ratings at all --
also were hard hit. Investors fear a recession could
undermine companies with heavy debt burdens.</p>
<p>Even municipal bonds, typically among the quietest, least
volatile securities, were dragged into the bond market's
descent. Prices of many tax-free bond issues tumbled as much
as 1 1/2 points.</p>
<p>All major financial markets vibrated to the same tune:
"Fear of a wider Middle East conflagration," said Robert
Hormats, vice chairman of Goldman Sachs International.
"People are afraid of an attack on Saudi Arabia, which would
probably cause much greater disruption of oil flows," said
Mr. Hormats, a former State Department official. "The
consequences would be shattering."</p>
<p>Investors seeking a financial bomb shelter turned for
protection to short-term Treasury bills, noted for safety.
Individual investors flooded the Treasury with a huge wave of
orders at yesterday's regular weekly government auction of
short-term bills. Rates fell sharply from a week earlier on
both three-month and six-month Treasury bills.</p>
<p>Investors also rushed to buy gold, stocks of precious
metals and mining companies, as well as shares of oil
producers and several defense contractors.</p>
<p>But surging interest rates hammered utility stocks.
Utilities are heavy borrowers, and their stock prices are
very sensitive to interest rate changes. The Dow Jones
Utility Average fell 4.78 points to 204.92.</p>
<p>Rising oil prices pummeled transportation stocks,
especially trucking and airline issues. The Dow Jones
Transportation Average sank 58.76 to 980.29.</p>
<p>Smaller stocks tended to be hurt more than big ones. While
the Dow industrials fell 3.3%, the Nasdaq composite index of
over-the-counter stocks plunged 4.2%.</p>
<p>The Big Board held a hastily arranged news conference to
assure investors that the stock market was humming along just
fine. Asked why more than a dozen major stocks didn't open
for trading at the 9:30 a.m. EDT opening bell, Richard
Torrenzano, an exchange spokesman, said it was more important
that 28 of the 30 stocks in the Dow Jones industrials opened
within a half hour. "That's quite good" under the
circumstances, he said.</p>
<p>In foreign-exchange trading, the dollar fell sharply
against most major currencies, although it rose slightly
against the yen. Traders said worries that higher oil prices
will further slow an already limping U.S. economy, coupled
with concern about tumbling U.S. bond and stock prices,
overshadowed the dollar's status as a safe-haven investment.
The dollar also was hurt by worries that higher oil prices
will mean even bigger U.S. budget and trade deficits.</p>
<p>At one point yesterday, the dollar dropped to just above
its record post-World War II low against the German mark of
1.5615 marks, set in January 1988.</p>
<p>Some traders had hoped that the Federal Reserve would try
to restore calm to the shaky markets and bolster the sagging
U.S. economy by easing credit another notch. But the Fed
didn't take any such action.</p>
<p>Fed officials face a tough choice. If they drive down
short-term rates to calm market jitters, they run a large
risk of intensifying inflation fears, which could further
undermine the markets.</p>
<p>The bond market slump comes at a bad time for the U.S.
government. This week, the Treasury is scheduled to sell a
record $32.25 billion of new notes and bonds to pay the
government's bills. The bond market's sudden sinking spell
means the Treasury will have to pay substantially higher
interest rates to attract investors.</p>
<p>Some traders think the Treasury will have to offer yields
of nearly 9% on the 30-year bonds tentatively slated for sale
Thursday, up from 8.5% since Friday and the highest since
early spring. Today, the Treasury is scheduled to sell new
three-year notes. Bond specialists estimate the notes will be
sold at an average annual yield of about 8% to 8 1/8%, up
from 7.94% on Friday.</p>
<p>In major markets:</p>
<p>Stock prices tumbled. Declining Big Board stocks
outnumbered advancing issues by 1,530 to 255.</p>
<p>Bond prices fell sharply. The Treasury's 30-year bonds
fell to 99 10/32 from 101 30/32 Friday.</p>
<p>The dollar slumped against most major currencies. In late
New York trading yesterday, the dollar fell to 1.5765 German
marks from 1.5935 marks late Friday. But the dollar was
quoted at 150.32 Japanese yen, up from 149.99.</p>
