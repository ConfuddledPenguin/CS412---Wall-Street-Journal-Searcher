	<p class="article-leader">SALINAS, Calif. -- It is the top of the first at Spurs
Stadium, and things look bad for the home team.
   With bases loaded, the Salinas pitcher nicks the batter in
the arm. The third-base runner scores, and the scoreboard
flashes 0-1. From the Spurs' dugout explodes a curse directed
at the pitcher: "Baka-ka omae]"</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>That's Japanese, meaning "What are you? Stupid?" You hear
it a lot in this ball park 100 miles south of San Francisco.
In April, the Spurs imported nine Japanese to fill out their
ragtag minor-league roster. The Spurs' manager, Hidehiko
Koga, is the first Japanese to pilot an American ball club.</p>
<p>It seemed like a good idea. The Japanese could pick up
American baseball know-how, and maybe their discipline would
rub off on the Americans. It works when Japanese managers run
American factories, right? The plan, says Spurs co-owner Joe
Buzas, was "to create something in between the American way
of baseball and the Japanese way."</p>
<p>But making Hondas and playing baseball are different. The
results have ranged from comic to heart-rending. The Class A
California League, in which the Spurs play, is near the
bottom rung of professional baseball, and the Spurs are the
last in the league, with two losses for every win. In a
typical game at Spurs Stadium, a wooden, 1947-vintage
structure with a capacity of 3,000, in the corner of a city
park dominated by stables and the scent of manure, the team
draws fewer than 500 fans.</p>
<p>"We just don't have it together tonight," the 49-year-old
Mr. Koga says. He left his wife and teen-age son in Japan to
pursue his dream of managing a ball team. By the third
inning, the Spurs are trailing by 0-5. "Hetakuso]
Mittomonai]" a Japanese fan yells from the bleachers. "You're
lousy] How pathetic]"</p>
<p>Still, the Spurs' other owner, Katsuaki ("Don") Nomura, a
Los Angeles real-estate developer, likes the team so much
that he has agreed to buy Mr. Buzas' half-interest this year
for $300,000, about 50% more than it cost Mr. Buzas two years
ago. The Spurs lose games but make money, in part because
Japan's Daiei Hawks, one of the teams that supplies Japanese
players, pays the Spurs $10,000 per player in addition to
footing the bill for their room and board and rather generous
salaries. The typical Japanese player earns nearly $3,500 a
month, while the typical American Spur gets only $500.</p>
<p>And even with a team like the Spurs, who aren't affiliated
with any major-league team, the Japanese are picking up some
tricks of the trade from the West.</p>
<p>The Japanese already consider that their baseball is
spiritually superior to the American game; they just can't
beat American teams yet. Dedicated to correct form and
fighting spirit, the Japanese treat "spring" training like
boot camp. They start in winter, swing samurai swords in
batting practice and send erring players to mountain temples
for purification. Japanese teams treasure "wa," or harmony,
which led journalist Robert Whiting to write a book on
Japanese baseball called, "You Gotta Have Wa."</p>
<p>The Daiei Hawks and Tokyo's Yakult Swallows were so
pleased with the three players they apprenticed to the Spurs
as an experiment last season that they sent the three to
Japan's major league on their return. This year, the teams
sent Mr. Koga and his fresh Japanese players to learn more
from the Americans.</p>
<p>They are learning American, all right. Headed into the
sixth inning, 24-year-old relief pitcher Koichi Emoto
expertly rattles off a string of notably foul four-letter
English words from the dugout. Mr. Emoto and his countrymen
have learned to chew and spit and make obscene gestures.</p>
<p>There is more to learn after hours. When a Japanese player
had a batting slump, his American teammates figured he needed
to relax a bit. So after a game in Reno, Nev., they took him
to the Mustang Ranch, a famous (and legal) Nevada brothel.
The next game, he hit two homers.</p>
<p>The American players have learned, too. They have learned
Japanese anatomical terms that would scandalize a Tokyo
grandmother. "With two cultures, it seems like you can relate
best with abusive language," says Corey Paul, a Spurs
outfielder and non-academic student of cultural interaction.</p>
<p>The Japanese also learn baseball, although it rarely shows
on the scoreboard. They are "like sponges," says Steve Howe,
a former Los Angeles pitching ace who joined the Spurs in
April. Japanese pitchers have learned to pitch fast balls to
brush back intimidating batters instead of always trying to
trick them with curve balls or walk them, as pitchers do in
Japan. Japanese hitters learn a more powerful swing than
allowed by the formulas of their form-conscious batting
coaches back home.</p>
<p>"We've learned to think for ourselves," says 20-year-old
first-baseman Kenichi Yamanuouchi. "Baseball is a lot more
fun here," says 22-year-old pitcher Shigeki Sasaki.</p>
<p>Nobody blames manager Koga"Heidi" to his friends -- for
the Spurs' woes. They were in last place last year, too. His
American players are mostly castoffs from higher-class minor
league teams. The better players quickly move up. Leon
Durham, a former Chicago Cubs power hitter who plays first
base for the Spurs, says his personal objective is "to get
the hell out of here."</p>
<p>Mr. Koga, soft-spoken with gray-streaked hair and a toothy
grin, knows adversity well. He joined Japan's favorite team,
the Yomiuri Giants, in 1961, only to be benched by a back
injury caused by severe training. A car-crash injury derailed
a stint with a San Francisco Giants farm team.</p>
<p>After failed comebacks and other misadventures, he landed
at the Hawks as a scout and interpreter, tending to the often
unruly foreigners that Japanese teams grudgingly hire to add
a bit of power. After 11 years, he asked Mr. Buzas for the
job of managing the Spurs.</p>
<p>Mr. Buzas ordered Mr. Koga to fire more than half his
starting lineup of Americans -- a "heart-breaking" task, Mr.
Koga says, that is unknown to managers in Japan -- after a
17-game losing streak. The Japanese were assured of jobs back
home at season's end. "They take care of their own kind --
it's one tight group," says outfielder Bill Carlson. "But we
knew that when we signed."</p>
<p>Mr. Koga's Japanese players were aghast at their first
sight of Spurs Stadium, with its orange and blue paint
peeling from its cracked bleachers. One homesick player
returned to Japan. The rest have sometimes had
misunderstandings.</p>
<p>At a game in San Jose, a pitch hit a Japanese Spur in the
head. That led to a fistfight and accusations that the
pitcher intended an "international incident." The Spurs'
American batboy has complained it took him 10 minutes to
explain to a Japanese trainer that a locker-room rat was into
the sunflower-seed supply. A Japanese coach bawled at several
bored American relief pitchers who had contrived a
bat-and-baseball "putting course" in the bullpen. He said
they weren't showing proper spirit. "No putter] No putter]"
he sputtered. "Only baseball]"</p>
<p>The Spurs might be better off playing golf this night. In
the ninth inning, the opponents pad their lead by three runs
as the dust rolls in under the lights from cars leaving the
parking lot. A hapless Spur strikes out to end the game at
2-9.</p>
<p>In the locker room, Mr. Koga ponders his future. He would
like to manage the Spurs next year, maybe fly them to Japan
for a few games. The Spurs have become, after all, the most
famous American minor-league team in Japan. But he worries
that what the Japanese are learning here will go for naught
back home. There, he says, traditional-bound coaches are
likely to dismiss their new ideas. Says Leon Lee, a baseball
consultant who played for a decade in Japan: "It's a shame in
a way to bring these kids to learn American ways. They'll go
back and have to wipe it all out."</p>
