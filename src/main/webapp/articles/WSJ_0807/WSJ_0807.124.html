	<p class="article-leader">THE SECURITY COUNCIL IMPOSED a global trade embargo on
Iraq.
   The U.N. panel's 13-0 vote, provoked by the invasion of
Kuwait, was the organization's first total trade and arms
boycott in 23 years. To ensure its success, the U.S. is
considering an international naval blockade against Baghdad.
"These sanctions will be enforced, no matter what it takes,"
Bush said. In a bid to stop the flow of Iraqi oil, Baker
prepared to go to Turkey for talks. But Iraq shut one of its
pipelines in Turkey and gave arms to civilians in Baghdad.
The U.S. said 28 Americans were believed to be among a group
Iraqis seized in Kuwait.</p>

<p>BHUTTO WAS DISMISSED and her 20-month Pakistani government
dissolved.</p>
<p>Saying the Bhutto government was ineffective and corrupt,
President Ishaq Khan dismissed the premier, dissolved the
National Assembly and declared a state of emergency. He
appointed Bhutto's political rival Jatoi as caretaker prime
minister and scheduled elections for Oct. 24. The Pakistan
army took over the television station and phone exchanges,
and spread troops through the capital.</p>
<p>Bhutto, the first woman leader of an Islamic country, said
that the corruption allegations against her government were
the product of a "slander campaign."</p>

<p>THE ANC HALTED its 30-year armed struggle against the
Pretoria government.</p>
<p>After a day of talks with officials of South Africa's
white-minority government, the African National Congress
announced the suspension, clearing the way for the start of
negotiations over a new constitution based on black-white
power sharing. Mandela said his group's infiltration of
trained guerrillas and weapons into South Africa would stop
immediately, as would all military activities inside the
country.</p>
<p>Pretoria said it would begin a phased release of political
prisoners and would grant indemnity to 20,000 ANC exiles so
they can return to South Africa.</p>

<p>Liberian rebels seized an American and 13 or 14 other
foreigners in Monrovia. The U.S. said the group was taken to

rival factions fighting to oust President Doe. There was no
indication whether members of the group had been harmed.</p>
<p>Five West African leaders agreed to send troops into
Liberia to impose a cease-fire in the civil war. The task
force reportedly would comprise troops from Nigeria, Ghana,
Guinea, Sierra Leone and Gambia.</p>

<p>The Social Democrats demanded the two Germanys unite by
Sept. 15, saying East Germany's economic conditions are
"catastrophic." The party, the second-largest in both German
states, set the deadline after a joint meeting. Ruling

pan-German vote that should be held Oct. 14.</p>

<p>The Soviet Union said U.S. proposals for a 25% reduction

and trimming expenditures on costly programs such as the B-2
Stealth bomber.</p>

<p>Salvage crews cleaned the tanks of a crippled oil barge

Bay.</p>

Cambodian resistance coalition dominated by the Khmer Rouge.</p>
