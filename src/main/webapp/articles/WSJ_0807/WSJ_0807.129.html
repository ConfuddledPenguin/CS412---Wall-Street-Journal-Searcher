	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- The stock market turned in its worst
performance since its "minicrash" in October as Iraq's
invasion of Kuwait and the subsequent surge in oil prices
triggered another round of broadbased, heavy selling.
   The Dow Jones Industrial Average plummeted about 105
points within the first 45 minutes of the session and
finished down 93.31 at 2716.34, its lowest level since early
May.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"Everybody was kind of punched out after the first two
hours of trading," since the market's plunge "pretty much
happened right out of the gate," said Sid Dorr, head of
institutional trading at Charles Schwab & Co., San Francisco.</p>
<p>Among broader market measures, Standard & Poor's 500-Stock
Index skidded 10.43 to 334.43, the New York Stock Exchange
Composite Index fell 5.50 to 183.32 and the Dow Jones Equity
Market Index tumbled 10.50 to 309.61.</p>
<p>Decliners on the Big Board totaled 1,530 issues -- the
highest since Oct. 13, when 1,600 issues finished lower as
the Dow industrials plummeted 190.58 points. In the latest
session, only 255 issues moved higher.</p>
<p>Airline and trucking issues were hit the hardest in the
latest sell-off; the Dow Jones Transportation Average closed
below 1,000 for the first time in 19 months, falling 58.76 to
980.29. The Dow Jones Utilities Average posted its biggest
decline since mid-January, falling 4.78 to 204.92.</p>
<p>Volume totaled 240,400,000 shares -- down from the
292,360,000 shares which changed hands Friday and the
253,090,000 traded Thursday, but still the third-highest
total this year.</p>
<p>Overseas stock markets once again helped set the tone for
Wall Street, as inflation and economic worries resulting from
the rise in oil prices sent share prices lower around the
world. The 3.3% drop in the Dow industrials compared with the
3.1% loss posted by the Nikkei index of 225 Japanese issues
and a 2.8% decline in the Financial Times-Stock Exchange
100-Share Index, a measure of London stock prices.</p>
<p>Within the first half-hour of trading on Wall Street, two
Big Board "circuit breakers" designed to cushion market
declines took effect:</p>
<p>-- The so-called "uptick" requirement for stock-index
arbitrage trading, which kicked in after the industrials had
lost 50 points. After that point, traders had to wait until
individual stocks rose in price before completing the stock
side of arbitrage transactions.</p>
<p>-- The "sidecar," a computer file which handled all
program trading orders for S&P 500 stocks for a five-minute
period. Once September S&P 500 futures showed a loss of 12
points, those orders were diverted to the file and then
executed once the waiting period ended.</p>
<p>Market strategists at several Wall Street brokerage firms,
reacting to the market's fall, recommended that investors
move some assets out of stocks and into cash.</p>
<p>Charles I. Clough Jr., chief investment strategist at
Merrill Lynch, doubled the cash portion of the firm's model
portfolio to 10% and lowered his firm's stock weighting by
five percentage points, to 45%. The other 45% remains in
bonds.</p>
<p>Mr. Clough said he doesn't expect to lower the stock
allocation further, citing a belief that interest rates will
soon head lower again and boost share prices. The market's
response to developments in the Middle East "is getting a
little extreme, so you've brought down stocks a long way in a
short period of time," he added.</p>
<p>At Morgan Stanley, chief U.S. investment strategist Byron
R. Wien increased the firm's recommended cash allocation to
20% from 15% and lowered his 1990 and 1991 earnings estimates
for the S&P 500 stocks, according to Dow Jones Professional
Investor Report.</p>
<p>Joe Granville, the market pundit whose words used to make
tens of thousands of investors snap to attention, is
predicting a stock market crash within a few days.</p>
<p>He thinks the industrial average will fall below 2200 by
month's end and, before recovering in the spring of 1992,
will drop below the October 1987 low of 1738.</p>
<p>Mr. Granville lost much of his once-vast following in the
early 1980s, when he stubbornly refused to recognize the
great bull market of 1982-1987. But he has made several
astute market predictions since late 1987.</p>
<p>Oil stocks remained among the market's few bright spots as
oil prices continued their rise, spurred by news that Iraqi
troops were amassing near the KuwaitSaudi Arabia border.
September crude-oil futures surged $3.55 a barrel in New York
trading to $28.05.</p>
<p>Exxon rose 1 1/8 to 54 1/4 in composite trading of 3.5
million shares. Other actively traded oil issues included
Phillips Petroleum, which jumped 1 7/8 to 31 on 2.1 million
shares; Maxus Energy, which gained 1/2 to 12 3/8 on 1.8
million shares; and Global Marine, which closed unchanged at
5 1/8 as 2.2 million changed hands.</p>
<p>Elsewhere in the sector, Chevron added 5/8 to 79 3/8,
Texaco gained 3/8 to 65, Mobil rose 1 1/8 to 68, Amoco added
3/8 to 57 7/8 and Atlantic Richfield went up 3 1/2 to 137
1/8.</p>
<p>Precious-metals issues, which have also been climbing
since the Iraqi invasion, drew continued buying interest as
well.</p>
<p>Homestake Mining rose 1 1/8 to 20 3/4, Hecla Mining rose
3/8 to 12, Placer Dome added 5/8 to 17 3/8 and ASA Ltd.
climbed 1 7/8 to 50 3/4.</p>
<p>But the run-up in defense stocks since Iraq's invasion on
Thursday began to falter. General Dynamics advanced 1 to 30
and Northrop added 1/4 to 15 3/8, but Raytheon, which is said
to be selling or planning to sell its Patriot missile system
to Saudi Arabia and Israel, fell 1 1/8 to 62 3/4.</p>
<p>UAL, the parent company of United Airlines, plunged 12 1/2
to 110 as the Thursday deadline for a union-led group to line
up financing for its $4.38 billion buy-out proposal drew
closer. A source close to the UAL board said the board likely
would grant the group an extension of "a day or so," American
Banker reported, but would be less likely to grant a longer
extension.</p>
<p>Other airline stocks also fell sharply amid news that Pan
Am plans a 10% fare increase as a result of soaring jet fuel
costs, tied to the rise in oil prices. Pan Am added 1/8 to 2
1/8, but AMR, which owns American Airlines, tumbled 4 3/8 to
50 3/8; Delta Air Lines fell 3 3/8 to 59 1/8; Southwest
Airlines dropped 3 1/4 to 22 1/2, and USAir Group slid 2 1/8
to 18 3/4. Continental Airlines Holdings went down 5/8 to 4
in American Stock Exchange trading.</p>
<p>The Amex Market Value Index went down 6.36 to 340.27, its
sharpest point decline since mid-January. Volume totaled
23,270,000.</p>
