	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- George Bush is at the defining moment of his
presidency.
   With Iraqi troops entrenched in Kuwait, with oil prices
rising at neighborhood gasoline pumps across the U.S., and
with the new threat of an economic recession just before the
mid-term congressional elections, President Bush faces a
series of decisions that will color the rest of his term and
help determine whether he wins another one.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"The president is going into a dark room now, and we don't
know what is going to happen," says John Geer, a political
scientist at Arizona State University. "This could be an
opportunity for him, but on the whole, this is the kind of
opportunity a president would rather not have."</p>
<p>Eight years ago, Margaret Thatcher faced a similar
defining moment when Argentina invaded the Falkland Islands.
She responded forcefully, won back the Falklands,
consolidated her position atop the greasy pole of British
politics and won for herself a reputation as a tough prime
minister willing to use force to protect British interests.</p>
<p>Mr. Bush's problem is much tougher than Mrs. Thatcher's,
however. The U.S. is a third party but has critical economic
and diplomatic stakes in a crisis that involves a
militaristic head of the world's sixth largest standing army.
Mr. Bush's options, all of which almost certainly would
provoke enormous unintended consequences in a world hot spot,
are far more difficult.</p>
<p>Although he has racked up impressively high poll ratings
after 19 months of office, his persona isn't etched very
deeply with the public; it's difficult for voters to identify
his fingerprints on the government. Whatever his actions in
the next several days and weeks, it is clear that the
challenge from Iraqi President Saddam Hussein will have a
profound effect on the way Americans view Mr. Bush.</p>
<p>"Three months from now we will have a very good sense of
George Bush," says Peter Hart, a Democratic political
pollster. "He'll either look strong or he will have begun the
slide down the slippery slope of public opinion." Edward
Rollins, co-chairman of the National Republican Congressional
Committee, adds: "This is the big moment."</p>
<p>In the first diplomatic crisis of the post-Cold War
period, Mr. Bush's problem is to protect U.S. interests
broadly -- not only economic interests at home, but important
geopolitical interests in the Middle East and Europe. He
raised the stakes himself when he said of the Iraqi invasion
of Kuwait, "This will not stand" and urged the world to watch
for his actions.</p>
<p>For more than a year and a half, Mr. Bush has benefited
from events over which he had little control; he was on the
sidelines, for example, as Communist Eastern Europe crumbled
with unexpected speed and ease. Now events under which he had
no control are moving against him, forcing him to take
action.</p>
<p>"This is a watershed in the Bush presidency," says Burton
Yale Pines, senior vice president of the Heritage Foundation,
a conservative think tank here in Washington. "He has got to
show that he and his people are beginning to understand the
post-Cold War world and how to use America's levers of
influence and power in that environment. It does not
necessarily mean going to war, but it means that you have to
be prepared to go to war. It also means we don't go to war
alone."</p>
<p>Mr. Bush is contemplating his strategy in a political
atmosphere that demands a swift display of resolve if not
actual action.</p>
<p>"If Bush just lets this drag out, it will hurt him," says
William Hamilton, a Democratic political pollster. "People
will see an effect at the gas pumps, and if there are real
worries about a recession, they'll be blamed on Bush. This
may be the most important week of the Bush presidency. People
are looking for a strong lead from the president."</p>
<p>The crisis comes at a time when some of the familiar buoys
of diplomacy have moved, and Mr. Bush knows that he can act
to protect U.S. allies in Saudi Arabia and protect U.S. oil
supplies without worrying as much about a countermove from
the Soviet Union. Although that gives Mr. Bush some more
maneuvering room, he is still feeling his way in a new
relationship with the Soviets.</p>
<p>"During the whole Cold War, the threat was that trouble in
the Middle East could escalate into a war between the U.S.
and the Soviet Union," says John Mueller, a University of
Rochester political scientist. "In this crisis there isn't
that danger, but there's the challenge of defining a new
relationship that could be quite productive with the
Soviets."</p>
<p>Mr. Bush also faces a challenge not met fully by any
American president since Harry Truman: uniting the world's
democracies and others in a common goal. "That's Bush's
potential mission," says James David Barber, a Duke
University expert on the presidency. "In the past, he has
taken on major missions: going into the service despite the
objections of his father, taking off for Texas, going to
Beijing. This may be his presidential mission."</p>
<p>Mr. Bush is contemplating his response in the knowledge
that, in the short term at least, he acts with the support of
congressional leaders. "We're in the immediate
rally-round-the-flag moment," says Stephen Hess of the
Brookings Institution. "There is nothing especially Bush
about his response: meeting with advisers, looking toward the
United Nations. By Labor Day, we'll know more about the Bush
style."</p>
<p>If the result is a protracted stalemate, an unsuccessful
military mission or high loss of life, the president's
support could evaporate quickly.</p>
<p>House Speaker Thomas Foley yesterday repeated that he
would "support the use of military force if necessary to
protect Saudi Arabia" but cautioned that the struggle with
Iraq might involve tactics like boycotts and blockades that
would take more time than a swift military strike and that
might call for economic sacrifices from energy consumers in
the U.S.</p>
<p>"If there are risks," the Washington Democrat said, "it is
that we won't be patient enough, not determined enough."</p>
<p>Before the crisis is over, it's clear that the public's
perception of Mr. Bush will be less an impressionism sketch
and more a realism portrait.</p>
<p>"Everybody's been looking for a defining moment in the
Bush presidency," says Thomas Griscom, who served as
communications director in the Reagan White House. "His
challenge here is to take a decisive step."</p>
<p>"He has to act like a president," concurs Harrison
Hickman, a Democratic political consultant. "This is as close
to it as it gets."</p>
