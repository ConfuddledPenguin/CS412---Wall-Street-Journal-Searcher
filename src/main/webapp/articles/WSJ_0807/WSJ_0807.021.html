	<p class="article-leader">Dr. Miran Bethel, an obstetrician gynecologist, has a new
sideline: selling ovulation-testing kits from his practice in
downtown Los Angeles.
   Although the Ovuquick kit he sells is an especially
accurate means of predicting the date of a woman's ovulation,
it isn't readily available in local drugstores, Dr. Bethel
says. Offering the kit has attracted numerous new patients,
he adds.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The sideline was the brainchild of Steven Getzoff, partner
in Getzoff & Krowne, Encino, Calif., which has built its
business by helping doctors make more money from their
practices. Among other services, it keeps an eye out for new
opportunities in the medical world. Five years ago, it was
advising clients to offer longer office hours. Now, it's
telling clients to sell products in their practices.</p>
<p>Concerns such as Getzoff & Krowne are thriving because of
a growing squeeze on U.S. doctors. The American Medical
Association estimates that the number of doctors in the
nation jumped to 237 physicians per 100,000 inhabitants in
1988 from 202 in 1980, increasing the competition in the
profession. At the same time, employers, insurers and the
government are trying to squeeze medical costs. Thus, the
average doctor received only 119 patient visits a week in
1987, down from 129 in 1982.</p>
<p>Not surprisingly, doctors are increasingly anxious to hear
from entrepreneurs who can help them make more money. These
entrepreneurs are boosting the incomes of many doctors -- and
changing the way they conduct their practices.</p>
<p>Assisting doctors with their business problems is no
novelty. Since 1932, Professional Management Group has helped
physicians collect delinquent payments. The group says total
billings reached $24 million last year, a 20% rise from 1986.
It now boasts 62 franchises, including three in Detroit alone
that have opened since 1988.</p>
<p>But consultants in the field are sharply expanding the
scope of their work. Once confined to bill collecting and
similar tasks, they now specialize in everything from public
relations to the installation of laboratories.</p>
<p>Sharon Yenney, of CBY Associates Inc. in Washington, D.C.,
moved into consulting seven years ago after a career in
hospital management. She began with a focus on preventive
medicine, but helping doctors market their services now
accounts for 30% of her business.</p>
<p>For example, a plastic surgeon came to her in 1989 who
wanted to move away from reconstructive surgery into cosmetic
surgery. Ms. Yenney advised him to contact all the physicians
who had referred patients to him and to speak candidly with
them about what he wanted to do. "That seems kind of obvious
. . . but you'd be surprised how few physicians will think of
doing it," she says.</p>
<p>Others with health-care experience also have seen
marketing opportunities. Rebecca Anwar was on the faculty of
the Medical College of the University of Pennsylvania for 14
years before starting Hoover Anwar Associates in 1986. While
a member of the faculty, Dr. Anwar watched the growing
competition and noticed the number of doctors leaving college
unable to find work. For her, the solution lay in better
communication to potential patients of what the doctor had to
offer.</p>
<p>For an orthopedic surgeon who wanted to specialize in
joint replacement, Dr. Anwar came up with a brochure
specifically designed for the older population and
distributed it through a direct-mail run to retirement
communities. This appeal was so successful the surgeon opened
two other practices and had to find a partner.</p>
<p>Roland Wussow, of Wussow Consulting Group in Nashville,
Tenn., is in what he calls the "image-management business."
His clients include doctors who are building businesses based
on changes in the medical profession.</p>
<p>One client is Alan Pierrot, an orthopedic surgeon in
Fresno, Calif., who believes that funding cuts are eroding
the quality of health care. He and 94 other physicians
decided to create an alternative to the traditional hospital,
the Fresno Surgery and Recovery Care Center. Started in 1988,
it claims to be a "hotel with nurses" at 70% of the price of
a hospital ward.</p>
<p>Dr. Pierrot asked Mr. Wussow to provide a "total
communication strategy" for the center. The brochure that he
produced for the center and distributed to the medical world
helped attract a large number of visitors and contributed to
the center's success, Dr. Pierrot says. Shares in the
for-profit Fresno Surgery Center, originally issued at $8,000
apiece, now are trading at $18,000.</p>
<p>Joyce Stevens, of New England Laboratory Consultants in
Princeton, Mass., offers a more specialized service to the
medical profession. She helps physicians to install labs in
their own practices, advising them on the machinery they buy
and then ensuring that they conduct the quality-control and
proficiency testing necessary to gain a license to use it in
Massachusetts. Such labs can help doctors boost their incomes
significantly. Instead of referring patients to outside labs,
doctors can collect the testing revenue themselves. Above
all, Ms. Stevens says, her job involves "keeping abreast of
what's new" in laboratory equipment that is appropriate for
doctors' offices.</p>
<p>Ms. Stevens left her job as hematology supervisor at the
University of Massachusetts Medical Center five years ago to
look after her children. Consulting to physicians is still
only a part-time occupation for her. But she believes she may
soon have a backlog of work orders, depending on the
implementation of a new federal law that would require
physician office labs handling a high volume of work to be
licensed. According to an American Medical Association
estimate in June 1988, about 100,000 physician office labs
could be affected.</p>
<p>But some experts say some efforts to make doctor practices
more profitable just don't pay. Bill Kidd, executive
secretary of the Society of Medical and Dental Management
Consultants, Kansas City, says: "It's difficult to make a
strong recommendation for {more aggressive physician
marketing} when you just don't see the results." But he
concedes that he knows of a dentist in Kenosha, Wis., who
doubled the size of his advertisement in the Yellow Pages and
found that the demand for his services doubled as well.</p>
