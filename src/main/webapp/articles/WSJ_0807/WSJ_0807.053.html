	<p class="article-leader">I knew Eire, or the Republic of Ireland, or simply Ireland
as it is more commonly known, prided itself on its neutrality
but I wasn't aware that it had seceded or been expelled from
"Europe."
   Writing on the July 3 Leisure & Arts page, Nicholas King
proclaims that Spain's Cape Finisterre is "the westernmost
point of Europe" ("Mobile Guide: Celtic Touch on the Coast of
Spain"). A quick check of some handy maps in my appointment
calendar (and not, I must confess, bona fide nautical charts)
confirmed my gut reaction that Cape Blasket Island off
Ireland's Dingle peninsula lies about 10 degrees, 34 minutes
West vs. Cape Finisterre's nine degrees, 20 minutes West
longitude. As long as we're talking "islands," what about the
Canary Islands (17 degrees, 20 minutes West)? Although
technically off the African coast, they are politically part
of European Spain.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>OK, if you want to stay in Europe and don't want to count
"little" islands, then the tip of the Dingle peninsula lies
only a few minutes of longitude east of Blasket. I would
almost agree if Mr. King had modified his description to "the
westernmost point of mainland Europe," although the Cabo de
Roca, southwest of Lisbon probably would challenge Finisterre
to make that claim -- that is if Portugal hasn't seceded from
Europe.</p>
<p>Assuming that we want to stay with inhabited places, or at
the very least places that one could or would ever want to
visit, I suppose that eliminates that spit of rock -- ever
the subject of Anglo/Irish debate -- Rockall. Alas, however,
Icelanders might take exception, as their homeland has --
from time to time -- been considered a European country.</p>
<p>Perhaps by now some of Mr. King's colleagues at the
Foreign Press Center have pointed out the abyss one falls
into when one makes "ultimate" geography claims.</p>
