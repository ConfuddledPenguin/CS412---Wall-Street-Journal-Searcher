	<p class="article-leader">Merrill Lynch & Co. is searching for a buyer for Merrill
Lynch, Hubbard Inc., its real estate investment and
syndication unit, according to two people familiar with the
company's efforts.
   Hubbard, which has about 105 employees, manages
approximately $1.5 billion of commercial and residential real
estate for more than 230,000 investors in 10 partnerships.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Merrill Lynch has been retreating to its core of
securities brokerage and investment banking businesses for
more than a year. The Hubbard unit has been for sale since
early this year, according to people familiar with the
efforts. But turmoil in the market for real estate limited
partnerships has reduced the number of potential buyers.</p>
<p>Two syndicators who remain strong -- Atlanta-based
Equitable Real Estate Investment Management Inc., and
Chicago-based JMB Realty -- are considering the acquisition
of Hubbard, according to people familiar with Merrill's
efforts.</p>
<p>"Hubbard is under constant review, but no decision to sell
it has been made as of this date," said Merrill spokesman
William Clark, who would not comment on whether the unit is
for sale.</p>
<p>Merrill officials decline to disclose how much they are
asking for the unit, as do officials from both Equitable and
JMB Realty.</p>
<p>Between 1981 and 1987, Hubbard raised $1.7 billion dollars
to purchase real estate through a series of six MLH Income
Realty Partnerships. Hubbard made cash-based acquisitions of
commercial properties with strong cash flows and good
potentials for appreciation, according to Larry Kay, who
follows Hubbard for Standard & Poor's Corp.</p>
<p>After flourishing in the mid-1980s, the market for real
estate limited partnerships was crippled by the 1986 Tax
Reform Act. Previously, investors were able to write off
losses from real esate limited partnerships against ordinary
income. After 1986, the losses could only be written off
against passive income, such as income from other limited
partnerships. The collapse of real estate markets in the
South, Southwest, and Northeast also stemmed the flow of
investors seeking to capitalize on runaway real estate
prices.</p>
<p>The deterioration of the market threw Integrated Resources
Inc. in New York and Southmark Corp. of Dallas, two
syndicators that relied heavily on investors seeking tax
shelters, into bankruptcy-court proceedings. Unlike Hubbard,
these two syndicators had highly leveraged portfolios.</p>
