	<p class="article-leader">As a right-leaning radical centrist, permit me to question
the validity of Albert R. Hunt's July 11 editorial-page
column, "Without the Glue, the Conservatives Are Balkanized."
   While some conservatives and neocons do, indeed, seem
momentarily disoriented by the apparent collapse of the
Empire of the Commiczars, they will soon rediscover their
primal "glue," as Mr. Hunt calls their (and my own)
anti-socialist instincts.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>This will happen, is happening. Simply because the left's
communoid dream of "True Socialism" is alive and
well-pretending, of course, that it will now succeed because
it has never before been tried.</p>
<p>In its attempt to rise from the ashes, TruSoc (as George
Orwell might have called it) will slowly become recognized as
the neo-enemy, perhaps not as overtly criminal but just as
insidiously dangerous as communism itself. Here is the story
in geopolitical rhyme and verse:</p>
<p>Conservatives like us, they say</p>
<p>Have lost our cause and primal glue;</p>
<p>For due to communism's fall,</p>
<p>We have no further good to do.</p>
<p>But hark] Our noble cause remains,</p>
<p>While leftist pseudo-libs do try</p>
<p>To resurrect from Lenin's grave</p>
<p>The "Dream" they hope will never die.</p>
<p>That Dream, called Socialism True,</p>
<p>Is now reborn, the left does claim.</p>
<p>For communism's heinous crimes,</p>
<p>The Dream, they say, was ne'er to blame.</p>
<p>The left would socialize us all --</p>
<p>Intent to fill each space and void</p>
<p>With stuff so very Lenin-like,</p>
<p>It looks and smells like "communoid."</p>
<p>So now, the Cold War does resume</p>
<p>Twixt us and reborn Socialism,</p>
<p>Whose cause the left does now promote</p>
<p>As neo-Marxist Gorbachism.</p>

<p>Mr. Hunt characterized the Rockford Institute as
"eccentric." I object. A more accurate characterization might
be "independent" or perhaps even "unpredictable," since our
writers and editors do not march in lock step with groups
based in Washington.</p>
<p>Eccentric is a word better used for those institutions
within the Beltway. I say that because the ideas and actions
of these groups are often out of step with the rest of the
U.S.</p>
