	<p class="article-leader">TOKYO -- Japan's current economic expansion is healthy and
sustainable, notwithstanding the prospect of higher world oil
prices and interest rates, a government agency said.
   But the Economic Planning Agency urged the cabinet of
Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu to accelerate deregulation of
the economy, enforce antitrust laws more stringently and
guard against the polarization of the haves and have-nots in
Japan's increasingly wealthy society.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The recommendations, contained in the agency's annual
economic white paper, mirror some of the suggestions the U.S.
put forward in recent bilateral talks on structural economic
changes.</p>
<p>In large part, the report praises Japan's management of
its current economic expansion. Now in its 45th month, the
expansion is the country's second longest since World War II.
A 57-month period in the late 1960s remains postwar Japan's
longest boom. The average rate of growth during the current
expansion is 5.7%, compared with 12.1% in the earlier cycle.
As in the previous major expansion, strong consumer spending
and capital investment are the leading factors.</p>
<p>"We see no domestic reason why the expansion would come to
an end," said Shousuke Tanaka, director-general of the
Economic Planning Agency's research division.</p>
<p>Even the impact on world oil prices of Iraq's invasion of
Kuwait doesn't threaten Japan's health, he said. In the past,
oil has been the Achilles' heel of Japan's economic
juggernaut. The surge in crude prices during the oil crises
of 1973 and 1979 set off inflation and curtailed growth. But
today, Mr. Tanaka said, Japan's dependence on oil for
economic productivity is markedly lower. Nowadays, he said,
an increase of 10% in world oil prices would translate to a
0.1 percentage-point increase in consumer prices.</p>
<p>Japan's strengths, the agency said, lie in its corporate
innovation and use of technology. But the economy also has
benefited from intercompany relationships -- many Japanese
concerns have close links to suppliers and distributors --
that help industry keep costs down.</p>
<p>The agency warned that outsiders shouldn't be excluded
from that system and said that deregulation of the economy
would help. But it also cautioned that Japan's antitrust
authorities should be given more power to dismantle alliances
that go beyond the boundaries of law and international
acceptance. Mr. Tanaka suggested the country's Fair Trade
Commission should have power to recommend criminal punishment
for violations of antitrust codes.</p>
<p>Another big boost for Japan's industry has been a
cooperative labor force. But the agency warned that equality
among Japanese workers is diminishing.</p>
<p>"More than 50% of Japanese people live in houses with
land, but the other half doesn't have land" in a country
where property prices have skyrocketed, he said. "We are
seeing a very large social issue beginning to emerge."</p>
<p>The planning agency also urged the government to do more
abroad. Japan now spends about $9 billion, an amount
equivalent to about 0.8% of its economic output, on official
development assistance. The agency recommended that the
proportion be increased.</p>
