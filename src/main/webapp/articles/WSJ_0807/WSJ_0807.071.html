	<p class="article-leader">Over-the-counter stocks dove 4.2% to their lowest levels
since March 1989 as investors and professional dealers
continued to shun smaller stocks amid anxiety about the
economy and developments in the Middle East.
   The Nasdaq Composite Index plummeted 17.42 to 400.04, the
fourth largest one-day point drop in the index's history.
Volume eased but remained heavy as 174.8 million shares
changed hands, down from 203.2 million Friday. Declining
stocks trounced advancers, 2,058 to 421.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Investors continued to bail out of the OTC market's
largest stocks and take profits in the technology, emerging
growth and health care shares that had been their favorites
until mid-July. The Nasdaq 100 Index of largest OTC issues
plunged 22.30 to 402.91, a 5.2% drop; the Nasdaq Industrials
of more than 2,000 larger issues fell 21.34 to 426.59, a 4.8%
decline.</p>
<p>Among the day's largest losers, Nike fell 7 3/4 to 72 3/4;
Liz Claiborne dropped 3 1/2 to 25; Amgen dropped 4 1/4 to 81
1/2; Sun Microsystems slipped 3 1/8 to 27 5/8; Microsoft
tumbled 2 3/4 to 60 1/2, and Intel eased 2 to 37 1/4. Among
foreign issues, Class B American depositary receipts of L.M.
Ericsson Telephone, the Swedish telecommunications giant,
plummeted 15 1/4 to 198 1/2; Reuters ADRs fell 3 1/4 to 52
3/4.</p>
<p>Trading remained particularly heavy among small investors
using the Small Order Execution System operated by the
National Association of Securities Dealers, said NASD
President Joseph R. Hardiman. Known as "SOES," the system
allows investors to automatically execute up to five orders
of 1,000 shares each at the best available bid or ask price
indicated by all the market makers in a stock. NASD considers
the system to be a good indicator of activity among
individual investors.</p>
<p>Volume on the system was 60% above normal yesterday and
Friday, according to Mr. Hardiman. Volume on NASD's
smallorder system and similar systems run by a number of
brokerage firms accounts for more than 50% of all shares
traded over-the-counter, he added.</p>
<p>Some portfolio managers and traders complained that the
fall in OTC shares has been exacerbated by a herd mentality
among market makers: They undercut each other's bids but
refuse to step up and buy shares. The steep declines in some
OTC shares is "due to the fact that everyone is acting in
unison" rather than some market makers venturing to buy
shares when others are marking down their prices, said Alan
Radlo, manager of the $730 million Fidelity OTC Fund.</p>
<p>"Market makers are running down their bids. It's like
two-year-olds running away from the market," said Mr. Radlo.
He suggested that dealers who advertise their bids on the
automated Nasdaq system should be obligated to commit a
minimum number of shares to the prices they advertise.</p>
<p>For orders of 1,000 shares or less, market markers are
indeed obligated to honor their advertised prices, Mr.
Hardiman points out, while larger transactions are negotiated
between investors and dealers. Mr. Hardiman defended the
performance of the Nasdaq system yesterday and Friday. "We
had no complaints about the inability to get trades made," he
said, adding that rumors Friday that some traders weren't
answering their telephones were unfounded.</p>
<p>"I don't think there's anything you can do to prevent
these kinds of sell-offs," Mr. Hardiman said. "There's an
awful lot of uncertainty out there, particularly among
institutional investors and dealers as to what's going to
happen in the Mideast and as to what's going to happen in our
own domestic economy."</p>
<p>Redemptions at several mutual funds that trade OTC stocks
were running slightly ahead of normal, but not excessively
so. Both T. Rowe Price's $1 billion New Horizons Fund and its
Science & Technology Fund each had net outflows Friday of
about $1 million and didn't see any significant pick-up in
redemptions yesterday, according to a T. Rowe Price
spokesman.</p>
<p>Two other fund managers said redemptions were less than
they anticipated. Binkley Shorts, manager of the
Over-The-Counter Securities Fund, Boston, said redemptions
were below his daily average. Lawrence Auriana, manager of
the Kauffman Fund, New York, also said he received fewer
redemptions than he expected. But both fund managers
indicated the market has been tough.</p>
<p>"It's a painful, ugly market out there. There's no place
to hide," said Mr. Shorts.</p>
<p>Among the day's other losers, American Software Class A
shares plunged more than 25%, or 3 1/8 to 9 5/8. Friday, the
maker of IBM-compatible software indicated that net income
for the fiscal first quarter ended July 31 will be 11 cents
to 17 cents a share, compared with 17 cents a year earlier.</p>
<p>Some energy issues remained strong as oil prices continued
to rise. Falcon Oil & Gas rose 1 to 5 3/4; Baker Hughes
warrants added 1/2 to 9 1/4, and Hamilton Oil advanced 1 1/4
to 43 3/4.</p>
