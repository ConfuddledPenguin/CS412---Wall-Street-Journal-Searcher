	<h3>Crude Prices Hit Highest Levels In Over 4 Years --- Many Analysts Say Oil Costs May Rise Much Further If Gulf Tensions Escalate</h3>

	<p class="article-leader">Petroleum prices exploded on crisis buying to the highest
levels in more than four years.
   Prices surged $3 to $4 a barrel around the world as Iraqi
troops occupying Kuwait appeared to be digging in on Saudi
Arabia's border.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>In the U.S., crude oil futures topped $28 a barrel, a
level of domestic petroleum prices not seen since before the
oil-price collapse of early 1986.</p>
<p>Some oil analysts turned cautious, suggesting prices may
be near their peaks after the run-up of more than $10 a
barrel in recent weeks. But most said that if Middle East
tensions continued to escalate, prices could still go far
higher to close in on the records of the early 1980s of $30
to $40 a barrel.</p>
<p>"It's a free-for-all," said Michael Rothman, vice
president and a senior energy analyst at Merrill Lynch
Capital Markets. "People are concerned not only about the
loss of Iraqi and Kuwaiti oil but fear that Saudi Arabia's
production may also be in jeopardy."</p>
<p>Global sanctions continued to tighten against President
Saddam Hussein of Iraq. An embargo threatened to choke off
from world oil supplies some four million barrels a day of
crude oil and petroleum products that Iraq and Kuwait had
been exporting.</p>
<p>While industry officials were skeptical that all the oil
flowing from Iraq and Kuwait could be cut off, there were
indications yesterday that the embargo had begun to work.
Because some of the tankers that were to pick up Iraqi oil at
the Mediterranean port of Ceyhan, Turkey, sailed away after
the embargo began, Iraq stopped pumping crude through one of
its pipelines there. It also reduced the flow of oil through
another pipeline across Turkey.</p>
<p>These developments, combined with the rapid rise in oil
prices, also pushed the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries further into disarray. Over the weekend, some of
the OPEC oil ministers had indicated they might hold an
emergency session to try to take steps to slow the run-up in
oil prices.</p>
<p>The idea would be for some of those with spare producing
capacity to begin producing above the quotas that have been
so controversial until oil prices began rising. And some of
the countries that want a more moderate approach to pricing
to protect their market shares of the future are understood
to have begun stepping up their output.</p>
<p>Yesterday, however, OPEC's Vienna headquarters reported
that it hadn't been advised of any requests for an emergency
meeting. "OPEC is not doing anything," an official said,
"except to wait and see."</p>
<p>Several oil ministers called, meanwhile, for adherence to
the production quotas that were re-established last month.
The July agreement had set a ceiling of 22.5 million barrels
a day for total OPEC production and brought the United Arab
Emirates, a chronic overproducer, back into the fold with a
higher quota.</p>
<p>It's generally assumed the July agreement was nullified by
the fact that one Persian Gulf member of OPEC, Iraq, invaded
and occupied another gulf member, Kuwait. But Mana Said
Otaiba, the Emirates' oil minister, was among several
ministers yesterday urging continued compliance with the
agreement. He sent a message to Sadek Boussena, Algeria's oil
minister and OPEC president, calling on all member states not
to exceed their quotas "under the current circumstances in
the {Persian Gulf} region."</p>
<p>Immediate oil shortages aren't expected even if Iraqi and
Kuwaiti crudes are cut off completely by embargoes or by
blockades. J. Robinson West, president of Petroleum Finance
Co., noted that world oil inventories are at a nine-year high
and that demand for OPEC oil is less than the 22.5 million
barrels a day allowed under the production ceiling. But he
suggested major differences between the "actual structure of
the market and the psychology of the market."</p>
<p>Whether warranted or not, oil prices leaped record amounts
yesterday. Some U.S. oil companies increased their field
postings, what their refineries are paying, for West Texas
Intermediate, the benchmark crude, by a record $3.50 a barrel
to $26.50. On the New York Mercantile Exchange, the futures
price of a WTI-like crude for September delivery jumped a
record $3.56 to settle at $28.05 a barrel.</p>
<p>"What was a surplus in oil inventories only a week ago
suddenly is considered balance today," said William H. Brown
III, international oil analyst at Kidder, Peabody & Co.</p>
<p>According to studies by Mr. Brown, a two-month disruption
in Iraq and Kuwait exports would carry WTI to a new peak of
$29 a barrel even if other nations such as Saudi Arabia
produce more oil to fill the gap. If others in OPEC don't try
to make up the lost supplies, "you are talking $37 plus for
WTI," he said.</p>
