	<p class="article-leader">Networks used to worry how things would play in Peoria.
Now, NBC News may have come up with a great new
audience-research tool: the Queens housewife test.
   There was a heated debate last week among the staffers at
"NBC Nightly News with Tom Brokaw," the No. 3-rated network
newscast. The producers were enthusiastic about a report from
Robin Lloyd, an NBC News correspondent based in Johannesburg,
on apartheid and its effect on the education of South African
children.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>But Steve Friedman, who became executive producer of
"Nightly News" in May, wanted to ax the piece, insisting that
viewers were becoming bored with the South African story.</p>
<p>The segment, which was two minutes long and therefore
considered practically documentary length for a 22-minute
broadcast, was then screened for the "Nightly News" staffers,
who thought it should be allowed to run.</p>
<p>"I challenged the staff to prove it was a piece that would
interest a housewife in Queens," says Mr. Friedman. "The
challenge was to show me how interested the American public
was in South Africa" after the visit of Nelson Mandela.</p>
<p>Rising to the challenge was Sofia Perez, a production
assistant, who said her mother Josefina, happened to be a
housewife in Astoria, Queens, and she was sure mom would be
interested in the report. Mr. Friedman made an executive
decision: Let Josefina Perez screen the piece. If she liked
it, it would air.</p>
<p>"I didn't tell her why I was showing it to her," says Ms.
Perez. "But I took notes on her reaction. She said anyone
with a child would be interested in this."</p>
<p>And that's how, on Aug. 1, the Robin Lloyd piece was seen
by millions of viewers. "It's nice to have this kind of
debate," says Ms. Perez, who adds, "My mother was very happy
that the staff was pleased with the results."</p>
<p>It's not the first time a newscast has tried to solicit
viewer opinion. Turner Broadcasting System's Cable News
Network last month began asking viewers of its overnight
newscast to help select stories by calling a 900 number to
voice their interests.</p>
<p>Will letting selected viewers prescreen a story be the
next leap forward?</p>
<p>Mr. Friedman insists that this unusual methodology
wouldn't be used on a regular basis. "Just call the report
`Sofia's Choice,'" he says.</p>
