	<p class="article-leader">CHRYSLER CORP. asks UAW to consider new retiree
health-care financing.
   The auto maker, concerned that a contemplated
accounting-rule change could add a balance-sheet liability of
$7 an hour for each employee, has proposed shifting the cost
of retiree health benefits to a trust representing a number
of employers. Transferring the load to a so-called
multiemployer trust could spare Chrysler from listing its
retiree health liabilities on its own books, a requirement
proposed by the Financial Accounting Standards Board for
1993.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The FASB, however, may not look kindly on the Chrysler
plan. "We're looking very carefully at tightening the
definition so companies may not avoid their promise by trying
to structure something that looks like a multiemployer plan
or smells like one, but isn't," an FASB official says. The
United Auto Workers also might be reluctant to give its
assent, since a multiemployer trust, rather than Chrysler,
would be responsible for assuring retiree benefits.</p>
<p>The union is likely to resist unless General Motors Corp.
and Ford Motor Co. also join the trust.</p>
<p>MANY OTHER FIRMS push retirees to pay a bigger share of
health costs.</p>
<p>Faced with mounting medical-insurance bills and a rising
retiree population, as well as the proposed FASB rule, a
number of companies are requiring retired workers to pick up
a larger portion of their doctor and hospital bills.
Consultant A. Foster Higgins & Co. says a survey of 1,100
companies with retiree benefits shows 43% have revised their
rules in the past two years or are planning to do so this
year.</p>
<p>Fully 28% of the companies are asking retirees to pay
bigger premiums, 18% are increasing deductibles and 14% are
reducing benefits. Employers, moreover, are rewriting the
link between the corporate coverage and Medicare to reduce
the company's load for retirees over age 65. But the
cost-cutting strategies could backfire, warns Patricia Wilson
of Foster Higgins. Workers could demand raises to offset the
expected boost in health costs when they retire, she says.</p>
<p>LEISURE TOPS WORK as the main focus of Americans. But not
executives.</p>
<p>For the first time in 15 years of posing the question, the
Roper Organization finds 41% of adult Americans put leisure
ahead of work as "the important thing" in their lives; only
36% put work first. Among college students, the pattern is
even stronger. Leisure ranks paramount for 47%; 30% give
greater emphasis to work. In the executive suite, though, the
work ethic still rules.</p>
<p>"I view work as my No. 1 priority," asserts Robert Knox,
president of Prudential Capital Venture Management.
Marguerite Barnett, the University of Houston's new
president, allows she thinks about work even while playing
golf. Larry Reburn, a vice president of Sbarro Inc., says he
considers leisure "equally as important as the satisfaction I
get from work." Still, he puts in 60 to 70 hours a week at
his job. But if other Americans don't share the work drive,
Larry Lyons, a GM engineering manager, isn't especially
concerned about any loss of international competitiveness.</p>
<p>"Even the Japanese are realizing there are other things to
do at night," Mr. Lyons declares.</p>
<p>DRUG TESTING of job candidates becomes nearly universal at
major companies. CompuChem Corp. says 96% of the nation's top
100 companies screen applicants.</p>
<p>DATA-PROCESSING service firm executives received 6.2% pay
increases in 1989 and are expected to get 5.9% boosts both
this year and next, all at least 0.4 percentage point ahead
of general industry, consultant William M. Mercer Inc. says.</p>
<p>WELL, MAYBE] To workers who get other job offers, 38% of
employers say they wouldn't extend a counter bid and 21% say
they would, Management Recruiters International finds. But
38% say it all depends.</p>
<p>SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA contractors, under a pact with the
carpenters union, contribute $5 million, at the rate of 18
cents for each hour a carpenter works, to promote
poured-in-place concrete construction. The carpenters build
the concrete forms.</p>
<p>WORKERS COMP SYSTEM clogs access to medical care, a study
contends.</p>
<p>Workers hurt on the job have more trouble getting quality
medical care than people with comparable injuries from
nonwork accidents, the Massachusetts Workers' Compensation
Advisory Council says. A study for the state group by Lynch,
Ryan & Associates and Boylston Group says both sets of
patients with back injuries can get immediate care. But
"difficulty increases" as work victims seek access to
specialists and rehabilitation, the researchers say.</p>
<p>Doctors view compensation cases as less desirable because
they believe lawyers, insurers and employers interfere,
workers aren't motivated, fees are lower and paperwork is
burdensome. But the researchers say the other parties have
grievances, too, and all are "convinced the others represent
the weak link" in the compensation chain.</p>
<p>Coordinated care and speedier reimbursements could ease
patient and doctor complaints, the study suggests.</p>
<p>THE CHECKOFF: Four of five companies welcome government
efforts to simplify pension regulations, but half of them
fret the simplifications so far can only create new problems,
Buck Consultants finds. . . . And you thought you were afraid
to fly? Airline pilots in training sessions run by Scientific
Methods Inc. say they worry about cabin fires, electrical
failure, terrorism, engine failure and decompression, for
starters.</p>
