	<p class="article-leader">It's one of those steamy, ozone-alert summer days when New
York is lying defeated under a gray haze and anybody with any
sense is elsewhere. But some 565,000 people will head into
New York anyway, braving the airless PATH train stations,
buses that fling noxious fumes behind them like curses, cars
nudging their way to the tunnel and bridge tollbooths, and
other injustices of the New Jersey commute.
   Another happier 1,600 will board a ferryboat and breeze
across the Hudson in 10 to 20 minutes. The only
inconvenience? Nothing a comb can't fix.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>It's wonderful, it's marvelous, and it's true: The ferries
are back. The orange-yellow Staten Island Ferry is no longer
the lone, lonely holdout from the days when ferries were the
only means of getting to New York. Independent passenger
ferries have sprouted up along the Hudson River from
Weehawken to the Highlands, N.J., and in New York Bay from
Bay Ridge, Brooklyn to Inwood, Long Island. In all, 12
ferries now bring commuters, day-trippers, tourists and just
plain people in need of a breeze to and from Manhattan.</p>
<p>"It's a new age of mass transit," says Arthur Imperatore,
who is not an impartial observer. He started the Port
Imperial Ferry System, a bus-and-ferry service from Weehawken
to midtown and downtown Manhattan.</p>
<p>"Look at that tunnel," he says on a morning run to
Manhattan, pointing at the Lincoln Tunnel, where traffic is
backed up at least a mile. "They don't know how long it's
going to take them to get to work. We've eliminated the
uncertainty."</p>
<p>But running a ferry like a Swiss clock isn't always
enough, Mr. Imperatore has discovered. When he arrives at the
landing, four women are waiting for him. "It's not working,"
wails Donna Hamilton of Guttenberg. "We have to be at work by
9:30 and the bus didn't come until 9:15." She's referring to
Port Imperial's new expanded bus service that connects the
boats with the New Jersey Transit system's buses. "I'll fix
it," he tells her, but he looks troubled. He has a lot to do.
Mr. Imperatore is a hands-on CEO. He picks up litter, checks
a doorstop, listens to the propeller for signs of damage by
driftwood, tells a captain not to bump the dock when he
brings in the boat: "No bumper cars, all right?"</p>
<p>Mr. Imperatore's basic business is trucking and real
estate -- he is chairman of APA Transport and president of
Arcorp Properties, which includes the ferry. He projects a $1
million profit on Port Imperial this year, but his reasons
for starting up the ferry in 1986 were sentimental. He grew
up in West New York, N.J., a town perched atop the Hudsonside
cliffs known as the Palisades, and remembers walking down
"ferry hill" to ride the Weehawken Ferry for four cents.
Later he sent his trucks to Manhattan via the ferry to shave
48 cents off the cost of crossing via the Lincoln Tunnel.</p>
<p>Four years ago, Mr. Imperatore made a few runs across the
river in his yacht one Sunday, at speeds equivalent to a
ferryboat's. "It took an average of two-and-a-half minutes to
cross. I thought: How long do you stop at one stoplight? Two,
two-and-a-half minutes, sometimes. That was the beginning."</p>
<p>Arcorp's Port Imperial ferries (1-201-902-8850) run daily
to West 38th Street for $4 one way, and to Whitehall Street
for $5. Port Imperial provides parking and bus service to and
from the terminals in New Jersey and New York at extra cost.
Arcorp also operates the Hoboken Ferry (1-201-GO-FERRY) in
partnership with neighboring Hartz Mountain Industries. The
service operates under the aegis of the Port Authority of New
York and New Jersey.</p>
<p>The sparkling white boat takes riders to the Battery Park
City esplanade weekdays during rush hour and all day Saturday
for $2.</p>
<p>Among the other ferries:</p>
<p>TNT Hydrolines (1-201-228-7433) runs a high-speed ferry at
rush hour from Atlantic Highlands, N.J. ($13), and Bay Ridge,
Brooklyn ($4), to Wall Street. The most elitist of common
carriers is the Port Liberte Express, which serves residents
of Jersey City's Port Liberte development, sailing to and
from Wall Street six days a week ($5). The Rolls-Royce of
ferries, the Metro Marine Express (1-212-509-4600) serves
breakfast and afternoon cocktails and speeds from Inwood on
the south shore of Long Island to East 34th Street and Wall
Street in about an hour ($7). For $25, it will take you from
Manhattan to JFK airport, with car service to cover the last
lap.</p>
<p>Most ferries are private enterprises; the exception is the
heavily subsidized Staten Island Ferry, which doubled its
fare Aug. 1 from 25 to 50 cents, the first increase in 15
years.</p>
<p>Inflation and glamour have changed ferry travel from the
way it used to be in the first ferry era, when the ferries
were the cheapest way to go. "We always took the ferry,
because it was 25 cents and the bridge was 50 cents," says
retiree Phil Taylor, "when you could buy a tuna-fish sandwich
at the luncheonette for a quarter." He drove his car onto the
ferry in the 1930s: "The fare was 25 cents for a car, a
driver, and one passenger. Each additional person was five
cents. So the other guys would duck in the back seat to save
a nickel."</p>
<p>Ferries go way back. Raritan Indians were the first
ferrymen, using canoes to convey Dutch settlers across the
Arthur Kill to Staten Island around 1650. New York's
population was 1,500 when settlers ran a ferry across the
Harlem and Hudson rivers to start a postal service (one man
on a horse, from New York to Boston) in 1673.</p>
<p>Eighteenth-century ferry riders had to contend with long
waits: The ferry owner often ran a tavern nearby, and stood
to profit from delays. Boats were slow, too, propelled by
paddles driven by horses on a treadmill.</p>
<p>The trip was quicker with the world's first steam ferry,
built by John Stevens in 1811 in Hoboken. But Robert Fulton
in New York challenged his license, and the Supreme Court
eventually settled the matter in the famous Gibbons vs. Ogden
case, which gave Congress the power to regulate interstate
commerce. By 1900, 50 steam ferries crisscrossed the
waterways like clotheslines.</p>
<p>But the death knell had already sounded. The Brooklyn
Bridge was built in 1883, despite fervid opposition from the
ferrymen, and while the Fulton Ferry to Brooklyn managed to
run until 1924, bridges and tunnels would gradually supplant
the ferries. The Lincoln Tunnel opened in 1937; the Weehawken
Ferry closed in 1959. The "Hudson Tubes," fantastic
5,700-foot train tunnels under the Hudson River, now serving
the PATH train system, were completed in 1908; the plucky
Hoboken ferry held on till 1967.</p>
<p>The re-ferrying of New York has been quiet and slow, and
not without defeats. Three-and-a-half years ago, two
passenger ferries sprang up almost simultaneously on the
Hudson: Tradebase International's Fort Lee-Wall Street ferry,
and Arcorp's Port Imperial from Weehawken to midtown. The
Fort Lee ferry attracted fewer than 100 riders a week and
closed after four months. Port Imperial gave riders free
passage the first month to build loyalty and word-of-mouth,
and now claims a weekly ridership of 7,000.</p>
<p>One of the riders is Gilda Natko of Fort Lee. "Thank you
for this boat," she tells Mr. Imperatore as she climbs aboard
the gleaming white vessel with two sea-blue decks, smiling.</p>
