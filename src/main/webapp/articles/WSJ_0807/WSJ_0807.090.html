	<p class="article-leader">Fedders Corp. said it won't reach its sales target of $415
million this year because cool spring and summer weather hurt
the market for room air conditioners.
   The Peapack, N.J., company, whose sales totaled $216
million in the first half, didn't elaborate on the statement.
Last year, sales were $367.6 million, up 66% from 1988, as
net income rose 7.8% to $23.7 million, or $1.28 a share.</p>
