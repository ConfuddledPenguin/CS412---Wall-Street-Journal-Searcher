	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- This one is rooted in real economic problems.
   The big, scary stock-market selloffs in October 1987 and
October 1989 were triggered by program trading run amok or
buy-out deals collapsing. But the selling that has pushed the
Dow Jones Industrial Average down nearly 183 points in three
days is different. This time, though trading has been
orderly, investors are facing the twin specters of recession
and inflation. Skidding 93.31 points yesterday to close at
2716.34, the Dow industrials were, once again, down for the
year.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The tumultuous events of the past few days are shaking the
bond market, too. Most fixed-income investors are choosing
the safety of short-term Treasury bills. Meanwhile, the
prospect that rising oil prices will step up inflation is
casting a pall over long-term Treasurys, which currently
yield 8.79%. Yesterday, the Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond
plunged more than 2.5 points, or more than $25 for each
$1,000 of face amount, for the biggest one-day decline in
over three years.</p>
<p>Bearish analysts have been warning for months about a
slowing economy and what they saw as a looming recession.
Then late last week inflation was factored into the equation,
as Iraqi troops drove across the sands of Kuwait. The
invasion forced oil prices sharply higher in what appears to
be a prelude to widespread price increases on thousands of
oil-dependent products and services.</p>
<p>Now investors, many of whom only a few weeks ago were
arguing about how far the Dow could climb beyond 3000, are
struggling to determine just how wrenching the anticipated
economic slump might be. Could oil prices double? Can the
Federal Reserve pump enough money into the economy to keep
unemployment below 7% or even 8%? In view of the inflation
risks, would it? Which investments can weather both recession
and inflation? How low might the Dow Industrials go?</p>
<p>The answers aren't clear. Among the more bearish analysts,
a Dow Jones Industrial Average of 2000 isn't out of the
question.</p>
<p>"I think there's at least a high probability that the Dow
will break below 2500," says David Bostian, an economist and
market strategist at Jesup & Lamont who has been predicting a
recession for the past year. "Below that, everybody will be
getting pretty bearish. But I wouldn't bet my life that we
won't get below 2000."</p>
<p>What is clear is that it will take months at best for all
the effects of slow growth and rising prices to filter
through the economy. So investors will be under pressure to
get ready for a long, uncomfortable siege.</p>
<p>"Investors have to consider two things: what does the
market do and what does the economy do," says Abby Joseph
Cohen, chief strategist at Barclays de Zoete Wedd. "I don't
know what the market is going to do, but whatever the economy
is going to do will take several months."</p>
<p>The problems are by no means confined to the U.S. market.
In Japan, high interest rates had already clobbered Tokyo
stocks before the Iraqis invaded Kuwait. With the prospect of
costlier crude rattling a country that imports nearly all its
oil, stock prices plunged again yesterday; in less than a
week, the drop exceeds 10%. West German stocks tumbled 5.4%
yesterday, while London stocks fell 2.8%.</p>
<p>In the U.S., yesterday's decline on heavy volume was an
acceleration and deepening of the selloff that sliced 34
points off the Dow Thursday and another 55 Friday. The drops
reflected a Friday report that unemployment had climbed to
5.5% as well as from the Iraqi move. Although at one point
Friday the Dow was down 120 points, investors took heart
after the Soviet Union said it expected Iraq to begin
withdrawing troops soon.</p>
<p>The weekend brought no such indications of withdrawal.
Instead, Iraqi troops were said to be digging in while
simultaneously massing near the Saudi Arabian border -- a
threat to that even bigger oil supplier. Unnerved by news of
the routs in the Japanese and European stock markets, many
U.S. portfolio managers came to work yesterday in a selling
mood.</p>
<p>"It looks like all the people who have been holding on and
holding on are capitulating," says John Brooks, a technical
analyst at Davis, Mendel & Regenstein. "They're just throwing
in the towel."</p>
<p>Selling pressures began building even before trading
opened on the New York Stock Exchange. At Jefferies & Co.,
which trades listed stocks off the exchanges, Raymond Killian
Jr., executive vice president, says dozens of big stocks were
being offered for sale half an hour before trading began in
New York -- a sign that mutual funds were trying to raise
cash to meet many small investors' demands to get out of
equity funds.</p>
<p>When Big Board trading did open at 9:30 a.m., several
large stocks -- including Merck, Procter & Gamble and General
Electric, all components of the Dow industrials -- failed to
open because of order imbalances as portfolio managers tried
to dump them. Two of the Dow industrial stocks -- Boeing and
Allied Signal -- didn't open for trading until after 10 a.m.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the exchange called a news conference at
noon to say reassuringly that trading was progressing in an
orderly fashion. Late yesterday, Richard A. Grasso, the Big
Board's president and chief operating officer, said in an
interview that "we don't see any extraordinary measures
necessary" to prepare for today's opening. He added that the
exchange's systems worked well, commenting, "At least
logistically, there was smooth functioning of the markets."</p>
<p>However, it was the Big Board's biggest stocks that were
hit the worst. As the Dow Jones Industrial Average had risen
faster than broader market indexes so far this year, it fell
farther in the past two days. It dropped 5.2%, compared with
a 4.9% decline in the Standard & Poor's index of 500 stocks
and a 4.7% drop in the New York Stock Exchange index, which
includes every Big Board issue listed. Analysts say the Dow
industrials' bigger drop indicated some panic selling among
institutional investors as they sold the biggest, most liquid
stocks in their portfolios.</p>
<p>Not everyone is convinced that the economy is on its last
legs or that rising oil prices are going to reignite
inflation. Laszlo Birinyi, a stock-market strategist,
contends that the plunge of the past few days is just another
"market panic." He argues that selling pressure isn't as
intense as prices make it seem; rather, he says, prices are
falling because buyers are scarce. He thinks that at current
prices many stocks -- such as General Motors, with a dividend
yield of 7.2% -- are bargains.</p>
<p>"If GM doesn't work out to be a satisfactory investment,
then I submit that we're going to have some really
substantial problems," he says.</p>
<p>And James Severance, investment director for stocks at the
$20 billion Wisconsin State Investment Board, says the
pension agency has used about half of a $125 million cash
reserve to buy stocks in recent days. "We've been bearish for
quite a while, but we see some bargains developing in
individual stocks," he says. He is especially keen on some
airline stocks"they look awfully cheap" -- even though they
would be hurt by higher oil prices. He considers the prices
low enough to justify the risk.</p>
<p>Even if the economy slips into recession, this doesn't
sound the death knell for stocks. The stock market hasn't
always had a full-year decline when a recession was under
way, notes Roger Engemann, head of a money-management firm
that bears his name.</p>
<p>"To conclude that a recession would be bad for stocks
would be a mistake," he said in a letter to clients yesterday
morning. "Since 1945, there have been 13 years in which the
S&P 500 profits declined. In one of those years, the stock
market was down modestly (1957). In the other 12 of those
years, stocks soared." Annualized returns in those recession
years, such as 1980 and 1982, averaged 22% -- "twice the
long-term average of stock returns," Mr. Engemann says.</p>
<p>The optimists may be right, but more and more analysts and
money managers see things differently. While the market
rebounded handsomely after the October 1987 crash and the
October 1989 mini-crash, the pessimists see some disquieting
differences between then and now.</p>
<p>After the 1987 crash, the economic environment was very
different from today's. In 1987, the economy was still
accelerating. Indeed, it was on the verge of a significant
expansion that propelled corporate profits and consumer
confidence sharply higher. Even after the 1989 tumble, the
economy seemed relatively healthy.</p>
<p>Buoyed by that economic strength, the Dow industrials
recovered from both shocks. They hit an all-time high of
2999.75 on July 16 and 17.</p>
<p>"In 1987, there was plenty of slack in the economy," says
A.C. Moore, director of research at Argus Research. "But this
is different. The economy is shakier, and there is a real
cost increase that is going to be felt by every consumer. It
will retard some of the progress that Europeans are making
and create some real problems for the economies of Eastern
Europe and Asia."</p>
<p>Mr. Moore's biggest concern is the paucity of options for
U.S. policy makers trying to solve the problems facing the
country and the financial markets. Ever since the 1987 crash,
the Federal Reserve has been winning plaudits from investors
for its ability to shepherd the economy along. And even
though it might have seemed to be losing its touch in recent
months, the Fed still got high marks for its restrained
approach to monetary policy.</p>
<p>Now, though, the supply and price of oil -- the biggest
factor affecting the economy and the markets -- is out of the
Fed's control and in the hands of Iraq's Saddam Hussein.
"There's a new price boss at the helm who is a hawk, and
that's bad news for the West," Mr. Moore says.</p>
<p>At least some big money managers believe that the slipping
economy, coupled with the Iraqi invasion, calls for
drastically different investment decisions.</p>
<p>No doubt, strategists will start taking down their
earnings estimates for dozens of stocks. The average S&P
stock now sells for 15.4 times the past 12 months' earnings.
Arnold Kaufman, the editor of S&P's Outlook newsletter, says
if stock prices keep falling, the price-earnings ratio could
be about 12.5 (times 1990 earnings) in the weeks ahead.</p>
<p>"During the past eight recessions, the average earnings
decline from peak to trough was 22%" on the S&P 500, Mr.
Kaufman says.</p>
<p>Industry groups related to the oil industry and the
precious metals were about the only gainers yesterday.
Meanwhile, the top five second-quarter winners were at the
bottom of the pile. The medical/biotechnology group, the
best-performing group of last quarter, has fallen 8.75% in
the past three days. Commmunications companies, excluding
American Telephone & Telegraph, the second-best group in the
quarter, are down 9%.</p>
<p>Mr. Kaufman and other strategists recommend food companies
for recession-proof investing. But investors should have a
notion of how much debt these companies carry on their
balance sheets. Mr. Kaufman says investors are better off
owning food chains with lower debt levels, such as
Albertson's, rather than high-debt companies such as Safeway.</p>
<p>In any case, the current turmoil is almost paralyzing
investors. "It changes everything, but you don't know how,"
says Roland M. Machold, director of the $30 billion New
Jersey Division of Investment. "The range of possibilities of
where this thing is going to come out is so great that you
have a tendency to just freeze."</p>
