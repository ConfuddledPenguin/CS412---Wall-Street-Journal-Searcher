	<p class="article-leader">JOHANNESBURG, South Africa -- The African National
Congress suspended its 30-year armed struggle against the
white minority government, clearing the way for the start of
negotiations over a new constitution based on black-white
power sharing.
   The announcement came in the early morning hours Tuesday
after a full day of talks between the ANC and the government.
ANC leader Nelson Mandela said his organization's
infiltration of trained guerrillas and weapons into South
Africa would be stopped immediately, as would all military
activities inside the country. In return, the government said
it would begin a phased release of political prisoners and
would grant indemnity to some 20,000 ANC exiles so they can
return to South Africa. A joint ANC-government committee will
work out the details and the timing of these moves.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The marathon meeting in Pretoria -- the second
face-to-face session between the two sides since the
government unbanned the ANC and other opposition groups in
February -- seems to have cleared away the major obstacles to
full negotiations on a new constitution. Both the government
and the ANC say they hope these talks can begin by early next
year. In a joint statement, the two sides said they were
acting "in the interest of moving as speedily as possible
toward a negotiated peaceful political settlement."</p>
<p>At a news conference following the meeting, Mr. Mandela
called the suspension of the armed struggle "a very
significant concession" on the ANC's part. And South African
President F.W. de Klerk said it marked an important turning
point in bringing peace to the country, which has been
wracked by racial conflict for decades. Since the unbanning
of the ANC earlier this year and other moves by the
government to end its policies of racial segregation known as
apartheid, the level of violence has escalated, both from the
heightened political activity of the blacks and from a
right-wing white backlash.</p>
<p>Mr. Mandela and other ANC activists founded an armed wing,
called Umkhonto we Sizwe, or Spear of the Nation, in 1960
following the government's banning of the ANC. A few years
later, Mr. Mandela and many of the ANC leaders not in exile
were arrested and sentenced to life imprisonment for
conspiring to overthrow the government. Mr. Mandela was freed
from prison after 27 years in February.</p>
<p>During the years of its armed activities, the ANC
considered itself to be at war with the government. Its
guerrillas mainly targeted their attacks on government
installations and on those in the black community considered
to be government collaborators. Still, occasional bombs in
the segregated white residential areas spread fear among the
white community. In many shopping centers and cinemas in
Johannesburg, visitors are routinely body-searched before
entering.</p>
<p>In recent months, the ANC's armed struggle has been
largely dormant, though the organization has continued to
move guerrillas and arms into the country. Last month, the
government claimed it uncovered "Operation Vula," an ANC plan
drawn up in 1987 to strengthen its underground in South
Africa. The police made dozens of arrests and uncovered
several arms caches, and alleged that it was part of a plot
by the South African Communist Party to overthrow the
government in case the present negotiations fail.</p>
<p>After yesterday's meeting, Mr. Mandela said the Communist
Party, which is an ally of the ANC, also would be bound by
the agreement to suspend the armed struggle. The current and
former leaders of Umkhonto weSizwe are members of the
Communist Party as well as of the ANC.</p>
<p>Despite the suspension of its armed activities, the ANC
says it will continue with its protest politics, which
include mass marches, boycotts and strikes, until apartheid
is ended and the blacks have a share of the political power.
Through these actions, the ANC is also hoping to keep the
loyalty of many black youths, who have been the main
supporters of Umkhonto we Sizwe. Mr. Mandela said the ANC
also will continue to press the government to restrain the
police in its dealing with black protesters.</p>
