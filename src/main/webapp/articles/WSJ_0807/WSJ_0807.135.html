	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- Robert Thompson, a lobbyist and former aide
to President Bush, dropped his defiance of a Senate
subcommittee subpoena and appeared yesterday to defend his
role in helping an Arizona insurance executive buy 15
insolvent savings and loans from the government in 1988.
   While still maintaining that Sen. Howard Metzenbaum's
antitrust subcommittee has no jurisdiction in the matter, Mr.
Thompson said, "I do not want to give anyone any excuse to
say that my absence from these proceedings indicates I have
something to hide. Far from it." Mr. Thompson had previously
said he planned to battle the subcommittee's subpoena in
court.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The Arizona executive, James Fail, also appeared and said
that he invested in the thrifts because "I thought I could
contribute to the resolution of the greatest financial
disaster to strike this country since the Great Depression."</p>
<p>Mr. Metzenbaum, an Ohio Democrat, has been conducting an
inquiry into the December 1988 sale of the thrifts to Mr.
Fail, and has raised questions about whether Mr. Fail
properly disclosed to regulators legal problems an insurance
company he controlled faced in 1976 in Alabama. On certain
forms filed with the regulators, Mr. Fail noted that
securities fraud charges brought against him individually
were dismissed, but he didn't indicate that one of his
companies pleaded guilty to fraud and paid a $5,000 fine.</p>
<p>A top savings and loan regulator said at a hearing last
week that if he had known about the guilty plea he would have
asked for more information about Mr. Fail's background,
possibly blocking transaction.</p>
<p>Mr. Metzenbaum has also charged that the government gave
Mr. Fail a sweetheart deal, in which Mr. Fail put up only
$1,000 of his own money and the government pledged $1.8
billion in assistance. Mr. Fail said those assertions were
"ridiculous" because he committed to invest $120 million in
the thrift and has pledged "all of my business holdings" as
collateral for loans to raise part of the $120 million.</p>
<p>In addition, Mr. Fail said "substantially all" of the $1.8
billion "will go to the depositors and creditors of the 15
failed thrifts, paying for mistakes made long before" he
bought them. Mr. Fail merged the thrifts and now runs them as
Bluebonnet Savings Bank, based in Dallas.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, Mr. Fail was pressed assiduously by two
Republican senators, Orrin Hatch of Utah and Arlen Specter of
Pennsylvania, about the disclosure of his legal problems in
Alabama. "I admit these forms are at best incomplete," Mr.
Fail said in reference to the documents in which he neglected
to mention his company's guilty plea. But Mr. Fail maintained
that the guilty plea was disclosed in other documents and in
conversation with regulators. Concealing the plea, he
protested, would have been like "trying to slip an elephant
into a girls' dormitory."</p>
<p>But Sen. Specter, summing up his questioning of Mr. Fail,
concluded that "there was not an adequate disclosure."</p>
<p>Though Mr. Fail testified for nearly three hours, the
hearing left many questions dangling about the sale of the
thrifts. For instance, Mr. Thompson, the lobbyist, said that
as part of his compensation for making calls to regulators
and helping Mr. Fail make his bid, Mr. Fail agreed to pay him
2% of any proceeds Mr. Fail made from the thrifts.</p>
<p>But Mr. Fail said that no such agreement existed. He said
he had asked regulators whether that kind of agreement was
allowed and "they said emphatically no." The subcommittee
didn't question Mr. Thompson after he made a prepared
statement because it plans to call him back in September
after sifting through documents Mr. Thompson provided
yesterday.</p>
