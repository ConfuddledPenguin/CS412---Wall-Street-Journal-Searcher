	<p class="article-leader">Campeau Corp.'s two retailing units reported a widened
total loss of $49.2 million for the five weeks ended July 7,
reflecting slow-moving inventory that had to be marked down.
   At the same time, the two units reported an increase in
revenues, although cash flow was slightly less than planned.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>In a filing with the U.S. bankruptcy court in Cincinnati,
Federated Department Stores Inc. reported a loss of $30.6
million for June, while Allied Stores Corp. showed a loss of
$18.6 million. The losses, more severe than the $27.3 million
in losses for the units for the four weeks ended June 2,
don't include bankruptcy-related costs.</p>
<p>For the four weeks ended June 2, Federated had a loss of
$17.8 million and Allied had a loss of $9.5 million.</p>
<p>Revenues were up at both units, a reflection of aggressive
store promotions. Sales at Federated jumped 24% for the five
weeks ended July 7 to $399 million from $321.3 million for
the four weeks ended June 2. Revenue at Allied rose 15% to
$209.1 million from $181.3 million.</p>
<p>"Overall, the five weeks appear to have been a
constructive period," said Janet Mangano, an analyst at
Jesup, Josephthal & Co. "The bankruptcy filing was the
medicine they needed. I now expect them to show a profit in
the fourth quarter."</p>
<p>But Ms. Mangano noted that the company's assumptions about
sales and cash flow will be negatively affected by the
continued slowdown in consumer spending.</p>
<p>Allen Questrom, chairman and chief executive officer of
Federated and Allied, said in a statement that the company
intends to continue cleaning out older inventory. In turn,
results will be lackluster "for the next several months," he
said. Mr. Questrom also said both units "can expect to begin
to realize the benefits of these changes in the latter part
of this year."</p>
<p>The June results were positive in that the losses at
Federated and Allied were less than anticipated, the company
said. On the other hand, cash flow, or earnings before
interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization and before
bankruptcy-related reorganization costs, wasn't quite as
strong as the company had hoped.</p>
<p>The units emphasized that they are confident that they
have an adequate amount of cash on hand to meet all vendor
obligations for the Christmas selling period.</p>
<p>As of Aug. 1, Federated had $465 million in cash on hand,
the total of cash invested and unpurchased receivables.
Allied's cash on hand was $191 million.</p>
<p>Several manufacturers said they were concerned about the
continuing losses, but they intend to ship Christmas orders
as received from Allied and Federated chains.</p>
<p>Federated and Allied filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy-law
protection Jan. 15.</p>
