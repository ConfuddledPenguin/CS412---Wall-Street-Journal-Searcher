	<p class="article-leader">Researchers pulled off a genetic trick that could turn
dairy cows into pharmaceutical factories.
   Specifically, the researchers combined a human gene that
produces a clot-dissolving protein with a bovine gene
involved in milk production in cattle. When the combined
human-bovine genetic material was inserted into test mice,
the mice began producing milk that was rich in the human
clot-dissolving protein.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The same genetic trick is now being attempted in dairy
cows in hopes the cows will produce milk rich in a number of
human proteins of medicinal and nutritional value, said
Jonathan MacQuitty, president of GenPharm International Inc.,
a closely held Dutch-American biotechnology company based in
Mountain View, Calif., and Leyden, the Netherlands.</p>
<p>The significance of the new genetic trick rests in
researchers' selection of a bovine gene that could prompt the
animal, whether mouse or cow, to produce a human protein in
the milk in potentially commercial quantities.</p>
<p>The researchers said that in their experiment, the
genetically altered mice were producing the human
clot-dissolving protein at the rate of one to two milligrams
per milliliter of milk. Had the same trick been accomplished
in a cow, the cow would produce five gallons of milk a day
containing 20 grams of the protein.</p>
<p>The researchers reported their feat in the May issue of
Bio/Technology, a scientific and trade journal. The
experiment was carried out by Elizabeth Lacy and Nils Lonberg
of Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in New York and
Harry Meade and Liora Gates of Biogen Inc. in Cambridge,
Mass. Mr. Lonberg subsequently went to GenPharm in Mountain
View which, under a license from Biogen, is extending the
research into cattle.</p>
<p>In recent years, genetic engineers have talked seriously
of having animals produce genetically engineered drugs in
their milk. The ultimate goal is for cows, nanny goats or
possibly ewes to replace the bacterial fermentation tanks
that currently produce genetically engineered drugs. So doing
requires the foreign gene that makes the drug to be
"expressed" or turned on in the mammary tissue of the animal.</p>
<p>In other experiments in the past three years genetically
altered mice have produced foreign proteins in their milk. In
these cases, scientists took human genes and linked them to
mouse genes that function in the mouse mammary glands. The
mice produced the human proteins in their milk but in amounts
too small to be commercially important.</p>
<p>The new trick differs in that the scientists hooked a
human gene to a bovine gene directly involved in making milk
in a cow. The bovine gene produces casein, a protein that
accounts for about a third of the total protein found in
cow's milk. In a move that proved to be vitally important,
the researchers also plucked out the pieces of genetic
material at each end of the casein gene that control its
functioning, the so-called regulatory segments.</p>
<p>The research team then took the gene for human urokinase
and spliced it into the middle of the casein gene. Urokinase
is a protein, normally produced in the kidney, which can
dissolve blood clots. It is commercially produced by Abbott
Laboratories as a pharmaceutical.</p>
<p>The hybrid bovine-human gene, complete with the regulatory
segments, was then implanted in mouse embryos. Three mice
carrying the gene were subsequently born, one of which passed
the gene along to its progeny to create a line of inbred mice
with the hybrid bovine-human gene.</p>
<p>The lactating females of this line of mice are producing
milk containing large amounts of human urokinase. The key to
the trick, the researchers said, was including the
all-important regulatory segments with the hybrid gene.
"Because these bovine regulatory sequences function correctly
in mice, we assume they should be at least as effective . . .
in transgenic cows," they suggested.</p>
<p>GenPharm's Mr. MacQuitty said researchers in the
Netherlands have now used the bovine casein gene and its
regulatory segments to splice other foreign genes into the
embryos of cattle.</p>
