	<p class="article-leader">FRANKFURT, West Germany -- "After two, three or four
years, German reunification will come to a good end," says
Wolfgang Seidel, who manages investments totaling 5.7 billion
West German marks ($3.43 billion) for Frankfurt-Trust.
   "But in the meantime . . . ." Mr. Seidel makes a wrenching
motion with his hands, the way one would strangle a chicken
-- or a stock market.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>For West Germany's formerly high-flying stock market, the
wrenching has already begun. The joy ride fueled by the
collapse of the Berlin Wall in November is screeching to a
halt as sobering realities set in about the costs and
uncertainties of unifying the two Germanys.</p>
<p>With the first major step toward unity set for Sunday,
when the two economies are joined, there are few near-term
bulls in Frankfurt. Many money managers and analysts expect
that at best the market will drift sideways at least through
the end of the year, when the economic picture may become
clearer.</p>
<p>The market, sensing that a business miracle was at hand,
surged when the Wall fell. The DAX Index of the Frankfurt
Stock Exchange, largest of West Germany's eight exchanges,
rocketed more than 30% in the winter to a record 1968.55 on
March 30. Buyers from the U.S., Japan and Britain provided
the steam: Net foreign purchases of German equities totaled
17.56 billion marks in the fourth quarter, eclipsing the
record for an entire year -- 15.17 billion marks in 1986.</p>
<p>But the foreign buying spree clearly is over, money
managers say. Net purchases by foreigners dropped to 7.46
billion marks in the first quarter, and when government
figures for April are disclosed soon, it's expected they will
show that foreigners, who historically have dominated the
West German market, became net sellers. Yesterday, despite a
recent low-volume technical rally by domestic buyers, the DAX
stood at 1895.17, down 3.7% from the record.</p>
<p>"A few months ago people were saying, `Wow] Things are
really going to change,'" says Thomas R. Holmes,
institutional sales manager for Schroder Munchmeyer Hengst &
Co., a money management arm of Lloyds Bank Group that caters
mainly to U.S. and British investors. "But now they're coming
to realize that Rome wasn't built in a day, and that
reunification isn't going to be free of charge."</p>
<p>Mr. Holmes says he is advising clients, "If you look for
any concrete results near term, you'll be fooling yourselves.
It doesn't make much sense to overweight the German market in
portfolios -- there aren't that many bargains." He suggests
that West German equities make up 6% of portfolios of
non-U.S. investments.</p>
<p>And he warns that the market is likely to be thin and
volatile in coming months. Dealer inventories are low because
high interest rates have pushed up the cost of carrying
securities, Mr. Holmes says.</p>
<p>"It would be wrong to be bullish {in the} medium term and
to advise foreigners to get into the West German market,"
says Jorg Schreiweis, head of equity research at Deutsche
Bank. "I think 1720 is a fair value for the market -- that
would be a buying opportunity."</p>
<p>Rolf Conen, Deutsche Bank's director of quantitative
research, says stocks currently should make up 30% of a
German investment portfolio, down from 75% Jan. 1. About half
the portfolio should be in cash, double the recommended level
seven months ago, he says, and the rest in bonds.</p>
<p>At Frankfurt-Trust, a 180 million mark fund for German
equities is 27% in cash, up from 20% at year's end. "You can
see our cautious attitude," says Mr. Seidel.</p>
<p>Concerns about the cost of unification center on the heavy
borrowing that West Germany will have to undertake to prop up
East Germany's infrastructure and social services. The risk
is that the borrowing will drive up already high interest
rates, or at least keep them around 9%.</p>
<p>That would be more bad news for stocks. Interest rates
took off this year in anticipation of such borrowing, helping
to cool the stock market boom. "Why should I invest in
equities when I'm getting 9% in the bond market?" asks Peter
G. Schwarz, head of Merrill Lynch & Co.'s German capital
markets operations.</p>
<p>Prospective government borrowings to support East Germany
already total about 125 billion marks into the mid-1990s.
There also are other programs that could result in borrowings
of as much as 217 billion marks more.</p>
<p>Some people are concerned that even more borrowings might
be at hand. The West German postal and telegraph system's
recent announcement that it intends to borrow 30 billion
marks for improvements in the East "was disturbing to equity
investors," says Merrill Lynch's Mr. Schwarz. "The investors
are asking, `What else?' It isn't measurable what we're going
to need."</p>
<p>Other factors also threaten stocks. Corporate earnings are
beginning to weaken, influenced partly by the flagging U.S.
and British economies. At Schroder Munchmeyer, analysts have
reduced 1990 earnings projections for 28% of the 70 West
German companies they follow and have raised only 12%.</p>
<p>And a big rush by corporations to sell new stock and
rights into the rising market in late 1989 and early 1990
forebodes a dilution of per-share earnings. New issues from
October to March soared to almost 17 billion marks, about
equal to the total of the previous six quarters.</p>
<p>While flagship stocks such as Deutsche Bank, Volkswagen,
Allianz and Siemens remain in many portfolios, retailing
stocks have been a major casualty. Once expected to benefit
handsomely from a perceived East German demand for Western
consumer goods, companies such as Karstadt, Kaufhof and
Horten are being dropped from portfolios and downgraded by
analysts.</p>
<p>Says Peter Pietsch, a Commerzbank economist: "Many East
Germans are going to be quite cautious in spending money.
They know they may lose their jobs. Some plan to open their
own businesses and are going to save money for that. I'm not
convinced that you're going to see a big rush for Western
goods."</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Tokyo stocks retreated Thursday on moderate
profit-taking and arbitrage selling, traders said.</p>
<p>The Nikkei index of 225 issues fell 206.56 points to
32106.19. Volume on the first section was estimated at 450
million shares, down from 630 million shares Wednesday.
Losers outnumbered winners 517-440, while 167 issues were
unchanged.</p>
<p>At midmorning in Tokyo Friday, the Nikkei index was up
65.79 points to 32171.98.</p>
<p>On Thursday, the Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues
listed in the first section dropped 12 points, or 0.51%, to
2350.40.</p>
<p>The Second Section Index rose 22.85 points, or 0.55%, to
4178.62. Volume in the section was estimated at 25 million
shares, down from 29.9 million shares.</p>
<p>Traders said stocks opened weaker, pressured by small
amounts of arbitrage selling. Prices were further weighed
down by an expected amount of profit-taking midmorning, as
the Nikkei had gained more than 1200 points in the previous
two trading days, the traders said.</p>
<p>But large brokerage houses tried to give the market some
support, buying some high-technology issues.</p>
<p>New money from investment trust funds, along with some
dealer buying, also joined brokerage-house support for
quality issues, but the broader market remained soft, traders
said.</p>
<p>High-tech shares mostly gained. Advantest rose 110 yen (71
cents) to 6,400 yen ($41.45) a share. Sony added 100 to
8,970, and TDK rose 130 to 7,450. Kyocera rose 120 to 8,750.</p>
<p>Declining issues included Mitsubishi Trust, down 120 to
1,910, Seven-Eleven, down 220 to 7,560, and Shintom, down 200
to 5,800 yen.</p>
<p>In London, stocks ended a lackluster session lower, as a
spate of recent profit warnings and poor corporate reports
blew away some of the market's gusto. Dealers said volume was
thin as investors awaited today's expiration of the
near-month Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100 futures
contract.</p>
<p>The FT-SE 100 Share Index fell 17.8 points to 2355.7, the
intraday low.</p>
<p>The Financial Times 30-Share Index fell 14.8 points to
1887.8. Volume was 448.1 million shares, up from 389 million
Wednesday.</p>
<p>Sentiment was damaged generally and in the stores sector
specifically, dealers said, by a profit warning late
Wednesday from retailer Burton Group. Poor results from BPB
Industries, a maker of plasterboard and building products,
hurt the house builders and construction sectors.</p>
<p>Burton fell 23 pence (40 cents) to 126 pence ($2.20) a
share after the announcement of expected weak sales in 1990.
Other stocks in the sector dropped, including Marks &
Spencer, down 5 to 235, Kingfisher, off 10 to 347, Great
Universal Stores, off 25 at #10.29, and Sears, down 4 to
95.5.</p>
<p>BPB Industries closed unchanged at 231 after reporting a
38% slump in fiscal 1990 pretax profit. One dealer said the
stock was able to hold steady because it had slumped in
recent days in anticipation of the results.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, share prices closed higher in Zurich,
Amsterdam, Stockholm, Milan and Madrid, lower in Frankfurt
and Brussels and little changed in Paris. South African gold
stocks closed higher.</p>
<p>In Asian and Pacific markets, stocks ended lower in
Sydney, Singapore, Seoul, Manila and Wellington and were
mixed in Hong Kong. Taipei was closed.</p>
<p>Here are price trends on the world's major stock markets,
as calculated by Morgan Stanley Capital International
Perspective, Geneva. To make them directly comparable, each
index is based on the close of 1969 equaling 100. The
percentage change is since year-end.</p>
