	<p class="article-leader">The Securities and Exchange Commission appears ready to
press ahead on a proposal by four exchanges that would allow
more than one exchange to list options on a single stock.
   The plan -- submitted by the Chicago Board Options
Exchange and the New York, American and Pacific stock
exchanges -- would create electronic links of options
trading, allowing options to be bought and sold at the best
price on any exchange, much like stocks. The plan is likely
to keep the SEC on schedule for its target of January for a
new options-trading system.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>In January, the SEC ordered the exchanges to come up with
a plan by tomorrow to link the markets and allow freer
options trading. Currently, most options are allocated by a
lottery system to a single exchange and can be traded only
through that market. That provides lucrative exclusive
franchises for the exchanges.</p>
<p>The SEC has contended that those monopolies don't benefit
the consumer. But the exchanges fought the plan for years,
arguing that allowing several exchanges to list the same
options would reduce liquidity in the market. Moreover, the
smaller exchanges worried that linking the markets would put
them at a competitive disadvantage.</p>
<p>"We're very encouraged," said SEC Chairman Richard
Breeden. "We have concluded that it is unquestionably
feasible. The next step now is moving toward implementation."</p>
<p>The four exchanges submitted their plan, called Public
Investors Privileged Express, or PIPE, which now appears to
be the front-runner. The Philadelphia Stock Exchange,
however, offered a different plan, called Auction Intermarket
System, or AIMS.</p>
<p>The SEC said the plans are under review. But the next step
is likely to be an attempt by agency staffers to bridge the
differences between the two plans. If that doesn't work, the
agency has statutory authority to approve any proposal -- or
write its own. Staffers appear to be leaning toward accepting
the PIPE plan. "We see an ability for the type of linkage
proposed by the four exchanges," said Richard Ketchum, SEC
market regulation director.</p>
<p>The agency would then ask the exchanges to file a joint
rule proposal, which would then be released for public
comment. After the comment period, the SEC could grant final
approval for the plan.</p>
<p>Options give a holder the right, but not the obligation,
to trade a security at a predetermined price within a set
period.</p>
<p>In January, the SEC permitted any options exchange to
trade options on any exchange-traded stock as long as no
other market was trading options on the stock and it met
certain requirements in net income, number of shareholders
and price. More than one exchange can trade stocks options on
any over-the-counter stock that meets regulatory rules.</p>
<p>The SEC could decide by tomorrow to phase in another
interim step, allowing an exchange to trade options on a
maximum of 10 issues that have options trading elsewhere.
However, the SEC has set a target of Jan. 21, 1991, to
eliminate all exclusive trading privileges.</p>
<p>Some industry observers expect that to lead to exchanges
leaving the options business or merging. "There is not enough
business to go around for five options exchanges," said
Richard Donsky, Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc.'s director of
options. "I guarantee that one year after multiple listing is
fully adopted there won't be five exchanges."</p>
<p>The PIPE and AIMS proposals are identical on many points
but differ in one key area -- time priority. This feature
only comes into play when more than one exchange is showing
the same price for an option. Under the Philadelphia plan,
the order would automatically go to the exchange that had
posted that price first. Under the PIPE plan, however, the
exchange where the order was first directed would have a
chance to improve its quote and fill the order.</p>
<p>Nicholas Giordano, president of the Philadelphia Stock
Exchange, says AIMS provides an incentive for market makers
to show their best price early. "That's clearly the best for
the public investor," he said.</p>
<p>But CBOE President Charles Henry said PIPE will allow
brokerage firms to route their orders to a selected exchange.
"They will select an exchange based on price, liquidity and
the charges imposed by the exchanges for filling the order,"
he said.</p>
<p>Mr. Giordano said he offered a compromise in a recent
letter to the SEC. He said that the Philadelphia exchange
would be willing to accept a system that doesn't incorporate
time priority as long as the SEC makes clear that the system
would be only an evolutionary step toward one that does. In
addition, he wants the system to be used to trade newly
listed options only. Advocates for both plans say that 18
months will be needed to create an operational system.</p>
<p>Andrew Schwarz, senior partner in a specialist firm on the
Amex, said he thinks the SEC will accept the compromise that
the Philadelphia exchange has offered because it is the path
of least resistance. "Everybody is unhappy and happy with
parts of the proposal," he said. "That tells me it is
probably the right one."</p>
