	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- See Walt Disney Co. start a children's book
publishing company.
   Watch the competition quake.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Just as Disney started its own record label from scratch
last year rather than buy into the high-priced market, the
Burbank, Calif., company is gearing up to be a major player
in children's books. Its impact could be tremendous.
Children's books have been a booming market in recent years,
and rather than just continue to license other publishers to
produce hundreds of books based on its famous characters,
Disney has decided to build its own franchise.</p>
<p>"We expect this to be a very sizable publishing entity and
very competitive," says Charles Wickham, group vice president
for Disney Publishing, part of Disney's fast-growing consumer
products division. Under the direction of Chairman Michael
Eisner, Disney is vastly expanding its licensing activities
and tightening its control over the images of Disney
characters in licensed products.</p>
<p>The first books won't come out until next year, but Disney
has already hired two respected juvenile-book veterans,
rented office space in New York and begun plans for three
separate publishing divisions. In addition to starting Disney
Press, which will publish books based on Disney characters
and movies, the company will expand Muppet Press, to be
acquired as part of Henson Associates Inc., which until now
has mainly licensed books to other publishers. A third
imprint, still unnamed, will publish high-quality juvenile
books without a Disney or Muppet connection.</p>
<p>Already, publishers of children's books are apprehensive
about the intrusion of such a powerful rival in a genteel but
increasingly competitive industry.</p>
<p>"We're agog over what they might do," says Brenda Bowen,
editor in chief of juvenile books for Henry Holt & Co. "Our
fear is that Disney money will lure away top artists and
writers. Maybe they'll promise to make their books into
movies. Already, this business has gotten so competitive."</p>
<p>To head its children's publishing operations, Disney hired
Elizabeth Gordon, who spent 16 years at News Corp.'s Harper &
Row, long a highly regarded publisher of children's books.
Lauren Wohl, a librarian before she spent years running
marketing departments for children's book imprints, including
Harper's, was named director of marketing. Editors and art
directors have yet to be hired. The two executives say they
will sign up unknown new authors, as well as lure established
authors from other houses.</p>
<p>Ms. Gordon says Disney Books will come out with about 24
books in the spring of 1991, when the Muppet Press will
publish about the same number of titles. The new, unnamed
imprint won't start publishing titles until the fall of 1991.</p>
<p>Disney already hauls in millions of dollars in fees from
licenses it sells to other publishers, and those licenses
won't automatically be taken back by Disney when they expire,
says Ms. Gordon. Nor will the Muppet licenses.</p>
<p>Many of the existing books with Disney characters are
mass-market paperbacks or less expensive hard-covers, mostly
sold in the remainder market or on sale tables. "Very few
Disney books are now sold in the part of the store that sells
children's classics," Ms. Wohl says. "We want to make fancier
Disney books so that when a child is born, they will
automatically get one of ours, along with staples like `Pat
the Bunny.'"</p>
<p>Ms. Wohl says Disney also will go after libraries and the
school market, where it has no presence now, and will design
new formats. "Why couldn't Mickey Mouse be part of a new
reading textbook?" she asks.</p>
<p>Many of the established children's book publishers are
owned by powerful parent companies, such as News Corp. and
MCA Inc., which owns Putnam Berkley. And all the major
publishers have aggressively expanded their number of
juvenile titles, copies published and marketing budgets in
recent years.</p>
<p>But it's hard to find anybody in the book business with
more marketing muscle or greater name recognition with kids
and parents than Disney. The Disney books will be sold not
only at Disney theme parks, but at the expanding chain of
Disney stores (there are about 56 stores in 25 states so far)
springing up in tonier shopping malls.</p>
<p>In addition, Disney may choose to promote its books in its
new Disney Adventures magazine for children, which will be
sold in supermarket checkout lines starting in October, or in
its comic books, which it started publishing again this
spring for the first time in 50 years. The new magazine will
be promoted this summer on the back of 33 million boxes of
Kellogg's corn flakes, a massive splash that could be copied
someday for Disney's children's books.</p>
<p>Still, the biggest money in children's books comes from
established companies whose well-written, attractive volumes
become classics and sell generation after generation. Disney
has a long way to go to prove itself in that category, some
publishers say.</p>
<p>"They've got qualified people and great name recognition,"
says Stephen Roxburgh, publisher of juvenile books for
Farrar, Straus & Giroux. But "you can't just add water to be
a major player in this business. The market is so competitive
between heavy players already that we may be reaching a
plateau {in sales of kids books}. The bottom line is the
books, and Disney has got to get quality material to earn
their credibility."</p>
