	<p class="article-leader">ALEXANDRIA, Va. -- Kay Jewelers Inc. said it arranged an
$80 million revolving credit agreement designed to meet
working-capital needs through next January, replacing an $86
million line of credit.
   Kay also said that three directors invested $5 million in
the company and have pledged to invest another $5 million
later in the year.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Kay, which spent much of the spring trying to ease its
credit crunch, said it also renewed a $90 million
letter-of-credit commitment that will support its credit-card
receivables program with NCNB National Bank.</p>
<p>The new agreements leave Kay with about $15 million in
free credit and cash infusions to tide it over until the
fourth quarter. Jewelry retailers such as Kay typically have
negative cash flow for the first nine months of the year. As
of March 31, Kay had only $114,000 in cash.</p>
<p>The $15 million "should be more than sufficient for our
working capital requirements" through Jan. 31, said Michael
Zarraga, Kay's treasurer. In addition to operating expenses,
Kay has a $1 million payment on its senior debt due Aug. 1.</p>
<p>In connection with the latest transactions, Kay said three
directors of the company who also are major shareholders --
Jorg Bucherer, Oliver Stahel and Chairman Anthonie van Ekris
-- invested $5 million in Kay in exchange for subordinated
convertible debentures.</p>
<p>Between mid-March and mid-May, four of Kay's bank lenders
pulled about $16.5 million in credit lines. Three of them
sought to withdraw $32 million more but ended up joining the
new revolving-credit accord, Mr. Zarraga said. The accord is
secured by all of Kay's inventory.</p>
