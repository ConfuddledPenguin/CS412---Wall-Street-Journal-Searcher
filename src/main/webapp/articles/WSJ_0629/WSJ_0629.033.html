	<p class="article-leader">Tuesday is the centennial of the Sherman Act, the
foundation of U.S. antitrust policy; and antitrust policy is
one of America's most significant contributions to the
science of government. It is time to take stock, and to
consider the prospects for the future in light of the lessons
of the past.
   The beginnings were not auspicious. In its inception the
Sherman Act was a populist, agrarian measure, enigmatically
worded, weakly enforced, opposed by the professional
economics community, handicapped by then notions of the
limited scope of congressional power. Nevertheless, by the
turn of the century the courts had laid the cornerstone for
effective enforcement by holding that the act forbade
cartelization (price-fixing) even if the cartel charged a
"reasonable" price; this was the "per se" rule.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>By World War I it was more or less settled that the
members of cartels or price-fixing conspiracies would not be
allowed to circumvent the per se rule of illegality by
merging and both the oil and the tobacco trusts had been
dismembered. The strict prohibition of price-fixing by
competitors, and of mergers by competitors to create monopoly
power, remains the core of the Sherman Act. Subsequent
enactments outlawed mergers that do not create a monopoly,
but facilitate cartelization by substantially reducing the
number of major competitors in a market.</p>
<p>With the enormous strengthening in recent decades of the
remedies for antitrust violations, and with the promulgation
by the Department of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission
of detailed and economically sophisticated merger guidelines,
we now have an antitrust policy that, seemingly at reasonable
social cost, provides substantial protection for competition.
In so doing it increases the output of goods and services and
reduces their price, and decreases socially wasteful
expenditures on organizing cartels and monopolies.</p>
<p>But I have gotten ahead of myself and have ignored the
dark side of our antitrust history. The period of "normalcy"
ushered in by the election of Warren Harding as president in
1920 was a period of dormancy for antitrust enforcement, as
was the early New Deal -- some of whose luminaries thought
antitrust passe and blamed the Depression on excessive
competition. Assistant Attorney General Thurman Arnold
reinvigorated antitrust enforcement in the early 1940s, which
was fine, but he and his successors also began attempting to
use antitrust for improper purposes -- to promote quixotic
political goals such as restoring a nation of small
businessmen, to redistribute wealth and to implement
fallacious or untested economic theories.</p>
<p>In a bipartisan wave of ill-conceived but zealously
pursued enforcement that crested in the 1960s and early
1970s, attacks were mounted against trivial mergers in the
highly competitive retail food industry, against franchising
and other methods of organizing the distribution of goods and
services, against conglomerate mergers and takeover attempts
and against the competitive practices of large and successful
firms such as IBM, AT&T, and Kodak.</p>
<p>Now distribution, both retail and wholesale, happens to be
-- not despite but because of franchising and other
innovative methods -- the thing that American business does
best, no thanks to antitrust law. It is also the most
competitive sector of the economy. On both counts the amount
of attention the antitrust agencies and private plaintiffs
paid to the distribution sector was extraordinarily perverse.
The suits against conglomerate mergers, especially the suits
brought by targets of hostile takeover attempts, served only
to retard the emergence of an effective market for corporate
control.</p>
<p>There was a time in the 1970s where almost every one of
America's best firms -- the flagships of capitalism, the
firms that were the envy of the other nations -- was under
antitrust siege; in retrospect only the assault on AT&T made
sense, and that because AT&T was a regulated firm and the
antitrust suits brought against it were in reality ingenious
(and ultimately successful) efforts to undermine an
anticompetitive regulatory scheme. Too often the antitrust
suits in the period I am describing were brought by or on
behalf of inefficient competitors against their deservedly
more successful rivals.</p>
<p>With the appointment of William Baxter as head of the
antitrust division in 1981, and, beginning the same year, of
conservative judges at all levels of the federal judiciary,
antitrust enforcement was gradually pruned back until today
the excesses so characteristic of earlier decades are for the
most part memories. The number of antitrust suits is down.
The targets are for the most part price fixers, not efficient
producers and distributors. No longer is the termination of a
retail distributor an occasion for suit.</p>
<p>But the antitrust recession is not only to be explained by
changes in politics and personnel. The growth of
international trade in the American economy has enlarged
American markets and increased the number of competitors. As
competitive pressures increase, the temptation to use
antitrust to make socio-political points fades; the silly
posturing about "bigness" becomes not only quaint, but
socially costly, and antitrust rightly becomes reconceived as
an instrument toward an efficient economy.</p>
<p>Mr. Baxter and his immediate successors could make a
success of their job by presenting themselves, entirely
accurately, as participants in the deregulation movement.
Antitrust had become a cumbersome regulatory scheme; they
changed that. Now that deregulation has been accomplished and
antitrust restored to its proper and limited role, the proper
role of antitrust chiefs is as caretakers of antitrust
policy. That role may be too modest to satisfy the ambitious.
It has taken the nation a hundred years to develop a rational
and effective antitrust policy; we must hope that government
officials will respect the achievement and resist the clamor
from those who want to turn antitrust in anticompetitive
directions.</p>
