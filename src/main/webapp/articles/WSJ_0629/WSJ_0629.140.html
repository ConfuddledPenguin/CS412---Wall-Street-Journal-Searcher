	<p class="article-leader">A.P. Moeller, a big Danish shipping company, said it would
no longer carry crude oil to the U.S. because the potential
liabilities for spills have become "unbearable."
   The decision by Moeller, which operates the Maersk
shipping line and owns one of the world's largest independent
oil-tanker fleets, is expected to increase pressure on
Congress to ratify international protocols that would limit
the liability of a shipowner involved in an oil spill.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Disagreement over whether the U.S. should participate in
the protocols is a major factor holding up congressional
approval of oil spill legislation.</p>
<p>Some industry officials have warned that unlimited
liability could drive away the more responsible shipping
lines, leaving less-scrupulous owners to deliver crude to the
U.S. and thus increasing the danger of spills.</p>
<p>Moeller's statement came two weeks after Royal Dutch/Shell
Group said it would restrict U.S. oil shipments in vessels it
owns or manages because of the liability problem. Societe
Nationale Elf Aquitaine, the French state-owned oil company
which owns just one tanker, said recently that it would stop
using the ship to carry crude to the U.S. And a spokesman for
Petrofina S.A. said the Belgian oil company was "seriously"
considering such a halt for its fleet.</p>
<p>The shipowners' concern grew in the wake of last year's
Exxon Valdez accident off the coast of Alaska and executives
say that their legal liabilities are unlimited in some U.S.
states and that the risk is uninsurable.</p>
