	<p class="article-leader">TOKYO -- The U.S. and Japan completed a wide-ranging
economic pact that both sides proclaimed would ease tensions
by reducing their $49 billion trade imbalance and making
Japan's economy "more harmonious" with the rest of the world.
   But the first full report of the so-called Structural
Impediments Initiative drew a cool response from several
congressmen, economists and business executives, many of whom
have ridiculed the process since it began a year ago.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The two nations promised each other a laundry list of
large-scale and small-scale changes, with Japan vowing to
open up more to outsiders and to use more of its capital
domestically. Its proposals include spending more on public
works, toughening its antitrust policies and streamlining its
distribution system. The U.S. pledged to shape up its economy
by, among other things, balancing its budget, boosting worker
training and increasing research and development spending.</p>
<p>Negotiators also agreed to keep the SII process alive
indefinitely, with regular meetings and annual reports for at
least the next three years, and, according to U.S. officials,
the flexibility to bring up new issues within the current
general framework.</p>
<p>President Bush, in a statement released in Washington
after the four-day Tokyo talks concluded, said: "We expect
that the structural policy actions to be taken will have a
positive effect on our economies, encouraging open and
competitive markets, promoting sustained world economic
growth, contributing to a reduction in global payments
imbalances, and enhancing the quality of life in both Japan
and the United States. Although our efforts on SII are
bilateral, the effects will be beneficial for the entire
world."</p>
<p>The amicable agreement also follows three months of
generally friendly trade talks between the two nations in
many sectors, and some officials declared a new era of
reduced economic tensions. "Continuing success on SII can
help us move away from trade disputes," Mr. Bush added, "thus
allowing us to focus our efforts on more positive activities
as we continue to develop a global partnership between our
two countries."</p>
<p>Mr. Bush took an active role in the talks, summoning Prime
Minister Toshiki Kaifu to California in March to spur Japan
to action, and talking with Mr. Kaifu by phone Wednesday
night to help conclude an agreement. The two leaders pushed
to complete the pact before the summit meeting of the seven
leading industrial democracies in Houston begins in early
July.</p>
<p>But not everyone is convinced of SII's significance. "I
really think SII is irrelevant," James C. Abegglen, a Japan
scholar and Tokyo-based business consultant, said earlier
this week. "People would just like to be rid of it."
Different critics have different reasons, from disappointment
with earlier promising-sounding U.S.-Japan trade agreements,
to questions about the pact's economic assumptions, to
suspicion about whether the two governments really have the
will to follow through on policies they have endorsed many
times before.</p>
<p>Even enthusiastic backers of the process worry that it
won't accomplish one of its major goals: easing mounting
anti-Japanese pressure in the U.S. Congress. John B. Taylor,
a member of President Bush's Council of Economic Advisers,
said at a news conference in Tokyo that it could take from
three to five years for the SII measures to help reduce the
trade imbalance. Meanwhile, many economists say that Japan's
trade surplus with the U.S is likely to escalate in the next
few months, as the yen stays weak against the dollar. And
several potentially vicious trade spats loom in the next few
months, such as battles for access to Japan's rice and
semiconductor markets.</p>
<p>Sen. Max Baucus (D., Mon.), who heads the international
trade subcommittee of the Senate Finance Committee, called
the report "a disappointment." While acknowledging that the
agreement "does demonstrate progress in some areas," Sen.
Baucus said that "even with the SII report, Japan will likely
remain the most closed developed country market." House
Majority Leader Richard Gephardt (D., Mo.), another frequent
advocate of a tougher Japan trade policy said: "Today's
announcement reminds me of a good-news, bad-news joke. The
good news is that we've reached an agreement. The bad news is
that the agreement will do little or nothing to address the
size of the trade deficit or the systematic targeting of key
U.S. industries. Unfortunately the joke is being played on
American farmers, workers and businesses."</p>
<p>The two nations created the SII process in July as a way
of addressing the increasingly politically touchy trade
situation in a comprehensive manner, rather than relying
simply on market-specific feuds. They produced an interim
report in April that provided the framework for this week's
agreement.</p>
<p>The SII discussions have transformed many policies
traditionally considered purely domestic matters into
international trade issues. Indeed, Mr. Kaifu, in a statement
praising the SII report, stressed the domestic benefits of
the changes: "I am confident that the SII will greatly
contribute to improving the Japanese standard of living."</p>
<p>But Japan has at times complained of U.S. "interference."
And while both countries are supposed to make major changes,
most of the pressure during the talks fell on Japan.</p>
<p>The 57-page section on Japan's policies includes: reducing
the average length required to obtain a patent to two years
from three years; encouraging more criminal prosecutions of
alleged antitrust violations, as well as more private
antitrust lawsuits; government scrutiny and restrictions on
tight business relationships among Japan's business groupings
known as "keiretsu"; changes in laws that discourage foreign
investment; reforming land policies to bring down land
prices; and encouraging imports by setting up a special
import advisory board under the prime minister.</p>
<p>The main disagreement during the last week of talks, which
stretched on two days more than scheduled, was over Japan's
level of public investment. The U.S. argued that Japan should
significantly increase its public works as a way of shifting
more of its resources to its own economy, while the Japanese
said too much spending could fuel inflation.</p>
<p>Japan ultimately outlined a detailed 430 trillion yen
($2.78 trillion) 10-year public works program, down to
numerical goals for increasing sidewalks, sewers and
seashore. That total is more than Japan originally pledged,
but below the U.S. request of 500 trillion yen.</p>
<p>Japan also reaffirmed its commitment to cut its current
account surplus. A month ago, some Japanese government
officials infuriated the U.S. by arguing that Japan should
preserve its surplus to export capital to needy nations.</p>
<p>The U.S. only released a summary of its package. But
officials said the most important part was the statement
issued by President Bush earlier in the week that the
administration was ready to increase tax revenues to cut the
budget deficit. S. Linn Williams, deputy U.S. trade
representative, hinted that the SII talks may have helped
influence the timing of Mr. Bush's announcement.</p>
<p>Many of the provisions still require legislative approval
in both nations before they become policy. The Japanese
cabinet endorsed its half of the program at a brief 10 p.m.
cabinet meeting Thursday night.</p>
<p>Although the two nations will issue annual progress
reports, it isn't clear what power, if any, one nation has to
influence the behavior of the other if it isn't satisfied
with the results.</p>
