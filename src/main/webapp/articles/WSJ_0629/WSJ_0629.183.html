	<p class="article-leader">Stone Container Corp., Chicago, said it opened an expanded
operation costing $24 million at the paper and packaging
company's paper mill in Uncasville, Conn.
   It said the operation will recycle 144,000 tons annually
of used corrugated boxes to be collected from the New York
City and other metropolitan areas in five Northeastern
states.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>In the expansion, part of a $200 million program to
increase Stone's recycling capacity, the plant will make
recycled paper for new boxes. Stone said 16 of its 24 mills
world-wide purchase and recycle about two million tons of
used corrugated boxes and newspapers annually, and an
official said that "by 1992, we'll be consuming three million
tons" a year.</p>
