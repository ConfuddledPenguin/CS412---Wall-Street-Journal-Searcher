	<p class="article-leader">In a highly unusual debt offering, Japan's giant Sumitomo
Bank Ltd. said it plans to issue $1 billion of subordinated
debt in the U.S. and Europe.
   Through underwriters led by Goldman Sachs & Co., which is
12.5%-owned by Sumitomo, the Japanese banking concern will
issue $500 million in so-called Yankee bonds, which are
dollar-denominated bonds issued by foreign companies.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"This is the first time anybody has ever brought a
Japanese bank to the subordinated debt market," said Jon
Winkelried, vice president in charge of new issues at Goldman
Sachs.</p>
<p>At the same time, Sumitomo will offer $500 million of
floating-rate notes in European markets. Sumitomo Finance
International is expected to be the lead manager for the
European issue.</p>
<p>Sumitomo Bank will be permitted to use the $1 billion to
boost its capital base. Under capital standards agreed to by
the Bank for International Settlements, which is owned by the
central banks of 11 major industrial nations, banks involved
in international business must achieve a capital-to-assets
ratio of 8% by 1993.</p>
<p>Bankers said there is concern in the market that U.S.
banks, which could also need to boost their capital bases
with subordinated debt, might be crowded out by the appetites
of Japan's huge institutions.</p>
