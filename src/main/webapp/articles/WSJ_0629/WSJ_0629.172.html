	<p class="article-leader">Broken Hill Proprietary Co., Australia's biggest company,
said it has sold a 30% stake in Woodside Petroleum Ltd. to
Barclays de Zoete Wedd Australia Ltd. for 2.62 Australian
dollars ($2.06) a share, or a total of A$525 million ($413.6
million).
   BHP said in January it was considering selling its stake
in Woodside, an Australian concern that is one of six equal
partners in a huge liquefied natural gas project offshore
Western Australia state.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>BHP said Barclays de Zoete Wedd, 51%-owned by Barclays
Bank Australia Ltd., will sell the Woodside shares to
institutional investors in Australia and overseas. BHP will
retain a 10% stake in Woodside.</p>
<p>The North-West Shelf liquefied natural gas project started
shipping gas to Japan in July. Peak LNG production of up to
six million metric tons a year is scheduled to be reached in
1993. A metric ton equals 2,204.6 pounds.</p>
<p>Shell Australia Ltd., a unit of Royal Dutch/Shell Group,
holds 34.3% of Woodside directly and 5.8% indirectly. In a
separate statement, Shell Australia said it "has no intention
of increasing or reducing" its shareholding in Woodside.</p>
