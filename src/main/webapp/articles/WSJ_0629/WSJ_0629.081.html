	<p class="article-leader">In response to Richard Grenier's June 1 editorial-page
article, "Modern Artists Forget Their History": That Mr.
Grenier was able to list artists whose work was both
extraordinary and lasting and was produced under difficult or
repressive circumstances is irrelevant to the more central
question of artistic freedom in our country.
   Our Constitution was written to afford the greatest amount
of protection to a variety of freedoms, artistic liberty
being only one of them. This is not only a gift, but a
birthright for all Americans. To imply that a man can survive
or create with less than an ideal level of nourishment or
freedom is to state the obvious. If because of those freedoms
we must occasionally endure the boring, the mediocre or even
the offensive is a small price to pay. We do not scrap our
criminal code or the underlying concept of innocent until
proved guilty just because the rare criminal escapes
incarceration due to a technical violation of his civil
rights.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>That which belongs to all of us also belongs to each of
us; making exceptions or restrictions of those freedoms can
only lead to a general erosion and abandonment of all that
separates our lives from those lived under the many
totalitarian or military regimes still flourishing
world-wide. One need only turn to the recently repressed
intellectuals/artists of Eastern Europe to become
reacquainted with the importance of "total freedom." Mr.
Grenier, where have you been, or where can you go? If only
one were able to travel backward in time, how exciting a life
you might be leading, living in those past ages of "great
stylistic upheaval." It was in those times that
less-than-democratic ideals and individual liberties were the
cheesecloths through which all that upheaval filtered.</p>

<p>Mr. Grenier's quick summary of six centuries of artistic
accomplishment in the face of all the political and social
restraints that prevailed through those times seems to say
that those artists happily accepted restraints and our
contemporary artists ought to also. What Mr. Grenier ignores
is that we live in the "modern" age that -- if we still
believe in the ideals of the American Revolution -- no longer
abides that imposition of absolute and arbitrary power. Why
should artists be expected to be more complacent than the
rest of us about what we now regard as the right, rather than
the privilege, of free expression? Times change, and it is
beyond doubt that Michelangelo today would rail at any limits
as to what others deemed "acceptable" in his art.</p>
<p>As far as Mr. Grenier's accusations of art today being
"empty" and "shabby," he, as a historian, ought to know much
better than most that art is a reflection of its time. If
contemporary work would not impress Pope Julius II or Lorenzo
de Medici it might be because we no longer are able to see
visions of the sublime, as they did, while suited in full
battle dress, atop a war stallion, detached from the
subservient and brutally maimed human debris all around them.
Perhaps they might have identified more with the "heroic" art
of recent Nazi and Soviet regimes since the art bred of
democracy is so obsessed with the ordinary and mundane
individuality of those who simply would have been strategic
fodder to such grand princes.</p>
