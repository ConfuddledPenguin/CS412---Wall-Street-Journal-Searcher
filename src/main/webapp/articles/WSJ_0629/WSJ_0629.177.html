	<p class="article-leader">Telecredit Inc., which agreed last week to be acquired by
Equifax Inc., posted an 11% rise in fiscal fourth-quarter net
income to $6.6 million, or 59 cents a share, on a small
revenue increase.
   In the same quarter a year ago, Telecredit posted net of
$6 million, or 54 cents a share. Revenue in the quarter ended
April 30 inched up to $38.4 million from $38.2 million.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Telecredit, based in Los Angeles, guarantees personal
checks for retailers and other merchants and processes credit
cards for credit unions and small and medium-sized financial
institutions.</p>
<p>Lee A. Ault III, chairman, said the company is "looking
forward to revenue and net earnings gains in the second half
of fiscal 1991 following a relatively flat first half" due to
the loss of a major credit-union customer in October.</p>
<p>Atlanta-based Equifax, a major provider of credit reports
and similar information for retailers, banks and insurers,
has agreed in principle to acquire Telecredit in a stock swap
valued at about $580 million. Telecredit said it expects a
definitive agreement to be completed by July 10.</p>
