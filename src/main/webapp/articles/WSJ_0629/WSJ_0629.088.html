	<p class="article-leader">LONDON -- An expected global agreement today to phase out
many ozone-destroying chemicals will force an industry
shakeout that may ultimately benefit the world's chemical
giants.
   The pact seeks to preserve the natural layer of ozone gas
in the stratosphere that shields the planet from the sun's
harmful ultraviolet rays. A group of widely used chemicals,
chlorofluorocarbons, or CFCs, halons and carbon
tetrachloride, have already destroyed 3% of global ozone.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Today's agreement would commit industrialized nations to
banning the chemicals by the year 2000. Developing countries,
with only 15% of world use, have an extra decade to comply.</p>
<p>But the accord is expected to cause turmoil in the
chemical business, industry officials say. In place of the $2
billion-a-year world market for CFCs and halons, a new market
for ozone-friendly substitute chemicals will emerge. And that
market will favor the chemical giants because they have the
big laboratories and bulging treasuries needed to develop the
substitutes. Global development costs may exceed $4 billion.</p>
<p>"There's going to be a radical shakeout in the market,"
predicts Bridget Paterson, a product manager at Britain's
Imperial Chemical Industries PLC. "There won't be 32
suppliers anymore in the world; it will be six to 10."</p>
<p>The most likely survivors in the ozone-friendly market are
the leaders today in CFC production: Du Pont Co., Wilmington,
Del., Hoechst AG of West Germany, ICI, Atochem S.A. of
France, Allied-Signal Inc., Morristown, N.J., and Japan's
Showa Denko KK. Companies with much smaller operations in the
refrigerant market, such as Italy's Montedison S.p.A. and
France's Rhone-Poulenc S.A., may have difficulty keeping up.</p>
<p>Already, the chemical companies are jockeying for position
in the new markets. At this week's world ozone conference,
for instance, several European CFC makers were pushing for
language in the accord allowing them to merge their European
operations, something discouraged under an earlier
international CFC pact.</p>
<p>Without such mergers, said Joachim Von Schweinichen of
Montedison's Montefluos division, the European industry would
remain fragmented and unable to compete with bigger U.S.
rivals. Not surprisingly, U.S. manufacturers were lobbying
against the change. The issue wasn't expected to be resolved
until today.</p>
<p>Public relations is another important tool in the battle.
For instance, ICI and Du Pont are vying to be first to begin
commercial production of an important ozone-friendly
substitute, called hydrofluorocarbon 134a or HFC 134a.
Officials of both companies boasted they would win the race
late this year or early next year.</p>
<p>The allure for the companies is the potential of bigger
profits, although nobody knows whether the ozone-friendly
products will have fatter or slimmer profit margins than
CFCs.</p>
<p>By chemical industry standards, making CFCs is a simple,
low-tech business with relatively modest profit margins of
10% to 12%. But as the year 2000 deadline for phasing out
CFCs approaches, CFC prices may soar. By 2000, "it could be
like gold," says ICI's Ms. Paterson. But she says industry
costs may also be goldplated, as CFC factories run below
planned capacity. Currently, outside the U.S., where a
federal tax on CFCs boosts prices and restrains industry
profits, the most common CFC chemicals sell for #1,000
($1743) to #1,500 a metric ton.</p>
<p>Profits on ozone-friendly substitutes are even more
unpredictable, industry executives say. F.A. Tony Vogelsberg
Jr., environmental manager at Du Pont's Freon products
division, says CFC substitutes could be more profitable,
although prices will be high. And costs also will be steep,
he adds, because most of the substitute chemicals require far
more complex production techniques.</p>
<p>Thus, unlike the CFC business where one company's
technology has been much like another's, technology will
determine how big each company's profits are, and which
companies will survive.</p>
