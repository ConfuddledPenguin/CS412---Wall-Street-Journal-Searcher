	<p class="article-leader">East Germany said that it will allow a free flow of goods
from nations in the European Community beginning July 1.
   The Economics Ministry in East Berlin said the country
also will adopt EC trading and customs rules following this
Sunday's economic and monetary union with West Germany.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>There had been some question whether East Germany would
apply special restrictive measures such as high tariffs
against goods from abroad to protect its fragile economy.</p>
<p>But that apparently won't be the case, now that the East
German cabinet has decided the country's tariff structure
should be aligned to that of the EC as a whole.</p>
<p>The ministry said that East Germany will honor all
existing trade agreements with East Bloc countries and that
trade with them will remain free of tariffs until the end of
1990.</p>
<p>East and West Germany are expected to merge fully into one
country by the end of this year or in 1991. The ministry
didn't mention how it would treat the import of goods from
other non-EC countries.</p>
