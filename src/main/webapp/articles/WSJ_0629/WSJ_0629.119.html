	<p class="article-leader">Lefties Are More Likely
   To Have Older Mothers</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>LEFT-HANDED BABIES are more likely to be born to older
women than to younger women, a University of British Columbia
survey finds.</p>
<p>Health officials at the university in Vancouver determined
the handedness of 2,228 freshmen as part of a medical and
demographic questionnaire. They also figured out how old the
students' mothers were when they gave birth. A subsequent
analysis found that women over 40 years old were more than
twice as likely to bear a left-handed child as women under
25. Women aged 30 to 34 had a 25% higher chance of having a
left-handed child than those under 25.</p>
<p>Earlier studies had found that left-handedness is linked
to such birth-related stresses as prolonged labor, low birth
weight, prematurity, blood incompatibilities, multiple births
and "breech births."</p>
<p>These problems occur more often in births by older women
than by younger women. Thus, the link of left-handiness with
the age of the mother is "consistent with the supposition
that older mothers have more stressful deliveries and
gestational periods" than younger women, University of
British Columbia psychologist Stanley Coren reports in a
letter to the Lancet, a British medical journal.</p>
<p>Batteries So Skinny</p>
<p>They Come in Sheets</p>
<p>PAPER-THIN rechargeable lithium batteries are the hope of
the Hopes.</p>
<p>Henry F. Hope and his son, Stephen, who control Hope
Technologies Inc. in Willow Grove, Pa., say they've perfected
a high-energy rechargeable battery that can be made in sheets
only 0.015 inch thick. More important, they claim their
battery can store 220 watts of power per kilogram of weight,
at least four times the power density of conventional
lead-acid auto batteries. The latter claim would mean that a
stack of the battery sheets would run four times as long on a
single charge as a conventional lead-acid battery of the same
weight.</p>
<p>The Hopes's main business is making machinery for
automated processing of photographic and Xray films. A few
years ago, they were trying to invent a new photographic film
by coating a layer of dye-filled microspheres with a thin
layer of lithium. They suddenly realized that the lithium
could serve as the positive terminal of a battery.</p>
<p>After a thousand experiments, they say, they developed a
battery in which a still-secret ion-conducting polymer
electrolyte is sandwiched between a film of lithium for the
anode and a film of vanadium oxide for the cathode.</p>
<p>The two inventors, using their experience in building
film-processing machinery, plan to make and sell sheets of
their battery to manufacturers who would cut or stack the
sheets into the shapes needed for any of a variety of uses.
Possibilities, the Hopes say, include a skin-thin implantable
battery for heart pacemakers, slim battery packs for
soldiers, light-weight batteries for laptop computers and an
auto battery that would be part of the car's body.</p>
<p>Badly Polluted Lakes</p>
<p>Can Revive on Their Own</p>
<p>THE LEECHES and crayfish in Whitepine Lake near Sudbury,
Ontario, are raising hopes that once-polluted lakes won't
have to undergo expensive treatment before marine life
returns to normal.</p>
<p>The 165-acre lake lies 55 miles north of a huge smelter
that used to pour 2.2 million tons of sulfur dioxide into the
air each year. The resulting high acidity of Whitepine Lake
caused trout, burbot, white suckers and other acid-sensitive
life almost to disappear, while acid-tolerant yellow perch
thrived.</p>
<p>In the past dozen years, however, the smelter's emissions
have been cut sharply to 718,000 tons of sulfur dioxide in
1988.</p>
<p>Biologists with the Ontario government now report that
acidity of the lake has dropped sharply, and that much of its
life is rapidly recovering. Young lake trout were first
spotted in 1982. By 1987, trout born naturally in the lake
outnumbered marked hatchery fish that had been dumped in. The
perch, which are prey to the trout, are declining. The number
of leeches, crayfish and bottom-dwelling Iowa darter fish are
rising steadily as the water acidity drops, the Ontario
biologists report in a recent issue of the British journal
Nature.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the burbot and white-sucker populations
were too decimated to recover. Nevertheless, the scientists
report, it appears that acidified lakes can recover simply as
a result of a reduction in industrial emissions of pollutants
and without any additional treatment.</p>

long-term exposure to indoor radon gas. It's part of a study
to see if there's a link between radon and lung cancer in
