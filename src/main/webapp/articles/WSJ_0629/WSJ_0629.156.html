	<p class="article-leader">An Agriculture Department report indicated that the
rain-delayed planting season might have forced U.S. soybean
farmers to plant the smallest number of acres since 1976.
   Some analysts expect soybean prices to climb today in the
wake of the department's surprising decision to reduce its
estimate of how much land was planted with soybeans this
season by about 1.4 million acres to 58 million acres.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Most crop analysts had expected the government to raise
its three-month-old estimate. They reasoned that the
unusually wet spring delayed the planting of corn for so long
that by early June many farmers had switched to planting
soybeans. Although soybeans are less profitable to grow, that
crop can be planted later in the spring than corn.</p>
<p>What private analysts apparently didn't gauge was that the
rain is even slowing the planting of soybeans. Another factor
might be that soybean farmers backed away from earlier
intentions because of relatively weak prices through the
spring.</p>
<p>It is difficult to guess how much the soybean harvest will
drop this year because of small acreage. Some analysts are
reasoning that the soybeans that have been planted might do
well this year because the rains are replenishing soil
exhausted by the 1988 drought. Others, however, are concerned
that hot weather in the Southwest might be edging closer to
the Midwest growing region.</p>
<p>Concern about the weather might ease today in the wake of
a National Weather Service forecast late yesterday for normal
precipitation and temperatures in July in the Midwest.</p>
<p>The department didn't cut its estimate of corn planting as
much as expected by grain traders. After the close of trading
yesterday, the department reduced its estimate to 74.6
million acres from the 74.8 million acres it predicted in
March.</p>
<p>Based on the late planting season, most analysts had
expected the department to lower its estimate by about
900,000 acres.</p>
<p>The corn acreage forecast might ease pressure on corn
prices, which rose sharply yesterday before the report was
released, in part because corn stockpiles are shrinking
rapidly.</p>
<p>In trading at the Chicago Board of Trade, the July corn
contract set a new contract high before easing slightly to
settle at $2.9525 a bushel, up 8.25 cents.</p>
<p>Soybean prices settled mixed, while wheat prices settled
lower.</p>
<p>According to traders, corn prices jumped because there is
a tight supply of corn in the Chicago and Toledo, Ohio,
storage facilities that traders can use to fulfill
obligations to deliver grain against contracts they've sold
at the CBOT.</p>
<p>Corn stockpiles are tight across the country. The U.S.
also reported that the supply of corn June 1 was 2.84 billion
bushels, down about 17% from a year ago.</p>
<p>Somewhat surprising was the department's estimate of wheat
stockpiles: 535 million bushels. That was down 24% from June
1, 1989, but as recently as two weeks ago, department
analysts had estimated 452 million bushels. They were at a
loss yesterday to explain the increase.</p>
<p>Even at 535 million bushels, wheat carry-over stocks are
still at their lowest level since 1975. After two years of
drought in wheat-producing areas, the department is counting
on a bumper harvest this year, currently projected at 2.7
billion bushels, to rebuild stockpiles to at least 800
million bushels by June 1, 1991.</p>
<p>The government estimated soybean stockpiles at 596 million
bushels, up 28% from June 1, 1989.</p>
<p>The department said there has been substantial shrinkage
in the amount of land planted this year with feed grains.
Grain sorghum was estimated at 9.4 million acres, down 15%
from 1989; barley at 8.3 million acres, down 10%, and oats at
10.4 million acres, down 14%.</p>
<p>In other commodity markets yesterday:</p>
<p>ENERGY: Even as traders continued voicing gloom and
despair over the apparent glut of crude oil, petroleum
futures prices rose on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Most
market players pointed to technical factors to explain the
47-cents-a-barrel rise in the August contract, which closed
at $17.15 a barrel. Similarly, analysts said gasoline futures
prices benefited from the buying that resulted once prices
fell below 60 cents a gallon. Gasoline for July delivery
gained 1.44 cents a gallon to end the session at 60.93 cents.
Confusion spread to refiners, who a day after cutting posted
prices for West Texas Intermediate crude started raising them
again.</p>
<p>COPPER: Prices rose sharply, with the July contract
closing at $1.1430 a pound, up 4.30 cents. Gains for
September copper were even stronger; the contract settled at
$1.1330 a pound, up 5.30 cents. Michael Frawley, a metals
trader at PaineWebber Inc., said support for copper prices
was coming in part from purchases by Far Eastern trade
houses. Analysts said September's gains probably were
stronger than those for July because today is the first
notice day for the July contract. Many speculators feel
uncomfortable holding positions during the notice period,
when they could get a notice to actually receive copper.
Bernard Savaiko, senior commodities analyst at PaineWebber,
said that once July copper exceeded $1.1250, a level the
market had failed to penetrate on other recent occasions, it
gained technical strength. He said the next resistance level
for July is between $1.1520 and $1.1540. If the contract
moves above that, Mr. Savaiko said, its high of $1.1925 might
be topped.</p>
<p>ORANGE JUICE: Prices closed sharply higher, but analysts
attributed most of the gains to technical factors. The
September contract closed at $1.7060, up its daily limit of
five cents a pound. The July contract, which has a 10-cent
daily limit on its price moves, settled at $1.8790 a pound,
up 5.70 cents. William Adams, orange juice analyst for
PaineWebber in Orlando, Fla., said one of the forces driving
the market was short-sellers "buying the spread" between the
July and September contracts. To buy the spread,
short-sellers buy the July contract to cover their short
positions and reestablish them by selling the September
contract. The spread traded above 17 cents a pound, an
unusually large gap for a commodity in which there is no
physical shortage. Many traders also want to get out of the
July contract because Monday is the first notice day for July
juice, when holders of long positions can be given an
intention to deliver the physical commodity by holders of
short positions. Many traders don't like to hold positions
during the delivery period. Celeste Georgakis, orange juice
specialist at Cargill Investors Services Inc. in New York,
said there is still an unusually large open interest in the
July contract, considering that it is going into the delivery
period. She said some traders who bought July juice when the
price dropped below $1.70 recently are holding their long
positions and are prepared to take delivery of juice.
"Because they bought so cheaply, they can afford to spend a
little bit on upgrading delivered juice, if necessary," she
said. She points out that such juice would still be below the
cash juice price.</p>
