	<p class="article-leader">LITTLE ROCK, Ark. -- Worthen Banking Corp. said the
Arkansas state banking commissioner filed a motion in federal
court seeking to block the Resolution Trust Corp. from
selling a thrift to Worthen, arguing that the move would
violate state bank branching law.
   The move by Commissioner Bill Ford is the latest round in
a battle being waged between several state banking
commissions and the RTC, which argues that it has the power
to override state laws to facilitate the sale of failed
thrifts to banks. A federal judge in Santa Fe, N.M., ruled in
the RTC's favor in a similar dispute earlier this month, and
a federal judge in Colorado has also been asked to rule on
the policy's legality.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Worthen said the Arkansas controversy arose after the RTC
agreed to sell the holding company's Little Rock bank certain
assets and liabilities of Independence Federal Bank FSB,
Batesville, Ark. Under Arkansas law, banks are prohibited
from acquiring and operating branches located outside the
bank's home county.</p>
<p>Neither the RTC nor the Arkansas banking commission could
immediately be reached for comment.</p>
