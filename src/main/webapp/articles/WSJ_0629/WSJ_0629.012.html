L.P., a company it created with institutional investors, has
completed the purchase of Temple-Inland Inc.'s Great American
Reserve Insurance Co. for $143.5 million.
   Conseco, an insurance holding company, said GE Capital, a
unit of General Electric Co., provided $98 million in debt
financing for the purchase. GE Capital also is a limited
partner in Conseco Partners, which provided $7.5 million for
the transaction.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Temple-Inland, a Diboll, Texas, forest products and
financial services concern, said the sale allows it to
concentrate its financial services business on mortgage-loan
servicing operations and Texas thrifts. Temple-Inland said it
won't record a significant gain on the sale, contrary to
earlier expectations.</p>
