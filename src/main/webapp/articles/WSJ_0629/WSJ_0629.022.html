	<p class="article-leader">LANGHORNE, Pa. -- Ecogen Inc. said it signed a letter of
intent with New York investor David Blech for Mr. Blech to
increase his stake in the company from about 9% to about 36%.
Under the proposed agreement, Mr. Blech will buy 3.25 million
newly issued shares for $2 a share, or $6.5 million.
   Because Mr. Blech is injecting new capital, the
biotechnology firm said it is no longer seeking a buyer for
the company. In February, Ecogen retained Piper, Jaffray &
Hopwood Inc. to assist it in reviewing its options, including
the sale of all or part of the company.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Under terms of the proposed purchase, Mr. Blech will also
receive a seven-year warrant to purchase as much as four
million additional shares at $3 a share. In addition, he will
have the right to name a majority of nominees to Ecogen's
board.</p>
<p>The company currently has about 7.5 million shares
outstanding.</p>
<p>Under a March agreement with Mr. Blech, the company can
require him to buy 666,666 shares at $2.25 a share. As part
of that pact, Mr. Blech also received a warrant to purchase
500,000 shares at $4.50 a share as part of that pact. Ecogen
said that both the company's put option and Mr. Blech's
warrant will expire upon the closing of the current
transaction, which is expected to occur in July.</p>
