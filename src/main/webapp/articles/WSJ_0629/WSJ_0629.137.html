	<p class="article-leader">PONTIAC, Mich. -- General Motors Corp's. Pontiac division
is widening a recall of the troubled Fiero to include all
these sporty cars that GM ever built.
   The recall, which initially covered 244,000 Fieros
equipped with four-cylinder engines, now includes all the
six-cylinder models, boosting to 308,000 the total units
affected.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The recall is the second for the troubled subcompacts,
which GM stopped building in 1988. In 1987, GM recalled all
1984-model Fieros with four-cylinder engines, because of
defects that have caused engine fires and injuries.</p>
<p>As part of the latest action, Pontiac said it is offering
a special $750 cash rebate to Fiero owners who purchase
another new Pontiac model by year end.</p>
<p>GM wouldn't disclose how much the rebate will cost.</p>
<p>The Pontiac spokesman said the division hasn't considered
extending the special $750 rebate past year end or making it
an outright grant. "We're acknowledging the car has been a
problem, but we still want to keep (owners) in the Pontiac
family," he said.</p>
<p>GM will begin notifying owners of the recall next week.
But because of the complexity of the repairs and the number
of cars involved, GM is stretching out the notification
period until October. Any owner of a Fiero with problems such
as a smoking engine or engine-related vibrations should take
the car to a dealer now, the Pontiac spokesman said.</p>
<p>GM wouldn't disclose how much the recall will cost.</p>
<p>In January, the National Highway Traffic Safety
Administration said GM agreed to a second recall because
incidents of Fiero engine fires were continuing, despite
earlier repairs. It wasn't known then that Fieros with
six-cylinder engines would be included in the recall, and GM
didn't explain how it planned to fix the problem.</p>
<p>When GM began building the Fiero in 1983, the plastic-body
two-seater was hailed as a manufacturing and technological
breakthrough for GM, and sales were strong.</p>
<p>But engine fires caused by oil leaks ultimately became a
persistent problem for the cars, largely because of the
engine's design. In the first recall, GM adapted the engine,
but in January, the safety agency said this didn't
"completely" eliminate engine fires. GM said yesterday it has
been told of 1,451 fires related to these problems.</p>
<p>GM agreed to the second recall after negotiating for
months with agency officials. "This is one of the more
complex and extensive fixes, and one of the more extensive
problems, as well," said Michael Brownlee, director of the
federal highway safety agency's defect-investigation office.
The propensity of the Fiero engine to catch afire has been
under investigation by the agency for more than three years.</p>
<p>GM will make its latest attempt to fix the cars by
installing several new parts, including a new manifold on
older models, and a sheet-metal shield over the manifold on
all models. Dealers also will check Fiero engines, including
the cooling system. Any parts damaged by problems related to
engine fires will be replaced for free, GM said.</p>
