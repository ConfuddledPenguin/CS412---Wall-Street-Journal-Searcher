	<p class="article-leader">Pantera's Corp. said a U.S. bankruptcy court judge
approved a disclosure statement for a plan of reorganization
that would merge the company into its Pizza Inn Inc.
subsidiary and reconstitute it primarily as a franchise
service firm.
   Pantera's, a Dallas-based owner and franchiser of Pizza
Inn restaurants, would assume the name Pizza Inn Inc. under
the plan and sell most of its 100 company-owned restaurants
to existing or new franchisees. It would then concentrate on
improved marketing and operations support for franchise
restaurants, which currently number over 300, the company
said.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Pantera's said the plan would give current shareholders a
5% stake in the reorganized company, while giving unsecured
creditors a 62.5% stake. Management would receive 32.5% over
several years. Secured creditors would be repaid over a
period of five years, the company said.</p>
<p>Pantera's said the plan has the support of secured and
unsecured creditors and of franchisees, and will be put to a
vote by creditors and holders prior to July 18.</p>
<p>Jeff Rogers, president of Pizza Inn, said the company has
been experiencing "new record average unit sales" recently,
adding that "interest in international locations is
increasing dramatically."</p>
