	<p class="article-leader">TOKYO -- Japan's exports of cars, trucks and buses dropped
3.6% to 444,628 units in May from a year earlier, showing a
continuing decline because of the transfer of export-market
production to overseas plants.
   The Japan Automobile Manufacturers' Association said U.S.
exports have declined because of the production transfer as
well as lower U.S. demand.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Overall vehicle exports in May represent a 3.3% rise from
April, when exports posted an 18% year-to-year decline. An
association spokesman attributed these fluctuations to
shipping schedules.</p>
<p>However, the U.S. remained the largest buyer of Japanese
vehicles in May, despite a 17% contraction in shipments.
Exports totaled 156,122 units.</p>
<p>By vehicle types, passenger-car exports edged down to
337,551 units. Exports of medium-sized cars totaled 105,878
units, up 55%, while those of small cars dropped 14% to
231,673 units.</p>
<p>Overall shipments of trucks declined 13% to 104,152 units.
Those of medium-sized trucks fell 6.6% to 77,645 units, and
of small trucks, 28% to 26,507 units.</p>
<p>A total of 2,925 buses were exported in May, a 6.5% gain.
Shipments of large buses dropped 6.2% to 424, and shipments
of small buses rose 9% to 2,501.</p>
<p>The gap between exports to the U.S. and to Europe, Japan's
second largest outlet, has narrowed recently. In May,
shipments to Europe increased 12% to 144,199 units.</p>
<p>The European Community imported 109,143 Japanese vehicles,
up 14%, reflecting steady growth of shipments to West Germany
and the U.K.</p>
<p>Shipments to the Middle East increased 48% to 20,405
units, pushed up largely by those to Saudi Arabia, which
imported 10,321 units, up 52%.</p>
<p>According to the association's report, exports by the two
largest car makers in Japan declined from year-earlier
levels.</p>
<p>Toyota Motor Corp. exports fell 3.6% to 147,377 units,
while those of Nissan Motor Co. dropped 6% to 67,344 units.</p>
<p>Honda Motor Co. exported 49,584 units, down 2.7%.
Mitsubishi Motors Corp. shipped 35,788 units, down 9.9%.
Mazda Motor Corp. posted a 3.6% gain to 59,041 units, and
Isuzu Motors Ltd. rose 7.8% to 24,261 units.</p>
