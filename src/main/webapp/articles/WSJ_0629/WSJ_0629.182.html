	<p class="article-leader">BRUSH FIRES RAGED across Southern California, destroying
hundreds of homes.
   The wildfires, which authorities attributed to arson in
some cases, ravaged 500 homes and other buildings in Santa
Barbara County and at least 80 homes elsewhere. Hot winds
fanned the flames, which scorched 14,000 acres of brush in
four counties north, east and south of Los Angeles. As
thousands were evacuated, California Gov. Deukmejian declared
a state of emergency in Santa Barbara. He planned to make a
similar announcement in Glendale. Firefighters controlled
blazes in Utah and at Yellowstone National Park in Montana,
but fires spread unchecked in Arizona and Colorado.</p>

<p>A Senate panel voted to end funding for a program of
covert aid to non-communist forces in Cambodia, sources said.
The committee chairman declined to comment, but the sources
said the action reflected concern about the direction of U.S.
policy in Cambodia and a desire to invite more public debate
on the issue.</p>

<p>Lithuania's legislators debated a freeze of their
independence declaration, and some questioned whether Soviet
President Gorbachev has the staying power to stick to a
compromise for ending Moscow's economic blockade of the
republic. Premier Prunskiene backed a resolution imposing a
three-month moratorium on the declaration.</p>
<p>The Soviet Communist Party proposed reorganizing its
leadership and scrapping the Politburo and the once
all-powerful post of general secretary. The draft statutes
were published ahead of next week's crucial party congress in
Moscow, where hardliners are expected to clash with moderates
over Gorbachev's restructuring policies.</p>

<p>Jurors in Barry's trial watched a videotape that shows the
Washington mayor smoking crack cocaine the night of his
arrest in an FBI sting operation. In the videotape, Barry is
seen inhaling twice from a pipe, and a few moments later, FBI
agents burst into the room and arrest him.</p>

<p>House and Senate conferees removed a major hurdle to
passage of oil-spill legislation by rejecting provisions that
would have provided for U.S. participation in an
international treaty limiting shippers' liability. Rejection
of House language favoring the international protocols is a
big blow to the tanker industry.</p>

<p>A scientist said NASA could have found the crippling
defect in the $2.5 billion Hubble Space Telescope years ago
by performing a test costing a few hundred thousand dollars.
Robert Brown, former Hubble chief scientist, spoke as
telescope scientists pursued information that tests conducted
on Hubble were flawed.</p>

<p>The House approved an $83.6 billion appropriations bill
that would boost spending for domestic and science programs
by $12.3 billion in fiscal 1991 and restructure Bush's space
budget by cutting funds for exploration of Mars. The 355-48
roll call came after the chamber rejected efforts to trim
costs across the board.</p>

<p>Shamir told Bush in a letter his new government supported
Jewish settlement in occupied Arab lands and would never give
the PLO a role in peace talks, according to Israeli
officials. Secretary of State Baker said Washington needed
time to study the Israeli premier's letter, adding that it
wasn't a definitive rejection of U.S. proposals.</p>

<p>Cheering auto workers welcomed Mandela to Detroit after
Cuban-American politicians in Miami snubbed the South African
black nationalist leader because of his support for Castro.
In Florida, Mandela made an appeal for support from labor
unions.</p>

<p>A federal jury in New York began deliberating whether
former Philippine first lady Imelda Marcos looted her nation
of $222 million and secretly invested the money with the help
of Saudi financier Khashoggi.</p>

<p>Bush hinted that NATO leaders at next week's summit in
London will draw up proposals for a nonaggression declaration
with the Warsaw Pact. The president said he believed the
declaration would go some way to ease Moscow's worries about
a 16-nation alliance that included a united Germany.</p>

<p>The Senate revived an omnibus anti-crime bill and defeated
a conservative attempt to kill a three-year prohibition on
nine types of semiautomatic assault weapons. The Senate voted
50-48 in favor of keeping the curbs on the military-style
guns. The lawmakers also added tougher mandatory sentences
for firearms offenses to the bill.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>The Supreme Court blocked permanently the execution of a
convicted Arizona killer, a day after upholding the
death-penalty law under which he had been sentenced. The
confusing turn of events came about because two justices who
voted with the majority in the decision upholding the state
law didn't take part in the second action.</p>
