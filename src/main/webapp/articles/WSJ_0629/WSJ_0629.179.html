	<p class="article-leader">Security Pacific Bancorp. Northwest, Seattle, said it will
assume the core deposits and certain assets of Gibraltar
Savings Bank of Washington from the Resolution Trust Corp.
   The transaction gives the Security Pacific Corp. unit
about $228 million in Gibraltar's core deposits plus
Gibraltar's six branches in King County, Wash. For 15 months,
Gibraltar of Washington has been held in receivership by the
RTC, the federal agency that takes custody of ailing thrifts.
Full details of the consolidation haven't been determined.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The action follows Wednesday's parallel announcement by
the bank and thrift's larger affiliates. Security Pacific
National Bank of Los Angeles, a unit of Los Angeles-based
Security Pacific Corp., was the successful bidder for
Gibraltar Savings of Beverly Hills, a unit of Gibraltar
Financial Corp., assuming approximately $3.9 billion in core
deposits of the thrift and $2.7 billion of its residential
loans.</p>
