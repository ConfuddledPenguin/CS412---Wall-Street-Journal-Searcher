	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Citicorp said it will open offices in
Czechoslovakia and Poland in response to the countries'
movement toward market-based economies.
   The offices, which are expected to open next week in
Prague and Warsaw, will help corporate clients of its
Citibank unit identify local partners and finance Central
European joint ventures. The offices also will help
Czechoslovak and Polish companies participating in
government-sponsored privatization programs find foreign
partners.</p>
