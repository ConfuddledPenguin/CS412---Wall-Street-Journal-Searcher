a $74 million platform with processing facilities to produce
oil and natural gas discovered on two properties it holds in
the Gulf of Mexico.
   The Houston-based company said production from the
platform, to be located about 150 miles south of Lafayette,
La., is scheduled to begin in 1992, at a rate of 60 million
cubic feet of gas and 3,000 barrels of oil a day.</p>
