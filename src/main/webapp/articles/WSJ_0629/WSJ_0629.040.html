	<p class="article-leader">BEAVERTON, Ore. -- Nike Inc. forecast better-than-expected
fourth-quarter and year-end profits, sending its stock
soaring. The stock closed at $77.50, up $4.25 in national
over-the-counter trading yesterday, with about 1.3 million
shares changing hands.
   Nike credited a combination of favorable accounting and
tax changes for the boost in profits, which will exceed Wall
Street's expectations.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Philip Knight, chairman of the athletic shoe company, said
profit in the fourth quarter ended May 31 will be in the
range of $64 million to $66 million, or $1.70 to $1.75 a
share, exceeding analysts' estimates of $1.50 to $1.60 a
share. In last year's fiscal fourth quarter ended May 31,
1989, the company posted profit of $36.5 million, or 97 cents
a share.</p>
<p>For the year ended May 31, the company expects to report
profit of $240 million to $242 million, or $6.35 to $6.40 a
share, exceeding Wall Street estimates of about $6.15 to
$6.25 a share. In fiscal 1989, profit was $167 million, or
$4.45 a share.</p>
<p>The unexpectedly strong profits stem from a favorable
revision in the company's last-in, first-out inventory
reserves, and a lower-than-anticipated tax rate.</p>
<p>Nike said it plans to announce complete fourth quarter and
year-end results July 9 at an analysts' meeting in New York.</p>
