	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- American Telephone & Telegraph Co. said it
will cut prices an average of 2.2%, or more than $300 million
annually, on interstate and international long-distance
services, starting Sunday.
   The action comes only a month after AT&T, the nation's No.
1 long-distance carrier, said it would cut just its evening
rates an average of 2.5%, or $160 million annually. Under the
new plan, evening rates will drop 5%.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>But AT&T last week said it would increase the size of its
price cut, after the Federal Communications Commission
ordered local phone companies to reduce the fees they charge
AT&T and other long-distance phone companies for originating
and terminating interstate phone calls.</p>
<p>That FCC-ordered reduction amounts to $1.1 billion over
the next 12 months -- about $696 million more than the local
phone companies had proposed in April.</p>
<p>AT&T's reduction applies to basic long-distance service,
operator-handled calls, calls from the U.S. to Canada, and
the company's optional calling plan named Reach Out America.</p>
<p>For example, effective Sunday, price reductions on
direct-dialed, out-of-state calls will average 5% during
evening calling periods from Sundays through Fridays, and
one-half percent during the day on weekdays. The Reach Out
America evening discount plan will drop to $7.80 a month from
$8.15. And per-minute charges for operator-assisted calls
will be cut an average of 3%.</p>
<p>The decrease is AT&T's 11th since the comany's breakup in
1984. Since then, longdistance prices have been reduced
almost 43%, AT&T said.</p>
<p>AT&T's primary rivals, MCI Communications Corp. of
Washington, D.C., and the US Sprint Communications Co. unit
of United Telecommunications Inc., Kansas City, Mo., said
they will take whatever pricing action is necessary to stay
competitive with AT&T's rates.</p>
