	<p class="article-leader">TSB Group PLC, one of Britain's biggest banks, reported
pretax profit for the six months ended April 30 rose 6.7% to
#175 million ($305.2 million) from #164 million a year
earlier, as firm returns from retail banking and financial
services offset depressed returns in corporate banking.
   Per-share earnings fell 2.7% to 7.2 pence from 7.4 pence.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The fiscal first-half pretax results were weaker than most
market forecasts but a modest improvement from a year
earlier, when TSB's pretax profit slid 22%. TSB, which also
moved late last year to curb operating costs, doesn't
disclose results by unit or specify loan-loss provisions. But
it said pretax profit was held back by increased
mortgage-exposure provisions of its retail banking division
and advances by its corporate banking division to the
property, construction and retailing sectors.</p>
<p>Retail banking, the largest contributor to TSB profit,
rose to #117 million from #89.1 million, though TSB said the
year-earlier figure isn't directly comparable, citing the
continuing restructuring.</p>
