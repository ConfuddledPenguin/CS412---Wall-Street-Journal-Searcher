	<p class="article-leader">EAST BERLIN -- At 8 a.m. Sunday, 16 million East Germans
become guinea pigs in an extraordinarily bold economic and
social experiment.
   At that moment, they can cash in their tattered Ostmarks
for West German marks, the world's No. 2 reserve currency.
More to the point, a people who have lived under nearly 60
years of dictatorship and central planning -- first in Nazi
Germany and then in East Germany -- will be thrown off their
sinking ship of socialism into the ice-cold water of
capitalism.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The East Germans' great advantage over other East
Europeans is their generous life raft. As a rich and growing
capitalist country of 62 million people, West Germany will
overnight absorb a poor and decaying one with only one-fourth
its population and one-tenth its economic might.</p>
<p>Their biggest disadvantage is that the pace of German
reunification has deprived them of a chance to prepare for
the swim or take responsibility for their own futures, which
will be financed by West Germany and guided by armies of West
German advisers, businessmen and politicians.</p>
<p>"I don't see any problem in financing East Germany," says
Kurt Kasch, the board member responsible for East German
lending at West Germany's largest commercial bank, Deutsche
Bank. "West Germany is booming, and sufficient capital is
available. The problem will be how to restructure the
companies and the thinking of the people. There isn't yet a
plan, but only stop-gap measures. I don't doubt there may be
a disaster along the way. Their whole economy is like that of
a company under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code."</p>
<p>The Western bailout will increase the pressure here for
rapid unification as East Germans realize the impotence of
their own politicians to address inevitable problems of
unemployment, corporate bankruptcies and the threat of
another mass migration westward.</p>
<p>Before unification can occur, however, East Germans must
recreate their old federal states in local elections this
September; then the states, under the West German
constitution, must vote themselves into the new union. West
Germans hope that by November the Soviet Union will remove
the last international obstacle to unification. If all goes
according to Chancellor Helmut Kohl's plans, all-German
elections on Dec. 9 or 16 will be the final step before
formal political unification, which should be completed by
Christmas.</p>
<p>Yet it is this weekend that marks the point of no return.
The two Germanys may technically remain separate for a while,
but their economies and their fates will become joined.</p>
<p>"The importance of July 1 is that the people of East
Germany now know they belong to the West," says Walter
Momper, West Berlin's mayor. "They know that from that point
on, the West German government is legally and economically
responsible for them." The problem, he adds, is that "in a
few months, they have to make adjustments that took us 40
years. Anyone who says he knows what will happen is lying.
None of us know."</p>
<p>As D-mark day nears, the commander of the Bundesbank's
ground forces sits in symbolic discomfort, surrounded by
construction workers, in the expansive former offices of the
Communist Party's top ideologist. The Central Committee's
insignia have been stripped from the building's gray outer
walls, and its capitalist usurper has announced the
Bundesbank's arrival only on a handwritten sign on the door.
A decision-making center of communism has become the nerve
center of the transition to capitalism.</p>
<p>"You might read too much into the symbolism of our
location," says Johann Wilhelm Gaddum, the 47-year-old
Bundesbank official overseeing the distribution of 600 tons
of bank notes and 500 tons of coins from 15 central-bank
offices throughout the country. "There is a more practical
reason for us to be here." The Bundesbank's headquarters
here, once the main office of the Third Reich's central bank
as well, has the largest vaults available in Europe.</p>
<p>Fleets of vehicles, their routes and timetables
top-secret, have already delivered an initial installment of
25 billion West German marks, twice the amount of cash in
circulation in East Germany. Mr. Gaddum wants to be sure not
to run low on such a historic day. In coming months, when
East German companies start doing business in the new
currency, the Bundesbank will have to provide perhaps 130
billion more West German marks. West German economists expect
this action to swell their own money supply by 13.5% to 14%,
but they believe the enhanced growth from the addition of
East Germany's economy will allow them to absorb the deutsche
marks without significant inflation.</p>
<p>"This is the most exciting assignment I can imagine," Mr.
Gaddum says. "For the citizen of East Germany, the D-mark
isn't a currency; it is a symbol of freedom. He can travel to
Sweden; he can buy products he's only seen on television.
Great hopes and dreams are attached to July 1."</p>
<p>And great fears.</p>
<p>The irony of this Sunday's monetary and currency union is
that it is forcing together a people only now learning how
far they had grown apart since Germany was divided after
World War II. Even their languages had added vocabulary the
other Germans didn't understand. Poland, Hungary and
Czechoslovakia may suffer far worse economic difficulties,
but the psychological burden will be greater here. East
Germans must discard more than four decades of history and
adjust overnight to the laws, expectations and demands of a
new society that already regards them as second-class
citizens.</p>
<p>"Monetary union is the vise that is intended to hold us
together, but it isn't a very good tool for that purpose,"
says Baerbel Bohley, an abstract artist who was a leader of
the October "revolution" now leading to unification. "It will
only make our differences all the more apparent."</p>
<p>She points outside the window of her office in East
Berlin's City Hall, where dozens of orange garbage trucks
have gathered and hundreds of workers mill about in bright
orange overalls. It looks more like an Orange Julius
convention than a strike, but it reeks of trouble.</p>
<p>"Our luck is that we have a weapon that you can smell,"
says Guenther SvenOlaf, a 28-year-old union leader. Workers
complain that they earn half the wage of West Berlin garbage
collectors but handle twice the tonnage per person. They pass
out handbills with statistics showing that West Berlin
industrial companies pay eight times more to have their
garbage removed than East Berlins do. They say a pay raise is
necessary to avoid "garbage tourism" -- companies shipping
refuse East, to dispose of it more cheaply. "East Berlin
could become the garbage dump of Europe if we don't increase
our charges and wages," Mr. Sven-Olaf says.</p>
<p>Yet East Germans are caught in a Catch-22. Workers, egged
on by West German unions, are demanding higher wages to avoid
being second-class Germans. But just such demands are what
have kept West German and other investors at bay.</p>
<p>Many West German companies that at first wanted to invest
heavily in East Germany now are merely relying on unused
capacity in their existing plants to serve a new market no
larger than that of the federal state of North Rhine
Westphalia. They are reluctant to invest because of expected
wage increases, the lack of infrastructure such as
telecommunications and transportation, a weak network of
suppliers, and East German companies' debt, which isn't being
written off but is being translated into D-marks at a 2-to-1
rate. Their reluctance threatens to aggravate unemployment,
which could deepen the economic divide between East and West
Germany.</p>
<p>But if wages are too low and services too skimpy in the
East, the outflow of East Germans will increase. Even with
the West German mark coming East, 1,000 East Germans a week
continue to head West.</p>
<p>The game of guessing how this grand experiment will pan
out has become intense. After months of work, the German
Research Institute of West Berlin has produced a forecast of
short-term gloom, which will satisfy the doomsayers of the
left, and of medium-term optimism, which will feed the
boosterism of Chancellor Kohl's government. The institute's
economists anticipate greater problems than Bonn has
predicted for East Germany's current-account deficit (its
deficit in foreign trade in goods and services), its
unemployment and its plunging production.</p>
<p>"The East Germans have the hardest road in Eastern Europe
over the very short term, but in the long-run they will do
the best," says Heiner Flassbeck, who directed the
forecasting project.</p>
<p>The institute believes that East German unemployment will
hit 17% next year despite federal subsidies designed to
mitigate it. Another 13% of East Germans will be classified
as short-time workers, mostly working under subsidy programs.
So some 30% of East Germans won't be fully employed. Some
West German bankers are even gloomier.</p>
<p>The unemployment forecasts reflect an even more basic
economic imbalance. East Germans' desire to buy the Western
goods so long denied them will drive up imports by a
predicted 16.5% this year and 34.5% in 1991. But their
companies' inability to produce competitive goods may cause
exports to fall 15% this year and 10% in 1991, and production
to slip 9.5% this year and 19% in 1991.</p>
<p>The institute predicts an East German current-account
deficit this year of 37 billion marks and next year of 72
billion marks -- in an economy of only 270 billion marks. The
financing requirement would be nearly double that foreseen by
the West German government in its state treaty with East
Germany.</p>
<p>"No other East European economy could afford that price,
but here Bonn will pick up the tab," Mr. Flassbeck says.</p>
<p>The picture would be far gloomier if West Germany's
economic outlook weren't so bright. West Germany will outpace
its neighbors this year with real growth of some 4% -- partly
boosted by a doubling of exports to East Germany. The growth
in West German employment levels in the past year has been
the highest in three decades, and the inflation rate is
expected to remain under 3%. "Under the changed conditions,
growth over the next two years of nearly 10% in real terms
can be expected," the institute predicts.</p>
<p>But Bonn must revamp East Germany both radically and
quickly. For if this grand experiment fails, it not only will
set off mass westward migration but also feed already-rising
left-wing and right-wing radicalism in what is now East
Germany. Success or failure, in addition, could help or
hinder reformist politicians in the Soviet Union and
elsewhere in Eastern Europe.</p>
<p>The fear of the effects of mass unemployment has been so
strong that the West German government has set up an office
that will provide guaranteed loans through West German banks
to East German companies in the first three months. Some of
the companies may survive longer than they should, but the
idea is to give them money to retool quickly and pay their
workers before they make their first West German profits. The
loans are to be extended only a month at a time, and the onus
will be on the banks to identify firms whose loans are to be
renewed and firms that will be allowed to fail.</p>
<p>"No company in East Germany is ready to be competitive
with West German or West European companies," says Deutsche
Bank's Mr. Kasch, who has studied 40 East German concerns. A
close inspection of one glassmaker by Roland Berger G.m.b.H.,
a consulting firm owned by the bank, discovered that once
subsidies were removed, a multimillion-dollar book profit
turned into a multimillion-dollar loss. "The percentage of
companies that can become competitive anytime soon is less
than 20%," Mr. Kasch says.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the German Economic Research Institute
predicts stabilization late next year and a turnaround in
1992. It does see some problems lingering well into the 21st
century.</p>
<p>East Germany's stunned paralysis has increased in recent
weeks as West German companies and ministries move in like a
wave of capitalist missionaries selling the profit motive.
Burger King will open for business in Dresden on America's
Independence Day, July 4. Mail-order companies have already
set up kiosks on street corners. Even West German sex shops
are passing out their catalogs -- in plain brown wrappers --
to East Germans.</p>
<p>In a speech in West Berlin, Guenter Grass, the novelist,
complained that he found on a trip through East Germany that
the people were engaged in a "self-destructive" practice of
allowing their own products to be forced off the shelves. In
the brewery town of Altdoebern, he said, a Munich brewery had
provided the village pub with free beer coasters, menus and
decor on condition that the owner no longer sell East German
beer. The local brewery has already shut down.</p>
<p>In the Prenzlauer section of East Berlin, Kaufhalle, a
West German supermarket chain, has taken over a state-run
neighborhood store. This weekend, its workers will put out
brightly labeled containers on shelves that have been emptied
by shoppers fearing price increases and seeking to unload
East German marks. Yet even people who want the goods seem
overwhelmed by the range of choice.</p>
<p>"I've always known that salt packages are white and sugar
packages are blue," says Ms. Bohley, the artist and now a
member of East Berlin's city council. "Now, we have to read
the labels of many different packages we don't recognize.
This feeds a more general uncertainty."</p>
<p>That may be, but East Germans appear to be catching on
fast. All over the country, shops have hauled out onto the
sidewalks their East Bloc goods -- ranging from
Czechoslovakian beer to homemade furniture -- to sell at
price reductions of as much as 70%. A whole people appears to
be engaged in a clearance sale.</p>
<p>The familiar lines for goods have been replaced by
block-long queues of East Germans putting their money into
bank accounts and applying for the amounts they want to
withdraw next week. On Sunday morning, about 10,000 exchange
centers, including bank offices, schools and other government
buildings, will start passing out the money. Security will be
tight: East German police and army units have detailed at
least 30,000 men.</p>
<p>The Bundesbank will avoid chaos through some simple rules:</p>
<p>-- No cash exchanges will be made. All East Germans,
including children, must first deposit their money in a
personal bank account, where they automatically will be
rebooked as West German marks at midnight, June 30. That way,
the Bundesbank's computers can spot irregularities.</p>
<p>-- In the first week of July, no East German can withdraw
more than 2,000 West German marks. The purpose is to avoid a
buying mania.</p>
<p>Commercial banks moving quickly into the East German
market also see the week as an opportunity to market
investments unfamiliar to East Germans. An informal survey of
East Germans, however, shows that most wouldn't withdraw much
money anyway; they aren't sure just how much prices might
rise or whether they might soon be jobless. After July 9,
they can withdraw as much money as they please.</p>
<p>East Germans can deposit their old money in accounts until
next Friday. "Whoever has East German marks after that can
paper their walls with them," says the weekly magazine Der
Stern. So no one can exchange more than the limited amounts
allowed at a 1-to-1 rate, identity cards will be stamped with
indelible marking. East Germans under age 14 may exchange
2,000 East German marks at 1 to 1, those under 59 years of
age may exchange 4,000 East German marks at that rate, and
those older may exchange 6,000 East German marks. All other
money in accounts can be exchanged at 2 to 1 -- even West
Germans with East marks in accounts predating Dec. 31, 1989.
But to penalize speculation, money deposited by foreigners
after that will be exchanged at 3-to-1.</p>
<p>But all this hasn't stopped speculators. The most
sophisticated ones have acted as brokers between those who
didn't have any money to put in accounts and those who wanted
to spread their money around to exchange as much as possible
at 1 to 1. The commission initially charged for this service
was 10%, but by the end of this week it reached 50%.</p>
<p>The dingy corridors of East Germany's finance ministry
haven't seen so much nervous tension since Luftwaffe chief
Hermann Goering worked in the building during World War II.
State Secretary Martin Maassen has been working 18-hour days
trying to apply West German trading and tax laws to East
Germany. He is boundlessly optimistic that, despite
short-term problems, his people will get a better life. But
he concedes that his position after Sunday will be a novel
one.</p>
<p>"There's seldom been a finance ministry without its own
currency," he says. Yet Mr. Maassen is glad the
nerve-wracking buildup is ending. "All the planning and worry
is over," he says. "After Sunday, we all become crisis
managers."</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>       Key Issues in German Monetary Unification</p>
<p>-- Inflation. Despite fears of the kind of inflation that
ravaged Weimar Germany, inflation is expected to remain low.
Prices of many East German commodities, such as bread, will
rise sharply but then remain stable.</p>
<p>-- Unemployment. Some experts predict East German
unemployment will rise as high as 40%, at least temporarily.
Numerous East German companies are expected to fail.</p>
<p>-- Restructurings. Those East German companies that
survive will have to undertake dramatic restructurings and
modernization, financed initially by loans guaranteed by the
West German government.</p>
<p>-- Compensation. East German workers need to be paid
enough to keep them from migrating west, but not so much as
to discourage Western investment in East Germany.</p>
<p>-- Labor unrest. Wage inequities between workers in the
East and West and high rates of unemployment in the East
could cause labor turmoil.</p>
<p>-- Financing infrastructure. East Germany needs massive
investment in its infrastructure, ranging from
telecommunications facilities to highways and airports.</p>
