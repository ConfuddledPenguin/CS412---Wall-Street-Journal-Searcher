	<p class="article-leader">WATERTOWN, Mass. -- Ionics Inc., benefiting from growing
concern about water-quality issues, is comfortable with
analysts' estimates of second-quarter earnings and sales
gains, Arthur L. Goldstein, chairman and chief executive
officer, said.
   The company, while not making a specific forecast, doesn't
quarrel with estimates of about 26 cents a share in the
second quarter, a rise of 30% from the 1989 period's net
income of $839,000, or 20 cents a share, Mr. Goldstein said
in an interview.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Ionics, which makes purification systems, expects revenue
to grow "15% or a little better" from the year-earlier
period's $26 million, he said.</p>
<p>Most of Ionics' businesses are posting healthy revenue
gains, but its Aqua Cool bottled water business is showing
particularly sharp growth. With revenue expected to increase
25% to 30% in the second quarter and year, Aqua Cool now
provides nearly 10% of Ionic's revenue, Mr. Goldstein said.</p>
<p>Aqua Cool is purified drinking water sold mostly in
five-gallon containers for coolers in offices but also in
smaller containers in supermarkets. Originally introduced
overseas, Aqua Cool is expanding steadily in the eastern
U.S., with the newest markets being Stamford, Conn., New York
City and northern New Jersey.</p>
<p>Ionics believes it is among the 20 largest companies in
the fast-growing, highly fragmented bottled-water market and
expects to improve its position as it moves toward national
distribution. "Our goal is to become a major player in this
market. . . . We hope to be in the top 10 to 15 companies in
the next couple of years," Mr. Goldstein said.</p>
<p>The executive said it will be easier for Ionics to expand
geographically than for some of its competitors because
Ionics can "manufacture" Aqua Cool water anywhere with its
purification system. Thus, it won't have to transport bottled
spring water long distances or buy regional companies.</p>
<p>Ionics has introduced a cooler that can dispense seltzer
water by adding carbonation. While that business is only
starting to become profitable, "by the end of this year it
will become an important profit contributor," Mr. Goldstein
said.</p>
<p>Ionics also is experiencing strong growth with its
water-purification systems for companies in the
power-generating, electronics and pharmaceutical industries,
Mr. Goldstein said. This water is used in power-plant
boilers, in pharmaceutical fluids and to clean computer
chips, among other things. Demand is growing because use of
less pure water can lower operating efficiency and increase
maintenance costs, he said.</p>
<p>Ionics, which also makes desalination systems, said
contracts for major systems contributed to its second-quarter
earnings and sales gains. The company's backlog, which
consists mostly of large desalination and purification
systems, is about the same as the record backlog of $64.5
million at the end of the first quarter.</p>
<p>For the year, Mr. Goldstein said he isn't "uncomfortable"
with analysts' estimates of earnings of $1.10 to $1.15 a
share, or 30% to 35% higher than last year's $3.6 million, or
85 cents a share. Revenue is expected to rise at least 15%
from last year's $108.9 million, he said.</p>
