	<p class="article-leader">Manatron Inc., Kalamazoo, Mich., said it will report
operating earnings of $225,000 to $275,000, or 11 cents to 13
cents a share, before the positive impact of its pension-fund
adjustment, for the year ended April 30.
   With the pension-fund adjustment of approximately $250,000
to be recorded in the fourth quarter, Manatron will report
net income of $475,000 to $525,000, or 23 cents to 25 cents a
share, the company said. In its previous year, Manatron had
net of $101,713, or five cents a share.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>For the fourth quarter, Manatron expects to post operating
earnings of between $75,000 and $125,000, or between four
cents and six cents a share. In the year-earlier quarter,
Manatron had net of $39,119, or two cents a share.</p>
<p>Allen F. Peat, chairman, said the software and
computer-services company will report earnings in mid-July.
For the nine months ended Jan. 31, Manatron posted net of
$150,465, or seven cents a share, compared with $62,594, or
three cents a share, the year before.</p>
<p>In a recent interview, Mr. Peat said he expected year-end
revenue of $8.5 million to $8.7 million, compared with $7.7
million in fiscal 1989.</p>
<p>The higher revenue and earnings result from increased
software sales, Mr. Peat said. Manatron reaped higher
software sales from its movement to expand its personal
computer-based based software and through the service
contracts to maintain the computer systems.</p>
<p>"As we add new customers, the layer of service revenue
continues to grow," Mr. Peat said, noting that nine of 10 new
customers elect to purchase service contracts as well.</p>
<p>Manatron's complement of 30 major computer systems that it
markets to governments is mostly complete, Mr. Peat said, and
the company isn't planning to "expend a dramatic effort on
increasing that." he added. Instead, the company will
increase its product offerings on a selective basis, Mr. Peat
said.</p>
<p>Manatron has customers nationwide, but its core of
customers is in Michigan, Indiana, Illinois and Missouri. The
company's basic customer is a midsized county. Manatron's
computer systems automate functions such as bill collecting
and property deed record keeping.</p>
<p>Industrywide sales of software to local governments
reaches over $1 billion annually, and there is no
identifiable industry leader, Mr. Peat said. Manatron's
approach has been to develop software for a wide range of
government processing and record keeping functions.</p>
<p>Manatron hopes to boost sales and earnings 20% annually in
the future, Mr. Peat said.</p>
