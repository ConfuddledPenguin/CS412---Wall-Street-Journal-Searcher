	<p class="article-leader">In regard to L. Gordon Crovitz's May 23 Rule of Law
column, "Verdict: Frantic Antitrust Ideas Are Gone With the
Wind," Mr. Crovitz properly praised both the court's "style
and substance" in U.S. v. Syufy Enterprises. The
"unforgettable" parts of Syufy are, however, not the
incidental references to obscure movie titles but, instead,
the court's instructive and entertaining analysis of an
apparently unsound government prosecution. While expressly
reminding us that market power should not be uncritically
measured by market share, Syufy also illustrates that the
state of antitrust law enforcement should not be crudely
measured by the number of prosecutions brought by antitrust
enforcement units.
