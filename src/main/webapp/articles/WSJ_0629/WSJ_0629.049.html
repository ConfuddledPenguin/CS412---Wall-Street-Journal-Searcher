	<p class="article-leader">PARIS -- France's consumer price index in May rose 0.2%
from April and 3% from a year earlier, the National
Statistics Institute said, confirming preliminary results.
   The latest data put the index -- the year 1980 is equal to
100 -- at 182.8, up from 182.4 in April and 177.5 in May
1990. The May result represents a slowdown from April, when
price growth was 0.4% on a monthly basis and 3.2% on a
year-to-year basis.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Much of the May improvement was recorded in the service
sector, where monthly price growth eased to 0.2% from April's
0.8%. The April pace reflected the regular inclusion of
housing and rent costs on the index for the first month of
every calendar quarter.</p>
