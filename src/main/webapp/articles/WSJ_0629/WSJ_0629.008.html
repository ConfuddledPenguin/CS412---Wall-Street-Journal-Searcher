	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- To put it bluntly, Thomas G. Labrecque and
Arthur F. Ryan, Chase Manhattan Corp.'s newly designated
chairman and president, respectively, face a credibility
problem with investors.
   Together with retiring Chairman Willard C. Butcher, they
persuaded investors last October to buy 16 million newly
issued common shares of the nation's second largest banking
company. At the time, they painted a rosy earnings outlook.
The response was so enthusiastic that Chase was able to raise
$625 million rather than the $500 million originally planned.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>But problem real estate loans and a slack corporate
financing market have pulled the rug from under those
projections, and investors think management was caught
sleeping. The stock has plummeted from $40.125 for each newly
issued share to close yesterday at $23.75, down 12.5 cents in
New York Stock Exchange composite trading.</p>
<p>Mr. Labrecque, 51 years old, concedes that the level of
corporate finance activity is 30% below Chase's earlier
projections. "There were judgments that turned out not to be
right. I will accept that," he said in an interview.</p>
<p>Mr. Labrecque said Chase management was "probably not as
quick {responding to the drop in revenue} as we should have
been." But he said management had been working with the board
for several months on plans to streamline Chase's commercial
banking business.</p>
<p>For years, some Chase executives have privately questioned
whether Mr. Labrecque is up to the tough tasks that Chase
faces. He came to the limelight in 1980 when he was
catapulted out of Chase's treasury department over the heads
of two movers and shakers -- Barry Sullivan, who went on to
become chairman of First Chicago Corp., and William Ogden,
who in 1984 left to run Continental Bank Corp. -- into the
president-elect post.</p>
<p>But other Chase executives credit Mr. Labrecque for two
moves that today are paying off for Chase: the decision to
expand its consumer banking and another to decentralize and
beef up back-office technology. Last year, the consumer bank
contributed roughly half of Chase's core earnings, and
Chase's technical services for corporate and institutional
clients are rated among the industry's most advanced.</p>
<p>In that light, Mr. Ryan, a chain-smoking Brooklyn native,
is a logical choice to serve as Mr. Labrecque's No. 2. Mr.
Ryan, who in 1972 joined Chase from Control Data Corp.,
worked on the decentralization project and later took over
the consumer business. Chase today says its consumer business
is in a neck-and-neck race with Chemical Banking Corp. for
the No. 2 spot in the New York City market behind Citicorp.</p>
<p>The selection of Mr. Ryan was cheered by many Chase
insiders. Engaging and straight-talking, he serves to offset
what some say is Mr. Labrecque's aloofness.</p>
<p>To regain investors' faith, Messrs. Labrecque and Ryan
have embarked on Chase's second restructuring in recent
years, seeking to cut more than $300 million out of its
non-interest expenses, a reduction of about 8%, by the end of
the year. The cuts are expected to eliminate about 3,000 jobs
from Chase's 41,600-person work force.</p>
<p>Analysts expect that cut to result in a restructuring
charge of less than $100 million in either the second or
third quarter. However, much of that restructuring charge is
expected to be offset by the sale of Chase buildings in
Frankfurt, West Germany, and in London and Switzerland.</p>
<p>Mr. Ryan, 47 years old, said previous cost-cutting steps
were "a pure case of not enough." He said: "We have to be
more `real time' in responding to changes in the marketplace
so you don't have a restructuring every three years. What
happens in the market isn't something that I can control."</p>
<p>While they find the moves promising, analysts remain wary
about whether Chase has a grip on where things are headed.
Charles Peabody of Kidder, Peabody & Co. said, "The
investment community is taking a show-me attitude."</p>
