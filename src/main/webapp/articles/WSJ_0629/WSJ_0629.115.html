	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- House Ways and Means Chairman Dan
Rostenkowski introduced legislation that would create tax
incentives to spur business development in 25 economically
depressed areas.
   The proposal gives new life to the Bush administration's
proposal to create such "enterprise zones," and it represents
a reversal in Mr. Rostenkowski's longstanding opposition to
the idea. Ways and Means Committee staff said the Illinois
Democrat is likely to push the plan, which would cost $1.5
billion over five years, during the White House-congressional
budget negotiations.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Both Mr. Rostenkowski's bill and the White House proposal
would offer tax incentives to promote employment and
investment, but there are differences.</p>
<p>Mr. Rostenkowski would offer small businesses, those with
100 employees or less, that settle in the zones a tax credit
equal to 10% of both the wages paid to employees earning less
than $30,000 and the cost of providing health insurance.</p>
<p>The White House wants to give a 5% tax credit to
individual workers on their first $10,500 earned. The credit
would be phased at higher wage levels.</p>
<p>Mr. Rostenkowski's bill would provide for child care,
housing and health insurance in economically depressed zones.
The administration's bill has no such provisions.</p>
