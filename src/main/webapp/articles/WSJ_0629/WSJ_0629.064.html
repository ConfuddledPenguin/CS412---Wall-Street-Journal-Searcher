	<p class="article-leader">WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. -- The rawboned man riding in the
front seat is recalling emotions, emotions that transcended
the blues to approach despair. He is describing depression.
   Depression? "I didn't know the meaning of `depression,'"
muses Lawton Chiles. "I had `the blacks.' They got to be the
black blacks."</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>That depression caused Mr. Chiles to end his U.S. Senate
career in 1988 after three terms. It deepened in 1989. Then,
with medical help, it dissipated in December.</p>
<p>Now Lawton Chiles is back in politics, the front-running
candidate for Florida's Democratic gubernatorial nomination.
And talking enthusiastically -- not of pain, but of
possibilities.</p>
<p>"What if," he begins. "What if I could jump into the race
at the last moment, after all the smart money had already
been locked up? What if I could win without compromising with
the big-money people? Oh, it would be so exciting]"</p>
<p>Lawton Chiles did enter this race at the last moment -- in
April, long after his Democratic opponent, Rep. Bill Nelson,
had locked up the smart money. And he's certainly trying to
win without compromising. In a fantastically expensive state
to campaign in, he's stubbornly limiting individual
contributions to $100. He's running, he says, against the
whole corrupting, paralyzing influence of money in politics.</p>
<p>"Do I want to destroy the system?" he asked rhetorically
in a recent debate here. "I do, with every fiber and bone in
my body. . . . Help us make this an election, not an
auction."</p>
<p>Mr. Chiles's sudden re-emergence has done more than
threaten the hopes of Mr. Nelson, a clean-cut congressman who
has been annointed by the state's Democratic power brokers.
It also has injected a new element of uncertainty into one of
the nation's most important gubernatorial races.</p>
<p>Republican National Committee Chairman Lee Atwater has
called Florida, Texas and California "the three-megastate
anchor to our entire Sun Belt political base." All three
statehouses are held by Republicans now, and all are up for
grabs in November. All three states stand to gain
congressional seats as the result of the 1990 census and
their governors will be key to the congressional
redistricting process.</p>
<p>A recent Mason-Dixon Opinion Research Inc. poll found Mr.
Chiles leading Mr. Nelson 55% to 38%, despite a recently
concluded Nelson television blitz. Mr. Chiles also led
incumbent GOP Gov. Bob Martinez 53% to 38%. If Mr. Chiles
does triumph, it will be his way -- the hard way. His
campaign amounts to an anti-campaign, a throwback to a
simpler era.</p>
<p>Because of his self-imposed contribution limitations, he
has run only scattered advertisements on cable television. He
and his running mate, former Congressman Kenneth "Buddy"
MacKay, typically campaign in khakis and sport shirts. "Our
Bartles & Jaymes approach," Mr. MacKay calls it. More
startling, this campaign has no formal campaign manager. So
who's steering this thing?</p>
<p>"That's not clear every day," grins Mr. MacKay, who
narrowly lost the 1988 U.S. Senate race to succeed Mr.
Chiles. "But this is the way Lawton wants it, and I'm
committed to trying to make it work."</p>
<p>Mr. Chiles has always campaigned unconventionally. He won
his Senate seat in 1970 as "Walkin' Lawton," the low-budget
candidate who hiked from the Florida Panhandle to the Florida
Keys. Today, Mr. Chiles is banking on his statewide name
recognition, his reputation for integrity -- and his hunch
that voters are ready to rebel against big-money politics.</p>
<p>That assumption remains to be tested. Incumbent Gov.
Martinez is widely expected to spend $12 million to $15
million in his re-election campaign. Nomination opponent Bill
Nelson spent $l.7 million on his television blitz. The
normally bland Mr. Nelson also has gone on the attack.</p>
<p>He has criticized Mr. Chiles as insufficiently pro-choice
on the abortion issue, challenged him to release his
income-tax returns and, in a debate here, presented him with
a pair of shower thongs to symbolize his alleged
"flip-flops." Through it all, politely but pointedly, Mr.
Nelson has tried to make depression an issue.</p>
<p>". . . In your own words, you had said you were burned
out," he reminded Mr. Chiles in an earlier debate. "Your
colleagues said you were overwhelmed by the system. You said
you couldn't control your own schedule. The question is, why
do you think the governor's job wouldn't be overwhelming?"</p>
<p>Claude Kirk, a GOP ex-governor seeking his party's
nomination again, has suggested an answer. If Mr. Chiles was
depressed in Washington, Mr. Kirk said, after "he spends
about 13 minutes in the governor's chair, he may blow his
brains out."</p>
<p>The polls suggest that these attacks haven't worked. Mr.
Chiles's basic reply to such jibes is that the two jobs are
different: Governors, as hands-on executives, can get things
done in a way that U.S. senators can't. On a deeper level,
his response evokes one of the recurring themes of politics
-- the collision of hope with disillusionment.</p>
<p>As a senator, Mr. Chiles was an architect of the
congressional budget process. "I had such high hopes," he
says. Yet that system was unable to prevent Congress and
President Reagan from tripling the national debt. Late in his
Senate career, Mr. Chiles headed the Budget Committee
himself.</p>
<p>"I guess," he reflects as his car carries him toward a
campaign stop, "the worst thing that happened to me was
getting to be chairman."</p>
<p>His final, crushing disillusionment was a White House
budget summit -- not unlike yet another budget summit
unfolding today -- after the 1987 stock-market crash. "I
began to see that the president wasn't serious, the speaker
wasn't serious, the majority leader wasn't serious," he says.
"It was all a charade. I just wanted to scream, `This is a
fraud.' But I had helped create it]"</p>
<p>The episode undoubtedly contributed to the depression that
followed. Will his current unorthodox campaign lead to new
disillusionment?</p>
<p>Mr. Chiles is convinced the risk is worth taking. "If we
can get elected this way, literally we're free," he says. As
he put it in the debate here: "You can't kill the system by
joining it. You can't kill darkness with darkness."</p>
<p>Later that day, amid the gathering twilight of an outdoor
rally here, he told his audience: "When you tell us you
really think that we can turn things around, that just makes
us grow 10 feet tall."</p>
