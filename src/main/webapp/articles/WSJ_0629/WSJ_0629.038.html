	<p class="article-leader">EINDHOVEN, the Netherlands -- Jan Timmer shook up N.V.
Philips's sleepy consumer-electronics division so vigorously
in the late 1980s that Dutch newspapers dubbed him Hurricane
Gilbert. Now the company's future is riding on whether he can
live up to his nickname.
   After a decade of mediocre performance, Philips's
operating profit has almost disappeared in the past year as a
result of huge losses on computers and semiconductors. As Mr.
Timmer prepares to take over as chairman Monday, the
company's share price is languishing at about half its 1986
peak. And the bureaucracy at Europe's largest
consumer-electronics company is so bloated even some union
leaders urge job cuts.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"A major pillar of European industry and technology is
crumbling," says Marc E. Fourny, who heads the Brussels
office of consultants A.T. Kearney Inc.</p>
<p>Thus, the atmosphere is likely to be solemn Monday when
the burly, 57-year-old Mr. Timmer addresses shareholders to
ratify his appointment to succeed Cornelis van der Klugt, who
was forced to resign in May when his profit forecasts proved
too optimistic.</p>
<p>Philips isn't on the brink of going bust or falling victim
to a corporate raider. Multilayered takeover defenses protect
the company from a hostile bid, at least in the short term.
In addition, Philips still makes reasonable profit in a few
areas, such as light bulbs, electric shavers and compact
disks. By milking those products and selling more of its real
estate riches, Philips could probably limp along for years.</p>
<p>But the supervisory board, which effectively controls the
company, is running out of patience, as evidenced by Mr. van
der Klugt's humiliating departure. Morale among the company's
293,000 workers is sinking after 10 years of fruitless
reorganizations. Analysts warn that if the company's finances
continue to deteriorate, Philips will be forced to sell many
of its crown jewels and sacrifice its role as one of Europe's
leading research centers.</p>
<p>"Either the ship is turned around quickly," says Arjen Los
of County NatWest Securities in London, "or you'll see a much
smaller company in a few years."</p>
<p>In the consumer-electronics business, which accounts for
about 40% of Philips sales, Mr. Timmer proved adept at
hacking through bureaucratic traditions, moving managers
closer to their markets and making them accountable. Analysts
expect him to take the same approach with the rest of the
company.</p>
<p>Mr. Timmer, who declined to be interviewed for this story,
seems likely to act first and make announcements later,
avoiding Mr. van der Klugt's trap of promising too much. Last
week, apparently at his instigation, Philips announced a
retreat from developing minicomputer technology in the first
stage of what it promised would be an overhaul of the
computer business aimed at "drastically" reducing costs.</p>
<p>Even for a man of Mr. Timmer's reputation, regaining
credibility at Philips won't be easy. It was only three years
ago that his predecessor, Mr. van der Klugt, proclaimed that
Philips was changing its ways with a massive reorganization.</p>
<p>Mr. van der Klugt did make some progress in streamlining
Philips. The units producing large domestic appliances were
put into a joint venture controlled by Whirlpool Corp. of the
U.S. Philips sold much of its military-electronics business
as well as some of its more incongruous diversifications.
Employment shrank by 51,000 people, or nearly 15%, over three
years. Mr. van der Klugt made little progress, however, in
trying to force Philips bureaucrats to behave more like
entrepreneurs.</p>
<p>From its origins as a lamp-making plant opened by Gerard
Philips in Eindhoven 99 years ago, Philips gradually built a
world network of 60 national organizations making products as
diverse as medical scanners and steam irons. The national
organizations became so autonomous they tended to be
considered local companies.</p>
<p>In the 1960s, Philips was considered a model
multinational. By the 1970s, however, Japanese competitors
had found cheaper ways to compete, making and selling the
same brands in the same way all over the world. Philips
proved too hidebound to respond.</p>
<p>Mr. van der Klugt tried to give product managers the power
to chart global strategy, removing some traditional powers of
the national organizations. But current and former Philips
executives say the national organizations are resisting that
shift. The company remains so fragmented, one consultant
says, it sometimes lacks a clear idea of how much money it is
making or losing on a given product line.</p>
<p>Other critics accuse Philips of sheer stubbornness,
refusing to bow out of the computer business despite a weak
presence in the market, for example. And they say the
hugeness of the corporate bureaucracy slows decision-making.
"There were layers and layers of people," says a foreign
executive who recently left Philips. "Very few decisions were
made. It was just lots of wheel-spinning."</p>
<p>Philips has been far slower than other multinationals in
stripping itself down to core businesses in which it has a
shot at global leadership. The company still has 340
factories, the bulk of them in high-cost European countries,
producing a dizzying array of products including telephone
switchboards, television sets, electron microscopes, radar
systems, automated bank tellers -- "anything an electric
current can flow through," as one critic puts it.</p>
<p>Even the fiercest detractors acknowledge Philips has huge
technological strengths. The problem, they say, is that it
has too often let old achievements blind it to the realities
of a market where consumers' fickle tastes matter far more
than who invented which gadget.</p>
<p>With the compact disk, Philips managed to ensure that it
was backing a world standard. And Mr. Timmer has signaled
that Philips will continue to put more emphasis on marketing
realities. "There isn't much room in Europe for technological
wizardry where Thomson {S.A. of France} tries to prove to us
how clever they are and vice versa," he said at a press
conference in February.</p>
<p>Partly because he unambiguously states such verities, Mr.
Timmer is widely viewed as Philips's savior -- so much so
that some colleagues worry unrealistic expectations are being
raised. Some recall that as a member of the management
committee since 1987, he shares some responsibility for the
company's current troubles.</p>
<p>What seems clear is that Mr. Timmer is taking on one of
the toughest jobs in business. "I don't think one man --
whether it's the pope of Rome or Mr. Timmer -- will be able
to solve the problems of that company," says Joep Crolla, a
business journalist in Eindhoven.</p>
<p>Mr. Timmer has a reputation for eschewing small talk.
According to a joke making the rounds in Eindhoven, he knows
how to say just three things: "yes," "no" and "get out of
here." It seems a safe bet that more people at Philips will
be hearing the latter two messages.</p>
