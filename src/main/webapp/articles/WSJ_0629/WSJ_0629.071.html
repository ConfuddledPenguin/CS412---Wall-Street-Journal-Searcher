	<p class="article-leader">A group of insurers and two data-management companies
formed a venture to provide a computer network designed to
expedite the processing of policies and the flow of pricing
information to independent agents.
   The venture, known as Alliance for Productive Technology,
hopes to create a standardized software system to let
insurance agents transmit and retrieve information from
several companies without having to re-enter policyholder
data several times.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>But consumer groups and insurance-industry critics
expressed skepticism about the likely benefits of the planned
system. Moreover, the approach excludes the direct insurance
writers, companies such as State Farm Mutual Automobile
Insurance Co., Nationwide Insurance Co. and Allstate
Insurance Co., a unit of Sears, Roebuck & Co., that have
their own sales personnel, rather than working through
independent agents around the country.</p>
<p>Industry studies have found that these companies are
already more efficient than the agency companies and offer
generally better pricing to consumers.</p>
<p>Participating in the network venture are CNA Insurance
Cos., Fund America Cos.' Fireman's Fund Insurance unit,
Travelers Corp. and New Hampshire Insurance Co., a unit of
American International Group Inc. They will provide some of
the capital to develop the software link that agents and
companies will be using.</p>
<p>The aim is to make both the agents and the insurers more
efficient. Automation in the insurance industry remains
fragmented, and no standard for linking companies and agents
exists.</p>
<p>Agents need to be more productive, said Thomas Eustace,
chairman and chief executive officer of Applied Systems Inc.,
one of the data-management companies involved in the project.
He acknowledged that efficiencies envisioned by this software
system will be achieved only if many companies use it. The
other data-management firm is Agency Management Systems Inc.,
a Norwell, Mass.-based firm that is jointly owned by CNA,
Fireman's Fund and New Hampshire Insurance.</p>
<p>Robert Hunter, head of the National Insurance Consumers
Organization, said the need to develop such systems is "an
admission that there are some fairly large inefficiencies" in
insurance company operations.</p>
<p>He said he agrees that companies could achieve significant
savings if their back offices didn't have to re-enter
information they get from agents several times, such as
pricing, billing and claims processing. However, consumers
may not see any immediate benefit from this computer link, he
said.</p>
<p>Unlike the airline reservation systems, which gives
consumers with a personal computer access to airfare listings
and schedules, this system won't be available to the public.
Consumers will still have to rely on agents to get pricing
information.</p>
<p>"If the consumer isn't given good pricing information,
then (this system won't) do the consumer any good," said Mark
Cooper, an economist with the Consumer Federation of America.</p>
<p>A variety of data management companies already provide
computers and software to automate insurance agents' offices.
But some of these systems are incompatible and they force
agents to re-enter the same data for such operations as
accounting and pricing. Also, many of the major insurers, who
work through independent agents, have developed their own
systems for their agents to use, often making it
time-consuming and cumbersome for agents to deal with more
than a few companies.</p>
<p>"Some companies try to compete for agents based on
automation they can offer. They ought to compete on the basis
of price and service," said Patricia A. Borowski, head of
government and industry affairs for the National Association
of Professional Insurance Agents.</p>
<p>The insurance industry has been trying to establish a
data-communications system between agents and insurance
companies for several years now, but success has been
minimal. "It's not a technology issue," Ms. Borowski said.
"It's a political issue of whether or not (an insurer) wants
to have its agents communicate with multiple companies or
give them a system to communicate with just one company."</p>
<p>The standardized software being developed by the joint
venture will be marketed to all property-casualty companies.
Lawrence Bacon, senior vice president for data-processing at
Travelers, said the various data-management firms that
specialize in agency automation should be able to incorporate
this software in the various systems they now sell.</p>
