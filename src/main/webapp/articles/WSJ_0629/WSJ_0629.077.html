	<p class="article-leader">On Wednesday, the Supreme Court ruled that Arizona's
death-penalty law was constitutional.
   Yesterday, the Supreme Court ruled that Arizona's
death-penalty law was unconstitutional.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>This unprecedented 24-hour-long precedent is new evidence
of how manipulative the liberal minority on the Supreme Court
has become. This term had other rulings that can only serve
to confuse many people about the Constitution's meaning. The
court allowed judges to levy taxes to pay for school
desegregation and let regulators grant broadcast licenses
based on race or gender. But this two-day flip-flop takes the
cake.</p>
<p>The immediate impact is that the murderer of reporter Don
Bolles will not be executed and that no one knows if the
death penalty in Arizona or similar laws in Idaho and Montana
are constitutional.</p>
<p>One-day "stare decisis" is the latest outrage from the
high court in death-penalty cases. Since 1976, the court has
ruled in various cases either that there was too much
discretion by a judge or a jury to issue the death sentence
-- or not enough discretion to sentence prisoners instead to
imprisonment.</p>
<p>Wednesday's ruling in Walton v. Arizona upheld a law that
gave the trial judge discretion to find aggravating
circumstances that justify the death penalty. Jeffrey Walton
had left his robbery victim blinded by a gunshot to the head
in the Arizona desert to die a death of dehydration,
starvation and pneumonia.</p>
<p>The five justices who upheld the death penalty were Chief
Justice Rehnquist and Justices White, O'Connor, Scalia and
Kennedy. The four dissenters were Justices Brennan, Marshall,
Blackmun and Stevens; Justices Brennan and Marshall repeated
their extralegal view that no death penalty under any
circumstances can be constitutional despite the
Constitution's explicit support for death sentences.</p>
<p>This 5-4 lineup upholding the death sentence set the stage
for the flip-flop in Lewis v. Adamson the very next day.
Harvey Adamson had been convicted and sent to death row for
the 1976 bomb killing of Mr. Bolles, an investigative
reporter for the Arizona Republic.</p>
<p>The court's decision to spare Adamson came in a 4-3 vote.
What happened is that only seven justices participated in the
decision whether to review the appeals-court decision that
had invalidated the Arizona law. This was because Justice
O'Connor, a former Arizona judge, and Justice Kennedy, a
former federal appeals judge, had participated in lower-court
decisions in this case. They recused themselves. This allowed
Justices Brennan, Marshall, Blackmun and Stevens to reverse
the previous day's ruling with only three justices available
to disagree with them.</p>
<p>Whatever you think of the death penalty, this was judicial
dirty pool. The four liberal justices apparently decided it
was worth junking standard judicial procedure in order to
"win" Adamson. When the Supreme Court rules in a related
case, as it did in Walton v. Arizona, the justices typically
follow what is known in court shorthand as G-V-R.</p>
<p>This stands for granting the petition to review the case,
vacating the lower-court ruling and remanding the case back
to the lower court for reconsideration in light of the new
high-court ruling. The four instead short-circuited this
procedure by declaring the Arizona death penalty dead after
one day.</p>
<p>Justice Scalia must have known the liberals were about to
pull this stunt when he wrote a separate opinion in
Wednesday's case upholding the death sentence. "A
jurisprudence containing the contradictory commands that
discretion to impose the death penalty must be limited but
discretion not to impose the death penalty must be virtually
unconstrained," he wrote, caused a "permanent flood-tide" of
appeals. This back and forth on the death penalty, he said,
causes "a fundamental uncertainty in the law that shows no
signs of ending or even diminishing."</p>
<p>Justice Scalia's example of absurd uncertainty in the law
was the lower-court opinion in the Adamson case, which he
noted was "essentially identical" to the Walton case
upholding the death penalty. He knew then what we know now --
that the views of five justices would last only a day when
confronted with the views of four.</p>
<p>The court ends the term with the liberals perhaps
understandably feeling the pressure of minority status.
Still, there can be no excuse for gamesmanship in
constitutional law. There certainly is no justice when a
murderer gets to escape the ultimate punishment simply
because he had the good fortune that two justices had to
recuse themselves from his case. The likely solution will
come only when President Bush gets the chance to replace some
of the less principled members of this court.</p>
