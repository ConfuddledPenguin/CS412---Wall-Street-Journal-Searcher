	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- The Small Business Administration put a
90-day moratorium on approving new licenses for Small
Business Investment Companies, beginning today.
   SBICs are privately organized venture capital firms that
invest in small businesses. The SBA licenses and regulates
these firms, and then makes loans to them. The companies then
use those funds to invest in other concerns.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Sen. Dale Bumpers, (D., Ark), chairman of the Senate Small
Business Committee, recently called for a license moratorium.
The committee has been investigating SBICs since last spring
when a Virginia-based SBIC went bankrupt, owing the
government about $32 million. At a Senate hearing last week,
SBA Inspector General Charles Gillum said his most recent
review of the program shows government losses could exceed
$800 million, up from a previously estimated $563 million.</p>
<p>SBA Administrator Susan Engeleiter said the moratorium
includes SBIC license applications already in hand at the
agency.</p>
