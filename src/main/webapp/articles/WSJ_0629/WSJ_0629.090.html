	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- The Federal Communications Commission
disbarred Thomas Root, the lawyer who gained national
attention a year ago when his small plane mysteriously
crashed into the ocean off the Bahamas and he was found with
a gunshot wound.
   The FCC gave Mr. Root until July 6 to end his FCC
practice. Mr. Root, who didn't challenge his disbarment, had
asked the FCC to allow him to continue practicing until Aug.
6, the day he is scheduled to be sentenced in federal court
on five felony counts.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Mr. Root pleaded guilty June 6 to the five counts,
including defrauding clients and submitting counterfeit
documents to federal agencies. He faces up to 35 years in
prison and $1.25 million in fines.</p>
