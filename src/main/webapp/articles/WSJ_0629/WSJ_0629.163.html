	<p class="article-leader">Meridian Bancorp, Reading, Pa., said its Meridian Mortgage
Corp. unit agreed in principle to acquire the retail
production operations of Travelers Corp.'s mortgage services
unit.
   Terms weren't disclosed. But Meridian said the deal will
create a combined retail mortgage-origination business with
an annual loan volume of about $3 billion.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Included in the transaction are 16 branch offices in
Connecticut, New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Delaware,
Maryland and Virginia, plus a customer service office and
some administrative support operations. Meridian Mortgage
won't acquire the Travelers operations in the New England
region, however.</p>
<p>Meridian Mortgage said the proposed acquisition is
consistent with the company's strategy to develop significant
production outside its banks' geographic markets.</p>
<p>The pact follows the sale of the other part of Travelers
mortgage-services business, including relocation services and
mortgage-wholesale operations, to GE Capital Corp. Travelers
had planned to sell the entire mortgage services unit to a
management and investor group nearly a year ago, but the sale
fell through.</p>
