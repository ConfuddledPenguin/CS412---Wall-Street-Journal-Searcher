	<p class="article-leader">Planning a graceful death doesn't rank at the top of
anyone's list of fun summer activities, but Monday's Supreme
Court ruling on the "right to die" has got a lot of people
thinking about it.
   By emphasizing the need for "clear and convincing" proof
of a patient's wishes, the ruling is likely to encourage
greater use of so-called living wills. These allow people to
spell out in advance their wishes about being kept alive
indefinitely if they fall victim to some severe and
irreversible condition.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"We've received thousands of calls," says Fanella Rouse,
executive director of Concern for Dying/Society for the Right
to Die. "There's something about this decision that has
really mobilized people to think about the need to put their
wishes in writing."</p>
<p>The Supreme Court case involved Nancy Cruzan, a
32-year-old Missouri woman who has been unconscious since a
1983 car accident. Her doctors say there's no hope she will
ever recover, and her parents have asked that life-support
systems be disconnected. They say she had expressed a desire
not to be kept alive after a serious injury if she couldn't
function normally.</p>
<p>In its ruling, the court recognized for the first time
that the Constitution protects a person's decision to refuse
artificial life support. But, upholding a lower court's
rejection of the parents' request, the justices said the
states may require a high standard of proof of a patient's
wishes.</p>
<p>For people who are worried that they may someday be kept
alive in a vegetative condition against their wishes -- and
at potentially enormous cost -- a living will is essential,
say lawyers, doctors and others who counsel individuals and
their families on patients' rights. Already, says the
American Medical Association, an estimated 15% to 20% of
adult Americans have written a living will.</p>
<p>"It's rising exponentially," says Linda Emanuel, a
physician who has discussed living wills with hundreds of
patients at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston. "It's
almost a fad, but a fad I approve of."</p>
<p>The key to writing a successful living will is using
explicit language. Your wishes have to be stated in a way
"that your intent will later be judged sufficiently clear by
people taking care of you," says Ms. Rouse. For example, if
an individual specifies that he doesn't want to be kept alive
if he's in a "terminal" condition, he should indicate what he
means by "terminal," since doctors interpret the word
differently.</p>
<p>Society for the Right to Die has living-will forms for
each state. They are available by writing to the organization
at 250 West 57th Street, New York, N.Y. 10107.</p>
<p>Other sources of living-will forms include local senior
centers. While individual lawyers can also help with a living
will, some of them say it probably isn't necessary to spend
the money, since the forms are designed to be used without
legal assistance.</p>
<p>It would probably make more sense "to fill them out by
yourself, after discussing them with your doctor," says Dr.
Emanuel.</p>
<p>An advantage of this is that people can then have their
living wills entered into their medical records, which can be
available immediately if they are brought in for treatment.
Doctors also recommend that a spouse or next of kin be given
a dated copy.</p>
<p>Dr. Emanuel and some others say that people shouldn't rely
solely on a basic living will. To help ensure that a person's
wishes will be clear enough to be effective, they advise
attaching a "medical directive."</p>
<p>Dr. Emanuel and her husband, Ezekiel Emanuel, a physician
at Boston's Beth Israel Hospital, have developed a suggested
directive. It sets out four scenarios and allows people to
specify the treatment they would want in each case.</p>
<p>The form combines a living will with a durable power of
attorney, which enables a designated guardian to manage the
patient's finances and legal matters while the person is
disabled. It also includes a section for organ donation
instructions and a personal statement.</p>
<p>"The personal statement allows people to say something
extremely important to them" and put their choices in a
larger context, says Linda Emanuel. For instance, she says,
someone might emphasize that the most important thing to them
is their independence, or sparing their family financial and
emotional hardship.</p>
<p>The form can be obtained by sending a self-addressed,
stamped envelope and $1 to The Medical Directive, Harvard
Medical School Health Letter, 164 Longwood Avenue, 4th floor,
Boston, Mass. 02115.</p>
<p>Even if an individual has already written a living will,
it's important to review it periodically. "You might not feel
the same way at age 60 as you did at age 30," says Ms. Rouse,
"and your interests might also change in light of new medical
discoveries."</p>
