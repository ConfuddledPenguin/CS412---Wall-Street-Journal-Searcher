	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- The Toyota group announced plans to purchase
as much as $94 million in U.S.-supplied semiconductors for
use in its world-wide car production over the next three
years.
   Hironobu Ono, a Toyota Motor Corp. electronics engineering
manager, announced these purchasing plans after assuring U.S.
trade officials that Toyota and its family of suppliers are
doing their part in increasing U.S. access to the Japanese
semiconductor market. Mr. Ono said that U.S. suppliers likely
will increase their share of the group's semiconductor
business to 10.9% in 1992 from 2.1% in 1989.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Toyota announced that, in addition to its purchases of
U.S. standard chips, it has chosen five U.S. semiconductor
makers to deliver as many as 23 types of custom-made devices
for controlling transmission, suspension, engine, audio and
other automotive functions. The U.S. vendors are Motorola
Inc., Intel Corp., National Semiconductor Corp.,
International Rectifier Corp. and Texas Instruments Inc.</p>
<p>Mr. Ono said these U.S. devices could cost a little more
than the Japanese ones that they are intended to replace, but
are comparable in quality.</p>
<p>A Motorola spokesman said plans by Toyota and other
Japanese carmakers to expand their purchases of U.S.
semiconductors could push the U.S. closer to its goal of
capturing 20% of the Japanese semiconductor market. The U.S.
share currently is 11%.</p>
