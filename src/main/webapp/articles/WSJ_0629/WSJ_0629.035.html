Institute seminar on May 14:</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>I see nothing frightening about foreign direct investment
in America. As a matter of fact, almost every country during
its period of takeoff has had plenty of investment from
abroad, in the form of foreigners buying plants and taking
over businesses. Historically, if you go back as far as the
middle ages, there were in succession three clear leaders
before the United States: Italy, Holland, and Great Britain.
In the century before Italy lost its leadership,
opportunities for investment in Italy didn't look too good
and so the Italian bankers sent their money abroad. No one
was spending money in Italy. They lent it to the King of
Spain (who would eventually go bankrupt) and to the King of
England and other useful enterprises like that. When the
Dutch took over, in the century before their decline, people
stopped investing in Holland, including the Dutch, and
started to invest in England, because a country in decline is
not a good place to invest in. Then when the British reached
what is called their apex, they also started to send their
capital abroad. In 1913, half of British savings were
exported. So it is certainly not a sign of decline if the
rest of the world is willing to send money to the United
States.</p>
