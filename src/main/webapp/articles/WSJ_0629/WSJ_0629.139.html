	<p class="article-leader">CHARLESTON, W.Va. -- Former West Virginia Gov. Arch A.
Moore Jr. is seeking permission to withdraw his guilty plea
on five felonies relating to a scheme to extort money from a
coal operator and to buy votes.
   In a federal court filing, attorneys for the three-term
Republican governor maintain that his plea was "the result of
a hasty decision forced by a deadline imposed by the
government." The filing seeks permission to plead not guilty.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Mr. Moore pled guilty to charges of extortion, fraud, tax
evasion and obstruction of justice. Those charges carried a
maximum 36-year prison sentence and $1.2 million in fines.</p>
<p>The filing says Mr. Moore was given one day to decide to
plead guilty or face an indictment on 28 counts, including a
federal racketeering charge.</p>
<p>Moreover, the filing said Mr. Moore was strongly advised
by his counsel, William G. Hundley, to plead guilty after the
government presented Mr. Hundley with recorded tapes relating
to the obstruction charge. The filing said the government
played the tapes and then required a signed plea agreement
within one day to avoid the 28-count indictment.</p>
<p>Michael Carey, a U.S. attorney, said he would file a
memorandum refuting Mr. Moore's claim and request the court
to proceed with sentencing July 10.</p>
