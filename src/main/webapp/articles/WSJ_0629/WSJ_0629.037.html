	<p class="article-leader">In any account of recent Soviet history, the late Andrei
Sakharov is certain to occupy a special place. He was first
of all a pre-eminent physicist who won a high position in the
Soviet establishment as the so-called "father" of the
hydrogen bomb. Beginning in the mid-1960s, moreover, when he
began speaking out against the policies of the Soviet
government -- and ultimately the whole communist system --
Mr. Sakharov won even greater fame as the most privileged of
the Soviet dissidents. For his public campaigns in defense of
human rights and the control of nuclear arms, he was awarded
the Nobel Peace Prize in 1975. And at the time of his death
in December, this recipient of some of the highest honors the
Soviet regime could bestow -- Hero of Socialist Labor, winner
of the Stalin Prize, each accompanied by a large sum of money
-- had become one of the leading spokesmen for democratic
reform in the new Soviet parliament.
   How this essentially shy and unworldly scientist emerged
from what he called "my hermetic world" to become one of the
century's most celebrated champions of human rights, and what
he and his loved ones were obliged to suffer, now is told at
great length in Mr. Sakharov's "Memoirs" (Knopf, 775 pages,
$29.95), a work that is required reading for anyone
attempting to understand the Soviet Union today.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The book is of historic importance on a number of counts.
It is the first, I believe, to take us inside the highest
stratum of the Soviet scientific community and illuminate
both the political and the social conditions under which it
functioned. (The Installation, as Mr. Sakharov calls it,
where he lived and pursued his top-secret work on nuclear
weapons for 20 years, was itself a kind of gilded gulag.) The
book also is one of the first to explore the variegated world
of the Soviet dissident movement and identify some of the
conflicts and suspicions that deeply divided it -- conflicts
that, in Mr. Sakharov's case, brought him into open
disagreement with, among others, Alexander Solzhenitsyn and
Roy Medvedev.</p>
<p>Mr. Sakharov himself was an unlikely candidate for the
task of straddling the disparate worlds of Soviet privilege
and dissident revolt. By his own account, he had approached
his work on the hydrogen bomb "as a soldier" whose loyalty
was never in doubt. While fully conscious of what he
described as "the terrifying, inhuman nature of the weapons
we were building," Mr. Sakharov readily acknowledges that he
nonetheless found "the physics of atomic and thermonuclear
explosions . . . a genuine theoretician's paradise."</p>
<p>In fact, it wasn't until he had successfully completed his
work on the H-bomb that Mr. Sakharov woke up to the
implications of its use and to the real nature of the regime
his talents had served so faithfully. So deep was his feeling
of attachment to the regime -- and, it must be said, so naive
was Mr. Sakharov about its tolerance of criticism -- that
when he took the fateful step of publishing his "Reflections
on Progress, Peaceful Coexistence, and Intellectual Freedom"
in 1968, he promptly sent a copy to Leonid Brezhnev.</p>
<p>But with the publication of his "Reflections," which
within a year sold more than 18 million copies around the
world -- "in third place," Mr. Sakharov amusingly reports,
"after Mao Zedong and Lenin, and ahead of Georges Simenon and
Agatha Christie" -- he became the foremost figure of the
entire dissident movement.</p>
<p>What is most remarkable and most moving about the story
that Mr. Sakharov recounts is both the speed and moral fervor
with which he pursued his new political life. Although new to
the arena of dissident action, he seems to have mastered its
complex strategies as easily as he had surmounted the most
intractable scientific problems in his earlier life. There
can be no doubt that his marriage to Elena Bonner enormously
strengthened Mr. Sakharov in this remarkable endeavor. His
first wife had died of cancer, and the account of his second
marriage in "Memoirs" is at once a very touching love story
and a tale of intrepid political courage.</p>
<p>Many of Mr. Sakharov's activities as a dissident took
place within the historical framework of the two military
actions that did so much to destroy whatever remained of the
Soviet regime's moral standing in the world -- the 1968
invasion of Czechoslovakia and the 1979 invasion of
Afghanistan. It was the latter, of course, that led to Mr.
Sakharov's enforced exile in the city of Gorky during the
early 1980s, and there is nothing more harrowing in this book
than his account of the incessant harassment he and Ms.
Bonner had to suffer at the hands of the KGB during those
years. Among much else, earlier drafts of and notes for
"Memoirs" were stolen and had to be laboriously rewritten
from memory.</p>
<p>It is not only for this reason, however, that the book
suffers from some conspicuous literary deficiencies. Mr.
Sakharov is not a literary artist, and he makes it clear to
the reader at the outset that "This book is not a confession,
nor do I lay claim to having produced a work of art."
Needlessly repetitious at times, the book also is a good deal
longer than it needs to be. Yet whatever its faults, the
story told in Mr. Sakharov's "Memoirs" is the story of one of
the great moral victories of our time.</p>
