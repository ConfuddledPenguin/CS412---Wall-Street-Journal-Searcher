	<p class="article-leader">David Frum missed the point on his journey of bewilderment
into Penn Station ("Why Would Anyone Live in Penn Station?"
editorial page, May 30).
   Why, indeed, would anyone sleep in Penn Station, if he
could go home to a nice warm bed, with a down comforter and a
four-poster all around? These people are home. Operating in
the same economic system as Mr. Frum, they wound up at the
bottom. At that level, few boots have large enough straps for
self-elevation.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>I doubt if many of them would choose to remain there, if
given the opportunity to live in a condo, or house, and wake
up to a good-paying, interesting job each day. But I get the
impression from his article that Mr. Frum believes they do
have better accommodations elsewhere, with good jobs begging
them anon. And, simply to vex him and his fellow travelers,
they choose not to work, and then have the effrontery to
spend their nights at Penn Station, sleeping off the results
of their drunken celebrations at having beaten off the cursed
evils of that demon called work for yet another day.</p>
<p>Capitalism and free enterprise have created great rewards
and wealth for the majority of Americans, and will continue
to do so. But they are competitive systems, and while winners
do very well, the also-rans sometimes do not. Mr. Frum seems
to believe that only the winners count, and appears to ask,
somewhat bewildered, why everyone isn't a winner like
himself.</p>
<p>The homeless and the jobless are the other face of the
modern economic coin. Although somewhere along the way they
lost their place in line for a share of the American dream,
they, like Mr. Frum, still need to sleep somewhere, if only
to dream.</p>
