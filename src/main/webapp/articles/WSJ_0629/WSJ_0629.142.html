	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- Social Security, the one program that
politicians have been afraid to touch for years, is on the
table at the bipartisan budget talks.
   Congressional and administration negotiators are talking
increasingly about raising taxes on Social Security benefits.
They also are discussing the politically risky option of
delaying or otherwise reducing cost-of-living adjustments for
Social Security and other government benefit programs.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Negotiators caution that many proposals being discussed
eventually will be discarded. "We're going to leave a lot of
things on the table," said Rep. Bill Frenzel (R., Minn.).</p>
<p>Nevertheless, participants acknowledge that deliberations
over the past two days indicate that negotiators are more
willing to consider Social Security cuts than they have been
in the past. Social Security accounts for 20% of all federal
spending.</p>
<p>The budget talks also focused on the Pentagon budget, with
House Budget Committee Chairman Leon Panetta (D., Calif.)
suggesting that projected defense outlays be cut $16 billion
next year. That would leave next year's defense spending
about 3% below this year's level. Rep. Panetta's plan would
cut projected outlays $275 billion over five years.</p>
<p>The Bush administration, in contrast, proposes reducing
projected defense outlays by just $6 billion next year and
$109 billion over five years. The Bush plan would push
defense expenditures higher than this year's level.</p>
<p>Since President Bush declared Tuesday that tax increases
are needed to shrink the deficit, negotiators have moved from
partisan posturing to examining specific ways to reduce red
ink. House Majority Leader Richard Gephardt (D., Mo.) said
negotiators will start assembling a deficit-reduction package
after Congress returns from its weeklong Fourth of July
break.</p>
<p>One deficit-reduction option being considered is to
increase taxes on Social Security benefits. Couples earning
more than $32,000 a year, and individuals earning more than
$25,000, currently pay federal income taxes on 50% of those
benefits. Rep. Panetta's list of options includes the idea of
taxing 85% of the benefits paid to couples earning more than
$18,000, according to participants in the budget talks. For
individuals, the threshold would be $12,000. The change would
raise an estimated $3.1 billion in revenues next year and $54
billion over five years.</p>
<p>Negotiators also have discussed a three-month delay in
cost-of-living adjustments for all government benefit
programs. This would save more than $3 billion in the first
year and more than $17 billion over five years, according to
congressional estimates.</p>
<p>But some negotiators said such a plan won't be part of any
final compromise. "There are some people talking about that,
but that's not going to happen, in my judgment," said Senate
Budget Committee Chairman James Sasser (D., Tenn.).</p>
<p>The political risks of cutting Social Security benefits
are obvious to all the negotiators. Asked if anyone flinched
when cost-of-living adjustments were raised in the budget
negotiations, Sen. Lloyd Bentsen (D., Texas) said, "Everyone
flinched."</p>
<p>Negotiators say that their willingness to contemplate
cutting or taxing Social Security benefits reflects a
consensus that the elderly -- at least those who aren't
poormust share the pain of cutting the deficit. "You can't
hurt one group and leave another untouched, particularly one
that is rather affluent by comparison," Rep. Frenzel said.</p>
<p>But some negotiators prefer that the elderly's
contribution toward deficit reduction come out of the
fast-growing Medicare program, another subject of discussion,
Rep. Panetta said.</p>
<p>Separately, Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady notified
Congress that the government will default unless Congress
raises the federal debt ceiling before it leaves for its
August vacation. The current ceiling is $3.12 trillion.</p>
<p>Congress inevitably acts before the Treasury defaults, but
the debt-ceiling measure is always politically troublesome to
lawmakers, and it usually attracts a number of unrelated,
controversial amendments.</p>
