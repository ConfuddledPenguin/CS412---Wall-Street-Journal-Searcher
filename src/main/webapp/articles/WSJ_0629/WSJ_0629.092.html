	<p class="article-leader">The 1,000 low-income Milwaukee children who hope to use a
new voucher plan to attend a nonsectarian, private school of
their choice won two victories this week. The teachers'
unions that had tried to block the plan lost their bid to
have the case heard first by the Wisconsin Supreme Court. And
the anti-voucher State Superintendent of Public Instruction,
Herbert Grover, agreed to let schools join the program even
if they hadn't filled out the maze of forms he had devised to
frustrate them. Mr. Grover gave in one day before a hearing
on a request for an injunction against him by pro-voucher
forces.
   Applications for the program are pouring in by the
hundreds and there's talk of expanding it if the results are
good. That's why Mr. Grover and his union allies will still
insist on enveloping the schools in the same stifling
bureaucracy that has ruined Milwaukee's public schools. As
the opposition to the choice plan grows ever more stubborn,
we suspect that increasing numbers of parents of
schoolchildren in the inner cities will challenge the
bureaucratic status quo with teaching alternatives.</p>
