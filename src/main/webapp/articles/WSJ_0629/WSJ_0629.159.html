	<p class="article-leader">TOKYO -- T. Boone Pickens Jr. and his entourage of U.S.
shareholders stormed out of Koito Manufacturing Co.'s annual
meeting yesterday in frustration over their inability to get
seats on the auto-parts maker's board.
   "It was a sham, an absolute farce," declared Mr. Pickens,
who through his Dallas-based Boone Co. owns a 26% stake in
the Japanese concern. Mr. Pickens complained that Koito's
management didn't respond fully to his and other
shareholders' questions about the company's finances, and he
fumed that his requests for representation on the board were
"stonewalled" because he's an American.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Koito's president, Takao Matsuura, said he "regretted"
that Mr. Pickens and his group left the shareholder's meeting
early. He called the move a "staged event" typical of Mr.
Pickens's publicity-seeking tactics. "We responded to
shareholders' questions the best we know how, and to the
greatest extent possible," Mr. Matsuura said at a news
conference following the annual meeting at a Tokyo hotel.</p>
<p>Other observers suggested that Mr. Pickens's actions were
designed as a face-saving move to allow him to justify an
exit from Koito. He has owned stock in the company since
March 1989 but has been unable to gain seats on its board or
any role in the company's management. Mr. Pickens said he
left the meeting, but "I'm not walking out of this fight."</p>
<p>At the meeting, Mr. Pickens and 32 Americans for whom he
paid travel expenses were cordoned off from Japanese
shareholders. Worried about possible violence, Koito said it
hired 25 guards, in addition to the 20 security men provided
by the hotel, to protect Mr. Pickens and his group from other
angry shareholders. Koito officials say Mr. Pickens and his
group agreed to this seating.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, Mr. Pickens said he was disgusted by the way
the meeting was conducted. "For three hours, we endured the
shouting of Japanese hecklers which went unchecked by
management or security," Mr. Pickens said. Although the
hecklers didn't have microphones and were difficult to hear
from a distance, according to one U.S. shareholder in their
midst, some yelled, "Yankee go home," and "we won the
economic war."</p>
<p>At the news conference, Mr. Matsuura said it was
unfortunate that some of the "sokaiya", or gangster-backed
hecklers, who attended the meeting shouted insulting remarks
at the Americans. Yet he insisted that such remarks were
beyond the control of Koito and reflected the opinions of
other shareholders, not the company.</p>
<p>Mr. Pickens became involved with Koito 16 months ago,
purchasing a 20% stake in the firm from Kitaro Watanabe, one
of Japan's wealthiest men and a notorious greenmailer. Since
then, Mr. Pickens has increased his stake to 26%, and he
vowed this week to boost his stake to 30%. He has repeatedly
demanded representation on Koito's board, insisting he is a
long-term investor.</p>
