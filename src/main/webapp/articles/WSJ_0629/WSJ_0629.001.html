	<p class="article-leader">SEOUL, South Korea -- French manufacturers of
sophisticated consumer goods accused South Korea of being the
world's chief counterfeiter of trademark products, and
demanded that the government put a stop to the practice.
   Officials of the Paris-based Union des Fabricants, an
international anti-counterfeiting organization, charged that
South Korea has become "a haven for the protection of fakes
and a top world exporter of fakes." They said most of the
counterfeit products sold in Japan, the U.S. and South
America today are made in South Korea.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Union des Fabricants said it had complained about the
issue many times to South Korean officials. All it has gotten
in response, it says, are a number of seizures of fake goods,
excuses about the difficulty and expense of enforcing
anti-counterfeiting laws and promises to toughen policing
procedures.</p>
<p>The South Korean government official in charge of
protecting patents and trademarks denied claims that his
country has become the world's leading maker and exporter of
fake trademark products.</p>
<p>Kim Chulsu, commissioner of the Korea Industrial Property
Office, conceded that a counterfeiting problem does exist in
South Korea. He put the domestic sales alone of fakes at
about 80 billion won ($113.2 million) a year, and he
acknowledged that while his government has no figure on
exports, it probably is higher. But he said that the
government is making great headway in curtailing the problem.
"Their impressions are just impressions," said Mr. Kim, "and
I don't agree with their assessment of the situation."</p>
<p>He said South Korea has "made a very strong and concerted
effort" to reduce the domestic and export traffic in fakes.</p>
<p>"Our own perception," he said, "is that the problem of
counterfeits has substantially decreased" since 1987, when
South Korea began to toughen investigation and law
enforcement on counterfeiting. He noted that South Korean
authorities confiscated 186,000 fake products in the first
half of this year, compared with more than 150,000 seized in
all of 1989.</p>
<p>Mr. Kim took particular exception to the claim by a
trademark specialist for Cartier that South Korea has become
"number one in the world of fakes." He said: "I regret that a
responsible person from a very well known company has made
such an allegation, which is . . . quite unfounded."</p>
<p>But Union des Fabricants officials, flanked by
representatives of such luxury-goods makers as Chanel, Yves
Saint Laurent, Louis Vuitton, Cartier and Nina Ricci, said
the problem is getting worse and has become a major issue for
them as it has spread into exports.</p>
<p>Marc Fransanco, trademark specialist for Cartier, said 95%
of fake leather goods in Taiwan are South Korean-made, and
that hundreds of thousands of counterfeit Cartier eyeglass
frames made in South Korea have been seized in the Middle
East.</p>
<p>"In South America," said Mr. Fransanco, "not only Korean
products are offered there. Even Korean people are going into
countries like Argentina, Chile and Paraguay to create the
counterfeit business in those countries. So Korea is
definitely No. 1 in the world of fakes. And they want to stay
there."</p>
<p>Mr. Fransanco and the other manufacturers acknowledged
that their sales in Korea hadn't been hurt by counterfeiting,
but declined to disclose financial details. But they said the
on-going damage to their image and the credibility of their
trademarks could eventually cripple them.</p>
<p>For that reason, they said, they are throwing down the
gauntlet to Seoul. They said they will deliver a position
paper on counterfeiting in South Korea to the government,
offer their help in stopping the proliferation of fake
products made in South Korea and set a deadline for achieving
some progress. Although the group didn't say what it would do
if the deadline isn't met, Alain Thrierr, president of Union
des Fabricants, said the issue may next be taken up with
international organizations.</p>
<p>"We want to pass the message that we don't want to suffer
this problem any longer," said Mr. Thrierr. He said his group
has targeted Itaewon, one of Seoul's most popular shopping
districts, internationally known as a source of fake Gucci
bags, Cartier watches, Yves Saint Laurent clothing and other
products.</p>
<p>"Itaewon is not the only place in Korea, but it's our
choice of where to begin," said Mr. Thrierr. He said Union
des Fabricants will help. "We will make searches. We will
supply information. We will pay some expenses, like for
trucks and things like that." But in the end, he said, the
South Korean government must enforce its own laws against
trademark violation.</p>
<p>The position paper asks that the government:</p>
<p>-- Systematically confiscate and destroy counterfeit
goods.</p>
<p>-- Inspect all trade and accounting documents of known
counterfeiters to track down suppliers, customers and other
accomplices.</p>
<p>-- Extend crackdown operations from wholesalers to include
retailers.</p>
<p>-- Apply strict criminal sanctions against violators as
laid down by South Korean law.</p>
<p>-- Take special emergency measures in Itaewon, such as
slapping permanent injunctions on major retail counterfeiting
networks.</p>
<p>It was the latest European broadside in an escalating
conflict between manufacturers of sophisticated consumer
goods and the South Korean government over what the companies
consider to be unfair trade practices that are damaging their
business.</p>
<p>Last month, a group of European ambassadors delivered a
formal protest to Seoul about intellectual-property-rights
violations. The ambassadors also complained about a public
campaign against so-called "luxury imports," that has forced
the closure of some boutiques importing costly European
products.</p>
<p>Neither Union des Fabricants officials, nor company
representatives, linked the two issues openly. But they noted
that the campaign against the import of genuine high-value
products would likely boost the sales of counterfeit products
in South Korea.</p>
