	<p class="article-leader">BEVERLY HILLS, Calif. -- When International Lease Finance
Corp. announced its purchase of a then-record $4.6 billion of
Boeing Co. planes two years ago, the Seattle jet-maker's
chairman scribbled a note to the leasing company's president
that couldn't have been more appropriate: "You've come a long
way, baby."
   After all, Steven Udvar-Hazy was truly in his business
infancy when he cut his first airplane deal back in 1967.
Then 21 years old and still studying economics at the
University of California at Los Angeles, he had heard about a
Lockheed Electra that Air New Zealand was trying to unload.
He told the carrier he'd help find a buyer -- for a price.
Communicating by Telex -- "I was afraid if someone saw me,
they'd be disappointed in how young I was," he recalls -- the
precocious middleman arranged a deal that allowed him to
pocket a 5% fee, or a cool $50,000.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Mr. Udvar-Hazy has been peddling planes ever since,
ultimately building International Lease into one of the
world's three premier airliner lessors, along with
Ireland-based GPA Group Ltd. and Ansett Worldwide Aviation
Services, of Australia.</p>
<p>This week, though, Mr. Udvar-Hazy made the most important
sale of his life: that of his own company.</p>
<p>If shareholders approve the deal, International Lease will
be merged into American International Group Inc., a giant
global insurance concern, in a cash-and-stock transaction
valued at roughly $1.3 billion. Mr. Udvar-Hazy, now 44,
himself holds about 19% of International Lease.</p>
<p>Generally, the marriage has been well received in the
financial community, though some analysts suggest
International Lease might have held out for more than
American International's $32.50-a-share cash price. Cai von
Rumohr, who follows aerospace for Cowen & Co., figures
International Lease could have fetched closer to $40 a share.
He acknowledges, though, that the company will obtain easy
access to capital in the deal with American International,
which showed a colossal profit of $1.37 billion last year.</p>
<p>That's good news for International Lease, which already
carries about $2.2 billion of debt on its books. The company
is scheduled to receive through the year 2000 nearly $14
billion of aircraft from Boeing, McDonnell Douglas Corp. and
Airbus Industrie. "They could have gone private, but this
means they don't have to go to the equity market every 12 to
24 months" to raise funds, Mr. von Rumohr explains.</p>
<p>As for New York-based American International, the
International Lease purchase adds to its mature balance sheet
a company with rapidly growing revenue and earnings, and one
that will help the insurance company solidify its financial
services arm.</p>
<p>It also gets one heck of a salesman in Mr. Udvar-Hazy.</p>
<p>Born in Hungary, he fell in love with airplanes when he
was a boy. For fun, he used to collect airline timetables --
"I was fascinated with the movement of aircraft" -- and
remembers seeing his first DC-3 on a grassy field outside
Budapest.</p>
<p>After the Soviet occupation, his family escaped to
Stockholm in 1958, and eventually settled in Los Angeles.
Through his father, Mr. Udvar-Hazy met another Hungarian
businessman, real estate developer Leslie Gonda. Together
with Mr. Gonda's son, Louis, they started in 1973 a
forerunner company, Interlease Group Inc., relying mostly on
"a lot of intuition" about the market, Mr. Udvar-Havy says.</p>
<p>That, along with $150,000 and a bank loan, landed the
company its first four-engine DC-8, which it leased to Air
Mexico. Today, International Lease Finance has $3 billion in
assets and 38 customers in 20 countries.</p>
<p>Mr. Udvar-Hazy, a certified commercial-jet pilot who can
relate to his customers viscerally, regularly offers insights
into the fleet configuration decisions being made by some of
his clients.</p>
<p>"We're aggressive, always trying to think ahead," he says.
In recent years, for example, the company has concentrated on
building a stable of new planes, anticipating the safety
concerns surrounding aging aircraft. Its average 3.3-year-old
fleet is considered the youngest anywhere. The company tended
to order jets early in the latest buying cycle, he says, so
that airlines wanting prompt delivery would have to choose
International Lease over slower rivals. The company already
has leasing commitments for all of its planes through 1992.</p>
<p>By locking in first, "we've ordered a fleet of aircraft at
great prices," Mr. Udvar-Hazy maintains. Now, with the
acquistion by American International, "we have low-cost
financing too. That is not happy news for our competitors."</p>
<p>He adds that the American International buy-out "shows
that the leasing companies have arrived and are here to
stay." Actually, some critics lately have wondered how strong
the aircraft leasing business really is. A rather bearish
report in Grant's Interest Rate Observer last April noted
that aircraft orders and airline capacity are growing faster
than airline traffic. The publication also cited investors
who had assumed short positions on International Lease
Finance, betting that the stock would go down because the
aircraft-buying frenzy would subside sooner than many expect.</p>
<p>Still, Mr. Udvar-Hazy is positively bullish. And although
the company hardly can be accused of scrimping -- a Renoir
adorns the conference room of its opulent offices here -- he
has kept International Lease lean by holding to a 28-person
staff. Competitors wonder whether that will change with
American International involved. International Lease has
"prided itself on independence and flexibility," says one
person in the industry. "They may have given that away."</p>
<p>Mr. Udvar-Hazy counters that American International has
entrepreneurial roots similar to International Lease's.
Leslie Gonda says a bid from General Electric Co. was
rejected partly because GE was deemed too much an
institution. And American International pledges to leave Mr.
Udvar-Hazy and his troops alone. "We wouldn't be successful
if we had the characteristics of a bureaucracy or a civil
service mentality," says Maurice Greenberg, American
International chairman.</p>
<p>The three founders of International Lease, each of whom
made more than $1.5 million last year, work closely together.
The elder Mr. Gonda, 70, will remain chairman and
inspirational leader of the company. "I'm just a plain
businessman," the former farmer likes to say, "not like the
big gurus and geniuses on Wall Street." Louis, his son, is
the insurance and contracting expert. And Mr. Udvar-Hazy, who
is on a first-name basis with most of the world's airline
chiefs, is the pitchman.</p>
<p>The word is that his passion for airplanes sometimes gives
Mr. Udvar-Hazy an edge in leasing. And he is always looking
for a deal. Some years ago on a honeymoon down under, for
example, Mr. Udvar-Hazy put together a $100 million package
to market all of Air New Zealand's DC-10s. As for his new
bride? "She just laughed," he says.</p>
