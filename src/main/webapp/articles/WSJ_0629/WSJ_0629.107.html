	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- The former chief scientist of the Hubble
Space Telescope said NASA could have found the crippling
defect in the $2.5 billion spacecraft years ago if it had
performed a simple test that costs a few hundred thousand
dollars.
   At the same time, telescope scientists are pursuing
information that tests conducted on the Hubble were flawed.
Terry Facey, chief scientist for the Hughes Danbury Optical
Systems unit of General Motors Corp., which made the
telescope's mirrors, said the test equipment it used may have
been faulty. Hughes didn't check the test equipment more
rigorously, he said, because it would have "cost more and
taken longer."</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The former Hubble scientist, Robert Brown, said the
National Aeronautics and Space Administration could have
uncovered the problem as early as 1980. If NASA had built a
cheap observatory on the ground and aimed the Hubble mirrors
at a star, he said, a defect of the magnitude found in orbit
would have been readily observable. "If we had done it, we
could have caught the problem," according to Mr. Brown, who
was Hubble chief scientist from 1983 through 1985 and works
now as an astronomer at the Space Telescope Science Institute
in Baltimore.</p>
<p>Mr. Brown said he didn't know why NASA failed to perform
the test. However, he noted that the space agency cut a
number of tests early in the life of the telescope program,
because it assumed the space shuttle could pick up the
telescope and bring it back to Earth for repairs if problems
surfaced. This assumption of frequent pickups, which NASA
dropped as impractical in 1984, also gave the agency a
rationale for cutting the projected cost of the program to
win approval by Congress.</p>
<p>"The basic approach was that if problems came up that
would cost more than a certain amount of money or added to
schedule, those problems weren't addressed," Mr. Brown said.
"The idea was it {the telescope} could be picked up for
servicing," he added.</p>
<p>But Stephen Maran, a senior staff scientist at NASA's
Goddard Space Flight Center, disagreed. He said such a test
would have been very difficult and "would have risked the
mirror to contamination in the atmosphere."</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Robert O'Dell, another former Hubble chief
scientist who now works at Rice University, said the agency
suspects that Hughes, the mirror maker, used faulty equipment
when testing the mirror. That led the testing to indicate
that the mirror was correctly formed, Mr. O'Dell said, when
it really wasn't.</p>
<p>Optics experts said the test equipment, called null
optics, must be exhaustively checked. In a null test, a laser
shines through a piece of optical equipment onto the
telescope mirror in order to form a beam of light with the
same characteristics as the mirror being tested. Usually, two
different sets of null optics are used, to cross-check the
results. The equipment also could have been used on a spare
mirror that had been produced for Hubble, said an official at
an optics company, to make sure the equipment was properly
shaped.</p>
<p>Mr. Facey, the Hughes scientist, acknowledged that the
null optics may have been "in error." He said Hughes,
formerly a division of Perkin-Elmer Corp., made only one copy
of the equipment and didn't use the spare mirror for testing.
"In hindsight, it would have been a great idea" to do the
additional tests, he said, but Hughes didn't consider it
"necessary."</p>
<p>The search for answers came a day after NASA announced
that the space telescope had a fundamental flaw in one of its
two mirrors. The defect will prevent the craft, the most
expensive satellite ever launched, from accomplishing many of
its planned scientific observations at least until 1993.
Hubble scientists had hoped to search for such exotic
phenomena as black holes and calculate the universe's size.</p>
<p>The agency said the mirror was incorrectly manufactured
and couldn't be fixed through the efforts of scientists on
the ground. Instead, NASA hopes to launch a camera by shuttle
in three years that would be attached to the telescope by an
astronaut. The camera is supposed to be able to correct the
mirror's flaws -- much like fitting the mirror with glasses.
As it is now, the orbiting telescope is terribly near sighted
and can't precisely image distant stars and galaxies.</p>
<p>Already the political recriminations have begun. Sen.
Albert Gore (D., Tenn.), chairman of a science, technology
and space subcommittee, plans to hold hearings on Hubble
today. Sen. Barbara Mikulski (D., Md.), who heads the Senate
appropriations panel overseeing NASA, also plans hearings.
The telescope's troubles "have seriously hurt the credibility
of NASA," she said. "They've had so much time and enough
money to get it right."</p>
<p>Edward Weiler, the Hubble program scientist, wouldn't
answer questions yesterday about the null test and about what
specifically went wrong with the telescope. He said that a
review board, led by Lew Allen, director of the agency's Jet
Propulsion Laboratory and a former military official in
charge of spy satellites, would investigate the telescope's
problems.</p>
<p>Mr. Weiler also reiterated NASA's contention that it had
rejected the most complete test for evaluating telescopes,
called auto-collimation, because it would cost "several
hundred million dollars."</p>
<p>In that test, a telescope's two mirrors are aligned
precisely. Then a beam of light is aimed through the
telescope onto a flat mirror outside the telescope. The flat
mirror reflects the light back into the telescope to a spot
near the original light source. The reflected image is then
compared with the original light.</p>
<p>James Wyant, president of closely held Wyko Corp., a
Tucson, Ariz., maker of optical test equipment, said NASA had
overestimated the cost of this alignment test. "Their figure
is amazingly high," he said. Mr. Facey, the Hughes scientist,
also called the figure "an exaggeration." An executive at
another optics company said the test could have been done for
roughly $10 million.</p>
<p>Other scientists doubt that NASA is right in blaming the
mirror manufacturing. Peter Franken, a University of Arizona
expert, said the error in the mirror is so bad -- 50 times
worse than the prescribed accuracy, he calculated -- that it
indicates the mirror was improperly designed. "They tested
the mirror to the design specs," he said.</p>
<p>Roger Angel, a University of Arizona astronomer who is
designing and building a large observatory on Mt. Graham in
Arizona, said the fundamental problem is NASA management. The
agency gave knowledgeable scientists great responsibility for
overseeing work on the telescope's cameras and instruments,
he said, but not on the telescope itself. "The people with
say-so weren't experienced builders who knew in the seat of
their pants how things could go wrong," he said.</p>
<p>The problems with the space telescope also raise questions
about the performance of U.S.'s newest generation of spy
satellites, because the spacecraft share much in common.
Jeffrey Richelson, who has written five books on intelligence
collection, said that Hubble and the new spy satellites,
popularly called the KH-12, are made by the same company,
Lockheed Corp. A government intelligence source said Hubble's
primary mirror was reduced in size to 2.4 meters largely to
make the mirror match those used on the spy satellites,
reducing costs to the government. However, two intelligence
sources said they aren't aware of any serious problems with
the KH-12, two of which are now believed to be in orbit.</p>
<p>Hubble's problems are sure to have great impact on future
space missions. Earlier mirror problems contributed to the
spacecraft running at least $1 billion over budget and seven
years late in launching. As a result, Congress insisted that
the space agency divide its proposed $1.5 billion orbital
X-ray telescope into two contracts. Until the mirrors are
produced to exacting specifications, the space agency can't
begin work on the spacecraft itself.</p>
<p>Jeffrey Mamber, executive director of the Space
Foundation, a space business group here, said he thinks
NASA's plans to spend $50 billion over 25 years to build and
operate six gigantic earth-observation satellites may also be
restructured as a result of Hubble's problems. Critics of the
program have been arguing that the project should be divided
into a large number of smaller satellites to make sure that
if one of the satellites fails, the project won't be
crippled.</p>
<p>"Hubble will do for space science what Challenger did for
space transportation," said Mr. Mamber. "It will cause
Congress to rethink an approach where all your eggs are put
into one basket."</p>
