	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- Venezuela and its major bank creditors
agreed on a debt settlement that includes provisions for new
loans and for cutting back old credits and interest payments
due on them.
   The settlement, which covers an estimated $20 billion of
medium-term and long-term foreign commercial bank debt, is
weighted more toward providing the country with new credits
than a recent similar bank-debt settlement with Mexico, the
first under the revamped U.S. debt strategy.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The agreement will be explained to Venezuela's smaller
bank creditors at meetings to be held in international
financial centers over the next several weeks.</p>
<p>Under the agreement, negotiated in New York over the past
few months, the country's bank creditors will have four
options.</p>
<p>First, to help provide Venezuela with new credits, banks
can purchase Venezuelan bonds to be issued over the next two
years. If they purchase these new money bonds, banks, as a
sweetener, will be able to exchange old loans for
debt-conversion bonds at a ratio of five such bonds for each
new money bond they buy. Banks often prefer to hold bonds
rather than loans because they are more easily traded.
Moreover, these conversion bonds will be eligible to be
exchanged for equity investments in Venezuela.</p>
<p>The second option will allow bank creditors to exchange
their old loans for short-term collateralized notes at a 55%
discount. These 91-day notes will be collateralized by U.S.
Treasury bills. But if they use this option, banks will
receive only 45 cents for each dollar face value of debt, a
rate roughly equal to the secondary-market price for
Venezuelan government foreign-bank debt. The Venezuelans will
accept as much as $5.5 billion of loans under this option.</p>
<p>The third option will allow banks to exchange loans for
30-year bonds that have their principal fully secured at
maturity by zero-coupon bonds. These new bonds either carry
fixed interest rates of 6.75% or represent a 30% discount to
the face value of the loan tendered.</p>
<p>The fourth option will allow banks to swap credits for
17-year bonds that have below-market interest rates for the
first five years of their life. These bonds will be backed by
a fund that guarantees 12 months of interest payments for
their first five years of life.</p>
