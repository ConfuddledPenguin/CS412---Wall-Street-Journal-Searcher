	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- The Senate Intelligence Committee voted to
cut off funding for a program of U.S. covert assistance to
the non-communist forces in Cambodia, according to
individuals familiar with the panel's actions.
   Committee Chairman David Boren (D., Okla.) declined to
comment on the committee's deliberation. But separately,
those individuals said it reflected increased concern about
the direction of U.S. policy in Cambodia as well as a desire
to invite more public debate on the issue.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The decision follows a House vote Wednesday to continue an
overt program of non-lethal assistance to the forces. In
recent years, intelligence committees in both chambers have
expressed growing concern over the wisdom of using covert
operations to sustain secret aid programs long after their
existence is known publicly.</p>
<p>In the past decade, the Central Intelligence Agency has
been used to provide covert U.S. aid to forces fighting in
regional conflicts in Angola, Afghanistan and Nicaragua, for
example, and critics argue that the result is often the
suppression of debate on Washington's policy.</p>
<p>In the case of Cambodia, the continuing assistance from
the U.S. has drawn criticism because of the brutal history of
the Khmer Rouge when it took over Cambodia in the 1970s.
Although restrictions prohibit any assistance to the Khmer
Rouge, the forces backed by the U.S. are part of a political
coalition with the Pol Pot guerrillas against the government
installed by the Vietnamese.</p>
<p>This sensitivity was underscored in the House debate this
week. To win support for the $7 million in overt aid,
proponents specified that all assistance would be nonlethal,
and new restrictions were imposed in response to criticism
that the insurgents are mounting operations in cooperation
with the Khmer Rouge.</p>
<p>Intelligence sources said the non-communist forces are
less military than political, and proponents of the program
argue that the U.S. therefore has an interest in sustaining
the forces as an alternative between the Khmer Rouge and the
Hanoi-backed government. By the same token, this goal might
be better accomplished through overt assistance, and the
House debate this week indicated that intelligence members
there appeared more comfortable with an open program than the
one under their jurisdiction.</p>
<p>The covert aid, believed to have begun in the early 1980s,
is said to have included logistical support and military
training. For a time, the program was operated through the
government of Thailand.</p>
<p>The Senate committee action came as part of closed-door
deliberations on the fiscal 1991 authorization bill covering
the CIA's budget. A House panel isn't expected to begin work
on its version of the bill until after the July Fourth
recess.</p>
