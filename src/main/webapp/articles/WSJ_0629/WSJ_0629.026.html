	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- During the 1980s, when the savings-and-loan
crisis festered and finally exploded, S&L interests
contributed more than $11 million to congressional
candidates.
   According to an analysis of Federal Election Commission
records by Common Cause, the top recipient of political
contributions from S&L executives, their families and
political action committees associated with thrift
institutions was Sen. Pete Wilson (R., Calif.), who took in
$243,334 from 1981-1990.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Also ranking in the top five are three senators -- Donald
Riegle (D., Mich.); Alan Cranston (D., Calif.); and Alfonse
D'Amato (R., N.Y.) -- who face ethics investigations into
their ties to campaign contributors, including those in the
S&L industry.</p>
<p>The release of the study comes amid a bitterly partisan
political debate over who is to blame for the S&L crisis. The
executive committee of the Democratic National Committee,
meeting in Portland, Ore., is expected to pass a resolution
tomorrow demanding that President Bush clean up "the
Republican-managed S&L mess." Republicans, meanwhile, are
encouraging their party's congressional candidates to use the
S&L issue to attack Democratic incumbents for mishandling
thrift legislation.</p>
<p>PACs for the financial-services industry, which includes
S&Ls, have been the largest corporate contributors to
congressional campaigns in recent years. In 1983-1990,
financial-services PACs gave nearly $22 million to candidates
for Congress.</p>
<p>Common Cause is using the S&L issue to pressure lawmakers
into passing legislation to overhaul campaign financing.
"We've had a $300 billion scandal and no one has done
anything to reform the corrupt system that let it happen,"
said Fred Wertheimer, president of the self-styled citizens
lobby. During the July 4 congressional recess, Common Cause
will unveil S&L-focused newspaper advertisements criticizing
specific lawmakers in eight states and a dozen congressional
districts.</p>
<p>Congressional Democrats, who control both chambers,
received a larger portion of the S&L campaign bounty,
according to the Common Cause study. Among the top 25
recipients of S&L-related contributions in the Senate and
House, Democrats took in $1.8 million while Republicans
received $1.4 million.</p>
<p>The study also shows that President Bush's 1988 campaign
benefited from $600,000 in "soft money" (large contributions
from wealthy individuals to political parties that are made
outside of the federal election law limits) from executives
in the S&L industry. That includes $100,000 from Charles
Keating, who is chairman of the former parent of Lincoln
Savings & Loan Association of Irvine, Calif., a
once-highflying thrift now in federal receivership.</p>
<p>Several failed or deeply troubled thrifts were among the
biggest sources of campaign contributions, including Lincoln;
Western Savings & Loan Association, Phoenix, Ariz., and
Vernon Savings & Loan Association, Dallas, whose former owner
was indicted this month.</p>
<p>The leading individual contributor among S&L interests was
Carl Lindner Jr., whose Ohio family contributed $828,920 to
congressional candidates. The Lindner family founded and
controls American Financial Corp., which owns Hunter Savings
Association. Mr. Lindner and Mr. Keating were once business
associates.</p>
<p>The top recipients of S&L-related contributions from
January 1981 through April 1990 were: Sen. Wilson, $243,334;
Sen. Riegle, $200,900; Sen. Lloyd Bentsen (D., Texas),
$154,207; Sen. Cranston, $143,700; and Sen. D'Amato, $88,235.</p>
