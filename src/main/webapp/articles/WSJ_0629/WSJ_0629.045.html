	<p class="article-leader">MANAGUA -- Taking a cue from Peruvian economist Hernando
de Soto, President Bush lectured Latin and Caribbean
diplomats in the White House Wednesday on what is stifling
Latin American development: "In one large Latin city . . . it
takes almost 300 days to cut through the red tape to open a
small garment shop," said Mr. Bush. "That's got to change. .
. . The future of Latin America lies with free government and
free markets."
   Today, few in Latin America would argue with that
prescription. The only question is how to administer the
medicine. A microcosm of what has gone wrong -- and what is
possible -- in Latin economies exists in Nicaragua. As the
new government struggles to revitalize Nicaragua's moribund
economy, it's worthwhile to see how it got there and how it
can free itself of the interventionist ties that bind it --
and other Latin economies -- to underdevelopment.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>During the 1980s, Nicaragua combined the import
substitution model with a "command" approach to economics.
Property rights were not respected, regulations were
excessive and market prices were distorted. Productive
activity was burdened by extremely high tariffs, punitive
marginal tax rates, and a wide variety of selective
consumption taxes. Statist monopolies and cartels replaced
the Somoza monopolies that dominated production before the
Sandinistas came to power in 1979. Moreover, the state became
the primary force in the economy through a system of
enterprises that controlled most imports, exports and
distribution, as well as key industries and banking.</p>
<p>By the end of the past decade, Nicaragua's real salaries
were less than 25% of what they had been 10 years before.
Real output fell nearly every year in the 1980s, and
unemployment soared to nearly one-fourth of the labor force,
despite massive emigration. The real volume of exports last
year was only about one-fifth of what it had been 13 years
earlier. The current account deficit reached one-fourth of
GNP. And Nicaragua's foreign debt amounted to nearly 40 times
its shrunken exports. Sadly, more than 10% of the population
left the country, including a sizable proportion of
Nicaragua's most skilled, energetic and talented "human
capital."</p>
<p>The previous government began a policy of frequent, large
devaluations of the Nicaraguan currency, designed to
eliminate the spread between official and black-market
exchange rates. But each devaluation creates expectations of
another, so the black-market exchange rate drops in
anticipation of the next official devaluation, requiring an
endless series of inflationary devaluations. The fear of
holding Nicaragua's repeatedly devalued currency results in
an enormous increase in "velocity," as people treat the
currency as a "hot potato" to pass on to someone else.
Inflation, therefore, has risen even faster than the runaway
money supply.</p>
<p>The main economic objectives of Violeta Chamorro --
inaugurated president on April 25 -- include securing
property rights, initiating substantial deregulation,
liberalizing trade, structural adjustment (including tax
reform) and stabilizing the currency. Her government will
have to move rapidly in all of these areas. Piecemeal reform
will not suffice.</p>
<p>In some cases, conventional macroeconomic adjustment plans
may, in the very short run, appear to be in conflict with
essential structural adjustments. For example, sharply
reducing protectionist tariffs might seem to conflict with
the budgetary need for revenues. Yet the dramatic reduction
of tariffs in Mexico and Chile did not weaken the fiscal
position of those countries, but instead strengthened it by
expanding employment, profits and sales. Once businesses face
reduced tariff expenses -- particularly on needed materials
and equipment -- the profitability and capacity of
Nicaragua's future export industries can be improved
enormously.</p>
<p>Excessive concern with short-term budget estimates
likewise could thwart an appropriately drastic reduction in
Nicaragua's steep marginal tax rates, which now top off at
70%. The income thresholds at which those tax rates apply
must be made competitive with those of the U.S. (the main
beneficiary of Nicaragua's flight of human capital). Moderate
tax rates can attract back the many professionals,
entrepreneurs and technicians who have left the country, as
well as attract foreign investment. And since we are starting
with such a small tax base -- Nicaragua's tax revenue as a
percentage of GNP was about 4% in 1989 -- we would have
everything to gain and very little to lose by a steep
reduction of tax rates.</p>
<p>A very important part of the reform package would be that
the only state enterprises allowed to borrow from the banking
system would be those that are profitable and current in
their tax obligations. Any projected deficit of unprofitable
state enterprises would have to be explicitly approved as
part of the projected deficit of the central government. Such
a requirement, combined with deregulation and liberalization,
will accelerate the necessary privatization or closing of
state enterprises. The Central Bank should not extend credit
or subsidies directly to any state enterprise, and should
program a significant reduction in the growth of credit
extended to the central government (and to the banking
system).</p>
<p>These reforms will restrain the rate of growth of the
money supply. But lasting monetary stability also requires
increasing the demand for Nicaragua's currency. That
objective requires anchoring the currency to the U.S. dollar,
while explicitly conducting monetary policy with the exchange
rate as the nominal target. If necessary, a temporary
alternative could be a gradual depreciation of the exchange
rate according to a predictable schedule, similar to the
crawling peg in Mexico. In either case, existing exchange
controls must be gradually lifted. A more-stable currency is
not inconsistent with maintaining purchasing power parity,
since it contributes to reduced inflation.</p>
<p>Nicaragua will need substantial foreign resources over the
next three years to help finance a legacy of external and
internal imbalances while constructive, growth-oriented
reforms are being put into effect. Important assistance has
been received already, including $300 million from the U.S.,
as well as aid from the donors conference in Rome, and
partial financing of oil imports from Venezuela. Nicaragua
also will request financial support for its program from the
International Monetary Fund in the form of a standby and
extended fund facility, and from the World Bank in the form
of structural and sector adjustment loans, with co-financing
from the Interamerican Development Bank (IDB). As a necessary
step, Nicaragua will have to meet arrears with the World Bank
and IDB in excess of $250 million.</p>
<p>Starting from such a weakened state, the Nicaraguan
economy has enormous potential for dramatic recovery, with
sound money, competitive tax rates, liberalized trade and
deregulation. As Mr. Bush emphasized on Wednesday, the old
days of massive U.S. aid pushing statist "development
programs" clearly are over. And no one should mourn their
passing. Internal development spurred on by deregulation and
openings to the global economy is the key to Latin America's
future.</p>
