	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- The Commerce Department said Los Angeles
County sanitation districts agreed to pay about $12 million
to settle a pollution claim and help clean up Los Angeles
Harbor.
   Last month, the department's National Oceanic and
Atmospheric Administration sued eight corporations for
allegedly polluting the coastal waters off Los Angeles and
Long Beach, Calif. NOAA previously informed the county
sanitation districts that it might also sue them for
operating the sewers that carry pollutants, primarily the
pesticide DDT and hazardous chemicals known as
polychlorinated biphenyls, or PCBs.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>In announcing the settlement, NOAA said the sanitation
districts agreed to pay $1 million to help prepare cases
against the eight corporations, $2 million to help determine
the cause and extent of environmental damage in Los Angeles
Harbor, $2 million to analyze what kind of restoration should
take place, $2 million for a pilot restoration project and $5
million for other restoration projects.</p>
<p>NOAA said any money it collects from the eight companies
will be used to restore waters and habitats. Such efforts
could include treating underwater sediments, restocking fish
and installing artificial reefs.</p>
