	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- House and Senate conferees removed a major
hurdle to passage of oil-spill legislation by rejecting
provisions that would have provided for U.S. participation in
an international treaty limiting shippers' liability.
   Rejection of the House language favoring the protocols,
which were strongly opposed by Senate Majority Leader George
Mitchell of Maine, came as a big disappointment to the tanker
industry and many oil companies. Some major companies,
including Royal Dutch/Shell Group and A.P. Moeller, already
have curtailed shipments to U.S. ports on the ground that the
potential liability for spills is too great in the absence of
limits.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The Senate conferees and several environmental groups,
however, adamantly oppose the treaty, which they said would
pre-empt tough state laws and allow polluters to avoid paying
for all the damage they caused. Sen. Mitchell said in an
interview that "the action today was significant and, I hope,
now clears the way for swift approval of the legislation." He
predicted that the conference could complete action on the
bill at its next session shortly after the Independence Day
recess.</p>
<p>In a statement, Transportation Secretary Samuel Skinner
called the action "a wrong decision for the wrong reasons"
and said the Bush administration will try to find
"legislative solutions to minimize the damage done by the
conferees today." Supporters of the treaty have argued that
it would provide the predictable legal framework needed to
keep responsible tanker operators coming to U.S. ports,
thereby ensuring a safe and adequate supply of oil.</p>
<p>The conferees approved a resolution expressing the sense
of the Congress that the U.S. should "participate in an
international oil pollution liability and compensation regime
that is at least as effective as federal and state laws in
preventing incidents and in guaranteeing full and prompt
compensation for damages resulting from incidents."</p>
<p>Remaining issues before the conferees include whether to
require double hulls on oil tankers. The two houses have
narrowed their difference on this matter substantially.</p>
<p>Among other provisions, the bill would raise federal
liability limits for tankers, barges and oil facilities,
although states could still enforce their own stricter
liability laws. Federal compensation, cleanup and
damage-assessment costs beyond the liability limits would be
paid out of a new $1 billion fund financed by a
five-cent-a-barrel tax on domestic and imported oil.</p>
<p>The fee, collected since Jan. 1, could be tapped only if
the accident doesn't involve gross or willful negligence. The
legislation would also improve contingency planning for
spills.</p>
<p>In debating the protocol question, Senate conferees
rejected a House offer that would have provided for
conditional participation in the treaty. The U.S. would have
agreed to sign on for five years while working to improve the
accords. If acceptable language couldn't be worked out, the
U.S. would renounce participation.</p>
<p>Among other complaints, Senate conferees said such a
strategy would undermine the constitutional role of the
Senate in ratifying treaties.</p>
