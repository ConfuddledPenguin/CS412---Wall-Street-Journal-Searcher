	<p class="article-leader">CHICAGO -- A McDonald's Corp. effort to promote its new
cheddar cheese hamburger may be facing a meltdown in Chicago.
   McDonald's placed hundreds of 3-foot-by-4-foot
mini-billboards throughout Chicago's downtown and its trendy
North Side on boxes for the Chicago Observer, a new monthly
newspaper that appears to be a vehicle for
outdoor-advertising concerns.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The signs, featuring the new Cheddar Melt sandwich, invite
passers-by hungry "For All the Juicy Details" to "Inquire
Inside" where cubbyholes hold copies of the 12-page
newspaper. While few people are talking about the paper,
which features an interview with Sean Connery and several
pages of society photographs, the 400 boxes have captured the
attention -- and the wrath -- of city officials. Some of the
boxes don't carry the McDonald's ads.</p>
<p>Aldermen, storefront businessmen and civic groups have
denounced the boxes as "eyesores" and "sneak attacks" on city
restrictions on billboards, sandwich boards and bench
advertising. The signs weren't up three days before Mayor
Richard M. Daley introduced an ordinance in the City Council
to restrict newsracks to 26 inches by 40 inches and to ban
all advertising from the racks.</p>
<p>Gary Weintraub, attorney for the Chicago Observer, says
the controversy is "a First Amendment issue involving a free
press and free speech." He says: "There were no ordinances on
the books when our boxes were put up. This is a fundamental
constitutional issue."</p>
<p>Mr. Weintraub says the Observer is no different from any
other newspaper except for "a policy to feature our
advertisers on our boxes." But Rick Johnson, marketing
supervisor for McDonald's Chicago region, says the
food-service concern bought the poster campaign as "a
package." He says the Oak Brook, Ill., company didn't
anticipate the uproar and usually steers clear of offending
"public perceptions" in its ad campaigns.</p>
<p>Cindy Mitchell, president of Friends of the Parks, a
watchdog group, says the paper is "trash" and its boxes are
"aesthetic nightmares." But for Mr. Weintraub, "One man's
eyesore is another man's jewel."</p>
<p>The paper's editor, M. Michael Petrovich, and its
investors, Robert Hoelterhoff and Robert and Terry Durkin,
all involved in outdoor-advertising concerns, couldn't be
reached for comment.</p>
