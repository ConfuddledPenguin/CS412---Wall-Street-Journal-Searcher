	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Investors' confidence in earnings was boosted
a bit yesterday as some companies reported improved quarterly
results, while a flight to shares of companies with proven
earnings records continued to buoy the broad market.
   The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed 16.58 points
higher at 2878.71. Many traders expect a rally today as big
institutions continue to load up on the year's topperforming
stocks on the last trading day of the second quarter. The
industrial average would have to add more than 57 points to
finish the quarter with a new record.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Though several stocks moved up sharply yesterday, New York
Stock Exchange volume was light at 136,120,000 shares.
Advancing issues outpaced decliners, 911 to 559.</p>
<p>Food stocks attracted buyers as quarterly earnings reports
from General Mills and ConAgra were well received, while the
drug and consumer products groups also were standouts.</p>
<p>American Telephone & Telegraph topped the Big Board's list
of most-active issues for the second consecutive session. The
stock fell 3/8 to 38 3/4 on volume of 3,753,100; the company
Wednesday said it expects to post lower second-quarter
earnings compared with a year earlier.</p>
<p>But among the Dow industrials, the setback in AT&T was
offset by rallies among the safe-haven consumer stocks. Merck
gained 1 7/8 to 86 1/8, Procter & Gamble climbed 2 to 85 3/4
and McDonald's rose 1 1/4 to 35 7/8.</p>
<p>"Investors are hiding in about 30 stocks" because they are
afraid of negative second-quarter earnings surprises, said
Thomas Gallagher, head of equity trading at Oppenheimer & Co.</p>
<p>Although International Business Machines eased 3/8 to 117
5/8, other technology issues helped lead the market's latest
advance. Digital Equipment rose 3 1/8 to 85 1/4, Compaq
Computer added 3 3/8 to 122 3/4 and Hewlett-Packard rose 1
1/8 to 47 3/8.</p>
<p>Broader averages also advanced. Standard & Poor's
500-stock index gained 2.49 to 357.63; the New York Stock
Exchange Composite index rose 1.31 to 195.18, and the Dow
Jones Equity Market Index rose 2.34 to 332.63.</p>
<p>General Mills, which reported a 31% increase in earnings
from continuing operations for the fiscal quarter ended May
27, rose 3 7/8 to 90 1/4, a 52-week high. The latest results
were stronger than most analysts had expected; after the
report, Morgan Stanley analyst Kurt Feuerman increased his
earnings estimates for fiscal 1991 and 1992 by five cents a
share to $5.30 and $6.20, respectively, according to Dow
Jones Professional Investor Report.</p>
<p>ConAgra added 1 3/4 to 35. Its earnings for the same
period went up 13% from the year-earlier level and were on
target with analysts' estimates.</p>
<p>Other food stocks to draw buyers included Gerber Products,
which went up 2 1/8 to 54 7/8; CPC International, up 1 3/4 to
80; Kellogg, up 1 7/8 to 66 1/2, and Ralston Purina, up 1 5/8
to 93.</p>
<p>Conversely, Olin's forecast that earnings for the second
quarter would be down 15% to 20% from a year earlier sent the
stock down 1 7/8 to 49 3/4 before a trading halt late in the
session.</p>
<p>Another victim of earnings-related selling was Sotheby's
Holdings, which dropped 1 1/8 to 15 5/8. Salomon Brothers
downgraded the stock's investment rating and cut its 1990
earnings estimate to a range of $2 to $2.10 a share from
$2.25.</p>
<p>Pennzoil, which is canceling plans to register 3,690,000
common shares issued earlier this year in an acquisition,
climbed 3 1/2 to 76 3/8. The decision means that the holders
of those shares won't be able to sell them publicly.</p>
<p>Avon Products rose 7/8 to 36 1/4 after Smith Barney,
Harris Upham added the stock to the firm's list of
recommended issues.</p>
<p>Polaroid added 7/8 to 40 5/8. The company agreed to
produce instant cameras for Japan's Minolta to market in the
U.S. under the Minolta brand name.</p>
<p>Manufacturers Hanover lost 1/4 to 34 1/2 after disclosing
that its second-quarter results would include an
as-yet-undetermined charge for restructuring.</p>
<p>SunTrust Banks gained 1/2 to 20 7/8 after outlining plans
for a pretax addition of about $65 million to loan-loss
reserves in the second quarter. The company said it doesn't
expect an examination by the comptroller of the currency,
which resulted in the charge, to have a "significant adverse
effect" on the period's earnings.</p>
<p>American Savings Bank, which suspended dividends on a
preferred-stock issue, fell 3/8 to 2 3/8. The company said it
expects a slowing economy and weakness in the commercial real
estate market in the Northeast to depress its second-quarter
results.</p>
<p>Bally Manufacturing was unchanged at 9 1/2. The company
extended until July 11 an offer to exchange common stock for
a $135 million issue of junk bonds; holders had tendered only
about $20 million of the issue as of Wednesday, the original
deadline.</p>
<p>The American Stock Exchange Market Value Index rose 1.52
to 358.57. Volume totaled 12,990,000 shares.</p>
<p>Energy Service dropped 1/4 to 4 1/4 in trading highlighted
by a block of 1.5 million shares, which changed hands at 4
1/8 during the afternoon. The trade accounted for most of the
1.7 million shares to change hands in composite dealings.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>Corrections & Amplifications</p>
<p>OLIN Corp. expects changes in its mix of businesses and
certain other factors to contribute to strong second-half
earnings that should result in full-year profit at the lower
end of the company's per-share target range of $6 to $6.40.
Friday's edition reported Olin's expectation that
second-quarter earnings would decline 15% to 20% from the
1989 period's record level, but didn't mention the outlook
for the second half and full year.</p>
