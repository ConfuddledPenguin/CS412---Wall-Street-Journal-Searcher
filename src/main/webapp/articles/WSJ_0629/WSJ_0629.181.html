million for its third quarter as a result of the falling
value of its real estate investments in New Jersey.
   VSB, a Closter, N.J., holding company for Valley Savings
Bank, said it plans to add $2.8 million to its loan-loss
reserves for the quarter ending tomorrow. VSB said $1.7
million of the addition will fully cover equity investments
in a townhouse development in central New Jersey and a
single-family home project in Morris County, N.J. The
projects represent the bank's largest real estate investment.</p>
