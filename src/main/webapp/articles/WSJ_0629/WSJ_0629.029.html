	<p class="article-leader">TOKYO -- For years, Lee Iacocca has been known as a Japan
basher, rapping the country for "slamming doors in our faces"
and lamenting its "almost parasitic" dependence on the U.S.
market.
   But now, the Chrysler Corp. chairman is inviting Japanese
consumers to share some of his wine.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Today, Mr. Iacocca starts marketing in Japan wine produced
by his vineyard in Italy, promoting it as the perfect
accompaniment to "the renowned cuisine of Japan." His two red
wines, costing $20 and $45 a bottle, respectively, have Mr.
Iacocca's autograph plastered across the label.</p>
<p>Can he be serious? Mr. Iacocca has just toured the U.S.
claiming that Chrysler cars stand up to the Japanese
competition. In his book "Talking Straight," he states: "I
hate to pick on the Japanese -- but they give me such great
material to work with, I just can't help myself]" And in a
recent Fortune article, for example, he charged that if Sony
Corp. Chairman Akio Morita "didn't know any more about
electronics than he does about fairness, he'd still be trying
to figure out how to put together a crystal radio set."
Despite such comments, Mr. Iacocca has recently been denying
that he is a Japan basher.</p>
<p>But Mr. Iacocca's wine venture is baffling many Japanese
consumers. "I thought he was like, `Hey you Japs,'" says
Tatsuo Kurata, a 41-year-old employee at a chemical-appliance
company, folding his hand into a fist. "I don't think I'll
buy."</p>
<p>"It's interesting how he can separate business from his
opinions like that," says 24-year-old Yosuke Kinoshita as he
looks over a stack of books on U.S.-Japan trade friction in a
Tokyo bookstore.</p>
<p>However, the Japanese importer of the wines hopes Mr.
Iacocca's controversial reputation will help sales. "To have
that Mr. Iacocca bowing his head to Japanese consumers" will
at least spur talk, says A. John Hamaguchi, director of
Hiroya Co.</p>
<p>Mr. Hamaguchi says he intends to market the wine to
department stores and Italian restaurants. In case anyone
fancies them for Japan's summer gift-giving season, wooden
boxes are available, with the Iacocca signature stamped on
the lid.</p>
<p>Japanese car makers, the main target of Mr. Iacocca's
attacks, are watching with amusement to see how it fares.
"Perhaps Mr. Iacocca will at last find out for himself that
doing business in Japan is not as difficult as he seems to
want to tell everyone it is," says a spokesman for Toyota
Motor Corp.</p>
