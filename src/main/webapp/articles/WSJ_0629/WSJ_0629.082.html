	<p class="article-leader">AMERICAN SAVINGS BANK said its board voted to suspend
payment of the quarterly cash dividend on its $1.8125
cumulative convertible preferred stock, normally declared in
June for payment on Aug. 1. The thrift, which posted a
first-quarter loss of $9.4 million, cited its poor operating
results and uncertainties in the real estate market. The
preferred dividend would have been $1.3 million. A
spokeswoman could not say under what conditions American
Savings might restore the dividend. In April, citing similar
factors, American Savings suspended payment of its quarterly
cash dividend on common stock. The unpaid preferred dividend
will accumulate as an obligation of the thrift without
interest. Under its charter and New York law, the preferred
dividends in arrears must be paid before any common stock
dividends.</p>
