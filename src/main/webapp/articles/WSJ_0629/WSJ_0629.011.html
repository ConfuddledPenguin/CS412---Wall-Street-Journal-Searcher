	<p class="article-leader">New York -- Mel Allen has been a broadcaster for 53 years,
but he is not beyond an occasional muff. "Time for this
queeks whiz," he intoned last week in the cool innards of a
Manhattan sound studio while taping his part for "This Week
in Baseball," a syndicated weekly highlights show.
   The control-room people, none of whom looked old enough to
remember Allen's glory days as the radio voice of the New
York Yankees, broke up in laughter. So did he. Mistakes in
taped TV shows are no big deal, because everything's done six
or eight times anyway, and Mel gets "this week's quiz" right
the next time. And the next. And the next.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"If that was radio, I'da heard about that mistake for a
month," the 77-year-old giggled later. "Guess there's
something to be said for television."</p>
<p>But then was better than now in other, more important
ways, continued the man of whom it was said "a florist must
have decorated his voice."</p>
<p>"I think just about every announcer who's done both radio
and television would say he preferred radio," declared Allen,
who is gray-haired and walks a bit stiff-legged, but whose
memorable baritone still resonates. "In television, the
directors don't like you talkin' about anything the people at
home can't see, but the camera only picks up a fraction of
what a flick of the eyes can cover.</p>
<p>"They talk about television puttin' you in the ballpark. A
good radio announcer can do that by pointing out the little
maneuvers and gestures that are such a big part of the game,
and the listeners can fill in the pictures themselves.
Baseball never had a better ally than peoples' imaginations
in the radio days. Heck, sometimes the games folks at home
saw in their minds'd be better than the ones on the field."</p>
<p>The games Melvin Allen Israel helped put in people's minds
mainly spanned the 1939-64 seasons, when he broadcast the
Yankees. If you lived in or around Gotham then, you called a
home run a "Ballantine blast" after the team's longtime beer
sponsor, like he did, and went around saying "How 'bout
that]" when DiMag, Yogi, Whitey or The Mick worked some of
their routine magic.</p>
<p>If you lived elsewhere, Allen's was the voice that brought
the World Series through the radio you smuggled into school
or work. He broadcast 20 of those nationally, plus 24
baseball All-Star Games. Chances are, no one will do more.</p>
<p>Most of that ended for Allen after the '64 season, when
the Yankees, ever-gracious, dumped him unceremoniously. He
returned in 1976 to cover the team's games on cable TV and
held that job through the 1988 season, but it wasn't quite
the same.</p>
<p>That last stint brought his play-by-play career into six
decades, and he extended it to seven by doing a game earlier
this season. When baseball inaugurated the Ford C. Frick
Award, conferring Hall of Fame status on broadcasters, he and
Walter "Red" Barber shared the first, in 1978.</p>
<p>Barber, an erudite Mississippian, was the Brooklyn
Dodgers' radio man in the 1940s and '50s, and later teamed
with the Alabama-born Allen on the Yanks, so for much of
three decades New York baseball had a Southern accent. Allen
writes that off to coincidence.</p>
<p>"I've heard it said that Southerners make the best
sportscasters because they're such good storytellers, but
that shouldn't apply to me. Back home in Alabama, I was
always too busy to sit around tellin' stories," he says. "I
graduated law school {from the U. of Alabama} and was set to
be a lawyer until somebody talked me into auditioning for CBS
Radio. I did news there, special events, lots of things. The
first baseball games I covered were the 1938 World Series. I
bet no other baseball announcer ever broke in like that.</p>
<p>"Barber was more of a Southerner than I was. He used
expressions like `rhubarb' for an argument, and `sittin' in
the catbird seat,' and he sounded more Southern," Allen
continues. "I always thought I spoke pretty good English; I
taught speech at Alabama for a while, you know. Give me
something to read and I'll read it clear as anyone. O'course,
when I'm just talkin', I drop my "g's" and all. I guess
broadcasting baseball is more like talkin' than reading a
speech."</p>
<p>Baseball being what it is, what you thought of Allen uring
those years probably depended on how you felt about the
Yankees. He was, in current parlance, something of a "homer,"
although he'll quibble about the term.</p>
<p>"There's a difference between partisanship and prejudice,
and while I naturally was partial to the Yankees I never
rooted for them openly the way other announcers did for their
teams," he contends. "I always reported the game honestly. If
a player on another team did something well, I'd give him
credit.</p>
<p>"I never could convince some people of that, though," he
muses. "I remember being in the Boston Red Sox clubhouse
before a game, talking to Bobby Doerr. Ted Williams came up
to me and said, `Thanks for making me look like a horse's ass
the other day.' I didn't know what he meant then, and I still
don't. I suppose he assumed that if you worked for one team
you were against all the others. But I never felt that way
about myself."</p>
<p>Allen says he listens to lots of sports on radio and TV
these days, and wishes the announcers wouldn't talk so much.
He acknowledges that he was faulted for volubility from time
to time, but maintains that the longer he broadcast baseball,
the more he allowed the game to speak for itself. "I'd try to
pick up every key play an instant before the crowd did, and
keep quiet while it reacted," he says. "I did some of my best
work with my mouth shut."</p>
<p>Allen says he injects this philosophy into "This Week in
Baseball," a show he's been doing for 13 years. "It's
scripted pretty tight, but they let me ad lib during the
action scenes," he says. "Mostly, I do it by cuttin' things
out. If you say, `Here's the throw] Safe]' there really isn't
much you can add, is there?"</p>
