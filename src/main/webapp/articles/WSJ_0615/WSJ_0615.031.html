	<p class="article-leader">CLEVELAND -- Mr. Coffee Inc. said a federal court in
Delaware denied an application by Farberware Inc., New York,
to enjoin Mr. Coffee from marketing a device that brews
coffee in a microwave oven.
   The court rejected a claim by Farberware that Mr. Coffee's
Quick Brew unit was too similar in appearance to Farberware's
MicroBrew coffeemaker. The court said there was no likelihood
that consumers would confuse the two products.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Mr. Coffee produces automatic coffeemakers and filters.
Farberware, a housewares producer, is a unit of Hanson PLC, a
British industrial concern.</p>
<p>Farberware said it will "aggressively pursue" other legal
remedies. The company said its product is "distinctive," with
a position in the market that Mr. Coffee is unfairly
attempting to infringe upon.</p>
