	<p class="article-leader">FOSTER CITY, Calif. -- Applied Biosystems Inc. said it
expects to report a "modest" pretax loss for its fourth
quarter ending June 30.
   It didn't specify the amount of the expected loss. The
scientific-instruments maker said orders and revenue both
have been below expectations. It said it is mulling
"additional measures" to cut costs, but didn't say what those
might be, either.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Applied Biosystems projected in January that it would have
"negative earnings" in its fiscal year, compared with last
fiscal year, when it earned $19.3 million, or $1.38 a share,
on sales of $158.1 million. Still, the news reflects further
tumult at the company.</p>
<p>The announcement came after the stock market had closed.</p>
<p>In national over-the-counter trading yesterday, Applied
Biosystems' stock fell 25 cents to close at $14.</p>
<p>That was modest compared with the 38% dive Applied
Biosystems' stock took in January, after the company reported
second-quarter net income swooned 56%. In March, the
company's president and chief executive officer, Irvin D.
Smith, was apparently forced to resign.</p>
<p>Applied Bioysytems has been hurt by various economic
factors, including the strength of the U.S. dollar, which has
hurt overseas sales. But the company's credibility has also
been hurt by management's earnings surprises for Wall Street;
the second-quarter profit plunge, for example, was reported
just two weeks after management had been telling analysts
that the company was performing well.</p>
<p>Last year in the fourth quarter, Applied Biosystems had
net income of $4.2 million, or 30 cents a share, on sales of
$36.8 million. For the nine months ended March 30, the
company had net income of $6.7 million, or 48 cents a share,
on sales of $120.2 million.</p>
