	<p class="article-leader">Contel Corp. said in Atlanta that it will offer about 900
employees an early-retirement package as part of a previously
reported reorganization. The company also said it expects the
total pretax cost of the reorganization to be $15 million to
$25 million, which will be recorded in the second half of
1990.
   The telecommunications concern said it will offer about
900 employees in its telephone operations sector a three-year
age and service credit as a retirement incentive. Contel said
about 14,000 employees are covered by the division's pension
plan.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The total reorganization plan calls for a total work force
cut of about 4%, largely through attrition and voluntary
departures. The amount of the second-half charge depends on
the actual size of the work force reduction, the company
said.</p>
