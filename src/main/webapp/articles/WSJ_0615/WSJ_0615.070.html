	<p class="article-leader">Despite increased efforts to educate children about AIDS,
many high-school students across the country still run a
significant risk of infection, according to a new report by
the Centers for Disease Control.
   The study, a compilation of reports from departments of
education in 30 states and 10 cities, found that many
high-school students use intravenous drugs and share needles.
Many students also say they have multiple sexual partners.
Both behaviors can result in transmission of the human
immunodeficiency virus, or HIV.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The findings, says Laura Kann in the CDC's division of
adolescent and school health, are particularly significant
because they show that the threat of infection among students
isn't limited to schools in cities with large AIDS
populations.</p>
<p>"We're not talking about students just in San Francisco or
New York City," Ms. Kann said. "It's across the nation."</p>
<p>Surprisingly, the study showed that most students are
aware that high-risk behaviors can lead to infection. Between
93% and 100% of respondents in various districts, for
instance, said they knew that AIDS or HIV infection can be
transmitted by sharing needles used to inject drugs.
Similarly, between 74% and 98% of respondents said they were
aware of the potential dangers of having sexual intercourse
without using a condom.</p>
<p>The problem, Ms. Kann said, is that knowledge about the
behavior "isn't sufficient to keep kids from practicing those
behaviors. We also need education programs that help kids
assert themselves in situations" that could lead to
transmission of the virus.</p>
<p>Thirty states, as well as the District of Columbia, now
require AIDS education for elementary or secondary schools,
according to the National Association of State Boards of
Education in Alexandria, Va. The requirements -- and
effectiveness -- of each program, however, vary widely from
state to state.</p>
<p>Sixteen states, for instance, require AIDS education to
begin sometime between kindergarten and the fifth grade, said
Katherine Fraser, program director of the association's AIDS
Education Project. But some states don't mandate any specific
grade level in which to begin instruction. Moreover, the
instruction itself may be something as broad as a single
assembly, Ms. Fraser said, or something as detailed as a
series of classes over an entire semester.</p>
<p>The CDC study points out, for instance, that significant
numbers of students still believe, incorrectly, that AIDS may
be transmitted by blood donations or through insect bites or
the use of public toilets.</p>
<p>"There's still a lack of understanding about how serious
this is," Ms. Fraser said. Echoing the CDC, she adds that
school districts in small towns sometimes tend to regard AIDS
as a problem limited to bigger cities, an attitude that
results in a "major barrier" to improved educational efforts.</p>
