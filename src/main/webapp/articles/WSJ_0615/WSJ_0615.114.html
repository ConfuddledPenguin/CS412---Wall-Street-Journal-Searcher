	<p class="article-leader">The corporate big leagues are using the same lure as pro
sports teams to woo promising stars: hefty signing bonuses.
   The $9 million guaranteed to Gerald Greenwald, who left
Chrysler Corp. as vice chairman last month to head a proposed
employee buy-out of UAL Corp., is the latest in lucrative
front-end pledges made to corporate heavy hitters who switch
teams.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>To win senior executives tied to their employers through
bigger stock-option and other long-term golden handcuffs,
suitors are finding it takes quite a golden key. "Most people
at the senior management level . . . are expecting to be
bought out," says Michael Halloran, head of the executive
compensation practice at consultants Towers Perrin, who calls
such bonuses "the golden hello."</p>
<p>Moreover, initial bonuses are no longer just for those at
the very top. As long-term compensation plans edge farther
down the corporate ladder, so also do recruitment bonuses.
"Sign-on bonuses are the counterattack to long-term
compensation plans," says Barbara Provus, a principal with
Sweeney Shepherd, recruiters in Chicago.</p>
<p>Signing bonuses aren't exactly new. Chrysler wooed and won
Lee Iacocca more than a decade ago with a deal that included
a $1.5 million front-end payment. But bonuses clearly are
becoming more prevalent. Gerard Roche, chairman of Heidrick &
Struggles recruiters in Chicago, says 60% of his top-level
searches involve a signing bonus these days. A search he just
completed included a $1.5 million bonus to the candidate.</p>
<p>Companies that offer signing bonuses run the risk of
creating dissension among managers who don't receive such
enticements. Even so, more companies believe such payments
are necessary at least partly to insulate executives from
risk. Mr. Greenwald is joining an employee buy-out that
hasn't happened yet -- and maybe never will. When Richard
Miller joined troubled Wang Laboratories Inc. as president
and chief executive officer last year, the company guaranteed
three years' salary and bonus totaling $1 million a year --
more than double that of his predecessor. He also received
stock options for two million Wang shares, a company
spokeswoman says.</p>
<p>But specialists say bonuses are structured mainly to
compensate executives for what they leave behind. Mr.
Miller's guarantee at Wang was relatively modest compared
with that of other executives coming into such circumstances,
one compensation consultant says. But Mr. Miller had left
General Electric Co. earlier when the unit he headed was
traded away, and thus had no big-company benefits as
bargaining leverage. Mr. Miller couldn't be reached for
comment.</p>
<p>More often, a company pays heavily to get a senior
executive. When RJR Nabisco Inc. hired Louis V. Gerstner as
chief executive last year, it gave him $14.6 million up front
to compensate for "accrued and expected" benefits he lost by
leaving the presidency of American Express Co., according to
RJR proxy statements. RJR also agreed to pay Mr. Gerstner
$446,374 a year in retirement benefits.</p>
<p>"There are so many things to buy out these days," says
Alan Johnson, managing director, compensation, for recruiters
Handy Associates in New York. In 1985, salary made up 45% of
a chief executive's compensation; last year, it was 39% and
dropping. The remainder comes from bonuses, stock benefits
and performance plans. There are also supplemental executive
retirement programs, health plans, cars and country club
memberships to consider.</p>
<p>Mr. Greenwald, who at Chrysler was in line to succeed Lee
Iacocca as chief executive, says at United he wanted "a
compensation package that would not cause me to look back. It
is a best effort at creating a compensation package that
would represent my expectations over the next five years at
Chrysler."</p>
<p>Mr. Greenwald had made a great deal of money at Chrysler
in the past -- including $11.6 million from exercising stock
options in 1985, 1986 and 1987 -- but there was no guarantee
he would do so again. According to Chrysler proxies, all the
stock options issued to him since 1986 were valueless when he
left Chrysler because of the company's falling stock price.</p>
<p>However, Mr. Greenwald says it isn't valid to calculate
the options in relation to current stock values because most
of them run for 10 years and no one can say what the stock
will be worth in the future.</p>
<p>Mr. Greenwald's package at United includes a $5 million
bonus for signing on with the buy-out group, according to
people familiar with his compensation. He will receive an
additional $4 million fee if the buy-out isn't completed; if
it is completed, his salary and other compensation will total
over $12 million in five years.</p>
<p>Increasingly, recruiters find that stars even further down
in a company are demanding to be bought out. "You can't
recruit people at any level of the organization if you can't
keep them whole," says Robert Salwen, a principal with
William M. Mercer Inc., consultants in New York.</p>
<p>Mr. Greenwald himself says he had to pay bonuses to
recruit subordinates at Chrysler. "You can't attract
outsiders and say, `By the way, we expect you to take a cut
from whatever you were paid,'" he says. "That just doesn't
make common sense."</p>
<p>Ms. Provus from Sweeney Shepherd recently found someone to
fill a $200,000-a-year general counsel position. "The
individual was walking away from several long-term incentive
plans, involving stock and cash. The only way we could get
him {was} to figure out the value, and put that on the
table."</p>
<p>The same applies even to much lower-paid positions, she
says. At a company such as Digital Equipment Corp., she says,
which has a generous stock program "even if the person is
only at $70,000 or $80,000 {in salary}, he or she might have
a couple hundred thousand dollars worth of stock they own
that's not vested. That's a summer home or a college
education. That's expensive for middle management to walk
away from." A Digital spokesman says such valuable stock
holdings for middle managers were more likely several years
back when the company's stock was trading at more than double
today's level.</p>
<p>Even at entry levels, more companies are mimicking law
firms and consulting firms, which long have offered signing
bonuses to attract new candidates. In a recent William M.
Mercer survey, 60% of hospitals said they either used bonuses
or planned to begin doing so. Mark Edwards, a principal at
consultants Sibson & Co., Princeton, N.J., says typical
sign-on bonuses for electrical engineers or programmers who
are in high demand might range from $2,000 to $15,000.</p>
<p>One motivation for using a bonus, rather than higher
salaries, is to avoid disrupting the rest of the
organization. "Sometimes you have someone who doesn't fit
into a salary level," says Jose Berrios, personnel director
at the media company Gannett Co. "If you go out and bring in
a person at a higher level . . . that really sets up an
equity problem," he says, noting that the company uses such
bonuses on "a case-by-case basis."</p>
<p>Recruiter Paul R. Ray Jr., president of Paul R. Ray Inc.,
Fort Worth, Texas, cites a candidate courted by a client
company. Because the manager was already making as much as
the highest-paid person at his level in the new company, it
offered an upfront payment of 25% of his first-year
compensation and promised gradual salary increases for the
future.</p>
<p>But sometimes, signing bonuses can create dissension.
Union officials at United try to play down Mr. Greenwald's
bonus, contending that talk of it may jeopardize the buy-out.
(United workers are being asked to take pay cuts as part of
the buyout.) At Apple Computer Inc., a $1.5 million signing
bonus for a new chief financial officer helped to fuel
employee discontent earlier this year.</p>
<p>One compensation consulting company that pays signing
bonuses to attract actuaries, who are in short supply,
declines to discuss the practice because of the risk of
alienating people who weren't offered bonuses. In the end,
however, such big bonuses are governed by the same thing that
governed big salary offers in the past: "Everything has to do
with how much they want the guy," says Mr. Johnson at Handy
Associates. "No one has a manual that says they have to do
it."</p>
