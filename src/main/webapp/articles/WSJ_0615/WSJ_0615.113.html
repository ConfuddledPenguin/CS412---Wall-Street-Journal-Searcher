	<p class="article-leader">Gold prices collapsed again, but central banks swooped
into the market with big buy orders and halted the decline.
   More Saudi Arabian sales prompted the initial drop in
London to around $340 an ounce from $351 the previous day. It
was Saudi sales that triggered two previous sharp sell-offs
this spring, including a $29-an-ounce plunge March 26.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>But with central banks' extensive purchases of gold
bullion reassuring the market, prices recouped some of their
losses yesterday. The London afternoon gold price was fixed
at $345.85, still its lowest since July 1986.</p>
<p>In New York, the soon-to-expire June gold contract ended
$5.20 an ounce lower at $346.80, only moderately above its
day's low of $346.00. August gold, the most active contract,
recovered from its low of $348.20 to end with a loss of $5.30
at $349.80.</p>
<p>The impact of the Saudi sales and prospects of sales by
the Soviet Union to raise hard currency have sent a wave of
pessimism through commodity markets generally, causing prices
to fall. One analyst, observing that the opening up of
Eastern Europe initially was viewed as stimulating demand for
commodities, said, "That may be true for the long term, but
now they're having a credit crunch."</p>
<p>One reason central banks intervened to support gold
yesterday may have been to relieve pressure on the Soviet
Union and South Africa, the world's biggest producers, said
Edwin Arnold, metals analyst at Merrill Lynch in London.</p>
<p>Both nations are undergoing major political adjustments
and can't afford a big price drop in one of their biggest
export products, he said. If gold plummeted, many high-cost
South African mines might be forced to close prematurely.
Moreover, both nations have deposited gold from their
monetary reserves as collateral for loans, according to Mr.
Arnold.</p>
<p>Because the credit was granted when gold was
higher-priced, this spring's slump has reduced the value of
the collateral and could discourage lenders from making
additional loans under the old terms, he said.</p>
<p>Another reason for the central banks' interest is simply
that they own a lot of gold. The Bank for International
Settlements says that since the end of last year, the value
of central banks' gold holdings has fallen by about $52
billion as the price has dropped.</p>
<p>Gold initially slumped yesterday when the National
Commercial Bank of Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, placed an order to
sell about 15 metric tons of the metal, London and Swiss
dealers said. A metric ton of gold is equal to 32,150 troy
ounces.</p>
<p>The disposal followed two large sales attributed to the
Saudi bank in March and May, which dealers said played a
major part in driving the London bullion price down more than
11% in the past 2 1/2 months.</p>
<p>The Saudi Arabian bank also has been creating frequent
consternation in the market by actively selling and buying
back gold, London bullion dealers said. Estimates of its
sales over the past 2 1/2 months range from 100 to 200 metric
tons.</p>
<p>Now that central banks have entered the market, bullion
dealers said, the reaction to any further Middle Eastern
sales probably will be more muted. They also said the amount
of gold sold yesterday was much smaller than on the previous
two occasions.</p>
<p>Dealers wouldn't identify the central banks involved, but
the Bank of England is known to enter the market from time to
time to prevent major price fluctuations, and central banks
in general are becoming more active in the market, dealers
say. The Bank for International Settlements estimates that
they sold 185 metric tons of bullion last year after buying
246 tons in 1988. Last year, Belgium, Mexico and Canada
reduced their monetary gold holdings, while Spain increased
its own.</p>
<p>Gregory Klochkoff, a vice president of Bank of Boston in
Providence, R.I., said strength in the long-term bond market
and in the stock market has drawn traders' funds away from
precious metals lately. Bond traders said intermediate-term
bonds also have been strong, with a negative effect on gold.</p>
<p>Dinsa Mehta, chief bullion trader at Chase Manhattan Bank,
New York, said gold is caught between the pressure of Middle
Eastern selling and what he called a "cap" on the market --
the fear that any strong price advance would induce the
Soviets to start selling.</p>
<p>"The Saudis have found a soft spot on the market, and
they're pushing it to their advantage," he said. "They are
continuing to push sales, and this is drawing other sellers
into the market."</p>
<p>One reason they may be doing it is to buy back the gold
later at a lower price, he said.</p>
<p>However, despite the overwhelming bearishness of the
market at the moment, gold's fundamentals are the best
they've been in four years, according to Mr. Mehta.</p>
<p>"When this heavy selling abates, the market could snap
back rather smartly," he said -- although the fear of Soviet
selling continues to hang over the market.</p>
<p>Jeffrey Nichols, president of American Precious Metals
Advisors in Toronto, pointed out that the latest sales
attributed to the Saudi bank weren't large.</p>
<p>However, he said, "this market is so spooked and paranoid
about further sales from the Middle East that even the
slightest sign of selling from that direction causes buying
to dry up and makes the market become vulnerable to large
price moves on small volume."</p>
<p>Mr. Nichols agreed that gold could rebound if the pressure
is lifted, and he said he doesn't see Soviet selling as a big
problem.</p>
<p>"The Soviet Union needs to husband its reserves for the
collateralization of bank credits and to eventually support a
freely tradable currency," he said.</p>
<p>He also said that although the Soviets have sold gold,
they've also been buying it in the forward market for future
delivery, so weakness in gold can't really be attributed to
Moscow.</p>
<p>Silver for July delivery on the Commodity Exchange in New
York fell 14.8 cents an ounce to $4.7850. July platinum ended
with a loss of $4.70 an ounce at $476.50 after recovering
from a low of $471.50.</p>
<p>In other commodity markets yesterday:</p>
<p>ENERGY: Crude and heating oil futures prices took a tumble
on the New York Mercantile Exchange in some cases wiping out
more than half of this week's gains. Traders found it
difficult to account for the drop, but some said a major
market participant began selling aggressively halfway through
the session. Nymex crude for July delivery finished at $17.13
a barrel. The August contract lost 35 cents a barrel, and
later months were mixed. Heating oil was pulled lower by
crude's decline. Gasoline continued its strong showing,
primarily on reports of a problem at an Exxon Corp. refinery
in Louisiana and continued strong demand on the U.S. West
Coast. Unleaded gasoline for July delivery rose 1.27 cents a
gallon to end at 60.12 cents.</p>
<p>LIVESTOCK and MEATS: Prices of pork belly and live hog
futures for July delivery fell their daily limits of two
cents a pound and 1.5 cents a pound, respectively, on growing
concern that demand for pork is dropping. Retail pork prices
are near record highs, analysts said, while wholesale beef
prices are declining. "There's a feeling that there's some
shifting going on by retailers, featuring less pork and more
beef and chicken," said Thomas Morgan, president of Sterling
Research Corp., Arlington Heights, Ill. In addition, Mr.
Morgan said, the aggregate wholesale meat price for pork has
declined on each of the past five business days, reflecting
reduced demand for pork. Pork belly futures for July delivery
settled at 68.45 cents a pound yesterday, while the July live
hog contract finished at 60.80 cents a pound.</p>
<p>COFFEE: Futures prices fell on a government report that
projected higher world production. The July delivery declined
4.65 cents a pound to 87.10 cents. The U.S. Department of
Agriculture, in an estimate of the 1990-91 world crop for the
season beginning Oct. 1, said global output of coffee would
amount to 101.7 million bags of 132 pounds each, compared
with 92.6 million bags in the current season. The report
placed Brazilian output for the 1990-91 season at 33 million
bags, compared with 26 million in the current season.
According to Sandra Kaul, analyst for Shearson Lehman Hutton
Inc., New York, the recent strength in coffee has been based
on the belief that supplies of higher-quality coffee would be
tight in the coming season. These producers' inventories have
been sharply drawn down by record shipments during a year of
free market trading, she said. "Now, it appears that these
countries will have more coffee than had been expected next
season, and with the prospect that the market will remain
without quotas, heavy sales could drive down prices," Ms.
Kaul said.</p>
