	<p class="article-leader">THE JUSTICES RULED police may set up roadblocks to catch
drunken drivers.
   The Supreme Court, by a 6-3 vote, said checkpoints in
which police stop every car don't violate the Fourth
Amendment's protection against "unreasonable searches and
seizures." In an opinion written by Chief Justice Rehnquist,
the court upheld a Michigan checkpoint set up in 1986. While
use of checkpoints has become widespread, dissenting justices
said there isn't any evidence to show that checkpoints are
more effective than using police manpower for traffic
patrols.</p>

state officials under federal law to force them to give
adequate Medicaid reimbursements.</p>

<p>ROMANIA'S ILIESCU MOBILIZED thousands of miners to put
down protests.</p>
<p>Responding to two days of violence in which his security
forces clashed with anti-Communist demonstrators in
Bucharest, the president-elect summoned the miners, who
streamed into the capital to club people and ransack
opposition party offices. Few police and soldiers were
visible in the city, and the miners were apparently left to
maintain order. Health Ministry officials said five people
were killed and 277 injured in this week's violence. State TV
said the nation's interior minister had been replaced.</p>
<p>The Bush administration condemned "in the strongest
possible terms" what it described as "the government-inspired
vigilante violence" in Romania.</p>

<p>The Soviet parliament ordered a two-month delay for a
proposed threefold increase in bread prices, a centerpiece of
Gorbachev's plan to overhaul the economy and transform it
into a market system. Legislators voted 319-33 to have the
government produce another version of the plan.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>The Senate sent to the White House landmark legislation
guaranteeing workers as much as 12 weeks annual unpaid leave
for childbirth, adoption or family illnesses. The action sets
the stage for a potential veto confrontation with the
administration, which is allied with business interests
opposed to the legislation.</p>

<p>Louisiana's House passed the nation's harshest
anti-abortion bill, providing up to 10 years hard labor and
fines of up to $100,000 for doctors who perform abortions.
The bill, which would not penalize women who receive
abortions, passed on a 73-27 vote and moved to the state
Senate.</p>

<p>Colombian police killed the purported mastermind of a
Medellin cocaine ring's 10-month-old war against the
government, authorities said. A car bomb later went off near
a police post in the Bogota suburb where the leader of the
cocaine ring was slain. A radio report said the bomb killed
at least two people and injured 20.</p>

<p>The Soviet defense minister said the Kremlin could agree
to a united Germany only if it joined a European security
system replacing NATO and the Warsaw Pact. His remarks seemed
to backpedal from prior Soviet comments that didn't dispute
Germans' right to unification, only to which group Germany
should belong.</p>

<p>The FAA disclosed plans to order installation of
more-sensitive airport X-ray machines and metal detectors
that could reduce the threat of terrorist air attacks.
Meanwhile, the Transportation Department said it created an
Office of Intelligence and Security to develop aviation and
maritime security policy.</p>

<p>As many as 60 boats attacked a spreading oil slick from
the burning supertanker Mega Borg in the Gulf of Mexico.
Officials in Galveston, Texas, estimated that the slick from
the leaking vessel was 30 miles long and as much as 10 miles
wide and said they couldn't determine where or when the oil
might begin washing ashore.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>Thousands of protesters marched through Monrovia, chanting
"Stop the killings" and urging the U.S. to help end Liberia's
5 1/2-month tribal war. The Liberian Council of Churches
asked the U.S. to send a peacekeeping force to the African
nation. Talks between the government and rebels showed little
sign of progress in Sierra Leone.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>Bush and Thai Premier Chatichai vowed to work together to
fight narcotics and bring peace to war-ravaged Cambodia
through "free and fair elections" under the U.N.'s auspices.
The two leaders also discussed investment and trade issues
during their meetings at the White House.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>Sri Lanka rushed troop reinforcements to besieged
northeastern areas, where about 800 policemen have been
seized by Tamil guerrillas in a four-day offensive. The
government said it was willing to negotiate an end to the
conflict, in which more than 200 people have been killed
since Monday.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>The State Department said widespread intimidation of
voters may have plagued last Sunday's balloting in Bulgaria's
parliamentary elections. The party of former Communists won
the opening round, with a runoff election scheduled this
Sunday.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>Central American presidents gathered in Guatemala to
discuss creating a regional common market to boost their
economies, which are emerging from years of political
conflict. Secretary of State Baker will arrive Sunday night
to attend the final day of the meeting, where he is expected
to be queried on dwindling U.S. aid to the region.</p>

<p>A bomb exploded outside a Peruvian army barracks, killing
two soldiers and a civilian. Separately, police said Maoist
Shining Path guerrillas had murdered 20 peasants earlier in
the week. The blast was the second fatal car bombing in
Peru's Andean highlands since Alberto Fujimori won
presidential elections last Sunday.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>Israeli workers participated in a one-day strike. Labor
leaders termed the walkout a success, announcing that a total
of 800,000 people stayed away from their jobs. The Histadrut
trade federation organized the work stoppage to demand higher
pay and measures to curb unemployment.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>The Netherlands launched a multi-billiondollar
anti-pollution plan a year after a similar effort brought
down the government. The plan, devised by the center-left
leadership that took office last November, aims to double
annual spending on the environment to $8.4 billion annually
by 1994.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>Britain said Hong Kong will have to forcibly return to
Vietnam more boat people unless the U.S. agrees to house
about 9,000 of the refugees on the island of Guam.</p>
