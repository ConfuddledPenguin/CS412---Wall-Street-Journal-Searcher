	<p class="article-leader">Orix Corp. said it won the rights to buy 74 A-320 Airbus
Industrie planes that Braniff Inc. had on order and option,
marking the first time a Japanese company will buy aircraft
strictly for lease.
   Attorneys for Tokyo-based Orix, a huge financial-services
concern, said the company won the rights to the planes in an
auction held in federal bankruptcy court in Orlando, Fla.
They said Orix will pay Braniff $62 million, of which Braniff
owes Airbus $14.2 million for past debts. The transaction
covers firm orders for 24 aircraft and options to purchase 50
additional planes, all for delivery by the year 2000. If all
options are exercised, the total purchase price will be well
in excess of $3 billion.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Last fall, Braniff filed for protection from creditors
under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. The auction was
part of the defunct airline's liquidation.</p>
<p>For the aircraft-leasing industry, the Orix acquisition --
and the prospect of future deals by other Japanese companies
-- could spell more competitive times ahead, say industry
analysts and executives. In recent years, as air travel has
expanded and demand for planes grown, fortunes have soared
for aircraft-leasing companies such as GPA Group Ltd. of
Ireland and Los Angeles-based International Lease Finance
Corp.</p>
<p>But until now, no major Japanese company has owned planes
for lease, though several Japanese financial institutions
have been major players in other types of aircraft financing.</p>
<p>"This is a huge step for Orix," said David Gebler,
president of United States Airlease, a unit of Ford Motor
Co.'s U.S. Leasing subsidiary. "This is the next step in a
developing trend, whereby Japanese institutions have seen the
huge financing demand of the airline industry."</p>
<p>Leasing planes, versus financing them through conventional
borrowing, is popular among some airlines because of tax and
other accounting reasons.</p>
<p>Neil Mitchell, an attorney for Orix with the New York firm
Breed, Abbott & Morgan, said the company intends to acquire
more aircraft for lease in the future, "to become another
GPA." He said Orix has helped finance some 191 aircraft
acquisitions for airlines around the world, but "they're
using this to make an entry into the operating lease area."</p>
<p>In its year ended March 31, Orix had net income of $124.6
million, more than double year-earlier net of $52.9 million.
Revenue rose to $2.04 billion from $767.9 million.</p>
<p>It is unclear whether Orix already has leases lined up for
its planes. Mr. Gebler said he expects Orix to compete in the
lucrative but risky shorter-term lease segment, the market
for leases of five to 10 years and the stronghold of GPA and
International Lease Finance. In that segment, aircraft owners
expect to lease planes to several customers over the life of
the aircraft, compared with the longer-term lease market,
which is less risky but not as profitable.</p>
<p>Mark Daugherty, an airline analyst with Dean Witter
Reynolds, said Orix and other Japanese companies could have
advantages over U.S. leasing competitors because of their
lower cost of capital.</p>
<p>"They're late coming into the business," he said, "but
they may offer very attractive rates in order to get
started."</p>
