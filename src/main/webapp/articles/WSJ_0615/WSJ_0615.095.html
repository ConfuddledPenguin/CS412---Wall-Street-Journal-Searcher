	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- The Supreme Court ruled that hospitals and
nursing homes may sue state officials under federal law to
force them to provide adequate reimbursement for Medicaid
services, a decision that will drive up federal and state
spending on health care for the poor.
   The 5-4 opinion, written by Justice William Brennan, is
certain to force many states to boost their payments to
hospitals and nursing-home services under the joint
state-federal Medicaid program. The ruling, in a case brought
by the Virginia Hospital Association, comes at a time when
hospitals around the country are complaining that states,
fighting to curb rising health costs, have set reimbursement
rates so low that providers lose money on Medicaid patients.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"The decision is certainly good news for hospitals," said
Walter Dellinger, the Duke Law School professor who argued
the case for the hospital association. But he also asserted
that the decision "should greatly benefit the poor," who have
"experienced increasing difficulty in obtaining access to
medical care" in the face of Medicaid funding limits.</p>
<p>Laurens Sartoris, president of the Virginia Hospital
Association, said that current reimbursement rates cover only
71% of the cost of care his members provide under Medicaid.
To cover the loss, he said many hospitals try to boost the
rates they charge private patients whose bills generally are
paid by corporate health plans. The decision will help
business by reducing the need for such cost-shifting, he
said.</p>
<p>But the decision will make it harder for government, both
federal and state, to hold down Medicaid spending. Washington
currently spends about $40 billion a year on Medicaid, while
states, which share the costs, spend about $30 billion. The
program helps two groups -- women and children and elderly
nursing-home patients.</p>
<p>In its brief to the court, the Bush administration warned
that a ruling in favor of the Virginia hospitals "would
vastly increase the cost of the Medicaid program to the
detriment of both state and federal governments." The federal
government pays more than half of the cost of the 25-year-old
Medicaid program and sets broad coverage requirements, but
the states set their own reimbursement rates.</p>
<p>The legal question in the case focused on the meaning of a
1980 federal law that requires states to certify that their
Medicaid reimbursement rates are "reasonable and adequate"
for efficient medical care.</p>
<p>The 1980 law doesn't expressly say that it may be enforced
through private lawsuits by Medicaid providers. But the high
court ruled that the 1980 law gives Medicaid health-care
providers a right to sue state officials under a
Reconstruction-era civil rights law to force them to adopt
reasonable reimbursement plans.</p>
<p>The ruling affirmed the decision of a federal appeals
court in Richmond, Va. The court's decision will give
providers the right to seek higher rates in the future, but
it doesn't allow them to seek repayment for past losses. The
Virginia Hospital Association has won the right to sue, but
it still must prove that the state's reimbursements are too
low. The trial on the merits of the association's case is
scheduled to start Dec. 17.</p>
<p>Chief Justice William Rehnquist dissented, joined by
Justices Sandra O'Connor, Antonin Scalia and Anthony Kennedy.
The dissenters said the majority disregarded the language of
the 1980 amendment, as well as the intent of Congress to give
states more flexibility in setting up reimbursement plans.</p>
<p>The ability to sue "isn't going to mean any automatic
windfall" for hospitals, said John Goetz, vice president and
supervisor of health-care ratings at Moody's Investors
Service Inc., because litigation and rate adjustments could
take a long time. Urban hospitals will benefit the most from
changes. At a hospital with a top credit rating, Medicaid
reimbursement accounts for about 8% of revenue. But some
inner-city institutions serving particularly poor areas,
depend on Medicaid for well over half their revenue, he said.</p>
<p>Hospitals in several states, including Michigan and
Pennsylvania, have already won federal district court
decisions requiring new reimbursement rates.</p>
<p>Yesterday's high court decision "should give pause to many
state agencies who are looking at ways of modifying their
payment systems to underpay the hospitals," said Kenneth E.
Raske, president of the Greater New York Hospital
Association.</p>
<p>Mr. Raske suggested that instead of reducing
reimbursement, Medicaid agencies develop cost-control
strategies, such as incentives to encourage Medicaid
beneficiaries to use health maintenance organizations.
