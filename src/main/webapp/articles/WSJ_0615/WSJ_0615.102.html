	<p class="article-leader">RIO DE JANEIRO (AP) -- Brazil's top debt negotiator said
the government cannot pay all the interest on its foreign
debt this year because of a lack of foreign currency
reserves, a major newspaper reported.
   Chief negotiator Jorio Dauster said Brazil would be able
to pay only about $5 billion of the $15 billion in interest
owed to private foreign banks in 1990 without using up its
foreign reserves, the Rio daily Jornal do Brasil reported.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"Everyone knows Brazil doesn't have the kind of money to
pay this interest," the negotiator told the newspaper.</p>
<p>Brazil hasn't paid interest to private creditors on its
foreign debt since September and now is $5.6 billion in
arrears, although it has kept up interest payments to
European government lenders.</p>
<p>The suspension of interest payments is intended to keep
Brazil's foreign reserves from falling below $6 billion, the
equivalent of six months of imports. Foreign reserves stand
at about $7 billion, according to the central bank.</p>
<p>The negotiator said the government first wanted to
negotiate a standby pact with the International Monetary Fund
for a $2 billion bridge loan before resuming talks on back
interest payments.</p>
<p>An agreement with the IMF is considered crucial to
Brazil's plans to renegotiate its $114 billion foreign debt,
the Third World's largest.</p>
