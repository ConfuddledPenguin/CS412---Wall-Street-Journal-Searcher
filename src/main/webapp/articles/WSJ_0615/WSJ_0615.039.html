	<p class="article-leader">MOSCOW -- It's best not to tinker with the soul of Russia,
as the Soviet government is finding out.
   The Supreme Soviet, the Soviet parliament, overwhelmingly
rejected government plans to raise bread prices July 1,
postponing discussion of the matter until September. In doing
so, it extended a long list of genuflections to bread as a
symbol in Russian life.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Bread has been called the father of Russia, the soul of
Russia, the thing without which life means nothing. When a
valued guest visits a Soviet home, he is offered bread and
salt as a traditional welcome. Some schools hold special
"Bread Cult" evenings to introduce children to the history
and cultural significance of bread.</p>
<p>"We teach that we were very rich, and there was beautiful
delicious bread, fresh every day," says a former Moscow
schoolteacher. "It was meant to be a description of the whole
Russian character."</p>
<p>Leningrad has a Bread Museum, and every citizen well knows
that in the 900-day siege of Leningrad during World War II,
Leningraders were rationed to 100 grams of bread a day, and
the bread was made of flour and sawdust. Even the Bolsheviks
invoked bread in their rallying cry for the revolution:
"Land, bread and peace."</p>
<p>As a result, the price of bread has hardly risen in the
70-plus years since then. The last price rise was in 1962. At
a Moscow bakery today, a long white loaf sells for about 20
kopeks (32 cents at the official exchange rate) and a dark
round for 10 kopeks.</p>
<p>The government says it's high time to change. President
Mikhail Gorbachev complains that bread is so inexpensive
children play football with it. But when Prime Minister
Nikolai Ryzhkov last month proposed tripling bread prices as
part of his economic reform program, it caused a storm of
criticism.</p>
<p>Opposition to the program within the Parliament was
particularly strong from the Central Asian regions, where
grain makes up a large proportion of the diet. And in the
breadbaskets of the Soviet Union -- the Ukraine and
Byelorussia -- local Parliaments said they would refuse to
comply with the price increase.</p>
<p>But the average shopper seems to have accepted reality
over myth more quickly than the average Parliament member.
"Bread must be taken care of, but it doesn't matter if they
increase the price several times because it's way too cheap,"
said Nina, a middle-aged shopper at the largest bakery in
Moscow, where the walls are decorated with posters
proclaiming, "Bread is Precious."</p>
<p>By subsidizing the bread price, the government had worked
itself into its present conundrum. Although farmers grow far
more food grain than fodder, the Soviet Union in 1989
imported 36 million tons of grain to fill about 40% of their
needs. Bread is so cheap that farmers feed it to their pigs.</p>
<p>The government raised wholesale prices for grain in April
as a production incentive to try to reduce the dependence on
imports. They assumed that it would be able to offset some of
the cost by raising retail prices. Now, says Deputy Prime
Minister Leonid Abalkin, the government will have to pay out
an extra nine billion rubles this year to make up the
shortfall. A ruble is worth $1.67 at the official exchange
rate, but only a fraction of that in the black market.</p>
<p>The vote to postpone discussion of bread price increases
until September may only add to public frustration. "At least
if the price goes up, maybe the quality will be better," says
Larisa Vesuchkina, as she prods loaves on a bakery shop's
shelves with the customary small metal spatula. "These days
it only lasts a day or two and we have to throw it out."</p>
