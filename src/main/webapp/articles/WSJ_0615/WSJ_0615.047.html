	<p class="article-leader">AID FOR MOSCOW could spark a U.S.-German debate at the
economic summit.
   Though it wasn't made public, Gorbachev "in general terms"
raised the subject of Western help for his beleaguered
economy during his meeting with Bush. The U.S. now is willing
to discuss the issue in Houston. But Germany, fearing
possible Soviet economic chaos that could impede its
unification, plans to press for quick, major action, which
the U.S. will oppose.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The Soviets mostly want access to commercial credit
markets, not grants or government credits. But the U.S. says
Lithuania and emigration must first be resolved, and a better
economic plan adopted. Gorbachev would probably use new
capital for consumer goods to defuse public resentment; in
addition, he is thought to be seeking German meat and dairy
products to ease the transition to a market economy.</p>
<p>One possible summit outcome: having the Group of 24
industrial countries, which is aiding Eastern Europe, study
Soviet needs and report back later.</p>
<p>SUNUNU SOLIDIFIES his hold on Republican political
operations.</p>
<p>Recent White House personnel moves and GOP Chairman Lee
Atwater's battle against a brain tumor increase the chief of
staff's already wide sway. With White House political
director James Wray's departure to party headquarters, his
responsibilities have been largely assumed by close Sununu
aides Edward Rogers and David Carney.</p>
<p>Some Republicans grumble that Sununu is spread too thin to
devote adequate attention to political needs in the way
Atwater would. California Republicans blame lack of support
for the defeat of two GOP-sponsored initiatives designed to
prevent Democratic gerrymandering. But Republican National
Committee officials say the Californians bungled the effort.</p>
<p>THE U.S. SEEKS avenues to influence Israel's new hard-line
government.</p>
<p>While Baker publicly bashes Shamir, some analysts see new
Foreign Minister Levy as a possible key to improving
relations. They believe he sees his post as a stepping stone
to replace Shamir as prime minister, and thus knows he can't
preside over a big rupture in U.S.-Israel relations.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, several House Foreign Affairs members privately
cheer Baker's tough remarks; some members of the unofficial
"Jewish Caucus" may visit Jerusalem soon to warn of growing
U.S. anger. A big, early test of the relationship will be
negotiations over $400 million in congressionally approved
housing loan guarantees for resettling Soviet Jews.</p>
<p>The administration wants assurances the money won't be
used to put the immigrants in the occupied territories.</p>
<p>MOVEMENT OF LABOR looms as a major issue in the
soon-to-be-negotiated U.S.-Mexico free-trade pact. Mexico's
Salinas sees it as a key aspect, but U.S. trade
representative Hills says it is an issue of immigration, not
trade. And allowing in more Mexican workers would surely stir
fierce opposition from U.S. organized labor.</p>
<p>DOLE BRIDLES after a White House aide is quoted as saying
Bush "is not going to demagogue" the flag issue because
"that's what he's got Dole for." The Senate GOP leader shoots
back that "that's not my role," though he continues to hammer
away at the issue.</p>
<p>OREGON'S BID for federal permission to launch a novel
health plan for the poor triggers debate -- and attention.
The state wants to limit Medicaid services while expanding
basic care to many people currently outside the system.
Opponents charge the plan will gut the program, but Rep.
Wyden predicts that "if it works, every governor in the
country will be interested."</p>
<p>UNIONS SEE an opening in the wake of the Eastern Airlines
and Greyhound strikes for a new law next year barring
employers from permanently replacing strikers with new
workers. Teamsters chief McCarthy says his union's huge PAC
won't give money to candidates who don't support the bill.</p>
<p>HOPE GROWS among Democrats for governorships and the GOP
for the Senate.</p>
<p>Among big-state, currently Republican-held statehouses,
Democrats are in a strong position to retake Florida, are
even in California and are within striking distance in
Illinois and Texas; among currently Democratic states, only
Ohio veers toward the GOP. In smaller states, Republicans in
both Maine and Rhode Island are in jeopardy.</p>
<p>In the Senate, analyst Charles Cook says three of the four
likeliest turnovers would be Democratic losses -- Hawaii,
Iowa and Rhode Island. Kentucky is the Democrats' best shot
at ousting a Republican, though they trail. Democratic
pollster Celinda Lake says her party's gubernatorial crop is
stronger than its Senate crop because "Democrats are still
more activist, and if you want to do something you run for
governor."</p>
<p>But Republican theorist Kevin Phillips thinks his party's
Senate prospects are exaggerated, attributing it to deft "GOP
spin control."</p>
<p>MINOR MEMOS: New York GOP gubernatorial candidate Pierre
Rinfret, inviting a young female TV reporter to attend his
inauguration after he defeats Cuomo, adds: "Don't bring your
husband." . . . The House Ways and Means Committee is
preparing a list of tax simplification proposals that is
1,300 pages long. . . . The Plaintiff Employment Lawyers
Association's list of key senators to lobby includes "Sam
Nun," "Jim Sacher," "Al Heflin" and "Pete Domenicei."</p>
