	<p class="article-leader">When it comes to investment scams, it's fear, not greed,
that gets most people into trouble.
   Take Mary Lou Butler, a 59-year-old Phoenix, Ariz., woman,
who says she was worried about her financial security. "I was
looking for a financial planner who could take the insurance
money -- $130,000 -- I got when my husband died, and invest
it for a monthly income," she says.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The "planner" she found was Dwight Edward Depottey, who
said he would put the money into a "low-risk" investment.
Instead, Mr. Depottey used at least part of it for his own
business and personal benefit, says Margaret Ellis, an
investigator with the securities division of the Arizona
Corporation Commission.</p>
<p>Last month, Mr. Depottey pleaded guilty to one count of
"conspiracy to commit fraudulent schemes" and no-contest to
one count of theft following an indictment charging that he
defrauded dozens of investors. Most of his victims lost
everything they had invested, says Ms. Ellis. Mr. Depottey is
scheduled for sentencing in state superior court in Phoenix
next Tuesday. His attorney, Leonard G. Brown, had no comment.</p>
<p>State securities regulators and others say a growing
number of crooks are exploiting individuals' worries about
their financial futures to sell bogus investments and
worthless counseling.</p>
<p>"They're going after people who are saving for retirement
and their kids' education," says Rep. Rick Boucher, who has
introduced a bill calling for stricter regulation of the
financial planning industry. "These aren't people who want to
do high-risk securities," says the Virginia Democrat,
"they're people who have $400 a month they want to put away."</p>
<p>A poll released yesterday by the International Association
for Financial Planning, a trade group, shows that most
Americans are "overwhelmingly pessimistic" about their
personal finances: 86% said that college costs have risen
beyond the reach of most families, and 66% said there is less
chance for retirees to be self-sufficient in the coming
decade.</p>
<p>Those are the kinds of worries that lead people to turn to
a financial planner. But instead of legitimate professionals,
many individuals end up putting themselves in the hands of
charlatans.</p>
<p>"They present all these statistics about what it's going
to cost for education and retirement, then sell you
anything," says Rep. Boucher.</p>
<p>"Yes, there are certainly frauds out there," says Robert
A. Hewitt, chairman of the IAFP. But "in spite of some of the
sensational headlines, most fraud and abuse was perpetrated
not by financial planners, but by frauds posing as financial
planners."</p>
<p>Securities regulators say they're noticing an increase in
the number of specifically targeted pitches.</p>
<p>Gerald Lewis, Florida's comptroller, says he has always
seen plenty of scams that target retirees. But lately, he
says, more and more schemes are tied to college investments.</p>
<p>"I see ads that say things like, `How to Prepare for Your
Children's Education.' Just because you see an ad like that
doesn't mean something is wrong, but we're seeing evidence
that people are being victimized by those types of comeons,"
Mr. Lewis says.</p>
<p>Missouri Commissioner of Securities John Perkins says that
law-enforcement people in his state headed off a
college-investment scheme last year when they arrested Robert
J. Recklein, an unregistered financial planner who was later
sentenced to 15 years for securities violations connected
with the sale of phony promissory notes to people who sought
his financial advice.</p>
<p>When they searched Mr. Recklein's office, regulators found
what they believe is a marketing plan they say he was
intending to use to sell phony college investments. Among
those listed in the plan as "targets" were grandparents of
newborns, who "often give generously," and parents who "have
repaid their own college loans."</p>
<p>The plan's "strategy" called for "establishing Robert J.
Recklein as a knowledgeable, inventive and dependable
leader," according to the papers found in his office. It
included procedures that any marketing plan might employ,
including participating in radio talk shows, sending mailings
to day-care centers and to senior citizens.</p>
<p>Mr. Recklein's lawyer, Dale Myers, says that his client's
investments were "nothing more than Ponzi operations," and
that his client could have been sentenced to only two years,
except that "he stole additional money from investors" while
he was out on bail. As for his client's plan to sell college
investments modeled as prepaid tuition plans, he says Mr.
Recklein got the idea from reading about a legitimate program
run by the state of Michigan.</p>
<p>"Crooks use the same marketing and sales techniques that
the legitimate financial planning professionals use, which is
why they're so camouflaged," says Scott Stapf of the North
American Securities Administrators Association.</p>
<p>"Crooked planners will work through community
organizations, unions and church groups, and will make
presentations. Afterwards, they get lists of members and move
in with sales pitches," says Mr. Stapf. "It's a very
effective way to set up people, because they trust the
planner, and feel guilty about having gotten the `free
advice.'"</p>
<p>For example, in Barrington, Ill., radio ads touted a
series of "no-cost, no-obligation financial planning
seminars" to help people plan for and save for retirement.
One script read: ". . . We have never seen people so
bewildered and confused, especially persons who would like to
plan retirement, as well as those already retired. The
horrors of Wall Street, the scary bond market, fluctuating
interest rates, they are all reasons for concern."</p>
<p>People who attended the classes were then invited to
participate in a personal financial planning consultation,
where many were sold limited partnerships purportedly earning
"guaranteed" annual interest of 10% to 15%. The two men
involved, Earl Dean Gordon and Kenneth F. Boula,
"acknowledged that they participated in conduct that
ultimately involved $5 million in funds obtained from
investors in real estate limited partnerships where
misrepresentations were made to investors," says their
attorney, David Stetler.</p>
<p>Both pleaded guilty in federal court to mail-fraud
charges, and are scheduled to be sentenced today in U.S.
district court in Chicago.</p>
<p>Law-enforcement officials and securities regulators say
many people are lulled into thinking fraud can't happen to
them because they aren't the stereotypically "greedy"
investor. But, says Susan Bryant, the Oklahoma commissioner
of securities: "This is not based on (investor) greed, and
that's one of the reasons this is frightening."</p>

<p>           How To Get Help Spotting a Crook</p>
<p>Investors can reduce their chances of falling prey to a
charlatan by checking the backgrounds of financial planners
and other investment professionals with their state's
securities office. Find out who to call by phoning the North
American Securities Administrators Association in Washington
(202-737-0900).</p>
<p>Here's what to ask:</p>
<p>-- Is planner registered to sell investments in your
state, and, if so, what investments?</p>
<p>-- Does the planner have a record of disciplinary actions
taken by state securities agencies, the Securities and
Exchange Commission or self-regulatory organizations such as
the National Association of Securities Dealers?</p>
<p>-- Has the planner been sued by clients, and, if so, what
did the complaints allege and what was the outcome?</p>
<p>-- Has the planner filed for bankruptcy, or been
prosecuted for a money crime?</p>
<p>-- Does the planner have the educational background and
work history he or she claims?</p>
