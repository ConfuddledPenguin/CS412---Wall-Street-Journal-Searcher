	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady, saying
that a further $30 billion to $50 billion will be needed for
the thrift bailout next year, encountered escalating
criticism from Democrats who think the Bush administration is
mishandling the cleanup.
   Mr. Brady, who recently estimated that the cost of the
bailout -- excluding interest -- probably will more than
double to over $130 billion, also said that without new cash,
the bailout effort will be out of money by the end of this
year. He didn't say how much additional funding will be
needed in the October-December quarter.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Depressed real estate markets, higher interest rates,
thrifts' losses in the junk-bond market and a tepid response
from potential buyers of sick thrifts all have contributed to
the higher costs, Mr. Brady said. "Let's face it, and get on
with the job," he urged the committee.</p>
<p>But Democrats took the occasion to draw a distinction
between how the thrift crisis developed, for which both
parties appear culpable, and the halting progress in carrying
out the massive thrift law, for which the lawmakers held the
administration responsible. Their comments were the latest
Democratic effort to capitalize on a growing problem for
President Bush.</p>
<p>"There's a second S&L crisis that started Aug. 9," when
the law passed, said Rep. Charles Schumer (D., N.Y.). "We
have heard more from the president about broccoli than we
have heard about this crisis." Rep. Richard Neal (D., Mass.)
said: "We are sitting on a volcano of public opinion on this
issue."</p>
<p>Members admonished the administration for its original,
low cost estimates, saying that interest-rate projections
were particularly low. They also complained that the
administration should have foreseen that there would be few
buyers for thrifts under the new law's restrictions on their
activities. "I think the appearance to the American public is
that this is floundering," said Rep. Bruce Vento (D., Minn.),
who chairs a task force on the efforts.</p>
<p>Originally, the administration targeted $50 billion to
cover current S&L losses. Yesterday, Mr. Brady said about
$28.3 billion will have been spent by June 30. At that point,
the administration expects 289 insolvent thrifts to have been
liquidated or sold, but their bad investments will remain in
the hands of the government. Moreover, about 800 more thrifts
are expected to require similar action.</p>
<p>Mr. Brady didn't specifically ask for Congress to pass
legislation to raise the additional cash, saying this is
likely to be determined in the current budget meetings
between the administration and Congress.</p>
<p>For its part, the administration used the hearing to call
again for a cut in the tax on capital gains, as a way to
bolster the real estate market. "At the margin, I think it's
the single most important thing we can do," said Housing and
Urban Development Secretary Jack Kemp, who is a member of the
Oversight Board monitoring the thrift cleanup.</p>
<p>He also said that a clampdown on credit has made it
tougher to sell the repossessed real estate. "I have the
feeling that there is a strong impression among people
involved in real estate and housing that there is a crunch in
the supply of credit," said Mr. Kemp.</p>
<p>Mr. Kemp also cautioned that politicizing the S&L mess
could slow the progress even more. "If we turn this into an
issue of who and when and just exactly which party, I think
it's going to be a serious blow to the necessity of finding
some area of cooperation," he said.</p>
<p>Both parties are pursuing S&L fraud legislation more
aggressively. Sen. Joseph Biden (D., Del.), chairman of the
Senate Judiciary Committee, announced he will hold a hearing
next month to examine many of the proposals to crack down on
fraud, and said he will introduce a comprehensive S&L fraud
bill after the hearing. House Banking Committee Chairman
Henry Gonzalez (D., Texas) and the committee's ranking
Republican, Ohio Rep. Chalmers Wylie are also introducing a
bill to speed S&L-related prosecution.</p>
