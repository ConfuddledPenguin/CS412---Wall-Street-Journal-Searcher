	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- An Energy Department study rebutted
arguments that consumers were gouged by oil companies when
heating fuel prices skyrocketed during last winter's cold
snap.
   The U.S. Energy Information Administration reported that
net income at the refining divisions of 10 major oil
companies fell more than 60% from the preceding heating
season. Independent refiners' profits dropped 51% from the
preceding winter.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"They lost their shirts," said Helmet Merklein, head of
the agency, in an interview.</p>
<p>After the frostiest temperatures in 60 years hit the East
Coast late last year, heating oil bills in the Northeast
spiked up 55% in December, compared with a year earlier. But
prices began dropping after the December cold snap, and
January was relatively warm. Overall, the average U.S.
household paid $71 more for home fuel oil during the heating
season between October 1989 and February 1990, the report
found.</p>
<p>Despite price boosts in heating oil and propane, "this did
not translate into a remarkable season for U.S. refineries,"
the report concluded. For the last quarter of 1989 and first
quarter of 1990, which covers the heating season, refiners
had lower profit margins than major U.S. manufacturers on
average, it said.</p>
<p>The study also didn't find any evidence of
anti-competitive behavior among refiners or marketers eager
to cash in on cold temperatures, as some consumer advocates
and lawmakers had feared, Mr. Merklein said.</p>
<p>The study was based on financial information filed by
companies this spring with the Securities and Exchange
Commission. It examined returns from refining divisions at 10
major integrated oil companies, which account for 51% of U.S.
refining capacity, and from six independent refiners to gain
a representative view of what was happening in the industry
during the past heating season.</p>
<p>Refiners and wholesalers which were lucky enough to have
large stocks of heating oil on hand when the cold weather hit
in December presumably enjoyed greater financial returns than
if there had been no cold snap, the study conceded. But
overall, over the October-to-February heating season, higher
prices were more than offset by greater costs and a price
plunge in February.</p>
