	<p class="article-leader">I don't recall ever having seen a more one-sided story in
the Journal than the Safeway article on page one May 16. Your
thesis in the article that the Safeway LBO is responsible for
or the primary cause of a whole host of "human costs" that
otherwise would not have occurred is both distorted and
unsound. Safeway is a smaller but better company than it was
in 1986. Its employees have more security as part of a
growing and profitable company. This could not be without the
actions that have taken place over the past three years.
   A brief look at a summary of supposed consequences of the
LBO reveals it to be a ludicrous insult to common sense. You
imply or directly state that the Safeway LBO is responsible
for the following:</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Killing people, heart attacks, suicides and attempted
suicides, a broken marriage engagement, a college dropout and
a nationwide shortage of engineers, car repossessions, age
discrimination, quotas, homelessness, sweatshop conditions, a
seven-day-week wage discrimination, cuts in charitable
contributions and mortgage foreclosures.</p>
<p>That's some powerful, heartless financing technique.</p>
<p>The indictment is wrong. Safeway employs more than 100,000
men and women. When you employ that many people, there are
naturally going to be events in their lives that are unhappy
and tragic, no matter what happens at the company. But to
assert or imply that an economic transaction is the primary
cause or factor in a tragic event like a heart attack or
suicide is to betray a bias that is so sharp and so deep that
it defies reasonable discussion, not to mention demonstrating
a total misunderstanding of the human heart. We discussed all
these matters with you over a period of three months.</p>
<p>Most important, you never confronted the real question:
the costs of change vs. the costs of no change. Never once
did you mention the primary reason for most of the changes
that took place at Safeway: labor costs that were out of
line, the consequences, long and short term, of those costs,
and the absolute business necessity in a low-margin, highly
competitive industry for parity of labor costs. Safeway had
to confront its major business problem -- labor costs that
were so out of line with its nonunion competition that they
caused a situation where 66% of the company was either making
no money or losing money.</p>
<p>It was this that caused the pressures for and the need for
change at Safeway. And it was this business problem, LBO or
not, that had to be solved. The bleeding had to stop. The
most important effect of the LBO was to highlight this need
and provide the urgency and incentive to act quickly.</p>
<p>The consequences of choosing to act are sometimes hard,
and sometimes they do not fall equally across the board. But
your portrait is a reflection of this in a funhouse mirror.
In the case of the Safeway corporate staff, that staff had to
be cut to match the smaller size of the company. There was no
alternative. Staff cuts have taken place at other major
companies, all over America, to reflect their business
realities. If you write about the consequences of such cuts,
why confine yourself to LBOs? Or perhaps only LBO staff cuts
cause "a heavy human toll."</p>
<p>Unions faced a hard choice: Either they and their members
accepted the fact that they would have to adjust their wage
demands to make them more competitive with the labor forces
Safeway and they were competing with, or the management of
Safeway would either quickly sell or close the stores.
Regardless of the LBO, that problem had to be faced. It is to
the great credit of the union officials with whom we
bargained that after the sale of our Dallas division they
recognized the dilemma forced on us by the Hafts and were
willing to work with us to minimize the impact.</p>
<p>Many companies faced the same problems that Safeway did.
It is the history of the grocery business in the '80s that
wage parity was being requested everywhere. Yet Safeway dealt
with its problems not perfectly, but in as humane a manner as
it could, and it came through. We believe that if you were to
ask international union officials, they would confirm that
Safeway worked very hard and in good faith to ensure that
people buying our divisions would also hire our employees.
The consequences to all of the company's constituents would
have been far worse if we had ignored those problems. The
facts are that the overwhelming majority of our employees are
working at higher wage rates and with more benefits than was
the case at the time of the buy-out. By focusing solely on
selected, individual, anecdotal portraits of the purported
individual costs of change, you ignored the larger business
and human reality.</p>
<p>The financial success of the company is "kissed off" in
one or two paragraphs stating that the company has "raised
productivity and operating profits." Among the things that
did not appear in your lengthy article:</p>
<p>-- Operating profit in 1989 was higher ($462 million) on
$14 billion of sales than it used to be in 1986 on $20
billion of sales. That is no small achievement.</p>
<p>-- Our 1989 operating profit margin of 3.2% ranked Safeway
third of the top 10 food chains.</p>
<p>-- Our operating cash flow of 5.2% of sales in 1989 ranked
us first of the five leading food chains.</p>
<p>-- Our debt has been reduced from $5.7 billion to $3.1
billion.</p>
<p>To not include these key aspects of our financial
performance is misleading to say the least -- especially when
you do include, "The company's net income was only $2.5
million last year, down from $31 million the year before."</p>
<p>The good news for Safeway's customers wasn't mentioned at
all. Safeway's prices are more competitive than any time in
the past 10 years. We have more service in our stores (39%
more employee hours per store than in 1985). Our service is
not only better, it is friendlier. We remodeled 200 stores in
the past few years to add all the specialty departments our
customers want.</p>
<p>A balanced portrait of what happened at Safeway would have
explained what happened and why.</p>
<p>Finally, I believe your article seeks to establish a new
measure by which corporate behavior should be evaluated --
providing guaranteed lifetime employment. It judges the
success of corporate behavior primarily on that criterion
regardless of other business or financial consequences. As
such, I feel it is the most anti-investorbiased article
imaginable. It implicitly tells corporate management and
investors: Don't do the right thing by taking the painful
measures you know are necessary to ensure the health of the
business in the future, and forget about shareholder value if
it requires tough action. Don't do it because The Wall Street
Journal will be there to impose its own "reckoning."</p>
<p>Readers may well ask themselves: Who pays the ultimate
price to be extracted for investing according to the new
standard you are imposing?</p>

<p>---</p>
<p>Your article contains false assertions and misquotes that
I consider to be most serious.</p>
<p>The writer indicates that my son Peter, chairman of
Safeway, was "pressed" by me in 1986: "Will anyone get hurt?
Will anyone lose his job?" in the process of Safeway's LBO.
The story stated that I expressed concern that the company's
longstanding reputation as a benevolent employer not be
damaged by the LBO. Both of these statements are untrue.
Peter and I had no such conversation, and I highly resent
having been quoted in this fashion.</p>
<p>In the changing economic climate of the past decade,
hostile takeovers have been commonplace. When the Haft family
announced its intention to buy up Safeway, many very serious
and long-reaching decisions had to be made by management in a
short period of time.</p>
<p>In any takeover situation, it is a given that jobs will be
lost. Every effort was made to minimize this effect.</p>
<p>In addition, I extremely resent the intrusion of your
reporter into my home. She telephoned me requesting an
interview "about the good old days at Safeway," and was told
a day or two later by my assistant that as policy I do not
meet with the press. Disregarding this, she showed up at my
home uninvited. As I had no intention of speaking with her,
it was necessary to ask her to leave my home. I very much
resent her disrespect for my wishes and privacy, as well as
her inaccurate portrayal of a conversation between my son and
me.</p>
<p>Peter is a man of high moral character, integrity,
sincerity and honesty. He and the management team have
consistently attempted to preserve as much of the "old"
Safeway as possible under very trying and altered
circumstances.</p>
