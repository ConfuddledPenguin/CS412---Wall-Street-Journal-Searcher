	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- The New York Stock Exchange's sudden
acceleration of its plans for off-hours stock trading was
triggered by fears about competing efforts by the rival
Nasdaq over-the-counter market and by the Big Board's own
members.
   Big Board members say the exchange acted in large part in
reaction to the National Association of Securities Dealers'
impending launch of Nasdaq International on Sept. 1, in which
the automated quotations system will begin trading 400 to 500
stocks -- including some Big Board issues -- after hours.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>And yesterday, the American Stock Exchange, in a
long-expected move, announced that it would "within days"
disclose a major joint venture for trading stocks and options
around the clock. Meanwhile, other electronic trading
networks are expected to unveil trading systems that will
offer low-cost executions for big institutional investors
away from the Big Board.</p>
<p>In an effort to bring night-time and off-exchange trading
back to New York, the Big Board said it plans to start
after-hours trading of large baskets of stock later this
year; and it plans to start thrice nightly electronic
auctions of individual Big Board stocks in 1991.</p>
<p>The Big Board has been mulling after-hours trading for at
least two years.</p>
<p>But the Big Board's stepped-up initiatives for after-hours
trading may be too late to slow erosion of its share of
trading in its own stocks, Wall Street trading executives and
large investors say.</p>
<p>While the move to cross baskets of stock after the close
was praised by trading executives, big investors said it
isn't clear whether the Big Board can pull customers away
from systems that are already up and running.</p>
<p>According to one securities executive briefed by the Big
Board, the exchange is panicky about the growth in
off-exchange trading by brokerage firms who are Big Board
members. It wants to effectively force these members to stop
their off-exchange activity.</p>
<p>But to do this, the Big Board will have to sacrifice the
role of its specialists, the influential traders who have a
monopoly to make markets in individual stocks on the exchange
floor.</p>
<p>Big Board officials "are saying: `We will provide an
electronic network at low cost because we will ultimately
eliminate the intermediary, the specialist,'" said the
securities executive. "But part of the deal is they will
prohibit off-exchange trading. The risk that the exchange has
been running is that one of the major firms decides to exit
the exchange."</p>
<p>Right now, the real threat to the Big Board's market share
isn't foreign exchanges, but aggressive off-exchange traders
such as Bernard L. Madoff Investment Securities; electronic
trading systems such as Instinet (an electronic order
matching systems owned by Reuters Holdings PLC); and
portfolio trading systems such as Posit and The Crossing
Network. All offer cheap, anonymous trading to investors
looking to cut trading costs.</p>
<p>Also, there are a host of feisty regional exchanges. And
finally, many of the nation's largest banks are having
serious discussions about trading among themselves. "Everyone
is looking to create alternatives to the New York Stock
Exchange," said a senior executive at one of the country's
largest banks.</p>
<p>The news about the Big Board's efforts prompted a variety
of announcements about similar efforts from competing
exchanges. The Chicago Board Options Exchange said in "the
near future" it will announce a major after-hours trading
effort. Leo Melamed, head of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange,
said the Merc will have its Globex system running by
November.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the Big Board's overall market share continues
to slowly erode. In the first four months of this year, the
Big Board share of trades in its own stocks averaged 67.8%,
compared with 69.7% in the first four months of last year.
The market share of the off-exchange third market expanded to
an average of 7.4% of overall trading in Big Board stocks for
the first four months, compared with 3.1% in the same period
last year.</p>
<p>"They had too much shrinkage in market share to sit
still," said Junius Peake, chairman of the Peake/Ryerson
Consulting Group Inc. "I think they are worried about the
Midwest stock exchange," and other competitors, he said.</p>
