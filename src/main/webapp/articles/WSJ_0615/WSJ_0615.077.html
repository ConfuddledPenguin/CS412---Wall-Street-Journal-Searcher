	<p class="article-leader">HONG KONG -- Bankers throughout Asia are becoming
increasingly concerned about their ability to recruit and
retain qualified staff.
   A survey of chief executive officers of 164 banks in Asia,
conducted by Egon Zehnder International S.A., a European
executive-search company, shows that concerns about personnel
increased significantly in the past year, particularly as the
spread of liberalization has bolstered demand for qualified
staff. Throughout the region, 90% of bank executives said
hiring qualified staff was a concern.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The survey shows a "significant scarcity of banking talent
throughout the region," Norman Wright, managing partner for
Egon Zehnder in Southeast Asia, said.</p>
<p>Personnel worries were far more widespread than just in
Hong Kong, where concerns about the reversion of the British
colony to Chinese sovereignty have prompted a steady outflow
of talent. Indeed, the greatest scarcity of banking
professionals was perceived in Indonesia, followed by Taiwan,
Hong Kong, South Korea, Singapore and Malaysia.</p>
<p>The survey shows that bank executives are increasingly
optimistic about business opportunities in the region. They
said that intraregional trade and investment are of growing
importance to their business, and that several infrastructure
projects planned in Southeast Asia will provide new
opportunities for banks.</p>
<p>Further, the survey shows that bank officers at corporate
headquarters don't always see things the way their
representatives in Asia do. No serious repercussions to
business were reported by local managers as a result of the
June 4, 1989, killings in pro-democracy demonstrations in
Beijing, but the officers said home-office managers were far
more bearish about prospects in China.</p>
<p>Bank officers also said their colleagues outside Asia
continue to see potential for growth in the region, though
"There is a perception that the best opportunities are in the
home trading bloc," Mr. Wright of Egon Zehnder said.</p>
<p>According to the survey results, banks in Asia are placing
the greatest emphasis on private banking, trade finance and
corporate lending. Regulation continues to hold back foreign
banks in several countries, though most are moving toward
liberalization, however slowly. Some of those same countries,
including Thailand, Taiwan and Indonesia, are expected to
offer the best opportunities for foreign banks this year.</p>
<p>Hong Kong remains the region's financial center, and 71%
of the bankers who responded to the survey said their banks
will remain in the territory after 1997. The majority said
that if their banks were forced to relocate, they would
choose Singapore as a new base.</p>
<p>Hongkong & Shanghai Banking Corp. of Hong Kong and the
Citibank unit of Citicorp were rated the best and second-best
managed banks in Asia, respectively, by other bankers. The
same two banking companies led the pack in last year's
survey.</p>
