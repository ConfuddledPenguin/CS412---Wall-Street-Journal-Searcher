	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- A federal health official proposed reducing
Medicare payments that kidney-dialysis centers receive for
providing EPO, an anti-anemia drug.
   Michael Mangano, a deputy inspector general at the
Department of Health and Human Services, told a House health
subcommittee that dialysis centers administering the drug
nationwide were earning an average gross profit "in excess of
40%."</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The drug, formally known as recombinant erythropoietin, is
manufactured by Amgen Inc. of Thousand Oaks, Calif. The
company, which has come under considerable criticism itself
for its pricing of the drug, declined to send a
representative to the hearing. The company said it already
had longstanding commitments to meet with investors and
others in New York. Instead, the company submitted written
testimony explaining and defending the drug's price. Amgen
negotiated EPO's reimbursement level last year with Medicare.</p>
<p>EPO is marketed primarily to participants in Medicare's
dialysis program, which provides coverage to more than 90% of
all patients with chronic renal failure. Under the Food and
Drug Administration's orphan drug program, Amgen has been
granted a seven-year monopoly to market the drug to dialysis
patients.</p>
<p>Rep. Pete Stark (D., Calif.), who led the House Ways and
Means subcommittee hearing, said that the federal government
had a stong interest in "getting its money's worth" from
Amgen, and he pronounced himself "disappointed" that no
company executives appeared to testify.</p>
<p>Mr. Mangano said that the dialysis centers were billing
the federal government at a flat rate -- generally $40 per
patient -- that assumes an average patient dose to be 5,000
units. But the centers were administering an average patient
dose of only 2,700 units, he said, enabling the centers to
realize the difference as profit.</p>
<p>Instead of being paid the flat rate, Mr. Mangano
recommended that the centers be reimbursed according to the
amount of the drug used.</p>
<p>Mr. Mangano's findings were challenged at the hearing by
Mardee Hagen, president of the National Renal Administrators
Association, a trade group representing dialysis centers. Ms.
Hagen said that HHS hadn't considered the costs associated
with administering the drug, including syringes and needles,
lab time and paperwork tasks. She also said that because of
possible adverse effects of the drug, which received FDA
approval a year ago, physicians were being "conservative in
their dosages to limit the possibility of complications."</p>
<p>Some questions remain about the savings that could be
realized from the HHS proposal. Mr. Mangano told the hearing
that Medicare could save $80 million annually by paying on a
per-unit basis, "assuming the current dosage level is
medically appropriate." But written testimony submitted by
the Office of Technology Assessment, a research arm of
Congress, said that per-unit payments "would almost certainly
lead to higher doses per patient." Instead, the OTA
recommended lowering the flat rate paid to dialysis centers.</p>
<p>Gordon M. Binder, Amgen's chief executive officer, said
Amgen is satisfied that the current flat-rate system "seems
to work reasonably well." He said that he had reservations
about the HHS proposal because tying the price to the current
average doseage level might mean some "patients wouldn't get
the proper amount." He added that such a change would be more
of a financial concern for dialysis centers than for Amgen.</p>
<p>Analysts said that neither of the government proposals
immediately threaten Amgen's prospects, but that the two
plans' eventual impacts on the company would range from
slightly negative to slightly positive. In general, Amgen is
in the comfortable position of having its corporate interests
tied to those of its patients.</p>
<p>The difference between the flat Medicare payment of $40
per treatment and an estimated $27 to $29 average treatment
cost for EPO is kept by the dialysis center to cover overhead
and profit. Thus, the facility can increase its margin by
reducing the amount of EPO furnished to patients.</p>
<p>In national over-the-counter trading yesterday, Amgen
shares rose $1.125 to $75.125.</p>
