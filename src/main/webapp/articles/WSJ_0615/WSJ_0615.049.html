	<p class="article-leader">PITTSBURGH -- Westinghouse Electric Corp.'s new chief
executive, Paul E. Lego, announced a series of top management
changes, but he didn't signal who will emerge as his heir
apparent.
   Mr. Lego, currently president, assumes the additional
posts of chairman and chief executive officer on July 1.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>He selected as his deputy Theodore Stern, currently
executive vice president, Energy and Utility Systems, who
becomes senior executive vice president. Mr. Stern, who was
recently named a Westinghouse director, is 60 years old, the
same age as Mr. Lego, making it unlikely that his promotion
would put him in position to succeed to the top job.</p>
<p>John B. Yasinsky, already an executive vice president,
picked up most of Mr. Stern's former responsibilities --
running the turbine and generator, nuclear power systems and
waste-to-energy plant operations. Mr. Yasinsky, 51, moves to
executive vice president, Power Systems. He formerly was
responsible for the World Resources and Technology group.</p>
<p>Maurice C. Sardi, 55, executive vice president,
Commercial, will become executive vice president, Commercial
and Corporate Resources. He already had line responsibility
for a number of diversified businesses ranging from office
furniture to beverage bottling. Under the new arrangement, he
assumes responsibility for real estate development,
government affairs and the research center.</p>
<p>Gary M. Clark, 54, executive vice president, Industries,
will add the Westinghouse Electric Supply operation and
Offshore Manufacturing to his group. He already oversees a
hazardous waste cleanup business and refrigeration equipment
for trucks, among other businesses.</p>
<p>Burton B. Staniar, 48, chairman of Westinghouse
Broadcasting Co., the company's radio and television arm,
will pick up the Longines-Wittnauer Watch Co. unit and the
Westinghouse Communications business.</p>
<p>Warren H. Hollinshead, 54, vice president and treasurer,
will become vice president and deputy, finance, making him
the likely successor to Harry F. Murray, executive vice
president, finance, who plans to retire at year end.</p>
