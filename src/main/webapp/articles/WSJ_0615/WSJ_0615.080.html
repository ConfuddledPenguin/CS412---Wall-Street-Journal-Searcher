	<p class="article-leader">I applaud your willingness to print the Safeway LBO
article. I am president of a moderate-sized business and have
been forced to downsize the company, so I have great empathy
for the workers and a fair understanding of business
pressures.
   It is plain to me that KKR and its predecessor in this
deal care little for the fabric that bonds employees to a
company. Mr. Magowan and senior management have earned
economic windfalls at great expense to the average, dedicated
employee. Why must such a cadre of wealthy executives stick
it so hard to the employees working in their stores?</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>George Roberts pontificates that quotas and pressure to
perform are facts of life in today's world of global
competition. Most surely they are. Yet, while he roams the
world as a wealthy man delivering this message, his employees
are scraping by at lower than pre-buy-out wages. Their
families will never forget his arrogance or the policies that
stretched out severance payments over months to those who can
least afford it. It is simply revolting.</p>
<p>Business can be tough, but it should establish a standard
by which it will be judged within the society. Although KKR,
Mr. Magowan and a handful of executives will continue to reap
financial rewards, it has been done in a most shameful way.</p>

<p>Your article is not only the single best I've read in your
paper, but also the single best argument that unions are
necessary to keep management humane.</p>
<p>Your reporting is as telling as those photographs in
textbooks of 10-year-olds who worked 12-hour days in the
Lowell textile mills earlier in our century.</p>
<p>What employees today trust management to be loyal to them?
Very few, I'm afraid, and if so, they are naive or fools.</p>

<p>It must be remembered that Safeway was originally
jeopardized by uninvited corporate predators. The defensive
actions that followed were then necessary and appropriate, in
my opinion.</p>
<p>Our relationship with Safeway officials both before and
after the LBO shows no change in their always high regard for
other humans. Their responsibilities following the LBO were
difficult. From our vantage point, they went about their task
with integrity and sensitivity.</p>
<p>Suicide, heart attack and diabetes result from lifetime
proclivities. Your effort to attribute the sole cause to
Safeway is uncommonly cruel.</p>

<p>Your article presents a grim picture. It stands in sharp
contrast to our experience with the management buy-out of
Safeway's Oklahoma division. The division wasn't acquired by
a grocery chain.</p>
<p>A company formed by Clayton & Dubilier, along with 33
local managers, purchased the division in 1987, keeping all
5,624 employees and 106 stores. What we found when we bought
Homeland was a small, neglected part of a larger corporate
bureaucracy, starved for capital, and losing market share.</p>
<p>With an ownership interest in the company conferred on
full-time employees through a stock appreciation rights
program, Homeland has developed a new entrepreneurial spirit.
In addition to growing faster and becoming more productive
since the buy-out, Homeland has added more than 1,200 new
jobs, expanded advertising expenditures 25% and, over the
past two years, invested $60 million in new stores and store
remodels compared with the $3.6 million invested by Safeway
the year before the buy-out.</p>
<p>The lesson of the Safeway buy-out is not the unbalanced
portrait of despair that we were left with in your article;
it is equally a story of the remarkable benefits achievable
through the organization innovation represented by Homeland
and many similar divestiture LBOs. We have seen it many
times. Free from big-company constraints, managers and
employees who become owners of enterprises are capable of
great feats. And this is something American business sorely
needs to remain globally competitive.</p>

<p>Messrs. Haft, Kravis, Magowan et al. inflicted more
suffering than if they had ridden through town on horseback
pillaging and plundering, as their spiritual forebears once
did. We see our society as more civilized now, but some of us
still regard material gain as more valuable than human life.</p>
<p>The deal-makers care little that the costs of this
transaction greatly outweigh the rewards; they have kept the
gains while passing on the costs to others. Their lack of
conscience permits them to talk of "efficiency" and
"profitability" to justify dumping thousands of loyal
employees, with pitifully meager severance pay, and to treat
the remainder like overworked pack animals, driven by the
fear of their own dismissal.</p>

<p>A sound that I could not identify kept me awake last
night. Perhaps it was Herbert Haft and his son laughing over
the Safeway LBO on their way to the bank.</p>
<p>You are to be commended on your article on Safeway. It is
good that this legalized piracy is exposed to the light of
day, with its shocking loss of employment and even human
lives.</p>

<p>---</p>
<p>Your story confirms to me once again that when thugs like
Kravis and Roberts loot a business it's somehow considered
legitimate. Yet when the Mafia does the same thing, it's
crime.</p>
<p>The article also confirms how LBOs, with their crushing
debt burdens, turn industry leaders into also-rans with
appalling consequences for employees.</p>

<p>I was appalled and disgusted to read that Steve Dolinka, a
25-year Safeway employee, was fired for "theft" after he
forgot to pay for soup and toast he ate at the deli. Given
the circumstances of the man's loss of his teen-age son in a
brutal murder, no trivial oversight by him on the job in any
way justifies his dismissal. Business may be business, but
when simple human compassion is lost to this shocking degree
in any firm, the organization and its managers deserve to
fail miserably.</p>
<p>Have you no shame, Mr. Magowan? The man whom you fired
even accepted the rationale for his dismissal] I extend my
belated condolences to Mr. Dolinka on the terrible loss of
his son.</p>

<p>For years, I worked as a competitor of the Safeway Food
Stores. To respect them as an industry leader was prudent.
This was prior to the LBO. I left the industry for a time and
returned as a vendor, supplying services to companies like
Safeway. I am an outsider. The respect I held for the firm in
earlier years has grown significantly and I am proud to be
associated with such a fine organization. The "monsters" you
attempt to portray exist only within your misguided thought
process.</p>
<p>If the same manner of expose were foisted upon any other
major company in America, the names would change but the
story would read the same. The '80s were tough on all of us.
I know. Twice in my career I have faced a pink slip. Once due
to an LBO. But, you know, life does go on.</p>

<p>Your exhaustively researched and documented (but oh so
depressing) story could serve as a textbook on how the
capitalist system ought not to work. A well-managed and
prosperous business that produces and sells real goods is
basically sold as real estate to the great profit of the
paper-pushing deal-makers. Loyal, productive employees are
fired by the thousands and those remaining (except at the
very top) are required to do much more for much less. In the
affected communities, competition is reduced as market share
becomes concentrated in fewer hands. For the consumer, price
increases are accompanied by service declines as fewer
workers staff the operating units.</p>
<p>The incentive for employees in this atmosphere ("you get
to keep your job") is akin to the employee-motivation methods
used in Stalinist Russia ("you get to continue breathing").
The results are about the same: a lot of poor people, a few
suicides, and an army of nine-to-fivers whose chief concern
is making quota.</p>
<p>James P. Strain</p>

<p>---</p>
<p>You do a masterful job describing how an LBO can enrich a
few at the expense of many and, in the process, threaten the
long-term viability of an enterprise that has been a leader
in its field.</p>
<p>In 1889 my grandfather founded a chain of grocery stores
in San Diego that Charlie Merrill purchased in 1929 and that
became one of Safeway's most successful divisions. About 100
years later, Charlie's grandson Peter Magowan found it
necessary to sell the San Diego operation in order to support
the LBO.</p>

<p>---</p>
<p>Any jerk in CEO's clothing -- or president's clothing or
plant manager's clothing -- can make an operation look
suddenly efficient by firing a quarter of the employees,
reducing benefits, deferring maintenance and the rest. Pay
the people for a 40-hour week but arrange it so they really
have to work 50 hours and the money rolls in like never
before.</p>
<p>However, except for the CEO or president, practitioners of
this art know you must have yourself promoted away from this
kind of highly successful operation because after two or
three years the best people will begin having heart attacks,
employee divorces will increase, and employee unhappiness
will become an unrecognized, unquantified drag on profits.</p>

<p>In March of this year, Safeway and Safeway's employees
presented the second-largest check ever given on the National
Easter Seal Telethon -- a check for $4.1 million, which was
an increase of $2.5 million over 1989. A company without a
heart, a company with disgruntled and unhappy employees could
hardly be expected to perform such a miracle.</p>
<p>Safeway also remains one of the major contributors to food
banks and feeding programs around the country, and its
corporate office and division offices provide tremendous
support to charitable groups in the communities where they
operate.</p>
<p>You unfairly attacked and misrepresented a good company
and its great employees.</p>

<p>You tell of the former Safeway trucker who you say "blew
his brains out." The man went into the bathroom and used his
.22-caliber rifle on himself after a year of depression over
his lost job.</p>
<p>I am offended not only by the choice of words used, but
also by the lack of sensitivity for the victims in your
story. How do you think the widow is going to feel when she
remembers that devastating time by reading such lurid
details. As a former reader, I question your integrity.</p>

<p>I was struck that this entire affair was one of excesses:
Employees and unions overreached and asked too high a wage;
management and stockholders wanted too great a profit; the
banks, investment houses and deal-makers eschewed reasonable
fees and exacted egregious levies. Hence, any merit this LBO
might claim is overshadowed by the embarrassment of riches
enjoyed by some and the tragic losses endured by others.</p>
<p>Some restraint on the part of all would have won big for
all. A concern for ethics and morality (there is a place for
these in the business world) might have tempered the
attitudes, resulting in a happier outcome. As it was, the
conduct and consequences seem more like war than diplomacy,
the tools used more like chain saws than pruning shears.</p>

<p>I read the article with fascinated horror. All I could
think of was the story of Coriolanus, the Roman patrician who
so hated the common people that he even opposed the free
distribution of corn when the city was in the grip of a
terrible famine. Not surprisingly, he was expelled from Rome.
He retaliated by gathering up an army of Rome's enemies and
marching on the city.</p>
<p>The women of Rome appealed to his aged mother, Veturia, to
intercede. Supported by her daughter-in-law and grandsons,
she walked out of the city gates to the enemy camp. The
historian Livy describes how seeing his mother, Coriolanus
ran forward and "would have embraced her had he not been
checked by her sudden turn to anger. `I would know,' she
said, `before I accept your kiss, whether I have come to an
enemy or a son.'" She then upbraided him in no uncertain
terms for his treachery to his own people. Weeping, he fell
at her feet and begged forgiveness.</p>
<p>It hardly takes effort to see Coriolanus in Mr. Magowan.
But if only his mother bore some resemblance to Veturia]
Alas, what might have been a triumphant story is destined for
Greek tragedy.</p>

<p>We have been a major supplier to Safeway Stores for more
than 50 years. We have always worked closely with Safeway,
particularly during the time when it went through its LBO.</p>
<p>There is no question in our minds that Mr. Magowan and his
associates have been able to accomplish a complete turnaround
for the Safeway organization. In our judgment, Safeway would
not have made it through the 1980s if it had not restructured
its organization in order to address its competitive position
in the marketplace. Today, Safeway is alive and well and a
leader in the industry on a number of key financial
measurements. This is indeed a remarkable success story and a
company where 100,000 people are still productively employed.</p>
<p>Our free-enterprise system does not work without pain, and
we all know that from time to time difficult decisions must
be made to stay competitive in a fast-changing market.
Safeway made those decisions in the late 1980s and, as a
result, is a strong viable competitor in the retail-grocery
business.</p>
