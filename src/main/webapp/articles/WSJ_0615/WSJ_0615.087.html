	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- The International Development Association, a
World Bank affiliate, authorized a $150 million loan to China
to help farmers increase production of food crops, fruit,
livestock and shrimp and fish on farm-type ponds.
   The World Bank also is considering other loans to China,
but has been forced to delay action on several, including a
proposed $150 million loan to help finance transportation
projects. In the wake of China's crackdown in June 1989 on
pro-democracy demonstrators in Beijing and other Chinese
cities, the U.S. and other member countries of the World Bank
have blocked approval of some loans to China. However, the
U.S. has said it wouldn't oppose approval of loans that serve
"humanitarian" purposes.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>A senior World Bank official said the approval of the IDA
credit to China brings the total newly authorized World Bank
credits to that country to $590 million during the bank's
current fiscal year, which ends June 30.</p>
<p>Separately, the World Bank approved a $385 million loan to
Eletrobras, Brazil's national power company, to improve
electric power transmission networks of nine regional
utilities serving many parts of the country.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the World Bank said it will guarantee the
principal on a $100 million fixed-rate, 15-year bond issue of
India's Housing Development Finance Corp., to be placed in
the U.S. market by Salomon Brothers, a New York investment
banking company.</p>
<p>The bank said this was its first such guarantee under its
expanded co-financing program, which is intended to help
eligible borrowing countries obtain financing in a broad
range of financial markets.</p>
