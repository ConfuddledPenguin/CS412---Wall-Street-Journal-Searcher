	<p class="article-leader">PORTLAND, Ore. -- Fred Meyer Inc. said it reached a new
financing agreement with 10 major banks that more than
doubles the retailing chain's credit line to $335 million.
   The company said Continental Illinois Corp.'s main unit
heads the bank group.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Fred Meyer said it expanded its credit line to help
finance expected growth and to help pay for upgrading its
computer systems.</p>
<p>The company was hurt in 1989 by writeoffs on computer
hardware, higher sales promotion costs and other unusual
costs. It had a loss for the year of $6.8 million on sales of
$2.28 billion.</p>
