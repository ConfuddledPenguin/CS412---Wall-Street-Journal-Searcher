	<p class="article-leader">Standard & Poor's Corp. said it downgraded its debt
ratings for Chrysler Corp. and Ford Motor Co., while
affirming ratings for General Motors Corp.
   The move followed by one day an announcement from Moody's
Investors Service Inc. that it is reviewing the ratings of
$22.28 billion of Chrysler debt for possible downgrade.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The combined amount of debt of all three companies covered
by the S&P move is about $200 billion.</p>
<p>In separate statements, Chrysler and Ford said they are
"disappointed" with the agency's actions. Both added they are
committed to current spending programs to support future
products, despite financial pressures. GM declined to comment
on S&P's affirmation of its debt ratings.</p>
<p>Chrysler was hit the hardest of the three auto makers by
S&P's announcement. Its senior debt rating, lowered to
triple-B-minus from triple-B, now is one notch away from
speculative grade, based on S&P's rating system. Moody's
currently rates Chrysler two notches above speculative grade.</p>
<p>S&P cut Ford's senior debt rating to double-A-minus from
double-A; this cut gives Ford the same senior debt rating as
GM.</p>
<p>Investors had little time to respond to the news, first
word of which came only minutes before the stock market
closed yesterday. Chrysler fell 25 cents to $15.625 in New
York Stock Exchange composite trading; Ford ended unchanged
at $46.375 and GM dropped 37.5 cents to $49.625.</p>
<p>S&P's action was unexpected, as neither Chrysler nor Ford
was on the agency's CreditWatch list. But Scott Sprinzen,
S&P's vice president of corporate finance said the downgrades
came from "an ongoing reassessment" of the companies.</p>
<p>Intensifying competition in the North American auto
industry combined with "cyclical softness in domestic auto
demand has resulted in a weakening of earnings and cash flow"
at all of the U.S. Big Three auto makers, S&P said. The
credit ratings service cited "excess production capacity,
proliferation of product offerings and a heating up of price
competition" as factors contributing to the increasingly
competitive environment in the North American market.</p>
<p>Chrysler is "particularly affected" by these changes
because it has virtually no overseas operations to offset
cycles in North America, S&P said. The agency noted the
company is "aggressively" pursuing cost-cutting opportunities
and has "adequate financial flexibility . . . to meet
near-term" obligations. But longer-term, the auto maker
"faces significant challenges," particularly given its
"already high" debt levels and "heavy capital spending
requirements."</p>
<p>Chrysler has said it plans to spend some $15 billion over
the next five years on new products; the company's long-term
debt and unfunded pension liabilities stood at roughly $18
billion as of March 31.</p>
<p>In a statement, Chrysler said it is "deeply disappointed"
with the ratings downgrade, which the company believes "is
not warranted by the facts." Chrysler noted that its spending
program "is on schedule, intact and inviolate," and said
S&P's downgrade of Chrysler Financial Corp.'s commercial
paper rating to single-A-3 from single-A-2 "is inconsistent"
with the financial subsidiary's continuing record
profitability. . . ."</p>
<p>Chrysler also said the market "readily accepted" a $1.1
billion 30-year bond offering for Auburn Hills Trust
certificates, "expressing high confidence in the company over
a very long term."</p>
<p>The company had to provide extensive protection to buyers
to support the certificates, however, including a guarantee
that the coupon rate on the certificates would be increased
if Chrysler's debt ratings fall below investment grade.</p>
<p>Ford also faces challenges, but S&P's Mr. Sprinzen said
the No. 2 U.S. auto maker "is still a very strong company in
our eyes." That partly reflects, the agency noted, Ford's
"strong position" in Europe. Still, that market within a few
years will likely be "increasingly subject to many of the
same problems plaguing the domestic industry," the agency
cautioned.</p>
<p>In addition, Ford's capital spending over the next five
years will exceed the $23 billion it spent from 1985 to 1989.
S&P said this spending plan raises concerns that the "debt
reduction and replenishment of cash reserves that had been
anticipated in the wake of two recently completed
acquisitions will likely be deferred." Ford spent $2.5
billion to acquire British auto maker Jaguar PLC and $3.4
billion to acquire Associates, a finance and insurance
underwriting company.</p>
<p>David N. McCammon, Ford's vice president of finance and
treasurer, acknowledged the auto maker's capital spending
program "will use some of our financial capacity, but our
balance sheet is strong and we expect our investments to lead
to further strengthening of our financial condition."</p>
<p>S&P also cut to double-A-minus from double-A the senior
debt rating for Ford Motor Credit Co., but the agency
affirmed the single-A-1-plus rating on Ford Motor Credit's
commercial paper. Mr. McCammon said Ford's financial group --
which includes the credit company, Associates and First
Nationwide Bank -- provide "an important element of stability
during the period of economic weakness."</p>
<p>GM's debt rating, which had been lower than Ford's until
now, was downgraded in 1987 to the current double-A-minus
level because of the No. 1 U.S. auto maker's declining share
of the U.S. auto market and the company's need to reduce
costs, Mr. Sprinzen said. But "benefits of new product
development efforts have enabled GM to at least stem the
market share erosion that occurred through the 1980s and its
sales levels have held up relatively well over the past few
quarters," S&P said.</p>
