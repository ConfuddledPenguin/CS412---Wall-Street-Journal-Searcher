	<p class="article-leader">CALGARY, Alberta -- Gulf Canada Resources Ltd. said it
completed the purchase of Imperial Oil Ltd.'s 22.8% stake in
Interhome Energy Inc. for 492.4 million Canadian dollars
(US$420.1 million), or C$54.50 an Interhome share.
   The purchase is the first step of a complex reshuffling of
assets announced in April by Toronto's Reichmann family,
which owns 74.3% of Gulf Canada through the family's real
estate flagship, Olympia & York Developments Ltd.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Gulf Canada, a Calgary-based oil and gas producer, plans
to resell the 22.8% Interhome stake to Toronto-based GW
Utilities Ltd., thereby raising GW's interest in Interhome to
63.5% from 40.7%. Olympia & York owns 89.3% of GW Utilities,
and plans to take it private under a previous tender offer
for its remaining shares.</p>
<p>The Reichmanns' plans also call for Gulf Canada to merge
with Calgary-based Interhome's Home Oil Co. unit, and for
Interhome's remaining oil pipeline subsidiary,
Interprovincial Pipe Line Ltd., to be spun off later this
year to Interhome's shareholders. The proposals are subject
to holder and other approvals.</p>
<p>Toronto-based Imperial Oil, a large integrated oil concern
that is 70%-owned by Exxon Corp., New York, said previously
it expects the sale of its Interhome stake to generate a net
gain of about C$195 million, or C$1.03 a share.</p>
