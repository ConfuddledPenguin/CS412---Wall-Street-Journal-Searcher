	<p class="article-leader">National pride is on the rise in Japan, and economic
nationalism is growing in the U.S. Nonetheless, two new polls
show that citizens in both countries are often more critical
of their own societies than of each other's.
   Which society is more intolerant of other races? In a
recent Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll, a plurality of
registered U.S. voters -- 46% -- point to America, while a
separate Journal poll in Japan found 49% of the Japanese name
their own country. Which society has more of a long-term
perspective? Fifty-one percent of Americans say Japan, but
only 10% of Japanese agree.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Americans, by a big margin of 65% to 23%, say Japan has
stronger family values, while 49% of Japanese say that honor
goes to the U.S. Each side thinks its own society is the more
selfish.</p>
<p>In addition to this mutual modesty, two other strong
impressions emerge from the polls. One it that there is broad
agreement between the two countries on several societal
traits. The other is that Japanese are much more likely to
see no difference between Japan and the U.S.</p>
<p>For example, respondents in both countries generally agree
that the U.S. is more devoted to democracy, free trade and
free speech than Japan; that Americans are happier with their
lives than Japanese; and that Japan is more nationalistic.</p>
<p>But while 89% of Americans think the U.S. is more devoted
to democracy, only 37% of Japanese think so; 39% of Japanese
say there's no difference between the two countries' level of
devotion to democracy, while 15% give the nod to Japan.</p>
<p>Similarly, 93% of Americans and 39% of Japanese think the
U.S. is more devoted to free speech, while 40% of Japanese
see no difference between the two countries. Fully 70% of
Americans think the U.S. is more "honest in dealing with
others and others' countries"; 26% of Japanese agree, but 50%
see no difference (only 15% of Japanese think Japan is more
honest).</p>
<p>The U.S. poll was conducted for the Journal and NBC by
political pollsters Peter Hart and Robert Teeter. The poll in
Japan was conducted for the Journal by Nippon Research.</p>
