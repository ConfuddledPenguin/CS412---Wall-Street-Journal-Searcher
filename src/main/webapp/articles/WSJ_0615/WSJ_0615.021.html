	<p class="article-leader">HONG KONG -- In February, the Hong Kong Futures Exchange
was touting its new interest-rate futures contract as the
"springboard to a new era."
   It turned out to be more like a grim repeat of the past.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The contract received verbal backing from some of this
British colony's biggest banks and brokerage firms, but few
ended up trading it. Last month, trading volume was a meager
144 contracts a day.</p>
<p>Analysts offer myriad reasons for the lack of trading
interest in the new contract, from poor contract design and
promotion to high trading costs. Some of these problems could
have been avoided and may yet be fixed. Still, the failure of
the contract is just one symptom of a more general malaise
afflicting the Hong Kong Futures Exchange: loss of investor
confidence.</p>
<p>"Hong Kong lost all credibility internationally" during
the 1987 global stock market crash, says the head of futures
trading in Hong Kong for a U.S. securities company.</p>
<p>Adding to the exchange's troubles, chief executive officer
Douglas Ford said on Monday that, because of personal
reasons, he will leave his post when his contract expires
this week.</p>
<p>Exchange executives are disappointed that trading
continues to languish in the two financial futures contracts
offered: the Hang Seng stock-index contract, based on the
leading indicator of the Hong Kong stock market; and the
interest-rate contract, based on the three-month Hong Kong
interbank-offered rate, or Hibor, which is the rate banks
charge one another for U.S.-dollar loans. In hindsight, the
same officials acknowledge that several obvious factors have
hampered the performance of the contracts:</p>
<p>-- A HK$1.8 billion (US$230 million) emergency bailout,
essential to keeping the futures exchange from collapsing
during the 1987 crash, must be paid off. A levy on every Hang
Seng index contract goes toward repayment of that debt, and
the charge is so high that many brokers don't consider the
contract to be worth trading.</p>
<p>-- Investors worry that low trading volume prevents them
from jumping in and out of the market quickly. Exchange
officials are aware of the conundrum: They can't build volume
without investors, but investors eschew trading in a
low-volume market.</p>
<p>-- The exchange required a complete overhaul after the
1987 crash. As the restructuring -- as well as resolution of
corruption charges against former exchange officials --
dragged on, cynicism grew among investors. Now, many don't
want to give futures a chance. (A futures contract is an
agreement to make or take delivery of a commodity or security
at a set price at a later time.)</p>
<p>When stock markets around the world crashed in October
1987, Hong Kong alone closed its exchanges. At the time,
officials said they hoped the closure would give investors a
chance to assess the relative merits of the market. Instead,
selling pressure built during the four-day closure, and when
the stock and futures markets reopened, prices collapsed. The
debacle sent 40 futures brokers into default and prompted the
emergency bailout put together by a coalition of banks.</p>
<p>Hundreds of local individual speculators had been betting
that stock prices would continue to rally. Collectively, they
lost millions. Worse yet for confidence in the market, those
who had sold Hang Seng index futures contracts in
anticipation of a decline in stock prices weren't able to
collect the money they should have made after prices fell.
Nearly HK$1 billion in claims remains outstanding, and more
important, the exchange suffered irreparable damage to its
image.</p>
<p>Active membership has dropped to only about 40 firms from
128 before the crash. Volume in the Hang Seng index contract
-- in its glory days, the second most actively traded
stock-index futures contract in the world, with average daily
volume of 27,000 -- was only 11,710 lots for all of May.</p>
<p>Analysts say the exchange's inability to stage a rapid
comeback, as much as the 1987 crash itself, is frightening
investors away. The restructuring of the exchange brought in
new leadership, skimmed from successful futures exchanges
around the world. They revamped the exchange's clearing
corporation and revised the trading rules to mirror
international standards.</p>
<p>All that took time, and as trading slumped and claims
remained unsettled, investors and brokers turned away from
the market. In the end, it was 2 1/2 years before the
revamped exchange brought out the three-month Hibor contract,
the first new contract to be offered since the crash. The
contract gives traders the chance to buy or sell a contract
on the Hibor rate at a specified price on a set date in the
future. The three-month Hibor rate is now about 9.5%.</p>
<p>The start-up date was pushed back several times while the
exchange spent months refining the contract specifications
and obtaining government approval. During the delays,
enthusiasm waned, though officials offered assurances that
they were only trying to ensure that they got the contract
right.</p>
<p>Because the Hong Kong dollar is pegged to the U.S. dollar,
banks already were using well-developed contracts in
Singapore and at the Chicago Mercantile Exchange to hedge
their Hong Kong-dollar risk. Knowing that, exchange officials
in Hong Kong consulted with the colony's biggest banks to
design a contract that they hoped would better serve these
institutions.</p>
<p>They then turned around and ignored some of the advice
they had received. As a concession to smaller members of the
futures exchange, the size of the Hibor contract was set at
HK$1 million -- too small for the large banks to use as a
hedging tool.</p>
<p>"It's tiny," says Christopher Roberts, who heads futures
trading for Anderson Man (Investment Services) Ltd., a
subsidiary of the large British futures brokerage firm E.D. &
F. Man Ltd. "The contract is even more ridiculous than the
Hang Seng index contract in terms of size." As with the Hibor
contract, brokers often complain that the Hang Seng contract
is too small.</p>
<p>Volume in the Hibor contract met exchange officials'
expectations in the initial weeks of trading, more because
those expectations were extremely modest than because of any
scramble to trade the contract. Indeed, banks were never
convinced that trading volume was sufficient to offer viable
opportunities for getting in and out of positions quickly,
and volume in the Hibor contract soon began to slide.</p>
<p>In an interview before Monday's announcement of his
pending departure, Mr. Ford said the Hibor contract will soon
be increased to HK$5 million to catch bankers' interest. He
also promised improvements in the Hang Seng index contract,
including a reduction in levies, an increase in trading
limits and a doubling of the price increment, so that the
cost of every lot traded is lower. It now costs HK$86 to
trade one contract, and the minimum price movement in the
contract yields only HK$50. At most other futures exchanges,
the cost of a single trade is 10% to 15% of the minimum price
fluctuation.</p>
<p>The exchange is arguing to its new regulator, the
Securities and Futures Commission, that the levy must be
reduced to generate enough volume to save the contract.</p>
