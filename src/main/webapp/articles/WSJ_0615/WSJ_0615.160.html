	<p class="article-leader">Wheeling-Pittsburgh Steel Corp. said it reached a
settlement with the Pension Guaranty Corp., the Salaried
Committee and all creditors' committees that will resolve
claims arising from the 1985 termination of the company's
salaried pension plans.
   Under the agreement, Wheeling-Pittsburgh, which is
operating under Chapter 11 of the federal Bankruptcy Code,
will buy annuities to cover a portion of the benefits
previously provided under the terminated plans for salaried
employees who retired before April 17, 1989, or who were
eligible for pension as of Nov. 8, 1985 even if they retire
after April 17, 1989.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>In addition, the Wheeling, W. Va., company said it will
establish a plan to provide disability retirement benefits
and spousal death benefits for all current salaried employees
and all those receiving pension benefits.</p>
<p>The company said the agreement is a "major breakthrough"
in the process of reorganization, but didn't estimate the
cost of the programs.</p>
