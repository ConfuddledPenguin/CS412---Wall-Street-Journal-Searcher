	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- The Federal Communications Commission
proposed rules to rein in businesses that provide
telephone-operator services.
   But it stopped short of moving to regulate rates. Instead,
it proposed to solve the problem of price gouging with an
approach that relies on informed consumers and technical
requirements to prevent blocked calls.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The commission voted 5-0 to ask for public comment on a
package that would require operator services, as well as
hotels, airports, hospitals and other businesses with many
public phones, to provide customers with rate and other
information and connections to the phone company of their
choice.</p>
<p>Operator businesses generally link callers to
long-distance carriers. Some provide multilingual operators
or other special services for callers. But most of the new
operator-services companies inflate charges and give hotels
or airports, for example, a percentage of the collections.
Companies with many public telephones have begun to view
phones as a profit center and have contracted with these
operator-services businesses.</p>
<p>Operator services and companies that contract with them,
such as hotel chains, would be required not only to identify
the company that is handling customers' calls and provide
rate information but also to provide instructions on how
customers can gain access to the long-distance carrier they
want.</p>
<p>Since 1988, when the pay-phone and operator-services
business was largely deregulated, the commission has been
flooded with thousands of consumer complaints about
unscrupulous operator services. Even the commissioners had
their war stories.</p>
<p>Commissioner Ervin Duggan regaled the crowded FCC
auditorium at the agency's regular monthly meeting with a
tale of his unsuccessful efforts to get a $3 refund from a
pay-phone operator. "I held out for physical torture," he
said. Commissioner Sherrie Marshall told of her frustration
in trying to get a connection at an airport phone to the
long-distance company she uses. And Commissioner Andrew
Barrett joked that perhaps the agency's enforcement division
could help get a refund of a 43% surcharge an Atlanta hotel
tacked onto his phone charges.</p>
<p>Under the FCC proposal, telephone-operator companies and
phone-service suppliers couldn't block access to a caller's
carrier of choice. For example, a hotel guest using a phone
linked to one long-distance carrier would have to be allowed
to connect to another carrier; moreover, the hotel and the
operator-services company would be required to tell the
consumer how to make that connection.</p>
<p>The agency also is considering requiring modifications in
telephone equipment that would allow customers to reach the
long-distance carrier of their choice by dialing an access
code. The proposed package would require that local telephone
companies, such as the regional Bells, give customers
information about how to reach their long-distance company,
and that the phone companies publish this information in
their white-pages directories.</p>
<p>The period for public comments on the proposal and
responses runs for about five months.</p>
<p>The proposal drew immediate criticism from consumer
groups, which complained that it doesn't go far enough in
protecting callers. David Wagenhauser, executive director of
the Telecommunications Research and Action Center, said the
agency's proposal is evidence that "the commission will
continue to give alternative operator-services companies
carte blanche to gouge the American public." The commission,
he said, "should be less concerned about reading and writing
{providing consumer information} and more concerned about
arithmetic -- the rates charged by these companies."</p>
<p>Legislation being considered in Congress would make rates
subject to FCC regulation. But FCC Chairman Alfred Sikes
warned against taking that approach, calling it a "mistake
for Congress to pass legislation requiring the FCC to get
involved in tariffing of alternative operator-service
providers."</p>
<p>In February 1989, the commission tried to address the
problem with mild restrictions on five operator-services
companies. The companies were required to identify themselves
to each caller and to place stickers on the telephones or
placards nearby, listing their names and numbers to call for
more information about the services.</p>
<p>Separately, the commission adopted rules designed to keep
youngsters from calling pornography services.</p>
<p>The regulations, adopted by a 5-0 vote, require
dial-a-porn lines to use credit-card verification, subscriber
access codes or messages scrambled in such a way that
prevents children under 18 years old from being able to
listen.</p>
<p>The dial-a-porn companies also must notify telephone
companies that they provide adult services and that the
services are subject to billing notification as adult-message
services. Local phone companies are generally required to
block adult services, unless a phone subscriber requests that
the numbers be unblocked.</p>
