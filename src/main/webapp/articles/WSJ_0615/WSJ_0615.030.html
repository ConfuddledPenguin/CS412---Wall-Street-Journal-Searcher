	<p class="article-leader">BRUSSELS -- The European Community's competition
commissioner, Sir Leon Brittan, decided to take no further
action against Britain's tied-pub system, already the subject
of national measures to promote competition.
   After a yearlong review of the EC's beer market, Sir Leon
concluded there was no evidence to justify a crackdown on
tied-house arrangements, which will continue to have an
exemption from EC competition rules that expires in 1997. In
the tied-house system, breweries own or control public houses
and limit the types of beer the pubs may sell.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Though the commission expressed concern about inadequate
competition in Britain, it decided to wait to evaluate
measures recently imposed by Britain on the beer industry
before deciding whether EC action is necessary.</p>
<p>The commission said 62% of Britain's beer sales pass
through the tied-house system. In the other five EC countries
that have tied pubs -- Belgium, West Germany, France,
Luxembourg and the Netherlands -- this figure is below 40%.</p>
<p>But the commission plans a further investigation into
licensing agreements between major brewers, under which
breweries in different countries grant each other exclusive
rights to brew and market beers. Such accords can lead to
market sharing, reducing the scope for imports and blocking
the entry into the market of major competitors, according to
the EC competition authorities.</p>
