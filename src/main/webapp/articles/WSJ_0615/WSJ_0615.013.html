	<p class="article-leader">PARIS -- French consumer prices in May rose 0.2% from
April and 3% from a year earlier, the National Statistics
Institute said in a preliminary report.
   The May result represents a slowdown in price growth from
April's monthly rise of 0.4% and trims year-to-year inflation
from the April rate of 3.2%. Both of the May figures are in
line with previous estimates by economists, who had based
their outlook on signs that service-sector inflation would
slow from the unusually high rate of 0.8% in April.</p>

definitive May index on June 28.</p>
