	<p class="article-leader">NEWTOWN, Pa. -- Tseng Labs Inc. is "comfortable" with
analysts' estimates of 1990 earnings of around 40 cents a
share, Jack Gibbons, chief financial officer, said.
   That range would indicate net income of about $7.3
million. In 1989, the maker of enhanced graphics devices for
personal computers had net of $5.1 million, or 28 cents a
share, on sales of $31.1 million.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Personal computer sales "are harder to predict than the
weather," Gibbons said in an interview. But he expressed
confidence in Tseng Labs' ability to sustain recent growth
trends.</p>
<p>The company attributes much of the anticipated improvement
in performance to its ET4000 product line, a new generation
of video graphics array controllers for color monitors. Jack
Tseng, president and chief executive officer, said the ET4000
has "achieved a 20% share after only four to six months on
the market."</p>
<p>An earlier product, the ET3000, was an important engine of
growth for Tseng Labs in the late 1980s. The product was
developed in response to International Business Machines
Corp.'s introduction in 1987 of its PS/2 line of personal
computers.</p>
<p>Tseng said the company now delivers about 300,000 to
400,000 video graphic array chips a quarter. Currently, sales
volume for the ET3000 is about twice that of the ET4000. By
the fourth quarter, however, Mr. Tseng said he believes that
ratio will be reversed.</p>
<p>The ET3000 chip sells at an average price of $23, while
the ET4000 sells on average for $27.</p>
<p>Mr. Tseng said a computer-product trend toward denser
memory capacity is making data more difficult to retrieve.
This, he said, makes the ET4000 a more attractive product
because of its powerful memory architecture.</p>
<p>In addition, the company recently introduced the ET1700, a
lower-cost video chip aimed at the large market for
monochrome graphics. By adding the 1700 to its lineup, Tseng
Labs hopes to compete more effectively across both the color
and monochrome segments of the entry-level market.</p>
<p>At present, Tseng Labs says it has no debt and about $7
million in the bank. Any near-term expansion will be financed
with internally generated funds, Mr. Gibbons indicated. The
company doesn't anticipate any public offerings of securities
in the near future, he said.</p>
<p>Rather than develop a much wider variety of product lines,
Mr. Tseng said, the company "will continue to grow by
focusing on graphic and imaging applications." For the
forseeable future, he said, he anticipates that the ET3000,
ET4000 and their byproducts will provide the company with the
bulk of its business.</p>
<p>However, Tseng Labs does plan an entry soon into the
related market of laptop circuit-board products, a move that
probably will require an expanded sales and research effort.
Tseng said the company's lap-top chip currently in
development, called the ET4000LX, is expected to be available
late this year.</p>
