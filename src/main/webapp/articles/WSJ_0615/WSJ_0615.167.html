	<p class="article-leader">American and Israeli officials have finally admitted that
the Middle East peace process is dead. As a result, Secretary
of State James Baker asked the Israelis on Wednesday to set
down their realistic conditions for talking to the
Palestinians. But rather than wait for Israel to move,
Americans can get the ball rolling with some new ideas -- and
here is one.
   Stand back from the details of the Arab-Israeli conflict
and a remarkable symmetry becomes apparent: Palestinians want
from Israel what Israel wants from the Arab states --
recognition and legitimacy. Thus, Palestinians seek
concessions from Israel and Israel seeks concessions from the
Arab states. Conversely, the Arab states try to avoid direct,
public negotiations with Israel and Israel tries to avoid
such negotiations with the Palestinians. This symmetry
suggests a fruitful new approach to the Arab-Israeli
conflict.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>For over 40 years, Israelis have striven to get the Arab
states to accept first the existence and ultimately the
legitimacy of a Jewish state in Palestine. This central goal
of Israeli diplomatic and military policy has been crowned
with partial success, including a peace treaty with Egypt and
an acceptable working relationship with Jordan. But Hosni
Mubarak of Egypt warned Israel that its actions could "blow
up the peace march and put the whole region on the verge of a
new bloody confrontation," while Saddam Hussein of Iraq
recently threatened that "our fire shall devour one half of
Israel." And the Arab summit just held in Baghdad was the
most bellicose conclave in over a decade.</p>
<p>In public (in private is another matter entirely), Arabs
insist that Israel must accept a Palestinian state on land
now controlled by Israel. For decades, the Arabs have
resorted to every form of pressure, from terrorism to
diplomacy, to win this acceptance. Here too, some progress
has been made. Israel recognized Palestinian rights at Camp
David in 1978 and the Palestinian cause is the most visible
nationalist movement in the world, winning widespread
sympathy (even in Israel itself). Yet like Israel's quest,
the Arabs' is still unsuccessful. The PLO controls not an
inch of Palestine.</p>
<p>We see before us a parallelism of failure and frustration:
Israel cannot get what it wants from the Arab states, and the
Palestinians cannot get what they want from Israel. But this
very parallelism potentially offers opportunity. Resolution
of the Arab-Israel conflict in its entirety requires that
both aspirations be addressed, so why not yoke them together?</p>
<p>As an honest broker, the U.S. government should link
concessions to Israel by the Arab states with Israeli
concessions to the Palestinians. That is, when the Arab
states give Israel something it wants, Israelis should then
-- and only then -- be expected to give something in turn to
the Palestinians.</p>
<p>Trade-offs can be small or large. If, for example, the
Saudis would end their economic boycott of Israel, Israelis
could increase Palestinian access to underground water on the
West Bank. Damascus might reduce the size of its standing
army by 5% a year; in return, Jerusalem would cease to
establish new Jewish settlements in the occupied territories.
When Saddam Hussein signs a peace treaty with Israel, Yasser
Arafat would be invited to Jerusalem. And finally, when all
the Arab states sign peace treaties with Israel, the
Palestinians get their state.</p>
<p>These are merely hypothetical illustrations, for it is not
possible to predict what actual deals would be cut. It is
possible to predict, however, that the parties would spend
long hours trying to find a just balance. The devil is in the
detail; but that is fine, for hammering out quid pro quos
would be a constructive process, and one that could be
extended to most issues in the Arab-Israeli conflict,
including the compensation of refugees, Arab rights in
Israel, the control of territories and even the disposition
of Jerusalem.</p>
<p>Everyone would gain. The Arab states achieve what they say
is their main goal, justice for the Palestinians. Israel gets
peace. Palestinians have their state.</p>
<p>This new peace process bleaches out polemics. Rather than
concentrate on hypothetical intentions (has Mr. Arafat really
accepted Israel? Will the Israelis expel West Bank
residents?), it focuses on practical matters of
give-and-take. It places the burden of the initiative
squarely on the Arab states -- where it should be, for it is
Cairo, Damascus, Baghdad and the other capitals (and not
Israelis or Palestinians) that ultimately decide whether the
conflict continues or ends. If, as many suspect, the Arab
states are not really interested either in peace with Israel
or in a Palestinian state, this process gets that fact out in
the open.</p>
<p>Above all, this approach helps Israelis and Palestinians
to discover the vital interest they share in common: an end
to the Arab states' hostility to Israel. In the future,
Palestinians would exert pressure on the Arab presidents,
kings and emirs to make concessions to Israel -- and what a
startling change for the better that would be.</p>
<p>The Israelis have in effect already endorsed this plan. As
Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir told The Wall Street Journal
earlier this week, "Activity of the U.S. hasn't only to be
concentrated on talks with Palestinians: There has to be
effort also with Arab countries." It is now futile to address
Israeli or Palestinian aspirations in isolation. All the
pieces of the problem have to be wrapped together and dealt
with at the same time. The U.S. government should leave
behind the desultory efforts of past years and try something
with fewer risks and better chances of success.</p>
