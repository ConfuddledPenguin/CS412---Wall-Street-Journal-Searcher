	<p class="article-leader">BRUSSELS -- The European Community Commission rebutted
charges that it is using anti-dumping duties to erect trade
barriers against imports, especially from Asian nations.
   Presenting an annual report on anti-dumping
investigations, a spokesman for the commission said the
document proves that allegations the EC is using dumping
duties to "build a fortress Europe" are unfounded. Dumping is
the selling of a product in a foreign market at a price lower
than the home-market price or the cost of production. He said
EC dumping policies were "applied impartially to protect EC
industry against the practice of dumping, which is illegal
under GATT {the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, a
Geneva-based trade regulator}."</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The spokesman said the EC dealt with dumping cases from
state trading nations in Eastern Europe as frequently as from
Asia. In 1988, the year covered by the report, the EC opened
11 cases against Eastern European countries and the same
number of cases against Japan and South Korea together.</p>
<p>But EC dumping actions against Japan and South Korea in
recent years have sparked disputes, because they tended to
involve the lucrative consumer electronics industry, in which
European companies are struggling to stay competitive.
Dumping cases against Eastern Europe focus on metals,
chemicals and plastics.</p>
<p>Also, the commission has been accused by Japanese
companies, as well as some trade specialists, of using unfair
methods of calculation that lead to high dumping duties on
Japanese products. As a result, the EC is under pressure
within GATT to make its anti-dumping rules more transparent.</p>
<p>The report showed that 79 dumping investigations were
opened or under way during 1988, resulting in the imposition
of 18 definitive and 28 provisional duties.</p>
