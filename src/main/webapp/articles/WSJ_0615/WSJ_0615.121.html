	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Chock Full O' Nuts Corp. named 47-year-old
Marvin Haas a vice chairman of the coffee and food-service
company.
   The company's other vice chairman is George Rudy, who is
77. Leon Pordy, Chock Full's 70-year-old chairman and chief
executive officer, said that he has no plans to retire and
that Mr. Haas is "moving up the ladder." Mr. Haas has been
overseeing the Greenwich Mills food-service division in
Secaucus, N.J., and "and he's done very well," Dr. Pordy
said.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"We've really turned {the company} around," Dr. Pordy
said. "We've got earnings coming out this year that are
probably the highest in 10 years."</p>
<p>For many years, Chock Full O' Nuts concentrated on retail
coffee sales, and Dr. Pordy said it now is No. 4 in that
industry behind Philip Morris Cos.' Kraft General Foods,
which produces Maxwell House; Procter & Gamble Co., with its
Folger's brand; and Nestle S.A. But Chock Full now is also
one of the largest institutional food-service firms east of
the Mississippi River, he said.</p>
<p>In November 1988, the company acquired Jimbo's Jumbos
Inc., a processor and packager of peanuts, and "that's been a
very successful enterprise," Dr. Pordy said.</p>
<p>The balance sheet "looks good," he added. The company has
just $45 million of 8% bonds and $55 million of 7% bonds
outstanding, and $40 million in cash.</p>
