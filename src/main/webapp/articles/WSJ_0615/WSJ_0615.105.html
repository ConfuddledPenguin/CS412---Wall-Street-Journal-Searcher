	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- Senior members of the Bush administration
plan to send their Japanese counterparts a letter aimed at
boosting the stalled talks on the bilateral economic
relationship, administration officials said.
   The letter, which apparently is to be signed by Secretary
of State James Baker, Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady,
Commerce Secretary Robert Mosbacher, U.S. Trade
Representative Carla Hills, Council of Economic Advisers
Chairman Michael Boskin, and a senior Justice Department
official, is expected to be mailed early next week, the same
officials said.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The talks, being carried out under the Structural
Impediments Initiative, are stalled on several issues, most
importantly on Japanese spending on infrastructure. The U.S.
seeks a boost in Japanese infrastructure investment to 9% of
gross national product from 6.3% of GNP currently. The
Japanese maintain this would actually be an increase to 10%
from 7.3%, as the U.S. figures don't include investment in
telecommunications and some other investments.</p>
<p>There also are important differences between U.S. and
Japanese negotiators over penalties for violations of Japan's
antitrust rules, and over how to monitor enactment of the SII
recommendations.</p>
<p>The present plan is to mail the letter to six Japanese
ministers, the four chief Japanese negotiators in the SII and
the Japanese Fair Trade Commission.</p>
