	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- The Supreme Court ruled that police may set
up highway checkpoints in efforts to catch drunken drivers.
   By a 6-3 vote, the high court said checkpoints in which
police stop every car don't violate the Fourth Amendment's
protection against "unreasonable searches and seizures." In
an opinion written by Chief Justice William Rehnquist, the
court upheld a checkpoint set up in 1986 by the Michigan
State Police.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Use of checkpoints by state and local police has become
widespread in recent years as public attention on drunken
driving has heightened. Alcohol played a part in more than
23,000 traffic deaths in 1988 of a total of 47,000 traffic
fatalities, according to Transportation Department
statistics.</p>
<p>Estimates of checkpoint use vary. The National Commission
Against Drunk Driving, a private group, said several years
ago that police have used checkpoints in all 50 states and
the District of Columbia. But some state and federal
officials say the number of states using the checkpoints is
lower. A 1985 survey by Michigan officials found 36 states
using checkpoints. Thirty-one states filed a
friend-of-the-court brief in support of Michigan in the high
court.</p>
<p>The high court said that stopping a car at a checkpoint
falls within the legal definition of a "seizure," triggering
the protection of the Fourth Amendment. But the court
concluded that such a seizure isn't "unreasonable" for three
reasons: The states have a strong interest in curbing drunken
driving; checkpoints help achieve that aim, and the intrusion
on motorists is "slight."</p>
<p>The ruling is the culmination of a decade of legal
uncertainty created by an earlier high court ruling. In 1979,
the justices struck down a Delaware system of establishing
checkpoints and randomly selecting cars to be checked. The
court said random selection gave police officers too much
discretion without standards for exercising their authority.
"Questioning of all oncoming traffic at roadblock-type stops
is one possible alternative," the court suggested as an aside
in 1979.</p>
<p>Since then, according to Mothers Against Drunk Driving,
which hailed yesterday's decision, courts in 21 states have
upheld checkpoints while judges in 12 others have struck them
down. In Michigan, a state appeals court ruled that the
checkpoint, which was used on only one night, violated the
Fourth Amendment.</p>
<p>Yesterday's ruling should eliminate any uncertainty,
although in some states the checkpoints may still violate
privacy guarantees in state constitutions that are broader
than the Fourth Amendment.</p>
<p>Justice John Stevens dissented, joined by Justices William
Brennan and Thurgood Marshall. Challenging the majority's
conclusions, the dissenters said there isn't any evidence to
demonstrate that checkpoints are more effective than using
the same police manpower for traffic patrols.</p>
<p>And in an unusual and pointed reference to totalitarian
governments, the dissenters said: "Unannounced investigatory
seizures are, particularly when they take place at night, the
hallmark of regimes far different from ours." They also said
that alcohol use has been declining as a cause of traffic
fatalities for the past six years. (Michigan State Police

<p>Discounts for Wholesalers</p>
<p>The justices gave manufacturers more flexibility to charge
lower prices to wholesale distributors than to retailers in
the same market, as long as the discount is reasonably based
on services provided by the wholesalers.</p>
<p>But while establishing this flexibility, the justices
upheld a $1,349,700 jury verdict against Texaco Inc. for
illegal price discrimination against a dozen retail gasoline
dealers in the Spokane, Wash., area. In an opinion written by
Justice Stevens, the high court said the evidence showed that
Texaco's discounts to two wholesalers in Spokane weren't
related to any services performed by the companies.</p>
<p>The vote was 9-0 to uphold the verdict against Texaco and
6-3 to allow manufacturers to offer so-called reasonable
"functional discounts" to wholesalers but to deny them to
retailers.</p>
<p>Functional discounts are price reductions offered
generally to wholesalers for services they provide to
retailers that the manufacturer might otherwise have to
provide directly.</p>
<p>The Robinson-Patman Act, added by Congress to federal
antitrust law in 1936, generally makes it illegal to
discriminate in prices charged to different purchasers when
the effect is to reduce competition. However, the court
recognized that some functional discounts, although a form of
price discrimination, don't violate federal law.</p>
<p>Peter Fishbein, a New York lawyer who represented Texaco
in the high court, said the decision "is very significant"
and "makes it possible for suppliers to have dual
distribution systems of wholesalers and retailers and to
charge different prices to each." The ruling could affect a
range of manufacturing and production industries, from
gasoline and oil to auto parts.</p>
<p>In the Texaco case, the jury found in 1985, and a federal
appeals court in San Francisco agreed in 1988, that Texaco
violated federal law by giving a discount on gasoline to two
Spokane-area wholesalers. The wholesalers had a dual role,
distributing the gasoline to retailers and selling some of it
through their own retail outlets that competed directly with
independent Texaco retailers. The jury found that Texaco
discriminated because the wholesalers' retail outlets
received the discount while other retailers didn't.</p>
<p>The jury awarded the retail dealers $449,900, which was
tripled under federal law to $1,349,700.</p>
<p>Justice Byron White, in one separate opinion, and Justice
Antonin Scalia, joined by Justice Anthony Kennedy, in another
opinion, disagreed with the court's exception to the law for
"reasonable functional discounts." (Texaco Inc. vs.
Hasbrouck)</p>
<p>Clean Air Plans</p>
<p>The justices ruled that the Environmental Protection
Agency's failure to review a state's proposed changes in a
clean-air plan within a four-month deadline doesn't mean the
changes automatically take effect and the old standards can
no longer be enforced.</p>
<p>The ruling is a defeat for General Motors Corp., which was
sued by the EPA in 1987 for failing to comply with
Massachusetts clean-air standards adopted in 1980.
Massachusetts had already proposed changes in its plan that
gave GM more time to comply.</p>
<p>The Clean Air Act says the EPA should approve or reject
plan changes within four months. A federal judge dismissed
the EPA's lawsuit, ruling that the four months had lapsed,
that the plan changes were already in effect, and that the
EPA could no longer enforce the old standards. A federal
appeals court in Boston reversed the decision and said the
expiration of the four-month limit didn't bar the EPA from
enforcing the old standards.</p>
<p>In an opinion written by Justice Harry Blackmun, the high
court affirmed the appeals court ruling in favor of the EPA.
But the impact may be short-lived if Congress agrees on a new
Clean Air Act. (General Motors Corp. vs. U.S.)</p>
