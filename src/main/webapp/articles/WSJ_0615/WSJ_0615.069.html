	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Stock investors shifted their attention from
the hope for lower interest rates, which would spur the
economy, and bid prices lower amid a gathering gloom about
earnings.
   For the second day in a row, rising bond prices failed to
lead stocks higher. Part of the reason was news of
lower-than-expected profits at Digital Equipment and United
Telecommunications.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The Dow Jones Industrial Average eased 1.48 points to
close at 2928.22 in light trading. Broader market indexes
fell by wider margins. Standard & Poor's 500-stock index, for
example, declined 2 to 362.90.</p>
<p>Long-term U.S. Treasury bond prices rose nearly half a
point, or almost $5 for each $1,000 of face amount. In quiet
currency trading, the dollar rose against the mark and fell
against the yen, which was buoyed by higher Tokyo stock
prices.</p>
<p>Bond prices rose in overnight trading on news of another
big drop in gold that was caused, some said, by Arab selling.
Bonds eased after the U.S. producer price index, a measure of
wholesale inflation, came in close to expectations. But they
rose again in response to a broad decline of commodities
prices, which was seen as good news for inflation. Trading
was moderate.</p>
<p>But stock investors weren't paying attention, and instead
nursed their bottom-line blues. Adding to the list of bad
news about earnings were indications that problem loans will
continue to hurt the profits of banks, whose shares fell as a
result.</p>
<p>Banks also play a role in a larger -- and gloomier --
scenario outlined by Robert Stovall, president of money
manager Stovall/Twenty First Advisers. He says banks are
getting skittish about lending money as regulators grow
increasingly vigilant. Tough-to-get loans eventually will
affect earnings, which will begin to disappoint stock
investors.</p>
<p>"There is credit rationing on the part of wounded, gun-shy
banks," Mr. Stovall said. "It will inhibit profit growth."</p>
<p>The more immediate concern, said Carmine Grigoli, vice
president, equity research, at First Boston, is the specific
reports of declining earnings expectations. The disappointing
retail sales figures reported this week suggest "the economy
is alarmingly weak," he said, which will hurt profits more
than any credit crunch.</p>
<p>In major market action:</p>
<p>Stock prices eased in light trading, with 135.8 million
shares changing hands on the New York Stock Exchange.
Decliners led advancers, 917 to 560.</p>
<p>Bond prices climbed. The yield on the Treasury's benchmark
30-year bond eased to 8.34%.</p>
<p>The dollar was up against most other major currencies. In
late New York trading, the currency was quoted at 1.6935
marks and 154.17 yen, compared with 1.6865 marks and 154.75
yen Wednesday.</p>
