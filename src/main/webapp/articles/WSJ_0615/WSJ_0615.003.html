	<p class="article-leader">Forget about complicated tax initiatives. These days, the
hottest issue in state legislatures is easier for many
consumers to understand: disposable diapers.
   With space in municipal landfills growing scarce and no
relief in sight from the flood of trash from homes and
businesses, states are pinning their hopes on regulating
disposable diapers.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Already, some 20 states have pondered proposals that range
from disposable-diaper taxes to all-out bans of disposables.</p>
<p>Nebraska has approved a ban on non-degradable disposable
diapers, which is slated to take effect in 1993. Legislators
in Maine have passed a law requiring day-care centers to
accept children in cloth diapers; California may follow suit.
And New York is considering requiring all hospitals to
provide new mothers with brochures that warn of the
environmental threat posed by disposables.</p>
<p>Although only a handful of the legislative proposals have
been enacted, manufacturers are taking the threat very
seriously. Kimberly-Clark Corp., maker of Huggies, mobilized
100,000 Wisconsin parents this year to help defeat a state
bill that would have taxed disposables. Procter & Gamble Co.,
the largest maker of disposables, recently funded a
controversial study by Arthur D. Little, a consulting firm,
that concluded disposable diapers are less damaging to the
environment than cloth ones -- a contention strongly disputed
by environmentalists.</p>
<p>Disposable diapers make an appealing environmental target.
Unlike saving the Brazilian rain forests or halting acid
rain, diaper pollution is an issue that allows individuals to
play an active role in helping the environment. And, on one
level, diaper statistics sound alarming: The average tyke
goes through 7,800 diapers in the first 130 weeks of life.
Some 18 billion disposable diapers end up in landfills each
year.</p>
<p>"Diapers are a neat symbol of the crimes of our disposable
society," says Jerry Taylor, legislative director at the
American Legislative Exchange Council, a Washington-based
association of state legislatures.</p>
<p>But experts on both sides of the debate agree that
disposable diapers account for less than 2% of the nation's
garbage. Newspapers and magazines, for example, together
account for as much as five times that amount. Carl
Lehrburger, an Albany, N.Y., consultant who wrote a 1988
study that helped raise public concern about the problems
with disposable diapers, says diapers are far from the
biggest waste problem. While he supports reusable
alternatives to the throwaways, he says, "the issue has
gotten more attention than it deserves."</p>
<p>While disposable diapers may not be an environmental
disaster, they present their makers with a public-relations
nightmare.</p>
<p>P&G, whose Pampers and Luvs brands account for 50% of the
$3.5 billion U.S. disposable-diaper market, is aggressively
trying to improve its image with consumers and state
legislators. To assuage consumers, the company has sent out a
brochure touting the health benefits of disposable diapers --
they help keep babies dry and cut down on diaper rash -- as
well as pointing out that making and washing cloth diapers
also harm the environment. The company ran a full-page ad in
the Boston Globe pointing out that biodegradable diapers
don't actually break down in landfills. A company spokesman
says P&G doesn't plan to run further ads.</p>
<p>Most recently, P&G distributed to state legislators and
environmentalists the Arthur D. Little study that it
commissioned. The study compares the environmental impact of
cloth and disposable diapers over the lifetime of the
products-from manufacture through disposal. Among the
findings: Cloth diapers consume more energy and water than
their disposable counterparts. They also result in greater
air and water pollution emissions and cost more than
disposable diapers, even before cloth diaper-service costs
are included.</p>
<p>Mr. Lehrburger, however, maintains the Arthur D. Little
study is flawed because, among other things, it overestimates
the cost of laundering cloth diapers.</p>
<p>Kimberly-Clark is also working to get its message out and
stave off further regulatory efforts. The company has already
sent mailers defending disposables to all of its shareholders
along with its fourth-quarter results. Now, the Dallas-based
paper maker is planning to blitz parents across the U.S. with
a pro-disposables mailing.</p>
<p>Even some environmental activists say the diaper
industry's lobbying and public relations campaigns are having
an effect. In addition to Wisconsin, lobbying activities by
manufacturers helped defeat a California measure that would
have required an environmental warning label on all
disposable-diaper packages. A similar proposal was derailed
in New York.</p>
<p>"They've muddied the water enough to make it questionable
about what the solution should be," says Jeffrey Tryens, an
associate director of the Center for Policy Alternatives,
which helps states develop environmental and economic
policies.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, even diaper marketers concede the issue is
unlikely to disappear. Although diapers account for a
fraction of all waste, states are likely to welcome any
solution as the nation's garbage crisis worsens. And unlike
curbside recycling projects, banning or restricting diapers
doesn't require cities to build expensive facilities.</p>
<p>Many of the proposals introduced during the past year are
unlikely to surface again. Several states considered bans on
all but so-called degradable diapers, a concept that has been
discredited, since nothing breaks down in airtight,
moisture-proof landfills. But given the number and variety of
legislative initiatives introduced, some of the legislation
is likely to eventually pass into law. "The heat will
definitely continue for disposables," says Roger Bognar,
manager of the tissue paper division of the American Paper
Institute.</p>
<p>But so far, the environmental angst hasn't translated into
declining sales for disposable diapers. Despite environmental
concerns and little population growth, sales of disposable
diapers increased about 1.3% last year, according to Bonita
Austin, a consumer products analyst at Wertheim Schroeder &
Co.</p>
<p>Few consumers, it seems, are willing to sacrifice the
convenience of disposable diapers to save the planet.</p>
<p>Although Terry Edwards, who lives in suburban Chicago,
sorts her garbage into five separate bins to facilitate
recycling, she says she wouldn't consider using cloth diapers
on her four-month-old son. "I don't want smelly diapers
around my house," she says. "The diaper manufacturers should
come up with a better product or a better way to handle
them."</p>
