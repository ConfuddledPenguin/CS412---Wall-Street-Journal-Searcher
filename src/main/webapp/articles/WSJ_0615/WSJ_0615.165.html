	<p class="article-leader">UAL Corp. has a history of paying big bucks to attract
executives to its top job.
   When current Chairman Stephen M. Wolf signed on in
December 1987, UAL paid him $5.7 million to cover stock
options he lost when he left Tiger International Inc., in
addition to his $575,000 annual salary at UAL. The company
also paid him $35,000 in relocation fees and $8,000 for
"financial planning." Finally, Mr. Wolf received stock
options for 250,000 UAL shares, now worth considerably more
than three years ago.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Hertz Corp. Chairman Frank A. Olson, who preceded Mr.
Wolf, received a $1 million bonus in addition to a $616,000
salary for serving just six months as UAL's interim chairman
in 1987, as well as serving as chairman of Hertz, a unit of
UAL at the time.</p>
<p>But the sweetest deal of all is going to former Chrysler
Corp. Vice Chairman Gerald Greenwald, who stands to become
UAL chairman if United's three unions succeed in taking over
the airline. Mr. Greenwald was paid a $5 million fee just to
sign on last month with the union's buy-out effort.</p>
<p>If the buy-out succeeds, he will receive an annual salary
of $1.2 million for five years in addition to bonuses of $1.2
million a year. The unions also agreed to give him the
equivalent of a 1.5% stake in UAL. If the buy-out fails, Mr.
Greenwald is guaranteed a $4 million fee, in addition to the
$5 million he has already received, and a portion of his $1.2
million salary.</p>
<p>The unions say they had to compensate Mr. Greenwald for
benefits, including stock options, he lost by leaving
Chrysler. But Mr. Greenwald appears to stand to gain far more
at UAL than he left behind at Chrysler, where he earned $1.1
million last year. That's because the Chrysler stock options
he has received over the past three years were at prices
above the company's current share price.</p>
<p>"It doesn't seem like he walked away from much at
Chrysler," said Mike Halloran, an executive compensation
specialist at Towers Perrin, a New York consulting firm.</p>
<p>Mr. Greenwald disputed that he was giving up substantially
less at Chrysler than he was gaining at UAL. He said he and
the unions worked out a compensation plan that took into
consideration what he earned over the past five years at
Chrysler and what he could "reasonably expect to earn in the
next five years" as the probable successor to Chairman Lee A.
Iacocca. He added that any valuation of his stock options now
are invalid because most of the options run for 10 years and
no one can predict what the stock will be worth at a later
time.</p>
<p>UAL's unions agreed they took into account more than just
the compensation Mr. Greenwald was receiving from Chrysler
before he left. His UAL package, one official said, reflects
"what he realistically was giving up over a five-year
period." As heir apparent to Chrysler Chairman Lee Iacocca,
Mr. Greenwald was able to argue that his compensation was
likely to increase greatly at Chrysler over the next five
years.</p>
<p>Mr. Greenwald's retirement package at UAL is also reported
to be far better than his Chrysler plan. Mr. Greenwald will
reportedly receive $750,000 a year after retiring from UAL.
According to this year's Chrysler proxy, when the 54-year-old
executive left the auto maker, his accumulated pension
benefits would have totaled about $250,000 a year. If he had
stayed on the job another five years, he would have received
$500,000 a year in retirement.</p>
<p>Mr. Greenwald said that in devising the retirement plan,
he took into consideration what his pension would be if he
retired as late as age 65, not what it would be in five
years. He said he would also have been eligible for a
generous supplemental pension plan at Chrysler. However, he
declined to estimate specifically what his pension would have
been at the age of 65 if he had stayed at Chrysler.</p>
<p>Mr. Greenwald also lost three potential grants of
so-called performance shares when he left Chrysler. The
proxies don't disclose the size or value of those grants,
which were to have been made through 1992. But based on a
reading of the compensation plan's intent, a Towers Perrin
analyst said "it's unlikely" the grants would have totaled
more than $1.5 million.</p>
