	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- The federal government took legal action
that could shut down Marine Shale Processors Inc., operator
of the largest incinerator of hazardous wastes in the
country.
   The Justice Department and Environmental Protection Agency
filed a civil suit in federal court in Louisiana seeking a
permanent injunction against Marine Shale.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The privately owned Amelia, La., company, which claims to
use a revolutionary treatment process that can recycle
hazardous waste into a benign ash for use in landfills, also
faces penalties of up to $50 million, a Bush administration
official said.</p>
<p>The government claims the company is illegally operating
without a waste-treatment permit that requires strict
operating procedures. It challenges Marine Shale's argument
that it is exempt from hazardous waste-treatment regulations
because it is a recycler.</p>
<p>Government tests last year of ash samples from Marine
Shale turned up high levels of heavy metals, such as lead,
which officials are concerned could leak into groundwater.</p>
<p>An attorney for the company couldn't be reached for
comment. Besides claiming an exemption, Marine Shale
attorneys have said the company is deterred from seeking a
hazardous-waste permit because it would have to shut down for
three or more years while its application was being
processed.</p>
<p>The hazardous waste-treatment industry has been up in arms
over Marine Shale, whose cheaper rates have enticed away
business since 1985 from competitors such as Waste Management
Inc. and Rollins Environmental Services Inc. Major oil,
chemical and mining companies are among Marine Shale's
customers.</p>
<p>Last year, Marine Shale pleaded guilty to a
hazardous-waste felony count and other charges and paid a $1
million criminal fine.</p>
<p>In addition, a congressional panel held hearings into what
it called "sham recyclers," focusing on Marine Shale. Company
owner Jack Kent countered with television ads showing off his
treatment technology.</p>
