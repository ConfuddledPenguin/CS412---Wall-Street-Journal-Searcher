	<p class="article-leader">STOCKHOLM -- Sweden's consumer prices in May rose 0.6%
from April and 10.2% from a year earlier, Statistics Sweden,
the national statistics agency, said, citing mainly alcohol,
tobacco and food price increases.
   Consumer prices shot up 7% in the first five months of
this year, the agency said, and 2.9 percentage points of the
increase resulted from the major tax overhaul being gradually
introduced.</p>
