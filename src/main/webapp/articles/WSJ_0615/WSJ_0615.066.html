	<p class="article-leader">GOOD NEWS FOR EAST GERMANY</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The European Community Commission proposed to abolish all
trade restrictions between East Germany and the EC as soon as
possible ahead of formal German unification.</p>
<p>East German officials welcomed the plan for a "de facto
customs union," which would allow for free, two-way trade in
both industrial and agricultural goods. Both EC and West
German officials said that EC companies must rapidly gain
access to the East German market if they are to participate
in the country's economic reconstruction.</p>
<p>"It will help the establishment of a market economy" in
East Germany, said Dieter Funke, trade counselor at East
Germany's Brussels embassy. Christiane Scrivener, the customs
commissioner, said the plan "is one of the first concrete
signs of the community's commitment to the German unification
process."</p>
<p>The plan needs the approval of EC ministers, which
officials said is expected in the next few weeks.</p>
<p>AUSTRALIA-VIETNAM AGREEMENT</p>
<p>Australia signed an agreement with Vietnam to expand
investment and trade between the two nations. Australian
Industry, Technology and Commerce Minister John Button signed
the agreement after talks in Hanoi with Vietnamese Commerce
Minister Hoang Minh Thang. Mr. Button said two-way trade
between Australia and Vietnam had grown from 6.1 million
Australian dollars (US$4.7 million) in 1984 to A$99.6 million
last year. He said the agreement covered such areas as
infrastructure development, science, technology, transport,
tourism, banking, environment and education.</p>
<p>PEUGEOT IN BRAZIL</p>
<p>A delegation from Automobiles Peugeot S.A., the main unit
of France's Peugeot S.A., is in Brazil to discuss the
company's possible entry into the South American country, a
Peugeot spokesman said. He said the delegation is meeting
with Economics Minister Zelia Cardoso de Mello and other
officials "to talk about the rate of penetration into the
market, the mode of payments to the parent company, what will
be the {Brazilian} government's role, among other issues."</p>
<p>SOUTH KOREAN TV CHANGE</p>
<p>South Korea authorized the creation of a private
television station in an attempt to create competition in the
country's monopolized broadcast industry. Information
Minister Choe Byung Yul said restrictions on broadcast
frequencies would be lifted for the first time in 10 years to
set up a privately managed network and to secure fair and
autonomous broadcasting. He called the nation's current
broadcasting structure the product of an earlier military
government.</p>
<p>PROSPEROUS FRANKFURT</p>
<p>Frankfurt is Western Europe's most prosperous city,
followed by Brussels, Venice, Munich and Amsterdam, according
to a report by Prof. Paul Cheshire at Britain's University of
Reading. The study took into account gross domestic product,
unemployment and other factors and covered only European
Community cities with a minimum population of 300,000. The
professor said he didn't include Portugal and Greece because
they couldn't provide adequate figures. The three poorest
cities in the survey were all in Spain: Malaga, Cordoba and
Seville.</p>
<p>CHINA FIGHTS RISING CRIME</p>
<p>China exhorted its 1.1 billion people to inform on
criminals and announced a crackdown to combat rising crime.
The People's Daily newspaper quoted China's chief justice as
saying a "serious smashing" struggle had to be launched to
maintain social stability. The newspaper said there had been
126,900 crime cases in the first four months of this year --
a big increase over the same period last year. It did not
give last year's figures.</p>
<p>A BLOW FOR AIR CANADA</p>
<p>Britain's Court of Appeal upheld the right of customs
officers to seize airliners found to be carrying drugs, even
if the drugs are aboard without the airline's knowledge.</p>
<p>The court overturned an earlier ruling that customs
officers at London's Heathrow Airport acted unlawfully when
they impounded in 1987 an Air Canada plane after they found
730 pounds of cannabis in its cargo. The plane took off
before the drugs were found in the cargo it left behind but
was seized on its return a few days later. The airline had to
pay $85,000 in fines to recover the aircraft.</p>
<p>An Air Canada lawyer said the new ruling meant an airliner
on a scheduled flight could be seized if one passenger had a
cannabis cigarette. He said Air Canada would likely appeal
the judgment to the House of Lords.</p>
<p>"This judgment is important because it imposes an
impossible responsibility on an airline," the lawyer
concluded.</p>
<p>POSTSCRIPTS . . .</p>
<p>Hanover, West Germany, was chosen to be the site of the
Expo 2000 world fair. Hanover was selected by the Paris-based
International Bureau of Expositions in a 21-20 vote over
Toronto, the only other candidate after Italy this week
dropped a campaign on behalf of Venice. . . . A strike by
French air-traffic controllers disrupted the nation's air
transport yesterday, causing delays of between one and two
hours for international and domestic flights. The strike,
called to demand better pay and more staff, is due to end at
midnight tonight.</p>
