   Lolling in East Europe</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>NOT ONES TO MISS the latest trendy trip, the ultra rich
are jetting off to Eastern Europe. But not without their
creature comforts.</p>
<p>Travel agents report that the very wealthy -- apparently
tired of the plush surroundings of Palm Springs and Monte
Carlo -- are starting to invade the likes of Warsaw,
Leningrad and Prague. "It's definitely becoming a hot spot
for them," says Bill Fischer, president of Fischer Travel
Enterprises, a New York travel agency that deals exclusively
with the well-off.</p>
<p>By his client's standards (and these are people who drop
thousands of dollars a night for hotel rooms), the
accommodations in the East aren't quite up to snuff. Eastern
Europe has only a handful of super-fancy hotels and most of
them don't come close to the four-star hotels of the West. In
East Berlin, the Grand Hotel's best suite does cost more than
$2,000 a night, but that's an exception to the rule. Most
hotel suites in the East charge more in the range of $200 to
$300 a night.</p>
<p>"That's barely the tip these people might leave for a long
trip," Mr. Fischer chuckles.</p>
<p>But with a little effort, the super-affluent can travel
East in the style to which they're more accustomed. Many are
arriving in private jets, stocked with their favorite caviar,
travel agents say. To get around town, they're being driven
in Mercedes and BMWs that have been specially shipped in for
the occasion. Chauffeurs have been flown in, too, since
reliable, English-speaking drivers are a rarity in the East.</p>
<p>Some travel agents also say the rich like to have
one-on-one meetings arranged with residents in the East.
"They want to be able to come back and say, `Oh, I talked
with a real local,'" says Francis Goranin, president of Vega
International Travel Service in Chicago.

<p>Agent Takes His Cut,</p>
<p>Cutting Into Refunds</p>
<p>TRAVEL AGENTS are supposed to be a traveler's best friend.
But they may make a lot of enemies if they start following
the lead of one New York agency.</p>
<p>The agency, Barclay Travel Ltd., recently started
subtracting commissions on nonrefundable tickets that have
been refunded. Airlines sometimes make exceptions when a
traveler can't use a nonrefundable ticket and return the
money. But Barclay has been keeping 10% to 15% of its
clients' refunds in such cases.</p>
<p>The agency owner, Harry Barclay, argues that travel agents
deserve to be paid for the time they put in reserving and
booking tickets, regardless of whether the client actually
travels. He's also quick to point out that agents spend even
more time helping clients obtain refunds on nonrefundables.
"We were just losing too much on these tickets," he says.</p>
<p>Mr. Barclay insists that so far few clients have
complained, but acknowledges that one customer is suing him
in small-claims court, after the agency kept almost $100 in
commission on a refunded ticket.</p>
<p>Several travel agents say they are watching the case
closely, believing the practice could catch on if it's
allowed by the courts. "I think it could be a new trend in
the industry," says Richard Berns, a chapter president for
the American Society of Travel Agents.</p>
<p>If it does, some travel experts expect a lot of fliers to
grumble. "It's disgraceful," says Theodore Harris, chairman
of Airline Industry Resources, an airline consulting firm in
McLean, Va. "You're not taking the trip, so the service
really hasn't been performed."</p>
<p>The Hotel Phone Bite</p>
<p>Still Stings Overseas</p>
<p>PUBLIC PRESSURE has led many U.S. hotels to stop jacking
up phone charges. But the reform movement hasn't spread
outside this country.</p>
<p>In foreign countries, even established chains still
routinely impose huge surcharges on local or long-distance
calls. The London Hilton Hotel on Park Lane, for example,
charges $4 just to make a credit card call. Other hotels tack
on 20% to 30% surcharges on long-distance calls dialed
directly.</p>
<p>"It's price gouging, plain and simple," says Laurie
Berger, editor of Corporate Travel magazine, who recently got
socked with a $1,200 phone bill for a week's worth of calls
at a London hotel.</p>
<p>Some hotels argue that the rates have to be so high
because foreign phone systems are expensive to operate. But
other hotels concede they're trying to boost profits and
aren't the least bit apologetic. "If the management decides
that's how they want to make their money, I guess they can
charge what they want," says a spokeswoman for Hilton
International Inc., discussing the London Hilton.</p>
<p>To get around the charges, many travelers use special
credit cards, such as American Telephone & Telegraph's
USADirect card, that allow them to bypass hotel operators on
many long-distance calls.</p>
<p>Some companies are asking employees to use pay phones when
they can. "So far, we've had a good response," says Edward
Chu, travel director at Warner-Lambert. "They think the
charges are just too ridiculous for even the company to pay."</p>
<p>Odds and Ends</p>
<p>YOU DON'T HAVE to stay at Marriott Corp.'s Court yard
hotels anymore to know what a room looks like. In a new twist
to grab guests, Marriott's Courtyard has built a trailer with
a replica of one of its rooms inside, and is using it to tour
more than 20 cities over the next six months. . . . One out
of four drivers had a vehicle breakdown on the road last
year, says a Shell Motorist Club survey. But more breakdowns
took place in town, within three miles of the driver's home,
than out of town.</p>
