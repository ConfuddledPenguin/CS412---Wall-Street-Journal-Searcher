	<p class="article-leader">The bulls are back] In Tokyo, of all places.
   A growing herd of money managers and analysts are
predicting that the Japanese stock market, which earlier this
year looked like a meltdown, will turn into a meteor.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The Japanese market has already staged a surprising
recovery. After plunging 28% from its record peak of 38915.87
on the last trading day of 1989, the Nikkei Index of 225
leading stocks that trade on the Tokyo Stock Exchange
bottomed out at 28002.07 on April 2. Since then, the index
has risen almost 17%, closing yesterday at 32668.11.</p>
<p>That could be just a taste of what is ahead for Japanese
stocks, the bulls on Tokyo claim. Propelled by strong
economic growth, falling interest rates, lower inflation and
a stronger yen, the Nikkei Index will soar to 37000 to 40000
by year end, says Christopher Mitchinson, a managing director
and equity strategist at Salomon Brothers Inc. in London. If
the index hits 40000, the Nikkei would be up 22% from current
levels.</p>
<p>The "combination of strong domestic Japanese growth, a
strong yen and low inflation will lead to a rediscovery of
the virtues of the Japanese economy," Mr. Mitchinson says.
"The feeling we had in late 1989-early 1990 of a weak yen,
rising inflation and political and administrative disarray
will give way to a renewed vision of Japan as the strong,
stable economy."</p>
<p>Some analysts admit it's ironic that people are again
forecasting highs for the Tokyo stock market -- less than
three months after a major collapse of Japanese share prices
and after years of apprehension that the stocks were way
overvalued.</p>
<p>Surprisingly, the traditional roles of foreign and
Japanese securities firms are reversed these days. Before the
Tokyo market plunged, foreigners were the Cassandras, always
predicting an imminent stock market collapse. By contrast,
Japanese analysts were the Pollyannas, constantly predicting
endless highs.</p>
<p>No more. With many foreigners preaching recovery, Japanese
investment experts are showing uncommon prudence.</p>
<p>"The Japanese market will recover its peaks eventually,"
says Shoji Yamada, Tokyo-based general manager and chief
investment officer of Yasuda Trust & Banking Co. "But it's
not easy for the market to change to a bull sentiment after
the crash. It will take a year and half or more."</p>
<p>At Nikko Securities Co., Mikio Fujino, a salesman in
Tokyo, tells his clients that he expects the market to
continue consolidating for several months before it moves
higher. "We still are cautious," he says.</p>
<p>Indeed, after the Nikkei's close at 33130.80 on May 31,
the Tokyo market has mostly treaded water this month.</p>
<p>Conceding that the Tokyo stock "market is impossible to
time equity investments in," Francis Finlay, chairman and
chief executive officer of Globe Finlay Inc., a New York
money management firm, nevertheless says: "The Japanese
economy is probably the best managed economy in the world."</p>
<p>He warns: "You can't totally ignore one of the largest
markets in the world. You avoid Japan at your peril in the
1990s; the question is when one raises one's exposure not
whether."</p>
<p>Mr. Mitchinson of Salomon Brothers thinks the time is now.
He says that a weak U.S. economy will lead to lower U.S.
interest rates, which in turn will lead to lower Japanese
rates. Lower bond yields usually increase stocks' appeal by
making them a more competitive investment.</p>
<p>Mr. Mitchinson adds that Japan has "very good inflation
figures" and "has undergone the biggest peacetime investment
boom the world has ever seen." What's more, his firm sees the
dollar falling to 140 yen by year end, or by about 9%.</p>
<p>Another bull, Philip Dodds, head of research at S.G.
Warburg Securities Ltd. in Tokyo, admits that the Japanese
market's valuations are approaching high levels again -- the
gap between the yield on Japanese government bonds and the
yield on stocks' earnings is a steep 4.9%. Still, he
forecasts the Nikkei will recover to nearly 37000 by year's
end.</p>
<p>Akira Suzuki, a strategist at Morgan Stanley Group Inc.'s
Tokyo office, says the index could climb as high as 38000
next month. So far, both he and Salomon's Mr. Mitchinson have
strong credentials. They were among the first to recommend
that clients bail out of Japanese shares in early January and
among the first to advise buying back in April.</p>
<p>In addition, Mr. Finlay of Globe Finlay feels that money
managers might be getting a bit nervous about their large
European equity holdings, following the huge run-ups, some of
which began last year, in the German, Austrian, French and
Scandinavian markets.</p>
<p>But more-bearish Japanese firms see plenty to worry about.
For one thing, they are concerned that a lot of stock bought
on margin, or credit, will be sold this month. Japanese
individuals were net buyers of 626 billion yen ($4.05
billion) in stock during March, just before the market hit
bottom. Much of that stock was bought with credit, and
investors are required to pay up their borrowings within
three months of buying stock on margin.</p>
<p>There is also the prospect that new issues of stock, which
will resume next month for the first time since March, could
sop up cash from the market. This past year, Japanese
companies issued about 22 trillion yen ($142.63 billion) in
stock or stock-linked financings. These were so big a drain
that Japanese brokerage firms voluntarily stop underwriting
new issues in March.</p>
<p>The prospect of a flood of postponed issues coming to
market is still remote, though; many Japanese companies say
they will hold off until they are sure the market can
comfortably absorb new calls for capital.</p>
<p>Worries about the amount of cash in the Tokyo market is
behind the wary forecast of one foreign firm that is bearish,
Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. "The liquidity situation remains
poor," says Shearson analyst Pelham Smithers. Japanese
investment trusts, he notes, have been net sellers in the
market in recent days, a sign that some individuals may be
taking money out of the market.</p>
<p>Money managers say the two all-important questions for
international investors in Japanese shares are timing and
deciding where to get the money from. "The sole strategic
decision from an equity viewpoint for 1990 is: When do you
increase your weight for Japan?" says Henry de Vismes, head
of international investments for Citibank's private bank.
"The person who does that {right} will be at the top of the
performance tree for 1990."</p>
<p>Mr. de Vismes suggests that portfolio managers could take
profits from the U.S. stock market, where he says prospects
for growth and corporate profits are relatively poor. He says
the managers could also sell shares in European and smaller
Far Eastern markets that have already had good run-ups:
France, Germany, Sweden, Norway, Malaysia and Singapore.</p>
