	<p class="article-leader">It has taken less than a week after Californians voted
narrowly to raise the gasoline tax with Prop. 111 for the
state's top Democrats to go whole-hog on taxes. As the
cornerstone of a $2.3 billion tax package (the Gann spending
limit won't allow any more than that), the Democratic
chairmen of the Legislature's fiscal committees want to raise
the upper income-tax bracket to 11% from 9.3%. Apparently,
revenue growth of 7% annually hasn't kept pace with spending,
so there's a big deficit and the liberal reflex is to try to
soak many of the state's most productive residents further.
Even after Prop. 111's win, however, the Big Democratic Tax
Sponge may find California a pretty dry state.
