	<p class="article-leader">EINDHOVEN, the Netherlands -- N.V. Philips, struggling to
regain credibility in the midst of a management shake-up,
warned that its second-quarter profit will fall "appreciably"
and that full-year results will be "very low."
   The Dutch electronics giant's warning sent its shares down
5% when trading opened Thursday on the Amsterdam Stock
Exchange. The shares closed at 32.10 guilders ($16.89), down
from 33.60 guilders Wednesday.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Analysts said the warning wasn't surprising, given the
company's weak first-quarter results and the likelihood that
the new management team wants to get all of the bad news out
as quickly as possible. "The company is in a heavy storm,"
Fabian Koning of Bank Mees & Hope N.V. said.</p>
<p>Philips said its second-quarter warning was based on the
company's performance in April and May, but it refused to
elaborate on where the problems lay. In last year's second
quarter, the company had profit before extraordinary items of
197 million guilders.</p>
<p>For the year, Philips said, provisions for restructuring
costs will cause the company's "net result" to be "at a very
low level." A spokesman declined to comment on whether this
means a loss is possible. Philips had 1989 profit of 1.37
billion guilders, on sales of 57.22 billion guilders, but
much of the earnings reflected the sale of a Paris building
and other one-time items.</p>
<p>Analysts said second-quarter results probably are being
hurt by continued losses in the computer division and by a
sudden drop in sales in Brazil, where economic austerity
measures are putting severe limits on consumer spending. "The
Brazilian consumer just stopped buying," Chris Honnor, an
analyst at Kleinwort Benson Securities in London, said. Latin
America accounted for 18% of Philips's operating profit last
year, and Brazil is the company's main market in that region.</p>
<p>Philips promised more details about results on July 2,
when shareholders are to meet in Eindhoven to approve a new
management lineup. In the most important change, Cornelis van
der Klugt will step down as chairman July 1, a year ahead of
schedule, to make way for Jan Timmer, head of the consumer
products division.</p>
<p>Mr. van der Klugt resigned to take responsibility for a
loss of investor confidence, resulting from the company's
failure to warn of a collapse in first-quarter profit before
extraordinary items to six million guilders from the
year-earlier 223 million guilders. When that result was
posted May 3, Philips shares tumbled 11%. A group of U.S.
holders later filed a lawsuit against Philips, alleging the
company had misled investors about its prospects. Philips has
declined to comment on the merits of the suit, but it seems
determined to improve its record on earnings forecasts.</p>
<p>Philips has long been notorious for springing nasty
surprises on the stock market. Only two months ago, the
company was still predicting 1990 profit would rise.</p>
<p>The company's biggest problem areas recently have been in
semiconductors and computers, which produced what Philips
described as "hundreds of millions of guilders" in losses
last year.</p>
<p>Analysts believe Philips is burdened by large inventories
of computers at a time when margins are being squeezed
severely. They also say Philips is probably losing market
share, as its well-publicized problems shake customer
confidence.</p>
<p>Earlier this week, Philips said it had ended talks on
cooperating with Ing. C. Olivetti & Co. of Italy in the
computer business. Philips said it was still talking to other
possible partners. Many analysts argue that the company's
computer division is too small and unfocused to survive on
its own.</p>
<p>Dataquest Europe estimated Philips's share of the European
personal computer market at 2.2% in 1989. Philips doesn't
provide separate revenue figures for computers, but IDC
Nederland put Philips's European sales of personal computers,
minicomputers, printers, software and related products last
year at about $1.7 billion. Nearly all of the company's
computer sales are in Europe.</p>
<p>In the semiconductor area, Philips has been hit by an
industrywide slump and slower-than-expected sales of its
one-megabit static random access memory chips, in which it
has invested heavily.</p>
<p>Analysts are eagerly awaiting the July 2 meeting, in hopes
that Mr. Timmer, the chairman-designate, will explain how he
intends to turn the company around. Kleinwort's Mr. Honnor
said the new management team is likely to try to "clear the
decks" by making heavy provisions for restructuring costs
this year, setting the company up for better results in 1991.</p>
<p>In the past three years, Philips spent a total of 1.34
billion guilders to cover early retirements, plant closings
and other restructuring costs. And it closed about 75
factories, bringing the world-wide total to about 350. The
work force has fallen to 300,000 from 342,000 in 1987, partly
through the sale of operations.</p>
<p>Though Philips has been trying to focus its activities
better, it still makes a huge array of products, including
lamps, stereo equipment, compact disks, television sets,
clocks, vacuum cleaners, garage-door openers, printed circuit
boards, military equipment and medical-diagnostic imaging
products.</p>
