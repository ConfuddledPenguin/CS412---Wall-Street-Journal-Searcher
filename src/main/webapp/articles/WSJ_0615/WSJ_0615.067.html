	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- Producer prices rose 0.3% in May, reversing
a three-month period of decline but suggesting inflation is
likely to continue at a moderate pace.
   The Labor Department said the May increase followed drops
of 0.3% in April, 0.2% in March and 0.1% in February. Much of
May's rise was due to a 0.6% jump in consumer food prices
following declines of the same magnitude in both April and
March.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Some analysts had speculated earlier this year that the
Federal Reserve might be compelled to boost interest rates to
curb inflation. But even with the May rise, economists
generally believe price rises currently are mild and that
restrictive action by the Fed is unwarranted.</p>
<p>"The Fed shouldn't react specifically to this report; that
is, we don't expect them to raise interest rates," said
Mickey Levy, chief economist for First Fidelity Bancorp in
Philadelphia.</p>
<p>Ron Schreibman, an economist for the National Association
of Wholesale Distributors, said, "The trend in inflation is
clearly downward." He noted that producer prices rose 4.9%
for all of 1989, while they climbed at annual rate of just 4%
from January through May of this year.</p>
<p>But Donald Ratajczak, an economist for the Economic
Forecasting Center at Georgia State University in Atlanta,
asserted, "There is still a modest underlying degree of
inflation lingering around." He predicted that the Fed would
"just sit and wait for more information, just as they have
been doing for the past few months."</p>
<p>Some economists cautioned that it's difficult to predict
the course of inflation based on the latest price report.
"The finished goods index is up after three months of
decline. The overall 12-month index is about half of what it
was in January. And core producer inflation was the same as
in April and nearly what it has been since October," said
Lawrence A. Hunter, deputy chief economist for the U.S.
Chamber of Commerce. "The only thing that is clear from
today's report is that trying to predict inflation from
short-term producer price movements is all but impossible."</p>
<p>Energy prices last month continued their decline following
a sharp rise in January, when a bitter cold wave chilled much
of the nation. They fell 1% last month after dropping 1.7% in
April, 2.4% in March and 4.9% in February.</p>
<p>Excluding food and energy prices -- an approach many
economists believe better indicates price pressures in the
economy because those categories are highly volatile -- the
department's producer price index for finished goods rose
0.2% in May.</p>
<p>The producer price index measures the prices factories and
other producers receive for their goods. It doesn't include
prices for services.</p>
<p>Separately, the Commerce Department reported that business
inventories inched up 0.1% in April, while sales plunged
1.1%.</p>
<p>The combination meant it would have taken 1.49 months to
sell off the stock of manufacturers, retailers and merchant
wholesalers at April's sales pace, slightly higher than
March's 1.47 inventory-to-sales ratio.</p>
<p>Despite the rise, the ratio remained at a level that
indicates businesses are still managing inventories
successfully. If businesses misjudge sales, inventories may
pile up to the point that managers are forced to cut back on
production, orders and labor. Federal Reserve Board Chairman
Alan Greenspan has credited careful control of inventories as
one of the main reasons why the country has avoided a
recession for nearly eight years.</p>
<p>According to the report, business sales totaled $533.04
billion in April, while inventories stood at $794.46 billion.</p>
<p>The numbers were adjusted for seasonal variations.</p>
