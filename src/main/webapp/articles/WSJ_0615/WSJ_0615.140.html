	<p class="article-leader">Greater New York Savings Bank, New York, said its board
adopted a shareholder rights plan to prevent a hostile
takeover.
   The rights plan goes into effect if a holder acquires 20%
or more of Greater New York's shares, and would entitle other
holders to purchase common with a value of twice the right's
exercise price.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>In a letter to shareholders, Charles J. Ohlig, chairman of
the thrift, said the plan isn't intended to prevent an
acquisition on terms that are favorable to all shareholders.</p>
<p>Greater New York last year adopted a leveraged employee
stock ownership plan to increase the cost of an unwanted
takeover proposal by Emigrant Savings Bank. Greater New York,
with assets of $3 billion and deposits of $2.2 billion, has
offices in the metropolitan area.</p>
<p>In national over-the-counter trading yesterday, Greater
New York shares closed at $6.375, down 37.5 cents.</p>
