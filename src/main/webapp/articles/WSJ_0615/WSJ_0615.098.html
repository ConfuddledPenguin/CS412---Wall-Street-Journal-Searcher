	<p class="article-leader">From time to time, we have been tempted to think that the
real reason God created the Middle East was so that U.S.
Secretaries of State would learn humility. This mysterious
machinery seems to have taken hold of Secretary of State Jim
Baker Tuesday, when he threatened to withdraw from what is
always called "the Middle East peace process" unless Israel
became more willing to negotiate on his terms. He even gave
out the White House phone number for the Israelis to call, a
diplomatic initiative that so far has resulted in about 8,000
non-Israeli calls to the White House switchboard. White House
operators are now giving callers the number of the State
Department.
   The proximate cause of this latest turn in the world's
longest-running drama is the formation days ago of a new
Israeli government, denounced as a "war cabinet" in various
Arab precincts. In fact, the new Shamir coalition is nothing
more than a resolution to the country's three-month political
crisis. It was born out of a necessity to establish a working
government that can last at least until the next elections in
1992.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>In essence, the Israeli Knesset has simply voted no
confidence in existing peace proposals. On that basis, it was
possible to form a government. That is not good news for
Syria's Mr. Assad or Iraq's Mr. Hussein, who no doubt prefer
a divided government.</p>
<p>Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir's move represents a blunt
appraisal of "peace" proposals being put forth from inside
and outside Israel. As we have said here before, it is not
evident how any of them promises peace so long as there are
no grounds to believe that Yasser Arafat and the leaders of
Iraq, Syria and Libya share that goal.</p>
<p>Certainly, Israel is insistent on absorbing as many Jews
as the Soviets will allow to emigrate. The immigration has
depressed Palestinian hopes of Israel ultimately having more
Arabs than Jews in its population. But to think of the Soviet
refugees as a threat to the Arab world stretches credibility.</p>
<p>The claim that the new government will oppose all
plausible chances for peace further stretches credibility.
Why should Israel not want peace? Its constant state of
siege, most recently manifested in a foiled Arab raid aimed
at crowded Tel Aviv beaches, is costly both to the national
consciousness and the Israeli economy.</p>
<p>The U.S. government displays some discomfort over the
latest turn of events, but in some sense it is off the hook.
Clearly its 1988 guidelines for establishing a dialogue with
the PLO -- which called on the PLO to abjure terrorism --
were unrealistic. Until the recent raid, the Bush
administration was able to pretend not to notice more than 18
attempted terrorist attacks on Israel by groups represented
on the PLO's executive committee. It can no longer ignore the
Arafat double-cross. The experience may provide a dose of
realism.</p>
<p>We remain convinced that these troubles will continue
until Israel, not to mention its neighbors, supplants
socialism with a free-market economy. People, after all,
whether Israeli or Palestinian, have to work, and the current
economic structure of the region offers sparse incentives.</p>
<p>Secretary Baker may yet decide that he must reinsert
himself in the middle of Israel's difficulties with its
unfriendly neighbors. It might be the better course if he
made good on his threat to withdraw awhile.</p>
