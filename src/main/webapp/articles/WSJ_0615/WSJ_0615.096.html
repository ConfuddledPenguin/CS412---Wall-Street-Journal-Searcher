	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- The House Agriculture Committee, working
into the wee hours yesterday, wrapped up a $55 billion,
five-year farm bill after resolving a knot of contentious
environmental issues.
   The lawmakers adopted a new soil- and water-conservation
policy for the 1990s, with pledges from leading farm and
environmental groups that they will support on the House
floor key provisions regarding water quality and wetlands
protection.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Following the final voice vote, Chairman Kika de la Garza
(D., Texas) described the legislation as providing "a
reasonable safety net for farm income while recognizing
budget constraints."</p>
<p>Outlays for milk-price supports are projected to push the
overall five-year cost above the $53 billion spending limit
in the House budget resolution. But committee staffers said
the $55 billion package would still be consistent with the
Senate Budget Committee guidelines, which House lawmakers
expect to follow in the event of a deficit-reduction
agreement between Congress and the White House.</p>
<p>In the conservation part of the mammoth bill, money would
be paid to farmers for putting highly erodible or
environmentally sensitive land in the nation's Conservation
Reserve, which the lawmakers voted to expand to 45 million
acres from the current authorized level of 40 million.
Currently, 34 million acres of crop and range land are
enrolled in the reserve.</p>
<p>The committee agreed to clarify and modify controversial
provisions in the so-called swamp-buster law, which limits
the conversion of wetlands to agriculture. Under a compromise
embraced by environmental and farm groups, farmers would be
allowed to drain small wetlands that are of minimal value to
wildlife. In addition, they could drain wetlands that hamper
farming operations, but only if they "mitigated" the losses
by restoring other drained wetlands on their farm to their
natural state.</p>
<p>At the same time, committee members decided to set up a
voluntary water-quality program under which farmers could
collect incentive payments of up to $5,000 a year for
changing their farming practices to curb contamination of
wells and water courses. They also adopted a plan for
creating a national agricultural wetlands reserve to preserve
prairie "potholes" and other habitats for migratory
waterfowl. Under the plan, the government would purchase
perpetual easements on the wetlands from rural landowners.</p>
<p>The lawmakers, suppressing a political urge to boost
subsidies, agreed to freeze target prices at current levels
-- wheat at $4 a bushel, corn at $2.75, barley at $2.36 and
oats at $1.45 -- for the next five years. Target prices for
cotton and rice would be frozen at 72.9 cents a pound and
$10.71 per hundred pounds, respectively. Under the farm
program, the government pays farmers subsidies if market
prices fall short of target prices.</p>
<p>The committee also reauthorized price-support programs for
sugar, peanuts, honey, wool and mohair producers. When the
bill reaches the floor, probably in early July, all of these
programs are expected to come under attack from a growing
group of lawmakers, including Reps. Richard Armey (R., Texas)
and Charles Schumer (D., N.Y.), who consider them to be
unfair to consumers. The group will also seek limits on
subsidy payments.</p>
<p>"Too much of the farm budget is going to wealthy corporate
farms, not enough to family farms," Messrs. Armey and Schumer
said in a statement.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the Senate Agriculture Committee, after days of
partisan bickering, resumed works on its version of the 1990
farm bill. But Democrats and Republicans still appeared
stalemated over the big-ticket commodity programs,
particularly the issue of loan rates. Caught in the middle is
committee Chairman Patrick Leahy (D., Vt.). He and Indiana
Sen. Richard Lugar, the ranking Republican member, thrashed
out a compromise earlier this week, but the Democrats have
balked at embracing it.</p>
<p>Sen. Lugar has threatened to create political havoc on the
floor if the committee doesn't forswear so-called budget
gimmicks and freeze target prices, loan rates and land-idling
requirements. Yesterday, he gave his colleagues a taste of
what they might expect later by attacking the sugar
price-support program and proposing two amendments -- one
abolishing the program and the other reducing the support
levels. Both were defeated.</p>
<p>The House bill, meanwhile, would for the first time
establish a marketing-loan program for producers of soybeans
and other oilseed crops, but with the proviso that it
operates at no cost to the government.</p>
<p>The measure also would increase food-stamp benefits
slightly for the poor, reauthorize several agricultural
export-promotion programs, and earmark $2.5 billion a year in
export-credit guarantees to help "emerging democracies" in
Eastern Europe buy U.S. foodstuffs.</p>
<p>In addition, the bill would set the current milk-support
price of $10.10 per hundredweight as the floor price for the
next five years. The dairy industry had sought a floor of
$10.60. Under the bill, the support price could be boosted in
response to fluctuations in government-owned surpluses of
dairy products, but in no case could fall below $10.10.</p>
