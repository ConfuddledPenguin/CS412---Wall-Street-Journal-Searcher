	<p class="article-leader">British Steel PLC, seeking to reduce its dependence on the
glutted U.K. market, is eager to buy a North American
steelmaker.
   British Steel, which was privatized in late 1988, said it
has up to #500 million ($855.9 million) in cash and is
willing to leverage 30% of its #4 billion equity for future
acquisitions. That would translate roughly into about #2
billion to spend on expansion.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The company declined to specify targets, but didn't rule
out any steelmaking candidate. "Our radar is operating on
all" steel manufacturers, said Chairman Sir Robert Scholey.</p>
<p>Analysts say the company is interested in strong
management and value-added products, such as coated and
painted sheets of steel, used for construction and
automobiles. They believe the most likely targets are
integrated steelmakers wanting to spin off certain plants, as
opposed to smaller minimills, most of which concentrate on
less-profitable bar, wire and rod products.</p>
<p>One obvious possibility: USX Corp.'s steel operations,
which investor Carl Icahn unsuccessfully urged the company to
spin off. In the early 1980s, British Steel had discussed a
joint venture at USX's Fairless Hills, Pa., plant, but that
proposal fell through.</p>
<p>Sir Robert said that while he watched the recent proxy
fight at USX with interest, "we're not interested in Mr.
Icahn's stock." And USX's entire steel operations would most
likely be too large to swallow, he said.</p>
<p>Still, USX expects to spin off some of its steel
operations or form joint ventures with other companies. "A
lot of companies are looking at that possibility," said
Christopher Plummer, an analyst with WEFA Group. He also
noted that the only major steelmaker without a foreign
partner is Bethlehem Steel Corp., which recently said it
wouldn't rule out a joint venture.</p>
<p>British Steel, which currently is consolidating its U.K.
operations, initially targeted neighboring Europe for growth.
It has discussed buying operations in both Spain and West
Germany. However, negotiations have been slow and
frustrating, partly because of government constraints, and
British Steel has yet to complete a deal.</p>
<p>Now, Sir Robert said the company wants to wait "while the
climate stabilizes" in Europe, and has turned attention to
North America, where free enterprise offers a better cultural
fit.</p>
<p>British Steel, widely regarded as one of the world's most
profitable and efficient steelmakers, believes it can make
North American steelmakers more cost efficient. Moreover, the
company, which outspends North American steelmakers in
research and development, could also provide advanced
technology and help to develop the fledgling export market.</p>
<p>Its desire for a North American steelmaker with a strong
management team indicates the company wouldn't be interested
in a hostile bid.</p>
<p>WEFA Group's Mr. Plummer says he knows of several other
cash-flush European steelmakers eyeing North America. The
problem, he said, is that the Japanese have already snagged
the more profitable operations through joint ventures,
especially in the coated sheet operations -- a British Steel
mainstay. Likewise, most major Canadian steelmakers have
Japanese partners.</p>
<p>But British Steel produces a wider variety of products
than most U.S. steelmakers, Mr. Plummer noted, which makes
finding a complementary product fit easier. One area of
strength, he said, is the sections market, which produces
steel to make machinery and equipment.</p>
<p>Charles Bradford, an independent steel analyst, believes
there is too much capacity in the U.S. structural market,
also a British Steel stronghold. The problem will increase
when two minimills come on line within a year to produce
structural steel. Brian Moffat, British Steel's managing
director, finance, said the company can expand the structural
market by improved and aggressive marketing to the
construction trade.</p>
<p>The big obstacles to a North American acquisition are
environment, health, pension issues and current labor
contracts. At British Steel, blue collar workers aren't paid
a flat hourly rate, and 37% of their compensation is tied to
incentives and company performance, Mr. Moffat said. Such
terms might be tough to sell to the United Steelworkers of
America.</p>
<p>Health and pension costs are more fully funded in Canada,
which may make steelmakers there more attractive. British
Steel said it wasn't interested in buying a Mexican
steelmaker.</p>
