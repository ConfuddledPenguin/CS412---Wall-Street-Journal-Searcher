	<p class="article-leader">Consolidated Natural Gas Co., Pittsburgh, said it plans to
invest $48 million in underground natural-gas storage
facilities, following approval of the plan by the Federal
Energy Regulatory Commission.
   Consolidated, a large producer, transporter and
distributor of natural gas, said it will equip depleted gas
wells to store sufficient gas for six retail gas distributors
to provide 38 million cubic feet of gas daily during peak use
periods beginning in 1991. Additional storage is to be
provided four of the companies in 1992, adding capacity for
41 million cubic feet of gas daily. The retail distributors
would own the gas.</p>

of storage service for Texas Eastern Transmission Corp. in
1992, the company said.</p>
