	<p class="article-leader">NETWORK GENERAL Corp. said its board approved a 100% stock
dividend. The Menlo Park, Calif., maker of diagnostic
equipment for computer networks said the dividend is
contingent on shareholder approval of a proposal to increase
authorized common shares to 50 million from 10 million.
Holders will vote on the proposal at the annual meeting Aug.
2. If that measure passes, the dividend will be distributed
around Aug. 20 to stock of record Aug. 3. The company said
that after the dividend is distributed, it will have about
14.2 million shares outstanding.</p>
