	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- The three major broadcast networks are closing
ranks in the battle over viewer-measurement practices by
uniformly adopting a plan to reduce the audience size they
guarantee to advertisers.
   Yesterday, CBS Inc. and Capital Cities/ABC Inc. announced
they will adopt a plan proposed earlier this week by the NBC
network. Under the NBC plan, the networks would project
audience size for the new TV season, which begins in
September, by using an average of audience levels over the
last eight years. The networks will make audience-size
guarantees to advertisers based on the projections rather
than based solely on ratings from A.C. Nielsen Co., as they
have in the past.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The network moves come as advertisers are preparing to
enter the projected $4.4 billion "up-front" market, when
commercials are purchased in advance of the 1990-91
television season. Because the Nielsen ratings showed an
unexplained, steep drop in TV viewership of about 7% earlier
this year, the networks had to shell out as much as $200
million in "make goods," or free advertising for sponsors
when audience guarantee levels fell below network
projections.</p>
<p>To avoid having to pay millions back to advertisers, the
three networks have been seeking to change the system by
which they guarantee audience size. Advertisers view with
alarm any change in the audience-guarantee system; some
advertisers said they will attempt to negotiate lower prices
for ads, characterizing the networks' move as, in effect, a
price increase. Also, advertisers said they will consider
redirecting millions of dollars usually spent on network TV
to other places, such as cable TV.</p>
<p>"The networks could see a lot of money walking out and
redirected into other media," said Jon Mandel, senior vice
president and director of national broadcast for Grey
Advertising Inc.</p>
<p>But advertisers have threatened to abandon the networks
before, only to ultimately increase the amount they spend.
And advertising executives acknowledge they have little
choice but to continue to spend heavily on network television
to reach large national audiences. "Even though we don't like
this departure from tradition, you have to admit you still
reach millions of people at once through network TV," said
John Sisk, senior vice president of network negotiating at J.
Walter Thompson Co., a unit of WPP Group.</p>
<p>The proposal to change the system was suggested earlier
this week by No. 1-rated National Broadcasting Co., a unit of
General Electric Co. ABC dropped an earlier proposal of its
own in favor of the NBC plan, and CBS, which had been mulling
over prospects, said late yesterday that the NBC plan "in
principle, is acceptable to us."</p>
<p>News Corp.'s Fox Broadcasting Co. network, which will
increase its broadcast to five nights from three beginning in
September, said it would continue to guarantee viewing levels
for advertisers.</p>
<p>Fox is expected to benefit financially from adhering to
traditional audience-guarantee methods. Last year, Fox
received about $350 million in up-front sales. This year,
that number could easily double, according to industry
officials.</p>
<p>The networks contend that Nielsen's button-pushing people
meter, the main method it uses to compile ratings, is
inaccurate. The audience, say the networks, gets tired of
pressing the buttons and stops using the device. The result
is a huge dropoff of viewers that might actually still be
watching, the networks allege.</p>
<p>Nielsen said there is nothing fundamentally wrong with its
system, and advertisers agree. Betsy Frank, senior vice
president at Saatchi & Saatchi Advertising, said that NBC's
plan was "based on a faulty premise that said Nielsen was
flawed. It covers up the fact that the networks are
responsible for getting people to tune to television."</p>
<p>And network television viewing continues to decrease. A
Nielsen spokesman said late yesterday that the average rating
in prime time for a network affiliate was down 10% in May
from last May, while ratings for non-pay cable channels rose
27%. In the late-night slot, network affiliates were down
6.6% in May and non-pay cable was up 25.6%.</p>
<p>An ABC official said the network dropped its earlier
proposal, which used audience levels from the past three
years, because it was widely perceived that NBC's plan was
gaining acceptance among advertisers.</p>
<p>Larry Hoffner, executive vice president of network sales
at NBC, said his plan "recognized the trend that television
viewership was down. ABC's didn't. The industry looked at the
two proposals and said that ours made more sense."</p>
