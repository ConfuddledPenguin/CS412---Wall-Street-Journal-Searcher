	<p class="article-leader">An article in the scientific journal Science charged that
Texas A&M University, College Station, Texas, failed to
investigate adequately the possibility of fraud in a set of
"cold fusion" experiments.
   The article by free-lance journalist Gary Taubes focuses
on the claimed production of tritium by cold fusion
experiments in the laboratory of chemist John Bockris. In
April 1989, Mr. Bockris and colleagues were among the first
to claim they had detected large amounts of tritium, a
"heavy" form of hydrogen that can be produced by nuclear
reactions, in a cold fusion experiment.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Mr. Taubes asserts that other scientists at Texas A&M,
failing to reproduce Mr. Bockris's results, began to raise
questions as to whether someone could have clandestinely
added tritium to Mr. Bockris's experiments. Mr. Taubes
charges that "the Texas A&M administration . . . has done
nothing past some preliminary questioning." The article
doesn't offer any specific evidence that the experiments were
tampered with and notes that no one has made fraud charges.</p>
<p>John Fackler, dean of the college of science, noted that
another Texas A&M scientist, nuclear chemist Kevin Wolf,
already had run experiments suggesting that Mr. Bockris's
results were spurious. In the absence of specific charges,
"We can't go any further than Kevin Wolf has done," he said.</p>
<p>Mr. Fackler said he was writing Science, "pointing out
this kind of journalism isn't appropriate to a journal like
Science."</p>
