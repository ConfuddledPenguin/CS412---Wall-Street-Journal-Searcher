	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- A sharp drop in the price of gold sparked a
modest rally in the bond market as foreign investors sold
commodities and snapped up U.S. Treasury bonds.
   The Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond rose 1/2 point
yesterday, a gain of $5 for a bond with a $1,000 face amount.
The issue's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from
its price, fell to 8.34%.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The rally kicked off during overnight trading in London,
where prices of gold futures plunged through the
psychologically important $350 level in heavy selling by
Saudi Arabian investors. The London afternoon gold price was
fixed at $345.85, the lowest since July 1986. British
government bonds, called gilts, rose as much as 1 1/4 point
yesterday.</p>
<p>Although a mildly disappointing inflation report caused
U.S. bond prices to decline during early U.S. trading, the
market reversed direction later in the day as the slide in
gold hurt other precious metals.</p>
<p>Traders in both London and New York said that some of the
cash flowing out of gold showed up later in intermediate-term
U.S. and British bonds.</p>
<p>Brian J. Fabbri, a managing director at Midland Montagu
Securities Inc., said investors "selling gold have wanted to
get out of commodities and purchase some financial assets,"
in the U.S. and British bond markets.</p>
<p>Mr. Fabbri said that in recent weeks, the value of the
dollar has "held up extremely well" while the value of the
British pound has "soared." Meanwhile, bond yields have
eased. Such trends, he said, have persuaded some foreign
investors that they can earn high returns because they can
earn profits on currency gains as well as capital
appreciation when bond prices rise.</p>
<p>The decline in gold spread to other commodities and
prompted some economists to reduce their inflation forecasts.
The Commodity Research Bureau's index of futures prices fell
3.89 points to 236.44, the steepest one-day drop since May
1987.</p>
<p>But trading yesterday was quiet, with foreign investors
accounting for a lot of the buying.</p>
<p>Robert D. Sbarra, a senior vice president at Carroll
McEntee & McGinley Inc., said that trading was slow because
domestic investors were moving cautiously ahead of today's
important consumer price index report. He said the mood in
the market remains bullish.</p>
<p>Bonds got off to a weak start yesterday morning, falling
as much as 1/4 point on news that the May producer price
index rose 0.3%. That was slightly higher than had been
expected. Bond prices started to climb again on news that the
CRB index was falling.</p>
<p>Today, the government will release the May consumer price
index, a broad measure of inflation. A consensus of
economists polled by Dow Jones Capital Markets Report expect
a 0.3% rise in last month's CPI. Excluding the food and
energy components, CPI is also seen rising 0.3%.</p>
<p>The government will also release data on May industrial
production and capacity utilization and the April trade
deficit. The deluge of data due out today is expected to have
a major impact on trading today.</p>
<p>Municipal Bonds</p>
<p>Municipal bonds ended unchanged to up 1/8 point in spots
as the market exhibited firm tone ahead of the week's final
round of economic data.</p>
<p>In municipal activity, a Bear, Stearns & Co. group
repriced $299 million of New York Metropolitan Transportation
Authority service contract revenue bonds to lower the yield
by 0.02 to 0.10 percentage point.</p>
<p>The issue is now priced to yield from 6.40% for transit
facilities bonds due in 1992 to 7.72% for bonds due in 2016,
changed from being priced to yield from 6.50% in 1992 to
7.75% in 2016.</p>
<p>Also, a Merrill Lynch Capital Markets group repriced $710
million New York City general obligation bonds, to lower some
yields. The bonds were originally priced Wednesday.</p>
<p>In secondary action, the New Jersey Turnpike Authority's
7.20% securities of 2018 ended unchanged at 98 5/8 to yield
7.30%.</p>
<p>No large municipal bond issues are expected to be priced
today.</p>
<p>Treasury Securities</p>
<p>Treasury bonds were moderately higher yesterday. The
benchmark 30-year bond was quoted late at a price of 104
11/32 compared with 103 30/32 on Wednesday. The latest
10-year notes ended at 103 11/32 to yield 8.35% compared with
103 4/32 to yield 8.38%.</p>
<p>Short-term rates were unchanged to slightly lower. The
discount rate on three-month Treasury bills ended at 7.67%
for a bond-equivalent yield of 7.91%, unchanged from
Wednesday. The rate on six-month bills was 7.55% for a yield
of 7.96%, slightly lower.</p>
<p>Junk Bonds</p>
<p>The junk-bond market took a breather after Wednesday's
frenzied pace and ended little changed.</p>
<p>While prices of most junk bonds or speculative-grade
securities barely budged, high-yield bonds of Southland Corp.
advanced on news that the company has proposed a revised
restructuring plan that it says offers substantially improved
terms to bondholders and preferred stockholders.</p>
<p>Southland's 16.75% subordinated debentures, maturing in
2002, climbed two points to finish at a bid price of 9 while
the company's 15.75% senior subordinated notes, due in 1997,
surged four points to end at 19. Offerings for the 15.75%
notes shot up eight points. However, junk bond dealers said
there was little trading in the Southland debt.</p>
<p>As Southland bonds advanced, Trump Taj Mahal Funding bonds
slipped on a report that a number of creditors are balking at
a plan to restructure the empire of real estate developer
Donald Trump.</p>
<p>Trump Taj Mahal 14% bonds, due in 1998, slid 1 3/4 points
to 55 1/2 on the American Stock Exchange. Also lower were
Trump Castle Funding's 13.75% bonds, due in 1997, which
skidded 1 point to 59.</p>
<p>Earlier this week, the Trump bonds climbed on news that
Mr. Trump had reached a tentative agreement with his major
bankers that would give him time and money to restructure his
crippled holdings.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, in the high-yield market, junk bonds of RJR
Nabisco Inc. stabilized after sprinting sharply higher
Wednesday.</p>
<p>Foreign Bonds</p>
<p>British government bonds ended sharply higher for the
third consecutive day, although prices slipped off session
peaks due to profit-taking and a dip in the U.S. Treasury
market.</p>
<p>Prices rose strongly during the morning, buoyed by foreign
buying, falling gold prices and gains in the U.S. bond market
late Wednesday.</p>
<p>British government bonds, called gilts, got a further
boost from economic data suggesting further weakness in the
labor market. Britain's unemployment rate rose to a
seasonally adjusted 5.7% in May from 5.6% in April, its first
monthly rise since July 1986.</p>
<p>Gilts prices eased somewhat later after a disappointing
report on U.S. inflation caused prices of U.S. Treasury bonds
to fall. U.S. Treasurys recovered later in the day and ended
higher.</p>
<p>Inflation will be the focus of the gilts market today,
when the government reports the May retail-prices index.</p>
<p>Among benchmark issues, Britain's 11.75% bond due
2003/2007 rose 1 1/4 points to 103 1/4 to yield 11.26% while
the 12% notes due in 1995 jumped 3/4 point to 100 14/32 to
yield 11.88%.</p>
<p>Japanese government bonds also ended higher. West German
financial markets were closed in observance of the Corpus
Christi holiday.</p>
<p>Corporate Issues</p>
<p>Yields on Chrysler Corp. debt securities rose yesterday in
the wake of actions by Moody's Investors Service Inc. and
Standard & Poor's Corp.</p>
<p>S&P said late yesterday that it lowered the senior debt
ratings of Chrysler Corp., Chrysler Financial Corp. and
Chrysler Credit Canada Ltd. The S&P rating changes come just
a day after Moody's placed the auto maker's senior debt under
review for possible downgrade.</p>
<p>S&P also lowered certain debt ratings of Ford Motor Co.,
but there was little change in Ford bonds because the rating
change came late in the day.</p>
<p>In trading, yields on Chrysler's 9.60% notes, maturing in
1994, climbed from 10.25% to 10.50%. Yields on other Chrysler
debt securities also rose similarly.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, in the new-issue market for investment-grade
corporate debt, nearly $500 million in new debt issues were
priced yesterday, including a $200 million issue of Dow
Capital B.V. 20-year debentures. Dow Capital is a unit of Dow
Chemical Co. The securities were priced at par to yield 9.20%
through underwriters led by Salomon Brothers Inc.</p>
<p>Most investment-grade corporate bonds finished between 3/8
point to 1/2 point higher.</p>
<p>Mortgage-Backed Securities</p>
<p>Mortgage-backed securities ended with slight gains on the
back of U.S. Treasurys.</p>
<p>Government National Mortgage Association 9.5% securities
were up 5/32 at 99 25/32, Ginnie Mae 10% issues were 1/8
firmer at 102 1/8. Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp. 9.5%
securities were 3/32 higher at 99 1/32 and 10% securities
were 1/8 firmer at 101 2/32. Federal National Mortgage
Association 9.5% securities were 3/32 firmer at 99 1/2 and
10% securities were up 1/8 at 101 17/32.</p>
<p>The market showed little reaction to yesterday's report on
producer prices.</p>
