	<p class="article-leader">Reebok International Ltd. said its largest shareholder,
Pentland Group PLC of London, which has a 31.5% stake, plans
to sell its holdings.
   Reebok, which has lost momentum in its a battle with Nike
Inc. for leadership in the sneaker market, said it hopes to
remain independent. Directors promptly adopted a poison-pill
shareholder rights plan to make any hostile takeover
prohibitively expensive.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Paul Fireman, chairman and chief executive officer of
Stoughton, Mass.-based Reebok, is the company's
second-largest shareholder with a 14.5% stake. Reebok has 115
million shares outstanding.</p>
<p>Reebok made the announcement after the market closed
yesterday. The company hasn't been subject to much takeover
speculation in the past because of the large blocks of stock
held by insiders. However, in past years when its stock
slumped, some analysts had suggested that Mr. Fireman might
take the company private in a leveraged buy-out, with or
without Pentland.</p>
<p>According to the company's proxy statement, Mr. Fireman
has a right of first refusal to buy Pentland's shares. At
current prices, purchasing Pentland's 36.2 million shares
would cost $651.6 million. Presumably such a large stake
would command a premium, however.</p>
<p>In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday,
Reebok stock closed at $18, up 12.5 cents.</p>
<p>Mr. Fireman said, "The board of directors firmly believes
that the interests of Reebok's shareholders are best served
by Reebok remaining independent. As a 14.5% shareholder of
the company, I fully support the board's position."</p>
<p>He added that Reebok will support Pentland in its efforts
"to dispose of their shares to a buyer or buyers whose
interests will coincide with the long-term interests of
Reebok and its shareholders, employees, and other
constituencies."</p>
<p>Reebok didn't say how Pentland would dispose of its
shares, whether in the public market or through a private
transaction. The U.S. firm declined further comment on the
announcement.</p>
<p>Reebok was one of the great growth stocks of the mid-1980s
as Mr. Fireman turned a little-known British running shoe
brand into the biggest selling sneaker in the U.S. by
focusing on the aerobics market. However, in the past few
years, it slipped behind Nike, which appeals more to
athletes. Reebok has rebounded recently on the strength of
its high-priced "Pump" basketball sneakers. But some analysts
say the sneaker market is slowing to single-digit growth,
limiting Reebok's gains.</p>
<p>Last year, Reebok earned $175 million, or $1.53 a share,
on sales of $1.82 billion.</p>
<p>Alice Ruth, an analyst with Montgomery Securities in San
Francisco said she has heard in the past that Pentland was
unhappy with Reebok's performance.</p>
<p>Pentland's chairman, R. Stephen Rubin, is listed as vice
chairman of Reebok, and another Pentland executive, Frank A.
Farrant, also sits on Reebok's board. However, neither is
active in daily management. Pentland is a holding company and
footwear trading firm. Mr. Rubin owns more than half of
Pentland's shares directly or through a family-owned company.
Messrs. Rubin and Farrant couldn't be reached.</p>
<p>Many people have been critical of Reebok's marketing and
advertising in the past two years. The company has attempted
to sell its shoes both to the fashion market, where L.A. Gear
Inc. has been strongest, and to the performance market, where
Nike leads. Critics say this has muddied its image. Reebok
has also had problems finding a consistent ad theme, trying
and discarding the weird "U-B-U" commercials. It has
repeatedly jettisoned ad agencies.</p>
<p>Mr. Fireman has taken an increasingly active role in
operations in recent months, with the departure of several
top executives who had been brought in from the outside
several years ago.</p>
<p>One former employee discounted the idea of a hostile
takeover because "it would be hard to imagine anyone buying
the company without" Mr. Fireman. The ex-employee said a
leveraged buy-out by Mr. Fireman might make more sense
because Reebok has strong cash flow and little need for
capital spending because its manufacturing is subcontracted.</p>
<p>Mr. Fireman is consistently one of the best-paid
executives in America because of an unusual bonus provision
under which he receives 5% of the amount by which Reebok's
pretax earnings exceed $20 million. Last year his
compensation totaled $14.6 million.</p>
<p>Reebok said that under its shareholder rights plan,
holders of record on June 29 will receive rights to purchase
one Reebok common share at $60 for each share held.</p>
