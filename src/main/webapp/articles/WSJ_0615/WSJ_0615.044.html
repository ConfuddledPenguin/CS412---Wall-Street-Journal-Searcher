	<p class="article-leader">It's a classic problem for any company exhibiting at a
huge national trade show: How do you get convention delegates
to stop at your display booth?
   Jack Parker thinks balloons, free popcorn and clowns
handing out fliers are a waste of money. But then, he sells
an alternative: advertising on his closed-circuit TV station.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Trade shows are critical for many companies. In a few
hectic days, they must renew customer contacts, write orders
and introduce products. Mr. Parker, president of Visitors
Television Network Inc., New Orleans, tells exhibitors they
can stand out from the crowd by buying time on the programs
that VTV's small video production staff churn out. These are
shown on the trade show floor and in convention hotels.</p>
<p>Mr. Parker says the enterprise makes money. Revenue this
year should be "comfortably past $750,000, and aiming for $1
million," he says. But his experience also illustrates a
reality of entrepreneurship: A successful business idea often
means a hectic life.</p>
<p>The 49-year-old Mr. Parker and his staff must race to
shoot, edit and distribute a new 30-minute or 60-minute
program to hotels each day by early evening. The pace gives
his operation the aura of a low-budget, understaffed TV news
operation. "Our guiding principle is to look as much like
broadcast without costing as much as broadcast," he says.</p>
<p>When conventions open, Mr. Parker says, "the days start
around 8 a.m. and never, never close until 11 at night, when
we get reports back from the hotels that the tapes are
running." Mr. Parker also gets to know his suitcases. Before
the end of February this year, he already had served the
nation's helicopter manufacturers in Atlanta, the home
builders in Dallas and the auto dealers in Las Vegas. After
he leaves the Christian booksellers in Denver next month, he
heads for the outdoor lawn, garden and power equipment makers
in Louisville.</p>
<p>The pace is typical of many small entrepreneurs who must
make up with energy what they lack in size. At these
conventions, VTV's programs, reproduced on videocassettes,
can be seen running over and over on television monitors
placed about the exhibit hall. A closed-circuit tie-up with
major hotels also allows VTV advertisers to pitch their
products to delegates in their hotel rooms, where the
programs run around-the-clock on otherwise empty TV channels.</p>
<p>A look at the recent American Booksellers Association
convention in Las Vegas suggests the effort it takes to turn
out the shows: Mr. Parker's headquarters is a tiny room next
to a men's lavatory, 50 feet from the convention floor. A
video crew pops in and out throughout the day, delivering
just-completed feature or commercial footage to an editor.
The editor pulls the day's program together, cutting the
videotape to the allotted time, and adding titles and music.
A salesman roams the exhibit hall, lining up future
customers. Mr. Parker bird-dogs his camera crew and chats
with advertisers, keeping in touch with his troops via
walkie-talkie.</p>
<p>For one feature story, VTV reporter Charlotte Nichols
leads an on-camera tour of calligraphers, engravers,
papermakers and other bookmaking artisans. Later she plays
straight man to a rap-singing cookbook writing team, the
Clever Cleaver Brothers.</p>
<p>By 7 p.m., the crew has turned out 26 copies of the day's
completed program using a shelf full of vintage video
recording machines. The copies are hand-delivered to 14
hotels and ready for watching in guestrooms by 9 p.m. The
remaining tapes are plugged into convention hall monitors for
viewing the next day.</p>
<p>VTV doesn't get paid by a convention sponsor. Its sole
convention income comes from selling on-the-air ads. Not
surprisingly, the commercial content of its programs is high.
A 30-minute program at the booksellers' convention had 20
separate commercials, some as short as 10 seconds. Ad rates
vary by city and show, but at the booksellers' meeting,
several exhibitors paid $2,000 for a 30-second spot that ran
on each day's program.</p>
<p>The operation is frankly commercial, and Mr. Parker says
buying advertising time on the program greatly enhances the
odds that the program will include a feature on the
exhibitor. Several features on the Las Vegas programs
revolved around projects of major VTV advertisers.</p>
<p>In addition to wages and transportation expenses, most
hotels require VTV to pay an access fee to hook up to a
vacant TV channel. VTV uses an inventory of video equipment
that costs less than $100,000. The gear, packed in aluminum
trunks, is air freighted to and from the roughly 15
convention sites that VTV covers each year. With advances in
video technology, "you can provide a good TV signal and good
programming without bringing in a 60-foot production van,"
Mr. Parker says.</p>
<p>Mr. Parker practiced law (he found it boring) and dabbled
in Hollywood movie production before founding the company
with a partner in 1982. Their original idea of running hotel
TV channels aimed at tourists evolved into convention
television about six years ago, when "we discovered how to
put on shows financed by the exhibitors," Mr. Parker says.</p>
<p>For exhibitors, the TV ads provide a relatively
inexpensive -- if not always high-impact -- way to get
attention. Lexington Books bought VTV time at the booksellers
convention to increase awareness of the Lexington, Mass.,
publishing house, says Stephen Dragin, the publisher's
marketing director. Its 10-second VTV commercial played once
an hour for three days at a cost of $600. He says a number of
conventioneers said they saw the ad, but that response to the
publisher's offer in the ad of a 50% discount on certain
orders was "marginal."</p>
<p>Passport Books, a Chicago specialist in travel and foreign
language books, spent $1,200 for two 10-second spots
featuring the author of a new book, "New York on $1,000 a Day
(Before Lunch)." "We had a line of people to meet her," says
Donald Rolfe, director of Passport's trade book division. He
notes that the constant repetition of VTV programs means that
each commercial was shown 125 times during the convention.
"We will definitely use {VTV} again," Mr. Rolfe says.</p>
