	<p class="article-leader">LOS ANGELES -- Spelling Entertainment Inc. said fiscal
third-quarter net income fell nearly 64%, to $954,000, or
three cents a share, from $2.6 million, or nine cents a
share, a year earlier.
   Revenue declined 40% to $37.4 million from $62.1 million.
Operating profit, according to the entertainment production
and distribution company, slipped slightly to $5.3 million
from $5.9 million.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Jules Haimovitz, Spelling's president and chief operating
officer, attributed the lower net to increased interest and
purchase-price amortization resulting from the company's
acquisition of Worldvision in March 1989.</p>
<p>Aaron Spelling, chairman and chief executive officer,
noted that the highly successful debut of the ABC-TV show
"Twin Peaks" in April prompted the network to renew the
program for the fall season. In addition, 13 episodes of a
new half-hour series, "American Chronicles," produced by
David Lynch and Mark Frost, was ordered by Fox Broadcasting
Co. for airing in the fall. Spelling's Worldvision subsidiary
has acquired the world-wide distribution rights for both of
these properties.</p>
<p>In the first nine months, ended April 30, net was $5.4
million, or 13 cents a share, vs. $9 million, or 41 cents a
share, a year earlier. Revenue increased 19% to $119.2
million from $99.9 million.</p>
