	<p class="article-leader">SACRAMENTO, Calif. -- The California Air Resources Board,
continuing its campaign to attempt to force auto makers to
improve pollution controls, adopted tighter tailpipe emission
standards for light trucks, vans and certain other large
vehicles.
   Under the new standards, the board said up to 150,000
vehicles a year would be equipped with anti-smog equipment
similar to that on passenger cars. Currently, larger vehicles
don't normally feature some of the more advanced
anti-pollution technology required on passenger cars.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The standards will be phased in over the 1995 and 1996
model years. The board said the new standards would reduce
emissions from the targeted vehicles by 26% to 75%, depending
on the model and its size. Vehicles covered by the new
standards range in weight from 3,750 pounds to 14,000 pounds,
and would include ambulances, tow trucks, small motor homes
and oversized pickup trucks.</p>
<p>The agency estimated that it would cost $61 to $390 a
vehicle to make modifications needed to meet the new
standards.</p>
<p>Manufacturers of the affected vehicles couldn't be reached
to comment. In general, however, car makers and gasoline
producers have said that the board's pollution goals are
unreachable or economically unfeasible.</p>
<p>The new standards are in keeping with the board's recent
drive to adopt tough new emission standards. The campaign has
national significance because California is the country's
biggest car market and because many states model pollution
laws on California's.</p>
