	<p class="article-leader">Mitsui O.S.K. Lines Ltd., one of Japan's largest shipping
companies, is in negotiations to purchase Wassing
Internationale BV, a major Dutch distributing company, a
Mitsui official said this week.
   Mitsui seeks to buy 100% of the company, the official
said, although the purchase price hasn't been disclosed.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Wassing's business operations in the U.S., Europe and Far
East, including air cargo transport, trucking and inland
cargo transport and warehousing, will be left intact.</p>
<p>Mitsui is pursuing the deal because it aims to gain a
foothold in the Dutch port city of Rotterdam, which handles a
large amount of European shipping. The move is part of a
strategy to expand in Europe, the official noted.</p>
