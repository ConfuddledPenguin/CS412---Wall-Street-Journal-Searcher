	<p class="article-leader">TOKYO -- At least one major Japanese electronics company
has received a request from the U.S. Internal Revenue Service
to pay additional taxes, and others are expecting similar
notice soon.
   The U.S. government has long alleged that Japanese
companies are avoiding U.S. taxes by charging their
subsidiaries too much for certain goods, such as
semiconductors and videocassette recorders -- an action that
depresses the stated profits of the American units.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Matsushita Electric Industrial Co. has received a request,
and is "cooperating" with the U.S. government, according to
an official company statement. The company added, however,
that no bilateral standard exists for "transfer prices" and
that the matter was still under discussion between the U.S.
and Japanese governments. A spokesman refused to disclose the
amount of the tax request, or when it was made.</p>
<p>The Nihon Keizai Shimbun, in Friday's editions, reported
that Matsushita was asked to pay an added 10 billion yen
($64.6 million) in taxes; Toshiba Corp. was asked to pay 30
billion yen more, and Hitachi Ltd. 10 billion yen more.</p>
<p>The Matsushita spokesman said the figure reported for that
company was "too high." Toshiba officials said they hadn't
yet received any official request, but that they have been
under investigation by the IRS for transfer pricing questions
since 1985. A Hitachi spokesman said the company has been
under investigation since 1986, but that it hadn't received
any requests for additional taxes.</p>
<p>Sony Corp. said it had received requests for additional
information to the IRS about a month ago, and is still
working to supply the requested material.</p>
