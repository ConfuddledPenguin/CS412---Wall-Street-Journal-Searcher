	<p class="article-leader">In the beginning, there was Microsoft Word 1.0, and it was
good. But it wasn't perfect. So Microsoft Corp. developed
upgrades: Word 2.0, 3.0, 4.0 and 5.0.
   Microsoft isn't alone. The entire software industry has
embraced upgrades with a devotion to the "new and improved"
that would shame a soap maker. "You can count on upgrades
like the earth revolving or young hearts turning to love in
the spring," according to W.E. Peterson, executive vice
president of WordPerfect Corp., which upgrades its software
products every six to 18 months.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>While such upgrades usually include many worthwhile
features, consumers increasingly are balking at trading up.
"A lot of people don't need to upgrade as often as the
vendors offer upgrades," says Tracy Lickleider, president of
the Boston Computer Society, the nation's biggest computer
user group.</p>
<p>Customers complain that upgrades are expensive and
difficult to install. Sometimes, using the new software
requires buying a bigger computer. Worse, some of the
upgrades don't work as well as the products they replace.
That's what happened with an upgrade of Ashton-Tate Corp.'s
dBase product, causing a sales collapse at the company.</p>
<p>"In the past, when you announced an update, everyone would
buy it," says Mr. Peterson of WordPerfect. "Now, people tend
to wait to make sure there's no problem." That skepticism has
confounded some software makers, such as Lotus Development
Corp., which expected a bigger revenue boost than it got from
the widely publicized upgrade of its 1-2-3 software.</p>
<p>Until now, upgrades have been gravy for the industry. They
have helped software makers solve one of their biggest
marketing problems -- the fact that "software never wears
out," according to Lawrence Wortzel, a marketing professor at
Boston University. "They have to make you trade in, trade up
and throw it away while it's still working," he says.</p>
<p>In order to continue milking their customer base, the
software companies generally have sold upgrades to existing
users for about one-third of the discounted retail price of a
new product. In theory, it's almost as reliable as an annuity
stream, says Michele Preston, a stock analyst with Cowen &
Co. WordPerfect calculates that upgrades account for 5% to
10% of revenue most months.</p>
<p>There are many other reasons for upgrades. Tax software,
for example, has to be updated annually to reflect changes in
the tax laws. Sometimes upgrades are needed to fix bugs in
the first version of a program. In other cases, an upgrade
corrects more fundamental faults. Lotus has just started
selling Release 2.0 of Agenda, a personal information manager
with a reputation of being very hard to learn. The new
version, Lotus says, will be doing useful work within half an
hour of starting.</p>
<p>Software makers also have to improve their products to use
new hardware. As laser printers have become affordable, for
example, word-processor makers have been forced to provide
better graphics.</p>
<p>"I've never seen a worthless upgrade from a major
company," says Ronald Goldfarb, a PC manager for United
Technologies Corp.'s Pratt & Whitney division. "You create a
need with a new feature."</p>
<p>But existing users of software often take a jaundiced view
of upgrades. Even when the added features are beneficial, "it
seems to me upgrades are nothing but bad news," says Linda
Schultz, director of information technology for the fragrance
and food ingredients division of Hercules Inc., Wilmington,
Del. She complains about the complex process of exchanging
every user's old disks for new ones and the time it takes to
teach users about new features.</p>
<p>Many other users say upgrades don't address their
particular needs, especially those who buy programs to do
specific jobs, such as churning out business letters or
recalculating the values of a stock portfolio. If the job
doesn't change, the software probably shouldn't either. "When
a customer calls me about a new release, I say, `Do you
absolutely need this right now?'" says David Kahn, president
of D. Lawton Associates, a Natick, Mass., computer
consultant.</p>
<p>But many users say software makers subtly imply they won't
continue to give advice on older products. Software vendors
usually stop selling older versions after they bring out new
ones. And big companies prefer to have all employees using
the same product because it simplifies training and sharing
information. "We try to keep up with the upgrades," says
Larry Hamilton, who manages the computer network at Budd Co.,
an auto parts maker in Troy, Mich. "It's a fact of life that
they will ratchet you up," he says.</p>
<p>It isn't easy, though. To get the low-priced upgrade,
users are required to send in either original floppy disks or
else title pages from the manual. Especially for big users,
that's a headache. Neal Checkoway, vice president at
Corporate Software Inc., a Canton, Mass., software
distributor, says his company started a special service to
help with upgrades. "The vendors' requirements generally
included the first page of the manual, diskettes and the
first-born son," he jokes. "Imagine that for thousands of
copies, distributed broadly with a variety of different
budgetary controls."</p>
<p>Even at cut rates, upgrading 1,000 users at once is a
stiff cost, sometimes as much as $150,000. Worse, because new
software with added features takes more memory than the
software it replaces, many users have to buy more powerful
computers or more memory for existing computers. Forrester
Research, a Cambridge, Mass., market research firm, decided
against buying Microsoft's popular Windows 3.0 upgrade
because executives concluded that the $50 software upgrade
would force it to buy about $800 in extra hardware for each
user, the equivalent of having to buy a new house with a
larger garage in order to buy a new car model.</p>
<p>Then there's the hassle of simply installing the upgrade.
Technicians at Boston Edison Co. spent an average of half an
hour with each of 900 users upgrading Lotus 1-2-3.</p>
<p>Upgrades also may disrupt long-established patterns for
experienced users. Russ Walter, a computer book author from
Somerville, Mass., says that when he moved from WordPerfect
5.0 to 5.1, he had to rewrite many of the shortcuts called
macros that he had written to make his work easier. In the
old version, a single keystroke could set items into tables;
the new version provides a menu with a choice between tables
or columns, necessitating a rewrite of the macro. "I took the
41 chapters (in the book) I'd created and redid every damn
one," he says.</p>
<p>Software makers say they are sympathetic with users'
problems and are working to make things easier. Scott Oki,
senior vice president of Microsoft, says upgrades used to
come out every six months, but now they "tend to be more like
every 18 months." In addition, software companies
increasingly are selling new products at the upgrade price if
corporate users simply send a "letter of destruction"
attesting they won't use the old version anymore.</p>
<p>At the same time, changes at big customers are making
upgrades easier to digest. As corporations install networks
connecting all their PCs, PC managers only have to update
software on central servers rather than going to each user's
PC.</p>
<p>But for every improvement, there's a horror story. Take
Lotus, whose 1-2-3 spreadsheet is the most-used software for
millions of computer users. After successfully upgrading
users from Release 1A to 2.01 in 1986, it promised a second
major upgrade in 1988. That was delayed twice.</p>
<p>Finally, last year, Lotus produced two different main
versions, each priced at $150 for existing customers -- the
smaller 2.2 with fancy printing capabilities and the powerful
3.0 -- as well as a host of versions for other computers.</p>
<p>The process has irked loyal customers. Hercules had to buy
some users both 2.2 and 3.0 in order to provide both
increased power and the printing capabilities available only
with Release 2.2. "It's not a happy situation," says Ms.
Schultz.</p>
<p>Now Lotus is offering another upgrade. Since Sept. 10,
buyers can get the new 1-2-3 Release 3.1, which includes the
best of both predecessors, for $35, $75, $99 or $150,
depending on what version they exchange and where they buy
it.</p>
