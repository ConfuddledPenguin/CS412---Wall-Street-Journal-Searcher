	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- The House approved a nearly $283 billion
defense authorization bill after adopting a $978 million
amendment to expand the military's sealift capacity and boost
spending for equipment and training to protect U.S. troops
from chemical weapons.
   Spurred by the current Iraqi crisis, the action came as a
House Appropriations subcommittee separately approved an
estimated $2 billion supplemental defense bill to cover
more-immediate costs incurred by the deployment of U.S.
forces to the Middle East.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The Appropriations leadership hopes to rush the
supplemental measure through Congress before the fiscal year
ends Sept. 30, but the administration faces serious obstacles
in its related bid to help Egypt by forgiving $6.7 billion in
back debts on military sales. At a hearing yesterday, senior
lawmakers argued that the White House had understated the
true cost of the transaction, and despite personal lobbying
by President Bush, there appears to be little appetite in the
committee leadership to move quickly on the Egypt issue.</p>
<p>Instead, House Appropriations Committee Chairman Jamie
Whitten (D., Miss.) is proposing to incorporate the military
supplemental bill with a short-term spending resolution to
keep the government funded through the first weeks of the
fiscal year beginning Oct. 1. The measure would buy time to
complete action on annual appropriations bills backed up in
Congress, and Mr. Whitten appears to support a provision that
would delay the effective date of the Gramm-Rudman law's
across-the-board cuts as budget negotiations continue.</p>
<p>Delay could make the administration's task that much more
difficult, but lawmakers are reluctant to commit themselves
until they have a better understanding of the costs and what
concessions will be given to other nations, such as Israel
and Poland, on finances or aid. The postponement is
embarrassing at a time when the White House is most eager to
forge a strong alliance with Egypt, yet the administration
may have hurt itself by appearing to engage in budgetary
legerdemain to play down the costs of the U.S. commitment in
the Persian Gulf.</p>
<p>For example, William Diefenderfer, deputy director of the
White House Office of Management and Budget, testified in
Congress yesterday that canceling Egypt's debt posed no cost
to the Treasury as the U.S. had given up any hope of being
repaid. But in answer to a separate question, Deputy
Secretary of State Lawrence Eagleburger said the
administration had considered having Kuwait or Saudi Arabia
pay the debt for Cairo, but this would have reduced what
these Gulf kingdoms could do to aid front-line nations in the
region and help pay for the burgeoning U.S. military
commitment.</p>
<p>"It would be inappropriate to put this in the supplemental
{bill} at this point," said Rep. David Obey (D., Wis.),
chairman of the foreign operations subcommittee. "There are
too many questions to be answered."</p>
<p>Approved on a 256-155 roll call, the massive defense
authorization bill would cut the Pentagon's fiscal 1991
budget 8% and reflects a wholesale shift of funds from
strategic weapons to more conventional systems. As seen in
yesterday's amendment, the current crisis has contributed to
this emphasis, but the bill also reflects a calculated
strategy to protect lawmakers' parochial interests at a time
of retrenchment for the defense industry.</p>
<p>The bulk of the new sealift-money yesterday, for example,
comes at the expense of cuts from the Strategic Defense
Initiative. And while the measure terminates production of
additional B-2 Stealth bombers, it authorizes $165 million
for start-up procurement of the V-22 tilt-rotor aircraft
backed by the Texas and Pennsylvania delegations over the
objections of the Pentagon.</p>
<p>Similarly, the bill adds $437 million to the Navy's budget
for the F/A-18 Hornet jet built by Missouri and Massachusetts
manufacturers, and in an effort to embarrass Democrats,
Republicans offered an unsuccessful motion to reapply these
funds to reduce the need for troop cuts elsewhere in the
measure.</p>
<p>The bill also contains the first provision to clear the
House or Senate for helping workers who lose their jobs in
defense cutbacks. The House voted 288-128 for an amendment by
Rep. Nicholas Mavroules (D., Mass.) authorizing $200 million
to extend unemployment compensation for affected workers,
provide retraining and education funds and beef up job
placement. The amendment would also offer funds to help
communities plan for converting defense projects to civilian
work.</p>
<p>Under the threat of a White House veto, the bill goes to a
conference with an estimated $289 billion Senate measure, and
all sides expect major adjustments in both the weapon and
personnel accounts. In light of the current crisis, some
influential lawmakers expect Congress this year to approve
troop cuts of closer to 80,000, or well below what the two
chambers have approved.</p>
<p>The $2 billion defense supplemental bill approved
yesterday fully meets the administration's requests for
Operation Desert Shield, but the panel refused to give the
Pentagon the free hand it wanted in accepting and spending
billions in contributions pledged by foreign nations to help
pay for the U.S. forces. Instead, all expenditures would be
subject to the appropriations process, requiring approval
from the committee leadership or full Congress.</p>
<p>The House action came as the Senate Appropriations
Committee approved a nearly $51.2 billion fiscal 1991 farm
and rural development bill, which rejects prior
House-approved cuts calling for the termination of the
federal crop-insurance program.</p>
