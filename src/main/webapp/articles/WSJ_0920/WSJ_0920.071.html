	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- The Postal Service is moving to speed up the
use of mail with address bar codes, which enable post offices
to use efficient automated equipment.
   Postmaster General Anthony Frank announced several actions
aimed at encouraging business customers to put bar codes on
letter envelopes, large flat mail pieces and even packages.
The agency also said it will send brochures encouraging
mailers to use complete addresses, with ZIP codes on the line
next to the city and state, to the more than 116 million U.S.
addresses.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>In addition, the agency awarded two contracts totaling
$27.2 million for modified equipment that will read address
bar codes almost anywhere on the face of envelopes. Automated
bar code sorters currently in use can only read bar codes
printed in the lower right-hand corner.</p>
<p>The awards include a $14.2 million contract to
Westinghouse Electric Corp., Pittsburgh, and a $13 million
contract to Bell & Howell Co., Skokie, Ill. Each contract is
for modification of 614 bar code sorters that currently are
being built and for changing an additional 694 sorters
already being used by the Postal Service.</p>
<p>By 1995, the service hopes to have all letters bar coded
with 11 digits, which narrow delivery to the recipient's
address. It hopes to have 40% of all letters coded by
customers, 40% by post offices and 20% by contractors who do
the coding from remote locations, or using other
technologies.</p>
<p>Mr. Frank said the agency proposes to begin offering rate
incentives for barcoded letters next June, and to extend them
to all of the nation by three months after that. The service
originally had proposed starting the discounts in 1992, then
moved the plan up to September 1991. While the agency has
proposed that first-class mail be charged 30 cents, up from
the current 25 cents, mailers who bar code letters could pay
as little as 24.3 cents under the rate proposal pending
before the Postal Rate Commission.</p>
<p>The agency will file for a bar-coding rate discount for
flats, possibly more than one cent per piece, next spring,
Mr. Frank said. It has contracted with several vendors to
develop a flats bar code reader. Finally, the Postal Board of
Governors has approved $52 million for a package bar coding
system to process packages, Mr. Frank said.</p>
