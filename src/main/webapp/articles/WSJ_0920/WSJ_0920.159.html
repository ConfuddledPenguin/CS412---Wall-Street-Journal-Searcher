	<p class="article-leader">Regarding your Aug. 22 "Tracking Travel": There are lies,
damned lies and statistics. I propose we add a new category
called "damned statistics." Damned statistics should be
reserved for any statistic by the Insurance Institute for
Highway Safety, or any other self-serving insurance-industry
propaganda mechanism.
   The fact is, the most reliable measurement of traffic
fatalities is the number of people killed per million miles
driven. The IIHS never quotes that one. It drops every year
and is at the lowest level since transportation statistics
were first collected for motorized vehicles. The number of
fatalities that are reported rise in proportion to the number
of miles driven. Another statistic conveniently left out by
most of that group (IIHS and the like) is that the deaths are
rising equally on highways not affected by the 65-mph speed
limit. In addition, studies have found that states that wish
to keep their hands buried deeply into the pockets of their
citizenry by maintaining the preposterous 55-mph speed limit
(i.e. Massachusetts) have the same average speeds on their
highways as states with the 65-mph speed limit, despite
ridiculous fines for speeding.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Whether you wish to travel at 55 mph or 65 mph (conditions
permitting), you should know that the posted limit has had no
effect on anything other than revenues for the beneficiaries
of the 55-mph speed limit. States have lost ticket revenues
and insurance companies have less excuse to raise your
premiums due to tickets received for driving at a speed
dictated by common sense, rather than arbitrary politics.</p>
