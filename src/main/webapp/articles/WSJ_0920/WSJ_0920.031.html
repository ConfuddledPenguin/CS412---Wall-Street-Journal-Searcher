	<p class="article-leader">The chemicals industry, feeling the first reverberations
of the Persian Gulf oil shock, is trying to pass the bad
vibes along. But so far the soft economy is acting as a
buffer to protect consumers.
   About 6% of all oil consumed in the U.S. is transformed
into such materials as the fibers in clothing and carpet and
the plastics in packaging and housewares. But unlike the
laser-like speed with which higher oil prices show up at the
gasoline pump, the cost pass-throughs in chemicals tend to be
delayed and hidden. The price pressures may worm their way
from oil to, say, naphtha and benzene, then to styrene and
polystyrene, and then into the clamshell that holds a Big
Mac.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Only this month are the initial producers in the
petrochemical chain, the so-called upstream producers,
beginning to pass along their higher raw material costs. But
with oil continuing to trade at around $30 a barrel, even
producers farther "downstream" are leaning on managers to
boost prices at the first hint that oil-related costs are
taking off.</p>
<p>"When we went through the last oil runups, Du Pont didn't
raise prices aggressively and we lost {profit} margin," Edgar
Woolard Jr., Du Pont Co.'s chairman, remarked last week. "The
strategy this year is we're trying absolutely not to allow
that to happen again."</p>
<p>Du Pont estimates that a $10-a-barrel rise in oil prices
cuts the annual profit of its chemicals operations by $300
million to $400 million if the company doesn't pass through
any of its higher oil-related costs.</p>
<p>The chemicals industry offers one view of the varied
workings of higher oil prices on the economy. While releasing
the first hard data since Iraq's invasion of Kuwait, the
government last week reported that the producer price index
soared 1.3% in August. That index, which was fueled mostly by
energy prices, measures the prices commanded by goods as they
come out of the factory and off the farm.</p>
<p>If oil prices stay high, the soft economy may act as a
breakwater, damming up some inflationary pressures in the
manufacturing sector. But already there is a pinch in
consumer markets, too. On Tuesday, the government reported
that the consumer price index, propelled by gasoline and fuel
oil prices, rose 0.8% in August.</p>
<p>The typical U.S. household uses $3,500 of chemicals a
year, whether in such obvious forms as soap or in less
obvious ones like the acetyl chemicals used to make cigarette
filters and drugs. About 225 pounds of plastics end up in the
typical automobile, plus the chemicals in tires, hoses and
finishes.</p>
<p>A few consumer prices could move quickly. For instance,
55% of the cost of producing ethylene glycol, the chief
component of antifreeze, is tied to oil prices. Glycol prices
have shot up about 40% since the start of the Mideast crisis.
The effect of higher oil prices has been compounded by
anxiety over potential supply disruptions from Saudi Arabia,
a big glycol producer. First Brands Corp., maker of Prestone
antifreeze, estimates that the retail price of antifreeze may
climb by $1 to $2 a gallon by this winter. Antifreeze
currently sells at retail for about $7 a gallon.</p>
<p>Across the whole chemicals industry, however, a more
manageable fraction of aggregate selling prices is tied to
oil, roughly 8%. And the effects on some consumer items will
be tiny, if they show up at all. The price of a business suit
made of a wool-polyester blend has little to do with the
derivation from oil of xylene, a starting point in the
production of polyester.</p>
<p>McDonald's Corp. says it isn't yet paying more for
polystyrene cups and plates. General Motors Corp. says it
"isn't entertaining" overtures from chemical-industry
suppliers about the need for higher prices. The Karastan
Bigelow division of Fieldcrest Cannon Inc. says it doesn't
expect to be shelling out more for nylon and acrylic carpet
fibers anytime soon.</p>
<p>"You can't raise prices for a product that is dying," says
William Bond, an executive at Karastan Bigelow. He explains
that the weak housing market is keeping a lid on carpet
prices and, in turn, fiber prices.</p>
<p>Gerald Adolph, a chemicals consultant at Booz Allen &
Hamilton Inc., doubts that the industry will shed much of its
new oil-related costs. Rather, he says, the costs will lodge
somewhere along the production chain within the industry.
"Someone in the middle is going to get nailed," he says. "The
question is who."</p>
<p>Ethylene, a basic chemical building block, illustrates the
point. By some estimates, a $10-a-barrel increase in oil
prices would boost ethylene production costs in the U.S. by
$4 billion a year.</p>
<p>Producers in the U.S. won't be hurt as much as those in
Europe: The chief feedstock for ethylene production in Europe
is naphtha, an early derivative of oil whose price has
catapulted side-by-side with that of crude. The chief
feedstocks in the U.S. are natural-gas liquids, for which
price increases have been relatively modest.</p>
<p>Even so, for everyone the primary concern is the suddenly
higher oil-cost burden. Says Gerard Kamm, the ethylene buyer
for Union Carbide Corp., "The name of the game is, who's
going to pay that bill?"</p>
<p>Through August ethylene makers paid it, largely because
their customers were protected by monthly contracts. This
month, they have begun to pass on some of those costs,
sometimes through direct sales of ethylene, more often
through sales of the derivatives they make from it. Most of
the posted increases are pennies a pound and range from 7% to
12%.</p>
<p>Ultimately this inflationary pressure could sluice toward
consumers. Polyethylene, an ethylene derivative, is the
highest-volume plastic, used in milk jugs, toys and packaging
films. But as producers at the base of the production chain
try to lay off more of their costs, they could also meet more
resistance. Already one chemical company manager says of his
customers, "In some cases they just gulped and accepted" a
price increase. "But in others they said no. If they don't
like it, a lot of the business stops."</p>
<p>It stops or it goes elsewhere. Whenever producers raise
prices, they look over their shoulders for the competitor who
might hold back and grab market share. Higher oil prices make
this game more dicey.</p>
<p>"In all these war rooms, people are trying to anticipate
the response of their competitors and to understand the
psychology of whether they can pass these costs through,"
says James Doubek, a planning manager at Dow Chemical Co.</p>
<p>Sometimes adding to the uncertainty is more production
capacity that will come on stream just as producers are
trying to make price increases stick. By year's end, Chevron
Corp.'s chemical subsidiary is scheduled to expand its
styrene capacity, and Arco Chemical Co., 83%-owned by
Atlantic Richfield Co., may restart a styrene plant idled by
an explosion in July. Together, the Chevron and Arco Chemical
plants would lift styrene capacity in the U.S. by about 25%
over current levels.</p>
<p>The chemical units of big oil companies, as well as
independent chemical concerns, feel the pressure to pass
through costs. The subsidiaries generally buy oil-based
feedstocks at market prices even when feedstocks come from
the parent.</p>
<p>Du Pont, though still chiefly a chemicals company, has a
huge hedge in its Conoco oil unit, which is benefiting from
surging oil prices that should more than offset damage on the
chemical side. Still, Mr. Woolard, the Du Pont chairman, says
chemicals managers are being told to act as if the company
had no hedge when they try to raise a price.</p>
<p>"If in fact it doesn't stick, it doesn't stick," he says.
But then, "you wait three months and try again."</p>
