	<p class="article-leader">Seeq Technology Inc. said it will take a one-time charge
of $8 million to $10 million in the fourth quarter, ending
Sept. 30, to cover costs it incurred by converting a
wafer-processing production plant to a development facility.
   The company also said it expects revenue of about $12
million for the quarter, up from $10.9 million a year
earlier.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Seeq, which makes data-communications products, also said
its board reaffirmed the San Jose, Calif., company's
authority to buy back as many as 850,000 shares of its common
stock from time to time in the open market and in block
transactions. The board originally approved the buy-back in
September 1988, for Seeq's use under the company's restated
1982 stock-option plan. Since then, Seeq hasn't bought back
any of the stock.</p>
