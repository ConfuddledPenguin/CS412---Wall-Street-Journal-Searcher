	<p class="article-leader">AMERICAN SOUTHWEST MORTGAGE INVESTMENTS Corp. declared a
quarterly dividend of 22 cents a share, payable Oct. 15 to
stock of record Sept. 28. The dividend is equal to a 23%
increase from the total of 17 cents a share the real-estate
investment trust made in three monthly payments in its second
quarter. American Southwest, based in Tucson, Ariz., said it
changed to a quarterly dividend policy to reduce
administrative costs and to make the dividend comparable to
other trusts.</p>
