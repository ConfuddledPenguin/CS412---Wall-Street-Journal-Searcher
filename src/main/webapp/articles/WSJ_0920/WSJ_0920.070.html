	<p class="article-leader">That anguished cry emanating from the northeast Tuesday
was the sound made by the liberal beast as John Silber's
stunning victory in the Massachusetts Democratic
gubernatorial primary thrust a knife into its belly. In the
eight months since the combative president of Boston
University launched what then seemed a longshot bid for the
nomination to succeed Michael Dukakis, Mr. Silber has managed
to infuriate virtually every sector of the state's liberal
establishment.
   Barely two weeks into his campaign, Mr. Silber wondered
aloud why Massachusetts had become a "welfare magnet" for
waves of Southeast Asian immigrants who, he said, have turned
Lowell, Mass., into "the Cambodian capital of America."
Attacking the costly special education classes mandated by
state law, Mr. Silber said the high enrollment in such
programs "would lead one to believe there has been a collapse
of the gene pool in Massachusetts because 17 1/2% of our kids
are weird." Such pungent comments led one of Mr. Silber's
opponents to distribute buttons reading, "In your guts, you
know he's nuts."</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>And yet Mr. Silber -- despite the conservative credentials
he compiled for his strong support of the Nicaraguan Contras
when President Reagan appointed him to the Kissinger
Commission on Central America, and for cracking down on
overnight co-ed socializing in BU dorms -- is no
right-winger's dream. Mr. Silber takes it for granted that
government ought to be unabashedly interventionist.</p>
<p>"If we are going to act as social engineers, we ought to
learn from the practice of real engineers," Mr. Silber wrote
in his book "Straight Shooting: What's Wrong with America and
How to Fix It" (Harper & Row, 1989), the Rosetta Stone of his
campaign. "Confronting our social problems, we need the same
willingness to acknowledge failure, to discover what went
wrong, and to produce new designs."</p>
<p>At no little political risk, he vehemently opposes an
initiative placed on the November ballot by a libertarian
anti-tax group that would wipe out all recent tax hikes. (His
Republican opponent, William Weld, state chairman for Phil
Crane in 1980, was an early and avid supporter of the
petition.) This petition promises to be the whitecap atop the
wave of voter anger that swept out a number of Democratic
incumbents in the primary. But Mr. Silber argues that the
"discipline" imposed on state government by a Silber
administration would be sufficient to control costs.</p>
<p>He has called too for a "pump-priming" 12-cent-a-gallon
gas tax hike to stimulate public construction projects and
tourism. Mr. Silber's social proposals include high-priced
items such as expanded early-childhood education and
year-round schooling. It's not big-spending, interventionist
government that draws Mr. Silber's scorn -- it's the
Democratic Party's contemporary captivation by "special
interests and single-issue politics," such as those
enticingly generous welfare policies and poorly-managed
special education programs.</p>
<p>"Some true dependents, such as the mentally ill or
handicapped, do need a free ride," says Mr. Silber. "Other
than that, the notion of a free ride is preposterous." To Mr.
Silber, socially responsible citizens are those who pay their
taxes, obey the law, and do not make excessive demands on the
state's largesse. All others -- be they unwed teenage
mothers, juvenile offenders, or incompetent public school
administrators -- must submit to the paternalistic stick if
they expect to taste the welfare carrot.</p>
<p>In a state where the bureaucracy has taken to calling
welfare recipients "clients," Mr. Silber's prescription for
trimming welfare rolls represents a 180-degree change of
attitude. Too often, he maintains, the promise of enhanced
welfare benefits entices poor, unwed mothers to have a second
child whom they are ill-equipped to raise properly. Mr.
Silber would deny benefits to that second child. "While we
should neglect neither the child nor the mother when such
pregnancies occur, financial support should be contingent on
the mother's placing her child in a preschool nursery program
and enrolling in a school to qualify her for employment," he
wrote in "Straight Shooting."</p>
<p>Mr. Silber advocates placing all children in full-time
schooling from age three, with their parent or parents also
receiving parenting coaching and taking premedical education
courses. All this state attention would be voluntary --
unless the state determines the child is not being properly
cared for. Then, Mr. Silber promised in his book, "truancy
laws would guarantee" proper child care. "No parent should
have the right to engage in child neglect."</p>
<p>He evinces a "humane concern" for the hard-core
unemployables who populate the prisons and have proven, in
Massachusetts, and elsewhere, proof against even full
employment conditions. But along with that empathy comes a
conviction that the state -- through remedial education in
boot-camp prisons and through the preventive balm of his pet
early-education programs -- should back up that humane
concern with tough, compulsory remedies.</p>
<p>Mr. Silber advocates abandonment of racial integration
quotas in the early grades in order to facilitate
neighborhood schooling. He would put faltering public schools
on notice by giving expensive but ineffectual systems like
Boston's five years to shape up. If they have not improved by
then, he would allow students to enroll in the district of
their choice, with state funding following them. He reserves
special scorn for parents who, as he said in a recent
television interview, "allow their children to watch endless
amounts of television" and then send the kids off to school
"without a proper breakfast, so they become inattentive as
the day wears on."</p>
<p>"True liberalism," Mr. Silber argues, "never departed from
the New Deal model." But skeptics detect quite another model
in Mr. Silber's rhetoric: The model that sociologist Charles
Murray described in a 1988 Commentary article as "the brave
new world of custodial democracy, in which a substantial
portion of our population . . . will in effect be treated as
wards of the state."</p>
<p>Mr. Silber's candidacy offers much of the benevolent
paternalism of Franklin Roosevelt, but its moralistic
underpinning -- stemming from a conviction that the proper
reform not only helps out the unfortunates, but also forcibly
improves their character -- is more reminiscent of the
beliefs of another college president who ran for governor of
a reform-minded state: Woodrow Wilson, who won his race in
1910, by espousing the same sort of moralistic reform that
Mr. Silber now touts. Mr. Silber's impressive primary victory
over a field of garden variety Democrats suggests that, given
Massachusetts's unhappy experiences with modern-day
liberalism, the electorate might be ready for Mr. Silber's
new, old-fashioned brand of change.</p>
