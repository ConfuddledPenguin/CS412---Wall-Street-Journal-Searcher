	<p class="article-leader">MINNEAPOLIS -- Cargill Inc. said it plans to open offices
in Moscow and Warsaw to seek potential investments in the
Soviet Union and Poland.
   Cargill, one of the largest exporters of farm goods to the
Soviet Union, will be among the first of the large U.S. grain
exporters to establish a physical presence there.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Grain trading officials said yesterday that they expect
other U.S. exporters to follow suit in the wake of Soviet
President Mikhail Gorbachev's visit to Minnesota in June.</p>
<p>Cargill said Juels Carlson, president of Cargill's
world-wide molasses operations, will head the Moscow office.
It is slated to open early next year.</p>
<p>Edgar T. Savidge, account manager of Cargill's soybean
processing plant in Liverpool, England, will manage the
Warsaw office, due to open Oct. 1.</p>
<p>Cargill said the executives will study possible
investments in commodity processing and merchandising,
transportation and agricultural products, among other areas.</p>
<p>Over the past 15 years, Cargill's annual exports to the
Soviet Union of grain and oilseed-related products have
ranged between four million metric tons and 8.5 million
metric tons.</p>
