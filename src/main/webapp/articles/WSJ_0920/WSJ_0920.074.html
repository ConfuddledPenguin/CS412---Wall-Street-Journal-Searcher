	<p class="article-leader">Karen Elliott House's excellent article, "How Jordan's
King Was Played for a Fool" (editorial page, Aug. 14), states
that the British installed his grandfather Abdullah in a
kingdom they had created for him "after they removed him from
the Hejaz, now a part of Saudi Arabia."
   The British did not remove the Hashemite family from their
hereditary domain in the holy cities of Arabia. They were
removed by the desert tribal sheikdom of Ibn Saud, who
conquered most of the Arabian Peninsula during the first two
decades of this century and exiled the Hashemites when the
conquest was completed in 1921. This gives the Hashemite
family at least as much legitimate claim to Saudi Arabia as
anybody has to any area of land in the Middle East. Some
lingering coolness between the two royal families may be
explained by their old enmity and the precarious legitimacy
of both over the lands they rule.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>After their conquest of Arabia, the Saud family named
their new domain after themselves -- "Saudi Arabia." This
would be about the equivalent of the King ranch family of
Texas conquering the entire state and calling it "King
Texas."</p>
<p>The other consolation prize given by the British to the
exiled Hashemite family was Iraq, where they installed
Abdullah's brother Feisal as king. He was murdered by an
earlier version of Saddam Hussein.</p>
