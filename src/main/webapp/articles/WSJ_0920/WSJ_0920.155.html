	<p class="article-leader">Public Service Co. of Colorado, Denver, said it expects to
borrow, either through a private placement or public
offering, about $200 million to help pay costs associated
with converting its idled nuclear electric generating plant
to natural gas power.
   The utility said it expects to use about $125 million of
the borrowing to pay for removing the remains of radioactive
fuel from the St. Vrain plant north of Denver. PS Colorado
stopped generating electricity at the plant, the nation's
only gas-cooled, high-temperature reactor, in August 1989
after 10 years because of operational problems and excessive
costs. The company said it may have to spend $47 million of
the borrowed funds to build a temporary storage facility for
spent fuel from the plant.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>PS Colorado said state regulators cleared a private
placement, though plans are still preliminary. It hasn't
filed documents with the Securities and Exchange Commission
on a possible public bond offering. It said it doesn't expect
now to use any of the funds to finance the plant's $85
million dismantling and conversion.</p>
