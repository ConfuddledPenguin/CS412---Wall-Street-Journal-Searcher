	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- Housing starts fell for the seventh
consecutive month in August for their longest decline in
eight years.
   Builders started work on new homes at an annual rate of
1,127,000 last month, the Commerce Department said, down 1.7%
from July's 1,147,000. August starts were running 15% below a
year earlier. They haven't fallen for seven months in a row
since the last recession in 1981-82.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>These are the first housing-start figures to appear since
the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait and might reflect shaky
confidence in the wake of the crisis. "Frankly, I think the
housing industry probably would have begun to rebound by
August if not for the Persian Gulf crisis," said Mark
Obrinsky, a senior economist at the Federal National Mortgage
Association.</p>
<p>Starts on single-family homes fell 3.2% last month to an
annual rate of 840,000 after declining 2.4% in July to
868,000. Starts on apartments and other multifamily dwellings
rose 2.9% in August to an annual rate of 287,000 units after
plunging 7% in July to 279,000.</p>
<p>Despite these figures, however, David Seider, chief
economist for the National Association of Home Builders, said
the market for multifamily dwellings is in a "bona fide
recession condition," with the falloff in single-family
housing starts less dire.</p>
<p>All the numbers were adjusted for seasonal fluctuations.</p>
