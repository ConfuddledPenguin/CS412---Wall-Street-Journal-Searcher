	<p class="article-leader">A federal district court threw out Chevron Corp.'s
challenge to the Pennzoil Co. purchase of a stake in the San
Francisco-based oil giant.
   U.S. District Judge Samuel Conti of San Francisco found
that Pennzoil didn't violate antitrust law when it bought
8.8% of Chevron's common stock outstanding for $2.1 billion
in open-market purchases last fall. Chevron had sought to
block the purchase on grounds that Pennzoil misrepresented
its intentions.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Pennzoil said it was "delighted" with the ruling. The
Houston-based company has spent $2.1 billion of the $2.6
billion it won in its highly publicized legal battle with
Texaco Inc. to buy into Chevron. In July, Pennzoil said it
was considering additional purchases of Chevron stock with
the remaining Texaco settlement proceeds.</p>
<p>Chevron said it would consider an appeal, but must review
the opinion first. "We're disappointed with the outcome,"
said Kenneth T. Derr, Chevron's chairman and chief executive
officer.</p>
<p>Pennzoil has maintained that it bought the stake for
investment purposes.</p>
