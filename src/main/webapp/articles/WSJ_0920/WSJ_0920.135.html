	<p class="article-leader">The Reichmann family, which owns Olympia & York
Developments Ltd., is seeking to sell almost a 20%
partnership interest in its massive U.S. real estate
portfolio.
   John Zuccotti, Olympia & York USA president, declined to
estimate the value of the stake, but real-estate
professionals said the interest could sell for between $200
million and $800 million. Mr. Zuccotti denied speculation
that the company, as with many real estate concerns, has a
cash-flow problem. He added that the planned transaction had
been in the works for many months.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Mr. Zuccotti said the move is intended to put in the hands
of a single institutional investor minority holdings in
properties controlled by a variety of Reichmann family
members. The corporate entity will be unaffected by the sale,
said O&Y officials.</p>
<p>The properties, which include commercial projects in New
York City, Boston, San Francisco and other major U.S. cities,
are being shopped to a variety of institutional investors,
although the ultimate buyer is expected to be foreign.</p>
<p>Lazard Freres & Co. has been retained by the Reichmanns to
handle the sale.</p>
<p>Observers of O&Y's activities are keenly interested in the
sale because they think it may signal that the Reichmanns are
protecting themselves against a more severe downturn in the
real-estate market.</p>
<p>One individual who has spoken to family leader Paul
Reichmann said that while Mr. Reichmann does not believe in
the "gloom and doom scenario, it's enough of a possibility
that he's hedging his bets."</p>
<p>In the past, the Reichmanns have made fortunes by
correctly anticipating swings in the real estate and credit
markets. In perhaps its most prescient move, the company
purchased the Uris family's New York City real-estate
portfolio in 1977 for $320 million. Those properties were
said to have increased tenfold in value during the 1980s.</p>
<p>O&Y also developed the successful World Financial Center
in the 1980s. Its tenants include the world headquarters of
American Express Co., Merrill Lynch & Co., and Dow Jones &
Co., publisher of this newspaper.</p>
<p>Lately, however, the O&Y's fortunes have taken a slight
turn for the worse, in part because of its heavy investment
in the troubled Campeau Corp.</p>
<p>Olympia & York also has spent more than $1 billion
building the world's largest real-estate development in the
London docklands. That project, called Canary Wharf, is 50%
leased, but its success is far from certain. The company is
in the midst of securing long-term bank financing from
British and Japanese institutions.</p>
<p>Some of the company's older, Wall Street-area buildings,
such as one once occupied by Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc., sit
largely empty.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, during the past two decades, O&Y has
diversified into a number of industries that provide hedges
against major drops in the real-estate market. It owns a
controlling interest in newsprint producer Abitibi-Price Inc.
and Consumers' Gas Co. It also owns a 73% interest in Gulf
Canada Resources Ltd., which has benefited from the recent
rise in oil prices.</p>
