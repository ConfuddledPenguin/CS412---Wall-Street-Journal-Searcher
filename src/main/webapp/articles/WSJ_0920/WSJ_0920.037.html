	<p class="article-leader">DAYTON, Ohio -- Amcast Industrial Corp., citing higher
health costs and the cost of closing iron foundries, said it

$16.5 million, or $2.43 a share.
   The company, which serves the defense, construction and
manufacturing sectors, plans a reorganization. Leo Ladehoff,
Amcast's chairman and chief executive officer, will also
serve as president, effective today. He succeeds Raymond J.
