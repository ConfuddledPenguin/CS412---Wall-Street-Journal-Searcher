	<p class="article-leader">BCE Inc., parent of Bell Canada, expects to form a group
that will bid for control of Telefonos de Mexico S.A., a BCE
official said.
   As previously reported, the Mexican government intends to
sell a 20% control block in TelMex to a consortium that
includes one or more foreign concerns. The 20% control block
represents just over half of the full-voting shares in the
Mexican telephone monopoly. The government owns just over 50%
of TelMex. It would sell its remaining shares, new
limited-voting shares created under a recapitalization this
summer, at a later date.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The BCE official said putting together a group to bid for
control of Telmex is "a priority" for the Montreal-based
holding company. He said a Mexican concern would own about
half of the consortium while BCE and a U.S. telephone company
would each own about 25%. The BCE official said the company
is in talks with a number of U.S. telephone companies, which
he declined to identify, regarding the bid. He said the
government has set a deadline of Nov. 15 for bids.</p>
<p>BCE entered the Mexican telecommunications market this
spring as a member of two of the eight consortiums that were
awarded licenses to build and operate cellular telephone
systems in the country. Also this spring, BCE joined forces
with MCI Communications Corp. and others to form a group in
New Zealand that will compete with that country's main
telephone company.</p>
