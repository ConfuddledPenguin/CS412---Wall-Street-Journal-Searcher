	<p class="article-leader">SYRACUSE, N.Y. -- Niagara Mohawk Power Corp. said it plans
to phase out more than 1,100 jobs by 1992 in an effort to
reduce costs by as much as $64 million in its nuclear and
fossil-fuel power divisions.
   The majority of cuts will occur in the nuclear division,
which would bear $55 million of the spending cuts. The
planned reductions include 450 company positions and 650
positions now filled by contractors. The investor-owned
electric and gas utility has more than 11,000 employees,
excluding contract workers.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The company said that while it expects to achieve most of
the job reductions through attrition and streamlining of
current job responsibilities, 17 nuclear management employees
will be displaced this year.</p>
<p>The company is also seeking cost reductions of $9 million
in fossil-fuel generation and plans to eliminate 17 positions
in that division.</p>
<p>The cost-reduction measures are part of a continuing
program to improve operating efficiency, Niagara Mohawk said.
Similar efforts are under way in regional operations and
corporate departments, with implementation expected early
next year.</p>
<p>Niagara Mohawk experienced financial difficulties in
recent years, although reported earnings for fiscal 1990 are
more favorable. In fiscal 1989 ended June 30, the company's
earnings sank 36% to $105.6 million, or 78 cents a share,
from $159.7 million, or $1.21 a share, in 1988. Due to a
recent regulatory agreement that allowed it to recoup costs
on one of its reactors, earnings for 1990 rose back to $129.1
million, or 95 cents a share.</p>
<p>Niagara Mohawk serves two million electric and gas
customers throughout most of upstate New York.</p>
