	<p class="article-leader">In assembling "Court Arts of Indonesia" for New York's
Asia Society, Helen Ibbitson Jessup managed to persuade many
important Indonesians to relinquish their most private,
sacred treasures. Many of these objects, ranging from a
14th-century "modesty disc" to shadow puppets to gold ritual
vessels, had never before been shown to their own countrymen,
let alone foreigners. The decisions weren't made lightly. It
took two years for the Sultan of Bima, for example, to yield
his diamond-laden dagger and crown, two of the three objects
believed to legitimize his rule. (He held on to the third
one, an umbrella too large to travel.)
   "Under normal circumstances, people would not be willing
to part with these objects," says Ms. Jessup. "They realized
it was part of an enormous national effort."</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>That effort is aimed at putting Indonesia -- the world's
fifth most populous nation -- back on the map after 25 years
of obscurity. The "Court Arts" exhibit is just one of more
than 200 events in the $12 million, 18-month-long Festival of
Indonesia that was launched at the Kennedy Center in
Washington Sunday night. This cultural extravaganza promises
to bring an astonishing array of music, dance, theater,
puppetry, poetry, food, film, art and artifacts to cities and
towns across the U.S.</p>
<p>With a population of 180 million spread across an
archipelago of 13,000 islands, Indonesia probably is the
biggest place Americans know virtually nothing about. It
wasn't always that way. In the 1950s and early '60s,
Indonesia's flamboyant first president, Sukarno, made
headlines here, and Indonesia's growing Communist Party
alarmed U.S. policymakers.</p>
<p>But after Sukarno's fall and a swift, sweeping purge of
Communists in the mid'-60s, Indonesia slipped from view. "We
had to go through a period of looking inward and putting our
house back in order," says Foreign Minister Ali Alatas. "Now
we can say that we are on the right path. Our economy is
stronger by the day, and our political institutions are more
established."</p>
<p>The festival is only one reflection of this newfound
confidence. Recent moves to normalize relations with China,
strengthen ties with the Soviet Union, and host peace talks
on the Cambodia issue are other signs of Indonesia's desire
for a higher international profile. Cultural diplomacy,
however, may prove the trickiest kind to manage.</p>
<p>As the festival brings Indonesia's hidden treasures to
light, more sensitive matters also have emerged from the
shadows, and Indonesia finds itself the target of
unaccustomed -- and sometimes critical -- scrutiny by
outsiders. The Ford Foundation, which provided much of the
funding for the festival's performance-art component, also
gave the Social Science Research Council in New York $100,000
to coordinate a series of conferences.</p>
<p>"The committee felt that the thrust of the festival was an
Indonesian government attempt to present Indonesia in a very
favorable, uncritical light," says Toby Volkman, staff
associate at the council. "Our role, as scholars, is to be
more critical."</p>
<p>Cornell University held a well-attended conference in July
on the status of the Indonesian Chinese, and conferences on
deforestation, the role of women, and human rights in east
Timor have been scheduled elsewhere next year.</p>
<p>Foreign Minister Alatas says Indonesia is ready for open
debate on these issues. "We welcome anyone to discuss with us
our view on human rights, our philosophy of life. I welcome
discussion on East Timor," he says. "Just give me the same
time as my accuser."</p>
<p>Generally, however, the festival's organizers have shied
away from controversy, as befits a society based on the
virtues of consensus. "We thought the festival was an
occasion to create understanding and friendship, not to
create conflict," says former Foreign Minister Mochtar
Kusuma-Atmadja, chairman of the private Nusantara Jaya
Foundation in Jakarta, which put together the festival.</p>
<p>When American anthropologists wrote letters of protest
over the planned display of stolen effigies from Sulawesi
island -- arguing that the objects' value would increase and
thus encourage future theft -- festival organizers agreed
that only photographs of the objects be shown.</p>
<p>And when two Indonesian artists objected, in the
Indonesian press, to the festival's choice of paintings by
other artists "tainted" with former communist ties, nothing
happened. "I said, look, this is about art, not about
politics," recalls Mr. Mochtar. "We should show these
paintings on the merits themselves."</p>
<p>This purist position carried over to the marketing of the
festival. While the critical and commercial success of the
1986 Festival of India first inspired the Indonesians to come
up with their own version, they are avoiding the commercial
hoopla -- the Bergdorf and Bloomingdales tie-ins -- that
India was happy to permit. "Javanese reticence has probably
shown itself in the way this has been organized," says one
American official involved in the festival. "They are not
going to sell Indonesian T-shirts all over the place."</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the Indonesians and their American friends
are quietly working to ensure that the festival boosts trade,
investment and tourism in time for "Visit Indonesia Year --
1991." The American-Indonesian Chamber of Commerce will run
business seminars in 10 cities.</p>
<p>In the end, though, it is Indonesia's rich cultural
heritage that is most likely to bowl Americans over. The
excellent "Court Arts" show in Manhattan serves as the best
overall introduction, since it ranges from the highest forms
of religious art to wild-eyed leather puppets and precious
artifacts. One of the most striking objects is a 19th-century
"measure of a corpse," a series of gold plaques strung
together with wire, made so that the body "can be properly
reconstructed in its next incarnation." Turn-of-the-century
and contemporary photographs add context to the eclectic
display.</p>
<p>"Affandi in America," now on view in the Atrium at the
International Monetary Fund in Washington, provides a
colorful sampling of the contemporary Indonesian artist's
expressionism. "Many paintings epitomize the compassion,
humanity and liveliness he found in Indonesia's people,
especially the poor," writes the Smithsonian Institution's
Paul Michael Taylor, in the show's catalog.</p>
<p>And judging from the Kennedy Center gala, the performing
arts program promises to be exciting, even hypnotic. A row of
young men in orange-and-black batik costumes brought the
house down with their Islamic chanting and synchronized
rhythmic body movements. Their group -- Saman of Aceh,
Sumatra -- will appear in New York next March.</p>
<p>Washington also is the setting for another major festival
event, "The Sculpture of Indonesia," now at the National
Gallery of Art. For museumgoers familiar with Indian
sculpture, the Buddhist and Hindu forms may seem to be
nothing new, but the details of the smaller pieces command
attention.</p>
<p>One quibble: The introductory panel on the wall of the
first gallery and the brochure identify Indonesia as an
archipelago of "three thousand islands." What happened to the
other 10,000?</p>
<p>Curator Jan Fontein brushes off the blooper. "There are a
lot of islands, let me put it that way," he says. Mobil Oil,
which underwrote the show as part of its $2 million
contribution to the festival, may not be amused. Not to
mention the millions of Indonesians sent to oblivion.</p>
