	<p class="article-leader">To characterize President Carter's actions in 1979 with
respect to the price and supply of oil as "dithering" (as
Peter Truell does in the Aug. 20 Outlook column) is to ignore
the facts.
   The revolution in Iran began pushing up world oil prices
early in that year. U.S. oil prices were still controlled,
however, under the 1975 Energy Policy and Conservation Act.
As of June 1, 1979, the law gave the president discretionary
power to revise or eliminate oil-price controls. In fact,
President Carter did initiate gradual removal of controls
from specific categories of oil, with domestic crude prices
scheduled to reach the world price by September 1981, when
controls would expire. By the end of 1979, Congress had
passed a windfall-profits tax to collect about half of the
oil companies' gains from price decontrol.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Reliance on the market to moderate the effects of price
and quantity changes may not be immediately satisfying as a
military response. Before singing paeans to President Bush's
"decisive action," however, it is prudent to await the fat
lady's aria.</p>
