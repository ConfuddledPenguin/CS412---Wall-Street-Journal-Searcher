	<p class="article-leader">Latvia says it sighted two Iraqi missile ships training
with their Soviet teachers in the waters just off Bolderaja,
a suburb of Riga. Latvia's independence-minded government
immediately passed a resolution condemning the event and
demanded that all Iraqi soldiers "leave the territory of the
republic of Latvia." Moscow itself has said it would continue
to honor some old "contracts" with Iraq. We suppose that in
the larger geopolitical picture, the impact of a Baltic
republic's criticism of landlocked Iraq's navy doesn't loom
large. But as the West sorts out the question of who its new
friends are, it's worth noting that the Latvians had little
trouble deciding whose side they're on.</p>
