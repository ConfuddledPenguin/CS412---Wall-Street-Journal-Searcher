	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- While the world's two big auction houses won't
go so far as to concede the much-ballyhooed art boom is over,
they are retooling their sales strategies in hopes of taming
a difficult market.
   This week and early next week, the sales catalogs for the
1990 fall art auction season -- essentially the international
shopping list for art collectors world-wide -- go to press.
Last year, in the roughly three-month-long season, Sotheby's
Holdings Inc. and Christie's International PLC sold more than
$2 billion of art. But this year, they say they expect to
sell less.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"Every time we've had a dip in the economy, or times of
unrest, people tend to hold onto art objects until the price
is right for them," said John Marion, chairman of Sotheby's
Inc., the firm's New York auction unit. Reflecting the
concern of dealers and collectors, he said: "Everybody is
walking around asking: `What do you think is going to
happen?'"</p>
<p>The best guess: The flagship Impressionist and modern
paintings auctions, which generally set the tone for the
overall art market, will be appreciably smaller, according to
auction house officials. At these sales, scheduled for the
second week of November, not only will there be fewer
artworks for sale but, in some cases, the "reserves" the
auction house have set on paintings -- the minimum price the
seller will accept -- will be lower than they would have been
a year ago, said Christopher Davidge, the managing director
of Christie's International.</p>
<p>What Sotheby's and Christie's can't afford, auction house
officials concede, is a repeat of last spring's miserable
London art auctions. The majority of $300 million in
paintings and sculpture put on the auction block in June
failed to sell. Mr. Marion said the price estimates on the
artworks were so high they actually discouraged potential
bidders.</p>
<p>This time, the auction houses say, they won't make the
same mistake. Consider a hypothetical Pierre Auguste Renoir
purchased at auction in 1986 for $1 million that the owner is
seeking to put on the auction block with an estimated catalog
price of $2.5 million to $3 million. "That used to be an
acceptable risk" for Christie's, said Michael Findlay, head
of the firm's Impressionist and modern paintings department
in the U.S. "Now it is not." These days, he said, Christie's
would publish a price estimate of $1.5 million to $2 million
for such a painting. And the painting might not be accepted
for sale at all, given how recently it had been on the
market.</p>
<p>The auction houses are preparing the art market and their
shareholders for the possibility of a sharp drop in the fall
auction sales totals. Sotheby's, for example, is estimating
that its major fall Impressionist paintings auction will take
in about $80 million. Last May, Sotheby's major spring
Impressionist sale, boosted by the $78.1 million paid for
Renoir's "Au Moulin de la Galette," took in $286 million.</p>
<p>By reducing public expectations for the fall sales,
Sotheby's and Christie's, which together control almost 80%
of the art auction market, hope to prevent the slew of
"buy-ins," or unsold art works, that shook up the art world
this spring and sparked talk that the art boom was over. And
some experts believe that the auction houses may be
successful in preventing an art market panic with their
strategy of orchestrating smaller, but successful fall sales.</p>
<p>The sales will be missing the blockbuster masterpieces
that sold for $50 million or more in recent years, the
auction houses say. The highest estimates for any paintings
to be sold at the fall auction season are $28 million for a
painting by British artist John Constable at Sotheby's, and
$16 million for a Vincent van Gogh due on the block at
Christie's.</p>
<p>The wealthy art collectors who routinely consign works to
auction are noticeably skittish this year, anxious that their
artworks not become a test of the market.</p>
<p>Noticeably absent from this season's auction market is
John Whitney Payson, an art dealer with galleries in Maine,
New York and Florida who is one of the wealthiest art
collectors in the country. In recent years, Mr. Payson, or
members of his family, have been responsible for consigning
three of the 10 most expensive works ever sold at auction.
And in past years, the excitement and interest generated by
the Payson family masterpieces often spilled over into the
rest of the auction.</p>
<p>This year, Mr. Payson isn't selling a major painting from
his private collection. Reached at his Brunswick, Maine,
gallery, he said that when he sold van Gogh's "Irises" for
$54 million in November 1987, "the need was there and the
market was right. Now there's not the market, not the need,
and not the inclination."</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the big auction houses are tramping the globe
looking for new business. Sotheby's Holdings Inc. President
Michael A. Ainslie is temporarily relocating to the firm's
London office. He will be shoring up the operation in London,
where several major sales have flopped in the past few
months, and looking for new business through planned
Sotheby's expansions in France, Eastern Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>Similarly, Christie's has doubled its staff and auction
space in Paris, expecting increased business when trade
restrictions are eased in 1992, and is considering opening
offices in Frankfurt and Berlin, said Mr. Davidge. He added
that the firm's world-wide business -- as measured by the
value of artworks consigned for sale -- is running just below
the level of a year ago and above 1988's level.</p>
<p>While prices for Impressionist paintings "don't grow to
the sky," he said, other markets such as French furniture and
porcelain are continuing strong. However, they aren't as
profitable to the company as Impressionist pictures.</p>
<p>Overall, dealers, collectors and other art market players
are more cautious than bearish. Last year, for example, Ralph
Lerner, an estate attorney, consigned much of the late Lydia
Winston Malbin's collection of Italian futurist paintings and
sculpture to Sotheby's, where it sold well above estimate at
about $87 million. This year, both his dealer and estate
clients "are much more cautious," he said. "Nobody is sure
what the market is going to do, what the market is going to
tell us."</p>
<p>Said New York antiques dealer David Killen: "The status
antiques, the ones signed by the right artist, or with the
right marks or from the right collection, are still bringing
tremendous money. Everything else has plateaued, nothing has
crashed, and there's still so much money out there" to buy.</p>
