	<p class="article-leader">MOSCOW -- Central planning may be passe, but it isn't
dead. As the Kremlin prepares to introduce a market economy
soon, even the most capitalist-minded of the proposed reform
ideas will tell Soviet consumers what their minimum needs are
supposed to be.
   Current shortages are bad enough. But under proposed
guidelines, the average working-age man may soon be entitled
to an annual allotment -- at subsidized prices -- of only one
toothbrush, two ties and five rolls of toilet paper.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>These meager rations are part of a "minimum consumer
budget" drawn up last year by the State Labor Committee. They
will serve as a basis for a new basket of necessities that
would continue to have government subsidies under the most
radical of the proposed economic reform programs. Everything
not on the list will have to be purchased -- at much greater
expense -- on the open market.</p>
<p>That reform program is one of three now under debate in
the Soviet parliament. Authored by economist Stanislav
Shatalin, and backed by Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev
and Russian Republic leader Boris Yeltsin, it starts with
fiscal austerity and moves on to sweeping privatization and
decentralization -- all in just 500 days. The other programs
include a modified version of the Shatalin program, and a
slower-paced government proposal that starts with price
increases on consumer products and calls for less
privatization and partial decentralization.</p>
<p>The necessities list dissects all daily physical, mental
and emotional needs, giving a picture of Ivan Ivanovich's
life in the course of a year. That includes an egg every 2
1/2 days, and four visits to museums and 12 condoms a year.</p>
<p>The promise of fixed prices is small consolation for
consumers already unable to buy these items in the nation's
stores. There has been a gasoline shortage for weeks. Vodka,
the Russian cure for all ills, is practically a luxury. Even
eggs are disappearing.</p>
<p>Shortages come and go as if by magic. There was no soap
last year; now there's a surplus. The list of minimum needs
includes a weekly bath at a little more than two ounces of
bath soap a splash.</p>
<p>Then tobacco disappeared, giving the nation's heavy
smokers something else to fume about. Rationing was imposed,
limiting everyone to five packs a month. A black market in
ration coupons sprang up and the price of cigarettes tripled.</p>
<p>Then, suddenly, there was no bread. It was worst of all in
Moscow, but fear of shortages spread instantly and within two
days, lines formed at bread shops in the Soviet Far East. The
official explanation was the lack of labor and machinery, and
greedy grain farmers who refused to provide the cities with
their harvests.</p>
<p>But within a week, the bread shortage was gone. The
selection isn't quite what it used to be, but most shops have
at least two types of bread; some even have rolls and buns.
Lines are back to normal.</p>
<p>This haphazardness feeds the feeling that the economy is
falling out of control. As the government argues over how to
change the economy, it must also struggle to control the
current situation. That is made harder by a widespread belief
that the shortages are a conspiracy by hardliners to
undermine economic reform.</p>
<p>Rationing is the simplest way to restore control. It
usually calms the fury over shortages because it helps
regulate sales. Everything from flour to sausage is rationed
in Moscow and many other parts of the country. The sale of
such items is limited, and shoppers must show their
resident's card. When the cigarette shortage hit, Moscow's
Mayor Gavriil Popov told smokers to use their December sugar
coupons to buy tobacco in September.</p>
<p>One Muscovite complains that her tobacconist won't sell
cigarettes to women. Another shopper, Irina Ushakova
explains: "It's all a matter of personal relationships,
really. Because there aren't enough available, you have to
beg the guy to sell it to you rather than the next person."</p>
<p>The government also helps by boosting imports. In the past
few weeks, the government has brought in three billion
cigarettes and plans to import 32 billion more in the next
few months. Last year's soap shortage was followed by a surge
in soap imports. While these moves help ease the pain, they
add to the country's foreign debt. That in turn reduces
spending on real necessities such as medicine, where a major
shortage is just around the corner.</p>
<p>Another shortage on the agenda is heating oil. Already,
worried shoppers are talking about it as they stand in line
for eggs, fretting about power cuts if this winter turns out
to be colder than usual.</p>
<p>Meat is always scarce, a fact to which the Labor Committee
seems resigned: its list calls for a little more than two
pounds each of chicken, goose and duck per year, and 23
pounds each of beef, lamb and pork. Fish fills the gap to
bring the protein allowance to about six ounces a day.</p>
<p>The list of subsidized necessities also includes about one
loaf of bread a day. But the dessert menu might be
disappointing: for a year, only two-thirds of a pound of plum
cookies, 6.6 pounds of dry cookies, and a pound of strawberry
jam.</p>
<p>"It's an absolute joke," says plump Valya Zakharova, an
engineer who traveled two hours from home to shop in Moscow.
Adds her husband, Yura, a lanky army officer, "How can you
make people march in lock step like that -- so much macaroni,
so many potatoes? I like macaroni all right, but I don't like
potatoes. What am I supposed to do?"</p>
