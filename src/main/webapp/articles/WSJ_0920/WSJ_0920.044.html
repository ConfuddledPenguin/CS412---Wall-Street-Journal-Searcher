	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Small investors seeking punitive damages in
arbitration disputes with their brokers were dealt a setback
in a precedent-upsetting ruling by a federal judge.
   In a case that was closely watched on Wall Street, a
federal judge ruled that arbitrators don't always have the
power to award punitive damages in disputes with brokerage
firms.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The decision, by the influential southern district court
here, goes against several precedents and could significantly
affect arbitration cases nationwide. Punitive damages in
arbitration cases, although not commonplace, have more than
doubled in the past year.</p>
<p>Arbitration specialists blasted the ruling. "This decision
is a license to steal," asserted David Robbins, a former
arbitration director at the American Stock Exchange who
currently works for the New York law firm of Kaufmann Gilden
& Carlin and is an active arbitrator. "If a customer is
forced to go {to} arbitration, then arbitrators must have the
opportunity to consider punitive damages," he contended.</p>
<p>Investors typically sign an agreement when they open a
brokerage account that binds them to arbitration in case of a
dispute, rather than filing a lawsuit. Arbitration
specialists say investors are entitled to the same remedies
in arbitration that are available in litigation.</p>
<p>Punitive damages, which are generally awarded to punish
and deter a defendant found to have acted recklessly or
maliciously, are applied in addition to actual, or
compensatory, damages, which cover the loss.</p>
<p>A series of federal-court rulings in recent years have
found that arbitrators have the right to award punitive
damages under the Federal Arbitration Act.</p>
<p>But federal Judge Peter K. Leisure in his decision said
state law controls whether such damages are allowed. And New
York is one of the few states with a law barring punitive
awards in arbitration.</p>
<p>Judge Leisure's order stemmed from a case involving
Fahnestock & Co., a New York securities firm. Following a
complicated series of cross-claims, a New York Stock Exchange
panel in January awarded a former Fahnestock employee, Joseph
J. Waltman, $270,000 in damages and fees from the firm,
including $100,000 in punitive damages.</p>
<p>Fahnestock, a unit of Fahnestock-Viner Holdings Inc.,
moved to vacate the punitive damage award in a New York
federal court. It alleged that the arbitrators "exceeded
their powers" by granting punitive damages, citing a 1976 New
York state-court ruling.</p>
<p>Judge Leisure agreed, and threw out the punitive award. In
a 16-page opinion, the judge said that "the state substantive
law . . . regarding the inability of arbitrators to award
punitive damages is not in direct conflict with any express
provision of the Federal Arbitration Act."</p>
<p>Robert Scandone, Mr. Waltman's attorney in Philadelphia,
was stunned by the ruling. He called it "totally distinctive
from everything else we have ever seen." His client is
considering an appeal, Mr. Scandone said.</p>
<p>The ruling will immediately have an impact on arbitrators
and several appeals pending involving the applicability of
punitive damages, specialists say. Even in arbitration cases
filed outside New York, brokerage firms are likely to argue
that New York state law should govern if the disputed
transactions took place there, lawyers said.</p>
<p>"Arbitrators are going to be very much uncertain that they
have the power to award punitive damages -- and that
uncertainty is likely to lead them to forgo awarding them,"
says Richard Ryder, a former arbitration director at the
National Association of Securities Dealers and current editor
of the Securities Arbitration Commentator, a Maplewood, N.J.,
newsletter.</p>
<p>Look for brokerage firms to be less enthusiastic about
settling punitive claims, too. Heretofore, firms typically
have settled such cases because federal arbitration law
provides only a narrow window for reversing decisions.</p>
<p>Says Mr. Ryder of the decision: "It puts a tilt on the
balance in settlement negotiations."</p>
