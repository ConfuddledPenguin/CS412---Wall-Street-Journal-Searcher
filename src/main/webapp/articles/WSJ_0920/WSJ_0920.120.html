	<h3>Heard on the Street: MBIA Feels Brunt of Fears On Municipals</h3>

	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Wall Street is suddenly worried about
municipal bond insurers and is taking out its fears with a
vengeance on insurer MBIA.
   With the city of Philadelphia in financial distress and
the condition of other state and local governments worsening,
investors now say a default by one or more issuers of
tax-exempt bonds isn't out of the question.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>And if such a default were to occur, the companies that
insure municipal bonds would take a hit. The largest such
firm -- and the only publicly traded one -- is MBIA, based in
Armonk, N.Y., and 27%-owned by Aetna Life & Casualty.</p>
<p>As recently as June, underwriters sold 6.6 million MBIA
shares to the public at 36 1/4 each. The stock reached 44 in
July. But this week, as fears related to Philadelphia
gathered steam, MBIA shares plummeted 3 1/2 Tuesday and a
further 3 3/8 yesterday to close at 28 1/2.</p>
<p>Yesterday's slump in the stock occurred even though MBIA
announced that it would reinstitute a share-buy-back program
to acquire as many as one million of its common shares.
Meanwhile Fund American Cos.,which owns 23.5% of MBIA, fell 1
3/4 to 44 7/8 yesterday while Cigna, which owns 11.6%, rose
slightly.</p>
<p>"There is a perception that with cities there isn't any
risk, and that isn't true," says Mark Cohen, head of the
financial guaranty rating group at Fitch Investors Service, a
credit-rating concern. "Cities and counties go through
periods of indigestion. The question is whether it's fatal."</p>
<p>The immediate cause of the slide in MBIA's stock seems to
be that it insures $122 million of Philadelphia's
general-obligation bonds, entailing total debt service of
$197 million. It also insures a larger amount of Philadelphia
bonds backed by "dedicated" revenue streams, such as those of
the local airport.</p>
<p>Yesterday, MBIA quickly moved to calm investors' fears by
pointing out that its exposure to Philadelphia is relatively
modest, compared with the company's capital base of $773
million.</p>
<p>If Philadelphia were to default on its general-obligation
bonds, MBIA would be on the hook first for $9 million in
1991, then for $29 million more in 1992. MBIA, which
guarantees both principal and interest payments, doesn't take
any reserve. Thus, if it were forced to bail out an issuer,
the total would come out of its earnings.</p>
<p>However, it's unlikely that a full write-off would be
necessary. Moreover, the par value of Philadelphia
general-obligation bonds insured by MBIA -- which don't fully
mature until the year 2016 -- is less than its 1989 pretax
profit of $135 million.</p>
<p>MBIA says that it has never had a claim, a boast that few
other insurers can make. Standard & Poor's yesterday
reaffirmed that bonds insured by MBIA are rated Triple-A. An
S&P analyst added: "We have no problems with the credit."</p>
<p>At the very least, the municipal bond market values
MBIA-insured bonds much more highly than non-insured issues.
According to MBIA, Philadelphia bonds that it has insured
yield 1.57 percentage points less than uninsured bonds --
meaning the insured bonds are considered less risky by
investors.</p>
<p>As with most insurers, MBIA earns money on its investment
portfolio, which totals $1.63 billion. Unlike most others,
MBIA also makes a profit on insurance underwriting.</p>
<p>Essentially, bulls on MBIA's stock see America's crumbling
inner-city infrastructure as proof that the volume of
municipal-bond issues -- and thus of insurance -- should
rise.</p>
<p>According to MBIA, the total volume of municipal bond
offerings in the U.S. increased 6% in the first half of 1990.
The percentage of such bond issues carrying insurance edged
up to 27%, from 24% in the first half of 1989.</p>
<p>Harvey H. Bundy, an analyst with William Blair who
recommends MBIA stock, says: "A lot of places {cities} don't
look so good, but all of these problems are ones that
politicians are going to have to solve."</p>
<p>He adds that when MBIA insures a bond, it collects the
entire fee up-front but books the fee into its earnings over
the life of the bond. MBIA's deferred fees, which will show
up as profit in later years, have a current net value of
about $110 million.</p>
<p>"I like the stock because of the predictability of the
income stream," Mr. Bundy says, adding: "The stock market is
worried that every gnat is part of a swarm, and that every
mosquito carries malaria."</p>
<p>MBIA's stock, however, still trades at a premium to its
roughly $23-a-share book value. And, unlike other insurers,
that book value doesn't reflect reserves for potential
problems.</p>
<p>MBIA's total exposure as of June 30 was $148 billion,
equal to 191 times its capital. Mr. Cohen says that this
multiple -- a measure of an insurer's level of risk -- is the
highest in the industry. He added, however, that without
knowing the quality of a company's credits, it is difficult
to judge the true level of risk.</p>
<p>MBIA said it takes reserves on a case-by-case basis. It
said it doesn't know how much it would reserve if
Philadelphia defaulted. Standard & Poor's has lowered its
rating on Philadelphia's general-obligation bonds to
triple-C, the lowest rating for bonds that aren't yet behind
in payments.</p>
<p>S&P also lowered ratings on bonds of related city
authorities and water, sewer and airport revenue bonds.
Following the recent scuttling of a plan to float short-term
notes, officials have said that Philadelphia is in danger of
running out of cash late this year.</p>
<p>The concern among bearish investors is that problems may
spread beyond Philadelphia. MBIA, in a conference call with
investors yesterday, disclosed that it is monitoring 130
issues -- representing about 3% of its exposure -- for
possible problems.</p>
<p>Most of these bonds aren't thought to be in as serious a
shape as Philadelphia's. "The situation is confined to
Philadelphia," David Elliott, MBIA's president, said in the
conference call. "We don't see any similar situations, " he
added.</p>
<p>But Mr. Elliott also noted that until quite recently,
Philadelphia wasn't on its watch list either. "It happened
very fast," he said.</p>
<p>Thus, some investors wonder how anyone can be sure that
other cities, towns and agencies -- especially in the
depressed Northeast -- won't suddenly develop problems.</p>
<p>Cities in New York, Pennsylvania, Massachusetts and
Michigan are of particular concern. And with Congress now
thinking of cutting the federal tax deduction for state and
local income taxes, all municipalities could find it tougher
to raise funds.</p>
<p>"You have very high state and local government deficits,
which are starting to bust out of budget projections," says
one municipal bond specialist, adding: "There will be other
Philadelphias."</p>
