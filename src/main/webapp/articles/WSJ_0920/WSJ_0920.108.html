	<p class="article-leader">If Swatch Name Sells
   Watches, Why Not Cars?</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>THIS MAY BE the ultimate brand extension: Swatch, creator
of the disposable watch, is coming out with a car.</p>
<p>No kidding, according to Ernst Thomke, an executive vice
president of SMH, Swatch's parent. The Swatch car, due out on
the road in three years, will be a real passenger vehicle,
albeit a tiny one. Designed for city use rather than long
hauls on the open highway, the cars will be priced comparably
to other compacts. Mr. Thomke adds that one of the two Swatch
car models will be powered by electricity.</p>
<p>Swatch revolutionized the market for watches in the early
1980s, with its light-hearted, inexpensive timepieces. But
for most consumers, the name Swatch stands for trendy and
cheap -- hardly a desirable image for a car. "A Swatch is a
$35 throwaway," says Al Ries, chairman of Trout & Ries, a
consulting firm. "The last thing you want to communicate in a
car is disposability."</p>
<p>But SMH is known for a lot more than plastic timepieces.
The Swiss company also makes medical laser systems and
machine tools and plans to manufacture the car's key
electronic systems. It will probably rely on a European auto
maker to manufacture the car's body, though no supplier has
been chosen.</p>
<p>The Swatch car may get a boost from state regulators, who
are pressuring auto makers to offer "ultra-clean" vehicles.</p>
<p>General Motors has already said it plans to start
producing an electric passenger car, although it won't say
exactly when. GM unveiled a sporty-looking electric show
model called "Impact" earlier this year, also designed for
city commuting. "We would expect to see a number of companies
considering entering the electric-vehicle market right now,"
says a GM spokesman.</p>
<p>Mr. Thomke is undaunted by marketing critics. "Swatch is a
well-known brand name worldwide," he says. "We don't want to
produce throwaway cars. We never planned to produce throwaway
watches."</p>
<p>Pam Charges Pan Lite</p>
<p>Violates Its Trademark</p>
<p>THE MAKER of Pam, a vegetable spray that keeps food from
sticking to pans, is turning up the heat under one tiny
competitor.</p>
<p>American Home Products filed suit in federal court in
Chicago charging Stuart Hale Co. with violating its
trademark. The sticking point: In 1988, Stuart Hale, based in
Chicago, began marketing a food spray called Pan Lite. It had
sales of nearly $38,500 last year, mainly in Illinois.</p>
<p>American Home contends that the name Pan Lite too closely
resembles its own Pam brand name. The similarity is likely to
confuse consumers, according to court papers filed by the
company, and could lead them to believe Pan Lite is made by
American Home. The suit seeks to bar sales of Pan Lite.</p>
<p>But American Home has another agenda, says Jerome
Schulman, 77 years old, who runs Stuart Hale. He has sold
nonstick solutions to bakers under such names as Pan Rite and
Pan Aide for decades. He says American Home sent him a letter
stating, "We have no objection to the continued use of the
prefix Pan on an aerosol product with any number of
acceptable suffixes." The letter even suggests Pan Glide.</p>
<p>If the problem isn't the word Pan, why the lawsuit? "What
they really want is the word `Lite,'" Mr. Schulman says. He
believes American Home wants to reserve the option of
introducing a light product under the Pam brand, but failed
to apply for the trademark quickly enough.</p>
<p>An American Home attorney won't comment. Any plans the
company might have for a "lite" product under its Pam brand
would be proprietary, he says.</p>
<p>Toiletries for Kids</p>
<p>Wash Away Parental Guilt</p>
<p>WISH YOU COULD spend a little more time with your kids?</p>
<p>A flock of marketers are betting that kind of yuppie guilt
will encourage parents to buy a host of fancy new shampoos,
body lotions and even deodorants designed to pamper children.</p>
<p>S.C. Johnson & Sons launched a line of kids' products
under the Fisher-Price brand, and Revlon will roll out bubble
bath and shampoo featuring Nintendo characters. William &
Clarissa, based in Laguna Hills, Calif., recently began
selling trendy toiletries under the Kids brand in 20,000
stores nationwide. And BertSherm Products, Cleveland, sells a
natural deodorant for kids called Fun 'n Fresh through 5,000
outlets.</p>
<p>The upstarts face tough competition. Johnson & Johnson,
which introduced Johnson's baby shampoo in 1954, continues to
rule the category. But the appeal of the kiddie market is
clear: Sales of children's personal-care products reached
about $360 million last year and are growing at an annual
rate of more than 10%.</p>
<p>Marketers say parents are having fewer kids and are
willing to lavish more money on each. And the fancy soaps are
cheap enough to spur impulse buying.</p>
<p>Not all the products may warm parents' hearts, however.
Cosrich of Perth Amboy, N.J., plans a line of toiletries
inspired by "The Simpsons" TV show, including Radical Hair
Stuff, a styling gel that lets kids imitate the spiky 'do of
the puckish Bart Simpson.</p>
<p>Odds and Ends</p>
<p>HILTON HOTELS will license the name of the Waldorf-Astoria
hotel for a line of home furnishings, including china and
upholstery. . . . Loews Theaters is planning to expand the
number of movie houses showing art films. Loews has two art
houses slated for cities in Kentucky and will consider
dedicating theaters in other medium-sized cities to highbrow
fare. One drawback: Loews doesn't sell as much popcorn at
these flicks.</p>
