	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- The National Cancer Institute found that
people who live near nuclear facilities don't face a greater
risk of death from cancer than those who live elsewhere.
   The NCI compared mortality data in 107 counties
surrounding all 62 U.S. nuclear facilities -- 52 commercial
power plants, nine Department of Energy research and weapons
plants, and one commercial fuel-reprocessing plant -- in
operation before 1982 with data from demographically similar
counties that weren't close to nuclear facilities.
Researchers found "no evidence to suggest that the occurrence
of leukemia or any other form of cancer was generally higher
in the study counties than the control counties."</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Both proponents and opponents of nuclear power agree that
the NCI survey is the nation's most comprehensive assessment
of the relationship between proximity to nuclear facilities
and cancer mortality.</p>
<p>But Sen. Edward Kennedy (D., Mass.), who requested the
study, said the study "isn't a clean bill of health for the
nuclear industry" because it didn't go far enough. In
contrast, the U.S. Council for Energy Awareness, a nuclear
trade group, said the study "should put the public at ease
that living near a nuclear plant isn't harmful to their
health."</p>
<p>No matter how reassuring its findings, the study isn't
likely to improve the prospects for the construction of new
nuclear plants. Because of concerns about cost, nuclear waste
disposal, safety and regulatory delay, there hasn't been an
order for a new nuclear plant in the U.S. since 1978.</p>
