	<p class="article-leader">A federal advisory panel will urge the U.S. to revive its
lagging fusion energy program.
   Specifically, the panel wants the U.S. both to build a new
experimental fusion power machine of its own and to join an
international effort to build an even bigger fusion machine.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The panel is expected to call on Energy Secretary James D.
Watkins to reverse a decision last year that severely cut
back the long-running effort to harness for electric power
production the hydrogen fusion process that fuels the sun.
Last year's cutback mainly shelved construction of the
so-called compact ignition tokamak and delayed committing the
U.S. to participate in the International Thermonuclear
Experimental Reactor, or ITER.</p>
<p>The compact ignition tokamak, if built, would be the first
experimental machine ever to ignite a fusion fire. The
international experimental fusion reactor would be aimed at
testing the engineering aspects of a fusion power plant.</p>
<p>The report urging these and other fusion projects is
expected to be submitted to the energy secretary later this
week by the fusion policy advisory committee; its chairman is
H. Guyford Stever, former head of the National Science
Foundation.</p>
<p>In its report, a final draft of which was obtained by The
Wall Street Journal, the advisory committee argues that
fusion energy is gaining new importance, in light of the
Mideast crisis and growing concern about the environmental
consequences of burning oil and coal. "Fusion is one of the
very few energy options that offer an essentially
inexhaustible and widely available fuel supply," it notes.
Moreover, it declares, fusion is safer than atomic power,
producing only one-millionth of the nuclear waste and a
ten-millionth of the radioactivity that a present-day atomic
power plant produces.</p>
<p>Energy Secretary Watkins set up the committee last March,
after Robert O. Hunter, the Energy Department's departing
director of energy research, urged a new policy that would
have forced a choice between two roads to useful hydrogen
fusion energy. One road, known as inertial confinement, which
Mr. Hunter favored, uses superpowerful laser beams to
compress a tiny pellet of hydrogen suddenly and ignite a
fusion fire. This laser road to fusion is interwoven with the
Defense Department's development of powerful laser weapons
research, and thus much of the research is secret.</p>
<p>The other, much older, method road, called magnetic
confinement, ignites a fusion fire in a superhot gas of
hydrogen confined inside invisible "bottles" created by
powerful magnets. The magnetic road to fusion, lacking
military value, has been a unique example of open
international cooperation since President Eisenhower's Atoms
for Peace Conference in 1958. Most magnetic fusion machines,
including the two projects Mr. Hunter, the departing Energy
Department official, shelved last year, are based on a Soviet
doughnut-shaped design called a tokamak.</p>
<p>The committee argues that "the two approaches to civilian
fusion energy are not yet ready for a choice of one over the
other."</p>
<p>It notes that magnetic confinement is more advanced than
the laser-based method, but that some concepts, if proven
experimentally, might give the inertial method an advantage
in developing a useful fusion power plant.</p>
<p>The report emphasizes reviving the U.S. magnetic
confinement program. It recommends that the federal budget
for magnetic confinement research be increased to $420
million in fiscal 1992 from $318 million in fiscal 1990 and
steadily increased to $620 million by fiscal 1996. Each
fiscal year begins Oct. 1.</p>
<p>Acceding, however, to Energy Secretary Watkins's warning
last July that an "ideal" fusion program is unlikely this
year, the panel is offering a "constrained budget," in which
magnetic confinement research funding would rise to $385
million in the next fiscal year, instead of $420 million, and
to $470 million in 1996, in current dollars, instead of $620
million.</p>
<p>Even with the "constrained budget," the committee urges
Mr. Watkins to revive the two magnetic confinement projects
with tokamaks that were delayed last year under Mr. Hunter,
the departing Energy Department official. The major U.S.
tokamak is in New Jersey at Princeton University's Plasma
Physics Laboratory. Two larger tokamaks are operating
overseas, one in England funded by the European Community and
one in Japan. The Soviets also have an advanced tokamak
machine in operation.</p>
<p>Within the next few weeks, the U.S. and European machines
are expected to reach the so-called break-even reaction, in
which the fusion of hydrogen atoms will release as much
energy as it took to force them to fuse.</p>
<p>The Soviets, the Europeans and the Japanese have agreed
that the next step in fusion research should be an
international joint effort to build a much larger tokamak to
test the engineering problems of a fusion power plant. So
far, the U.S. has participated in design studies for the
ITER, the International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor,
but has avoided committing itself to helping build the
reactor.</p>
<p>The other delayed project, the compact ignition tokamak,
is an exclusive U.S. effort to build a magnetic machine that
would ignite the world's first controlled fusion fire, that
is, a hydrogen fusion reaction that would sustain itself, as
well as produce more energy than it consumed.</p>
<p>The U.S. should move along rapidly on both projects, the
committee says. If built, the compact ignition tokamak would
ignite a fusion fire as long as 15 years before the ITER
could do so. Thus, the compact ignition tokamak would answer
many questions that would affect the design of the bigger
international machine and restore the U.S. lead in fusion
research, the report declares. At the same time,
participation in the ITER would maintain U.S. influence on
the ultimate development of fusion power.</p>
<p>Even under a constrained budget, outlays for the ITER
should be raised to $40 million in the next fiscal year from
$16 million in fiscal 1990, the committee says. Building of
the ignition tokamak in the U.S. should be started with a
budget boost to $40 million next year from last year's $17
million.</p>
<p>For the laser-based inertial fusion effort, the committee
says current research isn't an energy program but a defense
program, "which is generating information valuable to the
nuclear weapons program."</p>
