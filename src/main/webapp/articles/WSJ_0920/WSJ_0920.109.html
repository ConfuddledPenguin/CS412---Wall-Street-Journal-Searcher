	<p class="article-leader">LUBBOCK, Texas - Furr's/Bishop's Cafeterias L.P. said it
won't pay the regularly scheduled cash dividend of 32.5 cents
a preferred and subordinated unit for the third quarter.
   The decision was a previously announced but unreported
part of a proposal made to unitholders last week by the
general partner, Cavalcade & Co., to convert the master
limited partnership to corporate ownership.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Under the proposal, for each partnership unit owned,
Furr's/Bishop's 20,000 public limited partners would receive
75 cents in cash, one-fourth of a common share, and
six-tenths of a share of $9 convertible preferred stock. The
convertible preferred would have a stated cumulative annual
dividend of $1.12 a share, payable quarterly, increasing to
$1.80 a share on the 10th anniversary of the merger.</p>
<p>The proposed conversion has been deemed fair by an
independent committee of the Furr's/Bishop's board and its
financial adviser, Bear, Stearns & Co., but must be approved
by a majority of the preferred and subordinated units.</p>
<p>If the proposed corporate conversion doesn't take place,
the partnership said it will reconsider paying the 32.5
cents-a-unit dividend for the third quarter to preferred
units only.</p>
