	<p class="article-leader">Three cheers for the court system.
   Cheer Number One: To the Appellate Division of the New
York State Supreme Court, which last week overruled a lower
court's ban on the publication of a book by a former member
of the Israeli intelligence service.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Israel had claimed that the safety of its intelligence
agents would be endangered by the publication of "By Way of
Deception: A Devastating Insider's Portrait of the Mossad."
Michael Dontzin, a New York judge, agreed, and he temporarily
blocked publication of the book in the United States.</p>
<p>That was just an awful ruling.</p>
<p>The glory of democracy is that anyone can say anything.
Sometimes, those things that are said are lies. Sometimes
they're evil. Sometimes they hurt people. Sometimes they're
obscene. Sometimes they're inane.</p>
<p>But never, never in this land can anyone stop us in
advance from saying what we want.</p>
<p>That was established in 1931 when the court ruled that Jay
Near, a bigot and extortionist who ran a sleazy newspaper in
Minnesota, couldn't be barred from writing what he thought.
That doctrine prohibiting so-called prior restraints of the
press was reaffirmed decades later in the Pentagon Papers
cases.</p>
<p>And last week it was reaffirmed again. I have no idea
whether Victor Ostrovsky, the former Israeli spy, is a good
guy or a bad guy. But that makes no difference. For, as
Justice Felix Frankfurter wrote in 1950, "It is a fair
summary of history to say that the safeguards of liberty have
frequently been forged in controversies involving not very
nice people."</p>
<p>Cheer Number Two: To the Judicial Conference, which is the
policy-making body of the federal court system.</p>
<p>Last week, the Judicial Conference voted to allow cameras
into federal courtrooms. It's just a three-year experiment.
It's just in six district courts and two appellate courts.
And it's just for civil trials. But, still, it's good news.</p>
<p>The hallmark of democracy is openness. But for 50 years,
the federal court system has barred cameras and broadcasting
equipment from its courtrooms. In the past 10 years, more
than 40 states have opened their own courts to cameras, and
that has been informative and instructive. Sure, TV stations
go in and pick out the dramatic confrontation, the telling
sound bite. But they also show longer segments, they
familiarize Americans with the system, and they show
democracy at work.</p>
<p>Our judicial system is, after all, the real people's
court. But few people have the time or inclination actually
to visit a court just to watch a trial. Now we can do that on
TV, we can see how our people's court outshines "The People's
Court."</p>
<p>Cheer Number Three: To Glenn E. Pille, a state district
judge in Des Moines. He ruled that my friend Gil Cranberg is
a journalist and that the county attorney should quit messing
around with him.</p>
<p>Gil Cranberg is the retired editor of the editorial pages
of the Des Moines Register, and he kept his sense of outrage
-- a must for any good editorial writer -- after he retired.
One thing he was outraged about was a race track built near
Des Moines with money that was backed by the county without
any votes of the people, so he continued to write about it
for the Register. The county people and the race-track people
think Mr. Cranberg is a nag and they're especially defensive
about the deal because the race track has been finishing out
of the money ever since it opened. Mr. Cranberg points this
out with a certain regularity, maybe even a little glee.</p>
<p>On Aug. 14, the county subpoenaed Mr. Cranberg and told
him to bring all documents he had regarding absolutely any
matter relative to the Prairie Meadows track. The subpoena
was tangential to a class-action lawsuit about the track, a
lawsuit that Mr. Cranberg is not involved in except as a
resident of the county.</p>
<p>The subpoena was clearly just harassment, and it worked:
it messed up Mr. Cranberg's life and work, causing him to
devote precious time to fighting the subpoena and pre-empting
him from gathering any more information on the track because
of the fear he would have to disclose sources and hand over
documents and notes.</p>
<p>But last Thursday, Judge Pille saw through the whole
thing.</p>
<p>He quashed the subpoena and re-iterated the role of a free
press. It was quick justice.</p>
<p>The country is a little better off today because of the
appellate decision in New York, the vote of the Judicial
Conference, and the ruling by Judge Pille.</p>
<p>The press can be jerks, but that's not the point. The
point was made 20 years ago by federal Judge Murray Gurfein
when the government tried to stop newspapers from printing
the Pentagon Papers.</p>
<p>"The security of the Nation is not at the ramparts alone,"
he wrote. "Security also lies in the value of our free
institutions. A cantankerous press, an obstinate press, a
ubiquitous press must be suffered by those in authority in
order to preserve the even greater values of freedom of
expression and the right of the people to know. . . . These
are troubled times. There is no greater safety valve for
discontent and cynicism about the affairs of Government than
freedom of expression in any form."</p>
