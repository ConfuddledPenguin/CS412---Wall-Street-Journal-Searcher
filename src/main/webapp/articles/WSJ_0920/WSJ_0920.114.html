	<p class="article-leader">ROCKLAND, Maine -- Up here among the tranquil pine groves
and birches, the most bitter fight in Maine political history
is brewing.
   On one side is the incumbent Republican governor, himself
a former congressman and the husband of a popular
congresswoman. On the other side is the Democratic
congressman from the southern district of the state, himself
a former two-term governor.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The two, Gov. John McKernan and Rep. Joseph Brennan,
swapped jobs four years ago in a celebration of civility
played out in the drawing rooms of Augusta's Blaine House,
the elegant governor's mansion with its two-toned mahogany
and birch floor. But the political quadrille, fashioned in a
state where voters' ears search for the call of the lonely
loon and the coastal foghorn rather than the charge and
countercharge of political rhetoric, has turned into a
quarrel.</p>
<p>Now Gov. McKernan, struggling with a regional economic
downturn that may turn five of the six New England governors
out of office, and Rep. Brennan, impatient after four years
of exile in the back benches of Congress, are engaged in an
election fight that has shattered the serenity of a state
where, as turn-of-the-century writer Rosalind Richards wrote,
the fragrance distilled by the needles of the white pine,
black spruce and balsam fir is "surely the very breath of New
England."</p>
<p>The result is a close, acrid campaign that has left even
independent observers with a vague sense of uneasiness. "We
don't know how to handle a race where someone isn't up 30
points," says Christian Potholm, a Bowdoin College political
scientist. "This is the first time we have had two
heavyweights in the ring at the same time."</p>
<p>Now that the political idyll of Mr. McKernan and Mr.
Brennan has gone sour, all of the assumptions of the state's
politics have turned upside down and inside out.</p>
<p>"I don't understand this campaign at all," says Anthony
Buxton, an Augusta attorney and former Democratic state
chairman. "The incumbent is running like a challenger and the
challenger is running like an incumbent. The Republican is
saying he's a progressive and the Democrat is saying he's a
fiscal conservative."</p>
<p>The fight is being conducted against the backdrop of
economic distress that has prompted three Democratic
governors in New England not to seek re-election this autumn
and has imperiled both Edward DiPrete, the GOP governor of
Rhode Island, and Mr. McKernan. Only GOP Gov. Judd Gregg in
devoutly Republican New Hampshire seems safe.</p>
<p>Although Maine -- more commodity-oriented and less
high-tech than the five other states of the region -- has
weathered the storm better than its sister states, the
real-estate free fall hasn't hit bottom yet. There is
apprehension among bankers and uncertainty among workers at
Bath Iron Works, the state's biggest employer and, with its
trade in warships, a leading indicator of the economic
consequences of the end of the Cold War. The Maine State
Planning Office reported recently that second-quarter taxable
retail sales in the state had dropped 5% from a year earlier
and -- two other warning signals -- that building-supply and
automobile sales were down 12%. The fiscal year ended June 30
was the first year ever that retail sales in Maine dropped
below the previous year.</p>
<p>"I could have picked a better time to run for
re-election," Mr. McKernan says. "I'm the guy in office when
there's a lot of legitimate concern about where the economy
is going. The economy was red hot -- and then it dropped
dead. But this condition didn't start at the bridge between
New Hampshire and Maine. It's everywhere up here in New
England."</p>
<p>The economy gave Mr. Brennan the opening to attempt his
return to the governor's office. He's criticized Gov.
McKernan's handling of a $210 million projected budget
shortfall -- the governor boasts of having closed it without
raising new taxes -- and set off a series of thrusts and
parries that dominated the campaign for months.</p>
<p>Rep. Brennan is warning that the next governor "will end
up facing the biggest fiscal mess in Maine history," and is
charging that Mr. McKernan's budget, which calls for
double-digit growth in general revenue at a time when the
economy is flat, is so "phony" that it can be balanced only
if "Santa Claus deposits huge checks right after the
election."</p>
<p>Mr. McKernan's response in a recent televised debate: "We
don't have a `fiscal mess' in Augusta. That's what they have
in Massachusetts. We have tight financial times." In an
interview, the governor adds that his rival "would have
handled this the way Michael Dukakis did, and we'd have had
$100 million in new taxes."</p>
<p>Even so, the economy has hurt Gov. McKernan's prospects,
especially among flinty Republicans who pride themselves on
their fiscal rectitude and are, as Mr. Brennan crows,
"offended at the way the finances have been handled." Charles
Moreshead, a former Republican chairman supporting Rep.
Brennan, says the ailing economy may not be Mr. McKernan's
fault "but since we are in this mess, I don't think McKernan
can pull us out of it."</p>
<p>Gov. McKernan says the state's economic condition is
"manageable," and he hopes to use a second term to
restructure the state's education-funding formulas and
increase the school year, currently a low 170 days, to 180 or
even 190 days -- an emotional issue in a state where, just
this month, some authorities closed schools so youngsters
could help pick the record blueberry crop.</p>
<p>For his part, Rep. Brennan wants to "jump start" the
economy by getting more than $200 million of construction
projects under way, by seeking a bond issue to provide
reduced mortgages and spur home construction, and by
providing matching funds to communities to improve downtown
areas.</p>
<p>But Gov. McKernan's strategy is to move the debate off the
economy. He believes, moreover, that his winning margin could
come from independent and Democratic women who might be drawn
into his camp by his wife, GOP Rep. Olympia Snowe; by his
appointments of women to top cabinet jobs, and by his
longtime support for abortion rights. Rep. Brennan was a late
convert to the abortion-rights movement.</p>
<p>The race between the two men underlines a pervasive
distrust of Washington and discomfort with the federal
government. "The fact that both of us left Congress to run
for governor tells you a lot," says Gov. McKernan.</p>
<p>The governor says he's "not patient enough for Congress."
Rep. Brennan, who lived with his widowed sister in a
Washington suburb and grew weary of his 30-minute commute
through crowded urban streets, seems to have felt diminished
by his journey from the governor's mansion to the rear of the
congressional pack.</p>
<p>Besides, Maine has its lures. Rep. Brennan, for example,
relinquished his spot in the House seniority queue in 1987
when he held onto the Maine governorship for a few extra days
so as to serve out every moment of his term. Today, he
stations his press secretary, Barbara Reinertsen, in Portland
rather than on Capitol Hill, where most House press
secretaries work. He has returned to Maine the past 70
weekends in a row.</p>
<p>With two familiar figures contending for the same office,
a lot of voters find the decision wrenching. "This is one
election in the country where the voters won't feel they're
choosing the lesser of two evils," says Douglas Rooks, the
editorial-page editor of the Kennebec Journal newspaper. "A
lot of people are going to be making up their minds in the
car on the way to the polls."</p>
