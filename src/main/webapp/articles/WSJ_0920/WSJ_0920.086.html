	<p class="article-leader">In an effort to add a new twist to the old tactic of radio
promotion, the ABC network plans an aggressive campaign in
five big U.S. markets designed to woo coveted 18-to-34
year-old viewers to three of its fall TV programs.
   The radio campaign, which is just now getting under way,
involves elaborate deals with popular radio personalities who
have agreed to host offbeat, sometimes gimmicky, special
events and award prizes such as a "Twin Peaks" T-shirt, a
"Cop Rock" cap or a "China Beach" cassette tape.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>All of the networks air radio ads and run promotions to
pitch their shows. But ABC says its promotion is different
from other networks' "watch and win" ads, which award prizes
to TV viewers who can answer trivia questions about their
shows. ABC says its promotions, instead, have been designed
to create long-term interest by playing on the shows'
creative appeal.</p>
<p>"It's an extension of the entertainment," says Mark
Zakarin, vice president of marketing at ABC Entertainment.
"This isn't `We're going to give you something just so you'll
watch it.'"</p>
<p>The promotions are different in each market. In Chicago,
for example, radio station WKQX will host an event to promote
"Twin Peaks" called "Hide the Body." Chicagoans driving to
work will be challenged to locate a local radio personality
who is wrapped in plastic and hiding somewhere in the city.
The other markets are New York, Los Angeles, Philadelphia and
San Francisco.</p>
<p>Executives at rival network CBS scoffed at the plan,
saying the Capital Cities/ABC network is just scrambling to
play catch-up because it doesn't have a link with a major
retailer or fast-food chain to boost its fall-season
fortunes. CBS is in the midst of a giant promotion with K
mart; General Electric's NBC has linked with McDonald's.</p>
<p>"We all do very aggressive local marketing," says George
Schweitzer, senior vice president at CBS. "Radio was very
effective in helping `Uncle Buck' beat `The Fresh Prince of
Bel-Air' {on NBC} this week."</p>
<p>John D. Miller, executive vice president of marketing at
NBC, said his network, too, has explored the options of
expanded radio promotions. "At this point, the networks are
looking at every possible vehicle to reach a consumer that's
going to watch TV. We're all screaming loud in as many places
as we can."</p>
<p>Mr. Zakarin insists the ABC promotions are different
because they are so highly targeted and are designed to build
enthusiasm among specific viewer prospects. ABC developed the
program with its ad agency, Grey Advertising, and Local
Marketing Corp. of Cincinnati.</p>
<p>Further, he says the real value of the program is in the
"stamp of editorial endorsement" that the shows will get from
the radio personalities, who will talk about the shows on the
air. "People spend time every morning on their way to work
listening to these personalities and they have an important
connection with them. It's kind of akin to when Johnny Carson
on `The Tonight Show' says something positive about a movie
he recently saw."</p>
<p>ABC has been an outspoken critic of the giant
cross-promotions the other networks have coordinated. "Our
research indicated that there was only a negligible increase
in sampling as a result of those cross promotions" last year,
Mr. Zakarin says. "With those promotions, you end up spending
an awful lot of air time not promoting your shows, but
promoting contests."</p>
<p>New CBS shows attracted lots of viewers early in the fall
of 1989 following the network's first promotion with K mart.
But later, the network had its worst showing ever in the
critical November "sweeps" rating period, suggesting viewers
watched some shows once or twice, but then left in droves.</p>
<p>For now, Mr. Zakarin is betting the targeted radio
promotions will help to stir up grassroots support for the
shows. TV ads are still the network's best weapon for
promoting shows, he says, "but you have to speak to the
audience very directly at the local level, too."</p>

<p>Saatchi Stays Put</p>
<p>Saatchi & Saatchi Co. broke off talks with Canadian
developer Olympia & York about moving its flagship London
agency to Canary Wharf, a huge office development on the
Thames.</p>
<p>Some analysts believed the cash-strapped communications
giant might reap savings of up to #10 million ($19.1 million)
by relocating the Charlotte Street agency. Olympia & York,
owned by Toronto's Reichmann family, has had trouble
attracting tenants to Canary Wharf.</p>
<p>Saatchi decided on Friday that any potential savings
wouldn't be enough to offset initial costs and opposition
from staff and clients to an inconvenient move, analysts
reported. A Saatchi spokesman said the company had decided
against a Canary Wharf move until further notice.</p>
<p>Analysts predicted Saatchi instead might raise nearly $500
million by selling Backer Spielvogel Bates Worldwide, one of
its two international ad groups. Chief Executive Robert
Louis-Dreyfus insists the network isn't for sale -- despite
unsolicited approaches recently from two large French
agencies, Eurocom S.A. and Roux, Seguela, Cayzac & Goudard.
Ad industry executives say that, privately, Mr. Louis-Dreyfus
is shopping for a buyer and the Eurocom discussions may turn
serious.</p>
<p>The Saatchi spokesman also declined to comment on British
press reports that the company is mulling a debt-for-equity
swap to cancel a European convertible preference issue. The
issue could cost Saatchi as much as #211 million when it
comes due in 1993.</p>

<p>Ad Notes. . . .</p>
<p>WATCH ACCOUNT: Tag-Heuer SA, a Swiss watch manufacturer,
awarded its $5 million U.S. ad account to Wells, Rich,
Greene, New York. The account had been handled by Ammirati &
Puris, also of New York. The move consolidates Tag-Heuer's
world-wide advertising: French agency BDDP, which owns a 40%
stake in Wells Rich, continues as the world-wide agency of
record for the watch manufacturer.</p>
<p>JOINT VENTURE: Ketchum International, a unit of Ketchum
Communications, Pittsburgh, formed a joint venture with
Adplus, a Korean advertising agency. Terms weren't disclosed.
The new company, called Adplus Ketchum, will be headed by
Frank Lee, executive vice president of Adplus.</p>
<p>BELATED SAATCHI EXIT: Two top Saatchi & Saatchi executives
dismissed last spring finally completed a settlement with the
company on Friday. The deal, originally expected in late
July, gives Roy Warman and Terry Bannister freedom to operate
their own agency while they remain long-term Saatchi
consultants. But the settlement omits any big cash payments,
knowledgeable observers say.</p>
<p>WHO'S NEWS: Lowe & Partners, New York, named Joan Overlock
executive vice president, account management. She was a
senior vice president at Wells, Rich, Greene.</p>
