	<p class="article-leader">Years of overspending on public programs and inflated
union contracts are looming as the formula for fiscal
disaster among more American cities. Philadelphia, the
nation's fifth-largest city, appears to have reached the edge
first.
   Philadelphia has run a deficit for the past three years,
each time borrowing enough to meet its cash-flow needs. This
year, with a deficit of $210 million in a $2.1 billion
budget, the lenders refused to buy the city's notes. On
Monday Standard & Poor's downgraded the city's credit to
triple-C, which means the city is in danger of default on its
general obligation bonds.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Like many other cities, Philadelphia chose in recent years
to lavish money on a host of programs. By trying to do too
much, it ended up doing nothing very well. The evidence can
be found in the city's escalating crime rate and crumbling
infrastructure.</p>
<p>Mayor Wilson Goode has called for $150 million in
"emergency" tax increases. He previously asked for a new 0.5%
sales tax along with an increase in the city's 5% wage tax.
City taxes on financial and insurance firms are already
two-thirds higher than in the surrounding suburbs.</p>
<p>Mayor Goode concedes that new taxes will hurt job growth
in the city, but insists there is no alternative. That "no
alternative" thinking is precisely the problem. Where is it
written in stone, for instance, that a city must retain all
of its past functions in perpetuity? Unburdening the city of
some of its long-held properties would not only raise cash
but reduce the city's budget obligations. The Philadelphia
Water Department is estimated to be worth $100 million. The
city spends $80 million a year maintaining the Philadelphia
Airport. Cities from Albany, N.Y., to Los Angeles are
discussing the sale of their airports.</p>
<p>But rather than debate fundamental reform of what
constitutes city government, Philadelphia's leaders are
trying to get the federal government to blackmail
Pennsylvania into paying for the city's mass-transit system.
Rep. Bill Gray, chairman of the House Budget Committee, has
inserted a provision into the pending House transportation
bill that would cut off 25% of the state's federal highway
funds unless it establishes dedicated taxes to support
Philadelphia's transit system.</p>
<p>Mr. Gray's ploy would create a dangerous precedent for the
pre-emption of state tax policy by Congress. Pressure groups
that failed to win tax increases at the local or state level
would seek local tax mandates from Congress using the threat
of withholding federal funds.</p>
<p>The city's establishment is aware of what Mr. Gray's
squeeze play represents. The Philadelphia Inquirer
editorialized in favor of his tactics: "Blackmail may be a
nasty business, but sometimes somebody has to do it." We hope
this doesn't mean that blackmail is liberalism's ultimate
urban policy.</p>
<p>The Philadelphia story is hardly unique. What's most
troubling is that at all levels of government, the political
system the past 20 years has seemed driven to keep piling on
spending commitments. They believed that somebody or
something could always be squeezed for the money -- the
federal budget, the state, "the rich," a round of union
givebacks, new business taxes, penny-ante taxes, raiding
pension funds. In fairness to the politicians, most
intellectual and media elites have praised and supported all
these public commitments.</p>
<p>But the game is about over. The challenge now, in
Philadelphia and other cities, is to start finding people and
policies which aren't tied to a status quo that has proved
itself financially and intellectually bankrupt.</p>
