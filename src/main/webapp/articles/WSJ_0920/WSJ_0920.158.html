	<p class="article-leader">When it comes to deciding whether to fly in these
financially worrisome times, the rich are still different
from you and me.
   Even though leisure travel is in the doldrums, and
businesses claim they're cutting back on travel perks,
first-class travel is doing astonishingly well; in fact,
domestic traffic among paying first-class customers is up 13%
through July. If that pace continues through the year, it
will be the biggest jump in a decade.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The increase mystifies airline executives, although they
say some recent improvements in service and marketing may be
an explanation. But travel experts say the boost may say more
about service problems in the back of the plane than the
changes in front.</p>
<p>"As coach gets so crammed, some people will do almost
anything to try to justify to themselves or their company why
they need to fly in first class," says Stephen Taylor,
executive vice president of Lifeco Travel Services, a major
agency in Houston.</p>
<p>U.S. carriers won't release individual numbers, but the
Air Transport Association says that while first-class travel
surged, overall domestic traffic was up only 4% through July.
Since the trade group tracks only paying customers, the
first-class increase isn't coming from frequent-flier members
using free awards and upgrades. And it's not being spurred by
any discounting in first class; indeed, first-class fares are
up 7% this year, and first class revenues have climbed 22%.</p>
<p>The upswing is a big surprise for many in the travel
industry, who assumed that with corporate belts tightening
and travel costs soaring, most companies wouldn't pay $3,000
to fly an employee one-way from New York to London. "You hear
so much about companies cutting back," says a spokesman for
Carlson Travel Network, a major travel agency. "This clearly
goes against the trend." And in general, the travel industry
has been mired in a slump for most of the year.</p>
<p>But experts say that a weak economy doesn't affect the
vacation plans of truly wealthy travelers the way it does
others. "For the people on Park Avenue, this is just the way
they go," says Bill Fischer of Fischer Travel in New York,
which specializes in travel for the rich and famous. "A
recession isn't going to stop them."</p>
<p>Furthermore, despite promises otherwise, many companies
still let their very senior executives fly up-front. They do
so by establishing two-tier travel policies -- one for the
top executives, one for everyone else. Generally, the
executives who fly first class tend to be discreet about
their travel arrangements to ease resentment.</p>
<p>"There are definitely more companies trying two-tier
policies," says Jeanie Thompson-Smith, president of Topaz
Enterprises, a travel-management company. "Your top
executives still generally feel they deserve to go first
class."</p>
<p>Airlines also insist they have been able to nudge people
into first class by heavily promoting it and improving
service. Pan American World Airways offers free limousine and
helicopter service for international first-class passengers.
Delta has put in electronically reclining seats. And American
now bakes chocolate-chip cookies on board.</p>
<p>Whatever the reason for the increase, it's definitely a
boon for the industry. Paying first-class customers don't
form a huge market. United Airlines estimates that only 20%
of the people sitting in its first-class cabins actually pay
full-fare. (The rest are frequent-flier members using
freebies or upgrades.) Industrywide, only about 7% of all
passengers buy first-class tickets. But the profit margins on
first-class fares are often 10 times greater than they are in
economy class, airline officials say.</p>
<p>"These are definitely very important customers for us,"
says Hector Adler, vice president of in-flight and dining
services for Pan Am.</p>
<p>Those profits are likely to stay strong even through the
fall season. Leisure travel drops off then, but business
travel usually stays strong, and most first-class travelers
are business fliers.</p>
<p>But although it may boost profits, the first-class surge
has caught some carriers off guard. Because they thought
first-class travel was shrinking, some airlines have
gradually reduced their proportion of first-class seats. As a
result, first-class cabins are starting to sell out on some
transcontinental and international flights weeks ahead, and
that forces airlines to turn away some paying first-class
customers.</p>
<p>"The airlines thought first class was a dead market," says
Mr. Fischer. "Obviously, it's not."</p>
