	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Pessimism about the outlook for interest
rates, the economy and corporate earnings took its toll on
the stock market, as prices fell in moderate trading.
   The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 13.86 to 2557.43,
as selling produced sharp setbacks in Merck, General Electric
and Primerica.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Among broader indexes, Standard & Poor's 500-Stock Index
dropped 2.00 to 316.60, the New York Stock Exchange Composite
Index dropped 0.97 to 173.91 and the Dow Jones Equity Market
Index fell 1.78 to 293.30.</p>
<p>Declining issues topped advancers by 883 to 599 on the Big
Board, where the pace of trading improved modestly. About
147,530,000 shares changed hands in New York Stock Exchange
trading, compared with 141,130,000 shares Tuesday.</p>
<p>Trading is expected to swell tomorrow as the result of
activity stemming from the quarterly expiration of
stock-index futures and options -- also known as the "triple
witching hour."</p>
<p>Stocks held firm as the latest session began, but fell
after Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan's
testimony before a congressional panel damped speculation
that the central bank would soon ease its monetary policy in
order to revive the economy.</p>
<p>"People were looking to get some inspiration" from Mr.
Greenspan, said John A. Conlon Jr., a managing director at
Rothschild Inc. But the Fed chairman said any shifts in
central-bank policy would depend on factors "which are
shifting day by day."</p>
<p>Also, Mr. Greenspan noted that inflation hasn't eased
despite sluggishness in the economy and that weakness in the
dollar could produce further inflationary pressures.</p>
<p>Merck fell 3 1/8 to 76 7/8 in composite trading of 2.9
million shares after Vector Securities, a Deerfield, Ill.,
investment concern specializing in health-care stocks,
downgraded the issue and lowered its long-term projection for
profit growth at the company to 15% from 18%.</p>
<p>Analyst Patricia Padgett Lea said that conversations with
doctors involved in the clinical trials of Proscar, Merck's
prostate drug, had led her to conclude it will be only a
"marginal drug," rather than the blockbuster many had
expected.</p>
<p>Merck, which said it expects the results from the trials
to be released early next year, wouldn't comment on its
financial expectations for the drug. But Ms. Lea said annual
sales could eventually reach $200 million, rather than the $1
billion or more projected.</p>
<p>MBIA fell 3 3/8 to 28 1/2 on 1.2 million shares,
reflecting concerns about the possible impact of the city of
Philadelphia's financial troubles on the municipal
bond-insurance firm. The company, whose shares skidded 3 1/2
Tuesday, said it has about $9 million of exposure to the city
next year. MBIA also disclosed that it is reinstituting a
program to repurchase up to one million common shares.</p>
<p>GE, the parent company of municipal bond insurer FGIC
Corp., went down 2 1/2 to 56 1/8 and led the list of most
active issues as three million shares changed hands.
Primerica dropped 1 7/8 to 21 1/4 on 1.4 million shares;
Federal National Mortgage Association, another
financial-services issue, dipped 1 to 26 1/2 on 2.5 million
shares.</p>
<p>American General plummeted 6 3/8 to 33 5/8 on two million
shares after the company's board cleared management to
consider a restructuring plan -- involving the sale of its
home-service insurance operations -- as an alternative to
selling the company.</p>
<p>Stocks depressed by lowered earnings expectations included
Claire's Stores, which skidded 3 3/8 to 12 in active trading;
Lowe's, which dropped 1 1/2 to 21 1/2; Armstrong World
Industries, which went down 2 to 27; and Pitney Bowes, which
fell 4 1/8 to 30 1/8.</p>
<p>Claire's fell after Alex. Brown & Sons lowered the
company's earnings estimate for the current fiscal year to a
range of $1.20 to $1.25 a share, from $1.30 a share, citing a
slowdown over the past few weeks in sales growth at stores
open at least a year. The firm also downgraded the stock to
"buy" from "strong buy."</p>
<p>Prudential-Bache Securities lowered its fiscal 1991 and
1992 earnings projections on Lowe's, citing a softening
economy and other concerns, and cut its investment rating to
"sell" from "hold."</p>
<p>Kidder Peabody reduced its 1991 forecast on Armstrong
World by 90 cents a share, to $3, and downgraded the issue to
"underperformer" from "hold." Analyst Barbara K. Allen said
the company faces "a period of turmoil" in the flooring
industry, stemming from new products introduced earlier this
week by a competitor, Mannington Mills.</p>
<p>Pitney Bowes, in disclosing plans to stop remanufacturing
used copier equipment, said it expects this year's net income
to fall short of the year-earlier level. The company said its
decision to scrap its remanufacturing business would result
in a third-quarter pretax charge of about $86 million.</p>
<p>Occidental Petroleum retreated 1 3/8 to 21 3/8 on 2.6
million shares and traded as low as 20 1/4, a 52-week low,
amid rumors that the company would lower its dividend.
Occidental denied the speculation.</p>
<p>Waste Management, whose board approved the repurchase of
up to 25 million shares over the next 24 months, advanced 1/2
to 34 5/8 on 1.4 million shares. The total represents about
5% of its shares outstanding.</p>
<p>Other active issues to advance amid the broad market's
retreat included International Business Machines, which added
1 1/8 to 108 3/8 on 2.2 million shares; Philip Morris, which
went up 7/8 to 46 on three million shares; and Eastman Kodak,
which rose 1/2 to 42 1/8 on 1.6 million shares.</p>
<p>Quaker Oats jumped 2 3/8 to 45 5/8 amid speculation that
the company would receive a takeover offer from Coca-Cola,
which dropped 1 1/2 to 39 3/4. A Coca-Cola spokesman
dismissed the rumor, calling it "totally ridiculous."</p>
<p>Corroon & Black skidded 3 1/2 to 32. Aon reiterated that
it won't pursue a hostile offer for the company, which
rejected its $40-a-share offer in favor of proceeding with a
stock-swap merger with Willis Faber, a British insurance
broker.</p>
<p>The American Stock Exchange Market Value Index fell 0.72
to 318.97. Volume totaled 10,270,000 shares.</p>
