	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc., Stein Roe &
Farnham Inc. and two other firms agreed to pay nearly $3
million to settle federal charges of misusing assets of three
Teamsters Union funds.
   The Labor Department's Pension and Welfare Benefits
Administration said that under consent orders in federal
court in Syracuse, N.Y., Shearson, the brokerage unit of
American Express Co., agreed to pay $2 million to three
Teamsters pension and health funds in Utica, N.Y., as
restitution for alleged improper transactions made on behalf
of those funds. Stein Roe, a Chicago investment manager,
agreed to pay $625,000, and Renaissance Investment Management
Inc., Cincinnati, and First Albany Inc., Albany, N.Y., a
brokerage firm, agreed to pay a combined $180,000, the agency
said.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The agency charged Shearson and Stein Roe with violations
including transferring stocks with falling prices to the
Teamsters fund accounts while switching valuable stock to
friends, relatives and customers of Shearson brokers.
Renaissance and other investment firms were charged with
letting the funds' cash balances under their management be
treated as Shearson credit balances and with allowing payment
of excessive commissions to Shearson and First Albany.</p>
<p>A spokesman for Shearson said the employees handling the
accounts were fired in 1985 after the firm's own internal
investigation. He said the firm cooperated fully with
investigators "and agreed to settle without admitting or
denying the allegations to avoid protracted litigation."</p>
<p>Stein Roe officials couldn't be reached for comment.</p>
