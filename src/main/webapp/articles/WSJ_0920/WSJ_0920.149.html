	<p class="article-leader">BRUSSELS -- The European Community's top agricultural
official was forced to withdraw a crucial proposal on
farm-subsidy cuts when a majority of fellow EC commissioners
demanded more substantial rollbacks.
   Aides to Agriculture Commissioner Ray MacSharry said a
majority of EC commissioners wanted to signal the U.S. that
the Community was serious about a successful outcome to the
current round of world trade talks taking place under the
General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. GATT negotiators gave
all countries until Oct. 15 to put their final offers on the
table. Because of the bitter dispute on farm subsidies
between the EC and the U.S., many experts are worried that
the talks could fail.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Mr. MacSharry had proposed cutting overall farm support by
only 30% over 10 years, using 1986 spending as a basis. U.S.
Trade Representative Carla Hills, in Brussels yesterday, said
that would effectively be a much smaller reduction, perhaps
as little as a 10% off today's levels, as 1986 was a high
benchmark. The U.S. this week softened its stand, saying it
would accept a 70% cut in subsidies and deeper cuts in export
refunds.</p>
