	<p class="article-leader">SAN FRANCISCO -- "What a race this is]" an ebullient
Dianne Feinstein tells Asian-American supporters in
Chinatown.
   Actually, the Democratic candidate for governor
understates its significance. Joe Scott, a California
political commentator, may be closer to the truth. "It's the
Battle of the Marne," he says, "and the stakes are enormous."</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The prize to be won goes beyond the opportunity to govern
this sprawling nation-state of 30 million people, which added
six million residents in the 1980s alone. With
reapportionment after this year's census, California will get
more representation in the U.S. House of Representatives and
will account for one of every eight members. If Ms. Feinstein
wins, she and the Democratic-controlled legislature stand to
make California a Democratic juggernaut for the rest of this
decade.</p>
<p>They would have free rein to draw the lines for state and
federal legislative districts. They might even manage to
carry California for the Democrat in a presidential election,
which is a feat the party has accomplished just once since
1948 (with Lyndon Johnson in 1964).</p>
<p>And as the first woman to be governor of California, the
57-year-old Ms. Feinstein, the former mayor of San Francisco,
would automatically become a national figure, perhaps an
international figure.</p>
<p>She has star quality. She pulled San Francisco together at
a tragic moment following the murders in November 1978 of
Mayor George Moscone and Supervisor Harvey Milk, the city's
first avowedly gay elected official. (She inherited the
mayor's job.) Her prominence as a female Democratic
officeholder caused Walter Mondale to seriously consider her
as his vice presidential running mate in 1984. In June, she
went through the primary election on a roll, defeating John
Van de Kamp, the state's attorney general. She cuts a
handsome figure on the campaign trail -- tall and elegant in
her trademark red.</p>
<p>Republican hopes to avoid Democratic hegemony in the state
rest on the slight shoulders of U.S. Sen. Pete Wilson. The
baby-faced ex-Marine and popular former mayor of San Diego,
who was elected to the Senate in 1982, is going up against
Ms. Feinstein in the November election. At the moment, he
seems to enjoy a narrow lead, at least in recent private
polls. Public polls have the race too close to call.</p>
<p>Mr. Wilson's most effective weapon, one Ms. Feinstein has
been known to deploy herself: the power of negative
campaigning.</p>
<p>Where there are issues of any substantial sort, there
isn't much difference in the candidates' positions. Ms.
Feinstein and Mr. Wilson both are scrupulously cautious,
middle-of-the-road politicians. Both support abortion rights,
the death penalty, spending money to fight crime.</p>
<p>So if the race isn't to be decided on issues, it will
hinge on mudslinging and, of course, personality.</p>
<p>"Personality matters," says Adriane Urband, a hotel clerk
in Monterey. "They don't have to be the most appealing person
in the world, but they mustn't turn me off," she says.</p>
<p>The outcome of this race looks to be in the hands of the
image-makers, consultants and fund-raisers. Television ads,
more than anything else, should determine the outcome.</p>
<p>In a campaign like this, the spoils go to whoever can make
the opponent look worse, particularly this time in matters
pertaining to the national savings and loan scandal. Pete
Wilson is proving to be very good at this sort of thing, and
his organization knows how to win votes in California.</p>
<p>"Pete Wilson wants a down-and-dirty campaign, and he's
getting it," says Democratic pollster Paul Maslin. "If this
race stays punch-counterpunch, both sides slinging negative
ads, it's Pete's game, and he wins." Adds Richard Maullin, a
demographics and marketing expert: "Pete Wilson knows more
about how the process works in California."</p>
<p>The voters are understandably frustrated. "All we're
hearing is this sleaze stuff," says Elizabeth Kemper, a Los
Angeles lawyer. "My reaction is: Oh, come on."</p>
<p>Harold Lape, a Macy's shoe salesman in San Francisco, says
he laughs at the ads. "Each of them is trying to do a
negative number on the other. If they're doing those ads for
me, they're missing the target."</p>
<p>Voters want issues, at least they say they do. But in a
campaign essentially devoid of any such thing, the ads do
have their effect. And the effect so far is mostly against
Ms. Feinstein, who, among her other disadvantages, has less
money with which to buy time.</p>
<p>She shares a point of vulnerability that has troubled
other successful women in politics -- a wealthy husband with
business interests that invite investigation. Geraldine
Ferraro, chosen ultimately as Mr. Mondale's running mate in
1984 (over Ms. Feinstein) spent weeks trying to explain the
real-estate dealings of her husband, John Zaccaro. In
Britain, Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher from time to time
has been criticized for the interests and investments of her
husband, Dennis.</p>
<p>Ms. Feinstein's husband is investment banker Richard C.
Blum, who reported personal income last year of more than $7
million. His firm, Richard C. Blum & Associates, invests
hundreds of millions of dollars for nearly a dozen corporate
clients, including BankAmerica Corp. and Fireman's Fund
Corp., not to mention some wealthy individuals he won't
identify.</p>
<p>He and Ms. Feinstein (she has kept the name of her second
husband) have lent her campaign about $3 million.</p>
<p>Ms. Feinstein's detractors charge that Mr. Blum is trying
to buy the election for his wife, and the state Republican
Party has filed a suit saying his loans to the campaign are
illegal. "They're flouting the law," says Sen. Wilson,
striding up and down his suite at an airport hotel here,
sipping from a bottle of mouthwash. The case probably won't
be heard until after election day.</p>
<p>Ms. Feinstein and her husband have been reluctant to pump
more of their own cash into the campaign. And as a result,
they are being outspent, with Mr. Wilson picking up millions
more in fund-raising events, including one on Sept. 17 that
featured President Bush.</p>
<p>In a way, Ms. Feinstein's people brought the problems down
upon themselves, and, accordingly, on her. They knew from the
start that Mr. Wilson would make Mr. Blum an issue, so they
decided on a pre-emptive surgical strike. In a TV ad, they
charged that Sen. Wilson had received $243,000 in campaign
contributions from savings and loan association executives,
more than anyone else in the Senate, plus $9,000 in S&L
honorariums.</p>
<p>But though the charge was accurate, the attack
boomeranged. As it turned out, Mr. Blum himself has been
heavily involved with S&Ls. Mr. Wilson and his campaign staff
seized the opportunity to put twice the money Ms. Feinstein
had spent into a TV spot of their own. It pointed out that
Mr. Blum had profited hugely from the bailout of Jackson
County Savings & Loan, in Medford, Ore., in 1988. His payment
for putting the deal together came to $325,000.</p>
<p>"What they did," says George Gorton, Mr. Wilson's campaign
manager, speaking of the Feinstein campaign, "is called
hypocrisy."</p>
<p>"She got hurt" in the volley of charges, says Sen. Wilson.
"I didn't."</p>
<p>A counterpart to the TV ads has been a rash of
investigative stories in newspapers around the state
analyzing Mr. Blum's financial dealings. The latest,
appearing Sept. 14 in the Los Angeles Times, noted that Mr.
Blum sold $2.7 million in stock -- 15% of his holding -- in
National Education Corp., of Irvine, Calif., in the two days
preceding the announcement of a management shake-up, which
caused the share price to plummet. Mr. Blum says he didn't
know about the imminent happenings when he sold his shares.</p>
<p>The normally cool Ms. Feinstein has been forced to defend
her husband's ethics. "He's the most honest person I know,"
she says. "I recognize what's happening here, and what's
happening here is {they are} using him to get at me."</p>
<p>The result of what has been happening is clear enough.
"They {the voters} liked Dianne at first," says pollster Mr.
Maslin, "but now some of the bloom is off the rose."</p>
<p>That is certainly true for at least one California voter,
Ted Stemp, a retired aerospace manufacturing engineer in
Murrieta. "She seemed pretty appealing at one time," he says
of Ms. Feinstein, "but now politics is too much in her
blood."</p>
<p>The race is still eminently winnable by Ms. Feinstein, of
course. The two candidates are too close in current polls to
say that either is leading. The professionals are counseling
her to move on to higher ground. "She needs to paint Pete
Wilson as a politician of the past," says Democratic pollster
Alex Evans. "She needs to remember this is the most exciting,
most media-driven state in the nation, where being different
is a way of life. She needs to talk about the future of
California."</p>
<p>"The theme is still there for her," says Mr. Maslin. "The
voters know something has gone wrong in California. They talk
about the pride they used to have in the public schools. All
gone now. They talk about highway congestion, pollution,
crime and drugs. They see the {Democratic-controlled}
legislature run through cronyism and controlled by special
interests. Dianne Feinstein ought to take the lead on all
this."</p>
<p>Bill Carrick, Ms. Feinstein's campaign manager, isn't so
sure about that. Yes, Californians worry about crime,
education, the environment. "But there isn't an army ready to
march for an agenda of change," he says. "They want to do all
these things without raising taxes."</p>
<p>Moreover, an emotional campaign could just as easily play
into Mr. Wilson's hands. Even though California's population
is becoming less white, largely because of Asian and Latin
immigration, whites still are the overrwhelming majority of
those who vote. The state's white voters are largely
suburban, and growing old. "This predominantly white
population worries about the exploding minority population,"
Mr. Maullin, the demographer, said.</p>
<p>These are Pete Wilson's voters -- regular Republicans and
tepid Democrats, white people who live in Southern
California, especially in the pulsing suburbs surrounding Los
Angeles that now stretch eastward all the way to Riverside
and San Bernardino.</p>
<p>Ms. Feinstein is painfully aware of her standing in the
burbs. At a breakfast fund-raiser in the heavily Hispanic
Echo Park neighborhood of Los Angeles, she claimed to have
80% of the black vote and nearly 70% of Hispanics. "White
men," she said, "are a problem."</p>
<p>If Ms. Feinstein can find a way to take the initiative and
raise the needed cash for TV ads, she does have some
important cards to play. She favors a sweeping environmental
ballot proposal (called Big Green) that would, among other
things, ban carcinogenic pesticides; Mr. Wilson opposes it.
Her running mate, incumbent Lt. Gov. Leo McCarthy, is the
sponsor of a ballot proposal that would increase the state
sales tax by half a percentage point, so as to fight a war
against crime and drugs, which are big concerns among
California voters.</p>
<p>That is a specifically targeted spending proposal that
seems to be popular with voters. The cautious Mr. Wilson, who
has made crime-fighting the centerpiece of his campaign
rhetoric, has no plan of his own to pay for it. He
unenthusiastically suggests that he might actually vote for
the initiative himself.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, he calls his next round of TV attacks a "tale
of two cities" -- his record as mayor of San Diego from 1971
to 1982 against her record as mayor of San Francisco from
1978 to 1988. "I cut taxes when I was mayor," says Mr.
Wilson. "When she was mayor of San Francisco, she raised
taxes."</p>
