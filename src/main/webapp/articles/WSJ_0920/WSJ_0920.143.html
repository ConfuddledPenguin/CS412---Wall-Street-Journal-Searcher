	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- The federal government's case against Neil
Bush, the president's son, involving his role as a director
of failed Silverado Banking, Savings & Loan Association,
isn't likely to wind up until next spring, a spokesman for
S&L regulators said.
   Next week, Mr. Bush, will defend his actions before an
administrative law judge in Denver. The Office of Thrift
Supervision is seeking a cease-and-desist order to prohibit
Mr. Bush from engaging in certain activities if he holds a
similar post at a financial institution in the future. Mr.
Bush served on the board of the Denver thrift from 1985 to
1988.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Mr. Bush, who as an outside board member had no day-to-day
role at the thrift, has denied wrongdoing and has fought the
order. Thrift regulators said he failed to disclose to other
Silverado board members his separate business relationship
with two large Silverado borrowers. Several Silverado
executives have been barred from the S&L and banking
industries under government consent agreements.</p>
<p>The administrative law judge is to make his recommendation
for action by Dec. 6, and following another month for written
rebuttals, OTS Director Timothy Ryan will have 90 days to
either agree or disagree with the recommendation. Mr. Ryan's
ruling may be appealed in court.</p>
