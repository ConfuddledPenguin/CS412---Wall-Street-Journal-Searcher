	<p class="article-leader">TORONTO -- In a surprise ending to a bitter proxy battle,
a dissident shareholder group won the right to oust Sherritt
Gordon Ltd.'s board and top managers.
   The battle was launched by the Toronto financiers Ian
Delaney, Bruce Walter and Eric Sprott, who accused Sherritt's
managers of running the nickel refining and fertilizer
company unimaginatively and without direction. They
maintained that the management group, by holding less than 1%
of Sherritt's shares, couldn't be committed to making the
widely held company a success.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Though the dissidents hold only 5.4% of Sherritt, they
managed to round enough support from institutional holders to
win the proxy battle by a small margin, with 53% of the votes
cast. The group replaced Sherritt's board with its own
nominees.</p>
<p>Mr. Delaney said he will assume the posts of president and
chief executive officer. He said that a board meeting will be
held shortly to elect a president, and that the post is
likely to go to Mr. Walter.</p>
<p>Sherritt's former president and chief executive, Charles
Heinrich, asked shareholders to vote against the dissidents,
on grounds that they don't have any background in Sherritt's
key industries. They "haven't offered even one specific
workable element of a plan that differs in any real way from
the plan being implemented" by the company, he said.</p>
<p>In their information circular, the dissidents said they
would seek joint-venture partners, acquisitions and marketing
changes, but didn't offer specifics. Mr. Delaney declined to
comment on changes the new directors will make, but he said
there won't be any drastic changes in operations immediately.
He said the "near-term problem is to get the company on a
stable" footing. "Sherritt runs efficently," he said. "The
problem with Sherritt has always been the strategic
direction."</p>
<p>Sherritt has been hit hard by downturns in its cyclical
businesses. It lost a key supply of nickel feed last year and
has been struggling to keep its refinery operating at full
capacity.</p>
<p>In this year's first six months, Sherritt's net income
plunged 88% to C$4.1 million (US$3.5 million), or 16 Canadian
cents (14 U.S. cents) a share, from a year earlier.</p>
<p>In the past 52 weeks, Sherritt's stock price has fallen
from a high of C$13.50 to a low of C$7. On the Toronto Stock
Exchange yesterday, the stock closed at C$8.25, up 25
Canadian cents.</p>
<p>Mr. Delaney said that Sherritt will proceed with its plan
to move its head office to Edmonton, Alberta, to be closer to
its operations, but that he will run the company from
Toronto.</p>
<p>Mr. Heinrich said he doesn't know what he will do now,
though Mr. Delaney said a Sherritt executive position will be
available to him.</p>
