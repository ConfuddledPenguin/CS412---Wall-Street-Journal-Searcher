	<p class="article-leader">Mitsubishi Electric Corp. plans to nearly double its
investment in semiconductor capacity in the current fiscal
year to increase production of popular four-megabit dynamic
random access memory chips.
   A Mitsubishi spokesman said the Tokyo concern will spend
about 69 billion yen ($500.4 million) to increase production,
a rise of 47% from the 47 billion yen budgeted at the
beginning of the year, which began April 1. Almost all of the
increase will be spent to expand capacity for four-megabit
DRAMs, the spokesman said.</p>
