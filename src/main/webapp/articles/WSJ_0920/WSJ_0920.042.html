	<p class="article-leader">Congressional critics are howling because of the
generosity of regulators in some of the 1988 thrift bailouts.
But it has now become obvious that in many deals regulators
weren't generous enough -- and taxpayers will fork over
billions of additional dollars because of it.
   Federal regulators closed, merged or otherwise "resolved"
223 dead thrifts in 1988, many in last-gasp deals thrown
together in the final days of the year. However, largely
because of regulators' own miscalculations and blunders, they
didn't give sufficient money in many cases. So far, three of
the 1988 deals have collapsed because of the failure of the
acquiring thrifts -- Southwest Savings & Loan of Dallas,
Merabank Federal Savings Bank, Phoenix, and Statesman Bank
for Savings, Des Moines, Iowa. Several others are tottering.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>These twice-failed thrifts make for one of the more
egregious aspects of the thrift debacle. While it appears
that wily financiers may have fleeced the government in a
handful of deals, much more costly to taxpayers is the fact
that many of the regulators' "resolutions" actually resolved
nothing and will have to be bailed out anew, adding needless
billions to the ultimate taxpayer tab.</p>
<p>Consider Pelican Homestead & Savings Association, of
Metairie, La. When it acquired four dead thrifts in late
1987, it was touted by Danny Wall, then chairman of the
Federal Home Loan Bank Board, as the model for the 1988 deals
that would follow, in which "strong" institutions would take
over basket cases. The Bank Board projected that Pelican
would become profitable in a few years.</p>
<p>Pelican was indeed a model -- for disaster. It was
insolvent by at least $86 million before the deal, had losses
of $39.4 million in 1988 and $64.3 million in 1989, and
continues to hemorrhage.</p>
<p>Robert Shofstahl, Pelican's president, says it didn't get
some of the federal guarantees later acquirers received, such
as an assured profit margin on bad assets of acquired
thrifts. Mr. Shofstahl says the institutions that Pelican
acquired were in far worse shape than he or regulators
expected. Pelican is seeking a new rescue package under a
program offering aid to well-run institutions in economically
depressed regions. A new Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.
audit now pegs Pelican's cost to taxpayers at a minimum of
$589 million over the next decade.</p>
<p>The Bank Board ignored warnings from its own regulators
that some of the deals were fatally flawed. For example,
according to past and present regulators, James Cirona,
president of the Federal Home Loan Bank in San Francisco, and
his staff repeatedly urged Mr. Wall not to proceed with a
plan to permit gravely ill Merabank Federal Savings Bank to
acquire several insolvent Texas thrifts. Mr. Wall may have
been influenced by an agreement with Merabank's parent,
Pinnacle West Capital Corp., under which the parent was
supposed to "make good" Merabank's losses.</p>
<p>The deal was completed, and Merabank soon collapsed from
massive losses in Arizona real estate. Pinnacle West, in
effect, reneged on the make-good agreement but later agreed
to a settlement that only pared the government's huge loss,
now estimated at $1.5 billion by the FDIC.</p>
<p>Similarly, the Bank Board folded four broke thrifts into
Southwest Savings & Loan, which was owned by a trust for
Caroline Rose Hunt, of Dallas's once-rich Hunt family. The
board provided $2 billion of notes and other assistance but
required no new real capital, even though Southwest Savings
itself was going broke. Instead, in a move that baffled even
some regulators at the time, the board allowed Ms. Hunt to
convert $25 million of Southwest Savings' debt into stock and
count that as equity. But the debt was worthless to begin
with because of Southwest Savings' own losses.</p>
<p>Mr. Wall now says he wanted the thrift to convert the debt
to equity because the debt was requiring payments that he
says were depleting Southwest Savings' capital. Though
Texas's real estate problems were obvious by then to many in
the land and lending businesses, Mr. Wall maintains that
regulators didn't know how imperiled Southwest Savings really
was at the time. "In hindsight, we shouldn't have done that
conversion," he concedes.</p>
<p>Despite $541.6 million of government assistance through
1989, Southwest Savings' net losses have roared on, to the
tune of $238.5 million in 1988 and 1989. It has died twice:
Regulators closed it in June and are looking for a buyer.
Future projected costs of Southwest Savings: $5.6 billion.</p>
<p>Perhaps the most mysterious of the 1988 deals is Sunbelt
Savings Association of Dallas, which had failed spectacularly
amid allegations of fraud that led to the recent indictment,
in Dallas federal court, of its former chairman, Ed McBirney.
His trial is pending. In late 1988, regulators took the
remains of Sunbelt, lumped them with the detritus of four
other blownout Texas thrifts and pronounced the resulting
entity, rechristened Sunbelt Savings FSB, "stabilized." In
reality, that meant unsaleable, so regulators installed a new
management team to cleanse Sunbelt of the high-cost deposits
that were scaring off prospective suitors. Regulators refused
to disclose how much this process would cost, although the
amount was rumored to be $700 million.</p>
<p>To date, Sunbelt remains a spinster. And the FDIC audit
shows that its losses are vastly larger than originally
anticipated. The government spent $891.7 million on Sunbelt
through 1989 and estimates that it will spend $9.4 billion
more through 1998. Since that estimate, moreover, two other
collapsed Texas thrifts have been lobbed onto the Sunbelt
pile. Their losses suggest Sunbelt ultimately will cost some
$12 billion, a tad less than Peru's foreign debt.</p>
