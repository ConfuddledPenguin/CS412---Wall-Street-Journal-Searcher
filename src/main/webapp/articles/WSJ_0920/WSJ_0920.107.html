	<p class="article-leader">Inspiration Resources Corp., New York, said Western Gold
Exploration & Mining Co., a limited partnership of
Luxembourg-based Minorco S.A. and Inspiration, plans to close
its offshore gold mining operation in Alaska.
   As a result, Inspiration, a diversified agricultural and
mining concern, said it may take a charge, which hasn't been
determined, by the end of the year. Last year, the company
earned $25.2 million, or 38 cents a share, on revenue of
$1.42 billion.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Western Gold said it "reluctantly decided to end
operations, due to low gold prices and persistent losses from
the operation." Since the mining began off the coast of Nome,
Alaska, in 1986, the offshore vessel has recovered about
130,000 ounces of gold. Last year, the operation recovered
about 70,000 ounces.</p>
