	<p class="article-leader">Pan Am Corp. Chairman Thomas Plaskett said he's slashing
2,500 jobs from the company's payroll, axing some
trans-Atlantic service and shifting to smaller aircraft in an
effort to cope with higher fuel costs and sluggish passenger
demand.
   The action by the parent of Pan American Airways, one of
the country's major carriers, is the largest work force
reduction announced so far this year by any airline holding
company.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Industry analysts said the company's plan is a harbinger
of further troubles to come in an industry whose outlook has
been darkening in the days since Iraq invaded Kuwait.</p>
<p>The company said it plans to eliminate the 2,500 jobs, or
8.6% of its work force, during the fourth quarter through
voluntary leaves of absence, attrition and furloughs. Mr.
Plaskett said the furloughs will affect management officials
as well as rank-and-file employees.</p>
<p>Mr. Plaskett, speaking at a Wall Street airlines analyst
meeting, said that he plans to cut Pan Am's capacity by 7.5%
to 42.96 billion available seat miles in 1991 from 46.43
billion available seat miles in 1990.</p>
<p>The largest chunk of the service cuts will come from Pan
Am's trans-Atlantic service, where Mr. Plaskett said he plans
to reduce capacity by 15.4% next year compared with this
year.</p>
<p>For one thing, Mr. Plaskett said he will be dropping
Boeing Co.'s 412-seat 747 jet on several trans-Atlantic
routes and replacing it with Airbus Industrie's smaller
192-seat A310-300 aircraft.</p>
<p>Although Pan Am's already-low stock remained unchanged at
$1.875 a share in New York Stock Exchange trading, the
announcement came as good news to many Wall Street analysts,
long-familiar with Pan Am's difficulty turning a profit.</p>
<p>"They didn't get up there and dish out a bunch of
baloney," said Roseanne Tortora, an airlines analyst at
County NatWest Securities. "When push comes to shove, I don't
know if it will be enough, but they have a plan that appears
to be well thought out."</p>
<p>Already, other carriers have tried to take bites out of
their budgets. USAir Group Inc.'s Chairman Edwin Colodny last
month said he is laying off 6.7% of his carrier's work force
of 54,000 employees.</p>
<p>Other carriers are said to be discussing similar furlough
plans. Robert Crandall, chairman at AMR Corp.'s American
Airlines, is slashing operational costs in a campaign that
includes an edict to workers to turn off lights after
quitting time.</p>
<p>As part of Pan Am's trans-Atlantic switch in planes, Mr.
Plaskett said he plans to return five leased Boeing 747-400s
to General Electric Credit Corp., a General Electric Co.
unit, by April 1991.</p>
<p>Another large part of the service reduction is coming from
Pan Am's domestic service, where Mr. Plaskett said he plans
to cut capacity by 10.1% next year versus this year.</p>
<p>Among other things, Pan Am plans include closing its
offices in Austin, Texas, Cincinnati and San Antonio, Texas.
It is also cutting a number of domestic flights from its hub
of operations at New York's John F. Kennedy International
Airport.</p>
<p>All the while, Mr. Plaskett said that he plans to boost
the carrier's Latin American service out of Miami, which the
carrier has been building as a hub of operations. The
company's plans include increasing Pan Am service out of
Miami to 82 flights next year from 63 departures in 1989 and
the first half of 1990.</p>
<p>By 1995, Pan Am says it plans to increase the number of
flights to 231 daily departures, including its commuter
flights.</p>
<p>Pan Am's layoff program may raise tensions with the
Teamsters, which represents about 6,500 employees. It isn't
clear how many of its members will lose their jobs.</p>
<p>Yesterday, Teamster officials met in Washington, D.C., to
discuss whether to call a strike at Pan Am. Already, the
union, which is in the midst of contract negotiations, has
been conducting a work-slowdown campaign at Pan Am.</p>
<p>"The company is in trouble," said George Miranda, a top
official at the union's airline division.</p>
<p>Just days ago, in fact, Pan Am reached an agreement with
government regulators to defer $53 million in pension-plan
payments until November. That comes on top of $106.4 million
in bills that Pan Am deferred paying earlier this year to
three big creditors.</p>
<p>Pan Am is turning to a longstanding practice of trying to
remedy its cash problem by selling assets. Yesterday, Mr.
Plaskett said "several" parties are interested in buying the
airline holding company's Pan Am Shuttle unit, which he said
should be sold by year end. He cautioned, however, that a
purchase most likely wouldn't be completed until early 1991.</p>
<p>Although Mr. Plaskett wouldn't identify the parties
involved in the shuttle talks, industry sources have pointed
to America West Airlines as a possible buyer.</p>
<p>The company already has one sale under its belt this year.
It recently announced the sale of its inter-German service to
Lufthansa German Airlines for $150 million. It should get
cash from that sale during the fourth quarter.</p>
