	<p class="article-leader">A securities analyst said Merck & Co.'s highly touted drug
for shrinking prostates is producing only "marginal" results
in experimental trials, but company officials sharply
disputed the analyst's report.
   Despite the company's quick response, Merck's shares were
battered in New York Stock Exchange trading yesterday,
falling $3.125 to $76.875 on heavy volume.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Patricia Padgett Lea, who follows the pharmaceutical
industry for Vector Securities in Deerfield, Ill., said
Merck's experimental drug, Proscar, "had no meaningful
impact" in reducing symptoms of patients using the drug in
test studies. Ms. Lea said she conducted phone interviews
with about 10 doctors helping Merck study the drug.</p>
<p>"None of the doctors were particularly enthusiastic about
{the drug}," she said in an interview. Ms. Lea said symptoms
of an enlarged prostate, such as blocked urine flow, weren't
satisfactorily relieved by the drug, according to her
interviews.</p>
<p>Ms. Lea said she expects the drug to produce annual sales
of "only" about $200 million. Many analysts said Merck's
ability to increase profits by 18% to 20% into the 1990s
relies on Proscar's being a huge-seller, and some predict
Proscar's sales could top $1 billion a year. Merck hasn't
made a public forecast of potential sales, but its chairman
and chief executive officer, P. Roy Vagelos, has stated that
he expects Proscar to be very successful.</p>
<p>Elizabeth Stoner, Merck's senior director for clinical
research, said there was no evidence to support Ms. Lea's
findings. Dr. Stoner said Merck's study of 1,800 men was
completed several months ago and the data are being analyzed.
She said that as the data haven't been released to the 90
doctors participating in the study, the doctors wouldn't know
which patients were given the drug and which took a placebo.</p>
<p>Dr. Stoner said Merck plans to use data from the study to
seek government approval early next year to market the drug.
Merck claims that Proscar can shrink enlarged prostates, a
condition that affects many men over age 50, and avoid the
need for surgery.</p>
<p>The drug's effectiveness has become a source of much
speculation on Wall Street and within the medical community
because the only scientific evidence of the drug's
effectiveness is the just-finished study. Results from the
study will be released next year, the company said.</p>
