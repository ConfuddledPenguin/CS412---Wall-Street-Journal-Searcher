	<p class="article-leader">Facing fewer orders and declining profits, Vitalink
Communications Corp. said it laid off 10% of its work force,
or 32 employees, and cut back the number of its sales
offices.
   In the last six months, the Fremont, Calif., company has
weathered a series of setbacks: First, it had to reduce
prices on some hardware products by 15%, then its chief
executive officer resigned, and net income in the last
quarter plunged 50% from the previous year.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Vitalink's current chief executive, Donald J. Herman, said
that with the savings from firing employees, the company
would invest more heavily in developing new products.</p>
<p>Vitalink makes systems used to connect large computer
networks.</p>
