	<p class="article-leader">Corroon & Black Corp. shares dropped sharply after Aon
Corp. reiterated that it will abandon its $40-a-share bid if
Corroon's board continues to oppose it.
   Shares of the New York insurance broker tumbled $3.50 in
composite New York Stock Exchange trading yesterday, closing
at $32.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Tuesday, Corroon rejected Aon's $840 million bid, and said
it would proceed with its earlier plan to merge with Willis
Faber PLC of London. The announcement of the rejection of
Aon's bid was made after the close of trading Tuesday.</p>
<p>Investors received conflicting signals yesterday
concerning Aon's intentions: Prior to the company's threat to
walk away, people close to the Chicago concern said Aon
hadn't ruled out a hostile tender offer for Corroon. But an
Aon official said that a release by the company specifically
meant that "we will not go hostile" -- the market apparently
concluded that Aon is serious about not pursuing a bid in the
face of a rejection by Corroon.</p>
<p>Aon reiterated that it will withdraw its bid if Corroon's
board "denies us a hearing," or if the company, "after a
hearing, persists in its position that the Willis Faber
transaction . . . will serve the best interests of Corroon's
stockholders."</p>
<p>Aon had said previously it was "not interested in pursuing
any transaction which is opposed" by Corroon's board. But
after Corroon's rejection of the bid Tuesday, Aon immediately
said it wouldn't pull its proposal. The company said it was
"incredible that (Corroon) came to this conclusion without
even talking to us or to our investment bankers about our
proposal."</p>
<p>The earlier decision not to withdraw the proposal "was
part of our request to meet with the Corroon board -- if it
wasn't on the table, there wouldn't be anything to meet
about," said Patrick G. Ryan, Aon's chairman, chief executive
officer and president in a release.</p>
<p>Traders said Aon's statement yesterday that it would back
away from its bid significantly increased the chances that
Corroon will be able to proceed with its plan to merge with
Willis Faber. Under that deal, Corroon holders would receive
Willis stock currently worth $30.87 for each of their shares.</p>
<p>Some traders, though, held out a slim hope that some
Corroon directors might be willing to listen to Aon's
proposal.</p>
<p>The stern criticism Aon leveled at Corroon "is designed to
give Corroon holders more ammunition for a lawsuit against
the company for rejecting a higher bid," said Allan Nichols,
an insurance analyst with James Capel & Co. in London.</p>
<p>"I can't believe the board was united in turning a deaf
ear to Pat Ryan. The view of shareholders is that this is
truly outrageous conduct on the part of the Corroon board,"
said Michael Smith, an analyst with Lehman Brothers, a unit
of Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc.</p>
<p>He added that the board is "putting faith on (a) Time
Warner ruling" that allows the board to reject the Aon offer
on the basis of what it considers to be the best long-term
benefits to shareholders. Corroon & Black declined to comment
on Aon's statement.</p>
<p>A relieved Willis Faber, responding to Corroon's Tuesday
decision, said "We're pleased at the outcome and are looking
forward to getting the merger completed."</p>
<p>In London trading, Willis Faber shares rose 9 pence, to
210 pence -- a price that values the Willis Faber merger at
$648.2 million.</p>
