	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- The Federal Communications Commission
approved sweeping changes in the way it regulates local phone
companies' rates for interstate services and promised
billions of dollars in savings for customers over the next
four years.
   The FCC's modified price-cap system was designed to keep a
lid on rates for broad categories of services while giving
the phone companies flexibility to quickly raise or lower
prices and incentives to operate more efficiently. If the
phone companies can boost efficiency, their reward is higher
profits.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The price-cap plan, which goes into effect Jan. 1, is
mandatory for the seven regional Bell companies and GTE
Corp.'s local telephone operations. It is optional for
smaller phone companies. The commission's nearly unanimous
vote -- Commissioner Ervin Duggan dissented to part of the
plan -- comes a year and a half after the agency adopted
price caps for American Telephone & Telegraph Co.</p>
<p>The commission's action applies to fees charged to
long-distance carriers and big companies for access to local
telephone networks. The agency figures it could reduce
long-distance rates by slightly more than $2.8 billion over
the next four years compared with rates under the current
regulatory system, which allows companies to earn a specified
return on specified investments.</p>
<p>At yesterday's meeting, the commission also voted to lower
the allowed rate of return to 11.25% from 12% for local phone
companies -- including the hundreds that won't be covered
under price caps. The agency said the lower rate strikes a
balance between phone companies' continued access to capital
markets and fair rates for customers. The commission figures
the new rate, which goes into effect Jan. 1, will cut fees
for access to local phone networks by $337 million, of which
$317 million is attributed to the Baby Bells and GTE.</p>
<p>The FCC believes the price-cap plan gives phone companies
an incentive to lower their costs and operate more
efficiently, translating into lower rates and better service
for customers. Most phone customers, the agency claims, will
see indirect benefits as long-distance companies, which buy
services that allow access to the local phone networks, pass
along savings.</p>
<p>The plan drew swift criticism from user and consumer
groups. "This isn't price caps. It's profit-inflating, lagged
rate-of-return regulation," complained Gene Kimmelman,
legislative director for the Consumer Federation of America.
The outcome for most consumers, he said, will probably be
higher prices for long-distance service.</p>
<p>"Instead of spurring investment in the telephone networks,
this could choke it," said Brian Moir, a Washington lawyer
who represents the International Communications Association,
a group of big corporate telecommunications users.</p>
<p>Commissioner Duggan raised similar concerns in his partial
dissent, saying he feared higher rates would result from a
complicated price-capping formula for subscriber line access
to local phone networks.</p>
<p>Analysts, however, were enthusiastic about the
commission's decision. "In real terms, the Bells will earn
more money in 1991," said Jack Grubman of PaineWebber. Their
productivity gains, he said, far exceed the gains implied by
the FCC's price-cap mechanism.</p>
<p>Eventually, the new regulatory plan "will begin to
differentiate the companies, separating the wheat from the
chaff," said Robert B. Morris III of Goldman Sachs & Co., who
nevertheless raised some concerns about the long-term
implications. "Clearly in the short term, it is constructive
for the Bells," he said. "But it remains to be seen how the
industry will manage this."</p>
<p>Under the commission's plan, the caps will be applied to
four large "baskets" of service. The commission set limits on
price fluctuations for service categories within those
baskets. Much of the debate in recent months has focused on
an algebraic equation used to calculate the price cap for
subscriber line access to local networks, and the local
companies were busy yesterday testing how that formula will
work in real life.</p>
<p>"We're running the numbers right now," said Linda Burr,
director of federal regulatory matters at Pacific Telesis
Group's Pacific Bell unit. "In general, though, we're happy
with the FCC's decision."</p>
<p>The price-cap formula doesn't abandon traditional rate of
return regulation, which allows phone companies to earn a
specified return on their investment base. The commission
also said it will continue collecting phone company cost data
as well as information on service standards as a way of
monitoring consumer benefits under price caps. The commission
is using July 1, 1990, rates as a starting point for
price-cap indexes, adjusted down to reflect the new 11.25%
rate of return.</p>
<p>To determine the price cap, the agency is using a formula
that measures inflation, costs beyond a company's control
such as changes in tax laws, and expected productivity gains.
To solve bitter disputes over the productivity measure, the
commission offered a compromise: It adopted a plan that
assumes a 3.3% annual productivity increase, but lets phone
companies opt for 4.3%. Phone companies can switch annually.</p>
<p>Those that sign up for the more rigorous 4.3% adjustment
can retain a larger share of their earnings. They can earn a
return of 13.25% on their investment before splitting further
profits 50-50 with customers. After reaching 17.25%, all
profits will be returned to customers. With the 3.3% factor,
phone companies start sharing profits with customers when
their return reaches 12.25%, and earnings above 16.25% will
be returned to customers.</p>
