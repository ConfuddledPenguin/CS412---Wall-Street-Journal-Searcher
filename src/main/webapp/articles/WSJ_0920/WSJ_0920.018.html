	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Investors continued to pour money into taxable
money-market mutual funds in the latest week.
   Assets of the 436 taxable funds tracked by IBC/Donoghue's
Money Fund Report increased by $2.1 billion to a record $402
billion, the Holliston, Mass., newsletter reported. The
average seven-day compound yield, which assumes reinvestment
of dividends, dropped to 7.74% in the week ended Tuesday from
7.75%.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"We think investors are continuing to put money into money
funds to avoid turmoil in the stock and bond markets," said
Martha Wittbrodt, editor of Donoghue's.</p>
<p>Average maturity of the investments in the funds'
portfolios fell by one day, to 46 days. The funds invest in
such things as commercial paper (short-term corporate IOUs),
short-term bank certificates of deposit and Treasury bills.</p>
<p>The average seven-day simple yield of the taxable funds
dropped to 7.46% from 7.47%. The average 30-day simple yield
slipped to 7.47% from 7.48% and the average 30-day compound
yield eased to 7.75% from 7.76%.</p>
<p>Assets of 232 tax-free funds fell by $308.1 million, to
$80.9 billion, Donoghue's reported. The average seven-day
compound yield rose to 5.56% from 5.54%. The latest yield is
equal to a taxable yield of 7.72% for an investor in the 28%
tax bracket and 8.30% for someone paying 33% in taxes.</p>
<p>The average maturity of the tax-exempt funds rose by one
day, to 59 days.</p>
