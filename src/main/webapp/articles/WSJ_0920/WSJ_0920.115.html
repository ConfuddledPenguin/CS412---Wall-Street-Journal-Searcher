	<p class="article-leader">SAN FRANCISCO -- The results of a large community-based
clinical study confirm anecdotal evidence that the
adminstration of a sprayed drug greatly affects the
prevention of the leading cause of death of AIDS patients
   The drug, aerosolized pentamidine, helps in the prevention
of pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (PCP). The study, published
in today's issue of The New England Journal of Medicine,
shows the administration of varying doses of the drug -- from
30 milligrams to 300 milligrams -- over 18 months to 408
patients in 13 treatment centers in the San Francisco area.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The patients who received the highest dosage, 300 mg.
every four weeks, suffered the fewest cases of PCP. "There is
a clear trend here, that more is better," said Dr. Gifford S.
Leoung, assistant clinical professor at University of
California at San Francisco and the study's principal
investigator.</p>
<p>A separate but related study found that a new oral
treatment for first episodes of PCP is as effective as the
most common treatment and has fewer side effects. The study,
published in the same issue of The New England Journal of
Medicine, found that 92% of the 60 patients responded well
whether treated with the new drug, trimethoprim-dapsone, or
the standard treatment, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. But
only 30% of the patients taking the new drug had to stop
treatment because of severe side effects, compared with 57%
of the patients on the standard drug.</p>
<p>The two most common side effects reported from the
standard drug were hepatitis and neutropenia, which is a
decrease in infection-fighting white blood cells.</p>
