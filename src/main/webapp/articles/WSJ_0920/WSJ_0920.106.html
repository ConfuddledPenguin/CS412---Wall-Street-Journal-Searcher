	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- Neither the Republicans nor the Democrats
have a political advantage in the current budget standoff,
according to a new Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll.
   The poll, which underscores public concern about an
economic recession, shows that the public is equally divided
over whom to blame if no agreement is reached to reduce the
federal budget deficit. If the talks fail, 34% say the Bush
administration would be mostly to blame, while 31% say that
the Democrats in Congress would be mostly to blame.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Top congressional and administration officials continued
budget talks at the Capitol yesterday, seeking to break the
impasse over taxes and other issues.</p>
<p>The WSJ/NBC News poll, taken by Peter Hart, a Democrat,
and Robert Teeter, a Republican, was based on telephone
interviews Sept. 15-18 with 1,508 registered voters across
the nation. The poll carries a margin of error of 2.6
percentage points.</p>
<p>The results show virtually no public preference between
the Democratic plan, which, among other elements, includes an
energy tax and an additional income surtax on the very
wealthy, and the Bush administration plan, which includes a
smaller energy tax, limits on deductions for state and local
income taxes and a cut in the capital-gains tax.</p>
<p>"There is as much division on the issue among the public
as there is between the president and Congress," Mr. Hart and
Mr. Teeter say.</p>
<p>The poll shows that 43% of the public prefer the
Democratic plan, with 41% preferring the Bush administration
plan.</p>
<p>A Journal/NBC News poll in January showed the public split
over cutting the capital-gains tax, which assesses levies on
the profits from the sale of stocks, bonds and real estate.
In that poll, 47% opposed a capital-gains tax cut and 45%
supported it.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the poll shows there remains strong public
concern about the prospect of a recession. A majority (51%)
believes there will be a recession. The Iraqi invasion of
Kuwait triggered a major upsurge in public apprehensions
about the prospect of a recession; those apprehensions
haven't disappeared in the past six weeks even though the
initial shock of the invasion has worn off. Thirty-five
percent believe there won't be a recession. Republicans are
slightly less sure of the prospect of a recession than are
Democrats.</p>
<p>The budget talks that continued behind closed doors
yesterday were again limited, as they had been Tuesday, to
the five highest-ranking congressional leaders of both
parties and three top administration officials, in an effort
to cut down on acrimony and information leaks. At Tuesday's
session, House Speaker Thomas Foley (D., Wash.) and Senate
Majority Leader George Mitchell (D., Maine) asked to meet
with President Bush, but administration officials said
negotiations had to show more progress before the president
got involved again, congressional aides said.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, House Democratic leaders began considering the
need for an emergency government-funding bill, including a
possible provision to suspend across-the-board spending cuts
that would be triggered in October by the Gramm-Rudman
deficit-reduction law absent some budget accord.</p>
<p>Without an agreement in place after Oct. 1, the start of
fiscal 1991, government programs would be unfunded and at
least $85 billion in automatic cuts would be imposed by the
law. Senate GOP Leader Robert Dole began circulating a letter
to President Bush promising to support his veto of any
measure waiving the cuts. But given the pain such cuts would
impose on federal workers and beneficiaries of numerous
programs, Sen. Dole was having trouble getting signatures.</p>
<p>The four-month-old budget impasse and threatening fiscal
breakdown has fed frustration among lawmakers. Some House
Democrats now propose to draft their own budget that would
meet the budget negotiators' goal of $50 billion in budget
cuts for fiscal 1991, while protecting Democrats' favorite
social programs. But proponents acknowledged any such budget
would be difficult to pass. And House Democratic Leader
Richard Gephardt (D., Mo.) said he told the group that the
summit negotiators "have got to keep talking and see what we
can accomplish."</p>
<p>Despite congressional leaders' recommitment Tuesday to
bargain in "good faith," the troops from both parties
mobilized to put their own partisan spin on the impasse
through news conferences and floor speeches. Democrats
complained that only President Bush's insistence on lower
capital-gains taxes for the rich blocked a budget agreement.
Republicans in turn stressed that many other differences
remained, including the amount and kind of energy taxes and
Medicare cuts.</p>

<p>"If no agreement is reached on how to reduce the federal
budget deficit, who do you think will be mostly to blame --
the Bush administration or the Democrats in Congress?"</p>
