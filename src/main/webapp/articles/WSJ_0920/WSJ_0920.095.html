	<p class="article-leader">THE U.S. MILITARY IS PUSHING to keep troops permanently in
Saudi Arabia.
   According to senior military officers, the Army and Air
Force are quietly drafting the long-term strategy, involving
10,000 troops, as well as plans for securing air bases
throughout the Persian Gulf after the current crisis ends.
But civilian officials at the Pentagon denied that there is
such a policy, presaging a possible internal feud. Meanwhile,
Iraq said it is confiscating assets of nations participating
in economic sanctions against Baghdad. U.S. officials didn't
have any immediate estimate of the value of American assets
involved, but it probably isn't great.</p>

Iraq and Kuwait, and who are permitted to do so by the
Iraqis, will be flown out by Saturday.</p>

<p>Russia's parliament joined calls for Soviet Prime Minister
Ryzhkov to resign, with members blaming him for an economic
crisis and saying his proposed program can't rescue it. The
republic's legislators last week voted to adopt a more
radical 500-day plan for creating a market economy.</p>

<p>South Africa's de Klerk said he will appoint special units
to investigate four specific incidents of violence that have
occurred during more than five weeks of unrest in black
townships. The president's announcement was in response to
criticism from blacks that he isn't doing enough to quell the
factional fighting.</p>

<p>A top U.S. official for Africa went behind Liberian rebel
lines to meet with guerrilla chief Charles Taylor. Assistant
Secretary of State Herman Cohen, who met a day earlier with
rival rebel leader Prince Johnson, said Taylor seemed ready
to begin negotiations on ending the nine-month civil war.</p>

<p>Cambodia's peace talks collapsed as warring factions
disagreed over the future role of former Cambodian monarch
Sihanouk. The officials, meeting in Thailand, accused one
another of sabotaging the Supreme National Council, formed
last week to join members of the Vietnamese-installed regime
and a three-party guerrilla coalition.</p>

<p>The National Cancer Institute found that people who live
near nuclear facilities don't face a greater risk of death
from cancer than those who live elsewhere. The government
research agency compared mortality data in 107 counties
surrounding all 62 U.S. nuclear facilities with data from
similar counties without nuclear plants.</p>

<p>The House approved a $283 billion defense bill that would
make wholesale cuts in Bush's fiscal 1991 budget request for
the Strategic Defense Initiative and B-2 Stealth bomber. The
256-155 vote came despite the threat of a presidential veto
and sharp differences with a Senate-approved measure.</p>

<p>Israel's defense minister accused the U.S. of failing to
honor its pledge to maintain Israel's military superiority in
the Mideast. Arens, returning to Jerusalem after meetings in
Washington, said the U.S. isn't selling military equipment to
the Israelis that is of higher quality than the equipment it
is selling various Arab armed forces.</p>

<p>South Korea's Roh dismissed two ministers and transferred
a third as the president sought to counter critics who blame
the government for failing to prevent floods last week and
are angry over farm policy. But the opposition demanded other
officials resign following the floods that killed at least
127 people in Seoul and nearby areas.</p>

<p>Environmental groups urged federal protection for the
Pacific yew, a tree with bark that provides a scarce new
cancer-fighting drug called taxol. In a petition to Interior
Secretary Lujan, the groups requested that the tree be listed
as threatened under the Endangered Species Act.</p>

<p>Massachusetts voters selected the outspoken John Silber as
the Democratic nominee for governor, in an expression of
voter alienation. Silber is on leave as president of Boston
University. Meanwhile, Oklahoma voters approved a limit on
state lawmakers' tenure of 12 years.</p>

<p>The Senate Judiciary Committee ended its confirmation
hearings on Supreme Court nominee Souter after listening to
nearly 40 witnesses testify for or against the federal judge
from New Hampshire. Committee Chairman Biden said he hoped
the 14-member panel would vote on Souter's nomination by the
end of next week.</p>
