	<p class="article-leader">LOS ANGELES -- Northrop Corp.'s chairman, Thomas V. Jones,
retired yesterday, just as an International Chamber of
Commerce ruling surfaced saying that $6.25 million in South
Korean payments by the company were meant to induce Seoul to
buy Northrop F-20 fighter planes.
   The ruling, a copy of which was obtained by this
newspaper, said the Northrop payments never were intended to
be part of a hotel-development venture in the country, as the
company said.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Mr. Jones, a 70-year-old executive who was often at the
center of controversy during 30 years in Northrop top
managment, was succeeded by Kent Kresa. Mr. Kresa, 52,
retains his posts as Northrop's president and chief executive
officer. Mr. Jones remains a board member.</p>
<p>Two federal grand juries are examining whether Northrop
executives violated the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act in its
marketing of the F-20s and whether Mr. Jones may have
disobeyed the terms of a consent decree he signed in a
foreign-payments case in the mid-1970s requiring Northrop not
to bribe foreign officials.</p>
<p>The sharply worded arbitrator's opinion, dated Aug. 29,
dismissed claims by Northrop that a group of unscrupulous
South Korean businessmen bilked the defense contractor out of
the $6,250,000 in the hotel deal. Arbitrator Wolfgang Kuhn
wrote, "This was not a situation where low-level employees
colluded to defraud Northrop, but instead Northrop was acting
through its highest level of management in violation of the
law."</p>
<p>Strikingly, Mr. Kuhn named names. He said he was convinced
that former Northrop executives James Dorsey, Donald Foulds
and Welko Gasich, and "probably Mr. Jones . . . knew of and
approved" an oral understanding that funds were to be
diverted from the ersatz hotel project to the late Park Chong
Kyu, a powerful businessman with ties to upper levels of the
government in Seoul.</p>
<p>The 44-page ruling is a major setback for Northrop. The
aerospace and defense concern lost a similar decision in July
before the Korean Commercial Arbitration Board, but the
company attributed that ruling to legal technicalities. At
that time Northrop indicated that the decision by the
international chamber would carry more weight.</p>
<p>A Northrop spokesman said the company was disappointed
with the arbitrator's ruling, and maintained that the finding
doesn't "support widespread reports and allegations that the
company's investment in this hotel was to be used to make
payments to Korean government officials." He said Northrop
still is pursuing a related civil lawsuit in Seoul.</p>
<p>Mr. Kresa, in an interview, said there wasn't any link
between the ruling and Mr. Jones's decision to retire. He
said both issues came up at a regular board meeting
yesterday, along with other matters, but were unconnected.
"This was his decision," Mr. Kresa said of Mr. Jones's
retirement, adding that in the 21 months since Mr. Jones
turned over the chief-executive job to Mr. Kresa, there grew
"a sense that it was a proper time to make the transition."</p>
<p>Rep. Thomas Bliley (R., Va.), a member of the House Energy
and Commerce subcommittee that is investigating Northrop,
called the arbitrator's ruling "another blow to Northrop's
implausible story that it was the victim of clever Korean con
men." He said the Pentagon should "consider whether
additional contracts should be awarded to Northrop," given
"the integrity" of its management.</p>
<p>The subcommittee's chairman, Rep. John Dingell (D.,
Mich.), whose investigators obtained the ruling, said he
would soon call for Northrop to discuss the F-20 case at a
hearing. But staff members said setting a date has been
slowed in part by Northrop's desire to avoid having Mr. Kresa
sit at the same witness table with Mr. Jones. Mr. Kresa said
the reasons for testifying separately "are rather
straightforward," and reflect his own desire to concentrate
on "where the company is going," while Mr. Jones discusses
legal issues and other matters that arose during his tenure.
"I didn't want to blur those lines," Mr. Kresa said.</p>
<p>Mr. Dorsey's attorney, Daniel Bookin, declined to comment.
Mr. Foulds's lawyer, Jan Lawrence Handzlik, said: "The
arbitrator is simply wrong. Mr. Foulds had no knowledge of a
supposed agreement to divert money to Park. Mr. Foulds was
involved in legitimate counter-trade investment activities in
Korea."</p>
<p>Michael Klein, Mr. Gasich's attorney, said the conclusions
about his client are "outrageous and self-evidently a stretch
. . . and extraordinarily difficult to see on the facts."
Neither Mr. Jones nor a lawyer for him, Leonard Janofsky,
could be reached.</p>
<p>The arbitrator said he based his conclusions on both
testimony and written documents. For instance, while Mr.
Gasich basically denied knowing that Mr. Park -- a gregarious
former army colonel nicknamed "Pistol Park" because of a
fondness for guns -- was behind the hotel venture or had
requested any money for his services, the arbitrator
determined that the statement was contradicted by two memos
signed by Mr. Gasich.</p>
<p>Mr. Kuhn also said Northrop's contentions about its hotel
plans were undercut by the inexperience of Northrop and of
the Korean concern it was involved with, Asia Culture Travel
Development Co., in the hotel business. He said Northrop "did
not take elementary preliminary steps" to solicit financial
statements from Asia Culture Travel to guarantee the
investment; that there wasn't ever an Asia Culture Travel
shareholder meeting to consider the issue; and that Northrop
transferred the funds despite irregularities involving the
appraised value of the Asia Culture Travel property.</p>
<p>"One of the most telling pieces of evidence is that
Northrop paid $6.25 million to an {Asia Culture Travel}
account in Hong Kong over which it had no control," Mr. Kuhn
said. "Moreover, this money transfer was made before there
was any necessity to pay this entire sum, since governmental
approval for the {hotel} project had not yet been granted."
The arbitrator also pointed out that while Northrop justified
a need for a hotel investment as part of a standard industry
practice of offsetting currency fluctuations in foreign
countries, the company didn't involve its offset manager in
Korea in the hotel project.</p>
<p>The 52-year-old Mr. Kresa served at the company's aircraft
group before becoming president in 1987. The major program at
the group was the B-2 Stealth bomber, developed in secrecy
but now the center of a Pentagon procurement battle.
Northrop's design for the YF-23, one of two candidates for
the huge Air Force Advanced Tactical Fighter program, also
was developed there. The F-20 program was canceled several
years ago without a sale ever being made.</p>
<p>The B-2 has been one of a number of Northrop production
programs subject to various government investigations in
recent years. In February, Northrop pleaded guilty to 34
counts of falsifying test results in its work on the
air-launched cruise missile and the AV-8B Harrier fighter
jet. Criminal inquiries also have been conducted into its
work on the navigational system for the MX missile.</p>
<p>Mr. Jones, who pleaded guilty to a felony count for
creating a secret political slush fund to contribute to
President Nixon's 1972 campaign, resigned as chairman of the
company for a time after a special Northrop report in 1975
saddled him with "a heavy share of the responsibility for the
irregularities and improprieties" involving payments made
during the industry's foreign-payoff scandal of the early
1970s. He kept the titles of president and chief executive
through that period, however.</p>
