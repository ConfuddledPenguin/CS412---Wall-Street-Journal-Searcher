	<p class="article-leader">OFF LONG BRANCH, N.J. -- If sharks wrote novels, Richard
Bruno might be cast as the villain of one called "Hooks."
   Here he is aboard his fishing vessel Gannet in the
Atlantic Ocean, in sight of the Manhattan skyline, winching
in a seven-mile length of monofilament line tied with 800
baited hooks, each one intended to turn a guileless shark
into somebody's dinner.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Despite sharks' vile public image, Mr. Bruno has his
detractors -- people who are "trying to give sharks a
personality and make us look like the sharks," Mr. Bruno
says. "But no amount of propaganda will make sharks any less
aggressive, fierce predators."</p>
<p>Shark propaganda? Its time has come. The pro-shark folks
are on the rise.</p>
<p>Most pro-sharkers concede that sharks aren't cuddly
creatures (although Stuart Cove, owner of Nassau Undersea
Adventures in the Bahamas, takes divers out three times a
week to ride, pet and hug sharks. "We refer to them as puppy
dogs," he says.) Shark fans do say that "negative
interactions" between man and shark -- shark attacks, to the
unenlightened -- are vastly exaggerated in number and
seriousness. Sharks, these people say, are just as worthy of
protection as their cutesy, warm-blooded neighbors, like
dolphins and whales.</p>
<p>Sharks, they say, need compassion and understanding.</p>
<p>The movement has risen in part as a response to a
government program begun several years ago encouraging
professional fishermen like Mr. Bruno to harvest the
underutilized meat and fins of shark.</p>
<p>Demand for shark fins, used as an ingredient in shark-fin
soup, an Oriental delicacy, has soared. Shark meat, once
disguised under names such as flake and steak fish, has
become an acceptable alternative to higher-priced tuna and
swordfish. Fishermen say they get $2 to $2.50 a pound at the
dock for prized mako shark steak and about 50 cents a pound
for the less desirable species. A shark fin brings $5 to $10
a pound. The Fulton Fish Market Retail Store at the South
Street Seaport in New York sells mako shark to consumers at
$5.95 a pound, swordfish at $8.95 a pound and tuna at $9.95 a
pound.</p>
<p>Conservationists, fearing for the shark's survival, are
trying to burnish the predator's image with position papers,
newsletters, exhibits and documentaries. "Sharks are really
very timid animals," says Quenton Dokken, executive director
of the Texas State Aquarium in Corpus Christi. "They aren't
the bloodthirsty mankillers they are made out to be."</p>
<p>Sportfishermen are concerned about sharks, too. At
Hoffman's Anchorage in Brielle, N.J., the shark angling has
grown so poor, presumably from overfishing, that the marina's
annual shark tournaments have been canceled. "Fishermen are
bummed out," says Todd Colabella, the dockmaster. Mark
Quartiano, a Miami charter boat captain, says that fewer
customers are keeping sharks to be mounted as trophies. "They
feel sorry for them," he says. Mr. Quartiano has lately been
dispatching cameramen into the water to videotape customers'
catches and their release.</p>
<p>Even Peter Benchley, author of "Jaws," has some sympathy
for sharks. "I don't feel any more guilty about `Jaws' than
Mario Puzo should feel about `The Godfather,'" he says, but
he adds that he has narrated shark documentaries with a
conservationist slant and now writes novels that "portray
animals as victims and man as the predator."</p>
<p>Sharks' low reproductive rate and slow growth to maturity
make them particularly vulnerable to overfishing. "Tuna, cod
and striped bass can lay millions of eggs and rebound very
quickly," says Jack Musick, head of the fisheries section at
the College of William and Mary's Virginia Institute of
Marine Science. "But once sharks are overfished, you can kiss
them goodbye."</p>
<p>The National Marine Fisheries Service is preparing a plan
to protect sharks by imposing on Gulf and East Coast shark
fishermen permit requirements, catch limits and a ban on the
killing of sharks for their fins alone. Some states,
including North Carolina, are adopting their own shark
protection plans.</p>
<p>Conservationists are trying to rally public support. That
may be hard. Says David Doubilet, an underwater photographer
for National Geographic magazine: "Sharks, to be quite
honest, are cold fish." Mr. Doubilet says the shark's
efficiency makes it a fitting symbol of our age. "When you
look into a shark's eye, it's really like looking into the
depths of a machine rather than looking into the depths of a
creature," he says.</p>
<p>Still, "sharks simply try do the best in their
environment, which is what we all do," says Mimi Armstrong,
member of a husband-wife film company in Los Angeles called
SafeSharks Inc.</p>
<p>Others are going further on behalf of the shark. Eugenie
Clark, a zoology professor at the University of Maryland,
says she frequently swims right alongside sharks. And once,
she reached out from her protective cage and petted a great
white shark -- the "Jaws" species -- as it passed. "It is
safer to swim with sharks than drive your car on the
highway," she says.</p>
<p>Environmental groups, including the National Audubon
Society and Greenpeace, are launching their own campaigns to
save the shark. Sid Clark, the managing editor of Chondros, a
newsletter about sharks and their relatives, is firing off
letters to set straight the makers of games, movies, toys,
books and foods that perpetuate a negative view of sharks.</p>
<p>One of his targets is General Mills Inc., which asks
children to eat its Shark Bites candies, "before they eat
you]" Barry Wegener, a public-relations manager at General
Mills, says that "to portray the shark as other than what it
is is an injustice to sharks and to the profession of public
relations."</p>
<p>Samuel Gruber, a professor of marine biology at the
University of Miami, praises sharks' importance as
scavengers, ridding the oceans of weak and dying creatures;
their resistance to cancer; their keen sense of smell, and
their ability to detect weak electric fields. But there is no
denying, adds Mr. Gruber, that one of sharks' most awesome
features is the power of their teeth and jaws. "Their bite
looks like the impression left by an ice cream scoop," he
says. "Bones and all go neatly away. It's a terrible,
terrible sight."</p>
<p>That sort of negative interaction, says George Burgess,
senior biologist at the Florida Museum of Natural History at
Gainesville, Fla., and keeper of the International Shark
Attack File, mostly occurs in murky, turbulent water where
sharks can easily mistake humans for their normal prey. He
says that sharks wound just 50 to 75 people around the world
in an average year, only 20% of them mortally.</p>
<p>None of this sits too well with sharkhaters. "I hear about
shark numbers dwindling, and it just makes me a little more
comfortable in the water," says Dean Schoonover, a New Jersey
surfer.</p>
<p>Mr. Bruno, 49 years old, who built boats for a living
before turning to shark fishing, makes his distaste clear,
too. As he pulls in a six-foot sandbar shark, its jaws
clutching a smaller shark that had taken hook and bait, he
says: "Nice guys. They eat their own kind." Today the Gannet
catches only seven sharks, but on better days the catch
exceeds 40. "There is a staggering amount of sharks out
here," he says. "I'm having a field day."</p>
<p>Mr. Bruno's crewmen grab the sandbar shark with big steel
hooks to avoid its snapping jaws and ease it on deck next to
butchered shark corpses. "Look at the mouth on that critter,"
Mr. Bruno says. "He'll take off your arm in one bite]"</p>
<p>Right on, says Bernard Leroy, owner of Bernard's Cafe News
in New York, which sells a lot of shark dinners. "You always
try to eat what you want to be," Mr. Leroy says. "The shark
is the ultimate capitalist animal. It eats other animals to
become bigger and bigger."</p>
