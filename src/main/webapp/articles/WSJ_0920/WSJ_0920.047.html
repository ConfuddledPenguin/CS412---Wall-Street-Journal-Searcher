	<div class="article-body"><p>Japan's astronomical land prices continued to rise in the
12 months to July 1, but growth rates in some of the hottest
markets slowed sharply after April.</p>
<p>According to a survey by the National Land Agency,
residential land prices increased 13.2% on average -- the
fastest rate since the early 1970s. Commercial land prices
rose 13.4%.</p>
<p>The figures released yesterday, which represent appraised
values of some 25,328 parcels of land throughout Japan as of
July 1, don't show any actual declines. But they do indicate
a sudden cooling since April in such torrid markets as Osaka
and Kyoto. For example, in metropolitan Osaka, residential
land prices jumped by 48.2% in the 12-month period to July 1.
But after April 1, prices rose just 2.8% for the three-month
period.</p>
<p>By some calculations, the value of all land in Japan at
current market prices is around four times the total value of
U.S. real estate.</p>
<p>ARRESTING EAST GERMANY'S SPIES</p>
<p>Having dropped a plan to issue a general amnesty, West
German officials expect to start arresting East German spies
after the country unifies with East Germany in less than two
weeks. Some experts estimate the sweep could involve as many
as 8,000 people. The plan isn't universally applauded in West
Germany, where some politicians had wanted to avoid linking
the otherwise upbeat prospect of unification with a focus on
problems leftover from the nation's past.

<p>INDONESIA'S NUCLEAR PLANS</p>
<p>British Secretary of State for Energy John Wakeham said
his country wants to participate in an Indonesian
nuclear-energy project. Mr. Wakeham, speaking in Jakarta,
said he met with Mines and Energy Minister Ginanjar
Kartasasmita and President Suharto and discussed the
possibility of expanding energy cooperation between the two
countries. Mr. Ginanjar said Indonesia has established
cooperative links with West Germany, France and the U.S. to
develop nuclear-power plants. Indonesia's first nuclear-power
plant, to be built in Central Java, is expected to be
operational in the year 2000.</p>
<p>ALL NIPPON'S EXPANSION</p>
<p>Japan's All Nippon Airways announced a five-year plan
calling for expansion of overseas networks. By the end of the
plan, the airline hopes international services will account
for 36% of its overall business, up from about 19% now. It
plans to add routes to Berlin and Barcelona from Tokyo and to
London and Paris from Osaka.</p>
<p>LONDON NEWSPAPER SQUABBLE</p>
<p>London's Financial Times, printed on pink paper, was
rebuffed when it sought a preliminary injunction against the
Evening Standard for using pink paper for a new eight-page
business section. The FT argued that the Standard was trying
"to pass off" the section as being published "by or with the
collaboration" of the FT. The Standard argued that a color
can't be copyrighted. The court ruled that it is unlikely the
two papers could be confused.</p>
<p>A RECORD BEER SEASON</p>
<p>Japan consumed a record 572 million gallons of beer
between June and August, up from 494 million gallons in the
same period last year, the National Tax Administration Agency
said. On average, Japan's 90 million legal drinkers each
purchased six gallons of beer and each paid $36 in taxes to
the government. The agency said Japan's hot summer helped
boost consumption along with active marketing by
manufacturers pushing new brands.</p>
<p>NEW DELHI PROSTITUTES' DEMAND</p>
<p>Prostitutes in New Delhi have petitioned the government to
set aside jobs and educational places for their children.</p>
<p>Lalchand Vidyarthi, a male social worker who helped found
a prostitutes' group in the Indian capital in 1982, said the
group had submitted the demand to Prime Minister Viswanath
Pratap Singh. "A delegation of our group met Singh and he was
sympathetic to us," Mr. Vidyarthi said, noting that "The
prostitute is the most exploited class of Indian society and
her children are most vulnerable."</p>
<p>Mr. Vidyarthi said that in its years of existence, the
prostitutes' group "has not got very far, because of the
hypocrisy in our society." He explained: "Many people of
influence come to prostitutes regularly but few admit they
and their children need protection."</p>
<p>In India, it is difficult to enroll children in school
unless it can be proved they were born within marriage. A
prostitute usually has to declare a pimp to be her husband to
get her children admitted, Mr. Vidyarthi said.</p>
<p>POSTSCRIPTS . . .</p>
<p>East Germany shut down its parliament building in East
Berlin yesterday after finding dangerous levels of asbestos,
forcing lawmakers to look for a new place to meet. The Palace
of the Republic, built by the Communists, has been mentioned
as the possible new house of a united parliament if the seat
of the new German government is moved to Berlin. . . .
Pilgrims to Lourdes were rationed to one glass of holy water
each Wednesday because of France's drought. "The source has
not dried out, but it no longer meets demand," said officials
at the Roman Catholic shrine, whose waters are reputed to
heal the sick.</p>
