	<p class="article-leader">TOKYO -- Japan's Mitsubishi Group and West Germany's
Daimler-Benz AG said they are moving toward cooperation on
about a dozen products, from cross-country vehicles to
semiconductors, but disclosed basic agreement on only one new
venture-boosting sales of Mercedes-Benz cars in Japan.
   "The effort expended in terms of getting to know each
other has been greater than I had expected," Daimler-Benz
Chairman Edzard Reuter said in a statement after the first
set of top-level meetings since the two giant industrial
groups began exploring a global alliance in March.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Shinroku Morohashi, president of the Mitsubishi Corp.
trading house at the center of the Japanese group, said at a
news conference after the three-hour meeting that the talks
"will take considerable time to reach fruition." But he added
that "given another six months we will be able to report
further progress."</p>
<p>Some of the projects have been reported before, but
yesterday's news conference provided the most detailed
progress report since the first talks, in Singapore, six
months ago. The most progress has apparently come in the
automotive business, where each group concentrates on
opposite ends of the spectrum. Gerhard Liener, Daimler-Benz
chief financial officer, said Mercedes-Benz AG and Mitsubishi
Motors Corp. were near completion of an agreement to design,
develop and jointly produce cross-country vehicles.</p>
<p>The companies also said they expect to form shortly a
joint venture along with Yanase & Co., a Japanese distributor
of imported cars, to expand Mercedes-Benz's sales network in
Japan, including arranging for some Mitsubishi dealers to
sell the German cars. Mercedes says it is the leader in
Japan's tiny import market, and with the new agreement hopes
to boost sales to 60,000 a year by 1995 from the current
37,000.</p>
<p>Regarding previously disclosed discussions on sharing
technology for an auto factory in what is now East Germany,
Mr. Liener said Daimler-Benz must first complete its own
plans for the site before negotiating Mitsubishi's
involvement. He said economic conditions have delayed
cooperation on an auto factory in the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>In the potentially significant area of aerospace, Koichi
Danno, director of Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Ltd., said
they were talking about working together on aerospace
systems, ultrasonic measuring devices and medium-sized
commercial aircraft. Mr. Liener said the companies were
discussing three-way cooperation with United Technologies
Corp., which already works with Mitsubishi Heavy Industries.</p>
<p>Executives said Mitsubishi and Daimler-Benz are exploring
making versions of each other's chips, and that talks were
focusing on semiconductors for the consumer electronics
products of Daimler unit AEG AG.</p>
<p>On Oct. 1, Mitsubishi Corp. will set up an office in
Stuttgart near Daimler-Benz headquarters.</p>
