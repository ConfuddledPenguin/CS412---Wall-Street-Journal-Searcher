	<p class="article-leader">Like all companies with "poison pill" provisions, Instron
Corp. hoped that its takeover defense would protect the
company from hostile suitors.
   But now Instron may be getting a taste of its own
medicine.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Under the provisions of Instron's pill, stockholders gain
the right to purchase additional shares at below-market
prices whenever an individual or group gains control of 20%
or more of the company's shares. This makes the company more
expensive for a raider to buy.</p>
<p>But what happens when the existing management group,
rather than a raider, breaks the 20% barrier with no intent
to change the status quo?</p>
<p>A lawsuit filed earlier this month in a Massachusetts
state court claims it means that the rest of the shareholders
must be granted the lucrative stock-purchase rights
guaranteed by the pill -- even if that outcome turns the
obvious intent of the anti-takeover provision on its head.</p>
<p>In this case, the lawsuit alleges, Instron's own founders
triggered the poison pill when they declared in a news
release in July that they and family members owned about 39%
of Instron's stock. Ironically, the purpose of the news
release was to oppose a takeover, not to start one.</p>
<p>While many companies' poison pills explicitly state that
officers and controlling shareholders are exempt from the
pill's provisions, Instron's pill contains no such exemption.
Stephen Carr, a partner at Goodwin, Procter & Hoar, which
drafted the pill, said such a provision wasn't necessary. He
said no "group" of shareholders owns 20% or more and that the
news release didn't create such a group.</p>
<p>Takeover experts said the lawsuit apparently marks the
first time that controlling shareholders or managers have
been accused of triggering a poison pill.</p>
<p>"This certainly is a new wrinkle," said Alan Bromberg, a
professor of securities law at Southern Methodist University
in Dallas. Mr. Bromberg said that if the Instron founders in
fact authorized the news release or were acting as a
"controlling group," as defined by the poison pill, the novel
suit might actually succeed.</p>
<p>Stephen Rabinovitz, a Boston investor, filed the lawsuit
on behalf of himself and other Instron shareholders in
Superior Court in Boston. Mr. Rabinovitz's group had said in
a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission in July
that they were interested in acquiring control of Instron, a
Canton, Mass.-based maker of materials testing instruments.</p>
<p>Michael Schell, a partner at the New York firm of Skadden,
Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom who is defending Instron, said
that Mr. Rabinovitz is notorious for "facilitating his own
personal objectives" by "making noise" and filing suits. Mr.
Schell said that Instron intends to vigorously defend against
the suit, although he won't say on what grounds.</p>
<p>Mr. Schell added that Skadden Arps had no role in writing
the news release or the poison-pill provision.</p>

<p>PLANNED PARENTHOOD loses appeal over limits on federal
funds abroad.</p>
<p>The U.S. appeals court in Manhattan upheld a federal
policy banning the use of U.S. funds to "perform or actively
promote abortions" in foreign countries. The federal aid
involved is family-planning assistance from the Agency for
International Development. The money is distributed to
foreign organizations through Planned Parenthood and other
nongovernmental groups in the U.S.</p>
<p>Planned Parenthood claimed that the rule, adopted by the
Reagan administration in 1984, violated its free-speech
rights by requiring it to enforce restrictions on speech in
order to qualify for the program. But the Second U.S. Circuit
Court of Appeals said no rights were violated because Planned
Parenthood wasn't prohibited from using its own money for the
activities.</p>
<p>"A policy of not subsidizing the exercise of a fundamental
right differs in an important respect from a prohibition on
the exercise of a fundamental right," the appeals-court panel
said. The ruling upheld a lower-court decision dismissing the
case.</p>
<p>A Planned Parenthood spokeswoman said the organization is
considering whether to appeal.</p>

<p>BAN ON SOME TIMBER SUITS is rejected as unconstitutional.</p>
<p>The ban was contained in the so-called Northwest Timber
Compromise. Congress enacted the law in 1989 to allow for
limited timber harvests for a year in certain old-growth
forests in California and Oregon that are populated by the
northern spotted owl. The law was designed as a temporary, if
forced, truce between warring environmental and timber
interests while a presidential commission developed a final
plan for protecting the owl, recently designated a threatened
species.</p>
<p>But the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals rejected a
provision of the legislation requiring federal courts to
dismiss suits challenging the timber sales. Reversing a
lower-court ruling, the appeals court said Congress had
violated the constitutional separation of powers by requiring
the courts to rule in a particular way without changing the
underlying laws that would permit such suits.</p>
<p>The act expires on Sept. 30; Congress has been considering
extending the law for another year because the presidential
panel report itself has been delayed.</p>
<p>Todd True, an attorney in Seattle for the Sierra Club
Legal Defense Fund, said environmental groups were still
assessing possible suits. He said the ruling would be a
useful precedent in fighting other attempts by Congress to
bar judicial review of environmental laws.</p>
<p>Mark Rutzick, an attorney in Portland for the Northwest
Forest Resource Council, a timber industry consortium, added,
however: "To tie up a sale, one must prove that it will have
an unlawful impact on the spotted owl." He also said the
timber group is mulling an appeal.</p>

<p>FRANCHISEES bring civil racketeering suit against American
Vision.</p>
<p>In a suit filed in U.S. District Court in New York, eight
franchisees in New York and Georgia allege that American
Vision Centers Inc. profited from store-opening services that
it should have provided at cost and misrepresented the
success of company-owned stores that it sold to franchisees.
The suit also alleges that American Vision claimed
franchisees would make money renewing contact-lens insurance,
then started a division to renew the policies itself.</p>
<p>The franchisees also claim that American Vision Centers
didn't obtain regulatory approval to sell franchises in New
York state and failed to account for advertising fees --
equal to 6.5% of a franchisee's sales -- that it collected
from franchisees. The suit seeks to recover alleged losses of
more than $1 million, plus treble damages.</p>
<p>Seth Poppel, American Vision Centers president and chief
operating officer, says the suit is a response to legal and
other actions American Vision Centers has taken against
several of the plaintiffs who allegedly owe his company
money. "The suit is totally without merit," Mr. Poppel says.
"The bulk of our franchisees are profitable and happy." Of
American Vision Centers' 82 stores, 36 are franchisees.</p>
<p>Mr. Poppel says the failure of numerous franchisees to pay
royalties and other fees has contributed to American Vision
Centers' financial problems.</p>
<p>The company has reported losses of more than $2.5 million
annually since 1987. During the first half of this year, it
reported further losses of $1.8 million on $18.7 million in
revenue.</p>

<p>NEWSPAPER loses bid to keep unpublished photographs
confidential.</p>
<p>The Albuquerque Journal's pictures were taken of a 1985
highway accident in which 62-year-old Eleanor Barton was
killed. Her husband, John Barton, is suing Ford Motor Co. for
negligence and product liability, alleging that a defect in
her car caused the accident. Both Mr. Barton and Ford sought
the newspaper's unused photos and negatives, saying they were
needed to help determine the relative position of the
vehicles involved in the accident.</p>
<p>Attorneys for the Albuquerque Journal argued that
producing the pictures interfered with the news process in
violation of the paper's First Amendment rights. But State
District Judge Art Encinias in Santa Fe, N.M., ruled that the
photos are "relevant, essential and material" to deciding key
issues in the case. And the New Mexico Supreme Court refused
without comment the newspaper's request to block the
lower-court order.</p>
<p>Kent Walz, assistant editor of the Albuquerque Journal,
said the paper planned to comply with the order, but it was
still considering an appeal aimed at clarifying the First
Amendment question.</p>

<p>HARVARD LAW SCHOOL reinstates public-interest law
counseling post.</p>
<p>Harvard Law School Dean Robert C. Clark has appointed
Stacy DeBroff, a lawyer who isn't a member of the faculty, to
the position of public-interest law counselor. Elimination of
the position last year prompted protests from students.</p>
<p>A Harvard Law School spokesman said "over 100 students"
have already met with Ms. DeBroff. The keen interest in
finding jobs in the public-interest field seems to be an
indication that "there is a new activism among students
here," he said.</p>
<p>The counseling position was first established in the late
1970s to help students tap the network of increasingly scarce
public-interest jobs.</p>
<p>Public-interest law includes such areas as legal aid for
the poor, consumer advocacy and congressional staff work, all
paying much less than associate positions at top private law
firms.</p>
