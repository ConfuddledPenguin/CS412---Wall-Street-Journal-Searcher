	<p class="article-leader">EUREKA, Nev. -- The most important workers at the Tonkin
Springs Gold Mine are too small to wear hard hats. About 2.5
billion of them fit into a square centimeter.
   They're bacteria. Billions of them swirl around in huge
tanks of gray liquid at the mine, eating dissolved ore and
releasing gold into the water. The happier they are, the more
ore they eat and the more gold they release. "Our goal in
life is to make bugs very happy," says U.S. Gold Corp.
President William Reid, 42 years old, who heads the company
along with his brother David, 40, the exploration chief.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The Reids and their bugs are attempting to unlock gold
from the rust-colored, sulfurous dirt of these central Nevada
hills. If this experiment in so-called bioleaching works,
U.S. Gold will have developed a modern-day alchemy worth
millions to it and its new venture partner, Homestake Mining
Co. If it fails, U.S. Gold will vanish under a mountain of
debt and broken dreams.</p>
<p>Although U.S. Gold is a midget among the nation's giant
gold miners, its success or failure in this project is
important to the country's gold mining industry. U.S. miners
desperately need new technology to release hard-to-refine
gold reserves economically, but no one has come up with it.</p>
<p>With the mining world watching closely, the Tonkin Springs
experiment has had a rough baptism, bringing U.S. Gold to the
brink of bankruptcy more than once. To keep lenders at bay
and continue the project, the Reids have had to sell off all
the company's other assets. And recently, desperate for cash
to continue the experiment, they signed an agreement giving
part ownership and control of the operation to Homestake.</p>
<p>The gold mining industry has always depended on people
like the Reids. Most gold exploration is done by small firms,
which then sell their projects to larger companies. To be a
gold miner, says Thomas D. Kaufman, professor at the Colorado
School of Mines, you have to be a gambler. The Reids are no
exception. "If you're not worried, you're not risking
enough," Bill Reid says. "I believe life should be an
adventure, and we're having a hell of an adventure right
now."</p>
<p>Early prospectors searched for nuggets and water-borne
flakes that required little refining. But most of that
"placer" and "alluvial" gold was gone by about 1950. By 1960,
the domestic gold industry was dead, as miners moved on to
copper, lead and zinc. But by 1980, prices for those metals
had plunged.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, companies rediscovered cyanide leaching, a
technique developed by the U.S. Bureau of Mines during the
Depression that could pull microscopic gold from oxidized
ores. Driven by rising gold prices, new gold boomtowns sprang
up in the West. In 1989, 8.6 million ounces of gold were
produced, up from about 970,000 ounces when the decade began.</p>
<p>Now, however, those oxidized ores are also playing out --
proven reserves have dwindled to a 23-year supply from 69
years in 1982 -- and the domestic gold industry is once again
threatened. Mining companies searching for the next big
strike are straying overseas, where pickings are better.</p>
<p>Supply isn't the problem; many experts estimate that only
10% of the nation's gold has been found. But much of what's
left is trapped in so-called refractory ores, in which gold
is chemically bound with iron and sulfur. And refining those
ores has been a problem.</p>
<p>The cost of pressure-cooking refractory ore in autoclaves
is more than twice that of cyanide leaching, limiting its use
to very rich ores. Roasting refractory ores, another
technique, emits worrisome gases. Milling can release the
ore, too, but it works only on the highest-grade ores.</p>
<p>Bioleaching, the approach being pursued by U.S. Gold, is
considered more environmentally compatible and cheaper.
Dozens of U.S. mining companies have lab-scale bioleaching
experiments under way, and some pilot projects are planned.
But no one in the U.S. had ventured to try the process on a
commercial scale until U.S. Gold took the plunge three years
ago. "Most people are interested in getting their gold out of
the ground and making a profit, not in being a hero," says
John Tumazos, metals analyst at Donaldson Lufkin & Jenrette.</p>
<p>For the Reids, however, plunging into the unknown waters
of bioleaching was in character. After leaving Indiana with
geology degrees and the age-old gold fever, the brothers
started the company as Monte Cristo Mining & Milling Co. in
1977 with $7,000 from a second mortgage on Bill's house. They
squeezed silver out of abandoned claims behind Pikes Peak,
David says, by patching up old machinery, designing their own
mills and pinching pennies. "I knew we'd reached some level
of efficiency when our welder was using coat hangers to fix
some of the equipment," he says.</p>
<p>As Silver State Mining Corp., the brothers went public in
1980 at 10 cents a share -- just as the bottom fell out of
the silver market. Quickly, Bill and David switched their
attention to gold, and in 1982, they bought a mine near
Victor, Colo., that brought them five comfortable years of
profits. The company name became U.S. Gold.</p>
<p>But dreams, not comfort, drive the brothers. They wanted
to be more than one of hundreds of little gold mining
companies, and they knew they needed a niche to break out of
that class. Tonkin Springs was their chance. They bought the
mine, knowing that the majority of the ore there was
refractory. By being in the lead in refractory technology,
Bill Reid reasoned, he could link his company up with bigger
companies' projects and grow.</p>
<p>Bioleaching mimics weathering, nature's own way of
oxidizing ores. Across the Nevada foothills, countless
billions of natural bacteria munch away at sulfur and iron
molecules, turning sulfide ore to oxidized ore and releasing
a rotten-egg odor. But nature takes millenniums to digest a
handful of gold ore. U.S. Gold's bioleaching plant speeds
things up by placing the bacteria in an acidic, wet
environment with plenty of oxygen. In three 600-gallon tanks,
Tonkin Springs' bugs belly up to about 3,500 tons of ore and
clean their plates in about 60 hours, U.S. Gold says.</p>
<p>As with any brand-new process, there have been plenty of
surprises. During one period, the bugs suddenly multiplied
like crazy but quit eating the iron and sulfur. After a week
of head-scratching and dozens of test-tube experiments, the
Reids discovered that a drop in the acid level had given the
bugs an appetite for different substances.</p>
<p>Operating on a tight budget, the company was once forced
to shut down the entire plant for a couple of days when a
gasket broke and a pump spewed its oil. Because it couldn't
afford an oil reserve, employee Bruce Winkelkotter had to get
up at 2 a.m. the next day and drive 12 hours to Reno and back
to get oil. "Unfortunately, we don't have the kind of
resources we need to take care of the little problems," says
David Reid. "We're having to scrounge around."</p>
<p>Such glitches, together with unworkable plant designs, bad
weather and equipment failures, increased the cost of the
experiment from the original estimate of $18 million to more
than $31 million. The cost overruns also generated some
resource-sapping litigation with the project's engineering
and construction contractors. The Reids blame the engineering
company for underestimating costs and for poor designs, and
they blame the construction managers for not catching the
problems soon enough. The two concerns say the Reids still
owe them money. The glitches also slowed production. Since
March, the bioleach process has produced 2,000 ounces of
gold, falling far short of paying the bills.</p>
<p>The deal with Homestake gives the Reids some breathing
room, but success still isn't guaranteed. If the project
fails, says David, he'll just sell his house, load up his van
and go back to prospecting. Bill's wife, Beth, has been
studying to get her nursing credentials updated, just in
case.</p>
<p>Like any seasoned gambler, Bill Reid takes the possible
loss in stride. In nearby Elko one evening, he drops dollar
tokens into the slot machines at the Red Lion Casino,
starting with $20 and building it up past $60 before he hits
a prolonged losing streak. Holding the final dollar in his
hand, he raises his eyebrows in mock fear. "Uh-oh. We've got
a liquidity crisis. It's just like U.S. Gold, isn't it?" He
drops the final coin and shrugs off the loss. "It was a lot
of fun, wasn't it?"</p>
