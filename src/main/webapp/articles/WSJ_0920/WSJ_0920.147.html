	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- The life-insurance industry is likely to get
hit with a $2 billion-a-year federal tax increase largely
because of its own overheated lobbying efforts.
   The outlook for reaching a bipartisan budget accord is
uncertain. But any tax-increase legislation this year
probably will raise the taxes of life-insurance companies by
two-thirds from the current $3 billion annually. During
recent budget talks, Democrats and Republicans agreed to
target the industry for a tax increase of $10 billion over
the next five years.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The decision is notable because the life-insurance
industry is the only one on the chopping block this year.
Most other tax increases being considered are noncorporate,
on consumers and individuals. The tax rise would be the
largest whack at a single industry since the real-estate
industry was similarly highlighted in 1986.</p>
<p>The reason for the life-insurance industry's plight is a
study in how to mishandle a lobbying campaign. Over the past
two years, the industry sharply divided itself into two
camps: the stock insurance companies and the mutual insurance
companies. Each side has complained bitterly that the other
hasn't been paying its fair share of taxes and, despite
repeated entreaties from lawmakers, they haven't been able to
agree on a solution.</p>
<p>On top of that, legislators have grown increasingly weary
-- and wary -- of the heavy-handed lobbying by both sides.
Most of the capital's tax lobbyists have hired out to one
side or another.</p>
<p>The lobbyists say they haven't overreached. But many
lawmakers feel they've being pressured everywhere they turn.
Stocks and mutuals have held separate fund-raisers for them,
have treated their staffs to exotic trips and have repeatedly
pressed their case in meetings both in Washington and in
their districts. A group of mutual lobbyists even showed up
in Barbados during a junket by the House Ways and Means
Committee.</p>
<p>Most members of Congress take lobbying in stride and even
benefit from it. But many lawmakers are tired of hearing the
blindingly arcane details of the insurance dispute. The
result has been a backlash that is likely to lead to a
massive tax increase for both sides.</p>
<p>"Did they overlobby? Absolutely," said Rep. Michael
Andrews (D., Texas), a member of the tax-writing Ways and
Means Committee. "Each side took the hardest position they
could and were unable to coalesce behind anything that was a
thoughtful approach."</p>
<p>By dividing, they were defeated, most analysts agree.
"Around here a lot of people sit down and try to work out
their differences," said Rep. Barbara Kennelly (D., Conn.),
who is also on the Ways and Means panel and an
insurance-industry advocate. "They made themselves vulnerable
by not finding a solution."</p>
<p>In the meantime, the industry is howling about being
mistreated. "America needs a reduced federal deficit, but not
at the expense of one industry and its consumers," said
Donald J. Schuenke, president and chief executive officer of
Milwaukee-based Northwestern Mutual Life Insurance Co. A 66%
increase in taxes, he added, "will force the entire
life-insurance industry to shoulder a disproportionate share
of the deficit-reduction package."</p>
<p>Individual companies would be hurt and insurance rates
would rise, executives complain. Prudential Insurance Co. of
America estimates its tax bill would go up 65% to 70%
annually, or $150 million to $170 million, if the industry's
tax bill is increased $2 billion annually. Berkshire Life
Insurance Co. in Pittsfield, Mass., estimates that had the
tax increase been in effect last year, the company would have
posted a loss of $2 million to $2.5 million, compared with
the statutory gain of $1.2 million it reported.</p>
<p>Ironically, the method of increasing the industry's taxes
was first put on the table in January as one element of a
package meant to help the mutuals. Called deferred
acquisition costs, or DACs, the provision would require
companies to write off the commissions and fees they pay to
insurance agents over several years. Currently, those costs
can be written off immediately.</p>
<p>But the budget negotiators seized on the one provision and
plan to use it to raise the taxes of both sides. So now
finally the stock and mutual insurance companies have put
aside years of bickering to work together against DACs.</p>
<p>Typically, the insurance companies are unleashing a
lobbying barrage to battle the tax rise. The agents have
taken out a newspaper advertisement. Employees and agents of
Prudential and Metropolitan Life Insurance Co. are writing
letters and telephoning lawmakers and the White House.
Prudential Chairman Robert C. Winters wrote to White House
Chief of Staff John Sununu Aug. 8. Stock and mutual lobbyists
were making rare joint visits to lawmakers' offices last
week.</p>
<p>Though not too little, it's probably too late. "We were
caught off guard," said Thomas O'Hara, the head of
Prudential's Washington office. "The industry expected a tax
increase, but not to this extent."</p>
