	<p class="article-leader">HOUSTON -- Arkla Exploration Co. said it would increase
its 1990 exploration and production capital spending budget
by 27%, to $70 million, from $55 million.
   The company said it drilled 73 new natural gas and oil
wells during the first half of 1990, and that it expects
"activity in the second half of the year to somewhat exceed
the number of new wells drilled in the first half."</p>
