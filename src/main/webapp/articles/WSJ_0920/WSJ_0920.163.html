	<p class="article-leader">TORONTO -- The Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce said it
plans to sell its British mortgage financing unit, CIBC
Mortgages.
   The Toronto-based bank said it has retained investment
firm S.G. Warburg to advise it on the sale. It also said it
has received expressions of interest from several financial
institutions in its unit's $3.83 billion mortgage loan
portfolio.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>A spokesman for the bank declined to identify those
interested parties or to say what price the bank hopes to get
for the mortgage lending concern.</p>
<p>But he said CIBC will sell the profitable unit, one of the
six largest mortgage lenders in Britain, only for "the right
price."</p>
<p>The bank decided to sell the unit "for strategic reasons,"
the spokesman said. CIBC has begun to move out of retail
banking operations abroad, focusing instead on wholesale
operations such as its corporate finance and project
financing services.</p>
<p>"We've built this up over the last four to five years,
made it profitable and decided this would be a good time to
sell," the spokesman said.</p>
<p>Analysts said CIBC is following in the footsteps of other
Canadian banks in backing away from its overseas ventures.</p>
<p>"There's been a retrenchment in recent months as the banks
realized things weren't working out in those markets the way
they'd expected them to," said Kersi Doodha, an analyst with
Maison Placements Canada Inc.</p>
<p>Mr. Doodha said CIBC is wise to sell the mortgage lending
unit while it is still profitable, pointing to rising
interest and inflation rates in Britain.</p>
<p>He said the sale of the unit would also help the bank meet
its target of reducing expenses by $130 million over the next
three years.</p>
