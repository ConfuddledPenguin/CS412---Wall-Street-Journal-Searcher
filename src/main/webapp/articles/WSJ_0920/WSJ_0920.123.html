	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Time Warner Inc. is consolidating its
publishing operations into a new unit, Time Warner
Publishing, which will include its magazine business and its
book publishing operation.
   The new entity will be run by Reginald K. Brack, who was
named chairman of Time Warner Publishing. Mr. Brack will
continue as chairman, president and chief executive of Time
Inc. Magazines Co., but will now oversee Time Inc. Book Co.
as well. Kelso Sutton, president of that unit, will now
report to Mr. Brack.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The company has been expected to consolidate some
operations to cut costs at the media giant created last year
by the merger of Time Inc. and Warner Communications Inc.
However, Mr. Brack said that while merging the two units is a
streamlining measure, it will not result in any staff
reductions and is not aimed at cutting costs. Mr. Brack will
continue reporting directly to Time Warner president Nicholas
J. Nicholas Jr.</p>
<p>Separately, Time Warner said that Peter R. Haje, a senior
corporate partner with the law firm of Paul, Weiss, Rifkind
Wharton & Garrison, will become executive vice president and
general counsel of Time Warner. Mr. Haje assumes the general
counsel's duties from Martin Payson, who will continue as
vice chairman of the company. Mr. Haje was the longtime
outside counsel to Warner Communications Inc. prior to its
merger with Time Inc.</p>
<p>Mr. Brack, who ran Time Inc. Books for a few years in the
1980s, is expected to focus in part on Time Warner's plans to
create new products drawn from both magazines and books. In
the past year, some of those products have included Sports
Illustrated for Kids Books, published by Little, Brown and
Warner Books; Warner Books paperbacks written by Time
magazine reporters; and an upcoming cookbook series from
Warner Books based on Cooking Light magazines.</p>
<p>But some analysts and industry observers were perplexed by
the decision to consolidate books and magazines, especially
since there are no savings. Jessica J. Reif, a First Boston
Corp. analyst, said "the synergy they talk about, they can do
now as separate companies, and if there are not savings, why
put it together?"</p>
<p>In an interview yesterday, Mr. Brack said the unit's first
moves would be to use an established book distribution system
in Western Europe to push subscriptions of international
editions of Time and Fortune. Mr. Brack said book
distribution could be expanded in Asia and Australia, where
Time Warner has established magazine distribution. The
company will bring together 30 million customers culled from
magazine subscribers and book club members, Mr. Brack said.</p>
<p>Mr. Brack now oversees two operations whose businesses
have been battered in a slowed-down economy. Almost all of
Time Warner's major magazines are down in advertising pages
through the first half of 1990. Although Time Warner's
Book-of-the-Month Club is the industry leader, the book club
business in the U.S. is suffering. Like other publishers,
profit margins are under pressure at the Little, Brown and
Warner Books divisions.</p>
<p>Time Inc. Magazines in 1989 had an operating profit of
$318 million on revenue of $1.9 billion. Time Inc. Books had
a loss of $23 million because of the sale of its Scott,
Foresman unit. Revenue was $1.1 billion.</p>
<p>At one point in the mid-1980s, Messrs. Sutton and Brack
were peers. But in 1986, Mr. Brack, then president of the
book company, swapped jobs with Mr. Sutton, who was then
running the magazine company.</p>
<p>Mr. Brack's track record at Time Inc. Magazines is mixed.
He dismantled the Magazine Development Group, which had
produced only expensive duds such as TVCable Week and Picture
Week, and put magazine development into the hands of editors
at established Time magazines. Sports Illustrated editors
spawned Sports Illustrated for Kids, and a Time for Kids is
under development by the staff of Time magazine. Fortune,
meanwhile, is developing a student version.</p>
<p>Mr. Brack has also successfully moved Time Warner into
joint ventures which include joint ownership in new
magazines, or investments in publications started by
entrepreneurs. Time Warner has partial ownership in Whittle
Communications L.P., Hippocrates and In Health magazines, and
Emerge magazine. It recently took over full ownership of
Parenting magazine, where it initially had a half-interest.</p>
<p>But bigger, more expensive projects -- notably the
eight-month-old Entertainment Weekly -- have had shaky
starts, and some critics question Time Warner's decision to
make such investments in the first place, considering its
merger-related debt. To date, analysts estimate Entertainment
Weekly has cost Time Warner more than $50 million. The
magazine's founding editor resigned early on, and the
publication was redesigned and redirected after early issues
turned off both readers and advertisers.</p>
