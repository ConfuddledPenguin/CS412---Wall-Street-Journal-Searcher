	<p class="article-leader">SAN FRANCISCO -- Businessland Inc., continuing to cut
costs, said it plans to lay off 10% of its work force and
merge its ComputerCraft unit into main computer-dealer
operations.
   The moves will cost about 370 people their jobs and result
in Businessland, the nation's largest computer dealer, taking
a $1 million charge against earnings in its first quarter
ending Sept. 30.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>This year, Businessland has repeatedly cut costs and
reorganized in order to stem operating losses tied to price
competition, rapid overseas expansion and poor performance of
its ComputerCraft unit. In January, the company trimmed its
work force by about 5% and since has posted losses for three
consecutive quarters.</p>
<p>The decision to fold ComputerCraft into its main
operations follows months of informal efforts by Businessland
to sell the unit, which it purchased two years ago for about
$25 million in stock. Businessland mainly sells computers
directly to large corporations through its own sales force,
while ComputerCraft -- soon to be renamed Businessland -- has
16 stores, mainly in the West, and relies heavily on walk-in
customers.</p>
<p>David Norman, Businessland's chief executive officer, said
the new arrangement will save the company money, but some
analysts said it was tantamount to discontinuing
ComputerCraft.</p>
<p>"It's a death knell," said Seymour Merrin, a
computer-dealer analyst in Palo Alto, Calif. Direct sales and
retail "are so different, there is no way to run them under
the same roof."</p>
<p>Mr. Norman said Businessland also plans to cut expenses by
eliminating its regional sales managers and reducing
inventory by roughly 20% in the current quarter.</p>
