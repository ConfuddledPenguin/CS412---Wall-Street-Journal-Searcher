	<p class="article-leader">SYDNEY, Australia -- Australian Stock Exchange officials
said News Corp. has approached them to allow the company to
issue nonvoting stock, a type of security currently
prohibited by the exchange.
   The move apparently is an attempt by media mogul Rupert
Murdoch to raise equity without diluting the 45% stake in
News Corp. that his family controls.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>A senior News Corp. official in New York declined to
comment. But for Mr. Murdoch, News Corp.'s chief executive
officer, the ability to issue such restricted-voting
securities would provide an alternative to his failed effort
last year to create a separate media vehicle to further his
international expansion. That company, named Media Partners
International Ltd. and dubbed "Son of News Corp." by Mr.
Murdoch, was to be managed and 20%-owned by News Corp.</p>
<p>But investors shunned the new venture and it was
abandoned. Meanwhile, News Corp.'s debts have spiraled. Mr.
Murdoch has been selling assets to reduce debt, and he has
taken News Corp. off the acquisition trail.</p>
<p>Issuing nonvoting stock, however, would give Mr. Murdoch
"the potential to play the same game on {News Corp.'s}
existing balance sheet," says Viktor Shvets, who tracks News
Corp. for Baring Securities (Australia) Ltd.</p>
