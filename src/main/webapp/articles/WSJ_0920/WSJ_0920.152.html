	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Large Western companies are gearing up to
invest billions of dollars in Eastern Europe over the next
five years, a new survey indicates.
   More than 30% of the corporations polled plan to spend a
total of $3.2 billion in Eastern Europe in the next five
years, according to accounting firm DRT International.
Another 33% plan investments but didn't say how much. DRT
surveyed 128 companies world-wide with assets or sales of
more than $1 billion.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Most companies planning to invest in Eastern Europe intend
to do so through joint ventures with existing Eastern
European enterprises. Export-import opportunities, which are
particularly popular among Japanese companies, came in
second.</p>
<p>In the survey, 23 European companies said they expect to
invest $1.7 billion; 13 U.S. companies, $332 million; and 12
Japanese companies, $1.1 billion.</p>
<p>Nearly all of the Western Europe respondents do business
in Eastern Europe or plan to do so in the next five years;
more than half of the North American and 63% of Japanese
companies said they expect to have a stake in Eastern Europe
in the future.</p>
