	<p class="article-leader">In his book review of "A Literary Guide to Science"
(Leisure & Arts, Aug. 17), Jim Holt writes: "A particularly
unattractive physicist named Otto Warburg accepts the status
of `honorary Aryan' from the Nazis so that he can remain in
his Berlin laboratory even though he is half Jewish."
   The Otto Warburg to whom Mr. Holt refers was of course not
a physicist but a biochemist, indeed the most notable
biochemist of his time, perhaps of any time. The body of work
for which he received a Nobel Prize includes his famous
determination of the action spectrum of the "respiratory
enzyme." This was not only a technical tour de force but also
on the purely aesthetic level one of the most beautiful
experiments of the 20th century.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Warburg is the subject of a brief, highly readable
biography "Otto Warburg: Cell Physiologist, Biochemist and
Eccentric" (Oxford University Press, 1981) by Sir Hans Krebs.
Sir Hans, himself a Nobel Prize-winning biochemist, was a
Jewish scientist forced to flee to England from the Nazi
butchers. He knew Warburg as well as anyone could claim to
know him, having worked for some years in Warburg's
institute. His criticism of certain aspects of Warburg's
personality and career is unsparing but he is also generous
in his admiration of Warburg's genius and his devotion to
science.</p>
