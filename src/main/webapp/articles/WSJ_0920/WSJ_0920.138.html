	<p class="article-leader">Home Savings Bank shareholders cleared the acquisition of
the company by H.F. Ahmanson & Co., the Los Angeles parent of
Home Savings of America.
   The companies definitively agreed on the transaction in
April; completion, which is expected by year end, is subject
to regulatory clearances. Home Savings Bank is based in
Queens, N.Y.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Under terms, Home Savings Bank holders are to receive
about $25 of Ahmanson stock for each of their shares, or
about $300 million.</p>
<p>The offer price is subject to adjustment based on
Ahmanson's stock price in the 10 trading days prior to
closing: If the figure is $24.64 or more, Home Savings Bank
holders get $28 a share; if the figure is $16.92 or less,
Home Savings Bank can decide not to complete the transaction.</p>
<p>In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday,
Ahmanson shares fell 12.5 cents to close at $15.875. In
national over-the-counter trading, Home Savings Bank shares
closed unchanged at $17.875.</p>
