	<p class="article-leader">Tokyo stocks finished lower in continuously light trading
Wednesday, with little investor participation because of
uncertainty about the direction of domestic interest rates.
   London shares ended slightly higher, up modestly from
intraday lows as a late round of bargain hunting helped boost
prices.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Tokyo stocks fluctuated mostly in tandem with futures
prices. Last-hour arbitrage selling pressured down both the
Nikkei Index and the broader-based Topix index to the lowest
closing levels this year, traders said.</p>
<p>The Nikkei Index of 225 issues fell 158.65 points, or
0.66%, to 23726.17, below the previous lowest close of
23737.63 posted Aug. 23.</p>
<p>In Tokyo Thursday, the Nikkei index retreated another
231.06 points to close the morning session at 23495.11.</p>
<p>Wednesday's volume on the first section was estimated at
about 360 million shares, down from 401 million shares
Tuesday. Decliners outnumbered advancers 565 to 358, while
170 others were unchanged.</p>
<p>The Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed in the
first section was down 16.61 points, or 0.91%, to 1799.72.</p>
<p>The second section index dropped 25.25 points, or 0.73%,
to 3449.74. The section's volume was estimated at 7 million
shares, up from 6.5 million shares Tuesday.</p>
<p>Ahead of the fiscal midyear book closing at the end of
September, participation of both brokerage houses and
institutions remained sluggish, with activities centering
mainly on profit-taking, traders said.</p>
<p>Because of thin overall volume, stock prices were swayed
by the pressure of arbitrage trading, observers said.</p>
<p>The Nikkei Index rose 247 points to its intraday high in
early trading and moved narrowly above 24000 points during
the first hour of the morning session.</p>
<p>The index then fell below Tuesday's close under pressure
of arbitrage selling that continued through the early
afternoon.</p>
<p>The index once again bounced up above 24000 points in the
last hour before dropping quickly on rounds of arbitrage
selling, which appeared to be linked to Wednesday's
expiration of the Nikkei September futures contract on the
Singapore International Monetary Exchange, traders said.</p>
<p>Concern about the impact of the volatile bond market as
well as that of rising oil prices on the Japanese economy
also prevented investors from hunting for bargains, traders
said.</p>
<p>Rumors that the Ministry of Finance spoke to the Big Four
brokerage houses Tuesday afternoon to show its concern about
the stock market's decline weren't effective in rekindling
investors' interest in buying stocks, traders said.</p>
<p>An official at Wako Securities said, "Investors aren't
interested in such lip service. The authorities won't do
anything after all." He continued: "Investors' distrust on
the stock market is really intense. It'll take a long time
for the market to regain credibility."</p>
<p>Some pharmaceutical shares ended firmer, with Sankyo up 40
yen to 2100 yen (29 cents to $15.23) and Shionogi gaining 30
yen to 1090 yen.</p>
<p>While most steel makers ended lower, Kobe Steel gained 19
yen to 535 yen, as the strong earnings outlooks for its
aluminum products attracted investors, traders said.</p>
<p>As the London market wandered in a narrow range either
side of the day-earlier close, two securities houses,
Kleinwort Benson and Shearson Lehman, said U.K. shares are
now oversold and due for a short-term bounce as market makers
find themselves short of stock.</p>
<p>However, neither the late bargain hunting nor the
brokerages' assessments are likely to have much of an effect
on the immediate direction of the market, traders said.</p>
<p>"There is no strong feeling in the market, people are just
trading on a whim and market makers are playing about with
numbers," one trader said.</p>
<p>In the U.S., a statement from Federal Reserve Chairman
Alan Greenspan that higher inflation is probable sent Wall
Street lower during the late London session, and damped the
U.K. market, traders said.</p>
<p>The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-Share Index closed
up 1.8 points at 2065.8. The day's high of 2075.9 came at the
opening of trade; the day's low was 2061.6.</p>
<p>The Financial Times 30-Share Index closed down 0.7 point
at 1576.1. Volume was 386.8 million shares, under Tuesday's
379.2 million shares.</p>
<p>Among company interim results disclosed Wednesday, Tesco,
a U.K. supermarket chain, said half-year pretax profit was
36% higher at #188 million ($359.7 million), ahead of market
forecasts. The shares ended 2 pence lower at 229 pence on the
back of profit-taking, traders said.</p>
<p>Willis Faber gained 9 pence to 210 pence after U.S.
insurance broker Corroon & Black rejected Aon Corp.'s
takeover bid, saying it will proceed with plans to merge with
Willis Faber.</p>
<p>British Telecom fell 6 pence to 270 pence after recent
downgradings from two London securities houses.</p>
<p>After a downgrading from securities house Hoare Govett
Ltd. cutting a forecast for Cable & Wireless' year-end pretax
profit to #630 million from #665 million, the shares of the
telecommunications company closed down 5 pence at 434 pence.</p>
<p>In the building sector, RMC was unchanged at 479 pence
prior to Thursday's disclosure of interim results. Traders
said the market was not optimistic following poor results
elsewhere in the sector over the past few weeks. Blue Circle,
another building-supplies company, ended a penny higher at
190 pence.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, shares closed higher in Madrid, and lower in
Paris, Frankfurt, Zurich, Brussels and Milan, flat to higher
in Stockholm, and unchanged in Amsterdam. South African gold
stocks fell.</p>
<p>Also, stocks ended lower in Sydney, Singapore, Taipei and
Hong Kong, were mixed in Wellington, and higher in Manila and
Seoul.</p>
