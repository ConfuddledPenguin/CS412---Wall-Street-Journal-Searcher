	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- Securities regulators from the U.S., Britain
and Japan agreed to pursue initiatives that will encourage
cross-border securities trading among the three largest
securities markets.
   The communique also indicates that Securities and Exchange
Commission Chairman Richard Breeden has enlisted regulators
from Britain and Japan to help promote his continuing effort
to raise margins on stock-index futures contracts.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The communique states that regulators from the three
countries agree that low margins "may affect the stability of
the securities markets, including the frequency of extreme
price movements."</p>
<p>"It is very important that this communique set forth the
views of the authorities from the U.K. and Japan," on the
issue of stock-index futures margins, Mr. Breeden said at a
news briefing held near Washington. Mr. Breeden took the
opportunity to repeat his contention that Congress should act
to raise stock-index futures margins.</p>
