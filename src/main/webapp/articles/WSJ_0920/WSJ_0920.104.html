	<p class="article-leader">Publishers of so-called integrity tests, which employers
use to help screen millions of job-seekers each year, are in
a furor over the pending release of a government study that
they fear could demolish their products.
   The study, by the congressional Office of Technology
Assessment, is expected to cast doubt on whether integrity
tests work as advertised. In other words, can they accurately
predict which employees are likely to steal or goof off on
the job?</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>A damaging report could leave droves of employers in the
lurch. An earlier report by the congressional office helped
prompt the banning of most lie-detector tests in the
workplace two years ago. Since then, a growing number of
employers have turned to the written integrity tests, which
they now administer to an estimated five million job
applicants each year.</p>
<p>The report isn't expected until next week, but publishers
of the tests have seen draft versions, and the prospect of a
negative assessment has panicked them and others who believe
the tests are a valid screening tool. Led by a coalition of
disgruntled testing firms, supporters of the exams have been
frantically goading government researchers and congressional
aides for 15 months to postpone and alter the study.</p>
<p>They've had some success. The report is a year past due
and has been rewritten dozens of times. It won't be as
damaging as some drafts suggested, say those who've seen the
final version. But it clearly won't endorse the tests, as
their publishers had hoped. So now they are intensifying
their fight, launching an angry, pre-emptive campaign to
undermine the congressional offices's credibility.</p>
<p>"There is nothing more that we can gain from a dialogue,"
says Ryan A. Kuhn, president of Reid Psychological Systems, a
Chicago test publisher.</p>
<p>Gathered in their lobbyist's Alexandria, Va., office this
week, officials of the three largest testing companies --
Reid, London House of Park Ridge, Ill., and Stanton Corp. of
Charlotte, N.C. -- cited a three-inch pile of chronologies,
charts and critiques they have gathered to use in their
campaign to show a pattern of misconduct by the congressional
office and others. They charged that the research agency has
been biased and sloppy, that it ignored conflicts of interest
among reviewers of the drafts and that its report will prove
to be unscientific and misleading.</p>
<p>"It embarrasses me as a citizen that the government is
doing such shoddy research," says John W. Jones, vice
president of research and development at London House.</p>
<p>The technology office allows that it made some mistakes
along the way and that staffing problems have plagued the
project, but denies the publishers' charges and says it has
confidence in the quality of its final report. The
congressman who requested the study, Pat Williams (D.,
Mont.), says he plans no immediate effort to introduce
legislation restricting the tests. He says that challenges to
the report are premature. "I can't presume to know how good
this study has been before it's been released," he says.</p>
<p>John Andelin, an assistant director at the technology
office who supervised the integrity test study, says the
comments on drafts that the technology office solicited from
test publishers and others have been "helpful" in improving
the reports. But he scoffed at what he calls "a lobbying
effort to kill the report."</p>
<p>Mr. Andelin adds that some reviewers say the draft reports
haven't been critical enough. "We have people who think we
are too harsh and too charitable on almost every issue," he
says.</p>
<p>The dispute has proven to be unusually heated. "I've seen
lobbying by people who are complaining about the report at a
level (of intensity) I've never seen before," says Tom
McNamara, chief of staff to Rep. Don Sundquist (R., Tenn.), a
member of the congressional board that oversees the
technology office.</p>
<p>The office had intended the study to be a modest memo that
wouldn't require the congressional approval mandated for
major studies. But a barrage of complaints from test
publishers persuaded Mr. McNamara and his counterparts to
demand regular updates on the project, including the review
of several separate drafts. Typically, even major studies get
just one formal review.</p>
<p>"It may seem trivial," Mr. McNamara says. "But we can't
just allow something that's this controversial to be moved
out and produced and given the (technology office's) stamp of
approval if it's not very well done."</p>
<p>For months, test publishers have been deluging Washington
officials with letter after letter assailing the draft
report. For instance, in a long appeal in July to Sen. Orrin
G. Hatch (R., Utah), a member of the technology office's
board, the coalition of test publishers blasted what it
called the office's "calculated attempts to produce a
document that is rife with heavy-handed political statements,
rather than limited to objective scientific issues." It added
that the technology office "is trying to point the debate in
a particular direction. That direction is clearly
anti-business."</p>
<p>At the heart of the dispute are questionnaires that are
now widely used in banks, stores and other workplaces where
concern about employee theft and dishonesty runs high. Some
employers develop their own tests, but most buy them from one
of several dozen industrial psychologists and small companies
that make up the $30 million integrity test industry. Reid,
Stanton and London House are private concerns and refuse to
divulge sales, but together they are believed to control
about 70% of the market.</p>
<p>The tests typically include questions that ask how people
feel about crime and honesty. "Do you always tell the truth?
Were you ever tempted to take company merchandise without
actually taking any? Do you think it is OK to get around the
law if you don't actually break it?" are sample questions
contained in a brochure promoting one of Reid's exams.</p>
<p>The publishers concede that the tests aren't perfect, but
say data prove that employers can benefit from using the
instruments. Reid, for instance, says studies it has
conducted show its tests can properly categorize potential
thieves and honest people an average of 85% of the time. That
means, of course, that some people may be falsely
characterized and potentially denied jobs even if they're
honest, while some potential thieves may slip through.</p>
<p>"There is error with every test," insists Reid's Mr. Kuhn.</p>
<p>Critics agree that no method is perfect, but say not
enough independent research has been done to verify the
validity claims of test publishers. They say certain test
questions are overly intrusive, and that more study is also
needed on whether the tests discriminate disproportionately
against minorities. Moreover, they charge test publishers are
overly zealous in their claims about what the tests can
accomplish, citing sales brochures that promise such results
as increased productivity, lower turnover rates and higher
profits.</p>
<p>Some also say the tests don't account for the ways in
which someone's propensity to steal might change depending on
circumstances. "Something like honesty is an attribute that
is not hard and fast," says Walter M. Haney, a senior
researcher with Boston College's Center for the Study of
Testing, Evaluation and Educational Policy. "Honest versus
dishonest behavior is affected by environment."</p>
<p>Even if the technology office's study doesn't spark
efforts in Congress to restrict integrity tests, it could
have other consequences. Massachusetts already bans the
exams, and moves to limit use of the tests on the state level
are said to be under consideration in Connecticut, Oregon and
New York. And while there have been few legal disputes over
the tests, a negative study could fuel a flood of challenges
from people who claim their job chances were unfairly
affected by the tests.</p>
<p>The report could also prompt a scramble among employers to
find alternative methods to gauge worker honesty. Already,
there has been substantial growth in the use of credit
reports, injury files, criminal records and background checks
in pre-employment screening, though there is little research
to prove the value of such means to predict worker behavior.</p>
<p>Concern may also mount about "psychological inventories,"
longer quizzes such as the popular Minnesota Multiphasic
test, that many employers use to gain a broad reading of
their workers' motivations, ambitions, skills and potential.
In many companies, even candidates for executive positions
take such tests as a condition of promotion or hire. Some of
these tests have also come under fire, but the technology
office's study isn't expected to address them.</p>
<p>However the study turns out, it won't be the last word on
integrity tests this fall. The American Psychological
Association has also been studying the topic, and expects to
unveil results and recommendations in November.</p>
