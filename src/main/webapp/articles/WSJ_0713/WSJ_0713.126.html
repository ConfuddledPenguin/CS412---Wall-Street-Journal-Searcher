	<p class="article-leader">The Army is on the verge of buying another $1.5 billion of
AH-64 Apache attack helicopters from McDonnell Douglas Corp.,
despite complaints from military personnel that the aircraft
isn't reliable, according to a congressional panel.
   In a letter dated Wednesday to Defense Secretary Dick
Cheney, Rep. John Dingell (D., Mich.), chairman of the House
subcommittee on oversight and investigations, criticized any
plans to buy more of the helicopters: "I cannot, for the life
of me, fathom the logic of such a decision."</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Mr. Dingell wrote that although the Army isn't equipped to
provide adequate maintenance support for the nearly 600
Apaches it has on hand, contracts for more AH-64s could be
signed within the next few days. The helicopters cost $14
million each, though Mr. Dingell said the firm has asked for
a large increase in price and profit in the contract talks.</p>
<p>A spokesman for McDonnell Douglas's helicopter unit
declined to comment. An Army spokeswoman also said she
couldn't comment on any correspondence to Mr. Cheney. But she
did confirm that the service recently wrapped up talks with
McDonnell Douglas for 66 AH-64s. The Pentagon wants, and
Congress has approved funding for, 132 additional Apaches,
which would mean a fleet of 807 by mid-1993.</p>
<p>Mr. Dingell reiterated a call for the talks with St.
Louis-based McDonnell Douglas to be terminated. Despite the
Army's pledge to add extra manpower and testing to each AH-64
battalion, he said, it "does not have the money" to do so.</p>
<p>The General Accounting Office, commissioned by Mr. Dingell
to research the Apache problems, has recommended that the
Army not contract for the final 132. He said in his letter
that the GAO's stance "makes even more sense" given that the
Warsaw Pact is "in total disarray."</p>
<p>Although Army Secretary Michael Stone has maintained that
substantial progess has been made in fixing the AH-64, the
subcommittee continues to cite field reports that the Apache
fails under fire. During the U.S. invasion of Panama in
December, for example, the Apache's electronic components had
to be dried in kitchen ovens after it rained, according to
evidence presented in an April panel hearing.</p>
<p>After the first day of fighting in Panama, four of the six
AH-64s sent there were grounded when three were shot up with
rifle fire. Meanwhile, the fuel cell in one Apache fizzled
out prior to the attack, and by the time a replacement
arrived, the AH-64 for which it was intended had been
cannibalized for spare parts.</p>
