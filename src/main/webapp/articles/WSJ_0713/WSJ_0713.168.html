	<p class="article-leader">LOS ANGELES -- Management Co. Entertainment Group said it
will delay a semiannual interest payment of about $1.4
million due Sunday on convertible subordinated debentures due
2009.
   The entertainment concern is currently in discussions with
G.E. Capital, a unit of General Electric Corp., about
extending and restructuring $72.5 million of bridge and
credit loans that mature tomorrow. G.E. Capital took steps to
block Management Co.'s interest payment to bondholders.</p>
