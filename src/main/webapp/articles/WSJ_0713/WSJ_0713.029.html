	<p class="article-leader">SYDNEY, Australia -- The unexpected rise in Australian
employment in June reduces the chance that monetary policy
will be eased before late August when the federal
government's budget is reported, economists say.
   But the latest labor force report notwithstanding, there
is still opportunity for a further reduction in rates this
year, they maintain.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"This {employment} number just reduces the likelihood of
an easing" in the short run. But "we still think the economy
is quite weak and we will get an ease" after the budget is
reported Aug. 21, that will take interest rates down to
around 14%, says Jeff Schubert, chief economist for HongKong
Bank of Australia Ltd. The unofficial overnight bank lending
rate is currently just under 15%.</p>
<p>The Australian Bureau of Statistics announced that the
number of persons employed in June rose 3,000 on a seasonally
adjusted basis. Market participants generally had been
looking for a decline of about 20,000, and some had expected
a greater fall. A rise in employment wasn't expected.</p>
<p>The bureau also reported that the nation's unemployment
rate rose to an adjusted 6.6% in June, in line with
expectations.</p>
