	<p class="article-leader">I noted in David Asman's June 11 editorial-page article,
"Is Mexico's New Market Economy Here to Stay?" a sentence
implying the International Monetary Fund routinely recommends
"higher taxes and severe currency devaluations," which you
term "the recessionary `shock' formula."
   Permit me to correct your misapprehensions about the role
and effect that currency devaluation and tax policies have in
the reform efforts of a country seeking to correct severe
payments imbalances.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>A country's exchange rate is its most strategic price.
When that key price gets out of line because of inflation,
imports become too cheap and exports unprofitable; the
country runs into financial difficulties as its need for
foreign currencies to pay its bills outstrips what it can
earn from exporting or what foreigners are prepared to invest
or lend. Among other dire effects, savings flee abroad
because the country's savers know the situation cannot last,
and resources vitally needed for investment are lost. This is
only one of the ways that an overvalued currency undermines a
country's economy, and why the IMF recommends devaluation
when it is needed.</p>
<p>The IMF never proposes devaluation to give a country an
artificial trade advantage, but to get the exchange rate to a
level that no longer distorts trade. Of course, devaluation
by itself does not work, and may indeed feed inflation. But
no one, certainly not the IMF, has ever suggested or
recommended devaluation alone as a remedy. On the contrary,
the IMF strongly urges that devaluation be accompanied by
budget and monetary restraint and other measures to contain
price increases.</p>
<p>A root cause of inflation and overvalued exchange rates
often is underdisciplined budget policy. A country must raise
the money it needs to pay for government services. The
decision regarding the level and scope of public services
that are provided is up to the country's government, and is a
function of the government's social and political priorities.
The IMF has no say in these matters. But to ensure an
appropriate overall fiscal balance, the IMF sometimes
supports both tax increases and tax-reform efforts. In so
doing, the IMF encourages broad-based tax systems and
discourages excessively high marginal rates that reduce work
incentives, promote tax cheating, and penalize saving and
investment. Devaluation and tax raises are not routinely
advocated by the IMF, as Mr. Asman implies. They are
recommended only where needed, and then as essential elements
of comprehensive reforms to stabilize economies and restore
growth.</p>
