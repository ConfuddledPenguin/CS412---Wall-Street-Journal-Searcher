	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- The once-solid alliance between textile and
apparel manufacturers is coming apart at the seams over
congressional legislation that would tighten restrictions on
textile imports.
   For the first time since this powerful lobbying bloc
formed in the mid-1980s, some apparel makers are breaking
with the fabric producers and siding with the U.S. retail
industry against anti-import legislation. The clothing
makers' trade group, the American Apparel Manufacturers
Association, says it isn't supporting this latest attempt to
curb imports because it prefers to see the issue resolved in
multilateral trade negotiations.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"We're in a world-wide economy that can't deal with
protectionism for textiles or any other industry," argues
Linda Wachner, president and chief executive officer of
Warnaco Inc., which makes women's wear and men's shirts.
Underscoring the split, Ms. Wachner and Harvey Falk,
president of Liz Claiborne Inc., a maker of women's apparel,
recently joined retailing executives in lobbying Senate
Majority Leader George Mitchell (D., Maine) and other
congressional leaders.</p>
<p>Daniel Frierson, chairman of the Fiber, Fabric and Apparel
Coalition for Trade, which represents textile manufacturers,
cotton and wool producers, labor unions, and others, concedes
that his group is missing the support of some of the big,
import-dependent apparel makers. But he insists that the bill
still is backed by a majority of the group's members, which
produce mostly for the domestic market.</p>
<p>The Senate is tentatively scheduled to debate the bill
this week or early next week. The bill would effectively
scrap the bilateral textile and apparel accords that the U.S.
has negotiated with 38 exporting countries and replace them
with a more restrictive system of global quotas for all
imports except from Canada and Israel. The congressional
textile caucus has amassed a predictably large number of
co-sponsors for the bill -- 55 in the Senate and 244 in the
House -- so its passage is all but assured.</p>
<p>So is its eventual veto by President Bush, but that
doesn't really concern the bill's backers. Vetoes of textile
bills are familiar in Washington; President Reagan did it
twice. The bill's real purpose appears to be to pressure U.S.
Trade Representative Carla Hills against making concessions
on textiles and apparel in the current "Uruguay Round" of
multilateral trade talks held under the auspices of the
General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.</p>
<p>The textile crowd is worried that Ms. Hills will cave in
to the demands of Hong Kong, South Korea, Thailand and others
to rapidly phase out the current system of bilateral import
quotas. Those countries are in a strong bargaining position
because the U.S. needs their votes on other issues being
negotiated in this round of GATT talks.</p>
<p>Yet, looking back home, Ms. Hills doesn't see Americans
standing shoulder-to-shoulder on the issue. The difference is
that the world is starting to look different to apparel
houses. "The apparel industry has become globalized as never
before. Cost is just part of it. They're also going offshore
for variety and quality," says Joseph Scheines, a spokesman
for Kurt Salmon Associates Inc., a New York consulting firm
specializing in the textile trade.</p>
<p>A waning of enthusiasm for the textile mills' legislative
strategy was evident in last spring's AAMA convention in
Naples, Fla. There was a roar of applause when retailing
executive Leslie Wexner, chairman of Limited Inc., twitted
Roger Milliken, one of the most hawkish coalition leaders,
for urging stiff restrictions on imported textiles and
apparel while insisting on being free to buy his own textile
machinery anywhere in the world.</p>
<p>In response, Mr. Milliken, chairman of Milliken & Co.,
says the mills have to purchase certain spinning and weaving
machines overseas because foreign competition has forced U.S.
machinery makers out of those lines. "We don't want to see
the same thing happen to textiles," he argues.</p>
<p>Apparel makers note that they can offer the same argument:
They can't always get what they want in the U.S., either.</p>
