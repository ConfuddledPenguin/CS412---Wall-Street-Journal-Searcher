	<p class="article-leader">Your May 22 editorial "Besieged Incumbents" contained a
misleading piece about Rep. Jack Murtha, Democrat of
Pennsylvania. While technically correct that Mr. Murtha got
only 51% of the votes cast in a three-man race, he handily
defeated his nearest opponent 29,239 to 24,530 -- a
comfortable margin. It was closer than it should have been,
but it was not close. Robert Burkley got only 43%, and an 8%
margin in a presidential election would be considered a
landslide.
   The Johnstown, Pa., newspaper's new editor, while a friend
and a man I admire, was wrong throughout the primary campaign
in his perception of Mr. Murtha and what he has done for his
district. The congressman's contributions to his district are
and have been enormous.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>While the newspaper in the end did endorse Mr. Murtha,
that was too late to help much -- the damage had been done.</p>
<p>As a Republican, I suggest our district is indeed
fortunate to have a man of Jack Murtha's quality to represent
us. There are none in Congress better informed on the Defense
Department; the nation is well served to have this winner of
the Purple Heart -- with two volunteer combat tours as a
Marine in Vietnam as well as his Korean War service -- as
chairman of the Subcommittee on Defense Appropriations.</p>
