	<p class="article-leader">WORCESTER, Mass. -- Peoples Bancorp of Worcester Inc.,
which has avoided the real estate loan problems plaguing
other New England savings banks, expects to report that net
income rose 12% in the second quarter over income before
investment gains in the year-ago period.
   Woodbury C. Titcomb, president and chief executive, said
in an interview that second-quarter net income was about $1.3
million, or 48 cents a share, up from income before
investment gains of $1.2 million, or 43 cents a share, a year
earlier.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>In the 1989 second quarter, investment income of eight
cents a share brought net income to $1.5 million, or 51 cents
a share. There was no investment income in the latest
quarter.</p>
<p>For the year, Peoples expects earnings to be in line with
analysts' estimates, showing an increase of 8% to about $2.05
a share from $1.90 a share in 1989, according to Michael S.
Shaw, the bank's senior vice president and treasurer.</p>
<p>Mr. Titcomb said Peoples, the holding company for Peoples
Savings Bank of Worcester, was expecting to "grow through
acquisitions" over the next several years, continuing its
current program of "careful purchases."</p>
<p>On July 9, Peoples paid the Federal Deposit Insurance
Corp. a premium of $100,000 to assume $300 million of
deposits of Milford Savings Bank, a Milford, Mass.based
savings bank that was closed a few days earlier by federal
regulators. Under an agreement with the FDIC, Peoples will
review Milford's $280 million loan portfolio and has the
option to purchase loans it deems worthy.</p>
<p>The Milford purchase was the second acquisition of a
troubled institution by Peoples. In April 1989, Peoples paid
$3 million for $301.7 million of assets of First Service Bank
for Savings of Leominster, Mass., in an FDIC auction.</p>
<p>"Future acquisitions and consolidations is the way to go,"
said Mr. Titcomb, "providing they can be controlled,
disciplined and significantly accretive."</p>
<p>Mr. Titcomb said Peoples is in a position to make
acquisitions because of the prudent lending policies it
followed during the mid-1980s. While other New England
savings banks, many of which went public in 1986, were
lending freely, "there was an awful lot of criticism of
Peoples not growing, not lending," said Mr. Titcomb. But
other lenders are finding many loans made during periods of
swift growth are now nonperforming.</p>
<p>Peoples' nonperforming loans are among the lowest in the
region. Although its non-performers are rising slightly, they
will be less than 1% of total loans at the end of the second
quarter compared with 0.35% at the end of 1989.</p>
<p>The bank will add $120,000 to loan-loss reserves, the
regular quarterly provision it has been making since 1988,
bringing reserves up to $4.6 million. That will cover nearly
100% of its non-performing loans, a higher percentage than
most banks. Of the bank's total loans of $510 million, 54% of
them are in residential mortgages, 24% in home equity loans
-- the portfolio's fastest growing area -- and 13% in
commercial real estate or construction. Nearly all the loans
are in Worcester County.</p>
<p>The bank's equity-to-assets ratio was 9.4% at June 30, and
is expected to settle at 8% after repayment of about $70
million in brokered deposits from Milford Savings over the
next 45 days. Peoples expects to keep about $130 million of
Milford's $300 million in deposits, bringing Peoples' total
assets to $900 million by year end.</p>
<p>Return on assets is expected to be 0.69% for first six
months of 1990 compared with 0.70% for all of 1989. Return on
equity is expected to be 7.1% for first six months of the
year compared with 8% for the like year-earlier period.</p>
<p>The company, which has raised its dividend for each of the
14 quarters since going public, "will try to find a way to
keep it rising," said Mr. Titcomb.</p>
