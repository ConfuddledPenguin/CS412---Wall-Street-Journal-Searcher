individual accounts, rebounded sharply, more than making up
the losses of the preceding week," said Jacob Dreyer, vice
president and chief economist at the institute. Money-fund
assets were revised for the previous week to $382.73 billion.
The reported decrease in assets of $2.24 billion was revised
