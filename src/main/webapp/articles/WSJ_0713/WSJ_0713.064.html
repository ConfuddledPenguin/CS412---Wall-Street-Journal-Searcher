	<p class="article-leader">PITTSBURGH -- U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Joseph L. Cosetti
effectively ended Allegheny International Inc.'s bitter and
combative two-year bankruptcy case by confirming the
company's reorganization plan.
   The plan, approved by the judge yesterday, calls for the
maker of Sunbeam and Oster products to pay creditors holding
about $711 million in claims newly issued common stock valued
at about $7 a share. The confirmation represents a final
chapter in a tortured reorganization that has seen nine
previous company plans beaten down by various dissatisfied
creditor and shareholder groups.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>But, in a bizarre twist, arch-rival Japonica Partners
could end up running Allegheny. The partners, who had a
competing reorganization plan, were given 45 days by Judge
Cosetti to produce an estimated $130 million to $150 million
in financing to buy the stock they don't already own.</p>
<p>The partners, two former Goldman, Sachs & Co. merger
specialists, spent recent months buying enough claims to
effectively give it 50% of Allegheny in an unsuccessful
effort to block the company's plan and have its own
confirmed.</p>
<p>The judge, who reprimanded Japonica for having "abused and
manipulated" the bankruptcy process, issued an ultimatum,
ordering Japonica to buy the remaining stock at $7 a share
and warrants at $1.53 a warrant. If Japonica can't come up
with the financing within the stipulated 45 days, the
partners' 50% stake will be put in a non-voting trust for
three years. That, in effect, would prohibit Japonica from
trying to take over the company's board and management. In
the meantime, the judge said Japonica would still benefit
from dividends and proceeds of asset sales.</p>
<p>One question mark, though, is whether Japonica will
appeal. Japonica officials said they were "reviewing the
opinion" and had no immediate comment. If Japonica does
appeal it's not clear whether Allegheny's bankers will be
willing to finance the plan with litigation pending.</p>
<p>One way to avoid an appeal, which would prolong an already
belabored case, is for Japonica to strike an agreement with
the banks and unsecured creditors. Indeed, Japonica has
apparently been trying to reach an accord that would pay
those groups slightly less than $7 a share for stock and
$1.53 for warrants, in exchange for forgoing a costly and
lengthy appeal. The partners have apparently received an
additional $97 million to buy the shares.</p>
<p>Robert Sable, an attorney representing the unsecured
creditors, says he expects an appeal. "I have to say it's
likely," he said. Noting that the case is littered with
dashed agreements, he said, "you can't guarantee that
Japonica can strike a deal."</p>
<p>In the past two years, Allegheny has seen nine
reorganization plans fizzle and a half dozen prospective
buyers come and go, including one investment bank three
times. Creditor groups have sued each other, making the
reorganization even more contentious.</p>
<p>The process became even more embattled when Japonica
offered its own cash reorganization plan earlier this year.
After buying up a majority of the company's claims, the group
insisted last month that one partner be named chairman of
Allegheny's board and that Allegheny's management team
resign. Meanwhile, Allegheny kicked Japonica out of its
offices where the group had been studying the company's
books.</p>
<p>In confirming the company's plan, the judge ruled that
Japonica had bought its claims in bad faith, trying to
conduct an "end run" around the bankruptcy process.</p>
