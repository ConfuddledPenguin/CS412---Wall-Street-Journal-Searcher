	<p class="article-leader">LONDON -- Britain's trade and industry secretary Nicholas
Ridley stirred a political whirlwind with a strident attack
on the European Community Commission and West Germany.
   The close political ally of Prime Minister Margaret
Thatcher said in an interview with the Spectator magazine:</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>-- Plans for European monetary union are "all a German
racket designed to take over the whole of Europe. It has to
be thwarted. This rushed takeover by the Germans on the worst
possible basis, with the French behaving like poodles to the
Germans, is absolutely intolerable." Germany, he said in the
Spectator interview, is becoming "uppity" and is "already
running most of the {European} Community."</p>
<p>-- The EC Commission in Brussels consists of "17 unelected
reject politicians with no accountability to anybody, . . .
who are pandered to by a supine parliament. . . . I'm not
against giving up sovereignty {to the EC} in principle, but
not to this lot. You might just as well give it to Adolf
Hitler, frankly."</p>
<p>-- West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl will "soon be trying
to take over everything." And Bundesbank President Karl Otto
Poehl could cause "a bloody revolution" if he's allowed to
influence U.K. monetary policy. The British people "can be
dared; they can be moved. But being bossed by a German -- it
would cause absolute mayhem in this country, and rightly, I
think."</p>
<p>For months, Mrs. Thatcher and her cabinet colleagues have
been struggling to stifle speculation that they hold exactly
such outlandish views. While urging caution about proposals
for political union, they have been proclaiming themselves
committed Europeans who soon would take the next big step
toward economic union: linking the pound fully to other EC
currencies in the European Monetary System.</p>
<p>Mr. Ridley's comments -- though quickly repudiated by Mrs.
Thatcher and retracted by the abashed minister -- undercut
all that careful diplomacy. On world currency markets, the
pound dived. In Strasbourg, seat of the European Parliament,
Euro-politicians took turns bashing Mr. Ridley and demanding
his resignation.</p>
<p>"Outrageous and deeply offensive," huffed Bruce Millan, an
EC commissioner.</p>
<p>In Germany, the Bundesbank's Mr. Poehl icily called Mr.
Ridley's views "not appropriate for a cabinet minister of a
country of the EC."</p>
<p>Mrs. Thatcher was forced to spank her aide in public.</p>
<p>To a packed House of Commons, the prime minister announced
that "my right honorable friend has expressed his very great
regrets and unreservedly withdraws his remarks." Opposition
Labour Party politicians jeered and shouted uproariously.
Mrs. Thatcher said Mr. Ridley's comments don't "represent the
government's views, nor my own views."</p>
<p>Rumors flew that Mrs. Thatcher soon would expell Mr.
Ridley from her cabinet. But in perhaps the strangest
development of the day, a phalanx of Ridley supporters in the
Tory Party rallied to his defense.</p>
<p>"Nick Ridley's a valuable man," said Kenneth Warren, a
prominent Tory and chairman of the House of Commons trade and
industry committee. "I don't think you should get rid of
somebody because he's a free thinker and ready to speak his
mind in an open democracy."</p>
<p>Mr. Ridley's outburst struck a sympathetic chord in many
Tory breasts. Though the minister's language was "over the
top," said Jonathan Aitken, another Conservative member of
Parliament, "he does represent a significant segment of
public opinion in both the House of Commons and the country."</p>
<p>Opinion polls show a small core of Tory loyalists loathes
Brussels. And many Britons are uneasy about Germany's growing
might. A poll conducted last April by Market & Opinion
Research International Ltd. found 50% of Britons worried
about a unified Germany becoming a dominant power in Europe.
Of those, 53% feared a return to Nazism or fascism.</p>
<p>After nine years in the Thatcher cabinet, Mr. Ridley is a
veteran of rows over his words. As environment secretary from
1986 to 1989, the chain-smoking politician dismissed some
environmentalists' views as "unscientific rubbish based on
myths, prejudices and ignorance." He made many political
enemies as an architect of the controversial British "poll
tax," instituted this year. And he even managed to rile
supporters of public footpaths -- a near-sacrosanct
institution in Britain, giving nature buffs rights to wander
over private land -- by ordering one footpath re-routed to
make room for an extension of his own house.</p>
<p>"An environmental Genghis Khan," was the judgment of one
environmental group. As trade and industry secretary, he has
tried to keep a lower profile -- with little success. He
attacked the "open and covert subsidies" of other EC
countries, while defending a government decision to grant
concessions to British Aerospace PLC in its purchase of Rover
Group Ltd.</p>
<p>Mr. Ridley's embarrassment was undoubtedly heightened by
the Spectator's handling of the interview. The magazine ran a
cover cartoon, depicting Mr. Ridley painting a Hitler-like
moustache and forelock over a poster of Mr. Kohl. "Saying the
Unsayable about the Germans," was the Spectator's headline.</p>
