	<p class="article-leader">Social Security seems like a black hole to many working
Americans. It claims as much as 7.7% of their salaries. Yet
they fear they won't get much back come retirement.
   Compounding the unease: Many people hear nary a word from
the government program in the decades between signing up for
a Social Security number and applying for their benefits.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>But Social Security is too important to ignore. Working
people can and should bridge the gap of silence -- to get
benefits estimates that can help in planning for retirement
and evaluating insurance needs, and to ensure that they
ultimately get every penny for which they're eligible.</p>
<p>The Social Security Administration recommends that people
check the agency's records of their earnings every three
years or so. Omissions "aren't common, but when they happen
they can be a nightmare," a spokesman says.</p>
<p>John Rother, director of legislation and public policy for
the American Association of Retired Persons, learned
first-hand the value of checking Social Security's records.
He requested his information a few years back just to see
what AARP members could expect. What he found was a two-year
gap when his earnings as a Senate staffer weren't recorded at
all.</p>
<p>Such gaps could saddle a person with a lower retirement
benefit than deserved because of the way Social Security
benefits are calculated. They're based on people's average
earnings in their 35 highest-paid years, translating all
figures into today's dollars. People could be penalized, for
example, if some high earnings at the peak of their careers
are omitted and replaced in the calculation by zeros or by
pay from years when they were just starting out.</p>
<p>Less than 1% of eligible wages aren't credited to people's
records, the Social Security Administration says. And
correcting an error is fairly easy if a person knows it
exists: Just contact Social Security with W-2 forms or other
records that verify wages and Social Security taxes for the
period in question. Unfortunately, many don't discover
omissions until retirement age, if at all.</p>
<p>Back in 1987, the General Accounting Office reported that
$58.5 billion in earnings between 1978 and 1984 apparently
had been left off people's Social Security records. Those
were wages that employers had reported to the Internal
Revenue Service, but not to Social Security.</p>
<p>A stepped-up effort by the Social Security Administration
to resolve such discrepancies has resulted in $36 billion of
those earnings being credited to people's records. But the
agency spokesman says the remainder hasn't been credited, in
many cases because Social Security couldn't find the
individual or the company involved.</p>
<p>Finding out about what's in your Social Security earnings
record is easy. Stop by a Social Security office or call
toll-free (800/234-5SSA) to get a request form for a free
Personal Earnings and Benefit Estimate Statement (Pebes).
Answer a few questions on the form, mail it in, and get the
Pebes in about four weeks.</p>
<p>That same statement also contains benefits estimates,
including those that would be paid if a person dies or
becomes disabled. Those figures are important in evaluating
life insurance and disability insurance needs.</p>
<p>"Social Security isn't just a retirement program. You're
buying enormous lifetime protection," says Judy Schub, a
lobbyist for the AARP.</p>
<p>Still, the estimates of retirement benefits may be the
most valuable part of the Pebes statement for people starting
to think about leaving the work force. That's a new feature
Social Security added about two years ago.</p>
<p>The statement shows the benefits that people might expect,
expressed in today's dollars, if they retire at three
different ages. People can look at those figures as a
percentage of their current salary to get a sense of how much
of their working income Social Security might replace.</p>
<p>One message that is likely to come through very clearly is
that Social Security alone is far from enough.</p>
<p>The government program will generally replace about 60% of
earnings for a worker who has always earned the minimum wage,
but only about 28% for someone who has always earned the
maximum pay covered by Social Security -- currently $51,300.
The percentage is even lower for people earning more.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, a rule of thumb is that retirees, to be
comfortable, need income equal to 70% of their final pay.
Some will need less. But others will require 100% of their
working income in the early years of retirement, at least if
they want to reach goals such as traveling a lot or
maintaining two homes, says Cleveland financial planner Karen
Spero.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that the benefit figures in the Pebes are
only estimates. "The closer a person is to retirement, the
more accurate those estimates will be," says Malcolm A.
Makin, a Westerly, R.I., planner. The actual payouts will
depend on people's earnings between now and retirement and,
of course, on any changes in Social Security's benefit
formulas.</p>
<p>It's also important to understand some of the assumptions
that underlie the figures. For instance, when Social Security
projects a person's benefit at age 62, age 65 and age 70, the
agency is assuming that the person keeps working to those
ages -- not that he or she would quit earlier and delay
collecting benefits.</p>
<p>Even people who don't ask for Pebes reports may eventually
find something like them in their mailboxes. A law passed
last year requires the Social Security Administration by the
year 2000 to send people their earnings records and in some
cases benefits estimates every other year.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, getting a Pebes report may give some people a
needed push to start retirement planning.</p>
<p>People should begin to analyze their finances 10 to 15
years before they expect to retire, advises Dallas Salisbury,
president of the Employee Benefit Research Institute in
Washington.</p>
<p>But when do they really do it? "Eighteen to 36 months
before they plan to retire, if they are really behaved," Mr.
Salisbury says. "And right after retirement if they are
typical."</p>
