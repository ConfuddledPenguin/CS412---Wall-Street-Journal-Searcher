	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- The dollar dropped against all other major
currencies after U.S. Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan
Greenspan said the Fed stands ready to ease monetary policy
if market conditions warrant.
   "The dollar was absolutely crushed" by the comment, said
Charles Lieberman, an economist at Manufacturers Hanover
Trust Co. in New York. Cynthia Johnson, vice president and
corporate manager at Lloyds Bank in New York, called trading
"very, very active."</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The dollar, which was higher Wednesday, held most of those
gains in Asian and European trading, as those markets closed
before Mr. Greenspan addressed the Senate Banking Commitee in
Washington.</p>
<p>He told the senators there is "some evidence" that banks
in the U.S. are keeping credit tighter than the Fed expected
and that the U.S. central bank might therefore have to
consider bringing down its interest rates.</p>
<p>"The initial shock of the statement," said Jack Stapleton,
chief corporate dealer at Standard Chartered Bank PLC in New
York, "scared everyone into oblivion." Falling U.S. interest
rates could prompt some conversion of funds from dollars into
higher-yielding currencies.</p>
<p>The dollar reached its intraday lows 25 to 30 minutes
after the Greenspan statement, sinking as far as 1.6310 marks
and 146.75 yen from 1.6609 marks and 148.80 yen about an hour
earlier. At the same time, the British pound strengthened to
an intraday high of $1.8180 from $1.7885.</p>
<p>Late in the New York trading day, the dollar was quoted at
1.6340 marks, down from 1.6560 marks late Wednesday. The U.S.
currency was also changing hands at 147.30 yen, down from
148.50 yen a day earlier. Sterling was trading at $1.8133, up
from $1.7990.</p>
<p>In Tokyo Friday, the dollar was trading at 147.35 yen soon
after the opening, down from Thursday's Tokyo close of 148.90
yen. Meanwhile, the U.S. currency was trading at 1.6383
marks, down from Thursday's Tokyo close of 1.6568 marks.</p>
<p>Currency traders have been saying for months that easier
U.S. credit was coming, but hearing it from Mr. Greenspan
triggered rapid selling of dollars. "He said the `E' word,"
said David Gilmore, a foreign exchange analyst for McCarthy,
Crisanti & Maffei in New York. By "`E' word," Mr. Gilmore
meant easing of credit.</p>
<p>Still, traders said the fall in the dollar doesn't
necessarily mean any erosion of confidence in the strength of
the U.S. economy. "It's not a confidence question,"
Manufacturers Hanover's Mr. Lieberman said. "It's a question
of portfolio managers taking advantage of yield
differentials" in seeking out higher interest rates.</p>
<p>Mr. Greenspan's comments helped the pound recover losses
it had in European trading. Sterling reached its intraday low
of $1.7755 soon after the beginning of London trading.</p>
<p>Along with a growing expectation that Britain's high
interest rates will soon decline, the currency's fall was
attributed to comments by Nicholas Ridley, Britain's trade
and industry secretary. Mr. Ridley was highly critical of
West Germany, France and the European Community Commission in
an interview published in the conservative U.K. weekly
magazine The Spectator.</p>
<p>Mr. Ridley retracted his comments and issued an apology,
but the pound was sold amid speculation that the comments
reflected the thinking of Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher
and that she might seek to delay sterling's entry into the
exchange-rate mechanism of the European Monetary System.</p>
<p>In answer to a question in the House of Commons, however,
Mrs. Thatcher said she doesn't share Mr. Ridley's views on
Europe and denied that he was speaking for the government.</p>
<p>On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for current
delivery rose $4 to $358.10 an ounce. Estimated volume was a
moderate 4.2 million ounces.</p>
<p>In early trading in Hong Kong Friday, gold was quoted at
$357.55 an ounce.</p>
