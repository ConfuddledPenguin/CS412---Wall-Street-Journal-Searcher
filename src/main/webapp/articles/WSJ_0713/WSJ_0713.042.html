	<p class="article-leader">TACOMA, Wash. -- Every action epic has a sequel these
days, so it should be no surprise that the Air Force is
producing "Panama II."
   Military officials at McChord AFB here thought they had a
swell idea to help celebrate the military airfield's 50th
anniversary. "The most spectacular event scheduled,"
trumpeted a McChord news release last month, "will be a joint
services re-enactment of the invasion of Panama. The actual
aircraft, aircrews and soldiers who were there
participating]"</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>But as with the original, there have been problems with
the sequel.</p>
<p>Local newspapers began calling the exercise, scheduled for
this Sunday, a "pseudo invasion." And there were also some
troublesome details: Who would play Gen. Manuel Noriega? How
would several hundred Panamanians be tastefully done away
with?</p>
<p>To simplify matters, Air Force officials decided to leave
Panamanians out of the new invasion altogether, and McChord's
public-relations staff was ordered to stop mentioning the
original locale.</p>
<p>"Our guys will parachute in, deploy on the ground and then
walk into the crowd and shake a few hands," says Maj. Morris
Bedard, the Air Force impresario who dreamed up the concept
of a second Panamanian go-around. "They're calling me Cecil
B. de Mille the second," he boasts. The idea behind the
concept: "To let the taxpayers see what it is that we do
around here."</p>
<p>With or without Gen. Noriega and his countrymen, the
re-enactment will have plenty of action. Hundreds of
paratroopers will drop onto the base runway in front of
thousands of expected onlookers. "The real spectacular part
will be the strafing runs by the fighter planes," Maj. Bedard
says. The planes are scheduled to swoop in over the crowd and
blast away at the nonexistent Panamanian enemy.</p>
<p>Reminded that when the Air Force dispatched a Stealth
fighter to Panama to do just that during the real thing, the
plane missed its target, Maj. Bedard says: "We won't have any
Stealths." Besides, he says, the fighters will be shooting
blanks.</p>
<p>Without ammunition, a location or half the original cast,
can the Air Force's sequel live up to the original? Maj.
Bedard dismisses the question with a de Mille-like shrug. "I
wasn't there," he says. "I came up with the concept. It was
up to the flyboys to restage the thing right."</p>
