	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- State Attorney Gen. Robert Abrams denounced a
proposed rate increase of about $1.4 billion being sought by
Nynex Corp.'s New York Telephone Co. unit, urging that Nynex
cut waste and eliminate "its unconscionable business
practices" instead of seeking "a bailout from ratepayers."
   At a news conference yesterday, Mr. Abrams said the
average consumer's monthly bill would go up about 36% if the
request were granted. He also said Nynex officials have
"resisted us every inch of the way" as his office has tried
to gather information about New York Telephone's allegedly
improper dealings with the parent company's purchasing arm,
Materiel Enterprises Co.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Those dealings and other questionable Nynex activities
were the subject of an article yesterday in this newspaper.</p>
<p>Describing the investigation and review process in
connection with the rate case, Mr. Abrams said Nynex has
suppressed as "trade secrets" many facts that the company
"would find embarrassing if the public knew."</p>
<p>In White Plains, N.Y., Nynex criticized Mr. Abrams for
making what it characterized as "wrong and disingenuous"
allegations.</p>
<p>In a statement, Nynex didn't say which specific
allegations made by Mr. Abrams it considers to be inaccurate
or disingenuous. But the company said the charges by Mr.
Abrams that it disputes pertain to "the business practices of
Nynex companies and their impact on the people of New York."</p>
