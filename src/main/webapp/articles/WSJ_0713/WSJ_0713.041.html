	<p class="article-leader">The gap between the haves and the have-nots continues to
widen in the computer industry.
   Analysts say results for the June quarter will provide
fresh evidence that companies making desktop computers are
prospering while makers of traditional machines, such as
mainframes and minicomputers, are posting smaller gains or
even losing business.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Consider the contrast between Digital Equipment Corp. and
Sun Microsystems Inc. Digital, once a high-flier and a Wall
Street darling, is expected to post a 50% earnings drop for
its fiscal fourth quarter ended June 30. Analysts, meantime,
expect Sun to show a profit of as much as $47 million for its
fiscal fourth quarter, compared to a year-earlier loss.</p>
<p>The key difference: Sun sells desktop workstations and
networking computers; Digital still depends heavily on
expensive minicomputers. "DEC isn't competitive on the
desktop," where the growth and profits are, says analyst
Robert Herwick at Hambrecht & Quist. "DEC is just not there,
whereas Sun is very much there."</p>
<p>The story holds true among other makers of desktop
machines, both workstations and personal computers. Analyst
Michelle Preston of Cowen & Co. estimates that Apple Computer
Inc.'s net income in its fiscal third quarter ended June 30
rose more than 15% to $114 million, or 90 cents a share, and
that revenue increased 10% to $1.4 billion. Compaq Computer
Corp.'s profit for the June quarter, she predicts, grew 21%
to $102 million, or $2.30 a share, on a 28% rise in revenue
to $926 million.</p>
<p>Sun's expected healthy gains apparently confirm its
rebound from last year's painful manufacturing and
product-transition snafus. Peter Rogers, an analyst at
Robertson Stephens & Co., estimates that Sun will earn $47
million, or 50 cents a share, on revenue of $700 million. In
the year-ago period, Sun had a loss of $20.3 million on sales
of $431 million.</p>
<p>Sun's rebound was fueled by improved operations and new
computers that are eating away at the competition in the
burgeoning market for workstations, machines used by
engineers and scientists. "Sun finds itself in a very strong
leadership position in the workstation market despite
everybody else all taking their best shots," says Mr.
Herwick, the Hambrecht & Quist analyst.</p>
<p>Growth comes harder for computer companies that depend on
sales of more expensive machines. International Business
Machines Corp., for instance, is the largest maker of
personal computers but because it relies heavily on sales of
larger computers it is expected to show slowing growth.
Analyst Daniel Benton of Goldman, Sachs & Co. estimates that
Big Blue's second-quarter revenue grew only 6% to $16.2
billion. Net income is expected to be down 7% to $1.3
billion, or $2.20 a share, he said.</p>
<p>The earnings picture is even more dismal for Unisys Corp.,
which depends more heavily on sales of expensive computers
than IBM. Mr. Benton estimates that Unisys will break even
for the quarter on slightly lower revenue, which he expects
to total $2.5 billion. "The picture is scary," said Mr.
Benton. "Unisys isn't showing any signs of rebound."</p>
<p>Unisys earned $27 million in the year-ago period and Mr.
Benton believes it's possible the firm lost money in this
year's June quarter, its second of the fiscal year. "We may
see another restructuring of (the company) before year end,"
he said.</p>
<p>In addition to its poor showing in the desktop market,
Digital was hurt by production glitches in its VAX-9000
minicomputers, says analyst Barry Willman of Sanford C.
Bernstein & Co. He estimates Digital earned about $155
million, or $1.25 a share, in the June quarter, down from
$313.2 million, or $2.51 a share, last year. Mr. Willman
estimated revenue at about $3.4 billion, down from $3.49
billion.</p>
<p>Not all makers of more expensive machines will be hurting.
Companies such as Sequent Computer Systems Inc., Tandem
Computers Inc. and Pyramid Technology Corp. are expected to
benefit from a move by banks, financial institutions and
other computer users toward on-line processing systems. Those
systems perform such tasks as credit-card verifications and
run automated teller machines.</p>
<p>Tandem's net income should rise about 55% in the fiscal
third quarter ended June 30 to $48 million, or 43 cents a
share, from $30.8 million a year ago, or 31 cents a share,
estimates analyst John Jones of Montgomery Securities.
Revenue will grow 24% to $520 million in the quarter, he
says.</p>
<p>Hambrecht & Quist expects Sequent's net income in the
period to rise 56% to $5.4 million, or 23 cents a share, on
revenue of about $54 million, up 73% from the year-ago
period.</p>
