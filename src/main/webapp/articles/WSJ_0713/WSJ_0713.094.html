	<p class="article-leader">SAN FRANCISCO -- Potlatch Corp. said second-quarter net
earnings rose 26% on an 8% growth in revenue.
   The forest-products company said net earnings were $32.3
million, or $1.12 a share, compared with $25.7 million, or 89
cents a share, a year earlier. Sales rose to $321.2 million
from $296.1 million, the company said.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Potlatch attributed the increased income to a rescheduling
of annual maintenance shutdowns from the first half to the
last half of this year at two of the company's pulp-based
operations.</p>
<p>Potlatch's wood-products group reported earnings for the
quarter of $800,000, compared with a loss of $2 million in
1989, the company said. The Northwest Paper division reported
earnings of $18.4 million, down from $20.4 million in 1989
because of higher costs, some related to new equipment, and
to softer-than-expected markets, Potlatch said.</p>
<p>Net earnings for Potlatch's other pulp businesses grew to
$43.9 million, from $31.4 million in 1989, the company said.
Excellent results from the consumer products division also
contributed to higher earnings, but results were hampered by
operating problems at Potlatch's Lewiston, Idaho, mill, it
said.</p>
<p>Potlatch said it expected second-half results to be hurt
by a maintenance shutdown scheduled at its Cypress Bend,
Ark., mill and an extended shutdown at its Lewiston mill.</p>
<p>Potlatch's stock closed at $40.625, up 25 cents, in
composite trading yesterday on the New York Stock Exchange.</p>
