	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Will media baron Rupert Murdoch tell all,
joining the list of moguls publishing their memoirs? The odds
look good.
   The chairman of media giant News Corp. is considering
writing an autobiography, according to his public relations
adviser in New York, Howard Rubenstein. "He may or may not do
a book, but he's certainly considering it," Mr. Rubenstein
said. He said Mr. Murdoch is working with senior editor Peter
Brimelow of Forbes, but he has "no advance and no contract."
Mr. Rubenstein quoted Mr. Murdoch as saying that if he does
such a book, he may do it with British publisher Weidenfeld &
Nicholson.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Although News Corp. owns a very large book publisher,
Harper-Collins Publishers, with operations in both the U.S.
and the United Kingdom, "an independent source suggested he
should have it (his autobiography) published elsewhere," Mr.
Rubenstein said.</p>
<p>The reasons for a Murdoch autobiography have "nothing to
do with money or vanity," said Mr. Rubenstein. "There are
many things that have been published about him that are
highly inaccurate. This would be a way to straighten out some
of the incorrect things that have been written."</p>
