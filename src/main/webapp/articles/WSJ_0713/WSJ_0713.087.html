	<p class="article-leader">How many NASA engineers does it take to screw in a light
bulb? Answer: No one knows, but we'll have to spend $400
billion and travel to Mars to find out.
   If that's not funny, neither is much else around America's
once-great space agency these days. The Hubble telescope's
problems and the space shuttle's recent ground have given
everyone a chance to fret about American technology and
"decline." Don't believe it. The real story is how an agency
that once produced the right stuff turned into a bureaucracy
as hidebound as HUD.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The last few days I've called around to experts who aren't
part of the NASA space-as-usual club. They offer a critique
that goes beyond missed tests or faulty designs to NASA
itself. And the White House is starting to listen.</p>
<p>On their flight here from the Houston summit Wednesday,
Vice President Dan Quayle and White House chief of staff John
Sununu convened a caucus of space nonconformists. They
included Caltech scientist Bruce Murray, chancellor of the
University of Texas system Hans Mark, NASA administrator
during the Apollo years Thomas Paine and former astronaut
Eugene Cernan. My sources say they talked about "the need for
new thinking." (Harbinger: The last person to talk like that
was Mikhail Gorbachev.)</p>
<p>No one denies that NASA has great technical people. And
just about everyone, including White House sources, seems to
respect current (and relatively new) NASA administrator
Richard Truly. The critics say the system's the bum.</p>
<p>"The 1960s were anomalous years," says John Logsdon, of
George Washington University's Space Policy Institute. "NASA
was not a bureaucracy. Now it is." According to a study by
the Marshall Institute, the average NASA employee's age in
1963 was 30; now most of its senior and middle-managers will
be eligible to retire in five years. NASA's funding has
fallen by two-thirds since Apollo, but its workforce by only
one-third.</p>
<p>The calcium of self-preservation has settled in the
joints. Mr. Murray detects "a bureaucratic survival
instinct." The pre-eminent example is the space shuttle,
which NASA designed to have its own space-launch monopoly.
Sold to Congress as a workhorse capable of 60 flights a year,
the fragile bird hasn't ever flown more than nine. Yet NASA
won't even consider space-launch alternatives.</p>
<p>"NASA is less willing to ask, `Should we be doing this?'
It's not in their charter," says Mr. Murray. Robert Jastrow,
the astronomer and founder of NASA's Goddard Institute, has
recommended that key policy decisions be taken out of NASA's
hands altogether and given to an independent commission.</p>
<p>Another bad habit is NASA's gold-plated giantism. Take the
Earth Observing System, the climate-satellite network that
budget director Dick Darman privately calls "the $34 billion
thermometer." These are the grand pianos of satellites, big,
expensive ($3 billion per) and easily knocked out of tune.
But Albert Wheelon (of the Challenger Commission) thinks
smaller satellites could do most of the same work for less
money. NASA wants big and politically glamorous, even if
small and boring will more than suffice.</p>
<p>That's especially true of NASA's space station, a $30
billion marvel in search of a mission. As a platform to go to
Mars, the station is the wrong design. As a science
laboratory, it may be superfluous. The Journal's Bob Davis
now reports that even simple maintenance will require
thousands of hours of space walks a year, though U.S.
astronauts have walked only 400 hours in space ever. Without
rethinking, the station looks like a goner in Congress.</p>
<p>All of this cries out for reform, but Congress can't see
much beyond the budget. Al Gore, the Tennessee senator and
quoteman-of-choice since the Hubble news, is putty in NASA's
hands. His toughest critique is that "NASA bit off more than
it can chew," an excuse for spending less but keeping the
same system.</p>
<p>For its part, the Bush administration faces a dilemma. As
the most pro-space administration since Jack Kennedy's, it
can now decide to defend NASA, hoping that the next fiasco
occurs on somebody else's watch. Or it can lead an effort to
shake up or kill the plodding behemoth that NASA has become.</p>
<p>Reform is an especially good opportunity for Vice
President Quayle, who could use a substantive issue. The Veep
chairs the administration's National Space Council, a duty
that is actually written in law. Reforming NASA would prove
he's a player. The Council, similar to the space group led by
LBJ under Kennedy, is already staffed with young space
reformers. NASA will argue that any change could destroy the
entire space program, but leaving the program unchanged will
destroy it for certain.</p>
<p>Space exploration is a worthy government enterprise, in
principle, especially for a nation that has long defined
itself by the frontier. But arthritic bureaucracies don't
tame new frontiers. NASA is even losing to those ultimate
bureaucrats, the Soviets. Just as housing is too important to
leave to HUD, space is too important to leave to NASA.</p>
