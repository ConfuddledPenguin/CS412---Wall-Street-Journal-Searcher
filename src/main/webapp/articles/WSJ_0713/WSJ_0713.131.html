	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- The House approved a $30.8 billion
transportation bill that would increase federal highway
assistance by 18% in fiscal 1991, but impose new penalties on
states that fail to enact laws revoking the licenses of
drivers convicted on drug charges.
   The anti-drug provision, adopted 331-88, builds on
statutes initiated by a few states, including New Jersey and
Oregon, and attempts to impose a national standard demanding
that persons convicted of drug charges lose their licenses
for at least six months. Enactment would be delayed for two
years to permit legislatures to come into compliance, but any
state failing to do so would risk losing 2% of its federal
highway aid after Oct. 1, 1992.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The action came as the House Appropriations Committee
separately approved a $170.4 billion measure incorporating
major new funding for aid to public schools and medical
research but cutting sharply from proposed increases for an
ambitious project within the National Institutes of Health to
map the human gene. An estimated $66.1 million -- or less
than two-thirds of the Bush administration's request -- is
provided for the program. Although another $18 million is
held in reserve, these funds can't be released before
consultation between the committee and a new NIH director,
who has yet to be appointed.</p>
<p>Funds for the prevention and treatment of acquired immune
deficiency syndrome would continue to grow by an estimated
13%, but the great bulk of an increase of more than $1
billion for the NIH would be focused on research elsewhere.
The committee set a four-year goal of generating 6,000 new
research grants annually, or about one-third more than are
currently financed, and the budgets for individual institutes
would grow in some cases by as much as 15% in fiscal 1991,
which begins Oct. 1.</p>
<p>Within the Education Department, an estimated $5.4 billion
is provided for Pell Grants for lower-income college
students, but the larger increases are in those programs
focusing on young, disadvantaged children in public schools.
Reflecting the priorities of subcommittee Chairman William
Natcher (D., Ky.), compensatory education funding would grow
more than $1 billion to a record $6.2 billion, and the bill
provides another $2.75 billion for state grants for
handicapped education, or 36% above fiscal 1990.</p>
<p>Adopted 385-31, the transportation bill is the fifth of
the annual appropriations measures to clear the House. While
deficit-reduction talks continue between Congress and the
administration, the committee leadership is positioned to
complete action soon on the remaining legislation covering
the heart of the domestic budget. A $20.7 billion Treasury
and Postal Service bill is scheduled to come to the floor
today, and besides the Labor, Education and Health and Human
Services bill reported yesterday, a $50.35 billion
agriculture and rural-development measure could go to the
floor soon after.</p>
<p>The rush of legislation puts pressure on the Senate to
follow suit, and the leadership in both houses has virtually
abandoned efforts to first craft a compromise budget
resolution. By a 16-5 margin, the Senate Budget Committee
yesterday approved its own shotgun solution, which allows
more-modest spending increases than the House but would
permit an eager Senate Appropriations Committee Chairman
Robert Byrd (D., W.Va.) to at least begin drafting bills.</p>
<p>The resolution, quickly adopted by the full Senate last
night, sets an overall limit of $488 billion for new
discretionary appropriations in fiscal 1991 and $510.7
billion for resulting outlays over the next year. The balance
is designed to help meet stricter Senate rules governing
outlays. Although no standard is set for the military share,
the underlying assumption is that the Senate will be at least
as generous as the House toward defense, and any Senate cuts
from House-passed bills will come out of domestic and
foreign-aid accounts.</p>
<p>The higher domestic-spending figures in both houses depend
on achieving as-yet-undetermined cuts from the military
budget, and House Democrats so far have stalled in acting on
defense legislation for fear of betraying differences in
deficit talks with the administration. Rep. John Murtha (D.,
Pa.), chairman of the Pentagon appropriations subcommittee,
has met privately this week with Army, Navy, and Air Force
secretaries in anticipation of drafting his own outline of a
fiscal 1991 bill, but committee action could be delayed as
late as September.</p>
<p>By comparison, the rush of new highway and aviation
funding in yesterday's transportation bill won bipartisan
support. Despite the hue and cry over the deficit, the
committee leadership easily defeated, 288-133, an effort to
trim just $262 million from the measure.</p>
<p>The anti-drug amendment, sponsored by Rep. Gerald Solomon
(R., N.Y.), rode a wave of popular, election-year support,
but even as the chamber was proposing new penalties on
states, the bill itself was forgiving old ones. Among the
special-interest provisions attached to the measure is one to
block the Transportation Department from withholding as much
as $46.7 million in highway aid to five states that failed to
meet standards for compliance with the 55-mile-per-hour
federal speed limit.</p>
<p>House Public Works Committee Chairman Glenn Anderson
personally lobbied to protect $28.4 million for his home
state of California. Although less money was involved,
another of those in violation is Connecticut, which reported
that more than 71% of its drivers in a survey were traveling
over the limit.</p>
