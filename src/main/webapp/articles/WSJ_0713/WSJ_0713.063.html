	<p class="article-leader">"I'm a Ford, not a Lincoln," Gerald Ford observed when he
became president. George Bush seems to feel no such modesty.
At his June 29 press conference, Mr. Bush said he had changed
his mind about raising taxes. But Lincoln had changed his
mind about freeing the slaves: "I'm doing like Lincoln did,
`think anew.' And I'm thinking anew." What was the big deal?
   Not even Mr. Bush's most fervent admirers -- of whom there
are appreciably fewer today than there were two weeks ago --
had ever before noticed much similarity between him and the
Great Emancipator. But Mr. Bush needn't have stretched so far
-- there are plenty of likelier comparisons. Unlike Lincoln,
though, these other presidential promise-breakers didn't win
the posthumous plaudits of a grateful nation.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Take James Polk for example. In the 1844 election, Polk's
Democratic handlers came up with the slogan, "54-40 or
fight]" -- a message so bold and straightforward that people
remember it long after they have forgotten what it meant.
What Polk was saying was that he was prepared to go to war
with Britain unless it recognized the American claim to the
whole of the Oregon territory, all the way up to the mouth of
the Columbia River at latitude 54' 40 (just shy of what is
now the southern tip of the Alaska panhandle).</p>
<p>The promise to demand all of Oregon was important because
the Democrats were simultaneously planning to admit Texas to
the Union. Texas added hugely to the potential power and size
of the slave states; Oregon would counterbalance Texas by
adding to the number and weight of the free states. But when
Mexico threatened to go to war over the Texas annexation,
Polk, a Southerner, broke his 1844 promise and struck a deal
with Britain that set the border at the 49th parallel.</p>
<p>Polk's double-cross saved the U.S. from fighting Britain
and Mexico at the same time, but it also confirmed Northern
voters' fears that the Democratic Party cared only for
Southern interests, crippling the Northern wing of the
Democratic Party, hastening the division of the U.S. along
sectional lines and moving the country closer to civil war.</p>
<p>In character, Mr. Bush resembles the bellicose Polk rather
less than he does the high-minded Rutherford B. Hayes, an
Ohio lawyer nominated in 1876 by a Republican Party a little
embarrassed by some of the excesses of its previous eight
years in office. Both the party and Hayes himself were firmly
committed to carrying through with Reconstruction and equal
rights for the newly freed slaves. But a controversy over the
counting of the vote forced the Republicans into secret
negotiations with the Democrats after the election. The
bargain enabled Hayes to enter the White House; in return,
the Republicans jettisoned their commitment to Reconstruction
and freed Southern whites to run their states their way.</p>
<p>For sheer brazenness, perhaps the closest parallel to Mr.
Bush's flip-flop on taxes is Woodrow Wilson's handling of the
American entry into the First World War. Unlike his fellow
Democrat Franklin Roosevelt in 1940, Wilson made an explicit
commitment in the 1916 election not to intervene in the
European war. Within five months of Wilson's re-election, the
U.S. had declared war on Germany. The Republicans won the
next three presidential elections.</p>
<p>The historical record is, of course, mixed. But there's no
lack of evidence that presidential promise-breaking is
neither honorable nor profitable. Polk and Wilson wrecked
their parties by breaking promises; Hayes saved his party,
but only by sacrificing the rights of black Southerners.</p>
<p>The problem with all of these examples, as well as with
the Lincoln precedent that Mr. Bush understandably prefers,
is that the issues at stake today are, obviously, much
smaller. If Mr. Bush does in the end break his promise not to
raise taxes, he will not cause civil or foreign war or the
persecution of any minority. All he will do will be to throw
away his own reputation for good faith and, quite probably,
the prospects for Republican control of the Senate in 1992.
But then, that really ought to have been enough to stop him.</p>
