	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- The Federal Communications Commission
proposed changes in obscure accounting rules on international
telephone calls to make it easier for long-distance companies
to negotiate lower accounting rates.
   Accounting rates are the basis for allocating payments on
international calls between calls that use a U.S. and a
foreign telephone carrier. Under current rates, about 75
cents of each $1 collected by U.S. carriers on overseas calls
goes to foreign carriers, the agency said. The FCC said the
rates widened the gap in U.S. net settlements to $2 billion
in 1988 from about $40 million in 1970. The agency figures
that international accounting rates that are above the
foreign carriers' costs led to overpayments by U.S. consumers
totaling as much as $1 billion.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The agency proposed three steps to speed reductions in
accounting rates: allowing companies to file notices for
simple reductions in accounting rates; streamlining waiver
procedures for more complicated changes, including cutting
the agency's review time; and tentatively concluding that it
has the authority to establish lower rates based on costs.</p>
<p>Alfred Sikes, the FCC's chairman, said the commission
wants to learn about the true costs, levels of profits, and
how those costs and profits are shared among U.S. telephone
companies and foreign telecommunications authorities. "We
will also be examining ways to start down the road toward
correcting inequitable arrangements" with cost-based pricing,
accounting and allocation of profits, he said. An overhaul,
he noted, will require cooperation not only from the Bush
administration but ultimately from foreign governments.</p>
