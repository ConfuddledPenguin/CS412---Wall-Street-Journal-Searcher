   Spans the Generations</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>IMAGINE A HOUSE you can live in all your life.</p>
<p>America is already designing products and houses for the
aged or disabled. But single-purpose design has a limited use
and stigmatizes the old or infirm. So a handful of
architects, product designers and planners are trying to
promote "universal" or "life span" design -- or at least the
"adaptable" house.</p>
<p>"The trick is to build it right when you're young, to make
it more convenient later on," says Margaret Wylde, vice
president of the Institute for Technology Development in
Oxford, Miss.</p>
<p>All the products and technology needed for such a house
are currently on the market. In a universal house, light
switches, fuse boxes and thermostats are placed lower to
serve people of all ages and conditions, including those in
wheelchairs. In the kitchen, stove tops are flat sheets of
"induction" glass, to prevent burning and lessen the chance
of spills. Cabinets, sinks and counter tops rise or fall
mechanically, depending on the user's height.</p>
<p>In the bathroom, the life span house has a shower head and
soap dish that adjust up or down and a walk-in tub with a
watertight door. For the disabled and able-bodied, it has a
paperless toilet that uses warm water for cleaning and warm
air for drying.</p>
<p>The adaptable house leaves space under cabinets and sinks
for an eventual seat or wheelchair. The walls are reinforced
from the start against the day when grab bars may be needed.
The hallways are designed wide enough for wheelchairs.
There's a separate apartment that can be rented out or used
by children at first, by care-givers later. Gerontologist
William Wasch plans to build such a house for himself and his
wife in Middletown, Conn.</p>
<p>If all this sounds expensive, well, in the short run it
may be. In the long run, says Paul Grayson, a Winchester,
Mass., architect, a universal house can save money, if it
keeps you out of a nursing home.</p>
<p>Seeking to Make It Safe</p>
<p>To Dial While Driving</p>
<p>CHRISTOPHER Delaney took her eyes off the road only long
enough to dial a number. But that was long enough for the San
Francisco architect's car to do $2,000 worth of damage to the
"old hippie van" ahead.</p>
<p>Such accidents have the cellular-phone industry scrambling
to find safer ways of dialing from car telephones. It wants
to head off proposed laws like one in Minnesota that would
require drivers to park their cars when dialing.</p>
<p>Hands-free phone systems allow drivers to look straight
ahead while talking. But dialing "can cause a distraction,"
notes Lynn Ryan of the Cellular Telecommunications Industry
Association.</p>
<p>To minimize the distraction, Toyota's Lexus offers an
optional "command module," which lets a driver make calls
with both hands on the wheel. Chrysler owners can have their
phone on the sun visor, close to the line of sight.
Oldsmobile will put a touch-screen dialer with big numbers on
the console to the right of the steering wheel. Still, all
these designs require drivers to take their eyes off the
road, if only for a moment.</p>
<p>The best solution may be voice activation. A number of
manufacturers offer phones that will, for example, dial the
office when someone in the car says "office." The problem:
Most phones can be programmed to accept only one
pronunciation of a command, and outside noise can trigger
unwanted calls.</p>
<p>But By-Word Technologies of Dallas has begun selling an
attachment that is supposed to ignore the background noise
and can respond correctly to various pronunciations. The
company hopes, by year end, to have the product compatible
with 80% of car phones sold in the U.S.</p>
<p>A Juiced-Up Design</p>
<p>Strives for Better Aim</p>
<p>SOMEDAY, THEY may grow oranges on the Moon. If they do,
Phillippe Starck will be there to make them into juice.</p>
<p>Mr. Starck has designed a citrus juicer that's like a
cross between a lunar landing module and a three-legged
creature of the deep. Heavy aluminum, the "Juicy Salif"
stands 11 1/2 inches high and has little rubber feet. It also
has a deeply furrowed squeezing cone, to coax juice downward
into a glass while keeping it from squirting sideways into
the eye of the beholder.</p>
<p>Mr. Starck, who lives in Paris, also redesigned French
President Francois Mitterrand's apartment and New York's
Royalton Hotel. He did the juicer for the Italian firm
Alessi. The U.S. importer is Markuse of Woburn, Mass.</p>
<p>Odds and Ends</p>
<p>ROSE Enterprises of Bloomsburg, Pa., is testing a plastic
highway divider that can be filled with sand or water to
better absorb the energy of a car crash. . . . Design
students at Rochester Institute of Technology say the U.S.
could use 80% less plastic by packaging milk and other
liquids in plastic bags instead of rigid jugs, a method
already in use in Canada. A permanent rigid shell would house
the bag in cupboard or refrigerator.</p>
