	<p class="article-leader">DES MOINES, Iowa -- Pioneer Hi-Bred International Inc.
expects to report record fiscal third-quarter earnings and
that its share of the North American corn seed market rose
for the first time in three years, Thomas N. Urban, chairman
and president, said.
   However, the company likely will post lower earnings for
the fiscal year ending Aug. 31, since it had a record loss of
$51.8 million, or $1.66 a share, in the first half. Further,
the 1989 fiscal year included a gain on the sale of an equity
interest in an animal vaccine business.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Pioneer, the nation's largest agricultural seed concern,
believes it controls about 35.5% of corn seed sold in North
America, up about 1.3 percentage points from the 1989
planting season, Mr. Urban said. Corn is the biggest U.S.
crop.</p>
<p>Pioneer's market share rose despite less-than-expected
sales gains for the seed industry as a whole. An unusually
wet spring delayed many farmers from planting corn for so
long that they switched to other crops or abandoned their
fields.</p>
<p>Mr. Urban wouldn't say how much Pioneer's North American
corn seed sales increased in the 1990 planting season other
than to say sales "are up significantly."</p>
<p>According to analysts and competitors, Pioneer did
everything from cut prices to give away free bags of seed to
stop the erosion of its market share. But Mr. Urban maintains
the rebound was due to a sales force reorganization three
years ago.</p>
<p>Mr. Urban did concede that a slightly higher-than-normal
amount of seed was given to farmers as free samples because
the company introduced a large number of new hybrid seed
products.</p>
<p>Pioneer's sales strategy is increasingly based on
introducing a large number of new hybrids. This year, the
company offered 22 new hybrids to farmers. Another 17 new
hybrids are being grown by the company for sale next year.</p>
<p>Mr. Urban wouldn't estimate how much the company earned in
the third quarter ended May 31. Wall Street estimates putting
profit from continuing operations at between $4.54 and $4.70
a share "isn't a bad range," Mr. Urban said. "It will be the
best third quarter we have ever had."</p>
<p>In the fiscal 1989 third quarter, Pioneer had profit from
continuing operations of $114.6 million, or $3.59 a share, on
sales of $608.1 million. Profit from discontinued operations
of $605,000 made final net income $115.2 million, or $3.61 a
share.</p>
<p>Despite the unusually wet spring, the corn fields that
Pioneer has under contract for seed purposes are generally in
good shape. However, the late planting season means that the
harvest will probably run about 10 days late, increasing the
risk that a yield-damaging freeze might occur in such prime
growing areas as northern Iowa and northern Illinois.</p>
<p>The wet weather also might deal a setback to the company's
project to develop a market for crops grown without
pesticides. Pioneer pays farmers a premium to grow rice,
wheat, soybeans and corn without herbicides or insecticides,
and then sells those crops to food companies.</p>
<p>Wet weather usually increases weed and insect problems for
farmers, which can shave crop yields.</p>
