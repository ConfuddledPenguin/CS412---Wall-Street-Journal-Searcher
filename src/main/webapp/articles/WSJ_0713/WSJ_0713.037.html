	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- The House approved legislation designed to
bar discrimination against disabled people.
   Lawmakers voted 377-28 to approve a compromise version of
the bill that was hammered out in a House-Senate conference
committee. The bill also is expected to clear the Senate and
win President Bush's signature. Mr. Bush has supported the
legislation, which would guarantee access to employment and
public accommodations for 43 million people with
disabilities, since his 1988 election campaign.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Before approving the measure, the House rebuffed, 224-180,
a Republican attempt to send it back to conferees with
instructions to revive an amendment designed to let employers
transfer employees with AIDS from food-handling jobs. Earlier
yesterday, the conferees approved compromise language
protecting workers with AIDS from being shifted from such
jobs.</p>
<p>The provision would allow employers to reassign workers
who pose a threat to the health of others, but it would
instruct the secretary of health and human services to list
diseases that can involve such a threat. Secretary Louis
Sullivan has said that AIDS isn't transmitted by casual
contact, such as handling food.</p>
<p>The conference version of the bill also would establish a
Senate board to handle employment-discrimination complaints
lodged by disabled job-seekers or workers against senators.
Conferees earlier approved a similar arrangement for the
House. The decision would deny disabled people the right to
sue lawmakers for discrimination, but they would have the
right to sue when their grievances involve private employers.</p>
<p>Otherwise, the basic provisions of the Americans with
Disabilities Act apply to Congress and private employers and
establishments alike. The bill guarantees access for disabled
people to public places, such as theaters, zoos, government
buildings and grocery stores.</p>
<p>The bill also assures deaf people access to
telecommunications and bans discrimination in hiring or
promoting qualified disabled people. Employment provisions
will apply eventually to all employers with 15 or more
workers. There are some narrow exemptions in the
public-accommodations section of the bill for small
businesses.</p>
