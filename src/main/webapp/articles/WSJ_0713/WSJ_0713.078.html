	<h3>Saudis Appear to Have Won Campaign To Freeze OPEC Output, Boosting Prices</h3>

	<p class="article-leader">Saudi Arabia apparently has succeeded in its campaign to
lift world oil prices.
   After winning pledges from other oil exporters to freeze
output at current levels, Saudi Arabia, the chief producer in
the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, agreed to
a temporary reduction in its percentage of OPEC output. That
agreement made room for a bigger quota for the United Arab
Emirates, a chronic overproducer.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Finally, the kingdom nudged the UAE into accepting the new
quota of 1.5 million barrels a day that it had previously
rejected.</p>
<p>These developments set the stage for a likely new
production agreement when OPEC's oil ministers meet late this
month in Geneva, Switzerland. The expected accord would
establish a new output ceiling of 22.5 million barrels a day
-- an increase of 400,000 barrels aimed at accommodating the
UAE's return to the fold.</p>
<p>Oil prices exploded on the news. In the U.S. stock market,
oil stocks rallied sharply for the second consecutive
session. Some oil prices surged as much as $1 a barrel. In
the U.S. futures market, crude oil for August delivery
settled 99 cents higher at $18.46 a barrel.</p>
<p>Petroleum prices had dropped by one-third since the
beginning of the year because of an oil glut brought on by
OPEC overproduction. But prices began firming this week as
Saudi Arabia hosted a meeting of five Persian Gulf oil
ministers to try to lay the groundwork for a solution to the
output problem.</p>
<p>Among the ministers at the Jeddah meeting were those from
Kuwait and the UAE, the two nations that have been blamed for
much of the overproduction that has kept OPEC output well
above 23 million barrels a day.</p>
<p>In a grueling 12-hour session, according to people
attending the meeting, Kuwait's new oil minister pledged to
hold that country's output to its quota of 1.5 million
barrels a day no matter what the UAE might do. Kuwait has
been producing about 1.7 million barrels a day, and the UAE,
about two million a day.</p>
<p>"That took care of 50% of the problem," said a source
close to Saudi Arabia's oil-policy decision makers. "The
other 50% was the UAE," he said -- until late yesterday, when
King Fahd of Saudi Arabia made a phone call to Sheik Zayyed
Bin Sultan Al-Nayyan, the president of the emirates.</p>
<p>The UAE has been insisting on a quota of two million
barrels a day, its current level of output. OPEC had been
offering it a quota of 1.5 million to put it at parity with
Kuwait, but the emirates rejected that, and so OPEC had
continued to list the UAE at its old quota of 1.1 million
barrels a day.</p>
<p>Shortly after King Fahd's phone call, Mana Said Otaiba,
the UAE oil minister, told Hisham Nazer, the Saudi oil
minister, that he agreed to a national quota of 1.5 million.
According to Mr. Nazer, OPEC's Vienna-based headquarters will
be informed of the UAE decision today.</p>
<p>It's hardly likely the UAE will quickly cut output by
one-fourth, to 1.5 million barrels from two million. But even
if it only trims 200,000 barrels a day, that reduction
combined with cuts expected from Kuwait would drop OPEC's
daily output to 23 million barrels or less for the first time
this year. Oil economists say that should satisfy the oil
markets because it's in line with expected demand for OPEC
oil.</p>
<p>"What they {the Persian Gulf producers} have done is
decide that price should have priority over volume," said
John Lichtblau, president of the Petroleum Industry Research
Foundation.</p>
<p>In a maneuver not unusual for OPEC, the lower production
level would be obtained by raising the production ceiling.
That ceiling, now 22.1 million barrels a day, is expected to
be boosted to 22.5 million for the third quarter. Then around
Sept. 14 -- which will be the 30th anniversary of OPEC's
formation -- the oil ministers probably will meet again to
establish the ceiling for the fourth quarter.</p>
<p>"The intention now is to lift the price to September,"
said a senior OPEC delegate from a Middle East producing
country. "Hopefully, by September, all the OPEC members will
be tending to their commitments, and the price will be higher
than $18."</p>
<p>The oil ministers meeting in Saudi Arabia this week said
earlier that their intent was to raise the price of the OPEC
basket of crudes to "at least" $18 a barrel from the recent
average of $14. OPEC prices usually trail U.S. prices.</p>
