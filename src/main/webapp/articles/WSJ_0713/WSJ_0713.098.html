	<p class="article-leader">Sunny June weather across most of the country boosted
sales of apparel and other seasonal-related items for many of
the nation's largest retailers.
   Although June wasn't an outstanding month for most
retailers, the Merrill Lynch Retail Sales Index of 17 leading
chains showed that revenue increased an average 5.8% against
a 5.2% gain in May. Some analysts had feared that May's poor
results reflected consumer panic, not simply the widespread
cold, gloomy weather that month.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Analysts also indicated that much of June's revenue growth
was generated by heavy promotional sales. Many retailers
started the month with inventory they had expected to sell
during May. Top seasonal sellers in June, analysts said,
included air conditioners and pool-related products.</p>
<p>"We saw some improvement in June, which should enable
retailers to enter the important second half lean and clean,"
said Jeffrey Feiner, an analyst at Merrill Lynch & Co. He
added: "There are, however, problems ahead. The housing
market is weak, and there are slowing trends in personal
spending. There's also a lack of direction from the fashion
market, which may indicate softening for apparel."</p>
<p>Retailers that performed particularly well included
Wal-Mart Stores Inc., K mart Corp., and the Target discount
store division of Dayton Hudson Corp. Among the chains with
disappointing results was Limited Inc., whose namesake
Limited division had an estimated 5% decrease in sales for
stores open at least one year.</p>
<p>In active trading on the New York Stock Exchange, Limited
shares closed yesterday at $23, down $2.125.</p>
<p>"Overall economic growth and consumer spending as a
component of that growth is probably below average, but the
June numbers indicate the economy isn't sinking rapidly into
recession," said Barry Bryant, an analyst at Prudential-Bache
Securities Inc.</p>
<p>Mr. Bryant noted that consumers have been particularly
responsive to licensed products this summer. Sales of goods
endorsed by Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, Dick Tracy, and
"underachiever" Bart Simpson have been strong. "Who would
have believed that the Simpsons would have emerged as giant
counterculture figures in only 90 days?" marveled Mr. Bryant.</p>
<p>At Wal-Mart, same-store sales were up 14% in June and 12%
for the five months ended June 30 against the like
year-earlier periods. The discounter did particularly well
with men's and children's apparel, as well as food items and
toy products.</p>
<p>"They were helped because their reporting period included
five Saturdays instead of four Saturdays a year ago," said
Robert Buchanan, an analyst with Alex. Brown & Sons Inc.
"Still, they are taking market share from lesser competitors.
We're seeing a nationwide trend in which the strong get
stronger in retailing."</p>
<p>At Sears, Roebuck & Co., the nation's largest retailer,
comparable store sales were up 3.5%. "They did well with
their jazzed-up electronics and appliance departments," said
Mr. Buchanan. "They've begun to give a lot more space in the
stores to those categories, so you'd expect some pop in
sales. They didn't do as well in apparel, which reflects
continued weakness in that area."</p>
<p>At K mart, comparable store sales grew 4.3% in June.
"Their apparel sales were strong," said Mr. Buchanan. "The
big picture here is that the company's expense structure in
relationship to sales are higher than that of Wal-Mart and
Target. Therefore they can't price as aggressively across the
board."</p>
<p>Mr. Buchanan expressed surprise that the Limited division
of Limited Inc. showed an estimated 5% decrease in same-store
sales. "They are dropping prices on their Forenza
private-label line of casual sportswear, and that's hurting
them," said Mr. Buchanan. "The line is being replaced with
Paul et Duffier. The transition is causing some unexpected
pain." Same-store sales rose 5.1% at Dayton Hudson; 5% at the
parent Limited; 4.9% at Woolworth Corp; 4.1% at J.C. Penney
Co. and 1% at Carter Hawley Hale Stores Inc.</p>
<p>"The overall trend is that we saw a pick-up in promotions
in June following on an extremely sluggish May," said Janet
Mangano, an analyst with Jesup, Josephthal & Co. "What we saw
were pent-up promotions, not pent-up consumer demands. I'm
expecting disappointing second-quarter earning performances."</p>
