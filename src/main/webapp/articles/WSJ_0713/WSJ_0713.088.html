	<p class="article-leader">The Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll was based on
nationwide telephone interviews of 1,555 registered voters
conducted July 6 through July 11 by the polling organizations
of Peter Hart and Robert Teeter.
   The sample was drawn from 315 randomly selected geographic
points in the continental United States. Each region of the
country was represented in proportion to its population.
Households were selected by a method that gave all telephone
numbers, listed and unlisted, an equal chance of being
included. One registered voter, 18 years or older, was
selected from each household by a procedure to provide the
correct number of male and female respondents. The results of
the survey were minimally weighted by race and party
identification to assure that the poll accurately reflects
registered voters nationwide.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Chances are 19 of 20 that if all registered voters in the
U.S. had been surveyed using the same questionnaire, the
findings would differ from these poll results by no more than
2.6 percentage points in either direction. The margin of
error for subgroups would be larger.</p>
<p>An additional number of black respondents were also
included. This oversample does not change the results of the
overall survey, but aids in analyzing black voters' views.
The margin of error among blacks in this survey is plus or
minus 6.7 percentage points.</p>
