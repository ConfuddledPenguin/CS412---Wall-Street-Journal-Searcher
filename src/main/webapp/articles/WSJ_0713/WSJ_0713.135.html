	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- Republican budget negotiators have discussed
the possibility of giving up on a capital-gains tax cut, as
part of a trade-off that might clear the way for a
deficit-reduction accord with Democrats, congressional
Republicans said.
   In exchange, Democrats would be expected to stop pressing
for an increase in the marginal income-tax rate for the
richest Americans, a move that some Republicans are
unalterably opposed to.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Republican negotiators emphasize that they haven't made
any decision and that the final call is likely to be made by
President Bush. "The president hasn't changed his mind on
capital gains," said House Republican Leader Bob Michel of
Illinois.</p>
<p>Moreover, administration officials said they continue to
search for alternative ways to tax upper-income Americans
that Democrats and Republicans might accept as part of a
package that includes a lower capital-gains tax rate. Among
the alternatives the administration is considering are
limiting income-tax deductions or taxing securities trades.
Some Democrats also have mentioned higher estate taxes or
taxing employees' fringe benefits.</p>
<p>Rep. Bill Frenzel (R., Minn.) confirmed that Republicans
have talked about dropping both the troublesome capital-gains
and income-tax rate issues from the budget negotiations.
"It's true of every proposal that some people are for it --
including this one," Rep. Frenzel said.</p>
<p>"Everybody has always assumed there could be that
trade-off," an administration official said, "but nobody is
promoting it."</p>
<p>Asked if such a trade would please Democrats, House Budget
Committee Chairman Leon Panetta (D., Calif.) said, "That's
what {Senate Democratic Leader George} Mitchell and everybody
has been saying all along."</p>
<p>Republican congressional budget negotiators reviewed a
long list of tax options yesterday with White House Budget
Director Richard Darman and Treasury Secretary Nicholas
Brady. Among the taxes that were discussed, according to Sen.
Bob Packwood (R., Ore.), were limiting the income-tax
deduction for state and local taxes, taxing securities
trades, raising alcohol and cigarette taxes, a broad-based
energy tax and various sales taxes on luxury goods.</p>
<p>Democratic negotiators also met separately to talk about
taxes. Despite the reluctance of some, they blessed plans for
a private meeting between the chairmen of the tax-writing
committees, Rep. Dan Rostenkowski (D., Ill.) and Sen. Lloyd
Bentsen (D., Texas), and Messrs. Darman and Brady. Democratic
staffers said the tax writers were urged to receive proposals
and not to make any counter offers. Democrats are to caucus
again today.</p>
<p>Some Democrats are complaining that the talks may be
stalled -- again. "It's still unclear how we're going to
proceed," said Rep. Rostenkoswki. "The negotiations are not
going to the expectations I anticipated."</p>
<p>Earlier this week, Sen. Mitchell said flatly that
Democrats would never agree to cutting the capital-gains tax
unless Republicans agreed to raise the marginal tax rate --
the rate on every additional dollar of income -- on the
richest Americans to 33% from the current 28%.</p>
<p>Republicans complained that Sen. Mitchell's statement
wasn't constructive. House Republican Whip Newt Gingrich (R.,
Ga.) labeled it "total baloney." Rep. Michel, noting that Mr.
Bush began the summit talks in May by accepting Sen.
Mitchell's call for "no preconditions," objected that Sen.
Mitchell was now trying to set conditions.</p>
