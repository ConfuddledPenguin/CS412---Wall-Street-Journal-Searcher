	<p class="article-leader">YELTSIN QUIT the Soviet Communist Party as a wave of
defections loomed.
   Just as Gorbachev seemed to have stitched the divided
party together, the Soviet president's toughest radical
opponent started tearing it apart, perhaps for good. Yeltsin,
a former Politburo member recently elected president of the
Russian republic, has a huge popular following. Within an
hour of his announcement, several leaders of the party's
radical Democratic Platform group told a party congress they
were formally splitting and planned to set up an independent
party.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Yeltsin may be better attuned to the Soviet mood than
Gorbachev. Wednesday's strike by coal miners was driven by
demands for a revamping of the party along lines proposed by
Yeltsin.</p>

<p>STRIKERS ENDED their often-violent walkout after Managua
made concessions.</p>
<p>As the price for her own political survival, Nicaragua's
President Chamorro agreed to key wage and economic demands of
the pro-Sandinista unions that led the 10-day strike, which
brought gun battles to the streets of the capital. Public
employees won an immediate 43% pay raise and another,
unspecified raise to come next month. The government agreed
not to fire those taking part in what it had declared an
illegal walkout and said it will pay compensation to 800
people who had been fired since April.</p>
<p>The strikers also forced the U.S.-supported conservative
government to back down on its proposal to return lands that
were confiscated in the 1979 revolution.</p>

<p>A Senate committee decided against providing any money to
put nuclear-tipped MX missiles on specially equipped trains.
The decision by the Senate Armed Services Committee, which is
racing to complete a Pentagon spending bill, was a
repudiation of a key part of the Bush administration's
nuclear-weapons policies.</p>

<p>The FDA unveiled proposed regulations to change the
labeling of food products, including requirements that
nutritional information be provided for fresh produce and
seafood, and on levels of fat, cholesterol and fiber. One of
the proposed changes would create new definitions for claims
concerning cholesterol levels.</p>

<p>The House approved legislation designed to bar
discrimination against disabled people. Lawmakers voted
377-28 to approve a version of the measure cleared by
House-Senate conferees, who cleared language protecting food
handlers with AIDS. The bill is expected to pass in the
Senate and win Bush's signature.</p>

<p>Scientists said that as many as 13,500 Washington state
residents may have received significant doses of radiation by
drinking milk contaminated by radiation released from the
Hanford Nuclear Reservation, a major site for nuclear weapons
development since World War II. The Hanford facility has been
closed since late 1988.</p>

<p>Researchers reported that they used a new genetically
engineered protein in rats as a way of limiting the damage of
a heart attack, and they suggested the protein could do the
same in humans. The research also could lead to new therapies
for arthritis, as well as other inflammatory diseases, the
scientists suggested.</p>

<p>The House approved a $30.8 billion transportation bill
increasing federal highway assistance but imposing penalties
on states failing to enact laws revoking the licenses of
drivers convicted on drug charges. Separately, a House panel
passed a $170.4 billion measure including funds for schools
and medical research.</p>

<p>Some 4,500 Albanian refugees were due to arrive at an
Italian port city today aboard five ships. The boatlift to
Brindisi was organized to alleviate a two-week crisis that
began when the Albanians stormed Western embassies in their
capital, Tirana, in a bid to flee the hard-line Communist
nation.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>The Senate Judiciary Committee cleared legislation
requiring each federal trial court to adopt a plan for
cutting costs and delays. It also would create 77 new federal
judgeships, which congressional leaders say are needed to
tackle backlogs in the nation's courts. The bill is expected
to be passed by the full Senate.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>The FCC endorsed an internal agency report that supports
legislation passed by Congress in 1988 seeking to ban
indecent broadcasts 24 hours a day. A current ban prevents
any indecent broadcasts before 8 p.m.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>Tamil rebels overran a Sri Lankan army camp and killed 58
soldiers, according to military officials. It was the first
major victory for the insurgents since fighting resumed last
month. Only two soldiers were reported to have survived the
assault.</p>
