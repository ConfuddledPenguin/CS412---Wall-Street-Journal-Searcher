	<p class="article-leader">TOKYO -- Production of crude steel in Japan in June edged
up 0.2% from a year earlier to 8.98 million metric tons but
fell 3.8% from 9.33 million tons in the previous month, the
Japan Iron and Steel Federation said. A metric ton is equal
to about 2,204.62 pounds.
   "Japanese steel manufacturers are in a full operation" to
meet continuing robust domestic demand, especially from the
construction sector, a federation official said. Steel demand
for non-residential building construction, such as office
buildings and plants, has been growing, he said, and as
public works usually begin to hit their stride in the
July-September quarter, steel demand is expected to remain
high.</p>
