	<p class="article-leader">The founders of a Silicon Valley supercomputer company
sued Japan's Kubota Ltd., contending that the Japanese giant
conspired to co-opt the U.S. company's technology by using
its investment in the concern as leverage.
   Allen Michels and Matthew Sanders, founders of a company
that became Stardent Computer Inc., filed the complaint in a
California court yesterday, alleging that Kubota forced the
merger that created the company. Kubota then began to
transfer the technology to a wholly owned Kubota subsidiary,
they allege.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"It's a Trojan horse trick," said Joseph Alioto, the
pair's attorney, who filed the suit in Superior Court in
Santa Clara. Kubota, through its 22% stake in Stardent, took
control of the company's technology, he said.</p>
<p>The suit, calling for $25 million in damages, charges the
Osaka-based Kubota and several of its U.S. units with fraud,
intentional misrepresentation and fraudulent concealment,
among other allegations. Messrs. Michels and Sanders,
co-chairmen of Stardent, also name Kubota president Shigekazu
Mino and other top Kubota executives in the suit.</p>
<p>"We're very surprised here at this extremely sudden and
unexpected suit," said a Kubota spokesman in Japan. He added
that the company wouldn't have any added comment until it had
studied the suit.</p>
<p>Kubota officials in the U.S. couldn't be reached for
comment.</p>
<p>The allegations are sure to fire up criticism that
Japanese investments in U.S. electronics and other technology
companies drain the U.S. of valuable industrial assets.
Critics of Japanese investment have suggested that some
Japanese companies are seeking to carry innovative U.S.
technology home to conglomerates that have a harder time
coming up with creative new ideas, but can easily translate
others' ideas into products.</p>
<p>Indeed, Kubota, a steel and farm-equipment maker, has been
at the forefront of the investment boom in the U.S. In the
mid-1980s, Kubota, along with other steel companies, set off
on a course to survive by launching into new industries.</p>
<p>Kubota bought a stake in Ardent Computer Corp. of
Sunnyvale, Calif., in 1986. Later, Ardent merged with Stellar
Computer Co. of Newton, Mass. to form Stardent.</p>
<p>Messrs. Michels and Sanders, in the suit, contend that
Kubota forced the merger, threatening to let the companies
slide into financial ruin should they not agree. Stellar was
on the brink of bankruptcy at the time, says Mr. Michels,
Stardent's co-founder.</p>
<p>Mr. Alioto said Kubota recently set up Kubota Computers
America in Sunnyvale to absorb Stardent's technology. The
suit alleges that Kubota "secretly planned to develop
products that would compete with Stardent," despite
agreements to the contrary, he added.</p>
