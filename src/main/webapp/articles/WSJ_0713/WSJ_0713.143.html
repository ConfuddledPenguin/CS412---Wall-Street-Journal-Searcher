	<p class="article-leader">LOS ANGELES -- Castle & Cooke Inc. said it has been
contacted by several major companies interested in acquiring
its Dole Food Co. unit and has retained Goldman, Sachs & Co.
to help evaluate a possible sale of the subsidiary.
   The announcement is a tactical shift by Castle & Cooke,
which had planned to spin off Dole Food into a new publicly
traded company. Those plans were put on hold in May because
of financing concerns and uncertainty over the Internal
Revenue Service's tax treatment of the transaction.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Dole Food, known for its fresh fruits and vegetables, also
markets packaged and canned foods, chilled and frozen juices,
and assorted nuts. Last year, Dole Food contributed more than
90% of Castle & Cooke's $2.72 billion in revenue. One analyst
estimated that Dole Food could fetch as much as $2.5 billion.</p>
<p>David H. Murdock, Castle & Cooke chairman and chief
executive officer who holds a 23% stake in the company, said
in a statement that a sale of Dole Food "could be an
attractive alternative to the planned separation of our two
businesses and we believe it is in the best interests of our
shareholders to explore such a transaction."</p>
<p>Real estate development, largely conducted through Oceanic
Properties Inc., is Castle & Cooke's other business.</p>
<p>Last year, when Castle & Cooke planned to split into two
companies, it said the separation would allow for easier
financing of growth for both the real estate development and
food businesses and would allow management of both companies
better opportunities to focus on their individual operations.</p>
<p>Castle & Cooke owns about 129,000 acres in Hawaii, 32,000
acres in California, and about 9,000 acres in Arizona. Mr.
Murdock said through a spokeswoman that he wasn't pursuing a
possible sale of Dole to raise money for Castle & Cooke's
real estate development plans.</p>
<p>Larry Selwitz, an analyst at Cruttenden & Co. in Newport
Beach, Calif., says that Dole Food is a "very valuable
franchise" that might be particularly attractive to an
international food conglomerate because of Dole's world-wide
operations. Dole has many separate businesses that could be
spun off to help finance an acquisition, he said.</p>
<p>Mr. Selwitz said a sticky negotiating point in selling the
unit might be the ownership of Castle & Cooke's Hawaiian
agricultural properties, which it had planned to lease to
Dole under the spinoff plan. Also, Dole Food may have a
"morale problem" because of uncertainties about the company's
future, Mr. Selwitz said.</p>
<p>Earlier this week, Castle & Cooke announced "major
reorganizations" at Dole and some of its divisions. David
DeLorenzo was named president of Dole Food, filling a vacancy
created after Robert W. Fisher left to become president of
PPI Del Monte Tropical Fruit Co., a unit of Polly Peck
International PLC. During the past six months, about 40
people have been laid off at Dole's packaged foods division
in San Francisco.</p>
<p>Yesterday, in New York Stock Exchange composite trading,
Castle & Cooke shares closed at $30.50, up 37.5 cents. The
announcement about a possible sale of the unit was made after
the close of trading.</p>
