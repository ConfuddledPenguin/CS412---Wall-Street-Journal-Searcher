	<p class="article-leader">MIAMI -- General Development Corp. named two new
directors, and four board members resigned.
   The two additions to the real estate developer's board are
Todd G. Cole, 69 years old, vice chairman of Eastern
Airlines, and James W. Apthorp, 52, executive vice president
of Good Gulfstream Holding Corp.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The four directors who resigned are Reubin Askew, Howard
L. Clark Jr., Edwin I. Hatch and Eben W. Payne. General
Development's chairman and chief executive officer, Charles
J. Simons, said each of the four departing directors "felt
sufficient progress had been made in resolving the company's
legal issues" and wanted to see "new people with fresh
viewpoints" on the board.</p>
<p>In April, General Development filed for protection from
creditors' lawsuits under Chapter 11 of the federal
Bankruptcy Code, while it forms a plan to repay its debts.
Earlier in the year, the company pleaded guilty to a federal
charge of conspiracy to defraud about 10,000 home buyers, by
charging inflated prices based on improper appraisals.</p>
<p>The changes in the board leave General Development with
nine directors, down from 11.</p>
<p>Separately, General Development said the board voted to
postpone until later this year the company's annual meeting,
which had been scheduled for Sept. 28; a new date wasn't
specified.</p>
