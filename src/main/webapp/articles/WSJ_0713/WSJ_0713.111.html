	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- The Federal Trade Commission ordered Olin
Corp. to divest a business that makes chemicals for cleaning
swimming pools.
   The FTC's ruling, which upheld a December 1987 decision by
an administrative law judge, was based on a finding that
Olin's 1985 acquisition of the business from Chicago-based
FMC Corp. violated antitrust laws by creating the prospect of
reduced competition in the already concentrated pool-cleaning
chemicals industry. Olin, based in Stamford, Conn., had
bought the business for $49.5 million.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The agency, in a unanimous opinion written by Commissioner
Mary Azcuenaga, concluded that "high barriers to entry" into
the industry exacerbated the threat that the transaction
would decrease competition and possibly lead to higher
prices.</p>
<p>John W. Johnstone Jr., chairman and chief executive
officer of Olin, said in a statement that the company will
appeal the FTC's order in federal appeals court. He asserted
that "over the past five years, the market has continued to
be characterized by intense domestic and foreign
competition."</p>
<p>The FTC ordered Olin to divest the FMC assets within a
year and to sell the businesses to a buyer approved by the
commission. In addition, the FTC ruled that for ten years,
Olin must obtain government approval before acquiring any
interest in a company that makes swimming pool chemicals.</p>
<p>In the earlier ruling, the administrative law judge had
found that unless the FMC assets were sold to a third party,
Olin and FMC would control 76% to 86% of important segments
of the nationwide market for pool-cleaning chemicals. Olin
had appealed the judge's ruling to the full FTC.</p>
<p>Under a previous agreement with the commission, Olin was
permitted to complete the acquisition, but was required to
manage the former FMC businesses separately until the
antitrust issues could be resolved.</p>
<p>The business acquired from FMC makes up part of Olin's
line of pool chemicals called chlorinated isocyanurates. It
includes manufacturing plants in South Charleston, W. Va.,
and in Widnes, England, and a packaging facility in Livonia,
Mich.</p>
