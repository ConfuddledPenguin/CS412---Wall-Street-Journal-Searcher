	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- June was one of the busiest months for program
trading since the New York Stock Exchange started releasing
reports on the computer-aided trading activity two years ago.
   Program trading in June accounted for about 14% of Big
Board volume, or 21.4 million shares daily, according to
exchange data.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>In contrast, program trading accounted for an average of
only 9.9% of exchange volume in 1989 and 10.7% in the last
half of 1988. Program trading has been controversial because
of the market gyrations associated with some of its forms,
particularly stock-index arbitrage.</p>
<p>For the week of June 25-29, program trading accounted for
13.7% of Big Board daily volume, the exchange said. That is a
high figure for a week that doesn't include program trading
associated with the quarterly expiration of stock-index
futures and options.</p>
<p>The most active program traders for the week were Morgan
Stanley Group Inc. (22.4 million shares), General Electric
Co.'s Kidder, Peabody & Co. unit (15.3 million), Goldman,
Sachs & Co. (11.9 million), Salomon Brothers Inc. (8.9
million) and Susquehanna Investment Group (8.4 million).
These five firms accounted for 70% of Big Board program
activity for the week.</p>
<p>About 77% of all stock-index arbitrage activity was done
by Morgan, Kidder and Susquehanna.</p>
<p>Program trading is the nearly simultaneous purchase or
sale of 15 or more, and often hundreds, of stocks. In index
arbitrage, stocks are bought and sold with offsetting trades
of futures and options to profit from price discrepancies in
different markets.</p>
