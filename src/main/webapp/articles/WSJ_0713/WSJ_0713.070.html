	<p class="article-leader">Last week, the Federal Reserve Board's commitment to
fighting inflation met criticism from Treasury Secretary
Nicholas Brady, who would like the Fed to engineer a
short-term drop in interest rates to help take the sting out
of the looming tax hike. Higher taxes, Mr. Brady and Co.
apparently feel, won't cause so serious a political backlash
if voters can be persuaded that those taxes are part of a
budget deal leading to lower interest rates. Yesterday, Fed
Chairman Alan Greenspan allowed that the Fed might act to
"offset" the alleged credit crunch. It's hard to read Mr.
Greenspan's mind. But it is possible that he is using the
credit crunch as an excuse to lower interest rates without
appearing to knuckle under political pressure.
   If that's what happening, it is wrong. Political
manipulation of monetary policy might indeed seem to yield
short-term positive results. But long-term costs are
enormous. The drop in interest rates would be engineered by
inflating the money supply -- a move that will eventually
push interest rates and prices higher.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Politically motivated efforts to lower interest rates are
doomed to failure. An easy-money policy could temporarily
lower rates by flooding credit markets with new funds, but
there would certainly be a rebound as reality and the laws of
economics hit home. In other words, interest rates would rise
because lenders would be forced to add an "inflation premium"
-- extra percentage points of interest to compensate them for
the devaluation of their capital -- to the rate they charge
borrowers. An easy-money policy designed to lower rates will
ultimately result in higher rates.</p>
<p>In fact, long-term interest rates would probably rise
right away, since those rates are sensitive to expected
inflation -- and largely immune to credit-market
manipulation.</p>
<p>On financial markets, artificially lower interest rates
may result in temporary increases in stock prices, as
investors shift assets from bonds and certificates of deposit
to equities. But markets also will eventually be hurt.
Periods of inflation are almost always followed by economic
downturns; 1982 is the most recent example.</p>
<p>The best way to ensure lower interest rates is to
eliminate inflation. It's no accident that countries with
very low interest rates, such as Switzerland, Japan and West
Germany, also have strong records of price stability, while
nations that follow easy-money policies, as the U.S. did in
the late 1970s, have high interest rates.</p>
<p>Some budget-summit supporters claim that big tax increases
really will lower interest rates because a smaller deficit
reduces government borrowing. While intuitively appealing,
this assertion is hard to support. It is almost a foregone
conclusion that Congress will spend any additional money it
can extract from taxpayers -- rather than use it for deficit
reduction. But even if it doesn't spend revenues, the
relationship between the deficit and interest rates is not
what conventional wisdom suggests.</p>
<p>Look at some shifts from the past decade: In 1982, the
prime rate was 14.86%, down from 18.87% in 1981. The deficit
traveled in the opposite direction. As a percentage of gross
national product, the deficit rose to 4.1% in 1982 from 2.6%
in 1981. In 1985 the prime rate was 9.93%, down from 12.04%
in 1984. In the same period, the deficit grew to 5.4% from 5%
of GNP.</p>
<p>Most advocates of higher taxes probably realize that a
budget deal, by itself, would neither boost financial markets
nor lower interest rates. The politicians must realize, too,
that unless they can create the illusion that a budget
agreement has resulted in something positive, they will have
a hard time persuading voters that a tax hike accomplishes
more than giving Congress money to spend. This is why
participants in the budget summit desperately want the Fed to
give them a reason to justify higher taxes.</p>
<p>Pursuing irresponsible monetary policy to rescue bad
fiscal policy is like using gasoline to put out a fire. If it
doesn't blow up in your face, it will at least make things
worse.</p>
