	<p class="article-leader">Genlyte Group Inc., Secaucus, N.J., reported that
second-quarter earnings dropped 51% on a 4.3% drop in sales.
   The manufacturer of lighting fixtures and controls cited
effects of strikes in Canada, which have ended, and sluggish
construction in the U.S. Genlyte said early in June that it
expected the declines.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Net income sank to $1.7 million, or 13 cents a share, from
$3.4 million, or 26 cents a share, a year earlier. Sales
dropped to $123 million, from $128.5 million.</p>
<p>Strikes in Ontario halted construction from May 1 to July
9, and shorter wildcat strikes were called in Quebec; they
seriously hurt Genlyte's results. The company expects to
return to more normal operations this quarter.</p>
<p>Genlyte also reduced its debt by $2 million, to $162.5
million.</p>
<p>In national over-the-counter trading yesterday, Genlyte's
shares fell 25 cents to close at $7.50.</p>
