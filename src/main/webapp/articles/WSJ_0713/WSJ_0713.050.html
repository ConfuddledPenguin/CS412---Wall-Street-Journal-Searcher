	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- The Bush administration's top tax official
urged Congress to use "extreme caution" before concluding
that U.S. subsidiaries of foreign companies are evading U.S.
taxes.
   Testifying on the second day of hearings at a House Ways
and Means subcommittee, Kenneth Gideon, assistant Treasury
secretary for tax policy, said "it might be tempting to
infer" from data that foreign-controlled firms are illegally
shifting income out of the U.S. by paying excessive prices in
transactions with their overseas parents. But he said there
may be other explanations for the low tax bills, such as
"start-up expenses, acquisition indebtedness, the age of the
investment."</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Nevertheless, Mr. Gideon said, "There's certainly data
there to indicate we should be looking carefully at the
transfer-pricing practices of foreign firms."</p>
<p>The hearings follow a nine-month investigation by the
subcommittee of 36 U.S. subsidiaries of foreign automobile,
electronics and motorcycle companies. On Tuesday,
subcommittee investigators testified that more than half of
the companies paid little or no tax over a 10-year period,
largely by inflating the prices they paid their parents for
goods, services and technology to reduce their U.S. incomes.
U.S. tax law requires companies to charge market prices in
transactions with related firms.</p>
