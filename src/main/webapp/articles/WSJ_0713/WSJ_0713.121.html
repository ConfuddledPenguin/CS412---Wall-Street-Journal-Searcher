	<p class="article-leader">Monoclonal Antibodies Inc., Sunnyvale, Calif., said it
agreed to merge with the closely held Quidel Corp. of San
Diego.
   Monoclonal said it will issue about 9.7 million shares of
Monoclonal's common stock in exchange for Quidel's shares
outstanding, making the value of the transaction about $65
million at recent trading prices. In over-the-counter trading
yesterday, Monoclonal closed down 62.5 cents at $6.625 bid.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The merger, in which Monoclonal will be the surviving
legal entity, is expected to be completed in about 90 days,
Monoclonal said. The companies said they hadn't decided on a
new name for the merged entity.</p>
<p>The combined companies will be able to cut costs by
reducing redundancy, said Scott Glenn, Quidel's president and
chief executive officer. "We have two companies that have
strengths that will be a lot stronger when they're combined,"
Mr. Glenn said.</p>
<p>Monoclonal makes diagnostic test kits, primarily for
fertility tests, and reported revenue of $2.5 million in the
quarter ended March 31. Quidel, which makes diagnostic test
kits for fertility, infectious diseases, allergies and
autoimmune diseases, had revenue of $4.7 million in the same
period.</p>
