	<p class="article-leader">Air France said its board approved an additional six
options on Seattle-based Boeing Co.'s 747-400, the
superlong-range version of the aircraft. Financial details
weren't disclosed.
   Air France said deliveries are to be made between January
1996 and April 1999, in either the passenger or Combi
version; the latter carries both passengers and cargo on the
main deck, while all versions carry cargo in the belly
compartment below the main deck.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Air France said it already held 20 firm orders and 33
options for the 747-400, with the first, a passenger model,
to be delivered in February 1991. Of the 20 firm orders, 11
are for the passenger model, four for the Combi and five for
the freighter model.</p>
<p>As it reviews its fleet needs, the carrier said it will
advise Boeing about models that will be represented among the
39 optioned aircraft.</p>
