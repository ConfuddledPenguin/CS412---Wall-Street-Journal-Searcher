	<p class="article-leader">Scientists armed with a new genetically engineered protein
believe they have found a new way to manipulate the human
immune system to treat heart attacks and a range of
inflammatory diseases.
   Researchers at Johns Hopkins University medical school in
Baltimore and T Cell Sciences Inc. in Cambridge, Mass.,
reported that they used the new protein in rats to limit the
damage from heart attacks, and suggested that the protein
could do the same in humans.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The research, which is being funded by SmithKline Beecham
PLC, also could lead to new therapies for arthritis and other
inflammatory diseases, the scientists suggested in their
report in this week's issue of Science. The report is an
elaboration of experiments briefly described by the
researchers last fall at the annual meeting of the American
Heart Association.</p>
<p>The research involves a new way to block the action of a
part of the immune system known as the "complement system."
This is a collection of proteins that are activated when the
body is invaded by bacteria, fungi, viruses or other foreign
substances. Among other actions, the complement proteins
activate certain special blood cells to rush to an injured
area to clean up the debris left after the assault on, say, a
bacterium.</p>
<p>One adverse side effect of activating these specialized
blood cells is that the cells can inadvertently trigger an
inflammation of normal tissues. This is believed to be the
cause of some inflammatory diseases such as certain types of
arthritis, and of disorders involving inflammation of the
blood vessels (vasculitis), the kidneys (glomerulonephritis)
and muscles (myasenthia gravis).</p>
<p>Douglas T. Fearon and his colleagues at Johns Hopkins
reported that they had pinpointed one of the complement
proteins that can be used to block the complement system --
preventing, they hope, or at least damping the damaging
inflammatory response. The blocking protein engineered by T
Cell Sciences is a shortened version of a natural human
protein called complement receptor one (CR1).</p>
<p>In its first animal test, the engineered CR1 protein
successfully limited the damage of a heart attack in rats. In
this test, Dr. Fearon teamed up with Myron R. Weisfeldt and
his colleagues at Johns Hopkins who have been exploring a
phenomenon called "reperfusion injury."</p>
<p>In a heart attack, the initial damage to the heart muscle
is caused by a sudden blockage of blood flow by a blood clot.
Dr. Weisfeldt and others believe that additional damage to
the heart muscle occurs when blood flow is restored, as
happens when the new clot-dissolving drugs are used to get
rid of the blocking clot. This additional damage --
reperfusion injury -- is thought to be caused by
complement-activated blood cells that rush into the damaged
area with the restored flow.</p>
<p>In the rat experiment, blood flow to part of the heart
muscle was temporarily stopped to simulate a heart attack and
then restored. In the animals treated with the engineered
CR1, the area of damage in the heart muscle was more than 30%
smaller than in animals that had "heart attacks" but weren't
treated with the protein, the researchers reported.</p>
<p>In a second experiment, far fewer complement-activated
cells were found in the damaged area of the hearts of
CR1-treated rats than in untreated rats, indicating the
protein was, indeed, limiting heart damage by blocking the
complement system.</p>
<p>At T Cell Sciences, Scientific Director Patrick Kung said
the company had licensed rights to the proteins from Johns
Hopkins and from Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston,
where Dr. Fearon began his research. Mr. Kung said the
biotechnology company hopes to begin trials of the CR1
protein in human heart-attack patients late next year.</p>
<p>SmithKline Beecham, the big Anglo-American drug company,
is providing $10 million to $12 million to T Cell Sciences
for the preclinical studies of the complement-blocking
proteins and will fund human testing of the protein in return
for world-wide marketing rights.</p>
