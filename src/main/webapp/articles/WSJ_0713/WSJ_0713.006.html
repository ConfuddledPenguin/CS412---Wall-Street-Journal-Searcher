	<p class="article-leader">Chicago investors Samuel Zell and David Schulte have
raised $1 billion for a so-called workout fund, aimed at
rescuing financially troubled companies.
   The Zell/Chilmark Fund obtained institutional investors'
commitments yesterday for one of the largest capital pools in
the burgeoning business of restructuring companies that took
on too much debt in the late-1980s heyday of high-risk,
high-yield junk bonds.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Mr. Zell, chairman of Chicago-based Equity Financial and
Management Co., promotes himself as "the Grave Dancer" and
delights in profiting from business wreckage. Investors, he
says, have called his new fund "the Grave Dancer Fund."</p>
<p>The fund will attempt to make investments to gain
operating control of companies and resolve their financial
problems at the same time. "The thesis of this whole fund is
`good company, bad balance sheet.' This is not a turnaround
fund or a company-doctor fund," Mr. Zell said.</p>
<p>One of the Zell/Chilmark investors said yesterday that the
type of situation ripe for an investment by the new fund is
Interco Inc., a St. Louis furniture and shoe company, which
took on $1.8 billion in debt to fight off a 1988 bid by a
corporate raider, but defaulted on its debt last month.</p>
<p>Mr. Schulte, managing partner of Chilmark Partners, a
Chicago-based investment banking boutique specializing in
reorganizations, said he believes "cash will make a great
deal of difference" in persuading holders of bonds of
distressed companies to accept new securities. Before forming
Chilmark in 1984, Mr. Schulte led a reorganization group at
Salomon Brothers Inc.</p>
<p>Mr. Zell is best known for an investment in Itel Corp., a
container-leasing company that filed for bankruptcy-law
protection from creditors in 1981 and emerged through
reorganization in 1983. Mr. Zell, who became chairman in
1985, claims an annual return on his investment of more than
70%.</p>
<p>The fund aims to put the money to work within six years,
and will have an estimated life of ten to twelve years before
its investments are sold and the capital returned to its
investors. The fund's goal is an annual return rate of 40%.</p>
<p>Placement agent for the fund was Merrill Lynch & Co.
Management fees for the partnership start at 1.9% annually of
commitments under $20 million, declining to 1.25% for
investments greater than $125 million.</p>
