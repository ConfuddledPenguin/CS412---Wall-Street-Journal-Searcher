	<p class="article-leader">Scientists have found the gene that causes
neurofibromatosis, a disease that produces birthmarks, tumors
of the skin and nerve cells and learning disabilities in
about 100,000 Americans.
   The gene discovery is expected to lead to better diagnosis
and, perhaps, the first effective therapy for the relatively
common, inherited disorder. Scientists who found the
so-called NF gene also said it may play a surprisingly broad
role in the development and inheritance of several common
types of cancer.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The scientists speculate that the NF gene may be part of
recently identified class of genes that, when defective, can
unleash a cancer. Molecular biologists chasing after these
genes believe a cancer develops after a cell accumulates a
number of these mutated "tumor suppressor" genes, either
through inheritance or some type of damage to a person's
genetic material.</p>
<p>"The NF discovery seems to provide a bit of the molecular
pathway that transforms normal tissue to tumor tissue," said
Ray White, a molecular biologist at University of Utah who
led one of two research teams that simultaneously reported
finding the NF gene. "With each discovery the picture of how
a cancer occurs at the most basic level becomes more clear."</p>
<p>Finding the NF gene culminates a race involving a handful
of major research institutions over more than five years,
part of the world-wide hunt by biologists, geneticists, and
doctors to map the entire human genome, the collection of all
50,000 to 100,000 genes that direct the moment-to-moment
functions of human life.</p>
<p>Mr. White's group in Utah, along with researchers at the
National Cancer Institute, reported their findings in the
current issue of the scientific journal Cell. At the same
time, Francis Collins and colleagues at the University of
Michigan and Washington University School of Medicine,
reported finding the gene, by using different techniques, in
this week's issue of Science magazine.</p>
<p>Both Messrs. White and Collins said they believed the NF
gene signals cells to produce a protein that controls some
aspect of cell growth. The disease causes numerous problems,
they said, because the gene is active in cells in numerous
organs.</p>
<p>The scientists said they believed further work will show
that the disorder erupts in tissues only when both copies of
the gene -- each cell contains a gene passed on from each
parent -- becomes damaged. Thus, people who inherit an
already-defective gene from one parent are particularly
susceptible to the disease. If the second copy of the gene
inherited from the other parent is somehow damaged, cells
normally under control can grow into a tumor or behave in
some aberrant fashion.</p>
<p>"For years doctors have been puzzled by the fact that
people with NF have a 50% higher rate of cancer, such as
cancer of the colon, prostate and breast," said Mr. Collins.
"Now we think we know why." Mr. Collins said he will now
search for the protein produced by the gene and look for ways
to repair or reintroduce healthy versions of the protein as
therapy for those with the ailment. The protein also may be
helpful in treating cancer, he said.</p>
<p>Neurofibromatosis, in rare instances, can cause terribly
disfiguring tumors on the face and upper body, a condition
that has led people to erroneously call the disorder the
Elephant Man's disease.</p>
