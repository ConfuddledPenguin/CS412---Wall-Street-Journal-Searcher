	<p class="article-leader">Bruce McNeil reached eighth grade unable to read, was mute
until he turned 14 and has an IQ of only 79.
   Today, he runs his own business. The mentally handicapped
entrepreneur's struggle to get a Small Business
Administration loan has won support from political
celebrities all the way up to Sen. Edward Kennedy. But his
plight now also raises the question of how far the government
should go to help handicapped business owners.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Having built up a small seasonal house-cleaning service
with nine employees, the Gloucester, Mass., business owner
wants to move up in the world by starting a laundry business
as well.</p>
<p>He has enlisted help from a host of impressive supporters,
including Sen. Kennedy, Sen. John F. Kerry, also a
Massachusetts Democrat, a state senator and the mayor of his
home town. He has appeared on "Good Morning America" and
local radio talk shows to plead his case. And he has
ingratiated himself with dozens of executives who lend their
support.</p>
<p>Since applying for the loan, Mr. McNeil has convinced all
sorts of people that he can run the laundry -- but not the
agency that can grant the loan -- the SBA.</p>
<p>"Our agency is very interested in helping people," says
Richard Tomeo, assistant director for finance and investment
in the SBA's district office in Boston. "But we can't use
U.S. taxpayers' money for a business that just doesn't make
sense from a financial point of view."</p>
<p>The agency, whose loan officers sympathize with Mr.
McNeil, insists that Mr. McNeil's mental handicap has nothing
to do with its decision.</p>
<p>In March, Mr. McNeil applied for a $200,000 loan under the
SBA's handicapped loan program, one of the SBA's few direct
loan programs. Most small businesses apply for a loan
guarantee from the SBA and borrow from a private bank.</p>
<p>The SBA declined Mr. McNeil's application in May for a
variety of reasons. The loan committee said Mr. McNeil's
projections for sales for his wash-and-fold laundry delivery
service were "unrealistic."</p>
<p>But disappointments aren't new to the 30-year-old Mr.
McNeil. Therapy improved his speech problem, but his IQ as a
young person tested as low as 37. A doctor's report places
him at "borderline mental retardation" today. The average IQ
is 100. (Many individuals in his IQ range, of course, hold
jobs, though usually not highly skilled ones.)</p>
<p>"Until you really have an extensive conversation with
Bruce, you don't realize he has a disability," says Marc
Sandler, Mr. McNeil's attorney.</p>
<p>Mr. McNeil says a drinking problem that started at age 15
pushed him onto the streets of Salem, Mass., where he lived
18 months until a friend took him in. He worked odd jobs as a
maintenance worker, always earning below minimum wage.</p>
<p>Finally, fed up with the system, he developed his own
business niche-cleaning windows. The business succeeded, and
Mr. McNeil hired part-time workers with backgrounds like his
own.</p>
<p>The nine part-time disadvantaged employees at Mr. McNeil's
10-year-old house-cleaning service include former substance
abusers, high school dropouts and the disabled. They earn
between $6 and $15 an hour, based on productivity.</p>
<p>The business, however, is seasonal. Summer residents of
the blue-collar fishing town of Gloucester, located an hour
northeast of Boston, use Mr. McNeil's services more
frequently than year-round residents. Mr. McNeil says he has
20 regular customers a month and last year had revenue of
about $32,000.</p>
<p>His proposed business faces plenty of obstacles. The SBA
said his potential customers were "unsubstantiated" and that
his "collateral, considered along with other credit factors,
is not deemed sufficient to protect the interest of the
government."</p>
<p>But Mr. McNeil and his coalition of business backers has
doggedly disagreed with the SBA's reasoning. His request --
now for $140,000 in anticipation of a mortgage arrangement
with another bank -- has since been forwarded to the SBA's
regional office for reconsideration. A decision is expected
sometime this month.</p>
<p>Even if the SBA granted the loan today, though, it has no
money to give Mr. McNeil, since it has already approved
roughly $1.7 million in loans that it must wait until next
fiscal year to pay.</p>
<p>Indeed, the budget for the handicap direct loan program
has been halved to $12 million in the past decade, and there
is a subtle move within the Office of Management and Budget,
say SBA officials, to gradually get the SBA out of the direct
loan business.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, Mr. McNeil has gotten plenty of outside help.
His lawyer, Mr. Sandler, contends the entrepreneur's
projections were based on market surveys prepared by Burkelen
Inc. of Gloucester and consultations from Ben Fitzhebert,
owner of a major laundry business serving the North Shore in
Boston.</p>
<p>Mr. Sandler says the SBA's request to demonstrate average
business of 2,180 loads per month couldn't be fulfilled in
time to meet its deadline. Further, he argues, several
potential clients -- including the Portsmouth naval shipyard
in Kittery, Maine -- have said they would consider Mr.
McNeil's bids for their business.</p>
<p>The SBA argues in a June 8 letter to Mr. McNeil that the
liquidation value of the real estate, building, machinery and
equipment for Mr. McNeil's company is $78,787, not nearly
enough to cover the SBA's risk. Mr. Sandler argues that his
calculations put the figure at $125,200 for the building and
$49,750 for the washers, dryers and three vehicles.</p>
<p>One reason for the difference in estimates, Mr. Sandler
argues, is discounts being given to Mr. McNeil. For example,
Eastco, a Whirlpool authorized distributor, has offered to
sell Mr. McNeil washers and dryers at wholesale cost. The
Massachusetts Rehabilitation Commission also has given Mr.
McNeil a $25,000 grant to support his laundry business.</p>
<p>Finally, Mr. Sandler points to a clause in the application
regulations for handicap loans that regards loan repayment:
"Reasonable doubt shall be resolved in favor of the
applicant."</p>
<p>But the SBA says there is no doubt in the committee's mind
at this point that his business won't be able to repay the
loan. Nevertheless, "He has been single-purposed in his
approach," says Mr. Tomeo.</p>
<p>When projections on paper weren't enough to convince the
SBA, Mr. McNeil wrote letters to politicians, including the
president. An aide to Sen. Kennedy has called the SBA office
several times "trying to make sure they're really listening
and not just putting him through the rote process," says
Andrea Yakovakis, a staff assistant in Sen. Kennedy's office.</p>
<p>Sen. Kennedy's office has received letters from Gloucester
Mayor William B. Squillace and Massachusetts Sen. Fred Berry
(D., Essex) in support of Mr. McNeil. The office has also
received two petitions totaling 60 names from Heritage
Industries in Peabody and St. Peter's Church in Salem.
Despite the good faith, the SBA says, none of Mr. McNeil's
supporters can guarantee repayment.</p>
<p>Professionals who work free or at discounted rates for Mr.
McNeil concede he has a creative knack for bending ears. Mr.
Sandler, his attorney, started out representing Mr. McNeil
before a zoning board. "I just couldn't bail out at that
point," says Mr. Sandler.</p>
<p>"He's a rare individual," says Howard Frisch, an
accountant with Horvitz & Frisch. Less than a week after
receiving a call from Mr. McNeil, Mr. Frisch provided him
with a balance sheet and projected income statement.</p>
<p>"The business has a reasonable growth path, and he is
within the competitive price range," says Mr. Frisch, who
projects Mr. McNeil's first-year gross sales to be $189,000.
"He's such an aggressive talker, he just may make it."</p>
