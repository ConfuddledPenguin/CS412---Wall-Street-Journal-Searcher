	<p class="article-leader">PHILADELPHIA -- Meritor Savings Bank said it expects to
report a widened second-quarter loss of about $138 million,
or $3.94 a share, reflecting heavy charges for
recapitalization and restructuring.
   In the 1989 second quarter, Meritor had a loss of $21.2
million, or 61 cents a share.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Roger S. Hillas, Meritor's chairman and chief executive
officer, said Meritor has now completed the second stage of a
difficult restructuring that began in late 1987. A debt
recapitalization plan, approved by federal regulators
Tuesday, will increase Meritor's shareholder equity by about
$98 million, which will be reflected in the third quarter.
Thus, Meritor will be in compliance with all the new capital
requirements under the thrift bailout law passed last year.</p>
<p>The first stage of the restructuring was to shrink
Meritor, which in the early 1980s was the nation's largest
thrift. Total assets have been reduced by nearly 70% to about
$7 billion at the end of June from a peak of $21.5 billion.</p>
<p>The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. approved a plan to
recapitalize a Meritor savings and loan unit, Meritor Savings
FA, headquartered in Winter Haven, Fla. The recapitalization
allowed the thrift to exchange about $172 million of debt for
$42 million in cash and $18 million in new debt.</p>
<p>The regulatory approval for this debt swap gave Meritor
enough capital leeway to take other steps needed to complete
its restructuring and eventually return the company to
profitability, Mr. Hillas said.</p>
<p>Those steps include an increase of $35 million in its
provision for loan losses. Other costs and charges for the
quarter include: the termination of interest-rate swap and
floor contracts at a cost of $55 million, the creation of a
$54 million reserve for expenses from unused office space,
and $303 million in costs and charges, including a goodwill
write-off of $172 million connected with the company's sale
of 54 branches to Mellon Bank Corp.</p>
<p>"Now the balance sheet is really representative of what
the company's worth," said Mr. Hillas.</p>
<p>Mr. Hillas must turn his attention to making the
now-smaller thrift profitable again. He said he expects
Meritor could be showing an operating profit by the second
half of 1991. "But we can't control interest rates and the
real estate market malaise," he said. The challenge for Mr.
Hillas will be to rotate low fixed-income assets and
high-rate liabilities with assets that provide a higher rate
of return and lower-cost liabilities or deposits.</p>
<p>David Penn, a bank analyst with Legg Mason in Baltimore,
says Meritor has another hurdle it must overcome before it
returns to profitability: A high level of nonperforming
assets, about 5%, of total assets, which are a drag on
earnings.</p>
<p>Mr. Hillas noted that there were some large nonperforming
real estate loans, which the bank has helped customers work
out in recent years, that could begin accruing interest once
again before year end. Yet he admits that while Meritor
doesn't have any "undue" real estate problem, "they could go
on for a while."</p>
