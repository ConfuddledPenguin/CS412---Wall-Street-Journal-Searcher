	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- Neither liberals nor conservatives can claim
to dominate the social and cultural issues that most stir
American voters' emotions, according to a new Wall Street
Journal/NBC News poll.
   The poll on social issues found that most Americans these
days seem generally tolerant on a wide range of issues, from
sexuality to race. Meanwhile, those issues that do push
voters' "hot buttons" don't seem to primarily favor either
political party.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"The story on social issues is fascinating because it
reveals a country that is not ideologically aligned with the
left or the right, but that has a fundamental sense of what
should constitute public morality in 1990," say pollsters
Peter Hart and Robert Teeter, who conducted the survey for
the Journal and NBC.</p>
<p>The poll, one of four special quarterly surveys the
Journal and NBC conduct on various topics, found that some
issues seem to represent part of a core set of beliefs or
standards for Americans. When these are violated, more
conservative attitudes seem to prevail. For example, 71% of
voters surveyed favor the death penalty; 57% support a
constitutional amendment to prohibit burning the flag; 54%
favor restrictions on public funding for art that some people
may deem obscene.</p>
<p>But on issues involving health and welfare, or affecting
privacy and personal rights, more liberal views seem to hold
sway. A principal example is abortion. While 52% of those
polled said they personally consider abortion to be wrong --
a figure that has remained constant in nearly a decade of
surveys -- an even larger majority of 60% said abortion
shouldn't be made illegal.</p>
<p>When asked to choose which among three statements came
closest to their own views, 57% said abortion should be left
up to the woman and her doctor, 33% said it should be
available only in cases of rape and incest, and 8% said it
should be illegal in all circumstances. Americans turn more
conservative, however, when the question of abortion rights
is mixed with that of parental rights. By a margin of 75% to
21%, they support laws requiring that parents be notified
before a girl under age 18 can have an abortion.</p>
<p>Abortion remains an issue of great intensity at both ends
of the spectrum. Yet the Journal/NBC poll also shows its
divided political impact: Asked which party best deals with
the issue, 27% of voters said Democrats, 20% said
Republicans, and 35% said both or neither.</p>
<p>Race relations present Americans with a different set of
conflicts. Most voters see the nation making some strides:
Asked whether blacks are better off than they were a decade
ago, 69% of whites and 60% of blacks said yes. But on other
issues, sharp racial divisions are evident. "When it comes to
race, whites tend to see the glass as half full, blacks tend
to see the glass as two-thirds empty," say Mr. Hart and Mr.
Teeter.</p>
<p>For example, 40% of whites, but only 20% of blacks,
believe relations between their races are either good or very
good; just over a quarter of the whites, but half of the
blacks, say relations are fairly poor to poor. The black
skepticism cuts across all age groups and is particularly
pronounced among men.</p>
<p>And while 76% of blacks believe they are discriminated
against, only 29% of whites agree with them. On the other
hand, whites as well as blacks solidly back
affirmative-action plans in business, providing they contain
"no rigid quotas." And only 15% of whites said they believe
blacks are getting too much special treatment.</p>
<p>While the poll found that whites have roughly the same
views toward Asian-Americans and Hispanics as toward blacks,
black voters' attitudes toward these other ethnic groups are
more complex. While they tend to see Hispanics as
discriminated against, they take a more critical view toward
Asian-Americans, with 28% saying they receive too many
special advantages.</p>
<p>On a number of other social issues, the Journal/NBC poll
found that Americans seem to share a number of broad
attitudes that don't fit neatly into a liberal or
conservative profile. In some cases, in fact, large
majorities of voters took the same view despite stark
differences in how they viewed themselves ideologically:</p>
<p>For example, 73% of voters support banning the sale of
so-called "assault" weapons and semiautomatic rifles. The
figure was 86% among those the pollsters identified as social
liberals; more surprisingly, even 61% of social conservatives
agreed. Equally surprisingly, 58% of social liberals back the
death penalty. (Black voters, however, are split down the
middle on the question.)</p>
<p>The proposal for a law requiring employers to give unpaid
leave to new parents or those caring for sick relatives is
another example of an issue that is popular across the board.
Overall, 71% of voters in the poll favor the measure, and
majorities support it in all categories.</p>
<p>"When you find that even 52% of social conservatives favor
parental leave, and 58% of social liberals favor the death
penalty, you have a pretty good consensus," the pollsters
say.</p>
<p>Compared with other major issues, though, few voters
volunteer the social issues when they are asked to name the
most important matters facing the country. Few also give
either political party a huge edge in addressing such issues.
The result, Mr. Hart says, is that neither political party
enters the next election with a clear advantage on the
social-issues debate.</p>
<p>Instead, the Journal/NBC poll suggests that many voters
seem to be searching for a broadly tolerant middle ground.
For example, 57% of those polled favor rating and restricting
music containing obscenities, much as movies are rated and
restricted now. Fewer than one in three voters would ban such
music. On the question of AIDS, 78% said the federal
government should continue to make research and treatment a
top priority, rather than divert some of the resources to
other diseases.</p>
<p>Lost in the sometimes wrenching debates over social-policy
questions in recent years is the fact that on many of these
issues -- abortion, for one -- attitudes haven't shifted
substantially in a decade or more. But the Journal/NBC poll
found one area where views clearly have sharply changed:
premarital sex. In a September 1978 Gallup poll, 50% of those
polled said sex before marriage was wrong and 41% said it
wasn't; in the new Journal/NBC poll, 60% don't object to
premarital sex, while only 33% say it is wrong.</p>
<p>But as some things change, some constants remain. Of those
surveyed in the Journal/NBC poll, 60% say religion is
extremely or very important in their lives. An even larger
percentage, 69%, say religion is either as or more important
to them than it was to their parents when they were growing
up.</p>
