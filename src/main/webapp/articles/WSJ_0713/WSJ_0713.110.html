	<p class="article-leader">The over-the-counter market surged along with the New York
Stock Exchange on rising hopes for lower interest rates.
   Traders say OTC stocks were unstoppable after Federal
Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan told the Senate Banking
Committee that the Fed is prepared to lower rates to offset
the threat of a credit crunch.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"It was an extraordinary day over the counter," says Jerry
Markowitz, partner in charge of OTC trading at Montgomery
Securities.</p>
<p>The buying spree pushed the Dow Jones Industrial Average
to a new all-time high at 2,969.80 on a 37.13 point gain. The
Nasdaq Industrial Index also hit an all-time high for the
second day in a row, rising 3.90 points to 507.47.</p>
<p>Mr. Markowitz says he believes the market will move higher
still.</p>
<p>"My guess is that the {industrial average} is going to
3,000," he says.</p>
<p>The Nasdaq Composite Index jumped 3.27, or 0.7% to 467.17,
lagging behind a 1.12% rise on the Big Board composite index.</p>
<p>The Nasdaq Utility Index was the strongest sector on the
over-the-counter market with a 1.15% gain.</p>
<p>OTC telephone stocks got a particularly strong boost
following the announcement of GTE Corp.'s proposed $6.24
billion merger with Contel Corp. Contel Cellular, Contel's
90%-owned cellular telephone subsidiary, saw its Class A
shares rocket 3 3/8 to 21.</p>
<p>The stock led other cellular telephone stocks higher,
including U S West NewVector, which gained 1 3/8 to 35 3/4;
Vanguard Cellular's Class A, which advanced 1 3/4 to 25 3/4;
Cellular Communications, which gained 1 to 36 3/4; and McCaw
Cellular Class A, which ended 7/8 points ahead at 27 1/8.
Lincoln Telephone, an independent telephone company, rallied
3 1/4 to 28.</p>
<p>OTC advancers led decliners, 1,078 to 832. Volume eased
153.7 million shares from Wednesday's 159 million shares.</p>
<p>Conner Peripherals led the most-active list, gaining 2 1/8
to 29 7/8 on volume of 3.33 million shares. The company
recently completed a secondary offering of 6.4 million shares
at $26.75 each. The stock gained a point on volume of more
than 4.5 million shares Wednesday.</p>
<p>Shearson Lehman Hutton raised its 1990 and 1991 earnings
estimate for the disk-drive maker yesterday. Shearson said
the increase is in response to information provided during
the company's offering, which indicated that Conner's
disk-drive sales will grow more than previously expected.</p>
<p>Shearson also said it expects the company's gross profit
margin to drift up in the next couple of years.</p>
<p>"In bull markets stocks go up after deals," says Thomas
Unterberg, partner of Unterberg Harris De Santis, who
co-managed the deal with Lehman Brothers. "You've got a super
bull market in technology stocks right now, and in drive
stocks in particular."</p>
<p>Oracle Systems continued to slide, losing 7/8 to 19.
Investors were disappointed by the company's earnings
reported late Tuesday, despite the fact that profit grew 56%
from the year-earlier quarter. Oracle fell 2 1/2 points
Wednesday on volume of more than 9 million shares.</p>
<p>Novell added 1 1/2 to 57 3/4. Late Wednesday the company
said its board approved a 2-for-1 stock split, payable Aug.
17.</p>
<p>Hologic jumped 2 7/8 to 27. Hambrecht & Quist repeated its
"buy" recommendation on the stock yesterday, according to Dow
Jones Professional Investor Report. Progress in the treatment
of osteoporosis is likely to increase demand for the
company's bone density monitors, DJPIR reports.</p>
<p>National Penn Bancshares dropped 3 to 39. Late Wednesday,
the company reported that it earned 88 cents a share in the
second quarter ended in June compared to 80 cents a year
earlier.</p>
<p>InterVoice fell 4 to 14 1/2. Securities firm William K.
Woodruff slashed its earnings estimate for the company's 1991
fiscal year. The securities firm said it lowered its outlook
for InterVoice after the company's executives told
shareholders yesterday that orders from resellers of the
company's products are slower than expected. The executives
also said InterVoice should pass on a cost reduction to
customers rather than earn fatter margins.</p>
