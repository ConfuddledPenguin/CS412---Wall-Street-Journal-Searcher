	<p class="article-leader">SEOUL, South Korea -- South Korea's car exports in June
increased 120% to 27,240 from May but declined 2.2% from a
year earlier, the Trade and Industry Ministry said.
   Officials said the increase from the previous month owed
largely to a lack of labor strikes at auto plants. In May,
strikes were under way at Hyundai Motor Co.'s plant in Ulsan,
southeast of Seoul, and at other auto makers. Hyundai's
shipment to the U.S. of a new subcompact model, Scoupe, also
contributed to the June increase in exports. Hyundai is the
largest of South Korea's five auto makers.</p>
