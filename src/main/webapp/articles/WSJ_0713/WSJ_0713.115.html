	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- The Federal Reserve Board is poised to ease
interest rates in response to "cumulating evidence" it sees
of a credit crunch that could hurt the economy, Chairman Alan
Greenspan said.
   Mr. Greenspan, testifying before the Senate Banking
Committee, said the Fed was monitoring the situation "day by
day" and was prepared to take "offsetting action" to make up
for cutbacks in bank lending. However, Mr. Greenspan said he
didn't see any weakness in the economy that alone would
justify easing -- leaving him at odds with Bush
administration officials who have argued for lower rates
because of recent slow growth in the economy. Thus, he said,
any action would be "modest."</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"It's an offsetting action, not a response to economic
effects we believe are fundamental," Mr. Greenspan said.</p>
<p>Mr. Greenspan's comments are the first acknowledgement by
the central bank that the credit crunch may be having broad
effects throughout the economy. They are also the first sign
that the Fed may be preparing to ease credit soon.</p>
<p>Mr. Greenspan stopped short of saying the Fed actually
intended to push rates down, but there were many hints in his
testimony that the central bank is on the verge of doing so.
He said, for example, that the Fed hasn't changed its
interest-rate policy in six months, and said such consistency
"is extremely rare."</p>
<p>Any easing by the Fed is certain to be welcome by the Bush
administration. But officials increasingly worry that action
by the Fed will be too little and too late.</p>
<p>In wide-ranging testimony, Mr. Greenspan also said the Fed
is working on proposals to increase capital requirements for
banks and to mandate tougher regulation for banks that don't
meet the capital levels. Outlining his views on
deposit-insurance reform for the first time, the Fed chairman
expressed skepticism about most suggestions for overhauling
the insurance system itself -- such as lowering the $100,000
insurance limit or trying to impose bigger losses on
depositors.</p>
<p>"The board believes that the most promising approach is to
reform both bank capital and supervisory policies," Mr.
Greenspan said.</p>
<p>Financial markets rallied in response to Mr. Greenspan's
comments about interest rates. About 10 minutes after his
remarks were reported, the Dow Jones Industrial Average had
jumped 14 points from Wednesday's close. The rally continued
through the afternoon, and the market closed at 2969.80, up
37.13 points.</p>
<p>Mr. Greenspan said key indicators that had led him to
change his views included slow growth in the money supply and
an increase in the interest rates banks charge on commercial
loans. Those factors suggest that the banks, in toughening
lending standards, are "creating a tightening in credit
markets, independent of actions by the Federal Reserve," he
said.</p>
<p>"This suggests a market tightening of modest dimensions
may be occurring," Mr. Greenspan continued. "If so, that
could have undesirable effects on the economy, that the
Federal Reserve would have to consider offsetting with an
ease in monetary policy."</p>
<p>Mr. Greenspan's comments came as a surprise because only
Tuesday, in comments to Senate Republicans with whom he met
privately, the Fed chairman emphasized the low rate of
unemployment, suggesting the Fed had little room to bring
down rates without sparking inflation. Treasury and Federal
Reserve officials met at their regular weekly luncheon on
Wednesday and discussed the issue. But there was apparently
no clear evidence presented at that luncheon to justify the
change.</p>
<p>But Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady recently took the
unusual step of criticizing Fed policy in public. And the
Fed's policy committee meeting last week gave Chairman
Greenspan the authority to ease credit slightly if conditions
required.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, many business groups and lawmakers have
continued to argue that viable businesses and projects are
being turned away by banks, partly because federal regulators
are overzealously cracking down on lending standards in the
wake of the savings and loan scandal. Until now, government
officials including Mr. Greenspan have maintained that banks
were engaged only in a healthy "credit contraction," lending
less for real estate, for instance, because of problems in
that market.</p>
<p>Yesterday, Mr. Greenspan suggested that "the pulling back
of commercial banks to less lax lending standards is moving
over the line and, in effect, creating a tightening in credit
markets."</p>
<p>Quizzed by senators about the Fed's coming proposals on
bank capital, Mr. Greenspan said the Fed would seek "not
insignificant" increases, but not as much as a doubling of
the current requirements. Under an international accord that
will be phased in beginning next year, banks must maintain
capital equal to 8% of their assets, with the assets adjusted
for the riskiness of the portfolio. Mr. Greenspan said the
international accord allows the U.S. to increase requirements
for its banks.</p>
<p>Despite his comments about the credit crunch, the Fed
chairman acknowledged in his testimony that higher capital
levels will induce banks to turn away some borrowers as the
lenders hoard cash and trim assets. But Mr. Greenspan said
the borrowers who would be hurt would be those pushing
"speculative and riskier ventures. . . . {It} is just such
financing by some insured institutions that has caused so
many of the current difficulties."</p>
<p>But Mr. Greenspan said the capital requirements would be
phased in "over time" and that the Fed could act to keep
interest rates down as the new levels were being implemented.</p>
<p>Higher capital requirements will also increase bank
consolidation, Mr. Greenspan said.</p>
<p>Mr. Greenspan's statements about deposit insurance add up
to an audacious and controversial overall plan to restructure
the banking industry and banking regulation. He advocated
granting broader powers to banks that met the higher capital
requirements. His views spurred some criticism from senators,
such as Alfonse D'Amato (R., N.Y.), who are leery of more
deregulation after the S&L mess.</p>
<p>"Like many who are skeptical of deposit-insurance changes,
he is looking for other ways to give banks more powers," said
Robert Litan, a banking scholar with the Brookings
Institution.</p>
<p>Moreover, in a sharp reversal of several years of Fed
policy on bank deregulation, he said the central bank was
"re-evaluating" its view that administrative barriers called
"firewalls" can effectively insulate problems at a bank's
subsidiary, such as a securities business, from the bank
itself, which holds federally backed deposits.</p>
<p>Mr. Greenspan said the Fed had drawn the lesson that
firewalls can be ineffective from the failure earlier this
year of Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. In that failure,
liquidity problems at the holding company ultimately resulted
in the liquidation of the solvent brokerage unit.</p>
<p>A better answer, Mr. Greenspan said, is more capital and a
strict regulatory regimen under which banks would face
certain restrictions as their capital declined. Among the
restrictions might be lowered dividends, slower asset growth
and restrictions on brokered deposits, Mr. Greenspan said.</p>
<p>He also asked Congress to give regulators the authority to
force mergers and government takeovers of banks when there
was still a small amount of capital left, to minimize the
costs to the government. Currently the government doesn't
seize banks until they are insolvent, unless there are
serious regulatory violations.</p>
