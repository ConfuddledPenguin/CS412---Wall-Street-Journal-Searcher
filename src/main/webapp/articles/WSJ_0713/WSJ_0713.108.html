	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- The Food and Drug Administration unveiled
proposed regulations that would change the labeling of food
products, including requirements that nutritional information
be provided for fresh produce and seafood, and on levels of
fat, cholesterol and fiber.
   Health and Human Services Secretary Louis Sullivan, in
announcing the proposed requirements, said "the consumer
should be able to read and understand food labels, based on
reliable and vital information. These proposed regulations
will help make food labels more clear and cogent."</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Currently, nutrition labeling is voluntarily included by
some food packagers but is required only on fortified foods
and those for which nutritional claims are made. FDA
officials estimated that the proposed regulations would cost
the food industry approximately $300 million in one-time
costs. The industry and consumer groups will be allowed 30
days to comment on the proposed requirements.</p>
<p>One change would create new definitions for claims
concerning cholesterol levels. Products could be called
"cholesterol free" if they contain less than two milligrams a
serving, while also containing less than five grams of total
fat and less than two grams of saturated fat a serving.</p>
<p>Products could be designated "low cholesterol" if they
contain less than 20 milligrams of cholesterol a serving and
the same total and saturated fat levels as those in
cholesterol-free products. Manufacturers could call their
products "reduced cholesterol" if they contain 75% less
cholesterol than similar products of their own label or
comparable products of other companies.</p>
<p>Among the other changes proposed by Secretary Sullivan is
adding nutritional information for four food components while
dropping it for four others. Those added would be
cholesterol, saturated fat and calories from fat and fiber.
Those dropped would be thiamine, riboflavin, niacin and one
of the two protein listings.</p>
<p>Frank Scarbrough, director of the Office of Nutrition at
the Food and Drug Administration, said the shuffling
represents a desire by the FDA to "concentrate on substances
that are the cause of chronic diseases." He added that the
problems resulting from deficiencies in the dropped
substances have largely disappeared as public health problems
in the U.S.</p>
<p>A spokesman for Quaker Oats Co., a Chicago-based maker of
cereals and other food products, said the company had been
expecting the changes. "We are strong proponents of providing
meaningful nutritional information. It sounds like these are
changes that are going to be beneficial," he said.</p>
<p>John Cady, president of the National Food Processors
Association, said his organization will study the proposal
"and we will hopefully suggest improvements that will result
in even better nutrition labeling to benefit consumers."</p>
<p>The new regulations would require nutritional labeling on
packaged food that is a "meaningful source" of calories, Dr.
Sullivan said. Fresh produce, seafood and other non-packaged
food companies would be allowed some flexibility in informing
consumers of nutritional value, including the use of
"point-of-purchase" methods such as posters and booklets.</p>
<p>The FDA also proposed to permit companies to display a
second label below the required one. The second label would
include a "nutritional profile" of certain food components as
a percentage of the daily recommended consumption of the
component. If the manufacturer used the profile, it would
have to include fat, saturated fatty acid, cholesterol,
carbohydrates, fiber and salt.</p>
<p>Exemptions to the proposed labeling requirements would be
allowed for restaurants, bakeries, individually packaged
"bite size" pieces of food and small businesses with annual
food sales of less than $500,000 a year.</p>
