	<p class="article-leader">CHICAGO -- Stone Container Corp. said banks are willing to
lend it an additional $400 million, an amount that could help
it ride out an earnings slump and repay other debt coming due
in September.
   Investors appeared to welcome Stone's announcement of
additional financing. The paper and packaging company's stock
closed at $17, up 87.5 cents, in New York Stock Exchange
composite trading.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Stone grew rapidly over the past five years, mostly by
making acquisitions with borrowed money. After its biggest
and most recent purchase, the $2.2 billion takeover of
Consolidated-Bathurst Inc. in 1989, Stone emerged as the
second-largest paper company in North America.</p>
<p>But Stone's business outlook has weakened this year amid a
general downturn in the paper industry, and the company
reported a 58% drop in first-quarter earnings. In recent
weeks, Wall Street analysts have been cutting their earnings
estimates for Stone "pretty severely," says Robert Schifini,
a researcher at Institutional/Brokers/Estimate/System.</p>
<p>Arnold Brookstone, Stone's chief financial officer, said
the new $400 million standby credit facility "isn't an
expression of any inability to make our payments. We are a
very conservative company. We believe in planning for
contingencies before anything happens."</p>
<p>In recent weeks, attention has focused on Stone's
scheduled repayment of its $2.6 billion in senior long-term
debt, much of which was taken on to pay for the
Consolidated-Bathurst acquisition. Although Stone has been
able to make interest payments with ease, it also is
obligated in September to repay $175 million of its bank
debt, with more repayments to follow.</p>
<p>The new credit facility, Mr. Brookstone said, provides an
additional possible source of cash to make its $175 million
debt repayment this year. He said the repayments could also
be made from operating cash flow or by temporarily borrowing
more money under a bank revolving-credit facility.</p>
