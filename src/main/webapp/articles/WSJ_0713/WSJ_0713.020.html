	<p class="article-leader">TOKYO -- Personal computer viruses, virtually unheard of a
few years ago in Japan, are spreading here, government and
industry officials fear.
   NEC Corp., Japan's largest PC maker, announced this week
that an unspecified number of its flagship 9800-series models
are infected with a "Christmas" virus that can wipe out
certain large application programs when the computer's
calendar reaches Dec. 25.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>In April, Sharp Corp. said a game program compatible with
its X-68000 PC was infected with a virus, and press reports
said about half the 3,000 programs sold were tainted. In May,
Fujitsu Ltd. discovered a virus in 20 on-site computers that
would become active on any Friday the 13th.</p>
<p>"Those three cases may be a warning," said Shinjuro Ogino,
director of the software technology center of the
government-affiliated Information-Technology Promotion
Agency. "I'm afraid there will be an increase of computer
viruses for Japanese personal computers."</p>
<p>Japan has lagged far behind other developed nations in
personal computer use, but sales are now taking off, and with
the growing popularity may come growing computer crime.</p>
<p>An agency survey of nearly 400 Japanese companies reported
only one virus complaint in 1986, two in 1987, and seven in
1988. But the survey showed 30 complaints in 1989, and six in
the first three months of 1990. Mr. Ogino said most of those
cases involved machines imported from the U.S., where viruses
are far more common. He said he worried that the recent
viruses may have targeted Japanese machines specifically.</p>
<p>Fujitsu and NEC said the cases announced this year were
the most serious they had ever found.</p>
<p>In the NEC virus, when the computer's calendar turns to
Dec. 25, the words "A Merry Christmas to You]" appear on the
screen, and applications larger than 30,720 bytes are
destroyed.</p>
<p>Sharp discovered two similar viruses in programs for the
computer game Farside Moon for its machines. One strain,
designed to turn on once a month beginning this month, is
supposed to destroy data on the floppy disk and could also
damage the machine's components, according to Japanese press
reports.</p>
<p>The Fujitsu virus gradually expands to fill the computer's
memory and prevent the PC's use. On a Friday the 13th, which
occurs this week, the application program is destroyed.</p>
<p>Spokesmen for Fujitsu and NEC said no damage had been
done. A Sharp spokesman couldn't be reached for comment.</p>
<p>"Software delivered by the software vendors or
manufacuters is okay," said a Fujitsu spokesman, but
"software is becoming more popular to share among colleauges,
so there's more possibility that the virus move from one PC
to another PC."</p>
<p>But an official in the Ministry of International Trade and
Industry who is following the issue said the number of
reported cases may be increasing simply because of greater
awareness. "I think in past days, people regarded some
trouble as bugs and not as a virus."</p>
