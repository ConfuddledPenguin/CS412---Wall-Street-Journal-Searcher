	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- The Securities and Exchange Commission, in
its first regulatory reaction to the collapse of Drexel
Burnham Lambert Inc., proposed rules that would force
brokerage firms to give regulators early warning of large
capital movements.
   The agency also voted to propose rules sharply limiting
the flexibility of money-market funds. The measure would
restrict the amount of lower-quality holdings by the funds,
which are held by 21 million investors for a total of $450
billion, according to SEC figures.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The brokerage proposal would revise the agency's so-called
net capital rule, which requires brokerage firms to keep
certain amounts of their assets liquid in case of emergency.
But the SEC is concerned that it has no requirement for
brokerage firms to notify regulators before moving large
amounts of capital. Chairman Richard Breeden called the plan
a "smoke detector" for major problems at brokerage firms.</p>
<p>That situation came into play earlier this year in the
collapse of Drexel. The parent company, desperately trying to
fend off a liquidity crunch caused by its junk-bond
portfolio, took several infusions of capital from its
brokerage subsidiary. As Drexel's crisis came to a head, the
firm tried to shift more capital to the parent, a move that
would have put the brokerage unit below the net capital
requirement.</p>
<p>The SEC blocked the move, citing a potential risk to the
brokerage system, and Drexel was forced to file for
bankruptcy-law protection.</p>
<p>Market regulation director Richard Ketchum said the agency
was concerned that a similar situation "may arise in other
broker-dealers, particularly those in a large holding-company
structure."</p>
<p>Yesterday's rule proposal would require brokerage firms to
notify the SEC two days before withdrawing certain levels of
net capital. The SEC would then have the authority to bar the
firm from making such a move. The rule also would create an
additional standard designed to limit capital withdrawals for
firms with large securities-trading positions.</p>
<p>The New York Stock Exchange already has proposed a warning
rule, but that proposal would simply require the exchange to
be notified within 24 hours after a shift of more than 20%
was made. "We don't think that's sufficient for the
commission," Mr. Ketchum said. "Some horses may have left the
barn."</p>
<p>The money-fund rule, which was expected, comes on the
heels of several recent defaults by issuers of commercial
paper, or short-term corporate borrowings. Money funds hold
huge amounts of commercial paper.</p>
<p>The proposal would require the funds' prospectus to
clearly state that the holdings aren't insured or guaranteed
by the federal government. Moreover, it would prohibit funds
from investing more than 5% of assets in securities of a
single issuer or in securities rated at less than the highest
quality. It would impose other restrictions on holdings as
well.</p>
<p>The rule would give "better assurances that safety
expectations of investors can be met," said Gene Gohlke,
acting director of investment management.</p>
<p>Commissioner Mary Schapiro expressed concern about the
quality of the rating agencies and wondered whether the SEC's
use of the term "high quality" could mislead investors.
Commissioner Philip Lochner said the rule could affect the
commercial-paper market by removing a major buyer. But agency
staffers said they thought it would have only a "minimal
effect" on the commercial-paper market.</p>
