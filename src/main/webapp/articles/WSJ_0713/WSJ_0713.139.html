	<p class="article-leader">Rank Organisation PLC, a major U.K. communications and
entertainment concern, said pretax profit for the half year
to May 12 increased 24%, though the company forecast growing
difficulties stemming from poor economic conditions in the
U.K. and the U.S.
   Pretax profit increased to #137.6 million ($247.7 million)
from #111 million. Market forecasts had ranged between #135
million and #138 million. Sales increased 17% to #522.2
million from #447.4 million.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Pretax profit from Rank Xerox, a joint venture between
Rank and Xerox Corp. of the U.S., rose 2.7% to #80 million
from #77.9 million. Fuji Xerox, located in Southeast Asia,
had a decline in profit to Rank caused by higher investment
in research and the development of products plus increases in
operating costs, said Rank.</p>
<p>The company said its proposed acquisition of Mecca
Leisure, a rival U.K. leisure concern, is "a major step
forward in Rank's leisure activities in Europe and the U.S.,"
which should be beneficial to all shareholders.</p>
