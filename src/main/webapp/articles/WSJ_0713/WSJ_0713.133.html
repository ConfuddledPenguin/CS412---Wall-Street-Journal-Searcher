	<p class="article-leader">Globe Investment Trust PLC recommended shareholders accept
a 205 pence ($3.69) a share offer for the company by British
Coal Corp.'s pension funds six days after the pension funds
succeeded in gaining majority control.
   Globe had strongly resisted the bid, which values
Britain's largest investment trust at #1.11 billion ($2
billion), since it was launched April 20.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>However, the pension funds' success in gaining majority
control "puts Globe in an entirely new situation," though it
still considers that "the offer price is too low," Globe
management said in a statement.</p>
<p>The pension funds said last week that they had purchased
or received acceptances of their offer for more than 50% of
Globe's ordinary shares. By late Tuesday the pension funds
claimed control of more than 70% of the shares.</p>
<p>The pension funds have said they intend to purchase 100%
of Globe shares.</p>
