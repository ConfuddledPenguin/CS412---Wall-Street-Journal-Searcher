	<p class="article-leader">TOKYO -- Japan's trade surplus for June surged, and some
economists say the politically sensitive trade surplus, which
has eased substantially since 1988, is likely to grow again
in coming months.
   The 28% increase in the June surplus, to $6.72 billion
from the year-earlier $5.27 billion, occurred despite a 10%
decrease in the bilateral surplus with the U.S. That was more
than offset by a 57% surge in Japan's surplus with other
Asian nations and a 4% increase in its surplus with the
European Community.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The overall June increase "puts the trade surplus back on
a rising path for the second half of the year," said Kermit
L. Schoenholtz, an economist with Salomon Brothers Inc. in
Tokyo. "I think we're getting exactly the kind of switch
toward exports and away from imports that you'd expect as a
result of 15 months of a soft yen." The lower value of the
yen makes imports to Japan more expensive while making the
price of Japanese exports more competitive on world markets.</p>
<p>The Ministry of Finance said exports during June rose 4.8%
to $23.76 billion from the year-earlier $22.68 billion,
marking the first year-to-year increase in nine months.
Imports, which had shown strong growth for most of the past
year, fell 2.2% to $17.04 billion from $17.42 billion.</p>
<p>Kenneth Courtis, a Tokyo-based economist for Deutsche Bank
AG, said the June figures also reflect strong growth in
Europe and "exploding" demand in Asia.</p>
<p>"Three to four years ago, if the U.S. had slowed down as
it has now, Japanese exports would have gone into the tank,"
Mr. Courtis said. But with Japan's total trade with Asian
nations having surpassed its total trade with the U.S. last
November, "there is a tripod structure in Japanese exports
that wasn't there in the past." Trade between Japan and the
rest of Asia during June totaled $12.27 billion, with
Japanese exports exceeding imports by $2.86 billion. By
comparison, two-way trade with the U.S. totaled $11.56
billion for the month.</p>
<p>Although the trade surplus with the U.S. continued to
shrink, to $3.25 billion from the year-earlier $3.62 billion,
that trend is likely to reverse during the second half of
1990, Mr. Schoenholtz said. "Concerns about that {imbalance}
aren't going to go away very soon," he said. Exports to the
U.S. in June fell 6.7%, to $7.4 billion from $7.93 billion,
while imports declined 3.7%, to $4.15 billion from $4.31
billion.</p>
<p>The U.S. and Japan last month agreed to take steps to
solve structural problems in both countries that are believed
to contribute to the trade imbalance. But any sustained
widening of Japan's bilateral surplus could once again fuel
political pressures for protectionism in the U.S.</p>
<p>Some economists, however, predict Japan's surpluses will
continue to shrink gradually over the long term -- even if
they do rise again during the next few months. In the short
term, the surplus "won't shoot up the way it did in the
past," said Nobuyuki Ueda of the Long-Term Credit Bank of
Japan. And over the next four or five years, he said,
structural factors such as increased overseas production by
Japanese companies should bring the surplus down -- at least
as a percentage of the nation's total output.</p>
<p>The June figures leave Japan's surplus for the first half
of 1990 at $25.79 billion, shrinking 23% from $33.39 billion
in the year-ago period. Exports for the six months declined
1.4%, to $133.94 billion from $135.83 billion, while imports
rose 5.6%, to $108.15 billion from $102.43 billion.</p>
<p>After seasonal factors were taken into account, the June
surplus stood at $6.92 billion -- more than double the $3.39
billion figure for May. Adjusted exports rose 10.9% to $23.85
billion, while imports dropped 6.6% to $16.93 billion.</p>
<p>Mr. Schoenholtz said the monthly trade surplus is unlikely
to stay as high as the June figure in the next few months,
but he predicted it would "rise on average toward $6 billion"
-- substantially above the average levels of recent months.</p>
