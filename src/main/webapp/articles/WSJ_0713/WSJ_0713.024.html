	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Standard & Poor's Corp. affirmed its double-A
rating on $2.8 billion of Connecticut's general obligation
bonds outstanding and also assigned a double-A rating to the
state's $325 million of general obligation bonds Series 1990B
due 1991-2010.
   The move reflects the state's "fundamentally strong
economic base, well above-average wealth levels, a rising but
manageable debt burden and historically solid but weakened
financial posture," the rating concern said. "Economic
sluggishness and revenue shortfalls in the sales and
corporate taxes occurred throughout fiscal 1990."</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>S&P estimates Connecticut closed the fiscal year ended
June 30 with a $129 million budget deficit. The fiscal 1991
budget, reflecting the carry-over, is now $185 million in the
red.</p>
<p>The rating concern expects Connecticut to close the gap,
however. "The fiscal year's just starting, so they've got
plenty of time," says Sally Rutherford, analyst at S&P. She
added, "It might be politically easier" to deal with the
budget gap "after the elections."</p>
<p>"The magnitude" of Connecticut's problems remains
"manageable, and the state's other primary credit factors
remain intact," S&P said.</p>
<p>Gov. William O'Neill's office declined to comment. Anthony
V. Milano, secretary of the Office of Policy and Management,
the state's budget arm, was unavailable for comment.</p>
