	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- The Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed to
its all-time high as stock prices surged again amid the
heaviest trading since mid-May.
   Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan's statement to
Congress that the central bank is poised to ease monetary
policy as the result of tightening in the credit markets set
the rally in motion at midday.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>After climbing 41.83 points Wednesday, the industrial
average soared 37.13 points to 2969.80 -- well above the
prior high of 2935.89, set June 15.</p>
<p>Oil stocks rallied sharply for the second consecutive
session as oil prices continued to climb, reflecting further
evidence that members of OPEC are taking steps to curb
overproduction. Telephone and cellular stocks, bolstered by
news that GTE and Contel had agreed to a stock-swap merger,
also paced the latest advance.</p>
<p>Buying interest carried over from Wednesday boosted share
prices in early trading, but the market drifted through the
morning and showed only a modest gain before news of Mr.
Greenspan's congressional testimony filtered into the market.</p>
<p>The remarks "kick-started the market a bit," said Jeffrey
Kaminsky, head of block trading at Mabon, Nugent & Co. Prices
rose steadily through the afternoon, and program buying
resulting from stock-index arbitrage surfaced in the last
hour of trading to add fuel to the rally.</p>
<p>Some 211,510,000 shares were traded on the New York Stock
Exchange -- the highest total since May 14, when 225.4
million changed hands, and up from 162.2 million Wednesday.
Big Board advancers topped decliners 987 to 545.</p>
<p>Broader measures weren't able to follow the lead of the
Dow industrials and establish records, although they did rise
sharply. Standard & Poor's 500-Stock Index climbed 4.21 to
365.44, the New York Stock Exchange Composite Index gained
2.21 to 199.32 and the Dow Jones Equity Market Index went up
3.83 to 339.62; all three set records June 4.</p>
<p>Index-arbitrage buy programs -- purchasing baskets of
stocks and selling index futures to profit from fleeting
price differences between them -- helped ignite the market's
midday advance and push prices to session highs shortly
before the close.</p>
<p>But Mabon Nugent's Jeffrey Kaminsky said the especially
heavy volume provided evidence that "real buying," or trading
unrelated to index arbitrage, powered the market's advance.
"You've got an ample amount of cash" in the hands of
institutions that are "willing to commit" to stocks, he said.</p>
<p>Contel soared 7 1/8 to 35 1/8 in Big Board composite
trading of 4.9 million shares, while GTE fell 1 1/4 to 29 3/4
as 6.6 million shares changed hands. Terms of the transaction
call for GTE to exchange 1.27 of its common shares for each
Contel share.</p>
<p>The proposed merger represents "the first major
indication" that the telephone industry may be heading for a
big wave of consolidation, Jack Grubman, an analyst at
PaineWebber, said. Also, he said, the market has "grossly
undervalued" telephone properties when their cash flows and
access-line values are taken into account.</p>
<p>Among telephone and cellular stocks traded on the Big
Board, Centel added 2 1/4 to 36 7/8, Century Telephone
Enterprises advanced 2 3/4 to 30, Southern New England
Telecommunications rose 2 1/2 to 35 5/8, Rochester Telephone
jumped 3 to 34 3/4 and Alltel added 1 to 33. Telephone & Data
Systems gained 1 7/8 to 38 1/4 and Metro Mobile Class B added
1 3/8 to 18 1/2 on the American Stock Exchange.</p>
<p>Nynex, another telephone stock, fell 1 1/8 to 78 5/8.
Evidence has surfaced in a rate case involving its New York
Telephone unit that the company's buyers and suppliers had
improper, if not illegal, contacts at a series of gatherings
between 1984 and 1988, this newspaper reported.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, oil stocks rallied amid news from Saudi Arabian
oil minister Hisham Nazer that the United Arab Emirates has
agreed to a production quota of 1.5 million barrels a day set
by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries. August
crude-oil futures jumped 99 cents a barrel in New York
trading, to $18.46.</p>
<p>Unocal, which paced Wednesday's rally in oil issues,
gained another 2 to 29 3/4 on 1.6 million shares. PaineWebber
upgraded its investment rating on the stock to "buy" from
"neutral."</p>
<p>Four other oil stocks contributed to the surge in the
industrial average: Exxon, which went up 1 3/8 to 49 1/4;
Chevron, up 2 7/8 to 73 7/8; Texaco, up 2 1/8 to 60 1/8, and
Du Pont, parent of Conoco, up 1 1/2 to 39 7/8.</p>
<p>Oil field-services issues jumped even more sharply in
relative terms. Schlumberger rose 2 5/8 to 60 1/4, Baker
Hughes gained 1 5/8 to 29 3/8, Dresser Industries advanced 2
to 51, Halliburton rose 1 1/2 to 49 1/4 and Rowan gained 1
1/8 to 13.</p>
<p>Although Mr. Greenspan's comments on monetary policy
lifted the broad market, his disclosure that the Fed is
developing additional capital requirements for commercial
banks weighed on banking issues.</p>
<p>Chase Manhattan dropped 7/8 to 22 1/2 on 1.4 million
shares, and other major-city bank issues also dropped
following news that federal regulators had ordered U.S. banks
to write off 20% of their loans to Argentina and Brazil.
Citicorp dropped 1/4 to 21 5/8, Manufacturers Hanover went
down 7/8 to 31 3/4 and Chemical Banking lost 1/2 to 24 3/8.</p>
<p>Computer Associates International, the most active Big
Board issue, plunged 6 1/4 to 10 1/4 on eight million shares
amid disappointment with its earnings estimate for the June
quarter. The company said revenue for the period appeared to
be "significantly less than last year's comparable quarter
and, consequently, earnings may also be lower."</p>
<p>Kimberly-Clark, on the other hand, soared 4 5/8 to 82 1/4
as its second-quarter earnings drew an enthusiastic market
response. Although net income fell 21% from the year-ago
period, a $44 million charge related to the pending sale of a
Canadian unit more than accounted for the decline.</p>
<p>The Amex Market Value Index rose 2.82 to 362.23. Volume
totaled 16,890,000 shares.</p>
