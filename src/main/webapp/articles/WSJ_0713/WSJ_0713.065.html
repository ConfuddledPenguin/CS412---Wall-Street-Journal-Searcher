	<p class="article-leader">ATLANTA -- Putting a Burger King twist on the news, Cable
News Network is telling late-night viewers: "Have it your
way."
   In a first for television news, viewers of CNN's midnight
newscast later this month will be able to vote for some of
the news stories they want to watch by dialing a 900 number.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The so-called viewer-interactive newscasts, on its
Newsnight program, will open with the top six stories of the
day in 25-to-30-second summaries. In the next five minutes or
so, late-night couch potatoes can dial the 900 number and,
for 95 cents a call, make their picks.</p>
<p>CNN will then run the top vote-getting story, which may be
several minutes long, in the first half of the hour-long
show, and the runner-up during the second half.</p>
<p>"The viewer votes right now with a (remote) control
device," said Joshua Loory, Newsnight's executive producer.
"If there's a story on the air that they're not interested
in, they're gone before you know it."</p>
<p>Some media industry people were unenthused. "I'm glad I'm
retired," said Reuven Frank, a former NBC News president, on
hearing CNN's plans. "It's an abdication of their
professional responsibility" to judge what is important for
the audience to know and to present it in an interesting way,
he said.</p>
<p>CNN, a unit of Turner Broadcasting System Inc., disagrees.
"We are still going to produce the majority of the newscast.
But we're going to give our viewers a choice on two stories,"
Mr. Loory said.</p>
<p>Others believe the public may gyp itself, by voting
against important stories and gravitating to the less
hard-hitting ones -- like the recent CNN feature on the
Alabama store that buys lost luggage from airlines and
resells it to shoppers. Or the gripping piece on the health
dangers of tying a necktie too tight.</p>
<p>If the vote-TV approach works, said Sanford Socolow, a
former executive producer for CBS Evening News, "every local
station in the country will pull something like this." He
added: "If you've got a limited news budget, which most
(local) stations do, and you have one story on city hall and
another on some bear loose in the woods, it's sad, but
understandable, that people will want to hear about the
bear."</p>
<p>For his part, Mr. Loory says he isn't certain which
direction Newsnight's viewers, in some 260,000 households,
will take. But "my gut tells me they'll go after some of the
harder stories," he said.</p>
<p>The whole idea was the outgrowth of the 900 telephone
polls that have become popular on television news shows. Some
recent Newsnight polls have focused on AIDS, civil rights and
controversial rap groups. The show even used its 900 poll
once to ask viewers if 900 polls had gotten out of hand. Some
60% said yes.</p>
<p>The 900 phone number approach to news selection bothers
Lawrence K. Grossman, senior fellow at the Gannett Center for
Media Studies and a former president of NBC News. A special
interest group, he said, could organize a 900 number campaign
and distort the presentation of the news.</p>
<p>And although NBC Nightly News doesn't have any plans to
copy the new CNN format, the network show's executive
producer, Steve Friedman, said, "It's kind of interesting and
fun. It's democracy in action."</p>
