	<p class="article-leader">HOLLYWOOD -- Ricardo Mestres's office, all cool black
marble and stark white walls, feels eerily unlived in, though
he's toiled there for a year and a half.
   The movie company he heads, Hollywood Pictures, has itself
been a blank slate since it was formed by Walt Disney Co. in
February 1989 to boost the company's output by 10 to 12 films
a year. But with the release next week of "Arachnophobia,"
Hollywood Pictures will start to become more than a flashy
logo and silent partner to its sister Touchstone label.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Forming the new unit was a risky move, since bifurcated
studios generally haven't worked before. And Hollywood
Pictures nominally has the same franchise as Touchstone:
light, bright entertainment with few rough edges and
ruthlessly contained costs.</p>
<p>But Disney officials were intent on increasing output
without yielding control to outside production companies. And
they dismissed the idea of expanding Touchstone. "Movies get
made on a pyramid basis," says Jeffrey Katzenberg, chairman
of Walt Disney Studios, who supervises both Touchstone and
Hollywood Pictures. "The critical decisions are made by two,
three and four people at the top. The notion that building a
bigger pyramid to make more product of more quality had never
worked before. We set out to build two separate pyramids."</p>
<p>"Arachnophobia," about a small town terrorized by killer
spiders, appears likely to lay a solid foundation for the new
venture. Mr. Mestres, though only 32 years old, has been a
studio executive long enough to know that the movie isn't a
sure thing. But the response at previews has been strong:
Teen-agers at one screening mobbed the scriptwriter, Don
Jakoby, for autographs. "I realized my name didn't mean
anything," a shell-shocked Mr. Jakoby said the next day, so
he included the film title in his inscriptions.</p>
<p>At another screening, Mr. Katzenberg emerged and clapped
Mr. Jakoby on the back. "If you aren't happy right now," Mr.
Jakoby remembers him saying, "you better go off and write
poetry." Mr. Jakoby recently signed on with a new agent known
for conducting "auctions" that have been winning writers
million-dollar fees.</p>
<p>Of predictions that the movie will be one of the summer's
big hits, Mr. Mestres, ever controlled, says only: "I hope
so, I hope so."</p>
<p>Hollywood Pictures is aiming to be a major presence in the
film industry, with three pictures this year, six to eight
next year and up to a dozen in 1992. But it isn't clear how
the unit will distinguish itself from its sibling. "The
Touchstone experience has to be the template of this
company," says Mr. Mestres.</p>
<p>At Touchstone, brooding artiness or shoot-'em-up action
pictures are rare, and most film makers are kept on a tight
leash. Critics complain this approach gives some films a
pandering, middle-of-the-road feel, but for others -- unique
genre pictures such as "Honey, I Shrunk the Kids" and perhaps
"Arachnophobia" -- it turns difficult ideas into crisp,
streamlined movies.</p>
<p>The formula has worked: Disney films, including
Touchstone, led all studios in market share two years ago,
were a respectable third last year and are first so far this
year. Touchstone, with which Hollywood Pictures shares
distribution and marketing, tends not to spend money on big
stars -- it built its franchise by resurrecting the careers
of such actors as Richard Dreyfuss and Bette Midler.
Hollywood Pictures, which has signed Tom Selleck, Goldie Hawn
and Angela Lansbury, will be no different.</p>
<p>"Arachnophobia" stars Jeff Daniels and John Goodman and,
even with a lot of special effects, cost about $25 million.
The second Hollywood Pictures film, "Taking Care of
Business," stars Charles Grodin and Jim Belushi; the third is
"Run" with Patrick Dempsey; then "The Marrying Man," an
original screenplay by Neil Simon, starring Kim Basinger and
Alec Baldwin. "We have no mandate," Mr. Mestres says, "other
than volume and quality."</p>
<p>Disney's thinking in starting the new division was that
with increasing consolidation in the business, rising costs
and the demise of many independent producers, the volume of
motion pictures had shrunk drastically. At the same time,
multiplex cinemas were proliferating -- the number of screens
across the country increased by nearly one-third in the '80s.
Keeping the pipeline full was an obvious goal.</p>
<p>Other studios such as Warner Bros. and Columbia Pictures
were distributing up to 40 films a year, but many of those
were developed and produced outside the studios. Disney
generally shuns such "pickups" -- it likes to control its
product -- and because much of Disney films' production costs
are financed by limited partnerships, the risks to the
company are reduced.</p>
<p>For now, Hollywood Pictures' only defining characteristic
is the tenacious, button-down personality of Mr. Mestres.
"He's very dry, literal and professional," says an agent. "He
could be from Brown Brothers Harriman."</p>
<p>Indeed, Mr. Mestres is the son of a Sullivan & Cromwell
lawyer. He attended Exeter and Harvard, then moved right to
Hollywood. "I knew exactly what I wanted to do," he says, and
he did it quickly. He wrote to Don Simpson, then the
production chief at Paramount, and just a few months after
graduation, he became an executive there. Mr. Katzenberg, his
first boss at Paramount, calls him "maniacally focused and
extremely well-organized. When you have a lot of balls in the
air, you can't help but have some fall through the cracks.
With Ricardo, there are no cracks." When Mr. Katzenberg and
Disney Chairman Michael Eisner left Paramount for Disney, Mr.
Mestres went with them.</p>
<p>Mr. Mestres worked with Touchstone President David
Hoberman on such films as "Outrageous Fortune, "Three Men and
a Baby" and "Good Morning, Vietnam," and it was widely
believed that the ambitious pair couldn't coexist for long.
Mr. Mestres won't comment.</p>
<p>Without the creation of the new unit, "you can feel
confident that a piece of manpower like Ricardo would have
been gone in a minute," says producer Robert W. Cort of
Interscope Productions, which is producing several movies for
Hollywood Pictures.</p>
<p>Mr. Hoberman and Mr. Mestres defer to each other when they
begin pursuing the same projects. On "The Hand that Rocks the
Cradle," a suspense thriller about a woman who poses as a
nanny to take revenge on a family, Touchstone was interested,
but stepped back. Another Hollywood Pictures project, "Hell
Bent . . . and Back," is a World War II ensemble picture
about a mission behind enemy lines. It's the kind of action
movie Touchstone hasn't tried.</p>
<p>"Arachnophobia" didn't even come to Hollywood Pictures
until May 1989, when the little-known Mr. Jakoby finished the
script and agent Phil Gersh held a miniauction. Mr. Mestres
had put out the word that he was looking for a sophisticated
horror film, something like "The Exorcist" (though
"Arachnophobia" came out like a comedy version of "Jaws" or
"The Birds"). Mr. Gersh sent the script to Mr. Mestres at 5
p.m. on a Friday, and the next day Mr. Mestres began
peppering him with phone calls. Mr. Gersh stalled, waiting to
sift other offers, but Hollywood Pictures' persistence paid
off, helped somewhat by the fact that Mr. Jakoby knew Disney
wouldn't make a "B" horror film.</p>
<p>Frank Marshall from Steven Spielberg's Amblin
Entertainment stepped forward to direct the movie. A
heavyweight producer in the role of director for the first
time, Mr. Marshall had to balance the laughter and chills,
and the film has the feel of a heavily managed picture that
actually benefits from all the attention. Amblin took control
of the movie, and when Disney executives wondered whether the
title of the movie was too obscure and suggested "Along Came
a Spider," Mr. Marshall responded, "When they made `Jaws,'
did they call it `Along Came a Shark'?" Was it also to avoid
having "spider" in the title, which might put off some
arachnophobics? Mr. Mestres just smiles.</p>
