	<p class="article-leader">PARIS -- Airbus Industrie said the French charter carrier
Euralair upgraded previously announced commitments for two of
the European aircraft consortium's A-321 jets into two firm
orders and an option on one additional plane. Financial
details weren't disclosed, but people in the industry
estimate an A-321's price at about $40 million.
   Airbus, based in Toulouse, said the planes will be
delivered in the spring of 1995 and used on flights to
Mediterranean resorts. Each plane will be equipped to seat
about 200 passengers in an all-economy layout. Airbus said
Euralair hadn't made an engine choice.</p>
