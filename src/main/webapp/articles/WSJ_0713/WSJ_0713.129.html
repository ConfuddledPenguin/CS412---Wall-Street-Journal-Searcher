	<p class="article-leader">Hawker Siddeley Group PLC, a British electrical and
mechanical engineering concern, warned that its 1990 profit
figures will fall short of 1989 figures.
   Its 1989 pretax profit was #202.1 million ($363.6 million)
and sales were #2.15 billion. Hawker Siddeley shares fell 62
pence to 548 pence on the London Stock Exchange. Turnover
amounted to a robust 5.4 million shares.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The company said that the "deterioration" is mostly due to
a situation at its electrical power contracting business, the
Hawker Siddeley Power Engineering unit, where an
investigation disclosed an estimated loss for 1990 of between
#25 million and #30 million, the company said.</p>
<p>The losses were caused by cost overruns that arose when
the unit became overextended by rapid expansion in 1988 on
projects due for completion in 1990, the company said.</p>
<p>But the company said that measures have been taken to
correct the project-control problems and that the unit's
capacity hasn't been damaged.</p>
