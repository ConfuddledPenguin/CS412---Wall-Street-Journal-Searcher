	<p class="article-leader">Six years ago, when Britain's National Union of
Mineworkers was locked in a 12-month, life-and-death struggle
with Margaret Thatcher, Soviet propagandists made a big thing
of the sacrifices of Soviet workers on behalf of the
beleaguered Brits. Wives were hocking wedding rings to
finance bundles for Britain, according to Novosti
tale-spinners.
   It didn't help much. In March 1985, the NUM conceded
defeat. Mrs. Thatcher had proved that she would not buckle
under to strikers. But you would think that the NUM would
remain grateful to Soviet wokers nonetheless, wouldn't you?
Read on.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Now it is Soviet miners who are striking. New unions have
sprung up outside the government-controlled syndicates to
protest pay and working conditions, blaming mainly the Soviet
Communist Party. Representatives of two such unions are in
Britain this week seeking support. They are having some
success. But all they've received from NUM President Arthur
Scargill is the back of his hand. Yuri Butchenko, of the
Union of Workers in the Kuzbass region of Western Siberia,
and Sergei Masalovitch, a miner representing a group called
the Trade and Professional Union, say the NUM even refuses to
meet with them.</p>
<p>None of this comes as any surprise to longtime watchers of
Mr. Scargill and the NUM. The British mine leader prefers to
do business with the Soviet establishment. Indeed the NUM
took a position against one of the early labor rebels in
Ukraine, Vladimir Klebanov. Mr. Klebanov's effort to set up
an independent labor union in 1977 convinced the Soviet
authorities that he must surely be mad. He was sent to a
psychiatric hospital, which was then a favorite Soviet method
of dealing with dissidents.</p>
<p>But now we are learning more about why the NUM might have
chosen to uphold a regime that was savaging a working man. An
inquiry by Queen's Counsel Gavin Lightman into the Soviet aid
Mr. Scargill received in 1985 has just produced some
interesting findings. It says that a large chunk, some $1
million, never got to the British miners at all. Instead it
went to the "Miners Trade Union International," which later
became part of something called the International Miners
Organization (IMO) in Paris.</p>
<p>Mr. Scargill has always liked Paris. He spent some time
there in October 1984 trying to arrange help from Col.
Gadhafi of Libya and the Hungarian Communists, as well as
from the Russians. Exactly what the IMO does with its
bankroll isn't entirely clear, but it seems likely, according
to knowledgeable sources, that it seldom has done anything
the Kremlin would not approve of.</p>
<p>Mr. Lightman seems to think that by diverting the Soviet
funds away from the uses intended, Mr. Scargill had
"committed a breach of duty of the most serious character."
The NUM leader managed, with grandiose oratory, to whip up
some support at the NUM annual conference this week. But not
all members are pleased with his answers to the charges. At
last report, some were talking about seeking legal advice on
how to recover the money that went to the IMO.</p>
<p>One question is to what extent Mr. Scargill ever had
control of the money. This is of interest to Mr. Butchenko
and Mr. Masalovitch. They know that money to aid the British
strikers was indeed collected from Soviet miners. The
government unions took one day's pay from each miner, they
say, and that could have amounted to as much as 20 million
rubles. The official claim was that only two million rubles
were collected.</p>
<p>At any rate, the Russian miners as well are learning that
much of their money never got to the British miners. They
also know that the NUM is not their friend. So there is
solidarity among many Soviet and British miners on one thing.
A lot of them are wondering if they were victims of a
colossal scam. That just might possibly be the case.</p>
