	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- The Securities and Exchange Commission,
stepping up a long-running feud, sued penny-stock firm
Blinder, Robinson & Co. and Chairman Meyer Blinder for $20
million in profit allegedly gained through illegal stock
activity.
   The agency, in federal court in Philadelphia, charged
Blinder, Robinson with "charging excessive and undisclosed
markups" in nearly 30,000 retail transactions involving more
than one billion shares. The firm also was charged with
telling customers that prices quoted were the market price
"without disclosing to those customers that Blinder, Robinson
dominated the markets" for the stocks.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>In filing the civil suit, the SEC is again going after an
old foe. While the agency won an injunction against Mr.
Blinder and the firm in 1982, it has had difficulty making
charges against the firm stick in the past few years.</p>
<p>In 1985, an SEC administrative law judge ruled that the
firm and its chairman violated securities laws in a 1980
stock underwriting, and the commission concurred in 1986. But
Blinder, Robinson appealed that decision to a federal appeals
court panel, which said the SEC hadn't considered all the
evidence and sent the case back to the administrative law
judge.</p>
<p>So last month, a second SEC law judge considered the case
and once again hit Mr. Blinder and the firm, this time with a
45-day suspension for the chairman and a two-year
underwriting ban for the firm. The official also barred Mr.
Blinder from associating with any securities firm for two
years. That ruling is now on appeal to the commission.</p>
<p>In its latest suit, the SEC charged that between June 1985
and at least February 1987, the firm charged customers as
much as 140% above prevailing market prices -- well above the
10% limit allowed by law. The agency said Blinder, Robinson
overcharged customers in more than 99.7% of the nearly 30,000
trades.</p>
<p>The SEC said that Mr. Blinder aided the firm's violations
of securities law by directly or indirectly authorizing the
firm to take the abusive steps. During the time cited by the
SEC, Mr. Blinder owned more than half of Intercontinental
Enterprises, which owned all of Blinder, Robinson.
Intercontinental also was charged by the SEC in the case.</p>
<p>David Becker, a partner at Blinder, Robinson's law firm,
Wilmer, Cutler & Pickering, said the SEC has continually used
a different standard for bringing cases against penny-stock
firms than those for more conventional Wall Street firms.</p>
<p>"The penny-stock area is obviously one that is somewhat
controversial," he said, "and because of that the commission
does not subject its theories to the same rigorous analysis
that it does in other cases. Some of the theories the
commission has employed are just wrong." He added, however,
that he hadn't read the latest SEC complaint and couldn't
comment on specifics.</p>
<p>But the SEC clearly shows no signs of backing down against
the Englewood, Colo., firm, which was once the nation's
largest penny-stock promoter. In a detailed complaint, the
agency said that Blinder, Robinson "knowingly and recklessly
engaged in an unlawful scheme to mislead and defraud"
customers by selling them more than one billion shares in 12
"shell" companies.</p>
<p>The SEC said that the firm garnered more than $20 million
of profit through excessive markups; that it bought stock in
the 12 companies while participating in distribution of the
issues, and that it made "implied representations" to
customers that the price at which Blinder was offering the
shares was the market price even though Blinder "dominated
the markets" for the stocks.</p>
