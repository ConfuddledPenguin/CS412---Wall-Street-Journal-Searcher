	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Emigrant Savings Bank filed with the Federal
Deposit Insurance Corp. for permission to raise its 9.9%
stake in Greater New York Savings Bank to not more than 25%
and for a change of control in Greater New York.
   The filing said Emigrant is considering ways to increase
Greater New York's share price. But it added that neither
Emigrant nor its owners, Seymour and Paul Milstein, have any
current plans that would result in a merger, reorganization
or liquidation of Greater New York, nor any plans to change
the board of directors or the management of the company.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>A spokesman for Greater New York said it is studying the
regulatory filing and will make "an appropriate response" to
regulatory authorities. Officials of Emigrant didn't return
telephone calls.</p>
<p>In January 1989, Greater New York rejected an offer by
Emigrant to purchase the 90.1% of the stock it didn't own for
$16 a share, or about $182 million. At the time, Greater New
York officials said the offer "represents a thinly disguised
attempt by Emigrant to have its 9.9% position in our stock
bought out after having put us into play. We won't be
manipulated and expect that the market won't be fooled."</p>
<p>Since then, Greater New York has adopted a shareholder
rights plan and a leveraged employee stock ownership plan,
both aimed at deterring hostile takeover bids.</p>
<p>In national over-the-counter trading yesterday, Greater
New York closed at $6.25, up $1.125.</p>
