second quarter rose 23% to $124.4 million, or $1.56 a share,
before a one-time charge.
   The charge of $44 million, or 55 cents a share, was
related to the pending sale of a Canadian unit, Spruce Falls
Power & Paper Co. The charge caused net income to decline 21%
to $80.5 million, or $1.01 a share, from $101.3 million, or
$1.26 a share, a year earlier.</p>
