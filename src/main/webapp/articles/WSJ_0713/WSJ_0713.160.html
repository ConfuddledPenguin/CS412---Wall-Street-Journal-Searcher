	<p class="article-leader">Apple Computer Inc., Cupertino, Calif., lobbed another
volley in the font wars by agreeing to allow Bitstream Inc.
to sell Apple's font technology, programs that determine how
computers represent text on computer screens and printers.
   Apple is trying to win converts to its font software from
Adobe Systems Inc., the leader of the market for font
software, which is essential in desktop publishing. Apple,
one of Adobe's biggest customers, caused a stir in the
personal-computer world last year when it and Microsoft Corp.
announced they would offer a product rivaling Adobe's
Postscript font software.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Apple's agreement with Bitstream will allow Bitstream to
license Apple's font product, called TrueType, to hundreds
manufacturers and software developers. Bitstream, a
Cambridge, Mass., software concern, now licenses fonts to
more than 370 companies around the world. Apple said it hopes
to "extend the reach" of TrueType in the personal-computer
market.</p>
