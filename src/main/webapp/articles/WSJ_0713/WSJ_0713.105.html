	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady told a
Senate panel that if Congress approves a proposal to shift
oversight of stock-index futures to securities regulators, he
wouldn't seek additional shifts of futures regulation.
   "I will oppose more sweeping changes to {Commodity Futures
Trading Commission} authority if the administration's bill
passes in its present form," he said at a Senate Banking
Committee hearing.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The statement was an apparent effort by Mr. Brady to
assuage fears of the futures industry and some legislators
that a Bush administration proposal to switch index futures
is simply a prelude to a broader effort to pillage CFTC
authority.</p>
<p>The proposal would move oversight of stock-index futures
from the CFTC to the Securities and Exchange Commission,
which currently regulates stocks and options. Stock-index
futures, which are frequently part of computerized program
trades, are used by institutional investors to hedge risk in
the stock market by allowing investors to bet on the movement
of a basket of stocks without buying the actual shares.</p>
<p>The administration would like to see the proposal move as
an amendment to the CFTC reauthorization bill, and senators
in favor of the White House measure have held up the CFTC
bill. But speculation surfaced yesterday that Sen. Patrick
Leahy (D., Vt.), who heads the Senate Agriculture Committee,
may try to attach the CFTC bill to the farm bill that will
move through the Senate in the next week or so.</p>
<p>While aides close to the senator said he hasn't considered
such a move, he has expressed dismay over the delay in the
CFTC measure.</p>
