	<p class="article-leader">First Union Corp. said second-quarter earnings rose 5.7%
to $78 million, or 72 cents a share, reflecting an increase
in net interest income.
   In the year-earlier period, the Charlotte, N.C., banking
company had net income of $74 million, or 69 cents a share.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>First Union said the most recent quarter included an
after-tax gain of $7 million from the divestiture of 13
branches in Florida. The gain was offset by an addition of an
equivalent amount to the allowance for loan losses. The 1989
second quarter included after-tax gains of $2 million from
the sale of investment securities.</p>
<p>Net interest income increased 20% to $352 million from
$293 million in the 1989 second quarter. Meanwhile,
nonperforming assets at the end of the most recent quarter
totaled $616 million, an increase of $114 million from the
end of the 1990 first quarter. Of the increase, $15 million
resulted from a special exam by the comptroller of the
currency. At the end of the 1989 second quarter, First Union
had nonperforming assets of $247 million.</p>
<p>In the first half, First Union said earnings rose 2.3% to
$149.2 million, or $1.39 a share, from $145.9 million, or
$1.37 a share, a year earlier.</p>
