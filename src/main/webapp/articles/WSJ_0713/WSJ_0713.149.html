	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Standard & Poor's Corp. lowered its rating on
$1.1 billion of Bank of New York Co.'s long-term and
short-term debt and preferred stock, citing its exposure to
highly leveraged transactions and rising levels of problem
loans.
   Bank of New York's senior debt was reduced to
single-A-minus from single-A. The subordinated debt fell to
triple-B-plus from single A-minus. The preferred stock
slipped to triple-B from triple-B-plus, and commercial paper
went to A2 from A1.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>A Bank of New York spokesman said, "We are obviously
disappointed by S&P's action, and we will work with them to
get our rating upgraded."</p>
