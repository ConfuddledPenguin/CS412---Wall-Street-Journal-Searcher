	<p class="article-leader">Curtiss-Wright Corp., signaling "a clear break from the
past" less than four months after the death of T. Roland
Berner, declared a special dividend of $30 a share and
pledged to focus on manufacturing operations rather than an
investment portfolio.
   The thinly traded shares moved up sharply on the news and
closed yesterday in New York Stock Exchange composite trading
at $69, up $5.75. Volume was only 22,700 shares; about five
million are outstanding, giving the special payout an
aggregate value of about $150.5 million.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The March death of Mr. Berner, the company's longtime
chairman, sparked speculation that part or all of
Curtiss-Wright would be sold. And in late March the company
said it had received "a memorandum" from an agent claiming to
represent a possible bidder.</p>
<p>But Chairman Shirley D. Brinsfield, who succeeded Mr.
Berner, has repeatedly said the company has no interest in
being acquired or in selling operations. Some companies, such
as Union Carbide Corp., have paid huge special dividends to
make themselves less attractive to raiders.</p>
<p>However, a Curtiss-Wright spokesman said the company's
special dividend isn't connected with any concern about a
possible takeover. No bidder ever materialized after the
March memorandum, which the company now thinks was frivolous,
he said.</p>
<p>The company, based in Lyndhurst, N.J., said the dividend
-- no part of which represents a return of capital -- is
payable Aug. 15 to shares of record Aug. 1.</p>
<p>The biggest beneficiary of the pay-out will be Unitrin
Inc., a Los Angeles insurance company formerly owned by
Teledyne Inc. Unitrin owns about 2.2 million Curtiss-Wright
shares, a 44% stake. Its share of the pay-out will be $63.2
million. Unitrin shares rose 50 cents in heavy
over-the-counter trading to close at $34.</p>
<p>Curtiss-Wright, which makes precision parts used in
aerospace, flow-control and other industrial applications,
reported 1989 net income of $30.4 million, or $6.09 a share,
on sales of $187.1 million. But of the $37.3 million that the
company earned before taxes and extraordinary credits, some
$10.9 million came from interest, dividends and investment
transactions.</p>
<p>The company warned that "earnings from interest and
dividends will no longer be realized on the substantial funds
used to pay the special dividend."</p>
<p>Even so, one of the few securities analysts who follow the
company said Curtiss-Wright will be more attractive to
investors after the dividend. Edward B. Keaney, director of
research at Pauli & Co. in St. Louis, said Curtiss-Wright
under Mr. Berner long confused investors with a whirl of
investment activity that complicated its earnings picture.
Mr. Berner, he said, compounded the problem by refusing to
talk to analysts.</p>
