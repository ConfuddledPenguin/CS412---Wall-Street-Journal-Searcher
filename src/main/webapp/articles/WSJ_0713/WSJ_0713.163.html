	<p class="article-leader">Accor S.A., a French hotel, catering and tourism company,
announced a definitive agreement to buy Motel 6 L.P. of
Dallas for $22.50 a unit, or nearly $1.3 billion.
   The acquisition will make Accor one of the world's largest
lodging companies, operating hotels and motels with more than
160,000 rooms. Accor already operates Sofitel and Novotel
hotels, as well as Formula 1 motels in Europe.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The transaction also means a windfall for Kohlberg Kravis
Roberts & Co., which owns more than 50% of Motel 6 through
various partnerships. KKR acquired Motel 6 in 1985 for $125
million in equity and $756 million in debt. It said it
expects to cash out with an annualized profit of 38% on its
investment.</p>
<p>Accor said that no later than Wednesday, it will begin a
tender offer for Motel 6's more than 55 million fully diluted
limited partnership interests. Accor said its deal is fully
financed. It also said Motel 6's existing $1 billion of debt
will be left outstanding. Including Motel 6's debt, the
entire transaction has a value of $2.3 billion.</p>
<p>Word of the Motel 6 transaction apparently had begun to
seep into the stock market yesterday afternoon. Motel 6's
units rose $2.625 each to $19.25 on brisk volume of 1.5
million units in New York Stock Exchange composite trading.
The transaction wasn't announced until about an hour after
the market closed.</p>
<p>"I think the French company will find that they made an
excellent acquisition," said Burland B. East III, an analyst
at Bateman Eichler, Hill Richards & Co. He praised Motel 6 as
"the McDonald's of the motel business. They are the cheapest
chain in America that provides a highly consistent product.
You always know what to expect."</p>
<p>Accor is paying a hefty price for Motel 6 though. For
1989, Motel 6 had net income of just $7 million, or 14 cents
a unit, on revenue of $424.7 million.</p>
<p>As a highly leveraged partnership, Motel 6 has big charges
for interest and depreciation. So many analysts focus instead
on operating profit, or net plus interest expense, taxes and
depreciation. Even by that gauge, the total transaction value
amounts to a brisk 12 times 1989 operating profit of $189
million. For 1990, KKR forecasts operating profit of $216
million.</p>
<p>In a statement, KKR partners Henry Kravis and George
Roberts said the transaction "makes strategic good sense for
both Motel 6 and Accor." They said that after five years of
their ownership of Motel 6, it is appropriate that "it become
part of a global lodging company with even greater resources
and growth potential."</p>
<p>Recently, KKR has been scaling back its vast portfolio of
companies acquired in leveraged buy-outs during the past
decade. In May, KKR announced plans to sell its 50% interest
in Union Texas Petroleum Co. And in June, KKR agreed to sell
Beatrice Co., a major food company, to ConAgra Inc. for $1.34
billion.</p>
<p>A KKR executive said the three sales announcements are
"coincidental" and shouldn't be seen as part of a broader
liquidation drive. KKR's typical holding period for a buy-out
is about five years, he observed, and several of KKR's
portfolio companies were acquired in 1985 or 1986, making
them ripe for sale.</p>
<p>Since KKR acquired Motel 6 from City Investing Co. in
1985, the motel chain has expanded unusually briskly for a
leveraged company. Motel 6 has increased its motels to 554
from 378 before the buy-out and has expanded its payroll
nearly 50%, to more than 11,000 employees. The lodging chain
also has spent $700 million on expansion and renovation,
installing color televisions and phones in all its rooms.</p>
<p>Bateman Eichler's Mr. East asserted that in the past few
years, Motel 6 has become "the best run lodging operation in
the country." Since the buy-out, Motel 6 said it has
increased its occupancy rate to about 77% from 67%.</p>
<p>Under KKR's ownership, Motel 6 has added 30 to 50 motels a
year. But Saul Fox, a KKR associate, predicted that the
growth rate will increase to 75 a year under Accor. Mr. Fox
added that Accor's willingness to pay a premium price for the
company reflected "the growth potential that's still in the
business."</p>
<p>Motel 6's president and chief executive officer, Joseph W.
McCarthy, said he will remain in charge of Motel 6 after the
acquisition. He added that while Motel 6 will have
"day-to-day autonomy," it also will swap technical expertise
with Accor's European operations.</p>
<p>KKR's talks with Accor began in January, after an earlier
effort to find buyers for Motel 6 didn't produce any bidders.
Accor had targeted the U.S. for expansion, but it encountered
only limited success in opening its Sofitel and Novotel
hotels in North America.</p>
<p>The Motel 6 deal "helps achieve our strategic plan to
establish Accor as the pre-eminent budget hotel company in
the world," said Accor's co-chairmen, Paul Debrule and Gerard
Pelisson.</p>
<p>Accor is making its offer through a specially formed
subsidiary, IBL Acquisition L.P. The French company said it
expects the tender offer to close in August.</p>
<p>In an unusual move, KKR first hired Salomon Brothers Inc.
to look for Motel 6 buyers, but then, at Accor's request,
negotiated the final transaction directly with Accor without
using any investment bank advisers. Accor was advised by
Euroforce Enterprises, a French consulting firm.</p>
<p>If KKR's go-it-alone practice recurs, it could be sad news
for Wall Street. Over the past five years, KKR's blizzard of
purchases and divestitures has been far and away the biggest
source of deal fees for the securities industry.</p>
