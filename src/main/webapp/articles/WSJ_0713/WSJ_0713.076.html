	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Are the public investors in Union Exploration
Partners being shortchanged by Unocal?
   The Los Angeles-based oil and gas giant created the
partnership and sold a small stake to the public in 1985 as
part of a plan to ward off a raid by T. Boone Pickens Jr.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Unocal put some of its choicest gas-producing properties
in the partnership, known as UXP. And though Unocal held a
controlling 95% stake, UXP appealed to small investors who
wanted a steady stream of tax-deferred cash payments.</p>
<p>UXP did make big distributions, but prices of the publicly
traded units, initially $22 each, headed south as oil and gas
prices slumped. The cruncher came in June, when Unocal
disclosed that on Aug. 1, it will convert UXP into a
corporation.</p>
<p>In the month since then, the market value of UXP has
plunged to less than $12 a unit from $18.25, though the units
have regained ground this week to $13.</p>
<p>"The new company will have exactly the same assets, and
the price has fallen to 13 from 18. Can capital markets be
that inefficient?," wonders PaineWebber analyst Bryan
Jacoboski.</p>
<p>Capital markets, in fact, recognize that the income from
UXP will plunge too. Previously, it was expected to pay about
$1.65 a unit this year. But the new company expects to pay a
yearly corporate dividend, fully taxable, of only 40 cents a
share.</p>
<p>Unocal has contingently promised to compensate holders for
any drop of as much as $3 in the unit price from $18.20. At
current prices, holders are still out more than $2 a unit, or
$27 million for the 12 million units in public hands.</p>
<p>Steven Spence, a stockbroker for PaineWebber in Portland,
Ore., has written the Securities and Exchange Commission,
claiming that Unocal violated its fiduciary duty by taking an
action that caused the market value of the units to decline.</p>
<p>Clients of the PaineWebber branch own 1.5 million units.
They are also unhappy because Unocal's original prospectus
didn't mention the possibility of such a conversion. In
Unocal's behalf, the prospectus didn't preclude a conversion.</p>
<p>Salomon Brothers, Unocal's paid adviser, says the
conversion is fair to unitholders. Unocal says it can't
comment until a filing is approved by the SEC.</p>
<p>Analysts say Unocal's privately expressed position is that
investors should "calm down and be patient." Although unit
prices have dropped as income-oriented investors have
deserted UXP, Unocal is planning a road show to pitch the new
vehicle to large investors. The company's position, one
investor says, is that "it's only a function of time before
institutions understand the new vehicle."</p>
<p>Analysts can see why a unitholder would be griping, but
they are hardly shedding tears. "Anyone who bought the units
knew that 95% were owned by Unocal," notes Kidder Peabody's
Marc Cohen.</p>
<p>With only 5% of the new company's shares to be traded
publicly, analysts say they doubt whether institutions will
jump in. "The float is small," says Prescott Ball & Turben's
Bruce Lazier. "That's why I think this is a first step."</p>
<p>The Street is betting that, some time after UXP is
converted, Unocal will sell off more UXP shares to raise
cash. With 29% of Unocal's U.S. oil reserves and 59% of its
U.S. gas reserves, UXP is a large entity with a tiny public
float. Enlarging that float would be an attractive way to
raise money for drilling for oil and gas.</p>
<p>The oil giant seems motivated by a desire to invest more
in exploration. "Corporations are more efficient vehicles for
reinvestment than partnerships," its filing says.
Partnerships, however, are better suited to paying money out
to holders than taking it in.</p>
<p>When the partnership was formed, raiders such as Mr.
Pickens were arguing that exploration was a waste, that "the
cheapest oil" was on the New York Stock Exchange. The best
oil companies could do, it was said, was to pay out their
cash flow. Hence, Unocal and others rushed to form
partnerships.</p>
<p>But Salomon analyst Bernard Picchi says exploration
opportunities in the '90s loom large. UXP, he says, has
"enormous exploration potential" because its Gulf of Mexico
gas properties are long-lived and close to a network of
pipelines. Drilling in the ground has again become cheaper
than drilling on the stock exchange, he quips.</p>
<p>Thus, Mr. Picchi sees Unocal's move as the beginning of
the end for other oil partnerships. "By 1995, none of them
are likely to exist."</p>
