	<p class="article-leader">DALLAS -- Occidental Chemical Co. said a proposed $200
million project in the Soviet Ukraine was stalled after local
residents complained about toxic pollutants from an existing
petrochemical complex there.
   "We agreed to a one-year delay at the request of our
joint-venture partner, which owns the complex," said an
Occidental Chemical spokesman. The partner is Chlorvinyl, a
state-owned company under the direction of the Soviet
Chemical Industry Ministry.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>On April 10, opponents of Occidental's project sponsored a
"town meeting" in Kalush near the complex, said a spokeswoman
for the Natural Resources Defense Council, a U.S.
environmental advocacy group. Residents want the existing
plant to "be brought up to standard" before any expansion
takes place, she said.</p>
<p>Toxic emissions from the Chlorvinyl complex exceed maximum
permissible concentrations set by the Soviet government,
according to the National Resources Defense Council. Since
November, Soviet law has required an environmental assessment
for new industrial projects prior to their approval.</p>
<p>Occidental, a unit of Los Angeles-based Occidental
Petroleum Corp., signed an agreement with Chlorvinyl two
years ago to construct and operate two plants at the complex
that would make polyvinyl chloride, a widely used plastic.
Occidental said it would have a 25% stake in the project. The
existing plant makes vinylchloride, among other chemicals.</p>
