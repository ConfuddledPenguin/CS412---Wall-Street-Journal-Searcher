	<p class="article-leader">PARIS -- Aerospatiale of France and British Aerospace PLC
plan to study joint construction of a supersonic airliner
with twice the range and passenger capacity of the Concorde.
But its speed, planned for 2.5 times the speed of sound,
would be only slightly faster than the Concorde's.
   Announcement of the study will come tomorrow, sources
said. Neither company would confirm details.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Both European aircraft builders, as well as
government-funded studies in the U.S. and Japan, have been
looking at supersonic and "hypersonic" aircraft projects for
months. In particular, Boeing Co. and McDonnell Douglas Corp.
are looking at the potential of developing what they call a
high-speed civil transport, or HSCT. Four years ago, the
National Aeronautics and Space Administration began funding
research into the area, and both manufacturers are convinced
that a market exists for an aircraft that could carry 250 to
300 passengers up to 6,500 miles at nearly 2.5 times the
speed of sound.</p>
<p>But no plane has been configured at this point. NASA is
now in the midst of a $25 million study to evaluate the
environmental problems that such an aircraft could cause:
Excessive engine noise, ozone depletion and sonic booms. "We
don't see anything flying before the turn of the century,"
said a spokesman for Seattle-based Boeing, which two decades
ago watched as its supersonic transport program was canceled
due in large part to economic uncertainties.</p>
<p>In addition, the U.S. Air Force, in cooperation with U.S.
aerospace companies, is developing what it calls the National
AeroSpace Plane, which would be capable of flying in low
Earth orbit at 25 times the speed of sound. And Japan late
last year invited U.S. and other foreign participation in a
$200 million Tokyo-funded project to develop an engine for a
Japanese civil transport plane that would fly at five times
the speed of sound.</p>
