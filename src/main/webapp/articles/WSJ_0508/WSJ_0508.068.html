	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Dime Savings Bank of New York has chosen an
executive with a law background to lead the savings bank
through rough times in the thrift industry.
   Dime named Richard D. Parsons, president of the thrift, to
the added post of chief executive officer. Mr. Parsons, 42
years old, succeeds Harry W. Albright Jr. who will remain
chairman.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Like many lenders, Dime is grappling with loan problems,
because of poor underwriting of home loans between 1986 and
1988. But some analysts say that Dime, with $700 million in
tangible capital and continued earnings, is the best
positioned of the big East Coast thrifts to ride out the
storm.</p>
<p>Some find it surprising that Dime, which has $11.7 billion
in assets, would turn to someone with a background in
corporate law and limited experience operating a thrift to
guide it through this difficult period. Before joining Dime
in 1988, Mr. Parsons was a partner in the New York law firm
of Patterson, Belknap, Webb & Tyler. He formerly served as
counsel to former New York Govs. Nelson A. Rockefeller and
Malcolm Wilson.</p>
<p>So far, analysts aren't holding the lack of operating
experience against him. Jonathan Gray, an analyst with
Sanford C. Bernstein Co., said: "My first impression has been
quite positive. He's highly intelligent and has a good grasp
of operational and strategic matters. . . . Dime's loan
problems pre-date his arrival."</p>
<p>Mr. Parsons said that he joined Dime because he was
intrigued by the thought of "rolling up my sleeves" and
running a business: "Many corporate lawyers spend their off
hours wondering what it would be like to have their hands on
the tiller."</p>
<p>For the next year or two, Mr. Parsons has nothing fancy
planned for Dime. "At the moment, we're husbanding our
capital. We're in a hunker-down mode," he said. "We're the
only one of the five largest New York thrifts in full
compliance with capital requirements."</p>
<p>Dime isn't merely treading water. Last year, it expanded
in New Jersey buying Star Pointe Bank for $63 million, and
Mr. Parsons would like to add some deposit-taking capability
to its loan offices in Connecticut.</p>
<p>He says that residential mortgages will remain the
cornerstone of Dime but that the thrift will expand its
unsecured personal loan products, such as checking overdraft
protection, to compete more vigorously with the big
commercial banks. "We intend to provide the full-range of
consumer financial services on both the deposit and credit
sides," he said.</p>
<p>While Dime has indicated that an $80 million provision for
possible bad loans in last year's fourth quarter will be
sufficient to see it through its problems, analysts aren't so
sure.</p>
<p>Peter Treadway, an analyst at Smith Barney, says: "They're
not out of the woods yet. I think they'll have to make
another big provision. But Dime has a lot of capital, and its
core earnings are still positive. Every other major East
Coast thrift has severe problems. Dime is the only one that's
going to survive."</p>
