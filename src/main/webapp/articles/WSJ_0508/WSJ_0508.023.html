	<p class="article-leader">Archive Corp., a Costa Mesa, Calif., maker of
computer-tape drives, announced a reorganization and work
force reductions in the wake of its acquisition last month of
Cipher Data Products Corp.
   Archive said it expects to eliminate about 108 jobs, or
about 3% of its 3,300 employees. The company also plans to
realign its operations into six business units. Manufacturing
operations will be consolidated in Singapore, the company
said.</p>
