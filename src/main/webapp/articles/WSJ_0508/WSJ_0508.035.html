	<p class="article-leader">New York -- At "Siegfried" the other night, a man
diagonally in front of me slept so soundly I thought he was
dead. In fact, wondering about him probably helped keep me
wide awake through some of the most boring vocal music Wagner
ever wrote. But then the man stirred to life, about the same
time Fafner the dragon did, and sounding much the same. So
there was no reason to rush him over to Roosevelt Hospital --
conveniently around the corner from the Metropolitan Opera --
where patrons and singers sometimes end up.
   Hildegard Behrens, for instance, was wheeled there the
other night after a foam beam landed on her head at the end
of "Gotterdammerung," the last opera in the "Ring" cycle,
when the world of the decadent gods is meant to disappear
(but not with the soprano). At the same time, another miscue
apparently opened up a hole in the floor through which the
soprano says she could have fallen fatally if the beam hadn't
decked her first.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>There are many singers I wouldn't mind seeing disappear
down a dark hole, but Ms. Behrens, who canceled her remaining
performances, apparently more spooked than hurt, isn't
actually on the top of the list. Thin indeed are the ranks of
Wagnerian sopranos these days, strong ladies who must bellow
for hours over an orchestra of great size and volume. This is
particularly true at the Met, which had a fight with one of
the world's few other Valkyries worth her steed, Eva Marton.
She left the Met in a huff last year after learning the
company intended to telecast its "Ring" cycle with Ms.
Behrens. The Met didn't want Ms. Marton, not necessarily
because she is such a tiresome self-promoter, but because the
company's artistic chief, James Levine, has recorded the
"Ring" operas with Ms. Behrens for Deutsche Grammophon, which
is also planning to release video disks of the telecast.
Keeping the same soprano has an obvious sales advantage.</p>
<p>DG and the Met must be pulling out each other's hair. Even
before the set collapsed on poor Ms. Behrens (Did anyone see
a thick-thewed Hungarian woman lurking in the wings?), the
soprano wasn't having the easiest time with Brunnhilde. "Die
Walkure" was already videotaped last year. But it was from
the three "Ring" cycles at the end of this season that the
Met expected to tape the remaining operas, ("Rheingold,"
"Siegfried," "Gotterdammerung") for the telecast starting
June 18 on the Public Broadcasting Service.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, Ms. Behrens came down with a cold during
the first cycle's "Gotterdammerung" and didn't get much
better for the second go-around. Were it not for the
soprano's appealing stage persona, much of her singing would
have been unendurable. Neither did many of her companions
take our mind off the catastrophic scarcity of true
Wagnerians in the world.</p>
<p>When an international company like the Met does the
"Ring," much can be learned about the current state of
Wagnerian singing. It was dispiriting to see Fricka and
Waltraute assigned to the faded mezzo of Christa Ludwig, who
made her debut in 1946. And it was equally sad to realize
that we are still looking for someone to fill Wolfgang
Windgassen's Size 15 heldentenor shoes.</p>
<p>The Met and DG put their money on a real-life Siegfried --
Siegfried Jerusalem, suitably handsome as the fearless hero,
but also afflicted by a mundane cold for the first
"Gotterdammerung." Elsewhere, he revealed a lyrical, mellow
middle range that turned hoarse under pressure. In the
"Siegfried" duet with Ms. Behrens, one wondered who might
collapse sooner, because at that point we weren't yet also
worrying about the set. Much magic will have to be worked in
the studios.</p>
<p>Neither is the pleasantly reedy-voiced Gary Lakes the
answer to fading heldentenor hopes, though one could at least
believe this Siegmund was the long lost brother of the
Sieglinde, Jessye Norman. When these jumbo-sized lovers
hunkered down over their pitiful little porridge bowls in
Hunding's hut, it looked like a meeting of the charter
members of the Moscow clean-plate club. Did she sing well?
Yes, in a mature manner rather at odds with the youthful
character who should seem to blossom forth with hope and love
just like the spring she sings about in the eternal first
act. Ms. Norman was autumnal.</p>
<p>At least there is no world shortage of basses and
baritones, to judge from the satisfying profusion of
dark-voiced dwarfs, giants and gods, scuttling, stomping and
striding through this dully traditional production. Ekkehard
Wlaschiha was a memorably twisted Alberich; Matti Salminen, a
frighteningly intense Hagen.</p>
<p>Most impressive was James Morris, who has become a Wotan
of searing vocal power and eloquence. As never before, he was
completely riveting in his faceted portrayal of the
overreaching empire-builder, brought down and shattered to
the core. Nearly as commanding in the pit (nearly as visible
too standing on an elevator-shoe of a podium) was Mr. Levine.
He's no Speedy Gonzalez, but his highly emotional approach to
the climactic scenes rarely failed to make an impact. Still,
couldn't the Met music chief arrange for some better
Valkyries? They were a screamy bunch. Why didn't a
foam-covered little boulder fall on them?</p>
<p>Well, that's it for the "Ring" until the 1992-93 season
when there will be a "wiedersehen, jawohl]", maybe with the
same cast unless there is a sudden boomlet in Brunnhildes and
Siegfrieds. Meanwhile, with all those expensive sets on its
hands, why doesn't the Met join the ecology movement and
recycle a few mountains and trees into a set for Alfredo
Catalani's "La Wally?" This alpine melodrama hasn't been
heard in the house since Emmy Destinn sang it there in 1909.
"Wally" never earned a place in any company's repertory,
though it has always had champions.</p>
<p>Tebaldi recorded "Wally" with Mario del Monaco. Toscanini
cruelly named a daughter after the mysterious,
mountain-climbing, edelweiss-in-the-hair heroine. Worse,
either the opera or the play it is based on, Wilhelmine von
Hillern's "Vulture Wally," inspired admiration even in the
distant Baltic burg of Riga because I got stuck with it as a
middle name.</p>
<p>For all that, the opera is rather enjoyable, and it
received an enthusiastic performance from Eve Queler and her
Opera Orchestra at Carnegie Hall last month. With its
atmospheric preludes and bittersweet tunes, "Wally" has more
to offer than the well-known aria that floated through the
French movie hit "Diva," where it was sung by an enigmatic
soprano who performs in public but refuses to make
recordings.</p>
<p>I wish the reverse were true of Aprile Millo who sang
Wally with a radiant, expressive voice and her usual diva
mannerisms ineptly borrowed from Tebaldi who was at least a
foot taller and never styled her hair by putting her finger
in a socket. Ms. Millo's next evening dress should be a
sequined straightjacket with hood attached.</p>
<p>The rest of the cast was quite fine, particularly Kristjan
Johannsson, an Icelandic tenor, who revealed a thrillingly
heroic, cutting voice before he was silenced by an avalanche.
Say, del Monaco tried some Wagner late in life. Maybe Mr.
Johannsson could do the world a favor and learn the "Ring"
cycle.</p>
