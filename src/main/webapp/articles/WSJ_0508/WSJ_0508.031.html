	<p class="article-leader">HONG KONG -- Overseas Trust Bank, which was declared
insolvent and taken over by the government in 1985, settled a
negligence claim against accounting firm Coopers & Lybrand,
the bank's auditor until the takeover.
   Overseas Trust alleged that Coopers & Lybrand failed to
audit the bank's accounts properly, and therefore should take
at least some responsibility for the losses that caused the
insolvency and subsequent takeover.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The settlement, announced Monday, involves a payment by
Coopers & Lybrand to the bank, which remains under government
management. The amount of the payment wasn't disclosed.
Coopers & Lybrand, one of the world's largest accounting
firms, isn't required to admit liability.</p>
<p>Overseas Trust Managing Director David Turner said the
bank considers the payment a satisfactory settlement of the
lawsuit, which he described as "basically a negligence
action."</p>
<p>Roderick Chalmers, a partner with Coopers & Lybrand, said
the firm continues to maintain its "denial of the
allegations" in the lawsuit as well as its "denial of
liability." In New York, Coopers & Lybrand's in-house lawyers
weren't available for comment.</p>
<p>After the government takeover, Overseas Trust announced a
consolidated loss totaling HK$3.05 billion (US$391.4
million), for the fiscal year ended June 30, 1985. Subsequent
police investigations led to fraud convictions and prison
terms for several senior bank executives and their business
associates.</p>
<p>Coopers & Lybrand wasn't implicated in the criminal
investigation.</p>
