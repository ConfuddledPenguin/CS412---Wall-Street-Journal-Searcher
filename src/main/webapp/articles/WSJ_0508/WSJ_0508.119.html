brought against it by OSF International Inc., the owner of
the Old Spaghetti Factory restaurant chain, by agreeing,
among other things, to change its name and pay the plaintiff
$400,000.
   Garland, Texas-based Old Spaghetti said the payment will
be financed by its insurance carriers and won't affect
earnings.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Under terms of the settlement, Old Spaghetti Warehouse
said it agreed to cease using the word "Old" in its signs,
trade names, and service marks, and to submit to its
shareholders at the next annual meeting a proposal to change
its corporate name to The Spaghetti Warehouse Inc.</p>
<p>In addition, the company said it agreed to display on its
menu and in the entrance to each store a statement
disclaiming any association between its restaurants and those
run by Portland, Oregon-based OSF.</p>
