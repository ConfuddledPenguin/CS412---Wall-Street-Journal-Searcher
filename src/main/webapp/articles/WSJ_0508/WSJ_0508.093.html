	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- ITT Corp. became Western Union Corp.'s second
largest owner in late March.
   Western issued an additional 7.8 million shares, or 9.02%,
of its common stock to ITT under terms of its December 1987
agreement to purchase ITT World Communications Inc.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>That agreement said that if Western Union's stock fell
below $2.05625 a share at Dec. 31, 1989, ITT would receive
the difference between $2.05625 and the market value of the
stock multiplied by 6,565,350.</p>
<p>In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange,
Western Union closed at 56.25 cents, up 6.25 cents.</p>
<p>The new shares raise ITT's stake in Western Union to
16.58% of its 86.8 million shares outstanding and 7.8% of
voting rights in the beleaguered telecommunications company.
That is second to Western's largest shareholder, New York
financier Bennett S. LeBow, who owns 43.4% of Western's
common, or 46.4% of its voting rights.</p>
<p>"This is purely pursuant to our 1987 agreement," said a
Western spokesman. "This is not ITT buying additional
shares."</p>
<p>Actually, ITT's new status could be short-lived if a
recent plan by Western to restructure its debt wins approval
from shareholders. Western wants to swap its existing debt
securities for new notes and to increase its common
outstanding to 368 million shares. This would shrink ITT's
stake to about 3.9%.</p>
