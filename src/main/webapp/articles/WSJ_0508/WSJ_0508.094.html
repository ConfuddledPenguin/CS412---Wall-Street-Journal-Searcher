	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Faced with a continuing boycott by
bondholders, Ingersoll Newspapers Inc. extended for the
second time in two weeks its tender offer to holders of an
affiliate's junk bonds.
   The latest extension is raising questions about whether
the company, which is controlled by Ralph Ingersoll II, may
be forced to sell more of its newspaper properties to avoid
default on its heavy debt load.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Through his various companies, Mr. Ingersoll sold 10
newspapers in January to pay off bank debt, has other
newspapers up for sale, and on April 25 closed the St. Louis
Sun. The metropolitan newspaper cost him at least $25 million
since its launch last September.</p>
<p>More than likely, Mr. Ingersoll will be forced to sweeten
his offer to as much as 80% or more of the bonds' face value;
the bonds have traded, in small volume, between 55% and 60%.
Ingersoll Newspapers is attempting to buy back about $240
million of junk bonds at a deep discount to their face value.
Ingersoll offered 55% for the senior bonds and 25% for the
junior bonds.</p>
<p>Mr. Ingersoll's Community Newspapers Inc., issuer of the
bonds, publishes daily newspapers in Ohio, Connecticut, New
Jersey, Rhode Island and New York. Mr. Ingersoll has
attempted to buy Community's bonds through his other holding
company, Ingersoll Newspapers. Mr. Ingersoll controls the
various companies, including a newspaper company in Britain,
through Ingersoll Publications Co., based in Princeton, N.J.</p>
<p>Bondholders, who total fewer than 35 institutions, have
once again organized a total boycott of Mr. Ingersoll's
offer. Since no bondholder accepted the offer for 13% "reset"
bonds and discount debentures by midnight EDT last Friday,
Ingersoll said it will extend the offer to 12:01 a.m. EDT
Saturday.</p>
<p>Ingersoll, however, said Community Newspapers will, at the
request of bondholders, begin discussions for the first time
with them about the tender offers.</p>
<p>It is uncertain whether such talks will result in
substantial changes in the tender offer. Ingersoll executives
wouldn't comment and executives from Goldman, Sachs & Co.,
which is managing the offer, couldn't be reached for comment.</p>
<p>According to some bondholders, Chase Manhattan Bank is
funding Ingersoll's tender offer. A Chase spokesman, however,
would say only: "Chase is continuing to have discussions with
Ingersoll about financing. We are having discussions on a
variety of Ingersoll's financing needs."</p>
<p>With each extension of the tender offer, Mr. Ingersoll's
newspaper company nears an important deadline -- July 7. By
that date, Mr. Ingersoll must have reset interest payments
for about $125 million of the bonds to make up for the drop
in the bonds' price.</p>
<p>The bondholders are well organized and so far have
remained unified, hoping to force changes in the tender
offer. Bondholders object not only to what has been referred
to as Mr. Ingersoll's "low-ball price," but also to the
structure of the offer. James Rubin of Sass Lamle Rubin &
Co., has said, under the offer, bonds outstanding would have
severely reduced protective covenants that would render them
worthless in certain scenarios.</p>
<p>According to bondholders, the group has retained Smith
Barney, Harris Upham & Co. as independent advisers. Smith
Barney, which couldn't be reached for comment, is expected to
advise the bondholders on the values of Mr. Ingersoll's
newspaper properties.</p>
