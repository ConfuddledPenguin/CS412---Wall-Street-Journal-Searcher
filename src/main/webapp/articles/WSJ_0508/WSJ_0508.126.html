	<p class="article-leader">Washington Bancorp said it is unable to repay about $36.7
million of unsecured commercial-paper obligations because
some lines of credit were cut off by other banks.
   The Washington, D.C.-based holding company for the
National Bank of Washington said about $25.8 million of its
$36.7 million of commercial paper outstanding matured
yesterday and can't be repaid unless new debt financing is
arranged "promptly."</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>In addition, the company said its National Bank of
Washington unit agreed to abide by tougher operating
requirements imposed by the Comptroller of the Currency
because of regulators' concerns about the bank's financial
condition.</p>
<p>The agreement calls for prompt action to "increase the
availability of liquid assets" at the bank, the company said.
The bank also agreed to conduct a "special review" of its
commercial real-estate loan portfolio and "certain other
loans" that weren't identified.</p>
