	<p class="article-leader">American Telephone & Telegraph Co. received a five-year
contract valued at $40 million from Pan American World
Airways Inc. for computer and network systems.
   New York-based AT&T will install personal computers and
local area network systems for managing the airline's
reservations and baggage-handling operations in about 100
locations world-wide.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The contract, the second-largest commercial computer
contract ever received by AT&T, also calls for the company to
maintain computer equipment used by the airline from other
suppliers.</p>
<p>The idea, said Robert O. Wagner, Pan Am's vice president
of information services, is to create the "airport of the
future" where ticket issuing, baggage handling and boarding
are automated.</p>
