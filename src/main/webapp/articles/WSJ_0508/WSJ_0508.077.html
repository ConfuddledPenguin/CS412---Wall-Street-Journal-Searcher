	<p class="article-leader">A group of off-duty Soviet soldiers watch curiously as a
West German assembly crew uses a crane hoist to fit together
the shiny, container-like pieces of Commerzbank AG's first
East German branch.
   The Halle branch is the first of 50 to be set up by year
end. With monetary union set for July 2, West Germany's three
largest banks are jockeying for position in East Germany's
fertile market for Western-style banking. Sometimes the
contestants can become testy.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The new branches sprouting in every corner of East Germany
can't open for business until East Germany grants operating
licenses to foreign banks, a move expected well ahead of the
first Monday in July. By that morning, West Germany's major
banks want to open their doors in cities from Rostock to
Dresden to soak up more than 100 billion marks ($60.06
billion) in potential deposits.</p>
<p>At stake is a new domestic market with enormous growth
potential in retail and, later, investment banking. For West
German banks forced to refinance in their notoriously
overbanked market, unification means expansion at home rather
than increasingly risky ventures abroad.</p>
<p>East Germany's feeble economy will delay large increases
in bank assets. But bank analysts believe the first few
months will be crucial in securing market shares that can
grow only as West German aid and investment pour into East
Germany.</p>
<p>So far, it has been an unequal contest. Commerzbank
Chairman Walter Seipp said he was assured earlier this year
by senior officials of East Germany's State Bank that West
Germany's leading banks would be treated equally when
parceling out the State Bank's retail branches for new
tenants from the West. Somehow, it didn't work out that way.</p>
<p>On April 1, East Germany's bank overhaul broke up the
State Bank's banking monopoly. In the process, the central
bank's operations were separated from commercial and
cooperative banking functions. The move created Deutsche
Kreditbank as the country's leading retail bank.</p>
<p>The competition among West German banks began as Deutsche
Bank AG nettled rivals by signing a letter of intent with the
newly formed Kreditbank to form a joint venture that would
give Deutsche Bank 100 branches in East Germany. Deutsche
Bank last week announced it plans to have 100 branches up and
running July 2.</p>
<p>Under the proposed terms of the agreement, Deutsche Bank,
West Germany's largest bank, has a 49% stake in the joint
venture and its 100 branches, with Kreditbank retaining 51%.
A Deutsche Bank official, however, said "this is merely a
transitional arrangement."</p>
<p>Not to be outdone, second-ranking Dresdner Bank AG
confirmed a week ago that it is angling for a similar
agreement with Kreditbank.</p>
<p>East Germany's creaky banking system, knowing its chances
to survive independently are slim, has sought alliances with
the big banks in Frankfurt. Analysts reason that when it came
to choosing partners, East German officials instinctively
opted for the largest banks in the field.</p>
<p>Thus Commerzbank, a distant third in assets, came away
empty-handed. "The competition is pretty intense," said
Thomas Albrecht, a German bank analyst for UBS-Phillips &
Drew. "Commerzbank must be frustrated because Deutsche and
Dresdner will have a presence all over the place, and fairly
quickly."</p>
<p>Speaking with journalists in Leipzig, East Germany,
Commerzbank's Mr. Seipp aimed a jab at his biggest
competitor, which had been keeping its talks with Kreditbank
under a cloak of secrecy for several months.</p>
<p>"At first glance, it might look like Deutsche Bank is
getting a faster start," Mr. Seipp said. "But if you look at
the former buildings of the State Bank that they're getting,
I'm not so sure. The old buildings can be a deterrent for
many customers, who could be reminded of the old system. We
can offer them a fresh start."</p>
<p>Commerzbank's Horst Ahrens is happy with the company's
progress in Halle. "We are glad to have so much space in
front of the bank," said Mr. Ahrens. "On July 2, we'll
probably have thousands lined up in front."</p>
<p>A Deutsche Bank official isn't so sure. "It doesn't hurt
to be optimistic," he said, adding, "This is going to be a
very difficult process. We are literally starting at zero."</p>
<p>Many of Deutsche Bank's future branches are in desperate
need of a facelift. Down the street from the pile of
containers that are four weeks away from becoming a new
Commerzbank outlet, a soot-covered Deutsche Kreditbank branch
doesn't gain in charm as one enters a foreboding, ill-lighted
lobby.</p>
<p>After 40 years of rigid central planning, East German
enterprises have little in their books that approximates
Western accounting standards. Most companies have never had
to balance both sides of a ledger, and their fixed assets
often were artificially inflated as part of the socialist
success formula.</p>
<p>Said Commerzbank's Mr. Seipp: "We simply can't apply our
own standards on assessing creditworthiness. We will have to
work on trust."</p>
