	<p class="article-leader">Amertek Inc. said it filed a proposal under Canada's
Bankruptcy Act asking its creditors to allow it to defer
payment of outstanding accounts totaling about 4.5 million
Canadian dollars (US$3.9 million).
   Amertek said it is proposing to pay about 60% of that sum
in early 1991 and the balance of the debt in 1992 as profits
and cash flow allow.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The Woodstock, Ontario, company said it "has met with a
large number of significant creditors to outline the present
condition of the corporation and believes that there is
adequate support for the proposal, and for the continuing
operations of the corporation."</p>
<p>The maker of specialty trucks said the first meeting of
creditors to discuss the proposal will take place May 28. The
company said it is continuing discussions with potential
financial partners in an effort to construct a more sound
financial base for the company's operations.</p>
