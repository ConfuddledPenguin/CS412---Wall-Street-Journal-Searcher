   Nothing `Perverse'
   In Pulitzer's Choice</h3>

	<p class="article-leader">In his article on the Pulitzer Prize recently awarded
August Wilson's "The Piano Lesson," Edwin Wilson makes much
of the fact that the Pulitzer Prize Board "reserves the right
to ignore the recommendations" of its advisory juries ("A
`Lesson' in Pulitzer Perversity," Leisure & Arts, April 23).
In reality, that is a right that is not invoked in the great
majority of instances and, in any case, the point has no real
bearing on the particular award with which Mr. Wilson
concerned himself. In giving the 1990 drama award to "The
Piano Lesson," the Pulitzer board, in fact, chose one of the
plays that the three critics who constituted this year's
drama jury recommended as finalists.
   No less tangential is Mr. Wilson's implications that the
fact that the prize-winning version of "The Piano Lesson" was
first produced outside New York City somehow had major
relevance to its eligibility for the 1990 drama prize.
Actually, the determining consideration was not where the
play was produced but whether it was still identical to the
version first put on at the Yale Repertory Theater in 1987.
For while there is no flat prohibition in the Pulitzer bylaws
against considering the same play in successive years, the
prize board would almost certainly have been hesitant to give
the 1990 award to a work it had bypassed earlier and that had
undergone no meaningful evolution since then.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Mr. Wilson holds the view that the current version of "The
Piano Lesson" is "much the same" as the one he saw in New
Haven in 1987. The chairman of the this year's Pulitzer drama
jury on the other hand felt that the two were significantly
different. Instead of the "perversity" of the Pulitzer Prize
Board, then, the true cause of Mr. Wilson's complaint would
appear to lie in a difference of opinion between himself and
some other professional drama critics.</p>
