	<p class="article-leader">CHICAGO -- Restaurant patrons are picky eaters these days.
That's why restaurateurs are spending thousands of dollars
surveying them on their likes and dislikes.
   A case in point is Eurasia, which opened two years ago
just off this city's tony Michigan Avenue shopping district.
Eurasia's Euro-Asian fare drew novelty-cuisine buffs but
turned off the regular lunch crowd. Hoping to find ways to
spur business, Eurasia had researcher Allen H. Kelson, a
former food critic, survey its customers. He found they were
confused by Eurasia's concept and wanted more traditional
Oriental fare at lower prices.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>In response, the restaurant altered its concept a few
months ago; it hired a Thai chef, revamped the menu and cut
prices. A recent survey suggests the makeover's popularity is
rising "off the charts," says Larry Levy, the chairman of
Levy Organization, a diversified real-estate company whose 35
restaurants include Eurasia.</p>
<p>Oddly enough, Mr. Kelson says he found the results of his
second survey rather "humbling." In his prior career as
publisher and top food reviewer of Chicago magazine, he had
taken Levy Organization to task for refusing to make Eurasia
even more radical. Mr. Kelson -- more pragmatic now that he
has retired his critic's mantle -- admits, "It appears that
Chicagoans are really more conservative."</p>
<p>Entrepreneurs in restaurants and other fields that have
staggering failure rates are eager for ways to improve their
chances. Some think that hiring a consultant such as Mr.
Kelson is one way to ease the worries that plague them.</p>
<p>"You're only as good as your last meal," says Michael
Hoffman, owner of Michael's Chicago-Style Red Hots Inc., a
fast-food operator here that retained Mr. Kelson to poll
patrons on food quality and service.</p>
<p>The pressures on restaurants are aplenty: The number of
new eating establishments throughout the country soared in
recent years. And take-out places, grocery-store salad bars
and microwavable foods make it easier for people to ignore
restaurants entirely. New restaurateurs find it's tougher
than ever to make a go of it, says J. Patrick Kelly, a
marketing professor at Wayne State University in Detroit. And
established owners, particularly those with far-flung empires
of individual restaurants, struggle to keep up, too.</p>
<p>"It's getting very difficult for me to keep in touch with
our customers," says Richard Melman, the president of Lettuce
Entertain You Enterprises Inc., Chicago, which operates 25
restaurants.</p>
<p>Mr. Kelson's approach to customer research appeals to Mr.
Melman and others because he involves so many customers. To
start his survey of a restaurant, Mr. Kelson suggests that
the host or hostess hand customers cards inviting them to
participate. Those interested write their names and phone
numbers on the cards; in exchange, the restaurant gives them
some incentive, typically a discount on their next meal
there. Later, telephone interviewers -- supplied by Mr.
Kelson's partner Stanley J. Kapuler, who runs his own
research firm -- call customers for opinions.</p>
<p>Interviewees who insist they'll never return to a
restaurant -- a liability in an industry that relies on
word-of-mouth business -- are targeted for call-backs by
restaurant owners. Managers then contact them and offer them
a meal on the house. About half accept, says Mr. Kelson. If
an unhappy customer can be turned around on the next visit,
the restaurant will earn "a friend for life," he insists.</p>
<p>His firm, Customer Satisfaction Systems Inc., in Arlington
Heights, Ill., charges clients up to $3,800 for individual
restaurants and as little as $1,000 an establishment for
large restaurant concerns. He's developing a program for
fast-food chains that will cost each site about $500.</p>
<p>Mr. Kelson's methods differ from those that many
restaurant owners use. The most common method -- response
cards left on tables or at the checkout -- doesn't work well;
only customers who had extremely bad or good experiences will
fill them out, researchers say. In addition, restaurant
managers have been known to fill them out themselves to
impress higher-ups.</p>
<p>Researchers say personal interviews with customers can be
even more effective than the telephone queries Mr. Kelson's
company offers. But they're costlier.</p>
<p>Surveys often reinforce a restaurant operator's gut
instincts on needed changes. At Don & Charlie's American Rib
& Chop House, a Lettuce Entertain You restaurant in
Scottsdale, Ariz., Mr. Kelson found that customers considered
the place dirty. Mr. Kelson didn't see dirt, but Don Carson,
the partner who runs the place, suspected what was wrong. The
restaurant's exterior badly needed painting and its parking
lot needed repaving, but he'd been putting off the required
$35,000 investment. The survey persuaded him to get the work
done -- and the eatery scored well on cleanliness in a later
poll.</p>
<p>Frequent restaurant-goers tend to have standards in mind
when they approach a new restaurant, say marketing experts.
Surveys can identify those expectations, as happened at Hat
Dance, a Mexican restaurant operated by Lettuce Entertain
You.</p>
<p>Two years ago, when Hat Dance opened, managing partner
John Buchanan was devoted to offerings unavailable elsewhere
in the city, such as a ceviche bar (which serves raw
marinated fish). But Mr. Kelson's survey found customers came
expecting more familiar fare, such as burritos and
enchiladas. So, Mr. Buchanan added the old standbys to the
menu -- and repeat customers have increased.</p>
<p>Still, surveys aren't panaceas. "Once a restaurant is
going downhill -- you've tried it and had a terrible
experience -- the likelihood of your going back is remote,"
says Mr. Kelly of Wayne State University.</p>
<p>For instance, Hopper's Dining Car, another Levy
Organization restaurant in Chicago, was too far gone to be
helped by Mr. Kelson's queries last fall. Situated beside a
movie theater on the basement level of an upscale retail
center, Hopper's did all right at lunch but attracted little
dinner business. Dinner customers, Mr. Kelson says, scored
the place low on all aspects of his survey except noise
level. And on April 30, Hopper's Dining Car closed.</p>
