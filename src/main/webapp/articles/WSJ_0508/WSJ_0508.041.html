	<p class="article-leader">In response to your March 28 page-one article "Breathing
Easier":
   As a co-sponsor of the Clean Air bill, I believe that the
U.S. can establish reasonable domestic environmental
standards without being unreasonable about America's
competitiveness in the international marketplace.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>There's no doubt that foreign producers operating under
less costly environmental standards will indirectly benefit
from the costs imposed on U.S. industry by the Clean Air
bill. I plan to offer an amendment that seeks to preserve a
level playing field by requiring the president to negotiate
equivalent environmental standards or trade adjustments with
our international competitors.</p>
<p>Basically, this is neither an effort to protect our
interests only, nor is it a violation of the spirit of
fairness and reciprocity. I am attempting to put this issue
on the table now. Otherwise, it will haunt us later. Through
trade negotiations, the U.S. can promote an environmental
agenda that not only equalizes trade inequities at the
outset, but also enhances global responsibility in solving
our pollution problems.</p>

<p>You neglected to mention one sector that should ultimately
benefit from more stringent emissions standards: the
nuclear-energy industry.</p>
<p>According to the U.S. Council for Energy Awareness, for
every 1,000 megawatts of generating capacity, a coal-fired
utility will annually emit nearly 70,000 tons of sulfur
dioxide, 25,000 tons of nitrogen oxide and 1.6 million tons
of carbon dioxide. The corresponding figures for natural gas
are 17,000, 15,000 and 900,000 tons, respectively. Nuclear
utilities discharge none of these pollutants, nor do they
emit carbon monoxide or methane.</p>

<p>In my opinion, you covered the legislation in an unfairly
negative light. You state the costs to industry as $21
billion, and remark that this exceeds the combined earnings
of several major corporations. However, a fairer comparison
would be with other costs of doing business. The sum of $21
billion, which you present as staggering, will be passed on
to consumers, and works out at less than $70 per capita, a
sum most of us would be happy to pay for clean air.</p>
<p>It is also unfair to present this as some sort of trauma
to the economy. This money is not (so to speak) vanishing
into thin air. It is going into new sectors of the economy,
and represents an opportunity for new business and
technology. Clean air, and other environmental legislation,
is not a blow to the economy, but a shift in the economy,
something that occurs all the time for all sorts of reasons.
True, it will be bad for high-sulfur coal mining, and I for
one would be happy to pay for transitional compensation and
retraining for those affected. But we cannot refuse to make
important social transitions because they carry short-term
costs for certain sectors of the economy. Did anyone suggest
we shore up the horse-drawn buggy business because it was
threatened by the automobile?</p>
<p>Clean technology is the wave of the future because clean
is the way people prefer to live. Custom is not good enough
reason for doing the wrong thing. In fact, the trouble with
the Clean Air Act is that it doesn't go nearly far enough.
If, instead of focusing on reducing tailpipe emissions, the
auto industry had chosen to boost fuel economy, something for
which ample technology already exists, we could have begun to
control not just ground-level air pollution but greenhouse
gases as well. It's time American business divorced itself
from the status quo and realized that the greatest benefits
will come from moving ahead.</p>

<p>Acid rain is not, as your article suggests, some small,
isolated problem related only to the Northeast. Its effects
are being felt throughout the country (Mountain Lake, at an
elevation of 3,500 feet, in the western mountains of
Virginia, is acid-rain dead) and the world. We are not
talking about a minor problem for the 1990s. We are facing
our future.</p>
<p>Industry will continue to drag its collective feet as long
as earnings per share govern performance. When will trustees
and stockholders wake up like most citizens and realize
higher costs are inevitable if we are to survive?</p>
