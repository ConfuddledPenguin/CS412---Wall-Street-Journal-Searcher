	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Wesray Capital Corp. ushered in the 1980s boom
in leveraged buy-outs with its spectacularly profitable
purchase of Gibson Greetings Cards Inc.
   Now the LBO era is waning, and so is Wesray.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Wesray bought Gibson Greetings for $80 million in 1982.
Sixteen months later, it took the card company public. Wesray
equity investors who put up just $1 million of the purchase
price reaped $100 million.</p>
<p>Soon after the Gibson profits became widely known, big
securities firms rushed to set up buy-out departments. The
imitators hoped to repeat the success of Wesray and others in
leveraged buy-outs.</p>
<p>But Wesray's presence has shrunk to a whisper. Former
Treasury Secretary William E. Simon, a co-founder of the
firm, quit in 1987. "The bloom is off the rose," Mr. Simon
said then, implying that he thought the LBO business had
peaked.</p>
<p>More recently, Wesray's other co-founder, Raymond
Chambers, has effectively pulled out of the firm. People who
know Mr. Chambers said he is spending nearly all of his time
on charitable work, including a tutoring program for poor
children in Newark, N.J.</p>
<p>Mr. Chambers's loss was probably more crucial. Gibson
Greetings' financial vice president, Ward Cavanaugh, said,
"Most of our contact was with Ray Chambers." While Mr. Simon
didn't shirk financial details, he was known mostly for his
wide network of business contacts.</p>
<p>Messrs. Simon and Chambers timed their exits nicely. In
their final year together at Wesray, they ranked among the
400 richest people in the U.S., with personal fortunes
estimated by Forbes magazine at $200 million each. Since
then, the buy-out business has wilted, first because of
intense competition and more recently as a result of a
widespread aversion to leverage and high-yield junk bonds.
The two men declined to comment.</p>
<p>Wesray's remaining executives still are making money from
buy-outs, but they are pursuing much smaller deals than the
$600 million purchases that Wesray carried out at its peak.
The firm completed five small buy-outs last year, of which
only one, the $70 million acquisition of Aladdin's Castle
Inc., was publicly announced.</p>
<p>People who have seen Wesray's current portfolio say the
firm has averaged a 70% annual return on 19 buy-outs since
the start of 1987. That's a strong showing, but down
significantly from Wesray's triple-digit returns of the early
1980s.</p>
<p>Wesray stumbled with the 1988 buy-out of Simplicity
Pattern Co., which last summer said it couldn't pay interest
on the junk bonds that helped finance its buy-out.
"Simplicity's equity is worthless, and its bonds are probably
worth five to 10 cents on the dollar," said Julian Schroder,
an analyst at R.D. Smith & Co. Simplicity officials declined
to comment.</p>
<p>As business slows at Wesray, some of its younger
investment bankers, who haven't made Simon-size fortunes yet,
are jumping ship. A Wesray vice president, John Howard, and
two lower-level dealmakers recently quit and joined Vestar
Capital Partners Inc., another New York buy-out group in
which Wesray has a minority investment. Last year, Vestar
completed five buy-outs, and bank lenders regard it as more
active than Wesray.</p>
<p>In its prime, Wesray scored its biggest successes by using
very high leverage, shrinking common equity well below the
10% level that other buy-out groups favored. It wasn't
unusual for common equity to be as little as 1% of a
buy-out's total price. The rest of the money was borrowed or
provided by preferred stock.</p>
<p>"The Wesray formula was great for a few years," said
Gerard Kennell, treasurer of Avis Rent-a-Car. Avis was
acquired by Wesray in a 1986 buy-out in which less than 7% of
the purchase price was equity. The buy-out was a typical
Wesray success. It produced profits of more than 20 times the
equity invested. "But it's become harder to do those kinds of
deals," Mr. Kennell said. "Banks are looking for a lot more
equity" before they finance such a transaction.</p>
<p>While Wesray President Frank Richardson and Chairman Frank
Walsh declined to be interviewed, one major Wesray investor
denies market rumors that the firm is thinking of closing its
New York office or disbanding. "That's not true at all," said
this investor, who declined to be identified. "Some fellows
are taking an active role at Vestar, which we regard as part
of the same family. Everyone else in our New York office will
remain. The New Jersey office has had, and will continue to
have, more people," he said. (Wesray has dual headquarters in
New York and Morristown, N.J.)</p>
<p>Still, indications are that Wesray is switching its focus
away from the once-glamorous LBO area. Instead, it may opt
for duller but more conventional types of investing. Wesray
has only its own executives' money to invest; it never raised
a buy-out fund from outside investors.</p>
<p>"Wesray is likely to diversify its investments over time,"
the Wesray investor said. Among the firm's possibilities are
looking for profits in depressed junk bonds, taking minority
equity positions in companies, and hiring outside managers to
invest some of the Wesray partners' money. "It's a business
that will go through a number of chapters," the Wesray
investor said.</p>
<p>In fact, some people think Wesray's retreat may be the
smartest way to deal with the new anti-leverage climate.
"Their returns have always been stupendous -- some of the
best in the business," said Domenic Baione, a lender at
Manufacturers Hanover Trust Co. "Whatever else happens,
they've had a great run."</p>
