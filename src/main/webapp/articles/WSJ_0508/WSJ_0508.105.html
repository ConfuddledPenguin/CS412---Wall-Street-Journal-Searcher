	<p class="article-leader">GAMAGORI, Japan -- Oddly enough for an island nation,
Japan isn't exactly awash in old salts. Which poses a bit of
a problem in its quest for yachting's most prestigious prize,
the America's Cup.
   Japan had to resort to the want-ads to find enough sailors
for its team. A tendency toward seasickness was no cause for
disqualification. Neither was inexperience.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"At first, I was so scared when the boat heeled," says
Matsuyoshi Nishikawa, 25, a former white-collar worker who,
despite never having sailed before, made the cut. "We are so
behind," he says humbly, "but we want to try hard to win."</p>
<p>Another American institution will be up for grabs in 1992,
and Japan is determined to bring this one home for the
mantle. "We can't bring back Rockefeller Center. We can't
bring back Columbia Pictures," says Kaoru Ogimi, vice
commodore of the Nippon Ocean Racing Club. "But we want to
bring back the America's Cup."</p>
<p>No expense is being spared in the quest for the ornate
silver chalice nicknamed the "Auld Mug." Some 30 of Japan's
biggest corporations, including Mazda Motor Corp. and Yamaha
Motor Co., have agreed to bankroll the effort by the Nippon
Club, which is challenging the current cup holder, the San
Diego Yacht Club. American yacht racing enthusiasts believe
the Japanese may spend as much as $100 million -- four times
as much as the San Diegans are estimated to have spent to win
the last race in 1988.</p>
<p>Nippon Challenge, the syndicate backing the club, won't
discuss its budget, but its deep pockets are the talk of the
yachting world. "The Japanese may well become the fear of the
America's Cup," says Andrew A. Johns, the New Zealand lawyer
who masterminded his countrymen's boat-design strategy for
the last race. (The New Zealanders, sailing a single-hulled
boat, were beaten by the Americans, who sailed a catamaran,
in that controversial race. The New Zealanders promptly
launched a court battle, which was ultimately resolved in the
Americans' favor two weeks ago.)</p>
<p>Some of Nippon Challenge's money is going to pay the
salaries of Roy Dickson, a New Zealander who is considered
one of the world's leading sailing coaches, and his son
Chris, the world's top-ranked sailor on the match-racing
circuit. Chris will be at the helm during the race.</p>
<p>Multi-national crews are permitted under the rules
governing the America's Cup, but there was some grumbling
among nationalists here about having foreigners involved in
the quest for the cup. Yachties here concede they need help
whipping a green crew into shape, so the complaints were
brushed aside.</p>
<p>Coach Dickson runs a tight ship. Training begins every day
at 6:30 a.m. with a grueling workout before breakfast. The
crew's day doesn't end until after a 7:30 p.m. "reflection
meeting" to discuss the group's performance that day. The day
is tightly scheduled from reveille to taps, and it includes
language lessons, since most sailing terms are in English.
Tardiness isn't tolerated. Sailors even a few minutes late
are ordered to hit the deck and do push-ups.</p>
<p>"I didn't even know what the America's Cup was," says one
of the sailors, Taketaro Suizu. The 26-year-old former office
worker wasn't exactly a landlubber; he had gotten his sea
legs wind-surfing on weekends. After seeing the syndicate's
ad, he decided to give yachting a try. Mr. Suizu is the
pitman, and his job is to bag sails in the bowels of the
boat. That translates roughly to hauling about a half-ton of
wet wash a day. Despite the unglamorous work, Mr. Suizu says
he is enjoying his new career.</p>
<p>Base camp is this sleepy resort village on the edge of
Mikawa Bay, three hours by bullet train southwest of Tokyo.
The site was chosen because the wind and water conditions are
similar to those off sunny San Diego, where the next race
will be held.</p>
<p>A few weeks ago, Nippon Challenge unveiled its first
racing yacht, a sleek 24-meter boat with a stunning 35-meter
carbon-fiber mast. The boat is brimming with high-tech
gadgetry. Cameras atop the mast measure sail configurations;
the data are fed into computers for analysis.</p>
<p>A Shinto purification ceremony preceded the launching of
the Nippon. Near the dock was a small altar with offerings of
bananas, carrots and large white radishes. A Shinto priest in
a bright orange robe prayed and shook a sacred staff with
white streamers toward the boat to ward off evil spirits.
Then the dignitaries, among them Princess Tomohito of Mikasa,
a member of the Imperial Family, sipped sake and toasted the
effort.</p>
<p>After the ceremony, the team took to the sea to
demonstrate the capabilities of the boat, the first of
several the syndicate expects to build. The cloudy skies and
choppy waters didn't deter curious local sailors, who came
out to see the Nippon. The racing boat's crisp white sails
caught the breeze, and it shot through the water, leaving
behind the scores of small boats bobbing in the bay.</p>
<p>The Japanese are among 14 challengers from 11 nations
seeking the oldest trophy in sport. There is no prize money
for the winning team. At stake is prestige -- and the
attention of the world's sports buffs.</p>
<p>To raise money for the effort, Nippon Challenge appealed
to national pride. "There won't be any profit in it for you,"
Taro Kimura, a well-known television newscaster and a member
of the syndicate's executive committee, recalls telling
corporate executives and others. "You have to do this for
Japan." Dozens heeded the call.</p>
<p>CSK Corp., a leading computer software firm, donated
supercomputer time. Shipbuilder Ishikawajima-Harima Heavy
Industries Co. gave the syndicate's yacht designers unlimited
access to a testing tank, in which they analyzed a model
boat's performance. Tokyo University provided use of a highly
sophisticated wind tunnel to test sail configurations.</p>
<p>All this is being done in an effort to win a race once
derided by the legendary New York Times sports columnist Red
Smith as "the trivial adventures of millionaires getting
their bottoms wet." The America's Cup began in 1851, when a
U.S. schooner beat a British fleet in a race around the Isle
of Wight. The Americans forced subsequent challengers to come
to their shores and race -- a strategy that favored the home
team for 132 years -- until 1983.</p>
<p>That year, in a stunning reversal, the Australians
snatched the trophy from the Americans. That defeat was an
inspiration to Tatsumitsu Yamazaki, a yachtsman and the
chairman of S&B Shokuhin Co., which is a household name in
spices and sauces in Japan. He decided it was a propitious
time for the Nippon Ocean Racing Club.</p>
<p>Mr. Yamazaki rounded up a clique of fellow yachties -- all
of them business and media barons -- and announced the
group's intention to seek the cup. He says he is delighted
with the syndicate's progress so far. "The cup," he says, "is
within our reach."</p>
<p>Still, the Japanese have a way to go. Makoto Namba, the
team's captain, recently admitted that the crew's performance
on the Nippon was only about 60%. But there is no doubt the
team is already well-steeped in the spirit of the America's
Cup. Stretching across the wall in the sail loft at the base
camp is a banner that reads "There is no second."</p>
