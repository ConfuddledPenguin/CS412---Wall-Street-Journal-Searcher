	<p class="article-leader">Despite the assertions in your March 30 page-one article
on the "Forest Crisis," the practice of "clear-cutting" is
the inevitable culmination of sound forestry management.
   In a silviculturally correct forest-management system,
"clear-cutting" replaces natural processes such as insect
infestation, wildfire and old-age decline as the method to
regenerate forest land. "Clearcutting" as it is currently
practiced on federal land and most corporate forest land is
accomplished on an "interdisciplinary basis." Soil
scientists, soil hydrologists, wildlife biologists, fisheries
biologists, silvicultural experts (foresters), botanists and
entomologists all must enmesh their prospective disciplines
to ensure that all resources are conserved during harvesting
and that a clear-cut site will be completely regenerated to a
new stand within five years.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Properly practiced clear-cutting absolutely does not
result in the following: "forest crisis, ecological threats,
wastelands, eradicated wildlife habitat, eroded topsoil,
fouled spawning beds, last stroke against biointegrity,
despoiling, ruination of nearby streams, devastation or
lasting damage" as alluded to in your article.</p>

<p>Reading your article about the forests of Prince William
Sound, I was struck by an inference increasingly common in
the press that forest clear-cutting is inherently bad.</p>
<p>Clear-cutting can result in two distinctly different
biological results, depending on where and how it is applied:
reforestation or deforestation.</p>
<p>In its application to obtain reforestation, it is an
important and valid option. For many tree species where
intensive forest management to maximize forest productivity
is practiced, clear-cutting is used to recover and use all
merchantable timber from a site prior to planting. Often,
planting is the only method of stand regeneration that will
consistently result in restocking with appropriate species
and suitable spacing. In these situations, where cutting is
done according to environmentally sound logging practices, no
significant erosion or site degradation occurs.</p>
<p>Certain other tree species require large openings in the
forest to reproduce naturally. Many Eastern hardwoods, for
example, fall in this category. Here, again, clear-cutting is
the preferred method of reforestation.</p>
<p>Where neither planting nor satisfactory natural
regeneration occurs, deforestation is the result of
clear-cutting. Too often, the term "clear-cutting" is
employed where what we really intend to say is
"deforestation."</p>
