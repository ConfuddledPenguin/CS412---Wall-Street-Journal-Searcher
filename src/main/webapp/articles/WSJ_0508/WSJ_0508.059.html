	<p class="article-leader">SAO PAULO, Brazil -- General Motors Corp., Ford Motor Co.
and Volkswagen AG didn't produce a car here for five weeks.
   Pansophic System Inc., a U.S. software company, closed its
Brazilian operation.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Mannesmann AG, a West German steel company, is laying off
workers. Belgian chemical maker Solvay & Cie. has put off its
investment projects.</p>
<p>The sweeping anti-inflation plan unveiled last month by
Brazilian President Fernando Collor de Mello hasn't just
affected the lives of 145 million Brazilians. Foreign
companies operating here are also feeling the pinch.</p>
<p>Indeed, as Brazil braces for recession following the
freeze on some deposits imposed by Mr. Collor to break the
back of Brazil's runaway inflation, the earnings and stock
performance of multinational corporations could be adversely
affected by their Brazilian affiliates' woes. Mr. Collor's
plan removed 70% of Brazil's money from circulation through a
partial 18-month freeze on savings accounts and short-term
financial instruments.</p>
<p>In the past few weeks, such U.S. giants as auto maker
Ford, tractor-maker Caterpillar Inc. and health concern
Johnson & Johnson have all indicated their 1990 earnings
could be hurt as a result of the Brazilian economic plan, and
other major companies could follow suit. A recent study by
PaineWebber Inc. identified more than 100 U.S. companies with
affiliates in Brazil but said the impact of the plan varies
from company to company. In Europe, shares of some companies
with big operations in Brazil have fallen, and such concerns
as Daimler-Benz AG, which makes trucks in Brazil, also warned
its profits could be hurt by Brazil's slowdown.</p>
<p>Like Brazilian companies, multinationals saw their markets
shrink and their money for salaries and bills and investments
disappear under the effect of the freeze. And just as for
their Brazilian counterparts, these past six weeks have been
a daily struggle to find creative ways of raising cash and
cutting costs without paying too high a price socially or
economically.</p>
<p>"The combination of our business being cut in half and our
cash being tied up means we've spent a lot of time wondering
how we'd get through these next few months and continue our
investment projects," says James Nisbet, president of
Monsanto Co.'s Monsanto do Brasil S.A. affiliate. "We've gone
from making good money to losing money in April and trying to
break even the next few months so we don't have to lay off
people."</p>
<p>Multinationals don't get much sympathy. The Brazilian
government suggests they ask their parent companies for money
to deal with their problems -- to which most parent companies
retort that their affiliates have to solve the problems
themselves. Upset by the attitude of auto makers -- which
stopped production, arguing that there was no demand while
dealers kept charging high interest for cars -- Mr. Collor
indicated last week he would facilitate imports of foreign
cars and allow more foreign auto makers to start
manufacturing to spur competition.</p>
<p>Some small companies here blame the multinationals for
their problems. Horst Schaade, president of a small Sao Paulo
company that makes machines for several multinationals,
blames the drop in his business on "irresponsible"
multinationals. "Because they don't have orders, they think
they have the right to stop orders they made with us," he
says. "They're working against Brazil."</p>
<p>To be sure, all companies aren't suffering as badly, and
many companies say it will take months to see how serious the
problems are. Many say activity is starting to pick up after
grinding to a halt in the wake of the liquidity freeze,
albeit at lower levels than before. Some companies, such as
Dow Chemical Co.'s Dow Quimica affiliate, are looking to
exports to compensate for the declining domestic market.
Others, such as N.V. Philips of the Netherlands, are shifting
to less-expensive electronic goods to boost activity.</p>
<p>And some companies, particularly in the food and beverage
sector, are hurt less than heavy industry is. At Kibon S.A.,
an ice cream maker controlled by Philip Morris Cos.' Kraft
General Foods unit, the worst that will happen is that it
will "lose part of the excess of a better-than-usual season,"
says its president, Peter Schreer. Anticipating some sort of
freeze on financial assets, Kibon had invested much of its
cash in "strategic assets" such as milk, and had enough money
left to meet its payroll, Mr. Schreer says. "I'm broke, but
at least I paid my payroll."</p>
<p>Many companies aren't so lucky. Mr. Collor's plan has
frozen much of the money multinationals use to pay employees
or invest. His actions also touched off a chain reaction that
is undermining producers of raw materials, capital goods and
better consumer goods: When consumers have no money, they
don't buy. When they don't buy, companies don't produce. When
they don't produce, suppliers stop selling. And when no one
buys or sells, companies talk about lowering salaries, which
will slow the economy still more.</p>
<p>"Collor had three things to do: stop inflation, stop
inflation, and stop inflation," says Robert Stone, president
of General Motors do Brasil. "It's really working. But from
the business side, it's devastating. When you grab all the
money, you grab all the money with which people buy cars."</p>
<p>Indeed, auto makers were among the hardest-hit by the
plan. Of the four car makers operating in Brazil -- GM, Ford,
Volkswagen and Fiat -- all but Fiat completely stopped
production for five weeks after the unveiling of the plan,
putting all their assembly-line workers on paid leave. This
week, cars started rolling off again, but at a much slower
pace, and car makers face bleak earnings prospects.</p>
<p>"We'll try to be a break-even company for the next several
months," Mr. Stone says. "We didn't sell a single car in the
first two weeks after the plan, and then a few cars started
moving," he adds. "We sold about 50% of our normal level of
sales in April {10,000 cars instead of 20,000}, and though
things look a little better now, we're still far from the
levels we had before the plan."</p>
<p>Multinationals aren't too happy about the freezing of
funds, either. "We were surprised by the extent of the plan
and, like most people, somewhat caught offguard by the
liquidity squeeze," says Monsanto's Mr. Nisbet. He says about
$20 million of the company's money was frozen, forcing
Monsanto to borrow from the bank to pay salaries, think of
new ways to finance its planned investments and impose "an
all-out contingency cost-control plan," Mr. Nisbet says. Now,
he says, "we're within days of a share-and-share-alike talk
with employees, telling them we have to cut wages so as not
to lay off," he says. Like most companies, he says, capacity
has been greatly reduced, and Monsanto "will be nip and tuck
at 50% to 60% capacity to break even."</p>
