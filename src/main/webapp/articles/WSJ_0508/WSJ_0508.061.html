	<p class="article-leader">HARRISBURG, Pa. -- Insurance regulators have asked a state
court to block Safeco Insurance Co. of America's refusal to
renew its 8,000 auto-insurance policies in Pennsylvania.
   Safeco's refusal may be illegal under a 1968 state law
that governs the circumstances that allow an insurer to stop
renewing policies.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Safeco, a unit of Seattle-based Safeco Corp., has already
ignored a cease and desist order, issued by the Pennsylvania
Insurance Department last week when it learned that the
insurer was sending out the nonrenewal notices. The insurance
department now wants the court to issue a mandatory
injunction to keep Safeco from canceling its policies.</p>
<p>Today the insurance department will ask the same court to
preliminarily block Harleysville Mutual Insurance Co. from
canceling its 1,200 policies as they come due.</p>
<p>Safeco and Harleysville are two of more than 100 insurance
companies that have failed to comply with an auto-insurance
law passed by the Pennsylvania state legislature in February.
Some have asked for permission to raise their auto rates when
they should be lowering them and two companies have tried to
pull out of Pennsylvania entirely.</p>
<p>Insurers had to file by May 1 a new schedule of auto
insurance premium rates, incorporating the rate rollbacks
mandated by the new law. The law calls for rollbacks of 10%
for all drivers and up to 22% for those who gave up their
right to sue in court except in cases of severe injuries. The
rollbacks are due to begin July 1.</p>
<p>Robert Casey, Pennsylvania's governor, has asked the
insurance department to explore all legal options to prevent
insurance companies from thwarting the implementation of the
law.</p>
<p>"We don't intend to sit by while the industry maneuvers
through countless lawsuits, failure to file in a timely
manner and other dilatory tactics to deny policyholders the
rate relief they are entitled to under the law," said
Constance B. Foster, Pennsylvania's insurance commissioner.</p>
<p>A Safeco official said the company hadn't yet seen any
court papers filed by the insurance department and couldn't
comment.</p>
