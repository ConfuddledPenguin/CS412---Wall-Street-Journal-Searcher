	<p class="article-leader">STOCKHOLM -- Bain & Co. agreed to join a leveraged buy-out
of Swedish management consultant Indevo AB and gained an
option to take full control later this year in a transaction
valued at 300 million Swedish kronor ($49.4 million).
   A Bain official said that, if completed, the Indevo
acquisition would be the Boston-based management consultant's
biggest to date. Bain currently lacks permanent
representation in Scandinavia. But swallowing Indevo, which
claims to be Sweden's biggest management consultant, would
bring the U.S. concern a 20% share of an estimated 1.2
billion kronor market, expanding at a rate of nearly 40% a
year.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Bain expects the local connection to increase its clout
with Sweden's big international companies. But Indevo also
has been involved in the restructuring of Sweden's
state-owned railways and national postal service. Some
industry analysts think urgently needed reform of the
sprawling public sector will become a major source of new
business for management consultants in coming years.</p>
<p>Peter Toernqvist, a Munich-based Bain director, said the
U.S. firm has handled assignments from Swedish corporate
clients for several years, but always on a one-time basis.
"We've lacked staying power, a disadvantage when you don't
have your own representation," he said.</p>
