	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- General Host Corp. gave an optimistic outlook
for its 272 Frank's Nursery & Crafts stores but said it
expects a $2.7 million charge for the fiscal first quarter on
an equity investment.
   Speaking to analysts here, Harris J. Ashton, chairman and
chief executive officer, said the charge will be offset as
the company eliminates certain income-tax reserves.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The charge and reserve reversal, $35 million of
senior-debt payments, and repurchase of $5 million of
mortgage notes at a discount will clean up the balance sheet
and add two cents a share to profit for the quarter ending
May 20, the executive said.</p>
<p>Mr. Ashton declined to estimate earnings, though operating
results for the first quarter, General Host's strongest
because it covers the spring planting season, should be
"pretty excellent."</p>
<p>The quarter's sales to date are up 6.6%, and 4.3% on a
same-store basis, from the year-earlier period, he said. A
year ago, first-period net income was $1.5 million, or eight
cents a share, on total sales of $158.6 million.</p>
<p>The Stamford, Conn., company has cut its advertising costs
$4 million in the first quarter, while sales have risen, Mr.
Ashton said. By running ads as part of newspapers' text
rather than in expensive separate inserts, General Host hopes
to cut fiscal 1991 ad costs to 5% of sales vs. 6.9% a year
earlier, said a spokesman.</p>
<p>Capital spending will range from $10 million to $15
million this fiscal year, General Host said, as the company
opens as many as 10 new stores and installs laser-scanning
registers at all stores.</p>
<p>Mr. Ashton said that in fiscal 1990, the company
substantially completed payments of damages arising from a
1977 lawsuit charging a former General Host subsidiary,
American Salt Co., with polluting ground water on farm land.
General Host sold the salt manufacturer in 1977.</p>
