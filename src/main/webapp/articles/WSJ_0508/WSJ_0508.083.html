	<p class="article-leader">LOS ANGELES -- Medco Research Inc. said it fired its
director of research and medical affairs, Dr. William C.
Govier, Friday.
   The company also said Dr. Govier and the company had been
named as defendants in a lawsuit filed by two shareholders
alleging that he violated securities law when he sold stock
in the company in March. In April, the company said an
investment-banking firm had been pursuing the potential sale
of the concern but that several prospective buyers weren't
interested. It said it was continuing to explore the sale of
the company, and said it had been forced to issue a news
release because of rumors.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Vice President Sanford J. Hillsberg wouldn't say whether
Dr. Govier's departure was related to the suit. Dr. Govier
joined the company in 1987, and signed a new one-year
contract March 1. He couldn't be reached. Prior to joining
Medco, Dr. Govier was director of pharmaceuticals research
and development at Du Pont Co.</p>
<p>Separately, two New York investment partnerships disclosed
in a Securities and Exchange Commission filing that they hold
a 5.46% stake in Medco. The two funds, EGS Associates Limited
Partnership and EGS Partners Limited Partnership, are managed
by two former securities analysts specializing in
pharmaceuticals and chemicals companies.</p>
<p>Medco develops treatments and diagnoses of cardiovascular
diseases, and last year won federal approval for Adenocard, a
new drug. "We like its products," said EGS general partner,
Joseph Salvani.</p>
