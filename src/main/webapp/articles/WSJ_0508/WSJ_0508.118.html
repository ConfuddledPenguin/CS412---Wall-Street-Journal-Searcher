	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Carl Icahn's failure to win a referendum of
USX Corp. shareholders leaves the investor holding a 13.3%
block of USX stock that has less value than when he launched
his proxy campaign two months ago.
   Wall Street takeover experts expect Mr. Icahn to continue
to try to maneuver to boost the value of his USX stock, which
he acquired for roughly $800 million, possibly by encouraging
an energy company to bid for USX's Marathon Oil unit.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>In an interview, Mr. Icahn said he had gained "a nucleus
of supportive shareholders, and we intend to stay in touch
with everybody." He wouldn't comment on any effort he may
make to attract a partner to bid for Marathon.</p>
<p>But Mr. Icahn is handicapped by a poison-pill
anti-takeover device, which effectively bars him from trying
to put further pressure on USX management by boosting his
stake above 15%. He has lost some credibility by falling
short in this vote. At the same time, Mr. Icahn must also
deal with heavy losses at Trans World Airlines, of which he
owns 90%.</p>
<p>Mr. Icahn needn't despair. He still has roughly $2 billion
in cash, mainly from a sale of Texaco Inc. stock last year,
and is dabbling in investments in the depressed market for
high-risk, high-yield junk bonds as well as companies choking
with too much debt.</p>
<p>Nor was his loss surprising. Analysts had predicted Mr.
Icahn would lose, because he wasn't offering to buy the
entire company. Mr. Icahn had argued that his proposal for
USX to spin off its steel operations would produce value of
$48 a share.</p>
<p>But the vote underscores how much the world has changed
since Mr. Icahn acquired 11% of USX in the fall of 1986, just
before Ivan Boesky pleaded guilty in the government's insider
trading investigation and gave prosecutors information that
eventually toppled Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc., Mr. Icahn's
investment bank.</p>
<p>With Drexel gone and the market for junk bonds in a state
of near-collapse, Mr. Icahn lacked access to financing that
would have allowed him to threaten a hostile bid for USX.
That "takes a lot of the sharpness out of his teeth," said
Michael Lamb, president of Wealth Monitors Inc., a Kansas
City, Mo., newsletter that tracks big investors. "The whole
junk-bond market is topsy-turvy, and that throws out the
window a lot of the pressure that agressive investors were
able to put on management."</p>
<p>Mr. Icahn disputed Mr. Lamb's contention that the loss of
Drexel has reduced his ability to put pressure on USX
management, saying, "I think $2 billion in cash is a pretty
good tooth."</p>
<p>When Mr. Icahn announced his referendum on March 8, USX
stock rose $1 a share to $36.625. Yesterday, USX shares fell
50 cents to $33.50 in composite trading on the New York Stock
Exchange. The reasons include falling oil prices, lower
expected prices for energy assets USX is selling, and Mr.
Icahn's expected proxy loss.</p>
<p>Although Mr. Icahn is showing a substantial paper profit
on his stake, which he acquired for less than $24 a share, he
remains stuck in the position with no clear exit. What's
more, his long holding period has reduced his indicated
return on an $800 million investment to roughly 12% annually
-- not much different than he could have obtained in a stock
index mutual fund. Mr. Icahn said that buying on margin --
using borrowed funds to finance half his original
purchase-has boosted his return to roughly 23%.</p>
<p>And if Mr. Icahn tried to sell his big USX stake, traders
say, he might well have to accept less than the current
market price, unless he could find an energy company willing
to buy the block as a first step toward a bid for control.</p>
<p>Last summer, Mr. Icahn surprised traders by selling a much
larger block of Texaco stock for about $2 billion, at only a
slight discount to the market price. However, Texaco's stock
price at the time had been propped up by two large one-time
dividends, which Texaco had agreed to pay during a proxy
battle Mr. Icahn waged unsuccessfully to oust management.</p>
<p>Although Mr. Icahn is still sitting on the cash from that
sale, he faces a cash drain at Trans World Airlines because
of rising interest costs from $2.8 billion in debt. Mr. Icahn
has been selling assets and refinancing aircraft to make debt
repayments.</p>
<p>TWA reported a profit of about $250 million in 1988,
thanks partly to big gains on Mr. Icahn's Texaco stake. But
last year the airline had a loss of nearly $300 million. Mr.
Icahn said TWA's 1989 loss didn't include more than $100
million in unrealized investment profits.</p>
<p>While Mr. Icahn has recovered his investment in TWA by
piling more debt on the airline, he remains locked in a
bitter battle with its unions, and is seeking a 10% pay cut
from the pilots. The airline continues to devour his time,
and remains important to his credibility in future
investments.</p>
