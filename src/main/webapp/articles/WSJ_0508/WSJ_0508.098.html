	<p class="article-leader">NEWPORT, Ark. -- These flatlands east of the Ozarks have
been very good to the Conner family. The family's farming
operation controls 35,000 acres of wheat fields and terraced
rice land here -- a stake that helps make the Conners the
leading property owners in Jackson County.
   In the 1980s, drought and plunging crop prices devastated
many farmers in this area. But not the Conners. They
prospered by raking in millions of federal crop subsidy
dollars, which allowed them to expand holdings that now
include a local mall, interests in John Deere and Chevrolet
dealerships and a real-estate firm.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The trouble is, the Conners may have gotten much of this
money in violation of the law.</p>
<p>Last year, a team of federal auditors concluded that John
Conner Jr., the 41-year-old family member who runs the farms
with his father, improperly collected $2.8 million in federal
payments -- the largest recorded abuse of America's farm
subsidy system.</p>
<p>When Congress set limits on crop subsidy payments in 1970,
it intended to guarantee a fair return for farmers even if
the price of their crops fell through the floor. In part to
focus the program on small farmers, it restricted its
largess: Under current law, individual farmers aren't allowed
to collect any more than $250,000 in subsidy payments in any
one year.</p>
<p>For a big operation like the Conners', $250,000 is
peanuts. So John Conner Jr. devised a plan: He divided his
farm holdings into many smaller pieces, each one of which
collected the maximum subsidy. This involved a labyrinth of
corporate entities and elaborate bookkeeping. Eventually
nearly everyone in the family got in on the act, plus a few
others.</p>
<p>All told, 17 relatives, 10 employees, 13 corporations,
three partnerships and six trusts helped harvest the money.
The government would send checks to the relatives and
corporations, who would then turn over the funds -- in the
form of rent payments and fees -- to a company headed by John
Jr. and a partnership owned by the Conner family. A Conner
real-estate firm kept track of who owed what to whom. The
Conners say the government knew all along about their setup
and add that they even had approval from the Agriculture
Department.</p>
<p>Though the Conner case is the largest ever uncovered, it
is far from unique. Even though total farm acreage has
remained constant in recent years, new "farmers" have been
sprouting up everywhere. The government believes this is
partly because of efforts to evade payment limits.</p>
<p>Concerned that hundreds of millions of dollars are being
squandered, several congressmen have called for tightening
the government spigot. Even some prominent farm-state
legislators, such as Dan Glickman, the Democrat from Kansas,
say they are considering promoting new restrictions.</p>
<p>They are also concerned about evidence that local offices
of the U.S. Department of Agriculture have looked the other
way -- or even helped set up arrangements similar to the
Conners'. John Conner Jr. says government officials here were
aware of everything he did. "I didn't turn around without
letting Floyd Campbell know about it," he says. Mr. Campbell
runs Jackson County's office of the agriculture department's
Agricultural Stabilization and Conservation Service, which
pays the subsidies.</p>
<p>Indeed, the Agriculture Department -- bucking its auditors
-- has asked the Conners to pay back only $2.3 million of the
$2.8 million overpayment, saying the family didn't
intentionally violate the law. Notably, the agency's records
show that it routinely approved many of the steps the Conners
took. The auditors, who work for the department's inspector
general, also found Mr. Campbell himself violated certain
landlord-tenant rules and improperly collected thousands of
dollars in federal payments on farm property he rented from a
large insurance company, for which Mr. Conner acted as rental
agent. The Agriculture Department, however, disagreed with
the auditors and sided with Mr. Campbell on the matter.</p>
<p>For his part, Mr. Campbell asserts that he didn't violate
federal rules. And as for the bigger Conner case, he says his
office failed to detect any improper payments because his
staff is overworked.</p>
<p>Jackson County isn't the only area that has come under
scrutiny. In another case, the inspector general's office
criticized a "lack of commitment" by the Agriculture
Department in Jefferson County, Ark., where two senior
officials of the agency's office were found to have
improperly collected overpayments totaling $407,000 in 1987
on land they owned. (It isn't uncommon for Agriculture
Department field officers to be local farmers themselves.)</p>
<p>Moreover, in 1987, the Agriculture Department's inspector
general found it had given a total of more than 130 farmers
in Arkansas improper subsidies totaling millions of dollars.
But it figured the farmers had relied on the agency's own bad
advice, so it didn't force any repayment.</p>
<p>"The Agriculture Department has been a reluctant
dragon-slayer," says New York Democratic Congressman Charles
Schumer, who is urging tougher subsidy rules. "Payment limits
and their prosecution haven't been a high priority."</p>
<p>But William Penn, an assistant deputy administrator at the
Agriculture Department, believes the agency has become more
aggressive, and notes that it has restaffed its Arkansas
state office. He also says new federal regulations that
became effective in 1989 have helped enforcement.</p>
<p>"We're continuing to try to plug the holes," he says. "But
payment limits are a tough program to administer because
every time you come up with a rule, someone will find a way
to circumvent its intent."</p>
<p>In theory, the crop support program is a simple one: It
sets a target price that it feels farmers should be making.
When market prices fall below that level, the U.S. gives a
check for the difference.</p>
<p>But loopholes often render the limits ineffective. While
regulations say a subsidy recipient must be "actively
engaged" in either farm labor or management, investigators
find it hard to prove that sort of connection. "They can live
a thousand miles away and say they make all the decisions. I
don't know how we would disprove it," says John O. Leavy, the
Agriculture Department's regional inspector general for audit
in Temple, Texas.</p>
<p>As a result, enterprising farmers have often found ways
around the law -- and regardless of how the Conner case is
resolved, John Jr. was clearly enterprising. A 1970 business
graduate of the University of Arkansas, he began taking over
the reins of his family's business after a stint in the
National Guard. He often worked 14-hour days running the
farms, barking out instructions to employees.</p>
<p>"John Jr.'s a workaholic," his mother says of him. "I wish
he had a few hobbies."</p>
<p>The family's blossoming farming operation -- and the
dispute over the support payments -- have made John Jr. a
major figure in Newport, population 8,300. Not since Elvis
Presley played at Porky's Rooftop, a Newport tavern, back in
the early 1950s has there been such a stir. A local liquor
store still honors the star's visit by selling ceramic
whiskey decanters that look like Elvis and play "Love Me
Tender."</p>
<p>The Conner legacy dates back to John Jr.'s grandfather,
R.G. Holden, who cleared much of the land around Newport by
tearing out tree stumps with farmhands and scores of mules. A
Holden Ave. still runs through town, in honor of the Holden
family.</p>
<p>When R.G. Holden died, he left much of his estate to his
daughter, Mary Alice, and her husband, John Conner Sr. She is
a stylish woman whom neighbors describe as the matriarch of
Newport society. He is a lifelong farmer and trained
accountant who sets his hat at a jaunty angle as he drives
his pickup along country roads inspecting the family land.
Their spacious brick house fronts on a bass-filled,
cypress-lined creek and the Newport country club's golf
course. A friend calls the family "rock-solid" Baptists.</p>
<p>Both John Sr. and his son believe their relative
prosperity is what caused the government to scrutinize them.
"Why else would somebody shoot your tires out like this?"
asks the elder Mr. Conner.</p>
<p>The Conners say their life style and business were
threatened in the 1980s by the same problems that were making
life miserable for other local farmers. Along with many
others, they decided to seek federal subsidies to stay
afloat. As prices for their crops fell, subsidy payments to
many farmers swelled to near federal limits. The Conners, who
were heavily invested in land and farm equipment, contend
that, by 1986, subsidies they were getting weren't enough for
them to break even.</p>
<p>At the time, many larger farmers responded to the problem
by leasing out their property. Federal law does allow tenants
to collect subsidies and pay rent to landowners, thus
assuring an income for the landlord.</p>
<p>But John Jr. went a step further, the government auditors
assert. He created four new corporations -- in addition to
nine already existing -- and enlisted the aid of relatives,
including sister Mary Alice Humphrey in Dallas and cousin Ann
Dillard in Little Rock, who both collected money through
partnerships. He also used trusts set up for his children,
including his twin girls, who were eight years old at the
time.</p>
<p>Katherine Conner, John Jr.'s 66-year-old aunt, says she
didn't even know she was listed as receiving federal checks.
"Listen, I don't know the first thing about this," she says.
"John and them set this up. I'm not a farmer." Lelia Holden,
88, the frail and white-haired widow of R.G. Holden who
collected $126,909 in federal subsidies over two years, says
the same thing.</p>
<p>"I don't know anything" about the farming operations, says
Mrs. Holden, wearing a pink housecoat and watching "Jeopardy"
in her home. "All the checks must go into the office because
I don't see them. John Sr. and Jr. handle all my business."</p>
<p>Such arrangements wouldn't necessarily have violated
federal regulations, since people out of town or those not
working the land could legally have collected farm money as
landowners. But the staff of the inspector general's office
found the Conner family's business activities were
"controlled" by John Jr. and weren't "separate and distinct"
enough to qualify for federal support. John Jr.'s office kept
the books for partnerships and corporations through which his
sister, aunt, grandmother and cousin were sent money. Checks
for three of the four went to his office.</p>
<p>Conner family employees and others also paid rent to
family entities. But the farm lease arrangements, auditors
found, included such curious features as "arbitrary" changes
of rental amounts and rent payments to entities with no
interest in the farming operation. Twenty-five of the
Conners' subsidy recipients paid most of their federal
earnings to companies controlled by John Jr. for "custom
farming," which means that someone other than the subsidy
recipients did the actual farm work. The auditors concluded
that the arrangements were chiefly designed to pass money
along to the Conner family.</p>
<p>The Conners say the fees were legal and customary. But
investigators found they were excessive and ran afoul of
another government payment rule: At the time, anyone who
owned or leased farmland wasn't allowed to also get custom
farming fees on the same property.</p>
<p>Some bank accounts of Conner employees, too, appeared to
be conduits for federal money to automatically pass through
to the Conner family. Max Felts, a burly farmhand from east
Arkansas's Mississippi County who worked for the Conners,
started receiving federal checks in 1986. Mr. Felts and John
Jr. describe this arrangement as simply a means for Mr. Felts
to start farming on his own.</p>
<p>But bank records attached to the government's audit report
show he made repeated payments to Holden-Conner Farms Inc.
and a Conner family partnership for rent and "custom farming"
immediately after getting federal checks or bank loans. This
happened even when Holden-Conner's own records didn't show
him owing any money.</p>
<p>The entire arrangement went undetected until a
Newport-area farmer complained to the inspector general's
office in Texas, which then took 15 months to complete its
report. The Agriculture Department eventually did send the
Conner subsidy recipients a bill for $2.3 million. The
Conners, in turn, have appealed the assessment to the
agency's headquarters in Washington. The government has
withheld subsequent payments to the Conner group.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the auditors have been complaining internally
that the inspector general's criminal investigation division
hasn't taken up the case, though 10 months have passed since
the audit was completed. Officials in the criminal
investigation office declined to comment.</p>
