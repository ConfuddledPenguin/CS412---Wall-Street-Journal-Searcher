	<p class="article-leader">Chrysler Corp. is recalling about 383,700 of its
1985-model cars because they fail to meet federal
auto-exhaust standards for hydrocarbons and carbon monoxide,
the Environmental Protection Agency announced in Washington.
   The company agreed to the recall after the EPA discovered
the problem during routine testing. The affected models are
the Plymouth Horizon, Turismo, Reliant and Reliant wagon; and
the Dodge Omni, Charger, Aries and Aries wagon. All have
2.2-liter engines.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Chrysler will replace part of the carburetor choke system.
The service will be free for car owners.</p>
<p>Hydrocarbons contribute to the formation of smog when
combined with sunlight and other pollutants. Excessive carbon
monoxide impairs heart function and is harmful to people with
lung disease and anemia.</p>
