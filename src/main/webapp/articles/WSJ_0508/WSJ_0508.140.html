	<p class="article-leader">Tokyo stocks surged as the steadier yen helped to boost
investor confidence and a healthy amount of buying pushed
prices higher, traders said.
   The Nikkei Index of 225 issues gained 782.63 points to
30956.27. The index advanced 483.81 points Wednesday. The
market was closed Thursday and Friday for holidays.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The London market was closed yesterday for a holiday.</p>
<p>In Tokyo Tuesday, the Nikkei index closed the morning
session at 30982.82, up 26.55 points.</p>
<p>Monday's volume on Tokyo's first section was estimated at
600 million shares, up from 482.4 million shares Wednesday.
Advancers widely outpaced decliners 867 to 122, with 112
issues unchanged.</p>
<p>The Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed in the
first section jumped 48.68 points, or 2.17%, to 2296.49.</p>
<p>The second section index surged 48.40 points, or 1.35%, to
close at 3628.36. Volume was estimated at nine million
shares, down from 9.5 million shares Wednesday.</p>
<p>Traders said that the stabler yen encouraged solid buying
yesterday, in particular by individual investors and Japanese
fund managers.</p>
<p>Moreover, investors were cheered by Sunday's Group of
Seven statement, which called for continued cooperation among
members on exchange rates.</p>
<p>Mahmoud Ghaemmaghami, manager of research and a portfolio
adviser at WestLB Securities Pacific Ltd., had predicted in
his daily market outlook last week that the market would see
a short rally yesterday, reasoning that the yen would
strengthen on the G-7 summit.</p>
<p>The G-7 meeting focused on determining directions for the
currencies, a topic that can be interpreted in different
ways, Mr. Ghaemmaghami said.</p>
<p>For example, Stephen Good, a representative in Japanese
equity sales at McIntosh Securities, said that investors may
re-evaluate their yen-denominated assets in light of the
weekend G-7 talks, reasoning that the U.S. won't likely
tighten monetary policy in the short term.</p>
<p>Mr. Ghaemmaghami said that this scenario is quite
possible. "If {global} interest rates remain at current
levels, we could see some outflow of money from the U.S. to
Japan," he added, "and because Japan {equity} has depreciated
sharply, one can expect a reasonable return."</p>
<p>Although he doesn't expect interest rates to rise for at
least one month, another Japanese official discount rate
increase can be expected if West Germany decides to raise its
official rate, Mr. Ghaemmaghami said.</p>
<p>Yesterday's market provided plenty of buying opportunities
for short-term investors, such as Japanese dealers and fund
managers, he said.</p>
<p>Much of the rally could be attributed to the fact that
many dealers were holding flat positions ahead of the
holidays, noted Yusuke Fujiwara, head of trading at Baring
Securities Ltd. In addition, he said that approximately two
trillion or three trillion yen ($12.65 billion to $18.98
billion) of pension money was making its way into the market.</p>
<p>Traders said short-term-oriented fund managers were
interested mostly in largecap, undervalued issues, such as
gas utilities, real estate and oil companies.</p>
<p>Mr. Ghaemmaghami said that undervalued issues with prices
of less than 1000 yen received the most attention.</p>
<p>"The market is strong, and the fact that small stocks are
coming back is quite healthy," Mr. Fujiwara said. But he also
noted that the market lacks a leading sector.</p>
<p>He said nonferrous metal stocks, for one, are viewed as a
good bet. But many sectors are undervalued, and while many
stocks within those sectors will rise, many will not, he
added.</p>
<p>Some companies linked to niche products are seen as
favorites for foreign investors who are looking for
longer-term securities, Mr. Ghaemmaghami said. But strong
earnings forecasts, low price-earnings ratios, low or no bank
borrowings, and high exports are among the things to check
for shorter-term investments, he said.</p>
<p>In particular, those stocks that lead the market in their
own products are usually the best bets, he added.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, electricals aren't seen as very profitable
because of steady gains throughout the volatility of recent
months, Mr. Fujiwara said.</p>
<p>Real estate companies were mostly higher yesterday. Mitsui
Real Estate gained 70 yen to 1830 yen, while Mitsubishi
Estate added 50 yen to 1660 yen. Sumitomo Realty jumped 40
yen to 1520 yen.</p>
<p>Railways also were higher. Tokyu gained 50 yen to 1650
yen, Keisei Electric added 80 yen to 1750 yen, and Odakyu
rose 60 yen to 1240 yen.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, prices closed higher in Sydney, Hong Kong,
Seoul, Manila, Wellington and Singapore, and were lower in
Taipei.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, stocks closed higher in Paris, Frankfurt,
Amsterdam, Stockholm, Milan; lower in Zurich; and mixed in
Brussels. South African gold stocks firmed.
