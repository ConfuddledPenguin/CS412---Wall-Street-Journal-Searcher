	<p class="article-leader">The over-the-counter market again rode the coattails of
technology stocks, but there were signs by the end of the
session that the rally might be fading.
   The Nasdaq Composite Index closed up 2.62 at 431.23, a
0.6% gain, with advancing shares leading declining stocks,
984 to 825. The Nasdaq 100 index of larger issues, including
some leading technology shares, surged 1.09% to 430.06, its
highest level since mid-April. Volume slipped to 122.6
million shares from 136.8 million.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Institutional interest continued to outpace buying among
small investors, said Ralph Costanza, manager of the OTC
department at Smith Barney, Harris & Upham. Mr. Costanza
suggested investors had expected disappointments, but not
positive news, among OTC and technology stocks and are now
catching up with the rally.</p>
<p>By midday, interest appeared to peak as such stocks as
Microsoft backed off their highs for the day, said Nicholas
Karos, senior OTC trader at Piper Jaffray & Hopwood,
Minneapolis. After hitting 66 in intraday trading, Microsoft
finished 2 1/4 higher at 64, a 52-week closing high. Mr.
Karos suggested profit-taking might continue today.</p>
<p>Technology companies continued to dominate the news, amid
both actual and anticipated announcements of improved
computer products.</p>
<p>Intel led the day's most-active list after NCR Corp.
unveiled a family of high-end personal computers based on
Intel's 486 chip. Merrill Lynch analyst Thomas Kurlak said in
an interview that the Santa Clara, Calif., semiconductor
maker's shares also remain in favor after company officials
told analysts last week that April orders are strong. Intel
rose 7/8 to 43 1/8 on 2.3 million shares.</p>
<p>Shearson Lehman Hutton software analyst David Readerman
attributed the continuing rally in the technology sector to
new software products expected from such companies as
Microsoft, and new hardware products expected in the second
half of the year. In an interview, Mr. Readerman also noted
that first-quarter earnings for technology companies outpaced
other industry groups, largely because of strong
international demand.</p>
<p>However, Mr. Readerman said that while the long-term
outlook for technology companies is looking better, he thinks
that some stocks, including as Microsoft, are fully valued in
the short term.</p>
<p>Reports that Microsoft will unveil its long-awaited
Windows 3.0 software later this month helped drive the
Redmond, Wash., computer company's shares higher. Mr.
Readerman called the stock fairly priced, noting that it's
trading at 22 times his estimated fiscal 1991 earnings for
Microsoft of $2.90 a share. In the long-term, however, he
says the stock is attractive.</p>
<p>Lotus gained 1/8 to 33 1/2 after the Cambridge, Mass.,
software maker said it will ship a new version of its 1-2-3
software program with improved graphics capability during the
third quarter. Noting that the stock traded as high as 33
1/2, Mr. Readerman attributed some of the strength to an
additional announcement by Lotus that at some point it will
ship a version that will be compatible with Microsoft's
upgraded Windows 3.0 program.</p>
<p>MCI Communications gained 3/8 to 38 1/4 after the long
distance carrier declared a new semi-annual dividend of five
cents a share. The company said it expects to maintain that
level for two to three years.</p>
<p>Centocor jumped 2 to 35 1/4. The Malvern, Pa.,
biotechnology company Saturday reported the results of
clinical trials of Centoxin, a drug used to treat septic
shock, before a medical meeting in Washington. Some analysts
told Dow Jones Professional Investor Report the results were
bullish for the stock, with Robertson Stephens analyst Mark
Simon saying he is maintaining a "buy" rating on Centocor.
Shares of Xoma, a Berkeley, Calif., company developing a
competing drug, rose 1/4 to 19 1/4.</p>
<p>Nordstrom rose 1 3/8 to 29 1/8 after a CBS "60 Minutes"
segment on the Seattle, Wash., clothing retailer wasn't as
negative as some investors had expected, traders said.</p>
<p>Washington Bancorp tumbled 5 1/2 to 3 1/2. The holding
company of National Bank of Washington, D.C., said it isn't
able to repay about $36.7 million of unsecured commercial
paper obligations because some unidentified but unrelated
banks cut off some lines of credit. The company said it will
discontinue its commercial paper program.</p>
<p>Mediagenic fell 1 3/8 to 3 after the Menlo Park, Calif.,
company said it will report a $19 million loss on revenue of
$65 million for the fiscal year ended March 31. The publisher
of entertainment software said it hired an investment banker
and may put itself up for sale.</p>
<p>Newbridge Networks lost 1 3/8 to close at 8 1/4 after the
Kanata, Ontario, maker of digital networking products said it
will not meet revenue and earnings expectations for the
fourth quarter ended April 30.</p>
<p>Shares of B&H Bulk Carriers dropped 5/8 to 4 3/8 after the
New York company reported a loss for the first quarter ended
March 31 of 16 cents a share, compared with net income of 67
cents a share a year earlier.</p>
