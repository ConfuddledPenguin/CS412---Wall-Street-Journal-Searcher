	<p class="article-leader">CALABASAS, Calif. -- Lockheed Corp. Chairman Daniel Tellep
reiterated that there is no way the company "will accept a
loss" on production of the P-7 anti-submarine aircraft,
adding that "there is no reason we can't make a profit" on
the program.
   Mr. Tellep's comments, made in an interview, may help to
mitigate fears on Wall Street that the U.S.'s sixth-largest
military contractor is in for another write-down once the
company finalizes pricing arrangements on the plane with the
Navy. Mr. Tellep said that "there is definitely progress
being made" on those negotiations, and they could be wrapped
up by July.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"I'm encouraged," said the chief executive, who has met
with Navy Secretary Lawrence Garrett on the matter. Mr.
Tellep added that "we're not asking for a bailout. No one is
letting us off the hook."</p>
<p>The P-7, designed to replace Lockheed's P-3 Orion, has
been a headache for the company since it was etched on the
drawing board. Managers badly miscalculated how much the new
plane would have in common with its predecessor, and Lockheed
was forced last year to take a $300 million charge because of
the cost overruns that will result from the development
error.</p>
<p>Mr. Tellep, who in March visited with securities analysts
during the company's proxy fight with Dallas investor Harold
Simmons, insisted then that Lockheed wouldn't record a
deficit on P-7 production, no matter what.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, many industry observers have questioned
lately whether Lockheed might take at least a small hit, or
possibly default on the whole deal, thereby dragging the
issue into court. "If the Navy held the company's feet to the
fire, there is no question that their price and Lockheed's
price could be very far apart," said Michael Rosen, aerospace
analyst at Smith Barney, Harris Upham & Co.</p>
<p>When it signed the development accord, Lockheed offered up
pricing and cost estimates for assembling the plane, but with
the redesign and a resulting two-year delay, there is no way
it can meet those targets. Some analysts have gone so far as
to say that the company risks losing billions of dollars over
the life of the pact.</p>
<p>But Mr. Tellep asserted: "There is no reason to have
write-offs. We're entitled to have an equitable adjustment"
from the government. Navy officials wouldn't comment, except
to say they are still talking with the company.</p>
<p>Mr. Tellep, calling the P-7 situation "a classic case of
total package procurement," effectively blasted the
government for forcing companies to lock into fixed prices
before the companies really have a handle on what a
complicated piece of hardware is going to cost to produce.
"It hasn't worked in the past, and it doesn't work now," he
said.</p>
<p>At this point, Mr. Tellep said, Lockheed and the Navy have
come up with a "technical configuration" for the P-7 that
"meets all the essential performance requirements" the
Pentagon has been looking for: the ability to fly 1,600
nautical miles from home base, linger over waters for as long
as four hours, and then fly home -- all on one tank of gas.</p>
<p>The chairman stressed that a cost schedule hasn't been
worked out, and the final numbers ultimately will depend on
the rate at which the planes are purchased. He suggested,
however, that there was little chance the whole project would
be scrapped. "The Navy is very much committed to maritime
patrol aircraft and the P-7 in particular," Mr. Tellep said.</p>
<p>He declined to give even a range of cost estimates for
building the plane.</p>
<p>One possible solution being considered, according to Mr.
Tellep, is for the Navy to cut the total number of planes it
will buy from the 123 P-7s originally envisioned. That would
drive up the expense of each plane, but the move could keep
steady the price tag of the entire program. Before the
development snafu, the Navy had valued the P-7 project, from
start to finish, at about $8 billion.</p>
<p>Still, despite the chairman's optimism, Mr. Rosen noted
that simply making up lost ground from the P-7 design will be
difficult. With a $300 million write-down already on the
books, he said, "they're pretty far in the hole."</p>
