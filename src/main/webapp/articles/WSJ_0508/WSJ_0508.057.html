	<p class="article-leader">Hardly a week passes now that some magazine doesn't
publish a cover article on the low estate to which
Washington, especially Congress, has fallen. We've argued for
some time that the so-called budget reform act back in 1974
was the catalyst for this decline. It upset the balance of
power between Congress and the White House and, with the
committee reforms of the time, unbalanced Congress's own
internal discipline as well.
   Against this backdrop, another budget summit is under way
between the Bush White House and Congressional leadership.
While our natural instinct is to look for a sellout of the
no-new-taxes pledge, we have to admit to seeing a silver
lining in these negotiations. There is a sense that the
participants are prepared to bring a level of seriousness to
the table not evident in the past. If that seriousness
persists, Washington may restore some of the credibility it
lacks today with both the public and the financial markets.
Still, how is the public to know if this one's for real?</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>We think the public will know the budget summit's for real
if it includes several benchmarks. Some consensus seems to
have been reached by both sides to put taxes on the table.
Whatever the price in tax increases, this current round can
be taken seriously only if it includes real spending cuts, if
it emphasizes fixing the process itself rather than just the
deficit numbers, and in particular if it takes concrete steps
to restore discipline to the process.</p>
<p>For all the Beltway's longtime panting after some sort of
tax increase, it seems to us that taxes are a greatly
underappreciated time bomb in U.S. politics, ticking beneath
an electorate grown impatient with a voracious, arrogant and
inefficient public sector. Understanding well enough the
political risks of raising taxes in this climate, we would
still entertain a tax increase as an acceptable price for
giving the President line-item veto authority over
appropriations.</p>
<p>There is increasing evidence that the Washington
establishment appreciates the need for putting the item
veto's discipline into the process. The Senate Judiciary
Committee voted 8 to 6 recently to send two versions of
item-veto amendments to the Senate floor. One had the support
of Democrats Paul Simon of Illinois and Howell Heflin of
Alabama, who must go before the voters this fall. "It keeps
our hopes alive of bringing some sanity into the budget
process," Senator Simon said. Ironically, OMB chief Richard
Darman is known to be cool to the idea. Still, President Bush
reiterated during remarks in the Rose Garden recently his
interest in acquiring the ability to control spending, either
with the item veto or the ability to rescind some of the
money in an appropriation.</p>
<p>There are reasons why the White House and Capitol Hill
should be converging on this issue now.</p>
<p>The legislative system is in gridlock. There is barely
discussion or debate now about the merits of most new bills
or even ideas because of the horrifying prospect of sending
anything through the budget process. Subjects such as the
country's infrastructure, AIDS funding, the federal science
budget, defense, health-care costs all deserve at least to be
debated extensively, but that rarely happens anymore.</p>
<p>Committed liberals threw the results of their own Pepper
Commission on long-term health care into the wastebasket,
realizing that just raising the subject was a waste of time.
Conservatives lose heart over SDI as the House Armed Services
Committee mindlessly guts it and other defense programs.</p>
<p>We're obviously not complaining about a lack of new
spending. Our concern is with a political system that has
made the pork-barrel and special-interest politics its
guiding principle rather than merely a tolerable byproduct.
It has become a system that can't be trusted to spend
rationally because it lacks any institutional discipline over
its worst political instincts. The President, representing
half the legislative process and the national electorate, is
just an adjunct to Congress's budget bartering. But as
Senator Simon said the other day, "The reality is that we
have demonstrated year after year after year that Congress
simply doesn't have the discipline" to operate alone. The
budget process is beyond ideology or partisanship; it is
anarchy.</p>
<p>So we now have another budget summit, and the air has been
filled the past few days with talk about how everything is up
for negotiation. Fine. But if all this bipartisan support for
putting everything on the table, especially taxes, is only
intended to get another 98.5% House sent back to Washington
in the fall, it's a sham and should be exposed as such. But
if, as we suspect, the White House and congressional
leadership have come to understand that a new institutional
framework, including the item veto, is needed to control and
discipline federal spending, then all issues belong on the
table.</p>
