	<p class="article-leader">Wouldn't you know it? For once Congress passes a bill that
actually accomplishes a lofty goal -- saving thousands of
lives -- and some Member has to go and decide the program
works too well. The Orphan Drug Act has encouraged the
development of dozens of life-saving drugs since 1983, but
Rep. Henry Waxman wants to risk the program apparently
because he has diagnosed a troublesome side effect --
profits.
   The California Democrat proposes changes that would repeal
the law's only reason for being, to encourage development of
drugs for rare diseases. The law works by doing what the
government does too rarely. It establishes a clear private
property right that benefits everyone.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The law gives pharmaceutical firms a seven-year exclusive
right to sell these highly specialized drugs. "If someone had
told me when the law passed that I would now be in Henry
Waxman's office because the orphan drugs had become too
profitable, I'd have thought they were crazy," says Abbey
Meyers, who runs a patients group called National
Organization for Rare Disorders. Her group is delighted with
the law as it is. It's been a boon to the more than 10
million Americans who suffer from among 5,000 rare diseases,
some with as few as a dozen victims.</p>
<p>Rep. Waxman's new rules would cancel the seven-year
exclusivity in midstream because he says some new orphan
drugs have turned out to be "highly profitable." But trying
to develop a new drug is a lot like digging for oil -- you
dig a lot of dry holes before a shot at a geyser. Though most
of the more than 40 orphan drugs now on the market yield
modest sales, a drug for treating anemia in patients with
kidney failure is expected to have annual sales of $200
million, a hormone to treat dwarfism in children will bring
sales of some $150 million and a drug to prevent the
pneumonia associated with AIDS has more patients than anyone
expected.</p>
<p>Under the Waxman amendments, a firm would lose its
protection if another firm could show that it developed the
drug "simultaneously." This is defined to mean six months
after the first firm designates an orphan drug. A firm would
also lose its exclusive right if it later turned out that
there were more than 200,000 patients who could use the drug.</p>
<p>This would create great uncertainty about who owns the
rights to sell drugs. It would be impossible to predict the
minimum payout from R&D for an orphan drug. We would be back
to the problem of how to encourage the development of orphan
drugs. Some 300 new orphan drugs already in the works would
be at risk. It's also worth noting that the orphan-drug law
gave small pharmaceutical companies a rare incentive to
compete with the big firms.</p>
<p>Rep. Waxman would also open up the federal government to
huge lawsuits by companies that relied on the 1983 law. Their
expected returns from orphan drugs in development or
production would be stolen, an obvious violation of the
Constitution's Takings Clause. Genentech is already
threatening a lawsuit demanding compensation for
expropriation.</p>
<p>Rep. Waxman, who supported the original orphan-drug bill,
has forgotten that drug profits are also good for patients;
each sale represents a treatment. Patients with these rare
diseases naturally prefer a drug with profit to its maker to
no drug at all. Rep. Waxman should pat himself on the back
for the successes of the orphan-drug bill and leave well
enough alone.</p>
