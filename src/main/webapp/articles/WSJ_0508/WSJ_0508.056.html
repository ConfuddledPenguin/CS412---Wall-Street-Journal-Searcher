	<p class="article-leader">SEOUL, South Korea -- President Roh Tae Woo attempted to
buck up flagging Korean confidence by declaring, in a major
turnabout, that Korea's economy isn't in a crisis.
   Mr. Roh and his leading economic advisers for the past
year had been saying a crisis was at hand, even though the
country was expected to record gross national product growth
of about 7% in 1990. Many economists said the crisis talk was
a clear attempt by the government to scare unions into
moderating their demands, but it had the unwanted effect of
weakening the morale of businesses and investors.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Mr. Roh said as much in a televised address Monday. "It is
wrong to think we have an economic crisis on hand," he said.
"The real problem is that a pervasive sense of anxiety is
making the situation more troublesome than it actually is."</p>
<p>The president admitted the country's politicians and
technocrats have made mistakes, but he said he was getting
tough on big business, which dominates the economy. He said
such firms "will be induced -- if necessary, forced -- to
dispose of their nonproductive or excessive real-estate
holdings."</p>
<p>The president's attempt to turn around business and
investor psychology came after a weekend that saw labor
strikes that rocked the nation a week ago dissipate.</p>
<p>The government forcibly ended the strike at the
government-owned Korea Broadcasting System and most of the
Hyundai Group factories are operating again after tens of
thousands struck last week. But about 60 scofflaw unionists
at Hyundai Heavy Industries are camped out atop the
shipyard's 270-foot tall crane, out of the reach of police.
The union members started talks with the company Sunday.</p>
<p>The stock market, after plunging early last week, is
surging. After a four-session rally it closed at 791.56, up
9.23 points Monday, and up 102.93, or 14.9%, since the April
30 tumble.</p>
<p>But there are still signals that all isn't well. Strikes
over wages are still likely as inflation forecasts multiply.
The most optimistic government reports say consumer prices
will rise about 7%, while other economists say the consumer
price index will hit double-digits in 1990.</p>
<p>"This won't lead to a nationwide uprising. The government
is too strong," said Phee Jung-Sun, a labor consultant with
close ties to leading militant unions. But there is other bad
news: Corporate earnings will be down and export growth, an
all-important part of the export-driven economy, is still
weak because Korean products have lost competitiveness,
particularly against Japanese exports.</p>
<p>The stock market's surge may have lost steam. Although it
rose more than 24 points after Mr. Roh's speech, during the
last two hours of the afternoon session it started falling.
Some analysts, such as Thae S. Kwharg, senior analyst with
Baring Brothers & Co. in Seoul, say the market will fall
further this week.</p>
<p>Korean market analysts say only psychology is driving the
market and when people realize the government isn't proposing
anything new and can't really get tough the market will fall
again.</p>
