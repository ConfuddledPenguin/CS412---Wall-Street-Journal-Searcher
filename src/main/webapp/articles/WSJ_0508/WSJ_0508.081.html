	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- In a sign of the continuing profit pressures
on government bond dealers, the head of Citicorp's government
bond operation and the chief trader resigned.
   In an internal memo, Citicorp last week said that David A.
Jones, who headed the bond operation, and Lawrence Isabel,
the chief trader, had resigned to pursue other interests.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The resignations came as Citicorp divided the unit and
reassigned responsibilities. The U.S. government securities
portion of the bond unit was combined with foreign exchange
and hedging instruments under David Young, division executive
for exposure management. Henry Mlynarski was named head of
trading and sales of U.S. government securities. Municipal
securities and certain other instruments were placed under
Robert Laughlin, formerly division executive for equipment
finance and leasing.</p>
<p>Michael A. Callen, Citicorp vice chairman, said in an
interview that government bonds "continue to be a real tough
business." He spoke highly of Messrs. Jones and Isabel,
calling them "first-rate."</p>
<p>Neither Messrs. Jones nor Isabel could be reached for
comment.</p>
<p>In recent months, Citicorp, like other primary dealers,
has scaled back its bond trading in the face of slim margins
and continued high costs.</p>
