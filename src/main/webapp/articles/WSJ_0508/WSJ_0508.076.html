	<p class="article-leader">DRUG TESTING programs escalate at the Transportation
Department.
   Leaping legal hurdles, most of the department's
requirements for testing four million truck and bus drivers,
train crews, mass-transit employees, airline pilots and
mechanics, pipeline workers, licensed seamen and others took
effect in recent months. But court action stalls all transit
and some truck-and-bus and Coast Guard testing rules. Some 8%
to 30% of truck-driver job seekers test positive, firms say.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Despite union lawsuits, Terrance Gainer, the department's
drug-program chief, says he is "absolutely amazed" at
labor-management acceptance. So far, 35,000 tests were also
done on air-traffic controllers and other department people
since late 1987. There were 161 positives; 34 were fired, the
rest were reassigned or returned to duty after
rehabilitation.</p>
<p>Many transit agencies and others move ahead with testing
on their own, untouched by court orders.</p>
<p>CREATIVE INTERVIEWING takes firmer hold, as the job pinch
worsens.</p>
<p>Bolt, Beranek & Newman, to avoid costly "bad hires" and
emphasize the applicant's future, strives harder to divine
the "real candidate." Hercules begins training managers how
to better assess job seekers' performance prospects. Hershey
Food makes "behavioral interviewing" a crucial part of
management training, so managers can judge "between a fast
horse and a champion" who'll fit Hershey's "culture."</p>
<p>Negligent-hiring and reference-checking problems also spur
new techniques. Bradley Real Estate Trust uses the behavioral
method now, asking applicants what they'd do to resolve a
real-life work problem. Scott Paper also relies more on
"situational" queries that probe the job-seeker's skills,
judgment and teamwork.</p>
<p>College grads, with numerous interviews and offers under
their belts, are prepared for interviews, says Hercules.</p>
<p>ILLEGAL ALIENS use phony documents to beat immigration
curbs.</p>
<p>Though the General Accounting Office says employer
sanctions have cut illegal immigration, they aren't enforced
much for farm workers, insists Philip Martin, an agriculture
expert at the University of California at Davis. False birth,
Social Security and driver's documents proliferate. "We may
have to look at other means to make . . . sanctions work," an
Immigration and Naturalization Service spokesman says.</p>
<p>Employers and unions figure 35% of three million field
workers in major farm states are undocumented, as in the
early 1980s. The INS says arrests along the Mexican border
rose by over 100,000, to 472,121, in the six months through
March, which just means more people are trying -- and
succeeding -- in coming across.</p>
<p>Texas growers try to check documents. But "when you need
help, you need help," says Joyce Brejcha, whose family grows
corn and peanuts.</p>
<p>SCHOOL CUSTODIANS have a high incidence of
asbestos-related lung disease, a study by the Mount Sinai
Medical Center shows. Fully 28% of 660 New York school
janitors examined had scarred lungs; the general-population
rate is under 1%. Of those with 40 years' work history, 61%
showed serious lung scarring.</p>
<p>APPLEWORKS SOFTWARE draws boos from the Coalition of Labor
Union Women for its word-processing synonyms for "woman,"
such as "female partner . . . wife . . . Mrs.," while those
for "man" include "member of the human race, human, . . .
creature, individual, life, mortal, . . . person, soul, . . .
humankind, mortality."</p>
<p>HEALTH MAINTENANCE organization enrollment grew by 2.1
million members, or 6.3%, in 1989, to 34.7 million, the Group
Health Association of America said. By the end of 1989, 14%
of all Americans were enrolled in an HMO, switching from
traditional indemnity insurance plans.</p>
<p>A 1987 DISSERTATION by a Yale doctoral candidate, finding
little significant risk of lung cancer from passive smoking,
is being sent to 500 scientists by Philip Morris. The tobacco
company hopes to defuse an EPA report expected soon, that the
firm fears will urge a ban on smoking at work.

<p>SENSITIVITY TRAINING alerts employees to customer needs.</p>
<p>Staples Inc., an office-supply chain, sent workers from
its New York stores to a two-day motel retreat last month; a
"mystery shopper" reported on their customer-service gaffes.
Employees also played shopper roles, talking about problems
like trying to return an item without a receipt. British
Airways employees see how passengers react, in mock fires and
other mock crises.</p>
<p>Ritz-Carlton Hotel workers are taught to be more formal
with Japanese and European guests, and to reply to all, "It's
my pleasure," instead of "You're welcome." Parfums Stern
staffers act out customer-salesperson roles, to fathom
customer emotions. Wendy's International videotapes disabled
customers; in one video, a blind person asks that change be
counted out loud.</p>
<p>Meridian Bancorp. has workers walk with seeds in their
shoes to simulate older customers' corns and callouses.</p>
<p>THE CHECKOFF: A Swedish gas station develops a robot pump
that fills the tank while the driver sits in the car. . . .
It costs about $110,000 to relocate a senior executive, but
only $35,000 for lower-level managers, a survey by consultant
Goodrich & Sherwood shows. . . . Wake up that other guy: In a
poll of 1,000 British Columbia truck drivers, 99.9% said
alertness is vital in their work.</p>
