	<p class="article-leader">Stock prices posted a sixth consecutive gain, but demand
for government bonds eased in the wake of last Friday's big
rally.
   The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 11.26 to 2721.62 in
light trading. Long-term Treasury bonds gave up modest
amounts of their big Friday gains, and the dollar eased
against most major currencies.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Analysts said stock prices were buoyed by the perception
that interest rates peaked last week with yields of slightly
more than 9% on long-term Treasury bonds. With the economy
growing modestly and expectations that interest rates will
decline, albeit slowly, in coming weeks, investors have been
buying stocks gingerly.</p>
<p>Technology issues have performed especially well in recent
days, another sign of confidence among investors that the
economy is on a steady course. Motorola yesterday climbed 1
7/8 to a new 52-week high of 72 1/2.</p>
<p>While stock market investors were enjoying the possibility
of declining interest rates, bond investors will find little
to enjoy until this week's record $30.5 billion quarterly
auction of new Treasury debt is behind them. The auction
begins today.</p>
<p>The prospect of such a huge supply of new debt coming to
the market took a toll on bond prices yesterday after an
ebullient rally Friday that carried the Treasury's benchmark
30-year bond up more than 1 1/2 points, or more than $15 for
each $1,000 of face amount.</p>
<p>The rally Friday had its roots in the government's April
employment report, which showed a gain of only 64,000 jobs in
the nonfarm sector instead of the 400,000 or so that many
economists had estimated. The report suggested that the
economy isn't nearly as robust as many had thought and thus
not as likely to produce rising inflation.</p>
<p>Although some traders said bond prices may decline further
during the auction, they're hoping that the market will get
another boost this Friday when the government reports its
producer price index for April. Although the index, a measure
of inflation at the wholesale level, is expected to be up
0.2%, that small increase comes on the heels of a 0.2% drop
in March and a flat February. Many analysts think the
producer price index is a better measure of future inflation
trends than the consumer price index, which rose 0.5% in
March.</p>
<p>In major market action:</p>
<p>Stock prices rose in thin trading. Volume on the New York
Stock Exchange totaled 132.8 million shares. Advancing issues
on the Big Board were ahead of losers 943 to 571.</p>
<p>Bond prices dipped modestly. The Treasury's benchmark
30-year issue ended less than 1/4 point lower, or $2.50 for
each $1,000 of face amount. The yield on the issue rose to
8.84%.</p>
<p>The dollar fell. In late New York trading the currency was
quoted at 1.6558 marks and 158.19 yen compared to 1.6662
marks and 158.25 yen Friday.</p>
