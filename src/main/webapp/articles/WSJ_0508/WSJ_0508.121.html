	<p class="article-leader">RWE AG said its group profit rose in the first nine months
of fiscal 1990 on a 6.2% rise in sales.
   The West German energy concern said group sales in the
period ended March 31 rose to around 31 billion marks ($18.61
billion) from 29 billion marks a year ago.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Speaking at the company's annual shareholding meeting,
Chairman Friedhelm Gieske didn't give any profit figures. But
citing the group's earnings-oriented dividend policy, he
indicated a possible increase in the fiscal 1990 dividend
from nine marks a share. RWE will also increase its special
reserve fund for the first time since 1984, Mr. Gieske said.</p>
<p>Full-year sales are expected to climb 13% to 43.8 billion
marks from 38.9 billion marks in fiscal 1989, partly
reflecting the partial consolidation of construction group
Hochtief AG, in which RWE boosted its stake to 56% from 46%
this year by buying a 10% interest from Commerzbank AG.</p>
