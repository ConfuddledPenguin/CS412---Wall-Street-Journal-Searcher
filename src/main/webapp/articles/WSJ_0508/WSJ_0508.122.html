	<p class="article-leader">Spain's Banco Central has finally ended its long-running
conflict with its principal shareholder, Cartera Central,
with an agreement to buy Cartera's 12.5% holding of its
shares and sell them to other buyers.
   A Cartera spokesman said the agreement values Cartera's
holding at 59.2 billion pesetas ($567.3 million). Banco
Central is to pay 29.2 billion pesetas immediately and the
balance, plus annual interest of 15%, before May 31, 1991.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Banco Central said it has been in discussions with a
number of institutions with a view to placing the shares,
either for these institutions to hold them in their own
portfolio or for their flotation on international markets.</p>
<p>Banco Central gave no further details, but sources close
to the bank said that they understood that agreements for the
transfer of the shares had already been reached. Though the
agreement is subject to the approval of the Bank of Spain and
the stock exchange commission, Banco Central doesn't expect
this to pose any problem, the sources said.</p>
