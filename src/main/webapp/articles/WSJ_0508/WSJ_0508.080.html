	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- A federal grand jury indicted a former senior
managing director and former head of Bear Stearns Cos.'s
stock-loan department for allegedly obstructing the
investigation of a money-laundering case.
   The indictment, handed up late last week against the
former Bear Stearns executive, Joseph J. Stella, appears not
to be directly related to the wide-ranging federal
investigation of stock-loan abuses on Wall Street that
surfaced in September. Bear Stearns wasn't involved in the
alleged wrongdoing in the money-laundering case.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Stock-loan branches of big securities firms for a fee lend
blocks of securities to investors and institutions, as well
as match lenders and borrowers of stock. About $25 billion of
stock was lent last year, according to industry executives.</p>
<p>As a senior executive who headed Bear Stearns's stock-loan
department for the past 15 years, Mr. Stella would be well
versed in Wall Street's secretive and lucrative stock-loan
business, attorneys said. A broad investigation being
conducted by the Manhattan U.S. attorney's office centers on
the former head of Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc.'s stock-loan
operations, Dennis T. Palmeri, who is believed to be
cooperating with federal investigators, people in the
securities industry said. Shearson is a unit of American
Express Co.</p>
<p>In last week's indictment, the Manhattan federal grand
jury charged that in 1980 and 1981 Mr. Stella and several
others "laundered" more than $1.7 million in checks that
allegedly reflected the proceeds of securities embezzled from
Bankers Trust Co. and fees from stock-loan transactions that
others sought to shield from income taxes. Bankers Trust is a
unit of Bankers Trust New York Corp.</p>
<p>The indictment charged that Mr. Stella and several others
-- including his brother, Fred Stella -- conspired to conceal
from prosecutors and the grand jury their involvement in the
check laundering and income-tax evasion during an
investigation of the Bankers Trust case that began in 1983.</p>
<p>Although the indictment alleges that the defendants
laundered the cash, they were only charged with counts
relating to obstructing the investigation.</p>
<p>Joseph Stella, who resigned from Bear Stearns last month,
couldn't be reached for comment; his attorney didn't return
phone calls.</p>
<p>In a statement, Bear Stearns said it accepted Mr. Stella's
resignation on April 26 "for alleged personal activities
totally unrelated to Bear Stearns." Bear Stearns said that
was the day Mr. Stella told the firm of his possible
indictment. On the same day, Bear Stearns named Pasquale
CeStaro III as the managing director in charge of its
stock-loan area.</p>
<p>In addition to Joseph and Fred Stella, the indictment
named Roger C. Capozzi Sr. and Joseph A. Pontarelli, who
allegedly cashed checks for Fred Stella through a Brooklyn
clothing-embroidery business and a Manhattan liquor store and
check-cashing business, respectively, the indictment says.
Fred Stella and Messrs. Capozzi and Pontarelli couldn't be
reached for comment.</p>
<p>The indictment alleges, among other things, that Mr.
Capozzi and Joseph and Fred Stella falsely told investigators
that fictitious or deceased people were responsible for
crucial aspects of the money-laundering activities.</p>
<p>Mr. Capozzi and Joseph and Fred Stella were each charged
with one count of conspiracy to obstruct justice; Mr. Capozzi
also was charged with three counts of perjury and three
counts of obstructing justice. Fred Stella was also charged
with five counts of obstructing justice. Mr. Pontarelli was
charged with filing a false income-tax return and with
income-tax evasion.</p>
<p>If convicted, Joseph Stella, 46 years old, faces a maximum
of five years in prison and a $250,000 fine; Fred Stella, a
50-year-old New York lawyer, faces a maximum of 30 years in
prison and fines of $1.5 million.</p>
<p>Mr. Capozzi, 68, faces a maximum of 35 years in prison and
fines of $1.75 million. Mr. Pontarelli, 47, faces a maximum
of eight years in prison and fines of $500,000.</p>
<p>The four are scheduled to be arraigned today before U.S.
District Judge Charles S. Haight.</p>
