	<p class="article-leader">PINE BROOK, N.J. -- Cistron Biotechnology Inc. emerged
from Chapter 11 proceedings after nearly two years under the
protection of the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Newark.
   The biotech company reached an agreement to discharge
nearly $1.4 million of liabilities.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Under terms, the company will issue $870,238 of notes plus
nearly 1.1 million of its shares to satisfy claims of its
attorneys and of New England Medical Center Hospitals Inc.
The company and New England Medical have an accord to
research Interleukin-1, a natural protein being developed as
a drug for treating arthritis and other problems.</p>
<p>Cistron Chairman Henry Grausz guaranteed the notes; in
return, he will receive nearly two million Cistron shares.</p>
<p>The company also will issue options to buy 640,000 Cistron
shares to satisfy claims of present and former directors and
employees. Other creditors will get 100 cents on the dollar.</p>
<p>The company had 21.3 million shares outstanding at
year-end 1989. In the second quarter ended Dec. 31, the
company earned $34,400 compared to a year-earlier loss of
$14,300. Sales rose 23%, to $271,000, from $220,000.</p>
<p>The company's shares have been trading on the pink sheets.
It will apply to have the shares listed over the counter, a
spokesman said.</p>
