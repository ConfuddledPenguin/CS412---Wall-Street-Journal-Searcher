	<p class="article-leader">A Maryland state appeals court struck down two key
provisions that so far have limited the exposure of insurance
companies for the negligence of officers and directors of
failed savings and loan associations.
   The decision is the first state appellate ruling in the
nation to address whether the provisions -- known as
"exclusions" in insurance parlance -- should exempt insurance
companies from paying claims against directors and officers
of failed thrifts. Though the case has no binding effect
outside Maryland, it is expected to be widely cited as more
lawsuits are filed nationwide against directors and officers
of failed S&Ls.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Almost all liability policies for directors and officers
of thrifts contain the exclusions struck down in Maryland.
One, known as the "regulatory exclusion," bars coverage when
federal regulators take action. The other known, as the
"insured vs. insured exclusion" exempts insurance companies
from liability when institutions sue their own officers.</p>
<p>The exclusions have been pivotal in limiting the exposure
of insurance companies for the negligent conduct of officers
responsible for the collapse of thrifts nationwide. But both
were nullified last week by the court of special appeals of
Maryland, in Baltimore. The intermediate state appellate
court ruled that the exclusions are contrary to Maryland
"public policy."</p>
<p>The state has been bailing out collapsed thrifts since
1985, when it created the Maryland Deposit Insurance Fund to
represent creditors and depositors. Allowing the exclusions
to stand, thus barring a payout by insurers, the court ruled,
would circumvent the state's greater interest in recovering
"every dollar available."</p>
<p>The court ruled that: "The law in Maryland is well settled
that considerations of public policy are deemed paramount to
private rights. . . . Thus, where the two conflict, private
interest must yield to the public good."</p>
<p>"From a national perspective, the vitiating of these two
exclusions has tremendous ramifications," said Neil Dilloff,
a partner at the Baltimore law firm of Piper & Marbury, which
won the opinion on behalf of the Maryland fund.</p>
<p>The case was filed against American Casualty Co. of
Reading, Pa., an underwriter for CNA Insurance Cos., in
Chicago. American's attorneys in Washington weren't available
for comment, but the case is expected to be appealed to
Maryland's highest court, said Mr. Dilloff.</p>
<p>Michael Lovendusky, counsel and litigation manager for the
American Insurance Association, in Washington, said that if
the ruling is picked up in other states or by federal courts,
it could become impossible for insurance companies to issue
director and officer liability policies. The two exclusions,
said Mr. Lovendusky, have been standard since the 1960s.</p>

<p>RACIAL ISSUE in major smoking-liability case forces a
change of venue.</p>
<p>The case of Horton vs. American Tobacco Co. originally
went to trial in January 1988 in Lexington, Miss. The family
of Nathan H. Horton, a housing contractor who died of lung
cancer in 1987, charged the company with "marketing a
defective and unreasonably dangerous product."</p>
<p>American Tobacco, a unit of American Brands Inc., denied
any responsibility for Mr. Horton's death. But anti-smoking
forces had high hopes for the Horton case. Mississippi state
law is more favorable to plaintiffs than in most other
states. Under its so-called comparative-negligence law, the
jury could have awarded damages to the Horton family even if
it had found the tobacco company bore only 1% of the
responsibility for Mr. Horton's death.</p>
<p>But the first trial ended in a hung jury amid charges of
jury tampering.</p>
<p>A second trial began last month but was abruptly halted by
Circuit Court Judge Eugene Bogen in response to complaints
made by American Tobacco. In early April, newspapers,
broadcasters and local civic and political leaders had
received a packet of information from the plaintiffs'
attorneys that included statements that tobacco companies
were targeting blacks and other minorities.</p>
<p>Judge Bogen, in approving a motion by American Tobacco for
a delay in the case and a change of venue, said the
statements were a "blatant attempt to make an appeal on the
basis of race to the persons in Holmes County, and thus
indirectly on the jury pool."</p>
<p>After declaring a mistrial and placing a gag order on
lawyers for both sides, Judge Bogen moved the case to the
Lafayette County Circuit Court from Holmes County and set a
Sept. 4 trial date.</p>

<p>BANKS' LAWSUIT against government of Peru gets court
hearing.</p>
<p>The group of banks is seeking immediate repayment of $1.2
billion in loans made during the past two decades. The banks
include Citibank, a unit of Citicorp; Bank of Tokyo; Bank of
America, a unit of BankAmerica Corp.; and Chase Manhattan
Bank, a unit of Chase Manhattan Corp. The banks allege that
Peru has been in default on its foreign debt since 1984.</p>
<p>The suit is believed to be the largest ever filed against
a sovereign government, said Mark A. Cymrot of Cole Corette &
Abrutyn, a lawyer for Peru and Peruvian financial
institutions that are also defendants in the case. Ten other
suits have also been filed against Peru seeking the repayment
of loans.</p>
<p>An attorney for the banks told federal Judge John Keenan
of New York that his clients would prefer to renegotiate the
loans but were concerned about deadlines that would have
barred legal action.</p>
<p>The banks filed suit March 2 after learning that an
agreement reached with Peru's government, which would have
effectively extended the deadline, might not be enforceable
under Peruvian law, Henry Weisburg of Shearman & Sterling, an
attorney for several banks, told the court. A spokeswoman for
Citibank, which heads the 10-member Bank Advisory Committee
for Peru, said later that serious negotiations with Peru
haven't taken place for several years.</p>
<p>Peru has had difficult relations with its foreign
creditors since 1985, when it restricted payments on its
foreign debt to 10% of its export revenue. In December, Peru
paid the International Monetary Fund $42.3 million in overdue
interest payments. In return, the IMF agreed to send a team
to Peru to develop an economic program with the government.</p>
<p>Mr. Cymrot said the banks's suit ignores the IMF agreement
and that enforcement of a favorable judgment could cut off
Peru's foreign income and strangle the country economically.
"This could undermine democracy in Peru," he said.</p>
<p>At the hearing, Judge Keenan gave the defendants 60 days
to respond to the banks' allegations.</p>

<p>RETRIAL BEGINS:  The retrial of Raymond Buckey, the former
California preschool teacher accused of child molestation,
began following a month of jury selection. Mr. Buckey, whose
first criminal trial was the longest and costliest in U.S.
history, will be tried on eight counts of child molestation
involving three girls who were once pupils at the now-defunct
Virginia McMartin Preschool in the community of Manhattan
Beach. Earlier this year, after 28 months of hearing
testimony and three months of deliberations, a jury acquitted
Mr. Buckey and his mother, Peggy McMartin Buckey, on 52 of 65
counts. The government later decided to retry Mr. Buckey
alone on eight of the 13 counts on which the jury had
deadlocked. The new trial is expected to take at least six
months.</p>

<p>PRIVATE LESSONS: Baker & McKenzie, a 1,400 lawyer firm
based in Chicago, was picked as a legal adviser to Hungary in
that nation's efforts to sell its state-owned enterprises.
The law firm, which has a two-year-old office in Budapest,
will join investment bank Barclays de Zoete Wedd Limited, a
unit of Barclays Bank PLC, London, and accounting firm Price
Waterhouse of New York as part of a consortium of
international advisers on the public offering. The consortium
will recommend policies and procedures for the Hungarian
State Property Agency, which was established this year to
oversee the sale of an estimated $32 billion in state
property.</p>
