	<p class="article-leader">As Southern California has grown rapidly over the past
decade, so has the so-called "slow-growth" movement. A decade
ago, virtually no one in the Southern California megalopolis
lived under growth restrictions. Now most people in the
region accept them as a way of life.
   Although the slow-growth movement can win elections, it
does not seem able actually to slow growth. The best evidence
from Southern California is that even within a single
geographic region, anti-development activism shuffles growth
from one place to another not far away. When new houses are
restricted in one area of metropolitan Los Angeles, they
simply pop up somewhere else nearby, usually on inexpensive
virgin land, a little more distant from the urban core. Then,
the political pressure to stop development grows in these
newer communities. So the developers move out a little
farther again.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Nowhere has this occured more dramatically than in the
areas ringing the San Fernando Valley, northwest of downtown
Los Angeles. Once the ultimate suburb, the San Fernando
Valley, like many postwar suburbs, has emerged as a
commercial employment center. It is now spawning suburbs of
its own, farther and farther away -- in the Conejo, Santa
Clarita and Antelope valleys.</p>
<p>One of them is Thousand Oaks, located in the Conejo valley
just a few miles to the west. It looks like a suburbanite's
dream; low and broad, with no tall buildings and a
stateliness rare for an auto-oriented community. Even the
parking lots are handsome. Median household income exceeds
$60,000. A third of the city's 52 square miles are set aside
for parks and open space.</p>
<p>For a decade, Thousand Oaks has tried to maintain its
suburban tranquility by restricting residential construction
to 500 units per year. (Subsidized housing is exempt.) When
city officials talk about their growth-control ordinance,
though, they rarely speak about the actual benefits of having
fewer houses constructed. Rather, they talk about the
leverage it gives the city in the planning process. Each
development proposal is rated according to aesthetics and
impact on public services. The projects with the highest
rating receive some of the city's 500 housing "allocations"
each year.</p>
<p>The growth-control ordinance has enabled Thousand Oaks to
obtain parks and trails, save precious oak trees and acquire
other community benefits. But the point system encourages
developers to build larger and more expensive homes in order
to pay for all the amenities. Median home price in Thousand
Oaks is now $325,000.</p>
<p>The growth-control law kept Thousand Oaks affluent and
attractive throughout the 1980s. No one can argue seriously,
however, that it has changed the basic growth dynamics in the
Conejo Valley. Despite high land prices, home buyers and
businesses continue to stream west out of the San Fernando in
huge numbers. The Southern California Association of
Governments predicts that over the next 20 years, the Conejo
Valley will witness a doubling of both population and jobs.</p>
<p>Twenty-five miles northeast of Thousand Oaks, across the
San Gabriel Mountains from the San Fernando Valley and the
Los Angeles border, lie several communities that banded
together two years ago to become the city of Santa Clarita.
Virtually unknown a decade ago, Santa Clarita has more than
150,000 residents today and could have as many as 270,000 by
the year 2010. The area has been invaded by middle-class home
buyers fleeing the increasingly expensive and crowded San
Fernando Valley to the south. An estimated 40% of its
residents commute south along the Golden State Freeway into
the Valley each day. Despite a boom in home building, Santa
Clarita home prices are skyrocketing -- from an average of
$160,000 when the city was incorporated two years ago to
$230,000 today.</p>
<p>Local streets are choked with traffic much of the time.
Many areas suffer from water runoff problems, inadequate
sewer systems and a lack of parks. Voters here approved
incorporation two years ago in hopes of gaining more control
over growth in the Santa Clarita Valley. But many of the
political tools they need to limit growth still belong to the
Los Angeles County government, 35 miles south in downtown
L.A.</p>
<p>The county board of supervisors is controlled by
free-enterprise advocates who prefer not to intervene in
private development. Before cityhood arrived in 1987, the
county controlled all development in the valley; even today,
most land in the valley remains under the county's rule.</p>
<p>Unable to persuade the developers or the L.A. County
government to pay for the cost of rapid growth, the residents
of Santa Clarita have made it clear they do not plan to tax
themselves either. Two years ago, to win voter support for a
school construction tax, local school districts decided to
impose the tax only on future residents. And last November, a
proposed property tax increase to improve roads got only 20%
of the vote.</p>
<p>While Santa Clarita revolts against paying the costs of
congestion, however, developers are planning to bring in
more. The county is considering 45 proposals to build 38,000
more houses in the hilly, unincorporated territory outside
the Santa Clarita city limits.</p>
<p>Last year, Santa Clarita sought an expansion of its
"sphere of influence" -- an area over which it has some but
not all control -- from the 40-square-mile city limits to a
200-square-mile area. The county turned the request down last
November.</p>
<p>From Santa Clarita, it is a 40-mile drive up Highway 14 to
a place that home builders and home buyers now consider the
promised land: the Antelope Valley. At more than 2,000 feet
above sea level, this is the high desert -- virtually endless
plateau where the weather is sizzling in the summer, freezing
in the winter and windy all the time.</p>
<p>With growth restrictions limiting their activities
elsewhere, L.A. home builders arrived here in the early '80s,
attracted by the cheap land. They threw up huge subdivisions
around the country towns of Lancaster and Palmdale, and
started selling houses for under $100,000, mostly to young
families tied to jobs in the San Fernando Valley. These new
residents drive 50, 60, even 70 miles each way to work. The
Antelope Valley is expected to grow from around 150,000 today
to more than a half-million people over the next 20 years.</p>
<p>Local political leaders have generally welcomed the
influx. The commuters, as well as the construction industry,
have given the Antelope Valley an economic stability the area
rarely enjoyed in the past, when it was highly dependent on
the aerospace industry. There are some hints of coming
conflict. At meetings of the Lancaster Planning Commission,
the big-name developers who come to plead for zoning changes
are sometimes joined by longtime residents who complain that
the developers are crowding too many homes on small lots. In
fact, lot size is such a sensitive issue that one commission
member lost his seat for daring to tell residents of one
neighborhood that their rural lifestyle is a thing of the
past.</p>
<p>Antelope Valley residents fear nothing more than becoming
"another San Fernando Valley," but, in fact, the area's power
structure is pushing quite deliberately toward the future
that the San Fernando Valley represents. Local business and
political leaders have tried very hard to push the Antelope
Valley past the bedroom stage and make it into a center for
employment, just as the San Fernando Valley is. The two
cities have undertaken a joint commercial marketing effort
that includes advertisements in this newspaper. Already, one
large company, Anderson-Barrows Metals Corp., has been lured
out of a business park in Santa Clarita.</p>
<p>It took the San Fernando Valley four decades to evolve
from a semi-rural suburb to a crowded and economically
powerful urban center. The Antelope Valley is rolling through
the same cycle in only a few years. This fact is reflected
most dramatically in home prices. The average home price has
risen from $80,000 in 1984 to somewhere between $130,000 and
$150,000 today. As the Antelope valley economic development
effort takes off, the area could take on all the unwelcome
characteristics that the locals associate with the San
Fernando Valley.</p>
<p>Just north of Lancaster along Highway 14 lies what has
constituted, up to now, the northern terminus of the L.A.
metropolitan area: the Kern County line. Across the line lie
communities such as Rosamond and Mojave -- tiny, poor desert
towns that originally existed because of the railroads and
have barely survived for decades. Political control lies in
the county seat of Bakersfield, 60 miles northwest.</p>
<p>Some of L.A.'s biggest home builders have been banking
land in Rosamond, and have their eyes on Mojave as well. Last
November, the Kern County board of supervisors approved a new
comprehensive plan for Rosamond, whose current population is
around 11,000, that will permit a population of 80,000 by the
year 2000. And just a few miles northwest of Mojave, in the
mountain town of Tehachapi, real estate developers who
control thousands of acres are talking about building "new
towns" with thousands of jobs and tens of thousands of
people.</p>
<p>The outward push of metropolitan Los Angeles, which began
40 years ago when suburban development hit the San Fernando
Valley, may soon reach communities close to a hundred miles
away. And while those communities may welcome the economic
bonanza at first, soon they too may be faced with the
question of how to accommodate growth while maintaining the
rural way of life that the new residents left places like
Santa Clarita and Lancaster to pursue. And so they will
probably engage in micro-solutions that don't do much to
solve a very macro problem.</p>
