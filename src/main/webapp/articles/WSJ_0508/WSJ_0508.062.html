	<p class="article-leader">OTTAWA -- Canadian housing starts fell 11.9% in April from
March as rising mortgage rates damped housing demand.
   April housing starts declined to a seasonally adjusted
annual rate of 199,000 from a March rate of 226,000, Canada
Mortgage and Housing Corp., a government agency, said.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>April was the first month since February 1988 that the
housing-start rate has fallen below 200,000.</p>
<p>Annual interest charges on a five-year mortgage have risen
to 14 1/4%-14 1/2% from 12% in January. Each percentage point
rise in mortgage rates has pushed thousands of would-be home
buyers out of the market, said Bill Hopkins, vice president
of the Canadian Real Estate Association. Sales of existing
homes in March fell 22.2% from a year earlier.</p>
<p>Ontario showed the biggest drop in new housing activity in
April, with urban starts falling 32.5% to an annual rate of
52,000, the lowest level for the province in more than four
years. The number of new single, detached houses in Toronto
that were unsold rose to more than 500 from about 150 in
mid-1989. Actual starts in the city in January-April were
down 44% from a year earlier.</p>
