	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Christie's International PLC reported somewhat
disappointing results from its evening sale of contemporary
art here last night.
   For the first night of the two-week spring auction season,
roughly one-third of the works of art didn't sell. The total
for the sale came in at $40.2 million, well below the firm's
lowest estimate of $50 million.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>However, strong bidding by Japanese collectors and
investors allayed concerns of some dealers that the Tokyo
stock market's recent decline would trim demand from that
usually lucrative area. The auction house said Asian
investors were responsible for 39% of the dollar total of the
art works sold, compared with 7% at Christie's previous major
sale of contemporary art in November. A Japanese bidder paid
$1.1 million for Andy Warhol's "Myths", a giant silk-screen
of pop-culture icons. The price fell within Christie's
estimated range.</p>
<p>The top-selling piece at the auction was Roy
Lichtenstein's "Kiss II," a large oil on canvas in comic-book
style, which sold for $6.1 million, also within the estimated
range.</p>
<p>Sotheby's Holdings Inc. is to hold its auction of
contemporary art this evening.</p>
