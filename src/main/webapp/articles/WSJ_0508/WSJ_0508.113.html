	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Is Mickey Mouse headed for a trap?
   Several Wall Street analysts and money managers are
worried that this summer could prove disappointing for Walt
Disney shareholders. Even if Disney's numbers are good, they
warn, all the hoopla about competitors MCA and Paramount
could hurt the short-term performance of Disney stock.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Disney could be a victim of its own success. In the past
six years it has gone from dog to darling on Wall Street.
Managers led by Michael Eisner, installed after the company
bought out unwelcome investor Saul Steinberg, have
revitalized Disney's theme park and movie and television
production businesses. The performance landed Eisner on the
cover of Time magazine -- an unusual honor for a corporate
hired hand -- and powered Disney shares to a gain of more
than sevenfold.</p>
<p>Given the lofty expectations now built into the stock
price, some analysts and investors say it will be tough for
Disney to make it through the next few quarters without a
letdown.</p>
<p>"Expectations as to how Disney will do are still too
high," says Christopher Dixon, an analyst with Kidder
Peabody. But because Mr. Dixon believes Disney is "superbly
positioned" for the 1990s, he adds: "Should disappointed
expectations drive Disney stock down, long-term investors
should use that as a buying opportunity."</p>
<p>Some big long-term shareholders have been taking profits
since Disney shares soared above 130 last summer. They closed
yesterday at 113 1/4, up 1/2.</p>
<p>Lincoln Capital Management, Chicago, which last year had
about 4.5% of its $4 billion stock fund invested in 1.7
million shares of Disney, cut its position to zero by the end
of April. Parker Hall, president, says the decision to sell
"principally was based on the stock price and a feeling that
a lot of areas of their business were cyclically going well."
He adds: "Comparisons against their attendance at the parks
and the extraordinary things they've done with movies would
be hard to replicate."</p>
<p>What's going to make the comparisons tough? First, the
Disney-MGM studio tour, which opened in May 1989, has been
drawing capacity crowds to Orlando, Fla., and pumping up
Disney's theme park attendance and profits. But starting this
month, the studio tour will be competing against itself in
the year-to-year comparisons. To boost attendance, Disney has
extended the hours the studio tour is open. But the real kick
won't come until 1993, when a planned doubling of the studio
tour facility is to be completed.</p>
<p>Coming up much sooner is the June 7 grand opening of the
competing Universal Studios tour in Orlando. Built by
Disney's archrival MCA, it drew high marks from a tramload of
analysts. Alan Kassan of Morgan Stanley believes the
Universal Florida tour, which includes King Kong and Jaws,
will do "quite well." At Disney, theme parks and resorts
accounted for 64% of 1989 operating earnings.</p>
<p>Though many analysts believe the Universal tour will help
boost attendance at Disney World and the Disney-MGM tour over
the long term by drawing more people to Orlando, they worry
about the short run. Warren Shaw, managing director of
Chancellor Capital Management, New York, which sold about
250,000 Disney shares in the fourth quarter and still holds
685,000, says, "The main concern or negative here, near-term,
is negative psychological reaction to the MCA studio tour
opening."</p>
<p>Mr. Shaw notes that at its peak last year, Disney was
trading at 25 to 30 times earnings, an extraordinary
multiple. Currently, Disney is trading at about 21 times its
most recent 12-month earnings and about 18 times estimated
fiscal 1990 earnings.</p>
<p>Disney declines to comment, but its management has set a
goal of increasing per-share earnings 20% a year over any
five-year period. Earnings per share increased more than 30%
in fiscal 1988 and 1989, but only 18% in the first six months
of fiscal 1990.</p>
<p>The wild card in Disney's hand this summer is "Dick
Tracy," a movie starring Warren Beatty and Madonna. Opening
June 15, it could be this summer's "Batman," which caused the
acquisitive execs at Time Inc. to say "Holy Box Office" as
they rushed to buy Warner Communications. Both stars have
graced some expensive flops, notably Mr. Beatty's "Ishtar."
Then again, none of those films were produced by Disney. Nor
will "Dick Tracy" give Madonna the kind of exposure she's had
in Vanity Fair magazine and on MTV. "Dick Tracy" won't get a
rating more risque than PG.</p>
<p>"Dick Tracy" isn't finished yet, so even the theater
owners haven't seen it, a Disney spokeswoman says. It will be
competing with "Days of Thunder," starring Tom Cruise, from
Paramount, and "Back to the Future III" from Universal. And
as Mr. Dixon of Kidder notes, "whether `Dick Tracy' is
successful or not, it will have very little impact on
Disney's bottom line." However, he says, "the psychological
impact could be hurtful."</p>
