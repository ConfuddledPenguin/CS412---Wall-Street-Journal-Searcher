	<h3>If They Are Not Under the Collar, Workers Are Buttoning Their Lips</h3>

	<p class="article-leader">Inspired by events in Eastern Europe, Jack Hepfer decided
to make a radical suggestion at Safeco Corp.'s annual
meeting.
   Mr. Hepfer, a lawyer who recently retired after 28 years
with the Seattle insurance concern, proposed that the company
do away with its rule requiring male employees to wear white
shirts every day.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"The Berlin Wall has come down," he says. "In time, maybe
this wall will come down, too."</p>
<p>The call for change came after Mr. Hepfer did some
research on Safeco's founder, H.K. Dent. He found that while
Mr. Dent cautioned salesmen in the 1950s that flashy duds
might "distract a prospect's attention from a sales talk . .
. he felt there's nothing the matter with colored shirts."</p>
<p>The shirt issue "wasn't on my mind 24 hours a day," when
he worked at Safeco, Mr. Hepfer says, but it bothered him
that "outsiders scoff a little at the damn uniform." He also
believes the policy is sexist. "I'm not looking for an ACLU
case, but a woman can wear blouses of any color she wants."</p>
<p>The crowd at last week's annual meeting met Mr. Hepfer's
suggestion with applause and laughter. "The place was
rolling," says spokeswoman Pat Hillis. But the suggestion
wasn't embraced by Safeco's chief executive officer, Bruce
Maines, who said the code was part of the corporate culture.
He said he owns 35 white shirts.</p>
<p>"We wouldn't want to throw out a 60-year tradition," says
Ms. Hillis, adding that the company regards the policy "as a
badge of honor." For years, she says, students at the nearby
University of Washington "have referred to us as `the
shirts.'"</p>
<p>Safeco, which employs about 5,300, requires all its male
white-collar workers to be just that. Clerical employees have
a less stringent dress code. Women can wear different hues as
long as their attire is "professional." During the energy
crunch of the 1970s, when thermostats were turned down, the
company liberalized its dress code to allow women to wear
slacks to the office.</p>
<p>Men can express their fashion flair with "conservative
ties in good taste," and mavericks can even don summer
weight, light blue suits. In addition, "we have absolutely no
objection to striped shirts," says Ms. Hillis, "as long as
they're white on white."</p>
