	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- The Conference Board reports that total
help-wanted ad volume fell one point in March, but a rebound
is expected.
   The Help-Wanted Advertising Index, a seasonally adjusted
indicator of hiring plans, fell from 140 in February, to 139,
the lowest point in three months. That figure is 11 points
lower than the year-ago level of 150.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>First-quarter economic activity was strong enough to stop
a further decline. Ken Goldstein, a Conference Board
economist, said growth in the second and third quarters is
expected to be slightly faster.</p>
<p>Ad volume, measured in 51 major U.S. newspapers, declined
in six of the nine major regions of the country. The West
North Central region recorded the steepest drop -- 11%. And
the East South Central and East North Central regions showed
increases of 4.5% and 2.5% respectively. Mr. Goldstein said,
"Hardest hit areas continued to show improvements, although
at an anxiety-inducing slow pace."</p>
