	<p class="article-leader">SANTA FE, N.M. -- Even in this city of artists, New Agers
and freethinkers, the Santa Fe Institute ranks as an oddity.
   The headquarters of this private think tank is a converted
convent built of adobe. Inside are Ph.D.s with ponytails who
wander the halls talking about Boolean algebra and artificial
life. Biologists rub shoulders with computer jocks.
Economists argue with physicists. No idea is too crazy.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"I can come here and be totally outrageous for a while,
say things that are off the wall, and still get a hearing,"
says W. Brian Arthur, a Stanford University economist.</p>
<p>Yet the Santa Fe Institute isn't just another kooky little
outfit. To begin with, four Nobel laureates in physics and
economics are actively involved in what goes on here. Santa
Fe's chairman is Robert O. Anderson, the retired head of Arco
and of the Aspen Institute. The president of the organization
is a noted scientist, George Cowan, from Los Alamos National
Laboratory.</p>
<p>Ideas bandied about here have aroused the interest of the
commercial world, from Wall Streeters, to California venture
capitalists, to Citicorp's chairman, John Reed. A visit he
made here in 1986 triggered a big effort to develop a
sophisticated model of the global economy.</p>
<p>One idea that came out of that: "the law of increasing
returns." Once things get rolling, they keep rolling and feed
on themselves, up to a point. Hence, mudslides and
avalanches, real-estate booms and stock-market crashes. (Most
academics had been focusing mainly on a world in equilibrium
and on the law of diminishing returns.)</p>
<p>Unlocking the secrets of complex phenomena is the stated
purpose of the handful of full-timers, as well as the
hundreds of transient thinkers who are here for a week or a
month or a year. Some of the work falls into the
scientifically fashionable category of "chaos theory," which
holds that certain events are neither strictly predictable
nor random.</p>
<p>But the real world's interest in this place has little to
do with intellectual fashion and a lot to do with making
money.</p>
<p>And so it came to pass that the Santa Fe crowd is trying
to figure out how the price of gold fluctuates and what
pushes IBM stock up and down. Researchers are putting
together computer models that they hope might explain, for
instance, what is not already known about why Taiwan is
booming and the Philippines is an economic mess. Economists
here think they already know that the "law of increasing
returns" explains why the Betamax videocassette format was
overwhelmed by VHS.</p>
<p>Wall Street investment houses, such as Morgan Stanley &
Co., have sent emissaries to sniff around. Their curiosity
was piqued by a "double auction" market developed here.
Computer-driven trading strategies pretend to buy and sell
securities, and the Santa Fe researchers record and analyze
the results. Among other things, they want to know if
computers can be programmed to "learn" from trading
experience.</p>
<p>Santa Fe's computer work has drawn attention from
researchers in biology and medicine. George Sugihara of
Scripps Institution, in La Jolla, Calif., says that Santa
Fe's theories offer superior ways to predict measles
epidemics. And now he is using the models to explore the
baffling changes in body temperature found in malaria
patients.</p>
<p>"This is important," Mr. Sugihara says, "because there's a
point when the temperature returns to near normal, and that's
when there's great danger of death. So if you could predict
that, you could make sure the patient is under intensive care
at that time."</p>
<p>The Santa Fe Institute has a chronic problem of its own: a
lack of money. And that, in turn, isn't helped by the aura
the place has of detached otherworldliness.</p>
<p>The institute has been short of cash ever since it was
founded in 1984 by a group of scientists -- mostly physicists
-- from nearby Los Alamos. When the organization began, its
goal was to become a facsimile of Rockefeller University -- a
large, prestigious center for advanced research.</p>
<p>Today, its budget is still rather piddling, just $2
million a year. The biggest chunks of money come from the
National Science Foundation, the Department of Energy and the
MacArthur Foundation. The rest comes from private outfits and
individuals. Robert Noyce, the founder of Intel Corp.,
recently anted up $50,000.</p>
<p>At least one board member complains that the institute is
far too shy about hitting up rich people for money. Arthur
Spiegel, an Albuquerque fund raiser and the think tank's
first benefactor, claims to be very unhappy and to have
resigned from the board over its unaggressive approach to
raising money. He has since rejoined the board, however, and
has high praise for the institute's purposes.</p>
<p>Mr. Anderson, the chairman, says money is a problem
because the institute appeals to a "narrow audience." But
because he has connections, he continues to bring in
well-heeled potential donors for casual visits. One morning
recently, Mr. Anderson appeared at the door in his cowboy hat
and bandanna, with David Rockefeller and his wife in tow. The
Rockefellers spent maybe 45 minutes talking, about population
growth, global warming and such with institute personnel.</p>
<p>And that suggests the second problem: the abstract nature
of what people here are thinking. Mostly, people at the
institute are building computer models of complex phenomena.
The models are supposed to show how molecules, markets or
national economies evolve. "We give you movies, instead of
just a snapshot," says Mr. Cowan, the institute's president.
"We think it's the next big thing."</p>
<p>Nobody questions the Santa Fe crowd's blue-ribbon
credentials, but some critics don't expect much in the way of
results from such a theoretical pursuit. They find it faintly
amusing that Citicorp's Mr. Reed would hire the institute to
mix math and physics in hopes of averting some future Latin
American debt fiasco.</p>
<p>When Mr. Reed visited Santa Fe, he brought along three
senior assistants. The Santa Fe people assembled a handful of
physicists, computer scientists and economists. They took
space at a nearby resort for two days and tried to create an
informal, relaxed setting. But they recall Mr. Reed wasn't in
good humor.</p>
<p>Economists hadn't predicted the Latin American debt
crisis, Mr. Reed complained. The debtors' inability to repay
had created a gigantic problem for lenders like Citicorp.
Econometric models hadn't anticipated the vicious combination
of lower rates of inflation and rising interest rates that
had devastated the economies of Mexico, Argentina and Brazil.
So Mr. Reed, who is a metallurgical engineering graduate of
Massachusetts Institute of Technology, put up some money and
asked the Santa Fe Institute to work on a new, improved model
of the world economy.</p>
<p>Two Nobel laureates led the effort -- Philip Anderson, a
Princeton University physicist, and Kenneth Arrow, a Stanford
University economist. The manifest result of this work in
progress was a 10-day meeting on markets and the global
economy in September 1987 for which Citicorp put up about
$100,000.</p>
<p>Markets aren't perfectly rational, the participants
concurred. Unsophisticated investors create "noise" and drive
prices up or down, beyond rational expectations. Things that
start rolling tend to snowball.</p>
<p>David Pines, a physicist at the University of Illinois,
listened to all the talk, got to worrying about his
investments, and decided to bail out of the stock market. "I
called my financial adviser, but he persuaded me against
pulling out. So I didn't," Mr. Pines says. Five weeks later,
the market crashed. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped
508 points in a single day.</p>
<p>Today, more than two years later, the project on the world
economy is still going strong. And it is without conclusive
results. Citicorp officials say they are patient and that
they are continuing to pay for the work. "If these guys at
Santa Fe can't do it, nobody can," says Eugenia Singer, a
Citicorp vice president. "We knew they wouldn't solve the
problem {of modeling the global economy} in one or two years,
maybe not even in 10 years. The problems are humongous."</p>
<p>Mr. Arthur, the Stanford economist who returned to the
university after a year in Santa Fe, thinks that more
economists might start to embrace ideas of the sort being
generated here. He sees a "sea change in economics," for
instance, with more mainstream economists paying attention to
snowballing and the law of increasing returns.</p>
<p>The theory applies not only to markets but to business
strategy, Mr. Arthur says. For example, once a product or a
technology starts to pull ahead of the pack, its success
tends to bring more success, more market share, more sales
volume. The tendency is great for the "winner to take most,"
as Mr. Arthur puts it.</p>
<p>Mr. Arthur says that economists have paid attention to
such ideas in the past, including particularly the late
Alfred Marshall. "But the prevalent view is still that things
happen in equilibrium, and that there are constant or
diminishing returns."</p>
<p>In a world economy based on natural resources, maybe the
law of diminishing returns had its utility, Mr. Arthur says,
but no longer. "A high-tech, high value-added world calls for
a new kind of economics."</p>
<p>Seizing market share is crucial, he says, pointing to a
strategy often used by Japanese companies. Often the most
successful Japanese companies win by letting others do
expensive research; then they make a big push as the market
is building and cut prices to increase sales volume. That
drives down costs, which builds more volume. Gradually, the
competitors are squeezed. Mr. Arthur points to the way
Matsushita Electric's VHS videocassette recorder trounced
Sony's Betamax.</p>
<p>Windows of opportunity tend to close, so a tiny initial
advantage in business can be critical in determining the
outcome of a battle.</p>
<p>Another, related idea, much in vogue at Santa Fe, is that
since small differences are important, precise measurements
are too, particularly when an enterprise is just getting
started. They help predict outcomes.</p>
<p>J. Doyne Farmer tried to apply that idea to roulette. Back
in the late 1970s, Mr. Farmer was studying for a Ph.D. in
physics. In his spare time, he nursed a passion for roulette.
And he worked up complex equations on a computer that would
calculate the croupier's toss, the spin of the wheel, the
path of the ball, and a rough estimate of where it would
land.</p>
<p>Then he strapped on a little homemade computer and went
off to Las Vegas. He made his calculations on the hoof,
placed his bets and eventually won nearly $7,000.</p>
<p>Today, the tall, ponytailed Mr. Farmer divides his time
between the Los Alamos National Laboratory and the Santa Fe
Institute. Among other things, he is searching for deep
patterns of predictive value in the price of IBM shares, and
in the gyrations of gold prices. Knowing "what predicts
what," to use his phrase, could have money-making
possibilities. So far, he has had little success, but he
communicates with so-called black box researchers at Wall
Street brokerage houses.</p>
<p>Mr. Farmer says he is ambivalent about trying to apply his
theories solely to making money. "I'm confused on the issue,"
he says. "I'm a scientist, and I'm trying to have fun. For
me, that means doing something intellectually challenging and
fundamental that touches on philosophy and religion as well
as physics." On the other hand, he is tired of applying for
research grants. To be independently wealthy would make his
professional life easier. "I really do think some of the
ideas we have could be used to make money."</p>
<p>So does James Pelkey, a California venture capitalist who
recently bought land in Santa Fe and is building a house. He
believes that some of the computer programs being developed
at the institute could be turned into commercial
computer-software for business. Sales forecasting is one of
the applications he thinks is possible.</p>
<p>But anybody who thinks the city of Santa Fe is going to
become another Silicon Valley because of the institute
probably is misusing his powers of prediction. The city is
small, with just 55,000 people. It is isolated. Jets aren't
allowed to land at Santa Fe's little airport. Water is
scarce, and so are skilled purchasing agents, personnel
managers and technicians.</p>
<p>It is more likely, Mr. Pelkey believes, that some
companies will incubate in Santa Fe, then move to
Albuquerque, 50 miles south.</p>
<p>Morton Meyerson, the former president of EDS Systems and a
part-time resident of Santa Fe, also doubts that the city's
burgeoning development as a center of art, music and tourism
will be matched by a parallel, entrepreneurial boom.</p>
<p>He thinks that that is 10 times more likely to happen to
Austin, Texas, five times as likely to happen to Phoenix. "On
the other hand," Mr. Meyerson says, given all the thinkers
gathered hereabouts, it is likely that "Santa Fe will become
a center for the exploration of the great unknown."</p>
