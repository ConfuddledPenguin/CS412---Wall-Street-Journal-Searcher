	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- The White House said President Bush would
enter deficit-cutting talks without preconditions, but
refused to elaborate on comments by Republican leaders in the
House and Senate that the president is prepared to negotiate
on tax increases.
   In the first White House comment on Mr. Bush's Sunday
night meeting with four top congressional leaders, spokesman
Marlin Fitzwater said Mr. Bush agreed only to accept a
suggestion by Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell (D.,
Maine) that any talks begin with no conditions.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Rather than discuss specifics, Mr. Fitzwater said, the
participants agreed "to stick to the phrase of `no
preconditions' and begin an open debate that is unfettered
with conclusions about positions taken in the past." But he
added, "the tax matter was not discussed in the meeting
{Sunday}. The president's . . . philosophy on this issue is
quite well-known."</p>
<p>Mr. Fitzwater's comments underscore the delicacy of a
budget summit that, if successful, requires both parties to
embrace unpopular tax increases and spending cuts in order to
narrow the deficit significantly. White House Budget Director
Richard Darman estimates that $45 billion to $55 billion in
savings are needed to reach the Gramm-Rudman budget law's
deficit target of $64 billion for the fiscal year that begins
Oct. 1.</p>
<p>House Minority Leader Robert Michel (R., Ill.) suggested
Sunday that -- in the current political context -- the
president's statement that "everything is on the table"
demonstrates his willingness to accept taxes. Senate
Republican Leader Robert Dole of Kansas made similar
statements.</p>
<p>Sen. Mitchell, however, offered no confirmation. "I
recognize the desire to draw large and sweeping conclusions,"
Sen. Mitchell told reporters yesterday. "I have no basis for
doing so."</p>
<p>"It could be a sea change if the leadership of the
Congress goes to the table understanding that everything is
on the table," said New Mexico Sen. Pete Domenici, senior
Republican on the Budget Committee.</p>
<p>Sen. Mitchell and House Speaker Thomas Foley (D., Wash.)
jointly briefed other congressional leaders yesterday on
their meeting with Mr. Bush. They plan separate meetings with
rank-and-file members today, hoping to build support for
whatever pact emerges from a budget summit.</p>
<p>Democrats remain skeptical toward White House overtures.
In a stormy meeting of the House Democratic whip organization
last week, the leadership was forced to concede that it had
already been too trusting of their Republican opponents,
allowing them to avoid putting Mr. Bush's budget to a vote on
the House floor. Similar cynicism applies to talk now that
Mr. Bush has put taxes on the table, and some Democrats
assume that whatever the administration agrees to will be
hidden behind phrases such as "revenue enhancements."</p>
<p>"When the president says taxes, it will have several
syllables," Senate Finance Committee Chairman Lloyd Bentsen
(D., Texas) said yesterday.</p>
<p>As the majority party, Democrats know that they can't
afford to walk away from an invitation to talks, and there is
a sense that the administration also is under stiff pressure.
It needs an agreement both to aid the economy by relieving
pressure on interest rates and to avoid across-the-board
budget cuts under Gramm-Rudman this fall that could be so
large they hurt the administration's Pentagon and foreign-aid
priorities.</p>
<p>The White House is now saying that the federal debt
ceiling must be raised in July, earlier than previously
forecast. And at the Sunday meeting, White House Chief of
Staff John Sununu suggested setting target dates for
different stages of the negotiations to expedite them, one
lawmaker said.</p>
<p>Separately, the newest member of the Finance Committee,
Sen. John Breaux, asserted that Mr. Bush knows that tax
increases of some sort are necessary. "Reality has now set
in, as opposed to politics," he said. "He would like . . .
aggressive efforts on the part of the Democrats insisting on
it, which I don't think is going to happen." Sen. Breaux, a
Louisiana Democrat, said he would prefer a $5-a-barrel
oil-import fee to raising individual income-tax rates.</p>
<p>Energy taxes of all sorts are mentioned with increasing
frequency in Washington. "When you take all the husks off,"
said former Reagan campaign manager John Sears, "what he {Mr.
Bush} is really saying is `no change in the income tax.' He'd
stand for some other taxes like an energy tax." Mr. Sears
sees political wisdom in that distinction. "Really what most
people think about when they think about taxes is the income
tax," he said.</p>
<p>Mr. Fitzwater said Mr. Bush and the leaders agreed that,
if talks begin, any participant can bring up any subject,
talks will continue without any deadline as long as both
sides find them productive, and discussions will be kept as
secret as possible.</p>
<p>The prospect of a bipartisan compromise pact may delay
further action on Democratic-backed budget plans. Senate
staffers said Senate leaders are likely to delay debate on
the Budget Committee's $43 billion fiscal 1991
deficit-reduction package to see how talks are going. Sen.
Mitchell said no decision on that has been made, while Sen.
Domenici said he sees no merit in taking up the committee's
plan at this time.</p>
<p>The House Ways and Means Committee has stopped work on tax
bills pending the outcome of a summit, but the staff is
preparing both tax-increase and spending-cut options for
Chairman Dan Rostenkowski (D., Ill.) to raise at a summit.
Rep. Rostenkowski also is preparing to submit a bill this
week that would replace the Gramm-Rudman deficit-cutting law
with his own plan to force budget reductions and tax
increases, using the debt ceiling as the lever. It also would
take the Social Security surplus out of the deficit
calculation. The Bush administration has resisted repealing
Gramm-Rudman, but wants to change it.</p>
<p>In the Senate, aides expect talks to begin on the process
of the summit, and are optimistic that such talks could
produce something significant. At a breakfast meeting of
Democratic staff directors in the Senate yesterday morning,
the mood was upbeat. "People seem to be taking it seriously,
it's got possibilities," one participant said. "There was no
reluctance to get down and roll up the sleeves."</p>
