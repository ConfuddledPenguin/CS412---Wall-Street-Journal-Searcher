	<p class="article-leader">SANTA CLARA, Calif. -- Siliconix Inc. said it is in direct
negotiations with International Rectifier Corp. with regard
to an April 9 patent infringement ruling.
   A federal judge ruled in April that the semiconductor
maker had infringed on certain patents related to
International Rectifier's power transistor technology. Partly
as a result of the adverse judgment, Siliconix subsequently
filed for protection under Chapter 11 of the federal
Bankruptcy Code.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Siliconix said it has met with International Rectifier
several times since the court ruling, and added that it hopes
the parties can reach an agreement soon to resolve the
four-year-old dispute.</p>
