	<p class="article-leader">MCI Communications Corp., long opposed to paying any
dividend on its common stock, declared an initial semiannual
dividend of five cents a share.
   While nominal, the payout is aimed at attracting new
investors to the Washington-based long-distance company and
rewarding the patience of its current holders, said Daniel F.
Akerson, MCI's chief financial officer.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"Many institutional investors can't hold the stock of a
company that doesn't pay a dividend," said Mr. Akerson. "This
will help widen our base" of ownership.</p>
<p>Based on MCI's current stock price, the annualized payout
of 10 cents a share will represent a yield of about 0.25%. In
contrast, the per-share yield for archrival American
Telephone & Telegraph Co., one of the most widely held stocks
in the world, is $1.32 a year, or about 3.3%.</p>
<p>At MCI, the dividend question has been a sensitive subject
since the company began trading publicly in 1972. MCI's
chairman and founder, William McGowan, has been opposed to
paying dividends because, in his view, they are taxed twice,
first as corporate profits and then as personal income.</p>
<p>But since the company began to have positive cash flow in
the 1988 third quarter, Mr. Akerson said, MCI has been
seriously discussing the possibility of paying at least a
token amount to shareholders.</p>
<p>The dividend declaration was viewed on Wall Street as a
further indication of MCI's maturity and strength. In
national over-the-counter trading, MCI closed at $38.25, up
37.5 cents a share. More than two million shares changed
hands, making MCI one of the most active issues.</p>
<p>"The dividend shows that the company is confident enough
in its cash position not only to make acquisitions, but also
to pay a dividend," said Edward M. Greenberg, a
telecommunications analyst with Morgan Stanley & Co. Last
month, MCI signed a pact to acquire Telecom USA for about
$1.25 billion.</p>
<p>MCI's Mr. Akerson said he expects the company to keep its
new semiannual payment at the current level for at least "two
or three years." He said MCI's free cash flow is strong
enough to support such an amount, but such recent
acquisitions as Telecom USA will probably prevent the company
from increasing the payout rate anytime soon. In 1989, MCI
had free cash flow of $225 million. The company said it
defines free cash flow as net income plus depreciation minus
capital expenditures.</p>
<p>Once company executives "sort through the acquisitions,
and we make sure we're in good shape," Mr. Akerson said, "we
could decide to increase it (the dividend) or we could decide
to go quarterly."</p>
<p>Joel Gross, a telecommunications analyst with Donaldson,
Lufkin & Jenrette Securities Corp., said most investors
"don't want MCI to become a dividend company." He said he
thinks they would "rather see the company reinvest the cash
in futher growth and expansion."</p>
