	<p class="article-leader">CHICAGO -- Vernon R. Loucks, Baxter International Inc.'s
chairman and chief executive officer, reiterated that the
company sold its Israeli plant for business reasons, and not
to win removal from the Arab League blacklist of companies
doing business in Israel.
   Mr. Loucks told shareholders at the company's annual
meeting that while the issue "is a source of some
embarrassment . . . because it has been brought up {in a way
that} presumes guilt" on Baxter's part, the company had since
1974 been studying problems with its Israeli business that
were unrelated to its Arab League blacklisting.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>As reported in a page one story in The Wall Street Journal
earlier this month, Baxter was removed from the Arab
blacklist last year after more than a decade of being shut
out of most Middle Eastern markets. Its de-blacklisting
followed by about a year the sale of the Ashdod, Israel,
plant that prompted Baxter's blacklisting in the first place.</p>
<p>A U.S. anti-boycott law forbids the sale of Israeli
facilities to win removal from the Arab League blacklist.</p>
<p>The Securities and Exchange Commission and the Commerce
Department are reviewing the matter, and the audit committee
of the Baxter board has commissioned an outside lawyer to
conduct an independent investigation.</p>
