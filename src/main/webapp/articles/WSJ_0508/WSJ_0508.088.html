	<p class="article-leader">IRVINE, Calif. -- Fluor Corp., which holds a 57.5% stake
in Doe Run Co., said it agreed to pay $125 million to acquire
the rest of the company from Homestake Mining Co.
   Homestake said the sale of its 42.5% interest in the lead
production company would result in after-tax proceeds of
about $95 million and a net gain of about $40 million. The
sale, contingent only upon government approval, is expected
to close this summer.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Under the joint ownership arrangement, most decisions
required approval of both partners. "The sale will resolve
differences of opinion about the direction of the business,"
said Harry M. Conger, Homestake chairman and chief executive
officer.</p>
<p>Doe Run, based in St. Louis, is the largest integrated
lead producer in North America, with about a 60% share of the
U.S. market, Fluor said. Last year, Doe Run posted $68
million in operating profit on $260 million of revenue.</p>
<p>Full ownership "increases the strategic options
available," said Fluor's chief executive officer, Les G.
McCraw. For example, Doe Run is expected to expand its
activities in the recycled lead market, a spokesman said. The
largest market for both new and recycled lead is automobile
batteries.</p>
<p>Fluor is an engineering and construction concern with
investments in lead and coal. Homestake, based in San
Francisco, is a gold-mining company with interests in the
U.S., Australia, Chile and Canada.</p>
