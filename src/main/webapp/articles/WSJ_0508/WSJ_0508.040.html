	<p class="article-leader">Businesses and schools are teaming up to teach students a
lesson: Good grades and good jobs go together.
   The growing efforts are designed primarily to motivate
students who aren't headed for college. They range from
paying more attention to high school grade transcripts to
promising jobs to students who demonstrate competence in
courses that teach skills employers need.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"We have got a pretty good system for moving from school
to college, but we don't have a good transition from school
to work," says Bill Honig, California's Superintendent of
Public Instruction. In contrast to colleges, employers rarely
look at the records of high school graduates going directly
into the work force. For these students, "there's no reason
to work hard," Mr. Honig says.</p>
<p>As a result, many employers complain they have a hard time
finding enough workers with adequate skills for entry-level
jobs that require the use of computers, writing or elementary
math. Jere Jacobs, an assistant vice president at Pacific
Telesis Group, says that only 40% of the 6,500 annual
applicants for entry-level jobs such as telephone operators
can pass "an employment test pegged to the junior high
level."</p>
<p>The new school/business programs are aimed at changing
that. In Fort Worth, Texas, Superintendent of Schools Don
Roberts has established a business-dominated task force to
look at entry-level job requirements at such companies as
General Dynamics Corp., Tandy Corp., Pier 1 Imports Inc.,
American Airlines Inc. and the Fort Worth Star-Telegram.
"What do secretaries in your organization do?" Mr. Roberts
wants to know. "What level of word processing, math and
reading do they need?" Then the schools will review their
courses to make sure they're teaching the required skills.</p>
<p>Mr. Roberts hopes that business will respond to the school
system's curricular review by promising jobs to students who
acquire the necessary skills. He also hopes that firms will
provide summer jobs and apprenticeship programs to reward
younger students who do well in school.</p>
<p>California is trying to launch a number of pilot projects
with similar goals. "We want to be able to tell kids, `If you
achieve this level of performance, you'll get this kind of
job,'" Mr. Honig says.</p>
<p>The efforts to link grades and jobs were triggered by John
Bishop, a professor at the School of Industrial and Labor
Relations at Cornell University. He observed that students
who aren't headed for college have little incentive to study
hard because businesses rarely look at their school records.
"The labor market fails to reward effort and achievement in
high school" with higher pay or better jobs, he wrote in an
article in Educational Researcher.</p>
<p>Last year, Mr. Bishop's writing began to attract wide
attention in school circles. Mr. Honig in California, Albert
Shanker, the president of American Federation of Teachers,
and Scott Thomson, who was then executive director of the
National Association of Secondary School Principals, all
began echoing his theme that businesses were missing
opportunities to spur school performance.</p>
<p>Another professor, James Rosenbaum of Northwestern
University, noted that one of the reasons Japanese students
work harder than Americans is that Japanese schools work
closely with businesses. The Japanese send the best students
to the best jobs, he said, whereas "Americans are suspicious
of linkages between public schools and employers." Of the
high school graduates in Japan who don't attend college,
almost all start working immediately after graduation, while
fewer than half the American students not headed for college
have jobs by the time they graduate.</p>
<p>U.S. business groups are getting the message. The American
Business Conference has started to work on incentive programs
in California and elsewhere. "We're trying to develop a
system where business will start communicating to students
early on, perhaps in seventh or eighth grade, that if they're
exceptional students and meet the requirements, we're going
to reward them," says Peggy Murray, the director of ABC's
education task force.</p>
<p>Working with ABC and the National Alliance of Business,
the Educational Testing Service has begun to develop a
project, called Worklink, to maintain computerized school,
test and work records that businesses could check when they
hire. Schools in Tampa, Fla., and business leaders in
Spokane, Wash., are looking at the program, which proponents
argue would give students incentives to boost their grades
and establish uniform rating standards.</p>
<p>High school transcripts often are hard to understand
because course descriptions and grading patterns differ
widely. In addition, transcripts don't tell employers what
they want to know about work habits, reliability and social
skills.</p>
<p>Schools are beginning to change that. In Colville, Wash.,
a town of 5,000 northeast of Spokane, transcripts report on
attendance, punctuality, ability to work in groups,
willingness to do more than the minimum required and other
factors. California is looking at ways to include similar
information in its transcripts.</p>
<p>Any moves to make transcripts more useful -- both as
incentives to students and information for employers -- will
help students find better jobs. Currently, "one of the
saddest consequences of the lack of signals of achievement in
high school is that employers with good jobs offering
training and job security are unwilling to take the risk of
hiring a recent high school graduate," Mr. Bishop says.</p>
