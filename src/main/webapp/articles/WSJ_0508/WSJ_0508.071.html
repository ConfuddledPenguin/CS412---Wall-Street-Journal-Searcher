	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Bond market trading nearly ground to a halt
yesterday as investors waited anxiously for the Treasury
Department's enormous quarterly bond auction.
   Trading often slows considerably ahead of the multibillion
dollar bond sale, partly because of investor concerns about
the market's ability to absorb such a large supply of new
securities.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Moreover, the auctions are like big-stakes poker games for
bond dealers who bid against each other to buy the government
paper. For investors, buying bonds before government bond
auctions can be dangerous since prices sometimes gyrate
wildly depending upon how dealers play the game.</p>
<p>"Nobody wants to make a strong move," ahead of the
quarterly auction, said James R. Capra, a senior vice
president at Shearson Lehman Government Securities Inc.</p>
<p>The Treasury is scheduled to sell $30.5 billion of notes
and bonds this week, the proceeds of which will be used to
refinance Uncle Sam's maturing debt and pay the bills created
by the federal budget deficit. Today, $10.5 billion of
three-year notes will be sold, followed by $10 billion of
10-year notes tomorrow and $10 billion of 30-year bonds
Thursday.</p>
<p>In trading yesterday, the benchmark 30-year bond ended
less than 1/4 point lower, or $2.50 for a bond with a $1,000
face amount. The yield rose slightly to 8.84%.</p>
<p>Bond dealers said the losses reflected profit-taking
during overnight trading in Tokyo that carried over into U.S.
trading. The dealers said prices barely budged the rest of
the day.</p>
<p>"All of the declines occurred overseas and nothing
happened in the U.S.," said William Sullivan, money market
economist at Dean Witter Reynolds Inc.</p>
<p>Today's three-year note auction is expected to go
smoothly, with strong demand from individual investors and
from domestic commercial banks. The banks "are flush with
funds and are trying to stay away from troubled {leveraged
buy-out loans} and problem real estate investments. Treasury
securities are plain vanilla, but in this environment they
look more like the Haagen-Dazs of choices," said Robert
Brusca, chief economist at Nikko Securities Co.
International.</p>
<p>Individuals usually buy at auctions through so-called
"noncompetitive bids," which are expected to total as much as
$1.75 billion. That would be up from $1.19 billion at the
last three-year note sale.</p>
<p>There is mild concern about Japanese participation at the
auction. Mr. Brusca expects the Japanese to buy between 25%
and 30% of the notes and bonds. Their purchases, he said, are
likely to be concentrated in the 10-year and 30-year issues.</p>
<p>Although Treasury bond yields have eroded since Friday's
bond market rally pushed yields to their lowest levels in
weeks, they are still well above levels at the start of the
year. That should make yields attractive to Japanese
investors, said Mr. Brusca.</p>
<p>Japanese investors typically are sizable buyers at
Treasury refundings, sometimes purchasing as much as 40%. At
the last refunding in February, Japanese institutional
investors purchased an estimated 30% of the $30 billion of
securities sold.</p>
<p>In when-issued activity yesterday, the new three-year
notes were quoted at a yield of 8.78%, the 10-year notes at
8.84% and the 30-year bonds at 8.82%.</p>
<p>Foreign Bonds</p>
<p>The Canadian government bond market, which has been badly
hurt in recent months, rallied for the third consecutive
session with some issues rising as much as 2 1/4 points.</p>
<p>Canada's 10.5% benchmark 10-year note was quoted late
yesterday at a price of 96 to yield about 11.17%, up more
than one point from Friday. The benchmark 20-year bond jumped
2 1/8 point to 89.50 to yield 10.76%.</p>
<p>Some traders warned that the turnaround reflects technical
factors and is not a sign that the market is on the road to
recovery -- at least not yet.</p>
<p>"We did see some buying in the market, but in no way does
that mean the downward trend is reversing," said Alberto
Franco, a Canadian bond trader at Salomon Brothers Inc. in
New York. He said that while "Canadian bonds seem very
cheap," the securities are likely to fall further in the
weeks ahead until a dispute between the Canadian government
and the province of Quebec is resolved.</p>
<p>The dispute, which has created jitters in Canada's
financial markets, involves a proposed constitutional
amendment known as the Meech Lake accord. If approved, the
accord, negotiated in 1987, would recognize Quebec as a
"distinct society" within Canada. Many Quebec politicians say
they will seek independence from Canada if the accord isn't
ratified by June 23.</p>
<p>Analysts said concerns about the Meech Lake accord were
largely responsible for the Canadian bond market's poor
showing. J.P. Morgan Securities Inc.'s Canadian bond index
has posted a total return of a negative 7% so far this year.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Canadian bond traders say spreads between
active Canadian bonds and comparable U.S. government bonds
will remain wide. Mr. Franco said yields on 10-year Canadian
notes are about 2.40 percentage points higher than yields on
10-year Treasury notes. While that's a little less than a few
weeks ago when the spread was three percentage points, it's
still wider than last year when spreads ranged between one
and 1.5 percentage points.</p>
<p>In late trading yesterday, Canada's 10.5% benchmark
10-year note was quoted at a price of 96 to yield about
11.17%.</p>
<p>Treasury Securities</p>
<p>The benchmark 30-year bond ended at a price of 96 11/32 to
yield 8.84% compared with 96 19/32 to yield 8.81%. The latest
10-year notes ended at 97 19/32 to yield 8.85% compared with
97 24/32 to yield 8.83%.</p>
<p>The Treasury sold $16.8 billion of bills yesterday at the
government's regular weekly bill auction. The average rate on
new three-month Treasury bills was 7.79% while the average
rate on new six-month bills was 7.84%.</p>
<p>The average rates were down from last week's auction when
they were 7.91% and 8.03%, respectively.</p>
<p>Here are details of the Treasury bill auction:</p>
<p>Rates are determined by the difference between the
purchase price and face value. Thus, higher bidding narrows
the investor's return while lower bidding widens it. The
percentage rates are calculated on a 360-day year, while the
coupon equivalent yield is based on a 365-day year.</p>

<p>Both issues are dated May 10. The 13-week bills mature
Aug. 9, 1990, and the 26-week bills mature Nov. 8, 1990.</p>
<p>Mortgage-Backed Securities</p>
<p>Mortgage securities came under pressure from rumored sales
by the Resolution Trust Corp. and speculation that the RTC
will liquidate a considerable amount of mortgages during the
current quarter. Active issues ended 1/8 to 6/32 lower.</p>
<p>There was talk that RTC sold $250 million of Federal Home
Loan Mortgage Corp. 8 1/2% securities and as many as $300
million of principal-only stripped mortgage securities.</p>
<p>On Friday, the RTC, the government conservator for failed
thrifts, was rumored to have sold $500 million of mortgage
securities, consisting of about $350 million of Government
National Mortgage Association 9% securities and $150 million
of Freddie Mac 8 1/2% securities.</p>
<p>The mortgage market was spooked because the RTC has said
it wants to resolve the situation of some 141 thrifts by the
end of the quarter. These thrift resolutions presumably will
mean sizable mortgage-backed sales.</p>
<p>The prospect of RTC sales comes at time a when the Office
of the Comptroller of the Currency is weighing the imposition
of new regulations that would clamp down on bank purchases of
risky derivative mortgage securities. Banks now own an
estimated $100 billion of mortgage derivatives and a share of
those holdings could run afoul of any regulations from the
Comptroller's office.</p>
<p>Ginnie Mae 9% issue for May delivery ended at 94 14/32,
down 6/32; its 9 1/2% issue at 96 7/8, down 6/32; and its 10%
securities at 99 10/32, down 4/32.</p>
<p>Municipal Issues</p>
<p>Municipal bonds were mixed, with some issues off as much
as 1/4 point in late dealings and others up as much as 1/4.</p>
<p>"People have been burned trying to short it {the market}
down here," so there was a little retail interest, said a New
York municipal bond specialist. Whether that buying interest
will be sustained depends on what effect this week's Treasury
auctions will have on the government bond market, he added.</p>
<p>In light new-issues dealings, a John Nuveen & Co. group
set the preliminary pricing for an issue of $53.7 million
Mississippi Hospital Equipment and Facilities Authority
revenue bonds. The bonds were tentatively priced to yield
from 6.40% in 1991 to 7.62% in 2013.</p>
<p>In secondary action, the New Jersey Turnpike Authority's
7.20% bonds of 2018 finished 1/4 higher at 96 1/4, yielding
7.51%.</p>
<p>Corporate Issues</p>
<p>Corporate issuers trickled back to the new-issue market
and offered $500 million in new debt.</p>
<p>General Motors Acceptance Corp., the financing arm of
General Motors Corp., and Unocal Corp. each tapped the credit
markets, separately offering $250 million of new debt.</p>
<p>In trading, investment-grade corporate issues ended about
1/4 point lower.</p>
<p>In the junk-bond market, prices of TW Holdings Inc. bonds
rose on what analysts said was a relatively positive earnings
report.</p>
<p>TW Holdings, a fast-food restaurant operator, reported a
first-quarter loss of $46.1 million compared with a profit of
$8.3 milion a year earlier, but other numbers were more
encouraging. Sam DeRosa-Farag, an analyst at First Boston
Corp., said TW Holdings' sales increased by 7.6% and its cash
flow by 11%.</p>
<p>TW's 15% 12-year subordinated debentures rose one point to
96 1/2.</p>
<p>By comparison, most other junk bonds, or speculative-grade
securities with low credit ratings or no credit ratings at
all, were unchanged.</p>
