	<p class="article-leader">CARMEL, Calif. -- Landmark Land Co. said the Office of
Thrift Supervision is objecting to its plans for financing
the sale of a major part of its real estate and resort
holdings for nearly $1 billion.
   The move casts doubt upon nearly $500 million in expected
pretax profit from the proposed transaction.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The planned sale of the company's premier golf, tennis and
development properties to California developer Barry G. Hon
for $967 million called for Landmark's Oak Tree Savings Bank
unit to finance the sale.</p>
<p>However, in a supervisory objection letter the agency
expressed "concern we'd have too high a percentage of our
assets, about 20%, tied up in one borrower," said Gerland G.
Barton, Landmark's president. "I'm surprised, since we're
getting about 25% down and we'd have a first mortgage on the
property," Mr. Barton added.</p>
<p>Landmark and Mr. Hon are attempting to restructure the
proposed transaction to address the agency's concerns.</p>
<p>Inability to recast the deal to the agency's satisfaction
would kill the sale, Landmark said, and cancel out an
expected $470 million in pretax profit that would have
resulted from closing the transaction.</p>
<p>Moreover, Landmark said it had hoped the sale would help
it satisfy all capital requirements of the Financial
Institutions Reform, Recovery and Enforcement Act.</p>
<p>Landmark's Mr. Barton said Mr. Hon, the owner of Hon
Development Co., of Laguna Hills, Calif., was seeking
alternative financing for the planned purchase. He "is coming
back with a proposal he anticipates will be acceptable," he
said.</p>
