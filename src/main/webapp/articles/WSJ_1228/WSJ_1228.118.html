	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- It looks as if American Express has found some
more worms in the apple at Shearson Lehman Brothers.
   Nine months ago, James Robinson, chairman of American
Express, signaled "the start of a new era" for the company's
investment bank. American Express shoveled money into
Shearson and, in a major purge of people, bad loans and 1980s
excesses, Shearson wrote off $787 million.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>That was supposed to be the last time that Shearson -- a
longtime drag on American Express stock -- would drain money
from its parent.</p>
<p>But now, analysts say Shearson didn't root out all the
worms. It has almost $10 billion of real estate and other
investments that are causing concern. With real estate in
such a slump, some analysts speculate that Shearson
ultimately will have to write down the value of these assets
by hundreds of millions of dollars, and perhaps take more big
charges to revamp its businesses.</p>
<p>Over time, suggests Neuberger & Berman analyst Mark
Goldstein in a recent internal study for his firm's money
managers and salespeople, "it is conceivable" that Shearson's
doubtful loans could be written down by $300 million to $500
million; an additional $100 million to $200 million "might be
needed to exit or downsize various businesses." Mr.
Goldstein, who couldn't be reached, didn't forecast over how
many quarters the charge-offs might extend. But his study
suggests that to raise money to rebuild Shearson, American
Express might at some point sell 25 million of its own new
shares, which at today's prices would fetch more than $500
million and dilute current holders' stake 5%.</p>
<p>For the fourth quarter just ending, several analysts agree
that Shearson might write off about $50 million. "I'm saying
to clients, the odds favor another big charge-off by Shearson
at year end," says E. Wilson Davis of Gerard Klauer Mattison
in New York. He thinks American Express might get away with
ordering only a $50 million year-end charge at Shearson; if
it delays, he speculates, the damage might be much bigger
next year.</p>
<p>Recently, Mr. Davis downgraded his rating on American
Express stock from "buy" to "hold." The shares had been
rebounding from a 1990 low of 17 1/2 but now seem to have
stalled; they were at 20 5/8, down 3/4, yesterday.</p>
<p>Shearson's "real" equity, excluding intangible items, is
about $600 million. American Express says its securities firm
"has done a fine job, given the tough environment, and will,
from its own operating income, continue to strengthen
reserves when and if called for." Asked whether American
Express might funnel more money into Shearson, a spokesman
said, "we don't speculate on our future financing plans." He
added, "we have a lot of respect for Neuberger but their
{write-off} numbers are a gross exaggeration and well beyond
anything that we consider to be reasonable."</p>
<p>Though Mr. Robinson has done a good job of ordering cost
cuts at Shearson, "there has been a loss of respect for
management" at American Express because of Shearson's
troubles, analyst Davis says. "If we only had a Tom Murphy
running American Express, we'd have an $80 stock," New York
money manager Chris Browne of Tweedy Browne said last fall,
referring to Capital Cities/ABC's highly regarded chief.</p>
<p>Now, Mr. Browne says, "we're not enthusiastic about the
prospect of more write-offs" at Shearson. Still, he has been
buying American Express stock in recent months at prices from
27 to 17, and says, "I wouldn't be buying if I didn't think
it could go up," whatever happens to Shearson.</p>
<p>The new signs of trouble at Shearson come at a time when
American Express's highly prized charge-card business is
losing a little luster: Growth has slowed, competition is
mounting and losses are rising. However, American Express has
raised reserves for charge-card losses and says it is seeing
"a leveling of charge accounts that are moving into the
delinquent category."</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Gerard Klauer's Mr. Davis expects Shearson's
1990 losses to cost American Express about $2 a share in
profit, leaving the parent with 1990 per-share earnings of
$2.24. Even without special charges, Shearson's operations
will probably lose $200 million for the year, he says, with
almost half of the loss falling in the fourth quarter, a
rough time for Wall Street firms.</p>
<p>Shearson isn't the only investment firm with headaches.
Merrill Lynch could write off a $75 million loan in the
fourth quarter, says Salomon Brothers analyst Samuel Liss.</p>
<p>Neuberger & Berman lists some big assets of Shearson and
affiliates that are cause for "concern:" a $1 billion
portfolio of commercial real estate; more than $6 billion of
home equity loans; more than $800 million of merchant banking
investments, including a $500 million loan to shaky Prime
Computer; $600 million of junk bonds and a $158 million First
Capital Holdings stockholding, now valued in the market at
around $20 million.</p>
<p>How come American Express didn't bite more of the bullet
earlier? A spokesman says, "The industry now is confronting a
significantly deteriorated environment."</p>
