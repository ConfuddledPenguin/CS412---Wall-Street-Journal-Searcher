	<p class="article-leader">Trans World Airlines owner Carl Icahn is preparing to make
the ouster of Pan Am Corp. Chairman Thomas Plaskett a new
condition for his planned purchase of Pan Am, sources close
to the talks said.
   Such a condition would hurt chances of a friendly
acquisition.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Mr. Plaskett's exit is understood to be on a laundry list
of stiff conditions that Mr. Icahn hasn't yet sent to Pan Am;
that list could still be altered before delivery. The
financier is angry at Pan Am for its repeated rebuffs of his
buy-out proposals.</p>
<p>A Pan Am spokesman said, "Tom Plaskett would not stand in
the way of any offer that could benefit Pan Am or its
constituents."</p>
<p>Mr. Icahn is proposing to buy Pan Am's 150 million shares
outstanding for $1.50 a share in cash. In addition, the
proposal includes an offer to pay $1 a share in subordinated
notes. The terms of those notes haven't been agreed upon, but
would most likely be valued at much less than $1 a share.</p>
<p>Pan Am has indicated that it is willing to come to terms
on a merger, but that it requires bridge financing to help
carry operations through the next few months. But Mr. Icahn
has indicated he would give Pan Am such funding only if the
airline holding company first files for Chapter 11 bankruptcy
court protection. Pan Am opposes that idea.</p>
<p>Although he wants Mr. Plaskett removed, Mr. Icahn is
understood to favor retaining Pan Am executives such as
Richard Francis, chief financial officer, and Roger Cooke,
general counsel. Under the plan being considered, Mr. Francis
would apparently run the airline. He has been one of the
chief negotiators with Mr. Icahn and his representatives.</p>
<p>Mr. Icahn is understood to lack faith in Mr. Plaskett's
management of Pan Am. The TWA camp notes that Pan Am
currently has so little cash that it's unclear whether the
ailing carrier would even have enough money to operate under
Chapter 11.</p>
<p>Further, in a Christmas Eve letter to Pan Am officials,
Mr. Icahn suggested that Pan Am didn't get the best deal it
could have when it recently agreed to sell desirable
U.S.-London routes for $290 million to UAL Corp.'s United
Airlines.</p>
<p>Industry observers contend any executive changes at Pan Am
would complicate a merger. "The more conditions placed on the
transaction, the more difficult it is to complete," said
Thomas Longman, an airline analyst at Bear, Stearns & Co. in
New York.</p>
<p>Talks between the two airlines have deteriorated in recent
days, in part because of Mr. Icahn's unconventional
negotiating style, which irritates Pan Am executives. For
instance, they were annoyed when he dispatched his three-page
Christmas Eve letter after they'd left for the day, but in
time for wide distribution to the media. Pan Am officials
viewed that maneuver as a publicity stunt.</p>
<p>Professional takeover speculators haven't been interested
in following the TWA/Pan Am merger effort because of the
tenuous nature and conditions of the offer as well as Mr.
Icahn's reputation for protracted haggling during
negotiation.</p>
<p>In composite New York Stock Exchange trading yesterday,
Pan Am shares closed unchanged at $1.375 -- less than the
cash portion of Mr. Icahn's proposal.</p>
<p>Separately, Delta Air Lines said it asked the Department
of Transportation to combine and conduct a hearing on the
international route transfer applications of United and Pan
Am, and of American and TWA. The latter two have also asked
that the cases be consolidated.</p>
<p>A department spokesman said officials would review the
request. But the department may be unwilling to combine the
cases because that would likely slow down the United-Pan Am
deal. With Pan Am on the ropes financially, its officials
want their transaction completed as soon as possible. The
DOT, in reviewing international route sales, isn't required
to conduct hearings; it just must give interested parties
adequate time to comment.</p>
<p>Delta said it argued a hearing is necessary to weigh
possible adverse impacts on the industry's competitive
balance. "Delta does not oppose route transfer transactions
in principle," Ronald W. Allen, chairman and chief executive
maintained. "These particular transactions, however, are so
massive that they raise fundamental policy issues affecting
competition and market structure internationally and
domestically." He contended the transfers could create what
he dubbed "a duopoly across the Atlantic," in which the two
largest U.S. airlines would control two-thirds of the nonstop
U.S.-London routes.</p>
