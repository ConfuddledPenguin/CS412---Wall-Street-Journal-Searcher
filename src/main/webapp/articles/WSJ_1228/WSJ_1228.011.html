	<p class="article-leader">BALTIMORE -- The National Aquarium in Baltimore on
Wednesday unveiled a $35 million belated Christmas gift: a
spectacular new home for its expanded collection of six
Atlantic bottlenose dolphins and three beluga whales.
   But not everyone is celebrating.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Animal-protection groups are expressing opinions ranging
from qualms to downright anger over what they see as the new
facility's emphasis on glitz and entertainment rather than
education. And some are wondering whether it is proper to
keep marine mammals -- which are thought to be highly
intelligent -- in captivity at all. A small group of
picketers was on hand at the opening; the demonstrators said
the protests will continue.</p>
<p>"Baltimore is a microcosm for a lot of the issues about
{whales and dolphins in} captivity," says Nancy Daves of the
Animal Protection Institute, based in Sacramento, Calif. The
result is increasing tensions between two groups --
supporters of aquariums and animal preservationists -- who
might otherwise have been expected to make common cause.</p>
<p>Aquarium officials say the new facility -- which has a
circular tank 110 feet wide and 24 feet deep, surrounded by a
1,300-seat amphitheater and multimedia screens -- will
educate the public about how these animals behave in the wild
and the increasing dangers they face from man. "We were
incomplete in showing {visitors} the world of water," says
Nicholas Brown, the aquarium's executive director.</p>
<p>Currently, three of the dolphins -- the rest of the
animals will join the show sometime in 1991 -- are featured
in presentations showcasing such abilities as tailwalking and
communication skills.</p>
<p>Aquarium professionals praise the facility. "I've seen
quite a few dolphin demonstrations but this was one of the
best I've seen," says David Jenkins, deputy director of the
American Association of Zoological Parks and Aquariums. "I
think you are going to see people come away from the program
who will have a keener appreciation of the dolphin and whale
but also a keener appreciation of what to do to save the
marine environment in general."</p>
<p>But Ben White of the Sea Shepherd Society, an
environmental-activist group, says, "These centers are
educational in entirely the wrong way. I don't buy the
argument that people who see captive whales and dolphins come
away as defenders of them."</p>
<p>Paula Jewell, an official with the Humane Society of the
U.S., says, "I have mixed feelings about the show. I thought
it had the potential to be educationally useful . . . but the
Humane Society is always opposed to frivolous, entertaining
routines."</p>
<p>Adding to critics' unhappiness is the fact that
Baltimore's aquarium doesn't have the best track record with
marine mammals. One of its four original bottlenose dolphins
died in the aquarium's first year and the others had to be
evacuated after developing ulcers attributed to the stressful
environment. A guest dolphin died soon after visiting in 1984
and a beluga whale contracted a fatal bacterial infection in
1989.</p>
<p>In a textbook case of bad public relations, the aquarium
captured two dolphins off the Florida coast last year without
obtaining proper paperwork from that state. Despite intense
pressure, the aquarium held on to the animals: One died
within months of its capture, while the other has yet to be
removed from Florida.</p>
<p>Mr. Brown says his institution has learned from past
mistakes. For example, the original dolphins were bothered by
the noise of the aquarium. Now, the tank walls are
soundproofed and the pumps and filtration system are isolated
from the exhibit so that the animals won't be bothered by
vibrations.</p>
<p>But those changes haven't silenced critics. Many wonder
how the animals will do in a still tank that is 110 feet
wide, when they normally range over hundreds of miles of
ocean. All of Baltimore's dolphins and whales were born in
the wild, a situation that's distressing many involved with
animal protection.</p>
<p>People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals, an
animal-rights group, has already sponsored a protest at the
aquarium, and more may be coming. "We have a problem with
aquariums in general . . . they amount to prisons for free
roaming animals," explains a spokeswoman.</p>
<p>Aquarium supporters say holding some marine mammals in
captivity is vital to the survival of their brethren in the
wild. "A lot of the political support for protecting these
animals comes from the direct experience the public has of
seeing them," says Peter Tyack, associate scientist with the
Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution.</p>
