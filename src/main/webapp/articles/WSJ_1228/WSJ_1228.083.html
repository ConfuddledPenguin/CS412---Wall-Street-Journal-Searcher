	<p class="article-leader">If you think your year's been tough, consider what it'd be
like to be in charge of a really big mess, say, a major U.S.
city or state. Consider these headlines, all of which
appeared yesterday morning: "Nation's Capital Faces Financial
Disaster"; "Criticizing Dinkins, Cuomo Warns of Possible
Takeover of Finances"; "Fresh Bipartisan Effort to Be Sought
to Close Big California Budget Gap."
   In America, modern government means big government. And at
every level, governments are beginning to fall apart under
the weight of their own self-created "responsibilities."
They're just too fat. Alas, Slim-Fast won't save them. Ask
Philadelphia.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>By Philadelphia Mayor Wilson Goode's own admission his
city is "probably only a year or two ahead of other major
cities." Last week, he reported Philadelphia can't meet its
January 4 payroll without help.</p>
<p>While Philadelphia's officials scream they are on the edge
of bankruptcy, they balk at the terms of a $150 million loan
offered by eight banks: Cut spending, raise fees, sell
assets, privatize services and give budget veto power to a
fiscal oversight board. If in fact unending politicking has
made tough decisions impossible today, bankruptcy might well
be the best thing that could happen to a Philadelphia or
other cities in fiscal trouble.</p>
<p>Philadelphia's officials have ducked reality for years.
Since 1987, the city has run an annual deficit, which it
covered with short-term loans. That avenue is blocked now
that investors fear the city could default on its bonds.</p>
<p>The city claims its fiscal woes are the result of
decreased federal aid and mandated programs that have
burdened the city. But the main factor is its responsibility:
labor costs. They account for well over half its budget. In
1987, the average city employee was paid $45,500 in wages and
benefits, 51% more than the average employee in the
metropolitan area and 66% more than the state average. Under
current contracts, a new city employee is entitled to 47 paid
days off his first year on the job. Philadelphia also has
more municipal employees than other major cities, 197 per
10,000 population compared with Pittsburgh's 153 and
Chicago's 137.</p>
<p>City officials privately agree their labor costs are
outrageous, but say that union contracts tie their hands (a
refrain heard elsewhere). They certainly have perpetuated the
shoddy delivery of local services. In 1988, two private
companies offered to collect the city's garbage on time and
save $80 million a year, or half the existing costs. They
backed up their offer with $1 million performance bonds, but
the idea was shot down by the municipal unions.</p>
<p>Lacking the courage to make needed reforms in America's
major cities, politicians commonly react to budget shortfalls
by cutting essential services first and using the expected
public uproar to raise taxes, further damaging the economy.
It may be that only drastic action will end this cycle of
tax-and-spend binging. Luckily, there is a model on how to
clean up a wasteful and inefficient city government.</p>
<p>In 1986, Ecorse, Michigan, a working-class community of
11,000 near Detroit, was $6 million in debt and in violation
of court orders to balance its budget. A judge then placed
Ecorse in receivership, and gave Louis Schimmel, a municipal
bond expert, wide-ranging powers to clean up the city,
unhindered by politicians.</p>
<p>Today, the deficit has disappeared, a model city has been
created and this year Ecorse was turned back to local
control. Mr. Schimmel's methods? "To privatize just about
everything," he says. In four years, he held the line on
taxes, cut the municipal work force almost in half and hired
private firms to handle most services. Excluding police, fire
and elected officials there are now only 18 city employees.</p>
<p>Former mayor Larry Salisbury doesn't like everything Mr.
Schimmel did, but thinks much of it was necessary. "It was
painful, but we're getting our money's worth now," he says.
Outgoing State Treasurer Robert Bowman, a Democrat, also
approves of the Schimmel Solution: "The political will to
balance the budget wasn't there. Lou Schimmel did the
heavy-lifting that was required." He says the Ecorse
experience led to a new state law giving citizens the right
to petition the state government to audit a city's books.</p>
<p>Mr. Schimmel is unsure how many of his reforms could be
implemented in Philadelphia, but he firmly believes municipal
bankruptcy can be an option for a city that won't control its
spending appetites. "Basic services don't stop," he says.
"They are restructured." Municipal attorneys tell us Chapter
9 of the bankruptcy law might be the only way to give
Philadelphia the power to renegotiate its bloated labor union
contracts.</p>
<p>Putting a city into receivership isn't the end of the
world that local officials claim it would be. It may mean the
end of their world of ever-expanding budgets and
unaccountable government, however. If New York City had
bitten the bullet 15 years ago, and gone through a really
fundamental restructuring, it wouldn't be facing its current
fiscal nightmare. Perhaps its time the residents of New York
and other cities began thinking about putting a Lou Schimmel
into the picture, before the Philadelphia Story becomes their
story.</p>
