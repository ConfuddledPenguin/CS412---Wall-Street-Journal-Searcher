	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- Three brands of dental adhesive contain
unacceptable levels of benzene, according to the Food and
Drug Administration.
   The three products are Orafix Special and Brace, made by
Norcliff Thayer, a Philadelphia unit of Britain's SmithKline
Beecham PLC, and Cushion Grip, made by Schering-Plough
HealthCare Products, a unit of Schering-Plough Corp.,
Madison, N.J.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>All three products will be voluntarily recalled by their
manufacturers, the FDA said in a statement released late
yesterday. Meanwhile, the agency is urging consumers not to
use the dental adhesives until the manufacturers resume
manufacturing them without benzene.</p>
<p>Although benzene causes cancer when ingested in large
amounts, James Benson, FDA deputy commissioner said, "We
don't see this as a significant health issue at this point."
But he added that "any time you have something that's a known
or potential carcinogen you want to get rid of it."</p>
<p>While SmithKline called the levels of benzene
contamination "minute" and "measured in parts per million,"
it was sufficient to warrant an immediate recall.</p>
<p>A spokesman for Schering-Plough said that the company
"believes the trace concentrations do not pose a health
hazard." But he said the company would cooperate with the FDA
to revise the manufacturing process.</p>
<p>The amount of benzene found in the three dental adhesive
products exceeds levels that were found by the FDA in Perrier
earlier this year. The result was a highly publicized recall
of Perrier by its French manufacturer, Source Perrier S.A.
Perrier returned to grocery shelves this past July after the
company altered its production process.</p>
<p>The FDA also found low levels of benzene in Fasteeth and
Fixodent, two dental adhesive products manufactured by
Richardson-Vicks Inc., Shelton, Conn., and said that it would
work with the company to reformulate them. But the agency
said the benzene level in these products didn't pose a
significant health risk, noting that most people consume more
benzene daily in their drinking water. A company spokesman
couldn't be reached for comment.</p>
