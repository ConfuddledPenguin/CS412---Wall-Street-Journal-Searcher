	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Consumer confidence in December remained
virtually unchanged from November but still much lower than a
year ago, as concerns about the economy and the Middle East
persist, according to the Conference Board, an independent
business research organization.
   Meanwhile, help-wanted advertising volume reached a
five-year low in November, the board said, as its seasonally
adjusted help-wanted ad index fell eight points.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The Conference Board's Consumer Confidence Index stood at
61.3 in December, slightly lower than a revised 61.7 for
November. The results of a nationwide survey of consumers
show that Americans are more worried today than they were a
month ago about economic conditions. And confidence has
plummeted compared with a year ago when the index registered
above 113.</p>
<p>The biggest single monthly drop came in October during the
U.S. budget debate, when the confidence index fell to 62.6
from 85.6 in September. Since then, the index has been
hovering in the low 60s. The index uses 1985 as a base year
of 100.</p>
<p>"Consumers' continuing disenchantment with prevailing
business conditions and their low expectations for the
immediate future reflect the increasingly soft economy," says
Fabian Linden, executive director of the board's Consumer
Research Center.</p>
<p>The employment situation clearly remains a big worry.
About 33% of those surveyed complained that jobs are "hard to
get," up from 29% in November. Looking ahead, 34% expect few
jobs to be available over the next six months, while only 10%
expect there to be more jobs. On the other hand, only 26%
said they expect business conditions to worsen, down from
about 30% last month.</p>
<p>Concern about jobs, along with expectations for little or
no real personal income growth, is prompting many consumers
to keep their hands on their wallets. In the December survey,
only 5.9% said they intend to purchase a car, down from 6.5%
last month. In December 1989, over 7% said they planned to
buy a car. Home-buying interest is also weak at 2.6%. And
many consumers are shelving plans for a vacation. Less than
47% of those surveyed said they plan to take a vacation in
the next six months, down from more than 52% a year ago.</p>
<p>The index is based on a survey of 5,000 households across
the U.S. conducted for the Conference Board by National
Family Opinion Inc. of Toledo, Ohio. The decline in
help-wanted advertising reflects the fact that "the labor
market has been weakening for the last six months, and it may
be another six months before it turns around," said Ken
Goldstein, the Conference Board's economist. The nation's
unemployment rose to 5.9% in November, from 5.7% in October.
The rate stood at 5.3% a year ago.</p>
<p>But he said help-wanted volume is unlikely to fall another
20% over the next six months, as it has done over the
previous six months. The index, which fell last month to 108
from 116 in October, is currently 37 points below the
year-ago level of 145. The index uses 1967 as a base year of
100.</p>
<p>Help-wanted advertising volume declined in all nine major
regions of the country, particularly in the Pacific, where it
fell 10.8%. The East North Central and Middle Atlantic
regions followed, recording drops of 8.1% and 7.4%
respectively. The Conference Board said the best news is that
labor conditions in the West South Central oil patch, held up
better than anywhere else in the country.</p>
<p>Mr. Goldstein said the downward trend that began in the
Northeast more than a year ago has spread to the South
Atlantic, Pacific, and more recently into the Midwestern
regions. Still, he expects signs of improvement in labor
market conditions soon.</p>
<p>The survey measures help-wanted ad volume in 51 major
newspapers in the nation.</p>
