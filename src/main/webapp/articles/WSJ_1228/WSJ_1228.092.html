	<p class="article-leader">At its first meeting of shareholders yesterday, Alliance
New Europe Fund Inc., New York, postponed until early next
year a final vote on whether to convert to an open-end
investment company from a closed-end fund.
   A closed-end fund has a fixed number of shares that trade
either at a discount or premium to the value of its assets.
An open-end fund issues shares continuously based on investor
demand, and redeems the shares directly from investors who
want to sell.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The meeting was adjourned until Jan. 10 to allow more time
to receive proxies from shareholders, the company said.
Management's open-end fund proposal requires the support of
75% or more of the shares outstanding for approval. At the
meeting, David H. Dievler, chairman, said 65% of the fund's
shares had voted, and of those, 62% favored converting to an
openend investment company.</p>
