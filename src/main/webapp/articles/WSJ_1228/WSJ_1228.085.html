	<p class="article-leader">BOSTON -- Massachusetts adopted stringent auto-emission
standards modeled after recently enacted California rules,
making it the second state to clamp down harder on
car-related smog than the new federal clean-air legislation
does.
   Environmentalists, who have criticized the new federal
emissions rules as too weak, hailed Massachusetts' move as
the beginning of a trend that eventually may force the auto
industry to meet the California standards nationwide. "We
hope to create a domino effect," said Jenny Carter, an
attorney with the Massachusetts Public Interest Research
Group, an offshoot of Ralph Nader's lobbying organizations.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The Massachusetts law, to be phased in from 1995 to 2003,
requires auto makers to cut new vehicles' hydrocarbon
emissions to levels 75% lower than those set by the new
federal law. It requires emission levels of other major smog
ingredients, nitrogen oxides, to be 50% lower than required
under the new federal standards. The Massachusetts law also
copies California's provisions that require auto makers to
continually test air-pollution control systems in randomly
selected vehicles they've previously sold and to correct
failures.</p>
<p>Massachusetts' adoption of the California standards
"increases the momentum dramatically" among Northeast states
to adopt similar rules, said Michael Bradley, executive
director of the Northeast States for Coordinated Air Use
Management, or NESCAUM, an eight-state group that coordinates
regional efforts to cut air pollution. He added that Maine
and Rhode Island "are close to proposing similar
regulations." Illinois, Texas, Maryland, Pennsylvania,
Wisconsin, Colorado, Washington and Oregon also "have
expressed interest in" the California standards, he said.</p>
<p>"At some point, it will simply be easier for car
manufacturers to make the better car for all 50 states," said
Massachusetts state Rep. David Cohen, co-sponsor of the new
law.</p>
<p>The auto industry lobbied hard against the Massachusetts'
law, arguing that it will increase car sticker prices by $500
or more. "There's no free lunch," said Thomas Joyce, a Boston
attorney representing the Motor Vehicle Manufacturers
Association.</p>
<p>But supporters of the new law estimate the improved
pollution-control devices it requires will add only $100 to
$300 to a new car's price. "Given the industry's unfulfilled
doomsday predictions about earlier emissions standards, its
credibility is sorely lacking" in predictions of fallout from
the new standards, said Mr. Cohen.</p>
<p>Supporters of the Massachusetts law asserted that it
represents the cheapest way to meet air-pollution standards
mandated by the new federal law. To attain the pollution cuts
expected under the auto-emission standards by lowering
smokestack emissions instead is estimated to cost as much as
five times what the auto standards will cost, said NESCAUM's
Mr. Bradley.</p>
