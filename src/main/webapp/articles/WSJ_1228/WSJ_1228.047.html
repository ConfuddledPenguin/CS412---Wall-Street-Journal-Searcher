	<p class="article-leader">Jeffrey Tannenbaum's article (Leisure & Arts, Nov. 21)
makes us wish we would be on hand in Lyons for the great
Kasparov-Karpov war. But then, upon reflection, we all know
this is just another run-of-the-mill chess championship,
despite all the media hype. Now a real titanic struggle, I
submit, was seen in 1834 between Frenchman La Bourdonnais and
Englishman A. McDonnell.
   What a shame that you did not have a reporter on hand back
then. The Frenchman never stopped talking, swearing and
joking about in his games, while McDonnell apparently was
dullness incarnate as he took up to 90 minutes on a single
move. He learned to utterly ignore the antics of his opponent
as he planned strategies, sometimes involving queen
sacrifices of a kind that Kasparov would admire.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>I look forward to Mr. Tannenbaum's next article, when he
puts the two Russian Ks in perspective. (Oh, by the way, La
Bourdonnais was the victor with 45 wins, 27 losses and 13
draws])</p>
