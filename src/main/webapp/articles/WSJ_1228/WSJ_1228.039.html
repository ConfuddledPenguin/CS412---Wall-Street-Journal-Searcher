	<p class="article-leader">BURBANK, Calif. -- Walt Disney Co. said it hired a top New
York-based magazine executive as part of a larger push into
publishing magazines and comics.
   John Skipper, who had been president and publishing
director of Spin magazine, has been named vice president of
magazine publishing at Disney Publishing, a unit of Disney.
Mr. Skipper, before joining Spin last year, was a top
executive for 10 years at Straight Arrow Publishers Inc.'s US
and Rolling Stone magazines.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>At Disney, Mr. Skipper is expected to help develop
products for a growing line of Disney publications. Disney
became a publisher only in recent years, and has developed or
licensed publications based largely on its cartoon
characters.</p>
<p>Mr. Skipper will oversee the recently launched Disney
Adventures, a digest-sized monthly magazine for children
seven to 14 years old. He also will oversee Disney's domestic
magazine licensing activity, including the Mickey Mouse
magazine, which is published by Welsh Publishing Group Inc.</p>
