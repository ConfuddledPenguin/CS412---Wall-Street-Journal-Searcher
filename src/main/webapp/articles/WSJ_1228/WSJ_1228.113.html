	<p class="article-leader">Southern Co. said its subsidiaries have completed
negotiating an agreement with Gulf States Utilities Co. over
disputed contracts for the sale of power.
   The agreement, if approved by the companies' boards, the
Federal Energy Regulatory Commission and others, will
terminate litigation that began in July 1986 when Gulf States
asked Southern Co. to renegotiate contracts to buy
approximately $1 billion in electricity from Southern Co.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The agreement calls for Gulf States, of Beaumont, Texas,
to give Southern Co., of Atlanta, as much as $300 million in
cash, common stock and deferred payments. In a refinement of
the initial agreement, Gulf States agreed to pay a penalty to
Southern Co. unless the price of Gulf States stock reaches
$18.25 a share for five consecutive days before Jan. 1, 1993.
In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, Gulf
States stock closed at $10.125 a share, down 12.5 cents.</p>
<p>Southern Co. said it agreed to exercise voting rights on
Gulf States stock only "in very limited circumstances."</p>
