	<p class="article-leader">Making his way uncertainly across the red carpet, King
Fahd of Saudi Arabia clutched hands with the aged emir of Abu
Dhabi. A retainer eased the frail sheik of Kuwait into a
plush leather armchair. As monarchs and ministers gathered
last weekend for a Persian Gulf parley, all had the hurt air
of men who had learned the hard lesson: Money can't buy you
love.
   Perched atop 40% of the world's oil, the Gulf sheikdoms
have long tried to purchase the loyalty of dangerous
neighbors, of imported Arab laborers and of their own
subjects. Saddam Hussein's tanks took three hours to shatter
this "riyal-politik". Now, however the crisis ends, Gulf
leaders face tasks that once seemed distant, even
unthinkable: sharing power with their people, providing their
own defense and realigning their ties with the Arab world.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"Saddam has exploded our fantasy culture," says a senior
Gulf official, seated in a palace of marbled halls and
Persian carpets. "A wealthy island in a sea of poverty cannot
live securely forever."</p>
<p>The future of these fragile oligarchies carries high
stakes for America as well. Although gradual liberalization
in the Gulf seems likely, there also are rumblings of a
fundamentalist backlash. Gulf leaders could kick sand in
America's face by making up with Arab radicals and with Iran.
And unless the Gulf mobilizes its defenses, the West may be
doomed to fight this region's battles indefinitely.</p>
<p>An Egyptian diplomat, Tahseen Basheer, once derided other
Arab states as merely "tribes with flags." Nowhere did the
insult cut deeper than in the principalities of the Persian
Gulf. Just a generation ago, this region was the Arabs'
Appalachia -- isolated, indigent and clannish.</p>
<p>In 1948, when Edward Henderson arrived in Abu Dhabi to
negotiate the first oil concessions, the ruling sheik lived
in a mud fort cut with arrow slits. "In those days, there
wasn't much to defend," says the Englishman, now an archivist
in Abu Dhabi. "The biggest pane of glass in the sheikdom was
the windscreen of my car." The mud fort still stands, dwarfed
by glittering towers of steel and glass.</p>
<p>But although oil has catapulted the Gulf states into the
20th century, they remain insular societies wary of change
and of one another. Before 1960, Kuwait, Bahrain, Qatar and
the United Arab Emirates didn't exist as independent nations.
Geographically, they are pimples on Saudi Arabia's vast
desert backside, and they fear domination by a Saudi regime
viewed as overbearing and religiously fanatical. The sixth
state, Oman, which once was a seafaring power with colonies
in Pakistan and Zanzibar, keeps its distance and its distinct
identity.</p>
<p>These fractious states are nonetheless kin, united by the
oil beneath their sands and by their hereditary, dictatorial
rule. The United Arab Emirates phonebook offers a window into
this feudal but intimate leadership. It opens with a section
labeled "The Shaikhs," including listings for their beach
palaces, shooting ranges and, in some cases, palace bedrooms.
The government pages that follow look almost like an
afterthought; the same names appear at the head of most major
ministries.</p>
<p>Ironically, it is Saddam Hussein, a far more ruthless
tyrant than any of the Gulf sheiks, who is nudging them
toward democracy. One Saudi regional governor, a brother of
King Fahd, used to end debates with his subjects by barking,
"My family took this country by the sword]" He isn't likely
to say that anymore.</p>
<p>Comments one Saudi businessman: "He knows we can answer,
`Yeah? Well, now George Bush has taken it by the sword, so
your family is no better than us and you better start dealing
with us.'"</p>
<p>Kuwait's resilience in exile also has shown the importance
of popular support. If Kuwaitis hadn't stood by their deposed
emir, who now has promised democratic reforms, the tiny
nation might well have vanished quickly.</p>
<p>The crisis has accelerated demand for open information,
too. In Saudi Arabia, despite censorship so intense that
newspaper crossword puzzles are edited to delete references
to alcohol, Western influences get through. Cable News
Network isn't permitted outside princes' palaces, but some
citizens hide satellite dishes inside rooftop "water tanks."
Many Saudis also watch Bahraini TV, which recently began
broadcasting CNN, including uncensored reports on Israel, for
an hour a night.</p>
<p>"There was pressure before to keep such things off the
air," says Bahrain's information minister, Tariq al-Moayed.
"But people are asking questions that have to be answered.
There is no going back."</p>
<p>The way forward, though, is uncertain. Though denying
their citizens political rights, Gulf leaders have given
almost everyone a stake in the status quo, with free
education, medicine and generous subsidies. The huge numbers
of young people who study abroad almost invariably return
home -- in a sharp contrast to most other Arab states.</p>
<p>The richest Gulf capitals, such as Abu Dhabi, are
luxurious playgrounds, their causeways busy with white-robed
men in white Mercedes-Benzes, talking to each other on car
phones. A conversation among United Arab Emirates
businessmen, over a lobster-claw dinner, quickly turns from
the Gulf crisis to a debate over whether one man should give
his son $15,000 to enter a jet-ski competition.</p>
<p>"People are too immersed in the Dolce Vita to want to risk
losing it," says Aly Mahmoud, a veteran Egyptian journalist.</p>
<p>In Jidda, a young manufacturer felt inspired by the Gulf
crisis to pen a newspaper article calling for more freedom.
"But I'm writing," he recalls, "and my hand starts shaking,
and I think, `Are they going to take my factory away?'"</p>
<p>With no real unions, political parties or freedom of the
press, Gulf citizens have few means of expressing dissent --
short of demonstrations, which are anathema in close-knit
societies averse to public conflict. When some Saudi women
recently drove through Riyadh to protest an unofficial ban on
women driving, the reaction was vicious. The Saudis
formalized the ban and tolerated the circulation of pamphlets
inciting harassment of the women and their husbands. Nor has
the state quelled rising militancy among the religious
police, who recently broke into private homes to arrest
people drinking alcohol.</p>
<p>Such actions have raised fears that a fundamentalist
backlash could spill across the region. "I'm more afraid of
the Saudis than I am of the Iraqis," says a senior official
in a neighboring state. "You can always turn from Western
values to more Islam, but it's very hard to turn the clock
back the other way."</p>
<p>Any change will almost certainly filter down from the top.
But Gulf leaders don't seem ready for more than tentative
steps, such as vague promises in several states to set up
"advisory councils."</p>
<p>"It is naive to apply here what you apply elsewhere," says
Sheik Mohamed Bin Mubarak Al-Khalifa, Bahrain's foreign
minister. "The Gulf is not Scandinavia." Like officials
across the region, he says change must be slow and conform to
the conservative, tribal nature of Gulf society. Officials
also say the current crisis, like the Iran-Iraq war, is no
time to talk about destabilizing moves.</p>
<p>But such arguments are dismissed by those wanting change.
"Why should people here be less able to adopt democracy than
elsewhere?" asks Abdulnabi Al Sho'ala, a prominent Bahraini
businessman. "We don't need to reinvent the wheel."</p>
<p>One thing the Gulf probably should reinvent is its proud
military tradition. It was from the Arabian peninsula that
Mohammed's horsemen charged forth. Here, too, Lawrence of
Arabia found his best allies against Ottoman domination.</p>
<p>But urbanization and wealth have eroded the military
ethic. Though often blaming their weakness on sparse
population, the Gulf states combined have a native population
almost equal to Iraq's and three times Israel's. Yet rather
than mobilize this manpower, most Gulf leaders have opted for
fancy weapons as well as for mercenaries from neighboring
states.</p>
<p>Politics aggravates the problem. Shia Muslims, distrusted
by their Sunni Muslim governments, often are excluded from
the army. Saudi Arabia, a nation of more than 10 million
people, keeps two competing armed forces numbering less than
70,000 each; it fears that a strong military could stage a
coup. Asked in November whether more young Saudis should join
the armed forces, the interior minister, Prince Naif, said
they could serve their nation in many other ways as well.</p>
<p>The swift arrival of almost 500,000 foreign troops since
Aug. 2 also has made native armies seem superfluous. "You
think I want to send my teen-aged son to die for Kuwait?"
asks a senior Gulf official. He chuckles and adds, "We have
our white slaves from America to do that."</p>
<p>Relying on foreigners, though, is potentially explosive in
a region only recently freed from colonial rule. When, in
1980, Oman quietly entered an agreement with the U.S. that
allowed the pre-positioning of equipment and access to
airstrips, it was harshly attacked by other Arab states --
with Kuwait among the most vocal. And America's support of
Israel makes a U.S. presence especially sensitive. In Riyadh,
a young student named Maha regales a Western guest with the
latest "news" of Israeli atrocities: An American AIDS victim
in Cairo, she says, has been recruited by Israeli agents to
molest and infect Egyptian children.</p>
<p>Maha also believes that Americans are in Saudi Arabia only
to help Israel destroy Iraq -- a common theme on cassettes
circulating in the kingdom. "It is not the world against
Iraq, it is the West against Islam," Safar al-Hawali, an
Islamic scholar in Mecca, recently declared.</p>
<p>To deflect such criticism, most Gulf states are making a
show of beefing up their defenses. In the United Arab
Emirates, 70,000 men have volunteered for basic training, and
the first batch of female troops now is being trained by U.S.
servicewomen. The state also is filling the airwaves with
images of camouflaged soldiers and caftaned Bedouins marching
heroically across the sand.</p>
<p>"There is some guilt, having other people do our work and
defend us," says Abdul Majeed Al Fahimi, a 29-year-old banker
who recently volunteered for desert training. "I never
thought the time would come when I might need to fight, too."</p>
<p>But Gulf forces, with the possible exception of Oman's,
still are a long way from providing effective defense. In the
short term, ties to the U.S. and to regional allies such as
Egypt are sure to increase. At last weekend's summit in
Qatar, Kuwait hinted that it wants a U.S.-led force in the
region for at least five years.</p>
<p>The Gulf's feeble defense is a symptom of a much broader
disease: regional disunity. The few times Gulf states have
deployed forces have been to fight each other. In 1986, Qatar
landed troops and took hostages on a disputed coral island to
prevent Bahrain from building a naval station there. In the
United Arab Emirates, a shaky confederation of seven
sheikdoms, the emirate of Dubai retains its own army and
moved tanks to the Abu Dhabi border when tension flared in
1987. Five of the emirates have built their own international
airports -- in an area smaller than Maine. A sixth is under
construction.</p>
<p>Such feuding has repeatedly undercut the six-member Gulf
Cooperation Council, or GCC. Formed in 1981, the council has
drawn up bold plans for integration, only to have them
flouted in practice. "Our airlines can't even coordinate
their schedules," says a Saudi GCC official, who adds that it
can take two days to get from Riyadh to Muscat, the Omani
capital. The GCC had its own rapid-deployment force,
"Peninsula Shield," before the American-led "Desert Shield"
arrived, but it proved so impotent that local wags call the
GCC the "Gulf Capitulation Council."</p>
<p>Although Iraq's aggression may scare the Gulf states into
putting aside petty jealousies, it also has exacerbated old
tensions. Oman, long the odd man out in the GCC, annoyed its
neighbors in November by welcoming Iraq's foreign minister
and also by holding a lavish, nine-day celebration of its
national day. Dubai, well out of Iraqi missile range and
desperate to distance itself from the conflict, issues
reports about business unaffected by "the upper Gulf
situation." And the Kuwaiti refugees flooding into
neighboring states have stirred up their traditional
unpopularity. "The Kuwaitis are too big for their robes," one
Gulf official says. "They had all that money, and still they
couldn't defend themselves."</p>
<p>One area where the Gulf states do seem united is in their
changed relations with outside states. Nothing shows the
volatility of the region's alliances more clearly than the
rehabilitation of Iran and the excommunication of the
Palestine Liberation Organization. Iran's ambassador to Qatar
was invited to some GCC summit sessions last weekend, and
delegates said Iran would be included in any new regional
security plans. Bahrain's foreign minister recently visited
Tehran for the first time in 10 years, and regular freight
traffic between the countries is due to start soon.</p>
<p>Such actions would have been impossible before the death
last year of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, who used to call
the Gulf rulers "puppets of the Great Satan." During the
Iraq-Iran war, Tehran was implicated in a coup attempt in
Bahrain and in bombings in Kuwait. It also has boycotted the
annual haj pilgrimage ever since a shootout between Saudi
forces and militant Iranian demonstrators in 1987.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, old allies, bankrolled for decades by the Gulf
states, are falling by the wayside. Customs officials in
Saudi Arabia now seize biographies of PLO Chairman Yasser
Arafat; the man himself is "persona non grata" in most Gulf
states. And what was once the PLO's largest source of funding
has dried up. "As far as the PLO is concerned," a Saudi
official says, "the check is in the mail."</p>
<p>Traditional bows to the Palestinian cause have become
rarer. Gulf journalists say articles on the intifada occupy
only about 20% of the news space they did before Aug. 2. On a
recent day, the only Palestinian item in the Gulf News, which
is based in the United Arab Emirates, was a small story deep
inside the paper, wedged between local reports headlined
"Sleeping Drunk Arrested" and "Two Hurt as Car Rams Camel."</p>
<p>Several Gulf states have expelled Palestinian workers or
failed to renew their visas. Jordanians, Yemenis and Sudanese
also are being nudged out, and the rifts with their
governments may linger on for some time. Gulf leaders now say
that instead of pouring money into the pockets of neighboring
rulers, they will direct their aid straight to projects
aiding the people.</p>
<p>Many officials also speak openly about changing the PLO
leadership. "You don't spit on the hand that is held out to
you. This is what Arafat did," says Yahya Al-Sumait, Kuwait's
minister for housing. "In my view, his turn is finished.
There are many more highly educated, motivated, couth
Palestinians than Arafat."</p>
<p>Arab leaders, though, have a tradition of kissing and
making up after breaches that seem irreparable. And the
Gulf's growing closeness to the U.S. will probably force its
leaders to reaffirm their Arab credentials. "Externally, we
have to avoid reacting `To hell with Palestinians, to hell
with Iraqis,' or we'll wake up and realize we've stranded
ourselves on a desert island," says Sulaiman Al-Mutawa,
Kuwait's minister of planning. Gulf leaders also will want to
avoid alienating radical Arabs lest the Gulf become a target
of terrorism.</p>
<p>Mr. Al-Mutawa, like the rest of Kuwait's government, now
works out of a Saudi hotel room hastily converted into an
office. The Kuwaitis, in exile, have been forced to think
deeply about their future and about the regional arrangements
that failed them abysmally.</p>
<p>Likening the Gulf to the Soviet Union, Mr. Al-Mutawa says
change will inevitably be costly: "There will be heads that
have to be chopped. But in the long run, it will be to the
benefit of the area."</p>
