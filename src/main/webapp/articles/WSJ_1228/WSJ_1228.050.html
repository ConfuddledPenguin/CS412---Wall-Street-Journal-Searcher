	<p class="article-leader">LOS ANGELES -- As the going gets tougher in Southern
California, retailers are betting big that the tough still
will go shopping.
   Amid a nationwide economic slowdown, a retailing shakeout
and a commercial real estate bust, Southern California is
experiencing its greatest influx of merchants in a decade.
Retailers ranging from Wal-Mart Stores Inc. to upscale
Barneys New York are sticking with long-range plans to plunge
into one of the nation's most competitive consumer markets.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"If you look closely at California and the individual
sectors in the retail industry, you see possibilities for
growth because it isn't homogeneous," says Sarah A. Stack, a
retail analyst for Bateman Eichler, Hill Richards Inc. Still,
she says, the influx of hungry competitors will realign the
shopping scene here to the detriment of mass merchants and
other weak players.</p>
<p>The lure of the area is compelling. Los Angeles County is
the nation's largest single retail market, with 1989 sales of
$63.2 billion vs. $46.6 billion for the New York metropolitan
area. The broader five-county Los Angeles region rang up
$104.6 billion in 1989 sales, U.S. Department of Commerce
data show. Furthermore, retail real estate isn't going
begging the way it is elsewhere. Experts estimate Southern
California has about 5% excess retail space; by contrast,
Denver has nearly 40% excess capacity.</p>
<p>Blockbuster Entertainment Corp., Fort Lauderdale, Fla.,
the nation's biggest video-rental chain, has swept into the
entertainment industry Mecca with 85 outlets, and plans to
open at least 50 more in the area as part of a 400-store
expansion next year. Blockbuster's huge stores offer
thousands more movie titles than most competitors.</p>
<p>Blockbuster, like others in its industry, faces high real
estate costs and a plethora of small competitors, not to
mention the problems of a sinking economy. But Scott A. Beck,
vice chairman and chief operating officer, points out that
the video-rental business remains strong, and sometimes even
accelerates, in tough times.</p>
<p>Another retailer that is moving ahead with expansion is
Barneys New York, a high-fashion retailer that earlier this
year opened its first West Coast store in Orange County's
tony South Coast Plaza. "We don't react to short-term
business cycles," says Robert Pressman, executive vice
president.</p>
<p>With its high-fashion inventory, Barneys has some built-in
protection against recession. "When the economy turns down,
rich people are still rich people," says Carl Steidtmann,
chief economist for Management Horizons, a division of Price
Waterhouse. "The true upscale market is less recession-prone,
and it's still relatively underserved."</p>
<p>Barneys also has deep pockets thanks to its own cash and
the backing of Isetan Co., the Japanese retailer that has a
joint venture with Barneys. Says Mr. Pressman: "California,
and Southern California in particular, is our second-largest
customer base" after New York. Barneys plans to anchor its
West Coast expansion with a 110,000-square foot store a
diamond's throw from Beverly Hills' Rodeo Drive.</p>
<p>At the other end of the scale, Wal-Mart is targeting
Southern California as part of sweeping national expansion.
The Bentonville, Ark., discounter just opened a
110,000-square-foot store in Lancaster, some 50 miles from
Los Angeles, and another farther south in El Centro.
Observers expect the Wal-Mart formula of competitive pricing,
efficiency and service to give established discount chains a
run for their money.</p>
<p>Another low-priced retailer, Ikea AB, is proceeding with
expansion plans, although the health of the economy will
dictate how fast and how far the Scandinavian furniture giant
moves in its new market.</p>
<p>Ikea has few competitors here in the assemble-it-yourself
home-furnishings market, and is busy trying to reshape
consumers' attitudes toward knock-down furniture, but that
doesn't come cheaply. Ikea sank $2 million into a week-long
grand opening of its 240,000-square-foot store in Burbank,
north of downtown Los Angeles, which included one of the most
expensive billboard campaigns ever mounted in this car-crazy
area. The hoopla lured nearly 150,000 customers during the
launch.</p>
<p>Rene Hausler, president of the Ikea West division, says
three more megastores are on the drawing board; the economy
and other factors will shape future expansion.</p>
<p>Other newcomers, such as consumer electronics retailers
Silo Inc. and Good Guys Inc., are depending on deep pockets,
specialization and oceans of advertising to stake their turf.
The consumer-electronics battle will be one of the bloodiest
as the two big competitors take on market-dominant Circuit
City Stores, as well as scores of regional chains,
mom-and-pop outlets and a few struggling mass merchants.</p>
<p>Silo, based in Philadelphia but owned by the U.K.'s Dixons
Group PLC, opened 15 Southern California stores in October,
all located in outlets once occupied by the defunct Federated
Group Inc. consumer electronics chain. It plans to open 15
more stores next year.</p>
<p>Good Guys, San Francisco, is more narrowly focused, hoping
to skim higher-end customers by selling pricier, more
sophisticated goods and steering away from appliances. The
chain plans to have 12 Los Angeles-area outlets by the end of
next year.</p>
<p>Gottschalks Inc., a Fresno, Calif., regional department
and specialty store operator, is exploiting another chink in
competitors's armor. "We're looking at secondary cities where
there's lots of growth taking place," says Joe Levy,
chairman.</p>
<p>Gottschalks avoids cutting-edge trends, and brings branded
merchandise to smaller regional malls spurned by big chains
such as R.H. Macy & Co. and Carter Hawley Hale Inc.
Gottschalks is targeting fast-growing areas on the periphery
of Los Angeles, and thus far the formula has been a hit.
Gottschalks is one of the few retailers anywhere to report
double-digit increases for same-store sales in 1990.</p>
<p>The lure of Southern California -- and its high-end
shoppers -- has even drawn a quintessential New York
institution: The Metropolitan Museum of Art just opened shops
in Orange County and the Century City area of Los Angeles.
"We're looking for areas where the clientele is very
well-educated and has an interest in the arts," says Pat
Brugger, manager of store planning.</p>
