	<p class="article-leader">AUSTIN, Texas -- A pair of radio stations owned by the
family of former President Lyndon Baines Johnson have been
put on the block. But like many Texas properties, they aren't
worth as much as they used to be.
   Austin stations KLBJ-AM and KLBJ-FM have been valued at
$13.5 million by the Ted Hepburn Co., which has been retained
by the LBJ Co. to entertain offers for the properties.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>As recently as 1987, though, the family had received an
offer of $27.5 million from the Chase Group, a New York
investment company. Chase didn't meet the deadline for
closing the transaction, and the deal fell through.</p>
<p>John Barr, executive vice president of LBJ Co. said the
stations were profitable. He attributed the apparent steep
decline in the station's value to "the lack of capital and
borrowing ability of investors across the country." He added,
"This isn't a distress sale," although the family would sell
if it got the right price. The Johnson family has owned the
stations for over 40 years.</p>
<p>The LBJ Co. also has interests in communications, cable
television and real estate.</p>
