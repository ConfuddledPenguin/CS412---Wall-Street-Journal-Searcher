	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- A group including U S West Inc., Millicom Inc.
and a Russian eye surgeon signed a preliminary agreement with
the Soviet Union's Ministry of Communications to provide
cellular phone service in Moscow.
   The companies and Millicom's Soviet partner Svyatoslaz
Fyodorov, a Moscow-based eye surgeon and entrepreneur, are
still negotiating a definitive pact, including financial
terms and a network equipment supply contract, according to a
Millicom spokeswoman.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>However, she said the companies expect to begin service by
the third quarter of 1991 and plan to jointly bid on cellular
service projects in other Soviet cities.</p>
<p>U S West, Englewood, Colo., is one of the regional Bell
telephone companies. Millicom, New York, is a cellular and
paging services company.</p>
<p>Moscow's cellular plan calls for the group, including U S
West International Holdings Inc., a U S West unit, and
Millicom International Cellular S.A.R.L., a Millicom
affiliate, to run one of two networks in the Soviet capital.
The group also includes the Moscow Territorial Operational
Center for Long Distance and International Circuits, Voronezh
Research-Production Association and the Moscow Local
Telephone Network.</p>
