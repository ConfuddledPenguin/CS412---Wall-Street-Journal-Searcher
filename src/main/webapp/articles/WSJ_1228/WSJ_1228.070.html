	<p class="article-leader">CHICAGO -- Pork-belly futures prices tumbled on a report
that larger supplies of the product, which is used to make
bacon, are moving into cold storage.
   The weekly cold-storage report showed a growing number of
frozen pork bellies in stock, and this chilled the price of
the contract for February delivery 1.92 cents, just shy of
the daily limit of two cents. The contract settled at 62.87
cents a pound. The price of the hog futures contract for
February delivery, meanwhile, rose 0.10 cent to 48.82 cents a
pound as some traders unwound short positions in live hog
futures.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>One factor pressuring pork futures prices downward is the
expectation that hog slaughter will increase, said Thomas
Morgan, president of Sterling Research, of Arlington Heights,
Ill. He said cold weather in the Midwest has slowed the
movement of hogs to market, and when the weather warms large
movements of hogs are expected.</p>
<p>In cattle futures, prices were down on weakness in the
wholesale market, a good gauge of how interested retailers
are in featuring beef products in their stores. Analysts said
pork is priced cheaply in relation to beef, so retailers have
tended to feature pork. The cattle contract for February
delivery declined 0.32 cents to 77.25 cents a pound.</p>
<p>Analysts expect trading in pork futures to be light until
Jan. 4, when the U.S. Agriculture Department's hog and pig
report will be released. It will contain inventories of hogs
by class and weight.</p>
<p>Analysts have trouble predicting the contents of these
reports with any degree of certainty, and the futures market
often moves the daily price limit up or down on the trading
day after a report is released. So traders are wary of taking
large positions in pork futures just before the reports are
due.</p>
<p>News out of the Soviet Union, which is having such a
strong effect on grain markets, isn't causing much activity
in livestock and meat futures, analysts said. "There isn't
much red meat that is cheap enough for the Soviet Union to
buy," says Sterling's Mr. Morgan. "Realistically, if the U.S.
is going to export any meat to the Soviet Union, it will be
chicken legs."</p>
<p>In other commodity markets yesterday:</p>
<p>ENERGY: Crude-oil prices declined as traders shunned the
holiday markets. There was little interest in either buying
or selling oil contracts, participants said. Lack of
liquidity, a paucity of fresh news about the Persian Gulf and
the approach of year end were the primary reasons for the
lackluster market. Traders are becoming convinced that war
with Iraq is inevitable, a belief that should buoy prices.
During the last 48 hours, the U.S. government has warned
American citizens remaining in Jordan to leave as soon as
possible. And there have been reports that Jordan is building
up manpower along the cease-fire border it shares with Israel
in case of a surprise attack from that country. Both actions,
as well as the purchase of additional jet fuel by the Saudi
Arabian government, are being perceived as harbingers of war.
But barring major developments in the Middle East, traders
expect quiet markets through year end. Additional tough talk
in the New Year, however, will likely spark additional buying
and higher prices, they say.</p>
<p>SUGAR: Futures prices fell. The March contract was off
0.20 cent a pound to 9.70 cents. Moderate speculative demand
developed and helped the March contract to rise above 10
cents, a key resistance level, to 10.01 cents. The rally,
which began Wednesday, couldn't be sustained, and the March
contract fell back. There were no fundamental developments,
and trading was mostly on a technical basis. There has been
little buying interest in the world market, which encouraged
dealers to sell contracts after the March contract rose above
10 cents, one analyst said.</p>
<p>COCOA: Futures prices declined. The March contract was
down $27 a metric ton to $1,149. A rally that began last week
stalled yesterday as the March contract neared the $1,200
level, and prices fell back. After trading as high as $1,173,
the March contract slipped as low as $1,137 before recovering
slightly toward the close. There is no concern about supplies
of high-quality cocoa beans from the Ivory Coast, which is
one reason that rally attempts have quickly met resistance.</p>
