	<p class="article-leader">Anyone counting on wealthy foreigners and foreign
institutional investors to give U.S. stock and bond markets a
shot in the arm had better not hold their breath -- at least
judging the latest statistics.
   Private foreign investors actually sold $1.5 billion more
U.S. stocks and bonds than they bought in the third quarter.
That compares with net purchases of $3.6 billion in the
second quarter, according to U.S. Treasury data analyzed by
the Securities Industry Association.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Stocks were hard hit. So far this year, foreign investors
have unloaded a net $9.2 billion of U.S. stocks -- $2.4
billion of that in the third quarter. By comparison, they
bought a net $10.8 billion in the same period last year.</p>
<p>If the trend of the first nine months continues, foreign
individual and institutional investors will have bought a net
$2.3 billion of U.S. securities in all of 1990. That is a
mere 3.2% of the $71.2 billion they added to their portfolios
in the preceding year.</p>
<p>"You've got fewer private foreigners stepping forward to
absorb U.S. securities," said Susan Hering, an economist at
Salomon Brothers Inc. "That shifts the burden to foreign
official investors or domestic investors."</p>
<p>How much that affects U.S. markets and the financing of
the U.S. budget deficit is uncertain. Foreign investors
traditionally have influenced U.S. bond prices more than
stocks, but British and Japanese investors have at times
moved U.S. equity markets.</p>
<p>In the short term, foreigners' diminishing appetite for
U.S. bonds means that U.S. interest rates would be higher and
the dollar weaker than otherwise, if other things remain
constant, said David G. Strongin, director of international
finance at the Securities Industry Association.</p>
<p>He and others also pointed out, however, that while
private foreign investors sold a net $100 million of U.S.
Treasury securities in the third quarter, foreign governments
and central banks bought a net $11.3 billion.</p>
<p>That's a big jump from late 1989 and early 1990, when they
were net sellers of U.S. Treasurys. Some analysts attribute
the huge shift to a flight to quality, as governments and
central banks -- particularly in Europe and the Middle East
-- sold offshore Eurodollar holdings to buy U.S. government
paper after Iraq invaded Kuwait on Aug. 2.</p>
<p>No one knows whether the heavy foreign official purchases
will continue. Regardless, Ms. Hering pointed out that in a
recession, corporations borrow less to finance inventory and
capital investment, and individuals borrow less for
mortgages. In addition, "there's a flight to quality" from
stocks and corporate bonds to U.S. Treasurys. All this makes
it easier for the U.S. government to finance its budget
deficit.</p>
<p>For foreign investors, the factors deterring investment in
the U.S. have been the falling dollar, interest rates that
are lower than those in most other major industrial countries
and the huge federal budget deficit.</p>
<p>"The biggest problem I see in the U.S. has got to be the
state of the economy in light of the budget deficit and the
ability of the U.S. political leadership to bring it down,"
said Richard D. Muckart, director of sales and investing for
Ivory & Sime PLC in Edinburgh, Scotland. "There's no
political will to face up to it, and it could get worse."</p>
<p>Many analysts believe the dollar could strengthen next
year. "But I'm still concerned with the budget deficit, the
balance-of-payments deficit, and the {U.S. stock} market is
expensive on its own. At 14 times earnings, it's the most
expensive market with the exception of Japan and a few
others," said Iain Watt, investment director at Edinburgh
Fund Managers PLC in Edinburgh.</p>
<p>"We aren't looking for any earnings growth next year," he
added. "There are more negatives in the U.S. market than
positives."</p>
<p>All told, private foreign investors purchased only $900
million of U.S. bonds in the third quarter, down from $7.4
billion in the second quarter. Based on these trends, "we are
headed for record lows in equities, record lows in Treasurys
and a seven-year low in corporate bond purchases by
foreigners in 1990," said the Securities Industry
Association's Mr. Strongin.</p>
<p>He pointed out that, after being net sellers of U.S.
stocks for eight consecutive months, foreign investors did
buy $1.4 billion in July. But they quickly switched to
selling again after the Mideast crisis erupted in early
August.</p>
<p>If foreigners are taking money out of U.S. markets, so are
Americans. In the first three quarters, U.S. investors
purchased a net $7.3 billion of foreign stocks and $15.6
billion of overseas debt. While the stock purchases are
running behind the $9.4 billion for the same period last
year, foreign bond buying is double any previous full year. A
big lure was the high interest rates and strong currencies
available in several major overseas markets.</p>
<p>Most surprising, said Mr. Strongin, is that Americans'
purchases abroad were unaffected by the Mideast crisis. Even
though many foreign markets fell after Iraq's invasion, U.S.
investors bought a net $90 million of foreign stocks in
August. In the same month, American institutions sold a net
$1.8 billion of U.S. stocks, according to the securities
association.</p>
<p>"This trend reflects American institutions' continued
commitment to diversifying their portfolios to include
foreign securities," said Mr. Strongin. He noted that U.S.
institutions have a smaller percentage of their total
holdings invested in foreign securities than institutions in
other major countries do.</p>
