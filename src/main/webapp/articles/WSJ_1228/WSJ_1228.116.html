	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- The chairman of the Senate Banking Committee
has asked the Treasury to launch a wide-ranging study of U.S.
insurance companies, as congressional concern about the
industry increases.
   Sen. Donald Riegle (D., Mich.) requested that as part of
an eight-month study, Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady
consider the merits of abandoning state regulation of
insurance companies in favor of federal oversight.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"I believe that the recent history of the savings and loan
and commercial banking industries makes clear that the
federal government cannot afford to ignore serious problems
in any industry that lies close to the heart of the American
economy," Sen. Riegle said in a letter dated Dec. 20 to Mr.
Brady.</p>
<p>The request occurs as other lawmakers intensify their
scrutiny of the industry. Both Sen. Howard Metzenbaum (D.,
Ohio) and Rep. John Dingell (D., Mich.) intend to push for
legislation to tighten insurance regulation, possibly moving
it to the purview of a federal agency. Sen. Metzenbaum also
favors repeal of the insurance industry's 45-year-old
antitrust exemptions. Such a bill was approved by the House
Judiciary Committee last year, and nearly made it to the
House floor for a vote.</p>
<p>A Treasury spokesman said the department was considering
the request, but had no reaction yet. Sen. Riegle requested
that the study be completed by Sept. 1. Already, Messrs.
Dingell and Metzenbaum have indicated that they plan to press
ahead on insurance legislation.</p>
<p>Sen. Riegle asked the Treasury to assess the general
financial health of the insurance industry, which suffered a
record number of failures in 1989. He also requested an
evaluation of the industry's exposure to risky assets, such
as real estate and junk bonds, as well as the health of the
state guaranty funds and the effect of a large insurance
company failure on the economy. He also requested comment on
whether insurance companies, increasingly marketed as
investments, should be subject to more extensive disclosure
requirements.</p>
<p>Insurance industry lobbyists say that Capitol Hill concern
is overblown, but understandable, following the S&L industry
bailout, which will cost taxpayers $200 billion plus hundreds
of billions more in interest. "What is of grave concern is
that the wrong image about the industry's financial strength
is being promoted by unwarranted inquiries," said Henri
Bersoux, a lobbyist for the American Council of Life
Insurance.</p>
<p>He said that Congress believed the life insurance industry
is healthy enough to incur an $8 billion increase in its tax
burden, as part of the recent federal budget pact. The total
industry has roughly $2 trillion in assets.</p>
