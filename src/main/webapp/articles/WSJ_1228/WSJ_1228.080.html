	<p class="article-leader">Dynatronics Laser Corp. said a shipping delay in two new
product lines will cut profit in the second quarter, ending
Monday, to near break-even.
   In the year-ago quarter, the medical devices company
earned $92,696, or one cent a share, on sales of $1.6
million.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The delay of the product lines -- medical rehabilitation
exercise equipment and software -- until after the start of
the new year was caused by extended field tests and the
shortage of parts, company officials said in Salt Lake City.</p>
<p>The company cited increased expenses and reduced sales
caused by the delay as reasons for lower-than-expected
second-quarter financial results.</p>
