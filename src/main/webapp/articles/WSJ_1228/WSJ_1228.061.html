	<h3>Advertising: Electronics Makers Are Wooing Women After Years of Taking Them for Granted</h3>

	<p class="article-leader">After decades of picturing their customers as young men,
consumer electronics makers are waking up to the fact that
women buy gadgets, too.
   In the December issue of Elle magazine, an advertisement
for Pioneer Electronic Corp. is tucked among the pungent
perfume ads and glossy fashion spreads. Tandy Corp. is
opening a chain called the Edge in Electronics with a homey
decor designed to put female shoppers at ease. And Sharp
Corp. says it is consciously eschewing advertising in men's
magazines like Playboy and Penthouse that might offend women.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Women don't represent a new market -- just an ignored one.
Although women account for half of all sales in many product
categories, marketers have rarely bothered to sell directly
to them. Last year, the industry bought only seven pages of
ads in Working Woman magazine, up from a paltry quarter page
in 1987. "The attention the industry gives to readers of our
magazine is minimal," says Carol Taber, publisher of Working
Woman.</p>
<p>One consequence of marketers' neglect: While plenty of
women buy consumer electronics products, few seem to relish
the experience. Consider Laura Matalon Waller, a theatrical
press agent and marketing consultant. Although she loves to
shop and has bought stereo components, a microwave oven and a
laptop computer, she didn't enjoy doing it. "Stereo equipment
just doesn't excite me," she says. "There's just nothing
about these products that makes you want to browse the
stores."</p>
<p>When Lori Levin, director of corporate communications at
Virgin Atlantic Airways, decided she wanted a camcorder to
tape her two-month-old daughter, researching her options was
frustrating. "I was ready to spend a lot of money, but the
attitude I got when I was trying to understand how the
equipment worked was `Don't worry, your husband will figure
it out.'"</p>
<p>There may also be a sociological component to women's
apathy. "It's like math fear," says Faith Popcorn, chairman
of BrainReserve, a marketing consulting firm. "We just didn't
grow up putting model airplanes together."</p>
<p>Of course, plenty of women overcome that anxiety. They
accounted for a hefty 40% of all videocassette recorder sales
within the past 12 months, according to a study by New
York-based Simmons Market Research Bureau Inc. Women also
purchased 41% of all compact disk players and 58% of all
console stereo systems.</p>
<p>It's no coincidence that marketers' sensitivity to women
is rising at a time when new customers are desperately
needed. After a decade of feverish new product activity,
there are no blockbuster innovations in sight. Sales of most
existing lines, including VCRs and most stereo equipment, are
flat. At the same time, competition continues to drive down
some prices.</p>
<p>What's more, marketers of consumer electronics products
say the demographic profile of their consumers changes over
the life of the product. "You generally get the very upscale,
very `techie' person with a new technology, and they tend to
be male," says Stan Hametz, vice president and general
manager of Panasonic's VHS division. "When the product
becomes more of a commodity item, its appeal broadens to all
consumer segments."</p>
<p>Now companies are scrambling to convert women's
indifference to the industry into an opportunity. Hachette
Publications Inc. has begun putting out a quarterly magazine
called Sound & Image that's designed to appeal to women as
well as men. Hachette, which also publishes such macho
handbooks as Stereo Review and Car Stereo Review, says
advertisers are interested in a publication that will reach
well-heeled female "techies."</p>
<p>When BBDO Los Angeles/San Francisco made its pitch for
Pioneer's advertising account last fall, it strongly
recommended targeting women, according to Ron Harrison,
senior vice president and director of media services for the
agency. To help cultivate brand loyalty among women, the
Omnicom Group unit encouraged the company to include Elle
magazine in its current image campaign, which is also running
in such general interest magazines as Time and Newsweek.</p>
<p>To broaden its appeal, Panasonic Co., a unit of Matsushita
Electric Industrial Co., advertises in such publications as
American Baby and Gourmet and passes out brochures for its
camcorders at child birth classes. The company is also
running ads for an array of products in general interest
magazines like People.</p>
<p>"Camcorders used to be men's toys, but now they are family
decisions," says Panasonic's Mr. Hametz.</p>
<p>But many companies seem destined for a rough ride up the
learning curve. Even as Panasonic tries to appeal to the
family, it takes a very male perspective. In one radio spot
set in a hospital delivery room, a father-to-be and an
obstetrician become entranced by the lightweight camera, just
as mom enters the last stages of labor. Carol Colman, founder
of Colman Consulting Inc., believes that situation will turn
off women. "Nobody wants to remember the moments just before
childbirth," she says.</p>
<p>And though Sharp Electronics has been aiming its ads at
women for years, some misfire. One print ad for its Wizard
series of electronic organizers shows a man and a woman, both
in business dress, sitting on a flight of steps. But while
the man pushes the buttons on the electronic gadget to get a
readout of his schedule for the day, his female companion is
only a spectator.</p>

<p>Amex to Start Campaign</p>
<p>The American Stock Exchange, following the lead of the
nation's other big stock markets, next weekend will launch an
ad campaign promoting its image.</p>
<p>The ads, which will run in publications like the New York
Times and The Wall Street Journal, target companies that
might be candidates for listing on the exchange --
specifically the mid-sized growth companies it specializes
in. The campaign, themed "It's time you traded up," was
developed by Follis & Verdi, a New York ad agency.</p>
<p>Amex, which is a distant third behind the New York Stock
Exchange and Nasdaq in market volume, attacks Nasdaq head-on
in some of the ads, citing the advantages of market
specialists and Amex's narrower spread between "bid" and
"asked" quotes. Amex Chairman James R. Jones said he decided
a year ago that "the image of Amex -- what our strengths and
niches were -- wasn't clear."</p>
<p>Both the New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq began similar
ad campaigns earlier this year.</p>

<p>Ad Notes. . . .</p>
<p>NEW ACCOUNT: Winchell's Donut Houses, La Mirada, Calif.,
named Weller, Kollewe & O'Sullivan, Los Angeles, to handle
its $4 million ad account. Winchell's, a unit of Shato
Holdings of Vancouver, British Columbia, has done little
advertising during the past four years.</p>
