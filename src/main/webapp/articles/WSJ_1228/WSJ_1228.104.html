	<p class="article-leader">Tokyo stock prices finished little changed Thursday, as
gains posted earlier in the day were chipped away by
profittaking toward the end of the session, traders said.
   In London, share prices closed higher, and at the top of
the day's trading range, in a market starved for activity.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The Nikkei index of 225 selected issues was up 53.14
points at 23940.70.</p>
<p>At the end of Friday's morning session, the Nikkei closed
at 23,848.71, down 91.99.</p>
<p>Volume on the first section Thursday was estimated at 330
million shares, up from 223.5 million shares Wednesday.
Gaining issues outnumbered declining issues 599 to 345, while
153 issues remained unchanged.</p>
<p>The Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed in the
first section was up 10.74 points, or 0.62%, at 1740.55.</p>
<p>The Second Section Index gained for the first time in nine
trading days, climbing 3.99 points, or 0.15%, to close at
2722.06. Volume in the second section was estimated at four
million shares, virtually unchanged from 3.99 million shares
Wednesday.</p>
<p>Stock prices in general found support at their
intrasession lows through a moderate amount of buying by
newly launched investment trust funds, and by arbitrage
buying, traders said.</p>
<p>Large-capital shares such as steel manufacturers and
shipbuilding companies were bought, as well as big-name
companies such as Hitachi and Mitsubishi Estate. Talk that
Secretary of State James Baker may visit Iraq for discussions
on Jan. 9 also provided some stability to the market, traders
said.</p>
<p>But the market failed to sustain investors' buying
interest. After advancing to the intraday high of 24263.63
points at midafternoon, the Nikkei index quickly turned
downward, falling 322.93 points by the end of the day.</p>
<p>Most investors were sitting on the fence earlier in the
day, but started taking profits on the perception that stock
prices were unlikely to rise further, said Shigeru Akiba,
head of equity at UBS Phillips & Drew International.</p>
<p>With only the Friday morning session left for this year,
investors were wary of keeping positions high amid the
ongoing Persian Gulf crisis and political uncertainty in the
Soviet Union, participants said. The market will be closed
from Dec. 29 to Jan. 3.</p>
<p>"There are no strong incentives to buy. But at the same
time investors have no reason to hurry to sell as stock
prices are unlikely to fall widely below the current level,"
said a senior trader at Yamaichi Securities.</p>
<p>Mr. Akiba of UBS Phillips & Drew International predicts
stock prices will be supported Friday as arbitragers are
likely to buy stocks to take advantage of a wide premium on
futures compared with stocks at the end of Thursday's
trading.</p>
<p>Nippon Steel was the most heavily traded issue for the
day, ending at 448 yen ($3.29), up 10 yen. Among other steel
makers, Sumitomo Metal gained six yen to 456 yen, while NKK
ended one yen higher at 401 yen, pushed down from its
intraday high on profit-taking.</p>
<p>Other gainers included Hitachi, which was up 10 yen to
1,120 yen, and Mitsubishi Estate, which advanced 50 yen to
1,390 yen.</p>
<p>Shipbuilding companies also attracted buying, with Mitsui
Engineering & Shipbuilding up 12 yen to 542 yen, while
Mitsubishi Heavy Industries gained three yen to 673 yen.</p>
<p>Also popular were shares of some pharmaceuticals. Mochida
gained 190 yen to 2,540 yen, while Ono Pharmaceutical was up
350 yen to 4,500 yen.</p>
<p>Separately, the Tokyo Stock Exchange reported data on
stock-futures arbitrage trading for the week ended Dec. 21.
The number of short cash positions held at the end of the
week totaled 5.7 million units, amounting to 6.13 billion
yen. The number of long positions, meanwhile, totaled 182.9
million units, amounting to 209.37 billion yen.</p>
<p>As of Dec. 21, the number of short cash positions held
against March futures contracts declined 37.4 million units
to zero, marking a 42.59 billion yen loss. On the other hand,
the number of long positions held against March contracts
increased 142 million units to 485.6 million units. The value
rose to 541.1 billion yen.</p>
<p>In London, the Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-Share
Index closed 11.5 points higher at 2167.8, up from the day's
worst level of 2155.7 recorded in the first hour of trading.</p>
<p>The narrower FT 30-Share Index closed 8.9 points higher at
1687.8. Volume was a meager 177.4 million shares.</p>
<p>The London exchange was closed Tuesday and Wednesday for
holiday.</p>
<p>Brokers said trade is effectively on hold until the new
year, with most operators absent from the market for the
holiday season. This gave activity an overbearingly technical
tone, apart from a few new year trading tips that generated
volume in selected issues.</p>
<p>A late start to trading on the American and New York stock
exchanges, caused by a fire in the Wall Street area, further
deprived London of incentive during the afternoon session. By
the close of trading in London, the Dow Jones Industrial
Average was off to a poor start.</p>
<p>Among shares benefiting from the new year trading
recommendations published by various newspapers, the property
development group Trafalgar House rose seven pence (13 cents)
to 203 pence a share while the telecommunications group Cable
& Wireless ended two pence higher at 446 pence.</p>
<p>Food distribution and service company Albert Fisher was
unchanged at 117 pence. Earlier, the company said it paid #15
million ($28.2 million) for the European frozen vegetable and
seafood assets of Campbell Soup Co.</p>
<p>Shares in building products company RMC ended two pence
lower at 650 pence. RMC has reported to the U.K. Office of
Fair Trading that some of its units operated unlawful
market-sharing practices.</p>
<p>In the pharmaceutical sector, shares in Wellcome ended
five pence higher at 435 pence, despite the potential
competition of a new treatment for AIDS developed through a
U.S.-Swiss joint venture.</p>
<p>Glaxo closed 12 pence higher at 861 pence, and SmithKline
Beecham finished five pence higher at 625 pence.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, share prices closed higher in Milan, lower in
Stockholm, Paris, Frankfurt and Madrid and mixed in Brussels,
Zurich and Amsterdam. South African gold stocks closed
firmer.</p>
<p>Share prices closed higher in Sydney, Singapore and
Taipei, and lower in Manila, and were little changed in
Wellington and mixed in Hong Kong. The Seoul stock market was
closed for holiday.</p>
<p>Here are price trends on the world's major stock markets,
as calculated by Morgan Stanley Capital International
Perspective, Geneva. To make them directly comparable, each
index is based on the close of 1969 equaling 100. The
percentage change is since year-end.</p>
