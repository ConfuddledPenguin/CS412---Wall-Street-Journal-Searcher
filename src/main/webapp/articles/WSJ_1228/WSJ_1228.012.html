	<p class="article-leader">FRANKFURT, Germany -- The cost of living in western
Germany in December was unchanged from November, the
Wiesbaden-based Federal Statistics Office said in a
preliminary report, which was mostly in line with economists'
expectations.
   Living costs in the 11 states that make up what was
formerly West Germany, however, rose 2.7% from December 1989.
The preliminary index is based on data supplied last week by
four western German states: Hesse, Bavaria,
Baden-Wuerttemburg and North Rhine-Westphalia. Final results
will be published in the middle of January, after all 11 of
these states report their price data.</p>
