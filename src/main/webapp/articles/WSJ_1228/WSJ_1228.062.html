	<p class="article-leader">MONTREAL -- Air Canada said it will seek to sell at least
a majority interest in its enRoute corporate travel credit
card unit.
   Gary Lynch, president and chief executive of enRoute, said
the unit is profitable, but he declined to provide revenue
and net income figures.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Mr. Lynch said enRoute has about 300,000 cardholders,
mainly in Canada. The enRoute credit card was introduced in
the U.S. two years ago. The card is accepted by more than 200
airlines and about 15,000 hotels, restaurants and other
concerns.</p>
<p>Air Canada, the country's largest carrier, said it decided
to sell at least a majority stake in the enRoute unit to
allow it to concentrate on its core airline business. Mr.
Lynch said Air Canada hasn't indicated how large a minority
stake it would be willing to retain in enRoute.</p>
<p>Air Canada recently cut about 2,900 jobs, or 12.5% of its
work force, and suspended service on three international
routes. For 1990's first nine months, Air Canada's net income
dropped 45% to C$50 million, or 68 Canadian cents a share,
from the year-earlier period. Revenue was C$3.04 billion.</p>
