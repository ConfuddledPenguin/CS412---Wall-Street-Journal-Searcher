	<p class="article-leader">After spending the past eight years lying comatose in a
bed, fed by a tube running into her stomach, Nancy Cruzan has
died. For years, a fierce public debate raged over whether
the proper course of care -- keeping her alive with feeding
machinery or withdrawing it -- was moral, humane, ethical or
legal. The case was brought before a series of courts,
including the U.S. Supreme Court. For us, this is the key
revelation of the Cruzan story -- that judges and only judges
settled it.
   No one would deny that the plight of a Nancy Cruzan, and
many other hopelessly ill people, raises difficult questions
of morality and conscience. And maybe there was a time, now
gone, when these questions would be resolved by a family, its
doctor and its clergyman. However the matter was resolved,
life would go on for that family, as it would for other
families as they passed through these periods of seemingly
unbearable distress. But no more.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>In America now, nothing is allowed to be merely personal.
Instead, it is a matter of "policy" that simply must be
"debated" at great length in public, no matter how grotesque
or obscene the spectacle of conducting such business around
the bent form of a woman in a vegetative state.</p>
<p>Fifty cents sometimes lets you call a TV station to vote
thumbs up or down on who gets the kids, whether Nancy Cruzan
lives, whether the whale dies. Conferences are routinely held
around such issues now, with the participants boarding planes
to fly for hours to cities and spend several nights in a
hotel to argue from morning until late afternoon about the
ethics of such cases. The discussion at these events is often
interesting, too. Quite interesting.</p>
<p>But in our country, talk, no matter how well argued, is
taken by the combatants to be merely talk. What they want is
a law or a judgment. They want a judge to use his authority
to posit a right, and "settle" the debate. And indeed, in
June, the Supreme Court ruled, 5 to 4, that a citizen has a
"right to die." But being jurists rather than high priests,
the Justices also ruled that the Cruzan family hadn't met
Missouri's "heightened evidentiary standards," thereby
requiring a succession of legal interventions and
counter-interventions by "right to life" advocates, before a
Missouri judge finally ruled that it was OK to stop the
feeding machine.</p>
<p>In his concurrence to the Cruzan decision, Justice Scalia
warned that the Court "will destroy itself" if it continues
to take up controversies wherever human irrationality and
oppression may theoretically occur. We would take Justice
Scalia's warning to its corollary: This society will damage
its civil cohesion if it insists on making judges arbiters of
disputes that should be matters mainly of morality mediated
by conscience.</p>
<p>One might answer that what could be called the "common
conscience" of American society about such matters has been
divided in our time. That is true, but our apparent inability
to reform a common conscience to any degree without resort to
lawsuits at leasts suggests the decline of institutions that
once helped individuals find their way.</p>
<p>We particularly have in mind the organized churches and
their administrators and teachers, who essentially decided
during the past 20 years that people could fend for
themselves on matters of personal morality while the churches
joined the "struggle" to establish social "rights" whose
imprimatur comes from the courts, America's unique bishopric.</p>
<p>About 350 years ago, when the affairs of dying at the end
of one's life were better understood, John Donne asked: "What
is so intricate, so entangling as death? Who ever got out of
a winding sheet?" Nancy Cruzan, entangled eight years in
publicity, is now in peace. As a society we somehow have to
rediscover what we already know as individuals and families
-- that death's intricacies are beyond the grasp of codes or
judges.</p>
