	<p class="article-leader">Westpac Banking Corp. of Wellington, Australia, said it
offered to acquire Southland Building & Investment Society,
New Zealand's biggest mutually owned savings institution with
assets of about 400 million New Zealand dollars (US$235
million).
   A Westpac spokesman wouldn't disclose financial details of
the offer. The 50,000 members of Southland are to hold an
extraordinary meeting in February to consider the offer.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The proposed acquisition is the first expansion by Westpac
in New Zealand in about seven years. If successful, Westpac
intends to maintain Southland as a wholly owned but separate
entity. An application to the Reserve Bank of New Zealand for
a full banking license for Southland would be made if the bid
is successful, Westpac said.</p>
