	<p class="article-leader">DALLAS -- McDuff Electronics & Appliances Supercenters, a
division of Tandy Corp. of Fort Worth, has agreed to pay a
$15,000 fine and refrain from making misleading advertising
claims.
   In a complaint brought by the Texas attorney general's
office, McDuff was accused of advertising sales in which
products were priced as little as 0.10 of a percentage point
below the normal price. "If you advertise a sale, the
discount must be at least 10% less than the normal price,"
said Assistant Attorney General Steve Gardner.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Among other practices, McDuff was also accused of calling
certain prices "the lowest of the year" when they were equal
to prices before and after the sale.</p>
<p>Although the company didn't admit to any wrongdoing in
accepting the final judgment, it accepted a list of
restrictions on its advertising practices and agreed to
provide proof it is conforming with the judgment until the
end of 1992.</p>
<p>In its ads McDuff must make clear all wording that
indicates a sale and must include a prominent explanation of
its pricing policy when using the legend "Nobody Undersells
McDuff." The $15,000 fine is intended to reimburse the
attorney general's office for its investigative costs.</p>
<p>McDuff president Victor J. Sholis referred comment to a
spokesman, who didn't return telephone calls.</p>
