	<p class="article-leader">SANTIAGO, Chile -- "It was just a security training
exercise," Gen. Augusto Pinochet, Chile's ex-dictator and
current armed forces commander-in-chief, said sheepishly. "No
troops even went out into the street."
   But as soon as he put Chile's army in a state of alert
last week, the country's democratically elected government
went into a frenzy. Top officials huddled late into the night
around President Patricio Aylwin, wondering whether the
exercises weren't really the start of a military rebellion.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>They weren't -- but they were more than exercises.
Although the incident ended without a shot being fired, it
wasn't just a tempest in a tea-pot: It underlines the
lingering mistrust between armed forces and civilian
governments that reign throughout South America, testing the
solidity of the democratic revolution that swept the region
in the past few years.</p>
<p>Military restlessness has appeared in several South
American countries, underscoring the difficulty of
subordinating the military to civilian governments and the
need to redefine the role of the armed forces in the
post-dictatorship, post-Cold War era, military analysts say.
While they say conditions aren't right for a military coup in
any major South American country, the threat of military
destabilization will be a permanent feature of transition
processes while governments and armed forces try to build up
mutual trust.</p>
<p>Indeed, the military might be out of the presidential
palaces they once occupied, but they aren't out of the minds
of the democratically elected presidents who now sit in them.
A series of events this past month have brought the military
back into the forefront of South American political life:</p>
<p>-- In Argentina, an arch-nationalistic army faction staged
its fourth -- and bloodiest -- rebellion in three years. In
what President Carlos Menem described as a coup attempt, the
mutineers seized five buildings, including armed forces
headquarters in central Buenos Aires; the short-lived
rebellion left 14 people dead and 53 wounded.</p>
<p>-- In the tiny former Dutch colony of Suriname, the army
toppled elected president Ramsewak Shankar in an apparently
bloodless Christmas-day coup that makes Suriname the only
South American nation with a military regime. The coup leader
pledged to hold elections within 100 days.</p>
<p>-- In Brazil, there is widespread discontent over
declining salaries and government spending cuts.</p>
<p>Many analysts say a common thread runs through the
stirrings: they all are signs of the difficulties experienced
by the armed forces in adjusting to a new domestic and
international context, and of the civilian governments'
slowness in formulating new security policies.</p>
<p>"Latin American armed forces have an identity problem,"
says Genaro Arriagada, vice president of Chile's Christian
Democratic party and an expert on the military. "We're going
to have to discover a new role for the armed forces, and this
isn't just a theoretical problem."</p>
<p>Indeed, South America has undergone a change as dramatic
as Eastern Europe's over the past decade. Only a few years
ago, military men were in power in almost all of South
America. Armed forces were geared toward fighting internal
subversion. Border conflicts flared.</p>
<p>Today, democracy is largely the rule. The external threat
of Communism has subsided, and "there is no {internal} threat
to democracy from the left," says Edgardo Boeninger, a top
adviser to Chile's President Aylwin. The idea of open borders
and economic integration is catching on throughout the
region.</p>
<p>This change has stripped the military of much of their
reason for being and has required a re-evaluation of their
size and functions, analysts say. The world trend toward
disarmament and lower defense spending, combined with the
return of democracy in South America, should lead to a
smaller, professional military whose tasks could include
waging war on drugs and terrorism, patrolling South America's
vast and porous borders and helping rebuild the region's
antiquated infrastructure.</p>
<p>But this redefining of the military's functions requires
efforts by both sides. "You can define the role of the armed
forces, but the armed forces may not like it," says Andres
Fontana, an Argentine sociologist specializing in the
military. "It's like cat food: it may have all the vitamins
necessary, but the cat may prefer eating fish. It takes time
to get used to a new system, new values and new roles. It
will need flexibility on both sides. We have to use this
moment productively, reintegrate and reprofessionalize the
armed forces, so that when the hard times come -- which you
have to think of in Latin America -- people don't look to the
military as an alternative and they {the military} don't see
themselves as one."</p>
<p>Argentina and Chile will provide quick tests. Argentina's
Mr. Menem has been seeking to placate the military by
granting controversial amnesties to members of the armed
forces involved in human-rights abuses when they were in
power and dispatching two warships to the Persian Gulf. But
the recent rebellion shows this isn't enough. Mr. Menem is
now seeking to restructure the armed forces by concentrating
units and closing down installations, but military expert
Rosendo Fraga calls the plan "inefficient and insufficient."</p>
<p>At the same time, he is grappling with the after-effects
of the recent rebellion. After first urging the death penalty
for the leaders, he told reporters yesterday he no longer
supports such severity. "There won't be any executions," he
said.</p>
<p>Chile's transition is complicated by Gen. Pinochet's
continued role as commander-in-chief. The recent "exercises"
he ordered were seen as an effort to slow congressional
inquiries into alleged corruption under his former
dictatorship as well as investigations into the widespread
human-rights abuses committed under his rule. Mr. Aylwin is
playing a delicate balancing act between punishment and
maintaining stability and the next months are expected to be
tense.</p>
<p>Still, analysts see signs of hope in the recent events.
The Argentine rebellion and Chilean tensions ended quickly
and a majority of the armed forces sided with the government.
Moreover, although countries like Peru, Brazil and Argentina
are going through severe economic and social problems, no one
looks to the military as an alternative.</p>
<p>"The fact that there wasn't a military reaction {in those
countries} is very significant," says Mr. Arriagada. "A
decade ago, with 10% of these problems, they would have taken
power."</p>
