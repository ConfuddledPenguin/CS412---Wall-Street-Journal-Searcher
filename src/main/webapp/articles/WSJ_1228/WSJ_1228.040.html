	<p class="article-leader">Procter & Gamble Co., seeking to expand its presence in
the potentially lucrative Eastern European market, created a
new division to oversee its sales operations there.
   The Cincinnati consumer products giant said that effective
Jan. 1, it would also subdivide its European Health and
Beauty Care operation into three divisions, each responsible
for different regions within Europe.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>In recent months, Procter & Gamble has been laying the
groundwork for a more aggressive stance in Eastern Europe by
installing sales managers in Hungary, Poland and
Czechoslovakia. Procter & Gamble had been cautious about
expanding into the region, but that's changed as the Eastern
bloc has moved to a more market-oriented economy. The
company's ties to the region have been strictly through
exports, but analysts speculate the company may also want to
eventually build manufacturing plants there. The company
won't comment.</p>
<p>Analysts believe Procter & Gamble and other consumer
products concerns, such as Colgate-Palmolive Co., Unilever
N.V. and Gillette Co., can take advantage of huge untapped
markets in Eastern Europe, particularly after currency
problems are ironed out.</p>
<p>"A lot of people in those countries don't have access to
the type of high quality products that Procter & Gamble
makes, and it doesn't take a lot of money to buy things like
bath soap, detergent, toothpaste and diapers," said Bonita
Austin, an analyst at Wertheim Schroder & Co.</p>
<p>Procter & Gamble named Herbert Schmitz, 54 years old and
currently vice president of the company's Central Europe
Health and Beauty Care unit, to head the newly created
Eastern European division.</p>
<p>The company also named three executives to newly created
positions in its European Health and Beauty Care division,
effective Jan. 1. They are:</p>
<p>-- Michael A. Thompson, 48, currently division manager,
Western Europe Health and Beauty Care, was named division
manager, Northern Europe Health and Beauty Care, with
responsibility for business in Belgium, the Netherlands,
Scandinavia, the U.K. and the European Noxell shaving cream
and Shulton personal-care operations.</p>
<p>-- Bernd E. Beetz, 40, currently general manager, Procter
& Gamble Germany, was appointed division manager, Southern
Europe Health and Beauty Care, with responsibility for
business in Italy, France, Spain and Portugal.</p>
<p>-- Hans J. Honigfort, 44, currently general manager,
Health and Beauty Care, Germany, was named division manager,
Central Europe Health and Beauty Care, with responsibility
for business in Austria, Germany and Switzerland.</p>
