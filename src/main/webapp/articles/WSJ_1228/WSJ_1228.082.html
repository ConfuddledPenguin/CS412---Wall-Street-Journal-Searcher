	<p class="article-leader">NUEVO LAREDO, Mexico -- The smuggler's eyes dart warily as
he leads an American visitor into a concrete-walled compound
to view his cache.
   Dressed in tattered trousers and sandals, the young man
brushes past a Doberman pinscher and shoves open a door to
reveal, not cocaine, but . . . parrots. Dozens of bright
green-and-yellow spectacled amazons huddle in
stick-and-balingwire cages and squawk at the intrusion.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"Choose whichever ones you want," says the smuggler, who
local shopkeepers say is a big dealer's employee.
"Thirty-five dollars each on this side of the river. Sixty
dollars on the U.S. side." A Chicago pet shop might charge
$150.</p>
<p>That helps explain why the business of parrot smuggling is
soaring these days. Parrots caught in the jungles of Mexico,
South America, Africa and Indonesia can be bought for only a
few dollars from the local people, who knock them from their
nests. The birds' value rises steadily as they are moved
northward; the U.S. bans some birds because they are on
endangered-species lists, and the cost of even legal imports
is raised by quarantine rules. By the time the birds reach
U.S. or European consumers, some birds, such as the large
imperial amazons of Dominica, in the Caribbean, fetch
$100,000 apiece.</p>
<p>"You can make a fortune" smuggling parrots, says Donald
Bruning, the bird curator at the New York Zoological Society.
"And if you get caught with birds, you get a slap on the
wrist, but if you get caught with drugs, you get slapped in
jail."</p>
<p>As with the drug trade, parrot smuggling is driven by
American buying. That demand "skyrocketed" in the 1970s, Mr.
Bruning says, largely because of the popularity of the
wisecracking pet cockatoo on the television series "Baretta."
And with more countries banning legal exports of parrots to
preserve dwindling bird populations, the proportion of
contraband birds sneaked into the U.S. is increasing.</p>
<p>According to the World Wildlife Fund, at least 225,000
birds worth some $50 million at retail are either smuggled or
imported with fraudulent documentation each year -- about 17%
of the $300 million in annual retail sales in the U.S.
Excluding smaller species such as parakeets and lovebirds,
which are raised in abundance by domestic breeders, the
percentage of illicit birds is even higher.</p>
<p>The illegal parrot trade isn't as victimless as it might
seem. For starters, parrots can harbor diseases fatal to
domestic poultry: An outbreak of exotic Newcastle disease,
blamed on parrots, infected the California chicken population
in 1971. Federal officials destroyed 12 million birds, mostly
laying hens, to halt the spread.</p>
<p>And now, bird smuggling is so big that it threatens to
eradicate many species in the wild. Some 77 of the world's
330 parrot species are said to be in immediate danger.
Although loss of habitat has been the biggest problem,
smugglers -- and, by inference, bird lovers in the developed
world -- get plenty of blame, too.</p>
<p>The carnage begins with the way parrots are gathered. When
the babies are just a few days old, peasants cut down their
trees and hack apart their nests to get at them. This not
only kills many fledglings but also may discourage their
parents from breeding again; some species use the same nests
for generations.</p>
<p>Many more of the weak, defenseless birds -- perhaps 90% --
die in transit because of improper feeding and inhumane
conditions. Federal agents regularly find bags of drowned
parrots that didn't survive the smuggler's swim across the
Rio Grande from Mexico. Asphyxiated birds turn up in the
trunks of cars. Some even die from alcohol poisoning: The
time-honored way to keep a parrot quiet during smuggling is
to give it a few drops of tequila.</p>
<p>"Smuggling has a devastating effect on the parrot
population," says Thomas D. Nichols, conservation officer for
the Amazon Society, a group dedicated to the preservation of
parrots.</p>
<p>Yet almost everyone seems to get in on the act. Back in
the 1970s, an exotic dancer was caught with several parrots
hidden in the tire well of her recreational vehicle as she
crossed through Laredo, Texas, on her way to a performance.
In Brownsville, Texas, last October, a 79-year-old woman
pleaded guilty to a single count of smuggling 61 parrots with
an estimated street value of $48,800. And U.S. Customs agents
frequently catch American tourists who purchase birds legally
in Mexico and try to sneak them into the U.S. stuffed in
pockets or brassieres.</p>
<p>"When they get caught, they always say, `I didn't know it
was there,'" says Billy McFarland, chief inspector of the
Customs Service in Hidalgo, Texas. "They'll say things like,
`I'll bet my cousin put that there and I didn't see it.'"</p>
<p>Parrot smuggling also tracks the illegal drug trade in
another way: Buyers can't be sure of getting an unadulterated
product. Just as cocaine is "cut" with cheap fillers as it
moves up the distribution system, so are low-quality parrots
often disguised to resemble more expensive ones.</p>
<p>A common trick is to disguise a conure, which doesn't talk
and retails for about $35 in the U.S., as a talking parrot.
Typically, the smuggler dyes the head yellow and trims the
tail, which is longer than that of other parrots. Presto,
it's a Mexican double yellowhead parrot, worth as much as
$800.</p>
<p>"These ol' boys make Michelangelo look like a beginner,"
says Kay Owens, a Laredo pet-shop owner, who refuses to deal
in hot birds.</p>
<p>Overwhelmed with drug cases, federal agents rarely spend
much time investigating parrot smugglers. In 1989, the U.S.
Fish and Wildlife Service, the lead agency combating the
problem, seized just 592 parrots. Still, that was more than a
threefold increase from 1988.</p>
<p>Lucky breaks help. Earlier this year, a confidential
informant led Customs officials to Henry Guerra, a Laredo
small-business man long suspected of dealing in illegal
birds. Following weeks of painstaking work, an undercover
agent finally made a "buy" at Mr. Guerra's suburban house.
She flashed a signal, and 10 armed customs investigators
swooped in and led the alleged smuggler away in handcuffs. As
neighbors gawked, 49 parrots were rescued from Mr. Guerra's
garage.</p>
<p>Mr. Guerra pleaded guilty to knowingly receiving smuggled
parrots and was sentenced to five months in jail. But he
contends in a jailhouse interview that he was unfairly tagged
as a major bird dealer because he uses parrot-shaped covers
on his golf clubs.</p>
<p>Another parrot fancier in Houston, who served two prison
terms for smuggling and is identified by a local wildlife
official as one of the biggest dealers ever, blames his
"weakness for feathers." Although asking that his name not be
used, the bearded 49-year-old discusses a life of parrot
crime spanning more than a decade.</p>
<p>He says he has brought birds across from Mexico nearly
every way imaginable. One parrot, which he kept as a pet, was
named "Sandia," Spanish for "watermelon," because it was
smuggled in a hollowed-out fruit. He claims to have passed
"thousands" of birds across the border, using boats, inner
tubes, paid swimmers, planes and automobile trunks. Once, a
pilot friend used the plane of a Mexican president that was
being serviced in the U.S. to transport 200 birds to the
Houston area, he says.</p>
<p>Though out of the business now, he still sees many signs
of it. On a tour of Houston pet stores, he stops in one
run-down shop to admire a baby redhead and a double
yellowhead, both natives of Mexico. The teen-ager behind the
counter says the birds were sold to the shop by a woman who
inherited them from her father. "They just need someone to
love them," he says.</p>
<p>But the former smuggler notes their youth, battered
condition and lack of a leg band and sneers under his breath:
"These birds are hotter than a pistol."</p>
