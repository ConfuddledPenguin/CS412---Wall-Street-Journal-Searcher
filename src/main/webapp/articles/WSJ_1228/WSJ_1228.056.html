	<p class="article-leader">Regarding your Dec. 10 article about the Department of
Justice and the House Judiciary Committee concerning the
Inslaw matter:
   The attorney general has directed that the department
cooperate fully with the committee's investigation and, as a
result, the department has provided hundreds of thousands of
documents to the committee, including documents related to
the pending litigation with Inslaw.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The department went so far as to obtain a court order to
permit the committee access to certain Inslaw software, which
culminated in the recent delivery of a truckload of material
to the committee.</p>
<p>The small fraction of material the department has not
turned over to the committee is protected by a fundamental
principal of the American legal system that keeps documents
revealing the thought processes of litigators confidential.
The documents in dispute are the memos and notes of
departmental attorneys assigned to defend the U.S. in the
litigation brought by Inslaw and are not factual materials
that would be evidence in the pending case.</p>
<p>By the same token, the government would be unable to
obtain comparable documents from Inslaw. In fact, such
documents, whether they belong to Inslaw or the U.S., cannot
be obtained by the opposing party in litigation. The
disclosure of the department's documents could be construed
to permit access by Inslaw, which would be fundamentally
unfair to the U.S. -- to the detriment of the American
taxpayers, who stand to lose more than $9 million in this
litigation.</p>
