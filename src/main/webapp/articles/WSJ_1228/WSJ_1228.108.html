	<p class="article-leader">More evidence that the economy has slipped into recession
put a damper on stock prices but nudged bond prices higher.
   The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 11.63 points to
close at 2625.50 after a session shortened by an electrical
fire that delayed the opening of the New York Stock Exchange
for 90 minutes.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Bond prices rose in light trading. The dollar was mixed,
posting gains against the Japanese yen, but falling against
the German mark.</p>
<p>A surprisingly big drop in November durable goods orders
set the tone for the day, pushing bond prices higher. The
orders plunged 10.5% last month, virtually confirming that
the economy is mired in recession. Economists had estimated
the order rate would be down a little more than 2.2%. Even
excluding the volatile transportation sector, which swings
widely from month to month because of huge aircraft orders,
the November pace was down 3.5% to the lowest level in two
years.</p>
<p>Economists said the dismal news almost certainly means
more layoffs in the industrial sector of the economy early
next year, adding to economic woes already afflicting large
parts of the country. The news makes it more likely that the
Federal Reserve will lower short-term interest rates further
in hopes of stimulating the rapidly weakening economy.</p>
<p>Some analysts predict the Fed will again cut the federal
funds rate -- which banks and other financial institutions
charge one another for short-term loans -- as early as next
week.</p>
<p>An explosion and fire outside a New York building housing
the computer nerve center for the major stock exchanges
prevented the New York Stock Exchange from opening until 11
a.m EST. But with trading activity stuck in low gear for the
holidays, traders said the delay had little perceptible
effect on either volume or prices.</p>
<p>Foreign currency trading was "extremely light" because
traders were reluctant to take positions in a thin market
without any compelling developments. While traders look to
the Middle East crisis and the Soviet Union's deepening
political problems to provide some support for the dollar,
profit-taking after last week's big runup has eaten away at
the dollar's recent gains against the mark. They said
Japanese purchases of short-term dollar-denominated
investments has strengthened the dollar against the yen
modestly in the past few days.</p>
<p>In major market action:</p>
<p>Stock prices slumped in thin trading. Volume on the New
York Stock Exchange totaled 103 million shares. Declining
issues on the Big Board were ahead of gainers 892 to 598.</p>
<p>Bond prices climbed. The Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond
gained nearly one-half of a point, or almost $5 for each
$1,000 face amount. The yield on the issue slipped to 8.24%.</p>
<p>The dollar was mixed. In late New York trading the
currency was quoted at 1.5255 marks and 136.40 yen compared
with 1.5368 marks and 136.25 yen Wednesday.</p>
