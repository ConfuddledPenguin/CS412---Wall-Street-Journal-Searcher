	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- New orders for durable goods plummeted 10.5%
in November, the Commerce Department reported, matching the
record drop set last January and offering further
confirmation that the economy took a steep downturn in the
fourth quarter.
   Though the plunge was led by a big slide in the volatile
transportation category, declines in orders were widespread.
Excluding transportation, the decline was 3.5%. The report
was doleful news for the beleaguered manufacturing sector,
which cut payrolls by 200,000 workers in November, according
to figures released earlier this month by the Labor
Department.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"This clearly shows the economy to be in the free-fall
stages of a recession," said Gordon Richards, an economist
with the National Association of Manufacturers.</p>
<p>The November decline in orders -- to $115.94 billion --
put orders at about the same level as in early 1988. The drop
followed an increase of 3.6% in October and a decline of 1.6%
in September.</p>
<p>Orders in the transportation sector fell 27.4% in November
after increasing 14.1% in the previous month. Aircraft
orders, particularly big orders to Boeing Co., have made the
transportation order figures erratic in the last few months.
Aircraft orders in November dropped 38.8%, after a 20.4%
increase that included a major Boeing order in October.</p>
<p>The record decline set last January also was led by
decreases in orders for aircraft and autos. Orders
subsequently moved slowly upward, increasing about 10%
between January and October.</p>
<p>Orders for nondefense capital goods, which economists view
as a sign of business investment plans, fell 16.4% in
November after rising 8.7% in October. Excluding aircraft,
nondefense capital goods orders dropped 6%, as electrical
machinery orders were off 7.6% to their lowest level since
March 1989. Orders for nonelectrical machinery were flat
after a 1.4% decline in October, while orders for primary
metals sank 9.8% in November, after a 5% increase the
previous month. All figures are adjusted for seasonal
variations.</p>
<p>"There's an unusually rapid decline in economic activity
going on," said Bruce Steinberg, an economist with Merrill
Lynch & Co. "Both production and orders are down. The
question now is whether this will continue or whether the
sharp declines now can pre-empt further declines later."</p>
<p>Many economists have been revising their estimates of
fourth-quarter economic growth in response to the last few
weeks' parade of bleak economic statistics. Many Wall Street
economists are now predicting that real gross national
product -- the inflation-adjusted output in goods and
services -- could contract 3% or more in the fourth quarter.
Merrill Lynch's estimate is that GNP will shrink 3.5%.</p>
<p>"That's sobering," Mr. Steinberg said, because in all
recessions going back to the 1950s, the first quarter of
decline was followed by other quarters in which the decline
was even bigger. But some economists are coming to the view
that managers have become more cautious and began slowing
down orders and production in this business cycle earlier
than usual. That could mean that a rebound from the sharp
drop in the fourth quarter will come more quickly.</p>
<p>Shipments of durable goods in November were down 3.6%
after a 1.5% increase in October. Unfilled orders slipped
1.1%, following a 0.7% rise the previous month.</p>
