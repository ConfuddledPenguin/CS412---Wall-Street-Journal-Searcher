	<p class="article-leader">TORONTO -- Deprenyl Research Ltd. said it is seeking
permission for doctors to prescribe its Eldepryl (R)
medication for patients newly diagnosed as suffering from
Parkinson's disease.
   In Canada, Eldepryl (R) is approved only for treatment of
patients with advanced-stage Parkinson's disease. Deprenyl
said permission to treat new patients with the drug was
received in the United Kingdom in May.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The request for approval to use Eldepryl (R) as initial
therapy in new patients is based on results of clinical
studies in Canada and the U.S., Deprenyl said.</p>
<p>Eldepryl (R) is being investigated as a possible treatment
for other neurodegenerative diseases, particularly
Alzheimer's.</p>
