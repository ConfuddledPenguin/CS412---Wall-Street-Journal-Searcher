	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Contracting for new construction in November
reached its lowest level in five years, further evidence that
the economy is slumping.
   F.W. Dodge, the forecasting unit of McGraw-Hill Inc., said
its seasonally adjusted Dodge index fell to 144 in November
from 145, a four-year low, in October. The index uses 1982 as
a base year of 100.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The value of newly started construction of all kinds fell
to an annualized $225.9 billion in November from $228.3
billion in October. Nonresidential building contracts and
new-home start-ups fell 8% and 4%, respectively, to $77.6
billion and $91.8 billion. In contrast, values for
nonbuilding construction, which includes public works and
utilities, surged 16% to $56.5 billion, reflecting an $800
million program of pipeline repair and replacement in Alaska.
This project helped to keep the index from falling more
steeply.</p>
<p>Despite economic uncertainties, construction start-ups
aren't unusual in the category of large nonbuilding projects
requiring three to five years lead time. But conventional
commercial and residential projects are hurting for
financing. George A. Christie, vice president and chief
economist for F.W. Dodge, said, "Lenders are properly wary of
real estate investment after the S&L mess, but if lenders
won't lend, developers can't build."</p>
<p>Construction activity declined in all five major regions
in the nation, particularly in the Northeast and the South
Atlantic, which recorded 21% and 16% declines, respectively.
Smaller than average slumps, ranging from 3% to 6%, were
reported in the South Central, the West and the North Central
regions.</p>
<p>Through the first 11 months of 1990, total construction
contract values declined 10% to $225.6 billion from $251.3
billion in the previous year. Nonbuilding construction
remained flat.</p>
