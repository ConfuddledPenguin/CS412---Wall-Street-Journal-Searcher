	<p class="article-leader">TOKYO -- Japan's steel exports in November fell 5.7% to
1,356,000 metric tons from a year earlier, marking a
continuing decline as manufacturers struggled to meet strong
domestic demand, Japan's Iron and Steel Federation said.
   A metric ton is equal to about 2,204.62 pounds.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Export prices for the month soared to $818 a ton, climbing
above the $800 level for the first time in history. A
federation official said the surge indicates that a large
part of exports consists of expensive items such as seamless
pipes and galvanized iron products.</p>
<p>Aside from such profitable, high value-added items,
"Makers have completely shifted to domestic demand-oriented
production," the official said.</p>
<p>Reflecting continued expansion of the Japanese economy,
orders from domestic auto makers, construction companies,
industrial machinery makers and shipbuilding firms remained
at "an extremely high level," he said.</p>
<p>While domestic steel production is expected to mark a
record high in 1990, steel exports for the year are likely to
drop to the lowest level in 20 years, the official said.</p>
<p>By market, exports to the U.S. posted their first
year-to-year gain in six months, up 8.2% at 237,000 metric
tons, helped by increases in exports of seamless pipe and
other oil drilling-related products, the official said.</p>
<p>Exports to the Soviet Union continued to improve, though
the total amount remained small. Exports rose 15% to 40,000
tons, as shipments of oil-drilling products resumed, after
price negotiations between producers and the Soviet
government were successfully concluded earlier this year.</p>
