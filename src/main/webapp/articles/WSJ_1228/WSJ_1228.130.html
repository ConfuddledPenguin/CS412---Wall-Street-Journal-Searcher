	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- Everybody has a boss, but who is Jacques de
Groote's?
   Technically, he has none. As an executive director of both
the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund, which pay
his salary, he is meant to be an independent official who can
vote as he chooses on approving aid and helping countries
adopt sound monetary policies.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>But since he is elected by six nations to look after their
interests, he must pay attention to their needs if he wants
to be re-elected every two years. Those countries are
Belgium, Austria, Luxembourg, Turkey, Hungary and
Czechoslovakia -- but not Zaire. It has its own executive
directors.</p>
<p>Mr. de Groote says he also reports to officials at the
National Bank of Belgium, which sent him to Washington in
1973, and at the Belgian finance ministry. Alfons Verplaetse,
the Belgian National Bank governor, is satisfied that Mr. de
Groote has kept him posted on matters essential to Belgium's
interests in Zaire. But some others say they have been either
unaware of or uneasy with his Zairean actions. A former
national bank official who dealt directly with Mr. de Groote
recalls warning him that "Zaire is not your business" and
urging him to be prudent. And in the early 1980s, according
to a former finance ministry official, Mr. de Groote told
Belgian Finance Minister Willy de Clercq he had stopped
advising Zaire.</p>
<p>Mr. de Groote, who plans to leave his posts in 1992, is
the senior member of the World Bank board and second-ranking
in seniority on the IMF board. He helps direct the affairs of
the multibillion-dollar, taxpayer-financed institutions. This
includes approving large loans, most of them to poorer
nations; the World Bank alone has lent more than $160 billion
since its founding in the 1940s.</p>
<p>Both the World Bank and the IMF have 22 directors, most
elected by groups of countries. For seven nations -- the
U.S., Germany, Japan, England, France, China and Saudi Arabia
-- directors are appointed by their governments and report
only to them. U.S. executive directors are appointed by the
president, are subject to Senate confirmation and report to
the Treasury Department.</p>
<p>Executive directors, whose board meetings are private,
work in a pampered environment. They benefit from first-class
air flights, luxury hotels, six-figure tax-free salaries,
salary supplements for non-working wives and other perks.
Unlike staffers, who are explicitly barred from leaking
information or using their positions for personal gain,
directors aren't subject to written restrictions. This
"doesn't mean it is a totally lawless situation," says a
senior World Bank lawyer. "If something egregious happens, I
think the board has the general power to control what
executive directors do," though there haven't been any test
cases.</p>
