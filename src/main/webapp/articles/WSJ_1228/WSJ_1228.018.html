	<p class="article-leader">MINNEAPOLIS -- Best Buy Co., with its expanded operations
and a reduced cost structure more than offsetting a tough
selling environment, said net income for its fiscal third
quarter ended Dec. 1 jumped 47%, on a 29% increase in
revenue.
   The consumer electronics and appliance retailer warned,
however, that it may take a hefty charge against earnings in
the near future, to cover changes in an accounting
requirement.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Best Buy's third-quarter net climbed in the latest quarter
to $1.3 million, or 16 cents a share, from the year-earlier
$888,000, or 11 cents a share. Revenue rose to $170.8 million
from $132.7 million.</p>
<p>"Competitive conditions," such as heavy discounting in a
sluggish economic environment, worked against profit margins,
and same-store sales declined by 1%, Best Buy said. In
addition, profitability was squeezed in the latest quarter by
narrower margins at "new concept" self-service stores the
company has recently opened.</p>
<p>Despite those pressures, earnings improved, "mainly due to
sales from eight new stores opened this year," as well as
lower operating expenses.</p>
<p>But Best Buy cautioned that a recent decision by the
Financial Accounting Standards Board could require a charge
of $14.3 million, or $1.73 a share, in the current fiscal
year.</p>
<p>The FASB's Technical Bulletin 90-I, issued this month,
requires companies to defer the initial recognition of
revenue from the sale of extended service plans, on plans
sold after Dec. 15, 1990. In general, such revenue is to be
recognized as income on a straight-line basis over the period
of the service contract, which generally runs from three to
five years.</p>
<p>Currently, such contacts are recorded in their entirety in
the period in which they are sold.</p>
<p>Best Buy said that if it decides to apply the provisions
of the new accounting pronouncement to existing contracts,
the move would generate the $14.3 million pretax charge; that
figure would include an approximately $14 million cumulative
effect adjustment for the prior years ended March 4, 1990,
and a charge of about $300,000, or four cents a share, for
the current year. A company official said, "I would expect
that we'll go ahead with the cumulative charge" in the
current fourth quarter.</p>
<p>The company stressed that the anticipated accounting
change "has no impact on the cash flow aspects of the service
plans."</p>
<p>For the nine months, Best Buy's net was $928,000, or 11
cents a share, compared with the year-earlier period's loss
of $246,000, or three cents a share. Nine-month revenue was
up 26%, to $449.1 million from $355.5 million.</p>
<p>In composite trading yesterday on the New York Stock
Exchange, Best Buy shares closed unchanged at $5.125.</p>
