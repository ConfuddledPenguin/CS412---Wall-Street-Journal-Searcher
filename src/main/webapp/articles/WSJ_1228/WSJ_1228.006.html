   AT&T said it will cut its standard weekday rates on
interstate calls made from the continental U.S. by 32% on
Dec. 31 and Jan. 1 between 8 a.m. and 11 p.m.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>For instance, a 10-minute, direct-dialed daytime call from
New York to Los Angeles that normally costs $2.49 will cost
only $1.49 on New Year's Eve, said AT&T.</p>
<p>AT&T also said subscribers to its Reach Out America
discount calling plans will get additional rate cuts
depending on which plan they have.</p>
