	<p class="article-leader">Two addenda to your excellent Dec. 12 editorial, "GATT
Riddance," recommending unilateral free trade:
   1. While 19th-century Britain is an excellent test of
unilateral free trade, it is not "the best," since critics
maintain that Britain's superpower status at the time enabled
it to impose its policy on other countries. Modern-day Hong
Kong is a better test -- a small island and peninsula with
few resources and no independent political power, yet
unilateral free trade enabled it to achieve an even higher
rate of growth in per-capita real income than its fellow
little Tigers, Singapore and Taiwan, despite more rapid
growth in population.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>2. The most effective succinct argument for free trade I
know was penned by Henry George, famous for his single tax,
more than a century ago: "Free trade consists simply in
letting people buy and sell as they want to buy and sell. It
is protection that requires force, for it consists in
preventing people from doing what they want to do. Protective
tariffs are as much applications of force as are blockading
squadrons, and their objective is the same -- to prevent
trade. The difference between the two is that blockading
squadrons are a means whereby nations seek to prevent their
enemies from trading; protective tariffs are a means whereby
nations attempt to prevent their own people from trading.
What protection teaches us is to do to ourselves in time of
peace what enemies seek to do to us in time of war." From
Henry George, "Protection or Free Trade" (1886; reprint ed.,
New York: Robert Schalkenbach Foundation, 1980), p. 47.</p>
