	<p class="article-leader">Recession talk has cast a pall on the computer industry,
but some desktop-computer makers are still shining.
   Analysts say results for the December quarter will
illustrate a continued split of the industry, in which many
makers of mainframes and minicomputers post smaller gains
while makers of personal computers and workstations prosper.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Digital Equipment Corp., based in Maynard, Mass. -- once a
highflier that used its minicomputers to tweak the noses of
oldline makers of more expensive mainframes -- is getting
some nose-tweaking of its own by the likes of Mountain View,
Calif.-based Sun Microsystems Inc. with less expensive, fast
workstations. Thus analysts say DEC profit will drop as much
as 60% in its fiscal second quarter ending Monday.</p>
<p>A big part of the problem for DEC and other companies such
as Blue Bell, Pa.-based Unisys Corp., which analysts expect
to post a fourth-quarter net loss, is the rapidly growing
trend toward open systems -- computers that use standard
software such as programs written for Unix operating systems.
That hurts makers of proprietary systems -- those that run
software written only for them.</p>
<p>But it's a boon for Sun and large PC makers such as
Houston-based Compaq Computer Corp., which, despite recession
signs, continue to post strong gains. Analyst Bruce Lupatkin
of Hambrecht & Quist Inc. expects Compaq to post a 70% rise
in fourth-quarter earnings to $133 million, or $1.55 a share,
from the year-earlier $79 million, or 92 cents a share, on a
40% revenue gain to $1.1 billion from $788 million.</p>
<p>Compaq's growth is outpacing other leading
desktop-computer makers mainly because of its huge presence
in the booming market for laptop and notebook computers, said
Mr. Lupatkin.</p>
<p>Sun Microsystems is expected to post strong gains in
profit and revenue for its fiscal second quarter ending
Monday. Peter Rogers, an analyst with Robertson Stephens &
Co., expects Sun's profit to increase 73% to $35 million, or
34 cents a share, from $20.2 million, or 23 cents a share, on
a 22% rise in revenue to $725 million from $595 million a
year earlier.</p>
<p>Not all desktop makers are in the pink. Cupertino,
Calif.-based Apple Computer Inc., for instance, is expected
to post roughly flat results for its fiscal first quarter
ending Monday. Mr. Lupatkin, of Hambrecht & Quist, expects
slightly lower profit of $115 million, or $1 a share, vs.
$125 million, or 96 cents a share, a year earlier. Sales are
expected to exceed $1.5 billion vs. $1.49 billion. For Apple
to see stronger sales, it needs to enter the laptop and
notebook market, Mr. Lupatkin says.</p>
<p>Some old-line makers -- including DEC -- have bigger
problems as recession fears slow capital spending. Robert
Herwick of Hambrecht & Quist, who admits he is "a rip-roaring
bear" on Digital, expects the company to post lower net
income of about $60 million, or 50 cents a share, for the
quarter, compared with $155.4 million, or $1.25 a share, a
year earlier. He expects sales of $3.1 billion vs. $3.18
billion.</p>
<p>Also, Mr. Herwick says, "the shift away from proprietary
systems to Unix systems in the workstation market is costing
DEC market share." That has hurt Unisys, too, says analyst
Stephen Cohen of SoundView Financial Group. He expects Unisys
to post a net loss of $46 million, or 29 cents a share, for
the quarter on lower revenue of $2.8 billion. A year earlier,
Unisys earned $34 million, or five cents a share, on revenue
of $2.97 billion.</p>
<p>Unisys is struggling because of a heavy debt load and
users defecting to open systems, Mr. Cohen says. "The old
core business is declining in profitability and the new
open-systems business they're growing to replace that with
has inherently lower margins," says Mr. Cohen.</p>
<p>Spending slowdowns in the security and banking industries
have hurt Cupertino, Calif.-based Tandem Computers Inc. more
than expected, says analyst John Jones of Montgomery
Securities. He recently lowered his earnings estimates for
the company and now expects net income in its fiscal first
quarter ending Monday to fall 74% to $8 million, or seven
cents a share, from $30.7 million, or 29 cents a share, a
year earlier. He sees sales rising 4.7% to $457 million from
$436.5 million.</p>
<p>A general slowdown in capital spending could be helping
Sunnyvale, Calif.-based Amdahl Corp., because its
IBM-compatible mainframes are less expensive than
International Business Machines Corp.'s own machines, Mr.
Jones says. He expects Amdahl's fourth-quarter net income to
rise 49% to $62 million, or 55 cents a share, from $41.6
million, or 38 cents a share, a year earlier. He expects
revenue to decline to $615 million from $625.8 million,
partly because of a product transition.</p>
<p>Armonk, N.Y.-based IBM, meanwhile, is expected to have a
respectable fourth quarter, in part because of the success of
its new air-cooled mainframes, says Mr. Cohen of SoundView.
He expects higher net income of $2.3 billion, or $4 a share,
vs. the year-earlier $591 million, or $1.04 a share,
including a $2.42 billion pretax charge. Mr. Cohen expects
sales of $22 billion vs. $20.4 billion last year. He says
IBM's introduction of ES/9000 computers last fall spurred
sales.</p>
