	<p class="article-leader">Your Nov. 19 Heard on the Street column said USF&G Corp.,
in its efforts to expand during the 1980s, ". . . bought
mutual funds and Citicorp's pension fund business." While
USF&G did buy Citicorp's domestic institutional investment
management business, it did not buy our pension-fund
business. Citibank remains one of the largest trustees and
custodians for private and public pension funds.
