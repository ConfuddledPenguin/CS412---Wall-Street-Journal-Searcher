	<p class="article-leader">THE ECONOMY CRUMBLES even faster than expected, private
analysts say.
   As recently as early this month, the Blue Chip consensus
forecast a 1.3% GNP drop for the current quarter. Now, Morgan
Stanley says the economy shrank at an annual rate of 3.6%;
Goldman Sachs says 4.4%. Even the more optimistic 2.1%
prediction by McGraw Hill/DRI would make the fourth-quarter
performance the worst since 1982.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The Fed defuses criticism by picking up the pace of its
interest-rate cuts; Congress now is likely to start bashing
banks for failing to cut the prime rate in response. "The
banks are reluctant to pass on the savings because of their
own problems," says Senate Banking Committee Chairman Riegle,
adding that they shouldn't "penalize current borrowers for
mistakes . . . that were the banks' fault."</p>
<p>The sour economy eats into tax revenues. Personal
income-tax receipts for October and November ran 3% behind
last year's; corporate receipts were down nearly 7%.</p>
<p>THE PENTAGON MULLS reducing supervision of contractors,
raising hackles.</p>
<p>One proposal envisions a 20% cut in overall federal audits
and on-site contract management personnel at aircraft
factories, missile plants and other facilities; companies
that improve their own internal vigilance would be rewarded
with a better shot at winning new government deals.</p>
<p>But following recent scandals, some lawmakers -- including
powerful Rep. Dingell -- push for more rather than less
supervision. The issue could dash the chances of Donald
Yockey, the Pentagon's acting acquisition chief, to get the
post in fact. He has been leading the campaign for reduced
policing, but critics say he has long disliked government
auditors.</p>
<p>BAKER'S CONCERNS extend from the Persian Gulf to the
Soviet Union.</p>
<p>The secretary of state plans to head abroad next month,
whether or not the meeting with Saddam Hussein comes off. He
will seek more money from Arabs and Germany. He will also
probably convene a session of the foreign ministers of the
five permanent U.N. Security Council countries to consider
how to enforce the Jan. 15 deadline for Iraqi withdrawal from
Kuwait.</p>
<p>In addition, Baker wants to see the Soviets, in Moscow or
elsewhere, for a firsthand account of the turmoil there. He
would prefer to hear it from departing foreign minister
Shevardnadze, whom he trusts. The two sides also need to
smooth out details of the planned Feb. 11 Bush-Gorbachev
summit and discuss Moscow's posture on the Jan. 15 U.N.
deadline.</p>
<p>Aide Dennis Ross will soon visit Israel, signaling Arabs
the U.S. still cares about the Palestinian problem despite
refusing to link it with the Gulf.</p>
<p>BUSH HOPES to name a new GOP chairman by early next week,
but problems abound with the short list of contenders:
Political consultant Rich Bond once worked for a liberal
congressman; former Texas Rep. Tom Loeffler's Contra stand
upset conservatives; New Mexico Gov. Garrey Carruthers pushed
for a tax increase. Transportation chief Skinner remains an
outside possibility.</p>
<p>BANKERS SCRAMBLE for an alternative to Seidman's proposal
to replenish the FDIC fund. The American Bankers Association
has a team of accountants devising a less-painful method than
his proposed onetime, 1%-of-deposits assessment. "It's all
going to be painful medicine, but we want to make sure we
don't overdose," says William Brandon, president of an
Arkansas bank.</p>
<p>HARVARD REFUSES -- as is its custom -- to extend leaves
beyond two years for several professors now serving as Bush
administration officials. White House policy chief Porter
resigns his endowed chair at the Kennedy School; Treasury
Undersecretary Glauber quits the business school.</p>
<p>GRUDGING GIFTS: Japan's Gulf crisis aid to "front-line"
states Egypt, Jordan and Turkey has strings attached. Some
low-interest loans are earmarked for specific construction
projects; others are tied to tough World Bank financial
conditions. That irks the Bush administration, but Treasury
boss Brady is loath to criticize Tokyo publicly.</p>
<p>IRAQ CLOUDS planning for Bush's State of the Union
address.</p>
<p>Cabinet members Thornburgh, Derwinski and Sullivan meet
with White House officials to discuss possible themes; aides
are also trolling for ideas, especially among Bush's
conservative critics. But with the Gulf situation,
speechwriters don't know how much space to devote to domestic
issues.</p>
<p>Despite all the complaints about a lack of direction in
domestic policy, some aides want to hold ideas back from the
address; Sununu thinks some legislation stands a better
chance with Congress -- and can make a bigger splash -- if
presented separately. A health initiative for the working
poor and uninsured may fall into this category.</p>
<p>So might the controversial national energy strategy,
though a White House official says scornfully that "there is
absolutely no event requiring an immediate decision" on it.</p>
<p>MINOR MEMOS: Bob Hope, irked at bureaucratic obstacles to
his Christmas shows for troops in the Gulf, called Bush
directly last week to speed up arrangements. . . . Rapping
Rep. Major Owens urges Bush to "just declare victory and dig
in/outlasting the enemy is not a sin." . . . Sen. Armstrong's
office sends out an up-to-date official biography of him,
dated Dec. 16; he leaves office next Thursday.</p>
