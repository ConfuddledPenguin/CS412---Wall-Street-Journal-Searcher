	<p class="article-leader">TOKYO -- Hitachi Ltd., a maker of computers and
semiconductors, said it started building a plant for mass
production of 16-megabit dynamic random-access memory, or
DRAM, chips. The construction cost and the plant's expected
output weren't disclosed. One megabit is equal to one million
units of digital information.
   The plant is next to Hitachi's four-megabit DRAM chip
plant in Ibaragi Prefecture northeast of Tokyo. Construction
is scheduled to be completed by the end of 1991 and chip
production is to start in 1992, a spokesmen said. Hitachi has
already begun mass production of four-megabit chips, which
are expected to become widely used starting next year.</p>

major makers of semiconductors in Japan, also announced the
start of construction on plants for mass production of
16-megabit DRAM chips.</p>
