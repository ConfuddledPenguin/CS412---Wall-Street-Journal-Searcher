	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- Assets of the nation's 533 money-market
funds fell $1.11 billion to a total $427.90 billion, in the
week ended Wednesday, according to the Investment Company
Institute, a Washington-based trade association.
   Assets of 267 general-purpose funds fell $226.3 million to
$150.41 billion and assets of 104 broker/dealer funds fell
$251.9 million to $166.02 billion. Assets of 162
institutional funds fell $627.6 million to $111.47 billion.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Assets of money-market funds didn't change significantly
in the general-purpose and broker/dealer categories, but
institutional assets fell moderately, after five consecutive
weeks of large increases, "probably in response to some
firming of short-term interest rates," said Jacob Dreyer,
vice president and chief economist at the institute.</p>
<p>Money-market mutual fund assets for the previous week
ended Dec. 19 were revised to $429.01 billion, and the
increase in assets was revised to $1 billion.</p>
