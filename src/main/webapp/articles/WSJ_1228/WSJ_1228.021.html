	<p class="article-leader">LONDON -- Isosceles PLC, the takeover vehicle created for
the 1989 leveraged buy-out of British grocery chain Gateway
Corp. PLC, has secured a debt-refinancing package including
as much as #237 million ($446.1 million) in fresh equity
capital.
   The refinancing, which has been under negotiation since
mid-1990, calls for the issue of 12.99 million new shares
based on units of values at #18.27 each. For every 30
ordinary shares held, 19 units will be issued.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Of the issue, #222 million has been underwritten by U.S.
investment boutique Wasserstein Perella & Co. and a
consortium of U.K. investors, including Isosceles creditors.</p>
<p>Under the share offering, Wasserstein Perella's stake in
Isosceles will rise to 40% from 19.9%, with the U.K.
consortium holding as much as 46.5% compared with its current
19.9% holding. The U.S. investment firm's contribution to the
refinancing is #115 million against #107 million from the
U.K. consortium led by Mercury Asset Management PLC, a fund
management unit of S.G. Warburg & Co.</p>
<p>Proceeds will be used to retire company debt, dropping its
total indebtedness to #1.2 billion from about #1.4 billion
presently.</p>
<p>Besides the fresh capital, creditors have also agreed to
reschedule payments on #592 million of senior debt initially
due in 1991 and 1992 to August 1996. Also, creditors agreed
to defer #48 million in interest due on subordinated debt
over the next two years.</p>
<p>Isosceles said it has also agreed to buy back about #87
million of the subordinated, or so-called mezzanine debt,
while mezzanine financers have agreed to waive certain equity
warrants held against the company.</p>
<p>U.K. merchant bank S.G. Warburg & Co. has also agreed to
provide Isosceles with #15 million in working capital once
shareholder approval of the refinancing plan is secured.</p>
<p>Other members of the U.K. consortium are: Standard
Chartered PLC, a major British commercial bank; 3i PLC, a
British investment firm owned by major British banks and the
Bank of England; Globe Venture Nominees Ltd., a fund
management group; and Murray Johnstone Ltd., a U.K.
investment firm.</p>
<p>Great Atlantic & Pacific Tea Co., the U.S. grocery chain
that was among the initial Isosceles investors at a 19.9%
stake, isn't participating in the fresh equity portion of the
refinancing, Isosceles said.</p>
