	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Bond prices jumped yesterday after the
government reported a record decline in orders for durable
goods.
   The bond market's bellwether 30-year Treasury bond ended
nearly 1/2 point higher, a gain of nearly $5 for a bond with
a $1,000 face amount. The issue's yield, which moves in the
opposite direction of its price, eased to 8.24% from 8.28% on
Wednesday.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Prices of tax-exempt municipal bonds, which usually lag
the Treasury market, posted strong gains with some general
obligation bonds issued by Massachusetts climbing as much as
one point. Traders attributed the rise in Massachusetts bonds
to short-covering, where dealers scramble to buy securities
to replace securities they borrowed at an earlier date.</p>
<p>There also was a flurry of buying in the investment-grade
corporate bond market, which helped to push prices between
1/4 and 3/8 point higher. Mortgage-backed securities rose
between 1/8 and 1/4 point.</p>
<p>The rally in the bond market was sparked by an extremely
weak economic report. The Department of Commerce reported
that orders for new durable goods plunged 10.5% last month,
offering further evidence that the economy is eroding.</p>
<p>The decline matched a record drop set last January and was
much deeper than the 2.2% decline that had been forecast by
economists surveyed by Dow Jones Capital Markets Report.</p>
<p>Bond investors react bullishly to bearish economic news
because slow economic growth often leads to lower interest
rates and lower inflation -- two trends that increase the
value of fixed-income securities.</p>
<p>The report also set a positive tone for the Treasury's
$8.57 billion auction of four-year notes.</p>
<p>The average yield set on the notes at yesterday's auction
was 7.66%, sharply lower than the 8.53% average yield at the
previous four-year note auction in September. The average
yield at yesterday's auction was lower than some analysts
expected and was even below the peak when-issued yield of
7.75% set Monday.</p>
<p>Traders said that prices of notes and bonds were little
changed after the Federal Reserve preannounced, unexpectedly,
that it will execute two-day system repurchase agreements on
Monday. That's a technical trading maneuver designed to add
reserves to the banking system.</p>
<p>Traders said the Fed made the unusual preannouncement in
an effort to relieve some of the pressures that have been
building in the federal funds market. The federal funds rate,
the rate at which banks charge each other for overnight
loans, hit 100% late Wednesday. The target for the rate is
7%.</p>
<p>Although the rate often gyrates on the last day of a
two-week bank settlement period, as was yesterday,
Wednesday's spike to 100% was widely viewed in the market as
the result of a serious miscalculation of bank funding needs
by the Federal Reserve.</p>
<p>While the Fed's announcement may have offered some relief
to the market, it still did not stop the Fed funds rate from
rising far above its target. The rate exceeded 10% yesterday
for some domestic transactions and was far higher on trades
involving some foreign banks.</p>
<p>Treasury Securities</p>
<p>The Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond ended at a price of
105 16/32, up from 105 1/32 on Wednesday. The issue's yield
fell to 8.24% from 8.28%.</p>
<p>Treasury bill rates were slightly higher. The discount
rate on three-month bills ended at 6.49% for a
bond-equivalent yield of 6.67%, up slightly from 6.48% to
yield 6.66% on Wednesday. The rate on six-month bills rose to
6.59% to yield 6.89% compared with 6.56% to yield 6.86% on
Wednesday.</p>
<p>Here are details of yesterday's four-year note auction:</p>
<p>Rates are determined by the difference between the
purchase price and face value. Thus, higher bidding narrows
the investor's return while lower bidding widens it.</p>
<p>                    Four-Year Notes</p>
<p>Applications                          $22,479,102,000</p>
<p>Accepted bids                          $8,569,307,000</p>
<p>Accepted at low price                             51%</p>
<p>Accepted noncompetitively                $643,000,000</p>
<p>Average price (Rate)                   99.881 (7.66%)
</p>
<p>Low price (Rate)                       99.847 (7.67%)</p>
<p>Interest rate                                  7 5/8%</p>
<p>The notes are dated Dec. 31, 1990 and mature Dec. 31,
1994.</p>
<p>Corporate & Junk Bonds</p>
<p>A flurry of retail buying enlivened the investment-grade
corporate bond market, injecting a dose of excitement into an
otherwise stultifying week.</p>
<p>Corporate bond traders said much of the buying was
concentrated in shorter-maturity corporates and high-quality
issues.</p>
<p>The buying was unexpected since investors typically sell
corporate bonds at year end to clean up their balance sheets
and remove tainted credits.</p>
<p>"This is the first time in a very long time we've gotten
year-end buying which is causing" yields to fall relative to
yields on Treasury securities, said Andrew Tarica, a
corporate bond trader at Kidder, Peabody & Co.</p>
<p>Mr. Tarica notes that Associates Corp. of North America's
9% five-year notes, which were trading at a yield of about
1.55 percentage points above the comparable Treasury issue
earlier this month, now trade at a spread of about 1.27
percentage points.</p>
<p>While high-grade corporate bonds ended between 1/4 and 3/8
point higher, junk bonds, or speculative-grade securities
with low credit ratings or no credit ratings at all, finished
only marginally higher.</p>
<p>Municipal Bonds</p>
<p>Municipal bonds ended unchanged to 3/8 higher, with some
issues up 1/2 to 1 point.</p>
<p>Among actively traded secondary issues, the New Jersey
Turnpike Authority's 7.20% securities of 2018 were 3/8
higher, at 99 for a return of 7.26%.</p>
<p>Mortgage-, Asset-Backed Securities</p>
<p>Mortgage securities ended higher.</p>
<p>Government National Mortgage Association 9% for January
delivery were up 7/32 at 99 4/32. Federal Home Loan Mortgage
Corp. Gold 9% issues and Federal National Mortgage
Association 9% issues were up 5/32 at 98 24/32 and 98 16/32,
respectively.</p>
<p>Traders said retail participation has ground to a halt
during the year-end holiday period, as accounts have long
closed their books for the year.</p>
<p>In the primary market, no new issues were announced.</p>
