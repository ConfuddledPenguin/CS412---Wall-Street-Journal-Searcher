	<p class="article-leader">Berkeley, Calif. -- Seven years after its Paris Opera
premiere, Olivier Messiaen's monumental, five-hour-long
religious opera/oratorio, "St. Francois d'Assise," was to
have had its first full American performance in Berkeley this
holiday season, conducted by Kent Nagano. But then the Los
Angeles Philharmonic decided it wanted to do a fully staged
version (to appear first at the 1992 Salzburg Festival), and
Mr. Nagano was persuaded to yield up the rights.
   What we got instead at Berkeley were three scenes (two
hours, with intermission) taken from the gigantic eight-scene
work: "The Kiss of the Leper," "The Stigmata" and "Death and
New Life," three episodes from the saint's life, like
Giotto's murals at Assisi, set to overpowering 20th-century
music. In one of the missing episodes (which was included in
the selection Seiji Ozawa conducted at Boston and New York in
1986), St. Francis preaches to the birds, for whom the
composer wrote some of the exotic ornithological music he so
loves. The feathered brothers and sisters respond to
Francis's sermon with a 40-minute explosion of their own.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>One of the reasons Mr. Messiaen's masterwork (which
resembles but surpasses his voluptuous "Turangalila Symphony"
of 1949) has been so rarely performed is that it calls for
such lavish resources. Filling every square inch of the
Zellerbach Hall stage, the Berkeley Symphony came up with the
required soloists, a chorus of 66 (the composer wanted 150),
and a total of 107 musicians. Five busy bangers on xylophone,
xylorimba, marimba, glockenspiel and vibraphone were squeezed
along the back wall. At the left, five percussionists, each
surrounded by his own cage of toys (like a mini-gamelan),
hammered, banged, chimed and rattled away at a total of 38
things. The Berkeley Symphony came up with the requisite
three Ondes Martenot, a kind of electronic sound-generator on
which the performer, seated at a tiny keyboard, can twist
single notes into strange and affecting shapes. The
composer's sister-in-law, Jeanne Loriod, flew over to help
fill out (and train) a complement of ondeurs.</p>
<p>Mr. Nagano, 39, who now directs the Lyon Opera as well as
the Berkeley Symphony, knows this work well; he has been
performing and promoting Messiaen for years; he assisted Mr.
Ozawa (his onetime mentor) at the world premiere; he has
conducted the full-length "St. Francois" in both London and
Lyon. The Berkeley Symphony isn't the London Philharmonic,
and the vocal resources of both soloists and chorus (the
Pacific Mozart Ensemble) were stretched. But the grandeur,
dazzling tone colors and endless variety of the work shone
through. James Wood, as St. Francis, lacked the ability to
soften or nuance a workman-like, not particularly warm
baritone; Susan Narucki was a properly celestial angel,
singing from odd places about the hall. Stephen Guggenheim as
the angry leper and David Cox as a fellow Franciscan were
fine in lesser roles.</p>
<p>But this is really the instrumentalists' show. They
generally shut up for the singers' lines, then answer them
clearly. The short choral numbers -- the voice of God, as
often as not -- are woven into the orchestral texture like
one more section or sound timbre. The music is often loud but
never ugly, listenable and tender to the senses, whether
dulcet or jangling. It pulses in short, discrete breaths that
feature and challenge different combinations of instruments
in turn; the marimba gang, the platoon of percussionists and
the shrieking, underlining ondes are almost perpetually at
work, defining the Messiaen "sound." The simple saint's life
story attains supernatural dimensions through Mr. Messiaen's
master manipulation of dynamics (including silence),
expressive chords and orchestral/choral voices. Between
bursts of orchestral brilliance, the soloists evoke good,
faithful 13th-century people who happen to live in an
astonishing world of sound. As St. Francis dies, the angel
tells him, "Today, in a few minutes, you will hear the music
of the invisible," and we do -- carillon chords, clusters of
birdsong, a stupendous finale. "Music and poetry have led me
to Thee," cries Francis, on behalf of the devout, 82-year-old
composer.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>The San Francisco Opera wound down a respectable if less
than triumphant season with a potent, somber revival of
Mussorgsky's "Khovanshchina" and a new production of
Monteverdi's "Il Ritorno d'Ulisse in Patria" that was vivid
and theatricalist, sometimes moving, sometimes overblown.</p>
<p>The 1641 Monteverdi was done in the Malipiero-Leppard
version, with its lush, dense, distinctly
non-17th-century-sounding score. No original orchestration
survives, so all performances of "Ulisse" depend on someone's
reconstruction. A month earlier, Alan Curtis had conducted a
sparsely staged, semi-amateur production of his new version
of the same opera at Berkeley. Opting for "authentic"
austerity, Mr. Curtis offered nothing beneath the declamatory
vocal line but a thin layer of plucked harpsichords and
lutes, a couple of small period organs and an occasional
flourish of bowed viols.</p>
<p>Though I balked now and then at the reedy organs and
twinkling harps in San Francisco, Edwardian Muzak in the pit,
on the whole I'll vote for the jazzier production. For two
things, it offered Thomas Hampson (singing his first Ulisse)
and Frederica von Stade, as the returning Homeric hero and
his ever-patient wife. He is tall, genuinely heroic, a
commanding vocal actor; she has never seemed in more absolute
control of that glorious voice, or more expressive of the
emotions it conveys.</p>
<p>Then, after pumping up the orchestra and pulling in the
stars, San Francisco imported Michael Hampe's
Salzburg/Cologne production, to make tolerable this 3
1/2-hour pageant of moral abstraction and classical mythology
-- with no arias] -- to 3,300 people a night, each paying $25
to $80. In Mr. Hampe's production, gods float or descend via
cloud-shaped ski-gondolas dangling from wires, or rise up
from the floor out of make-believe waves. (At the fifth
performance, which I saw, all this machinery worked
perfectly; earlier, stage lifts had refused to budge and gods
got stuck.) Monteverdi doesn't need all this, of course; but
17th-century Venetian audiences loved this sort of thing too,
so perhaps Mauro Pagano's elaborate sets and costumes could
be considered at least semi-authentic.</p>
