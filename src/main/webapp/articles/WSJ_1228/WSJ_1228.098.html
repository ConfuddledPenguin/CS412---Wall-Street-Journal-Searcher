	<p class="article-leader">The state insurance department said the New York State
Court of Appeals upheld a fine against a subsidiary of
American International Group for overcharging taxicab owners
on liability coverage.
   As a result, the AIG unit, Insurance Co. of the State of
Pennsylvania, based in New York, must pay $425,000, the
insurance department said.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>In May 1988, the subsidiary was fined for overcharging
taxicab mini-fleet owners about $1.4 million over a
three-year period, starting in 1981. The state insurance
department fined the unit for improperly using a liability
conversion factor to increase premiums and increasing
premiums without state approval.</p>
<p>AIG said the decision puts an end to the "old" case, but
questioned why the Court of Appeals, the state's highest
court, came to the decision without conducting a hearing.
"It's a shame," said Patrick Foley, AIG's general counsel.
"We feel the decision was wrong."</p>
