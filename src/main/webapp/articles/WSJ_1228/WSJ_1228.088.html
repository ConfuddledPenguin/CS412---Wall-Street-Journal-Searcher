acquired two million of its common shares, or an 8% stake,
for $5 million and committed $1 million to fund operations of
a gold-mining venture.
   The commitment represents the first stage of an agreement

stake in the venture by funding $25 million of operations and
aquiring four million Canyon Resources common shares for $10
million.</p>
