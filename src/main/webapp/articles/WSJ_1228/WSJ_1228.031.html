	<p class="article-leader">WEST CONSHOHOCKEN, Pa. -- U.S. Bioscience Inc. said it
received its first drug approval from the Food and Drug
Administration for Hexalen, an anti-cancer agent used in the
treatment of recurrent ovarian cancer.
   U.S. Bioscience officials hailed the drug's approval as a
significant step in the pharmaceutical company's development.
An FDA spokeswoman said the drug shows "significant
theraputic gains."</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Shareholders quickly reacted to news of the drug's
approval. In American Stock Exchange trading Thursday, U.S.
Bioscience closed at $19.875, up 87.5 cents. "We were pleased
to see that the market hadn't already discounted the drug's
approval," said Larry Longeacre, the company's chief
financial officer.</p>
<p>U.S. Bioscience said it plans to launch Hexalan, an agent
formerly known as Hexamethylmelamine, in the U.S. in late
January 1991. In addition, officials said the company plans
to file a product license application in the United Kingdom
in early 1991. It already has several agreements with other
companies for markets in Scandinavia, Eastern Europe,
Australia, New Zealand, Israel and Africa.</p>
<p>A company official said the cost of the drug for a five to
six month treatment runs about $1,000 per patient. U.S.
Bioscience said Hexalan has shown the ability to eliminate
evidence of tumors in cases where other treatments have
failed.</p>
<p>Originally formed as a subsidiary of U.S. Health Care,
U.S. Bioscience was spun off as an independent drug company
in 1987. In addition to Hexalen, the company currently has
nine other anti-cancer drugs in various stages of
development.</p>
