	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Over-the-counter stocks got off to a listless
start and never managed much forward momentum.
   The Nasdaq composite index ended the day down 1.35 points
to 371.05.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>For a while yesterday morning, OTC stocks were the only
ones trading. An overnight transformer fire in lower
Manhattan prevented operation of vital computers and kept the
New York, American and other regional exchanges from opening
at the appointed time.</p>
<p>The exchanges did open 90 minutes late, restrained by the
delay, holiday vacations and concerns about the economy and
possible war in the Middle East.</p>
<p>OTC stocks opened on time, made an early move higher,
wavered at midday, then slipped in the afternoon. National
Market System volume was light at 83.8 million shares but
still an improvement on Wednesday's very slow 57.4 million.</p>
<p>"It's just a lackluster market," said Charles Howley,
manager of OTC trading at Soundview Financial Group. Mr.
Howley said cautious investors were concerned about pressure
on profits at technology companies and trimmed some of those
stocks from their portfolios. Technology stocks often lead
the OTC market.</p>
<p>Intel fell 1/2 to 37. Apple Computer lost 1/4 to 43 1/2
and Novell was down 7/8 to 32 1/8.</p>
<p>Sun Microsystems dropped 3/4 to 22 1/8 and Microsoft
closed 1/4 lower at 74 3/4.</p>
<p>"The market doesn't seem to want to go down, but it
doesn't have a real reason to go up," said Nelson Gold,
senior vice president for OTC trading at Interstate-Johnson
Lane.</p>
<p>There were 939 OTC issues showing declines on the day and
824 that advanced.</p>
<p>Losses in the abbreviated New York Stock Exchange session
were worse than among OTC stocks. While the Nasdaq composite
index was down 0.36%, the New York Stock Exchange composite
index fell 1.12 points, or 0.62%, to 179.48. The Dow Jones
Industrial Average dropped 11.63 points, or 0.44%, to close
at 2625.50.</p>
<p>First Executive slipped 1/32 to close at 15/32 on news it
won't write new business in New Jersey until state regulators
there complete an analysis of the company's finances. New
Jersey regulators previously had demanded the troubled
insurer deposit $500 million with the state if it wanted to
continue to write business there.</p>
<p>First Executive has the largest short position of any OTC
stock. Nasdaq said late Wednesday that short interest in
First Executive was 5.8 million shares, down 5% from
November.</p>
<p>Short sellers sell borrowed shares in the hope they can
replace what they borrowed by buying shares later at a lower
price. Large short positions often are a bullish sign because
short sellers must buy shares to replace the borrowed shares
they already have sold.</p>
<p>Medco Containment Service saw its short interest jump to
2.3 million shares from 1.2 million in the past month. Medco
added 1 1/8 to 31 1/2 on heavy volume.</p>
<p>AST Research gained 5/8 to 34 3/4. This newspaper cited
AST as an example of a computer company able to carve out the
right market to resist an industry trend toward consolidation
and attrition. The story even suggested AST's growth is a
challenge to such computer celebrities as International
Business Machines and Compaq Computer.</p>
<p>Wet Seal shares were off 1 1/8 to 7 3/4 in active trading.
The fashion retailer late Wednesday disclosed disappointing
holiday sales and said analysts have overestimated its
earnings potential.</p>
<p>Nordstrom lost 3/4 to 22 1/4 amid concerns that this might
have been the worst holiday selling season in recent memory.</p>
<p>Loewen Group was down 3/8 to 21 1/2. The company, based in
British Columbia, said it is comfortable with estimates its
1990 earnings would improve to one Canadian dollar (86 U.S.
cents) to C$1.10 a share from 81 Canadian cents a year ago.</p>
<p>CoreStates Financial was 1/4 higher to 31 5/8 in active
trading. The stock was added to the Standard & Poor's
500-stock index this week.</p>
