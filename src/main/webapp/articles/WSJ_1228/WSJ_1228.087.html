	<p class="article-leader">INGLEWOOD, Calif. -- Thomas W. Gamel said he resigned as a
director of Hollywood Park Operating Co., a race track
operator that's in the midst of a proxy and legal battle.
   In a Dec. 26 letter attached to a filing with the
Securities and Exchange Commission, Mr. Gamel said he was
resigning because he had been "shut out of the board's
deliberations and decisions" by Chairwoman and Chief
Executive Officer Marjorie Everett and her supporters on the
board.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Mr. Gamel became a director last year after threatening
his own proxy fight and calling for the removal of Mrs.
Everett. He subsequently withdrew his rival slate when he was
offered a seat on the board, and agreed he wouldn't acquire
more stock while he remained a director. In August, Mr. Gamel
reported that he had a 5.6% stake in the company.</p>
<p>According to the SEC filing, Mr. Gamel delivered a proxy
and consent forms to investor Randall D. Hubbard, allowing
his shares to be voted in favor of Mr. Hubbard's proposal to
replace members of the board with Mr. Hubbard's own
eleven-person slate. The company has sued Mr. Hubbard,
claiming violations of the securities laws.</p>
<p>Mr. Gamel remains a director of Hollywood Park Realty
Enterprises Inc., a real estate investment trust that rents
out the track site and other property. The realty and
operating companies are managed separately, but their shares
are paired for trading in the national over-the-counter
market.</p>
<p>Spokesmen for Mr. Gamel and the company couldn't be
reached for comment.</p>
