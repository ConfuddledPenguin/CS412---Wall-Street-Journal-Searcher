	<p class="article-leader">TEL AVIV -- Cardiologist Eduard Zaslavsky and his wife,
Polina, an economist, were forced to stop buying food just
five weeks after moving from Kiev. Yet the two professionals,
whose public assistance had run out after paying the bills,
were too ashamed to join the growing number of new Soviet
immigrants who can be seen these days foraging for something
to eat amid garbage heaps at open markets in Jerusalem and
Tel Aviv.
   When the Zaslavsky's plight was broadcast on national
television, Israelis recoiled. Calls poured in to help the
Soviet couple. Relief came speedily in the form of jobs as
janitors to supplement their immigrant stipend.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The Zaslavsky story brought home to Israelis some painful
economic truths about Soviet immigration. It stripped away
any illusions that Israel, with its population of 4.7
million, can smoothly absorb -- or even pay for -- the one
million Soviet Jews who are expected to arrive over the next
few years.</p>
<p>The sheer volume of people fleeing the Soviet Union far
exceeds expectations and planning. Just yesterday Israeli
officials said the pace of Soviet immigration had picked up
to 2,000 people a day. It had been considered heavy at the
previous level of about 1,000 a day. Next year, 400,000 more
Soviets are expected, according to the Jewish Agency, a
quasi-governmental organization that assists immigration.
Israeli officials have attributed the surge to increasing
uncertainty about the political climate in the Soviet Union
and better Israeli-sponsored transportation arrangements.</p>
<p>The cost of transforming the have-not immigrant population
into productive Israelis is staggering. Finance Minister
Yitzhak Moda'i has estimated it will take $40 billion --
roughly equivalent to one year's budget -- to provide the
housing, language training, jobs and other services needed to
absorb the new arrivals.</p>
<p>"It is like the U.S. trying to absorb the whole population
of France in two or three years," says Michael Kleiner,
chairman of the Immigration and Absorption Committee of the
Knesset, Israel's parliament. "The Soviet immigration is the
greatest thing that could happen to Israel, but in terms of
sacrifice, it also has the potential to destroy us and tear
society apart."</p>
<p>Economists agree that immigration has long-term potential
to spur Israel's stagnant economy, partly with the influx of
Soviet professionals and scientists. But the short-term
forecasts are grim.</p>
<p>An unpublished Finance Ministry report on immigration
predicts there will be no available housing by March. By
spring, the number of homeless could total 140,000. This
means that even the temporary housing supply, including
mobile homes, hostels and hotels, will soon dry up. The
report also warns that if jobs aren't created quickly, the
current 10.2% unemployment rate could double by 1992.</p>
<p>Natan Sharansky, president of the Soviet Jewry Zionist
Forum, is a vocal critic of the right-wing government for its
failure to make provisions to avert a potential economic and
social disaster. Israel's budget for 1990 to 1991 was built
on the assumption that 40,000 Soviet Jews would arrive this
year, a fourth of the actual number. Next year's budget is
based on the expected arrival of 300,000 Soviets. But twice
that number could arrive.</p>
<p>Critics say the most glaring sign of government
foot-dragging is its reaction to housing needs. This year,
less than half of the planned 40,000 construction starts were
initiated. There is growing resignation that next year tent
cities will spring up to accommodate immigrants.</p>
<p>When the government announced a cost-cutting plan to slash
by $1,500 the $9,000 one-year package of subsidies new
immigrant families receive, Mr. Sharansky warned of an
"impending catastrophe." Some argue that Mr. Sharansky
overstated the case with his prediction that social tensions
could explode in a "civil war" in Israel. Last summer, 2,000
Israeli families were left homeless by high housing costs,
boosted by the surge in immigration. Memories are still fresh
of the violent demonstrations that took place then.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Israelis are being called on to dig more deeply
into their pockets to foot the immigration bill. Bank
Hapaolim Chairman Eitan Berglas estimates that "the standard
of living will be frozen at current levels in Israel for five
years." Others forecast a sharp decline.</p>
<p>Next year's proposed $33.23 billion budget includes a 5%
surcharge on already steep income taxes, and a
two-percentage-point rise in value-added tax. Israel's
massive defense budget also faces cuts; for the first time,
it will be less than expenditures for immigration. This will
only provide a fraction of necessary financing.</p>
<p>"There is no reasonable way for us to collect the money we
need," says Mr. Kleiner. He notes that the combined revenues
from proposed tax increases, contributions by world Jewish
organizations and a U.S. commitment for a $400 million
guaranteed loan for housing adds up to only 4% of the total
needed.</p>
<p>Mr. Berglas says the government's initial hope to raise
half the $40 billion abroad through Israeli banks is
unrealistic. In light of the Gulf situation, the Palestinian
uprising and a world-wide credit crunch, "We thought it was
necessary to say don't rely on us, it's impossible," he says.</p>
<p>One possible source of financing, he suggests, could be an
accelerated privatization of state-owned utilities, airlines,
commercial banks and other activities. It's estimated that as
much as $8 billion could be raised this way.</p>
<p>But for Mr. Berglas, the bigger economic picture isn't
entirely bleak. In 1991 he forecasts a doubling of the
economic growth rate to between 8% and 10%. Mr. Berglas is
enthusiastic about the immigrants. More than half the Soviet
newcomers have academic, technical, medical or scientific
training. So far, only a small portion of professionals have
found work in their field.</p>
<p>"These kinds of people provide extraordinary potential for
economic development," Mr. Berglas says.</p>
