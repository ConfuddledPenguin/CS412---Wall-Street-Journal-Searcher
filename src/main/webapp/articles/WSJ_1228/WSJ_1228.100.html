	<p class="article-leader">Albert Fisher Group PLC of Britain, a food distribution
company, said it bought the European frozen-vegetable and
seafood operations of Campbell Soup Co., Camden, N.J., for
#15 million ($28.2 million).
   Albert Fisher said the purchase covers Campbell's
Freshbake frozen-vegetable operations in Britain and its
seafood operations in Britain and Belgium.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Campbell's chief executive officer, David Johnson, said,
"This sale results from our strategic decision to focus our
European efforts on branded value-added prepared foods."
Campbell said the sale also is a major step in the
restructuring and divestiture program the company announced
earlier this year.</p>
<p>Albert Fisher said the acquisition is an important step in
developing the company's European food-processing and
distribution operations. It said Campbell's frozen-vegetable
assets, when combined with Albert Fisher's operations, will
form the largest frozen-vegetable business in Britain. Money
for the purchase came from cash reserves, Albert Fisher said.</p>
