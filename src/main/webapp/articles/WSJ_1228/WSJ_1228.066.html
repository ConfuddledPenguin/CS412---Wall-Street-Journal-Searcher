	<p class="article-leader">HOUSTON -- Gasoline pump prices plunged an average of
nearly nine cents a gallon over the last week and could drop
a bit more because of weakening demand and excess supplies.
   The decline in the average price of selfservice regular
unleaded is the biggest decline since the Iraqi invasion of
Kuwait Aug. 2. Gasoline fell 8.9 cents a gallon to $1.28 in
the week ended yesterday, according to a survey by the
American Automobile Association.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"Gasoline is finally coming under the pressure of lower
crude prices," said Thomas Manning, a vice president of
Purvin & Gertz Inc., a Houston-based oil consulting firm.
Crude prices have dropped from their peak of more than $40 in
October to finish yesterday at $27.01 a barrel in trading on
the New York Mercantile Exchange. "Gasoline prices were slow
to come down" in response to falling crude prices, Mr.
Manning acknowledged.</p>
<p>In fact, an AAA spokesman in Orlando, Fla., noted that
gasoline wholesale prices have been falling for at least a
month, but dealers weren't passing along the reduction to
drivers. "To our mind this price drop was overdue," he said.</p>
<p>"This follows historical trends," the AAA spokesman said.
"We had very rapid increases in the prices of fuel following
the Exxon Valdez spill and then it took many months for
prices to come down."</p>
<p>Some oil companies also suggested the slow downward
movement in retail prices isn't their fault. "We don't set
pump prices," said a spokesman for Chevron Corp. in San
Francisco. The company began cutting the price it charges its
dealers in mid-November, he said. Chevron, like other major
oil companies, does own and operate some gasoline stations,
but the spokesman said prices at those outlets are based on
local competition.</p>
<p>Oil company officials have previously maintained that
gasoline prices wouldn't fall sharply because they never went
up proportionately as much as crude did.</p>
<p>While gasoline prices fell last week, they are still about
21 cents a gallon higher than before the invasion.
Nationally, the latest price includes a nickel-a-gallon
increase in the federal gasoline tax that went into effect
this month.</p>
<p>The post-invasion peak of $1.39 a gallon was hit the week
of Dec. 4, right after the new tax was levied. Prices could
fall further, barring a Persian Gulf war. "Gasoline demand
has been down, mostly as a result of the higher prices," the
Chevron spokesman said. Mr. Manning of Purvin & Gertz
estimates that gasoline demand in 1990 may have declined as
much as 0.5% and could be sluggish in 1991, too. "Next year
isn't going to be good for gasoline demand," he said. "The
weak economy cuts it down."</p>
<p>In addition, gasoline inventories are high, putting more
downward pressure on prices. The American Petroleum Institute
yesterday reported that while gasoline inventories fell a bit
last week, they were 1.9 million barrels ahead of last year's
levels.</p>
<p>"There's an awful lot of crude on the market, too," Mr.
Manning noted. "All the (price) pressures are pointing down,"
he said. The only upward pressure remains the possibility of
war in the Middle East.</p>
