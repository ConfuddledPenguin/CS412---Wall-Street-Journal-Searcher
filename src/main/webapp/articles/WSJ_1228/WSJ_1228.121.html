	<p class="article-leader">MOSCOW (AP) -- Russia's finance minister has resigned,
saying the largest and richest Soviet republic has made no
progress in the transition to a market economy, the Russian
legislature's newspaper reported.
   Boris Fyodorov, 33 years old, was quoted as telling
Rossiiskaya Gazeta that lawmakers in the Russian republic
have been unwilling to take responsibility for necessary but
unpopular measures, such as lifting artificial price
controls.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Mr. Fyodorov told the newspaper that important decisions,
such as forming private companies, setting up a stock market
and bringing Russian accounting practices in line with
international norms, "get bogged down in the depths of the
apparatus . . . for months on end."</p>
<p>"This is a shortcut to financial bankruptcy for the
republic and for the {Soviet} Union as a whole," he said.</p>
<p>On Nov. 1, the Russian Federation began a program to
switch from a centrally planned, command economy to a free
market within 500 days. Russian lawmakers said they wanted to
move faster than the national government, but critics contend
their policies often conflict and create confusion rather
than reform.</p>
