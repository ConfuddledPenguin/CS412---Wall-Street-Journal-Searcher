	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- In the secretive world where international
politics meets money, Jacques de Groote is a man of
influence.
   Suave and erudite, Mr. de Groote is a senior executive
director of both the World Bank and the International
Monetary Fund -- a bridge between developed and developing
nations. He involves himself in the affairs that he chooses,
rendering advice as he sees fit while helping to channel the
$25 billion or so in international aid the organizations
annually dispense. It is a position of much autonomy, with
wide freedom from interference and scrutiny.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The 63-year-old Mr. de Groote, who is paid a tax-free
$119,000 a year, lives in a style that suggests substantial
wealth. He has long been something of a bon vivant, with a
taste for the finest in clothes, restaurants and residences.
He has a $1 million house in the Georgetown section of
Washington, a $2 million working farm in Italy and a $1
million apartment in Brussels. "De Groote is an eccentric,"
says a friend, Hugues Leclercq, a professor in Brussels. "He
will go to a shop and buy 20 shirts, six pairs of shoes,
flashy ties. He loves the finer things in life."</p>
<p>By his own admission, Mr. de Groote has at times been
hard-pressed for cash. In July, in fact, a court in his
native Belgium said that he was "facing serious financial
problems." Today, he acknowledges debts totaling $1 million.</p>
<p>Once Mr. de Groote needed a small, tide-me-over loan; he
went to the owner of a brewery in Zaire whom he also counsels
on World Bank policy. Another time he needed big money; he
turned to the head of a mining operation in Rwanda who at the
time was seeking help from the IMF and World Bank.</p>
<p>Mr. de Groote also has long advised Zaire and its
president, Mobutu Sese Seko, even though Zaire isn't one of
the countries he officially represents. His relationship has
included informing Zaire, a major recipient of IMF and World
Bank aid over the years, about the organizations'
confidential strategy for granting future aid. Mr. de Groote
acknowledges that these ties have provoked suspicions he was
on Mr. Mobutu's payroll.</p>
<p>Mr. de Groote says these suspicions are false. He says
that he has never used his position for personal gain, and
that there is "no relation whatsoever" between his official
positions and his personal finances.</p>
<p>Mr. de Groote's activities do not appear to violate any
policies at the World Bank and IMF. "We don't have any rules
in writing for executive directors," says Francois Gianviti,
IMF general counsel. "We have no code of ethics in writing
for executive directors." World Bank president Barber Conable
adds that a 1954 bank resolution only requires a director to
disclose any "substantial" personal interest in a matter
before the bank, though he says he would feel compelled to
urge a director's constituent countries to investigate any
allegations of improprieties.</p>
<p>The lack of formal guidelines at these powerful
organizations, and the secrecy with which they conduct their
business, seem almost an invitation to engage in conflicts of
interest. They may also bear on a frequent complaint of
critics: That corrupt regimes still manage to get generous
aid from the IMF and World Bank -- institutions whose aid is
much-coveted in these times of tight capital. Zaire is often
cited in this connection. The African nation owes the IMF and
World Bank more than $1.6 billion, yet President Mobutu has
become one of the world's wealthiest men, reputedly a
billionaire.</p>
<p>Mr. de Groote, Zaire's longtime adviser, explains that
corruption is simply a way of life there. "Mobutu is corrupt,
of course," says Mr. de Groote. Only corruption, he says,
could explain how many Zairean officials "drive Mercedes,
have luxurious apartments in Europe, send their children to
the best private schools and take two-month holidays." (Mr.
Mobutu has publicly denied plundering his country but didn't
respond to written questions for this article.)</p>
<p>Mr. de Groote has served Zaire off and on, officially and
unofficially, for 20 years. In 1967, it was he, then a young
economist, who urged the strife-torn Congo to adopt "zaire"
as the name of its new currency. The word means river or big
water, Mr. de Groote explains, and "I thought it would be a
kind of unifying factor." Four years later the country took
"Zaire" as its name.</p>
<p>Mr. de Groote, son-in-law of a former Belgian foreign
minister, was an official of the National Bank of Belgium and
chief economic adviser to the Zairean national bank. He
designed a Zairean economic overhaul, of which he says the
IMF was "the cornerstone." At one point Mr. de Groote was
ordered out of Zaire for giving tough economic advice. But by
the late 1970s, after he had joined the boards of the IMF and
the World Bank, he was back to advising the Mobutu regime.</p>
<p>In precisely what capacity was Mr. de Groote serving his
old friend and client? The answer is fraught with ambiguity.</p>
<p>Mr. de Groote's official duties at the IMF and World Bank
involve Belgium, several other European nations and Turkey;
other directors are responsible for Zaire. Yet when business
involving Zaire has come up, Mr. de Groote has often involved
himself. This is because of his personal commitment to the
country, he explains, as well as the long, historic ties
between Zaire and Belgium.</p>
<p>When he has corresponded with Zairean leaders, Mr. de
Groote has done so on the agencies' stationery. When he has
drawn up reports on Zaire, he has used the staff and
stationery of the IMF and World Bank. But he has flown in and
out of the country at Zaire's expense.</p>
<p>In 1982 and 1983, the IMF cut off Zaire's funding because
of economic mismanagement. Mr. de Groote says that he
personally urged Mr. Mobutu to rein in his personal spending
and to increase taxes -- "highly unpopular advice."</p>
<p>But he went much further than rendering advice.</p>
<p>In an April 1983 letter to Kengo wa Dondo, then Zaire's
prime minister, Mr. de Groote disclosed what he knew about
the confidential negotiating strategy that other IMF
officials were developing for Zaire. His purpose, he wrote,
was to share the views of "the higher echelons of the IMF and
the World Bank." At the time, a group of IMF staffers was
preparing a visit to Zaire, and their negotiating
instructions, he wrote, had been "given to no one, apart from
the team of negotiators."</p>
<p>He listed the economic measures the negotiators would
expect Zaire to take, predicting that compliance would free
up $246 million from the fund -- precisely the amount
approved eight months later.</p>
<p>He even pointed out that the finance ministry of his own
country, a major creditor to Zaire, would be "very reluctant"
about some aspects of the program. But not to worry, he
reported: A top foreign-affairs official in Belgium who
happened to be a good friend of Mr. de Groote was "exerting a
very useful influence to obtain a political decision"
favorable to Zaire.</p>
<p>Mr. de Groote insists that what he did for Zaire was no
different "than anything I write for other countries" he
represents.</p>
<p>In a series of interviews, Mr. de Groote is remarkably
blunt about the rumors swirling around him. He acknowledges
that even at the World Bank and the IMF, some believe that he
has acted as a paid Mobutu agent. He attributes such
allegations to false "street talk" spread by Mr. Mobutu's
opponents in Zaire and in Belgium, where he reports to
banking authorities. "I am not a money man," he says. "If I
wanted to obtain money, I could have done it very easily in
Zaire; I'm sure they would give me money." He adds: "I am not
a Mobutu agent."</p>
<p>Nevertheless, in Belgium, the suspicions have taken a
toll. In the fall of 1980, for instance, there was talk in
Brussels of Mr. de Groote's possible appointment to the
managing board of Belgium's national bank, which might have
led to his becoming national bank governor. But according to
people familiar with the events, one board member, Roland
Beauvois, told a secret board meeting of being informed by a
high Zairean official that the official had made payments to
Mr. de Groote for Mr. Mobutu.</p>
<p>The allegations, coupled with political considerations
involving Mr. de Groote's Franco-Flemish background, caused
his name to be withdrawn. Mr. de Groote says he wasn't
interested in the post anyway, and attributes the controversy
to bad blood between himself and Mr. Beauvois.</p>
<p>Mr. de Groote was also mentioned in 1982 for the
governorship of the Belgian central bank. But this time
another problem arose: his personal finances. "I told Jacques
he would not get it," recalls his friend Mr. Leclercq. "He
was late on his debts."</p>
<p>Mr. de Groote could, however, tap an old connection in
such lean times. That was Baron Jean-Louis van den Branden,
whose Belgian mining and real-estate company, Geomines,
operated in Zaire as well as in the African nation of Rwanda,
and which boasted advisers including prominent European and
U.S. political figures. About a decade ago, Mr. de Groote
obtained a short-term, unsecured loan of about $50,000 (at
today's exchange rates) from Banque Nagelmackers 1747 SA,
where Baron van den Branden did some business and where,
within two years, he would become chairman. Did Mr. van den
Branden, his friend of 35 years, arrange the loan? "Oh, yes,
absolutely," Mr. de Groote says. Mr. van den Branden insists,
however, that he merely gave Mr. de Groote "advice on who to
see" at the bank.</p>
<p>To this day, Mr. de Groote hasn't retired the bank debt,
which has grown with interest to about $150,000. Frustrated,
the bank obtained an order last July from the Court of the
First Instance in Brussels preventing Mr. de Groote from
selling his $1 million duplex apartment in Brussels before he
repays the debt.</p>
<p>Mr. de Groote maintains he isn't in financial distress.
Besides his total income of $119,000 from the IMF and World
Bank, he says he also shares income of about $120,000 with
his wife, who, he adds, will inherit money soon.</p>
<p>Mr. de Groote, who lives apart from his wife, acknowledges
a reputation as one who enjoys varied female companionship
and concedes that his lavish life style has drawn the concern
of friends. "I certainly had a number of women in my life. .
. . I had stormy liaisons with well-known ladies, and it was
a matter of worry for some of my friends that I would not
manage my financial business with care," he says. As for the
bank loan, "I don't worry about that bank," he says. "I will
pay them when it suits me" -- soon, he says.</p>
<p>The bank's managing director, Baudouin Nagelmackers, says
of Mr. de Groote: "He will say, `I have money coming from
Italy, I have money coming from here, coming from there.'
He's interested in art -- paintings -- and he'll say, `I am
going to sell this piece of art, that piece of art.'"</p>
<p>Mr. de Groote has other bank debts as well. Mr.
Nagelmackers says he has learned, under a Belgian banking
procedure, that Mr. de Groote owes more than $300,000 to
other Belgian banks. He says his bank delayed taking legal
action against Mr. de Groote because it feared that the
Belgian national bank, to which Mr. de Groote officially
reports, "would take action against us -- put auditors on
us." But a few years ago, he says, he finally complained to
the central bank governor.</p>
<p>"Normally, if I see what he is earning, he should easily
be able to pay back," Mr. Nagelmackers says. "But he lives in
high style: a villa in Italy, an apartment in Brussels, a
house in Washington."</p>
<p>Besides helping Mr. de Groote get this long-unpaid bank
loan, Baron van den Branden has assisted him in other ways,
helping Mr. de Groote turn his Georgetown home into cash in a
transaction that also allowed him to continue living in it.</p>
<p>"I badly needed money," Mr. de Groote recalls. "I said one
day to him {the baron}, `Since I do not wish to go to a bank,
do you have a way for me to mobilize liquidity?' He said, `I
will find a way out.'" The upshot was that in early 1982, Mr.
de Groote sold his Georgetown home to a Panamanian company,
Mapagico S.A., bringing in $380,000. Mr. de Groote says it
was agreed he could rent the house and ultimately repurchase
it at market value.</p>
<p>When questioned, Mr. de Groote initially identified the
owner of Mapagico as Mr. van den Branden. And he says he knew
the Swiss managing director of Mapagico as someone "involved
in some of van den Branden's business." But the baron insists
he neither bought the house nor had anything to do with the
outfit that did. He says he simply recalls referring the
matter to his top finance man at Geomines, now deceased.</p>
<p>In any case, the deal worked for Mr. de Groote. In July
1987 he repurchased the house for $550,000 -- $40,000 below
Mapagico's official appraisal, and a price representing
annual appreciation of only about 8% despite a red-hot
Washington real-estate market. Mr. de Groote now values the
house at $1 million.</p>
<p>Mr. de Groote assisted the baron at about the same time of
the house deal. In 1982 Mr. van den Branden was seeking
roughly $30 million in financing from a World Bank affiliate
for his Rwanda mining operation. The company, which was in
partnership with the government of Rwanda, was struggling for
cash.</p>
<p>That's where Mr. de Groote came in. "He was trying to help
us as much as he could at the World Bank," says a former
Geomines director, Bernard van Ommeslaghe. "He helped us to
make the proper introductions to find our way within that
large organization for the loan."</p>
<p>Mr. de Groote says he can't procure a World Bank loan for
anyone. He acknowledges opening doors for Geomines but says
it is the same service he gives to any Belgian company. (Mr.
van den Branden, in fact, did not get the World Bank credit.)</p>
<p>Mr. de Groote says that in 1982 Mr. van den Branden also
began "pestering" him to press the Rwandan government to
devalue its franc, a move that would have generated more
local currency for the cash-strapped company. Mr. de Groote's
official duties at the IMF and World Bank don't include
Rwanda, any more than they include Zaire. But he got
involved, because, he says, Rwanda was without an IMF
executive director at the time and Rwandan officials asked
him to serve as its unofficial representative.</p>
<p>In a March 1982 letter to Rwandan President Juvenal
Habyarimana, Mr. de Groote cited the need to increase exports
of tin, which were managed by Mr. van den Branden's company.
He notified him that the IMF was about to recommend a
devaluation, a position behind which he was throwing his own
endorsement. He also visited Rwanda urging devaluation.</p>
<p>Mr. de Groote says today that he was acting not at the
behest of Mr. van den Branden but at the request of one
official in Rwanda, the central bank governor. Officials in
Belgium also favored a devaluation, he says, adding, "It is
unfortunate . . . that I had to defend an idea" that Mr. van
den Branden happened to be promoting. (Rwanda finally
devalued the franc about 5%, though this was far less than
Mr. de Groote sought.)</p>
<p>Baron van den Branden ultimately stumbled. In 1985 he
resigned as chairman of the bank that lent $50,000 to Mr. de
Groote, and Geomines finally succumbed to bankruptcy
proceedings in Brussels.</p>
<p>Mr. de Groote has turned elsewhere to borrow funds. In
1986, Michel Relecom, a Brussels businessman with extensive
brewery and agricultural interests in Zaire, lent him $4,000.
"He needed immediately the money and he repaid it by check a
couple weeks later," Mr. Relecom recalls. He is open about
the fact that Mr. de Groote over the years had provided him
advice on World Bank policy, but he says that had nothing to
do with the loan.</p>
<p>Mr. de Groote's more recent activities in Africa have once
again focused on his old client, Mr. Mobutu.</p>
<p>He counseled Mr. Mobutu on IMF business at the ruler's
villa in the south of France in August 1986. He traveled to
Zaire in March 1987 to discuss Zaire's tattered relations
with the IMF, helping to repair ties. And in June 1989,
despite worsening Zairean corruption, government misspending
and economic decay, Mr. de Groote began promoting yet another
IMF undertaking being planned with Zaire. The board approved
the plan, and before long another $211 million in loans was
on its way to the African nation.</p>
<p>Within months, alas, the reform program was a shambles.
Mr. Mobutu was again spending too much on himself and not
enough on his impoverished country. Under IMF and World Bank
regulations, the spigot was closed.</p>
<p>Today, Zaire's economy is crumbling amid food riots and
inflation. Mr. Mobutu's days in power may be numbered,
according to Mr. de Groote and others. But Mr. de Groote says
that the bank and the fund needn't apologize for helping to
keep Mr. Mobutu in power for this long. "We work with
imperfect data sometimes, imperfect political systems, highly
imperfect local people sometimes," he says. "But we {try} to
make the most out of it."</p>
