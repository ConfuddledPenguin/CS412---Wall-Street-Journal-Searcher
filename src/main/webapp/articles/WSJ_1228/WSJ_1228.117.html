	<p class="article-leader">ROSEMEAD, Calif. -- SCEcorp said the Justice Department's
antitrust division filed a brief criticizing a Federal Energy
Regulatory Commission judge's ruling rejecting SCE's proposed
merger with San Diego Gas & Electric Co.
   FERC administrative law judge George P. Lewnes last month
rejected the proposed $2.56 billion merger as "monopolistic"
and "anti-competitive." But in its brief filed yesterday, the
antitrust division of the Justice Department said Judge
Lewnes's decision was based in part on "misperception and
misapplication" of Justice Department merger guidelines. It
added that the two companies "have shown that the benefits
outweigh the costs of the merger."</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>SCE filed its own brief with the energy commission, citing
agreements it has reached with the Justice Department "that
would adequately resolve all competition issues posed by the
merger."</p>
<p>Judge Lewnes and FERC spokesmen couldn't immediately be
reached for comment.</p>
