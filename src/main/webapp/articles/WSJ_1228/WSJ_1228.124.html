	<p class="article-leader">An electrical explosion shut down the New York Stock
Exchange for an hour and a half yesterday morning, prompting
the Securities and Exchange Commission to order a temporary
trading halt at all U.S. stock exchanges.
   But some brokerage firms and large institutions
sidestepped the SEC's efforts to halt all trading, bypassing
the exchanges and continuing to buy and sell stocks directly
with large clients.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The incident was a graphic demonstration of how stock
trading is increasingly moving beyond the control of federal
regulators and stock exchanges into less regulated markets.
"If I wanted to trade, I could trade; there was nothing
stopping me," said one institutional trader.</p>
<p>Many brokers assailed what they deemed were mixed signals
from the SEC, which, while moving quickly to shut down
trading to protect small investors, was less forceful -- and
less successful -- in preventing trading by large
institutions that can trade off the exchanges through
brokerage firms or electronic networks.</p>
<p>Following yesterday's confusion, the SEC launched a review
of its policy on off-exchange trading of listed stocks during
failures in the trade-reporting system. The review could lead
to a change in the agency's traditional view that all
domestic trading in listed stocks should halt when an
operational failure blocks the broad dissemination of price
and volume data.</p>
<p>The trouble started shortly after midnight yesterday when
a transformer exploded in lower Manhattan in front of 55
Water Street, the building where the New York and American
stock exchanges' computer nerve center, the Securities
Industry Automation Corp., or SIAC, is located.</p>
<p>SIAC processes stock prices quotations from all of the
nation's major exchanges and puts out a consolidated tape of
prices for all exchange-listed stocks. In November 1989, an
electrical fire closed down SIAC and the Big Board for nearly
2 1/2 hours. SIAC is building a backup computer facility in
New York that won't be completed for about a year.</p>
<p>Yesterday's explosion blew out windows on some floors of
the building, and aroused fears of chemical contamination
from polychlorinated biphenyls, or PCBs, which are used in
electrical transformers.</p>
<p>A Big Board spokesperson said none of the SIAC computers
was damaged, and SIAC had full power and was ready to operate
for the opening at 9:30 a.m. EST. But a PCB inspection by
city officials kept SIAC, and thus the exchanges, closed
until 11 a.m.</p>
<p>That didn't stop Wall Street traders. Around 9:30 a.m.,
several securities firms -- among them Donaldson, Lufkin &
Jenrette; Shearson Lehman Brothers and Montgomery Securities
-- began to notify clients they were ready to make markets.
Jefferies & Co., a firm that specializes in off-exchange
stock trading, also said it was ready to handle client
orders.</p>
<p>All of these firms bypassed stock exchanges to trade
directly with clients in what traders call the "third
market." Meanwhile, Reuters Holdings PLC's Instinet unit, an
electronic system that matches stock trades, also was active.</p>
<p>The Midwest Stock Exchange in Chicago said it, too, was
prepared to open its market to trade Big Board stocks. Six
months ago, the Midwest quietly negotiated an agreement with
Quotron Systems Inc. to post its quotes so it could sidestep
the SIAC system during times of trouble.</p>
<p>But the SEC called a trading halt at all U.S. stock
exchanges, including the Midwest. Traders at several
brokerage firms said they received calls from the SEC
indicating that the commission didn't want them to conduct
trading for clients while the exchanges remained closed. An
SEC spokeswoman said the commission "suggested" that
Jefferies refrain from trading. The SEC acted to restrain
third-market trading under its interpretation of its
responsibility to maintain orderly markets.</p>
<p>Some traders were relieved. "Thank God the SEC did not
give the regional {exchanges} the opportunity to open," said
Charles B. Milligan, co-director of PaineWebber's stock
department. He worried that if the regional exchanges opened
with the Big Board closed, customers would question if they
had received the best price when buying or selling stocks.
Nevertheless, PaineWebber was prepared to trade on the
regional exchanges if the pricing appeared rational, he said.</p>
<p>But the SEC's action angered the Midwest exchange. "We
were very disappointed," said Charles Doherty, the Midwest's
president. "We had a large numbers of customers that were
ready to trade at {9:30 a.m. EST}, and I assume they went to
the third market or London."</p>
<p>He added: "I think the Commission may not have appreciated
the situation this morning."</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Shearson and Donaldson Lufkin, after
discussions with the SEC, decided that existing securities
regulations prevented them from "crossing" trades -- or
matching customers' buy and sell orders -- in the U.S. while
exchanges were temporarily shut.</p>
<p>But the firms concluded that they could trade with clients
directly by risking the firms' own money.</p>
<p>Consequently, several thousand shares of stock traded
before the Big Board opened. For example, according to
trading records, about 40,000 shares of Toys "R" Us Inc.
traded in the third market at $22.50 each. More than 25,000
shares of General Electric Co., and more than 75,000 shares
of Chemical Waste Management Inc., traded in the third market
before the opening.</p>
<p>While trading was halted on exchange-listed stocks, the
Nasdaq trading system, where traders buy and sell
over-the-counter stocks on electronic screens, was up and
running.</p>
<p>Acknowledging the confusion, the SEC said it will review
yesterday's events in light of existing securities rules.
"Historically, we thought it was clear that trades didn't
occur in the U.S. when the markets were down," said Richard
Ketchum, director of the SEC's division of market regulation.
"We're going to review that to see whether it should be
changed."</p>
<p>The goal of the review is to "make sure there's a clear
understanding whether or not one can do institutional trades
in the U.S." when the market-information system is down, Mr.
Ketchum said.</p>
<p>"Our main desire is that next time to make sure that the
rules of the road are absolutely clear."</p>
<p>The keystone of U.S. securities law is the requirement
that information be equally available to all market
participants. Normally, third-market firms funnel information
on their trades into SIAC, where it joins a stream of price
and volume information from trades on the exchanges to give a
full picture of market activity for each exchange-listed
stock. With SIAC down, the SEC feared it would be impossible
to collect accurate market data.</p>
<p>But third-market firms deal only with large institutional
clients -- those deemed to be sophisticated enough to take
the risk of trading on incomplete market information. "None
of the firms wanted to do retail trading" with small
investors, Mr. Ketchum said.</p>
<p>Big Board President Richard Grasso said it appears that
brokerage firms were operating within securities laws when
they traded off the exchange yesterday. But "without the
primary market," he said, there wasn't competitive pricing of
stocks. "So the customer is really in a {buyer beware}
situation."</p>
<p>The SEC's Mr. Ketchum said, "Everybody operated in good
faith in a time when there was confusion. Some of the firms
operated initially on the thought that they would try to
provide a marketplace for their institutional customers. We
had no problem with that."</p>
<p>The outcome of the SEC's review is far from clear, because
yesterday's difficulties raised several fundamental questions
about how modern markets should function. The issues include:</p>
<p>-- Is it fair to allow institutions to trade when smaller
customers can't? "That's clearly the real concern," Mr.
Ketchum said. "The U.S. market is built on the principle that
a marketplace should be available to everyone."</p>
<p>-- Should pension funds, insurance companies, banks and
other institutional customers be barred from trading if they
determine they have adequate information?</p>
<p>-- In an era of global financial markets, does it make
sense to bar firms from making markets in the U.S. when
trading in U.S. listed stocks can continue in London? "There
was no rule impacting their ability to trade in London
without being able to report trades," Mr. Ketchum conceded.</p>
<p>-- Since third-market trading continues every day after
the exchanges close and SIAC shuts down, why bar such trading
when SIAC doesn't open in the first place?</p>
<p>Given these questions, "I think there will be debate on
whether or not that was an appropriate interpretation" by the
SEC, said John Wall, executive vice president of the National
Association of Securities Dealers. "It's a question that's
going to be discussed, and I think it's very right that it be
discussed."</p>
