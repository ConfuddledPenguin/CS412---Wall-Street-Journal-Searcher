	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- Still maneuvering over schedules rather than
substance, President Bush and top congressional leaders are
to meet again this morning to attempt to fashion a timetable
for the deficit-reduction talks, the White House said.
   As Republican budget negotiators left a meeting with Mr.
Bush yesterday, they complained that their Democratic
counterparts were dragging their feet. "We've walked the
extra mile on revenues," said Senate Republican Leader Robert
Dole of Kansas. "We've laid out a specific plan and we're
still waiting to hear from the Democrats."</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Rep. Bill Frenzel (R., Minn) said he and some other
Republican budget negotiators urged Mr. Bush to demand that
Congress delay the start of its scheduled recess. But other
GOP congressional leaders -- and some administration
officials, as well -- counseled a less confrontational
approach and are resigned to waiting until the fall to get
down to hard bargaining. White House Chief of Staff John
Sununu is already meeting with Republican strategists to
develop a consistent public explanation for the plodding
progress of the talks.</p>
<p>Democrats, though not refusing to put forward a plan,
continue to question the wisdom of doing so before Congress
begins its August recess. "It is not particularly useful to
have plans publicly aired, and then not the subject of
negotiations in an active, continuous basis for days or a
couple of weeks," Speaker Thomas Foley (D., Wash.) said.</p>
<p>Democrats are divided internally on both tactics and
substance, but privately say they are prepared to agree to
present a proposal on a specific date in late August or early
September. If Republicans threaten to delay the congressional
recess, then Democratic staff members expect Democratic
leaders to endorse a plan -- crafted largely as a political
statement of the party's priorities -- that relies on deep
cuts in defense and on tax increases aimed at the rich.</p>
<p>As previously reported, the draft Republican
deficit-reduction plan for fiscal 1991, which starts Oct. 1,
would raise taxes on beer, wine and liquor; cap the deduction
for state and local income taxes at $10,000; cut capital
gains tax rates; trim spending on defense by $7 billion and
trim spending on government benefit programs -- but not
Social Security -- by about $16 billion.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Sen. Daniel Moynihan is preparing to unveil a
revision of his proposal to reduce Social Security payroll
taxes. He wants to make it more attractive to his
deficit-fearing colleagues when he offers it as an amendment
to a must-pass bill to raise the federal debt ceiling this
week or next.</p>
<p>Instead of slashing the payroll tax over two years, aides
say the New York Democrat today will propose phasing in the
tax cut by dropping the Social Security tax by 0.2 percentage
point a year for five years beginning in fiscal 1991. Workers
currently pay 6.2% of their earnings under $51,300 for Social
Security; employers match that.</p>
<p>The new plan would cost the Treasury $6.6 billion in
fiscal 1991 and $147.6 billion over five years, Sen. Moynihan
figures. His original proposal to cut the tax rate to 6.06%
in the current year and 5.1% in 1991 would have cost the
Treasury $4.4 billion this fiscal year and $38 billion in
fiscal 1991. Sen. Moynihan wouldn't alter the additional
1.45% payroll tax that goes to finance Medicare.</p>
<p>The House is scheduled today to consider raising the debt
ceiling to $3.444 trillion from $3.122 trillion, sufficient
to allow government borrowing through September 1991. Mr.
Foley warned that the measure may fail the first time, but he
has said that the House won't begin its recess until it lifts
the debt ceiling.</p>
<p>The House Ways and Means Committee has approved an
alternative, which isn't slated for consideration today, that
would authorize the Treasury to keep borrowing only through
Oct. 15.</p>
<p>The Treasury says it will default unless Congress lifts
the debt ceiling by Aug. 15.</p>
<p>The congressional recess is scheduled to begin Friday,
although Senate leaders say they may delay their departure.
Mr. Bush is currently scheduled to begin a vacation in Maine
on Aug. 10.</p>
