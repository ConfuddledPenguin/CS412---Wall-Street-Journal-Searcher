	<p class="article-leader">LOS ANGELES -- Unocal Corp.'s second-quarter profit rose
38% to $165 million after a one-time net gain of $132
million, but operating earnings fell below most analysts'
expectations.
   Profit in the quarter amounted to 70 cents a share. But
excluding the gain from the sale of Unocal's Norwegian oil
and gas subsidiary and other extraordinary items, operating
earnings totaled just 15 cents a share -- five cents below
what many analysts had projected. By comparison, Unocal
earned about 38 cents a share from operations in the quarter
a year earlier, analysts said.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"The number is disappointing," said Frederick P. Leuffer
Jr. of C.J. Lawrence, Morgan Grenfell Inc. in New York, who
is cutting his full-year earnings estimate on Unocal to $1 a
share from $1.05. "Exploration expenses were higher than
anticipated, and they had some refinery turnarounds and
downtime from maintenance . . . {but} I think these are
one-time events that will be corrected."</p>
<p>In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday,
Unocal shares closed at $30.125 a share, off 25 cents.</p>
<p>Unocal said the drop in operating results reflected lower
domestic crude-oil production, higher domestic oil and gas
production expenses and lower earnings from chemical
operations. These were offset by the $132 million gain,
higher domestic natural-gas prices and production, and lower
deferred income taxes and net interest expense. Earnings for
the quarter included $12 million of deferred income-tax
benefits.</p>
<p>Second-quarter earnings the previous year were $120
million, or 51 cents a share, after $27 million in after-tax
gains from property sales and an $11 million gain from the
settlement of certain pension obligations.</p>
<p>Revenue for the second quarter fell 11% to $2.72 billion
from $3.07 billion. Unocal said the drop reflected the
absence of petroleum product sales attributable to its
Midwest Marketing Division, which is now part of UNO-VEN Co.,
a 50-50 joint venture that Unocal formed with Petroleos de
Venezuela S.A. last December.</p>
<p>Domestic crude-oil and condensate production fell in the
quarter to 132,200 barrels a day from 154,000 barrels a year
ago. Unocal blamed the drop on a temporary suspension of oil
production in the Cook Inlet area of Alaska because of
eruptions of Mount Redoubt, and on the company's sale of its
14% stake in a Long Beach, Calif., production joint venture.
Unocal's world-wide production in the quarter fell to 225,500
barrels a day from 242,400 barrels a day the previous year.
Natural-gas production rose to an average 1.33 billion cubic
feet a day from 1.27 billion cubic feet the previous year.</p>
<p>Second-quarter earnings from exploration and production
operations, including the $132 million gain, totaled $205
million, compared with $101 million a year ago. Earnings from
refining, marketing and transportation operations rose to $30
million in the quarter from $28 million a year ago. Earnings
from chemicals operations fell to $16 million from $21
million, and earnings from geothermal operations fell to $8
million from $11 million.</p>
<p>For the first six months, Unocal's earnings rose 17% to
$242 million, or $1.03 a share, from $207 million, or 88
cents a share, a year ago. Sales fell 6% to $5.36 billion
from $5.7 billion.</p>
