	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Robert K. Shaye wants the world to know there
is more to New Line Cinema Corp. than a menacing
Fedora-wearing murderer with razor-sharp nails and four
overgrown turtles who shout "Cowabunga]"
   Thanks to Freddy Kreuger, the wisecracking slasher of the
popular "Nightmare on Elm Street" series and "Teenage Mutant
Ninja Turtles," New Line Cinema is emerging as a feisty
survivor in the thinning ranks of independent movie
production and distribution companies. The landscape is
littered with the corpses of others who have tried and
failed, such as DeLaurentiis Entertainment Group Inc.,
Weintraub Entertainment Group Inc. and New World
Entertainment Ltd.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Yesterday, New Line reported that second-quarter earnings
leaped to $4.5 million, or 51 cents a share, from $143,000,
or two cents a share, in the year-earlier period. Per-share
net reflects a 25% stock dividend declared June 12. The 1990
per-share results reflect the sale of 600,000 shares to
Capital Guardian Trust Co., a Los Angeles money manager, on
May 29.</p>
<p>Total revenue more than tripled to $50.5 million from
$15.2 million, led by revenue from the films "House Party"
and "Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles." Revenue also was
buttressed by the videocassette and foreign-market releases
of "Heart Condition" and "Nightmare on Elm Street 5." New
Line distributed the "Ninja Turtles" film and produced and
distributed the other three films.</p>
<p>"Freddy put us on the map and the Turtles showed we are a
totally viable company," says 51-year-old Mr. Shaye, New
Line's president and chief executive officer. Some Wall
Street analysts agree.</p>
<p>"They've proved they're not a one product company," says
Alan Kassan, an analyst with Morgan Stanley & Co. "New Line
has been able to produce new product at the box office, long
after their original home runs and franchises have aged."</p>
<p>New Line has to come up with new product: its biggest
franchise, "Nightmare on Elm Street," appears to be losing
steam fast. Although the fourth installment took in nearly
$50 million at the box office in 1988, last year's fifth
installment, "The Dream Master," took in only about half
that.</p>
<p>New Line is hoping that it has a new franchise with plenty
of mileage in the "Turtles." This week, the company secured
the domestic and Canadian rights to the sequel of "Teenage
Mutant Ninja Turtles" from its producer, Golden Harvest
Films, a unit of Golden Communications Ltd. The movie is
expected to be released in March and will be budgeted at over
$20 million. That's considerably more than New Line's typical
movie, which has an average budget of $6 million, according
to Mr. Shaye. The original "Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles" was
an exception, costing about $12.5 million to make. But that
film has already grossed about $129 million, making the
higher cost of the sequel a worthy risk.</p>
<p>"New Line has the talent of having one hit pay for
everything else," says Dennis McAlpine, an analyst with
Oppenheimer & Co. "And they handle their own distribution.
Not many independents can say that."</p>
<p>Mr. Shaye hopes his ambitious expansion plans will quell
any remaining doubts about New Line's ability to make it
beyond its novelty movies. It recently entered into an
agreement with National Lampoon to develop, co-finance and
distribute a series of comedy films, with a promise from New
Line to finance upwards of $10 million a picture. New Line
also recently agreed to distribute seven films for Management
Company Entertainment Group Inc., which produced "Look Who's
Talking" for Sony Corp.'s Tri-Star Pictures unit. New Line is
also close to an agreement with Carolco Pictures Inc. for
domestic distribution rights for four of its films.</p>
<p>How successful these arrangements will be remains to be
seen; National Lampoon was just sold to Los Angeles-based J2
Communications, and in any event, the rights to its most
successful film series, National Lampoon's "Vacation," belong
to Time Warner Inc.'s Warner Bros unit. Mr. Shaye says there
are no projects yet from National Lampoon, and a spokesman
for New Line says the National Lampoon sale will not affect
the company's deal.</p>
<p>MCEG meanwhile, is in the process of a major restructuring
and has been unable to meet payments on its sizable debt.</p>
<p>To New Line's advantage, it is virtually debt-free, and
recently secured a three-year, $75 million credit line with,
among others, Chemical Bank. A New Line spokesman says the
credit line will be used for film production. Another company
official says another purpose is to help New Line get more
involved with foreign distribution.</p>
<p>Mr. Shaye, who sports flashy ties and shoulder-length salt
and pepper hair, graduated from Columbia University's Law
School, but immediately gravitated to the film industry. He
began distributing movies that were in the public domain,
such as the campy anti-marijuana "Refer Madness" and the
Rolling Stones concert movie "Sympathy for the Devil." He
launched New Line in 1967.</p>
<p>New Line also distinguishes itself by having its
headquarters in New York, not Hollywood, although 65 of the
company's 125 employees are West Coast-based. "It enhances
our thinking that the executives work and live in New York,"
Mr. Shaye says, "and don't think of themselves as part of the
Hollywood rat race."</p>
<p>Last week, New Line began running full-page advertisements
in trade publications, such as Variety, geared to getting
across the company's philosophy. The ad read in part, "We
green light faster than any other film company we know, major
or independent. . . . We believe other aspects of our
operation are just as important. We intend to tell you a
little about them, occasionally, in messages like this." The
ad is signed, "New Line Cinema. Solidly Independent."</p>
<p>And, Mr. Shaye says, New Line plans to stay that way.
"We're not talking about a merger or acquisition with
anyone," he says, carefully selecting his words. "We have had
discussions, very selective discussions, about strategy
alliances." He declined to elaborate.</p>
