	<p class="article-leader">The chairman of Fujitsu Ltd., fresh from a #742.8 million
($1.37 billion) agreement to buy control of Britain's
International Computers Ltd., said he wants to increase the
company's ties with Siemens AG of West Germany.
   Takuma Yamamoto's comments, apparently intended as a trial
balloon, underscore how eagerly Fujitsu and its Japanese
rivals are now pursuing the European market.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The chief of Japan's largest computer maker said that as
part of the company's drive to expand in Europe he hopes
eventually to invest in the West German electronics giant, or
to form a joint venture with it. In a brief interview
following a news conference in London, he said: "Sometime in
the future, if there is the possibility to invest in Siemens,
I hope to do that."</p>
<p>Mr. Yamamoto said he hasn't any "definite plans" -- and a
Siemens spokesman in Munich said he doesn't see a need for
expanded cooperation "at the moment." The two companies
already cooperate in mainframe computers, with Fujitsu acting
as supplier for Siemens's top-of-the-line mainframe models,
sold primarily in West Germany. Siemens is the second-largest
computer vendor in Europe, after International Business
Machines Corp. Even a friendly Japanese investment in a
pillar of European technology like Siemens would stir immense
political controversy in Europe.</p>
<p>Mr. Yamamoto said Fujitsu's computer sales in Europe
currently total about 100 billion yen ($671 million) a year,
obtained mostly by marketing its products through Siemens,
International Computers in Britain, and a venture with
Spain's Cia. Telefonica Nacional de Espana. He added that
while he hasn't any specific plans yet, he is also interested
in forming joint ventures in Eastern Europe.</p>
<p>Yesterday's long-expected agreement with International
Computers, or ICL, a unit of Britain's STC PLC, widens
Fujitsu's lead over its Japanese rivals and makes it a
tougher competitor against IBM. The planned purchase of an
80% stake in ICL pushes Fujitsu just past Digital Equipment
Corp. as the world's second-biggest computer maker after IBM.
The purchase would still leave Fujitsu, with computer-related
sales in the year ended March 31 of 1.69 trillion yen, about
a fourth of IBM's size; ICL's sales, in the half-year ended
June 30, totaled #765 million.</p>
<p>But the British investment is a milestone in Japan's
three-decade quest, often backed by government policies, to
catch up with world-leading IBM. In the British market, ICL
is IBM's closest competitor, and Fujitsu's control of it will
doubtless make life more difficult for IBM in Britain, the
fifth-largest national market for IBM. More important, the
Fujitsu investment may hurt IBM on the European continent by
helping ICL achieve its goal of expanding significantly
beyond Britain.</p>
<p>"We strongly hope to increase ICL's business in the U.K.
-- and Europe, too," Mr. Yamamoto said at the news
conference. He declined to elaborate, beyond saying that he
doesn't plan any changes in ICL's management or strategies.
Last year, ICL controlled 16% of the British computer
hardware, software and services market, excluding personal
computers, according to market researchers Dataquest Inc. In
contrast, ICL's share of the total West European market was a
feeble 3%.</p>
<p>The biggest obstacle to Fujitsu's growth in Europe --
whether with ICL or Siemens -- will be politics. As in the
U.S., European politicians are increasingly leery of growing
Japanese investments; and few areas are more politically
sensitive than a high-tech sector like computers. Among the
risks in the ICL investment, for instance, is that ICL under
Japanese ownership could lose its grip on British government
computer contracts. And in the days since Fujitsu first
announced talks with ICL, some European competitors have
questioned ICL's continued rights to participate in European
Community high-tech research projects.</p>
<p>In a telephone interview yesterday, Francis Lorentz,
chairman and chief executive of French computer-maker Groupe
Bull, argued that ICL shouldn't be allowed to join any new EC
research projects unless the Japanese open their government
programs to European companies. As the largest British-owned
computer company, ICL gets several million dollars a year in
EC research subsidies; denying ICL access to the technology
generated in these projects would hurt ICL and its new owner.</p>
<p>"If we want to open our markets," Mr. Lorentz said, "ask
them {the Japanese} to open their markets." He added that he
will discuss with Siemens whether or not to disband a
three-way, ICL-Siemens-Bull research center in computer
software. At yesterday's London news conference, however, ICL
Chief Executive Peter Bonfield said he doubts his company
will be excluded from any collaborative projects, as it
remains a European-based and -managed company despite its
Fujitsu ties.</p>
<p>If Fujitsu's skillful handling of ICL is any guide, the
Japanese company may sidestep many political hurdles to its
European growth. Fujitsu defused a potential furor over its
ICL purchase by spending months in slow, cautious talks with
STC, and paying numerous "courtesy calls" on British and EC
politicians. Also helping the company was its status as a
familiar face in Britain; since 1981, Fujitsu has supplied
ICL with the core technology of the British company's
mainframe computers, the logic chips to ICL's Series 39
models.</p>
<p>As a result, many British politicians have welcomed -- or
at least refrained from opposing -- the Fujitsu purchase as
the only way to maintain a native British mainframe-computer
industry. ICL was formed in 1968 by the merger of two local
computer firms, and is regarded by politicians as the
flagship of British computing.</p>
<p>STC, a large telecommunications-equipment maker, bought
ICL in 1984 in an illstarred effort to become a global
"information technology" giant. For the past 18 months, new
STC management has been hankering to dump ICL as incompatible
with plans to expand their strong phone cable and
transmission-gear business.</p>
<p>Yesterday, STC announced that "we are undertaking a wide
ranging review of our business and its structure." Arthur
Walsh, chairman and chief executive, said STC will use the
proceeds of the ICL sale to expand the communications
business, and to develop alliances with other companies.</p>
<p>Also yesterday, STC reported disappointing financial
results for the half-year ended July 1. Pretax profit tumbled
32% to #77.7 million from #114.6 million a year earlier. Net
income fell 30% to #50.1 million, or nine pence a share, from
#72 million, or 13 pence a share. Revenue fell 6.7% to #1.19
billion from #1.28 billion.</p>
<p>ICL, which provides 64% of STC's revenue and 68% of
operating profit, also put in a weak performance in the
half-year. Operating profit slipped to #58.4 million from
#63.1 million a year earlier, because of a slowing in the
U.K. computer market. Nevertheless, of all the European
computer companies Fujitsu could have bought, ICL is regarded
by industry analysts as one of the best. After a painful
reorganization in the early 1980s, ICL has been posting
respectable profits.</p>
