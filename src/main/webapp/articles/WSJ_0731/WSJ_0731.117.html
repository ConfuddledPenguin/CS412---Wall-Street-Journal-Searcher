	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Consumer confidence held fairly steady in July
after a significant loss in June, the Conference Board said.
   The board's index, which measures consumer attitudes about
the economy, based on a survey of 5,000 households, was down
about half a point in July to 101.8, from a revised 102.4 in
June. The index was 120.4 a year ago. The survey uses 1985 as
a base of 100.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The monthly survey, conducted for the Conference Board by
National Family Opinion Inc. of Toledo, Ohio, found consumers
a bit more positive about current conditions but less
positive in their expectations. Slightly more respondents
than last month say jobs are "plentiful," 25.6%, up from
23.4%. But more people expect "fewer" jobs will be available
in the next six months, nearly 18%, up from 16.5%.</p>
<p>Fabian Linden, executive director of the Conference
Board's Consumer Research Center, said consumer confidence
declines since the beginning of the year are "markedly
different in various regions of the country." In the past
three months, compared with a year earlier, New England's
index is lowest, followed by the Middle Atlantic states. The
Pacific states, while falling below the year-ago index,
remain at a level above the rest of the nation.</p>
<p>Car buying plans in July, slightly below June's, are
stronger than last year by one percentage point. Home buying
plans perked up compared with June and with a year ago. Major
appliance buying plans softened moderately.</p>
<p>The Conference Board is a nonprofit, business-research
organization.</p>
