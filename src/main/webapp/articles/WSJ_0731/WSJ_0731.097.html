	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Standard & Poor's Corp. kept Massachusetts'
triple-B rated general obligation bonds on its CreditWatch
list with negative implications.
   The ratings agency said the watch reflects the state's
continued failure to pass a new budget and the continuing
uncertainty over whether a sales tax on services that was
passed will be reconsidered by the legislature.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>It also said there are concerns about a tax-cutting
initiative that voters will consider in November.</p>
<p>Standard & Poor's said that "legislative inaction over the
last two years" has left $1.8 billion in operating deficits
over the last two years and promise "a legacy of debt for
perhaps the next two administrations." It said "while the
economy is in a recession, long-term prospects remain
positive."</p>
