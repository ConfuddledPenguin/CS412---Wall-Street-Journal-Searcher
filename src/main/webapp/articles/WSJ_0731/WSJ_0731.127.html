granted by Consumers Packaging Inc. to acquire an additional
4,529,781 common shares of the Toronto-based packaging
concern.
   The 39.6-million Canadian-dollar (US$34.2 million)
purchase brings Enfield's stake in Consumers Packaging to
57.6% from about 50%.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Consumers Packaging said it intends to use the C$45.4
million proceeds of the rights issue to reduce corporate
debt.</p>
