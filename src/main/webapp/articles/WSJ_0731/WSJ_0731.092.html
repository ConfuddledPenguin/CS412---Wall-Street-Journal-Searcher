	<p class="article-leader">Over-the-counter stocks continued their slide as
profit-taking in blue chip and technology issues joined
forces with ennui to push the OTC market to its lowest level
in three months.
   The Nasdaq Composite Index fell 3.21 to 439.38, or 0.7%,
after trading as low as 473.05 before it began to recover as
exchange-listed shares rose. Declining stocks swamped
advancers, 1,216 to 732, and volume eased to 120.4 million
shares from 121.8 million Friday.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"There's a total lackadaisical attitude toward the
secondary stocks," said William Sulya, director of OTC
trading at A.G. Edwards & Sons, St. Louis. "There just isn't
any support for them at this point."</p>
<p>Mr. Sulya was among those who attributed sharp losses in
several Nasdaq indexes earlier in the day to continued
profittaking among institutions, unwillingness among dealers
to commit capital to smaller stocks and aggressive selling by
some so-called "hedge funds" and other short-term investors.</p>
<p>Selling continued to hammer the market's larger issues and
some of this year's best performers. Amgen, a biotechnology
concern which opened the year at 49 and rose to an all-time
high last week of 92, fell 1/2 to 87 5/8. The stock traded as
low as 84 1/2 earlier in the day. Among other OTC market
leaders, Intel eased 1/8 to 43 3/8, Liz Claiborne sagged 1
1/8 to 28 7/8; Microsoft fell 1 to 68; Sun Microsystems
dropped 5/8 to 32 1/8; Conner Peripherals declined 1 to 26
1/2, and Nordstrom fell 5/8 to 29 3/8.</p>
<p>Analysts said profit-taking in those larger stocks
continues to pull down the broader market. The market value
of the Nasdaq 100 Index, which tracks the performance of the
100 largest OTC stocks, comprises 42% of the total market
value of the Nasdaq Composite Index, which consists of 4,056
stocks. The Nasdaq 100 fell 3.43 to 447.84 and has lost 3.55%
this month.</p>
<p>Morgan Stanley analyst L. Keith Mullins said he finds the
sell-off in the market's technology and larger issues a
"healthy correction" as portfolio managers continue to take
their gains from the first half of the year. "It's natural,"
he said in an interview. "I'm glad to see it shake out some
of the speculators."</p>
<p>Among other large issues, MCI Communications closed
unchanged at 37 5/8 on 1.8 million shares. The Washington,
D.C., long-distance carrier said it signed contracts with the
American Hospital Association and Continental Corp.</p>
<p>Traders and analysts said they don't expect smooth sailing
soon among over-the-counter stocks, particularly with
investors wary of earnings disappointments. Mr. Mullins said
he expects to see more selling, particularly of technology
shares that have performed well.</p>
<p>"Volatility now is higher than normal," said Dick Holden,
senior OTC trader at Alex. Brown & Sons, Baltimore. Mr.
Holden explained that dealers are hesitant to put up capital
for stocks during periods with earnings surprises. "They
don't want to have any commitment one way or the other," he
said.</p>
<p>The thin trading in smaller stocks adds to their
volatility, explained Stephen Lieber, manager of the
Evergreen Fund of Purchase, N.Y. For example, he pointed to
New England Critical Care, which fell 2 1/4 to 28 1/4 after
the Marlborough, Mass., provider of home-infusion therapy
reported net income for the second quarter ended June 30 rose
to 21 cents a share from 15 cents a year earlier.</p>
<p>Despite that profit increase, the earnings were a couple
of cents shy of analysts' estimates, Mr. Lieber said. "It's
been promptly destroyed," he added, suggesting that investors
who were concerned they couldn't easily sell the stock, which
has 12.2 million shares outstanding, quickly took their
profits.</p>
<p>"A substantial number of holders are not investors," Mr.
Lieber said, attributing some of the volatility in smaller
stocks to institutions, traders and so-called hedge funds,
which invest for short-term profits.</p>
<p>Cetus, the day's most-active stock, traded in a wide range
from 17 1/4 to 13 7/8 amid speculation about whether a Food
and Drug Administration advisory panel will recommend
approval of use of the Emeryville, Calif., biotechnology
company's drug, Interleukin-2, for use in the treatment of
kidney cancer.</p>
<p>Dow Jones Professional Investor Report said after the
market closed that the panel delayed recommending approval of
the drug until it reviews further details of recently
available data about the drug. Cetus fell 1 3/4 to 14 1/8 on
more than three million shares.</p>
<p>Among other biotechnology shares, Immunex fell 2 1/4 to
31. DJPIR said analysts were concerned that an FDA advisory
panel, scheduled to meet today, might not recommend that the
Seattle biotechnology concern receive full approval to market
a white blood cell stimulant known as GMCSF, to treat graft
failure in bone marrow transplants.</p>
<p>A question given the panel raised the possibility Immunex
may be given approval pending ongoing testing of the drug,
which would mean the company couldn't immediately earn a
profit from the sale of the drug, analysts told DJPIR.
However, analysts disagreed on whether the panel's concerns
are negative or neutral for the company.</p>
<p>Shorewood Packaging skidded 1 1/4 to 21 1/4 after Shearson
Lehman Hutton analyst Susan Hirsch lowered her near-term
rating on the Farmingdale, N.Y., maker of paperboard packing
to "neutral" from "attractive" and reduced her earnings
estimate for the company's first quarter ending July 31 to 23
cents a share from 21 cents, DJPIR reported.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>NEW RULE ADOPTED: The Securities and Exchange Commission
gave the National Association of Securities Dealers the
go-ahead to adopt a "one-share, one-vote" rule for 90 days
while the regulators review it. NASD rushed to adopt the
provision after a federal appeals court ruled last month that
the SEC overstepped its authority in adopting a similar
measure. The rule prohibits any company listed on Nasdaq from
issuing stock that "nullifies, restricts or disparately
reduces" the voting rights of stockholders. The New York
Stock Exchange has a similar rule, but the American Stock
Exchange doesn't.</p>
