	<p class="article-leader">BURBANK, Calif. -- A so-called white squire fund
controlled by Roy E. Disney has launched its first public
investment, agreeing in principle with a debt-laden holding
company to acquire an 82% stake in Child World Inc., the
nation's second-largest toy retailer.
   The proposed purchase by Trefoil Capital Investors Limited
Partnership will include a subsequent $14-a-share, or $28
million, cash offer for the 18% of Child World now in public
hands. But details of the private part of the deal remain
clouded and the value of the entire transaction is uncertain.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The proposed sale appears amid growing interest in
resuscitating leveraged buyouts flattened by heavy debt.
Trefoil, formed by the executives of Shamrock Holdings Inc.,
a holding company controlled by Mr. Disney, a California
investor and nephew of the late Walt Disney, is a $450
million investment fund designed to take advantage of just
such situations. The term white squire has been used to
define a friendly entity that aids another company without
taking it over.</p>
<p>The partnership said it preliminarily agreed with
Cleveland-based CNC Holding Corp. to buy CNC's stake in Child
World through what the two companies described as a "non-cash
transaction." A person familiar with details of the proposal
said it is intended for Trefoil to issue CNC new securities,
which CNC in turn would offer to holders of its debt and
preferred stock. But such securities would apparently cover
only part of CNC's debt.</p>
<p>If successful, the transaction may make available to
cash-tight Child World the funds to build up its depleted
store inventories. For CNC, the sale is a chance to move
substantial debt off the holding company's balance sheet.</p>
<p>Trefoil said the transaction is subject to completion of a
definitive agreement and receipt of fairness opinions from
investment bankers. It said it expects to finish the
documentation by next Sunday and to complete the acquisition
of CNC's stake within 60 days thereafter.</p>
<p>In national over-the-counter trading yesterday, Child
World shares closed at $13.75, down 25 cents.</p>
<p>Child World, a distant second to Toys `R' Us Inc., the
dominant giant of the business, had net income in its latest
fiscal year ended Feb. 3 of $5.8 million, or $2 a share, on
revenue of $830.3 million. For the usually-slow first quarter
ended May 5, Child World had a loss of $7.4 million, or 65
cents a share, on revenue of $130.1 million-off slightly from
a year earlier. The company, based in Avon, Mass., operates
174 stores in 31 states east of the Rocky Mountains.</p>
<p>It appears that the retailer, which last year slashed
overall inventories by 8.1%, or by 14% on a per-store basis,
to save cash, may have cut too close to the bone. Child
World, based in Avon, Mass., said the latest quarter results
reflected a shortage of many sales items after the Christmas
season, although it said inventories were refreshed in April.</p>
<p>Child World's parent, CNC Holding, the product of a 1984
leveraged buy-out, has been under increasing pressure to meet
financial obligations. At Feb. 3, the company had a negative
net worth -- assets minus liabilities -- of $207.3 million.
Starting in September, CNC's more than $170 million of senior
subordinated notes, which have been accumulating interest and
principle, will require cash interest payments. Other parts
of the company's approximately $500 million in long-term debt
and preferred stock also begin in future years to require
cash payments.</p>
<p>CNC said this past March that it was exploring
alternatives, including the possible sale or refinancing of
its stake in Child World. CNC also operates chains of optical
departments and stores, specialty shops, and key-making
installations.</p>
<p>Stanley P. Gold, president of Trefoil and president and
chief executive officer of its general partner, Shamrock said
in an interview that Trefoil's capital will greatly help
Child World. "This company has struggled in the last few
years because it has been capital-starved," Mr. Gold said. He
said Shamrock's experience with its 71-store Music Plus and
140-store Sound Warehouse music and video outlets gives
Trefoil's partners considerable retail expertise.</p>
<p>Trefoil plans to retain Child World's current management,
Mr. Gold said. However, as with past practice at Shamrock,
Trefoil is likely to monitor developments at Child World
closely.</p>
<p>If the transaction proceeds, it appears that Trefoil will
acquire Child World for only $28 million in immediate cash
payments -- the amount needed to buy the 18% of the stock in
public hands. Thereafter, the profitability of the purchase
will depend on the terms Trefoil and CNC have set for the
securities Trefoil will exchange with CNC for the Child World
stock.</p>
<p>If the terms of these securities are too rich, it will cut
into Trefoil's returns. If they are too lean, observers said,
then persuading holders of CNC's current high-yield "junk"
financing to make an exchange may be difficult.</p>
