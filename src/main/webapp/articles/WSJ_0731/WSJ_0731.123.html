	<p class="article-leader">Alpine Group Inc. said it reached a definitive agreement
to sell its General Plasma Inc. unit for $19 million to
Ontario Corp., Muncie, Ind. General Plasma operates thermal
spray coating systems.
   Alpine, based in Hackensack, N.J., said it expects to
complete the transaction by Aug. 31, subject to completion of
financing by Ontario. It said it would continue its
operations in the electronic information display business.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Separately, Alpine reported earnings of $3.8 million, or
74 cents a share, for the fiscal year ended April 30,
compared with a loss of $11.7 million a year earlier. The
profit was attributable to a $20 million extraordinary gain
from "extinguishment of debt," the company said. The company
posted losses of $4.3 million on continuing operations and
$11.8 million on discontinued operations. In fiscal 1989,
those losses were $5.4 million and $6.3 million respectively.
Sales from continuing operations were $7.9 million, compared
with $6.3 million the previous year.</p>
