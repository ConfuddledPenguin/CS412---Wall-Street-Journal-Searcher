	<p class="article-leader">I have a possible solution to the S&L mess (page one, July
3).
   Have two types of deposits: uninsured and insured. The
uninsured deposits will pay market interest rates to the
depositor, the insured ones two points below. The two points
will go to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., to cover the
insurance. Thus, the cost to the financial institution will
be the same. The depositor will watch the performance of his
bank and decide how safe its operation is. We eliminate giant
federal supervision. The financial institution should publish
figures monthly so everybody can figure out the depositors'
confidence in the financial institution and its performance.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Some private evaluators will appear to advise depositors,
the funds generally will stay close to home, the amount of
large, brokered deposits will decrease, and the two points
going to the FDIC may be used to pay for the current bailout.</p>
