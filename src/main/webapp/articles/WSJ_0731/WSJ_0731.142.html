	<p class="article-leader">LIBERIAN TROOPS MASSACRED hundreds of civilian refugees,
witnesses said.
   Survivors of the morning attack on St. Peter's Lutheran
Church said at least 600 people were killed when soldiers
loyal to President Doe fired machine guns at refugees who had
taken shelter in the church since rebels reached Monrovia
three weeks ago. State Department officials in Washington
said their information indicated a total of 200 deaths.
According to witnesses, most victims were children and women
from the Gio and Mano tribes, who support the insurgents in
their attempt to oust Doe. A spokesman for the president
denied the allegations and said rebels wearing government
uniforms were responsible for the killings.</p>

of terror" but said it hadn't any plans to send troops into
the West African nation.</p>

<p>A BOMB KILLED a British lawmaker who had condemned
terrorist acts.</p>
<p>Ian Gow, a Conservative Party politician, died in a bomb
attack that Scotland Yard said appeared to be the work of the
Irish Republican Army. No one immediately claimed
responsibility. Gow, 53, had been a close associate of Prime
Minister Thatcher and was the chairman of a House of Commons
Conservative Committee on Northern Ireland. Yesterday's
attack would be the 12th the IRA has carried out in mainland
Britain this year, police said. Formerly Thatcher's
parliamentary private secretary, Gow was outspoken in
deploring the use of violence in pursuit of political goals.</p>
<p>Thatcher said Gow's death was a "grievous loss" for
Britain, and she vowed that the government wouldn't yield to
any terrorist pressure.</p>

<p>George Steinbrenner was ordered to give up day-to-day
control of the New York Yankees by Aug. 20 and asked to
reduce his majority holding in the team, which he has run
since 1973, to a minority interest. Baseball Commissioner
Vincent's action followed a four-month probe into the Yankees
owner's involvement with gambler Howard Spira.</p>

<p>An agreement was reached to end a fourday hostage siege in
Trinidad, according to Prime Minister Robinson and a
negotiator for Moslem rebels. Robinson is one of 41 hostages
reportedly held by the insurgents. The accord was said to
call for Robinson's resignation, a vote within 90 days and
amnesty for those who attempted the coup.</p>

<p>A House panel is expected to propose rules today aimed at
delaying production of some weapons, including the next
generation of Air Force fighters and Army helicopters, which
have a combined price of nearly $85 billion. The House Armed
Services Committee's proposals depart from traditional
arms-buying plans.</p>
<p>The House approved an $8.3 billion military-construction
bill that would slash the Pentagon's budget for overseas
facilities by more than 60% and bar any expenditures for a
new NATO air base in southern Italy in fiscal 1991. Total
U.S. contributions for NATO's infrastructure would be cut by
41% from current levels.</p>

<p>The House approved a food-labeling measure that regulates
the use of health claims and requires the food industry to
put a uniform nutrition label on almost all packaged foods.
The bill was adopted after food-processor groups agreed to a
compromise on the issue of federal pre-emption of state
labeling rules.</p>

<p>The Soviet Union and Albania agreed to restore diplomatic
ties severed in 1961 over Moscow's ideological quarrel with
China. Albania stepped up efforts to end its postwar
isolation after this month's refugee crisis, when thousands
of asylum-seekers stormed foreign embassies in Tirana until
they were allowed to emigrate.</p>

<p>The Coast Guard upgraded its assessment of a weekend oil
spill in Galveston Bay in Texas to major. Authorities said
that 500,000 gallons of oil leaked from two barges after they
collided Saturday, 10 times the original estimate. An oil
patch was seen heading from the bay into the Gulf of Mexico,
threatening to make cleanup more difficult.</p>

<p>The Lebanese government clamped an economic and diplomatic
blockade on rebel Gen. Aoun in a bid to oust him from the
Christian enclave north of Beirut. Syria expressed support
for the move. Aoun, who controls about 20% of the enclave,
contends that a military cabinet he has headed since 1988 is
Lebanon's legitimate government.</p>

<p>The Ukraine demanded that Moscow send home all Ukrainian
soldiers stationed in other Soviet republics by Dec. 1, and
asked that soldiers serving in Kirghizia, Azerbaijan and
Armenia be returned two months earlier. The Parliament's
resolution would be difficult to enforce and is regarded as a
largely symbolic act of defiance.</p>

<p>The European Community proposed a 30% cut in farm
subsidies over a 10-year period to try to end a dispute that
threatens global trade talks. The EC's agricultural
commissioner submitted the surprise proposal at the start of
a two-day meeting in Ireland with his counterparts from the
U.S., Japan, Canada and Australia.</p>

<p>East Germany's premier proposed calling a meeting to
decide how much in reparations his nation should pay Israel
for Nazi crimes, according to a letter released by the World
Jewish Congress. De Maiziere's letter signals a reversal for
the East Germans, who earlier agreed to pay reparations to
Jewish groups but not to Israel.</p>

<p>A federal jury in Los Angeles found a second man, Juan
Jose Bernabe Ramirez, guilty of kidnapping and racketeering
in the 1985 murder of U.S. drug agent Enrique Camarena. The
jury acquitted Bernabe of murder. Jurors resumed
deliberations on charges against two others.</p>

<p>Bush met in Washington with Latvia's Prime Minister
Godmanis and his foreign minister, who said they received
encouragement in their nation's transition toward
independence from Moscow. A White House spokesman said that
he wasn't aware of any commitments made by the president.</p>
