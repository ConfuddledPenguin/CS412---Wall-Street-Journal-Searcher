	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- The House approved a measure that would
tighten the requirements under which the government grants
seven-year monopolies for drugs used to treat rare diseases.
   The bill, passed by voice vote, was considerably less
severe than what was proposed last spring by Rep. Henry
Waxman. The California Democrat was an author of the 1983
"orphan drug" law that gave the Food and Drug Administration
authority to grant seven-year exclusivity for otherwise
unprofitable drugs. But after receiving complaints that some
firms were earning unexpectedly high profits, Rep. Waxman
sought to prevent unexpected windfalls.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The bill originally would have allowed competition for
certain unexpectedly profitable orphan drugs already on the
market. Among these were Genentech Inc.'s Human Growth
Hormone, used to treat dwarfism, and Amgen Inc.'s EPO, used
to treat anemia in kidney dialysis patients. But after
intense lobbying, existing orphan drugs were exempted from
the bill.</p>
<p>The measure passed yesterday would withdraw orphan-drug
status for drugs whose patient population grows beyond
200,000. The bill also would allow more than one company to
market different versions of a drug granted orphan status in
instances where the companies developed the drug
simultaneously.</p>
<p>A similar proposal has been introduced in the Senate.</p>
