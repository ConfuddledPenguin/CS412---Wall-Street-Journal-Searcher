	<p class="article-leader">Troubled Circle K Corp., the nation's second-largest
convenience store chain, which is operating under Chapter 11
bankruptcy-law protection, reported a net loss of $747.4
million, or $17.19 a share, for the fiscal fourth quarter
ended April 30.
   The loss included a reorganization and restructuring
charge of $639.3 million, the Phoenix, Ariz.-based company
said. In the year-ago fourth quarter, Circle K had a net loss
of $23.1 million, or 57 cents a share. Revenue declined 2.6%
to $907.9 million from $932.1 million.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>For the year, Circle K reported a net loss of $772.9
million, or $17.91 a share, compared with earnings of $15.4
million, or 21 cents a share, for the preceding fiscal year.
Revenue rose 6.9% to $3.74 billion from $3.49 billion.</p>
<p>Circle K took the fourth-quarter reorganization and
restructuring charge as a result of its financial condition,
reorganization efforts and Chapter 11 filing, the company
said. Stockholders equity as of April 30 was a negative
$451.6 million.</p>
<p>In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday,
Circle K shares closed unchanged at $1.125.</p>
<p>Circle K got into its present situation by expanding too
fast -- from 1,300 stores in 1983 to about 4,650 at the end
of last year -- and taking on $1.1 billion in
below-investment grade junk debt to buy and open new stores.
The company's new acquisitions weren't producing nearly
enough operating profit to offset the debt burden they
imposed. During this expansion and acquisition phase, Circle
K also drove customers away by raising prices above the
competition and replacing standard inventory with high-profit
margin products customers didn't want.</p>
<p>The company also found itself unable to compete with
companies such as Los Angeles-based Atlantic Richfield Co.,
which could market its gasoline less expensively than Circle
K, thus attracting customers to its AM-PM minimarkets. Nor
could it expand to beyond its traditional customer base of
blue-collar men between the ages of 18 to 35 years old to
include more white-collar workers and women.</p>
<p>Circle K filed for reorganization May 15 under Chapter 11
of the federal Bankruptcy Code after failing in a last ditch
effort to win lender approval for a plan to reschedule debt
and reorganize the company. The filing followed the May
resignation of Circle K's widely criticized chairman, Karl
Eller, who oversaw the rapid expansion.</p>
<p>Circle K and its affiliated subsidiaries in the
bankruptcy-law proceedings plan to file a list of all
liabilities and assets on or about Aug. 28, and the company
said it expects to file a reorganization plan "as soon as
practicable."</p>
<p>As of April 30, Circle K operated 4,631 convenience stores
in 32 states and had about 1,298 stores under license or
joint venture agreements in 14 foreign countries.</p>
