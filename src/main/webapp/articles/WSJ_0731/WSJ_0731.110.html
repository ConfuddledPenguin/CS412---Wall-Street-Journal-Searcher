	<p class="article-leader">CHICAGO -- Santa Fe Pacific Corp. announced plans to
refinance its $780 million of high-yielding senior
subordinated debentures through a debt-for-equity swap and
redemptions.
   The 16% pay-in-kind debentures, due in 2003, were issued
as part of a 1988 restructuring undertaken in the face of an
unsuccessful acquisition overture. The railroad, real estate
and natural-resources concern has said that refinancing the
so-called PIK debentures, which became callable in March, was
a prerequisite to its plans to spin off its real estate and
energy operations.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Under the plan announced yesterday, debenture holders will
be offered a chance to swap $1,000 face value of the
debentures for Santa Fe Pacific common stock valued at
$1,060. The exchange offer is limited to $200 million face
value of the debentures.</p>
<p>If the offer is oversubscribed, the company said, the
offer will be on a pro-rated basis. The value of the Santa Fe
common to be exchanged will be based on the average of the
stock's closing price on the 10 trading days prior to the
Aug. 27 closing of the offer.</p>
<p>In addition, the company said, a subsidiary has filed a
registration statement covering the planned offering of $210
million of variable rate exchange debentures due 2010. Under
"certain circumstances," the company said, those debentures
would be exchangeable for common units outstanding of Santa
Fe Pacific Pipeline Partners, a limited partnership in which
Santa Fe Pacific Corp. holds a 44% interest. Santa Fe said it
intends to use the net proceeds from the offering of the
variable-rate debentures to pay down an additional portion of
the PIK issue.</p>
<p>The remaining about $400 million in outstanding PIK
debentures will be redeemed at $1,030 in cash for each $1,000
face value, on Oct. 31. The company will issue long-term debt
to finance the redemption, adding that it expects the
interest rate on the long-term obligations to be
"significantly below" the rate it is paying on the PIK issue.</p>
