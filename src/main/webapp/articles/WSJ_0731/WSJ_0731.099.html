	<p class="article-leader">Asahi Breweries Ltd. of Japan reported that its first-half
unconsolidated pretax earnings rose 3.2% to 11.76 billion yen
($78.9 million) from 11.39 billion yen a year earlier.
   Net income climbed 14% to 3.74 billion yen from 3.29
billion yen. Per-share net fell to 9.35 yen from 10.66 yen,
because of an increase in shares outstanding.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Sales increased 13% to 324.32 billion yen from 287.11
billion yen, because of the popularity in the domestic market
of Asahi's dry beer, a sharp-tasting beer with a slightly
higher alcohol content than standard beers have. Asahi has
about an 86% share of the domestic market for dry beer.</p>
