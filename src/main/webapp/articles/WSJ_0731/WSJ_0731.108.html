	<p class="article-leader">Futures prices of crude oil for delivery in the fourth
quarter have made strong gains in recent days, an indication
that traders think the oil producers' cartel might abide by
its new production accord.
   Yesterday, crude for September delivery rose a modest 17
cents a barrel to $20.21 in light volume as market
participants tried to assess the near-term impact of last
week's meeting of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries. Traders are concerned that huge global inventories
will cut down buying interest until winter demand starts to
pick up during the fourth quarter.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Even reports that the Houston Ship Channel will be closed
for several days as a result of an oil spill failed to
produce any reaction in a market saturated with oil. The
channel is a major U.S. route for moving crude and refined
oil products to and from refineries.</p>
<p>However, crude for December delivery has made sharp gains
during the past 10 days. While the price for September crude
has gone up only from $20.06 a barrel to yesterday's $20.21,
the December contract has jumped to $21.84 from $20.72.
"That's an indication that traders anticipate the surplus to
be soaked up later this year," said Andrew Lebow, analyst for
E.D.& F. Man International Futures Inc.</p>
<p>OPEC oil ministers have said that excess world inventories
will be whittled down if all producers abide by the new
accord, which limits OPEC's production to 22.5 million
barrels a day. And more than at any other time in recent
years, market participants seem to believe that OPEC will
honor the agreement this time.</p>
<p>Iraq, which has become known in trading circles as "the
enforcer," is expected to keep Kuwait's and the United Arab
Emirates' production in line. Both have been chronic
violators of their OPEC quotas in the past, but Iraq's threat
of military force has thus far caused them to acquiesce.</p>
<p>In other commodity markets yesterday:
</p>
<p>COPPER: Futures prices declined. The September contract,
after four consecutive days of gains resulting in a
cumulative advance of 6.80 cents by Friday, fell 2.35 cents a
pound to $1.2355. One analyst said the market was overbought
and had undergone a correction. One factor that apparently
contributed to the sell-off, he said, was a prediction of a
further increase of about 7,000 tons in the London Metal
Exchange warehouse stocks of copper, which will be announced
today. Prices firmed in London -- where most trading is done
before the New York market opens -- because of aggressive
Japanese buying of copper. But the strength didn't carry over
into New York even though a higher New York opening was
expected. Except for a slight advance after the beginning of
trading, the market was on the defensive throughout the day,
the analyst said. Richard Hirsch, a metals trader at Sharps
Pixley Inc., a New York metals trading company, commented
that "the market was a technician's delight and a
fundamentalist's nightmare." Most of the recent gains have
come as a result of buying by technically oriented traders,
Mr. Hirsch said. "People such as dealers and copper users,
who are concerned about the economy, can't understand how
prices could have advanced so much when slower economic
conditions are working against industrial copper use, which,
at best, is flat," he said.</p>
<p>GRAINS AND SOYBEANS: Prices of soybean and soybean oil
futures contracts rose on strong demand for vegetable oil
products -- especially from fast-food restaurants switching
from fat-based frying oils to please health-conscious
customers. Analysts said lack of rain in southern growing
regions, such as Arkansas and Tennessee, also contributed to
the increase in futures prices, as some traders speculated
that dry conditions would damage the developing soybean crop
in those areas. But longrange weather forecasts called for
more moisture and generally more favorable growing
conditions. That could exert downward pressure on soybean
futures prices in trading today, analysts said. Wheat futures
prices declined on rumors that export taxes may decline in
Argentina, making prices of that country's wheat crop more
competitive in world markets.</p>
<p>Futures prices fell after being unable to sustain early
gains caused by concern over possible cold-weather damage to
coffee trees in Brazilian growing areas. The September
contract ended with a loss of 1.25 cents a pound at 90.50
cents. Initially, September rose as high as 92.85 cents.
According to Peter Leavitt, executive vice president of
Weather Services Corp., of Bedford, Mass., the southernmost
Brazilian coffee-growing sections, such as Parana and south
central Sao Paulo, early Sunday experienced temperatures of
34 degrees to 37 degrees Fahrenheit. "The temperatures
weren't low enough to cause damage except for some leaf burn
in a few spots," Mr. Leavitt said. The last coffee-damaging
frost in Brazil was in 1981, Mr. Leavitt noted. "Brazil has
had fairly mild temperatures since then in the most southerly
areas, and the lack of cold has allowed the development of
some growth that now could have been slightly affected," Mr.
Leavitt said. Yesterday morning the colder temperatures
reached up into the more northerly areas, "but the readings
were still above those in the south on Sunday," according to
the meteorologist. Temperatures should moderate during the
rest of the week, he said.</p>
