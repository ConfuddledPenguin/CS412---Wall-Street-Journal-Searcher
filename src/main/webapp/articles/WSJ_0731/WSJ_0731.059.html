	<p class="article-leader">I was interested to note that you added a new word to the
French language in your June 22 article on Shamrock Holdings.
You say trefoil is French for shamrock. Until now, trefoil
was not French for shamrock or anything else.
   {The French word for shamrock, actually, is "trefle."}</p>
