	<p class="article-leader">In discussing the Japanese preference for van Gogh (page
one, June 11), you showed just how little you know about
culture in Japan. For most of this century, Japan
scrupulously has maintained laws forbidding the export of
important artworks. It is ludicrous to compare van Gogh's
"Portrait of Dr. Gachet," one of his finest works, with the
17th-century screens, produced in one of Kyoto's anonymous
commercial art studios for tourists, that recently sold at
Christie's for $1.76 million. A Japanese painting even half
the stature of van Gogh's would not be permitted to leave the
country. Works of high quality in Japan can be sold only to
Japanese or to foreigners willing to store their collections
in Japan and fly over to visit them on occasion. In practice,
few Western buyers would recognize a Japanese masterpiece
even if it did come on the auction block in New York.
   Since the great works don't leave Japan, the international
auction market for them is virtually nonexistent. At the van
Gogh level, Japanese art is sold in extremely discreet,
entirely private transactions. In 1984, at the same time that
Mantegna's "Adoration of the Magi" set a world auction record
at $10 million, a masterpiece hand scroll quietly changed
hands in Japan for $13 million. Buyers consider it a
privilege to be given an opportunity to buy a great work of
traditional art at any price. They do not want their
photographs splashed across the world media. Ryoei Saito,
despite his spectacular gesture in buying "Dr. Gachet," is
not one of Japan's leading collectors, just as Alan Bond (who
briefly owned "Irises") does not represent the great
collectors of the West.</p>

would have sold three years ago for about $200,000.</p>
