	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Future textbook references to Murphy's law --
anything that can go wrong, will -- may cite the example of
Smith Corona.
   The stock has plunged 77%, wounding some of Wall Street's
biggest names in the process, in the year since Hanson, the
company's British owner, sold 50% of Smith Corona's stock to
the public at $21 a share.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Since then, the New Canaan, Conn., maker of typewriters
and word processors has presided over slumping profits and
sales, announced three rounds of layoffs and recommended that
its dividend be slashed 67%. Yesterday, in composite trading
on the New York Stock Exchange, the shares closed at 4 3/4.</p>
<p>To Merrill Lynch and Shearson Lehman Brothers, which
managed the public offering, Smith Corona is an embarrassment
and the source of shareholder lawsuits. Hanson views it as "a
black mark" against its own record. And big institutions that
invested in Smith Corona, such as Fidelity Investments,
decline even to talk about it. This is strange because Smith
Corona may be one of Wall Street's best buys.</p>
<p>"Nobody likes the stock now," says Jeffrey Putterman, an
analyst at County NatWest Securities. But Mr. Putterman likes
it. "Either its earnings are going to zero," he says, "or the
stock is cheap."</p>
<p>What Smith Corona suggests is that Wall Street can become
just as irrational about out-of-favor stocks as it does with
stocks that receive its approval.</p>
<p>In fiscal 1990, ended June 30, Smith Corona earned $1.09 a
share. And that was in a year when it suffered intense price
cutting by Asian competitors and a general slump in
big-ticket consumer spending -- trends that the company says
became visible soon after its initial public offering.</p>
<p>This fiscal year, analysts expect Smith Corona will earn
75 cents to $1 a share. How many other companies have
well-established brand names, a dominant (50%) market share
and a stock that is trading for only six times earnings?</p>
<p>Few analysts and investors even bother to ask the
question. What matters most right now is that Smith Corona is
a stock that has burned them -- and badly.</p>
<p>"It has performed so poorly that it evokes extreme
emotional responses," County NatWest's Mr. Putterman says,
adding: "Emotionally we hate this stock. Rationally we rate
it a buy."</p>
<p>Rarely have analysts' predictions turned out so badly.
Weeks after the initial public offering, when Smith Corona
announced the first of its layoffs and saw its stock slide to
18, F. Barry Nelson, an analyst at Louis Nicoud & Associates,
recommended the stock and breezily forecast fiscal 1990
earnings of $2.20 a share.</p>
<p>Merrill Lynch, as recently as March, told clients that it
regarded the dividend as "secure." And in May, Mr. Putterman
issued an update on Smith Corona under the headline: "No
Dividend Cut]"</p>
<p>Mr. Putterman, notable for his candor, says: "I wish every
day I had never recommended the stock." But having liked
Smith Corona at 18, he finds it much more attractive now. The
more usual instinct of the herd -- having scooped up a stock
at a high price -- is to toss it out at a low one.</p>
<p>Fidelity, Weiss Peck & Greer and Equitable Life Assurance
each sold large blocks of Smith Corona stock in the first
quarter of 1990, according to CDA Investment Technologies.
Tom Davis at Weiss Peck & Greer calls it "an incredibly bad
piece of luck, for them and for us," but he declines to
discuss his motivation for selling.</p>
<p>And Mr. Nelson, the Louis Nicoud analyst who touted Smith
Corona at 18, informed his clients last month, when it had
plunged to 6, that the stock had been "dropped from {the}
recommended list." The company's total market value now was
too small, he said, to merit a recommendation; its prospects
"too unclear."</p>
<p>Stocks that are popular benefit from a "story" -- that is,
from a vision of the future which, while based on guesswork,
is highly favorable to the stock in question.</p>
<p>Out-of-favor stocks also bear a story line -- but in their
case, analysts are paragons of prudence. It is as if the
"plus" signs on their calculators suddenly jam; subtraction
becomes the only game.</p>
<p>Wall Street's story line for Smith Corona is that the
company is slowly going out of business. Typewriters and word
processors, it is said, are being replaced by the personal
computer. "The story is that it's a buggy-whip business.
People say it's obsolete," says Dan O'Neil, an analyst with
Dominick & Dominick who lately has been recommending the
stock.</p>
<p>Smith Corona, however, says vast portions of middle
America -- high school students, volunteer committee members,
people who work at home, and the like -- constitute a
continuing and loyal market. It is also expanding, and
quickly, in Europe.</p>
<p>"PCs start at $1,000, usually without a printer," says
William Henderson, a former Hanson executive who recently
took over as Smith Corona's president. "A lot of people can't
afford that." (Smith Corona's typewriters and word processors
run from about $100 to about $599.)</p>
<p>More important, perhaps, is that Smith Corona's machines
bear almost no resemblance to the hunt-and-peck machines that
journalists bent over in 1950s movies. Today's models,
especially its word processors, which were introduced in
1986, have memory, spell checkers, editing and other
features. Its higher-end models do just about the same
word-processing functions as do PCs.</p>
<p>And as PCs have grown less expensive, Smith Corona has had
to add newer features, such as financial spreadsheets, to its
top-line models while it has upgraded even its cheaper
typewriters. Thus, it says its products form a continuum on
the technological scale and should be viewed as part of the
PC business itself.</p>
<p>"It's not the buggy whip of yesterday," Joan Toffolon,
head of investor relations, says of Smith Corona's product.
"It's a task-specific computer."</p>
<p>Smith Corona's distributors -- which, for the most part,
also distribute PCs -- say that if typewriters and word
processors are on their way out, it's news to them.</p>
<p>Cheryl Johnson, a senior buyer for Best Buy, says that
despite continuing pressure from PCs, "there will always be a
market for someone who is scared of the technology or of the
expense."</p>
<p>The proof, though, is in the pudding. Ms. Johnson says
"we're dedicating more shelf space to word processors -- and
computers are very strong here." Similarly, Sears, Roebuck
says word processors "are evolving and improving, making them
competitive with PCs."</p>
<p>Smith Corona's strength is said to be in responding to
consumer demands. Various innovations, such as a product that
would involve facsimile service, are said to be under study.</p>
<p>There's no getting around the slump in Smith Corona's
business. Sales fell 4.4% to $471 million last year;
operating profit fell about 5%. But sales of PCs have also
been sluggish, and no one argues that they are extinct.</p>
<p>And although price-cutting by Asian concerns has forced
Smith Corona to reduce its own prices just as a slowdown in
consumer spending has hit Smith Corona hard, these factors
look different in the context of Smith Corona's recent
record. From 1986 to 1989, annual sales fairly exploded, to
$493 million from $300 million.</p>
<p>It's fair to ask, then, why the bad news didn't start
until right after the initial public offering. Hanson says it
was bad luck. Numerous shareholders have sued Hanson and
Smith Corona and their underwriters alleging that, in effect,
they withheld the bad news until the company went public. The
defendants deny the charges.</p>
<p>Mr. Putterman says he doubts that Hanson intentionally
misled investors. More likely, he says, "Hanson knew Smith
Corona had had a good run and they knew that trees don't grow
to the sky. They wanted to take money off the table."</p>
<p>Karen Levy, an investor relations executive for Hanson,
which retains a 47% interest in Smith Corona, notes that the
offering was a tough sell all along, because "people have an
impression of Hanson as an astute buyer and seller."</p>
<p>As it turned out, the move was a bit too astute. "It has
hurt Hanson; people don't fully trust them," Mr. Putterman
says. Hanson's Ms. Levy concedes that the offering has hurt
the company's ability to shed pieces of other assets. She
adds: "We feel very badly that this happened."</p>
