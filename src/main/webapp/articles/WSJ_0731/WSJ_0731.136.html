	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- It's not always the small investor who takes a
bath.
   Back in the heyday of the 1980s real estate boom, more
than 150 pension funds plowed hundreds of millions of dollars
into the Travelers Corp. real estate fund known as "Separate
Account R." The money was pooled to buy office buildings,
hotels and other commercial properties around the U.S.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Then the real estate market tanked, pulling down the value
of Separate Account R and other real estate pools. But
Travelers' problems with Separate Account R are something
special.</p>
<p>Some of the 146 institutional investors left in Separate
Account R, which has now dwindled to $225 million, are so
irate over Travelers' handling of their money they want the
big insurance company to name an outside manager to take over
the real estate. "It appears that Travelers is incapable of
properly managing Separate Account R," Claude Perrier,
executive director of the $1.8 billion Maine Retirement
System, groused to Travelers in a letter in April.</p>
<p>Among the complaints, some big investors think they have
been charged excessive fees by Travelers, which the insurer
denies. The Dallas Police and Fire Pension Fund has taken the
unusual step of suing Travelers in state court in Dallas,
alleging mismanagement of the account. Travelers, which
requested the suit be moved to federal court, said the
insurer has "strong defenses to the allegations, and we will
certainly assert them."</p>
<p>Meanwhile, almost all the investors in the account --
which include pension plans of Texaco Inc. and Allied-Signal
Inc., the pension account of a Manhattan physician and his
secretary, and even $59 million from Travelers own employee
retirement fund -- have demanded their money back from the
insurer.</p>
<p>In short, Separate Account R has been a monkey on
Travelers' back it is trying hard to shake. "It is our
intention, come hell or high water, to terminate this
account," John Prom, a Travelers second vice president
working on Separate Account R, said at a meeting with
investors this past week. "We want to get back some of the
good will we have lost in this process."</p>
<p>Rarely has the dissatisfaction of institutional investors
with one of their investment managers become as high as that
involving Separate Account R. But despite their size and
supposed clout, the experience of big investors in trying to
get their money out of real estate pools is no better than
that of small investors who bought into real estate limited
partnerships and are now stuck with losing investments.</p>
<p>Although real estate pools are not as liquid as stocks and
bonds, big investors had always assumed they could get their
money with relative ease. That was true as long as real
estate prices were rising, but as the market began to soften
several years ago, there was a rush to join withdrawal lists,
such as those for Separate Account R. Travelers says that
about 90% of the investors in Separate Account R now want
out.</p>
<p>For real estate pools like Separate Account R, withdrawal
demands rise when falling real estate sales prices produce
the least cash to pay off investors. That means investors may
have to wait years for their money and may get back much less
than what they had hoped for as real estate values plummet.
The process has been made even more difficult as the federal
government sells real estate from the portfolios of troubled
savings and loan associations.</p>
<p>"It has not been a fun period for us, and it has not been
a fun period for you, but the real estate market in this
country has been a disaster," Thomas Keating, Travelers
senior vice president, said at the meeting with investors
last week.</p>
<p>At the meeting, Travelers tried to quell the investor
unrest by agreeing to cut the fee it charges on Separate
Account R. The fee, which has been 1% of the assets under
management, will drop by a quarter of a percentage point in
each of the three years that Travelers says it will take to
sell off properties owned by the account.</p>
<p>Travelers also agreed to demands from pension funds that
they be allowed to form a committee to oversee the insurer's
handling of the account. "We have a concern about the ability
of the Travelers to do what they say they are going to do,"
said Maine's Mr. Perrier in proposing the oversight
committee.</p>
<p>Word of Travelers' fee cut and acceptance of the oversight
committee came at the unusual meeting last week with
officials of 20 pension funds. Travelers executives
overseeing Separate Account R admitted mistakes in
communicating with investors, but defended their overall
performance.</p>
<p>"We feel bad about this," Travelers' Mr. Prom said at the
meeting with investors. "We have one goal in this -- that is
to get you your money at maximum value."</p>
<p>High on the list of complaints by pension-fund officials
at the meeting was a decision by Travelers to pay out
withdrawals from the account on a pro-rata basis, instead of
a first-come, first-served basis, as had been done until
Travelers halted withdrawal payments to investors in January.
The switch to pro-rata payments was necessary in a
liquidation process under federal pension regulations,
Travelers officials said.</p>
<p>But pension funds near the front of the line on a
first-come, first-served basis, such as Rohm & Haas Co.'s
pension fund, questioned the switch, because they would
receive less on a pro-rata basis. One allegation in the
Dallas lawsuit is that the Travelers' own employee pension
fund would benefit from the switch, since that fund was lower
down on the withdrawal list.</p>
<p>Travelers said it would fight the lawsuit brought by the
Dallas pension fund, and said that clients weren't consulted
about the switch because there was no choice. "It was not on
the basis of arrogance" that Travelers didn't contact
clients, Mr. Prom said.</p>
<p>At the meeting, Travelers officials said they had
tentative or firm agreements to sell eight Separate Account R
properties for a total of about $40 million -- almost the
same amount at which the properties are currently appraised.</p>
<p>However, under questioning, Travelers officials indicated
that almost all the sale prices were below the original
purchase prices.</p>
<p>"I'm glad they (Travelers officials) finally responded to
some of the pressure and criticism, but I wish they had
started it earlier," Michael McGuire, trustee for the Grand
Rapids, Mich., public employee pension fund, which is a
Separate Account R investor, said yesterday.</p>
<p>"We believe it could be the first step in a process that
will lead to solutions which would be acceptable to all
participants," a Travelers spokesman said of the meeting.</p>
