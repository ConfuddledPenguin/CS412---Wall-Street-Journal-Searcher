	<p class="article-leader">Gov. George Deukmejian and a sufficiency of legislators
have agreed to hit up Californians for $800 million in
miscellany taxes and fees and to install a Gramm-Rudman type
spending fix. This is not exactly a precedent for any budget
deal in Washington. The governor can make this deal stick by
line-item vetoing $400 million from the budget, but President
Bush still has no blue pencil in his kit bag.</p>
