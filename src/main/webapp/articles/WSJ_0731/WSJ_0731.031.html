	<p class="article-leader">BAY SHORE, N.Y. -- Lumex Inc. said that David Hillery,
53-year-old vice president of the health-care products
company and president of its Cybex division, resigned to
pursue other interests.
   Separately, Lumex said it would cut staff through
attrition and dismissals and would pare expenses as it
reported a second-quarter net loss of $849,000, or 20 cents a
share, on 2.2% lower sales. In the 1989 second quarter, Lumex
earned $469,000, or 11 cents a share. Sales eased to $20.8
million from $21.3 million.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>One factor in the weaker results was that U.S. sales of
Cybex's rehabilitation equipment fell from the year-earlier
period; international sales continued to be strong, Lumex
said.</p>
<p>Lumex division sales of bathroom seating and safety aids
for the sick and the elderly rose from the year-ago period
but fell short of expectations, the parent said. The Lumex
division also makes canes, crutches, wheelchairs and other
ambulatory aids.</p>
<p>Lumex employs about 1,030; the company declined to
estimate the number of staff cuts it anticipates.</p>
<p>Lumex expects to return to profitability for the rest of
the year, said Lawrence Cohen, 58, chairman and chief
executive officer. Mr. Cohen will assume Mr. Hillery's duties
in the interim.</p>
<p>Mr. Hillery, who was also a director of Lumex Inc., was
unavailable for comment.</p>
<p>In American Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday,
Lumex shares fell 50 cents, to close at $6.25.</p>
