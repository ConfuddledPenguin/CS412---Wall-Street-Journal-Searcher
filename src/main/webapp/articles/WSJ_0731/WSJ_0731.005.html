	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- The International Monetary Fund approved a
$41 million loan to Honduras to support economic adjustments
in the Central American country during the next 12 months.
   Honduras qualified for the IMF financial assistance after
paying overdue loans.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The IMF noted that Honduras also cleared up its loan
arrears to the World Bank and the Inter-American Development
Bank in late June and early July and thus has regained
eligibility for new credits from all three international
agencies.</p>
