	<p class="article-leader">DALLAS -- National Heritage Inc. and Life Care Centers of
America said they decided to call off their planned merger
because of recent reversals concerning National Heritage
assets.
   Under the terms of a deal struck last April, National
Heritage and its 22% owner Southmark Corp. were to contribute
general partnership interests, management contracts,
mortgages and other assets to a new publicly traded entity in
exchange for a 40% equity stake in the concern.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Life Care Centers, a closely held company based in
Cleveland, Tenn., was to contribute its assets in return for
a 60% stake in the new entity.</p>
<p>Since then, Southmark has ceded control of its private
limited partnerships to Lpimc Inc. of Southbury, Conn., after
losing a proxy contest. Southmark is disputing an apparent
loss in a second proxy vote. The takeovers not only reduce
the Southmark assets to be contributed to the new company,
but also jeopardize National Heritage management contracts at
the nursing homes owned by the syndicates.</p>
<p>National Heritage said it is actively seeking management
and lease contracts with unaffiliated nursing home companies.
It is also streamlining its operations by divesting
subsidiaries unrelated to nursing home care. In New York
Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, National Heritage
stock closed at 68.75 cents a share, down 18.75 cents.</p>
