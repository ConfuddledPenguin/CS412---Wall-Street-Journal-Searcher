	<p class="article-leader">Wang Laboratories Inc. took $417.4 million in one-time
write-downs and restructuring charges, resulting in a widened
net loss of $496.7 million, or $3.01 a share, for the fourth
quarter ended June 30.
   The Lowell, Mass.-based maker of minicomputers and office
automation equipment said revenue continued to decline,
dropping 13% to $652.2 million from $750.9 million.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Despite the loss, Richard W. Miller, chairman and chief
executive officer, was upbeat. He said that without the
one-time charges Wang would have had a loss on continuing
operations of $5.6 million, which he characterized as "near
break-even." He added, "We achieved our fourth-quarter goal
of bringing our operating revenues and operating expenses
into balance."</p>
<p>Mr. Miller, who was brought in as president last summer in
the midst of a financial crisis, predicted that in fiscal
1991, Wang will achieve its first profitable year since
fiscal 1988. He said he doesn't expect any further
write-downs or restructuring charges.</p>
<p>Stock analysts, while praising Wang's cost-cutting moves,
remained skeptical about Wang's future. "The underlying issue
remains whether and when they can get revenue to expand
rather than contract," said Marc Schulman, an analyst with
UBS Securities Inc.</p>
<p>In American Stock Exchange composite trading, Wang Class B
stock rose 25 cents to $4.125.</p>
<p>In the year-earlier fourth quarter, Wang had a net loss of
$374.7 million, or $2.29 a share. That loss included one-time
charges of $234 million and an operating loss of $61.1
million.</p>
<p>Mr. Miller said Wang took the latest round of write-offs
to cover declines in value "in the whole infrastructure
rather than having this plague us as we go forward."</p>
<p>Some of the write-offs involve inventories of unneeded
parts, inventories of older Wang computers, service depot
inventories that aren't needed because new computers are more
reliable then older ones and sales and service facilities
that have been consolidated or have declined in value. He
said Wang has closed an operation that previously rebuilt and
resold Wang computers that were traded in by customers.</p>
<p>Mr. Miller said in the current quarter Wang will reduce
its staff by more than 1,000 people to about 19,500. Wang
currently has 20,900 employees, down 27% from a year earlier.
In Lowell, it has cut employment 34% to 6,085 from 9,174 a
year ago.</p>
<p>Mr. Miller said that after the write-downs "we've done
everything we wanted to do. Revenue and expense are in line."
He noted that Wang has paid off all but $30 million of the
$575 million in bank debt that caused the cash crisis last
year. Despite the charges, Wang has $165 million in cash and
is generating cash from operations, he said.</p>
<p>Mr. Miller declined to predict results for the current
quarter. Jay P. Stevens, an analyst with Dean Witter Reynolds
Inc., said "the tone for the whole industry is to be careful
about (predicting) the summer quarter." He said he thinks
Wang may earn 25 cents a share for the full fiscal year.</p>
<p>For fiscal 1990, Wang reported a net loss of $715.9
million, or $4.35 a share, compared with a net loss of $424.3
million, or $2.59 a share. The latest year includes
restructuring and other special charges of $388.3 million and
losses from discontinued operations of $87.3 million. The
year-earlier period included restructuring and special
charges of $142 million and losses from discontinued
operations of $100.1 million.</p>
<p>Revenue for the year fell 14% to $2.5 billion from $2.91
billion.</p>
