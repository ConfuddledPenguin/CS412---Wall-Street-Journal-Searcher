	<p class="article-leader">Willard Spiegelman, perhaps best known in these quarters
as the Leisure & Arts page's man in Dallas, spends his days
professing English at Southern Methodist University, editing
the Southern Review and writing about poetry, notably
Wordsworth. Lately, however, he has been turning his mind to
poets of his own time. The result is "The Didactic Muse:
Scenes of Instruction in Contemporary American Poetry"
(Princeton, 278 pages, $39.50 cloth, $10.95 paper).
   While Mr. Spiegelman brings a scholar's precision to this
work, he has obviously been at pains to open up the subject
for outsiders, as it were, by showing how the eight writers
he has chosen all have set themselves up as teachers in their
poems. This is something of a radical notion, joining such
apparently unrelated temperaments as the Beat standard bearer
Allen Ginsberg and the patrician James Merrill to a chain of
pedagogic forebears stretching back to the Vergil of the
"Georgics."</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The more immediate mentor of this lyrically educative gang
is W.H. Auden, whose "easy speech," Mr. Spiegelman says,
sounds like meditation "at random" but actually propounds
serious lessons about the state of the world. From Auden, the
analysis proceeds from poet to poet, construing their very
different work as a rhetoric of instruction and
argumentation. If this sounds arid in summary, in the doing
it becomes a didactic revelation, a literal introduction or
leading-in to some great writers, the best of them often
misunderstood.</p>
<p>Adrienne Rich benefits most from this approach. Although
few readers of this feminist poet will be surprised to see
her treated as a didactic, many will be amazed to see how
what may have looked like artless preaching actually gets its
power from an eminently calculated and interesting rhetoric.
As Mr. Spiegelman shows, one of Ms. Rich's characteristic
methods is to make a point with lists (a feature of didactic
poetry as old as Homer's catalog of Greek ships). A woman in
the poem "Transcendental Etude" goes off by herself to the
kitchen and fusses quietly with "bits of yarn, calico and
velvet scraps,/laying them out absently on the scrubbed
boards/in the lamplight, with small rainbow-colored
shells/sent in cotton-wool from somewhere far away/and skeins
of milkweed from the nearest meadow . . ."</p>
<p>Such poetry -- really all serious poetry -- has only a
handful of readers today, perhaps because in a previous
generation, T.S. Eliot and the other high modernists cut
themselves off from the large public poetry had always had
before. The more recent landscape of verse is not nearly such
a dark wood, but its paths need mapping. Mr. Spiegelman has
been working at this task in a timely way, then, and a direct
benefit could accrue from his efforts to Anthony Hecht, whose
complete works have just been republished as "Collected
Earlier Poems" (Knopf, 288 pages, $22.95), along with a new
volume, "The Transparent Man" (Knopf, 96 pages, $18.95). Mr.
Spiegelman also makes it his central task to clarify the
importance of Mr. Merrill's encyclopedic long poem, "The
Changing Light at Sandover," declaring that it "has
permanently altered the course of American poetry for the
rest of our century."</p>

<p>No one needs to be persuaded that management is important
or taught that business's ignore it at their peril. The
difficulty, in a way oddly parallel to the problem of talking
cogently about poetry, is to find a rhetoric, a way into
writing about the subject that will not strike the
intelligent reader as empty, jejune, bombastic or all three
at once. David Asman's job, as editor of this newspaper's
"Manager's Journal" column since 1983, has been to solve this
problem. Now he has edited "The Wall Street Journal on
Managing: Adding Value Through Synergy" (Doubleday Currency,
256 pages, $19.95). All of the essays originally appeared in
the "Manager's Journal," but they have been re-edited for
this book and brought up-to-date, to take into account late
developments in the economy and a rapidly changing
geopolitical setting.</p>
