	<p class="article-leader">GRAND RAPIDS, Mich. -- Foremost Corp. of America said it
plans to buy back up to one million of its common shares.
   The insurance company said the new authorization comes in
addition to a prior stock repurchase plan, under which
Foremost purchased about 1.2 million of its shares since
November 1987. No purchases under the newly authorized plan
have been made, Foremost said.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The company said it will purchase the shares from time to
time, depending on market conditions and availability.
