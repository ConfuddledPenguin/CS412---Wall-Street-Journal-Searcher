	<p class="article-leader">VERIT INDUSTRIES, a real estate concern, said it completed
the private sale of 61,500 shares of a new Series B
convertible preferred stock to a Liechtenstein investment
company for $15.4 million. A spokesman for Verit, based in
Phoenix, Ariz., declined to identify the purchaser. Verit
said it used $14.7 million from the sale proceeds to buy a
67% interest in Touristic Club International AG Vaduz, a
leisure company, which has as its principal asset the Hotel
Viking, a resort hotel in southern Portugal. Each Series B
preferred share is convertible into 100 Verit common shares.
The purchaser agreed to vote its shares in the same manner as
Verit's management for five years. The agreement also places
a limit on the number of common shares that the purchaser may
sell in any 12-month period for five years. Verit is involved
in real estate development in California and Texas.</p>
