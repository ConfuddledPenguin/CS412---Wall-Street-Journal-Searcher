	<p class="article-leader">PITTSBURGH -- Community Bancorp, a bank holding company,
said it declined protection, as allowed, under Pennsylvania's
new anti-takeover law, the nation's toughest, which places
voting restrictions on large shareholders and discourages
so-called greenmail, or a company's buying back its stock
from an unwanted suitor at higher-than-market prices.</p>
