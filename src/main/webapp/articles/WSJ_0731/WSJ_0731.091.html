	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- The House approved a food-labeling measure
that regulates the use of health claims and requires the food
industry to put a uniform nutrition label on almost all
packaged foods.
   The bill was adopted by voice vote after seven major
food-processor groups agreed to a compromise on the volatile
issue of federal pre-emption of state labeling requirements.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"The purpose of this legislation is to make sense of the
confusing array of nutrition labels that confront all
consumers everytime they enter the supermarket," Rep. Henry
Waxman (D., Calif.) told his House colleagues.</p>
<p>The bill would require food manufacturers to relabel
thousands of supermarket products within two years of its
enactment. Under the proposed requirements, the new labels
would list the amount of calories, fat, salt and other
nutrients. The measure would also empower the Food and Drug
Administration to regulate health messages and
disease-prevention claims, dispelling lingering doubts about
the agency's statutory authority in this labeling area.</p>
<p>Some consumer advocates had mixed feelings about the
compromise. "Congress has voted to protect the consumer's
health, but in the process, has made it easier for food
companies to pick the consumer's pocketbook," asserted Bruce
Silverglade, attorney for the Center for Science in the
Public Interest, a Washington-based consumer group. Under the
bill, federal labeling regulations would pre-empt generally
stronger state consumer-protection laws in the realm of
weights and measures, food-quality standards and
ingredient-labeling, Mr. Silverglade complained.</p>
<p>The industry has insisted on uniformity in labeling,
arguing that a proliferation of state labeling laws will only
create consumer confusion and cause costly disruptions in the
food-distribution system. But industry leaders dropped -- at
least for now -- their demand that the legislation pre-empt
state laws similar to California's Proposition 65. Passed in
1986, Proposition 65 requires manufacturers to put health
warnings on any food containing an ingredient believed to
pose a risk of cancer or birth defects.</p>
<p>The compromise legislation, co-sponsored by Rep. Edward
Madigan (R., Ill.). "strikes a better balance" between
consumers and manufacturers, said Manly Molpus, president of
the Grocery Manufacturers of America.</p>
<p>The Senate may take up a similar food-labeling measure
later this week. John Cady, president of the National Food
Processors Association, urged the senators to embrace the
"basic tenets" of the House bill.</p>
<p>The bill, among other things, would require that nutrition
claims such as "low" and "light" be consistent with
food-content definitions to be set by the FDA. "On some
products, `light' means low in fat; on others, such as some
brands of olive oil, it refers to the color of the product,"
Mr. Waxman said on the House floor. "The bill would correct
this deceptive and misleading state of affairs."</p>
<p>As for disease-prevention claims, he said, none could be
made until the FDA has reviewed the scientific evidence and
ruled on the validity of the claim.</p>
<p>The bill would require disclosure of serving size, the
number of servings per container, the number of calories per
serving and the number of calories derived from the total fat
and saturated fat in a serving. It would also require
manufacturers to list on the label the total amount of fat,
saturated fat, unsaturated fat, cholesterol, sodium, sugar,
fiber, protein and carbohydrates.</p>
<p>Restaurant and delicatessen food would be exempt from the
labeling requirements, as would meat and poultry, which are
regulated by the Agriculture Department. Supermarkets would
be expected -- but not required -- to post nutritional
information or pass out brochures regarding fruits,
vegetables and seafood.</p>
<p>The House action is likely to give impetus to the FDA's
efforts to develop a comprehensive nutrition-labeling
package. "From our perspective, the bill and the FDA's
{labeling} proposal are fairly much in agreement," said Frank
Scarbrough, a senior FDA official. "What we've proposed may
give us a leg-up in implementing whatever legislation is
passed."</p>
