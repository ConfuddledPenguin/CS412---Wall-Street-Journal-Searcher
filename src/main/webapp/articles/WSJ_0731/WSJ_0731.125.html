	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- The Bush administration's savings-and-loan
cleanup, which is running as low on political support as it
is on cash, will require about $100 billion in the next 12
months, officials said.
   Even Republicans balked over the short-term costs
disclosed by administration officials before the House
Banking Committee. The new spending plan, which includes $60
billion in "temporary" outlays that the administration hopes
to recoup through sales of S&L assets, won't increase overall
cost projections, but it requires more cash sooner than the
lawmakers had been told to expect.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"The taxpayers of my state are paying too much money for
this cleanup already," said Rep. Chalmers Wylie of Ohio, the
committee's ranking Republican. Added Rep. Thomas Ridge (R.,
Pa.,), "Is this the last moving target we are going to try to
hit?"</p>
<p>Administration officials, who have been looking at ways to
change the S&L bailout law to lower costs, held out other
alarming barometers of the S&L cleanup. The real estate slump
has spread across the nation, adding to losses, they said.
Junk-bond losses from S&Ls seized by the government will
total more than $1 billion. "That would certainly be a
minimum," said William Seidman, chairman of the Resolution
Trust Corp., the bailout agency.</p>
<p>The administration has so far depended on its budget
summit with Congress to consider the S&L funding along with
other fiscal issues. That hardly sat well with Banking
Committee members. "We just don't want to get blind-sided,"
said Chairman Henry Gonzalez (D., Texas).</p>
<p>But if the budget summit doesn't produce an agreement, the
costs of the S&L bailout will be pushed higher, said Robert
Glauber, undersecretary of the Treasury. He predicted that
interest rates will rise if the budget summit fails. "These
institutions are extremely vulnerable to interest rates," he
added.</p>
<p>Most recently, the Bush administration has estimated that
it will cost about $130 billion to protect depositors at sick
S&Ls; it has spent about one-third of that so far.</p>
<p>But that doesn't include two complicating factors that
regularly anger Congress -- interest on the spending and the
temporary cash required to hold S&L investments until they
are sold. Those items, barely discussed when the law was
passed last year, will probably quadruple the costs to exceed
$500 billion in 10 years.</p>
<p>"Now we are looking at reality," said Rep. Bruce Vento,
(D. Minn.), "and see an S&L bailout of Grand Canyon-sized
proportions."</p>
<p>The cleanup could squeak through to the end of January
1991 if Congress committed as little as $5 billion now and
the administration took advantage of a "literal reading" of
an error in the bailout law's language, which would free up
$18 billion more, Mr. Glauber said. Thus, Congress could
avoid committing a more explosive chunk of cash before the
fall election. While Mr. Glauber raised the idea, he didn't
endorse it.</p>
<p>Without new funding, the S&L cleanup will grind to a halt,
probably in the October-December quarter. But the Treasury
already has reached some cleanup limits. It eliminated plans
to replace high-cost brokered deposits at the sick S&Ls with
low-cost Treasury funds. That pushes up interest rates that
all banks and thrifts pay. "We believe that this is a very
high and unwise cost to pay," warned Mr. Seidman.</p>
<p>The White House, meanwhile, is steeling itself for more
election-year criticism for the thrift cleanup, and refused a
request by the National Governors Association to create a
bipartisan commission to investigate the causes of the S&L
mess. "We feel that it's not time to point fingers now, but
it's time to get the money that's owed to the depositors back
in their hands," a White House spokesman said.</p>
<p>But both the administration and Congress are taking a hard
look at how to overhaul -- for the second time in two years
-- thrift and bank regulation. Among the proposals currently
in Congress are those that would expose personal income tax
records of directors of failed S&Ls, freeze lucrative
compensation packages for directors at failed thrifts, and
allow banks and thrifts to extend their branch networks
nationwide.</p>
<p>The administration is examining ways to reduce costs for
the cleanup, too. "We have asked people to start all over
again and see if there are changes in direction that could
change costs," said Mr. Seidman.</p>
<p>That includes a pilot program to sell nine sick thrifts,
not yet seized by the government, to private investors in
coming weeks. Officials believe the thrifts would attract
higher bids, because their value wouldn't have been tarnished
by government seizure.</p>
