	<p class="article-leader">Cyclops Industries Inc., citing lower prices on
flat-rolled steel products and charges related to a
previously announced restructuring, reported a second-quarter
net loss of $11.3 million, or $1.62 a share.
   In the same period a year earlier, the Pittsburgh-based
steelmaker had a profit of $13 million, or $1.81 a share.
Sales fell 12% to $306.2 million from $348.8 million.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Earlier, the company said it expected to report losses for
the quarter and the year as a result of restructuring its
specialty steel division and realigning certain carbon strip
operations.</p>
<p>The restructuring involved separating its Cytemp Specialty
Steel division into two business units and phasing out
certain products. That action will result in the closing of a
Pittsburgh plant in the second half of this year, the company
said. Even without the restructuring charge, Cyclops said the
Cytemp division had a $5.3 million pretax loss for the first
six months of the year compared with a pretax operating
income of $5.3 million in the first six months of 1989.</p>
