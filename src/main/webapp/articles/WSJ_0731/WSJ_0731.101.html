	<p class="article-leader">Banco Espanol de Credito of Spain reported that first-half
pretax profit surged 17% to 35.29 billion pesetas ($357.2
million).
   The bank, known as Banesto, said financial revenue grew
33% to 212.29 billion pesetas, boosted by a 41% jump in loans
and financial instruments. It didn't provide comparative
data.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Banesto's efforts to lure depositors, by offering
high-yield "super accounts" with interest rates of about 13%,
helped increase consumer deposits and bolster financial
revenue, but the accounts also sharply raised financial
costs, which soared 50% to 142.87 billion pesetas, the bank
said.</p>
<p>Analysts said the results were better than expected, and
noted that Spain's big banks have been able to offset the
burden of high-yield accounts by increasing loan rates and
service charges.</p>
