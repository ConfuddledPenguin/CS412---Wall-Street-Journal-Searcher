	<p class="article-leader">MOBILE, Ala. -- There's no mistaking what's on the minds,
if not the lips, of the nation's governors: more new taxes.
   Thirty-one states, plus Puerto Rico and the District of
Columbia, have raised taxes since January, and the governors
who are conducting their annual summer meeting among the
battleships, antebellum mansions and chigger-weed of this
Gulf port believe that more new taxes may be on the way.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>These governors, so often contemptuous of the federal
government, believe they have a fresh lesson for Congress and
President Bush. They're convinced there's little to the
Washington wisdom that taxes are political hemlock.</p>
<p>"As a conservative Republican, I raised taxes," says Gov.
Norman Bangerter of Utah. "I survived."</p>
<p>Washington appears to be in paralysis over taxes -- a
philosophical deadlock over whether taxes are an instrument
of government tyranny combined with a political deadlock on
how to steer out of the tyranny of a $160 billion deficit.
But increasing numbers of governors are coming to regard tax
packages as symbols of resolve and leadership.</p>
<p>"The reality is that every governor who did anything in
the 1980s made tough decisions on taxes and the people ended
up supporting them," says Democratic Gov. Richard Celeste of
Ohio. "No governor succeeded in the '80s without raising
taxes."</p>
<p>The governors also are regarding the tax packages that
have been passed in recent years -- every state raised some
taxes in the past decade -- as symbols of what they consider
Washington's lack of responsibility.</p>
<p>"We're talking about taxes because we have to pick up so
much from the federal government," says GOP Gov. George
Mickelson of South Dakota. Gov. Ray Maybus of Mississippi, a
Democrat, adds: "It's particularly hard to run a state
government when you have a federal government that is
retreating in a lot of areas, leaving mandates for the states
but no money to pay for these things."</p>
<p>It was in this political atmosphere that the Bush
administration lobbied its latest revenue plan, a proposal to
limit the deductibility of state and local taxes. The plan is
regarded on Capitol Hill as little more than an opening
bargaining tactic and is not expected to be part of a final
budget agreement.</p>
<p>But the governors, mindful of the tactic, still regarded
it as consistent with Washington's disregard for the states.
"This was just another way for the federal government to push
on the states to pay for a federal mess," says Democratic
Gov. James Blanchard of Michigan.</p>
<p>Federal grants to state and local governments dropped by
more than a third in real dollars in the decade of the 1980s,
leaving the governors in the familiar position of having to
do more with less. "We've been asked to pick up burden after
burden after burden," says Democratic Gov. Michael Dukakis of
Massachusetts.</p>
<p>"I'm trying to run a state with the same real dollars it
was run on in 1981," says Democratic Gov. George Sinner of
North Dakota. "There comes a time when we all have to tell
people we have to raise taxes."</p>
<p>The irony is that the distaste for taxes at the federal
level has made new taxes at the state level all but
unavoidable. "The federal spigot may have been turned off,
but the mandates to act remain," says Burdette Loomis, a
political scientist at the University of Kansas. "A lot of
governors have been forced to raise taxes more than they
otherwise might have because of the rhetoric from Washington.
A lot of this stuff has to be paid for, whether the president
says, `No new taxes' or not."</p>
<p>The result: "Washington is telling us to cut something
else or raise taxes," says Democratic Gov. Bob Miller of
Nevada.</p>
<p>The momentum toward higher taxes is so strong that,
according to the National Conference of State Legislatures,
only Hawaii and Indiana reduced taxes this year more than 1%.
In all, 11 states voted to increase revenue by more than 5%.</p>
<p>"This will almost certainly continue as long as clear
education and infrastructure needs aren't met by the federal
government," says Democratic Gov. Bill Clinton of Arkansas.</p>
<p>Steven Gold, director of the Center for the Study of the
States at the Nelson Rockefeller Institute of Government in
Albany, N.Y., believes that 1991 could be the biggest year
for state-tax increases in 20 years. Mr. Gold's estimates are
based on projections that state Medicaid spending will
increase by 14% this year, prison spending will continue to
grow as the drug war continues, and revenue shortfalls will
develop in several states.</p>
<p>All of this comes against the backdrop of President Bush's
remarks that he believes new revenue must be a part of a
final budget agreement in Washington. "For the last 11 years,
the public has been told that we don't need to pay taxes,"
says William Keach, a University of North Carolina political
scientist. "But now that at least people in Washington can
talk about taxes, governors seem a little more free to do so
as well. The anti-tax culture may be waning."</p>
<p>None of these governors is arguing, however, that the tax
revolt is over.</p>
<p>"It's just as difficult to talk about taxes as before,"
says Republican Gov. Stan Stephens of Montana. "People don't
like taxes, but they like services, and governors have to try
to accommodate that."</p>
<p>The governors who have succeeded in pressing tax plans
have almost always tied new revenue to specific spending.
"People are willing to pay more taxes for education if we can
show them results," says GOP Gov. Carroll Campbell of South
Carolina. This year, in fact, six states raised both sales
and income taxes to devote more resources to education, while
two more raised only sales taxes for education.</p>
<p>The principle applies in other areas of government
services as well. In Delaware, for example, increased revenue
from higher cigarette taxes was directed to health-care
spending, with boosts in the gasoline tax going to underwrite
highway construction.</p>
<p>"Taxes aren't political death if there's a demonstrated
need," says GOP Gov. Michael Castle. "The key is to make sure
people don't think there's a lot of waste."</p>
<p>While many of the governors applauded the president for
moving away from his no-new-taxes vow, there remains deep
skepticism toward Washington. Gov. Clinton of Arkansas
worries that the president's changed position may actually
make it more difficult for all politicians to govern.</p>
<p>"Now he's saying `unread my lips,' " says Mr. Clinton.
"This has contributed, along with the savings-and-loan
crisis, to eroding confidence in government. The American
people liked President Bush and trusted him, and now that
he's changing his tune he's hurting all politicians."</p>
