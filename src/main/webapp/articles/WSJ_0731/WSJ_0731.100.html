	<p class="article-leader">Arkla Inc. said it agreed to acquire Diversified Energies
Inc. in a $630 million common stock transaction that would
substantially enlarge Arkla's natural gas distribution and
production businesses.
   Arkla said it would exchange between 1.575 and 1.752 of
its common shares for each share of Minneapolis-based
Diversified Energies. Arkla, a Shreveport, La.-based concern,
said it would issue between 25 million and 26 million common
shares in the transaction, with the exact number to be
determined immediately before closing the deal.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Arkla currently has about 86 million shares outstanding;
Diversified about 16 million.</p>
<p>Arkla, which had 1989 revenue of about $2.2 billion,
operates natural gas distribution pipelines and produces
natural gas. Diversified, with 1989 revenue of about $840
million, has gas distribution pipelines and gas production
operations as well as some manufacturing operations.</p>
<p>Directors of the companies have approved the proposed
acquisition, Arkla said, but shareholders of both still must
vote on it. Arkla shares rose 25 cents yesterday in composite
trading on the New York Stock Exchange, closing at $23.75.
Diversified shares, also traded on the Big Board, rose 87.5
cents to close at $29.625.</p>
<p>The acquisition would expand not only Arkla's gas
distribution network but also its gas production activities.
Diversified's Dyco Petroleum unit has exploration and
production operations in the gas-rich Anadarko Basin in
Oklahoma that would complement Arkla's existing base in the
Arkoma Basin along the Arkansas-Oklahoma border.</p>
<p>In an interview, Thomas (Mack) McLarty, Arkla chairman and
chief executive officer, estimated that the acquisition would
increase Arkla's total natural gas reserves to about 920
billion cubic feet from roughly 800 billion cubic feet. The
move would boost the number of states in which Arkla operates
to 11 from eight.</p>
<p>The acquisition also "gives us leverage to increase gas
prices because we {would} have increased production," Mr.
McLarty said.</p>
<p>Arkla said the acquisition would give it a total of 2.6
million customers, up from about two million now, making it
the nation's third largest natural gas distribution company
in terms of customers. Two California utilities, Pacific Gas
& Electric Co. and a unit of Pacific Lighting Corp., are
larger using that measure.</p>
<p>Mr. McLarty predicted that the proposed transaction would
boost Arkla's 1991 revenue to about $5 billion from an
expected $3 billion in 1990.</p>
