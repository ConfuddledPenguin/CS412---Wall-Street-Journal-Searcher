	<p class="article-leader">Emerson Radio Corp., of North Bergen, N.J., blamed
"extremely disappointing sales" for a fiscal first-quarter
loss of $4.8 million, or 13 cents a share.
   In the year-earlier quarter, net income was $3.5 million,
or 10 cents a share. The maker and marketer of consumer
electronics reported sales for the quarter ended June 30 of
$167.8 million, down 24% from $221.2 million a year earlier.
Stephen L. Lane, president, said in a statement that he
expects the next two quarters to be profitable, "assuming
moderate improvement in the retail environment."</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Mr. Lane said that because of "softness in the retail
marketplace, retailers have remained cautious in acquiring
inventory." He said Emerson has in turn become conservative,
reducing its own inventories from the prior quarter and
taking cost-paring steps.</p>
<p>During the past year, Emerson introduced a line of
personal computers and related products for the home office
and consumer markets.</p>
