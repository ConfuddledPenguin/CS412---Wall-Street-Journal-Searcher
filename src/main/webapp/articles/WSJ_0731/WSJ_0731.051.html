	<p class="article-leader">The rush into stock mutual funds is petering out. Stock
funds took in $1.7 billion more than investors withdrew in
June, a much smaller inflow than May's $4.4 billion. And fund
industry executives say that sales are continuing to slide.
   "Business has slowed a little bit," says Robert Leo,
Shearson Lehman Hutton's director of mutual funds. "We're not
seeing the level of activity {in stock and bond funds} we saw
earlier in the year."</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Stock fund inflows in June were the most sluggish since
January. Sales easily outpaced redemptions during the month,
but investors switched more money out of stock funds than
they switched in.</p>
<p>That pattern continued into July. At Fidelity Investments,
stock fund inflows so far this month are down compared with
June. Although new stock fund sales have stayed strong,
current holders have taken profits by switching money out of
stock funds and into Fidelity's other funds. Massachusetts
Financial Services, meanwhile, reports a slight net outflow
from its stock funds this month. Vanguard Group says that
while July's net flow into stock funds is comparable with
June's, current holders have been switching out of stock
funds.</p>
<p>But few fund executives are complaining. Despite the
recent sales slowdown, 1990 promises to be a banner year for
mutual fund companies. According to the Investment Company
Institute, stock funds have had net inflows of $13.8 billion
so far this year, putting the industry on track for its best
year ever. This figure includes new sales less redemptions,
plus the net result of switches between stock funds and other
funds in the same fund family. Reinvested dividends are
excluded.</p>
<p>Fund managers turned moderately more bullish in June,
cutting their cash positions to 10.9% of assets from 11.3% in
May. It was the second consecutive month in which fund
managers cut back their cash hoards.</p>
<p>But the bulls may have pulled in their horns during July,
according to figures from Indata, a service of Gordon,
Haskett & Co. Indata, which keeps tabs on 57 stock mutual
funds with $22 billion in assets, says the cash position at
these funds now stands at 10.3%, up from 10% at the end of
June.</p>
<p>International funds remain the industry's hottest stock
fund product, pulling in $3.9 billion so far this year.
During July, T. Rowe Price Associates' three international
funds accounted for 57% of stock fund sales at the
Baltimore-based fund group. Oppenheimer Management Co.'s
Global Fund has been the fund group's top seller this month,
accounting for 30% of all sales. Fidelity's new Worldwide
Fund, a global stock fund launched in late May, has already
pulled in $71 million. A global mutual fund can invest both
in the U.S. and internationally.</p>
<p>Among bond funds, "there's been an international
short-term bond product that has really caught the public's
imagination," says Shearson's Mr. Leo. Since the marketing
success of the $2.4 billion Alliance Short-Term Multi-Market
Fund, which invests in foreign bonds with less than three
years to maturity, other fund groups have been rushing to
bring out similar products. The SLH Short Term World Income
Fund, which was brought out this month, has pulled in $100
million. The Merrill Lynch Short-Term Global Income Fund,
launched in June, has raised $1.3 billion so far.</p>
<p>In June, high-yielding junk bond funds pulled in $171
million more than they surrendered to departing holders. That
marked the second month in a row of positive net inflows
after 10 months in which junk funds hemorrhaged assets.</p>
<p>But overall, June was a slower month for bond fund sales.
Despite the upturn in junk, bond funds had net inflows of
just $1 billion, half of May's total. The biggest losers were
government bond funds, which lost $719 million.</p>
<p>Bond fund sales appear to have recovered in July. Fidelity
reports strong new net inflows, with long-term government
bond funds, municipal bond funds and junk among the biggest
winners. At Vanguard, July's net inflows into taxable funds
are running 40% ahead of June, and sales of municipal funds
are 35% ahead of last month's pace.</p>
<p>At Franklin Resources, July's gross sales of municipal
bond funds are up 18% from June's pace. Much of the money
went into municipal bond funds holding bonds with maturities
of 20 years or longer.</p>
<p>Gregory Johnson, a marketing vice president at Franklin,
says investors' interest in long-term munis probably reflects
fears of rising state and federal taxes and the prospect of a
decline in interest rates.</p>
<p>Acorn Fund, one of the top performing small-company growth
funds, has closed its doors to new investors.</p>
<p>The $950 million fund said that its assets have been
growing rapidly and that its size was getting "unwieldy" in
relation to its investment objective. Current Acorn Fund
holders still can add to their accounts.</p>
<p>The fund, managed by Ralph Wanger since 1970, returned
16.7% a year for the decade ended in June, compared with
13.9% for the average small-company growth fund tracked by
Lipper Analytical Services Inc. Acorn Fund joins a
distinguished list of top funds that are closed to new
investors, including Mutual Shares, Sequoia Fund and Windsor
Fund.</p>
