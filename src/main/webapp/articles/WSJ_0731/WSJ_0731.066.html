	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Stock prices closed mixed as the market's
focus shifted from concerns about the economy to a brighter
outlook for interest rates.
   The Dow Jones Industrial Average, which dropped more than
23 points in early trading in a continuation of a sell-off
Friday, bounced back from the decline to finish with a gain
of 18.82 at 2917.33.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Several waves of futures-related program buying, which
traders attributed to a strong showing by the bond market,
helped push stock prices higher in the last hour of trading.</p>
<p>"Everyone's looking at rates as a reason to be bullish,"
said Christopher Pedersen, head of trading at Twenty-First
Securities, following Friday's report that gross national
product rose at a slower-than-expected annual rate of 1.2% in
the second quarter.</p>
<p>Utility stocks, among the most sensitive to rate
expectations, were among the issues to set the pace for the
market's turnaround. The Dow Jones Utilities Average equaled
its sharpest rise since mid-May by gaining 3.70 to 207.05.</p>
<p>Investors also continued to show buying interest in oil
stocks in the wake of OPEC's agreement last week to raise the
target price for crude oil by $3 a barrel, to $21, and adopt
a new production ceiling for the second half.</p>
<p>But the reversal didn't translate into a pickup in the
pace of trading activity. Volume amounted to 146,470,000
shares on the New York Stock Exchange; on Friday, 149,700,000
changed hands as the industrial average fell 22.28 points.</p>
<p>Declining issues outnumbered advancers by 792 to 717 on
the Big Board. Standard & Poor's 500-Stock Index rose 2.11 to
355.55, the New York Stock Exchange Composite Index went up
0.86 to 194.18 and the Dow Jones Equity Market Index added
1.57 to 329.49.</p>
<p>In late trading, Treasury notes and bonds showed gains of
as much as 7/8 point, or $8.75 per $1,000 face amount. The
increase in prices translates into lower yields on Treasury
issues; for example, the yield on the benchmark 30-year bond
fell to 8.40% from 8.48% late Friday.</p>
<p>Bond prices closed near session highs, and traders said
that performance fueled buying in stock-index futures. As the
futures contracts rallied to sharp premiums to the cash
indexes, traders started selling the futures and buying
baskets of stocks to lock in profits; at least three waves of
index-arbitrage buying hit the market in the last hour of the
session.</p>
<p>Solid gains in three oil stocks -- Exxon, Chevron and
Texaco -- accounted for about half of the advance in the
industrial average. Exxon added 1 1/2 to 50 3/4 in Big Board
composite trading of 1.6 million shares, Chevron climbed 1
3/4 to 79 and Texaco rose 1 3/8 to 62 7/8.</p>
<p>Among other major oil issues, Mobil rose 5/8 to 65 1/8 on
1.6 million shares and Amoco added 1/2 to 54 3/4. In the oil
field-services sector, Halliburton rose 7/8 to 53 1/4, Baker
Hughes added 3/4 to 31 and Schlumberger went up 3/8 to 63
1/8.</p>
<p>But Ashland Oil, which dropped 1 1/8 to 33 5/8, was left
out of the sector's advance. The decline came amid a block
trade of 500,000 shares, equivalent to 0.9% of the company's
common stock outstanding, which traded at 33.</p>
<p>Issues that paced the advance in the Dow utility average
included Consolidated Edison of New York, which went up 1 to
24; Peoples Energy, up 1 to 22 3/4; Commonwealth Edison, up 1
to 31 3/4, and Pacific Gas & Electric, up 5/8 to 22 5/8.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the Dow Jones Transportation Average fell 9.67
to 1125.00 as airline stocks were hit with selling,
reflecting the impact of higher oil prices on jet-fuel costs
and worries about the economy.</p>
<p>AMR, the parent company of American Airlines, dropped 7/8
to 55 3/4; Delta Air Lines fell 5/8 to 64 5/8, and USAir
Group slipped 1/4 to 22. UAL tumbled 6 1/8 to 156 7/8;
Chemical Banking withdrew as one of the five lead banks for
the proposed $4.38 billion employee buy-out of the parent of
United Airlines.</p>
<p>Entergy dropped 1/4 to 19 1/2 on 1.4 million shares in the
wake of a board meeting Friday, at which the utility's
directors voted to boost the size of a stock buy-back
program. Some investors were disappointed that the board
didn't approve a dividend increase, Salomon Brothers analyst
Gregory B. Enholm said; however, he added that he is
recommending the stock at $19 a share or less.</p>
<p>Shawmut National fell 5/8 to 9 3/8 in trading that
included a block of 1.1 million shares, the equivalent of a
1.5% stake in the bank holding company. The block, which
changed hands at 9, accounted for the bulk of the 1.4 million
shares traded in composite dealings.</p>
<p>Limited Inc. rose 7/8 to 20 3/4 following news of its
plans to develop a $300 million to $325 million shopping
mall, to be anchored by a number of the company's own stores,
on a site it owns in Columbus, Ohio.</p>
<p>Genentech added 3/8 to 28 1/8. A Food and Drug
Adminstration advisory committee voted to recommend approval
of the company's gamma interferon drug, used to treat a rare
disorder in which children suffer recurring infections.</p>
<p>Broad Inc. went down 5/8 to 9 3/8. The company said fiscal
1990 net income may fall short of its target of $1.20 a
share, based on "a modestly higher level" of investment
losses than expected earlier in the year.</p>
<p>Equitable Real Estate Shopping Centers gained 5/8 to 6
7/8. The partnership, which owns shopping malls in the
suburbs of Detroit and Minneapolis, said it is evaluating the
possible sale of its assets.</p>
<p>The American Stock Exchange Market Value Index fell 1.84
to 353.65. Volume totaled 10,590,000 shares.</p>
<p>California Energy added 3/8 to 9 3/4. The company said it
has begun settlement discussions with Mission Power
Engineering in a dispute over a contract for engineering and
construction work on three geothermal power plants.</p>
<p>New Line Cinema dropped 3/4 to 12 following its
second-quarter earnings report, which showed that revenue was
more than triple the year-earlier level and net income
soared.</p>
<p>Air Express International rose 3/4 to 18. The company
reported that net for the quarter climbed 36% from a year
ago.</p>
