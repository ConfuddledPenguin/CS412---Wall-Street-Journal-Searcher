	<p class="article-leader">FARMINGTON, Conn. -- Otis Elevator Co. said it is forming
a joint venture in the Soviet Union to pursue the $1
billion-a-year market for new elevators.
   Otis, a wholly owned subsidiary of United Technologies
Corp., said it will own 55% of a new company that will
manufacture, install and service elevators in the Soviet
Union using Otis designs, manufacturing technology, and
installation and maintenance methods. The rest of the
partnership will be formed by Shcherbinka Lift Plant, a unit
of Liftmash, the Soviet agency responsible for making
elevators.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Otis said it also will supply manufacturing equipment,
management personnel and training for Soviet workers at a new
facility under construction at the existing Shcherbinka Lift
Plant, 15 miles from Moscow. The plant will make elevator
equipment for offices and small hotels, Otis said.</p>
<p>The Soviet Union is the world's largest national market
for new elevator equipment, with demand for 60,000 new units
a year, Otis said.</p>
<p>Otis is the world's largest elevator company, with 1989
revenue of $3.3 billion, 70% of which came from outside of
the U.S.</p>
<p>United Technologies, based in Hartford, Conn., also has
interests in aerospace, air conditioning and automotive
products.</p>
