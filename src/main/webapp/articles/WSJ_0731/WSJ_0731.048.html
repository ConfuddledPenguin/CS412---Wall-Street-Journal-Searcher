	<p class="article-leader">LOS ANGELES -- Even William Hubner's enemies concede that
he has done well.
   At the age of 20, the entrepreneur started his own
barbell-making company. In the decades since, the 56-year-old
Mr. Hubner has built a multimillion-dollar fitness empire. He
owns several homes, a yacht and a private jet.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>But along the way, Mr. Hubner bilked business partners and
consumers by draining assets from clubs and then closing
them, some former associates and law enforcement officials
charge in lawsuits.</p>
<p>Mr. Hubner says allegations of wrongdoing on his part are
"bogus bull." He says dishonest partners have filched his
assets and spread lies about him. And he has filed suit
against some of the people accusing him.</p>
<p>With one countercharge after another, the warfare offers a
sobering lesson in the pitfalls of partnership for
entrepreneurs. Indeed, the one thing that Mr. Hubner and his
former associates can agree upon is that life for each would
have been much calmer if they had never met.</p>
<p>The seeds for much of this discontent were planted in
1981, when Mr. Hubner and others bought control of Health
Industries Inc., a money-losing chain of about 140 health
clubs nationwide.</p>
<p>Critics argue in court documents that Mr. Hubner bought
Health Industries with the idea of draining the clubs of
millions of dollars of assets and eventually closing them. To
insulate himself from angry customers, Mr. Hubner set up
"shell" corporations to own the clubs and offered minority
interests in the clubs to "unwitting" local partners who were
supposed to help operate the facilities, three former Hubner
associates assert in a lawsuit filed in Philadelphia federal
court. When the clubs failed, Mr. Hubner would blame the
minority partners, the suit says.</p>
<p>James Latham, one of the former associates suing Mr.
Hubner, says he was long entranced by Mr. Hubner. "He can
charm you to death," says Mr. Latham.</p>
<p>The two eventually became partners in health clubs in
Arizona, which Mr. Latham operated. The clubs were doing well
until one day in June 1983, when Mr. Latham returned to his
office to find that Mr. Hubner had ordered it closed, had
terminated all the employees and ordered some $1.5 million in
cash, accounts receivable and computer equipment taken away,
according to Mr. Latham's lawsuit. Mr. Hubner's actions
"broke the back" of the Arizona operation, says Mr. Latham.</p>
<p>Aside from the business loss, Mr. Latham says he feels
betrayed. "I would have done anything for this guy," he says.</p>
<p>Mr. Hubner denies the charges in the Philadelphia suit,
and an attorney for Mr. Hubner says that any transfer of
assets from the Arizona operation had Mr. Latham's permission
and didn't harm the clubs. Mr. Hubner says most of the Health
Industries clubs have been closed, but says that's because
they couldn't be turned around due to aging facilities and
poor locations. He says almost all members were placed in
other nearby clubs.</p>
<p>One of Mr. Hubner's most tenacious critics is Win Paris.
The two became partners by default when Mr. Hubner bought
Health Industries, which co-owned four Los Angeles area
health clubs with Mr. Paris. In a lawsuit in Los Angeles
county court, Mr. Paris asserts that Mr. Hubner and others
defrauded him of his interest in the clubs and then closed
them.</p>
<p>The 58-year-old Mr. Paris says that before he met Mr.
Hubner he was a multimillionaire with a six-figure annual
income from his fitness businesses and a fancy home by the
Pacific Ocean. Because of Mr. Hubner, "I was financially
wiped out," says Mr. Paris, who several years ago changed his
name from Irwin to Win because he felt it gave a more
positive image. He says he had to move into a small apartment
with his 82-year-old mother. He says he even contemplated
suicide.</p>
<p>Instead, he decided to fight and launched what he now
calls the "spa wars" against Mr. Hubner, a battle that has
already consumed half a decade of litigation and
name-calling. Mr. Paris says he has rummaged through trash
bins seeking incriminating documents, and at one point even
assaulted and broke the nose of one of Mr. Hubner's
attorneys.</p>
<p>Mr. Hubner calls Mr. Paris a "loser" and says his charges
are "scurrilous garbage." He insists he had nothing to do
with Mr. Paris's financial misfortunes. In a suit pending in
Los Angeles County court, Mr. Hubner and others claim that
"false" and "defamatory" statements by Mr. Paris about them
to lenders, employees and customers undermined the business
of the four Los Angeles clubs.</p>
<p>But law-enforcement officials echo some of the complaints
of Mr. Hubner's former associates. In a 1985 lawsuit filed in
Louisville state court, the Kentucky attorney general
contended that corporations Mr. Hubner controlled "drained"
income and assets from a local spa to the point that it
couldn't pay its utility bills and had to close. At the same
time they were draining the club, Mr. Hubner and his
companies continued selling long-term memberships to the
public, the suit contended.</p>
<p>Mr. Hubner and his companies recently settled that suit by
paying about $18,000, two-thirds of the damages that had been
sought by the state. The defendants didn't admit any
wrongdoing.</p>
<p>Still pending is a suit by the Pennsylvania attorney
general against Mr. Hubner, a former partner and several of
their companies. The suit, in a Harrisburg state court,
charges the defendants with "unfair or deceptive acts" in
connection with the marketing of memberships for five health
clubs that eventually were closed.</p>
<p>In an April letter to Mr. Paris, J. Douglas Austin, the
Pennsylvania deputy attorney general handling the case, said
he had little hope that individual state actions would affect
Mr. Hubner. He said he believed the federal government should
take a look at Mr. Hubner's operations nationwide. But in his
letter and a subsequent interview, Mr. Austin said he didn't
know of any such federal probe under way.</p>
<p>Mr. Hubner's attorney complained about Mr. Austin's
statements and got a letter of apology from his boss. That
letter said that as a matter of policy the attorney general's
office doesn't "characterize any person's conduct" outside of
appropriate legal proceedings.</p>
<p>Mr. Austin was "duped" by talking too much with Mr. Paris,
asserts Mr. Hubner. Mr. Austin says he stands by his
statements.</p>
