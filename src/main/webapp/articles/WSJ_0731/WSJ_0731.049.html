	<p class="article-leader">The war in Afghanistan supposedly ended with the peace
accords guaranteed by the U.S. and Soviet Union in 1988. Two
years after the Soviet occupation troops rolled home, the war
goes on. The Soviet puppet ruler Najib still holds sway in
Kabul, the mujahedeen rebels still are fighting Najib, some
of the rebels are fighting each other and Afghan watchers
warn of another Lebanon. Shaping a genuine peace remains one
of the messier tasks facing Secretary of State Baker, who
will tackle the project again later this week in talks with
Soviet Foreign Minister Shevardnadze.
   The two sides are haggling over the terms of a complex
post-peace-accords peace settlement. The U.S. wants Najib to
step down, opening the way for internationally supervised,
fair elections. This would give the rebels at least a chance
of sorting out their factional disputes without gunfire. The
Soviets have a fair idea who might win an election, so insist
that Najib preside over an "election."</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>What's at stake here goes beyond the borders of
Afghanistan. It's common wisdom by now that smoothing out
wrinkles such as Afganistan's war is just one of those odd
jobs left over from the Evil Empire days. The assumption, as
Mr. Baker and President Bush negotiate new arms treaties and
consider Soviet requests for aid, is that the Soviet Union
has pretty much abandoned its adventures abroad.</p>
<p>But in Asia, where no Communist government has fallen yet,
the old Empire's dark side remains on show. There, the
Soviets, for all their talk of peace, have done little more
than put their adventures on hold. There has been no
reduction in the force of their Pacific fleet, the biggest of
their four fleets. The Soviets continue to supply the
Vietnamese army, which still keeps troops in Laos and
Cambodia.</p>
<p>Though the Soviet army finally was beaten back in 1988 by
the Afghan resistance, the Soviet Union still supplies
Najib's regime with military aid variously estimated at $3 to
$5 billion a year. This is more than 10 times what the U.S.
supplies to the guerrillas, and more than five times what the
guerrillas get from all sources, including Saudi Arabia and
America.</p>
<p>Soviet aid since the vaunted 1988 troop pullout has
included such hardware as hundreds of tanks, armored
personnel carriers and SCUD surface-to-surface missiles.
According to the U.S. special envoy to the Afghan resistance,
Peter Tomsen, as of April, "Over 1,700 SCUDs have been
supplied since the Soviet pullout; more than 1,400 have been
fired." The Soviet-backed Afghan secret police, or KHAD,
estimated at some 20,000 strong, also protects the regime.</p>
<p>It is preposterous for the Soviet Union to be pouring
billions of dollars of military supplies into Afghanistan
while pleading with the West for aid. No one should forget
that it is the Soviet-backed government in Kabul that caused
the deaths of one million Afghans and drove another five
million into refugee camps these past 11 years.</p>
<p>Before Mr. Baker resumes haggling with a Soviet government
that still does not play fair in Afghanistan, there should be
one clear condition. The Soviets must cut their aid to
Najib's Communist regime. Only then will there be a chance of
peace. If the Soviets refuse, the conclusion must be that in
Asia at least the Evil Empire still bides its moment.</p>
