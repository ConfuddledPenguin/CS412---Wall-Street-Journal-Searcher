	<p class="article-leader">MCCANDLESS, Pa. -- When the late Igor Sikorsky built the
first helicopter 50 years ago, he dreamed of one in every
garage. Hereabouts, only Frank Zokaites has one, but Mr.
Sikorsky's dream already seems a nightmare to the neighbors.
   From the lawn behind his Tudor-style house in this leafy
Pittsburgh suburb, Mr. Zokaites climbs into his two-seater,
starts the engines and rises into the sky. Neighbors round up
their kids and seethe at the noise. "It's like Vietnam," Jeff
D. Bergman says. Paul Spurney, who lives up the street and
worries about a crash, says, "The noise is a nuisance, but
safety is the No. 1 issue." His wife, Darlene Spurney, adds,
"If we wanted to move near an airport we would have."</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Despite fear and controversy, sales of small, personal-use
helicopters are taking off. American manufacturers delivered
403 last year, up 51% from the year before and more than
three times the number in 1985.</p>
<p>R22 Betas, built by Robinson Helicopter Co. in Torrance,
Calif., account for more than 75% of U.S. personal helicopter
sales. The R22 is "affordable, easy to take care of and
parkable in the garage," says Barbara K. Robinson, marketing
vice president. Still, affordability lies in the eye of the
beholder. The R22's base price is $99,000.</p>
<p>Ms. Robinson's husband -- company founder and president
Frank Robinson, an engineer -- says he started his company in
1973 because he could interest none of the big helicopter
makers who formerly employed him in building a small,
personal helicopter. The industry's biggies, including Mr.
Sikorsky's old company, now a division of United Technologies
Corp, shun little choppers to turn out turbine-powered models
starting at $500,000 and running into the millions of dollars
each.</p>
<p>The R22, smallest of the piston-powered models, stands
nearly nine feet high and isn't quite 29 feet long from the
front tip of its twin-blade main rotor to the rear tip of the
tail rotor. The main rotor has a span of 25-feet two-inches.
Landing pads can be as simple as a small area marked in the
grass, with a wind sock.</p>
<p>Although the R22 is beyond the reach of the masses, it
competes with luxury sports cars and yachts for wealthy
buyers. "It's become a status thing," says Mr. Robinson.
"Like having a Maserati." Maseratis are cheaper to operate,
though. Mr. Robinson says the R22, which cruises at 110 mph,
costs about $42 an hour, or 38 cents a mile, to fly. That
includes maintenance but not liability and hull insurance,
which run around $5,500 a year.</p>
<p>Still, owners trumpet the choppers' ability to leap over
suburban sprawl, and snarled traffic. During the past year
Andrew Wolf, a Beverly Hills developer, took flight lessons,
bought a $230,000, three-seat Enstrom F28F Falcon and
installed a helipad at his ranch outside Los Angeles. He
expects to get his pilot's license this summer and then use
his four-cylinder, turbocharged aircraft, built by Enstrom
Helicopter Corp. in Menominee, Mich., to zip him to
development sites and an airport near his office.</p>
<p>Jim Goodman, a Thousand Oaks, Calif., chiropractor, says
his Hollywood practice requires him occasionally to land on
movie sets, mansion lawns, tennis courts and poolside patios.
Recently a woman who had injured her back while heaving a
saddle onto a horse gave Dr. Goodman telephone directions to
her estate eight miles away. Following a main artery from the
air, he spotted the patient's red tile roof with a green
tennis court nearby, touched down next to her stables, and
was adjusting her bones within minutes of the call.</p>
<p>To obtain a federal license to operate a helicopter, a
novice must attend 20 to 30 hours of ground school at an
average cost of $50 an hour and log 40 hours of flight time,
20 with an instructor, at a cost between $120 and $180 an
hour. The Federal Aviation Administration must approve all
landing pads to ensure that approach and departure paths
don't interfere with other air traffic routes. In most places
home helipads must also meet specifications imposed by state
aviation authorities.</p>
<p>Local regulation varies greatly. A few communities
prohibit home helicopter operation, and some restrict it to
some degree, but most have no regulation at all. In places
where helicopters have annoyed residents, however, they have
begun to demand regulation or prohibition. Many people think
helicopters make lousy neighbors.</p>
<p>Until last year, several residents of wealthy Rancho Santa
Fe in San Diego County, Calif., choppered themselves to and
from work.</p>
<p>Then, after complaints, the county's board of supervisors
set tough requirements for home heliports around the county
and effectively banned non-emergency helicopter landings in
Rancho Santa Fe.</p>
<p>In Pennsylvania, Mr. Zokaites is running into flak. "The
problem," he says philosophically, "is the social acceptance
of a helicopter as personal transportation."</p>
<p>A home builder, he uses his chopper to get to distant
projects and to obtain aerial perspectives of potential
development sites. But neighbors have complained loudly, and
the town of McCandless has responded. To ground Mr. Zokaites
the town two years ago enacted an ordinance prohibiting
landings within 150 yards of an occupied house.</p>
<p>Ticketed for violating it, and assessed a $300 fine, Mr.
Zokaites successfully challenged the ordinance in court on
the ground that a public-safety measure couldn't legally
govern land use. The town responded last year with a zoning
law aimed at helicopter flights. Mr. Zokaites got two more
$300 tickets and went to court. When the judge, Ralph C.
Freedman Jr., wanted to see the helicopter in operation, Mr.
Zokaites flew it to his house, landed in the backyard and
took the judge for a spin. "He seemed in perfect control and
it seemed pretty safe," Judge Freedman says.</p>
<p>Judge Freedman sided with Mr. Zokaites in a ruling
supporting the argument that his helipad is protected from
the zoning law because it existed before the ordinance. The
neighbors, however, are still complaining, and some have
taken videotapes and still photographs of what they assert is
Mr. Zokaites's reckless flying in an effort to get his
pilot's license revoked.</p>
<p>Helicopter enthusiasts say fears of the craft are
unwarranted. They are safe and really not very noisy, says an
official of the Helicopter Association International, a trade
group in Alexandria, Va., "but it's hard to convince people
of that."</p>
