	<p class="article-leader">CONNIE CHUNG: CBS News said "Face to Face with Connie
Chung," its new prime-time series, would be put on hold
because Ms. Chung wants to try to get pregnant. Instead, Ms.
Chung, who will soon be 44 years old, will appear in periodic
specials. The show will be replaced on Mondays at 10 p.m. by
"The Trials of Rosie O'Neill," a drama starring Sharon Gless
as an attorney. The CBS Inc. unit hopes to air about six
"Face to Face" specials between September and December.</p>
