	<p class="article-leader">Oshkosh Truck Corp. said it had a loss of $2.5 million, or
28 cents a share, in its third quarter ended June 30, after
writing off $27 million, or 33%, of its total inventory.
Sales rose 1.5% to $128.2 million.
   In the year-earlier quarter, Oshkosh earned $4.5 million,
or 50 cents a share, on sales of $126.3 million.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The Oshkosh, Wis., truck maker said much of the inventory,
which was either sold or written off at a cost of $4 million,
was either excess or obsolete and included both finished and
non-finished goods.</p>
<p>Oshkosh said the write-off was necessary to "reduce
inventory carrying costs, gain manufacturing space, and
improve efficiency." The move also lowered the company's
short-term debt to $4.1 million on June 30 from $23.5 million
on March 31.</p>
<p>The company said its outlook is "significantly brightened"
by the fact that the Department of Defense has selected
Oshkosh as the producer of the U.S. Army's new generation of
heavy-duty trucks.</p>
<p>Oshkosh Class B stock rose 12.5 cents yesterday to close
at $10.625 a share in national over-the-counter trading.</p>
