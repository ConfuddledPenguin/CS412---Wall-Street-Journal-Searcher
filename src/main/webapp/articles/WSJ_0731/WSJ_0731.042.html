	<p class="article-leader">Roger B. Smith retires today after leading General Motors
Corp. for nearly a decade -- certainly the period of greatest
change in the company's modern history.
   Mr. Smith completely reorganized GM in 1984, shelled out
billions of dollars to modernize factories and spent billions
more on high-tech and defense acquisitions. He started a
joint venture to build cars with Toyota Motor Corp. and
created Saturn Corp., a separate subsidiary, to develop new
ways of making and selling cars. To his backers, all this
indicates Mr. Smith's vision, and it has made him the most
visible GM chairman since the legendary Alfred P. Sloan Jr.,
who ran the company between 1937 and 1956.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>But Mr. Smith, who became chairman on Jan. 1, 1981, has
also been GM's most controversial chairman ever. He clashed
with dissident director H. Ross Perot and became the subject
of three critical books and a scathing movie.</p>
<p>Mr. Smith's detractors say his vision was no substitute
for focusing on the basics of the car business: building
exciting, high-quality vehicles and making customers happy.
GM lost nearly 10 points of U.S. market share during Mr.
Smith's tenure, mainly because of look-alike cars and poor
quality in the mid-1980s. The share loss saddled GM with so
much extra plant capacity that its huge North American auto
business barely breaks even.</p>
<p>Mr. Smith spent 41 years at GM. His official duties took
him around the world. But he never found the time, he says,
to visit the Tower of London or stroll through the Louvre.
Mr. Smith recently discussed his record with Paul Ingrassia
and Joseph B. White of the Journal's Detroit staff. Here are
excerpts from the interview:</p>
<p>Q: If you gave yourself a letter grade for your
performance as chairman, what would it be?</p>
<p>A: I don't know that there's any single grade. We went
from a $763 million loss {in 1980} to making more money than
anyone in the world except Royal Dutch Shell. That probably
isn't too bad. A lot of the grades have to be incomplete.
What kind of grade do you give Saturn? On mergers and
acquisitions, you've almost got to have an A-plus there, when
you look at $2.5 billion for EDS {Electronic Data Systems
Corp.} that's now worth $10 billion. Preparedness for the
21st century should get a pretty good grade. . . . Overseas
{performance} should get a good grade.</p>
<p>Market share, obviously, we're not happy with that. I had
a guy {who} wrote me a letter the other day. He said, "If you
ask Jack Nicklaus the best round of golf he ever had on the
easiest golf course, and he told you it was 60, but yesterday
he shot an 82 on St. Andrews, would you say he lost 22
strokes off his game?" The market share we had in the late
'70s and 1980s was on a course that was a lot easier to shoot
than the one we're on today.</p>
<p>Q: What's your proudest accomplishment?</p>
<p>A: Getting the corporation ready for the 21st century is
what I feel the best about. I'm convinced the automobile
industry has yet to catch up with Hughes technology. {GM
bought Hughes Aircraft Co. for about $5 billion in 1985.} And
when the auto industry catches up, you'll see us kick in the
afterburners.</p>
<p>Q: What's your biggest disappointment?</p>
<p>A: The thing we didn't do right was the communication on
the restructuring. {The move in 1984 eliminated two huge GM
operations -- Fisher Body and the Assembly Division -- and
reorganized GM's car divisions under two umbrella groups.} We
got a little misled, overconfident, that this thing was going
to go down better than it did.</p>
<p>Q: What, in hindsight, could you have done to avoid the
drop in market share? Why didn't GM act sooner to fix the
look-alike car problem and the quality problems that hurt
market share?</p>
<p>A: To get the look-alike thing {fixed}, you can't come
with paper and paste. You have to come with new models. We
did get locked into basic body designs. If you and I, with
all the resources in the world, said, "Hey, we want a new
body so they don't look alike and have higher quality," it
takes three to five years. And in those days it took even
longer. We had to re-equip our plants. We took the long-term
approach not to go in there with Band-Aids.</p>
<p>Q: Did you suspect from the start that the relationship
with Mr. Perot wouldn't work out? {GM bought EDS in 1984. Mr.
Perot left the company he founded and GM's board in 1986 as
part of a $700 million buy-out.}</p>
<p>A: The board discussed that. One director said in his own
company, with something like 20 acquisitions, he'd only saved
one CEO. We thought we could do it. A lot of people did a lot
of surface reporting {on the Perot controversy}. That stock
was $33; now it's $140 {adjusted for splits}. That's not too
bad.</p>
<p>Q: Early in your tenure, the company focused on
technology. Recently, there's been more emphasis on people.
Does that reflect an evolution in your own thinking?</p>
<p>A: People said you guys made a horrible mistake, you
overshot on technology. That's not a mistake, that's a
deliberate thing. If you keep pulling string out of the box
and stop, you never know how much string is in the box,
right? We've taken technology out of some places that we put
it in. But I would tell you if we hadn't put it in, we'd
never know we should take it out.</p>
<p>Q: What's the strategic importance of Saturn?</p>
<p>A: We wanted to find out if we could build a car of that
size and that quality in this country at a competitive cost
and sell it at a profit. No U.S. manufacturing company has
done that yet. Using our regular designs, our regular
production techniques, you can't do that. So we said: "Have a
go at it on a clean sheet." You've got to see Saturn when
it's running. That plant is so different from our normal
plants.</p>
<p>Q: You've been the subject of books, of a movie, and a lot
of critical news coverage. How did that affect you
personally, and how did you deal with it?</p>
<p>A: Fair criticism I never minded. It's difficult when you
read in a book that you foam at the mouth and throw paper on
the floor. The only time I foam at the mouth is when I brush
my teeth. I've never thrown a paper on the floor in my life.</p>
<p>Q: Do you put the criticism out of your mind?</p>
<p>A: You like to say that you do that. I don't know that
that's true. {What} almost bothers me as much is what I call
surface reporting. If someone had looked just one more little
bit into GM's actions to try and understand the long-range
consequences of what we were doing, then people would have
gotten a better story.</p>
<p>Q: Why did you decide to make higher pensions retroactive
to executives like yourself, who are retiring now, if the
stated goal was to attract and retain management talent?</p>
<p>A: They weren't retroactive. It was over a year ago, last
June or July, that the incentive compensation committee {of
GM's board}, who'd been tracking compensation programs, told
management our pensions were pretty bad. By October 1989, the
board acted to make the change {subject to shareholder
approval}. They made it effective the end of that month.
Seventy-nine percent of companies had better pensions than we
did. Even today, 61% of companies have better pensions.</p>
<p>Q: How do you think you'll be regarded by history?</p>
<p>A: I'm more concerned about what I've been able to do for
the corporation and the stockholders. I was never out to make
my mark in history. I wanted to do it for the company.</p>
<p>Q: What does U.S. industry overall, not just the auto
industry, need to do to become more competitive?</p>
<p>A: Manufacturing technology is really undergoing
tremendous change. . . . The whole approach to design for
manufacturability is undergoing a big revolution. . . .
You've got to take out levels of management. You've got to
get decision-making pushed down in the organization to where
the action is.
</p>
<p>Q: The Japanese got 28% of the car market during the first
half of the year, which was a record. Is it going to go
higher?</p>
<p>A: One thing that's happening is U.S. quality is coming
up. I'm certainly never going to tell you we're going to
drive the Japanese from the shores. Customers get more from
the competition, and in being competitive everybody has to do
better. I like it.</p>
<p>Q: Japanese companies have built eight plants here. Why
don't you go over and build one in Japan?</p>
<p>A: You can't do that. We have a piece of Isuzu and a piece
of Suzuki. But that really is a closed market over there. . .
. When they came out of World War II, they closed that market
up tighter than a drum. It's only in recent days that you see
any opening.</p>
<p>Q: You think the Japanese don't play fair?</p>
<p>A: They've got an enviable position. They're able to get
along in world trade without giving people access to their
home markets.</p>
<p>Q: Their answer is that BMW is doing fine in Japan. {BMW
is the leading import luxury make and sold 33,076 cars in
1989, giving it a market share of 0.8%.}</p>
<p>A: What's doing fine? In a market of that size, I call 38%
doing fine, or 28%.</p>
<p>Q: What are your retirement plans?</p>
<p>A: I don't believe I'm the type of person who can slam on
the brakes and run for the rocking chair. I want to do a lot
of things I owe my wife and family, and then I want to do
some real estate development. I want to do something, be
active, then complete it and then not have to start another
one for two to three months if I don't want to.</p>
<p>Q: What will you do for play?</p>
<p>A: Hunting, fishing, traveling. You'd be surprised, with
all the places I've been, how few things I've really seen
that people go to see. {There are} lots of things in this
country I haven't seen. Lots of great rivers I haven't
fished. . . . I wish I were 20 years younger, in some
respects. There are so many terrific things happening. {But}
it wouldn't be to spend 20 more years as chairman, I'll tell
you that. If I were 20 years younger, I'd want to start down
the ladder.</p>
