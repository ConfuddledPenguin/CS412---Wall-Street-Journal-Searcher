	<p class="article-leader">DETROIT -- The head of General Motors Corp.'s highly
profitable European operations said production constraints
will make it "very difficult" for GM to maintain its current
European sales and market share levels in 1991.
   Factory shutdowns needed to retool for new models probably
will cut GM's European car output next year to below this
year's record levels, GM of Europe president Robert J. Eaton
said in an interview yesterday. Reduced production might
threaten GM of Europe's three-year string of record annual
earnings, but Mr. Eaton said: "I don't expect to go down in
profits."</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>In other comments on the European market, Mr. Eaton said:</p>
<p>-- Japanese auto makers are on track to double or triple
their current 10% share of the 13 million- to 14 million-car
European market by the end of the 1990s. "Europe will be the
battleground of the 1990s," he said. The six major auto
makers that now dominate Europe, including GM and Ford Motor
Co., all risk losing share to the Japanese, he said.</p>
<p>-- GM expects European car sales will continue to expand,
with growth in the East outpacing growth in the West. By the
end of the decade, he said, Eastern Europeans and Soviets
could buy as many as five million vehicles a year, up from
1.8 million vehicles a year currently. However, "there's a
lot of uncertainty" in that outlook in light of Eastern
Europe's massive economic and political problems, Mr. Eaton
cautioned.</p>
<p>GM's European vehicle sales are less than a third of those
in the U.S. But Europe's importance to the No. 1 auto maker
far outweighs its sales volume. GM earned $1.83 billion in
Europe last year -- more than it earned in the U.S. and
Canada combined. And in sharp contrast to the U.S., where GM
has more plants than it needs, GM's European operations are
running flat out. GM's European market share is now dictated
by its capacity, Mr. Eaton said.</p>
<p>Through the first six months of this year, GM sold 824,600
cars in Europe to take 11.3% of the market. That's up from
791,780 cars and a 10.9% share a year earlier. But output in
1991 almost certainly will drop from this year's record
levels, taking sales and market share along with it, Mr.
Eaton conceded.</p>
<p>"We've been struggling to find out how to maintain
{production} next year" during the scheduled model changes,
Mr. Eaton said. "That's going to be very difficult. We'll
probably lose production."</p>
<p>GM is launching a campaign to boost its European capacity
by 25% to two million cars a year. Some of that will be
accomplished by adding third shifts at existing GM assembly
plants, and possibly reopening a closed facility in Belgium.
But some of the bottlenecks in assembly and parts-making
operations won't be fixed by next year.</p>
<p>GM is looking to new joint ventures in Hungary and
Czechoslovakia to boost output of engines and transmissions.
But those operations aren't scheduled to begin production
until 1992.</p>
<p>Early next year, GM plans to begin production of its new
Calibra coupes at a plant in Finland owned by Saab Automobile
AB, the 50-50 joint venture between GM and Saab-Scania AB of
Sweden. GM also plans to begin limited production this fall
at plants in Turkey and East Germany. But these efforts
combined will add only about 45,000 cars to GM's European
capacity in 1991, company officials say.</p>
<p>Despite product shortages, GM will continue to move into
the Eastern European market, Mr. Eaton said. GM's 340 newly
recruited East German dealers have taken orders for some
6,000 cars since the two Germanys merged currencies last
month, Mr. Eaton said. GM could sell as many as 25,000 cars
in East Germany this year, he added.</p>
<p>But Mr. Eaton said that sales pace could cool down as East
Germans deplete their savings. And other Eastern European
markets are handicapped by the lack of hard currency.</p>
<p>"Our moves into the East bloc are not based on the belief
that it will convert to a Western economy overnight," Mr.
Eaton said. Indeed, he said, GM is structuring its operations
so they can "operate forever without hard currency
convertibility."</p>
