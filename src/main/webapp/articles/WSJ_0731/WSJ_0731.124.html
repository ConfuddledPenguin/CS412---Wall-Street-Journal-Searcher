	<p class="article-leader">Giant Group Ltd., Beverly Hills, Calif., said its board
authorized the purchase of common stock in Rally's Inc., a
hamburger chain in which Giant is the leader of a group that
holds about a 44% stake.
   Giant Group didn't say how much stock it might acquire in
public or private transactions, and cautioned that its
prospective purchases depended on the price of Rally's stock,
interest rates, market conditions and other factors.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Rally's stock appeared little-affected by Giant's cautious
announcement, closing unchanged at $16 a share in national
over-the-counter trading.</p>
<p>Giant, a cement, waste processing and fast-food concern
controlled by Beverly Hills financier Burt Sugarman, said in
a Securities and Exchange Commission filing last October that
it had sought approval under federal antitrust laws to
acquire more than a 50% stake in Rally's, based in
Louisville, Ky.</p>
<p>In Louisville, Richard Sherman, chairman and chief
executive officer of Rally's, welcomed Giant's prospective
purchases. "They've been an excellent shareholder," he said.</p>
<p>Rally's currently has about 6.8 million shares
outstanding.</p>
