	<p class="article-leader">The Journal certainly jumped on the soccer-bashing
bandwagon in David Brooks's "World Cup: Hooligans and Mad
Cows" (Leisure & Arts, June 19).
   No, I'm not an English hooligan or a West German partial
to funny hats. Born in the U.S., I began playing soccer at
age 12 and haven't stopped. I still play on an over-30 team.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>I think the Journal, and the American media in general,
misses an important point when it comes to soccer. Just as
golf has evolved as a prized means of doing business in
corporate America, a knowledge and understanding of and
affinity for soccer among American business people could be
critical to our economic well-being in the emerging global
economy.</p>
<p>If that sounds like balderdash, consider some of the
asinine reasons the media give for soccer's flagging success
in America: low-scoring, no hand-eye coordination required,
hooligans, mad cows. Enough already.</p>
<p>The whole world plays the game. America is part of the
world, even though some closet jingoists continue to deny the
fact.</p>
<p>It's time to get off our myopic high horse. We may not
know much about soccer, but then again, ask some Italian,
German or Cameroonian who won last year's Super Bowl.</p>
