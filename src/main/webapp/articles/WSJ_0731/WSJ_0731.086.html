	<p class="article-leader">Tokyo stocks retreated for the seventh consecutive trading
day, as the continuing rise of interest rates on the bond
market dried up buying interest.
   In London, share prices finished a somber session softer,
as soggy performances on overseas markets inspired little
fresh confidence in equities.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Tokyo's Nikkei Index of 225 issues fell 420.53 points to
30442.95, posting a total of a 2612.67-point, or 7.9%, loss
since July 20.</p>
<p>In early trading in Tokyo Tuesday, the Nikkei index
rebounded 277.19 points to 30720.14.</p>
<p>Monday's volume on the first section was sparse --
estimated at 250 million shares, down from 437 million
Friday. Losers widely outnumbered gainers 790 to 168, while
151 issues were unchanged.</p>
<p>The Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed in the
first section was down 23.97 points, or 1.07%, to 2225.29.</p>
<p>The second section index fell 14.10 points, or 0.32%, to
4349. Volume in the section was estimated at 12.2 million
shares, down from 25 million shares Friday.</p>
<p>In response to higher interest rates on the bond market,
stock prices retreated soon after the opening.</p>
<p>In addition to rounds of selling by arbitragers, selling
by investors who were too discouraged to hold on to their
shares pressured down the Nikkei Index as low as 30296 points
midafternoon, as the benchmark 10-year government bond prices
hit a seven-year low.</p>
<p>The No. 119, 10-year bond fell 0.26 yen to 85.00 yen, with
the yield rising 0.060 percentage point to 7.630%.</p>
<p>The Bank of Japan's fund-adding money market operation
late morning prompted a slight rebound on the bond market.
But the move didn't help cool off growing speculation that
the central bank may again raise the official discount rate,
observers said.</p>
<p>Buying linked to new sets of investment trust funds helped
push up stocks from midday lows. Traders said, however,
investment trust funds were also active sellers, mirroring an
increasing number of investors who unwound their trust fund
accounts because of the recent sluggishness of the stock
market.</p>
<p>The short-term money market, which is offering higher than
7.5% fixed interest, is absorbing much short-term money, said
a trader at James Capel Pacific.</p>
<p>As reflected by the extremely low volume, most investors
remained on the sidelines, he said, noting that most
investors with a midterm or long-term stance aren't willing
to sell stocks at current low levels.</p>
<p>"But they also don't want to run a risk of buying when
interest rates may go up higher," the trader said.</p>
<p>The market is losing support by individual investors,
whose active buying of small-capital stocks have been leaving
breathing space for the market while most shares were falling
over the past week.</p>
<p>Individuals' funds are stuck with stocks they bought when
prices were rising, said Tetsuji Hamasaki, general manager of
investment information at W.I. Carr Sons & Co.</p>
<p>For example, he said, stocks such as Ajinomoto, which
jumped on reports of new products, stopped their surges. So
did speculative shares such as Jujo Paper & Pulp, following
the arrest of a speculator group's leader this month, he
said.</p>
<p>Also, trading on the second section and the
over-the-counter market calmed perceptions that their prices
have become too expensive, Mr. Hamasaki said.</p>
<p>Individuals are unable to buy as they can't take profits
from any shares, he said. As a result, turnover slows, he
said.</p>
<p>Mr. Hamasaki predicted that selling pressure will
increase, reflecting approaching margin calls for a large
volume of stocks.</p>
<p>The balance of margin buying rose 1.5 trillion yen ($10.07
billion) from late February to mid-March following eased
restrictions on margin buying from Feb. 27, he said.</p>
<p>Selling linked to margin calls will pressure stock prices,
he said, because the market likely won't be able to absorb
such selling with overall volume expected to remain thin
reflecting the high interest rates.</p>
<p>Financial sectors were sold off, discouraged by
continually rising interest rates, traders said.</p>
<p>Mitsubishi Bank fell 60 yen to 2010 yen, while Mitsui &
Taiyo Kobe Bank dropped 90 yen to 1930 yen.</p>
<p>Construction and mining shares also declined, with
Ohbayashi down 20 yen to 1520 yen, and Nippon Mining easing
28 yen to 875 yen.</p>
<p>Electronics shares also fell, with Sharp retreating 30 yen
to 1710 yen, while Sony dropped 120 yen to 8610 yen.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, with persistent weakness in Tokyo overnight and
following on the heels of a depressed showing late last week
on Wall Street, dealers said London shares had little choice
but to head lower.</p>
<p>However, many market watchers said they hadn't noticed any
heavy selling pressure but rather a drift down amid little
turnover.</p>
<p>The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100 Share Index fell
13.6 points to 2316.5, while the Financial Times 30 Share
Index was down 4 points at 1838.1. Volume was 341.7 million
shares compared with 344.7 million issues Friday.</p>
<p>STC said first-half pretax profit fell 32% to #77.7
million ($142.9 million), adding that full-year profit is
likely to be below 1989's result. The electronics maker also
said it will sell 80% of its ICL computer subsidiary to
Fujitsu Ltd. for #700 million, a tag that dealers put at the
bottom of market expectations. STC skidded 21 pence to 267
pence on turnover of 11 million shares.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, Pearson shed 22 pence to 720 pence. The
publishing group was hit by bearish weekend press reports
that new orders for British Satellite Broadcasting, in which
Pearson has a significant stake, will be well below expected
levels.</p>
<p>Maxwell Communications Corp. fell 9.5 pence to 174.5
pence. Robert Maxwell said that he may back a possible bid
for PowerGen, which is soon to be privatized, by the Union of
Democratic Mineworkers.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, stocks ended lower in Paris, Frankfurt, Zurich,
Brussels, Amsterdam, Stockholm, Madrid and Milan. South
African gold stocks closed lower.</p>
<p>Shares also closed lower in Sydney, Hong Kong, Seoul,
Singapore and Wellington, and higher in Taipei and Manila.</p>
