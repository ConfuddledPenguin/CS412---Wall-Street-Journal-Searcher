	<p class="article-leader">To your average Congressperson, a vote to choke off shoe,
textile and clothing imports seems like a nice opportunity to
make everybody happy. Members can stand up to crafty
foreigners and collect brownie points -- and maybe a little
PAC money -- from trade unions and the textile lobby. Then
the President will veto the bill and the world trading system
can chug on unharmed.
   That's what happened with the 1985 and 1988 textile bills.
But the 1990 bill, which passed the Senate last week and
probably will come before the House this week, is not just
innocent grandstanding. The real aim of its backers is to
wreck the current Uruguay round of free-trade talks.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Important Republicans -- Senate leader Bob Dole for one --
are joining the protectionist camp. And other Senators,
ranging from Jesse Helms to Pat Moynihan, are quite willing
to forsake their usual principles to add their votes and
voices.</p>
<p>Even without the 1990 textile bill, the textile industry
is by far the most protected in the country. Under the terms
of the Multifiber Agreement, the U.S. has signed 38 bilateral
"agreements" imposing quotas on the textile and clothing
exports of Japan and 37 other countries. (European countries
and the U.S. refrain from imposing such restrictions on each
other under what trade lawyers call "the white man's rule.")</p>
<p>Those imports that the U.S. does accept are then smacked
with tariffs of nearly 20%, four times the average U.S. rate.
The Federal Trade Commission calculates that the restrictions
cost the American consumer an extra 58% on every towel,
shirt, dress and pair of underwear, which adds up to a total
yearly bill between $7.5 billion and $11.5 billion (in 1984
dollars).</p>
<p>That's not enough for the textile lobby. The bill the
Senate enacted last week rips up those 38 quota agreements
and imposes a single import quota on the whole world -- a
quota that is permitted to grow by no more than 1% per year.
In effect, the U.S. textile and clothing industries are
guaranteed their present market share of about 65% forever.</p>
<p>Whatever the average Senator thought he was doing, the
principal backers of this legislation were signaling the
administration: Don't bother bringing home a treaty from
Uruguay if it includes free trade in textiles. And they were
signaling the rest of the world: Don't bother making
concessions to U.S. trade negotiators on intellectual
property, high technology and agriculture in exchange for
U.S. concessions on textiles, because the administration's
promises won't be honored by the Senate.</p>
<p>President Bush, who bravely defended free trade in the
1988 primary in textile-producing South Carolina, is almost
certain to veto the bill, and his veto probably will be
sustained. But the message would be sent nonetheless. Both
the administration and foreigners will notice that the number
of free-trade Senators is steadily eroding: 39 voted against
the 1985 textile bill, 36 against the 1988 bill and just 32
against this year's version.</p>
<p>This is a shameful situation, and no two Senators should
be more ashamed of it, or their part in it, than the
arch-conservative Mr. Helms and the arch-liberal Mr.
Moynihan. Plenty of other Senators agree that Americans
should be forced to pay half again as much for their socks as
they need to, but no two other Senators have had to stray
quite so far from their principles.</p>
<p>It's certainly strange to see Mr. Helms -- who opposes
quotas so fiercely when they are enacted in, say, a
civil-rights bill -- lobby for them so passionately in a
trade bill. In other contexts, Mr. Helms is one of the
Senate's staunchest advocates of competition and
self-reliance. Yet for the textile industry of North Carolina
he demands that competitors be excluded from the market and
that the 30 years of special government favors to the
industry be continued indefinitely.</p>
<p>It's even stranger to see Mr. Moynihan, supposedly a
friend of the poor, voting for more textile protectionism,
which hits the poor hardest. He's even more outspoken about
his commitment to the international rule of law, but his vote
for the textile bill was a vote to tear up 38 U.S. government
foreign agreements without so much as an "excuse me." Mr.
Moynihan finds an affront to international law in unilateral
American action to liberate small Caribbean countries; but
unilateral American action to devastate the economies of
countries like Bangladesh, Sri Lanka and Thailand apparently
is perfectly OK.</p>
<p>Uruguay offers the hope that international trade can move
toward greater competitiveness and legality. That's an
aspiration that both Sen. Moynihan and Sen. Helms, who claim
to be politicians of conviction, say they support. They --
and their colleagues -- should cease sabotaging it.</p>
