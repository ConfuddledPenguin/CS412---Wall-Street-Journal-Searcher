	<p class="article-leader">CHICAGO -- The Securities and Exchange Commission is
investigating financially troubled Stotler Group Inc. for
possible violations of disclosure rules governing publicly
held companies, according to individuals familiar with the
investigation.
   Futures industry regulators, meantime, have questioned the
propriety of intercompany loans totaling $5.5 million made to
Stotler Group late last year by two pools of customer funds
raised by Stotler Funds Inc., a unit of Stotler Group. The
loans appear to raise serious conflict of interest issues for
Stotler Group and may represent a breach of the company's
fiduciary duty to investors in the pools, futures industry
officials said.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The heightened regulatory scrutiny follows the collapse
over the past few weeks of Stotler Group's major subsidiary,
Stotler & Co., which has been forced to withdraw from the
futures business for lack of capital. The unit's collapse has
pushed the publicly held parent company to the brink of
insolvency.</p>
<p>SEC officials as a matter of policy don't comment on
whether they are investigating companies for such possible
violations, said Mary Weiss, an investigator in the SEC's
Chicago office.</p>
<p>The first hint of trouble at Stotler surfaced publicly
July 12, when the company asked the American Stock Exchange
not to open trading in its stock because it had "news
pending." Since that time, futures industry officials
privately have criticized Stotler officials for not being
more forthcoming about the company's problems. The company's
only public announcements about its cash crunch have been a
handful of brief statements released to the press, the first
dated July 15.</p>
<p>The company's three outside directors resigned last week,
saying they hadn't been kept informed of the decisions
Stotler was making to cope with their cash crisis, according
to one of the directors.</p>
<p>Stotler officials also have consistently refused to return
reporters' calls for comment on events affecting the company.</p>
<p>Stotler Group's stock last traded on July 24 at $2.50,
down from $7.875 before it was halted.</p>
<p>Futures regulators have been questioning Stotler Group's
loans from funds for over two months. The National Futures
Association said in a May 7 letter to Stotler Funds President
Thomas Kolter that two intercompany loans, in the form of a
$1 million demand note from Advanced Portfolio Management and
$4.55 million of Stotler Group commercial paper purchased by
Compass Futures Fund Inc., "may be in violation of the pools'
respective disclosure documents." The Compass fund's
disclosure document "specifically disallows such lending,"
the NFA added.</p>
<p>Mr. Kolter responded in a letter a few days later that
pool investors had been informed of the loans, and that they
were made to boost the funds' yield on their investments.</p>
<p>Individuals close to Stotler said Mr. Kolter has written
Stotler Group in recent days demanding that the $5.5 million
be returned to the two pools.</p>
<p>Neither Mr. Kolter nor attorneys acting on behalf of
Stotler Funds Inc. returned calls seeking comment.</p>
<p>Stotler & Co.'s troubles began earlier this month when
futures industry regulators, disallowing questionable
intercompany funds transfers between Stotler & Co. and the
parent, ruled that the unit didn't meet minimum capital
requirements.</p>
<p>After failing to secure an emergency $10 million cash
infusion, Stotler Group last week said it defaulted on
$750,000 in commercial paper payments. The company said it
may have to restructure or sell assets to meet $7.6 million
in debt payments due within 30 days.</p>
