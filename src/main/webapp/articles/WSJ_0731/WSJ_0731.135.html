	<p class="article-leader">Displays Let Shoppers
   Get a Handle on Products</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>MANUFACTURERS offer consumers more chances to "test drive"
tools, toys and other products before they buy.
Do-it-yourself displays increase sales and don't require
staff to guide customers.</p>
<p>"When shoppers get involved in the product, sales go up
15% to 20%," says John Kawula, president of the Point of
Purchase Advertising Institute in Englewood, N.J. Others put
the gain higher.</p>
<p>Frank Mayer & Associates, Grafton, Wis., designed a
demonstrator for Nintendo's "Game Boy" video game. The
display is authentic except that it limits play to between
three and seven minutes and uses stereo speakers instead of
earphones. John Sakaley, Nintendo's director of
merchandising, says interactive displays double sales
compared with passive counter diagrams.</p>
<p>WorkTools of Chatsworth, Calif., has designed its own
display, which lets consumers try its "SqueezeDriver"
screwdriver on a permanently attached screw.</p>
<p>Tomy America, Southport, Conn., expects to sell 200,000 of
its "Big Loader" cargo-handling toys this year instead of the
50,000 anticipated before it got Thomas A. Schutz Co. of
Morton Grove, Ill., to design a demonstrator that works under
a plastic dome.</p>
<p>Some interactive displays are meant to provide less
customer interaction rather than more. Aris Isotoner found
that shoppers didn't buy the company's claim that one size of
Isotoner glove fits all; they insisted on ripping open the
boxes and trying on the gloves, spoiling the packages.</p>
<p>So Thomson-Leeds, a New York design firm, put a single
glove on a pulley. Shoppers can pull the glove down and try
it on. Fred Richman, Isotoner's manager of visual
merchandising, didn't give figures, but said, "I assume we
saved money."</p>
<p>Preparing Offices</p>
<p>To Shake, Rattle and Roll</p>
<p>FURNITURE PEOPLE have learned some lessons from last
year's San Francisco earthquake. Lesson One: Good office
planning is pretty much the same in a quake zone or out.</p>
<p>Tall file cabinets should be anchored to the floor,
ceiling, wall or each other to keep them from falling over,
as many did when drawers sprang open in the quake. Furniture
makers and interior designers add that file cabinets are
tippy by nature and should always be anchored, whether in
California or Kansas.</p>
<p>Another lesson from San Francisco is that computer
monitors should be fastened down to prevent them from
marching off the desk and onto the floor. Robert Hayes,
corporate architect for Apple Computer's U.S. division, says
some people in the Bay Area have started using velcro strips
to secure their monitors. But many computer users throughout
the country have long used locks to prevent thievery; these
also serve to prevent earthquake damage.</p>
<p>A third lesson: Don't ask how to design furniture for the
next quake. "We don't know," says Richard Driscoll, senior
test lab engineer at Steelcase, a furniture maker. How
furniture does in a quake depends on the kind of quake and
type of building. "Every quake is different," Mr. Driscoll
says, "and every building responds differently."</p>
<p>A Feast for the Ears,</p>
<p>If Not the Eyes</p>
<p>SO LONG AS you're willing to look like Mickey Mouse or
Dumbo, you can hear better -- at home, at a concert or in the
woods.</p>
<p>Two Californians have designed non-electronic hearing
devices to mimic the effect of cupping a hand behind one's
ear.</p>
<p>"Ear Lenzes" are made of black plastic and resemble
headphones, except that the earpieces are parabolic
half-shells. Inventor Michael Riley, president of National
Market Makers of Venice, Calif., says his device delivers up
to eight decibels more sound to the ears. That isn't enough
to help most hard-of-hearing people, Mr. Riley says, but does
let home stereo listeners get the same sound with half the
power.</p>
<p>Ear Lenzes also block out sound from side and rear.
"Useful in a concert hall," says George Petersen, products
editor of Mix Magazine, a sound industry journal. And useful
in the woods, says Mr. Riley, where Ear Lenzes can help
hunters hear their prey and ornithologists pick up bird
calls.</p>
<p>"Serious Listeners" is a similar product, but with larger
earpieces made of soft calfskin. Leather treats sound more
naturally than plastic, says co-inventor Terry Merritt of
Burlingame, Calif. Sam Tellig, senior editor at Stereophile
magazine, says his Serious Listeners made singer Jessye
Norman seem "much closer and more immediate" in a recent
concert at Carnegie Hall.</p>
<p>Neither device wins a beauty contest. Jeffrey Goggin,
editor of Sounds Like . . . magazine, which reviews audio
products, says he could "never wear" Ear Lenzes in public,
because they make him look like "a charter member of the
Mickey Mouse Club."</p>
