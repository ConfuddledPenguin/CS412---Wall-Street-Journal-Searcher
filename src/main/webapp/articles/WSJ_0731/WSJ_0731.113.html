	<p class="article-leader">ZURICH, Switzerland -- Legislation outlawing money
laundering will go into effect in Switzerland tomorrow, and
offenders can face penalties of as much as five years in
prison and one million Swiss francs ($734,200).
   Switzerland, one of the world's major financial centers,
has been vulnerable to misuse by organized crime attracted by
the country's bank secrecy laws. But after a billion-dollar
money-laundering scandal involving drug money in 1988 -- the
so-called Lebanon Connection -- the government pushed for the
legislation aimed at stemming the flow of such money into the
nation.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The new law covers all professionals, from bankers and
portfolio managers to accountants and lawyers, who handle
money for others.</p>
<p>An addition to the penal code also takes effect tomorrow,
obliging those who accept, look after, invest or transfer
funds for others to know the identity of the funds' owner.
Offenders can be punished by prison terms as long as one
year. Until now, the need to identify customers fully has
been part of a gentleman's agreement among banks to assure
that funds they accepted weren't derived from criminal
activities. But this had no firm basis in law.</p>
<p>The Swiss Banking Commission said the legislation casts
doubt on the practices of lawyers representing clients whose
names aren't disclosed to banks. Until now, lawyers had only
to sign a statement declaring that they were acting in their
professional capacity and not as investment fronts, and that
the funds weren't obtained illegally.</p>
