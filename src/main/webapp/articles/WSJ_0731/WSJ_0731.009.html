	<p class="article-leader">SAN FRANCISCO -- The inflation hawk of the Federal Reserve
has spotted something that might change his flight path
though not his target. Monetarist that Lee Hoskins is, it's
no surprise that while some wail about a squeeze by lenders,
the president of the Cleveland Fed bank has his eye on the
money supply.
   "Credit's available, it seems to me. But having said that,
I have some concerns currently about the rate of growth in
M2," he says, referring to the aggregate of currency,
checking accounts and most saving accounts. "A large part of
the M2 slowdown in the last quarter is unexplained."</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>With all their predictive problems, you might have thought
(or hoped) that the monetary aggregates like M2, watched so
closely by financial markets in the early '80s, had been sent
to a statistical morgue. But Mr. Hoskins's camp especially is
still counting on them to provide a policy-making clue. And
right now M2 is giving the banking system's hardest liner a
start.</p>
<p>As one of 12 voting members of the Federal Open-Market
Committee that sets direction for the central bank, Mr.
Hoskins dissented -- as he frequently does -- earlier this
year in favor of lower M2 targets. He thought staying aimed
at M2 growth of 3% to 7% would be inflationary. But
subsequent money-supply totals ("almost no growth at all in
the second quarter") have relaxed him on the upside and
perplexed him on the downside. About 4% annually ("right now
we're still on that path") would be a sound footing, "but I
don't want to come in two percentage points below that. That
could provide a monetary shock for the economy."</p>
<p>Monetary shocks are the last thing this 49-year-old
economist wants. His mantra is long-run price stability,
which is to say zero inflation within five years. He believes
monetary policy, unless steady, distorts markets. That view
is associated, of course, with Milton Friedman, though Mr.
Hoskins was most directly influenced at the UCLA Economics
Department by Armen Alchian and his work on the centrality of
property rights.</p>
<p>The Cleveland Fed presidency, which Mr. Hoskins assumed in
1987, lets him roam widely in pursuit of his larger
interests. He was in San Francisco last week to attend a
conference on Pacific Rim economies. His dissents
notwithstanding, he is representative of the sort of
non-lending professionals who head most of the 12 regional
Fed banks. All dozen of them participate with the seven
Federal Reserve Board governors in deliberating broad U.S.
monetary policy, with five of the regional chiefs actually
holding votes at any one time. The 12 presidents, typically
economists or lawyers, are a virtually invisible yet potent
element in shaping national economic policy (often toward
tighter money). Yet not only aren't they chosen by the
people, they aren't even appointed by elected officials as
the Fed governors are. The district banks' quasipublic boards
pick them.</p>
<p>That may be one reason for another of Mr. Hoskins's lonely
crusades. "It's important to have accountability independent
of the political process, to be open," he says of the Fed
policy body. So he wants to have its actions made public
immediately, rather than weeks later as currently. A
congressional move in that direction died last year when
central bankers complained it would inhibit their ability to
right wayward markets. Diminishing that sway is basically
fine with Mr. Hoskins, an opponent of "monetary fine-tuning."
He argues that his institution can control only one type of
economic shock: the price instability it engenders.</p>
<p>In that spirit he supports a second effort in Congress, by
Rep. Stephen Neal (D., N.C.), to establish zero inflation as
the objective of the Fed and to set a five-year timetable for
achieving it. Mr. Hoskins admits this is symbolism, but
maintains it effectively would quiet noise from other
directives, such as the Humphrey-Hawkins Act of 1978, that
beg full employment. On this issue, fellow central bankers
are allied, but most politicians balk.</p>
<p>The markets remain dubious of the Fed's credibility,
judging by recent discounting of the key 30-year "long bond."
Nevertheless, Mr. Hoskins says, the momentum for price
stability is gathering. Economists debate whether zero
inflation really is desirable, given that a standard such as
the Consumer Price Index is so skewed that reducing it flat
would leave much of the economy shrinking in recession in
order to compensate for areas of stubborn price rises. Mr.
Hoskins says he's not wedded to a particular measure, but
doubts that a stable-price equilibrium would deter growth.</p>
<p>Moreover, short-run economic results aren't in his scope.
Contrary to Fed chairman Alan Greenspan, he doesn't seek to
use monetary policy to sustain the present expansion, but
neither does he believe anti-inflation considerations place
any bounds on economic growth rates. He preaches humility
about our ability to manage or predict the economy. Of a
potential tradeoff of looser money for negotiated reduction
of the federal deficit, Mr. Hoskins remarks, "I don't think I
would view a fiscal policy change as being significant enough
to want to alter monetary policy, because we don't know a lot
about the effects of those fiscal policy changes."</p>
<p>Back in Cleveland, Mr. Hoskins says, he's heard little
about borrowing problems. He monitors economic data for his
industrial-belt district but isn't sure there's much to do
with it given the Fed's clumsy relationship with the real
economy. He saw the effects of hard times as economist for
the old Pittsburgh National Bank in the early 1980s, but of
today's "credit crunch" simply offers that banks "have
applied standards more rigorously and probably rightly so. I
don't think that there's much that monetary policy could or
should do about that."</p>
<p>He is, however, suspicious of the way the Fed sought in
the first half of 1990 to rein in excess money it created a
year ago. Instead of pegging the money supply, his colleagues
stuck to a high "federal funds," or interbank interest, rate.
"We think there's a relationship between the amount of
reserves we're supplying and a particular interest rate. When
that has not held true, we adjust the reserve pattern rather
than the interest rate . . . If you put that rate too high,
then you're going to have to keep shrinking the amount of
reserves out there, or putting them in at a slower pace. The
aggregates will slow . . . One concern of mine about M2 is
exactly that."</p>
