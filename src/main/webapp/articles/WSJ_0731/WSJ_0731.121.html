	<p class="article-leader">Hitachi Ltd. said it has come up with a magnetic disk
storage subsystem, for use in large-scale, general-purpose
processors, which allows for what it claims is the world's
largest computer memory storage.
   The Japanese computer and electronics company said the new
product, H-6587 series, can store up to 35 gigabytes of data
-- the equivalent of more than 70 years of a typical Japanese
language newspaper -- or 2.3 times more than Hitachi's
preceding model.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Hitachi enhanced head-disk assembly technology, in an
attempt to ensure large storage in drastically less space. As
a result, on a per-gigabyte basis, a configuration using the
new systems requires only one-third the space of existing
systems, officials said.</p>
<p>Hitachi officials call the latest development the
completion of Hitachi's computer devices aimed to cope with
market demand for highly sophisticated information systems.</p>
<p>The company will start marketing the new product Aug. 1.</p>
