	<p class="article-leader">THE S&L BAILOUT will require $100 billion over the next 12
months, Bush officials disclosed. The new plan leaves the
bailout's overall cost projections unchanged, but requires
more cash sooner than previously forecast. Even Republicans
balked at the figure, which includes $60 billion in
"temporary" spending intended to be recouped through thrift
asset sales. The administration said junk-bond losses and the
real-estate slump are adding to the bailout's toll.
