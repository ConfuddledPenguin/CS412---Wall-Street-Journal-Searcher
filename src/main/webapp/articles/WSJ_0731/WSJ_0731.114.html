	<p class="article-leader">Canadian Pacific Forest Products Ltd., citing soft demand,
said it plans to shut its pulp mill in Gold River, British
Columbia, for a month beginning Aug. 4.
   The 80%-owned subsidiary of Canadian Pacific Ltd. said the
mill has annual capacity of 240,000 metric tons of bleached
kraft softwood pulp. Wood pulp is used to make paper and
other products. A metric ton equals about 2,204.6 pounds.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The Canadian pulp industry has been plagued this year by
weak demand. The Canadian Pulp and Paper Association said
Canadian pulp mills operated at about 80% of capacity in
June, down from 96% a year earlier.</p>
