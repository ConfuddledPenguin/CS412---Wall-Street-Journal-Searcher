	<p class="article-leader">GREENWICH, Conn. -- Under pressure from labor and
competitors, United Parcel Service of America Inc. has
negotiated a Teamsters contract that could set a pattern for
major freight trucking companies in the spring.
   It's not only the terms of the contract that shippers and
labor economists are tracking, but also Teamster tactics at
the union's largest employer. "This will set a precedent for
a lot of labor contracts," this year and next, said Paul
Schlesinger, an analyst at Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette
Securities Corp.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>So far, ambivalent national Teamsters leaders have
negotiated a contract to replace the one expiring at midnight
tonight EDT -- but now are advising their 140,000 members at
UPS to reject it in balloting extended until Aug. 10.</p>
<p>Trucking executives, UPS competitors and analysts believe
the vote is too close to call, but they expect both sides to
continue to negotiate if Teamsters reject the UPS contract. A
strike is considered unlikely. "A strike would hurt UPS and
the Teamsters, because UPS could permanently lose substantial
market share in both the air and ground package services to
nonunion competitors," said George Robertson, an analyst at
Alex. Brown & Sons in Baltimore.</p>
<p>UPS, the nation's largest deliverer of packages, already
pays its full-time truck drivers about $16.10 an hour, making
them the highest-paid unionized workers in the trucking
business. The company proposed a wage increase of 50 cents an
hour, or about 3%, each year of the three-year contract. UPS
also offered a one-time signing bonus of $1,000 for full-time
workers and $500 for part-timers and a cost-of-living
increase for all unionized workers, capped at 20 cents an
hour, in the second and third years of the contract.</p>
<p>The contract includes a boost in the company's annual
health, welfare and pension contributions to $10,500, from
$8,300 currently, for each full-time employee by the third
year of the contract.</p>
<p>Having negotiated all this, Teamster leaders then decided
they don't like the size of the wage increase, a UPS plan to
use additional part-time workers and the company's strict
adherence to demanding production quotas. What's more, a
power struggle within the Teamsters has complicated
negotiations. Meanwhile, UPS is trying harder than ever to
hold down costs and gain labor flexibility as it battles
effective, nonunion competitors on the ground and in the air.</p>
<p>"These may be the toughest circumstances surrounding a UPS
contract in the past decade," said Mr. Schlesinger.</p>
<p>The outcome will reverberate through the ranks of
Consolidated Freightways Inc., Roadway Services Inc. and
other less-than-truckload carriers faced with expiration of
their Teamsters contract March 30, 1991. What happens to UPS
"will provide some indication of what we can expect later
this year," when freight carriers begin to negotiate a new
three-year contract, said James R. Allen, a vice president of
Palo Alto, Calif.-based Consolidated Freightways.</p>
<p>Less-than-truckload carriers, which carry the freight of
several shippers in one trailer, could gain business if the
Teamsters strike UPS. "Some of their freight would flow to
us," said Kenneth Mayhew, president and chief executive
officer of Carolina Freight Corp., Cherryville, N.C.</p>
<p>But such carriers, facing overcapacity, stiff competition
and marginal profits, can't be as generous when they bargain
with their 200,000 Teamster workers. UPS is a "rich employer,
whereas we're part of a poor industry," said Mr. Allen.</p>
<p>Last year UPS reported net income of $693.4 million on
revenue of $12.4 billion. But the company's profit margin
declined to 5.6% from 8.1% in 1987, reflecting the costs of
both meeting increased competition for packages in the U.S.
and expanding into air delivery at home and abroad.</p>
<p>Kent C. Nelson, UPS chairman and chief executive officer,
said the company wants to use additional part-time workers,
earning about 60% of full-time hourly wage rates, to better
compete with nonunion Federal Express Corp. He added that
with more part-timers the company could afford to deliver
overnight air packages earlier in the day and on Saturdays.</p>
<p>Also influencing the vote on the contract are worker
attitudes about the rigid production standards to which UPS
holds its drivers and package sorters. UPS "zeroes in on the
least-best employees and harangues them until they meet the
standards," said Walter Mitchell, president of package
deliverer ZoneSkip Inc. and a former UPS national marketing
manager who is writing a book about his ex-employer. UPS has
become very successful managing labor "with the whip and a
chair," said Mr. Mitchell.</p>
<p>UPS is trying to court union labor with changes in style,
including rewards for workers who exceed the standards and
more comfortable, contemporary uniforms. Next month the
company will test Bermuda shorts for some West Coast drivers.</p>
<p>Mr. Nelson said the company is trying to "manage all of
the people in a more positive way" while preserving its
vaunted efficiency based on close scrutiny of its workers.
"We pay them more and they produce more," said Mr. Nelson,
adding that any relaxation of UPS's emphasis on production
would be the "death knell for this company."</p>
