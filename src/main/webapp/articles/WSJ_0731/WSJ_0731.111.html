	<p class="article-leader">MENLO PARK, Calif. -- Consolidated Freightways Inc., a
transportation concern whose earnings have been going
downhill fast since an acquisition last year, said its board
"accepted the resignation" of Lary R. Scott, president and
chief executive officer.
   Consolidated said Chairman Raymond F. O'Brien, 68 years
old, would assume the additional post of chief executive and
J. Frank Leach would succeed Mr. Scott as president. Mr.
Leach, 69, has been a Consolidated director for 16 years.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Consolidated has been hurt as a result of its April 1989
acquisition of Emery Air Freight Corp. for $230 million and
the assumption of $240 million in debt. Emery previously had
losses for three consecutive years because of stiffening
international air-freight competition. Mr. Scott considered
the purchase as central for Consolidated to compete in the
global freight-hauling business.</p>
<p>But since the acquisition, Consolidated has posted a
string of quarterly net losses, and last month, it suspended
its quarterly dividend. Consolidated officials and Mr. Scott
couldn't be reached for comment.</p>
