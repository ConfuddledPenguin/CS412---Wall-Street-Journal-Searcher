	<p class="article-leader">New Plan Realty Trust, the nation's largest equity real
estate investment trust, announced yesterday that it intends
to step up its acquisition of shopping centers and apartment
complexes by focusing on foreclosed bank property.
   "We feel that this marketplace is a good one," said
William Newman, chairman, adding that New Plan has
accumulated $140 million with which to buy properties over
the next 12 to 18 months.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>New Plan, based in New York, invests primarily in strip
centers in the East, not large enclosed malls. Mr. Newman
said that the trust aims to pick up the distressed properties
at 25% to 50% of replacement value. In fiscal 1990, the trust
purchased 14 shopping centers.</p>
