	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Moody's Investors Service Inc. said it lowered
the credit ratings of Baltimore Gas & Electric Co. because of
continued outages at the company's Calvert Cliffs nuclear
units, accelerating replacement energy costs and uncertain
prospects for rate increases. The credit rating change
affects about $2.5 billion of the company's securities.
   Ratings lowered include those on first refunding mortgage
and secured pollution control revenue bonds, to single-A-1
from double-A-3; shelf registration of first refunding
mortgage bonds, to (P)single-A-1 from (P)double-A-3;
unsecured pollution control revenue bonds and other unsecured
debt, to single-A-2 from single-A-1; unsecured pollution
control revenue bonds, to single-A-2/VMIG1 from
single-A-1/VMIG1; preferred stock, to single-A-1 from
double-A-3; preference stock, to single-A-2 from single-A-1;
and shelf registration of preference stock, to (P)single-A-2
from (P)single-A-1.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Responding to the downgrading, the utility said in a
statement that it believes it "should be able to recover
these expenditures" related to replacement power and
maintenance and has filed for base and fuel rate increases
with the Maryland Public Service Commission.</p>
