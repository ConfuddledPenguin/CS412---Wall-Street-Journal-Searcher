	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- The Pentagon, starting a gradual process of
paring down the huge U.S. Cold-War troop presence abroad,
said it will eliminate or reduce operations at 150 mostly
small foreign sites, mainly in Europe.
   The cutbacks are designed to carry out earlier pledges to
shrink the size of the armed forces in response to budget
cuts, and to meet force reductions that will be required in
Europe under the conventional arms control treaty expected to
be signed in November. That treaty will require the U.S., the
U.S.S.R., and 21 other countries to reduce the number of
their tanks and other weapons in Europe.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Defense officials said the closings aren't connected with
the current U.S. troop buildup in Saudi Arabia, which is
designed to force Iraq to withdraw from Kuwait. Indeed,
administration officials said the bases closings would be so
gradual that they wouldn't free any significant number of
troops for use in the Persian Gulf any time soon.</p>
<p>The closings will take place slowly over several years,
starting with the fiscal year beginning Oct. 1.</p>
<p>"It's partly a matter of the obvious changing situation,"
said Pentagon spokesman Pete Williams. "As the threat changes
in Eastern Europe, as the Soviet forces pull back, as Eastern
European governments change, become democratically elected,
clearly the nature of our deployments in . . . Europe changes
as well."</p>
<p>Mr. Williams added that "the second thing we have to
contend with is declining budgets in future years."</p>
<p>The 150 military "sites" range from tiny support posts to
large air bases, but don't include any of the most important
U.S. combat bases in the heart of central Europe. The largest
affected installations are three air bases: Torrejon in
Spain, and Lindsey and Hessich Oldendorf in West Germany. All
150 sites are clustered around 44 locations, the Pentagon
said.</p>
<p>The Pentagon declined to estimate the number of troops
that will be withdrawn from Europe as a result of the
cutbacks, nor the costs involved. Officials said some troops
serving at the affected sites might simply be moved to others
in the U.S. or abroad.</p>
<p>The announcement is certain to be welcomed in Moscow,
which is pulling all its troops out of Europe and had been
pressing the administration to make a unilateral statement of
its own intentions.</p>
<p>Rep. Pat Schroeder (D., Colo.), chairwoman of the house
subcommittee on military installations, called the list
"disappointing." She said "these sites include gas stations
on the autobahn, isolated housing units and athletic fields,
and sites which had long ago been slated for closure.
Facilities like these are closed every day at bases in the
U.S."</p>
<p>The Pentagon doesn't require congressional approval to
close the foreign facilities, as it would if they were
located in the U.S.</p>
