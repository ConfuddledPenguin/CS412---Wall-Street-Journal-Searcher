	<p class="article-leader">HOUSTON -- The average price of regular unleaded gasoline
at self-service pumps is $1.292 a gallon, down two-tenths of
a cent from a week earlier, the American Automobile
Association said yesterday after a nationwide spot check of
stations.
   The AAA's Fuel Gauge Report said the average price is 21.7
cents a gallon higher than it was Aug. 1, the day before Iraq
invaded Kuwait, leading to a worldwide embargo against oil
from Iraq and from occupied Kuwait. The AAA, however, said
supplies of gasoline remain adequate through the U.S.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Prices retreated slightly in the Midwest, Southeast and
West in the latest report, while small increases occurred in
New England and in the Middle Atlantic and Great Lakes
states. Prices were unchanged in the Southwest.</p>
