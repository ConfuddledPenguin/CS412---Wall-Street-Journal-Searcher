	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Steven V. Ross, chairman and chief executive
officer of Time Warner Inc., has been bottom-fishing the
sunken stock of the media and publishing conglomerate.
   Since July 23, Mr. Ross has spent almost $40 million on
Time Warner shares, according to insider filings with the
Securities and Exchange Commission.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The purchases arguably rank Mr. Ross as the most bullish
company chairman in the U.S. He has spent more money on
shares of his company than any other top corporate official
in the country so far this year, according to Invest/Net, a
North Miami, Fla., concern that tracks insider filings.</p>
<p>But then, Mr. Ross has a lot of money. Under terms of
Time's takeover of Warner Communications Inc., Mr. Ross, then
Warner's chairman and chief executive, got $193 million,
which included compensation promised to him under his Warner
employment contract. He also got options for 1.8 million Time
Warner shares exercisable at $150 a share. The deal also
called for Mr. Ross to be guaranteed a base salary of
$800,000 a year for 10 years, plus bonuses.</p>
<p>That 1989 takeover was controversial. Time, which had
already agreed to merge with Warner, rejected a sweetened
$200-a-share bid from Paramount Communications Inc. Back
then, Time stock hit a record high of $182.75. But since the
merger, the renamed Time Warner stock has plummeted to less
than half of that.</p>
<p>In more than 70 separate purchases in late July and
August, Mr. Ross bought 175,000 Time Warner common shares for
an average of about $90 each, as well as 575,500 Class C and
Class D preferred shares at an average of about $41 each,
according to the company. The shares were purchased for his
trust account.</p>
<p>So far, Mr. Ross's investment is under water. In New York
Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, Time Warner
common closed at $77.625, down 25 cents. The Class C shares
closed at $38.25, and the Class D, at $38.375.</p>
<p>Mr. Ross declined to comment on his recent spending spree.
But at the company's 1990 annual meeting at New York's
Ziegfeld Theatre, Mr. Ross told shareholders who questioned
his salary that his stockholdings would ultimately prove even
more profitable.</p>
<p>"I believe those 1.8 million shares of Time Warner stock
at $150 a share are going to make me more money than I've
ever made in my life," he said. At the time, Mr. Ross blamed
the stock's sharp decline on the potential re-regulation of
the cable-television industry. Time Warner is the parent
company of HBO, among other cable enterprises.</p>
<p>A Time Warner spokeswoman said that Mr. Ross's decision to
buy the shares "speaks for itself."</p>
<p>Jessica J. Reif, First Boston Corp. analyst, downgraded
the company to a "hold" recommendation from a "buy" in
February, citing Time Warner's $10.8 billion debt burden and
the risk that regulation of the cable or
television-syndication industries could harm those
businesses.</p>
<p>Now, however, she says that "all the bad news is in the
stock" and that either of two developments could prompt her
to recommend its purchase -- a corporate restructing that
would sell units to reduce debt, or "benign" legislation from
Congress on regulation of the cable industry.</p>
<p>All of Mr. Ross's purchases were made in the open market.
Top officials of companies more frequently buy by exercising
stock options -- but Mr. Ross's options for 1.8 million
shares at $150 each are all currently under water.</p>

<p>HIGH RATINGS: Sumner Redstone, chairman of Viacom Inc.,
purchased $1.4 million of its stock in several trades in
August, according to SEC filings.</p>
<p>Mr. Redstone, chairman of National Amusements Inc., the
majority shareholder in Viacom, has been aggressively
accumulating shares of the Dedham, Mass., media company for
roughly two years. But lately he has stepped up the pace of
his buying, he said, because of the stock's weakness.</p>
<p>"All the stocks in the media industry took a hit, but I
think it was indiscriminate and not rational," he said. "The
drop of the stock does not reflect the operations of Viacom."</p>
<p>In American Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday,
Viacom's common closed at $19.75 a share, down 37.5 cents. It
traded above $32 a share last October.</p>
<p>Mr. Redstone spent most of the money, about $846,000, on
Viacom's relatively new Class B nonvoting shares. The shares
were created in June, the company said, to allow greater
flexibility in acquisitions. Because some pension funds
cannot hold nonvoting stock, the Class B Viacom shares are
trading several points below the Class A, and "we see that as
irrational," Mr. Redstone said.</p>
<p>Mr. Redstone paid an average of $19.68 a share for the
Class A common and $16.68 for the Class B, according to SEC
filings. The Class B shares closed at $17.875, unchanged, in
composite trading yesterday on the Amex.</p>
<p>The purchases increased his and National Amusements' huge
stake in the company by less than 0.1%.</p>
