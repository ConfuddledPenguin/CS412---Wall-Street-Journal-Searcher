	<p class="article-leader">There has been a justified concern over the prospect that
Iraq might employ its chemical weapons against the forces of
the U.S. and its allies. No one questions that Iraq has a
large supply of various chemical agents that it can deliver
by a number of means. Possibly its most potent weapon is the
Soviet Scud B missile, which is capable of delivering such
agents to a distance of 400 miles. When pressed during the
war with Iran, Iraq employed these weapons to produce as many
as 5,000 casualties a day. It has also used them against its
own citizens, the Kurds. With these facts in mind, the issue
that arises in the current altercation is how to discourage
this use.
   There are a number of options to be considered: As a
defensive measure, military personnel could be sealed in a
protective garment. Against some agents it is doubtful that
this measure would be effective. In any case the garments
would impair troop performance. It is not surprising that
such a solution was not well received by NATO when it was
faced with an impressive Soviet chemical- and
biological-weapons threat. Further, daytime temperatures in
the Middle East deserts can exceed 120 degrees, creating an
unacceptable environment for the use of such clothing. For
these reasons this option should be rejected.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The second option would involve a U.S. deployment of a
chemical-weapons stockpile of sufficient capability. For this
solution the U.S. has little stomach. In fact, the current
aim of the U.S. administration is to eliminate stockpiles of
chemical weapons throughout the world.</p>
<p>The purpose of the third option would be to discourage the
Iraqi employment of any force, including the use of chemical
weapons, by the threat of the use of nuclear weapons. Were
the Iraqis not so dissuaded, the use of nuclear weapons
against Iraqi ground forces would best serve to defeat such
an attack. An enhanced radiation weapon is proposed. It would
be distinctly different from other strategic nuclear weapons.
Their yields would be much lower. Their predominant effect
would be to destroy living organisms while producing minimum
physical destruction. In this regard they would resemble the
effects produced by chemical agents. However, unlike these
agents, their employment would not be influenced by the
weather. Finally, the weapons function so that within a given
circle all living, exposed matter is destroyed; beyond this
circle the lethal effect diminishes rapidly.</p>
<p>As an immediate option, the nominal five-kiloton
enhanced-radiation warhead produced for the NATO Lance
missile could be employed. (These warheads were never
deployed in Europe.) If airburst over a battlefield, the area
promptly lethal to personnel in a tank would be about one
square mile. Beyond an area of five square miles there would
be no effect on exposed troops. With some effort such a
weapon could be readied almost immediately for either missile
or aircraft delivery. For such a weapon to be effective it
would need both to be advertised widely as a distinctive
chemical-warfare deterrent and to be endorsed strongly by the
president.</p>
<p>Those who find such a suggestion repulsive might well
change their opinions were an Iraqi chemical attack to result
in the death of thousands of U.S. troops.</p>
