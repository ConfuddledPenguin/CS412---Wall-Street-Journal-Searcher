	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- David Maxwell, who led the Federal National
Mortgage Association's dramatic turnaround, plans to retire
Jan. 31, and James Johnson, who joined Fannie Mae in January
as vice chairman, will step up as chairman and chief
executive officer.
   Mr. Maxwell, 60 years old, will be retiring one day shy of
his 10th anniversary at Fannie Mae. "I've always felt that 10
years is about the right amount of time for a CEO of a large
corporation to serve if he or she has fulfilled goals set out
at the beginning," he told a press conference yesterday. When
Mr. Maxwell took charge in 1981, Fannie Mae was a basket
case, losing $190.4 million that year. Last year, the company
reported net income of $807 million.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Fannie Mae -- a government-sponsored, publicly traded
company -- buys mortgages from lenders, packages some into
securities for sale to investors and holds the rest in its
portfolio. Last year, its assets climbed to $124 billion.</p>
<p>Mr. Maxwell's efforts to strengthen the company's
management and operations have won wide praise among analysts
and investors. And Mr. Johnson, 46, isn't expected to bring
any major change in philosophy or management style. Both men
are known as bright, intense and politically savvy managers.
Another stabilizing force, Roger Birk, Fannie Mae's president
and chief operating officer, said he will remain with the
company, and industry sources believe he will stay on for at
least a year. Mr. Birk, a few months younger than Mr.
Maxwell, had been chairman and chief executive of Merrill
Lynch & Co., before joining Fannie Mae in 1987.</p>
<p>Mr. Johnson also brings to the top job Wall Street
experience, having been a managing director at Shearson
Lehman Hutton since 1985, before joining Fannie Mae last Jan.
1. He is well-connected in Washington, having been president
of a Washington consulting firm and serving as executive
assistant to Vice President Walter Mondale and chairman of
Mr. Mondale's 1984 presidential campaign.</p>
<p>"I don't think Jim Johnson will skip a beat," said Robert
Hottensen, an analyst with Goldman, & Sachs Co. "I think that
David Maxwell has done two outstanding things: He has set the
tone for the company's strong competitive position and has
built one of the outstanding management teams in the mortgage
finance business."</p>
<p>For his part, Mr. Johnson said he expects to continue
Fannie Mae's commitments, including managing interest rates
and credit risk, helping to solve the nation's housing
problems and providing first-rate customer service.</p>
<p>Fannie Mae's stock closed at $27.50, down $1.50, yesterday
in composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange.</p>
