	<p class="article-leader">Electronic Data Technologies said it will post a fiscal
fourth-quarter loss and announced executive changes and work
force reductions in the wake of a sharp drop in sales.
   The company, which makes computerized systems for the
gambling industry, said the loss reflects increases in
reserves for accounts receivable and inventory, severance
costs related to planned layoffs, and write-downs of certain
products.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The loss will be "fairly large but it's too early to say
how big" said Diane Van Son, director of finance. The quarter
and year end Sept. 30. In the year-earlier quarter, the
company had net income of $564,000, or 15 cents a share.</p>
<p>Ms. Van Son said the company began to experience a sharp
decline in orders from its casino customers about four months
ago.</p>
<p>Electronic Data Technologies said its chief financial
officer, David Brogan, resigned two weeks ago "to pursue
other interests." Most of his duties have been assumed by
William Vargas, corporate controller.</p>
<p>Ms. Van Son said the company plans to pare its work force
by about 20%. The company now has about 300 employees in Las
Vegas and Reno, Nev.</p>
