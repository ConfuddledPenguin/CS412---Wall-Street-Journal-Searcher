	<p class="article-leader">Nynex Corp., signaling a more aggressive posture overseas,
is expected to name Charles J. Many to head a new
international office in Brussels, Belgium.
   Mr. Many, president of Nynex Mobile Communications, the
company's cellular unit, has a reputation within the cellular
industry as a tenacious executive with a keen interest in
marketing. He has also been a driving force in Nynex Mobile's
push into emerging cellular technologies. Earlier this
summer, for instance, Nynex announced plans to build a
personal communications network in Manhattan based on a
technology called code division multiple access, or CDMA,
which allows many more simultaneous conversations than other
technologies.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Like other Baby Bells, Nynex is playing catch-up with San
Francisco-based Pacific Telesis Group, which teamed with
European partners to win an important contract to build and
operate a cellular system in Germany. Although Nynex and its
U.K. partners aggressively pursued cable television
franchises in the U.K., the company's European business
largely consists of computer software sales and consulting.</p>
<p>A Nynex spokesman declined to comment on reports that Mr.
Many would soon be transferred to Europe, and Mr. Many wasn't
available. The spokesman acknowledged that the company is
positioning itself to take advantage of twin forces at work
in the global telecommunications market: privatization and
deregulation. "We're very serious about international
markets," the spokesman said. Important parts of that
strategy, he said, are cellular and data communications. In
April, Nynex set up a Worldwide Information & Cellular
Services Group, headed by Ivan G. Seidenberg, a corporate
executive vice president.</p>
<p>The company is expected to make other executive changes,
including naming Mr. Many's successor at Nynex Mobile and
reorganizing Materiel Enterprises Co., the purchasing arm for
New York Telephone and New England Telephone, people familiar
with the situation said.</p>
<p>Overseas operations last year accounted for only a small
fraction of Nynex's $13.2 billion in revenue. But the company
has said that it is counting on foreign ventures to bring in
as much as 20% of its revenue by the end of the decade.</p>
<p>"The fact that Nynex has chosen a cellular guy is good,"
said Jack Grubman, an analyst with PaineWebber Inc. "The only
thing that makes sense in Europe is cellular as opposed to
becoming some minority partner in a land-line network."</p>
<p>Mr. Many, a native of New York City, joined Bell
Laboratories in 1960 and held several management positions
before moving in 1975 to New York Telephone, where he held
jobs in management information systems, networking and
marketing. From there, he moved to Nynex Business Information
Systems Co., holding jobs as vice president of sales, vice
president of new ventures and vice president of marketing. He
became president of Nynex Mobile in 1986, and has briefly
been chairman of the Cellular Telecommunications Industry
Association, the main trade group for the cellular industry.</p>
