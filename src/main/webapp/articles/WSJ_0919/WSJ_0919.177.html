	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- The U.S. has agreed to pay $200 million to
Tehran as an interim step in resolving a decade-old dispute
involving American weapons bought by Iran but held in the
U.S.
   The two nations signed an agreement in the Hague,
Netherlands, according to a U.S. official here, and the
settlement will be submitted to a nine-member tribunal for
approval. The U.S. official said approval could come as soon
as this week. The official added that the $200 million will
be deposited by Iran into a special account at the Dutch
Central Bank from which outstanding claims made by the U.S.
against Iran would be paid.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The $200 million is part of an Iranian claim involving
about $400 million in military equipment Tehran owned that
was in the U.S. at the time of the Iranian revolution. The
equipment, impounded after the 1979 seizing of the U.S.
Embassy in Tehran, includes one combat aircraft, several
helicopters, a submarine, missiles and spare parts.</p>
<p>The U.S. contends that because the equipment was used and
in the U.S. for repair at the time it was impounded, it is
worth far less than Iran claims. The U.S. also contends that
the balance owed is $93 million, plus interest, and
negotiations between the two nations are continuing.</p>
<p>Iran has said the total military-sales claim, which
involves about 1,200 items, is valued at about $11 billion.
The U.S. contends that the figure is far lower. The tribunal,
set up in 1980, is the only official point of contact between
the two nations. The tribunal has three judges appointed by
the U.S., three judges appointed by Iran, and three neutral
judges appointed by the six other judges.</p>
<p>The U.S. has denied that the negotiations, which have been
going on for a decade, are related to the current crisis in
the Persian Gulf.</p>
