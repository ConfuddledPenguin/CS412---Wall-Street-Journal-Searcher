	<p class="article-leader">It was no surprise that several people in the Senate
hearing room yesterday wore Stop Souter buttons. What was
surprising is that some of them were conservative Republican
staffers, amazed by what they had heard from David Souter.
His hearings made clear he will not be William Brennan, but
also will not be Robert Bork. His confirmation thus ensured,
the question is: Will Justice Souter rule according to the
signals many think he sent in the hearings or according to
the way he ruled the past 12 years in more than 200 opinions?
   The jury is still out after the fog of three days of
hearings as political theater. The senators who smeared,
tarred and feathered Mr. Bork established that their hearings
are not Oxford tutorials. Instead, full points for clever
hedging. Certainly Bush administration coaches urged Judge
Souter to offer up soothing words to placate liberal
senators.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Still, imagine the shock of Republican Sen. Charles
Grassley when he tossed Judge Souter this soft pitch:</p>
<p>"Those who advocate a greater activist role for the court
say that the broad and spacious terms of the Constitution
lend themselves to court-made solutions when the political
branches fail to act. What is your sense of this perception
that the courts, rather than the elected branches, should
take the lead in creating a more just society?"</p>
<p>"Courts must accept their own responsibility for making a
just society," Judge Souter said, adding that "political
responsibility, constitutional responsibility abhor a
vacuum." Judge Souter did stress that Congress should act
when it has the authority, but did not reassure that "a just
society" is one in which judges stick to their knitting.
Justice Brennan, the great vacuum filler, must have been
amused.</p>
<p>Judge Souter also said he thought there were rights not
clearly enumerated in the Constitution. He was pressed on how
far judges can go in discovering these rights. One line of
questions asked for his reaction to an approach by Justice
Antonin Scalia, who said judges should look for "the most
specific level at which a relevant tradition protecting or
denying protection to the asserted right can be identified."
In other words, go back in our history to see if the supposed
right has ever been viewed as a constitutional right.</p>
<p>Democratic Sen. Joseph Biden hinted to Judge Souter what
he thought of this approach. Sen. Biden dismissed the idea of
looking to American traditions with the sneer of "garbage in,
garbage out." Judge Souter took a middle road. He preferred a
"quest for reliable evidence," a less defined notion than the
one Justice Scalia offered.</p>
<p>Despite many 10-second sound bites that sent chills up
conservative spines -- praising Justice Brennan as
"fearlessly principled," for example -- the full transcript
would not necessarily exclude Judge Souter from the court's
intellectual conservative wing. In the end, for example,
Judge Souter only acknowledged a privacy right for married
couples, declining clearly to extend the concept of privacy.
It's murky, but he didn't seem to accept the Griswold
contraception case, with its search for penumbras and
emanations from enumerated rights.</p>
<p>Then there was endless questioning usually in legal code
about how he might rule on abortion, civil-rights and other
politicized issues. These questions were often framed as how
seriously judges should take which rights. The Constitution
of course does not say that some rights are important and
others are optional. Yet judges over the years have announced
that some rights, such as the First Amendment, get the
highest protection, while others, economic liberties
especially, get less or no protection. This is judicial
activism through three made-up levels of review: rational
relationship, substantially related and strict scrutiny.</p>
<p>Judge Souter assured liberal senators that
sex-discrimination cases should get greater protection than
economic-rights cases. The problem with this analysis is that
the greatest act of judicial activism is denying equal
protection to all rights. Judge Souter hinted that he had
thought about this problem, but hadn't quite "gotten to the
point of saying we ought to scrap the whole notion of three
tiers and just take, in effect, every issue as an original
balancing issue." Maybe he will. As Federal Appeals Judge
Alex Kozinski has said, "I can certainly conceive of rational
people who, if pressed to a choice, would be willing to give
up the right to wear a jacket with obscene words on it in
order to retain the right to construct a building or run a
railroad."</p>
<p>Judge Souter was asked about the litigation explosion,
which not even bar presidents deny. Judge Souter said, "I'm
wary of putting very much weight" on the explanation that
judges have recognized "new causes of action that didn't
exist 10, 20 and 50 years ago." Instead, he said that "the
fact is the population has grown far more exponentially than
rights of action." Even assuming somehow this is true for New
Hampshire, Justice Souter would quickly feel the effects of
the more than quintupling of cases in federal courts to
275,000 today from 45,000 in 1950. Claims under everything
from RICO to strict product liability to "psychic injury"
dwarf the population increase in both citizens and judges.</p>
<p>There was one question that Judge Souter knocked out of
the park. He was asked, "Do you think it is judicial activism
to rule that capital punishment is always cruel and unusual
punishment?" The audience in the hearing room grew very
quiet. This prohibition on all death penalties is the
position of Justices Brennan and Thurgood Marshall, despite
the Constitution's contemplation of capital punishment in
several clauses. Not even Anthony Kennedy in his hearings
totally dismissed this position. Judge Souter did, saying, "I
think that would be an insupportable decision under the
Constitution, and I say that with a recognition that there
are members of the Supreme Court who disagree with me."</p>
<p>What about the judicial activism that created the
exclusionary rule as the way this country would protect
accused criminals? "It's one thing to try to come up with a
pragmatic approach to the enforcement of a constitutional
value or standard which is itself accepted," Judge Souter
said. "It's another thing to derive standards based simply on
personal judicial views on what would be desirable in the
world." Judge Souter said if the exclusionary rule makes it
back to the Supreme Court, the justices should "ask very
practical questions about how it actually works." In other
words, weigh the exclusionary rule against the criminals who
get off or get plea bargains and also against alternative
remedies against the police. This could be bye-bye, Miranda.</p>
<p>One of the tragedies of the Bork battle is that the Senate
hearings have been reduced to primitive ritual. A
conservative nominee must offer up enough sacrifices to
please the gods, but not so many that he becomes despised by
his own kind. We will know whether David Souter passed both
parts of this test only once he has been given the
opportunity as Justice Souter.</p>
