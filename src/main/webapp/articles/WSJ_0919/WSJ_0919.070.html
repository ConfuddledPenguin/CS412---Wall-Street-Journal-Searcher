	<p class="article-leader">Even as many magazine titles find their way to the
shredder, publishers are hoping that small business could
mean nicely sized profits.
   They're eagerly launching new books aimed at a growing
market, small-business owners, while advertising revenue
slips for much of the magazine industry.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>This year alone, Entrepreneur Inc., which publishes
Entrepreneur magazine, started Entrepreneurial Woman, and the
National Federation of Independent Business launched
Independent Business for its 560,000 members. Just this week,
American Express Co. is mailing the first copies of Your
Company to more than one million of its corporate
card-holders who run small businesses.</p>
<p>In the three years ended last December, another 15
small-business publications started, says Samir Husni, a
University of Mississippi associate professor who publishes a
guide to new magazines.</p>
<p>These publications seek to capitalize on the boom in
entrepreneurship spurred by the prosperity of the 1980s. The
ranks of newly incorporated businesses have grown at an
average 687,000 a year since 1985, up from 453,000 a year in
the late 1970s, says the U.S. Small Business Administration.</p>
<p>The total number of non-farm businesses -- including
self-employed individuals and part-time entrepreneurs --
reached 20 million this year, up 54% since 1980. Among the
reasons for the growth: Waves of women with managerial
interests and laid-off corporate managers have been going
into business for themselves.</p>
<p>But as magazines aimed at the small-business market
proliferate, they are changing strategy. Unlike many
publications started in the 1970s -- such as Inc. and
Entrepreneur -- the newcomers increasingly target specialized
audiences.</p>
<p>For instance, some have aimed only at family-business
owners, Hispanic entrepreneurs, home-based operators,
franchisees or women. Rieva Lesonsky, editor in chief of both
Entrepreneur and Entrepreneurial Woman, says the women's
market until recently had "hardly been touched. We're the
only book that serves it." Entrepreneurial Woman says its
circulation has reached 200,000.</p>
<p>Some publishers aim at newer entrepreneurs, while others
are geared toward more experienced owners. Entrepreneur
magazine's Ms. Lesonsky says Entrepreneur addresses an
audience of serious business operators who are younger than
the typical National Federation of Independent Business
member.</p>
<p>Independent Business goes to NFIB members whose average
business has operated for 13 years and employs 15 people,
says Don Phillipson, editorial director. The
September-October issue features such articles as "Big
Customers: Selling to Big Business," "Tax Breaks for Your
Home Office" and "Offbeat Business: Inveterate Invertebrates
-- Ah, the Wonders of Worms."</p>
<p>The fastest-growing segment of the field aims squarely at
small-business wannabees. These are often newsstand browsers
who dream of owning a business someday -- though many will
never get beyond the daydream stage. Nearly half of the
magazines entering the market in the 1987-89 period address
this market, with features describing "hot" new business
opportunities.</p>
<p>Advertisers say the increasing specialization makes their
job easier. Bruce Mowery, director of small-business markets
for Apple Computer Inc., says the broadening array of
specialized magazines lets Apple target the small-business
markets it wants to stress.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, these magazines haven't been immune to the
magazine industry's downturn this year. While Entrepreneur
has had nearly a 14% gain in advertising pages this year from
last, two market veterans -- Inc. and Success -- have
sustained advertising declines, says Steven Cohn, editor of
Media Industry Newsletter, a trade publication.</p>
<p>New magazines -- which generally don't make money for
several years, if ever -- are finding it particularly rough
going this year. Family Business, a monthly begun late last
year for family-business owners, struggles along with about
10 ad pages an issue. "We're the new kid on the block, and in
this advertising environment, it's hard to sell yourself,"
says editor Stephen Solomon.</p>
<p>Struggles for ad dollars convince some publishers that
there's a limit to just how thin they can slice the market.
Some fear niche marketing may get carried too far -- at least
by their competitors. Independent Business's Mr. Phillipson
calls Entrepreneurial Woman "a terrible idea." He contends
that the concerns of women business owners are much the same
as their male counterparts.</p>
<p>Ms. Lesonsky, at Entrepreneurial Woman, insists women
still face problems raising money and gaining credibility
that men don't. Articles in the October issue include: "The
Enemy Within; Are You Sabotaging Your Own Success?" and
"Think Big; The Largest Barrier to Getting Venture Capital Is
Asking for Too Little."</p>
<p>On the other hand, Ms. Lesonsky wonders if there is a big
enough audience for another magazine, Family Business. She
says family business owners are "business-owners first,
family members second."</p>
<p>Family Business publisher Leonard Zweig counters that his
readers must grapple with issues that don't trouble
non-family business owners. Among other articles, the
magazine's October issue carries "The Reluctant Successor,"
chronicling a son's decision to leave the family business to
"pursue a different dream."</p>
<p>Some companies think they can limit the risk by
"controlling" circulation -- generally, distributing the
magazine free to a targeted audience. Besides using its new
controlled-circulation magazine to promote its credit card,
American Express has signed on major advertisers such as
International Business Machines Corp. as a sponsor.</p>
<p>Even with the current financial strains in the magazine
business, marketing experts see continued growth in the
small-business segment. Says Apple Computer's Mr. Mowery,
"Magazines that cater to the small-business audience are
flourishing right along with the small businesses."</p>
