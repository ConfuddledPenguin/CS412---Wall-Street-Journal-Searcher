	<p class="article-leader">Tokyo stock prices finished lower for the fourth
consecutive trading day Tuesday but managed to stay higher
than intraday lows late in the afternoon session with the
help of bargain hunting.
   In London, shares failed to hold onto an initial rally and
ended sharply lower as the disclosure of U.S. economic data
restrained trading activity.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Tokyo's Nikkei Index of 225 issues went down 480.78
points, or 1.97%, to 23884.82.</p>
<p>In Tokyo Wednesday, the Nikkei index fell another 68.36
points to close the morning session at 23816.46.</p>
<p>Investor participation on Tuesday was lackluster as
growing concern about higher domestic interest rates and
continuing uncertainty about the Mideast situation dried up
buying interest, traders said.</p>
<p>Trading was volatile as the thin overall volume permitted
even a small number of sell orders and arbitrage selling to
push down the Nikkei Index, traders said.</p>
<p>The index plunged as low as 23308 points early in the
afternoon, before bouncing up on a small amount of buying.</p>
<p>Volume on the first section was estimated at 400 million
shares, up from 306 million shares Monday. Decliners
outnumbered gainers 894 to 85, while 92 others were
unchanged.</p>
<p>The Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed in the
first section fell 43.86 points, or 2.36%, to 1816.33.</p>
<p>The second section index dropped 69.16 points, or 1.95%,
to 3474.99. Volume was estimated at 6.5 million shares, up
from 5.1 million shares Monday.</p>
<p>"Trading both on cash and futures markets was interest
rate-driven," said a trader at J.P. Morgan Securities.</p>
<p>"The market is gradually discounting another discount rate
increase," said a trader at Dai-Ichi Securities.</p>
<p>A report by the Nihon Keizai Shimbun in its Tuesday
morning editions that the long-term prime rate will be raised
for the third consecutive month in October fueled
expectations that domestic interest rates will go higher,
traders said. Such expectations were also prompted by another
upswing in oil prices, the traders said.</p>
<p>Also, rumors that securities houses and institutional
investors will sell Japanese government bonds heavily
Wednesday, resulting in higher yields, damped sentiment in
the stock market Tuesday afternoon, traders said.</p>
<p>Widespread perceptions that domestic interest rates
haven't yet peaked further discouraged buying by
institutional investors, who have been slowing trade activity
ahead of the fiscal midyear book closing at the end of
September, traders said.</p>
<p>Observers attributed Tuesday's decline to the lack of
buying, which they said made the market unable to absorb even
a small amount of sell orders.</p>
<p>"Stocks are priced abnormally low," said Kazuhiko Hama,
general manager of stock trading at Nomura Securities. "It's
largely because of the seasonal factor," he added, predicting
that the worst will be over with the disappearance of
term-end factors.</p>
<p>A trader at Yamaichi Securities said some institutions are
ready to start bargain hunting next week because trading
after Tuesday will be recorded as October transactions.</p>
<p>Because stocks have fallen on a small amount of selling, a
rebound may not require a large amount of buying, the trader
said.</p>
<p>Mitsuhiro Nakano, an analyst with Daiwa Securities,
warned, however, that as long as the bond market remains
unstable, institutions are unlikely to start buying actively.</p>
<p>Kobe Steel fell 13 yen to 516 yen (9.5 cents to $3.78),
while Nippon Steel dropped 15 yen to 456 yen. Kansai Electric
Power declined 140 yen to 2420 yen, and Tokyo Electric Power
was down 140 yen at 3040 yen.</p>
<p>Among financial shares, Mitsubishi Bank dropped 50 yen to
1780 yen, while Nomura Securities plummeted 20 yen to 1620
yen.</p>
<p>Blue-chip shares in the electronics and automobile sectors
also ended lower, with Sony down 170 yen at 6690 yen and
Toyota Motor falling 10 yen to 1890 yen.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Tokyo Steel gained 60 yen to 3960 yen,
reflecting speculation that the company may increase
dividends for the current fiscal year.</p>
<p>In London, traders said the disclosure of U.S. economic
indicators was hurting that market. Among them, the U.S. July
trade deficit grew to $9.3 billion from $5.3 billion in June,
and the U.S. consumer price index rose 0.8% in August.</p>
<p>As the London market fell through a key support level,
traders expected the market to fall lower still in search of
a new level. Wall Street drifted lower during London
afternoon trading, and traders were not optimistic for a
quick recovery.</p>
<p>Scattered buying was evident, but institutions continued
to stay away from any large holding positions, traders said.
What buying was done amounted to "topping up funds
discreetly, not to support levels but to get cheap stock,"
one trader said.</p>
<p>The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-Share Index fell
30.3 points to 2064, falling to the lowest close since April
24, 1989, when the index settled at 2062.</p>
<p>The Financial Times 30-Share Index ended down 29.3 points
at 1576.8. Volume was 379.2 million shares, well above
Monday's 286.6 million shares.</p>
<p>Among several companies reporting interim results,
property and construction concern Taylor Woodrow, said
half-year pretax profit fell 12% to #38 million ($72.8
million) as high interest rates weakened earnings. The shares
fell a penny to 200 pence, as traders were relieved that the
company's results matched expectations.</p>
<p>Stores and property management company Kingfisher also
matched expectations with a 24% slump in pretax profit
following a sharp decline in property operations. The shares
gained 11 pence to 318 pence.</p>
<p>Bermuda-based security services and auctions concern ADT
recorded a 38% rise in pretax profit for the half-year, at
the bottom of expectations, and offered a bonus share to
investors. ADT fell 5 pence to 148 pence.</p>
<p>On the Frankfurt Stock Exchange, investors were still
expecting Continental AG to reject Pirelli's takeover bid
outright or arrange a watered-down compromise. This would
deprive the stock of the takeover speculation that has buoyed
Continental shares in recent months. Continental plunged 5.5%
to 250.50 marks ($161.87), after a 7.1% decline Monday.</p>
<p>In Milan, Pirelli fell 10 lire to 1775 lire ($1.53) and
slumped to 1745 lire in the after market.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, shares closed lower on all major European
markets. South African gold stocks closed lower. Stocks also
closed lower in Sydney, Hong Kong, Taipei, Manila, Singapore
and Wellington, but rose in Seoul.</p>
<p>Here are price trends on the world's major stock markets,
as calculated by Morgan Stanley Capital International
Perspective, Geneva. To make them directly comparable, each
index is based on the close of 1969 equaling 100. The
percentage change is since year-end.</p>
