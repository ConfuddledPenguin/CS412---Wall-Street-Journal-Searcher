	<p class="article-leader">Two officials of Colonial Realty Co. transferred $2
million from investment partnerships they managed into
personal accounts just before disclosing that the troubled
real estate marketer would be unable to pay debts, according
to bankers who worked with the company.
   A spokesman for Colonial said that the transfers "never
happened."</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The two officials, Benjamin Sisti and Jonathan Googel, are
founders and partners of Colonial, a West Hartford, Conn.,
syndicator of about $1 billion in real estate partnerships.
Last week, six Connecticut banks filed to place Colonial,
Messrs. Sisti and Googel and another Colonial partner into
bankruptcy proceedings in federal court in Hartford., Conn.</p>
<p>The bank transfers worried officials of Burritt
Interfinancial Bancorp., of New Britain, one of the six
banks, according to bankruptcy court affidavits filed by two
Burritt officials. The bankers said that the transfers were
made just before Messrs. Sisti and Googel declared they would
be unable to pay debts that Colonial owed and were declaring
a moratorium on interest payments.</p>
<p>Colonial disputed the bankers' accounts. Transfers from
the partnerships' account to Messrs. Sisti and Googel "never
happened," said Tom Drohan, a Colonial spokesman. "The money
was routed to clients' funds to finance projects. The banks
were attempting to tie up our operating capital."</p>
<p>The transfers, if they occurred as Burritt said, could be
a subject for possible legal action against the Colonial
officials, according to federal law enforcement officials,
who asked not to be named. The funds in the partnership
accounts, Burritt says, were owned mainly by the individual
investors to whom Colonial had sold partnership interests.</p>
<p>The disputed transfers are just one aspect of lenders' and
investors' concern about Colonial, which has been squeezed by
the slumping real estate market in Connecticut and in many of
the other 18 states where its partnerships own property.
Bankers to Colonial estimated yesterday that loans to
Colonial, the partnerships and Colonial officials total more
than $1 billion.</p>
<p>With some of the properties known to be operating at a
loss, and closely held Colonial saying little about the
specifics of its financial woes, both banks and
limited-partner investors are getting edgy. Colonial says it
has "several thousand" partnerhip investors and that it is
current with all of them in distribution payments.</p>
<p>West Hartford investor Leslie Daniels says he bought into
a 220-unit Tamarac, Fla., apartment complex partnership
marketed by Colonial and Advest Group Inc. Mr. Daniels said
that each partnership unit lost $10,500 in 1990, three times
the projected loss of $3,800.</p>
<p>Although Colonial recently suspended quarterly
distributions to many of its limited partners, Mr. Daniels
says Colonial so far "hasn't broken a promise" because the
payout is not technically due until the end of the year.</p>
<p>What worries Mr. Daniel and other investors is that they
may be forced to make good on promissory notes, or pledges to
add more capital to the partnerships in the future, even if
the ventures go sour and Colonial can't make payments it
promised the investors.</p>
<p>"The big question that all of the investors have is, `Do
we throw good money after bad?' " he said. Investors are
considering the ramifications of walking away from the deal,
he said, adding: "If the downside is not too great, we might
just do that."</p>
<p>Several authorities on real estate limited partners say
that investors might not have much choice but to continue
making payments.</p>
<p>"Chances are, they're up the creek," said Spencer
Jefferies of Partnership Profiles, a Dallas partnership
research firm. Even if the general partner doesn't make a
payment guaranteed to the investor, in nearly all cases the
investor must continue meeting payments into the partnership,
Mr. Jefferies and other partnership specialists say.</p>
<p>Others potentially at risk include mortgage holders on
Colonial partnerships' properties and banks that loaned money
to the partnerships secured by the investors' promissory
notes. Colonial says it has sold about 85 partnerships since
its founding in 1966, with the bulk of them still active.</p>
<p>One big interested party is General Electric Credit Co.,
mortgage holder for Constitution Plaza, a Hartford building
owned by Colonial Constitution Partners LP. Earlier this
month, the General Electric Co. unit confirmed, it exercised
its right to receive rental payments from tenants directly,
rather than receiving mortgage payments from Colonial, the
partnership's manager. GE declined to specify the amount of
the mortgage, but bankers familiar with Colonial said it
exceeded $100 million.</p>
<p>Virginia Steinberg, a spokeswoman for GE Credit, said it
"was too early to tell" whether any of the mortgage loan was
at risk. "Colonial Realty has been a good client," she said.
"We're working with them in their financial difficulties."</p>
<p>Citytrust Bancorp., of Bridgeport, Conn., also confirmed
yesterday that it had loans outstanding to Colonial or its
partnerships. Citytrust declined to discuss particulars of
the loans.</p>
