	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Federal Communications Commission Chairman
Alfred C. Sikes delivered his most optimistic assessment yet
that the FCC is likely to ease federal rules barring the
three television networks from the rerun-sales business.
   Mr. Sikes told a broadcast industry luncheon here that by
early next year, the FCC will likely rule on how to soften
the so-called Financial Interest and Syndication Rules. The
regulations block the networks from selling series reruns to
local stations, forbid them from sharing in the profits from
reruns sold by other companies and prohibit the networks from
taking partial ownership stakes in programming.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"There is an emerging consensus, I believe, in Washington
that these rules do need some adjusting," the FCC chairman
said to the International Radio and Television Society.</p>
<p>Mr. Sikes said the Federal Communications Commission will
hold a major hearing with all parties in the rerun-rules
dispute some time before the end of this year, with a final
ruling expected in the first quarter of 1991.</p>
<p>If the rerun rules ultimately are lifted, the entire U.S.
entertainment business could undergo a realignment as
television networks would be freed to acquire, or merge, with
the studios that supply most of their prime time series.</p>
<p>For years the ABC, NBC and CBS networks have fought to
lift the rules, which were first imposed in 1970 when the
networks controlled over 95% of the viewing audience. Their
share now is 65%, with cable and independent stations making
steady gains.</p>
<p>The major opposition in the rerun battle has come from
Hollywood's major studios, which largely control the $3
billion-a-year market for reruns and other syndicated
programming.</p>
