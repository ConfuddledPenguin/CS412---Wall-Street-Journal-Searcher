	<p class="article-leader">TORONTO -- Stelco Inc. said it will slash its quarterly
dividend in half, cut salaries and reduce spending on capital
projects as a result of the recession in its steel markets
and the effects of a seven-week strike by the United
Steelworkers of America.
   The Toronto steel manufacturer said it will cut its
regular quarterly dividend payment to 12.5 Canadian cents
(U.S. 10.8 cents) a share from 25 Canadian cents a share, the
first such cut in nine years. The last time it cut its
dividend, Stelco was also in the midst of a lengthy
steelworkers' strike.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Company officials said that the decision to cut the
dividend, payable Nov. 1, could save Stelco about C$4.4
million (US$3.8 million). They declined to estimate savings
from cutting salaries and capital spending.</p>
<p>The company had planned to spend C$185 million on capital
projects during 1990, a significant portion of which was
accounted for by a project to reline one of its blast
furnaces. That reline, begun July 1, has been halted by the
strike, Stelco said.</p>
<p>A spokesman for Stelco said salaries will be cut
"progressively" as long as the strike continues. He declined
to identify the size of the initial reductions.</p>
<p>About 10,000 Stelco employees have been on strike since
Aug. 1. Talks are reported to be continuing under a news
blackout.</p>
<p>John Allan, chairman and chief executive officer of
Stelco, said in a statement that the company's management is
reviewing all of Stelco's businesses "with a view to
implementing additional cost containment measures including
consideration of various strategic structural changes
directed to improving shareholder value."</p>
<p>A Stelco spokesman declined to discuss what those
structural changes could include.</p>
