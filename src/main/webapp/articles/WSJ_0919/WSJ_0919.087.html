	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- Confirmation hearings for Supreme Court
nominee David Souter neared completion, with witnesses
testifying for and against, but the opposition from liberal
groups was less than expected.
   Most of the opposition at the Senate Judiciary Committee
hearings came from abortion-rights groups and women's rights
groups, who described the 51-year-old Judge Souter as
insensitive to the right to privacy. Molly Yard, president of
the National Organization for Women, declared a "state of
emergency" for women's rights.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Kate Michelman, director of the National Abortion Rights
Action League, said: "All the evidence points to the fact
that he will vote to overrule Roe vs. Wade," referring to the
1973 decision that recognized the right to abortion. "He said
nothing to allay our fears," she added.</p>
<p>But Sen. Alan Simpson (R., Wyo.), describing himself as
favoring the right to abortion, said the opposition by
abortion-rights groups was misplaced. "There are going to be
other Supreme Court choices when you're really going to need
to be in the trenches, and this is not one of them."</p>
<p>A number of civil rights and civil liberties organizations
decided not to oppose Judge Souter's nomination, including
the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund and the Alliance
for Justice. The influential Leadership Conference On Civil
Rights, which includes a broad range of groups and that led
the fight in 1987 to defeat Judge Robert Bork's nomination,
couldn't agree on a position for or against the nominee. The
group urged senators to question Judge Souter further on his
attitude toward racial discrimination. The committee is
unlikely to call Judge Souter back for further questioning.</p>
<p>Balancing the opposition were a number of witnesses,
including former Democratic Attorney General Griffin Bell,
who endorsed the nomination. Mr. Bell said that Mr. Souter, a
former New Hampshire Supreme Court justice who is now a
federal appeals court judge, has the "right vision for our
country and for the law."</p>
<p>The hearings are due to conclude today with a handful of
additional witnesses. The date hasn't been set for a vote by
the 14member committee, but Senate aides say unofficially
that it may be on Sept. 27. The confirmation is generally
viewed as a certainty.</p>
<p>Judge Souter, who completed his testimony Monday night,
remained in Washington yesterday, although not at the
hearings. He met briefly in the morning with some witnesses
who were to testify on his behalf, answered correspondence
for much of the day, and went to see the Boston Red Sox play
the Baltimore Orioles in Baltimore last night, aides said.
Next week, the avid outdoorsman is planning to return to New
Hampshire and go hiking while he awaits the Senate's action.</p>
<p>As the hearings continued yesterday, a dominant factor
continued to be what Democrats and Republicans alike
described as the impressive performance by Judge Souter.
During 18 hours of testimony over three days, he discussed in
detail dozens of Supreme Court precedents, legal principles
and details of court history, never consulting a single note,
or even requesting a break in the lengthy proceedings.</p>
<p>Late Monday night, as Judge Souter was concluding his
testimony, Sen. Joseph Biden (D., Del.), chairman of the
Judiciary Committee, said to the nominee: "It was a tour de
force on your part."</p>
