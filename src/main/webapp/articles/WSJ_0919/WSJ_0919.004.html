it will spend $30 million to expand an auto-glass factory in
Evart, Mich. The auto maker also said about 150 additional
hourly and salaried employees will be taken on at the
facility and 230,000 square feet will be added to the
50,000-square-foot building.
   The factory will make glass for Chrysler cars and for a
Jeep off-road vehicle model that is due to be produced in the
next two years.</p>
