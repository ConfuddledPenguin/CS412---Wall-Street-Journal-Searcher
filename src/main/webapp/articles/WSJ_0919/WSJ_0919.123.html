	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Blackstone Group, the investment banking
boutique, joined forces with a French investment bank,
Financiere Indosuez, to advise on mergers between companies
in the U.S., France and Belgium.
   Blackstone and the French concern said each would make an
equity investment of undisclosed size in the other. The new
venture, Blackstone Indosuez, is aimed at the burgeoning area
of cross-border mergers in Europe.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Financiere Indosuez has already invested $25 million in
Blackstone's merchant banking fund, and yesterday Blackstone
said it also plans, along with some of its existing
investors, to invest up to $50 million in a merchant banking
fund set up by Compagnie de Suez, the French parent of
Financiere Indosuez.</p>
<p>The Suez group, an industrial and financial holding
company, controls Societe Generale de Belgique, based in
Brussels, Belgium.</p>
<p>Roger Altman, vice chairman of Blackstone, said the two
firms have been working together informally for two years.
"One of the reasons we're confident that this joint venture
will be successful is that we lived together for a couple of
years before getting married," Mr. Altman said. Blackstone
already has alliances with other firms in Japan, Britain, and
Canada.</p>
<p>As part of the alliance, four Financiere Indosuez
employees will move from their existing offices here to
Blackstone's office. In turn, three Blackstone employees here
will transfer to Financiere Indosuez in Paris.</p>
