	<p class="article-leader">Continental Airlines Holdings Inc. said it made a one-time
payment of $80.5 million and assumed responsibility for up to
$600 million more over 12 years to satisfy pension
obligations at its former Eastern Airlines unit.
   In an agreement with the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corp.,
the federal agency that insures retirement benefits for
millions of workers, Continental Holdings agreed to pay
nearly all of what is owed on Eastern's seven underfunded
pension plans. Eastern is currently in Chapter 11
bankruptcy-law proceedings.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The pension settlement is one of the costliest legacies of
Continental Holdings' four-year-long control of Eastern,
which ended with a bankruptcy judge ousting management and
installing a trustee to run day-to-day operations earlier
this year. The parent company still owns the equity and under
federal law is liable for the pension plan.</p>
<p>Continental Holdings has put up $500 million worth of
collateral in the form of international routes of its
Continental Airlines unit to secure its agreement with the
PBGC.</p>
<p>Whether Continental Holdings has to pay all of its
obligations to the underfunded pension plans depends on a
variety of factors, ranging from the resolution of Eastern's
bankruptcy-law filing to the interest rates available on
certain annuities. As a result, the actual amount Continental
Holdings ultimately pays could vary by several hundred
million dollars.</p>
<p>At the very least, Continental said it would have to pay
$225 million, in monthly installments, over the next three
years.</p>
<p>Continental is obligated to make the pension payment
because Eastern Airlines can't pay the full amount, the
result of the carrier's tenure in bankruptcy court. Eastern
said its only contribution would be a $30 million payment, $8
million of which will be paid next month and the rest on Jan.
15.</p>
<p>Eastern's money will come from the roughly $1 billion
being held by the court in escrow from asset sales conducted
over the last 18 months of its Chapter 11 case.</p>
<p>That Continental Holdings would have to make such a
payment was no secret, as it has been negotiating for months
with the federal agency in what were often contentious talks.
It was unclear until now, however, how much of a financial
hit the company would take.</p>
<p>The pension liability has been an albatross to Continental
Holdings, and the company is understood to have told the
agency that the outstanding obligation was limiting its
ability to secure financing. Continental Holdings, the former
Texas Air Corp., has been unprofitable three of the last four
years, making money this year primarily on nonoperating
transactions.</p>
<p>The agency considered the payment plan a clear triumph,
since it will have to make no payment and the pension
obligations will be assumed entirely by Continental Holdings.
"We have structured a settlement to protect retirees and the
insurance program from one of the largest potential losses we
faced," said James B. Lockhart, the agency's executive
director. All retirees covered by the seven pension plans
will continue to receive full and uninterrupted pension
benefits from a trust set up to receive the agreed-upon
payments.</p>
<p>Continental Holdings said the payments will have no
immediate effect on its consolidated financial statements.
Its Continental Airlines unit, however, will record a
one-time charge to its retained earnings, but the amount
wasn't determined.</p>
<p>In a statement, Continental Holdings' president and chief
executive, Hollis Harris, said "we are pleased that this
matter has been resolved, and in such a way that it will not
hinder Continental's plans for future growth and increasing
profitability."</p>
