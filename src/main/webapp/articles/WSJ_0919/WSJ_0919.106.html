	<p class="article-leader">PARTNERSHIPS created as tax shelters face greater
scrutiny.
   The IRS plans to tighten regulation of installment sales
of partnerships being used to create artificial losses for
some large corporate taxpayers. The action follows complaints
from some tax advisers about a strategy promoted by Merrill
Lynch & Co. and other financial institutions. Merrill Lynch
declines to comment, asserting it doesn't give tax advice.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The controversial tax plan typically involves the creation
of a partnership by several investors, including one free of
U.S. tax liability who ultimately sells out to its
large-taxpayer partner once the partnership generates losses.
The large taxpayer then uses the losses to offset other
gains. The IRS, decrying such arrangements as "abusive,"
warns it will examine partnerships to see if "they lack
economic substance or are entered into for tax avoidance
purposes."</p>
<p>The IRS says it may issue a revenue ruling or rewrite its
regulation to block the disputed plans.</p>
<p>THERE ARE NO LOBBIES at tax summit. But that doesn't stop
lobbyists.</p>
<p>The budget negotiations at Andrews Air Force Base outside
Washington may result in the biggest tax bill ever, but the
distant location makes it a challenge for lobbyists eager to
have their views heard. Many turn to gossip to make their
points. Some call each other with feigned confidence to
proclaim that Democrats want a higher corporate tax, that
Republicans want to cut the advertising deduction and that,
last Friday, the deal was finally done -- all wrong. One
supposedly high-powered law firm retypes a day-old Democratic
offer made blurry from repeated copying, then spreads it
around.</p>
<p>Even lawmakers and their staffs are cut out from what's
going on. When asked by a lobbyist for the latest plans, one
GOP aide sends two lists obviously prepared by another
lobbyist, and mostly in error. Last week, House Majority
Leader Gephardt advised fellow negotiators to skip President
Bush's congressional address so they could duck menacing
questions from colleagues. Many did. When one negotiator
ventured on the House floor, he was surrounded by angry
members, prompting a hasty retreat.</p>
<p>CHEATING can be hazardous if your accountant is a
government snitch.</p>
<p>Roman Sobolevsky is appealing a federal court conviction
for obstruction of justice and conspiracy, arguing that the
government violated his privacy by enlisting accountant
Robert Freshman -- who has since died -- as an "agent
provocateur" to seek out Mr. Sobolevsky as a client and then
inform on his dealings. Mr. Sobolevsky in May was sentenced
to 33 months in prison, given three years probation and fined
$60,000 after a jury found him guilty in a case involving
grand-jury testimony about the path of two checks totaling
$2,500.</p>
<p>Mr. Sobolevsky's appeal alleges the government came after
him because it was trying to connect him with gasoline
bootlegging to evade excise taxes. That effort failed, the
appeal says. But then, says the appeal, Mr. Freshman agreed
to cooperate with the government to escape prosecution on
another matter. In recruiting Mr. Freshman, the government
was "extraordinarily intrusive and violated the defendant's
right to a confidential relationship between himself and his
accountant," the appeal says.</p>
<p>The Justice Department said it won't comment on the appeal
until next month.</p>
<p>BARGAINS ABROAD may prove costly for returning
Californians. Consultant Vertex Inc. says the state screens
Customs Service declarations completed by residents coming
home and asks them to pay a use tax on any goods brought in.</p>
<p>NEVER MIND. The IRS, in response to charges leveled by a
whistle-blower group, says it forgot to sign 31 internal
documents covering 10,700 tax assessments. The goof could
cost the government $22.5 million.</p>
<p>PINCER MOVEMENT: Mexico is the 12th country to agree to
simultaneous tax audits with the IRS, Research Institute of
America says. The countries will conduct separate
examinations but share results.</p>
<p>IT TAKES MORE than religious conviction to get a tax
exemption.</p>
<p>The Tax Court rules that vegetarian restaurants and
health-food stores run by Seventh-day Adventists shouldn't be
exempt from taxes even though they are dedicated to carrying
out the church's work. Upholding the IRS, the court says
Living Faith Inc., a not-for-profit corporation founded by
Adventists, is too commercial to pass muster under Section
501(c)(3) of the Tax Code as a tax-exempt organization
"operated exclusively for religious purposes."</p>
<p>The court didn't question the sincerity of the church's
beliefs on diet and health, nor did it take issue with Living
Faith's contention that it was furthering church doctrine.
The court noted that Living Faith provided free meals once a
month, passed out church literature and offerred vegetarian
cooking classes. But, observed the court, the stores also
competed with commercial firms, charging as much or more.</p>
<p>Living Faith's beliefs "are not enough" to overcome its
commercial nature, the court holds.</p>
<p>BRIEFS: Being Arty Aardvark has its perils. The Tax Court,
citing IRS regulations, says a partner whose name comes first
alphabetically is "tax matters partner" when none is
designated and all share equal stakes. . . . Striking out on
a balk? New York enforcers cite five concessionaires at two
baseball-card shows for failing to comply with the state's
sales-tax law.</p>
