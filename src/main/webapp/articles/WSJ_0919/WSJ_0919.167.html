	<p class="article-leader">American Stores Co., a leading food and drug retailer,
said it is exploring the sale of Acme Markets Inc., its
275-store East Coast subsidiary.
   Late yesterday, the Salt Lake City company announced that
its board had authorized management to seek buyers for the
Malvern, Pa., supermarket chain.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Sale of Acme would help reduce American Stores' debt,
which soared to $2.3 billion after its 1988 takeover of Lucky
Stores Inc.</p>
<p>Acme, which the parent said had sales of $3.3 billion last
year, has outlets in Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Delaware,
Maryland, New York and Virginia.</p>
<p>J. L. Scott, chief executive officer of American Stores,
said proceeds would be used to reduce debt and allow American
Stores to build stores and modernize others.</p>
<p>The company has agreed to sell its remaining Alpha Beta
stores in Southern California within five years to settle an
antitrust action brought by California.</p>
<p>Last month, the company also agreed to sell its Buttrey
food and drug division for about $184 million to an
investment group led by management of Buttrey and the
merchant banking firm of Freeman Spogli & Co.</p>
<p>American Stores said that it had retained Lehman Brothers
to solicit bids for Acme.</p>
