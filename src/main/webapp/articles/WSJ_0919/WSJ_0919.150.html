	<p class="article-leader">The diaper wars have entered a new phase.
   Procter & Gamble Co. is launching Pampers Phases, a
disposable with different absorbency and design features for
the four stages of a child's early years.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>For instance, the diaper for "crawlers" has wider tape
fasteners because babies old enough to crawl put more stress
on the tapes. The infant size has a longer back sheet,
because at that age, they spend more time lying down.</p>
<p>While P&G's two brands, Pampers and Luvs, have a combined
market share of about 51%, rival Kimberly-Clark Corp.'s
Huggies is the leading brand with 34% of the market. Pampers
is second with 27%, and Luvs is third with 24%.</p>
<p>P&G has been continually upgrading Pampers, which was the
leading brand with a hefty 59% of the market a decade ago.
"It's two brands against one, but in their heart of hearts,
they'd love to have Pampers number one again," says Hugh
Zurkuhlen of Salomon Brothers.</p>
<p>It's too soon to say if the new Phases will do the trick.
Some analysts note that P&G has simply given new names to
familiar "small," "medium" and "large" sizes. "It depends on
how you position it. If you just put it out there, no one
will notice," says Mr. Zurkuhlen.</p>
