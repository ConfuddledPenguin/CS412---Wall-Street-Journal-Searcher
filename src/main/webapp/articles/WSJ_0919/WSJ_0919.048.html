   Aren't Easily Produced</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>EMBARRASSING? Alarming? Whatever you call it, initial
results of a much-touted program to draw some of the best
students into manufacturing are revealing.</p>
<p>Two years ago, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology
and 11 major manufacturers began a five-year, $46 million
effort to educate a new generation of manufacturing leaders.
The first class of 20 Fellows just finished the two-year
program.</p>
<p>So where did they land? A startling 35% went with
consulting firms -- not manufacturers; McKinsey & Co. landed
three.</p>
<p>Money appears to be the principal factor. The median
starting salary for those who went with consultants was
$70,000, while for those opting for manufacturing concerns,
it was $55,000. Just nine of the students went with
sponsoring companies, including Digital Equipment (which
hired three) and Motorola (two).</p>
<p>"To some, this may be discouraging news," says Linda
Stantial, career-development director of MIT's Sloan School
of Management. She notes that several students who chose
consulting will deal with factory issues.</p>
<p>The results jolted the sponsors. Some of the companies
"think that if they're putting in this kind of money, they
should have some of these students," says Thomas W. Eagar, a
professor in the program. "But these aren't indentured
servants."</p>
<p>MIT has begun hammering the message that Fellows are
expected to join manufacturers. And future Fellows may not
get a free ride but a loan that wouldn't have to be repaid if
they join a manufacturer. Sponsoring companies are expected
to send as Fellows more of their own engineers, who likely
would return.</p>
<p>Among the students, many believe "manufacturers will have
to narrow the pay gap to entice them," says one Fellow. Ms.
Stantial contends manufacturers face a "tough challenge"
ahead to "potentially change their career paths, compensation
schemes and organization attitudes . . . their corporate
culture."</p>
<p>Eager to Boost Morale?</p>
<p>Just Spin the Wheel</p>
<p>MEDIATECH, a Chicago company that duplicates
videocassettes, has tried with mixed success the traditional
methods for motivating employees, including contests and
parties. Officials believe they have hit a winner for
improving morale: the corporate lottery.</p>
<p>Unlike in state lotteries, Mediatech's 350 employees don't
risk their own money. The company puts $250 weekly into the
prize pot. Each Monday, a wheel is spun to determine if there
will be a lottery that week. If the wheel stops on Lottery,
the drawing is at 4 p.m. Friday with payroll check numbers
used to pick winners; if No Lottery comes up, the money
accumulates until the next week.</p>
<p>Mediatech officials claim the 16-week-old lottery has
greatly improved morale and productivity. "Certainly,
attendance is better on Friday afternoons," says Sterling
"Red" Quinlan, a Mediatech vice president.</p>
<p>Retiree Benefit Cuts</p>
<p>Won't End Soon</p>
<p>RETIREES, take note. You haven't seen anything yet in the
rush by employers to shift more of their health-care cost
burden to retirees. An unpublished study by Hewitt Associates
suggests that over the next five years, a growing number of
companies plan to take far more serious actions to stem
mounting retiree health costs than steps taken in the past
two years.</p>
<p>By 1995, 62% of 463 large and medium-sized firms surveyed
by the Lincolnshire, Ill., benefits consulting firm say they
will "definitely consider" raising insurance-premium
contributions of retirees, and one in 20 will mull
eliminating the retiree medical plan altogether. During the
past two years, about 35% of the companies raised the premium
contribution, but few terminated plans altogether.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>                  Shifting the Burden</p>
<p>Percentage of employers saying they will "definitely
consider" these changes in retiree health benefits over the
next five years:</p>
<p>Boosting retiree contributions .................... 62%</p>
<p>Tying retiree contribution to length of service ... 39</p>
<p>Tightening benefits eligibility ................... 28</p>
<p>Decreasing benefit levels ......................... 21</p>
<p>Flat payment for retirees ......................... 13</p>
<p>Eliminating retiree medical plan ..................  5

<p>It Still Isn't Dad</p>
<p>At Home With Sick Kids</p>
<p>IT'S NO SECRET that when work-family conflicts arise,
working mothers shoulder most of the responsibilities. A
fresh Labor Department survey underscores just how much of
the burden working women continue to bear, despite all the
talk of changing gender roles in society.</p>
<p>During an average week last year, 6.6% of married women
employed full time missed work. That was considerably above
the 4% absence rate for men. The gap is much wider for
working couples with children under 17 years old. Among
working mothers with preschoolers, the rate was 11.5%, triple
the 3.8% rate for their spouses. For couples with children
aged 6 to 17, the rate was 6% for women, 3.7% for men.</p>
<p>The survey also indicates that when working women with
preschoolers miss work, the odds are nearly 2-to-1 that the
reason isn't their own illness. These mothers are most likely
to encounter scheduling problems with child-care
arrangements.</p>
<p>In contrast, when their spouses miss work, the odds are
6-to-4 that it is because they are ill and not because they
are staying home with a sick child.</p>
