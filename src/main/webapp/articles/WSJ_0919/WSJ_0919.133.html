	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- The bond market was rampant with rumors
yesterday as traders and investors tried to explain why the
federal funds rate suddenly plunged.
   The federal funds rate is the rate banks charge each other
for overnight loans and is often used by the Federal Reserve
to signal changes in monetary policy. The rate has hovered
around 8% for months, but yesterday fell as low as 6 1/4%. On
Monday the rate closed at 1%.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Many analysts said yesterday's decline doesn't signal that
the Fed is reducing short-term interest rates, but instead
reflects technical factors. Specifically, analysts said that
the falling federal funds rate is a sign that major
commercial banks are flush with cash and don't need to borrow
short-term funds as they approach the end of a two-week
settlement period.</p>
<p>In recent months, the federal funds rate has risen sharply
near the end of a settlement period as banks scrambled to
meet their reserve requirements by borrowing heavily.</p>
<p>"The banks have more reserves than they need," said Kevin
Flanagan, a money market economist at Dean Witter Reynolds
Inc. He said the banks borrowed earlier in the period in an
effort to avoid being squeezed again as they have been in the
past.</p>
<p>But there were rumors that the decline in the federal
funds rate reflects the inability of one or more big New York
banks to borrow in the fed markets as a result of perceptions
that banks are having credit problems. According to these
traders, some big New York banks are expected to borrow
needed funds at the Fed's discount window instead of through
the market.</p>
<p>"There was suddenly just no demand for federal funds,"
said one fed funds trader in New York. "It happened so
quickly. We may find out in a few days that something went
wrong, either a wire transfer problem or a major borrower was
pushed out of the market or maybe something else," he said.</p>
<p>In trading, bond prices ended little changed after a day
of seesaw trading. Bonds fell nearly 1/2 point, about $5 for
a bond with a $1,000 face amount, in early trading after the
government reported that the consumer price index rose 0.8%
in August. The CPI, a measure of inflation, "knocked the
market lower, and that set the tone for a lousy day," said
Robert Chandross, chief economist at Lloyds Bank.</p>
<p>A sharply higher trade deficit also hurt market sentiment.
The Commerce Department reported that the import-export gap
widened to a seasonally adjusted $9.33 billion in July from a
revised $5.34 billion in June.</p>
<p>In addition, traders said that a power outage at the
Chicago Board of Trade suspended dealings in the Treasury
bond futures pits and may have exacerbated the early losses.</p>
<p>The bond market retraced the losses when the federal funds
declined as dealers rushed to cover short-sale positions.
These dealers had sold borrowed securities earlier this week
in hopes that yesterday's inflation report would push prices
lower and they could buy back the securities at a lower price
and pocket the difference. After prices dropped sharply early
yesterday, dealers saw the softening federal funds rate as an
opportunity to close out their positions and take profits.</p>
<p>Municipal Bonds</p>
<p>It was a busy day in the tax-exempt market as more than
$900 million of new securities were offered.</p>
<p>But the avalanche of supply appeared to overwhelm demand
and pushed prices of tax-exempt issues as much as 1/4 point
lower.</p>
<p>Traders said that while retail buyers have been supporting
many of the new issues, institutional investors have been
reluctant to purchase securities in the primary market and
instead are scooping up bargains in the secondary market.</p>
<p>"They can sit back and buy {bonds} cheaper," on the
secondary market, said one trader. "They don't see any
upside" to the market, he said.</p>
<p>Weaker than expected demand forced underwriters at Dillon
Read & Co. to reprice and restructure a $200 million
Connecticut general obligation bond issue.</p>
<p>The repricing raised some yields by 10 basis points,
eliminated serial bonds due in 2007 and 2009 and created a
term bond due in 2010. Under the restructured terms, the
bonds were priced to yield between 6% for notes due in 1991
to 7.25% for bonds due in 2010.</p>
<p>Among other new issues, New York State Dormitory Authority
offered $314 million City University system consolidated
second general resolution revenue bonds. The securities were
priced to yield between 6.40% for notes due in 1992 to 8.05%
for bonds due in 2017.</p>
<p>Chase Securities Inc., a unit of Chase Manhattan Corp.,
was in the process of pricing $110 million of Vermont Housing
Finance Authority bonds. Pricing details weren't completed by
the end of the day.</p>
<p>Ahead on the calendar, the Port Authority of New York and
New Jersey will sell $100 million consolidated notes via
competitive bid at 11 a.m. EDT today.</p>
<p>Corporate Bonds</p>
<p>Rumors that Chase Manhattan Corp. was having problems
selling its commercial paper, shook the banking sector,
pushing up yields of many financial issues.</p>
<p>Although Chase denied it was having difficulty placing the
short-term corporate IOUs, yields on its bonds rose.</p>
<p>Corporate bond traders said Chase Manhattan's 10%
subordinated notes, maturing in 1999, were yielding 13.40%
yesterday, about 30 basis points wider than Monday.</p>
<p>Chase Manhattan bonds had tightened about 20 basis points
last week after the company reset the rate on $200 million of
subordinated notes at more than 13%. The bonds, however,
returned to their existing levels yesterday as a result of
continuing concerns about the bank's financial well-being,
traders said.</p>
<p>Those concerns as well as worries about the banking
industry in general depressed bonds of other financial
institutions.</p>
<p>Chemical Banking Corp.'s 9.75% subordinated capital notes,
due in 1999, were yielding 14.125%, about 20 basis points
wider than Monday.</p>
<p>In the broader corporate bond market, prices of high-grade
corporate issues were barely changed while junk bonds, or
high-risk, high-yield bonds, ended lower.</p>
<p>The junk bonds of Carter Hawley Hale Stores continued to
plunge. Like many retailers, Carter Hawley has been hurt by
reports that consumer spending is expected to be light this
Christmas.</p>
<p>Carter Hawley's 12 1/4% securities fell 6 3/4 points to 62
on the New York Stock Exchange while the company's 12.5%
securities fell six points to 52.</p>
<p>AmBase Corp.'s junk bonds, which had been trading in the
mid-90s a month ago, plunged 10 points to 40. Market
participants said that they knew of no news developments that
would account for the sharp decline.</p>
<p>But junk bonds of RJR Nabisco Inc. rose even as the
broader high-yield market posted losses of between 1/4 to 3/8
point. Most notably, RJR's 17% exchangeable pay-in-kind
debentures surged 1 3/8 point to 89 1/8 on the New York Stock
Exchange.The 17.375% convertible pay-in-kind debentures, due
in 2009, rose 7/8 to 112 7/8.</p>
<p>A spokesman for RJR Nabisco declined to comment on the
rise in either issue.</p>
<p>Treasury Securities</p>
<p>Treasurys ended unchanged after a day of seesaw trading.</p>
<p>The benchmark 30-year bond finished at a price of 96 23/32
to yield 9.06%, the same level as Monday. Two-year notes
ended unchanged at a price of 100 5/32 to yield 8.02%.</p>
<p>Treasury bill rates also were unchanged at Monday's
levels, with the discount rate on three-month bills ending at
7.38% and the rate on six-month bills ending at 7.29%.</p>
<p>Today, the focus of the market will likely turn to Fed
Chairman Alan Greenspan, who is scheduled to present the
central bank's economic outlook to Congress.</p>
<p>Investors and dealers will be listening closely for any
indication that the Fed is moving toward easing monetary
policy. Mr. Greenspan will begin speaking at 10 a.m. EDT.</p>
<p>Mortgage-Backed Securities</p>
<p>Mortgage-backed securities ended unchanged to slightly
lower after recouping most of their losses posted yesterday
morning on news of a rise in the core rate of consumer price
inflation.</p>
<p>In the secondary mortgage market, Government National
Mortgage Association's 9 1/2% issue for October delivery fell
1/32 at 98 3/8, Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp.'s 9 1/2%
Gold participation certificates were unchanged at 98 7/8, and
Federal National Mortgage Association's 9 1/2% securities
were flat at 98 21/32.</p>
<p>The mortgage-backed securities market showed little
response to the continuing sales from Resolution Trust Corp.
The thrift bailout agency reportedly sold more than $100
million of seasoned Ginnie Maes yesterday after unloading
nearly $200 million of seasoned Ginnie Maes and other
securities Monday.</p>
<p>In the primary market, a $330 million issue of Freddie Mac
Remic mortgage securities, collateralized with Freddie Mac 9%
securities, was priced by J.P. Morgan Securities Inc.</p>
<p>Also, a $75 million Alaska Housing Finance Corp.
collateralized mortgage obligation issue was offered by First
Boston Corp.</p>
<p>Foreign Bonds</p>
<p>The Japanese government bond market managed to end firmer
despite continued bearish factors. Traders said the
last-minute rise in Japanese bond prices reflected short-sale
covering.</p>
<p>In a short sale, dealers and professional traders sell
borrowed securities and later seek to make a profit by
replacing what was borrowed with cheaper securities.
Essentially, these dealers are betting that prices will fall.</p>
<p>Japan's benchmark No. 119 10-year bond ended at 81.22, up
0.05 points, to yield 8.55%. (When calculated using the
semiannual compound method, the yield on the No. 119 ended at
7.79%, according to Salomon Brothers Inc.)</p>
<p>Traders, however, said widespread bearish sentiment
remains as key interest rates continue to rise. The yield on
Euroyen interest rates futures contracts ended at 8.82%
yesterday, up from 8.78% the day before. The long-term prime
rate is expected to be boosted for the third month in a row,
to almost 9% for October from 8.5% for September.</p>
