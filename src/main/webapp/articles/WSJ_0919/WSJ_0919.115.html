	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Norman Lear's ACT III Communications Inc. is
scaling back some of its ambitious plans to become a
diversified media company, folding some properties and
seeking buyers for others.
   According to company officials, ACT III has quietly folded
two of its trade magazines and laid off 19 people at its ACT
III Publishing unit. The subscription lists of the two
publications have been sold to PSN Publications Inc., a unit
of United Newspapers PLC.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>ACT III officials said that Mr. Lear, who owns 80% of ACT
III, is preparing to sell the publishing unit and
significantly restructure his company. ACT III, based in Los
Angeles, owns TV stations, movie theaters, and trade
magazines.</p>
<p>Mr. Lear couldn't be reached for comment, and Robert C.
Gardner, ACT III Publishing's chief operating officer, said
"we are downsizing ACT III publishing. It's clear ACT III
will not be an aggressive, acquisition-minded company in the
future." Individuals close to the company said Mr. Lear wants
to eliminate unprofitable areas, reduce the size of the
company, which grew quickly in the late 1980s, and return to
television production.</p>
<p>Mr. Lear formed ACT III Communications in 1985 after
selling his television operation to Coca-Cola Co. for $485
million.</p>
<p>The two magazines that will be closed are Corporate Video
Decisions and BME's Television Engineering. ACT III continues
to publish an array of other music, television, and
media-related trade magazines.</p>
<p>Speculation has grown in recent weeks that ACT III would
sell two of its music trade magazines, Mix and Electronic
Musician, to Affiliated Publications Inc. An Affiliated
Publications' spokesman said the company would not comment.</p>
<p>The slashing of the publishing unit follows the recent
sudden resignations of Thomas B. McGrath, ACT III president
and chief operating officer, and Paul David Schaeffer,
president of ACT III Publishing. Company executives said
Messrs. McGrath and Schaeffer were blamed by Mr. Lear for
spending too much on acquiring new properties and hiring the
wrong people to operate them.</p>
<p>Mr. Lear would sell the entire company if the price was
right, but it's a poor time to sell TV stations, movie
theaters, or trade magazines, according to the company
officials. Paramount Communications Corp. recently looked
closely at the stations, but backed away.</p>
<p>Mr. Lear is currently producing a new sitcom for CBS Inc.</p>
