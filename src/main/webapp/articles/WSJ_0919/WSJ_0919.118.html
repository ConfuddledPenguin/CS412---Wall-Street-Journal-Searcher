	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- A top R.H. Macy & Co. executive said the
retailer has drafted plans to buy back sizable amounts of its
junk bonds, which have sunk in recent weeks.
   A big bond buy-back, at a hefty discount from face value,
could significantly cut Macy's $600 million annual cash
interest bill on its $5.8 billion in debt. Likely sources of
money for an open-market bond repurchase are bank loans and
the possible sale of as much as a 20% equity stake in Macy.
If the retailer carries out its plans, that will almost
certainly be seen as upbeat news in the financial community.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Bond analysts and traders have grown increasingly worried
about Macy's financial health in the past month, amid signs
that U.S. retail sales are slumping. The company's 14.5%
bonds of 1998 currently trade at 54 cents on the dollar, and
lion annual cash interest bill on its $5.8 billion in debt.
Likely sources of money for an open-market bond repurchase
are bank loans and the possible sale of as much as a 20%
equity stake in Macy. If the retailer carries out its plans,
that will almost certainly be seen as upbeat news in the
other Macy issues are even lower.</p>
<p>Macy executive vice president Myron Ullman said in an
interview that the company is looking at "five or six"
different ways to finance a big bond repurchase. Mr. Ullman
said Macy directors, at a board meeting Monday, were shown an
extensive roadmap for how the company could buy large amounts
of its bonds.</p>
<p>Macy has about $1.6 billion face value of junk bonds
outstanding. They were issued soon after the retailer was
taken private in a 1986 leveraged buy-out.</p>
<p>This summer, Macy sold a token 1% equity stake to a real
estate developer for $15 million. Macy used part of the
proceeds to retire $45 million face value of its 16.5%
discount bonds of 2006, which traded then at about 20 cents
on the dollar, Mr. Ullman said. Macy also bought about $5
million of its 14.5% bonds of 2001, which were trading at
about 45 cents on the dollar.</p>
<p>Macy wants to retire more junk bonds the same way, Mr.
Ullman said. "This is a great opportunity," he asserted. "We
never dreamed we would have the opportunity to buy bonds at
such a discount."</p>
<p>Macy, though, could face a tough time lining up financing.
The company's two lead banks, Manufacturers Hanover Corp. and
Bankers Trust New York Corp., recently lent money for a
comparable bond-repurchase program by RJR Nabisco Inc., but
did so only after long negotiations and the payment of
unusually high loan fees.</p>
<p>Macy's other likely source of cash is a sizable equity
infusion. The company's owners include such deep-pocketed
companies and individuals as General Electric Co., with a
20.2% stake; Loews Corp., with a 12.1% stake; Mutual Shares
Corp., with a 12.1% stake, and developer Alfred Taubman, with
a 4.1% stake.</p>
<p>Mr. Ullman reaffirmed that Macy would consider selling a
20% stake in the company for $300 million. That price -- five
times what Macy's original equity investors paid in 1986 --
is in line with the company's asking price in previous talks
with potential buyers. It is unclear, though, whether a new
or existing investor would pay that much.</p>
<p>Last week, several junk-bond analysts cut their estimates
of operating profit for Macy's Christmas quarter or for the
company's fiscal year ended next July 31. One of them,
Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette Securities Corp. analyst Ray
Garea, cited "the softening retail environment."</p>
<p>Even though Macy's bonds are as cheap as ever, Mr. Garea
said, his short-term outlook for the company has switched to
"negative" from neutral. Similarly, J.P. Morgan & Co. analyst
Michael Cha said he is lowering his "worst-case" estimate of
Macy's Christmas quarter operating profit by more than 10%.</p>
<p>As recently as last July, Macy's internal forecasts called
for 2% year-to-year growth in same-store sales for the six
months ending Jan. 31. But because of signs that retail sales
are slowing, Mr. Ullman said, Macy now expects flat
same-store sales in the period. Even that forecast may be
optimistic, he conceded.</p>
<p>Mr. Ullman reiterated Macy's earlier forecast that
operating profit -- or profit before interest, taxes,
depreciation and amortization -- would total $654 million for
the six months ending next Jan. 31. He acknowledged that many
analysts regard that target as unachievable in the current
retailing slump.</p>
<p>"Before the Kuwait invasion and the recession in the U.S.,
Macy was on target for a profit recovery," said Barrie
Littel, an analyst at First Boston Corp. "Now anyone
realistic has to trim their numbers."</p>
<p>Last year, Macy turned in a disappointing $416 million
operating profit for the six months ended Jan. 31.</p>
<p>Even if the Christmas selling season isn't much better
than last year's, Mr. Ullman said, Macy is controlling its
inventory more tightly and should show improved profit
margins. He also said Macy's reduced buying of merchandise is
leaving it with plenty of unused bank credit, which helps
build confidence among shippers.</p>
