	<p class="article-leader">DETROIT -- General Motors Corp.'s new three-year agreement
with the UAW amounts to a massive golden handshake for its
blue-collar workers under which the company will pay $4
billion for the right to shrink its U.S. work force.
   Details of the proposed pact, which was overwhelmingly
approved yesterday by top UAW leaders, show an elaborate web
of provisions aimed at cutting GM's active U.S. blue-collar
work force from its current level of 280,000 people.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Among the pact's features: "pre-retirement leaves" that
allow older workers to leave their jobs at 85% of full-time
pay; a reduction in the minimum early-retirement age to 50
years from 55 years, richer bonuses for those who agree to
simply quit GM.</p>
<p>In addition, annual pensions for workers under 62 years
old who retire with 30 years' seniority will rise 20% to
$21,600 a year in 1992 from $18,000 a year now. Regular
pension benefits will rise 17% under the proposed pact.
Lump-sum buy-out payments offered to younger workers who want
to quit GM will be sweetened to a maximum $72,000 from
$65,000 now.</p>
<p>All these measures amount to a program aimed at
encouraging older workers to leave, analysts said.</p>
<p>"We can expect a considerably smaller work force at GM in
1993," said Harley Shaiken, a labor expert at the University
of California at San Diego. "There's no question but that the
pensions increase was one more mechanism to help shrink the
work force."</p>
<p>That shrinkage could be substantial. While precise figures
weren't available yesterday, the average GM worker is 44
years old -- just six years short of the new early-retirement
age. By 1995, normal attrition could cut GM's active U.S.
labor force to less than 200,000 workers from about 280,000
now, according to one internal estimate.</p>
<p>But the new contract could accelerate the normal rate of
attrition at GM. And it could benefit the company, as younger
workers now on lay-off move into jobs vacated by older
employees who retire, or take sweetened buy-out packages to
simply quit.</p>
<p>And while GM will pay a high price for gains in efficiency
related to a smaller work force, the proposed contract leaves
the company considerable flexibility.</p>
<p>Workers who are currently laid off will get an additional
financial cushion -- but not a guarantee of jobs. GM will
guarantee 52 weeks of pay at 95% of weekly earnings for
workers with less than 10 years' seniority. Those workers get
less than six months of coverage now. Workers with more than
10 years' seniority will get up to three years of pay at 95%
of their base earnings, compared with two years or less now.</p>
<p>GM can still idle plants if sales fall drastically. The
catch: It must pay full wages and benefits to workers who are
laid off for more than 36 weeks over the next three years.
Workers in this situation would be placed in a "jobs bank,"
and be given priority for openings elsewhere in GM's U.S.
operations. However, these workers also could be offered
buy-outs, or early-retirement deals that are now about 17%
richer than in the past.</p>
<p>UAW officials said yesterday that the agreement requires
GM to discuss any proposed plant closing with the union. And
they said the agreement includes a "moratorium" on plant
closings similar to one included in the last pact.</p>
<p>But Stephen P. Yokich, the union's top GM bargainer,
declined to say specifically yesterday whether the moratorium
prohibits GM from closing more plants by classifying them as
"indefinitely idled" due to market conditions. GM used this
loophole to close four U.S. car factories during the past
three years. Company officials said they expect GM will go
ahead with previously announced plans to close two truck
plants between now and the end of 1993.</p>
<p>To be sure, there are some measures that will protect UAW
jobs, and benefit those who want to stay at GM. Base wages
will rise 3% this year, with 3% lump sum payments in the next
two years.</p>
<p>The agreement also gives the union more power to block the
company from giving work to outside suppliers, a practice
called "outsourcing." Under the pact, GM will give the union
detailed information about the comparative costs of doing the
work in-house or sending it to an outside supplier. The
agreement even allows the union to bid on work now being done
by outside suppliers.</p>
<p>Workers affected by outsourcing also will have the right
to take the issue to an arbitrator. GM and union officials
said the new process won't cause the company to take longer
to get products to the market.</p>
<p>Overall, however, the union's apparent willingness to
accept income guarantees and better retirement packages in
lieu of jobs reflects a growing realism among UAW officials
as the U.S. auto industry braces for tough economic times and
intense competition.</p>
<p>"There's only one form of job security; and that's to
build a good product that people will buy," said George
Sailer, who represents some 4,300 UAW members at a GM engine
parts plant in Toledo, Ohio.</p>
<p>Now that Mr. Sailer and about 400 other UAW leaders from
GM factories around the nation have approved the tentative
pact, the package will go to GM's UAW membership, who will
vote on it by Sept. 30.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>                 Pathways Out of GM</p>
<p>The proposed UAW-GM contract expands and sweetens the
options for workers who want to leave GM, and gives a bigger
cushion to those who lose their jobs:</p>
<p>"Pre-retirement Leaves" -- Older workers can go on "leave"
at 85% of regular pay until eligible for retirement.</p>
<p>30-and-Out -- Annual pensions for workers under age 62 who
retire with 30 years seniority will rise 20% by 1992 to
$21,600 from $18,000 now. Monthly benefits for those retiring
at 62 or older will rise 16-17% over three years.</p>
<p>Early retirement -- Benefits for those with less than 30
years on the job who want to retire rise by 17%. Minimum
early retirement age drops.</p>
<p>Voluntary Termination of Employment Program -- Workers too
young to retire will get an additional $3,000 to $7,000 plus
six months of health benefits to leave GM.</p>
<p>Jobs Bank -- Workers laid off for more than 36 weeks
during the new three-year pact get full pay and benefits.</p>
<p>Supplemental Unemployment Benefits -- Temporarily laid off
workers with less than 10 years seniority get 52 weeks at 95%
pay, up from 26 weeks. Laid-off workers with longer seniority
get up to three years of benefits, instead of two.</p>
