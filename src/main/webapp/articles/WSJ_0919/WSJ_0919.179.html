	<p class="article-leader">THE U.S. BOOSTED its estimate of Iraqi troop strength in
and around Kuwait.
   The Pentagon said Baghdad has 360,000 troops and 2,800
tanks in Kuwait and nearby areas of Iraq, showing a steady
increase, but the forces still appear to be in a defensive
position. Meanwhile, Washington reproached Jordan for playing
host to a meeting of Arab radicals, and Bush said Iraq's
military mustn't benefit from any humanitarian aid shipments.
In Paris, nine European nations demanded that the U.N. trade
embargo on Iraq be extended to the air as well as the sea.</p>

<p>THE PENTAGON SAID it will eliminate or reduce operations
at 150 foreign sites.</p>
<p>The cutbacks at the mostly small foreign facilities in 10
nations, mainly in Europe, are designed to carry out pledges
to shrink the size of the armed forces in response to budget
cuts, and to meet force reductions that will be required in
Europe under the conventional arms control treaty expected to
be signed in November. Defense officials said the closings,
to take place over several years, aren't linked to the U.S.
troop buildup in Saudi Arabia.</p>
<p>The announcement is certain to be welcomed in Moscow,
which is pulling all its troops out of Europe and had pressed
the U.S. to state its intentions.</p>

<p>South Africa said it will charge Winnie Mandela, wife of
African National Congress leader Nelson Mandela, with

abduction and beating of four young men, one of whom was
found dead. Her bodyguard was sentenced to death in the case;
Mrs. Mandela has denied wrongdoing.</p>
<p>The ANC began an emergency meeting on township wars that
have killed 760 people in five weeks. The anti-apartheid
group has accused security forces of waging war on its people

fighting.</p>

economic programs that had been proposed in the past week.</p>
<p>Solzhenitsyn urged a populist revival of democracy and

<p>Atlanta was awarded the 1996 Summer Games by the
International Olympic Committee, a move that could generate

have to spend more than $400 million to construct Olympic
facilities.</p>

<p>The EPA said nine major companies have agreed to

<p>Shamir contended that the U.S. isn't doing enough to

groups and women's rights advocates.</p>

<p>The House voted to reduce spending for the Strategic
Defense Initiative to $2.3 billion in fiscal 1991 -- the

Bush administration's request for the program.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>The U.S. extended for another year a longstanding trade
embargo against Vietnam, a Treasury Department spokesman
said. The action was expected to disappoint Hanoi officials,
who had been hoping that a new dialogue with the U.S. and
progress toward peace in Cambodia would prompt Washington to
lift the embargo.</p>

war.</p>
