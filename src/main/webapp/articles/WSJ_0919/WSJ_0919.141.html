	<p class="article-leader">Bertelsmann AG said it sold 49% of its book club in Italy
to publishers Rizzoli-Corriere della Sera Editori. Terms of
the transaction weren't disclosed.
   The West German publishing company said it could expand
the market share for Euroclubs Italia through Rizzoli's
influence in Italy.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Bertelsmann, one of the world's largest operators of book
clubs, said its Euroclubs Italia book club had 700,000
members in 1989 with sales of 75 million German marks ($48.5
million). Walter Gerstgrasser, Bertelsmann managing board
member, said the company will retain 51% of the book club as
well as its current management.</p>
<p>Last year, Rizzoli had the equivalent of 3 billion marks
in sales and controls about one-fourth of the Italian book
market, according to Bertelsmann.</p>
<p>A spokesman for Bertelsmann said the company has had "good
experience" with partnerships established with other book
clubs in France and Britain.</p>
