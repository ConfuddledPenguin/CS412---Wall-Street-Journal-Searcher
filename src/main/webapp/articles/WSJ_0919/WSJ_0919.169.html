	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- MCI Communications Corp. said it agreed to
purchase OverSeas Telecommunications Inc., an international
satellite and fiber-optic concern. Terms weren't disclosed.
   The move is part of MCI's continuing effort to boost its
international voice, data and video communications business.
Since 1982, MCI has sought to expand its global reach
primarily through acquisitions.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The long-distance telecommunications concern bought
Western Union International Inc. in 1982; RCA Global
Communications Inc., a high-speed data and telex concern, in
1987; and a 25% stake in Infonet Services Corp., an
international dataswitching network and computing-services
concern, last January.</p>
<p>Privately held OTI, based in Alexandria, Va., provides
digital communications services and operates 24 earth
stations world-wide, and thus will give MCI a larger presence
in 27 countries. OTI specializes in small customer premises
satellite services between the U.S. and Latin America. It
also offers satellite earth-station project management,
overseas private-line channels and international video
services.</p>
<p>Annual revenue for OTI wasn't available.</p>
<p>Robert B. Morris III, a telecommunications analyst with
Goldman, Sachs & Co., said the acquisition is important to
MCI because the company holds such a small share of the
global marketplace and is "virtually unknown" outside the
U.S. "By purchasing other entities, MCI will raise its global
presence and expand its market," he said.</p>
<p>MCI's current share of the international telephone market
ranges between 12% and 13%, while American Telephone &
Telegraph Co. dominates with an estimated 80% to 85% share.</p>
<p>OTI will give MCI a stronger foothold in such markets as
West Germany, France, Spain, Singapore, Japan, Australia,
Mexico, Argentina and Brazil.</p>
