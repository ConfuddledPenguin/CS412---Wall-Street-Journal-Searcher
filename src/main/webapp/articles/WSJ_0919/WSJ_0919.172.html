   Listen to Police, Not Gun Lobby</h3>

	<p class="article-leader">Your Aug. 21 editorial "The Jogger and Gun Control"
displayed a surprising ignorance of not only the raging gun
violence gripping our nation, but also of remedies urged by
law enforcement.
   Law enforcement does not treat felons "gingerly," as you
implied, but police believe we need laws to prevent crime,
not simply take action after the crime. Every major
law-enforcement organization in America -- including the
Fraternal Order of Police, the International Association of
Chiefs of Police, the National Sheriffs' Association and the
National Association of Police Organizations -- is urging
Congress to enact two federal gun statutes.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Congress is considering legislation to stop the sale of
assault weapons such as the AK-47 used in the Stockton
massacre and the Uzi assault pistol, favored by drug
traffickers. Assault weapons are like armor-piercing
ammunition, machine guns and undetectable plastic handguns.
They aren't used by legitimate sportsmen, and shouldn't be on
the civilian market.</p>
<p>Such public-safety measures enjoy broad bipartisan support
in Congress. More and more politicians are beginning to
listen to those to whom we entrust our public safety -- the
police -- and not the gun lobby.</p>

<p>Your editorial is demagogic nonsense. What does this poor
woman's experience have to do with gun control? If someone
dies from a heroin overdose, are we to conclude that there
should not be laws against selling crack cocaine? A barbaric
act was committed with a pipe, a rock and a stick, but not
all barbaric acts are committed with those weapons. In fact,
each year in the U.S. about 9,200 murders -- nearly half of
all murders -- are committed with handguns, while only 6% of
all murders are committed with blunt instruments (including
pipes and rocks) and 6% with personal weapons (fists, feet
and teeth).</p>
<p>Your editorial has waved a bloody shirt to inspire fear
and fury and to turn those emotions subtly against an
undeserving target. As ridiculous as it seems once exposed,
it actually attempted to blame gun-control advocates for the
attack on the jogger. The editorial's implication is that
gun-control advocates are somehow blocking more efficacious
anti-crime measures. Notwithstanding whatever stereotype
exists in your imagination, proponents of more rigorous gun
control (who today include the organized law-enforcement
community) often favor many other public-safety measures. One
can just as easily favor more rigorous gun control and more
stringent sentencing of violent juveniles as one can favor
prosecuting those who sell heroin and those who sell crack
cocaine.</p>

<p>Your editorial, in mentioning the verdict in the trial of
Washington Mayor Marion Barry, condoned what you perceived as
the jury's decision to craft a "rough justice" by not
"pil{ing} on" convictions in its verdict. You went on to laud
this outcome as a "common-sense" effort on the jury's part to
keep Mr. Barry from running for re-election and stop him from
claiming vindication.</p>
<p>I do not share your implicit view that these jurors did
anything except their duty, which was to hear the evidence,
determine the facts, and apply those facts to the law as
instructed by the court. By suggesting that they crafted a
rough justice based (at least in part) on political factors,
you are necessarily assuming that they reached their verdict
in dereliction of their obligations as jurors.</p>
<p>More distressing than your interpretation of the verdict
is your approval of it based on that interpretation. If you
are correct in your view that the jury had a political
agenda, then the judicial system has broken down and Mr.
Barry has not received a fair trial. If the evidence adduced
at trial proved Mr. Barry's guilt beyond a reasonable doubt
on more than one count in the indictment, he should have been
convicted on all of those counts. Conversely, he should not
have been convicted of any counts that were not borne out by
the facts. No other result comports with our Constitution or
the principles of modern democracy.</p>
<p>I recognize that sentences do not always reflect common
sense, and that they do not always seem just. This may be
acutely true when trials involve public figures whose actions
are not only criminal but also offend their public trust.
However, if we are unsatisfied with the sentences that accord
with the facts and the law as it is written, we must change
the law itself. We can fashion the law to reflect common
sense. But we cannot rely on an unspoken understanding that
jurors may abandon a court's instructions in favor of their
political instincts whenever they perceive a need for "rough
justice." Rough justice is not a high enough ideal for the
American judicial system.</p>

<p>Your editorial should be made mandatory reading for all
high-school students. They are now the only ones who can stop
the rampage of criminal warriors, on the streets and in
government.</p>
<p>Our sick society has reaffirmed that crime, indeed, does
pay. Until "We the People" start pushing for crime control,
something the National Rifle Association has supported since
its birth, we will have to live and die with the reality that
criminals control our lives and destinies.</p>

<p>You are certainly right that there is no connection
between the jogger case and gun-control laws, so why did you
try to make one?</p>
<p>I haven't heard or seen any gun-control arguments that
claim guns to be the only tools of violence, nor have I seen
or heard any argument that guns are "the {only} key to the
crime problem" -- with one exception: The National Rifle
Association does claim that gun-control advocates say that,
but they don't. Nor is there any claim that "the crime
problem can be {totally} solved" by such laws.</p>
<p>Guns are often related to violence, but violence is quite
possible without guns. You are right.</p>
