	<p class="article-leader">OCONOMOWOC, Wis. -- Stokely USA Inc. said it expects net
income for its second quarter ending Sept. 30 will fall by
half, because of lower prices for its canned and frozen
vegetables.
   The company, which processes and markets vegetables,
fruits and juices under its own brand and for private-label
venders, also said it expects sales to drop about 10%, in
part because it opted for a "nonaggressive" sales policy
earlier this year.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>In the year-ago second quarter, Stokely had earnings of
$3.2 million, or 38 cents a share, on sales of $60 million.</p>
<p>The company said prices for its products declined earlier
this year, based on "buyer expectations of larger-than-normal
supplies being produced." Stokely's own assessment was that
poor planting and growing conditions this spring made those
projections premature, and so the company didn't cut prices
to get contracts from some canning accounts. "We have a
number of customers we have to service on a twelve-month
basis," said a spokesman. "If we think we're going to have
less product available," he said, the company is disinclined
to engage in price cutting to get additional contracts.</p>
<p>"The outlook for supply and pricing still remains
uncertain," said Chairman Joseph B. Weix. A spokesman said
the industry is "not looking at an oversupply situation,"
citing among other things the "possibility of significant
demand increases related to European crop failures and to our
military buildup in the Mideast," factors which might boost
currently depressed margins. The "disappointing" projected
results, Mr. Weix said, thus "are not necessarily indicative
of results for the balance of the fiscal year."</p>
<p>In national over-the-counter trading yesterday, Stokely
shares fell $3.125, to close at $13.</p>
