	<p class="article-leader">After years of making monthly mortgage payments to the
bank, some elderly homeowners are getting the bank to pay
them by taking out a "reverse mortgage."
   A reverse mortgage is a loan, based on the equity a
homeowner has accumulated, that can be disbursed in monthly
installments over a period of years. Terms vary, but the
amount of the installments generally depend on the borrower's
age, life expectancy and the amount of equity in the home.
And in most cases, there are no interest or principal
payments as long as the borrower is living in the home.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Up to now, finding a reverse mortgage hasn't been easy,
because only a few lenders offer them, but interest is
growing. A provision in pending legislation would
significantly expand a Federal Housing Administration program
that promotes reverse mortgages by insuring lenders against
possible losses.</p>
<p>"For a lot of people, home equity is half of their net
worth," says Edward D. McCarthy, a financial planner with
Goluses & Co. in Providence, R.I. "You try not to use it, but
the reality is that most of us are going to have to tap it
somehow."</p>
<p>Many retirees sell their homes and move, either to smaller
quarters nearby or to a new community. But others want to
stay where they are, if they can afford to. Unlike a home
equity loan or line of credit, there's no income requirement
for a reverse mortgage, which makes it attractive to
retirees.</p>
<p>Reverse mortgages aren't for everyone, however. Costs can
be high, and there's often no house to pass on to heirs at
the end. The lender usually gets most, or all, of any capital
appreciation after the reverse mortgage is taken out. What's
more, if the borrower has to move into a nursing home after a
few years, the loan will have to be repaid, usually forcing
the sale of the home.</p>
<p>"People should look at the different options they have
first," says Ken Scholen, director of the National Center for
Home Equity Conversion. "A lot of people could solve their
financial problems another way."</p>
<p>For the elderly who have trouble paying property taxes,
for instance, many states have tax-deferral programs. There
also are low-cost or even no-cost home-improvement loans
available to the elderly through various government agencies.
Indeed, the federally insured reverse mortgage program
requires that applicants get counseling from a third party,
usually a non-profit agency.</p>
<p>Although reverse mortgages have been around for nearly a
decade, many lenders have been reluctant to take the chance
that borrowers will outlive the equity in their homes. The
federal program provides insurance against declining property
values and the possibility that a long-lived borrower will
get payments in excess of the resale value of the home.</p>
<p>That program, which is operating through 50 lenders in 34
states, authorizes a total of just 2,500 reverse mortgages.
But a provision in legislation passed by both the House and
the Senate and awaiting action by a conference committee
would expand the program tenfold.</p>
<p>In addition, three self-insured private lenders offer
reverse mortgages in a total of 15 states. Another two dozen
or so lenders around the country offer "term" loans, which
require repayment after a specific period of time -- usually
10 years. The federally insured program sets maximum equity
amounts, which vary by region. Many private lenders permit
borrowers to mortgage the full value of their homes. Reverse
mortgages also come with both adjustable and fixed interest
rates.</p>
<p>"It's like comparing apples and oranges and grapefruits,"
says Bronwyn Belling, a housing specialist with the American
Association of Retired Persons. "They're all structured
differently."</p>
<p>Like any other refinancing, there are closing costs for
such things as title searches and recording of documents.
Usually, there's an origination fee, calculated as a
percentage of the loan or the value of the house. There is
also an insurance premium, when the loan is insured, and
sometimes a monthly servicing fee. Although most if not all
the costs can be financed as part of the loan, they are added
to the balance of the loan. If the borrower dies or decides
to move after just a few years, the loan could be very
expensive.</p>
<p>Still, demand for reverse mortgages is huge, says Ms.
Belling. She says the association gets at least 20 to 30
calls a day about reverse mortgages and has sent out nearly
100,000 copies of a 47-page guide to home-equity conversion
written by Mr. Scholen.</p>
<p>Financial professionals say the ideal candidates for a
reverse mortgage are at least in their mid-seventies, and
physically able to remain in their homes for a number of
years. The first mortgage should be paid off, or have very
little remaining.</p>
<p>"The older you are, the more money you're going to get,"
says Marguerite Quis, a vice president at Interchange State
Bank in Saddle Brook, N.J., one of the FHA-insured lenders.
Payments under a typical federally insured loan, for
instance, would be $272 a month for a 70-year-old with a home
valued at $100,000. An 85-year-old getting a reverse mortgage
on the same home would get $599 a month. Ms. Quis says one of
Interchange's borrowers, a 97-year-old widow, is getting
$2,700 a month.</p>
<p>While reverse mortgages are designed primarily for elderly
retirees, others have used them, too. James Burke, chairman
of American Homestead Mortgage Inc. in Mount Laurel, N.J.,
one of the private insurers, says one borrower used a reverse
mortgage to finance her grandchild's college education. Mr.
Scholen of the National Center for Home Equity Conversion
says a woman in her mid-30s used proceeds of a reverse
mortgage to be able to stay at home for a few years with her
first child.</p>
<p>Not all retirees want to stay in their homes. "If it were
me, I'd rather sell my house and move to an apartment," says
William J. Ruckstuhl, associate professor of finance at
American College in Bryn Mawr, Pa., who's 55 years old. "Who
wants to mow the lawn and haul the trash?"</p>
