	<p class="article-leader">We have come across a nice little case study in the
difference between the way the public sector and private
sector might approach a similar problem. The postmaster in
Kansas City last month recommended that local patrons forgo
red and green envelopes with their Christmas cards this year.
He says the automatic-sorting machines that "read" addresses
can't handle color. But the Postal Service offered to print
address labels for free, because it turns out the machines
can't read poor handwriting, either. You can't blame the U.S.
Mail for trying to speed things up but you have to think that
a private operator would find ways to exploit the festive
spirit rather than dampen it. The card makers are happy
enough to oblige the jolly buyer of their wares.</p>
