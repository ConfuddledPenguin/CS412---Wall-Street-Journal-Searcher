	<p class="article-leader">A New York investor group led by Douglas A. Kass boosted
its stake in H.H. Robertson Co. to 18.8% and said it will
launch a proxy battle to fight management's efforts to merge
with another construction firm.
   In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission
the group said that it will solicit proxies for an upcoming
special shareholder's meeting. At the meeting, holders will
vote on the company's proposed $150 million cash and stock
buy-out of Ceco Industries, Inc., of Oakbrook Terrace, Ill.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Mr. Kass couldn't be reached for comment.</p>
<p>After the buy-out, Robertson's shares outstanding would
double between 13.5 million and 14 million. It would give 25%
of the stock to Ceco and another 25% to Swiss investment
company Frontera S.A. which agreed to invest $40 million to
help fund the cash portion of the buy-out in exchange for
25%, or between 3.3 million and 4 million shares of
Roberston.</p>
<p>Analysts now believe the Kass group is trying to stave off
the merger to generate buyer interest in Robertson.</p>
<p>First City Financial Corp., a concern controlled by the
Belzberg family with a 25% stake in Robertson, agreed to
support the buy-out.</p>
<p>In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange,
Robertson closed unchanged at $8.</p>
