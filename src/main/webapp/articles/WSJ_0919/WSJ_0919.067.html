	<p class="article-leader">MIAMI -- General Development Corp. said it reached a new
plea-bargain agreement with the government involving an
alleged conspiracy to defraud thousands of home buyers.
   The new agreement between the beleaguered real estate
developer and U.S. Attorney Dexter Lehtinen calls for General
Development to make restitution to home buyers of as much as
$160 million over 25 years.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The company's original plea bargain, which was rejected by
U.S. District Judge Lenore Nesbitt in July, had called for
General Development to make restitution estimated at $80
million to $100 million. Judge Nesbitt said the first
agreement "didn't give her enough flexibility to determine an
appropriate sentence in light of the scope and severity of
the charges."</p>
<p>The new agreement, according to a company spokeswoman,
calls for General Development to plead guilty to one count of
the original 16-count indictment against the company. That
count alleges that the company conspired to violate a federal
mail-fraud statute in connection with the sale of homes.</p>
<p>In March, the U.S. attorney unsealed a 16-count indictment
against General Development and its financing unit, GDV
Financial Corp. The indictment, which culminated a two-year
grand jury investigation, alleged that the company had
schemed to sell its Florida homes, primarily to out-of-state
buyers unfamiliar with market conditions, at grossly inflated
prices based on improper appraisals.</p>
<p>Prosecutors said 9,600 to 10,000 home buyers were
affected. The company's appraisals were based on what
prosecutors say were other overpriced General Development
homes -- not properties in the community at large -- and thus
exceeded fair-market value, prosecutors said.</p>
<p>General Development, which filed for bankruptcy-law
protection in April, said the new agreement will be filed
today with the U.S. District Court and the U.S. Bankruptcy
Court in Miami.</p>
