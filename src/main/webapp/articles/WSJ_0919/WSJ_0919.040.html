	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- McGraw-Hill Inc.'s F.W. Dodge division and
Publications du Moniteur, a subsidiary of CEP Communications
S.A., Paris, agreed to launch a service to supply information
on European construction.
   The new Pan European Construction Service will provide
detailed printed information on all major new construction
projects in Europe that construction and building-products
companies bid on, a spokesman for Dodge said. The service
will link seven major European providers of
construction-project news.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Start-up costs will be minimal, the spokesman said,
because the two services must only reroute their current flow
of information to subscribers in different countries. The new
service is expected to be available to an unspecified number
of subscribers by the fall of 1991. Subscribers will pay $500
to $50,000 annually for the service, he said.</p>
<p>Through F.W. Dodge, McGraw-Hill is a major provider of
construction-project news in the U.S. Its Dodge Europe
division has similar activities in Europe.</p>
<p>Publications du Moniteur's weekly Le Moniteur is a leading
European construction-project publication in France and Spain
with a circulation of 75,000, according to McGraw-Hill.</p>
