	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Salomon Brothers is putting out the word: "Now
is the time to buy supermarket stocks."
   Salomon's thinking, and that of Wall Street generally, is
that even in a recession, people keep on eating. But this
time the stocks aren't cheap. Going into the early-80s
recession, shares of the major supermarket chains traded at
about eight times earnings. Now they trade at about 19 times
the past year's per-share earnings, meaning that the market
is betting on growth even as a recession looms.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>And as anyone who shops for groceries knows, the
supermarket of today doesn't resemble the one of 10 years ago
-- and therein lies a reason for investors to be wary.</p>
<p>What's on the shelves nowadays isn't as indispensable as
in the past. In the prosperous 1980s, supermarkets added
scores of fresh and prepared foods to the traditional array
of canned and packaged goods, and profit margins exploded.
Great Atlantic & Pacific Tea's gross margin on sales, for
instance, surged to about 25% from 22%.</p>
<p>Where it once offered 125 items of produce, A&P now sells
300 fruits and vegetables -- including, says Michael Rourke,
a spokesman, "things I hadn't heard of before."</p>
<p>A&P's customers are spending at its new fresh seafood
counters, and at its bakeries and delicatessens and at
counters stocked with freshly prepared, ready-to-serve
gourmet foods.</p>
<p>And, to take another example, at rapidly modernizing
Safeway, margins have soared by nearly two percentage points
since 1987 as the chain has introduced everything from live
lobster to takeout food prepared in Safeway's "complete
Chinese kitchens."</p>
<p>Thus, the question isn't whether people will continue to
get their three squares. It is, to quote Mr. Rourke: "Will
they keep eating fresh seafood or switch because it's too
expensive? Will they quit buying prepared foods?</p>
<p>"This is a question we have discussed quite a bit and we
don't know the answer," Mr. Rourke says. The period in which
the industry revamped itself coincided with "eight years of
good times."</p>
<p>The answer is critical -- and not just for A&P. According
to Salomon's Debra Levin, many newer stores garner as much as
50% of sales from "perimeter" departments such as delis,
bakeries, expanded produce, meat, seafood, floral sections
and pharmacies.</p>
<p>The gross margin is 35% to 40% on fresh fish, store-baked
breads, produce and homemade chicken salad. The margin on
canned soup is 15% to 20%; on packaged breads, 10% to 15%. (A
store that sells for $1 an item costing it 90 cents has a 10%
gross margin).</p>
<p>And with the advent of tough times in the Northeast, A&P
says its sales growth has slowed. "The general economy has
slowed down," Mr. Rourke says. "People are watching what they
spend."</p>
<p>Giant Food, the dominant chain in Washington, D.C., also
may be losing steam, says Oppenheimer's Edward Comeau.
Giant's gross margins, at 30%, are said to be the industry's
highest. Yet Giant's sales growth at stores open more than a
year has tailed off to a paltry 2.1% in the first half of
1990, after roaring ahead at about a 7% rate for three years.
David Sykes, chief financial officer, cites the downbeat
local economy and adds: "We haven't seen any shift in buying
patterns, but we may. People may be going where the specials
are."</p>
<p>Many analysts expect supermarkets to hang on to a good
chunk of their newer, high-profit business no matter how the
economy fares. Prepared foods appeal to the two-income
families where no one has time to slice and dice. Fresh
vegetables and fish have become a staple for health-conscious
Americans who measure the actuarial effect of every bite.</p>
<p>Then, too, the percentage of disposable personal income
that Americans spend on eating at home has shrunk steadily,
to 7.3% today from 14.1% in 1960, according to the U.S.
Department of Labor. Some analysts predict that consumers who
need to tighten their belts are unlikely to do so at the
supermarket. But their view is certainly debatable: If one's
spouse is out of work, grilled cheese tastes awfully good.
Supermarkets are full of shoppers wheeling down the aisles,
squinting at price labels to save a few pennies per item.</p>
<p>Although grocers have fared better than other industries
in past recessions, they haven't been immune. Typically, they
find it harder to raise prices, and thus, harder to maintain
margins. "Our best guess is we're reasonably
recession-resistant," says Patrick Totman, Safeway senior
vice president. "I don't think anyone is truly
recession-proof."</p>
<p>But the market is expecting supermarkets to grow, not just
tread water. And if people aren't likely to skip meals in bad
times, it is also dubious that they will start eating more.
To grow, supermarkets either must steal market share from
other stores or become more efficient.</p>
<p>Supermarket analysts know this, and profess not to be
worried. They are bulls -- with fingers crossed. "Companies
Should Hold Up Well in Mild Recession" says a recent report
by Shearson Lehman's Kimberly Walin, a fan, among others, of
Albertson's and Kroger. Yet in her generally upbeat report, a
caveat draws the reader's eye: "The industry's change makes
direct comparisons with (earlier) recessions not totally
objective . . . If we were to enter a very sharp recession,
the industry's product mix evolution could make it a bit more
vulnerable."</p>
<p>Sutro & Co.'s Jonathan Ziegler also sees supermarkets as a
haven in rocky times. In a report touting Albertson's,
American Stores and Safeway, Mr. Ziegler gushes over the
modern supermarket's new look -- in his words, "the exciting
presentation in many markets." But his excitement
notwithstanding, he also notes that "in recent months,
same-store sales growth apparently has begun to slow in
certain markets." He adds, almost as an afterthought: "We now
detect some signs that price competition may be reintroduced
on a selective basis . . . Thus, we have recently scaled back
our sales growth assumptions for the balance of this year."
(Late yesterday, American Stores announced it is exploring
the sale of Acme Markets, its 275-store East Coast unit.)</p>
<p>If a recession does take hold, Mr. Ziegler and others
argue that stores should see an increase in customer traffic,
because people would avoid restaurants and eat more often at
home. Safeway's Mr. Totman expects that while a downturn
might lead some high-margin Safeway shoppers to switch to
frozen dinners, "other people who are dining in Chinese
restaurants will buy (Safeway's) takeout Chinese food."</p>
<p>Not all of the supermarket industry's improvement in the
'80s can be attributed to high-profit foods. Its warehousing
and distribution practices have become highly computerized.
In terms of technology, "supermarkets are so far ahead of the
rest of retailing it's frightening," says Mary McAboy, head
of industrial relations at Von's. That trend is pushing more
of gross profits to the bottom line. Thus, any
recession-induced damage may be small.</p>
<p>But because supermarkets' net income is only about 1% of
sales, small changes in operations have a way of looking
large. And high multiples give the industry little room for
faltering.</p>
<p>Oppenheimer's Mr. Comeau says Albertson's, growing at 20%
to 25% a year, could slip in a down economy "to the 13% to
15% level." There is no complaint here with 15% growth. But
with Albertson's -- to cite an example -- trading at 20 times
the past 12 months' earnings, the Street is expecting growth
to be superlative. In terms of its stock price, merely solid
growth mightn't be enough.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>Country fund fever has turned out to be a killer. But it
may be creating some healthy buying opportunities.</p>
<p>Late last year, frenzied buying shoved up the stocks of
publicly traded funds that invest in Austria, Germany,
Malaysia, Thailand and elsewhere. Buyers of fund shares, who
often paid $1.50 to buy a portfolio of stocks worth $1, now
are sitting on sickening losses.</p>
<p>Nowhere have the losses been bigger than at Spain Fund,
which provoked the most extreme buying binge. Heavy Japanese
purchases at one point propelled the fund's stock to trade at
2.4 times the value of the fund's portfolio. But Spain Fund,
once quoted at 39, dropped yesterday to 10 7/8, a 52-week
low, before closing at 11. The fund's shares now are at a 14%
discount to the fund's $12.74 per-share portfolio value.</p>
<p>For today's bottom fishers, country funds are "down to
realistic levels," says Richard Barone, chairman of
Cleveland's Maxus Investment Group. "They're now good buys
for the long-term investor."</p>
