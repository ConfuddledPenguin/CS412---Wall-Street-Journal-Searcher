	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- The House voted to reduce spending for the
Strategic Defense Initiative to $2.3 billion in fiscal 1991
-- the lowest level in more than five years and nearly half
of the Bush administration's request for the ambitious
program.
   The 225-189 roll call reflected a concerted effort by the
Democratic leadership and underscored the continued
vulnerability of major strategic weapons despite the current
crisis in the Mideast.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The Iraqi threat was invoked by both sides in the debate
to bolster their opposing arguments, and a large portion of
the SDI savings is expected to be reallocated to meet
conventional-force needs in the Persian Gulf operation. An
amendment being crafted by House Armed Services Committee
Chairman Les Aspin (D., Wis.) would add back an estimated $1
billion elsewhere in the bill, including funds for
anti-chemical weapons equipment, fast sealift capability, and
hospital and ammunition supply ships.</p>
<p>Although the final margin last night was narrower and more
partisan than a comparable vote last year, the cut is
significantly deeper. The $2.3 billion level is less than the
House approved as early as fiscal 1986, and represents a
nearly 40% cut from the $3.8 billion authorization for the
current fiscal year ending Sept. 30.</p>
<p>Critics argued that the reduced level condemns the program
to research forever, and the Senate, which has approved $3.7
billion for SDI next year, is certain to demand a higher
figure. In this context, the vote was directed at buying some
leverage in the coming negotiations between the two chambers.
But even if the House moves more than halfway toward the
Senate, the final cut would be the deepest yet sustained by
the program.</p>
<p>The administration's own SDI budget was implicitly
rejected by a 338-83 margin. As much as conservatives cited
the threat of Iraqi arms, opponents countered that the
Pentagon had failed to give sufficient priority to the
relatively small portion of the program devoted to developing
systems that intercept low-flying missiles such as the Scud
used by Iraq.</p>
<p>Within SDI, an estimated $125 million is allocated this
year for these so-called theater defense programs, and while
the administration had requested $132 million for fiscal
1991, it was a Senate Democratic initiative that proposed to
raise the level to $180 million next year. Within this
figure, an estimated $42 million would be provided by the
Senate for the Arrow missile project with Israel, and
Raytheon Co. has a stake in related work to further upgrade
its Patriot missile, which has an anti-tactical missile
capability and is deployed with U.S. forces in the Mideast.</p>
<p>The House SDI provisions are neither as specific nor as
ambitious as the Senate proposal, but language inserted by
Rep. John Spratt (D., S.C.) cites the need for such
interceptor missiles as one of the top priorities for a
revamped program.</p>
<p>The debate on SDI came as the House moved toward final
adoption -- likely today -- of the underlying $283 billion
authorization bill for the Defense Department. Unlike the
Senate, the measure would stop production of any additional
B-2 bombers beyond the 15 already authorized, but rather than
fight the issue on the House floor, Republican allies of the
administration chose to avoid any vote yesterday that might
influence negotiations during the conference between the two
chambers.</p>
