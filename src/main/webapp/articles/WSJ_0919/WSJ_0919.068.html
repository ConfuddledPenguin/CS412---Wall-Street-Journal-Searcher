	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- CBS, the No. 3 network for three straight
years, had an unexpectedly strong showing Monday, the first
night of the 1990-91 prime time season.
   The television network unit of CBS Inc. won the night with
a 16.8 rating and a 27 share. ABC, a unit of Capital
Cities/ABC Inc., was second with a 14.7 rating and a 24
share, bolstered by its "Monday Night Football."</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>National Broadcasting Co., a unit of General Electric Co.
and the top-rated network for five straight years, was in
last place with a 12.9 rating and a 21 share, despite the
debut of "Fresh Prince of Bel Air," a situation comedy that
NBC hoped would be a breakout hit. (A ratings point
represents 931,000 TV households; shares are the percentage
of sets in use.)</p>
<p>CBS officials eagerly touted the network's victory,
specifically at 8 p.m. EDT, when "Uncle Buck," featuring
comedian Kevin Meany, beat "Fresh Price of Bel Air," starring
rap singer Will Smith. Both shows had their premiere Sept.
10, and on Monday, "Uncle Buck" rose 25% in the ratings from
the week before, while "Fresh Prince of Bel Air" fell 7%.</p>
<p>The win comes despite the fact that "the advertising
industry wrote off our show and picked NBC's as the hit,"
said David F. Poltrack, a CBS senior vice president.</p>
<p>However, NBC executives emphasized that its show won in
key demographic categories, including men and women 18 to 49
years old, that are most attractive to advertisers. The CBS
show was popular among adults 35 to 49 years old, as well as
those 50 years old and older.</p>
<p>"`Fresh Prince' was designed for teens and young adults 18
to 34 years old," said Bob Niles, a senior vice-president at
NBC. "We won in the targeted demographic."</p>
<p>CBS's Mr. Poltrack countered that "Uncle Buck" won in the
key demographic of adults 25 to 54 years old. The CBS show
had an 8 rating and NBC's show attracted a 7.5 rating. "We
want to build on a sophisticated audience of our other Monday
shows, `Murphy Brown' and `Designing Women,'" he said.</p>
<p>Monday also was the kickoff of CBS's promotional contest
with K mart Corp., another factor that rivals said
contributed to the size of CBS's win. Next Monday, NBC begins
its "tune in to win" contest in conjunction with McDonald's
Corp.</p>
<p>The win was a big morale booster for CBS. In the 1989-90
season, CBS usually only won Sunday night. "This is the first
of many surprises from CBS," according to Mr. Poltrack.</p>
<p>Last week, the final week of the 1989-1990 season, the
season premiere of "60 Minutes," produced by CBS News, was
the top-rated show. "CBS Evening News with Dan Rather" didn't
fare as well. It trailed ABC's top-rated "World News Tonight
with Peter Jennings" by 1.4 ratings points, the 36th
consecutive week that it came in second. It was ahead of
third-place "NBC Nightly News with Tom Brokaw" by only
four-tenths of a ratings point. The network news race is
usually much closer with three broadcasts separated by only
tenths of ratings points.</p>
<p>"ABC News has continued to fortify its leadership,"
conceded Mr. Poltrack. "We didn't hold on to the audience we
attracted at the beginning" of the network's coverage of the
Middle East crisis, he said.</p>
