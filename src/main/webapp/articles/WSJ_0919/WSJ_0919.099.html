	<p class="article-leader">Two separate instances in recent days prove what we have
always known. Our sentinels of progress and social welfare
never sleep. Now, in their endless struggle on behalf of the
needy, they have taken on both Mother Teresa and the
Salvation Army.
   The conflict involving Mother Teresa began when her order,
the Missionaries of Charity, undertook to renovate two old
buildings in New York City into residences for the homeless.
Bearing all the costs of the extensive renovation themselves,
the nuns planned to provide food, clothing, shelter and job
referrals for more than 60 homeless men.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The trouble began when New York City officials demanded
that the nuns install an elevator for disabled tenants, as
per the requirement that such housing include facilities for
the handicapped. The nuns, unprepared for the additional
expenditure of something close to an additional $100,000,
assured the city that they stood ready to carry any
handicapped resident who could not climb stairs. They asked
for a waiver of the elevator requirement, which the city's
Buildings Department was prepared to grant. Until, that is,
Mayor David Dinkins's Office for People With Disabilities
weighed in.</p>
<p>As Director Anne M. Emerman saw it, approving the waiver
didn't just have to do with elevators; it had to do with the
endorsement of wrong values. Explaining why the nuns carrying
people upstairs would not do for New York City (also
occasionally known as Calcutta on the Hudson), Ms. Emerman
noted, "Their attitude in India is, they go out and carry
people in off the street. . . . We said no, you don't carry
people up and down in our society. That's not acceptable
here."</p>
<p>Thanks to this intercession, Mother Teresa's nuns have
scuttled their project to house the homeless of New York
City. In place of housing for the homeless, the city instead
got the Mayor's Office for People With Disabilities providing
a ringing reaffirmation of our prevailing societal and
cultural standards. That should help keep the homeless warm
this winter.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the Bush administration's Labor Department has
gone to war with the Salvation Army, which has for more than
a hundred years fed, sheltered and counseled the poor. Those
who receive their services of food, board and roughly $20 a
week are required, in exchange, to perform a modicum of work
for the Army, such as gathering old clothes, unloading trucks
or assisting in the kitchen.</p>
<p>The Labor Department has decided that the Salvation Army
is an employer guilty of exploiting workers under the terms
of the Fair Labor Standards Act and is demanding that the
Army's beneficiaries be paid the minimum wage. The Salvation
Army argues, unanswerably, that the destitute to whom they
assign work, and whom they feed and try to teach discipline,
cannot be considered employees in the usual sense of the
word. The Labor Department's efforts to force them to pay a
wage would, moreover, force their service centers out of
business by bankrupting them. Until now, the Salvation Army
has been providing 11,000 beds at 117 centers around the
country.</p>
<p>We will continue to monitor the efforts of the public
welfare bureaucracy to extinguish the 1,000 points of light
one by one.</p>
