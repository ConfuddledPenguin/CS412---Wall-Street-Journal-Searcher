	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- In rumor-fueled trading, the stock of Chase
Manhattan Corp. yesterday was the big bank that had Wall
Street worried the most.
   Showing how touchy the market for bank stocks is these
days, Chase fell as much as $2 a share to $13.875 at one
point, before closing at $15, down 87.5 cents, in New York
Stock Exchange composite trading of 1.6 million shares.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Sparking the slide were rumors that Chase was having
trouble selling its commercial paper, or short-term corporate
IOUs. Chase responded by not only denying the rumors but also
charging arbitragers with "spreading certain rumors in an
unsettled commercial banking climate."</p>
<p>Traders and analysts had their fill of rumors from all
directions. "I heard a litany of Chase's problems all day.
But there was nothing new," said the head trader at one large
brokerage firm. "In this environment, no one, especially
portfolio managers reporting third-quarter positions, wants
to hold anything that has the slightest hint of bad news."</p>
<p>Chase's stock already is among the most troubled among
major commerical banks. As of Friday, it was off 63% from its
52-week high of $44.875, while the average major bank stock
was off 51%. Banks are off more sharply than the stock market
because the weakening economy and regulatory pressures have
caused one bank after another to make unexpected provisions
for problem loans, especially in real estate.</p>
<p>The rumor about Chase's commercial paper came atop other
investor concerns about Chase and rekindled old concerns as
well. They included worries that Chase's dividend, now
yielding a hefty 16%, would be cut or eliminated and that a
previously announced restructuring would result in a big
third-quarter loss.</p>
<p>"I've heard every rumor today except that management is
leaving," said Frank DeSantis, an analyst with PaineWebber.
He and other analysts said they don't believe that Chase's
dividend is in imminent danger.</p>
<p>An executive at Chase, in denying the rumors that Chase
couldn't sell its commercial paper, also said the bank
holding company relies on that market for only 2% of its
funding. Even if the paper market were to shut Chase out,
"We're pretty flush with cash and have other sources of ready
funding," he said.</p>
<p>From a credit standpoint, "investors overreacted," said
Fay Wong, a bank analyst with Fitch Investors Service, a
rating concern. Still, the reason Chase's stock remains
vulnerable, according to some analysts, is that the bank has
yet to give much of a signal to investors on how much its
restructuring will cost, what Chase will do to keep its
capital levels in compliance with new international standards
and what exposure the bank has to problem loans.</p>
<p>"The scope of further charges is what the market is
waiting to hear," said James McDermott, head of research at
Keefe, Bruyette & Woods. Shortly after a new management team
was announced this summer, Chase said it planned to save
about $300 million a year after a restructuring that would
eliminate jobs.</p>
<p>Mr. McDermott estimates that voluntary retirements and
mandatory layoffs could cost as much as $250 million, which
will be taken before year's end. He said he also expects
Chase will add at least $325 million to its loan-loss
reserves in the third quarter, up from a $250 million
provision in each of the first two quarters.</p>
<p>The latest decline in Chase's stock is especially
troubling for holders who purchased more than $600 million of
newly issued Chase shares last October at $40 each. The stock
offering, the first since the bank was founded in 1877, left
Chase executives disappointed because underwriters had missed
the $44 level that the shares were trading at a few weeks
earlier.</p>
