	<p class="article-leader">SEATTLE -- Penwest Ltd. said it may buy as many as 500,000
of its common shares on the open market from time to time
under a previously announced plan to acquire as many as
900,000 shares.
   Penwest, which makes and markets specialty carbohydrate
and synthetic polymer chemicals for paper-making, has bought
400,000 of its shares since its board authorized such
purchases in April 1989 for use in stock option plans or
acquisitions and for other corporate purposes. It has 7.1
million shares outstanding.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Separately, Penwest said analysts' estimates of earnings
of 25 cents to 28 cents a share were in line with its own
estimates for its fourth quarter, ended Aug. 31. It will
disclose final results in October.</p>
