	<p class="article-leader">Itel Corp. repurchased 4,675,000 of its shares from Henley
Group Inc. last week at $18 a share, or about $84 million.
   In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission,
Henley said it now holds 14 million Itel shares, or 33% of
those outstanding.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>In August, Itel, a leasing company, agreed to buy 25%, or
4,675,000 shares, of the 18.7 million shares that Henley
owned at $18 a share.</p>
<p>Itel also agreed to buy another 4,675,000 shares held by
Henley before the end of the year for about $91 million, or
$19.50 a share.</p>
<p>Itel has an option to buy the remaining 9,350,000 shares
that Henley owns at $21 a share if it makes the purchase by
March 31, 1991, or at $22 a share if it buys the stake by
July 31, 1991. If Itel doesn't exercise the option, it must
underwrite the sale of the 9,350,000 shares at $22 a share,
or $206 million, according to the pact.</p>
<p>On Monday, Standard & Poor's Corp. downgraded its rating
on more than $1 billion of Itel debt, citing the increased
leverage prompted by Itel's agreement to buy back shares from
Henley. S&P said the buy-back, which is being financed
through asset sales, will increase debt leverage during an
expected economic downturn.</p>
