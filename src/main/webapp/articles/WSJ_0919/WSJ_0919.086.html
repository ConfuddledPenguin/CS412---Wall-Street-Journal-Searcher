	<p class="article-leader">Japan Inc. is trying harder to promote an all-American
identity for its U.S. operations.
   Japanese manufacturers long have preferred
product-oriented advertising. That has been a fairly easy
sell here, considering Japanese goods' reputation for quality
and reliability.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>But now, worried about growing anti-Japanese sentiment,
more Japanese companies are mounting or planning broad
corporate-image advertising in the U.S. for the first time.
Among them: Canon, Honda Motor, Panasonic, Sony and Toyota
Motor.</p>
<p>The firms want to woo consumers by stressing their
expanded range of American-made products and roles as good
U.S. corporate citizens. A Panasonic campaign that begins
next month, for instance, will tie its products to vignettes
about American life. To further raise their U.S. profile and
better coordinate marketing efforts, a handful of Japanese
concerns such as Sanyo and Toshiba also have opened Manhattan
headquarters offices for their U.S. operations since 1989.</p>
<p>The new push could help allay popular resentment of
Japan's massive American acquisitions spree, seen in the
recent rash of Japan-bashing ads. The drives also could
deflect further tensions as the U.S. economy deteriorates.
Japanese corporations "are running out and spending {ad}
money just as an inoculation" against greater pro-America
fervor, says one advertising agency executive who is crafting
image ads for a major Japanese client. They fear
"intensification of anti-Japanese feeling," he adds.</p>
<p>Such concerns persuaded Honda to prepare its first
large-scale image campaign in America, a nearly $10 million
effort set to break this Friday in USA Today and The Wall
Street Journal. The 12 different ads in the yearlong drive
will highlight Honda's commitment to America rather than tout
particular products, explains Eric Conn, senior manager for
automobile advertising at American Honda Motor Co.</p>
<p>Honda officials hope to convince opinion makers that "we
are not a foreign power draining {America} dry," Mr. Conn
continues. "So many people think that we stick {profits} in
big boxes and mail them back to Japan." He says the ads also
are geared at getting consumers who prefer buying American to
consider Honda cars because "this company is more American
than they thought."</p>
<p>The Japanese car maker's first full-page ad displays a
Honda Sports Coupe, manufactured at its Marysville, Ohio,
plant and equipped with a right-hand steering wheel, which
cars in Japan use. The model "is made only in America," the
advertisement boasts. "But that's not the only place it's
sold. Thousands of Honda Sports Coupes are exported to Japan
every year." Honda began exporting the cars last year.</p>
<p>Some U.S. executives of Japanese companies are reluctant
to admit they're taking a defensive tack with their new
advertising. Informed Americans "already know we have made
incredible investments in the U.S.," argues Jeffrey Brooks,
senior vice president of advertising at Sony Corp. of
America. Sony, which owns CBS Records and last year purchased
Columbia Pictures Entertainment, will start running its U.S.
corporate-image advertising in late October, mainly in
magazines and on television.</p>
<p>Any resulting deflection of Americans' anti-Japanese
feelings "would be a side effect," Mr. Brooks says. "That's
not the main direction." The real goal, he insists, is to
bolster Sony's brand image across a range of entertainment
products.</p>
<p>Similarly, Toyota executives say its maiden U.S. image
campaign, launched in May after three years of planning, just
happened to coincide with a flurry of ads attacking Japan and
Japanese products. "It's not a direct response" to such Japan
bashing, says Timothy Andree, a Toyota public-relations
manager in New York. "Toyota in America is an American
company. I'm not worried about carrying the banner for
Japan."</p>
<p>But the campaign, costing almost $10 million this year,
deliberately pitches a wholesome image of Toyota as an
American-style practitioner of corporate good citizenship.
The ads describe community programs supported by Toyota.</p>
<p>Advertising critics aren't sure the new corporate
campaigns will do much good, either at selling products or
overcoming Americans' anxieties about Japan. The ads tend to
lack a sharp focus, these critics say, because Japanese
corporations know a lot more about promoting products than
about pushing themselves.</p>
<p>"You constantly have to build your image" in the U.S.,
says Hironobu Shibuya, president of public-relations firm
Dentsu-Burston-Marsteller, a U.S.-Japanese joint venture.
"That bugs the hell out of the Japanese because it's
something they never had to do back in Japan. It's a very
American idea."</p>
<p>The other danger, he warns, is that the Japanese image ads
will boomerang and exacerbate anti-Japanese fervor. "Trying
to buy that {all-American} image by running expensive ads,"
Mr. Shibuya suggests, "can rub off in the wrong way."</p>

<p>Kodak Picks WPP Unit</p>
<p>Eastman Kodak named WPP Group's J. Walter Thompson unit to
handle the ad launch of its new electronic photography
system, which the company unveiled Monday.</p>
<p>The system, which will transfer 35mm photographs onto
compact disks for viewing on TV, won't be available until
mid-1992. Kodak wouldn't say whether or not it held a
competition for the ad assignment.</p>
<p>Kodak also wouldn't disclose the ad budget for the system,
except to say spending would be "commensurate with
expenditures for our most significant consumer products." At
that rate, spending for the system, called "Photo CD," could
approach $30 million.</p>

<p>Ad Notes. . . .</p>
<p>ARROW ACCOUNT: Cluett, Peabody & Co. awarded the $10
million account for Arrow Shirts to Ammirati & Puris, New
York. Cluett Peabody was bought earlier this year by
Bidermann Industries. The account was previously handled by
Chiat/Day/Mojo.</p>
<p>PR SALE: Aegis Group PLC, previously known as WCRS, sold
its public relations division, Creamer Dickson International,
to a unit of French communications giant Eurocom S.A., for
#10.75 million ($20.6 million). With this sale, which
includes U.S. PR agency Creamer Dickson Basford, Aegis
continues its strategy of focusing on its core media-buying
operations and shedding other businesses.</p>
<p>AUTO SPENDING: Automotive advertising on broadcast
television rose 8% in the first half of 1990, reaching more
than $1.5 billion, according to the Television Bureau of
Advertising. Network spending, reflecting an increase in
corporate ad campaigns, rose 21% to $865 million. Spot ad
expenditures, though, slipped 5% to $640 million, as slow car
and truck sales hurt individual dealers' budgets.</p>
<p>NEW ACCOUNT: ProGroup Inc. named Tracy-Locke, Dallas,
agency of record for its Arnold Palmer line of golf clubs.
Fallon McElligott, Minneapolis, formerly handled the account.
Billings weren't disclosed.</p>
