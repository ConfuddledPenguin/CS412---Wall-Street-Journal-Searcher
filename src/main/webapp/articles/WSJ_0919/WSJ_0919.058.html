	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- A plunge in exports and a disturbing surge
in oil imports in the month before the Persian Gulf crisis
helped swell the U.S. merchandise trade deficit nearly $4
billion in July, to $9.33 billion, the Commerce Department
reported.
   The new figures are probably only the beginning of a
string of bad trade news for the U.S., as the jolt in oil
prices brought on by Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait begins
to boost the U.S. petroleum-import bill further, many
economists said.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"If you think this trade deficit is bad wait till you see
the next few," said Irwin Kellner, chief economist at
Manufacturers Hanover Trust Co.</p>
<p>After improving in five of the first six months this year,
exports tumbled 6.4% in July, to $32.03 billion from a record
$34.22 in June, the department said. The drop reflected lower
shipments of a range of goods, from factory machinery to farm
products.</p>
<p>At the same time, imports jumped 4.5%, to $41.36 billion,
according to the report, bolstered by the higher petroleum
imports as well as increases in shipments of foreign-made
cars, capital goods and industrial supplies.</p>
<p>In June the trade deficit had sunk to its lowest level in
seven years, $5.34 billion, and most analysts had said the
monthly gaps were unlikely to continue that small.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, many were surprised by the magnitude of the
widening, partly because it came in a month when petroleum
prices fell.</p>
<p>The price of a barrel of crude petroleum dropped to $14.50
in July from $14.68 in June, according to the report. But the
number of barrels imported grew to 274.5 million from 252
million, raising the country's oil bill 7.9% to $3.98
billion.</p>
<p>Secretary of Commerce Robert Mosbacher said yesterday that
the jump in oil prices as a result of the Middle East turmoil
is likely to increase the U.S. trade deficit more than $2
billion each month through the end of the year.</p>
<p>That would mean that the monthly merchandise trade
deficit, which has narrowed substantially in 1988 and 1989,
probably won't shrink further this year. By the end of July
the trade gap was about $8 billion smaller than during the
like period in 1989.</p>
<p>"I think it will be very difficult" to finish 1990 with an
improved trade deficit, said Sam Nakagama, chairman and chief
economist at Nakagama & Wallace Inc., an economic advising
firm in New York. He also noted that the trade balances of
many countries around the world will be hurt by the oil-price
rise.</p>
<p>But more worrisome than oil prices to some economists was
the big drop in exports, which had been one of the U.S.
economy's few remaining areas of growth. "It's another nail
in the coffin of the economic expansion," Mr. Kellner said.</p>
<p>Other analysts were more sanguine, predicting that recent
declines in the value of the dollar will help exports by
making U.S. goods cheaper for foreign customers.</p>
<p>The numbers in the report were adjusted for seasonal
fluctuations.</p>
