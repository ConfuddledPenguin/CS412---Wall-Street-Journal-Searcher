	<p class="article-leader">James P. Lennane, a Naples, Fla., investor, said he raised
his stake in ASK Computer Systems Inc. to 9.67% from about 6%
of the common shares outstanding, according to a filing with
the Securities and Exchange Commission. Mr. Lennane said in
the filing that he holds 1,283,100 shares, including 282,000
shares he purchased between Sept. 4 and Sept. 17 for $7.50 to
$8.125 a share.
   The filing did not give a reason for the increase. Mr.
Lennane couldn't be reached at his home, but an ASK Computer
spokeswoman in Los Altos, Calif., said Mr. Lennane has been
accumulating stock in the company for several months. "The
last time he increased his stake to 6% {several months ago},
he said it was for investment purposes," she said. "We're
inclined to take him at his word because following that,
nothing happened."</p>
