	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- The Food and Drug Administration asked
manufacturers of toothpastes and mouthwashes to submit
scientific data to justify the anti-plaque claims on their
product labels.
   The FDA didn't accuse the manufacturers of misleading
consumers. But it said much research has been done in the
area of oral health care since anti-plaque toothpastes and
mouthwashes were first reviewed by the agency as
non-prescription drugs. In recent years, the products have
been heavily promoted as preventing, among other things, the
buildup of dental plaque and gum disease.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>If the data don't support the various claims, the FDA said
it would require the manufacturers to drop them. Anti-plaque
toothpastes are touted as containing abrasives that provide
mechanical action to remove plaque. Mouthwash manufacturers
claim their products work differently, through anti-microbial
or chemical activity.</p>
<p>Under the federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, the safety
and effectiveness of such product ingredients must be
demonstrated, an FDA spokeswoman said.</p>
