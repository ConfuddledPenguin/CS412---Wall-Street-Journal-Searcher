	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- A new analysis by the Resolution Trust Corp.
indicates that an attempt to squeeze savings from the
controversial 1988 sales of insolvent savings and loans could
provoke yet another bailout for these institutions.
   As much as $4 billion in excess costs could be trimmed
from 96 transactions through the prepayment of assistance and
exercise of certain contract options, according to the RTC,
which currently pegs the costs at $54 billion on a
present-value basis. Many of the transactions were sweetened
for investors at the expense of the Treasury, locking in
roughly $4.2 billion in tax benefits overall.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>But if the RTC, the government's S&L cleanup agency,
exercises contract options to reap those savings, it would
require about $22 billion in temporary cash, and the S&L
bailout is already short of funds. Moreover, if the
government withdrew some of its assistance, as permitted
under the contracts, dozens of those S&Ls will end up right
back at the government doorstep, insolvent and awaiting a new
round of government assistance to protect depositors.</p>
<p>The sale of nearly 200 insolvent S&Ls in 1988 has
increasingly stirred controversy as the soaring cost of the
S&L excesses becomes clearer. Many Wall Street financiers,
including the Robert Bass Group, and Ronald Perelman's
holding company, MacAndrews & Forbes Holdings Inc., reaped
huge tax benefits. The S&L cleanup law required the
regulators to look for ways to shrink some of the costs of
those sales.</p>
<p>But exercising the options in all 96 sales would be a
huge, cash-draining process. The S&L bailout is expected to
run dry of funds by year-end, unless Congress allocates
additional funds. Currently, spending for the S&L cleanup is
ensnarled in the budget negotiations between Congress and the
Bush administration. "If they want to make savings, they have
to be willing to come up with this kind of money," warned RTC
Chairman William Seidman.</p>
<p>Without an agreement to cut the budget deficit, it's not
clear whether Congress is willing to shake loose even
short-term money. Rep. Bruce Vento (D., Minn.), who heads a
House task force on the RTC, said he favors spending cash to
lower overall costs, but isn't sure his colleagues will
agree. "There is a real temptation to get into a denial of
the issue," he said. "The administration is talking about
Iraq and pushing this as far away as they can."</p>
<p>The funds, if approved, would be used to pay off
high-interest-bearing notes, and repurchase assets from the
S&Ls in order to manage them more cheaply. For example, in
the Robert Bass Group acquisition of the thrift now known as
American Savings Bank, Stockton, Calif., $520 million could
be saved by prepaying an $8 billion assistance note to the
buyer.</p>
<p>"That's fine with us," said a spokesman for the Robert
Bass Group. "We are perfectly willing to work with them." He
said that the institution has already sold $16.48 billion in
assets that drew government assistance, leaving roughly $4.9
billion in assets.</p>
<p>The RTC could also write down the value of the
money-losing assets on the S&L's books, which would reduce
the amount of government assistance in some cases. Some
institutions, numbering in the dozens, the RTC says, rely
heavily on the government assistance. "Some of those may be
in jeopardy," a spokesman for the RTC said. "It may make more
sense on a case-by-case basis to take no action rather than
create an insolvency."</p>
<p>Mr. Seidman is discussing the report, and the government's
options, at a meeting tomorrow with the RTC's Oversight
Board. The RTC is also in the midst of another analysis of
the transactions, expected in November, which seeks to
determine if any of the deals might be overturned because of
any fraud or mismanagement associated with the transactions.</p>
