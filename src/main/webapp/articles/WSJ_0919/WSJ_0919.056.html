	<p class="article-leader">Xerox Corp. is to begin its latest bid to become a player
in the office computing market today, introducing a computer
workstation and a range of software products, industry
executives said.
   The workstation is a departure for Xerox because it will
be built by Sun Microsystems Inc. around Sun's widely
available Sparc microprocessor, the executives said. Xerox,
an office-products company based in Stamford, Conn., has sold
only proprietary workstations to run its well-regarded
Viewpoint software, used mainly for document-processing.
Xerox will also introduce a new version of Viewpoint written
for Sun's version of the Unix operating system, an industry
standard.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Industry executives said Xerox also will introduce a skein
of software packages intended to tie together the various
computers and programs used in most offices, in an attempt to
give users of computer networks a consistent,
easy-to-understand view of their work. Aside from Unix, it
will work with DOS and OS/2, the operating systems used by
most personal computers.</p>
<p>Xerox's new computing "environment," while still tilted
toward document-processing applications, will be presented as
a systemwide approach similar to highly publicized products
such as International Business Machine Corp.'s OfficeVision
or Hewlett-Packard Co.'s New Wave, the executives said.</p>
<p>The company is likely to promote its reputation as the
originator of many of the innovations in these packages, and
thus the most natural provider of software that exploits
them. A Xerox spokeswoman declined to comment on today's
announcement, which will be made in San Francisco.</p>
<p>On Oct. 2, Xerox is expected to announce a large
multifunction copier-printer that will hook up with the
company's new products as well as a host of other hardware
and software products. That machine also will have scanning
and facsimile capabilities, and is expected to play a large
part in Xerox's push into office computing systems.</p>
