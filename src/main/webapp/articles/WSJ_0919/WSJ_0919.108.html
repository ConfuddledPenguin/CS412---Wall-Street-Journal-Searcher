	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- KPMG said its board, as expected, elected Jim
Butler as chairman of its international practice, succeeding
Larry Horner.
   KPMG, the international accounting and consulting firm
formed in the 1987 merger of Peat Marwick International and
Klynveld Main Goerdeler, also named Johann Steenmeijer to the
new post of chief executive and deputy chairman, effective
Nov. 1. Both Mr. Butler, 61 years old and Mr. Steenmeijer,
57, are currently senior partners in the British and Dutch
practices, respectively of the firm, which is based in
Amsterdam.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Mr. Horner, 56, said in early August that he wouldn't seek
re-election as chairman of the international practice or of
the U.S. practice, KPMG Peat Marwick. Last week, Jon C.
Madonna, 47, was nominated chairman and chief executive of
the U.S. practice. He needs majority approval of the U.S.
practice's 1,850 partners, who are scheduled to vote Oct. 3
and 4, when Mr. Horner's term in that practice expires. KPMG
has a total of 6,100 partners worldwide.</p>
<p>Mr. Horner took over the top positions at Peat Marwick in
1984 and at the international organization in 1988. He was
said to be the driving force behind the merger of the firms
into the largest of the Big Six accounting and consulting
firms. He said in declining to seek another term that the
firm needed an executive who could stay longer in the
positions, which carry six-year terms. The mandatory
retirement age for the positions is 60.</p>
