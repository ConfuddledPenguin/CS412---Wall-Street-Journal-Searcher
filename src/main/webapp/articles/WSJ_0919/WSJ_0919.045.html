	<p class="article-leader">MILWAUKEE -- Badger Meter Inc. said holders approved a
plan that allows the company's officers and directors to
purchase its Class B shares, which have enhanced voting
rights.
   Previously, only eight holders could buy Class B shares as
they became available. The change raises the total to 25. The
maker of flow-measurement products said the Class B stock has
10 votes a share, while the company's common has one vote a
share. The company said that as of Aug. 24, it had 562,785
Class B shares and 1,105,042 common shares outstanding.
Badger said the move is consistent with its plans to boost
employee ownership, raise cash and retain officers and
directors.</p>
