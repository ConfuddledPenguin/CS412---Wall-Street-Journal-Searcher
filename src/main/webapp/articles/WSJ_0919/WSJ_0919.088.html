	<p class="article-leader">ANADARKO PETROLEUM (Houston) -- said it will redeem on
Oct. 18, the entire $100 million principal amount outstanding
of its 5 3/4% convertible subordinated debentures, due 2012.
Under the exchange offer, holders will receive $1,042.97,
which includes an early call premium and accrued interest,
for each $1,000 principal amount of debentures held. Or, the
company said, holders may opt to convert the debentures into
Anadarko common at a conversion price of $32.625 a share.
Anadarko, an oil and gas exploration and production concern,
said a conversion into common of the debentures would reduce
debt by about $100 million, from a level of about $474
million at June 30, and increase the number of shares
outstanding by 5.8% or roughly 3.1 million shares. Anadarko
has about 52.4 million shares currently outstanding.</p>
