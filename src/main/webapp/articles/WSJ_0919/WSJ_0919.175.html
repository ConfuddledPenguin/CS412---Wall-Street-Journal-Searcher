	<p class="article-leader">Amdahl Corp. said it will introduce the most powerful
IBM-compatible mainframe computers yet, making the company
the fourth player to enter the most recent round of market
jockeying among mainframe vendors, kicked off by Hitachi
Ltd.'s announcement last June.
   After Hitachi threw down the gauntlet with its
next-generation mainframes, International Business Machines
Corp. and Fujitsu Ltd. declared their plans for new and more
powerful machines in early September, only a day apart.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Amdahl's new 5995 series of mainframes will include 10
models, which won't be shipped before late 1991. The series
includes at the top of the line an eight-way multiprocessor
with three times the power of any previous Amdahl mainframe.
This premium machine also will be the first IBM-compatible
system to use eight central processing units.</p>
<p>"Our basic building block {the uniprocessor} is bigger
than theirs," said Joe Zemke, president and chief operating
officer of Amdahl, Sunnyvale, Calif. In terms of raw power,
Amdahl indeed leads the pack. But not by much: Amdahl's new
mainframes offer as much as 54 million instructions a second
for each uniprocessor, while Fujitsu offers 50 mips, Hitachi
45 mips and IBM 41 mips. At the top of the line, Amdahl's
eight-way multiprocessor, the 5995-8650M, offers about 323
mips, while IBM's top model, the six-way ES/9000, has 210
mips, analysts say.</p>
<p>The Amdahl models also are equipped to handle massive
amounts of memory; each microprocessor can support a total of
10 gigabytes of processor storage. A gigabyte is 1,000
megabytes.</p>
<p>The new mainframes will range in price from $3.2 million
to $32 million, and Amdahl's four most high-powered models
won't be ready for shipment until at least the fourth quarter
of 1991 and as late as the second quarter of 1992, the
company said. Hitachi has said that its most powerful new
machines will be available in the second quarter of next
year, and IBM has said its biggest machines will be available
in the third quarter.</p>
<p>Mr. Zemke said that Amdahl made its announcement so early
because, given the spate of claims from competitors, "we
really wanted to clear the air about what we were going to do
and when it would be available."</p>
<p>In spite of the impressive specifications, the long delay
in shipment -- which has been a feature of the announcements
by Amdahl's rivals -- inspired some dubious reactions from
industry watchers. "Amdahl will have leapfrogged IBM's,
Fujitsu's and Hitachi's latest, that's unquestionably true,"
said Bob Djurdjevic, president of Annex Research in Phoenix,
Ariz., who follows the company. "But I get to be skeptical
with any of these claims when the lead time is this long. We
are unfortunately going back to the days of marketing wars.
These are all paper tigers, by vendors who don't want to be
perceived as being left behind."</p>
<p>Despite the staggering prices at the top of the line --
only a few years ago, price tags topped out at $5 million --
analysts predicted that Amdahl's $32.1 million eight-way
model probably would attract the most interest -- from
corporate customers with huge data-processing requirements.</p>
<p>While at first glance, Amdahl would appear to be competing
with its own kissing cousin -- it is 44%-owned by Fujitsu --
the Japanese company's new mainframe offerings aren't
IBM-compatible and won't be marketed in the U.S., Mr. Zemke
said. The two companies use the same semiconductor technology
for their new mainframes, but they are designing,
manufacturing and marketing their versions separately.</p>
<p>In American Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday,
Amdahl shares closed at $12.125, down 37.5 cents.</p>
