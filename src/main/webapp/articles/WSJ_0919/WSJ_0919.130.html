	<p class="article-leader">TORONTO -- The Canadian subsidiary of Ford Motor Co.
presented a new contract proposal offering more money in a
bid to end a four-day-old strike by about 13,000 unionized
employees.
   While calling the company's latest package a "serious"
offer, Robert White, president of the Canadian Auto Workers
union, said the proposal still fell short of many of the the
union's minimum demands in important areas such as wages,
additional holiday time, job security and fringe benefits.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The union leader appeared to back away from his earlier
threats to abandon the bargaining table, and he said
negotiations would continue in an effort to reach a contract
settlement.</p>
<p>Ford has "obviously rejected a number of our bottom-line
proposals. We'll have to see if we can do anything about that
in the next couple of days," Mr. White said.</p>
<p>Donald McKenzie, Ford Canada's chief negotiator, said the
company's latest offer was a "significant improvement" over
its first proposal made last week, which was swiftly rejected
by the union. The CAW has made clear it didn't dispute the
"direction" of the offer, but rather the amount of money put
on the table.</p>
<p>"My sense is {the new offer} will move things forward
rapidly," Mr. McKenzie said. He wouldn't provide details of
the latest package.</p>
<p>The strike by Ford Canada employees has shut nine of
Ford's plants in Canada and threatened to hobble operations
at some key Ford plants in the U.S.</p>
