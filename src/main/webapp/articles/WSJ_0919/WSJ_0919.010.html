	<p class="article-leader">RIO DE JANEIRO -- Rising oil imports caused Brazil's trade
surplus to shrink to $1.03 billion in August, down 29% from a
year ago, the government's Foreign Trade Department said.
   Exports in August were practically unchanged from July but
down 9% from a year earlier. Imports rose 23% from the
previous month and were 5% higher than in August 1989.</p>
