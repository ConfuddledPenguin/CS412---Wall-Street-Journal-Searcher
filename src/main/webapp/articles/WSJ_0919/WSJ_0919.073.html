	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Stock and bond prices swung wildly, dragged
down at first by the latest economic data and then pulled
back up by rumors of a budget accord.
   The Dow Jones Industrial Average eked out a 3.96 rise to
2571.29, after being down as much as 34 points in the
morning. Bonds ended flat, recovering from a decline of
nearly a half of a point, or almost $5 for each $1,000 of
face amount. The dollar, which had lost ground steadily for a
week, also started lower but rebounded in a wave of
profit-taking in the yen and mark.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Volume on the New York Stock Exchange was an unspectacular
141,130,000 shares, but it was the busiest day in three weeks
and much brisker than Monday's anemic 110,600,000 shares.</p>
<p>Indicating the stock market's vulnerability to rumors,
shares of Chase Manhattan plunged as much as 2 on talk that
the banking concern was having trouble placing its commercial
paper. Chase denied it, and the stock rebounded, ending at
15, down 7/8.</p>
<p>"It shows you how people are jumpy on any type of news,
not wanting to be the last guy off a sinking ship," said Paul
Hennessey, head of equities trading at Boston Co. "It's the
fear thing. That's when people start throwing stocks away."</p>
<p>All financial markets were hurt early in the day on news
that the July trade deficit had widened more than expected
and that so-called core inflation -- the consumer price index
not including energy and food -- was stronger than predicted.</p>
<p>The overall CPI for August rose 0.8% -- or 9.6% on an
annualized basis -- bringing the annual inflation rate so far
this year to 6.2%. However, core inflation rose a
stronger-than-expected 0.5%. The trade deficit widened to
$9.33 billion instead of the expected $7.6 billion.</p>
<p>Both stocks and bonds, however, turned the corner and
headed higher on rumors that an agreement to cut the U.S.
budget deficit was imminent. Even so, oil remains the
dominant influence in stocks, said Ted Eggert, equity
research manager at Yamaichi International. Yesterday, oil
prices retreated; the October oil-futures contract edged down
22 cents to close at $33.41 a barrel.</p>
<p>In major market action:</p>
<p>Stock prices rose, but declining issues on the New York
Stock Exchange led advancers, 854 to 626.</p>
<p>Bond prices were flat. The yield on the Treasury's
benchmark 30-year bond stood at 9.06%.</p>
<p>The dollar rose. In late New York trading, the currency
was quoted at 1.5530 marks and 137.85 yen, compared with
1.5480 marks and 136.55 yen Monday.</p>
