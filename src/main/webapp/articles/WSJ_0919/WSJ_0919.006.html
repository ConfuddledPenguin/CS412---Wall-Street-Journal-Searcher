	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Darling-Delaware Co., which failed to make a
$12.2 million bond interest payment due last Saturday, is
seeking buyers for some or all of its operations, according
to the company's financial advisers.
   Last week, the Dallas-based rendering company told
bondholders that it needs to restructure its debt in light of
weak financial results so far this year. For 1990's first
half, the company had an $11.3 million loss on revenue of
$177.8 million. Darling-Delaware makes tallow and grease from
animal parts and restaurant waste.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"If third parties are willing to put more capital into the
company, we're interested," said Bruce Raben, a Jefferies &
Co. investment banker who is advising Darling-Delaware. Mr.
Raben said about 10 potential investors in Darling-Delaware
have approached the company. These range from regional U.S.
renderers interested in buying several plants to corporate
restructuring funds that might want an equity position in the
company, he said.</p>
<p>Darling-Delaware on Saturday missed a semi-annual interest
payment due on its $175 million of 14% senior subordinated
debentures, which mature in 1999. These high-yield "junk"
bonds were issued in March 1989, shortly after
Darling-Delaware paid a $179 million dividend to a group of
Texas and Connecticut investors who own the company. The
bonds currently trade at about 25 cents on the dollar.</p>
<p>Darling-Delaware also has about $110 million in bank debt
outstanding, owed to a syndicate of banks led by France's
Banque Paribas. Mr. Raben said the company is current on all
its bank interest payments. Paribas bankers didn't return
repeated phone calls.</p>
<p>At a creditor's meeting last week, Darling Delaware's
current owners didn't make specific restructuring proposals,
said David Ying, an investment banker at Smith Barney, Harris
Upham & Co. who is advising the bondholders. Mr. Ying said
the company is asking bondholders for their suggestions -- an
unusual strategy for a company with debt problems.</p>
<p>Messrs. Ying and Raben both said they expect that specific
restructuring proposals will surface in about 45 days.</p>
