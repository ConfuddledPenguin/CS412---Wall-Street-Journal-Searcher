	<p class="article-leader">SAN JUAN BASIN ROYALTY TRUST, which is based in Fort
Worth, Texas, said it won't make a cash contribution to unit
holders on Sept. 28. Its Trustee Team Bank said production
expenses exceeded revenue by $2.6 million from May through
September. The oil and natural gas trust's portion of this
excess is $1.9 million. Under the terms of the trust, losses
on production are recovered from subsequent months' royalty
income. The trust expects continued losses on production
because of low demand and low prices for natural gas.</p>
