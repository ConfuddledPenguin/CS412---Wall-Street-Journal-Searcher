	<p class="article-leader">BOSTON -- Fidelity Investments, underscoring its push into
overseas markets, named successful money manager C. Bruce
Johnstone chief investment officer and a managing director of
its Fidelity International Ltd. affiliate.
   Mr. Johnstone, 49 years old, the best-known money manager
at Fidelity after the recent departure of Peter Lynch, since
1972 has managed the $4.1 billion Fidelity Equity-Income
Fund, the third-largest of Fidelity's more than 100 equity
funds. The fund has been a top performer long term, but it
has had a weaker performance in recent years as "value
investing" in high-yield stocks, Mr. Johnstone's forte, has
fallen out of favor generally.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Mr. Johnstone's appointment is "a very aggressive move
showing they're taking {international markets} very
seriously. It should put the rest of the industry on notice
that there's going to be a big push with resources behind it
to make it work," said D. Tyler Jenks, vice president and
research director at Kanon Bloch Carre & Co., which tracks
mutual funds.</p>
<p>Mr. Johnstone will be based in London and will oversee
portfolio management operations in Europe, Asia and
Australia, which oversee about $11 billion in mutual funds,
unit trusts and institutional accounts for overseas
investors. Fidelity manages $117 billion of assets in the
U.S.</p>
<p>"Bruce Johnstone's appointment is a key strategic move,
reflecting our belief that investment success in the 1990s
will depend on how well investors exploit the entire world of
investment choices," said Edward C. Johnson 3rd, chairman and
chief executive officer of Fidelity.</p>
<p>Mr. Johnstone said he asked Mr. Johnson for a new job
because he wanted to try something different. "After you
manage money for 19 years, it's not as much of a novel or
learning experience as it was in the beginning. The variety
isn't quite the same." In his new position, he won't manage
investments, but develop management talent and "create the
kind of environment overseas that we have here."</p>
<p>Fidelity said that from Dec. 31, 1971, to Aug. 31 of this
year, the Equity-Income fund under Mr. Johnstone had a return
of 1,108.87% vs. 596.11% for the Standard & Poor's 500. This
performance ranks it 18th among the 229 funds in Lipper
Analytical Services' "general equity" fund category during
the period.</p>
<p>More recently, Mr. Johnstone's fund hasn't fared as well.
Eric Kobren, a newsletter publisher who tracks Fidelity, said
the Equity-Income Fund is down 13.4% year to date, slightly
worse than the S&P 500 drop of about 10%. Last year, the fund
rose 18.7%, well below the S&P's increase of 31.7%. He said
Fidelity is starting a second Equity-Income fund because it
is hard to attract investors by advertising the performance
of the existing one.</p>
