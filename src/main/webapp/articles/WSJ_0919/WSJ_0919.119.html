	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- Top congressional leaders took over budget
negotiations with the White House, after lower-ranking
lawmakers failed to resolve the key remaining issues in
marathon bargaining.
   "The talks are not collapsed," House Republican Leader
Robert Michel said, after Democratic leaders and their GOP
counterparts met with top Bush administration negotiators.
"We are just moving them to a different stage."</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Negotiators from both parties said they narrowed their
differences substantially during 11 days of closed-door talks
at Andrews Air Force Base near here. Indeed, the offers put
on the table late Monday have many common elements, such as a
new tax on luxury goods and a goal of $120 billion of
spending cuts in benefits programs over the next five years.</p>
<p>But, as several people close to the talks have been
assuming for months, the final -- and most difficult -- calls
now must be made at the top ranks by Senate Democratic Leader
George Mitchell, House Speaker Thomas Foley (D., Mich.) and
President Bush himself.</p>
<p>Democrats insist that the major stumbling block to the
long-sought accord to reduce the federal budget deficit is
the administration's desire to cut the capital-gains tax rate
without also raising income tax rates on wealthier Americans.
"The problem . . . centers around the insistence of the
administration to reduce the capital-gains tax, " Rep. Foley
said.</p>
<p>Republicans, while sensitive to Democrats' criticism that
the capital-gains cut is a break for the rich, emphasized
that other major issues remain, including the rules by which
a five-year fiscal blueprint will be enforced and the details
of spending cuts. "To suggest that we were very close, except
for that {capital-gains taxes}, was exceptionally
inaccurate," a Republican participant said.</p>
<p>With only 12 days left before across-the-board spending
cuts are imposed by the Gramm-Rudman deficit-reduction law,
Sen. Mitchell of Maine and Rep. Foley are to meet again today
with White House Budget Director Richard Darman, Treasury
Secretary Nicholas Brady and White House Chief of Staff John
Sununu. Also participating will be the top Republican
leaders, Sen. Robert Dole of Kansas and Illinois Rep. Michel,
as well as House Democratic Leader Richard Gephardt of
Missouri.</p>
<p>Excluded will be some negotiators with particularly
inveterate views, including Sen. Robert Byrd (D., W.Va.),
Sen. James Sasser (D., Tenn.), Sen. Phil Gramm (R., Texas)
and Rep. Newt Gingrich (R., Ga.).</p>
<p>Even if the high-level talks produce an accord, however,
ratification by the full Congress isn't guaranteed. Just
yesterday, Democrats on the Ways and Means Committee
privately complained to Chairman Dan Rostenkowski (D., Ill.)
that budget negotiators weren't testing their proposals
sufficiently with their colleagues, and warned that a
deficit-reduction package might be rejected as a result.</p>
<p>Speaking to reporters aboard Air Force One, Mr. Bush said,
"Everybody . . . agrees that they've come quite a way, but
it's not done, by a long shot." He avoided any criticism of
Democrats in campaign speeches yesterday, but reiterated his
eagerness to cut capital-gains taxes. "This is not a tax
break for the rich," he said in Denver. "It will create
jobs."</p>
<p>In a sixth round of proposals, Democrats and Republicans
on Monday night traded stripped-down plans that were crafted
as much for public consumption as for each party. Democrats
said they would give up most of their spending and tax
initiatives if Republicans gave up the quest for lower
capital-gains taxes. Both proposals would reduce the deficit
by about $50 billion in fiscal 1991, which begins Oct. 1, and
by about $500 billion over five years.</p>
<p>On taxes, the basic division is how to offset a cut in the
capital-gains tax rate. Democrats proposed a 20% income-tax
surcharge on couples with incomes of more than $200,000 and
individuals with incomes above $125,000, effectively raising
their marginal tax rate to 33.6% from the current top nominal
rate of 28%.</p>
<p>Republicans concede that any compromise will have to raise
taxes on the rich and have offered several alternatives,
including limiting total tax deductions for upper-income
taxpayers. Their last offer was to limit to $10,000 the
deduction for state and local income taxes for taxpayers with
incomes above $200,000.</p>
<p>Several Republicans complained privately that Sen.
Mitchell, long a proponent of higher tax rates on the rich,
was standing in the way of a compromise.</p>
<p>Though both parties would raise taxes by a net of $130
billion over five years, Democrats propose additional tax
increases to cover expanded proposed tax breaks for
lower-income taxpayers, as well as a variety of user fees
they didn't count as taxes. "The Democratic package has too
many taxes in it," Sen. Pete Domenici (R., N.M.), a
negotiator, said.</p>
<p>In a previously undisclosed area of agreement on taxes,
both parties proposed to forbid corporations from deducting
interest on tax underpayments, raising about $4.5 billion
next year. The two parties also agreed to increase taxes on
life insurance companies by $2 billion in the first year and
by $10 billion over five years.</p>
<p>Both parties endorsed a new 10% tax on luxury goods, to be
applied to the purchase price in excess of $30,000 for cars,
boats and yachts; $5,000 for jewelry; $1,000 for electronics;
$500 for furs and the entire price of private aircraft under
5,000 pounds. And both parties support an increase in taxes
on liquor, beer and wine, to yield about $14 billion over
five years, though the details weren't described in the
proposals.</p>
<p>Democrats proposed increasing the tobacco tax, now 16
cents on a pack of cigarettes, by four cents a pack in 1991
and an additional four cents in 1993. Though Democrats said
Republicans have tentatively agreed, several Republicans deny
this -- and their proposal doesn't show any such increase.</p>
<p>Though both sides would raise energy taxes, the Democrats
would raise $49 billion over five years through higher energy
taxes. The Republicans, who would limit increased energy
taxes to refined petroleum products, would raise $7 billion.</p>
<p>On defense spending, both parties are converging on a plan
crafted by Sen. Sam Nunn (D., Ga.), chairman of the Armed
Services Committee. The administration estimates the plan
would reduce projected Pentagon spending by about $175
billion over five years; some Democrats say it would save
even more. In what remains an important sticking point,
however, Democrats are willing to lock in the defense cuts
for only the next two years, while Republicans want to set
totals for the next five years.</p>
<p>Democrats, in short, want to leave open the possibility of
tapping the defense budget to fund domestic spending programs
in future years, while Republicans want to limit increases in
domestic spending, other than benefit or entitlement
programs, to the rate of inflation.</p>
<p>On benefit programs, both parties said they want to cut
projected spending by about $120 billion over five years,
though Republicans said the Democrats' proposals fall short
of that mark. Neither plan would touch Social Security
benefits.</p>
<p>In the latest proposals, Republicans proposed deeper cuts
in Medicare, calling for, among other things, increasing the
deductible on coverage for doctors' services, known as Part
B, to $150 from the current $75 and increasing the deductible
with inflation. They would raise the premium for Medicare,
now at $28.60 a month, so that the premium covers 30% of the
total costs instead of 25%, as the law now provides. Details
of the Democratic plan weren't available.</p>
<p>Both parties also proposed substantial cuts in farm
subsidies over five years. Democrats would reduce them by
$11.8 billion from levels projected in the farm bill that has
passed both houses of Congress. Republicans would reduce
subsidies by $13.3 billion. Sponsors of the farm bill
explicitly delayed making any substantial cutbacks in
subsidies, pending the outcome of the budget summit.</p>
<p>As they have from the start, the Republicans pushed for a
substantially tougher revision of the Gramm-Rudman law than
Democrats are prepared to accept to enforce the terms of any
budget accord. "Their current enforcement {plan} is, `Trust
me.'" Rep. Gingrich complained.</p>
<p>With the White House forecasting a fiscal 1991 deficit of
about $250 billion, neither Democrats nor Republicans would
try to meet the law's $64 billion deficit target; rather,
they are expected to amend the law to avoid triggering
across-the-board spending cuts.</p>
<p>Without any change in the law, spending cuts amounting to
more than $85 billion will be triggered on Oct. 1. Though
there is substantial skepticism in Congress, the
administration vows it won't agree to waive the law unless
there is a budget agreement.</p>
<p>"The clock is ticking," Mr. Bush said.</p>
