	<p class="article-leader">GREENWICH, Conn. -- Helm Resources Inc. said it and a
group of investors expect to bring a reorganized Scat
Hovercraft Inc. out of bankruptcy court proceedings by next
month, with a new marketing campaign for the maker of
hovercraft vehicles.
   Helm said that with its investment in Scat, it will retain
majority control of the Miami company after new stock is
issued to the investors. Scat has been operating under
Chapter 11 of the federal Bankruptcy Code to protect itself
from creditor lawsuits. Helm said a plan of reorganization
for Scat was recently approved in bankruptcy court, and a new
board will be appointed when the reorganization is completed.</p>
