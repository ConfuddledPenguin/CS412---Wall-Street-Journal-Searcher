	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- The House Judiciary Committee approved a
bill that would restrict the use of the federal Racketeer
Influenced and Corrupt Organizations law in civil lawsuits.
   The legislation, approved yesterday on a voice vote, would
leave intact the RICO law's criminal provisions, but it would
limit the ability of private parties to brand their courtroom
opponents as "racketeers" and seek triple damages.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>An unusual coalition of business groups and the American
Civil Liberties Union has tried for years to curb RICO,
arguing that a law designed to target organized-crime
syndicates has become a common weapon in garden-variety
commercial disputes. Consumer advocates and some liberal
legislators have opposed revising RICO, contending that it is
an effective weapon against white-collar fraud in areas such
as the crippled savings-and-loan industry.</p>
<p>The bill would make revisions generally considered to be
more moderate than those called for in legislation approved
in February by the Senate Judiciary Committee. It remains
unclear, according to Capitol Hill aides, whether proponents
of limits on RICO will be able to iron out differences and
get a compromise approved by both houses before Congress
adjourns this fall.</p>
<p>The House version, promoted as a compromise, would make
federal judges "gatekeepers" for RICO, permitting its use
only if certain conditions are met. Specifically, judges
could allow a private RICO suit if the plaintiff alleges
"egregious criminal conduct" and the claim involves a
previous criminal conviction. To permit such a suit, judges
also would have to find that the defendant was "a major
participant" in criminal conduct and that the potent
triple-damage remedy is needed to deter future egregious
criminal acts.</p>
<p>Rep. John Conyers (D., Mich.), who has led opposition to
the bill, warned that it would "diminish legal remedies for
citizens in the S&L failures, where we have the biggest
economic scandal in American history."</p>
<p>The House panel approved an amendment offered by one of
the bill's sponsors, Rep. Rick Boucher (D., Va.), that was
intended to address concerns about weakening RICO as a weapon
in lawsuits involving S&Ls. The amendment would create a
legal presumption that a defendant had engaged in "egregious
criminal conduct" if his alleged injury to the plaintiff
involved a financial loss suffered by an S&L that fails.</p>
<p>But Pamela Gilbert of the Washington consumer-advocacy
group Public Citizen called the amendment "purely cosmetic,"
because under the House version a judge would still have to
find that a defendant was a "major participant" in criminal
conduct to allow a RICO suit involving an S&L-related loss.
That requirement "would let off all the accountants and
lawyers and investment bankers responsible for a lot of the
{thrift} failures," Ms. Gilbert said.</p>
<p>In two major differences from the House version, the
Senate bill doesn't include the "gatekeeper" provisions, but
it would eliminate triple damages in almost all instances.
The Senate's proposed revisions in RICO would apply to
lawsuits filed only after the law's enactment. The House
Judiciary Committee addressed that issue by passing an
amendment that would make limitations on RICO applicable six
months after the law's enactment.</p>

<p>SECESSION LAW gets approval from New York's highest court.</p>
<p>The ruling by the New York Court of Appeals will allow the
borough of Staten Island to begin a cumbersome process that
could lead to its secession from New York City.</p>
<p>In November, Staten Islanders will get to vote on whether
to establish a commission to study the secession issue. But
state legislators cautioned that even if the borough's
residents ultimately vote to secede, it is unlikely the
city's least populous borough will ever leave New York City.
The state Legislature must approve the secession and is
considered unlikely to do so.</p>
<p>Interest in secession has grown since last year's U.S.
Supreme Court ruling that the city's Board of Estimate, which
gave the borough an equal voice in the city's governance,
violated the one-person one-vote principle. Some residents
fear that Staten Island, with only 400,000 residents, will
not get its fair share of city services under the newly
enacted city charter. New York City officials have opposed
the law allowing for a secession referendum.</p>
<p>If this November's proposal passes, a commission will have
three years to recommend whether secession is the best thing
for the borough. If a secession referendum then passes, the
borough may vote on whether to secede, and then leave it to
the Legislature to make its decision.</p>
<p>"Should Staten Island secede it could pose enormous
problems for the city," said Michael Johnston, who follows
municipal finance for Moody's Investors Service Inc. "It
seems premature to be overly concerned about it, however."</p>

<p>BUYER OF PROPERTY gains new weapon in conflict over waste
cleanup.</p>
<p>U.S. District Judge D. Brock Hornby of Portland, Maine,
refused to dismiss a claim by Hanlin Group Inc., seeking to
hold the seller of a manufacturing plant liable for an
environmental cleanup.</p>
<p>In 1982, Hanlin purchased the plant in Orrington, Maine,
from International Minerals & Chemical Corp., now known as
Imcera Group Inc. Four years later, the Environmental
Protection Agency said the site was contaminated with
hazardous waste and ordered Hanlin to undertake a cleanup, as
required under the federal Resource Conservation Recovery
Act. Enacted in 1976, the act holds the owner of a site
liable for the cleanup of hazardous waste.</p>
<p>Hanlin, a closely held Edison, N.J., chemical
manufacturer, sued International Minerals, alleging the
company was strictly liable for any cleanup costs because it
had caused the contamination. The ruling last week upholds a
decision by a federal magistrate allowing Hanlin to proceed
on the claim.</p>
<p>Under the doctrine of strict liability, a defendant
engaged in an activity considered to be abnormally dangerous
may be held liable for damages, regardless of whether the
defendant was negligent.</p>
<p>Typically, the strict-liability doctrine has allowed
people living near a contaminated site to seek compensation
for damage to their property. Maine is only the second state
to rule that the doctrine is not limited to neighboring
landowners and can be used by purchasers against sellers of
contaminated property. An earlier New Jersey case is pending
in the state's supreme court.</p>
<p>Under an agreement signed with the Environmental
Protection Agency, Hanlin estimates it will spend $3 million
to $4 million just to study the extent of contamination at
the site, says John J. O'Leary Jr., a lawyer for Hanlin.
Cleaning up an average site can often run as high as $100
million.</p>
<p>Andrew Schlickman of the Chicago firm Sidley & Austin, a
lawyer for Imcera, said the Northbrook, Ill., company had not
decided whether to seek further review of the decision.</p>

<p>MANVILLE TRUST formally asks court to authorize class
action for claims.</p>
<p>In its motion, filed in federal court in Brooklyn, N.Y.,
the trust said it has inadequate funds to pay all the
personal-injury claims against it. The motion was expected,
as part of U.S. Judge Jack B. Weinstein's efforts to come up
with a nationwide approach to settling many of the thousands
of asbestos claims now pending in the courts.</p>
<p>The trust was formed in 1988 as part of the
bankruptcy-court reorganization plan of Manville Corp. to pay
asbestos personal-injury claims against the company.</p>
<p>Eagle-Picher Industries Inc., another former asbestos
maker, has made a similar motion before Judge Weinstein. As
many as five other defendants, including the Manville trust,
have been expected to join Eagle-Picher in that process.
Eventually, a single claims-processing facility could be set
up by the court to pay those claims.</p>

<p>XEROX CORP. wins reversal of jury verdict in
discrimination suit.</p>
<p>A federal judge in Dallas overruled a jury verdict that
awarded $9 million to a woman who claimed she was made a
victim of fraud, age and sex discrimination by Xerox.</p>
<p>In his ruling Monday, U.S. District Court Judge Sidney
Fitzwater said Elizabeth Layman's claims against her former
employer weren't supported by the evidence. Ms. Layman, who
had worked for Xerox in Dallas, alleged that Xerox in 1986
fraudulently promised to find her a job in California.</p>
<p>Xerox said it had in fact offered Ms. Layman, 48 years
old, two jobs in California, both at higher pay than her
Dallas job, but that she rejected them as inferior and chose
instead to resign and file suit.</p>
<p>Attorneys in the case said Ms. Layman is expected to
appeal.</p>

<p>DEFENSE LAWYER can be compelled to testify on fees,
appeals court rules.</p>
<p>Federal prosecutors had sought to require Mike DeGeurin, a
prominent Houston criminal-defense lawyer, to testify about
the fees he received for defending a man charged with
possession of cocaine. Suspecting Mr. DeGeurin's bill is
being paid with drug money, prosecutors had subpoenaed him
last September to testify before a federal grand jury
investigating his client.</p>
<p>Two U.S. Supreme Court rulings in June 1989 gave
prosecutors wide authority to seize assets of accused
criminals, including funds needed to pay lawyers' fees. But a
federal district judge blocked the subpoena of Mr. DeGeurin,
saying that it could turn him into a witness against his own
client. Last Friday, a three-judge panel of the federal
appeals court in New Orleans reversed that decision but
delayed issuing a written opinion.</p>
<p>Although Mr. DeGeurin's client already has been sentenced
to prison, prosecutors are pressing for the attorney's
testimony anyway, because they believe the fees were paid by
a third person involved in illegal drugs. "There is no
attorney-client privilege there," says Larry Finder, an
assistant U.S. attorney in Houston.</p>
<p>Mr. DeGeurin's attorney, brother Dick DeGuerin, says he
won't know the scope of the court's ruling until a written
opinion is produced. If his client in fact is compelled to
testify, he says, "that's a disaster -- and very discouraging
for practicing lawyers."</p>
