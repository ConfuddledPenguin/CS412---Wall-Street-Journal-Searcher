	<p class="article-leader">Boeing Co. said its de Havilland unit received an order
valued at about $22 million for two Dash 8 series 300
airplanes from Schreiner Airways B.V., a division of
Schreiner Aviation Group of the Netherlands.
   The twin-engine turboprop planes will be delivered within
the next few months, Boeing said. Schreiner Airways provides
regional commuter service, charter service and other aviation
services.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Boeing continues to discuss the possible sale of the de
Havilland unit with Aeritalia of Italy and Aerospatiale of
France. A team from the two potential buyers is expected to
continue reviewing de Havilland's operations for another few
weeks, said a de Havilland spokesman in Toronto. Boeing is
based in Seattle.</p>
