	<p class="article-leader">The war against high legal costs gained a surprising ally
recently when a state judge in Massachusetts slashed a
lawyer's fee because he thought it was too high.
   The judge's unusual action, which enraged and worried
lawyers in Massachusetts, has sparked a fierce legal battle
that has now reached the state's highest court.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>If the judge's fee-cutting is upheld, the life of
contingency-fee lawyers (and their clients) may never be the
same.</p>
<p>The controversy came when Alan R. Goodman, a Springfield,
Mass., attorney, appeared to hit the jackpot in settling a
personal injury case against Browning Ferris Industries Inc.
in December.</p>
<p>A contingency fee contract with his client gave Mr.
Goodman one-third of the nearly $3 million award -- a tidy
$975,000. "He is entitled to be handsomely compensated for
what he accomplished," noted John F. Moriarty, the judge in
the Springfield trial.</p>
<p>But not that handsomely, the judge concluded. Although
neither the client nor anyone else objected to the fee, Judge
Moriarty went on to conclude that it was "unreasonable and
excessive," so he reduced it by nearly 30%. Now attorneys
worry that the case will encourage other judges to
second-guess the terms of lawyer-client agreements.</p>
<p>"There's not a lawyer in Massachusetts who doesn't know
about the case," says Mr. Goodman. "It's a hot issue."</p>
<p>Mr. Goodman is hardly unbiased, but the Massachusetts Bar
Association says the decision already is creating confusion
about the validity of lawyer-client agreements, and the
standards to be used in future pacts. In a
friend-of-the-court brief seeking a reversal of the ruling,
it contends the decision will spark unnecessary litigation
over fees and prompt attorneys to demand even higher
contingency fees, or else avoid such arrangements.</p>
<p>"The substantial adverse effects of this decision on
society, the courts, litigants and their attorneys must be
avoided," the association argues. The Massachusetts Supreme
Judicial Court heard oral arguments on the issue earlier this
month; its decision is pending.</p>
<p>Contingency-fee pacts, under which an attorney agrees to
forgo fees if he loses but to take a hefty percentage --
typically 30% to 40% -- of his client's recovery if he wins,
is at the center of growing debate. Supporters say the system
enables less affluent plaintiffs to hire top trial lawyers,
which, they contend, is why doctors, corporations and
liability insurers -- frequent targets of suits seeking
damages -- keep trying to change the system.</p>
<p>"They're trying to make it more difficult for an injured
person to obtain competent counsel," says Michael C. Maher,
an Orlando, Fla., attorney and president of the Association
of Trial Lawyers of America. "They want an uneven playing
field."</p>
<p>Mr. Goodman says his client, Donald A. Gagnon, could never
have afforded a top attorney if required to pay by the hour,
the more traditional billing method. Mr. Gagnon was
permanently paralyzed from the waist down when he was struck
by a garbage truck owned by Browning-Ferris, a Houston-based
waste-handling company. For its defense, the company retained
a large Boston law firm, Martin, Magnuson, McCarthy & Kenney.</p>
<p>But critics insist the potentially high payoff of
contingency-fee arrangements encourages more lawsuits that
"puff up" damages, as Martin F. Conner, president of the
American Tort Reform Association, puts it. Moreover, they
argue, the all-or-nothing nature of the system prompts
plaintiffs lawyers to settle cases -- thus ensuring a fee --
even though it may not be in the best interests of their
clients.</p>
<p>"In a system in which over 95% of cases are settled, the
whole notion of contingency looks a little odd," says Mr.
Conner. "We think it needs a lot more regulation -- along the
lines of what this judge apparently is doing."</p>
<p>The push for such regulation has borne fruit. Some states,
including Massachusetts, already have adopted legislation
that imposes caps on such fees in medical malpractice cases.
And federal procedural rules authorize judges to regulate the
fairness of fees in certain types of litigation -- big class
actions, for instance, where plaintiffs lawyers sometimes
represent thousands of plaintiffs with claims totaling tens
of millions of dollars.</p>
<p>In Brooklyn, N.Y., last month, U.S. District Judge Jack B.
Weinstein capped at 20% the fees that plaintiffs attorneys
can take from certain payments of health claims to asbestos
victims. Given the limited funds available to pay the
nationwide personal injury claims, it is "intolerable" that a
major portion has been going to legal fees, the judge said.</p>
<p>But in other areas, regulation of fees is less clear,
leading to ad hoc actions such as Judge Moriarty's. The judge
said in his decision in February that a fee constituting
one-third of a damage award is "reasonable to a point," but
it gets less so as the size of the recovery increases. Even
if the state's medical malpractice cap were applied, Mr.
Goodman's fee would work out to be about $300 a hour, the
judge calculated, substantially less than his one-third fee
calculated on an hourly basis. The judge also noted that the
maximum compensation permitted for appointed counsel in
murder cases is $50 an hour.</p>
<p>In the end, Judge Moriarty devised his own formula,
concluding that Mr. Goodman should be paid one-third of the
first $300,000 recovered, 25% of the next $1.2 million, and
20% of anything above $1.5 million.</p>
<p>"At those rates, Mr. Goodman is entitled to an attorney's
fee of $695,000, which I consider to be handsome
compensation," Judge Moriarty declared. "Anything in excess
of that amount would be unreasonable and excessive."</p>
<p>But Massachusetts attorneys insist Judge Moriarty went too
far, especially when no one had complained about Mr.
Goodman's fee. At a hearing to review the fee, Mr. Gagnon
testified he was satisfied with the arrangement, and with Mr.
Goodman's performance. Paul Keane, lead counsel for
Browning-Ferris, said he was impressed with Mr. Goodman's
work. Even the judge acknowledged that he worked "hard and
well" and achieved a "very favorable" result.</p>
<p>"It's a very unusual situation," says Mr. Maher. "I've
never seen one like it before."</p>
<p>In appealing Mr. Goodman's case to the state's supreme
court, Boston attorney Joseph W. Glannon contends a judge
shouldn't be revising a standard contingency-fee contract
when there isn't any question of fraud, and when the
arrangement has worked to the client's advantage. No one
argued in support of Judge Moriarty's decision.</p>
<p>Although the outcome is unpredictable, legal experts say
the case will require the Massachusetts high court to balance
at least two fundamental concepts in American law. One is a
sort of inherent power of most judges to ensure that legal
fees are fair and reasonable. The other is a strong tendency
to respect contracts.</p>
<p>Victor Schwartz, an attorney with Crowell & Moring in
Washington, D.C., is one of those who favors more regulation
of contingency fees. But he suggests that legislative
remedies may be preferable to judicial intervention such as
this, at least partly because attorneys have a clearer idea
of what to expect.</p>
<p>"If I'm going to get a speeding ticket," says Mr.
Schwartz, "I want to know what the speed limit is."</p>
