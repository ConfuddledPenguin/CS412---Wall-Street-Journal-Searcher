	<h3>Banks Fare Poorly in Their Attempts To Parcel Out Parts of Big RJR Loan</h3>

	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Regional and foreign banks are balking at
taking on a large portion of last month's $2.25 billion loan
to RJR Nabisco Inc. unless they get a bigger cut of the fat
fees offered to the banks that originated the loan.
   About two dozen banks lent money to RJR in July as part of
a wide refinancing plan for the tobacco and food company. The
loan -- which offered banks unusually high up-front fees for
participating -- was oversubscribed by more than three to
one.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>As is typical with such large financings, the lead banks
are trying to parcel out much of the loan to a wider group of
banks. Such syndications help the original lending banks
avoid undue concentration in lending to a single borrower.
Syndications also let smaller banks widen their loan
portfolios.</p>
<p>So far, however, the RJR loan syndication hasn't proved
popular. The American Banker yesterday reported that RJR's
main lending banks have pooled together to offer $1.4 billion
of the RJR loan for resale, but attracted bids for only $200
million of the loan as of last Friday. The pooled syndication
is due to expire Aug. 31. "I suspect the {main} banks will
come up short and perhaps far short of what they want to
sell," said one banker who has lent to RJR.</p>
<p>The main sticking point, bankers said, is how to divide up
the fees that RJR paid last month to get the loan done. The
fees that RJR's main banks collected ranged from 2.75% of
their loan amount to as much as 8% in a few cases. The loan
was led by units of Bankers Trust New York Corp., Chase
Manhattan Corp., Long-Term Credit Bank of Japan, Fuji Bank
Ltd., Security Pacific Corp., Citicorp and Manufacturers
Hanover Corp.</p>
<p>New banks buying into the loan are currently being offered
fees as low as 0.5% if they buy a $10 million piece of the
loan, or 1% if they buy $35 million or more, bankers said.
That has struck some banks as too puny to attract their
interest. "People knew what the main banks got paid," one
banker said. "There's a feeling that if the loan is going to
be sold down, the main banks can afford to share a lot of the
fees."</p>
<p>Starting next month, several bankers said, they expect
that more of the latest RJR loan will be sold to a wide group
of banks, with greater fee-sharing than is currently being
offered. Several of RJR's agent banks insisted, however, that
they aren't in any rush to sell their RJR loans and are
simply testing the market with the current pooled offer.</p>
<p>The current tussle over the RJR loan syndication doesn't
matter to the tobacco and food company itself; it already has
collected its $2.25 billion. The struggle also is unlikely to
leave any one bank hugely exposed to RJR; the largest single
bank loan to the company in this round of lending was about
$110 million.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, bankers said, the current impasse shows that
the mania for leveraged lending has calmed down considerably
from the late 1980s, when banks such as Citicorp and Bankers
Trust often were able to sell off 90% or more of their loans
to highly leveraged companies, and still keep millions of
dollars of fee income on their books.</p>
