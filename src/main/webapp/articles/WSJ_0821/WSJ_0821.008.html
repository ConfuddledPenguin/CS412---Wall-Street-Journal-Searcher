	<p class="article-leader">It is often asserted that real wages have generally
deteriorated since 1972. For ordinary wage-earners, the 1980s
boom was no boom at all: Their condition stagnated while
high-income people gobbled up the new wealth.
   For example, the authoritative "Green Book," issued
annually by the House Ways and Means Committee, claims that
average yearly earnings in terms of constant 1987 dollars
rose from $17,062 in 1970 to a peak of $18,109 in 1972. From
then on, inflation-adjusted average earnings decreased to
$16,699 in 1980 and then more slowly to $15,968 in 1989. The
average rate of decrease in real average earnings from 1980
to 1989 was O.5% per year.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>It is these figures that critics of the 1980s boom are
relying on when they say there was no boom at all for most
people who draw a paycheck. Happily, the figures are not
correct.</p>
<p>In my opinion, the wage-indexing series developed by the
Social Security Administration for various purposes in
connection with the Social Security program is a better
chronicle of wage movements than the Green Book. The Ways and
Means statistics do not really reflect the amount that the
average person earns in a year. Rather, they are average
weekly earnings as reported by the Bureau of Labor Statistics
of the Department of Labor times 52. Since some persons are
not employed in all weeks of a year, this tends to overstate
actual earnings.</p>
<p>At the same time, because BLS does not study the country's
entire work force in the country, but only production and
nonsupervisory workers on non-agricultural payrolls, it tends
to understate earnings.</p>
<p>In a final push toward error, BLS figures are obtained by
survey sampling rather than by counting everybody.</p>
<p>The Social Security series is, by contrast, based on the
total earnings of all employees in the first quarter of the
year, annualized. The data involved in the computations are
on a "complete count" basis and do not involve samples or
surveys.</p>
<p>The Social Security wage data show the 1980s in quite a
different light from the Green Book. While the two series
agree about what happened in the 1970s, the Social Security
data suggest that wages were in fact 4% to 7% lower than the
BLS data in most of the 20 years from 1947 through 1966 and
appreciably higher in the 10 years from 1980 through 1989.
The Social Security average wage was 2.47% higher than the
BLS average in 1980, and the differential steadily increased
to as much as 14.3% for 1988 and 17.6% for 1989.</p>
<p>In constant 1987 dollars, the Social Security averages
rose to a peak in 1972 of $18,147 and then slowly declined to
$17,092 in 1980. But since 1980 after-inflation wages have
grown by about 1.1% a year, to $18,778 in 1989.</p>
<p>So who's right, BLS or Social Security? One way to check
is to match them both against a third wage series, average
weekly wages in employment covered by the state unemployment
insurance programs, as reported by the Office of Employment
and Unemployment Statistics in the federal Department of
Labor. (Because these data are based on only covered workers,
they are affected by legislative changes in unemployment
insurance coverage, and so data from before 1972 are not
comparable with later data.)</p>
<p>Compare the unemployment insurance numbers to the Social
Security and BLS numbers, and you find much greater
correspondence with the Social Security numbers than with the
BLS ones. Because the unemployment insurance numbers are
based on weekly wages rather than quarterly ones, they tend
to be higher than the Social Security numbers, but the
relationship between them has been constant, while the
relationship between them and the BLS numbers has not been.</p>
<p>The ratio of the unemployment insurance average wage to
the Social Security one has not deviated much from around
115% throughout the 1980s -- the same relationship as
obtained for the period from 1972 through 1979 as well. On
the other hand, the ratio of the unemployment insurance
average to the BLS numbers, after remaining level at about
115% from 1972 to 1979, deviated sharply afterward. It rose
steadily to 131% in 1988 -- confirming the hypothesis that
the BLS numbers are too low.</p>
<p>Although both the BLS and the Social Security series show
a deterioration of wages totaling approximately 7% from 1972
to 1980, the Social Security series shows an encouraging
annual average rate of increase of 1.1% from 1980 to 1989,
and the BLS series shows a dismaying decrease of 0.5%. The
Social Security numbers are confirmed by a second major wage
series; the BLS numbers are not. Democrats, Republicans --
take your choice.</p>
