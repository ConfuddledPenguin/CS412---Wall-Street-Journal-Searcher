	<p class="article-leader">MILAN, Italy -- A Milanese stockbrokers' committee met to
try to avert the forced liquidation of stock held by
Commissionaria Lombardfin S.p.A.
   The meeting was amid concern that time may be running out
for a solution to the brokerage's problems, which contributed
to a further plunge on the Milan Stock Exchange.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Lombardfin problems stem from its purchase of a 32% stake
in Partecipazioni Finanziarie & Industriali (PAF), 52%-owned
by Gianni Varasi and his family. Italian press reports have
put the value of that purchase at about 100 billion lire ($88
million).</p>
<p>Lombardfin's difficulties have been public knowledge for
several weeks. But the situation worsened Friday when a group
of creditor banks was unable to agree to roll over loans that
Lombardfin had taken to help finance the acquisition of the
PAF stake.</p>
<p>The Varasi family's majority stake apparently leaves
Lombardfin's holding with little strategic value.</p>
<p>Bruno Pazzi, the newly appointed president of Consob, the
Milan stock market's regulatory body, has made it clear that
he regards a forced liquidation of the broker's portfolio as
a last resort, and would prefer that a compromise be reached.</p>
<p>PAF shares fell a further 3% to 4,900 lire ($4.29)
yesterday after shedding nearly 20% in panic selling Friday
on news of the impasse between Lombardfin and its banks.</p>
