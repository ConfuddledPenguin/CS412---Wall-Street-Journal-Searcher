	<p class="article-leader">LOS ANGELES -- Mark E. Buchman was named president and
chief executive officer of BKLA Bancorp and of its Bank of
Los Angeles subsidiary, succeeding Gerald S. Weisstein, who
has held those posts since 1985.
   Mr. Weisstein, 51 years old, said he was leaving because
"my contract is at an end," and "it's my desire to get into a
larger bank where the challenges might be a bit more
expansive." During his tenure, the bank's assets grew to
about $173 million from about $120 million, he said.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Mr. Buchman, 53, was president of the Government National
Mortgage Association during the last year of the Reagan
administration. After 20 years at Manufacturers Hanover Trust
Co., he held the post of executive vice president of Union
Bank in Los Angeles from 1982 to 1987.</p>
