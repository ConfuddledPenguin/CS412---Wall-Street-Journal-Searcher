	<p class="article-leader">Interco Inc. said it agreed in principle with its banks
and bondholders to a debt-restructuring plan that gives
bondholders the right to approve a new board for the troubled
company.
   Bondholders are understood to have pressed for board
representation as a condition of restructuring Interco's $1.9
billion in debt because they believe the company's problems
stem from actions taken by the current board. In late 1988,
the board approved an ill-fated recapitalization that fended
off the Rales brothers of Washington, D.C., but left the St.
Louis furniture and shoe company staggering under a heavy
debt load.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The company and the bondholders are expected to agree in
the next week or so on a new slate of directors. Wilbur Ross,
a Rothschild Inc. managing director who is advising
bondholders, said the group anticipates that Interco chairman
and chief executive officer Richard Loynd will remain in
those posts.</p>
<p>Mr. Loynd, who was named chief executive last year, said
the pact will resolve Interco's "burdensome" debt problems
and "will permit us to capitalize on the inherent strengths
of the core companies." Interco makes Lane and Broyhill
furniture and Converse and Florsheim shoes.</p>
<p>The agreement nevertheless appears to be a victory for
bondholders, who agreed to swap their so-called "junk"
securities for 95% of Interco's common stock. In May, Interco
proposed giving the bondholders an 81% stake in the company
and making no changes in the board.</p>
<p>A reverse stock split outlined in the agreement would
reduce the stake of current stockholders to 5% instead of the
10% Interco originally proposed.</p>
<p>Bondholders have generally shown more clout in
debt-restructuring talks lately. The latest financial rescue
plans for Southland Corp. and Western Union Corp. also would
put a dominant share of equity into the hands of bondholders
and other investors injecting fresh cash. That contrasts with
many debt-restructuring plans last year, such as SCI
Television Co.'s, in which bondholders got less than half the
company's equity.</p>
<p>The Interco agreement averts at least for now a
bankruptcy-law filing. Interco had threatened to seek
bankruptcy-court protection if it couldn't otherwise
restructure its debt.</p>
<p>A bankruptcy-law filing is still possible if the
debt-restructuring plan isn't approved by 95% of each class
of bondholders and a majority of current stockholders. But
the agreement increases the chances that Interco could pursue
a "prepackaged" bankruptcy, if necessary.</p>
<p>Under such an arrangement, any debt swap would require the
approval by holders of only two-thirds of each class of
bonds, eliminating thorny problems associated with holdout
bondholders and stockholders. Interco's advisers believe the
company could emerge from prepackaged bankruptcy proceedings
in six months or so -- a far shorter time than the two years
or more that most companies spend in court.</p>
<p>Interco said its banks agreed to forgo until February 1992
a $160 million repayment of principal, giving the company
more time to rebuild its finances. The agreement extends
payments on the $800 million in bank debt through 1998, with
the second payment of $60 million due in February 1994.
Interest payments are scheduled to resume in November.</p>
<p>The agreement calls for holders of medium-term notes that
predate the 1988 recapitalization to be paid on schedule.
These notes mature between 1991 and 1993.</p>
<p>The plan also calls for holders of Interco's 13 3/4%
senior subordinated debentures due in 2000 to receive stock
plus new 8.72% debentures and warrants to buy Interco shares
for $2 each. Holders of the company's subordinated discount
debentures due in 2003 would get stock and warrants while
holders of its 14 1/2% pay-in-kind debentures would get only
stock.</p>
<p>Interco's bonds rallied slightly on news of the latest
restructuring plan. The company's 13 3/4% senior subordinated
debentures were quoted by traders at R.D. Smith & Co. at 27
cents on the dollar, up a cent or two from Friday's levels.
The discount debentures were unchanged at five cents on the
dollar, while the 14 1/2% bonds were unchanged at four cents
on the dollar.</p>
