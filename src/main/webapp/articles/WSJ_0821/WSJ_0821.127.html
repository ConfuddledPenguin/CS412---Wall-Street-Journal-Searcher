	<p class="article-leader">OPEC rejected a call by Saudi Arabia and Venezuela for an
emergency meeting, leaving them free to pump more oil on
their own.
   The two had sought a meeting of the Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries to endorse a plan under which
they and other producers would increase output to avoid oil
shortages and runaway prices during the current Middle East
crisis.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The rejection of their bid was widely thought to mean that
Saudi Arabia will soon produce more oil anyway. The kingdom
had previously stated that it would do so if OPEC failed to
act. Venezuela is expected to follow suit.</p>
<p>A statement issued by OPEC's Vienna headquarters yesterday
said the request for a special meeting failed to get the
required support of a majority of OPEC's 13 member nations.
The statement added that Sadek Boussena, Algeria's oil
minister and OPEC president, would "meet some OPEC oil
ministers for consultations before the end of the month."</p>
<p>Despite the decision against an emergency session, both
Saudi Arabia and Venezuela still held out hope for some sort
of OPEC meeting quickly to consider their intention to
replace more than half the four million barrels a day of
Iraqi and Kuwaiti crudes lost to world oil markets. Also,
some others in OPEC who had voted against an immediate
emergency meeting appeared to be having second thoughts.</p>
<p>Last night, several oil ministers were trying to arrange
at least such an informal meeting, possibly by Friday. Their
goal is to provide some kind of OPEC "umbrella" for the
increased output, mainly to avoid the appearance of a
production free-for-all.</p>
<p>"The potential for a meeting of some sort, by at least six
or seven, is still there," said Bahman Karbassioun, a
Vienna-based consultant and former OPEC official. The idea
would be to "use OPEC's good offices" for the production
increases that are going to happen anyway "and not damage the
organization," he said.</p>
<p>In Caracas, meanwhile, Venezuelan President Carlos Andres
Perez was quoted by the government news agency as saying that
several OPEC nations with the potential to increase oil
production expect to meet in the next few days. And he said
Venezuela will increase its production "when there is an
accord within OPEC."</p>
<p>There wasn't any immediate official response from Saudi
Arabia to the rejection of the call for an emergency meeting.
But one Persian Gulf oil official close to developments
suggested that OPEC's "saying `no' to a conference means
saying `yes' to the idea that everybody can act on his own."</p>
<p>Hisham Nazer, Saudi Arabia's oil minister, had made clear
over the weekend that the kingdom, which has been producing
within its OPEC quota of 5.4 million barrels a day, would
shortly increase output by as much as two million barrels a
day with or without OPEC's approval. Among other reasons, Mr.
Nazer cited the damage to the economies of developing
countries from escalating oil prices. And he suggested
Venezuela and the United Arab Emirates would produce an
additional 500,000 barrels a day each, and urged others with
lesser spare capacity to help make up the lost four million
barrels a day.</p>
<p>Yesterday, President Bush applauded the Saudi decision.
White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said, "The president
notes that we are very pleased by the boost in world-wide
supply being provided by Saudi Arabia, and overall we believe
we have reasonably stable conditions with regard to oil
production and supply."</p>
<p>Oil prices, which have gained as much as $8 a barrel since
the Aug. 2 Iraqi invasion of Kuwait, had been expected to
level out this week on the basis of the Saudi public pledge
to increase production. Yesterday, crudes generally were
higher though the rate of climb did slow. Petroleum product
prices rose sharply as market worries centered on possibly
tighter fuel supplies. On the New York Mercantile Exchange,
unleaded gasoline for September delivery surged 4.28 cents to
settle at $1 a gallon.</p>
<p>Several OPEC nations remain strongly opposed to any change
that would pour more oil onto world markets at this time.
Iraq is among them. It vociferously objects to any OPEC
meeting designed to replace its blockaded oil. And its old
war foe Iran also is opposed to such a meeting.</p>
<p>Iran's oil revenues have increased sharply since Iraq
invaded Kuwait, and Iran not only has sold most of the oil it
had sitting in storage, but has received substantially higher
prices for the oil. Meanwhile, it is winning new customers on
long-term contracts in Japan who formerly purchased from
Iraq.</p>
<p>There are also several members of OPEC who maintain that
there isn't any need to increase production while oil
inventories, including government-stored crudes in major
consuming nations, remain high. Indonesia, usually a moderate
on oil prices, proposes that OPEC's ministerial
market-monitoring groups carefully study the supply and
demand situation before considering a full meeting.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, a meeting of the governing board of the
International Energy Agency that had been scheduled for
Thursday has been postponed until Aug. 31. The delegates to
the Paris-based agency are to consider the consuming nations'
possible responses to the oil-supply crunch. The governing
board first met earlier this month but concluded then that
conditions didn't warrant the use of the emergency
oil-sharing system or drawdowns of strategic oil stores.</p>
