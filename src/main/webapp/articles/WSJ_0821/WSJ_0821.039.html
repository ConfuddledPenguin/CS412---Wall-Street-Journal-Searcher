	<p class="article-leader">President Bush said for the first time that Americans and
other Westerners detained in Iraq and Kuwait are hostages,
thereby elevating their importance -- and the stakes -- in
his confrontation with Iraqi President Saddam Hussein.
   In a speech in Baltimore to the Veterans of Foreign Wars,
Mr. Bush said he had been "reluctant to use the term hostage"
in the past two weeks. "But," he said, "when Saddam Hussein
specifically offers to trade the freedom of those citizens of
many nations he holds against their will in return for
concessions, there can be little doubt that whatever these
innocent people are called, they are, in fact, hostages."</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Faced with few options to protect Americans in Kuwait and
Iraq, the President warned: "I will hold the government of
Iraq responsible for the safety and well-being of American
citizens held against their will."</p>
<p>Mr. Bush's rhetoric moved the U.S. a step closer to
hostilities with Iraq. By framing the issue so starkly, he
expanded the circumstances under which the U.S. would move
militarily against Baghdad -- and may have put himself in a
position in which he would be forced to react if harm comes
to Americans being detained.</p>
<p>Hours after Mr. Bush spoke, the State Department said in
Washington that at least 12 Americans who had been staying in
hotels in Kuwait, which Iraq invaded Aug. 2, "have been
relocated by the Iraqis" to an unknown destination. State
Department spokesman Richard Boucher said some of the U.S.
citizens "were taken with other, much larger groups of
foreigners."</p>
<p>They may be going to Baghdad," a U.S. official added,
"That's something we presume."</p>
<p>At least 35 other Americans in Kuwait were moved earlier
by the Iraqis, and their whereabouts remain unknown.</p>
<p>A European diplomatic source in Washington said that
groups consisting of about 20 Westerners from different
nations apparently were being rounded up in Kuwait by the
Iraqis and were being moved at frequent intervals. The source
said much of the information his government was receiving was
vague and difficult to verify. But he said, "Our feeling is
the process has begun. People are being picked up and moved
around."</p>
<p>Until now, the Bush administration had calculated that the
best chance for getting Americans and other Westerners out of
Iraq and Kuwait was to keep the spotlight off them and hope
that many could filter out or that an international
evacuation could be arranged quietly.</p>
<p>Mr. Bush had been hoping to avoid an Iran-style hostage
crisis, in which U.S. policy would become handcuffed by
public fixation on the status of civilians caught up in the
standoff between Baghdad and Washington. But the change in
tactics by Mr. Bush, which came after a Sunday night White
House strategy session between the president and his top
aides, was prompted by Iraq's declaration that foreigners
were going to be used as a "shield" protecting Iraq from U.S.
and other Western military forces.</p>
<p>According to Associated Press and Reuters reports, Iraq
said it had begun moving Western detainees to important
military sites that might become targets for U.S. bombs. The
reports quoted an Iraqi spokesman as saying, "Iraq's foreign
guests have been in fact moved to all vital and military
installations." U.S. officials were unable to confirm whether
the statement was accurate.</p>
<p>Saddam Hussein also warned diplomats in Kuwait that if
they fail to close their embassies in Kuwait they would lose
their diplomatic immunity and be treated as any other
foreigners. There are about 130 diplomats in the U.S. Embassy
in Kuwait.</p>
<p>Having chosen to focus on the hostages, Mr. Bush now faces
the same challenges that bedeviled former Presidents Carter
and Reagan in such circumstances. To satisfy Americans, he
will have to display concern for the hostages. Yet at the
same time, he will try to convince Saddam Hussein that he
won't back down from his demands or from his willingness to
use military might to enforce a United Nations trade embargo
on Iraq.</p>
<p>While the hostage issue seems to complicate Mr. Bush's
planning, there isn't any sign that he is backing away from
his goals or that he is trying to leave Saddam Hussein a
face-saving way out of the crisis. In his VFW speech, the
president declared that U.S. objectives remain the "complete,
immediate and unconditional withdrawal" of Iraq from Kuwait;
the restoration of the ousted Kuwaiti government, and the
"security and the stability of Saudi Arabia and the Persian
Gulf."</p>
<p>After his speech, Mr. Bush insisted that he wasn't
"turning up the heat" over the issue of detained Americans.
In remarks to reporters, he explained that he used the term
because Iraq linked freedom for the foreigners to a pullout
of U.S. and other troops from the region. Such demands "are
totally unsatisfactory to most countries in the world," Mr.
Bush said. "That can't stand."</p>
<p>Mr. Bush said that the showdown with Iraq could be long
and that tough decisions remain to be made. The president is
likely to make one such decision today, activating some
military reservists. Estimates of the size of such a call-up
have ranged as high was 200,000, but the White House
indicated the figure would be smaller.</p>
<p>In an apparent attempt to keep U.S. public opinion behind
his policy, Mr. Bush portrayed the growing U.S. presence in
the Gulf as a moral mission against aggression and an attempt
to defend U.S. friends, rather than a selfish effort to
protect the U.S. supply of cheap oil. In his 25-minute VFW
speech, his longest statement so far on the Gulf crisis, Mr.
Bush didn't mention the word "oil" once.</p>
<p>Separately, the administration expressed concern that the
mounting tensions in the Persian Gulf could spill over into
other parts of the Middle East. The State Department said it
was permitting nonessential embassy personnel and dependents
in Jordan to leave that country if they wished, and it
advised other Americans to consider doing the same.</p>
<p>An administration official explained that in view of
anti-U.S. demonstrations and Saddam Hussein's strong
influence in Jordan, "we're concerned about how the security
situation might evolve and decided it was appropriate to let
people leave."</p>
