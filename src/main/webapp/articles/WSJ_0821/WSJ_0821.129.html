	<p class="article-leader">WESTWOOD, Kan. -- United Telecommunications Inc. moved to
reorganize the sales and service operation of its troubled
long-distance telephone unit, US Sprint Communications Co.
   The revamping, which United Telecom said will cut 500
administrative jobs while adding "hundreds" of sales
positions, comes on the heels of a dismal second-quarter
showing by Sprint, the nation's third-largest long-distance
provider.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Sprint posted a $42 million operating loss for the period,
leading to a 55% profit drop for United Telecom and providing
a nasty shock for Wall Street analysts, who had expected a
much smaller decline. United Telecom stock plunged 23% on the
news to $29.50 a share and recently bottomed out in the $23
to $25 range.</p>
<p>As part of a previously announced plan to cut 1,000 jobs,
Sprint said it will refocus its National Markets operation,
cutting three of its five marketing and service groups. The
customers served by the three discontinued groups, which
handled accounts generating monthly billings between $2,000
and $10,000, will be split between the two remaining groups.
Those two groups, based in Atlanta and Kansas City, Mo.,
previously handled Fortune 1000 accounts and residential
customers.</p>
<p>Separately, William Esrey, United Telecom's chairman and
chief executive officer, said in an interview that despite
the recent decline in share price, the company isn't
considering buying back any of its stock.</p>
<p>Without naming any specific targets, Mr. Esrey said United
Telecom wants to retain its ability to use the stock in place
of cash in making acquisitions.</p>
<p>A company spokesman said no one, either from within the
company or from the investment community, has been lobbying
for a buy-back.</p>
