	<p class="article-leader">Operation PUSH, the Chicago-based civil-rights group,
declined to end its national boycott of Nike Inc. products
despite the company's announcement Friday of new
affirmative-action goals.
   The Beaverton, Ore., athletic apparel company's new goals
include naming a minority to the Nike board, increasing the
number of non-white department heads by 10% within 12 months
and naming a minority vice president within 24 months.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Rev. Tyrone Crider, director of PUSH, called Nike's goals
"inadequate." He repeated PUSH's demand that Nike use
minority-owned banks, advertising agencies and other service
companies.</p>
<p>"The boycott and blackout campaign against Nike has not
ended. In fact, our efforts have intensified," he said.</p>
<p>Operation PUSH has called for the boycott because it says
that Nike gets about 30% of its $2.4 billion of annual
revenue from black customers, but invests little in the black
community and has no high-level black employees.</p>
<p>Nike says it gets closer to 15% of its revenue from
blacks. It has defended its policies and has alleged that
PUSH has financial connections with rival athletic wear
company Reebok International Ltd. PUSH has denied the
allegation.</p>
<p>In over-the-counter trading yesterday, Nike shares closed
at $73.25, down $2.25.</p>
