	<p class="article-leader">GOTHENBURG, Sweden -- AB Volvo unveiled a new
top-of-the-line car model, the first in a spate of new models
planned by Swedish auto makers to fend off the imminent
incursion into Europe by Japanese car companies.
   Volvo said its new 900 series would be followed by the
launch of at least one other new model family by 1995.
Swedish archrival Saab Automobile AB -- in which General
Motors Corp. holds a 50% stake -- also plans to introduce
three new car models by the mid-1990s. The pace is unheard of
for the two Swedish companies, at which the traditional rate
of model debuts has been closer to one a decade.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>But officials at Volvo and Saab admit the lack of exciting
new cars has intensified a recent sales slump and caused both
to lose ground to more nimble rivals, such as Bayerische
Motoren Werke AG and Daimler-Benz AG. The German car giants
have replaced almost their entire model ranges in recent
years. For Volvo and Saab, the challenge of catching up will
be complicated further by the arrival in earnest of the
Japanese in Europe, the officials said.</p>
<p>Roger Holtback, president of Volvo's car division, warned
that intensifying competition from Japanese rivals promises
"to make Europe the auto industry's main battleground in the
1990s. We know that other Japanese companies will join Honda
Motor Co., Nissan Motor Co. and Toyota Motor Corp. in setting
up manufacturing operations in Europe," he said.</p>
<p>Volvo's response must be more frequent model changes,
despite the soaring costs of developing new models, Mr.
Holtback added. He also promised that the drive for growth in
Europe would steer design of new Volvo models. That strategy
addresses frequent criticism in Europe of Volvos for being
primarily styled for tastes in the U.S., the company's
biggest single market.</p>
<p>The European slant is apparent in the sleek, rounded lines
of Volvo's most luxurious 960 model, which breaks with the
boxy profile of Volvo's previous exclusive model, the
eight-year-old 760. But an even bigger surprise rests under
the hood -- a powerful 3-liter, six-cylinder engine which Mr.
Holtback compared favorably with high-performance engines of
any other European luxury-car maker.</p>
<p>Industry analysts agreed that the new engine probably
would be the first from Volvo muscular enough to earn serious
respect from performance-minded car buyers in central Europe.
But these analysts added that Volvo could have problems
cultivating a more performance-oriented image among European
car buffs without driving away existing customers.</p>
<p>Many Volvo buyers prize the company's image as an
ultra-safe family car with a quirky cachet and high resale
value. Reflecting that performance-safety balancing act,
Volvo equipped the 960 model with an elaborate built-in
child-restraint seat, which it said was a first for any car
maker.</p>
<p>As proof of how serious Volvo is about quicker model
changes, Mr. Holtback boasted that development of the new 900
series had been completed in just two years. But it cost a
hefty 2 billion Swedish kronor ($350 million). The new
model's engine and transmission were the first in a new
drive-train program that when completed will have swallowed
at least six years and an estimated 6 billion kronor, Mr.
Holtback suggested.</p>
<p>Moreover, the advent of the 900 series leaves Volvo with
five model families. According to Mr. Holtback "that's
obviously a broader product range than we need for the time
being. The message we're giving customers and dealers is that
in the coming five years we will reduce the number of model
families to three with more distinct profiles."</p>
<p>The 900 series will be one obvious survivor; so will the
the mid-size 400 series model produced by Netherlands-based
affiliate Volvo Car BV. Volvo is negotiating to acquire the
70% it doesn't already own of Volvo Car BV from the Dutch
government.</p>
<p>The third model is almost certain to be the 600 series, a
long-awaited successor to Volvo's big-selling, 25-year-old
200 series. Most analysts expect the 600 series to debut next
fall. Volvo refuses to discuss possible model changes in line
with company policy.</p>
<p>Whenever it comes, the 600 looms as a make-or-break
product decision, analysts said. Buoyant sales of the new
model will be necessary to meet Volvo's internal growth
target -- to 500,000 cars a year by 1996 from roughly 410,000
units now.</p>
<p>Costs of developing the new 900 and expected 600 models
have stretched Volvo, eating into the car division's
operating profit in recent years amid dwindling sales in
Sweden, the U.K. and the U.S. The three markets account for
70% of the company's sales.</p>
<p>Mr. Holtback predicted that by the mid-1990s, Volvo's
alliance with France's Renault "will kick in as an insurance
policy." He predicted that tighter links with Renault and
expanded Volvo manufacturing operations outside Sweden would
ensure a strong position in Europe. And joint development
work on major components would help both concerns bear the
skyrocketing costs of surviving the fierce competition
expected in Europe.</p>
