	<p class="article-leader">Although an overwhelming 72% of Americans back President
Bush's actions in the deserts of the Middle East, they're
less sure about his conduct in Kennebunkport, Maine.
   Only 53% approved of his taking time to vacation at his
seacoast home just now, with 39% disapproving, in a poll
taken over the weekend before the hostage drama escalated.
Television news has juxtaposed Mr. Bush playing golf with
poignant interviews with relatives of Americans presumably
being held hostage.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"I was saddened to see . . . Mr. Bush playing golf and
going fishing after having sent U.S. troops overseas," said
Lawrence Naumoff, 44, a Chapel Hill, N.C., novelist. "It was
a vision of the old-fashioned ugly American who doesn't
reflect on what his actions have caused."</p>
<p>However, Edith Seibert, a housewife from Hermitage, Pa.,
said, "His mind is much clearer up there {in Maine} without
everybody in Washington beating on him to make a military
strike."</p>
<p>Mr. Bush broke off his vacation for the second time
yesterday to meet with advisers in Washington, then returned
to Maine. The White House says that this is a working
vacation and that, thanks to sophisticated communications,
Mr. Bush can manage the nation's affairs as well in Maine as
in Washington.</p>
