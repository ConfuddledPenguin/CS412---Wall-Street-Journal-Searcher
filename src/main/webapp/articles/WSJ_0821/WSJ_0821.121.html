	<p class="article-leader">LOS ANGELES -- A previously sealed court document
indicates that the Justice Department decided not to pursue
at least 11 areas being looked at by criminal investigators
as part of a settlement agreement it signed last February
with Northrop Corp.
   As part of the deal, Northrop pleaded guilty to 34 counts
of falsifying test results on the air-launched cruise missile
and the Harrier jet. It also paid the government $17 million,
one of the largest penalties ever extracted from a defense
contractor.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>But the dropping of the criminal inquiries has miffed some
parties close to the matter, who contend that the government
gave away too much for too little. "We are extremely
disappointed," said Phil Benson, an attorney in the law
offices of Herbert Hafif. The firm, based in Claremont,
Calif., represents a number of employee whistle-blowers who
raised many of the allegations against Northrop.</p>
<p>It has been known for months that a number of criminal
investigations, including probes into some aspects of the
manufacturing of MX missile parts and the B-2 Stealth bomber,
had been terminated as a result of the settlement pact. But
the precise list of what federal prosecutors no longer were
pursuing was sealed, and the government sought to keep the
exhibit containing that information under wraps. The Los
Angeles Times and The Wall Street Journal moved to have the
document released, however, and it was finally made part of
the court file yesterday.</p>
<p>Mr. Benson said he was particularly irked that criminal
investigations into two matters weren't being continued. One
involves allegations that Northrop circumvented normal supply
channels and installed components from neighborhood stores
like Radio Shack into MX-missile guidance units. The other
involves contentions that the company wrongfully charged the
Air Force for equipment, known as the dry integrated test
system.</p>
<p>"The $17 million doesn't come close to compensating the
taxpayers for what the government gave away in this
settlement," Mr. Benson asserted. "The fate of these cases
were never allowed to be determined by a jury. They were
determined behind closed doors."</p>
<p>Northop has denied all wrongdoing.</p>
<p>William Fahey, the assistant U.S. attorney here who
negotiated the settlement, wasn't immediately available
yesterday. But Mark Richard, a senior Justice Department
official, testified before Congress last month that it was
decided to cease some investigations into Northrop only after
lengthy scrutiny.</p>
<p>In some cases, he said, it was determined that the statute
of limitations had expired. In others, experienced agents and
prosecutors had determined there was "insufficient evidence
of criminal fraud."</p>
<p>Northrop still remains the focus of two ongoing criminal
probes by the U.S. Attorney in Los Angeles, according to
Justice Department documents. But the portion of the exhibit
that spells out exactly which cases were being pursued by
that office as of February was redacted from the record by
the court.</p>
<p>In a March filing with the Securities and Exchange
Commission, Northrop itself disclosed that its work on a
flight-control mechanism on the B-2, known as the ARTs
system, was being examined. The company also said it was
being looked at with regard to two other, unidentified
investigations. Mr. Benson said he thought one of the cases
may be a probe into Northrop's receipt of payments for
building the ZSR-62, an avionics system on the B-2. The third
case may have had to do with tubing used on the Navy's F/A-18
fighter jet. But one of Northrop's outside attorneys received
a letter dated July 9 from the U.S. Attorney's office here
saying the company isn't currently "either a subject or a
target" of that probe.</p>
<p>Justice Department officials are quick to note that they
are also pressing to have Northrop sanctioned
administratively. And the department is also pursuing some
civil allegations. In certain cases, in fact, the government
is acting as co-plaintiff with Mr. Hafif's clients, who stand
to receive a portion of any monies recovered from Northrop.
Mr. Benson said that it is much harder to litigate a civil
case against the company, however, when there is no
collateral criminal investigation to help ferret out
evidence.</p>
<p>Even with the unsealing of the exhibit, it remains
somewhat fuzzy exactly which investigations have been
dropped. For instance, one part of the document says the
government won't pursue any allegations related to "the
`final report' matter at Northrop's B-2 division." Mr. Benson
said he didn't know what that referred to.</p>
<p>The exhibit also says that the government won't pursue
criminally any "allegations of improprieties and/or
illegalities" set forth in any of the whistle-blower cases
pending in U.S. District Court here. Mr. Benson said he
feared that language was overly sweeping.</p>
<p>The House Government Operations Committee is expected to
conduct a hearing in September that may explore further the
terms and circumstances of the settlement. The panel also
plans to raise questions about whether the cruise missile
will malfunction at low temperatures it is supposed to be
able to withstand. Also as part of the agreement in February,
the Justice Department dropped charges related to the
low-temperature issue, largely because the Air Force loosened
testing requirements, making a fraud case tough to prove.</p>
