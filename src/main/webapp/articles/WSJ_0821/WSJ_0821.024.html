	<p class="article-leader">DENVER -- United Artists Entertainment Co. said it
refinanced $2.8 billion in debt to attain greater financial
flexibility, lengthen the payback period and reduce principal
payments for the next three years.
   The operator of cable systems and movie theaters, which is
56%-owned by Tele-Communications Inc., said the new pact also
will give it "funding availability to pursue future
opportunities." The lead banks in the financing include
Chemical Bank, Bank of New York, Toronto Dominion and Societe
General.</p>
