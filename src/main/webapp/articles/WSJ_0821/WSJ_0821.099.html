	<p class="article-leader">The jury has spoken in the jogger case with a verdict that
underscores the disconnection between the common sense of the
people and the accepted wisdom of the political and
intellectual elites. The jury never considered that somehow
socioeconomic, racial or other factors could excuse the evil
committed on a woman by rampaging young men that night in New
York's Central Park. And to the degree that the punishments
are remarkably light, the fault lies not with the jury but
with the state's permissive criminal-justice system.
   The general outlines of the crimes are by now well known.
A group of some 30 teen-agers entered the park one evening in
April 1989. At least six robbed several passers-by, and
savagely beat and raped a then 28-year-old investment banker.
The jogger was so brutally attacked that she lost
three-quarters of her blood. One eyeball exploded in the back
of her head. Her white sweat shirt was left crimson. She was
bound in her own clothing and left for dead.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Descriptions of the jury deliberations make clear that the
jurors approached their task in a commonsense way. Jury
foreman Earle Fisher saw to it at the beginning that the
issue that monopolized attention outside the courtroom would
play no role in the jury room.</p>
<p>Mr. Fisher, a black law graduate, says, "One of the first
things the jury did was decide the very first statements out
of our mouths in that jury room would be whether we believed
race was an issue. The first thing we did in the jury room
was to decide whether or not this case had racial overtones,
and we decided it did not. That cleared the air." The jury
was made up of four blacks, four whites, three Hispanics and
one Asian.</p>
<p>We also do not believe, by the way, that race was the
major factor in the recent mixed-verdict trial of Washington
Mayor Marion Barry. We can understand a jury deciding to
convict Mr. Barry on one drug count because he was so
obviously guilty, but also deciding not to pile on. This was
a case against a political figure based on actions only
indirectly related to his official duties. The U.S. Attorney
was right to bring the case, but the jury crafted a rough
justice with a verdict to stop Mr. Barry from running for
re-election as mayor and stop him from claiming vindication.</p>
<p>The evident common sense of the jury in discounting the
race issue suggests how far much of the elite liberal culture
has drifted from the general public. Whenever one of these
events happens now, it immediately becomes the sole property
of politicians, poseurs, intellectuals and the media. It is
really quite striking to read in the verdict's aftermath how
many of the people interviewed in the defendants' own
neighborhood felt that a serious wrong had been committed and
deserved sanction. For the record, the last juror holding out
against conviction was a white male journalist.</p>
<p>The jury cannot be blamed for the light sentences. Many
states, including New York, treat criminals with adult-sized
bodies and pure evil intent as if they were merely
mischievous adolescents. This became relevant when the jury
convicted the teenagers of assault and rape but could not
find the required intent to convict on the attempted-murder
charge. The irony is that the punishment would not have been
any greater if the three had been convicted on the
attempted-murder charge. As juveniles, the maximum they can
serve is between five and 10 years. As adults, they would
have faced 16 to 50 years.</p>
<p>They are called "juveniles," but Yusef Salaam is 16 years
old, 6 feet 4 inches tall and 150 pounds. Raymond Santana is
15, 5 feet 5 inches and 135 pounds. Antron McCray is 16, 5
feet 4 inches and 135 pounds. Whether we call them juveniles
or adults, the 5-foot-5-inch, 105-pound jogger had no chance.
Indeed, one of the others they beat up that night was a
6-foot-4-inch former Marine.</p>
<p>Nor are the three bound for any serious prison. Juvenile
offenders in New York, even felons, still go to reform
schools. They will be supervised by a counselor and spend
seven hours a day in school. Most facilities have swimming
pools, several athletic fields and indoor gyms.</p>
<p>The same political culture that treats felons gingerly
because of their age has now spent the summer agitating that
the crime problem can be solved by extending New York's
strict gun-control laws nationally. The newspapers and
politicians peddling the argument that guns are the key to
the crime problem might spend a moment reviewing the weapons
used in Central Park. The jogger was attacked with (1) a
pipe, (2) a rock, (3) a stick, (4) a brick, (5) punching
fists and (6) kicking feet. No gun, automatic or manual,
imported or domestic.</p>
<p>The jogger jury had an immediate concern far removed from
racial politics or gun control. The jurors had to confront
the lawlessness that affects all big-city residents,
minorities most of all. The jury ultimately concerned itself
with the most basic questions of crime, punishment and civil
order. The jury repeated a central but too often fudged
lesson of our advanced civilization, that individuals who
commit evil acts must be punished.</p>
<p>The jury did its job. Now the political elites should
recognize that deterrence is an even better policy than
punishment alone. Justice requires preventing these kinds of
brutal acts from being committed in the first place. We will
know there is deterrence when criminals and citizens alike
are no longer surprised when wrongdoers are routinely
arrested, convicted and punished.</p>
