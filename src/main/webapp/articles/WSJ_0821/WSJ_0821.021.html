	<p class="article-leader">HERSTAL, Belgium -- Fabrique Nationale Herstal S.A., the
maker of Browning rifles and other small arms, outlined a
survival plan that hinges on obtaining an injection of about
13 billion Belgian francs ($408 million) and on a union
agreement to cut about 1,200 jobs in Belgium.
   Officials of FN, 76%-owned by Societe Generale de Belgique
S.A., also said the Persian Gulf conflict should boost its
sales moderately but was unlikely to turn around the
company's losses.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>FN has continued to suffer heavy losses this year, but
company officials declined to provide details before next
month. For 1989, FN had a loss of 2.1 billion Belgian francs
on sales of 21.14 billion Belgian francs.</p>
<p>The financing plan will be presented to shareholders at a
meeting Sept. 28. FN said the financing would include new
equity, cancellation of debt and other unspecified aid.</p>
<p>The plan also depends on an improvement in sales, but so
far this year, FN officials said, orders are too low to meet
the plan's assumptions. A company executive said it would be
"very, very difficult" to meet all the conditions of the
plan. He said FN could be broken up if the rescue plan fails.</p>
<p>A spokesman for Generale de Belgique, a Brussels-based
holding company, said it supported the rescue plan. But the
spokesman reiterated that Generale, which granted FN an
emergency loan of 1.5 billion Belgian francs last month,
won't continue to bankroll FN without support from the
unions, creditors, other shareholders and the government.</p>
