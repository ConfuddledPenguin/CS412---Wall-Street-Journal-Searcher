	<p class="article-leader">RANCHO CUCAMONGA, Calif. -- Data-Design Laboratories Inc.,
whose net loss widened in the latest quarter, said it might
have to redeem some debentures at a premium unless its
tangible net-worth position improves.
   In the fourth quarter ended June 30, Data-Design's net
loss nearly doubled, to $2.5 million, or 37 cents a share,
from $1.7 million, or 26 cents a share, a year earlier. Sales
rose 2.5%, to $23.5 million, compared with $22.9 million in
1989's fourth quarter.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Data-Design said it is likely that its tangible net worth
on Sept. 30 will be below $28 million, the level specified in
its agreement with holders of its 8.5% debentures. If the
same thing happens again Dec. 31, the company said, it will
have to redeem 10% of the debentures then outstanding at a
possible premium.</p>
<p>Alan Steel, Data-Design's chief financial officer, said
the company is hopeful about meeting the $28 million target
by year end. Still, "we're talking to our major bondholders
about loosening the requirement to give us a little more
leeway," he said.</p>
<p>For the full year, the company's net loss narrowed, to
$2.9 million, or 44 cents a share, compared with $12.2
million, or $1.82 a share, last year. Sales increased 1.6%,
to $91.2 million from $89.8 million.</p>
<p>Data-Design makes printed circuit boards for the computer,
communications and instrumentation industries.</p>
