	<p class="article-leader">The average American reader would be hard pressed to know
whether the U.S. troops in Saudi Arabia are about to face the
Middle East equivalent of Rommel's vaunted Afrika Corps or
those of his bumbling Italian allies. Thus far, the
commentary has leaned toward the alarmist. U.S. News & World
Report said on Aug. 13, "Iraq's huge tank army, operating in
open desert ideally suited to tank warfare, is a match for a
superpower." Other sources speak in wide-eyed awe of a
million "battle-hardened troops," supported by a massive
chemical weapons inventory, advancing under the protection of
planes flown, according to the Aug. 8 issue of the New York
Times, by "pilots whose skill and experience makes them the
most feared flyers in the Middle East."
   It's right to be cautious, but these press accounts sound
like descriptions of the Israeli army, not the Iraqi. Baghdad
fields a competent but limited extension of its mechanisms of
internal repression. This month marks only the second
anniversary of the formal end to the Iran-Iraq War -- a war
that was, in the words of strategic expert Lawrence Freedman
"a delicate balance of incompetence."</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>True, the Iraqis have amassed a significant military
machine. But it is a giant with feet of clay -- which is why
Saddam is resorting to hostage-taking.</p>
<p>-- Armor. Iraq has indeed "amassed 5,500 tanks, more than
Hitler had on the eve of the Nazi invasion of Poland" as U.S.
News reported, but at least 4,000 of those, according to the
International Institute for Strategic Studies, are outmoded
Soviet-made T-54/-55s and Chinese versions of the same tank.
Another 1,000 are Soviet T-62s, a better tank but one the
Israelis destroyed easily during the 1982 invasion of
Lebanon. Only the remaining 500 tanks can be classed as
modern types.</p>
<p>-- Troops. Nearly half of Iraq's 1 million men are
mobilized reservists. They and their regular army
counterparts had their hands full countering the poorly
trained and equipped Iranians. Even when fighting on their
own territory, Iraqi troops surrendered in relatively large
numbers when the need (or opportunity) arose. Refugee reports
from Kuwait have not indicated a dramatic improvement in
troop morale or competence (though loot and rape have
apparently raised more than a few spirits).</p>
<p>-- Chemical weapons. Iraq's substantial chemical inventory
has been used principally against unprepared troops and
unprotected civilians. It is a defensive weapon of limited
utility against a well-prepared, mobile foe. The Iranians
were able to counter it with masks and sometimes even wetted
handkerchiefs.</p>
<p>-- Airpower. The Iraqi air arm turned in a decidedly
lackluster performance during the Iran-Iraq War. They were no
match for the Iranians in dogfights, and their close air
support of ground troops was largely ineffective. David Evans
and Richard Company, active duty U.S. officers writing in the
November 1984 issue of the Atlantic monthly, observed, " . .
. Iraqi pilots have dropped most of their bombs from 25,000
feet -- 24,000 feet too high for the pinpoint accuracy needed
to destroy tanks and artillery batteries." Iraqi pilots
improved -- but not by much -- as the war went on and the
Iranians proved unable to overcome their spare parts
shortages.</p>
<p>In the Iran-Iraq war, the Iraqi army had difficulty
coordinating a limited advance against a weak, unprepared
foe. Time and again during the conflict, Baghdad displayed
shortcomings in military leadership that crippled its forces.
The overcentralized chain of command failed to make even the
most mundane tactical decisions in a timely and advantageous
manner. Inter-service and inter-arms coordination was
rudimentary. When success was achieved -- in one notable
engagement, the Iraqis were able to decimate a poorly
deployed Iranian armor division in a massive ambush conducted
from defensive positions -- the officers responsible were not
rewarded but shunted to the side, or even liquidated
outright.</p>
<p>To Saddam Hussein, the military is a tool of repression
and threat. Military competence, if allowed to go too far,
would threaten his own position. So he deals with it in ways
reminiscent of Josef Stalin, who decimated his officer corps
on the eve of World War II. Only gradually, using time and
space, was Moscow able to rebuild a functioning military
machine. Saddam Hussein will have less time and less space.</p>
<p>Saddam Hussein's military weakness has been compounded by
intelligence failure. The general form of Western, especially
U.S., response to an invasion of Kuwait was predictable. Iraq
had to act fast before the Americans arrived. Yet Saddam
repeated his costliest error of the Iran-Iraq War, when his
troops sat still after they reached their initial objectives.
The Iranians regrouped and drew the Iraqis into protracted
warfare.</p>
<p>Saddam's Kuwait blunder may be even bigger. He picked the
most inappropriate time for an attack. A year ago, America
faced more strategic constraints from the Soviets. A year
from now, American forces may not be so numerous,
well-trained or well-equipped.</p>
<p>Then, he bungled operationally. Halting after grabbing
Kuwait has provided the U.S. and its allies time for
reinforcement. And tactically, Iraq is in a lot of trouble.
The U.S. military has rebounded from its low point in the
waning days of the Vietnam War. It is a force constructed for
a war of movement. Its leadership, down through brigade
level, are "battle-hardened" too -- in the Vietnam War. Its
capabilities will be magnified by the complete control of the
air and seas it can expect to enjoy.</p>
<p>Speculation concerning the need to break through Iraqi
defenses (at heavy cost) is misplaced. Kuwait will not be
liberated by slugging through that oil-rich chunk of land,
but rather by using U.S. mobility to strike across Iraqi
lines of communications toward the only strategic target of
consequence to the dictatorship, Baghdad, the Iraqi capital.</p>
