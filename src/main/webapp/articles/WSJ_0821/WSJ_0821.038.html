	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- The dollar ended mixed in thin trading as
dealings focused on cross, or non-dollar, activity. The yen
gained and the Swiss franc declined, switching their recent
roles as leading and lagging currencies.
   Yesterday's results represented no shifts in investor
sentiment, but, rather, a light market's natural tendency to
consolidate when faced with a lack of political and economic
news on which to trade the dollar.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Instead, Saudi Arabia's confirmation that it would make up
half of the oil production lost from Kuwait and Iraq was seen
as a good excuse to take profits on short, or oversold, yen
positions by buying the Japanese unit against European
currencies.</p>
<p>The weakening of European units, along with the improved
oil-supply picture, encouraged some independent dollar
buying, cushioning its decline against the yen.</p>
<p>Once put in the mood to level holdings, foreign exchange
investors chose to sell the Swiss franc against more than
just the yen. As a result, the generally well-bid safe-haven
currency put in the worst performance among major currencies
yesterday.</p>
<p>The yen-mark cross rate served as the barometer for
trading in all three world markets. By the time London
closed, North American dealers had already given up on
achieving any significant dollar movements and instead
focused on swinging the greenback just enough to push the
mark below support at 94 yen and keep it there.</p>
<p>The break occurred right after the European market closed
down. The mark was last quoted in New York trading yesterday
at 93.66 yen, well below 95.23 yen late Friday.</p>
<p>By that time, the dollar was changing hands at 146.44 yen,
down from 147.58 yen previously. The pound and Swiss franc
closed at 280.35 yen and 113.09 yen, respectively, down from
283.83 yen and 115.13 yen Friday.</p>
<p>In early trading in Tokyo Tuesday, the dollar was quoted
at 147.38 yen, down from 147.47 at the close there Monday.
Meanwhile, the dollar was at 1.5658 marks.</p>
<p>The market was "keeping an eye on what's coming out of the
Mideast" Monday but saw little of note, said Peter Connelly,
foreign-exchange manager for Wells Fargo Bank in San
Francisco. As a result, "the yen had a chance to catch up."</p>
<p>By the end of global trading in New York, the dollar had
settled at 1.5650 marks, up from 1.5495 marks late Friday in
New York.</p>
<p>The U.S. unit also rose to 1.2964 Swiss francs from 1.2830
francs late Friday. The mark and pound rose to 0.8282 franc
and 2.4789 francs, respectively, from 0.8271 franc and 2.4653
francs previously.</p>
<p>Replacing the Swiss franc yesterday as the strongest
European performer was the British pound. Though it was lower
against the U.S. unit by the end of New York trading -- at
$1.9135, compared with $1.9225 late Friday -- the pound had
climbed to 2.9931 marks from 2.9807 marks.</p>
<p>A value of three marks is thought to be the British
government's target level for entry into the exchange rate
mechanism of the European Monetary System.</p>
<p>The pound's gains were all the more remarkable since many
investors entered the weekend with long sterling positions.
In recent months, market players have protected themselves
from a surprise Saturday or Sunday ERM entry by buying
sterling on Fridays and selling it on Mondays.</p>
<p>But the second half of the operation was skipped this
time. ERM speculation was given a boost over the weekend by
British news reports focusing on entry as early as next
month. The days prior to the European Community's
intergovernmental conference in December were also mentioned
as a likely entry time.</p>
<p>News that Iraq moved its Western hostages into military
installations as a shield against a U.S. attack, coupled with
a tongue-lashing of the Iraqi invaders by President Bush,
gave the dollar a lift soon after noon in New York.</p>
<p>"No one wants to be short dollar for long" during the Gulf
crisis, said Robin Cheung, a vice president with Unibank in
New York.</p>
<p>A dollar sell-off yesterday was forestalled by the general
opinion that today's credit-policy setting Federal Open
Market Committee meeting won't produce a vote for easier
money.</p>
<p>On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for current
delivery settled at $410.10 an ounce, up 50 cents. Estimated
volume was a heavy five million ounces.</p>
<p>In early trading in Hong Kong Tuesday, gold was quoted at
$410.45 an ounce.</p>
