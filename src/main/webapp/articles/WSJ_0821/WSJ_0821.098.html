	<p class="article-leader">Computer Associates International Inc. said it will buy
back as many as 15 million shares, or about 8% of its common
stock, on the open market.
   A disappointing revenue and earnings forecast July 12
knocked nearly 40% off the giant software company's indicated
value. Yesterday, Computer Associates stock rose 75 cents in
composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange, to close at
$7.125 -- still 56.8% below its July 11 closing price of
$16.50.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The Garden City, N.Y., company's president, Anthony Wang,
said he considered the company's shares a good value. "We've
done many software acquisitions in years past, and very
seldom have we had the chance to buy a company at less than
one times revenue," he said.</p>
<p>At its closing price Friday, Computer Associates had an
indicated market value slightly below its revenue of $1.3
billion for the fiscal year ended March 31.</p>
<p>Computer Associates, once a high-flier in the computer
industry, hit the wall a year ago because of trouble handling
a large acquisition. In recent months, the company had
reported that those problems were behind it and restored some
of its credibility.</p>
