	<p class="article-leader">AMMAN, Jordan -- Although guns remain holstered in the
Persian Gulf, analysts in Jordan are writing obituaries for
certain players. Counted among the dead are U.S. influence in
the region and the stability of the Jordanian state.
   "Whatever happens, America is finished in the Middle
East," says Taher Masri, a former Jordanian foreign minister
and leading member of Parliament. Mr. Masri, one of the most
moderate and articulate voices in Amman, outlines a lose-lose
scenario for the U.S.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>If Iraqi President Saddam Hussein weathers the crisis, Mr.
Masri says, his prestige and power will be so great that such
current foes as Egypt and Saudi Arabia will fall into line,
through fear of Iraq or of their own populations. Saddam
Hussein is seen extending his hegemony in Yemen and Jordan,
giving him a choke point on the Red Sea and a long border
with Israel. "He will be a Gamel Nasser with teeth," Mr.
Masri says.</p>
<p>If Saddam Hussein is defeated or deposed, Jordanians see
dire consequences for the U.S. A man widely perceived by the
Arab masses as a "nationalist hero" will have been martyred
by "Western imperialism," Mr. Masri says, and "the gap
between Arab leaders and their people -- already wide -- will
become even wider." Wrath now directed at the U.S. will be
discharged at home, threatening many regimes.</p>
<p>Mr. Masri and other analysts have no doubt who will
benefit: fundamentalists, terrorists and radical Arab
nationalists. "The U.S. may clobber Saddam," says one source
close to the palace, "but it won't be left with many regimes
in the region to defend." Analysts say that the large
Palestinian population in Gulf states, particularly Saudi
Arabia, could become a vehicle for terror and instability.</p>
<p>Asad Abdul Rahman, a member of both the Arab Organization
for Human Rights and the Palestine National Council, thinks
the damage already has been done to the U.S. and its allies.
"A moderate like myself can no longer even talk about ethics
or international law," he says. "Arab dignity is all anyone
cares about."</p>
<p>He believes most Arabs have accepted that Saddam Hussein
likely will lose. But even if the odds are three to one
against Iraq, "Arabs still say, `I'll take my chances,'" he
says. "The attitude is, `Let him die, let us all die, but at
least someone stood up to the U.S.'"</p>
<p>Saddam Hussein's defeat would only deepen this nihilism
and anger, Mr. Rahman believes. "All America would win is the
enmity of millions of Arabs. It might take a few years, but
the fallout will be turmoil and terror."</p>
<p>Passion already is near the breaking point in Amman. When
a leading imam tried to justify Saudi Arabia's stance in a
sermon, he was booed out of the pulpit -- a show of
disrespect that Jordanians say is almost unheard of in Amman.
Pro-Iraq rallies continue daily, and trucks of riot police
are posted by the U.S. Embassy and at major intersections.
Two conscripts in the Jordanian army infiltrated the
Israeli-occupied West Bank, apparently on their own
initiative. One was killed and the other captured.</p>
<p>A Westerner working for a government agency returned from
vacation to find his co-workers doing nothing but arguing
politics. "Twenty percent want to flee Jordan," he says, "and
the other 80% want to go to holy war."</p>
<p>This feverish pro-Iraq sentiment creates what one
ambassador in Amman calls "the king's conundrum." If King
Hussein accedes to Western pressure and imposes trade
sanctions on Iraq, "the anger at home would be off the
screen," the diplomat says. But if the king defies the U.S.
and supports Baghdad, he will incur isolation abroad and
economic ruin at home, possibly within several months. "The
king," says the ambassador, "is really facing the crunch."</p>
<p>The Gulf crisis is a triple hit to Jordan's stumbling
economy. Remittances from the 300,000 or more Jordanians
working in Kuwait have been made almost worthless, and the
future of Jordanians working in other Gulf states is in
doubt. Economic aid from Kuwait is gone, and other Gulf
states are likely to repay Amman for its support of Baghdad
by ending their aid as well. And traffic at the port of
Aqaba, from which goods are trucked to Iraq, is dwindling
fast as suppliers stop loading goods bound for Iraq.</p>
<p>If Jordan cuts off the rest of its trade with Iraq, "the
economy would effectively come to a standstill," says the
king's brother, Crown Prince Hassan. Jordan sends 25% of its
exports to Iraq and receives 90% of its oil from Baghdad, for
free as repayment for credits that Amman extended during the
Iran-Iraq war. If this trade were halted, bankers say Jordan
would be unable to service its foreign debt of $9 billion,
and unemployment could soar.</p>
<p>Cutting trade with Iraq is even less palatable
politically. "The king would be perceived as stabbing Saddam
and the Arab cause in the back," says one Western diplomat.
One sign of sensitivity about the king's image is the return
of censorship after months of emerging democracy and freedom
of the press in Jordan. Issues of Time magazine arrived on
Amman newstands this weekend with several pages cut out. The
censored material included a phrase saying that King Hussein
is "known locally for having `changed his skin a million
times.'"</p>
<p>This chameleon quality has helped the king survive
repeated threats during his 37-year reign. And in recent
weeks, he has been at it again, standing by Iraq in one
breath and hedging his support in the next. He didn't condemn
Iraq's invasion of Kuwait, but he didn't recognize the
Iraqi-installed government, either. He says Jordan will
comply with United Nations trade sanctions, but says study of
the details still is needed -- and in the meantime, trucks
continue to roll across the Iraqi border.</p>
<p>But as tensions in the Gulf heighten each day, the king
may have to take a stand. Few here doubt that he will stick
with Saddam Hussein, forgoing Western aid and risking a
blockade of Aqaba.</p>
<p>Jordanians say they would rather starve than switch sides.
Digging his fingers into a traditional weekend lunch of lamb,
rice and nuts, Nasser Lattouf reminds a Western visitor that
"our grandparents lived for centuries on milk and dates." The
pharmacist adds, "a little hunger will just make us feel
we're contributing to Saddam's struggle."</p>
