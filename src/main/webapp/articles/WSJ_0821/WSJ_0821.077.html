	<p class="article-leader">Two years back, the Roy Rogers fast-food chain irked lunch
ladies everywhere with a commercial tweaking school-cafeteria
food and the dough-faced ladies who serve it, to the tune
"See You in September."
   The ads worked better than any Roy Rogers commercials
before -- but the chain, with tail between its legs, pulled
them after complaints by the American School Food Service
Association, the group that represents lunch ladies.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Last week, though, Roy Rogers and its new owner, Hardee's
Food Systems, defiantly trotted out the commercial again.
"We're sorry if any group is offended by this . . . {but}
it's a fun commercial that's done in good taste. We told {Roy
Rogers} to go ahead and run it," declared John Merritt, a
Hardee's senior vice president, yesterday morning.</p>
<p>Yet after just five days on the air, it looks like deja vu
at Roy Rogers. By yesterday afternoon, after much conferring
behind closed doors, the chain announced that it was pulling
the ad -- again.</p>
<p>The reason? The lunch ladies revolted -- again. "We were
livid that the ads came back. We thought they had been sent
to the advertising graveyard," says a spokesman for the
School Food association.</p>
<p>A humbled Mr. Merritt late yesterday explained that the
company reversed its decision because of "the bigger issue of
the role of food service in the American system." In other
words, enough abuse, already: "We {fast-food purveyors} are
already wrongfully blamed for a lot of the country's ills,
including global warming and the premature aging of the
adolescent population."</p>
<p>Ironically, for all the fuss the commercial is raising,
Mr. Merritt says it wasn't resurrected as a publicity stunt,
but because it sold sandwiches and was a lot cheaper than
producing a new spot. The ad shows beefy cafeteria marms
shoving plateloads of stomach-churning, unidentifiable fare
toward the camera. "You know what September means," warns the
voiceover.</p>
<p>By pulling the spot, Roy Rogers joins the ranks of other
American advertisers who have caved in to pressures from
interest groups. Not that those groups have had much of an
impact on sales; last year Clorox and Mennen emerged
unscathed from boycotts launched by the Rev. Donald Wildmon,
who charged that the companies bought air time on
"questionable" TV shows. Still, many advertisers now kowtow
to their attackers, apologize profusely and promise never to
repeat their sins.</p>
<p>But the situation at Roy Rogers is an especially odd one,
considering the company has lived through it -- almost word
for word -- before.</p>
<p>The first time around, in 1988, Roy Rogers's then-owner,
Marriott Corp., decided to pull the ads after the
food-service group threatened to boycott its hotels. After
the ads were pulled, the group insisted Marriott didn't move
quickly enough -- and boycotted anyway.</p>
<p>This time, Roy's new attitude came from Hardee's, which
bought the fast-food chain from Marriott with plans to
convert the Roy Rogers outlets into Hardee's restaurants. As
the Roy Rogers chain shrinks, less attention is paid to its
marketing functions -- and less money is spent on its ads,
making the popular lunch-ladies ad seem like a sure-fire
winner.</p>
<p>Considering Roy Rogers continues to exist only in a
handful of markets in the East, Hardee's didn't think anyone
would raise much of a fuss over a two-year-old commercial,
Mr. Merritt says.</p>
<p>At the ad agency that created the spot, Washington-based
Earle Palmer Brown Cos., executives say they are confounded
by the whole turn of events. "Look, these people are totally
overreacting," says Mark Goldstein, the agency's president,
who says he still doesn't know what spot Roy's will run after
"Lunch Ladies" takes its final bow Friday.</p>
<p>"I have very fond memories of the women who worked in the
cafeteria at my elementary school," he says. "The women in
this commercial remind me of them. When you're eight years
old, those women look bigger than you, they look older than
you . . . and they're strict]"</p>

<p>WHO'S NEWS: Earl Gandel was named executive vice
president, international, at Saatchi & Saatchi DFS/Pacific.
He was formerly chairman of Saatchi & Saatchi in Japan.</p>
<p>NEW ACCOUNTS: Arnell/Bickford Associates Marketing, New
York, said it picked up a number of accounts, including
foreign clothing makers Byblos and Chevignon, as well as
assignments from existing clients Bausch & Lomb and Donna
Karan. Peter Arnell, the shop's executive creative director,
said the assignments together bill about $25 million.</p>
