	<p class="article-leader">A federal jury in Mineapolis found three former Northwest
Airlines pilots guilty of flying while under the influence of
alcohol.
   The trial is apparently the first prosecution under a 1986
federal law that prohibited substance abuse by
commercial-transport employees. The three men -- Norman Lyle
Prouse, Robert Kirchner and Joseph Balzer -- each face a
maximum penalty of 15 years in jail and a $250,000 fine.
Sentencing is expected next month.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The three pilots didn't contest that they had consumed
numerous drinks at a North Dakota bar several hours before
they flew a jetliner with 91 passengers to Minneapolis.
Federal officials, acting on a tip from a bar patron,
arrested the three at the end of the March 8 flight.</p>
<p>Northwest Airlines, a subsidiary of NWA Inc., fired the
three men for violating a company rule that prohibits
ingesting alcohol within 12 hours of a flight.</p>
<p>In his instructions to jurors last week, U.S. District
Judge James Rosenbaum said that any impairment, however
slight, would constitute a violation under the federal
statute. If they found no impairment, however, the jury was
free to find the pilots not guilty -- despite the blood
tests, taken at the end of the flight, which showed alcohol
levels ranging from 0.06% to 0.13%.</p>
<p>The pilots argued at trial that they weren't impaired, and
cited the perfect flight as proof. One pilot, Mr. Prouse, had
contended that because he had a long history of alcoholism,
he was inured to a greater extent than most people to the
effects of alcohol.</p>
<p>An attorney for Mr. Prouse said there was "virtually no
evidence that any of {the pilots'} actions in operating the
flight were impaired," as the judge's instructions required
the government to prove. An appeal of the conviction is
likely, he said, on a number of issues, including the
validity of the citizen's arrest made by a Federal Aviation
Administration official. Attorneys for the other two
defendants couldn't be reached for comment.</p>
<p>In their arguments, neither the prosecutor nor the
attorneys for the defendants mentioned to the jury a clause
in the federal law that says pilots are presumed to be
impaired when their blood-alcohol level is above 0.10%. That
would have apparently nearly guaranteed at least one
conviction. But Assistant U.S. Attorney Elizabeth de la Vega,
who prosecuted the case, said in an interview that she wasn't
convinced that portion of the statute could withstand a
constitutional challenge.</p>
<p>In the end, the presumption clause wasn't needed, she
said, because of scientific experts' testimony about the
effect of alcohol on performance. "In a way, science was on
trial," Ms. de la Vega said.</p>

<p>MANVILLE TRUST hires a public relations firm.</p>
<p>Amid mounting criticism of its huge cash shortage, the
Manville asbestos personal-injury trust recently hired a
public-relations firm, Robinson, Lake, Lerer & Montgomery, to
help improve its public image.</p>
<p>Robinson Lake, which represents Michael Milken and other
well-known clients, is working for the trust on a $10,000
monthly retainer with a $15,000 cap on total monthly
spending. Since early June, the firm's work for the trust has
cost about $30,000, said Marianna S. Smith, the trust's
executive director.</p>
<p>Ms. Smith said the trust decided to hire the firm to help
respond to negative publicity about the trust's cash
shortage. After the trust announced earlier this year that it
was unable to pay current asbestos personal-injury claimants
for more than 20 years, it came under harsh criticism in the
courts for failing to come up with adequate financing.
Although the trust had expected to temporarily have
insufficient cash to pay claims, the shortage came much
sooner and was much worse than expected. It is estimated that
the cash shortage will be $30 million by March 31, 1991.</p>
<p>The assets of the trust, formed as part of Manville
Corp.'s 1986 bankruptcy-court reorganization, consist mainly
of Manville stock, which went down in price as the trust came
under criticism.</p>
<p>"When the bad publicity came out, what we saw was that our
asset base was being negatively affected," Ms. Smith said.
She said the trust hired Robinson Lake for advice in
improving the trust's image and preserving the value of the
assets.</p>
<p>But some plaintiffs' attorneys reacted with surprise and
disappointment at the hiring of outside public-relations
counsel.</p>
<p>"At a time when everyone is worried about the trust
running out of money and whether victims will be left without
compensation, for the trust to spend $120,000 a year on PR
seems to be an improper use of the funds," said Stanley Levy,
one of the major attorneys for asbestos victims and a
director of Manville Corp. The trust is independent of the
company.</p>
<p>U.S. Judge Jack B. Weinstein, the federal judge in
Brooklyn who has authority over all matters arising out of
the Manville bankruptcy case, has ordered the trust to
restructure its financing by Sept. 6. The judge has said that
operating expenses at the trust can be trimmed substantially.</p>
<p>The hiring of Robinson Lake was brought to Judge
Weinstein's attention yesterday, according to one of the
judge's law clerks. A few weeks ago the judge issued a
freeze, which has been extended to Sept. 6, on the trust's
payment of settlements. The freeze allows the trust to
continue making "necessary" payments to staff and operating
expenses, but it is unclear whether it applies to paying an
outside public-relations firm.</p>
<p>In defending the trust's retention of Robinson Lake, Ms.
Smith compared the cost to the amount the trust pays in its
average asbestos settlement, $43,231. Although the retainer
is $10,000 a month, she says the trust expects to pay less
than that amount monthly.</p>
<p>Ms. Smith also said the trust might not require the firm's
services for very long. Robinson Lake's Washington office is
working for the trust on a month-to-month basis. Robinson
Lake declined to comment.</p>
<p>Donald M. Blinken, a trustee of the trust, said Robinson
Lake was hired because "we had been very low-key. It was time
for the trust to explain what it has been doing and why."</p>
<p>A spokeswoman for the trust said Robinson Lake is mainly
providing behind-the-scenes advice in dealing with the press.
The firm will not be dealing directly with the news media,
nor will it advise the trust on legal strategy and financing,
she said.</p>
<p>She said the trust wants Robinson Lake's help in improving
its public image so that asbestos claimants will "have
confidence that we're acting for them." Most asbestos victims
are former construction workers and shipbuilders who were
exposed to asbestos on the job years ago. Asbestos, once
widely used in insulation, causes respiratory ailments and
cancer.</p>

<p>BOEING SETTLES suit alleging injury from electromagnetic
radiation.</p>
<p>Attorneys for Robert Strom, a former employee who brought
the class action suit, said Boeing Co. had agreed to pay more
than $500,000 in cash and to purchase an annuity for Mr.
Strom and his family.</p>
<p>Mr. Strom had alleged that he contracted terminal leukemia
after being exposed to dangerous levels of electromagnetic
radiation while working as an electrical technician for the
Seattle company. Settlement of the case, brought as a class
action on behalf of more than 700 past and present Boeing
workers, also calls for Boeing to provide medical monitoring
of the workers for 10 years. All the class members also
retain the right to seek compensation in the future.</p>
<p>The settlement is likely to add more fuel to the growing
controversy over the potential health hazards of
electromagnetic energy given off by power lines and a variety
of electrical household appliances. Some studies have
suggested links between cancer and exposure to such
radiation, but no firm conclusions have been established.</p>
<p>Litigation brought by property owners worried about the
effect of power lines on their land values has been
increasing, but the Strom case is one of the few suits to
allege personal injury, and to produce a public settlement.
Mr. Strom said he was exposed to electromagnetic radiation
while working on a Boeing project designed to determine how
communications systems are affected by blasts of electrical
energy, such as that given off in nuclear explosions. He also
accused Boeing of using workers as human medical research
subjects, testing the effects of exposure to electromagnetic
radiation.</p>
<p>Michael Withey, a Seattle attorney who helped represent
Mr. Strom, believes the settlement provides a foundation for
similar suits in the future. "I think there's going to be
massive litigation," said Mr. Withey, an attorney in the
Seattle firm of Schroeter, Goldmark and Bender. He was one of
several attorneys handling the case on behalf of Trial
Lawyers for Public Justice, a Washington, D.C., organization
that filed the suit.</p>
<p>A Boeing spokesman declined to comment on the terms of the
settlement, noting that it is still subject to final approval
by a state court judge in Seattle. He noted that Boeing
continues to deny any wrongdoing in the matter.</p>

<p>TWO LAWYERS are indicted for allegedly falsely claiming
they could bribe officials.</p>
<p>A federal grand jury in Tampa, Fla., indicted Jerome C.
Berlin and Anthony V. Labozzetta on charges of conspiracy and
fraud in connection with an alleged scheme in which they took
funds from a fraud-riddled Florida securities firm on the
premise that they could win favorable treatment from
regulators to allow the company to continue operating in
exchange for cash payments.</p>
<p>Mr. Labozzetta, of New York, and Mr. Berlin, of Miami, are
accused of falsely representing to G.I.C. Government
Securities Inc. in Tampa that they could curry favor with
Gerald C. Lewis, the Florida Comptroller, who regulates
banking and securities, and a U.S. senator. According to one
attorney involved in the case, the senator referred to is
Albert Gore of Tennessee.</p>
<p>The U.S. attorney in Tampa said the defendants' alleged
claims that they could peddle influence and make bribes for
favorable treatment of G.I.C. were entirely false.</p>
<p>In a statement, Mr. Lewis said, "I have been victimized by
the use of my name in an apparent case of con men conning the
con men." Neither Sen. Gore nor a spokesman could be reached
late yesterday.</p>
<p>Mr. Labozzetta and his attorney, Leonard Sands, also
couldn't be reached for comment.</p>
<p>Neal Sonnett, an attorney for Mr. Berlin, a Miami
businessman who infrequently practices law, said the charges
were completely without merit. "Jerry Berlin is an honest and
ethical lawyer and businessman who hasn't done anything
wrong," Mr. Sonnett said, adding that Mr. Berlin had taken a
lie detector test four years ago showing the charges to be
false.</p>
<p>The indictment alleges, among other things, that in 1985,
Mr. Labozzetta misrepresented to Lonnie O. Kilpatrick,
then-president and chief executive officer of G.I.C., that he
could influence decisions of political officials and
regulators by funneling them money through Mr. Berlin,
painted as an active political fund-raiser who had close
connections to and influence with various officials. Mr.
Berlin is alleged to have joined in the scheme.</p>
<p>The now-defunct, G.I.C. eventually filed for
bankruptcy-law protection in October 1985, leaving numerous
investors with millions of dollars in losses, and Mr.
Kilpatrick was subsequently convicted of multiple charges of
fraud in Tampa.</p>

<p>MORGAN & FINNEGAN, an 80-lawyer New York firm specializing
in intellectual property law, opened a Washington office. The
branch is run by Frederick F. Calvetti, who serves on an
of-counsel basis with the firm. Mr. Calvetti was formerly a
partner in the Alexandria, Va., law firm of Stevens, Davis,
Miller & Mosher. Arnold I. Rady, a member of Morgan &
Finnegan's executive committee, says that at least one of the
law firm's New York partners will move to Washington. He said
the new office will service domestic and foreign clients.</p>
