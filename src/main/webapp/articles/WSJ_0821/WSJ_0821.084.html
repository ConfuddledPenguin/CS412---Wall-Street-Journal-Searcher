	<p class="article-leader">An attempt to have Eastern Airlines and its former sister
airline, Continental, declared a single carrier for labor
bargaining fizzled last week, more than two years after it
began.
   The parent of the two airlines, Continental Airlines
Holdings Inc., ultimately won in its attempt to have the move
dropped, but only because it lost control of Eastern four
months ago. In April, a bankruptcy judge ousted Continental
Holdings -- previously known as Texas Air Corp. -- and
appointed a trustee to run Eastern. Continental Holdings
retains control of Continental Airlines.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The National Mediation Board, the federal agency that
oversees airline labor relations, cited the trustee
appointment as the reason for the ruling last Friday.</p>
<p>The mediation board said, however, it would let the unions
refile their requests if the bankruptcy court approves a
reorganization plan for Eastern that involves any form of
control by Continental Holdings.</p>
<p>The case began in 1988, when Eastern's three unions asked
the board to have Eastern and Continental declared one
carrier for labor purposes. It was the kickoff of a bruising
battle between Eastern and its unions.</p>
