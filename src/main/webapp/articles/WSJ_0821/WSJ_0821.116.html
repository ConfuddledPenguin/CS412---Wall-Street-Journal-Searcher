	<p class="article-leader">HOUSTON -- Baroid Corp., controlled by Dallas financier
Harold Simmons, said its board approved a previously
announced plan to separate its petroleum services businesses
and metals and mining businesses into two publicly traded
companies in a tax-free spinoff.
   Under the restructuring, the company said it will
distribute to current shareholders all shares of common stock
in its subsidiary, New Baroid Corp., which includes its
petroleum services businesses. Shareholders will receive one
share of New Baroid Corp. common for each share of the
company's common stock held on a record date to be
established. The company will then adopt a new name and New
Baroid Corp. will change its name to Baroid Corp., the
company said.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Baroid also said that after the restructuring its
operations will consist primarily of Titanium Metals Corp.,
its titanium metals business, and its bentonite mining
business.</p>
<p>Robert J. Leidich, Baroid's vice president and general
counsel, said the company is undertaking the spinoff to
"separate two distinct lines of businesses."</p>
<p>The company said the plan is subject to several
conditions, including New Baroid's ability to complete
negotiations with a group of commercial banks for a $200
million credit facility. New Baroid plans to distribute $100
million of the proceeds of the credit facility to the company
prior to the stock distribution and will use about $50
million of the remaining proceeds to repay debts.</p>
<p>The plan, which isn't subject to approval by shareholders,
is expected to be completed by early October, the company
said.</p>
<p>Baroid itself was created in 1988 when it was spun off
from NL Industries, also controlled by Mr. Simmons through
his Valhi Inc. holding company.</p>
<p>In New York Stock Exchange composite trading, Baroid
closed at $14.25, down 37.5 cents.</p>
