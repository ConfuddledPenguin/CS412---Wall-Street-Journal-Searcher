	<p class="article-leader">SAN FRANCISCO -- Investment professionals may be getting
jittery about the outlook for stocks, but some individual
investors remain resolute.
   Many of those who attended one of the country's largest
annual meetings of individual investors believe that the
market, after some turbulence, will be higher a year from
now.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"For more than 50 years, I have bought blue-chip stocks
that pay a 5% dividend, and I have done very well,"
80-year-old Thomas Cordory of San Francisco said. "I don't
intend to change my strategy now." His wife, Helen, also 80,
said, "I love IBM -- and I am holding on forever."</p>
<p>The Cordorys were among some 500 individual investors who
paid an average of about $2,500 (including travel, hotel and
registration fees) to attend a four-day conference here last
week, sponsored by Investors Seminars Inc.</p>
<p>The advice they got from financial newsletter writers,
money managers and stock analysts was often blunt. Craig
Corcoran, editor of Davis/Zweig Futures Hotline, an Orange
Park, Fla., newsletter, told them to "sell all stocks and
move into cash and Treasury bills."</p>
<p>Bert Dohmen, president of Wellington Financial Corp., a
Honolulu money-management firm, said to "sell all stocks and
move your money into foreign currencies." And Joe Granville,
editor of Granville Market Letter, Kansas City, Mo., said to
"sell stocks and buy gold."</p>
<p>But, despite the escalating confrontation in the Middle
East, rising oil prices and growing recession worries, a poll
taken on the final day of the conference found that more than
half of those attending remain confident. Like the Cordorys,
most of them are older than 50, manage their own money, and
have built up considerable portfolios of blue-chip stocks
that they aren't rushing to sell.</p>
<p>"There will be a short-term blood bath in the market,"
said a 72-year-old investor, who didn't want his name used.
The man, who identified himself as a retired banker, said he
plans to hold onto his blue-chip stocks -- and smaller
high-tech stocks, too. After a brief crunch, he predicted,
the market "will rebuild a base, consolidate in 1991 and
start up again."</p>
<p>Some individuals said they even plan to buy stocks --
contrary to the pros' advice. David Koontz, a Laguna Beach,
Calif., investor who is in his 50s, said he purchased several
growth stocks late last week at what he believes were bargain
prices. Among his picks: General Electric Co., Johnson &
Johnson and Home Depot Inc. These stocks, he said, were
"battered down way beyond reason."</p>
<p>The persistent optimism did nothing to cheer the more
gloomy professionals. "I think individuals don't understand
how bad things really are," Mr. Dohmen, the Honolulu money
manager, said. "When they do, the market will go down
further."</p>
<p>Mr. Granville, referring to the old saying that the show
"isn't over until the fat lady sings," quipped that counting
the actress and comedienne Roseanne Barr's rendition of the
Star Spangled Banner at a recent baseball game, "even that
has happened."</p>
<p>But a few bullish pros at the conference believe the
individual investors are correct. Norman Fosback of Fort
Lauderdale, Fla., editor and publisher of six investment
newsletters, said he believes the specialists are the victims
of a herd psychology. "The group that usually is wrong is the
experts," he said. "Find out if they are all recommending the
same thing, and then do the opposite." Mr. Fosback himself
sees a short-term correction in a long-term bull market.</p>
<p>Charles R. Schwab, chairman of Charles Schwab Corp., the
nation's largest discount brokerage firm, said he expects
individual investors to outpace the professionals "in this
market. The pros are getting too fancy." Though his firm
doesn't give advice, Mr. Schwab said he plans to buy some
beaten-down blue-chip stocks for his own account.</p>
<p>That should be just fine, in the opinion of people such as
Jerry Daley, a thirtysomething "value" investor from
Ridgewood, N.J. He said, "I don't plan to sell in a panic."
And Walter Krysher, 86, of Hudson, Pa., said he remains
optimistic about the economy. He expects the stock market to
continue its upward climb after "this blip."</p>
