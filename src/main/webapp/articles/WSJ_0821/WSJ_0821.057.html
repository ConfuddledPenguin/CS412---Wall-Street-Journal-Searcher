	<p class="article-leader">In your July 18 article "Rivalry Accelerates for Sports
Trucks, Dubbed Family Sedans of the '90s," you are right when
you say that several years ago Jeep Cherokee virtually owned
the market. I had a pickup for years but needed four doors
once I had kids. In late 1987 the only four doors were Jeep
and the Isuzu Trooper. I made a big mistake and bought the
Trooper. It has been a maintenance nightmare. I've spent
almost $3,000 on repairs and it has been in the shop more
than 65 days in the past two years (I once had to wait 12
days for a thermostat housing gasket).
   If Joe Isuzu is going after the upscale Range Rover
market, all I can say is Good Luck]</p>
