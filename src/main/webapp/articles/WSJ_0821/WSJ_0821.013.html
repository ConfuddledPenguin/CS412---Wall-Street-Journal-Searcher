	<p class="article-leader">PARIS -- As pressure fueled by the plight of hostages in
Iraq and Kuwait grew in Europe for a more determined stance
against Saddam Hussein, European Community members today are
expected to present a more unified military and political
front in the Persian Gulf.
   At a meeting of the Western European Union in Paris, nine
EC members are expected to signal their joint commitment to
enforcing United Nations sanctions against Iraq, create a
structure to coordinate their military effort in the Gulf,
and announce the sending of more naval vessels to the region.
However, the WEU, the only EC-linked organization that deals
with military matters, isn't expected to send ground troops
to Saudi Arabia to serve alongside U.S. soldiers.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>At a separate meeting of EC foreign ministers immediately
thereafter, the EC is to discuss ways to free Western
captives in Iraq and Kuwait. Iraq yesterday confirmed that an
unspecified number of foreigners have been moved to military
and industrial installations, apparently to serve as
deterrents against a military attack. European governments
with citizens in Iraq and Kuwait reacted with outrage at
Iraq's announcement that foreigners would be dispersed as a
shield against attack and not be allowed to leave until the
U.S. military withdraws from the region.</p>
<p>Most European governments are facing calls to take action
against the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait. Saddam Hussein's
hostage stance appears to have strengthened Europeans'
resolve.</p>
<p>Greece, Denmark and Turkey, which aren't WEU members, are
to participate in the meeting as observers. Turkey, which has
been instrumental in enforcing the U.N.-sponsored embargo of
Iraq, is being invited to the meeting as "a European country
that is directly involved" in the crisis, a French official
said.</p>
<p>The meetings come amid signs of a hardening of French
military policy in the Gulf. After having distanced itself
from the U.S. military action in Saudi Arabia in an attempt
to maintain its good relations with Arab states and the
Palestine Liberation Organization, the French were
embarrassed over the weekend by widespread publicity given to
33 French people who appear to have been moved from their
hotels in Kuwait and Baghdad. French newspapers yesterday
called on the government to stand up to the Iraqis rather
than pursue diplomatic efforts.</p>
<p>"Now," said former French foreign minister Jean
Francois-Poncet, "anything is permissible."</p>
<p>Though some countries, such as Belgium, would like to see
the WEU take command of European forces in the Gulf, this
isn't likely to happen immediately. The WEU doesn't have any
structures in place to exercise such a command. Other
countries, such as the Netherlands, want to use the WEU to
press for U.N. coordination of the multinational military
force assembling in the Gulf.</p>
<p>The WEU was widely seen as effective in organizing a
European force in the Gulf in 1987 and 1988, which helped
U.S. forces keep shipping lanes open during the Iran-Iraq
war. Belgium, the Netherlands, Britain and France already
have ships or material headed for the Gulf that will be part
of the WEU effort. Other countries that signaled they would
support the effort under the WEU umbrella include Italy and
Spain. West Germany will contribute to the effort by moving
ships into the Mediterranean, but the government decided
yesterday that it can't send ships into the Persian Gulf
without a change in its constitution, which forbids military
activities outside the North Atlantic Treaty Organization
area. The remaining WEU members, Portugal and Luxembourg, are
also expected to contribute.</p>
<p>Though several EC countries want to bring military and
foreign policy matters under the EC treaty itself, several
countries are opposed. Neutral Ireland doesn't want to be in
any military arrangements with Britain. And Britain is also
opposed. Nevertheless, many political experts expect the EC
countries to coordinate more political, foreign policy and
military matters after a treaty-changing conference on
political union later this year.</p>
<p>Military experts in Europe said the WEU response is
already the most extensive joint European military effort
ever and is likely to grow if the crisis isn't resolved.
While many Europeans have criticized Europe's seemingly slow
response, most experts see the effort as faster and more
coordinated than expected.</p>
<p>The EC governments are trying to make sure they also
coordinate their political response to the crisis. Most
European governments said they wouldn't close their embassies
in Kuwait by Friday as Iraq has demanded. "We will keep our
embassy open and our people in Kuwait as long as there are
French people in Kuwait to serve or to try to get out," said
a French official. Britain said it would keep its mission
open "as long as possible," and Italy said the Iraqis would
have to use force to shut down its embassy.</p>
<p>According to official sources, France has 281 nationals in
Iraq and 270 in Kuwait. The French Foreign Ministry said it
knows the whereabouts of all but the 33 who were rounded up.</p>
<p>Last weekend, 123 Britons were moved from hotels in Iraq
and Kuwait, prompting fears that they would be placed at
military installations to deter an attack. British Foreign
Secretary Douglas Hurd called the Iraqi move "illegal and
repulsive." Britain has about 4,000 citizens in Kuwait and an
additional 500 in Iraq.</p>
<p>Italy has 150 people in Iraq and 138 in Kuwait, while West
Germany has 590 in Iraq and 300 in Kuwait. The Netherlands
has 150 people in Iraq and 80 in Kuwait. Other European
countries have smaller totals.</p>
