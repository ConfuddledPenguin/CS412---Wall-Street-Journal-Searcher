	<p class="article-leader">Boston -- For more than 4,000 years, King Cheops's feet
were hidden beneath the Great Pyramid at Giza. For the past
77 years, they have languished in the temperature --
and-humidity-controlled storage rooms of the Museum of Fine
Arts here.
   Unearthed in 1913 by a museum expedition party, the
three-inch chunk of calcite is all that remains of one of
three known statues of the pharoah. Long-toed and elegantly
slender, the feet were considered too fragmentary to be
shown.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>But after years of obscurity, Cheops's feet have finally
stepped into the limelight, along with five Federal-style
chairs, a fake Fragonard and Emily Babcock Alward's
19-century court gown. They've all been put on show together
after years of being stuck away in the museum's storerooms.</p>
<p>At a time when some museums, such as New York's
Guggenheim, are selling off the lesser items in their
collections, the MFA has organized a tribute to them --
"Unlocking the Hidden Museum: Riches From the Storerooms." As
with many big museums, the bulk of the museum's more than a
million objects lie in storage. A no-frills affair down to
the museum packing crates that serve as mounts, this
eccentric and engaging show, up till Sept. 9, tries to
explain why.</p>
<p>The first room is, in effect, a concrete argument for
owning too much of a good thing, but against showing all of
it. To make this point, five near-identical English porcelain
goat-and-bee cream jugs are grouped in one vitrine, not far
from the five Federal-style chairs, four Kashmiri shawls and
70 stone "shawabtis", bearded pharaonic servitors from the
tomb of the Nubian pharoah, Taharqa. Eager to avoid chores in
the after-life, Taharqa was buried with more than 1,000 of
the statues. The museum got to take home half after
excavating his tomb in 1918, adding to a considerable
"shawabti" collection that eventually would total just under
10,000. Though of great interest to scholars, the entire
group has never been displayed. "It might sink the floor,"
one curator remarked.</p>
<p>In fact, the museum has so many artifacts from the Middle
Eastern digs it sponsored from 1905 to 1942, that less than
10% can be shown at one time. Many of the artifacts have
never been exhibited; more to the point, many still are
packed in their original shipping crates.</p>
<p>"You don't have to go to Egypt to excavate, you just have
to go into our basement," said Rita Freed, curator of
Egyptian and Ancient Near Eastern Art.</p>
<p>With such a wealth of objects, a big museum can afford to
be choosy about what it exhibits. So while John Singleton
Copley's portrait of Samuel Adams hangs in public view, his
merely adequate rendering of Robert Hooper Jr. is relegated
to a backroom. Both are on view here, among similar pairings
of the great and not-so-great.</p>
<p>And so are a few of the museum's mistakes. That Fragonard,
for example, which the museum bought in 1944 only to discover
that it was an 18th-century copy. Shown alongside the real
thing, Fragonard's "The Good Mother" -- borrowed for the show
-- the copy is now a denizen of the storeroom, along with the
fake Roman head and the Egyptian tomb sculpture that turned
out to be a modern forgery cobbled together from ancient
planks of wood.</p>
<p>The museum keeps its fakes on hand for research purposes,
but occasionally they spring a few surprises of their own.
Thanks to its glossy, unblemished surface, a red-lacquered
Greek vase given to the museum in 1941 was considered a
19th-century forgery. But when a conservator pulled the vase
from a storeroom shelf for this show, he noticed fine
crackles on the surface. X-ray studies revealed that the vase
had been put together from broken fragments and then
over-zealously painted and varnished. Although badly damaged,
it almost certainly dates from the late 5th century B.C. A
small area of the vase has been cleaned of its overpaint, all
of which will be removed after the show.</p>
<p>Other objects go in and out of storage for reasons that
have more to do with taste than authenticity. Back in 1890,
Henri Regnault's paintings were so admired that the citizens
of Boston took up a subscription to purchase his enormous
"Automedon With the Horses of Achilles." But by 1940, the
10-by-10-foot painting of the nearly nude hero with his
snorting chargers looked dated next to impressionist art.</p>
<p>M. Regnault's painting has drawn a lot of favorable
attention since emerging from its 20-year stint in the
storeroom, and may eventually return to the gallery. However,
other victims of changing taste, such as Ignacio Zuloaga y
Zabaleta's 1910 "My Uncle Daniel and His Family" -- which
depicts a group of mantilla -- clad, fan-flipping women posed
before a turbid landscape -- seem likely to remain in the
storeroom for a few more decades at least.</p>
<p>Perhaps the most engrossing section of this show is
devoted to the fragile, the fragmented and the damaged.
Shards of ancient pottery and scraps of thousand-year-old
fabric are important resources for scholars and historians,
but rarely are displayed.</p>
<p>Other things are kept out of view for their own good.
Edvard Munch's lithograph "The Scream" once was a vivid red.
Now, displayed under the linen flaps that protect it from
further degradation, it is a watery pink from too much
exposure to light and may never be exhibited again.</p>
<p>Many objects need elaborate and costly restoration before
they can be exhibited. Ironically, this show gave curators
the support to fix some of them up. A tattered 10th-century
Chinese wall screen has been carefully fitted with patches of
new silk, tinted to blend with the original surface. And
conservators spent two years cleaning and resetting more than
10,000 tiny ivory tiles in an 18th-century Indian bookcase.</p>
<p>Some artifacts wait a century or more for repairs.
Upstairs in an airy conservation studio, Pamela Hatchfield,
one of the show's four curators, is at work on a 3,000
year-old Egyptian coffin that hasn't been treated, much less
exhibited, since it came to the museum in 1872. The coffin
still would be in storage, water-splotched, splintered and
flaking gesso hieroglyphics, if it were not among the more
than 400 objects now being readied for 10-year loans to
museums in Dallas and San Antonio, Texas.</p>
<p>MFA curators are quick to point to such loans when asked
why storing art isn't the same thing as hoarding it. However,
in the final room of the exhibition that distinction becomes
blurred. Filled with works that MFA curators say are just too
big, too small or too strange to display, it contains
everything from cases of tiny carved netsuke and jewel-like
miniatures, to a Renaissance triptych. Dan Flavin's glaring
light sculpture, "Monument for V. Tatlin" -- isolated here
behind a partition -- isn't shown because its harsh beams
could damage paintings. More to the point, the museum doesn't
have enough 1960s' pop art for a separate gallery. And there
is no textile wing to display the long-trained,
gold-embroidered gown that Mrs. Alward wore to meet Queen
Victoria.</p>
<p>Eventually, curators say, they hope to have gallery space
for all these objects. But now that museum goers have seen
these treasures, they may not be content to see them return
to storeroom obscurity. Well-meaning curators may have opened
a richly furnished Pandora's box. Writing in the visitors'
comment book, Lisbeth Edgar of Manhattan had one question
that the exhibition failed to answer: "Why are you hogging so
much art?" she demanded.</p>
