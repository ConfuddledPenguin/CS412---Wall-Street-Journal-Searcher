	<p class="article-leader">PALO ALTO, Calif. -- Varian Associates Inc. said it signed
"a multimillion dollar" pact with the Soviet Union to supply
cancer radiotherapy systems to several treatment centers.
   The order includes a range of cancer therapy equipment,
including linear accelerators to deliver precise doses of
radiation, radiotherapy simulators, therapy planning
computers and radiotherapy management systems.</p>

at Moscow's All Union Oncology Center, the company said in a
news release. The other four cancer centers will receive
equipment next year, it said.</p>
