	<p class="article-leader">I am a fan of New Kids on the Block, and I think that your
July 23 page-one article about them was unfair. You did not
mention the older fans, like me and my girlfriends. I'm 13,
and I still have to have my mommy take me to a concert.
   Maybe you only have to be six or seven years old to know
this, but aren't articles supposed to be written unbiased? I
don't know about you, but I don't think calling their
bubblegum music (according to you) "horrid fluff" and saying,
"At least some older children reject the New Kids as kid's
stuff" sounds like it's written from a neutral point of view.</p>

<p>You stated that New Kids concerts "look more like day camp
than a rock concert." I am 15 years old and a big fan of the
New Kids. I am disturbed that New Kids fans are stereotyped
as little children that have to bring their parents to the
concerts. The New Kids are so down to earth, easy to relate
to and great performers that "kids" any age should be
represented as New Kids fans, including me.</p>

<p>As a mother of two pre-teen fans of the New Kids on the
Block, I have no sympathy for Mrs. Flores, who is unable to
afford a "decent dress" for herself after spending a small
fortune on New Kid paraphernalia for her daughter. Poor
little Ivory, hasn't she ever heard the word "no"?</p>

<p>I feel the article is totally discriminating against New
Kids on the Block. Though you did quote some music critics,
you only quoted the ones who feel negatively toward them.
Never did you mention that the New Kids were labeled the "Top
Pop Group of 1989" by Billboard or that their second album
went platinum seven times. Instead, you wrote that some feel
they are the "beltless slacks of the entertainment field" and
"a hormonal response rather than music per se."</p>
<p>Donnie, Danny, Jordan, Jon and Joe encourage kids to work
hard for what they believe in and always be themselves. They
attend "Say No to Drugs" benefits and give a portion of the
proceeds from their telephone hotline to the United Cerebral
Palsy Foundation. Never did you mention any of this.</p>

<p>You made it sound as if they didn't have any fans over the
age of 10, which just isn't true. I am 17 years old, and my
friends and I enjoy listening to them very much. We attended
their concert, on July 1, at the Alpine Valley Music Theatre,
and saw people of many ages.</p>
<p>I will agree with you that the majority of their fans are
pre-teens, which I think is good because they are influencing
these kids at a early age to stand up for themselves and say
"No" to drugs. Since drugs are reaching kids at a younger
age, this is a very important lesson to learn.</p>
