	<p class="article-leader">Over-the-counter stocks showed no strength, sliding lower
all day as their listed counterparts crept higher.
   Traders reported frustration with the OTC market's
weakness and their inability to explain its retrograde
motion.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The Nasdaq Composite Index closed with a 4.90, or 1.25%,
decline to 388.59. The New York Stock Exchange Composite
Index added 0.23, or 0.13%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average
climbed 11.64, or 0.44%.</p>
<p>"There's nothing nice to say about the OTC," says Steve
Bliss, head of OTC trading for Mabon Nugent & Co.</p>
<p>Unlisted shares opened with a brief surge only to retreat
for the rest of the day. It was the opposite story on the Big
Board where major averages opened lower, rallied and finished
higher on the day.</p>
<p>"The OTC just acted horrible right across the board," says
Robert Antolini, head of OTC trading at Donaldson Lufkin &
Jenrette Securities Corp.</p>
<p>Traders say buyers were scarce and selective. Volume fell
to 115.5 million shares from 146.9 million shares Friday.
Declining issues led advancers 1,231 to 693.</p>
<p>The OTC's unwillingness to follow the Big Board higher
mystified traders.</p>
<p>Mabon Nugent's Mr. Bliss suggests investors were reluctant
to place their money in the less liquid OTC market. He says
those willing to buy despite the Middle East uncertainty
probably felt safer in a more liquid market.</p>
<p>The day's most active issue was Intel, which lost 1 to 33
1/4 on 2.3 million shares.</p>
<p>Some of the OTC's biggest issues were battered in the
all-day slide. Microsoft fell 4 3/4 to 55 1/2. Sun
Microsystems dropped 1 1/4 to 26. Nike was 2 1/4 lower to 73
1/4. Reuters's American depositary receipts declined 2 5/8 to
46 3/4.</p>
<p>But some others managed to defy momentum and finish the
day higher. Apple Computer added 1/4 to 36 3/4. MCI
Communications rose 1/2 to 34 3/4.</p>
<p>Florida Employers Insurance shares were 4 3/8, or 58%
higher, to 11 7/8 after the company said it signed a letter
of intent to sell either its stock or its assets to American
Employers Group Inc. for about $16 a share.</p>
<p>Spiegel's Class A shares were down 4, or 16%, to 16. The
Dow Jones Professional Investor Report said Spiegel told
analysts last week that sales were slow and customers gave
its fall catalogue a cool reception. Spiegel Chief Financial
Officer Alton M. Withers projected third quarter earnings
would be flat at 21 cents a share.</p>
<p>Mack Trucks lost 1/4 to 6 1/2. The truck maker said late
Friday that a revised forecast for the year projects losses
of about $180 million compared to a loss of about $185
million for 1989. The company previously projected its 1990
loss at $130 million.</p>
<p>Millfeld Trading gained 7/8 to 13 1/2 after reported net
income for its second quarter doubled compared with the
period a year ago. The company also extended a warrant offer.</p>
<p>Radiation Systems also benefited from a positive earnings
report. Fourth quarter net income jumped to 39 cents a share
from 11 cents a year ago. Radiation Systems shares rose 3/8
to 10 3/8.</p>
