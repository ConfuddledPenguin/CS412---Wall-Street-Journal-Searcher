	<p class="article-leader">Thornton Wilder's "Our Town" is a delightful piece of
fiction . . . and so was your recent July 30 page-one article
about Peterborough, N.H.
   Your selection of sources resulted in a distinctly
one-sided portrayal of the town's relationship with Minebea
Co., owner of the New Hampshire Ball Bearing plant here.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The tone of the piece, in fact, reflected a preconceived
bias against small towns and their adjustments to changes in
management of local companies. Further, it was written in the
unfortunate tradition of Japan-bashing articles that have
become all too popular in recent years.</p>
<p>The article implied NHBB is strictly bottom-line-oriented,
having little interest in the community, but this is not
borne out by the facts. The company has been actively
involved in community and regional affairs for years.</p>
<p>Certainly there are adjustments to be made under the new
ownership, but change is inevitable with the passage of time
and evolving business conditions.</p>
<p>Let's keep Thornton Wilder's work as great entertainment
and let the Peterboroughs of the nation find their way of
dealing with new management in their vital industries.</p>

<p>Peterborough's business community is much more than just
Minebea's NH Ball Bearings subsidiary. There is certainly a
small-town flavor that natives and more recent arrivals
cherish. I've enjoyed this community since moving here in
1975 as founding editor and co-owner of my first major
magazine, BYTE. Numerous businesses large and small find this
kind of small town quite acceptable.</p>
<p>Our town's publishing industry alone employs hundreds of
people. Our economy is much more balanced than a single
manufacturing company recently acquired by new owners.
Peterborough, N.H., co-exists with and trades quite well with
a global world of commerce.</p>
