	<div class="article-body"><p>Before we can buy our dream house</p>
<p>We must sell the home we now own,</p>
<p>And the party who hopes to buy it</p>
<p>Is facing the same syndrome.</p>
<p>The person he wants to sell to</p>
<p>Must have a contingency deed</p>
<p>Based on whether he can get</p>
<p>The financing he will need.</p>
<p>So all concerned are on needles and pins</p>
<p>And our nerves are nearly wrecked</p>
<p>As we learn the hard way what is meant</p>
<p>By the "domino effect."</p>
<p>-- George O. Ludcke.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>Beginning to End</p>
<p>It starts with waiting</p>
<p>To be old enough</p>
<p>To cross the street alone;</p>
<p>To select what you choose</p>
<p>To wear --</p>
<p>To walk to school</p>
<p>On your own.</p>
<p>Then it happens --</p>
<p>You're an adult</p>
<p>Able to set pace</p>
<p>And tone --</p>
<p>Then the last thing</p>
<p>You want is to be</p>
<p>Left alone]</p>
<p>-- Beatrice Kess.</p>
