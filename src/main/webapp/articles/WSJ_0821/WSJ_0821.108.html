	<p class="article-leader">LOS ANGELES -- First Interstate Bancorp said it suspended
a dividend-reinvestment plan that had been a major element of
the struggling concern's efforts to rebuild its shattered
capital base.
   The move highlights the continuing woes of the nation's
eighth largest banking concern, despite recent rebounds from
disastrous results in the second half of 1989 that eroded
capital, hammered its stock price and made it vulnerable to a
takeover bid.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Under the plan, shareholders were allowed to use dividend
proceeds to buy First Interstate stock at a 2.5% discount
from market values. The plan had produced $260 million of
desperately needed capital since its initiation in February
1989.</p>
<p>First Interstate said it dropped the plan because of its
flagging stock price. Although it earned $222.3 million, or
$3.60 a share, for the six months ended June 30, First
Interstate's stock has slid to new lows, making the issuance
of discounted shares under the reinvestment plan too
dilutive.</p>
<p>"The purpose of the plan was to allow us to replenish our
capital base in a costeffective manner," said Edward M.
Carson, chairman and chief executive officer. "However, at
current stock price levels," it would not "serve the
interests of shareholders" to boost the number of shares
outstanding at cut-rate prices.</p>
<p>The news drove First Interstate's stock down even further.
In New York Stock Exchange trading, it closed at $28.875,
down 50 cents. That was believed to be a record low for the
stock, which traded as high as $70 a share in the fall of
1989. Analysts say the swooning stock reflects both general
weakness in bank stocks and lingering skepticism about First
Interstate's prospects.</p>
<p>The bank declined to comment on how the suspension of the
plan would affect its ongoing efforts to restore capital
devoured by surprise losses totaling $341.3 million in last
year's second half. A spokesman, noting that the bank has had
two profitable quarters in 1990, said the bank intends to
build capital through retained earnings. Meanwhile, the bank
is continuing restructuring efforts aimed at trimming its
cost structure, which remains one of banking's most bloated.</p>
<p>Still, the stock's continuing plunge raised anew questions
about how long First Interstate will be able to avoid
becoming a takeover target. The current stock price level is
far below First Interstate's book value of $37.81 a share,
and has even gone below the $33 a share at which it sold 8.6
million shares in a public offering in February. Several
competitors, including Wells Fargo & Co., Security Pacific
Corp. and BankAmerica Corp., are known to have studied
possible bids for First Interstate. As the stock price
slides, "the temptation for a bid rises," observed one
investment banker.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co. bought 45% of
the shares sold in the February offering and owns about 10%
of First Interstate. Although KKR has said it supports
management's efforts to turn the company around, some other
institutional holders questioned how long KKR would tolerate
the low stock price. At present levels, KKR has a paper loss
of about $13 million on its purchases in the February
offering.</p>
<p>"Losses have been known to make KKR's patience wear a
little thin," said one institutional holder.</p>
