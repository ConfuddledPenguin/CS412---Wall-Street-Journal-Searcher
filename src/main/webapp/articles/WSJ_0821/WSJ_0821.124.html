	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- Seven major toy distributors were sued by
the Justice Department and the Consumer Product Safety
Commission for selling imported toys the government
considered hazardous.
   The suits are the result of a yearlong investigation
conducted by the commission and the U.S. Customs Service that
found the companies sold imported toys that failed to meet
federal health and safety standards. The items included
rattles and other toys with small parts that could pose a
choking risk to small children, as well as toys coated with
lead-based paint.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Although most of the product labels recommended the toys
for children over three years of age, commission officials
said the design of the toys proved they were actually
intended for younger children. The commission said there were
no known injuries or deaths resulting from the toys, which
were imported mostly from Taiwan.</p>
<p>The chief executives of the companies also were named in
the suits.</p>
<p>The suits seek injunctions against the companies to stop
the sale of the items. A commission spokesman said the action
also is designed to encourage U.S. companies to require the
same quality-control standards of foreign products as they do
of U.S.-produced goods.</p>
<p>The companies named in the suits are Toys "R" Us, Paramus,
N.J.; Child World Inc., Avon, Mass.; Lionel Leisure Inc.,
Philadelphia; Value Merchants Inc., Milwaukee; Illco Toy Co.
U.S.A., New York; Beachcombers International Inc., Fort
Myers, Fla.; Division Sales Inc. and an affiliated
partnership, Justen Products, both of Itasca, Ill.</p>
<p>Michael Goldstein, vice chairman of Toys "R" Us, said the
suit "is without merit. Our safety record is excellent."</p>
<p>Mr. Goldstein said he did not know which specific toys
were mentioned in the suit and he declined to speculate as to
why the suit was being brought at this time. He called the
suit a "waste of taxpayers' money," but added that he was
confident the company would prevail.</p>
<p>The other companies couldn't immediately be reached for
comment.</p>
<p>Over the past year, several companies have agreed to
voluntarily recall certain products.</p>
