	<div class="article-body"><p>American Housing Trust VII -- $293 million of
mortgage-backed certificates, to be issued by the Department
of Veterans Affairs via First Boston Corp. and backed by
vendee loans. The deal, called a proportional coupon
allocation structure, is designed with two separate security
structures -- one single-class and one with multiple classes
-- with a range of average maturities. As investor demand
increases or decreases during the marketing period for the
single-class certificates, the proportion of par amount in
each of the two structures will be adjusted up or down
acccordingly. Details of the planned offering weren't
immediately available. This is the seventh in a series of
securitized offerings by the Veterans Affairs Department
since 1988. Vendee loans are loans issued to finance the sale
of VA-owned properties acquired as a result of VA loan
defaults. The VA originates approximately $50 million to $70
million of such loans each month.</p>
