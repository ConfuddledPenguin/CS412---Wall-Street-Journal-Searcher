	<p class="article-leader">OMI Corp., an international bulk shipping company, said it
is considering whether to issue publicly traded securities
for its international joint venture activities.
   The company said a decision will not be reached before the
end of the year, because of the complexity of such a
transaction. Company officials couldn't be reached to
elaborate.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Analysts think New York-based OMI considers its stock
undervalued and hopes to get a greater value for its foreign
operations. "There are times when the parts are worth more
than the whole but it is not recognized by investors," says
Luella White-Price of Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette
Securities.</p>
<p>In 1989, OMI had revenue of $32.9 million from foreign
operations compared with $160 million for its domestic
activities. However, foreign operating profit was $21.3
million compared with $13.7 million for domestic shipping
operations. OMI's net income nearly doubled to $27.5 million,
or $1.01 a share, from $14.1 million, or 45 cents a share.
The year-earlier per-share figure included a 25-cent
reduction because of an accounting change on dry-dock
expenses.</p>
<p>OMI maintains approximately a 50% interest in a number of
operations, including Rubicon Tankers Ltd. and Mosaic
Alliance Corp.</p>
<p>OMI shares closed yesterday at $7, down 75 cents, in
American Stock Exchange composite trading.</p>
