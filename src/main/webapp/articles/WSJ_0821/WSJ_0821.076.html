	<p class="article-leader">OPEC may be in its worst crisis yet, but it has support in
Russia.
   The Soviet Union's largest republic would like to join the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, Russia's
foreign economics minister told a news conference in Moscow.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"We are prepared to enter as one of the members of OPEC,
now perhaps as an observer but in the future, if we are
accepted, to enter fully," said the minister, Viktor
Yaroshenko.</p>
<p>The Soviet Union is the world's largest oil producer,
although output has been declining and is now down to under
12 million barrels a day, most of which is used domestically.
Russia accounts for the bulk of the country's oil production.
It is, in effect, the Texas of the Soviet Union in size and
oil output.</p>
<p>According to Mr. Yaroshenko, the republic considers itself
free to join OPEC because of its assertion of independence of
central Soviet control. Its parliament has decided that it,
and not Soviet authorities, control resources on Russia's
territory.</p>
<p>The Soviet Union itself has long been interested in OPEC.
It has sent observers to OPEC meetings and has attempted to
cooperate with other oil exporters, both in and out of OPEC,
when production restraints were necessary in the past to prop
up prices.</p>
