	<p class="article-leader">LONDON -- Lloyd's of London Underwriters Association
reduced the recommended marine hull insurance rates for the
Persian Gulf.
   A spokesman for the insurance firm said it cut recommended
rates because there hadn't yet been any serious incidents in
the Gulf. "But I'm sure if there are" any incidents in the
region, the rates will increase again, he added.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The rate for "hull and machinery" insurance for vessels
making calls at ports on the Persian Gulf coast of Saudi
Arabia, excluding the neutral zone between Kuwait and Saudi
Arabia, are now quoted at 0.75% of the insured value for
every seven days' cover, Lloyd's said. That rate is a
reduction from the previous level of 1%.</p>
<p>Similarly, a 0.75% rate now applies to vessels making
calls to Iranian ports in the northern Persian Gulf, reduced
from 1% previously.</p>
<p>Rates for ports on the coast of Iraq, Kuwait and the
neutral zone are still "held covered," which means they must
be negotiated on a voyage-by-voyage basis.</p>
<p>Rates for vessels calling at other Persian Gulf ports and
at Saudi Arabian Red Sea coast ports are 0.20% of the insured
value, compared with the previous rate of 0.25%.</p>
<p>The cost of insurance to the Gulf of Aqaba is unchanged at
0.25% of the insured value. All rates quoted are for seven
days' cover, Lloyd's said.</p>
