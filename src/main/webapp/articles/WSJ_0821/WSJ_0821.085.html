	<div class="article-body"><p>Americans may fret about Japanese making inroads into the
U.S. economy, but more and more U.S. entrepreneurs are
sighing with relief when they arrive.</p>
<p>When Computed Anatomy Inc. desperately needed cash last
year, American investors proved useless. A small Japanese
corporation saved the day.</p>
<p>The New York medical-equipment maker spent years seeking
funds from U.S. venture capitalists and "wasted tens of
thousands of dollars" to prepare presentations and reply to
questions, says Jeffrey Stewart, president.</p>
<p>After the company received an "absurdly low" investment
offer from a U.S. venture capitalist, it turned to Toyo
Medical Co., Nagoya, a distributor of Computed Anatomy's
products in Asia, Mr. Stewart says. Toyo provided the funds
that Computed needed immediately to pay off its creditors --
and kicked in nearly $2 million in fresh capital.</p>
<p>"Without the capital, we'd have had to shut down," Mr.
Stewart adds.</p>
<p>Mr. Stewart has plenty of company. While the Japanese once
focused mainly on big American corporations, now one small
U.S. company after another finds that investors, major
suppliers -- and even owners -- come from Tokyo instead of
Toledo.</p>
<p>Sometimes the relationships lead to fights, charges of
stolen technology and even total disruption of business. But
often, companies say Japanese investors are marching in where
American venture capitalists increasingly fear to tread. And
the Japanese frequently prove to be exceptionally helpful
investors, the Americans say.</p>
<p>Publicly reported Japanese minority investments in U.S.
industrial companies with annual sales of under $100 million
soared to $320 million last year, up 82% from $176 million in
1988, says Venture Economics Inc., a Needham, Mass., research
and consulting firm.</p>
<p>The Japanese "are filling a void left by U.S. venture
capital," says investment banker Sumiko Ito, head of the
Pacific Rim group at Alex. Brown & Sons Inc., Baltimore. From
1987 to 1989, venture-capital investments in smaller American
companies fell 17%, while the number of concerns getting
investments shrank 22%, Venture Economics says.</p>
<p>Ms. Ito adds that not only are Japanese corporations
providing early-stage investments but also late-stage
financing, capital traditionally provided by big U.S.
corporations and insurers.</p>
<p>In the early days of venture capital, small niche
companies such as Computed Anatomy would have been obvious
investments. The company, founded in 1981 by three
ophthalmologists at New York Eye and Ear Infirmary, makes
machines that map the eye and was the only one of its kind.
It projected annual sales of $50 million within five years of
introducing the first product.</p>
<p>But after financing the company through friends and
"angels," and developing the diagnostic machine, Computed
Anatomy's founders couldn't find money to fund the company's
growth and expansion. The company says it talked to nearly 50
venture-capital firms; almost all the discussions proved
abortive. One of New York's largest venture concerns talked
to Computed Anatomy for eight months before it decided that
the investment involved was too small. Another venture
concern, Euclid Partners Corp., New York, made an offer -- of
almost a third less than what the firm wanted. Finally,
Computed Anatomy signed the deal with Toyo.</p>
<p>Indeed, Japanese often enter the scene only after U.S.
investors turn down the deal or offer too low a price.</p>
<p>LTX Corp., a Westwood, Mass., maker of semiconductor test
equipment, raised $24 million in Japan only after it failed
to find investors here. "We'd have been hardpressed to raise
money at the price we did here in the U.S.," says John
Arcari, chief financial officer at LTX.</p>
<p>After LTX's stock dropped to around $2 a share and the
value of the company stood at less than $50 million, LTX sold
a 15% stake to Sumitomo Metal Industries Ltd., Tokyo, for $12
million -- almost twice the market value at the time.
Sumitomo also paid a further $12 million for a 49.5% stake in
LTX's Japanese operations. The entire LTX investment gives
Sumitomo a stake in a key semiconductor business.</p>
<p>"The Japanese clearly are looking for new products and
technologies here," says Masazumi Ishii, a former McKinsey &
Co. consultant, who now heads Azca Inc., a Redwood City,
Calif., consulting firm.</p>
<p>"Japanese corporations are better organized to invest in
small companies than their U.S. and European counterparts,"
says venture capitalist Arthur Spinner of Hambro
International Venture Funds, New York. The Japanese
commitment to an investment usually comes from the top, he
notes. In U.S. and European corporations, investments in
small companies often are handled by a unit or division that
itself is straining to be noticed by the larger corporate
entity.</p>
<p>Also, "it's easier to work with one Japanese corporate
investor" than a slew of U.S. venture capitalists, especially
when large amounts of capital are involved, says Mr. Spinner.
There's more risk in managing a syndicate of U.S. venture
capitalists with conflicting goals, than in a single Japanese
corporation that knows what it wants and is willing to stick
in there, he adds.</p>
<p>The Japanese also have shown a willingness to keep their
hands off their investments. "They're giving us a lot of
latitude in the day-to-day running of our business and
developing our own business strategy," says Mr. Stewart of
Computed Anatomy. "A (U.S.) venture capitalist not only would
have wanted a bigger portion of our business, he would have
been here every day telling us how to run it."</p>
<p>To some, this explains why the Japanese are welcomed by
U.S. entrepreneurs and are often happy to outbid American
investors.</p>
<p>But for some U.S. companies, the Japanese thirst for
technology has led to miserable fights. Last month, the
founders of Stardent Computer Inc., a Silicon Valley
supercomputer company, sued Japan's Kubota Ltd., contending
that the Japanese manufacturing giant conspired to co-opt the
U.S. company's technology by using its investment in the
concern as leverage.</p>
<p>Kubota characterizes the allegations as "bold-faced lies"
and claims entrepreneurs brought the charges only after their
private demand for a $7 million payment was refused.</p>
<p>Most U.S. companies are making deals "for specific
applications and specific geographical territories" and
aren't giving away technology lock, stock and barrel, says
Paul Ferrari, editor of Corporate Venturing News, a Needham,
Mass., newsletter. Others add that young U.S. concerns are
getting the benefit of the know-how and marketing of large
Japanese corporations.</p>
<p>Japan's Mitsui & Co., for example, now is helping Digital
Radio Laboratories Inc., Carson, Calif., to make and
distribute hardware for its cable-based digital audio
service. For Digital, financing this aspect of the business
would cost more than $5 million, says venture capitalist
Robert Fleming, a Digital director.</p>
<p>Digital had received over $7 million in financing from
U.S. investors to launch its service, which will allow
cable-TV system operators to provide digital audio sound to
their subscribers. But to make the hardware, Digital needed
more money. "It was too much money, too early, for venture
capitalists to finance and expect a decent return," says Mr.
Fleming.</p>
<p>Similarly, Adaptive Solutions Inc., Beaverton, Ore., had
received about $1 million in seed financing from U.S. venture
capitalists. Then, it turned to Sharp Corp. and Mitsubishi
Electric Corp. to test and develop new uses for its neural
network computers, machines that mimic certain brain
functions.</p>
<p>The Japanese "are being very deliberate about what they
are doing. By putting in small sums of money they are
controlling their risk," says Yutaka Fujiwara of MASI Ltd., a
Chicago investment banker. "As long as the financing gap
exists here and small U.S. companies meet strategic needs,
the investments will continue to increase."</p>
