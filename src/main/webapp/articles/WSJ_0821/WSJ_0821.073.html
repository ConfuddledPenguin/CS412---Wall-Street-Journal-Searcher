	<p class="article-leader">The housing slump presents relocation managers with a new
challenge: how to unload scores of Victorians, colonials and
Tudors.
   Depressed real-estate prices have saddled corporations
with a hefty backlog of homes purchased because transferred
employees can't find their own buyers. As a result,
relocation costs are spiraling and some companies are
rethinking transfer policies.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Atlantic Richfield Co., Los Angeles, has an inventory of
once-coveted California houses. "People used to stand in line
to bid on them," says Catherine Morris, a senior analyst of
compensation and policy at Arco. Now, she says, it takes two
to three months to sell a house after Arco buys it -- and
that's usually after the employee has tried for months to
find a buyer. When the house finally does sell, Arco
typically takes an 8% loss.</p>
<p>Companies usually offer to buy homes if transferred
employees can't find buyers on their own. But in today's
slow-moving real estate market, for-sale signs are out for
much longer and companies are burdened with steep carrying
costs.</p>
<p>Westinghouse Electric Corp., Pittsburgh, says selling a
house takes an average of 180 days, up from 150 days last
year. "The biggest piece of our costs is that carrying time,"
says Regina Belli, manager of relocation services. "And the
longer it sits on the market, the more likely it is to have a
stigma attached. People think there must be something wrong
with this house."</p>
<p>Housing prices in once-hot markets such as New England and
Southern California have dropped substantially in recent
months. Houses in Manchester, N.H., and Boston are selling
for 6% below last year's prices, according to Runzheimer
International, a consulting firm.</p>
<p>"Now I'm satisfied if we sell an East Coast house within a
year," says Lynn Pellicciarini, an assistant vice president
in charge of relocation at BankAmerica Corp. in San
Francisco. Prices in other markets, such as Arizona and
Colorado, are also expected to fall as the government
auctions real estate from failed thrifts.</p>
<p>Companies trying to unload houses in this market often
take a double hit. When buying a house from a transferred
employee, they generally cover the difference, if any,
between what the employee originally paid and the current
appraisal; then, to land a buyer, companies are forced to
sell at a discount.</p>
<p>The Employee Relocation Council, a Washington, D.C., trade
group, estimates that about half of its 1,000 corporate
members this year will be forced to use a loss-on-sale
provision for moves, up from just 13% three years ago.</p>
<p>Westinghouse pays up to $5,000 to help defray an
employee's loss on a house sale. Ms. Belli estimates the
company is using the loss program 5% more often than last
year.</p>
<p>In the past, Mitre Corp., a Bedford, Mass., systems
engineering consulting firm with 6,000 employees, rarely had
to buy houses in a move because "employees could always get a
better offer" on their own, says Steve Nurney, relocation
administrator. "Now they're better off taking ours."</p>
<p>The company is using the loss-on-sale provision twice as
often as last year, he says, adding that the weakest markets
are Boston, Houston and Colorado Springs, Colo. Sometimes the
loss provision is merely a few thousand dollars, "but it can
easily be half of the total cost of a move," Mr. Nurney says.
Ms. Pellicciarini of BankAmerica adds: "I've seen them in
excess of $30,000" on East Coast or Arizona homes that were
purchased in the past three years and resold this year.</p>
<p>The result: Relocation costs have risen sharply.
Runzheimer estimates that the average cost to relocate an
employee who owns a home was $40,939 at the end of 1989, up
from $36,891 in 1988. Though a 1990 estimate isn't available,
companies say their costs have jumped. For instance,
Westinghouse says its average has increased to $55,000 per
employee from $50,000 last year.</p>
<p>Costs are also rising because more transferred employees
demand temporary lodging for their families in between
houses. In some cases, BankAmerica now expects to pay 90
days' lodging instead of one month. In the San Francisco
area, where an apartment may rent for $2,000 a month, that
increased stay is quite costly, Ms. Pellicciarini says.</p>
<p>Rising costs are prompting companies to rethink whom they
move and what they are willing to pay. "It's receiving a lot
of concern from top management," says Mitre's Mr. Nurney.
"For the first time, real estate has become a consideration
in selecting a candidate to fill a job." In two recent cases,
Mitre management decided not to move employees because it was
"too big of a loss to swallow," he says.</p>
<p>Other companies say they're reining in some relocation
spending, agreeing to cover only actual losses on a house,
not other investment property, such as vacant land around a
house. "When times are good, the issue doesn't come up," says
Gini Santos, world-wide policy development manager for
Hewlett-Packard Co., Palo Alto, Calif. But now, she adds,
Hewlett-Packard won't reimburse employees for losses on land.</p>
<p>Some companies say they are getting complaints from
employees who feel pinched by the efforts to rein in costs.
Kevin Reid, a Digital Equipment Corp. relocation manager,
says the company has received "a fair number" of complaints
from employees about its purchase offers. "When the market is
like this, people are going to lose money," he says. "It's
not a happy time when you find out something you bought two
or three years ago is now worth $20,000, $30,000 or $40,000
less." But he says the company's offers are in line with
selling prices these days. Mr. Reid adds that Digital is
holding about 30% more houses than last year and takes an
average loss of 8% on each house it sells.</p>
<p>Other employees at the computer giant have chosen to stay
put in jobs rather than seek a transfer that would force them
to put their homes up for sale, Mr. Reid says. That stay-put
attitude is cropping up at some other companies, too. The
housing slump "is making it extremely difficult to get people
to transfer from one market to another," says Harvey J.
Auger, president of PHH Homequity, a Wilton, Conn.,
relocation firm.</p>
<p>To move houses faster, more companies are striking special
deals. Some employees are offered payments equal to 1% to 2%
of their house's value if they sell it themselves.</p>
<p>Westinghouse figures it costs at least $10,000 less if
employees sell their own homes, so they offer more pre-sale
marketing tips to workers, Ms. Belli says. If the company
does buy the house, it offers higher broker commissions and
incentives to get the house shown more frequently.</p>
<p>Du Pont Co., Wilmington, Del., helps arrange mortgages for
buyers in areas such as Hobbs, N.M., where its Conoco
subsidiary recently closed a facility and pulled out 40
workers. "We want to help cushion the blow to a community's
real-estate market," says Steve Rogers, a relocation
supervisor at Du Pont.</p>
<p>Fleet/Norstar Financial Group, Providence, R.I., recently
began a mortgage "buy-down" program that offers buyers a 3%
break on the mortgage during the first year, 2% in the second
year and 1% in the third. "It can be significant savings for
a buyer," says David Farley, corporate employment director.</p>
<p>More importantly for the company, it helps move houses.
"If you're looking at two comparable houses," he says,
"you'll lean more toward our house."</p>
