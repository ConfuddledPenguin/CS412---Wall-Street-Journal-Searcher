	<p class="article-leader">LOS ANGELES -- Atlantic Richfield Co. said it will
maintain its freeze on gasoline prices, but it is raising the
price of diesel and jet fuel.
   The decision to continue Arco's gasoline price freeze,
begun 13 days ago in the wake of President Bush's request
that oil companies act responsibly in pricing, is being
reviewed on a day-to-day basis, said George H. Babikian,
president of Arco Products Co., the company's marketing and
refining division.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>A spokesman for Arco said the price of diesel fuel will
climb, on average, to 76 cents a gallon from 70 cents. Jet
fuel will increase to about 75 cents or 80 cents a gallon
from 70 cents, depending on specific contract arrangements
with customers.</p>
<p>"Arco is doing all it can to hold the line, but we cannot
continue the freeze on diesel and jet fuel prices in the face
of sharp differences in marketplace prices between Arco and
its competitors," Mr. Babikian said in a statement. "In
addition, we have been forced to augment our jet fuel
supplies by buying on the spot market at high prices."</p>
<p>Meanwhile, at an average of about $1.16 a gallon in Los
Angeles, Arco's regular unleaded gasoline is priced between
five and 13 cents below the competition, the spokesman said.
Accordingly, more than 100 Arco stations a day are running
out of regular unleaded gasoline at some of their pumps.</p>
<p>Arco said it will continue "to encourage its dealers to
show restraint in setting prices." The company added that it
also is urging motorists to reduce gasoline consumption
during "the current emergency."</p>
