	<p class="article-leader">ABOARD THE USS TICONDEROGA -- Tracing Iraqi cargo in the
middle of the Red Sea has so far been more exasperating than
hazardous for the nearly 400 sailors aboard this
guided-missile cruiser.
   Sometimes the biggest problem is finding the right radio
frequency to reach vessels in the busy shipping lanes. When
contact is made, some captains change course to steer away
from the warship but don't indicate their destination.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>At other times, Capt. Morris Foote has to worry about
small coastal freighters that he says stay in Egypt's
territorial waters and may try to work their way into the
Jordanian port of Aqaba, a potentially large hole in the
international interdiction net against Iraq. U.S. ships
closer to Aqaba and other ports have the final responsibility
of determining whether Iraqi cargo is involved, and the U.S.
would intercept ships only in international waters.</p>
<p>But as tensions heat up in the Middle East, Capt. Foote
and his crew know they will find it even more difficult to
control shipments to Iraq and protect the U.S. fleet in the
Red Sea. "There have been a few cases where we hailed a ship
and got no response," Lt. Cmdr. Steve Miller, the
Ticonderoga's executive officer, said a few days ago. "But
you don't know if it's a {radio} frequency problem or
something much more serious."</p>
<p>The volatility became clear over the weekend, when
American warships fired warning shots at two Iraqi vessels
believed to be carrying outbound cargoes of oil.</p>
<p>"When we start getting into the business of firing warning
shots, you're never sure of the reaction," Capt. Foote told
reporters.</p>
<p>In many ways, life aboard "The Tico" -- as the crew
affectionately calls this 10,000-ton cruiser -- reveals the
risks and difficulties of the Navy's massive show of force.
The Ticonderoga's sophisticated radars, which can
simultaneously track large numbers of ships and planes for
more than 250 miles, also serve as the primary air-defense
warning for the carrier USS Dwight D. Eisenhower and its
support ships.</p>
<p>"I'm ready at a moment's notice to fire a warning shot if
I have to," Capt. Foote told reporters who visited his ship
last weekend. If a hostile plane heads directly for the
Ticonderoga, he said, "I could have guns shooting in 10
seconds . . . and have missiles shooting in less than that."</p>
<p>"The crew understand this is serious business, and they
know the president isn't joking," Capt. Foote said. "They all
have cars. They have motorcycles. I don't think any of them
fail to see the importance of fuel."</p>
<p>All crew members have been issued gas masks and protective
clothing in the event chemical weapons are used by the
Iraqis.</p>
<p>Inside the hushed, air-conditioned core of the ship --
called the combat information center -- the pale green light
from computer consoles and a giant, computer-generated map of
the region reflects off Capt. Foote's face. He presses a
button, and the image pans out to show the precise speed and
location of distant ships that won't reach the carrier task
force for days. Little half-moons identify the position of 50
or so planes that the ship's computers monitor every hour.</p>
<p>In the blinding sunlight on deck, a few nervous sailors
with flak jackets, M-14 rifles slung over their shoulders and
.45-caliber pistols on their hips stand ready to make good on
the U.S. blockade. "We just call ourselves the
visit-and-search party," said the 27-year-old lieutenant in
charge. (Defense Department rules allow identifying only
senior officers.)</p>
<p>If a ship is suspected of carrying Iraqi goods, these
sailors would take a small boat to board it and inspect the
cargo. "Every ship in the fleet has been asked to put
together such teams," said the native of Owings Mills, Md.
Ship captains are required to consult closely with senior
officers before taking such hostile action.</p>
<p>Most of all, Capt. Foote worries about the long-term
impact on his crew's nerves. "It's very hard to be on
five-minute alert for six months," he said.</p>
