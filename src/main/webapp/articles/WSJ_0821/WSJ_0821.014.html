	<p class="article-leader">SECOND NATIONAL FEDERAL SAVINGS BANK, Salisbury, Md., said
it cut its quarterly 50% in a move to conserve capital and
increase its general loan-loss reserves. The company will be
reducing its payout to 4.5 cents a share from nine cents,
beginning with its next dividend payment, due to be
considered at its Sept. 21 board meeting. Henry A. Berliner,
president and chief executive officer, said the company's
nonperforming commercial real estate loans doubled in the
second quarter, to $55 million from around $27 million.</p>
