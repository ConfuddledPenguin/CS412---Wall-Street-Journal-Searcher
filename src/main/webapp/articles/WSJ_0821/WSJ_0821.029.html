	<p class="article-leader">CLEVELAND -- LDI Corp., which leases and sells
data-processing, telecommunications and other high-technology
equipment, said it expects net income for its second quarter
ended July 31 to be in line with analysts' expectations of 38
cents a share, up from 35 cents a year earlier.
   The company also said it expects to post a fiscal
second-quarter revenue increase from the year-earlier $87.2
million. LDI cited diversification measures and a
conservative financial strategy.</p>
