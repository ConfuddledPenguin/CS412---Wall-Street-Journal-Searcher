	<p class="article-leader">A drug that could revolutionize the organ transplant field
continues to show high success rates in new studies.
   The drug, known as FK506, often reverses advanced
rejection, lowers the occurence of infection, virtually
eliminates hypertension and reduces the instance of kidney
failure more effectively than traditional immunosuppressive
therapies, like cyclosporine, researchers said.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The drug is metabolized from a soil fungus found in Japan.
It could expand both the availability and success of
complicated organ transplants. Rejection has been the major
obstacle in the approximately 30,000 organ transplants
performed worldwide each year. Many patients require repeat
operations because of the rejection problem.</p>
<p>The successful experiments are good news to the drug's
manufacturer, Japan's Fujisawa Pharmaceutical Co., which
discovered the drug in 1984.</p>
<p>Results of several studies conducted between February 1989
and June 1990 were disclosed at the International Congress of
the Transplantation Society in San Francisco. The research on
FK506 was headed by Dr. Thomas E. Starzl, director of the
University of Pittsburgh Transplantation Program.</p>
<p>With FK506, researchers hope that patients "won't require
a second or third transplant," said Dr. Andreas Tzakis, a
transplant surgeon at the University of Pittsburgh Medical
Center. "With the scarcity of organs for children, this drug
may result in organs available for a large number of
children."</p>
<p>Dr. Tzakis, who studied 42 children who had undergone
liver, heart, kidney and other transplants, found that high
doses of steroids required with cyclosporine were unnecessary
with FK506, eliminating problems of stunted growth and facial
puffiness. In addition, he found that organs failing on
cyclosporine could be salvaged by giving the patient FK506.</p>
<p>In a study on adult patients who received heart
transplants, researchers reported that 26 out of 30 patients
who used the drug are experiencing excellent cardiac
function, with few instances of rejection or infection.</p>
<p>In that study, researchers said they were also surprised
by the decrease in deaths due to atherosclerosis, a hardening
of the arteries accompanied by small fatty deposits on artery
walls. Researchers believe that FK506 curbs the incidence of
hypertension and prevents a condition called hyperlipidemia,
a buildup of excessive fat in the blood.</p>
<p>A common complication for all organ transplants treated
with cyclosporine is hypertension, which is virtually
eliminated with FK506.</p>
<p>In another study on 125 liver transplant patients,
researchers said that fewer than 40% of the patients
experienced rejection, compared with a 70% rejection rate for
patients treated with cyclosporine and other traditional
therapies.</p>
<p>Dr. Mario Alessiani, a fellow at the University of
Pittsburgh, said infection remains a major obstacle. "As it
stands, patients are still experiencing the same types of
infections common in cyclosporine patients, but some
(infections) appear less frequently and tend to be less
severe."</p>
<p>The drug, which is still in its experimental phase, hasn't
been approved yet by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration,
and its long-term effects are still unknown. Clinical trials
began at University of Pittsburgh in 1989, and surgeons have
given the drug to about 800 patients, who have received
transplanted livers, hearts, kidneys, pancreatic islet cells,
lungs and various combinations of these organs.</p>
