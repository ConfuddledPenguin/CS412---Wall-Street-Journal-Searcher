	<p class="article-leader">A Chair Too Timeless
   For Business to Buy?</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>THE CHAIR is strong, graceful and prize winning.
Homeowners snap it up. Why don't businesspeople?</p>
<p>Joey Mancini and Gaby Dorell of Brooklyn, N.Y., designed
their Karina side chair for Sawaya & Moroni, a furniture
maker in Milan. The chair is made entirely of beechwood,
including plywood seat and back support. The back is made
with a new steam-pressure process that allows the plywood to
be tightly curved around the rear leg. The chair also comes
with a leather back and seat.</p>
<p>The Karina looks delicate, but it survived rocking back
and forth under a 400-pound load. The Israel Museum in
Jerusalem has just added the chair to its collection, and ID,
International Design magazine has given it a "best" in its
1990 design review.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, sales are mixed. Pia DeLeon, a salesperson
at DIVA, a Los Angeles importer, says the Karina has been
"very successful" with homeowners, but much less so with
hotels, restaurants and offices. Carole Tresselt, a principal
at Frederic Williams, a New York wholesaler, says U.S.
companies would "rather go with an $80 chair" than one that,
like the Karina, costs $650.</p>
<p>Ivan Luini of New York, who represents the Italian
manufacturer, says the Karina's sales reflect a fundamental
difference between Europe and America. European companies are
willing to spend more on chairs because they "expect to keep
them for a long time," says Mr. Luini. U.S. companies are
loath to spend a lot, he says, because they are "always
remodeling."</p>
<p>Trying to Strike Balance</p>
<p>On Use of Hardwoods</p>
<p>BOWING TO concern about rain forests, furniture makers
have cut back on their use of tropical hardwoods. But some
environmentalists aren't satisfied.</p>
<p>Herman Miller says it's phasing out the use of tropical
woods in its "standard" products, if the wood can't be
obtained from "sustained-yield" sources. Its Eames lounge
chair, for example, will be offered only in alternative
veneers once the company exhausts its supply of South
American rosewood. But Herman Miller will continue using
traditional hardwoods for custom furniture, where requested.</p>
<p>Steelcase says it has discontinued mahogany on many of its
better-selling lines. The company will still use mahogany on
its "high-end, low-volume" furniture, where the wood is
"essential to the nature of the design," but only if it has
been harvested under "strict controls."</p>
<p>Rainforest Action Network, San Francisco, writes other
furniture companies urging them to follow Herman Miller's
"responsible lead." But Earth Access isn't appeased. Cymie
Payne, director of the Cambridge, Mass., group, says the wood
industry and environmentalists are talking different
languages.</p>
<p>When timber companies refer to "sustainable" forest
practices, Ms. Payne says, they mean being able to cut the
same number of trees year after year. For Earth Access, she
says, sustainable means making sure that the number of plant
and animal species stays the same.</p>
<p>Window Shopping Grows</p>
<p>More Mechanical</p>
<p>DISPLAY mannequins are becoming more abstract, mirroring
modern times.</p>
<p>Boston's Origo Corp., a startup, offers a flexible
mannequin with 10 interchangeable heads and optional
illuminated crowns. Designer Farsad Labbauf says realistic
human forms "no longer convey the message of how abstract
human life has become in the last decade -- everything is
dealt with as a button."</p>
<p>Established manufacturers warn about going too far. "The
retail industry is pretty conservative," says Bill Frappier,
national sales director for Goldsmith, a mannequin maker in
Long Island City, N.Y. Nevertheless, Mr. Frappier
acknowledges that many retailers prefer abstract displays,
which let them ignore makeup and hairdo. And he says a
robot-like mannequin called Multi-Man "turned this company
around."</p>
<p>Greneker, Los Angeles, makes a mannequin with a color TV
monitor for a head and a skateboard for a base. The company
also hopes to produce one with security cameras in place of
eyes.</p>
<p>There are holdouts against abstraction and robotics. Adel
Rootstein, New York, continues to turn out startlingly
realistic copies of men and women, with suntan and five
o'clock shadow optional. Executive vice president Nellie Fink
says, "A fabulous-looking mannequin makes a shopper think:
`That's what I'm going to look like in that suit or dress,'"
while an abstract display "loses the fantasy that shopping is
all about."</p>
