	<p class="article-leader">LOS ANGELES -- A federal court judge sentenced David
Arnold Feldman to 15 years in prison and ordered him to pay
restitution of $70.7 million to BankAmerica Corp., the
biggest loser in a $144 million mortgage investment scheme.
   Mr. Feldman, 50 years old, was convicted June 9 of three
counts of mail fraud and was acquitted of two other counts.
Five counts were dismissed during the trial for failure of
proof. Mr. Feldman was taken into custody yesterday after the
sentencing.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"A notice of appeal of the conviction and the sentence
will be filed" today, said Rodney Perlman, a Los Angeles
attorney representing Mr. Feldman. Judge Dickran Tevrizian
"exceeded his authority" in making the restitution order, the
attorney asserted.</p>
<p>Two other principal figures in the mortgage fraud pleaded
guilty earlier this year to reduced charges of mail fraud.
They are Kent Borden Rogers, 50, of Huntington Beach, Calif.,
and George Charles Ash Jr., 45, of Alta Loma, Calif. The
three men were indicted last year for scheming to sell what
proved to be practically worthless mortgage loans to 20 banks
and savings and loan associations.</p>
<p>The men promised high interest rates and assured investors
that their investments were protected by independent
underwriting policies, among other safeguards. Most of the
loans later went into default, and Bank of America, as the
trustee for most of the mortgage securities pools,
repurchased them and took $95 million in charges against the
1984 earnings of its parent, BankAmerica Corp.</p>
