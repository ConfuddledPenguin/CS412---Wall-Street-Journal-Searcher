	<p class="article-leader">Airports, in a takeoff on the friendly skies, are trying
to profit by becoming more friendly on the ground.
   The main things that drive passengers batty -- lousy
airline service, surly ticket agents and bad weather -- are
beyond an airport's control. But airport officials are
realizing, more and more, that they can ease a traveler's
pain, or make it worse. "When you're delayed, are you forced
to spend $5 on a hot dog? Or do you have a pleasant
experience?" asks Robert Bunnell, a vice president at Airport
Operators Council International in Washington.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>It's not always obvious, but airports are beginning to
offer consumers ways to spend their time there pleasantly or
productively. Several have opened business centers where
executives can fax on the fly. In Pittsburgh and Boston,
kiddie travelers can romp on slides and merry-go-rounds. Many
airports are jazzing up their retail shops and clamping down
on notoriously high food prices. Some even tried electronic
golf driving ranges.</p>
<p>"Airports have fallen behind in providing creature
comforts, and they're going to catch up in the next five
years," says Steven Reiss, the Alexandria, Va.-based
airport-design director for HNTB, a Kansas City, Mo.,
architectural and engineering firm. Nintendo games, rental
movies and exercise clubs will become common at airports, he
predicts.</p>
<p>Moreover, with airline delays increasing what is known as
passenger "dwell time" in terminals, it is in the financial
self-interest of airports to serve up appealing distractions.</p>
<p>In the past, many airports have fallen short with cramped
spaces, tacky souvenir stands and unappetizing food. "They
haven't always placed the needs of the traveler first,"
concedes Patrick Moscaritolo, director of Boston's Logan
International Airport. Tom Moriarity, a senior associate with
the Washington office of Halcyon Ltd., a real-estate
consultant with headquarters in Hartford, Conn., says,
"Airports are changing to keep pace with the public, which is
more knowledgeable and has higher expectations" than before.</p>
<p>The drive to make airports more attractive is spurred by
the increasing recognition among local communities -- which
usually own the airports -- that airports are important
marketing tools in attracting new businesses, expanding
convention trade and increasing domestic and international
air service. The operators believe improved services will
help them compete with other airports for passengers while
also bringing in more money.</p>
<p>Business travelers are prime targets. Since 1983, for
example, Tele-Trip Co., a unit of Mutual of Omaha Insurance
Cos., based in Omaha, Neb., has opened two dozen business
centers at 20 airports, including Hartsfield Atlanta
International Airport, Baltimore-Washington International
Airport, New York's La Guardia Airport and Los Angeles
International Airport. Most of the centers offer secretarial
and notary services, conference-room rentals and
overnight-mail service. Sending faxes -- which costs $6 for
the first page and $2.50 for each additional page -- is the
most popular service.</p>
<p>Harried parents with traveling tots are getting more
attention, too. At the Greater Pittsburgh International
Airport and Boston's Logan Airport, they can find refuge in
"Kidsport," special areas equipped with toy rocket ships,
child-sized furniture and nursing areas. "Sometimes the room
gets trashed, and toys and books disappear," says Pat Boyle,
a spokesman for the Pittsburgh airport. "But then we'll get a
gushy letter from some parent, who says, `Thank God it was
there.'"</p>
<p>Stapleton International Airport in Denver is about to open
a similar play area developed in cooperation with the local
Children's Museum. At Las Vegas's McCarran International
Airport, a baby-changing room that can be used by fathers or
mothers is a popular new feature.</p>
<p>Not all novel ideas work. One merchant operated electronic
driving ranges, called "Take Off and Tee Off," where
travelers could practice their golf swings between flights at
Pittsburgh and Denver. But the ranges closed for lack of
interest. The idea may get another try in the new Denver
airport, set to open in the fall of 1993.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, other innovations are taking off. Food is a
good example. The anonymous coffee shop serving mystery meat
is giving way to food courts, which feature several small
eateries, and food carts, which offer increased variety with
a modest inventory. Both are popular in malls.</p>
<p>Price controls are spreading, too. Airports used to award
contracts to the concessionaires that offered to pay the
airport the highest percentage of gross receipts, a practice
that critics say encouraged overcharging the public to drive
up revenue.</p>
<p>But, tired of hearing consumer complaints about $2 cups of
coffee, many airport officials are structuring "agreements so
that exorbitant prices aren't charged," says Richard Haury,
program manager for the new Denver airport and a senior vice
president at Irving, Texas-based Greiner Engineering Inc.
Many airports, including Portland (Ore.) International,
Boston Logan and Washington National, require prices to be
close to off-airport prices. In return, some charge lower
rents.</p>
<p>Washington National officials also scrapped the
traditional approach of relying on a single concessionaire to
run all the airport's watering holes. They instead hired a
developer who subcontracts space to competing restaurateurs
-- with spectacular results. At a year-old food court at the
USAir terminal, sales are clipping along at an impressive
$3.30 per departing passenger (a standard way of measuring
airport sales). That compares with an average $1.12 spent at
the airport's restaurants before the food court opened.</p>
<p>"What it says is, if you give people quality and products
at reasonable prices, people will spend the money," says
Clyde Bingman, manager of commercial programs for the
Metropolitan Washington Airports Authority, which runs
Washington National and Washington Dulles International
Airport.</p>
<p>Another food trend is the greater use of brand names.
"Instead of generic pizza, you might get Pizza Hut," says
Halcyon's Mr. Moriarity. The brand names assure travelers
they are getting value for their dollar, adds Mr. Bingman.
Haagen-Dazs Ice Cream, Au Bon Pain and Sbarro are
increasingly finding homes in airports.</p>
<p>Not to mention singles' bars. Anton's Bar and Grill at
Washington National is a popular nightspot. "What more could
you want?" says HNTB's Mr. Reiss. "You've got security,
anonymity, food, cocktails. . ." and if you don't like
another customer, "all you have to say is, `Sorry, got to
catch a plane.'"</p>
<p>In airport retailing, some national chains are becoming
interested in what they see as an affluent, untapped market.
Encouraged by the success of their two stores at John F.
Kennedy International Airport, officials at Bloomingdale's
Bloomie's Express plan to open four more stores in airports
this year and seven next year. Nature Co., which is owned by
CML Group Inc. of Acton, Mass., is "interested in pursuing"
an expansion into the airport market, says Jennifer Kaiser,
the company's director of public relations.</p>
<p>European airports have been far ahead of American ones in
turning their airports into quasi-shopping malls, with
Copenhagen and Amsterdam leading the list. Both have large
offerings of duty-free goods. Frankfurt, Rome and Zurich
airports also have assorted retail and food outlets.</p>
<p>Some U.S. airports are emphasizing stores featuring items
made locally or of local interest. "People really want
regional merchandise, not necessarily a mug stamped with a
logo with that city," says Sharon Bergman, senior director of
retail for Concession Air, one of the nation's biggest
airport concessionaires and a unit of Buffalo, N.Y.-based
Delaware North Co.</p>
<p>Thus, passengers can buy sourdough bread at San Francisco
International Airport, cajun food at New Orleans
International Airport and fresh lobsters at Boston Logan.
Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport, which will open a
major new terminal in November, will feature merchandise made
in Arizona or elsewhere in the Southwest.</p>
<p>The Portland airport has married both retail trends: Nike
Inc., whose corporate headquarters is nearby, has a store
there, and so do several small local retailers who are
pushing made-in-Oregon items and hiking supplies.</p>
<p>Such local items enhance efforts by airport designers to
instill a sense of place in bland airport terminals. At the
McCarran International Airport in Las Vegas, aluminum palm
trees are intermingled with 565 slot machines. The new
Phoenix terminal will display $2 million in art with
Southwestern motifs. It's not always easy for a community to
decide what identity to stress at the airport. "Some people
say Denver is a cowboy town," says Greiner's Mr. Haury, "yet
others say Denver is mountains."</p>
<p>Airports today ignore consumer needs at their own peril,
says Boston's Mr. Moscaritolo: "People can always fax or
teleconference. There are alternatives to getting on a
plane."</p>
