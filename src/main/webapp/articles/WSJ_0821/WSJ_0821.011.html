	<p class="article-leader">BUSH DEMANDED the release of 3,000 Americans trapped in
Iraq and Kuwait.
   Declaring for the first time that those detained in the
Mideast are hostages, the president said he would hold Iraq
responsible "for the safety and well-being of American
citizens held against their will." The State Department
announced that at least 12 Americans who had been staying in
hotels in Kuwait, which Iraq invaded Aug. 2, "have been
relocated by the Iraqis" to an unknown destination, possibly
Baghdad. At least 35 other Americans in Kuwait were moved
earlier by the Iraqis, and their whereabouts remain unknown.
A European diplomat said groups from several nations
apparently were being rounded up in Kuwait by the Iraqis.
Over the weekend, Iraq had said foreigners were going to be
used as human shields to protect Iraqi installations from
Western forces.</p>
