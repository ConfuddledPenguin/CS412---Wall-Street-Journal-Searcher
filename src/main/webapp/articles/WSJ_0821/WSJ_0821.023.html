	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- The Treasury bond market rambled through
another quiet trading session while investors sat on the
sidelines waiting for hints about the direction of interest
rates.
   But in the junk bond market, prices ended moderately to
sharply lower as investors worried about the prospects of a
recession. Adding to the market's bearish tone, Moody's
Investors Service Inc. reported that junk bond defaults are
running at a 19-year high.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>In the Treasury market, the benchmark 30-year bond ended
little changed. Shorter-term securities ended with modest
declines. The latest two-year notes, for example, finished
nearly 1/8 point lower, a loss of about $1.25 for a bond with
a $1,000 face amount.</p>
<p>But trading activity in the Treasury market "was
exceptionally light," said Charles Lieberman, a managing
director at Manufacturers Hanover Securities Corp.
"Basically, we are waiting for the Federal Open Market
Committee meeting to see whether the Federal Reserve
surprises us and eases monetary policy," he said.</p>
<p>The FOMC is the Fed's policy-making group, and its members
are scheduled to meet in Washington today to set monetary
policy and assess the state of the economy. Prior to the
recent rise in oil prices that followed Iraq's invasion of
Kuwait, it was widely expected that FOMC members would vote
to reduce short-term interest rates in an effort to keep the
economy from slipping into a recession.</p>
<p>But fearing that the oil price increases may stimulate
broad-based inflation, many economists now believe the Fed
will vote to keep credit policy unchanged.</p>
<p>The possibility that a policy change could occur kept many
investors away from the market.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Moody's Investors Service reported that 29
issuers of junk bonds defaulted on interest payments in the
first seven months of the year, representing a default rate
of 5.8%. That rate was only marginally higher than the 5.6%
default rate for all of 1989, but Moody's said that if the
current pace of defaults continues, 1990 will wind up with
the steepest corporate bond default rate since 1970, when the
collapse of Penn Central resulted in a 10.9% default rate.</p>
<p>Moody's said it expects the default rate to climb as
heavily indebted companies encounter financial trouble
brought about by a slowdown in consumer spending and the
threat of a recession spurred by oil prices.</p>
<p>In dollar terms, Moody's said roughly $8.4 billion of junk
bonds defaulted during the first seven months for an
annualized default rate of about 6.3% of total junk bonds
outstanding at the beginning of the year. By comparison, in
all of 1989, $9.4 billion of debt defaulted, for a
dollar-based default rate of 4.9%.</p>
<p>The most significant defaults occurred in companies
sensitive to trends in U.S. consumer spending, including
Campeau Corp.'s Federated Department Stores and Allied Stores
retailing units, which together accounted for 22% of
defaulted debt so far this year. Other major defaults
affected the debt of furniture and shoe conglomerate Interco
Inc., convenience store operator Southland Corp., and Western
Union Corp.</p>
<p>John Lonski, Moody's senior economist, said higher oil
prices are likely to relieve pressure on junk bond issuers
that are suppliers or producers of oil products.</p>
<p>But for others, he said, costlier crude is likely to add
to the already formidable challenges confronting steeply
leveraged companies by raising production costs, reducing
households' purchasing power and by keeping interest rates,
and thus refinancing costs, prohibitively high.</p>
<p>Another indication of rising credit problems is the
mounting level of credit rating downgrades within the junk
bond market. Between January and July, Moody's said it
downgraded four junk bond issuers for each one it upgraded,
including 52 rating downgrades to Caa, a total that is
already equal to Caa downgrades for all of 1989.</p>
<p>Treasury Securities</p>
<p>Treasurys ended slightly lower.</p>
<p>The benchmark 30-year bond ended at 97 31/32, down from 98
on Friday. The issue's yield, which moves in the opposite
direction from its price, was unchanged at 8.93%. The latest
two-year note ended at 99 23/32, down from 99 26/32 on
Friday. The yield rose to 8.14% from 8.08%.</p>
<p>The government sold a total of $18.4 billion of
three-month and six-month Treasury bills at its regular
weekly auction.</p>
<p>The average discount rate on three-month bills was 7.55%,
while the average rate on six-month bills was 7.45%. Those
were up from last week's auction when they were 7.41% and
7.31%, respectively.</p>
<p>Here are auction details:</p>
<p>Rates are determined by the difference between the
purchase price and face value. Thus, higher bidding narrows
the investor's return while lower bidding widens it. The
percentage rates are calculated on a 360-day year, while the
coupon-equivalent yield is based on a 365-day year.</p>

<p>Both issues are dated Aug. 23. The 13-week bills mature
Nov. 23, 1990, and the 26-week bills mature Feb. 21, 1991.</p>
<p>Corporate Issues</p>
<p>Junk bonds shrugged off gains in the stock market and
settled sharply lower as fears of recession and higher
inflation continued to unsettle investors.</p>
<p>The junk bond market sometimes moves more closely with the
stock market than other bond markets. But that wasn't the
case yesterday.</p>
<p>Prices of junk bonds, high-yield high-risk corporate
securities that have low or no credit ratings, varied greatly
yesterday. Most top-quality junk issues ended between 3/8 and
1/2 point lower, while middle and lower-tier issues suffered
even greater losses, finishing one to 1 1/2 points lower.</p>
<p>Junk bond investors said recession-prone bonds such as USG
Corp. and American Standard Inc. were particularly hard hit.
American Standard's 12.875% senior subordinated debentures
maturing in 2000 plunged three points to 90, while USG's
13.25% senior subordinated debentures due in 2000 tumbled two
points to close at 53.</p>
<p>By contrast, non-cyclical bonds such as issues from
supermarkets, food companies and other industries fared much
better. Among the market's stronger performers were Kroger
Co.'s 12.875% senior subordinated debentures, maturing in
1999, which finished unchanged at 101 1/4.</p>
<p>In the investment-grade corporate debt market, high-grade
corporate bonds ended little changed.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, PaineWebber Inc. said its private placement
group has received commitments for $100 million of 11.43%
senior notes due 1995 to be issued by Petroleos Mexicanos,
the Mexican national oil company.</p>
<p>PaineWebber said the notes are priced at par and yield
three percentage points above the yield on five-year Treasury
notes. PaineWebber said it expects the transaction to close
in late September.</p>
<p>The securities firm said the placement represents Pemex's
first entry into the U.S. private placement market since 1982
and follows offerings for Pemex in West Germany and Austria
earlier this year.</p>
<p>Foreign Bonds</p>
<p>Citicorp's $1.4 billion global credit-card backed
securities offering was the main focus of the Eurobond
market.</p>
<p>The issue was split into two parts. The public, registered
portion consisting of $1.25 billion of three-year notes had a
8 7/8% coupon and was priced at 99.91 to yield 8.912%. The
$155 million of subordinated credit-card notes was privately
placed. The three-year notes had a coupon of 9 1/8% and were
priced at 99.855 to yield 9.182%.</p>
<p>A Citicorp official described the issue, which was the
banking company's third such offering, as a "crisp, clean
transaction in a very difficult environment."</p>
<p>Traders said buyers were almost exclusively U.S.
institutions. European investors didn't buy large quantities
of the bonds, despite intensive marketing efforts. This was
partly because of worries about how the dollar will fare if
the Middle East crisis worsens. "The pricing seems fair; it's
just the timing that isn't great," said a syndicate manager
at a European bank.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, prices of most global government bonds
continued to tumble, and interest rates rose on concern about
events in the Persian Gulf.</p>
<p>Hardest hit among the major markets was France, where
prices fell nearly one point. Among benchmark French
government bonds, the 8.5% issue due 2019 fell 0.93 point
from late Friday in Paris to 82.00 to yield 10.49%.</p>
<p>British and West German government bonds ended moderately
lower.</p>
<p>But in Japan, prices of most government bonds firmed after
the Finance Ministry supported the market by purchasing 90
billion yen ($614.6 million) of government bonds. Still, the
yield on the benchmark No. 119 bond remained above 8%.</p>
<p>At the close of the Tokyo Stock Exchange, the No. 119 bond
was priced to yield 8.03%. The yield was as high as 8.10%
before the Finance Ministry purchases.</p>
<p>Municipals</p>
<p>Municipal bonds moved off lows and ended unchanged to 1/8
point lower.</p>
<p>In secondary action, the New Jersey Turnpike Authority's
7.20% issue of 2018 was 1/8 lower at 97 7/8 bid to yield
7.36%.</p>
<p>Mortgage-Backed Securities</p>
<p>Prices closely reflected the Treasury market's activity.</p>
<p>Government National Mortgage Association 9 1/2% securities
for September delivery were off 1/32 at 98 15/32; Federal
Home Loan Mortgage Corp. 9 1/2% securities were down 3/32 at
98; and Federal National Mortgage Association 9 1/2%
securities were 3/32 lower at 98 17/32.</p>
