	<p class="article-leader">Mail Boxes Etc., San Diego, said it recovered from an
insurance company $400,000 of a $2.8 million payment recently
made to settle certain litigation.
   The insurance recovery will result in a gain of about
$240,000 in the second quarter ending Oct. 31 because the
entire settlement amount has already been written off, the
company said.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The litigation involved charges by Nancy Tash, daughter of
the company's late founder, Gerald Aul, that the company and
its president, Anthony DeSio, fraudulently induced her to
sell her 23% stake in 1983. Mail Boxes is a franchiser of
postal-business and communication service centers.</p>
