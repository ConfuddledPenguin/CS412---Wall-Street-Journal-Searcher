	<p class="article-leader">Boeing Co. said All Nippon Airways Co. recently exercised
five options for 747-400 jumbo jets, elevating them to
firm-order status, and at the same time took out 17 new
options for the wide-body aircraft.
   An announcement about the options placement, which
eventually could be valued at as much as $3 billion to the
Seattle aerospace manufacturer, is expected to be made
Tuesday in Tokyo. Conversion of the five options, meanwhile,
is valued at about $650 million.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Combined with orders placed during 1988 and 1989 but not
yet filled, All Nippon now has booked 43 Boeing 747-400s. Of
that total, Boeing said, 26 are currently counted as firm.
Options are important because, while they don't add to
Boeing's official backlog, they seal a carrier's delivery
position.</p>
<p>All Nippon, which has been known until recently primarily
as a domestic airline, is in need of planes to expand its
international routes. Japan's second largest airline, it now
connects Japan to 14 destinations in North America, Europe,
Asia and Australia, and intends to start flights to Paris in
October, and to New York next March. By 1995, the company
aims to double the percentage of international flights from
its present 18%.</p>
<p>All Nippon's decision follows a string of large orders for
Boeing from Asia in recent months, spotlighting how air
travel in the Pacific Rim continues to boom, even as signs of
weakness have developed in the U.S. market. In June, the
company received orders for 23 747-400s by Korean Airlines,
totaling $4.8 billion. It also has a $2 billion order from
China's Civil Aviation Administration and a $3.1 billion
order for 747-400s from Japan Air Lines.</p>
<p>Japan's carriers have been increasing competition to
provide international flights recently. Although Japan Air
Lines was for many years the only one with the right to fly
international routes, government deregulation in 1985
encouraged other airlines to provide services abroad. In
addition, the soaring number of Japanese tourists recently
has strengthened the demand for overseas flights.</p>
<p>Adding to its fleet of 747-400s, which would carry about
350 passengers in All Nippon's three-class seating
arrangement, is therefore seen as a necessary move for the
airline. Should All Nippon go on to purchase the planes, it
will also lower the average age of its aircraft to less than
seven years from the present 7.8 years. Delivery of the
planes, which will be powered by General Electric Co.
engines, could begin in 1995.</p>
<p>The planes ordered earlier will be delivered starting next
week.</p>
<p>In addition to the 747-400s, All Nippon is also shopping
around for about 300 other wide-body planes, and is looking
at models made by Boeing, McDonnell Douglas Corp. and Airbus
Industrie.</p>
<p>In the year ended March 31, All Nippon posted operating
revenue of $4.3 billion, up 16.4% from the previous year. Net
income rose 3% to $95 million.</p>
