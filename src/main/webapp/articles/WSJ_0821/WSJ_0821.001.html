	<p class="article-leader">Over the past 25 years, in essays and reviews, two
collections of stories, a novel and the remarkable
autobiographical fictions -- verbal snapshots, anecdotes,
journal entries, full-scale memoirs and stories -- collected
in his new book, "Shuffle" (Farrar, Straus & Giroux, 162
pages, $18.95), Leonard Michaels has perfected a literary
style of uncommon lucidity, force and ease. These are
classical virtues, to be sure, but Mr. Michaels's subjects,
his voice and emotional range, his intelligence and wit, all
are distinctly American, late 20th century, anything but
antique.
   Out of familiar material -- Lower East Side Jewish family
life during the war, Greenwich Village sex and friendship in
the '50s and early '60s, ever more desperate sex and
careerism in Berkeley, Los Angeles and New York from the time
of women's liberation to the present age of glitz -- he
constructs literary miniatures that are dense but go like
lightning. They seem larger, more spacious and alive with
precise facts and meanings than most gasping novels. But for
all their artful compression and meticulous diction, they're
never precious, never merely out to shock or elicit snobbish
admiration. They always stay close to the way people actually
talk and act when they're too driven by their ferocious,
guilty needs to even think about good manners.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Mr. Michaels has always cared more about his stories than
literary fashion. Twenty years ago, when cast-iron whimsy and
slap-happy sprawling comedies of the absurd were in style, he
built sharp little diamond structures that said much more
than most about radical sex and politics a la mode. When gray
videotaped minimalism became the rage, he kept infusing
stories with operatic feeling and color and an almost
19th-century belief in character. When feminism threatened to
dwindle into parlor games, he wrote a novel, "The Men's
Club," that portrayed the sexes as participants in chemical
warfare.</p>
<p>Most unfashionably, he's neither a self-advertising
moralist nor an aesthetic nihilist. He still believes, it
seems, that a literary work has an intrinsic moral power. His
characters seethe and erupt in all too modern ways (breaking
down, betraying each other, spouting radical chicanery or
psychobabble), and he implies that they can and must be seen
as desperate moral, psychological and historical beings. But
he never passes facile, moralistic judgments; he dramatizes
and leaves the rest to us. He often writes in fragments, but
he constructs an immediately recognizable picture of
"contemporary reality." In this he's closer to modernist
collages than to postmodern videos. He's always telling
stories with palpable beginnings, middles and ends. He's
deadly serious, witty and bursting with feeling.</p>
<p>His new book falls into three sections. The first is a
highly fractured journal of California sex, marriage and
divorce among academics, shrinks and literary and movie
types. We careen from social satire to a quote from Lord
Byron ("And, after all, what is a lie? 'Tis but the truth in
masquerade") to a glimpse of Lower East Side family life ("I
phoned my mother. She said, `You sound happy. What's the
matter?') to garish sexual anecdotes and confessions to
scenes of tormented, competitive friendships. The key word
seems to be "ferocity."</p>
<p>The central section of the book is the most traditional:
strong, highly condensed memoirs of Mr. Michaels's father and
mother, of a high-school English teacher (a former
ball-turret gunner who brings his trauma to the teaching of
"The Winter's Tale"), and a grad-school anecdote.</p>
<p>But the last and longest section is the triumph of the
book: a memoir of the author's first marriage that portrays
with great intensity and conviction his grim transition from
late adolescence to young manhood and maturity and,
simultaneously, the shift in American life (feeling, thought,
fantasy) that took place between the late '50s and the early
'60s. Mr. Michaels's fiction has always shown the continuity
between personal and political or cultural history, and in
this narrative the central figure of Sylvia, an exotic
Jewish-American Greenwich Village student with "a figure and
face like Egyptian statuary," embodies the tortured,
torturing spirit of the age. Reader, he married her, and it
was truly hell.</p>
<p>In June 1960 he dropped out of graduate school and
returned to New York with the vague idea of writing stories.
Walking through Greenwich Village he feels a "new apocalyptic
atmosphere . . . Elvis Presley and Allen Ginsberg were the
kings of feeling, and the word love was like a proclamation
with the force of kill. I saw a blunt admonition chalked on
the wall of the subway station: ---- Hate. Weird delirium was
in the air and in the sluggish, sensual crowds as I pressed
toward the sooty-faced tenement . . ."</p>
<p>There he meets Sylvia Bloch and, "like a couple doomed to
a sacrificial assignation," they make love in her squalid
apartment: "Through the tall, open window of the living room
we saw the night sky and heard people proceed along MacDougal
Street, as in a lunatic carnival, screaming, breaking glass,
wanting to hit, needing meanness. Someone played a guitar in
another apartment. Someone was crying. Lights flew across the
walls and ceiling. Radios were loud. The city made its
statement in the living room. None of it had to do with us,
lying naked on the couch, just wide enough for two, against
the brick wall." It's all there, even in the beginning: the
violent city, the violent age, their violent sex, her
madness, his obsession, their combat, their mutual
destruction. Such a story brings us as close to tragedy as
contemporary prose is likely to get.</p>
