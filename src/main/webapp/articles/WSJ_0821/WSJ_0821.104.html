	<p class="article-leader">The Voting Rights Act was passed in the 1960s to guarantee
the electoral participation of minorities and to strike down
discriminatory election laws. But since it was amended in
1982, it has often been used to promote a racial spoils
system. Districts that once discriminated against minorities
are now twisted to guarantee the election of liberals and to
exclude other minority voices. A federal appeals court has
now decided to study charges that the law is being perverted
into a means for backdoor political power.
   The case of Sarah Flores has brought the issue front and
center. Until this month, she was favored to win a fall
runoff election and become the first Hispanic to serve on the
powerful Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors. Then
federal Judge David Kenyon invalidated her primary victory on
the Catch-22 ground that the district lines had been
gerrymandered so that no Hispanic could win under them. Mrs.
Flores, a longtime Hispanic activist, protested. Last week
the federal appeals court delayed both her scheduled election
and the new election ordered by Judge Kenyon while it studies
the matter.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The local ACLU chapter and other liberal groups that
charged the current district lines dilute Hispanic voting
power are more interested in politics than voting rights.
Otherwise, they would agree that Mrs. Flores, a lifetime
county employee who won 68% of the Hispanic vote in her
primary, is both qualified and has real Hispanic support. The
problem is that Mrs. Flores isn't their kind of Hispanic. She
is a Republican.</p>
<p>To avoid a Flores victory and continued conservative
control of the Board of Supervisors, liberal activists
persuaded Judge Kenyon to cancel her election and adopt their
own gerrymandered district map. The poodle-shaped district
shown nearby packs in as many Hispanic Democrats as possible
while excluding Mrs. Flores's political base and, indeed, her
home (see accompanying illustration -- WSJ Aug. 21, 1990).
Several hundred thousand residents of the old district would
be denied the right to vote for a supervisor for at least two
years.</p>
<p>The appeals-court ruling is expected in October, but Mrs.
Flores has no better than an even chance of winning. That's
because Judge Kenyon's original ruling striking down the
existing districts was conveniently issued the day before
Mrs. Flores's first-place showing. That means the fact that
Mrs. Flores is one step away from winning can't easily be
made part of the judicial record.</p>
<p>There is still a way to expose the political hypocrisy at
work in the Flores case. The court-ordered delay of the
election for supervisor means that Pete Schabarum, the
retiring incumbent, will serve until an election is held next
year. If he chooses to leave office on schedule, Governor
George Deukmejian would be free to appoint Sarah Flores to
take the seat she was favored to win anyway.</p>
<p>The travesty of a court throwing one Hispanic out of
office on the grounds of discrimination so another Hispanic
can take her place would be lost on no one. Perhaps it would
even stir the Bush Justice Department to question its
apparent policy of supporting every Voting Rights Act lawsuit
liberal groups can dream up.</p>
