	<p class="article-leader">Jacqueline Jackson, wife of Jesse Jackson, attended
Washington Mayor Marion Barry's drug and perjury trial in
early August, sitting next to Mr. Barry's wife. In June,
Jesse Jackson traveled to Memphis, where he spoke to a
congressional prayer breakfast sponsored by Rep. Harold Ford
(D., Tenn.). Mr. Ford is awaiting a retrial on bank fraud
charges, the first trial having ended in a hung jury. At the
prayer breakfast, Mr. Jackson said Mr. Ford should not be
tried again. "It is the Justice Department that is on trial,"
Mr. Jackson told the crowd of 1,500.
   In response to news reports of mass killings of civilians
in Liberia's civil war, Mr. Jackson appeared on television,
flanked by other black leaders, and called on the Bush
administration to take a more active role there. And Mr.
Jackson is running for the District of Columbia's "shadow"
Senate seat, a position created by the District's city
council to lobby Congress for D.C. statehood. If he wins, Mr.
Jackson says, he will seek access to the Senate floor.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The common thread to these and other Jackson actions
during the past year or so is their popularity with blacks,
but not with whites. These actions confirm Sen. Ernest
Holling's (D., S.C.) description of Mr. Jackson's "Rainbow
coalition" as "the black-bow coalition." Mr. Jackson's
actions make little sense for someone running for president
of a nation that is only 12% black. But it makes a great deal
of sense for someone who wants to be a power-broker for the
black community -- especially when Mr. Jackson's role as the
pre-eminent black leader in the nation is being challenged,
at least in the mainstream/white media, by Gov. Douglas
Wilder of Virginia.</p>
<p>Mr. Wilder's challenge to Mr. Jackson is based on his
demonstrated ability to win white votes. In response, Mr.
Jackson is saying, in effect, "Yes, but I am the leader of
black voters." Although Mr. Wilder has ordered Virginia's
state institutions to divest themselves of stock in
corporations that do business in South Africa, Mr. Wilder
cannot match Mr. Jackson in public gestures that appeal to
the black community. If Mr. Wilder made gestures of support
for Marion Barry and Harold Ford, it would alienate Mr.
Wilder's white supporters. By not worrying about his
popularity with whites, Mr. Jackson remains freer to say and
do things that appeal to blacks.</p>
<p>In this way, Mr. Jackson hopes to make clear to the
national Democratic Party that it is he, and not Mr. Wilder,
who can keep black voters in the fold. Whether the Wilder or
Jackson approach -- getting on the inside and compromising or
staying on the outside and evangelizing -- better serves the
interests of the black community is open to debate. But if
Mr. Jackson's strategy succeeds, the Democratic Party could
face the same dilemma in 1992 it had in '84 and '88 --
appeasing a popular black leader at the expense of
much-needed white support.</p>
