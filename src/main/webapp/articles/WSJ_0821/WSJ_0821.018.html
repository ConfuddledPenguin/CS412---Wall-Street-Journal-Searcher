	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Consolidated Edison Co. of New York said that
it restored power to all of Manhattan's financial district, a
week after a fire knocked out service Aug. 13.
   Power is being drawn from three substations that serve
areas adjacent to the Brooklyn Bridge substation damaged in
the fire.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"It's a smaller pool (of power)," acknowledged a company
spokeman, "but there's still an adequate reserve." He said
that the 50-block area was "nowhere near" drawing off all
available power.</p>
<p>Con Edison said that only 10 customers remained without
power because the utility's crews have been unable to gain
access to their buildings to reconnect them. Many firms in
the area had been using diesel generators during the
emergency.</p>
