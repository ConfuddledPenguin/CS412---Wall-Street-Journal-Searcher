	<p class="article-leader">Try finding a church manual that tells how to blend the
squeal of racing car tires with the soprano section of a
choir, or how to handle a blast of exhaust at Holy Communion.
   Those are real questions for 10 Denver churches that find
themselves along the circuit of that city's downtown Grand
Prix this Friday through Sunday. And some of the pastors
aren't pleased that they have to come up with answers.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"It's not that the churches don't want to be a participant
with the city" in the auto race, says the Rev. Robert West,
pastor of St. Paul's Lutheran Church. "It's just that we
don't want our right to worship disregarded."</p>
<p>Mr. West, along with the Rev. John Wilcox, pastor of
nearby Central Presbyterian Church, complained to city
officials months ago that street closings along the 1.9-mile
racecourse would keep many parishioners home. And those who
got through would hear more thunder from the streets than the
pulpit. Still, the city approved the race.</p>
<p>As a result, Mr. Wilcox's flock plans to pull up stakes
this Sunday and worship with another congregation -- one
whose church is well away from the racecourse. "My philosophy
of life is when you're licked, you don't waste time and stew
in it," he says.</p>
<p>Mr. West, on the other hand, is staying put. "We may end
up with just an organ recital," he concedes. The Grand Prix's
organizers have agreed to provide an off-duty police officer
to keep race fans from parking in the church's lot.</p>
<p>Race officials have been working hard to ease the concerns
of the clerics (as well as those of local retailers and
neighborhood groups). They are distributing more than 100,000
"traffic brochures," detailing street closings and alternate
routes, and issuing parking passes for churchgoers.</p>
<p>That pleased the Rev. C.B. Woodrich, pastor of Holy Ghost
Roman Catholic Church. Aware that he will have two weddings
this weekend, race officials gave the wedding coordinators
maps so that brides, grooms and guests could make it to the
church on time.</p>
<p>Father Woodrich sees the race actually offering a way to
fill pews, through a little advertising he'll do among the
thousands of race fans Denver is expecting. "I'm going to
make sure they know in the hotels where I am," he says. "I'm
looking for good Mass attendance."</p>
