	<p class="article-leader">TORONTO -- Denison Mines Ltd. reported a second-quarter
net loss of 97.1 million Canadian dollars (US$84.9 million),
after writing down half its oil and gas assets and providing
for the cost of reducing the work force at its Canadian
uranium operations.
   Denison, a Toronto-based resources concern, said it also
omitted paying dividends on its preferred shares. The company
said it made the move because of declining profit from
operations brought on by lower oil and gas production and
prices as well as weak potash prices. The company hasn't paid
cash dividends on its common shares since 1986.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The latest quarterly loss compared with net profit in the
year-earlier period of C$8 million, or one Canadian cent a
share. Revenue fell to C$84.2 million from C$98.5 million.</p>
<p>On the Toronto Stock Exchange, Denison's Class A shares
plunged 35 Canadian cents, or 18%, to close yesterday at
C$1.65. The Class B shares fell 22 Canadian cents to C$1.35.</p>
<p>Denison's preferred stock also plummetted. The Series A
preferred shares closed at C$7.50, down C$4.75. The Series B
shares halved in value, losing C$7.88 to close at C$7.88.</p>
<p>Denison spokesman Ed Shiller said the company wrote down
C$80 million on its Italian oil interests because of lower
crude prices and a reduction in proven reserves. He said the
write-down doesn't reflect the economic value of the
property, however, because of rising oil prices since the end
of the second quarter.</p>
<p>Mr. Shiller said the write-down shouldn't affect the
company's ability to sell its overseas oil and gas interests,
which have been up for sale for more than a year. Disposing
of these interests, which are located in Italy, Greece, Spain
and Egypt, is critical to Denison's ability to reduce its
burdensome debt load, analysts say. The company had debt of
C$316 million as of Dec. 31, 1989.</p>
<p>Denison also has been hurt by costly uranium operations
and market prices that are at record lows. The company
previously announced plans to reduce the work force at its
Elliot Lake, Ontario, uranium mine by about 30% as of Aug. 1.
Denison said it took a provision of C$4.2 million in the
second quarter to cover costs of scaling back operations at
the mine.</p>
