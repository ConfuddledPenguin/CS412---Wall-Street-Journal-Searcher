	<p class="article-leader">Cincinnati -- Mike York, a boyish looking 25-year-old
pitcher, was called up from Buffalo by the Pittsburgh Pirates
to make his first Major League start against the Cincinnati
Reds to begin a four-game series at Riverfront Stadium here
Friday. He didn't mind admitting he was a tad nervous. "I
didn't know if I was going to bounce my first pitch or throw
it over the backstop," he said.
   But he threw a strike, and then some more. He went seven
innings, gave up six hits and no runs, and the Pirates won,
7-1.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The Pirates also won the second game of Friday's
doubleheader, 4-3, when shortstop Jay Bell, who'd had just
four hits in his previous 39 at bats, went three-for-four and
drove in the winning run in the eighth inning. They won
Saturday, 3-1, behind the pitching of Zane Smith, just
obtained in trade from Montreal, and reliefer Doug Bair, a
40-year-old journeyman called up from Buffalo the week
before.</p>
<p>On Sunday, the Bucs whipped 'em again, 6-3, and, for a
change, a couple of their certified heroes did the damage.
Doug Drabek pitched into the seventh inning for his 16th win,
and Bobby Bonilla hit a three-run homer. That was okay with
manager Jim Leyland. "Moving guys around like we have keeps
you thinking -- you don't get many days off," he smiled.</p>
<p>Then he paused and continued. "Maybe that's the way it's
supposed to be this year," he said. "Nobody in our league is
sitting back and pushing buttons."</p>
<p>Looked at differently, though, Pittsburgh's sweep of the
Reds might have shown that nobody else is pushing his buttons
better than Leyland. Besides introducing himself to a number
of his pitchers, the slim skipper spent the series rotating
Gary Redus and Sid Bream at first base, Rafael Belliard and
Jose Lind at second, Belliard and Bell at shortstop, Jeff
King and Wally Backman at third and Don Slaught and Mike
Lavalliere at catcher. He might have jockeyed his outfield,
too, but his main reserve there, R.J. Reynolds, is out with a
pulled hamstring.</p>
<p>The extent to which Leyland has juggled his pitching is
attested to by the remarkable fact that York's victory
brought to 19 the number of Pirate hurlers who have
registered wins this season. If that's not a record, it
oughta be.</p>
<p>The upshot of all the prestidigitation was that Pittsburgh
departed steamy River City with a two-game lead over New York
in the National League East and the best record in the
league, whatever the compass point, at 71 wins and 49 losses.
The latter distinction formerly was held by the Reds, the
season-long leader in the loop's Western sector, and despite
a 6 1/2-game divisional edge with the campaign three-fourths
over, its surrender did not sit well with Reds manager Lou
Piniella.</p>
<p>After Saturday's loss, Lou lamented he was offended by his
team's lack of offense, and added, "I've been very patient
with a lot of people, but I'm starting to lose my patience."
Sunday's setback seemed to leave him more sad than steamed,
but he repeated the theme. "We gotta score more runs," he
said. "We got the people here. We just gotta get them going."</p>
<p>Piniella didn't say who in particular he was upset with,
but a poll of Cincinnati fans surely would place
centerfielder Eric Davis on top of their guess list. The
swift and powerful Eric the Red has been the Cincy hero since
his 1985 debut, but has been booed doghouseward this year as
a result of a .224 batting average. He's getting company
there, though: Among the Reds position players who start
regularly, only second-baseman Mariano Duncan, the team
leader at .326, has improved his batting average since the
All Star-game break.</p>
<p>Lack of runs of late has meant lack of leads, which, in
turn, has meant that Piniella hasn't been able to use one of
his prime strengths, the bullpen duo of Randy Myers and Rob
Dibble. Those two gents, wicked fastballers both, have
combined for eight wins, 32 saves and 173 strikeouts in 136
innings. But neither appeared against the Pirates, because,
well, I already told you why. Suffice it to say that the
Reds, who won 33 of their first 45, have lost 22 of their
last 40.</p>
<p>The Pirates, on the other hand, have been models of
consistency. They won 14 of 20 in April, 15 of 26 in May, 14
of 27 in June and 15 of 26 in July, and were 13-8 in August
through Sunday. And this, you'll recall, is much the same
gang that limped home fifth in the NL East last year.</p>
<p>"Yeah, our lineup hasn't changed too much, but we're older
now but still young, if I make myself clear," says Barry
Bonds, the Bucs leftfielder. Bonds, 26, has made himself
clearer on the field by making his fourth season in the bigs
his best, with 24 home runs, 90 runs batted in and 42 stolen
bases to date. Fifth-year man Bonilla, age 27, has chipped in
similarly with 28 HRs and 83 RBI, and seven-year vet Andy Van
Slyke, 29, has had 13 and 54, respectively, despite injuries.</p>
<p>Bair, performing for his seventh Major League team over a
12-year career, chimed in with the wisdom of longevity.
"We've been fortunate when we've had to be. You can't
overemphasize that side of things," said he.</p>
<p>And, indeed, the Bucs got lucky a couple times last
weekend. In Friday's nightcap, Bell drove in the game winner
by barely beating out a dribbler to third base, and on
Saturday the Reds' Billy Hatcher missed a three-run homer by
a few foul feet.</p>
<p>Further, they've had a little help from their foes, albeit
inadvertently. On Sunday, Reds starting pitcher Jack
Armstrong gave up five hits and seven walks through five
innings but trailed only 2-1. Singles by Backman and Belliard
opened the Pittsburgh sixth, and Van Slyke hit one out of the
park foul before flying out to deepest center.</p>
<p>Up came Bonilla and the crowd stirred, expecting a
pitching change. Piniella stuck with Armstrong, though, and
Bobby stuck the ball into the second deck behind right field.</p>
<p>"I had Dibble ready, but the catcher said he {Armstrong}
was throwing well, and it was still a 2-1 game," explained
Lou.</p>
<p>Of such choices are losers -- and winners -- made.</p>
