	<p class="article-leader">DETROIT -- Ford Motor Co. is offering cut-rate financing
in an effort to boost disappointing sales of its new twin
subcompact models, the Ford Escort and the Mercury Tracer.
   Escort sales are running more than 20% behind last year's
pace, and are the big reason behind Ford's drop in market
share so far this year.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The incentive financing program, which began Aug. 9 and
runs until Sept. 3, will allow Escort and Tracer buyers to
obtain 4.8% financing on loans up to 48 months. In 10
northeastern states, buyers will have the option of taking
$500 cash instead of the budget financing.</p>
<p>The moves come on top of an earlier Ford program that
gives $500 to Escort and Tracer buyers who are purchasing
their first car. Fred Ricart, a Ford dealer in Columbus,
Ohio, said his Escort sales have dropped about 50% this year,
but he added that the new programs have already begun
reviving sales.</p>
<p>Ford's share of the U.S. car market fell to 21% in the
first seven months of this year from 22.8% last year. Early
this year, Ford officials predicted the company would gain
market share in 1990, but now that goal is looking difficult
to achieve. If Ford's share of new-car sales does drop, it
will be the first such decline since 1986.</p>
<p>Boosting sales of the fuel-efficient Escort and Tracer is
important for another reason as well: It helps Ford to keep
selling big cars with far lower gas mileage but far higher
profit margins. This year, Ford expects its cars to average
less than 26.5 miles per gallon, well under the federal
standard of 27.5 miles per gallon. Ford won't pay a penalty
because of credits earned from previous years, but the
credits will run out in a year or so.</p>
<p>Ford invested $1.9 billion to develop the new Escort,
which is based on a similar model from its Japanese
affiliate, Mazda Motor Corp. When the 1991-model Escort first
appeared in April, it had trouble competing with the 1990
Escort, which had a lower base price and carried a $1,000
rebate as well.</p>
