	<p class="article-leader">PITTSBURGH -- Cyclops Industries Inc. said it will close
its Detroit strip steel operation.
   The steel company said efforts to make the division
profitable had failed. The closing, which will occur in the
fourth quarter, will affect 100 workers. Cyclops had a
second-quarter loss of $11.3 million, or $1.62 a share, after
a $13.1 million restructuring charge.</p>
