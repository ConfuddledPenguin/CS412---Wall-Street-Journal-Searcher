	<p class="article-leader">Jacor Communications Inc. said it reached a debt
restructuring accord with its bank lenders but still faces an
Oct. 15 deadline to raise $15 million in fresh equity.
   Under terms of the new accord, Jacor has met all
previously extended interest payments, the company said. In
addition, Jacor, which owns 13 radio stations in eight cities
as well as other media properties, said it reduced the
principal of its bank credit outstanding by $3.5 million.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>As part of the new lending accord, Jacor noted that its
banks extended to Oct. 15 or later their waiver of a
provision requiring the company to raise $15 million in fresh
equity. Jacor does not expect to meet the Oct. 15 deadline
and said it is seeking a further extension. It noted,
however, that "there can be no assurance that a further
extension will be granted."</p>
<p>Moreover, the Cincinnati-based company noted that as a
condition of the agreement, Jacor agreed to continue to defer
indefinitely certain payments on subordinated indebtedness
and warrants and cash dividends on its capital stock. Jacor
said it has not yet obtained from the holders of these
obligations a consent to such deferral. Failure to obtain
consent will result in a default.</p>
