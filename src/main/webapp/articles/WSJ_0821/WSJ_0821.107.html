	<p class="article-leader">Beset by slow sales and steep losses, Data General Corp.
plans another big round of layoffs, company insiders said.
   The cutbacks could total at least 2,000, or 17% of Data
General's work force of 11,700, and are expected to be
announced in early September.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>At the same time, Ronald L. Skates, president and chief
executive officer, denied industry speculation that he has
been seeking a buyer for the big minicomputer maker, based in
Westborough, Mass. "We aren't talking with anyone about
selling the company," he said in an interview.</p>
<p>The layoffs would be the latest in a series at the
loss-plagued company, shrinking employment from a peak of
17,700 in 1985, its last profitable year. Revenue peaked at
$1.36 billion in 1988.</p>
<p>A Data General spokesman yesterday wouldn't rule out
further cutbacks, and said, "We're going to take whatever
steps are necessary to become profitable," Mr. Skates added,
"We are doing everything we can to downsize the company."</p>
<p>Data General is trying to transform itself from a
traditional minicomputer manufacturer to a maker of
workstations and computer network servers, built around
standard Unix operating software and low-cost,
standard-design microprocessors supplied by Motorola Inc.</p>
<p>But the transition has taken longer than Data General
executives had hoped, as competition in the workstation
market has become more intense and sales of the company's
older minicomputer line eroded somewhat faster than expected.
The new workstation line, which is aggressively priced and
has received good technical reviews, is expected to bring in
sales of more than $100 million this year. Still, sales from
the older minicomputer line are likely to fall by more than
that sum, estimated Barry F. Willman, a Sanford C. Bernstein
& Co. analyst.</p>
<p>Analysts said Data General has a relatively strong balance
sheet, with only $58 million in long-term debt and $93
million in cash. But they said that further work-force
reductions are inevitable. "They've been losing money a lot
faster than they've been able to cut costs," Jay Stevens, an
analyst with Dean Witter Reynolds Inc., said.</p>
<p>In the past, Motorola, a big communications equipment
maker based in Schaumburg, Ill., has been mentioned as a
potential suitor for Data General, because of the strategic
fit of the two companies' technology. But analysts discount
this possibility, noting that Motorola recently entered the
computer systems business on its own and may not want to
invest in Data General's headaches. A Motorola spokesman
declined to comment yesterday.</p>
<p>In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday,
Data General shares closed near the 52-week low of $5,
finishing at $5.75, up 12.5 cents, giving the company an
indicated market value of $172.5 million. At the current
stock price, the company's value is less than 15% of annual
revenue, and well below its book value, or assets minus
liabilities, of $16 a share.</p>
<p>For its third quarter ended June 30, Data General had a
net loss of $21.4 million, or 71 cents a share, on a 1.2%
decline in revenue to $302.4 million. The loss, though
narrower than the year-earlier third-quarter deficit of $23.1
million, or 79 cents a share, after a $6.3 million one-time
gain, was far larger than most analysts had expected. Data
General also backed off an earlier forecast that it would
break even or even show a profit in the fiscal fourth
quarter.</p>
