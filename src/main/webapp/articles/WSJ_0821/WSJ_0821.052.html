	<p class="article-leader">LONDON -- Overthrown in 1939 through the connivance of
Hitler and Stalin, the legitimately elected government of
Poland packed up its state seals and the handwritten original
of its constitution and decamped to Romania. After a stop in
France and some complications involving communism, it
established itself here, in a posh corner house with a
cream-painted portico at 43 Eaton Place. It is still at the
same address 51 years later, and in no hurry to move home.
   "You can have a very long tenancy," says Bohdan Wendorff,
Head of Chancellery and undersecretary in the Ministry of
Justice. "We've got this building until 2044."</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Mr. Wendorff, who is 86 years old, sits at his desk in the
front office on a quiet Tuesday, finishing a cheese sandwich.
(The government meets on Mondays and Wednesdays.) On a table
behind him, the day's mail awaits opening: Polish newspapers
from the United States and Australia, the phone bill, an
official-looking envelope marked, "Urgent Reply Requested.
Open Now. #5,000 Cash Prize."</p>
<p>When war broke out, Mr. Wendorff was a county clerk in
Poland's Interior Ministry. He escaped to join Poland's Army
in France, then served under British command and in 1945
became aide-de-camp to the first president of the Polish
Government in Exile. His 18 fellow ministers and
undersecretaries all fled, too, and suffered the war's
ordeals -- imprisoned in Siberia, embattled at Tobruk -- and
the indignity of its outcome for Poland. As a point of honor,
they vowed never to set foot in their homeland until it was
free.</p>
<p>"I know everything about protocol," Mr. Wendorff says as
he rummages through a cabinet and pulls out the state seals;
they look like brass doorknobs. "I've got the constitution
upstairs," he says, going away for a few minutes and coming
back with a large cardboard folder. He opens it to pages of
faded Polish pen strokes from 1935. "Of course it will go
back to Poland. Our president will bring it back for the new
president -- when he's elected."</p>
<p>A man by the name of Wojciech Jaruzelski, currently
residing at Belwedere Palace in Warsaw, labors under the
impression that he is president of Poland. On that detail,
Mr. Wendorff begs to differ. His president is Ryszard
Kaczorowski, a retired accountant currently hard at work in
the top-floor office of "the castle," the exiles' name for 43
Eaton Place.</p>
<p>Warsaw's new leaders have renamed the country to conform
with the brass plate on the castle's front door: Republic of
Poland, it has always read. And they have crowned the eagle
in the national emblem to match the one on Mr. Wendorff's
mantle. But the exiles are fussy. The election of 1989 that
empowered Solidarity and finished communism was rigged to
spare some of the communists. Until a free vote expels them
all, the constitution stays here.</p>
<p>"As far as we're concerned, Jaruzelski belongs in court,
not in the presidency," says Jerzy Kozniewski, who is finance
minister and also in the travel business. At 63, he is the
government's youngest member. "What exists there now is not a
sovereign country. We are still the true voice of independent
Poland. We are the mouthpiece."</p>
<p>It is a busy Monday. The ministries of Military Matters,
Emigre Affairs, Education and Culture -- half a dozen people
-- are meeting around the long mahogany table in the cabinet
room. At the finance ministry (a small back office) Mr.
Kozniewski sits beside the green-metal safe while his
bureaucracy, one elderly man named Marek Swieszkowski,
shuffles accounts at the desk.</p>
<p>"Things have gotten more difficult for us," Mr. Kozniewski
admits, since Solidarity formed a government of its own. In
simpler days of tyranny, Poland's opposition made 43 Eaton
Place a regular stop on trips west. But when Lech Walesa and
Prime Minister Tadeusz Mazowiecki came to London this year,
they had to snub the Government in Exile, lest their
authority (and Gen. Jaruzelski's) be cast into doubt. It has
put a slight edge on life at the castle.</p>
<p>"You'd think they invented the idea that Poland could be
free," Mr. Kozniewski says. "They're grateful, but they want
to make us a footnote in history. To return sovereignty now
would be nonsense. We waited half a century. We can wait
another year."</p>
<p>The finance minister jumps up. He's forgotten about his
parking meter. Mr. Swieszkowski opens a strongbox, extends a
credit from the state treasury, and Mr. Kozniewski rushes
out.</p>
<p>Back in Warsaw, politicians are slinging mud in
anticipation of the fully free election they all want. Mr.
Walesa's backers for the presidency insist that Gen.
Jaruzelski quit right now. They want a presidential election
this fall, and they're fuming at the U.S. for inviting the
general to Washington in October. The government isn't so
eager for a change so soon, and the issue has split
Solidarity.</p>
<p>The exiles, meanwhile, carry ahead with the same "air of
unreality," as historian Norman Davies has written, that
"would hang over the government of Churchill and Atlee if it
had been forced to leave London for Ottawa in 1940, as
envisaged, and if its successors had been prevented from
returning ever since by a gang of Stalinist usurpers."</p>
<p>For the Poles who flew with the Royal Air Force in the
Battle of Britain and fought beside Montgomery's Army at
Monte Cassino, the war ended in betrayal. They and the Free
French had been the only occupied allies to struggle on. Yet
at Yalta in 1945, Roosevelt and Churchill handed Poland to
the Soviets. Stalin promised to hold democratic elections,
but he didn't.</p>
<p>Poland's government in London lost its status, and its
claim to a seat at the UN. Like 144,000 Polish soldiers and
their families, it chose to stay in Britain, and to preserve
the republic in exile. Its leaders called the deal at Yalta a
"monstrous injustice which could not possibly last."</p>
<p>But it did, and the government that started as a stopgap
became a full-time state of fantasy.</p>
<p>To fill in for parliament, dissolved in 1939, emigres
around the world elected a National Council. They still do,
every five years; 100,000 voted in 1989, two months before
Solidarity won at home. And to make up for the gold reserves
snatched by Warsaw, the finance ministry raises $250,000 a
year through "voluntary taxation."</p>
<p>The National Council's 110 members meet here every two
months, or in Toronto or Chicago, to chew over the prime
minister's budget: $35,000 to publish the official gazette;
$1,480 for the president's postage; $3,700 for the foreign
minister's typist; $1,390 for coffee and wine. They never
fail to approve the prime minister's permanent program: to
remind the world that his government exists.</p>
<p>Crisis has flared once. In 1972, some prewar political
parties judged that President August Zaleski, in office 25
years, had served long enough. He left, and a "Unified
Political Center" resolved that the president, who appoints
the prime minister, should pass the torch every seven years
to a new head of state accepted by an exile consensus.</p>
<p>Four men have since accepted "responsibility before God
and history for the destinies of the state," as the
constitution enjoins. Ryszard Kaczorowski would like to be
the last.</p>
<p>Silver-haired and pinstriped, he sits at a fine-grained
desk in an office as presidential as they come: crystal
chandeliers, Persian carpets, gilt ceiling, and a portrait
gallery of presidents past.</p>
<p>On July 19 last year, he took the oath of office. It was
the day his predecessor, Kazimierz Sabbat, died in London --
and the day another oath was taken, in Warsaw, by Wojciech
Jaruzelski.</p>
<p>"Perhaps," says President Kaczorowski, "it was God's
hand."</p>
<p>He had been Home Minister of the Government in Exile,
keeping up contacts with the Polish underground, just as the
London Government stood behind the underground he joined in
1939 as a 20-year-old in Bialystok. The Soviets arrested him,
condemned him to death, changed their minds and sent him to
Siberia. He went on to fight in Italy, and to take up the
emigres' vigil here.</p>
<p>"A lot of people thought our existence was ridiculous," he
says. "But sometimes they forget about the moral value of
symbols. I hope to return to Poland, and not as a private
citizen. A freely elected parliament might invite me to
transfer our sovereignty. It might only be for hours, but for
that time I would be president of Poland -- in Warsaw."</p>
