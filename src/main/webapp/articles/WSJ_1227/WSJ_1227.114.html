	<p class="article-leader">Elizabeth Lesly's Nov. 30 editorial-page article "How Your
Realtor Rips You Off" was a tissue of half-truths and
innuendo, and has done serious damage to the reputation of
the National Association of Realtors, its 800,000 members,
and to a profession with an established record of service to
the public.
   The first allegation was that the Boise, Idaho, Board of
Realtors "hurled" a local broker {Ralph Colburn} into
bankruptcy and "drove him out of business" because he
attempted to represent home buyers.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Had Ms. Lesly consulted the board or examined the record,
she would have learned that the board's only action was to
send a "private" letter to the broker asking that he not
disparage the integrity of his fellow Realtors in his
advertising. The reporter's charge that the broker was the
victim of association opposition to buyer brokerage is false.
Far from opposing buyer brokerage, the NAR recognizes it as a
primary marketing relationship for the consumer. In fact,
1986 and 1990 NAR surveys indicate that at least one-third of
member firms offer buyer-brokerage services. NAR policy
guarantees buyer-broker access to Multiple Listing Services.</p>
<p>As regards responsibility for the broker's bankruptcy, it
should be noted that when he closed his business a review of
court records showed his liabilities of about $14,000
exceeded his assets of about $11,000.</p>
<p>Ms. Lesly's second allegation was that the members of the
National Association control the "marketplace," have a
monopolistic position, and therefore can charge undeservedly
high commission rates. The primary source of her allegation
was identified as Paul Roark, a staff attorney of the Federal
Trade Commission.</p>
<p>The absurdity of the charge of monopoly is made manifest
by two facts: First, out of the 2,210,085 real estate
licensees in the U.S., only 800,000 are Realtors. Second,
membership in the National Association, and hence, access to
MLS, is available to any licensee willing to subscribe to the
Realtors' Code of Ethics. We are at a loss to understand how
NAR can be accused of being a "monopoly" when everyone
licensed to engage in the real estate business is eligible
and invited to join.</p>
<p>The irresponsible use of your power and influence has hurt
a lot of hard-working men and women in the real estate
business, and potentially injured those home buyers and
sellers who forgo services of inestimable value to them.</p>

<p>Multiple Listing Services do not have to be a part of the
National Association of Realtors. Most sellers do, in fact,
know that the commission fees are negotiable. They ask what
the fee is. They do negotiate on the fee. Broker fees
generally range from 3% to 10% and the full range is used
depending on the value of the property and the difficulty in
executing a sale. It is fatuous and irresponsible to attempt
to mislead the public into thinking the average fee should be
closer to 2% of the sale price. The public isn't that stupid.
The marketplace is free enough to cause that to happen if it
were a reality.</p>
<p>The buyer's broker mode is common. It is not unique as
portrayed. I have used that contractual relationship many
times. I am a Realtor and I am in a MLS.</p>

<p>Ms. Lesly strongly infers that buyer-brokering is not
allowed by the National Association of Realtors or local real
estate boards. I am a past president of the Flint Board of
Realtors and my associate, who manages our brokerage
department, is the current president. We have been and
continue to be very active in buyer brokering, and we are
also members of our Multiple Listing Service.</p>
<p>Ms. Lesly obviously did not do her homework. She states,
"Under present law both real estate agents in any
house-buying transaction are bound to do everything in their
power to see that the seller gets the highest price." This is
untrue. A broker cannot represent, in most cases, both buyer
and seller. However, Broker A who lists a property would
obviously be acting as an agent of the seller. Broker B, who
acts as an agent of the buyer and is paid by the buyer, would
not be representing the seller. Ms. Lesly also incorrectly
makes the point that a property placed in the MLS system
requires that both brokers work only for the seller's best
interest. This is completely wrong.</p>

<p>Congratulations for being willing to print the truth about
damage to consumers due to Realtor monopoly control. Too few
in the media have been willing to risk the roar of the
Realtor lion.</p>
<p>It's unfortunate you adapted only part of Ms. Lesly's
article from the November issue of the Washington Monthly.
Taking it out of the context of a well-documented piece will
cause many of your readers to miss its import -- that the
real estate business in this country is controlled by a
multibillion-dollar monopoly that has made itself immune from
effective government oversight.</p>
<p>It's also unfortunate that thousands of real estate
salespeople who continually stream in and out of the business
every year will not recognize that they too are victims as
much as the consumers described by author Sloan Bashinsky in
1984 as "Home Buyers: Lambs to the Slaughter." Sad, but true,
that even those who remain in the business for any length of
time have a general ignorance about the NAR's political
machinations, matched only by their naive belief in the
NAR-generated image propaganda. Therefore, they participate
more or less innocently in the anticompetitive schemes that
drive up consumer costs and limit consumer choices.</p>
<p>However, many who have observed the industry from within
and without for more than two decades could confirm Ms.
Lesly's facts as consistent with their own experiences. Few
dare to speak out in fear of reprisal. By and large, the NAR
has become a power unto itself, controlling its own
membership and the marketplace through proprietary control of
the Multiple Listing Services. As the Washington Monthly
article shows, NAR's power to intimidate legislators and
regulators by winding up its members to do "grassroots"
lobbying can thwart efforts at reforms in other areas
affecting financial services, appraisal standards and
taxation.</p>
<p>The FTC has many cases in its files, but refuses to take
any action to protect the rights of brokers to compete or the
rights of consumers to choose alternative services that would
involve any head-on confrontation with the NAR. The FTC's
1983 Report on the Real Estate Industry revealed that state
regulatory agencies function more to protect the industry's
self-interest than to protect the public. Yet very few in
state government (New York is a notable exception) have dared
follow up on that report by taking a hard look at consumer
protection and restraint-of-trade issues.</p>

<p>Not all real estate agents are out to "rip off" the
public. We take great pride in our work, and we fiercely
represent our principals, be they buyers or sellers.
Sometimes, the commission we get at the end of a transaction
breaks down to less than $2 an hour. As real estate agents,
we work very hard to help our clients (buyers or sellers) get
the best terms and conditions in their purchases. Our work is
not helped by misleading articles that simply feed paranoia.</p>

<p>Ms. Lesly must have gotten ripped off by a real estate
broker. Every profession has a minority who (in her terms)
"rake in" big commissions and receive "hefty broker fees."</p>
<p>I am a real estate broker in a medium-size firm. I work
hard. I know the market. Every dollar I earn with knowledge
and scrupulous effort. I am one of the leading brokers in my
office, and this year will earn, not rake in, $33,000, from
18 separate transactions. Some were effortless, most were
arduous.</p>
<p>Yes, there are dilemmas in my work. Although I share in a
commission paid by the seller at the close of a sale, when I
am with a buyer, working with them day after day after day, I
try to perceive what they want and what they can afford, and
try to negotiate what is best for them and the seller. It
should be a "win-win" situation. I comply with the law and,
in writing, notify "my broker" that I will receive payment by
"sharing" the sales commission paid to the "listing broker."</p>
<p>The reason we do not have more brokers representing buyers
looking for homes (it is becoming standard practice in
commercial real estate brokerage) is because most buyers do
not want to sign an agreement to work with a broker, and pay
them when they buy. Although it might be in the buyer's best
interest, we have traditionally done otherwise.</p>

<p>I suspect you will be attacked viciously by the NAR for
printing Ms. Lesly's article. But one never needs to
apologize for the truth and the facts. That position has cost
me, because the ads for which the local Board of Realtors
crucified me read:</p>
<p>1) "The real estate buyer without his own agent has no
protection in the transaction; he must represent himself just
like a car buyer."</p>
<p>2) "The buyer's broker is an ally of the buyer rather than
an opponent like he is in most real estate transactions."</p>
<p>Is that bad advertising? I think not. In fact, the
complaining broker stated during the "hearing": "An attack of
this kind on the industry may have to be tolerated if it
comes from the outside, but not from one of our own members."</p>
<p>Talk about a thin skin. The warning they gave me to cease
and desist was nothing less than a threat, more like
professional terrorism.</p>
