   Lure High-Powered Help</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>GIVING UP greenbacks for green, executives of a new breed
are becoming guardians of the environment. They're trading
big chunks of pay for jobs they can "believe in" at nonprofit
enterprises.</p>
<p>Mark Le Doux joined Earthwatch, a Watertown, Mass.,
research group, after seven years with a
management-consulting firm. Bearing calculator and calendar
to informal meetings, he recalls, he was at first viewed by
some colleagues as a "capitalist pig" in the wrong pen.
Though he says he earns 70% less than before, he has found
novel rewards in trips to Australia -- tracking down both
bush folklore and the echidna, an egg-laying mammal.</p>
<p>Barbara Hoskinson, a former vice president at Bankers
Trust, now works for the World Wildlife Fund, Washington,
D.C. She handles so-called debt-for-nature swaps, in which
the foundation repays a portion of debt for a poor nation
that agrees to set aside land for conservation.</p>
<p>To gain business acumen, environmental groups increasingly
solicit corporate types. At the Sierra Club, based in San
Francisco, a spokeswoman says, "We recruit more and more from
the profit-making world." Nonprofit it may be, but the
organization's yearly budget is $52 million.</p>
<p>Especially with the sluggish economy, some business
students ponder a move straight into nonprofits. Fellowships
at Stanford, Harvard and Wharton subsidize salaries for
students who take such jobs. Some schools are forging
loan-forgiveness programs.</p>
<p>Still, some students worry about ending up with a dead-end
job. David Haddad, a student at Harvard Business School who
worked at a nonprofit last summer, says career tracks are
"little developed" at such outfits. But, says Frances
Hesselbein, director of the Peter F. Drucker Foundation for
Non-Profit Management in New York, that's less of a problem
for people whose priorities have shifted "from success to
significance."</p>
<p>Enemies of Efficiency:</p>
<p>Meetings and Memos</p>
<p>WHY NOT WORK just 8 1/2 months a year? After all,
executives waste the other 3 1/2 anyway -- the result of
telephone limbo, useless meetings and mindless memos, figures
Accountemps, a Menlo Park, Calif., temporary-services agency.</p>
<p>But some companies -- often smaller firms -- avoid such
time sinks, mostly by slashing bureaucracy and planning
ahead. "These {companies} aren't on the Fortune 500 list --
they are trying to make it," says Accountemps Chairman Max
Messmer. "You get very efficient when things are tight."</p>
<p>Staff members zip through 15-minute monthly meetings at
SuperMac Technology, a Silicon Valley start-up that makes
monitors and graphics. Chief Executive Michael McConnell
expects people to hash through problems before a session,
then suggest three solutions and recommend one. Otherwise, he
warns, "meetings become extremely expensive."</p>
<p>Some bigger companies also see the light. Formal memos
"with carbon copies to the immediate world" are shunned at
the retailer Mervyn's, says Joe Vesce, president of the
Dayton Hudson unit.</p>
<p>Most timesavers are simply common sense. Larry Baker,
founder of Time Management Center in St. Louis, says
voicemail recordings, for example, should say when a message
will be returned, and should give an emergency contact. He
hears too many recordings, he says, where "you don't know if
Joe Jones is down the hall for two hours or out of town for
two weeks."</p>
<p>More Corporate Boards</p>
<p>Acquire Foreign Accent</p>
<p>GOING GLOBAL may mean an import for your board of
directors.</p>
<p>Compared with a year ago, "there is a lot more interest in
having international types on boards," says Jack Lohnes, of
Spencer Stuart & Associates, a Stamford, Conn., search firm.
For example, Chemical maker Hercules, Wilmington, Del.,
recently snared Manfred Caspari, an economist retired from
German government and European Community posts. Mr. Caspari
joins a board of otherwise all-American directors. "We wanted
somebody with a different outlook at the table," says Robert
B. Hessler, director of financial relations for Hercules,
which looks to Europe for nearly one-quarter of its sales.</p>
<p>For many companies, the 1992 creation of a single European
market and changing trade stances with Canada and Mexico are
compelling incentives to make a similar choice. "There is a
surprising amount of lubrication that goes on to ease
barriers to business abroad," and personal contacts can help,
says Robert Smith, a New York search consultant.</p>
<p>A foreign director offers more than practical help, says
J. Gerald Simmons, a search executive. They're also a
"cosmetic" to impress overseas clients.</p>
<p>Signing on a foreign director often proves easier than
companies expect. Many foreign executives are fluent in
English. Mr. Caspari receives the standard Hercules
director's pay for attending 11 meetings annually, as well as
travel and lodging reimbursement.</p>
<p>Odds and Ends</p>
<p>WOMEN EXECUTIVES have an edge over men, 47% to 39%, in
leadership traits for handling profit-and-loss
responsibilities, says a Columbia University survey for
recruiter Russell Reynolds. . . . Business school professors'
pay has risen 8.2% to an average of $53,000 this academic
year. The average salary for deans has climbed 7.8% to
$88,000, says the American Assembly of Collegiate Schools of
Business.</p>
