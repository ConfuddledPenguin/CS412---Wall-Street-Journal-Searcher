	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- The U.S. International Trade Commission said
it will conduct a final anti-dumping investigation into
China's export of sodium thiosulfate. The Commerce Department
already has issued a preliminary finding that dumping of the
chemical is occurring.
   The question of how China practices trade has taken on
increasing importance lately, as China's trade surplus with
the U.S. threatens to leap beyond that of Germany and Taiwan
next year, ranking it only behind Japan. U.S. concerns are
that China is achieving much of its advantage through unfair
trade practices such as dumping, defined as the selling of
goods in a foreign country at less than fair value.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>A U.S. final investigation will consider whether an
industry in the U.S. is materially injured, or is threatened
with material injury, or whether the establishment of an
industry in the U.S. is materially retarded by foreign-made
goods being sold in the U.S. at less than fair value.</p>
<p>Similar investigations are being conducted concerning
possible dumping of the chemical by Germany and the United
Kingdom.</p>
