	<p class="article-leader">SAN FRANCISCO -- Pacific Telesis Group will reserve $60
million against fourth-quarter earnings to offset losses it
expects as it sheds its real estate holdings.
   The reserve equals 15 cents a share. For 1989's fourth
quarter, the telecommunications company reported net income
of $322 million, or 79 cents a share, on $2.48 billion of
revenue.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>In March, Pacific Telesis's PacTel Corp. subsidiary said
it no longer would invest capital in PacTel Properties, its
real estate unit. And recently, Pacific Telesis announced a
reorganization under which it said it would slash staff
overhead in its domestic cellular operations and position
itself to respond more readily to wireless communication and
home entertainment opportunities world-wide.</p>
<p>Pacific Telesis said it will shed PacTel Properties'
portfolio, consisting of properties in California and
Florida, over the next few years.</p>
<p>In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday,
Pacific Telesis shares rose 12.5 cents to $45.75.</p>
