	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- The dollar ended mixed in a calm,
holiday-thinned market that showed only a mild interest in
position-squaring.
   With Tokyo and New York the only major trading centers
active the day after Christmas, there was "just not enough
depth to be able to explain specific moves," said David
Jaques, senior corporate trader at Barclays Bank in New York.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>There was moderate interest yesterday in buying back marks
that were sold off heavily following the resignation of
Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze late last week.
The German currency is believed to be the most vulnerable
among major currencies to instability in the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the greenback still has firm support,
traders said, because of the market's apprehension about the
Mideast stalemate. The dollar, which is perceived as a safe
investment, traditionally attracts buyers in times of
uncertainty.</p>
<p>A statement issued yesterday by Iraqi President Saddam
Hussein that the deposed Kuwaiti rulers never again will rule
in Kuwait was interpreted as confirmation that he has no
intention of complying with the U.N. Security Council's Nov.
29 resolution ordering an Iraqi withdrawal from Kuwait by
Jan. 15, said Thomas Palladino, a trader at Oesterreichische
Laenderbank in New York.</p>
<p>In late New York trading, the dollar was quoted at 1.5368
marks, up from its Tokyo close Wednesday of 1.5330 marks. The
U.S. currency was changing hands at 136.25 yen, level with
its Tokyo close Wednesday. Sterling was trading at $1.8823,
up from $1.8750.</p>
<p>In Tokyo early Thursday, the dollar was trading at 136.85
yen.</p>
<p>Even a report in an Israeli newspaper indicating that U.S.
Secretary of State James A. Baker III would likely meet
Saddam Hussein in Baghdad on Jan. 9 failed to encourage
dollar sellers. The State Department later denied that any
date had been set for negotiations. Furthermore, traders
noted, even if the two men did meet on Jan. 9, it was hardly
feasible that a withdrawal by Jan. 15 could be negotiated.</p>
<p>News that British, Australian and U.S. Marines seized an
Iraqi freighter before it entered the Persian Gulf kept the
attention of what few participants there were focused on the
Mideast.</p>
<p>Concern over the Soviet situation seems to have abated
somewhat, allowing traders to buy back some mark positions.
After mulling over the consequences of Mr. Shevardnadze's
resignation, participants seem to be regarding the mark
sell-off as somewhat overdone, traders said.</p>
<p>Among the developments suggesting that panic over the
future of Mikhail Gorbachev's rule might have been
unwarranted, was news that Mr. Gorbachev won sweeping new
powers over a reorganized executive branch as Parliament
agreed to create a new vice presidency and cabinet under his
direct control.</p>
<p>The focus of the market's political jitters has now
shifted to Baghdad rather than Moscow, said Erik Lehtis,
assistant vice president at Credit Agricole in New York.</p>
<p>But traders emphasized that the thinness of the market
made rate movements unreliable benchmarks, and that the
predominant impulse was to ignore the market as much as
possible. Traders were reluctant to establish any new
positions in the illiquid market and are waiting for Jan. 2
to get a real sense of where the market wants rates to be.</p>
<p>On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for current
delivery settled at $385.60 an ounce, up $3.10. Estimated
volume was 1.9 million ounces.</p>
<p>In early trading in Hong Kong Thursday, gold was quoted at
$384.88 an ounce.</p>
