	<p class="article-leader">The nation's merchants, spooked by the ghost of the bleak
Christmas just past, are bracing for tough times in the first
half of 1991.
   For bargain hunters, that is likely to mean a bonanza.
"We'll be more aggressive" in promoting special deals, vows
William McCarthy, president of marketing at Montgomery Ward &
Co. in Chicago. Troubled Sears, Roebuck & Co. also is
planning to tout more deals.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>But some retail executives fear that, in the current
recessionary climate, even big price cuts won't coax
consumers to open their wallets. Just listen to Cari
Brookbanks, an advertising account supervisor in Chicago.
"I'm going to stay out of the stores," she declares, citing a
joint decision with her adman husband "to tighten our belts a
little bit."</p>
<p>Says Linnette Peterson, a receptionist from Staten Island,
N.Y.: "I sure don't plan to get anywhere near the stores for
the January sales."</p>
<p>Indeed, the retail slump shows no signs of abating after a
Christmas season that, by most accounts, finished on a blue
note. Despite widespread discounting, holiday sales slipped
below last year's at some stores while others barely exceeded
last year's receipts, industry executives say. After
adjusting for inflation, the final tallies for the crucial
holiday period are expected to be the worst in many years.</p>
<p>The outlook for the first half of 1991 is even grimmer.
Consultant Walter Loeb predicts that same-store sales in the
first half of the year will decline as much as 4%, further
squeezing industry profits.</p>
<p>"If the consumer wasn't shopping for Santa Claus and
Christmas, I can't imagine why they would shop in the first
half of the year," says Dayton Hudson Corp. Chairman Kenneth
Macke.</p>
<p>"This is a difficult economic climate, and it makes
running the business a lot tougher," says Julian Taub, a
senior vice president at Campeau Corp.'s Bloomingdale's,
where holiday revenue was "within a percentage point or two
of last year."</p>
<p>Predicts Jack McMillan, president of Nordstrom Inc.: "It's
going to be a tough first half."</p>
<p>The wild card is the Persian Gulf crisis. The current
standoff undoubtedly depressed shoppers and contributed to
the slump in holiday sales. But "if war breaks out in the
Middle East, it could be catastrophic," says Arthur Martinez,
vice chairman of Investcorp International Inc.'s Saks Fifth
Avenue, which matched last year's holiday sales on a
same-store basis. "On the other hand, if the dispute is
favorably resolved, it could provide a psychological boost."</p>
<p>In any case, most merchants are shrinking inventories,
cutting staff and expenses and planning to promote the sorts
of basic apparel and household products that typically sell
best in a recession.</p>
<p>At K mart Corp., which registered a slight increase in
holiday sales, a spokesman says the discount chain is
"placing greater emphasis" on low-priced commodities such as
toothpaste, paper products and household cleaners, and
focusing less on more expensive televisions and stereo
equipment. "We're trying to put our inventories where we
think it will do us the most good," he says.</p>
<p>The Christmas season provided ample evidence that
consumers, fearing a recession and a war, are trading down to
lower-priced goods and delaying discretionary purchases.</p>
<p>At Bill's London Transit, a small men's store in Atlanta,
manager Philip M. Griffiths says shoppers tended to choose
$45 sweaters instead of $1,200 leather suits. Jerry Sheff,
owner of The Jewelry Store in Boston, says "customers stayed
away from anything costing $100 or more as if it were a
pickpocket." At FrontRunners Inc., a Los Angeles active
apparel retailer, owner Paul D. Tordella says he sold out of
T-shirts for the first time this December and socks were a
popular gift, even in the affluent neighborhood of Brentwood.</p>
<p>Tiffany & Co., while reporting a modest but lower than
expected sales increase at U.S. stores, says "the average
customer purchase declined somewhat." And a hot seller at the
Card Factory in Los Angeles was a new $55 model of the
Filofax datebook. Last year's big gift was a $99 Mont Blanc
pen, now priced at $115 and hardly moving.</p>
<p>Designs Inc., a Boston-based chain carrying only basic
Levi Strauss & Co. sportswear, posted a 23% increase in
same-store sales for the holiday period. "It could be an
indication that, these days, people are looking for the more
basic, steadfast product," says Samuel Levenson, assistant to
the company treasurer. The chain also discounted
aggressively.</p>
<p>Some merchants blame the media for poisoning the Christmas
mood. "People have the money," insists Ami A. Peretz, who
owns the Vencci men's boutique in Los Angeles. "They're just
choosing not to spend it because the news caused people to be
concerned about the gift budget. By January or February, I
hope people will get a clearer picture of what's happening in
the world and start buying again."</p>
<p>But consumers were singing a different tune. "This is a
scary, unpredictable time," says Kelly S. Fiand, a college
student and Los Angeles waitress who slashed her Christmas
budget to $200 from last year's $1,000. "People are worried
about the economy and war. . . . Customers just aren't
tipping the way they used to."</p>
<p>Says Ms. Peterson, the Staten Island receptionist who
intends to stay out of the stores: "I'm kind of worried about
next year, since it's been downhill all the way on Wall
Street with so many folks getting laid off."</p>
<p>Indeed, most retail industry executives have lowered their
expectations and changed their definition of success. "For a
while, if you weren't getting double-digit increases just by
opening the door, you weren't satisfied," says Robert M.
Benham, president of Hallmark Cards Inc.'s Halls and Swansons
department stores in Kansas City. "Now, I think it's
remarkable that most of us are running even, instead of off
10%. The whole perspective has changed."</p>
