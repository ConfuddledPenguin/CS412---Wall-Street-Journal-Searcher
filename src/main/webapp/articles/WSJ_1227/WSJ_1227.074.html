	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- Women will be earning more doctorate degrees
than men by the year 2001, according to an Education
Department study.
   The study, which projects several educational trends into
the 21st century, says that the number of men who receive
Ph.D.s is declining, while the number of women who receive
them is increasing.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The number of male Ph.D. recipients dwindled to 22,627 in
1989, from 26,267 in 1976, while the ranks of their female
counterparts grew to 12,752, from 7,797 during that period.</p>
<p>The trend suggests that women, who currently earn roughly
65% of what men do, will soon have tools to close the income
gap. But it may also reflect the fact that more men are
passing up academic degrees in humanities or the sciences to
opt for more financially lucrative degrees in business,
medicine or law, according to Christopher Cross, assistant
secretary for education research and improvement. The number
of men receiving professional degrees today is nearly double
that of women, although the gap has narrowed considerably in
recent years.</p>
<p>Women already receive more master's degrees than men, a
trend that began in 1986 and is attributable partly to the
growing number of women attending graduate school part-time
while raising a family, Mr. Cross said. Women also outnumber
men in overall higher-education enrollment by about one
million, another disparity that the Education Department
projects will grow.</p>
