	<p class="article-leader">Spending on research and development is beginning to slow
after more than doubling in the past decade.
   U.S. industry will spend $75.9 billion for research and
product development next year, only 2.2% more than during
1990, according to the annual forecast by Battelle Memorial
Institute, a Columbus, Ohio, research organization.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>In real, inflation-adjusted terms, corporate R&D
expenditures will decline slightly, Battelle said, because
the cost of performing research will rise about 2.4% next
year.</p>
<p>Corporate R&D spending climbed 5.5% in 1990, and is up a
striking 140% from a decade ago, according to National
Science Foundation figures.</p>
<p>Total research-and-development spending, including
government and institutional funding, will rise 3.5% next
year to $155.2 billion, Battelle forecasts. That's about a 1%
rise in real spending, one quarter of the 4% average rate of
increase during the previous decade.</p>
<p>"The slowdown in the rate of growth in R&D expenditures
isn't surprising, given the situation with the federal budget
and the general slowdown in business activity," said Douglas
E. Olesen, president and chief executive officer of Battelle,
which performs research for governments and businesses in
more than 30 countries.</p>
<p>"It wouldn't surprise me if inflation-adjusted spending
declined for a few years after 1991," says Jules J. Duga, the
Battelle researcher who does the annual study. "Spending
won't take off again until 1995 or 1996."</p>
<p>Even big spenders such as Dow Chemical Co., Midland,
Mich., are rationing 1991 R&D dollars. Dow's U.S. research
spending will creep up less than 1% next year to $650
million, after a spectacular 25% jump in 1990. World-wide,
Dow will spend $1.18 billion, up 2.2%. Profits soared in 1988
and 1989, Dow says, fueling the big 1990 research outlays.
However, skimpier earnings in 1990 and the cloudy outlook for
next year lead the company to be more cautious about 1991 R&D
spending.</p>
<p>"It's a grim picture," says Delos Smith, senior business
analyst with the Conference Board, a New York-based economics
research organization. "Companies face an incredible profits
squeeze," he says. "One thing that goes is basic science
research. And that's something they need to do for the longer
term."</p>
<p>Furthermore, says Mr. Smith, government-sponsored research
is "heavily defense-oriented." As federal budget problems and
the end of the Cold War cause a cutback in defense spending,
research spending becomes a target by default. Defense
strategists must continue to spend on operations and
maintenance, and they want to keep buying new weapons, he
says. That will leave less money for research.</p>
<p>As for the threat of war in the Mideast, it's too early to
predict the effect on defense research spending.</p>
<p>Battelle's Mr. Duga doesn't expect the current slump in
real R&D outlays to be as long or as deep as the cutback that
occurred between 1970 and 1977. That cut followed completion
of the massive effort to put a man on the moon, and it also
reflected the serious 1974-75 recession.</p>
<p>Most companies say they're increasing spending on product
development despite the economic slowdown, because continuing
to improve products is essential to growing more competitive
in world markets. For the same reason, most concerns are
continuing to explore new production processes. Electronics,
communications, sensors, and advanced machinery all will
receive more funding next year, Battelle says.</p>
<p>However, some companies concede that they have cut back on
research work that's interesting but not essential to
immediate product improvement. Basic work on the properties
of materials, entirely new families of chemicals and other
research that may pay off sometime -- but not in the next
year or two -- gets less funding.</p>
<p>Cincinnati Milacron Inc., for instance, is focusing its
R&D spending on projects directly related to improving its
machine tools, plastics machinery and other products,
officials say. Milacron has curtailed more basic research
that it pursued in the past, as the company fights to regain
market share in an intensely competitive world-wide
capital-goods market.</p>
<p>Dow Chemical, however, believes companies that maintain
their long-range research programs through the next few years
will have a real leg-up later in the decade, says Robert
Nowak, chief scientist. He says Dow is trimming "a little bit
here and a little bit there," to avoid cutting basic
research.</p>
<p>New materials represent an especially exciting area, Mr.
Nowak says, including advanced ceramics -- plastics that can
be applied in exceedingly thin films to help create more
powerful electronic chips and plastics that look like metals,
but never rust.</p>
<p>The federal government, which is expected to account for
46.5% of total R&D outlays, will increase its support by
4.3%, to $72.2 billion, Battelle estimates. Defense projects
will consume 56.8% of federal R&D funds next year, down from
58.4% in 1990. Some of the defense spending, however, goes to
develop new manufacturing technologies, such as
computer-directed factories, and for basic research in
physics, chemistry and biology.</p>
<p>Space-related research is the most rapidly growing sector,
claiming 12.1% of federal research expenditures next year, up
from 10% last year. Health and Human Services will get 13.1%
of the government funding, a slight decline despite increases
for programs related to AIDS, Battelle said. The Department
of Energy will get 8.8%, a drop from 9.4% in 1990 because of
lower spending for basic energy supply and conservation
studies.</p>
<p>While industry will provide slightly less than half the
R&D funding, businesses will perform 71.5% of all
research-and-development work, Battelle said, including a
majority of the federally funded programs. The government
will perform 11.3% of the work, colleges and universities
14.4% and other nonprofit organizations 2.8%.</p>
