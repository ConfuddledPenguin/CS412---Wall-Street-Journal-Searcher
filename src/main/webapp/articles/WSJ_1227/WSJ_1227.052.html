	<p class="article-leader">This year's budget agreement was supposed to pretty much
dictate domestic policy for the next five years. Now, only
two months later, there is open warfare over who gets to keep
score on the agreement: the White House's Office of
Management and Budget, as the agreement stipulates, or
Congress. The battle is more than academic; whichever side
wins will hold the commanding heights of public policy for
the near future.
   Last Friday, President Bush sent a letter to House Speaker
Thomas Foley saying that he won't tolerate a recent rule
passed by the House Democratic Caucus, which gives Congress
the right to keep score on when the agreement's automatic
spending cuts kick in. Noting that the rule would undercut
the terms of the budget agreement, President Bush vowed to
veto any bill that substitutes congressional estimates for
the OMB numbers specified in the agreement. If he carries
through on his threat, the ensuing trench warfare could see
President Bush vetoing every other bill that arrives on his
desk.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The rule adopted by the House Democratic Caucus doesn't
directly challenge OMB's legal power to monitor the budget
agreement. Rather, it says that any bill that doesn't use
numbers from the Congressional Budget Office or Joint Tax
Committee can be ruled out of order on the floor of the
House. Unless a majority of Members would then be willing to
vote against the House Democratic leadership, OMB's role in
enforcing the budget agreement would be effectively
eviscerated.</p>
<p>This latest House Rule clearly violates the spirit of the
budget agreement, and would essentially kill any chance of
passing a capital-gains tax cut. OMB estimates that the Bush
capital-gains proposal would take in $12.5 billion in extra
revenue over six years, a prediction reinforced by the
empirical evidence from all previous cuts in capital-gains
taxes. The Joint Tax Committee, using static revenue models
which assume that lower taxes have no effect on investor
behavior, predict an $11.4 billion loss. If Joint Tax's
estimates are accepted, a capital-gains cut would require
that taxes be raised elsewhere, say, with a surtax on the
"rich" (those earning more than $70,000 a year, in Congress's
eyes).</p>
<p>Democrats charge that OMB is a creature of the executive
branch, and that sometimes in the past its estimates have
been politically motivated. Perhaps so, but no more so than
its congressional counterparts that routinely use half-baked
econometric models to downplay the high cost of new programs.
The important point is not which side is less "biased." The
budget negotiators were trying to make a more relevant
distinction: They clearly decided to leave the power to
enforce the agreement with OMB, an entity whose bias is for
controlling rather than expanding spending.</p>
<p>President Bush needs to hold his ground on the budget
agreement. Should he step back from this domestic "line in
the sand" and not use his veto to enforce the budget deal,
he'll have gone a long way toward turning over domestic
policy to Congress. Respect for the executive branch's veto
power might then evaporate so quickly that Congress wouldn't
even need President Bush as a partner in another budget deal.</p>
<p>Congress could simply pass its own budget, perhaps by a
margin that would convince a weakened executive that his veto
couldn't be sustained. An era of congressionally dominated
government, so strongly resisted throughout the 1980s, would
then be upon the country with no end in sight.</p>
