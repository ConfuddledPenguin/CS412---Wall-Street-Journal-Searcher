	<p class="article-leader">SACRAMENTO, Calif. -- California's huge and growing budget
deficit, the biggest ever for a state, is starting to
mobilize a Democratic-controlled legislature and a new
Republican governor -- and the result could well mean the
slaughter of some sacred cows.
   With spending churning out of control to an annual rate of
11% and revenue growth slowing to 5% a year in a softening
economy, legislative analyst Elizabeth Hill calculates that
California faces a budget gap of about $6 billion over the
next 18 months.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The looming deficit caught many lawmakers here in the
state capital by surprise, as they adopted a budget in July
that had enough left over for a $1 billion reserve. Now, when
the legislators return next month, both they and Gov.-elect
Pete Wilson will be forced into hard choices that could
antagonize segments of the voting public.</p>
<p>The choices boil down to raising taxes in a state where
the national tax revolt was born, hacking away at a budget
jealously guarded by special interests or doing some of both.
Lawmakers already are taking to party lines, with Democrats
favoring tax increases and Republicans supporting deeper
spending cuts. Democratic legislators have been at war with
Republican Gov. George Deukmejian for much of his eight-year
term.</p>
<p>This deficit is so large, though, that the partisanship
seems to many to be softer than it has been in years. A
compromise combination of spending cuts and tax increases is
becoming widely expected, as well as a bipartisan attempt to
restructure fundamental problem areas in the budget.</p>
<p>"If the state is going to survive this situation, there
will have to be real substantive reform, which means both the
Democrats and Republicans are going to have to take off their
partisan hats and put on their bipartisan hats," said Steven
A. Merksamer, a Sacramento lawyer and veteran political
observer.</p>
<p>For their part, Democratic legislative leaders say they
are willing to work with Mr. Wilson, who has indicated he is
keeping mum about his budget plans until after he is
inaugurated Jan. 7.</p>
<p>"The election of a new governor provides us the
opportunity for a fresh and constructive beginning, an
opportunity California cannot afford to ignore," John
Vasconcellos, Democratic chairman of the state Assembly's
Ways and Means Committee, said recently. "We're out of time.
Something has to give."</p>
<p>Lawmakers are limited in how much they can cut. As much as
half of the budget is protected by state statute, and many
other programs have to grow just to keep up with California's
population, which stands at 29.5 million and is growing at
about 800,000 a year.</p>
<p>The population pressure, for instance, is helping to push
up the number of prison inmates at an annual average of
13.6%, prompting the Department of Corrections budget to rise
an average of 16%. Debt service on state general obligation
bonds to fund new prisons and other projects is growing at
16.4% a year. And education funding for kindergarten through
high school -- accounting for 36% of the budget -- is
increasing by 8.2% a year as school enrollment grows almost
twice as rapidly as the state's population.</p>
<p>Alarmed at the amount of expenditures that are "on
automatic pilot," as some have put it, the Legislature is
considering setting up a commission to work on constitutional
revisions aimed at making the budget more flexible.</p>
<p>By far the biggest chunk of the "automatic pilot" budget
is that for public schools and community colleges, which
represents 42% of the total. Under Proposition 98, passed by
voters in 1988, lawmakers can't tinker with that budget
unless two-thirds of them vote to suspend the proposition. In
their budget battles the past two years, Gov. Deukmejian
sought to suspend Proposition 98 but Democrats held it
sacrosanct and pushed for tax increases instead.</p>
<p>That battle could begin anew in January, with the
Democratic-controlled Senate Revenue and Taxation Committee
already compiling a long list of tax alternatives. The
possibilities include a 0.5% increase in the sales tax, which
is projected to bring in $1.5 billion, and increasing the top
personal income tax rate to 10.3% from 9.3%, adding $1.6
billion to state revenue.</p>
<p>Watching anxiously from the sidelines will be the
California taxpayers. Though the state's voters have
historically been anti-tax -- they turned down most of the
tax-raising initiatives that were on last month's election
ballot -- the current budget crisis is so severe, many say,
that they may have to resign themselves to making a few
sacrifices.</p>
