	<p class="article-leader">Merger talks between Pan Am Corp. and Trans World Airlines
grew rockier after Pan Am told TWA owner Carl Icahn, in
effect, to put up or shut up.
   In a letter to Mr. Icahn released late yesterday, Pan Am
Chief Financial Officer Richard Francis said Pan Am has
concluded that TWA "is not prepared to pursue" its Dec. 16
offer to acquire Pan Am after Mr. Icahn balked at putting his
offer in writing.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>In an interview, Mr. Icahn retorted that he didn't want to
put any new offer in writing because he said Pan Am had used
an earlier written offer he made last fall to strengthen Pan
Am's hand in talks to sell its London routes to United
Airlines parent UAL Corp. "In November we gave them a written
proposal, and never got the courtesy of a call back," Mr.
Icahn said.</p>
<p>Another sore point appeared to be Monday's disclosure that
Pan Am has received an offer from Pacificorp, a Portland,
Ore., utility, for new financing of the Pan Am Boston-New
York-Washington shuttle, with an agreement to allow Northwest
Airlines parent NWA Inc. to operate the shuttle.</p>
<p>Pan Am's letter said that if Mr. Icahn wanted to make a
written offer, which could also include a separate bid for
the shuttle, "We would be pleased to consider it and meet
with you if it provides an acceptable basis for further
discussion."</p>
<p>In a written reply to Pan Am, Mr. Icahn said, "Once again
you have misstated and misunderstood TWA's position. Our
offer to shareholders remains in place, subject to usual and
customary conditions for a transaction of this type." But he
said he remains "ready to meet" with Pan Am.</p>
<p>One of those conditions, Mr. Icahn added, would be any
adverse change in Pan Am's fortunes, including a possible Pan
Am bankrupcty-law filing for protection from creditors, "a
sale of assets for less than fair value, or defaults in major
borrowings or obligations."</p>
<p>Pan Am appears to be in constant danger of any number of
such changes, particularly in possible defaults of major
borrowings. It is in talks with one major aircraft leasing
company after failing to make a required payment on 21
wide-body jets.</p>
<p>One key point of dispute was TWA's insistence that any
interim debt financing to be provided to Pan Am by TWA be in
the form of debtor-in-possession financing.</p>
<p>Although such financing gives the lender a priority
position among other creditors, it can only be used in a
bankruptcy-law filing seeking protection from creditors.</p>
<p>The problem with that, according to one person familiar
with the Icahn-Pan Am talks, is that such a filing could
jeopardize any proceeds shareholders receive in the
acquisition. "As proposed, it doesn't give any value for the
shareholders," that person said.</p>
<p>Mr. Icahn has offered $1.50 a share plus $1 a share in
notes or preferred stock for each of Pan Am's 150 shares
outstanding. Although the cash offer is valued at $225
million, the notes could be worth as little as $30 million
based on the market value of other TWA debt.</p>
<p>In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange
yesterday, Pan Am shares closed at $1.375, up 12.5 cents.</p>
