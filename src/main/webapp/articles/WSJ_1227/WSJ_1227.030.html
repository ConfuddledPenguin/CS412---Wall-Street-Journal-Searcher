	<p class="article-leader">One year after the collapse of the old Iron Curtain in the
East, there is a growing risk that a new one will be erected
in the West.
   The first great test of post-Cold War, East-West relations
is about to occur. The U.S. has just passed a new and more
liberal immigration bill. Germany, Austria and a number of
other European nations continue to absorb large numbers of
new immigrants. But the West -- and especially Germany -- is
not prepared to cope with what is to come. Tough economic
conditions in Eastern Europe, and serious disorder in the
Soviet Union, could trigger a great new wave of human
migration.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Unlike the refugees of past years, most of whom left for
political reasons, today's emigrants are leaving primarily
for economic reasons. Millions of them may flood out of
countries suffering from insufficient food, housing and jobs
into those where conditions are better.</p>
<p>These refugees represent the loss of an enormous potential
resource for the countries they are leaving. The West should
develop a strategy to work with the Soviet Union and the
nations of Eastern Europe to find ways to induce many of
these people to stay and contribute their energy to economic
reconstruction. But it also needs a strategy to absorb those
who choose to leave; they can inject a new vigor into our own
societies, as so many before them have done.</p>
<p>In 1990, the number of refugees heading west is likely to
double the million who arrived last year. Most refugees are
continuing to go to Germany, whose constitution grants
automatic citizenship to people of German ancestry. A number
of Soviet Jews are also beginning to settle there. Refugees
will also settle in other parts of Western Europe and the
U.S. A few, especially from Romania, are heading to more
prosperous Eastern European nations such as Czechoslovakia
and Hungary.</p>
<p>What has occurred so far could be dwarfed by new waves of
emigration. Romania has issued 2.7 million passports to its
citizens, many of whom are desperate to leave. The Soviet
Union plans to enact legislation permitting its citizens to
travel abroad. A bad winter and economic or political chaos
there could bring about a tidal wave of hundreds of thousands
or even millions of souls flooding into Germany, Poland,
Finland, Austria, and beyond.</p>
<p>This would have profound political and economic
implications. Eastern European nations are already
experiencing high unemployment and anemic growth.
Collectively their import bills will increase by $6 billion
in 1991, when trade with the Soviet Union and within the
former Communist Bloc will be denominated in dollars. And
Eastern Europe will lose another $6 billion if oil stays at
about $30 a barrel.</p>
<p>The economic situation in Western Europe is considerably
better. But there is growing resistance to paying the
economic and social cost of resettling new immigrants;
workers there are concerned about job displacement,
particularly during an economic slowdown.</p>
<p>The influx of refugees has been raised as an issue in
Austria, which has resettled 600,000 of them in the past four
decades. In recent elections the opposition right-wing
Freedom Party used the slogan "Vienna must not become
Chicago" -- by which the party meant Vienna should not have
the kind of ethnic mix typical of the American city. The
party raised its share of the vote to 17% from 10%.</p>
<p>Germany has resettled nearly one million refugees since
last fall. Concerns about immigration have become a
significant domestic political issue. The government is
considering new tests to limit immigration from countries
judged to be without political persecution, e.g. Poland. In
France, resistance is growing to immigration of young North
African workers.</p>
<p>Although immigration is not as politically sensitive an
issue in the U.S. as in Europe, America's new law, even with
its emphasis on admitting skilled workers, also maintains
tight limits on the number of immigrants.</p>
<p>Free emigration was a major objective of the U.S. during
the Cold War. That goal was embodied in the 1974
Jackson-Vanik legislation, which made continuation of
U.S.-Soviet detente contingent on Moscow's permitting
increased emigration. It was also a goal of much of Western
Europe. It would be a tragic irony of history if having
realized the collapse of the Iron Curtain, and liberalized
emigration policies in the East, the West now severely
constrains the access of Soviets and other Eastern Europeans
to our nations.</p>
<p>However much aid the West provides, that aid is unlikely
to avert a major exodus from the East. Western Europe, the
U.S., Canada, Australia and other large Western nations will
need to work out a coordinated approach to accept and
productively employ as many of those refugees as possible,
and particularly those who for hardship, or political
reasons, desperately need access to the West.</p>
<p>We should do this in part for our own economic reasons.
Immigration is one key reason for America's success and for
progress in many other areas, Europe included. Neither the
U.S. nor other nations should fear more of it. Instead the
West needs to find ways of helping refugees adjust quickly so
they can contribute their talents to promote economic growth.
There are political reasons as well. There is fear of a
return to tougher political conditions in the U.S.S.R., for
example a rise of antiSemitism. Ethnic violence is rising in
several nations of the region. Many citizens of the Soviet
Union and members of ethnic minority groups in East Europe
want to leave while they can; they should be able to do so.</p>
<p>Massive new migrations could result in a period of
prolonged instability. They could also trigger social
dissent, and nationalism, in the West. The West must be
prepared to avert both with a major coordinated assistance
and absorption effort. Refugees are an enormous potential
economic resource. Putting up a new Iron Curtain deprives the
West of that resource and reduces our moral authority as
well.</p>
