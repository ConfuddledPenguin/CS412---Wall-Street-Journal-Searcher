	<p class="article-leader">RADIO: Minnesota Public Radio has agreed to purchase Twin
Cities station WLOL 99.5 FM from Emmis Broadcasting Co. for
$12 million. MPR, a nonprofit, noncommercial public
broadcasting organization, said it will move its KSJN 91.1
classical music format to 99.5 -- which offers a clearer,
higher quality signal. MPR's news and information format,
currently broadcast on KNOW 1330 AM, will then move to 91.1,
where it will broadcast under increased wattage. Emmis is a
closely held Indianapolis broadcasting concern.</p>
