	<p class="article-leader">The successful launch of Samsung Co.'s depositary receipts
is expected to usher in a period of low-priced overseas
issues by other South Korean companies.
   The receipts, which were priced two weeks ago at a 15%
premium to Samsung's shares, are trading at about a 19%
premium. Analysts attribute the success of the launch only
partly to the reputation of the company, which is the trading
arm of the diversified Samsung group. They say demand was
spurred largely by the receipts' low premium compared with
Korean issues in recent years.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"It marks a break with the pricing patterns of previous
Korean overseas issues," says Melissa Brown, senior analyst
with Barclays de Zoete Wedd Securities Ltd. in Seoul. "It
will have a serious impact on deals coming to market early
next year."</p>
<p>The $40 million issue of depositary receipts was launched
in two portions of approximately equal size in the U.S. and
Europe. The receipts, which are listed on the Luxembourg
Stock Exchange, will give investors access to Samsung shares
after the Korean stock market's scheduled opening to foreign
investors in 1992.</p>
<p>Investor interest in the issue was reflected in the active
trading of the receipts by market makers in London the first
week after the launch. Trading has since slackened.</p>
<p>Peter Rigg, managing director of CS First Boston Inc.,
which shares lead management duties for the issue with
Korea's Dongyang Securities Co., says he was pleased by the
receipts' initial liquidity. "The issue was extremely well
received, as we expected," he says.</p>
<p>Ms. Brown of Barclays de Zoete says investors were cheered
when the premium came in at the lower end of the expected
range of 15% to 20%. "When the deal was finally launched,
there ended up being a little bit more demand than expected
because of the price," she says. "So there was a little more
trading after the launch."</p>
<p>Some investors were unenthusiastic about the receipts even
at the modest price. William Ramsay, investment director of
Thornton Management (Asia) Ltd., says his company decided
against the receipts. "There are interesting companies to
invest in in Korea. Samsung Co. is not one of the them," he
says, making a distinction between Samsung Co., the trading
company, and other concerns in the Samsung group. "I believe
profit growth will be made elsewhere in the group."</p>
<p>Analysts say the price of Samsung's receipts reflects a
recognition of the softened market for Korean overseas
issues. Because the Korean stock market is closed to foreign
investors, vehicles that provide access to shares -- such as
convertible bonds and mutual funds -- have traded at sky-high
premiums. For example, the Korea Fund, a mutual fund listed
on the New York Stock Exchange and investing solely in Korean
shares, was trading at a premium of more than 100% last year.
Now it is at about 15%.</p>
<p>Investors' rejection of high premiums has ruined some
recent issues. For instance, Sunkyong Industries Co., the
last company to tap the overseas market, launched convertible
bonds in September at a 40% premium. Demand was so weak that
the underwriters were forced to swallow most of the issue.</p>
<p>The lessons weren't lost on Samsung. "The (Samsung) issue
was priced at a level where there's demand in the market,"
says an analyst close to the transaction. "There is the
realization in Korea that that is what it takes -- that the
market has changed."</p>
<p>Several issues that were delayed this year because of the
gloomy market are expected to try again in 1991, but their
prices are likely to reflect current conditions. "If they
think they can come back to the market and ask silly
premiums, they'll be disappointed again," says Mr. Ramsay of
Thornton Management.</p>
<p>One overseas launch planned for next year is the $100
million Korea Asia Fund, the third mutual fund for
foreigners, which was postponed after a failed takeoff in
September. Other companies planning to try again to launch
overseas issues next year include Kolon Co., Tongyang Nylon
Co., and Jindo Co.</p>
