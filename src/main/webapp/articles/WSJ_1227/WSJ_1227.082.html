	<p class="article-leader">WHAT STARTED AS A WAY to make a corporate move to a new
culture palatable has become a long-running testimony to the
fact that while corporations aren't real people, their
employees are.
   The people at Shell Oil Co. demonstrate this with an
all-volunteer good-works program called SERVE (Shell
Employees and Retirees Volunteerism Effort). Since the
company moved its corporate headquarters to Houston over 15
years ago, Shell employees -- managers, secretaries,
geophysicists, technicians -- have contributed one million
hours, most of it their own time, to helping the Texas city
and its people.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Shell's move from New York in the early 1970s sparked the
SERVE idea, according to Robert Dunphy, who was the company's
community affairs director then. Unlike New York City, where
employees trekked several hours from distant communities,
Houston would be considered home for Shell workers living
only 20 or 30 minutes from their jobs. Community involvement
would help the newcomers get oriented, the company reasoned.
When a survey showed that Shell's people were eager to
volunteer, SERVE was born.</p>
<p>Statistics prove the program's success. In its first full
year, 1976, SERVE drew 107 volunteers. Last year, the number
topped 1,560. The first "recognition luncheon," a stunt to
let volunteers take a bow, drew 153; this year, Houston's
convention center was packed by a crowd of almost 1,400.</p>
<p>Shell's experience emphasizes a truism of philanthropy.
Volunteers for good works are out there waiting; what's
needed is a way to let them know what they can contribute and
how. "What we do," says Jane Brophy, who now runs the
program, "is to match individual volunteers with the
community's needs." To make these matches, she can tap into a
data bank maintained by Houston's Volunteer Center (supported
by Shell and other companies), which connects her to almost
300 local organizations. Getting the word to employees is
equally important and speed is the watchword because the urge
to volunteer can be fleeting. Shell began with a newsletter
but soon found that it got better and quicker results with a
new format, "SERVE Classified," a monthly list of good-deed
opportunities in want-ad style delivered throughout the
company's eight Houston locations.</p>
<p>Ms. Brophy, who has been with SERVE for 11 years, says
that offering these lists lets the employees judge whether
they think they can be of help and can spare the time needed.
Shell also supplies on-the-job training for such things as
telephone "reassurance programs" where volunteers make daily
telephone calls to an elderly or handicapped shut-in.
Training in the office  makes it much easier for the
volunteer to get into the act.</p>
<p>The jobs are as varied as the needs. A company litigator
who once worked for a New Orleans TV station tapes broadcast
readings for the blind. A safety techologist serves as a
mediator in person-to-person conflicts such as landlord and
tenant disputes. A husband and wife team conducts guided
tours at Houston's Woman's Hospital for expectant
grandparents.</p>
<p>Jane Brophy's one-woman department adds to the mix with
special Shell projects, including a program to fix up homes
for the elderly and poor. More ambitious was the building of
a new park, complete with watering system, for Houston City
Hall; that employed 364 Shell volunteers. Retired company
workers also stay active in SERVE.</p>
<p>Shell tries to make sure volunteering and company rewards
don't mix, keeping volunteer data out of personnel records.
Ann Porawski, an accounting and administrative manager who
has been in SERVE almost from the beginning, sums it up:
"When you make a difference, it's no sacrifice."</p>
