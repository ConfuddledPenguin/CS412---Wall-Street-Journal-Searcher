	<p class="article-leader">MOSCOW -- The Soviet Union's top legislative body sat
stunned for several moments when President Mikhail Gorbachev
announced his choice for the country's first vice president:
Gennady Yanayev, a dedicated Communist and Russian by
nationality and a relative unknown.
   Legislators had earlier been shocked by the announcement
Tuesday night that Prime Minister Nikolai Ryzhkov had
suffered a heart attack. Moscow Radio said late Wednesday
that Mr. Ryzhkov's condition was worsening.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>In his surprise selection of Mr. Yanayev, the 53-year-old
secretary of the Soviet Communist Party Central Committee and
head of the Communists' faction in the Congress of People's
Deputies, Mr. Gorbachev dashed expectations that his choice
would be calculated to smooth over at least some of the
nation's complex problems, such as national separatism,
economic reform, and political restructuring.</p>
<p>Instead, Mr. Yanayev provides a conservative voice on all
three counts. As a Russian, he fails to answer hopes that Mr.
Gorbachev would select a leader of an independence-minded
republic to help build a nation of equal and sovereign member
republics. As a clear opponent of radical economic reform,
Mr. Yanayev is unlikely to add new energy to the hesitant
drive toward a market economy. And as a longtime Communist
bureaucrat, he does little to help promote the nation's
fledgling multiparty system or the separation of government
and party that Mr. Gorbachev has said he supports.</p>
<p>"I am a convinced Communist to the depths of my soul," Mr.
Yanayev told the Congress. "My main fight will be against
political Bacchanalia and vandalism, but by using democratic
means, not by repression."</p>
<p>The Congress must confirm Mr. Yanayev's appointment and
the result of the vote may not be declared until this
morning. Many delegates said they have no doubt he would be
approved, as have all significant proposals by President
Gorbachev at the Congress so far.</p>
<p>Mr. Gorbachev defended his choice with irritation against
a series of charged questions from the floor. "He is a man of
strong principles, an active supporter of perestroika," Mr.
Gorbachev said. Names that had been circulated as possible
candidates for vice president included such reformers as
Kazakhstan President Nursultan Nazarbayev, Leningrad Mayor
Anatoli Sobchak and Eduard Shevardnadze, the exiting foreign
minister whom Mr. Gorbachev had earlier said he intended to
appoint.</p>
<p>Asked how he explained the apparent gap between the
experience and philosophies of Mr. Shevardnadze and Mr.
Yanayev, Mr. Gorbachev argued that the two had a lot in
common. Both are hard workers, he said, with long
international experience. Mr. Yanayev has served on the
party's international committee, for years pursuing contacts
primarily with Socialist-bloc countries.</p>
<p>But critics said Mr. Gorbachev's choice simply showed his
own real conservatism. "As long as {Mr. Yanayev} believes the
Soviet Union should be saved as the Russian empire and that
socialism can work, he's a conservative to me," said Algis
Chekuolis, a Lithuanian legislator who is attending the
Congress as an observer because his republic is officially
boycotting its deliberations.</p>
<p>Many deputies felt Mr. Gorbachev's main goal was to pick
someone who would be a solid ally, ready to accept and
support any ideas the president puts forth, and that Mr.
Yanayev filled that bill.</p>
<p>The selection of vice president was Mr. Gorbachev's first
personnel appointment in a new government structure and
system of executive power that the Congress approved
Wednesday morning. Attention is now focused on who will be
selected to fill other key posts such as foreign minister and
prime minister.</p>
<p>Mr. Shevardnadze stunned the Congress last week when he
resigned as foreign minister, warning that the new
presidential powers could lead ultimately to a legal
dictatorship.</p>
<p>As for the post of prime minister, few deputies expect Mr.
Ryzhkov, who has been under attack for months for his
conservative economic policies, to return to an active
political position following his heart attack. Even before he
was hospitalized it was widely expected that he would be
replaced as premier after five years in the post.</p>
<p>Although the role of vice president under the new
structure won't supercede that of prime minsiter, in his
comments Wednesday, Mr. Yanayev appeared to be an ideological
brother to Mr. Ryzhkov.</p>
<p>Mr. Yanayev, who worked his way up through the official
labor union and the Communist youth organization, said he was
committed to pursuing perestroika, of which an important
element will be social welfare protection for workers. "If we
take the shock approach to economic reform, more than a
million people will be unemployed," Mr. Yanayev told
deputies.</p>
<p>Under the new government structure, it isn't clear yet
what role the new vice president will play. He will, however,
sit as a member of the revised Federation Council, an
organization made up of leaders of republics and other
regions that is supposed to determine national and
international policy and oversee its implementation in the
republics.</p>
