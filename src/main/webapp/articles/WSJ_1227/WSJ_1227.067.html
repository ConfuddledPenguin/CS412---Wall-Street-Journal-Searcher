	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- ITT Corp. is showing Western Union Corp., or
what is left of it, that it knows a thing or two about
holiday spirit.
   Cheating bankruptcy and struggling under a mountain of
debt, Western Union and its management team, led by New York
financier Bennett S. LeBow, told 9,000 company retirees in
late November that they would have to make significantly
larger payments to their retiree medical fund to keep their
benefits intact.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"Payments typically went up two to three times and in some
cases more than that, depending on the medical options they
had," said a Western Union spokesman. "So if you were, say,
paying $55 a month, now you had to pay something like $125 or
more."</p>
<p>About 225 of these retired workers were longtime former
employees of ITT's World Communications international telex
business, which ITT sold to Western Union in 1987.</p>
<p>In mid-December, when one irate former ITT employee
complained that ITT had sold its former workers down the
river to a company that was killing his benefits, ITT stepped
in. It offered to make up 85% of the difference between what
the former ITT workers had been paying into their medical
plan and the amount that Mr. LeBow and his managers were now
demanding -- at least during 1991.</p>
<p>Why? "Our contributions will range from $10 a month for
some employees to about $500," said an ITT spokesman.
"Western Union said the {retirees} would have to pay so many
hundreds of dollars a month to keep the coverage. These were
long-service employees and we were concerned that they have
the right coverage. It was the right thing to do."</p>
<p>But a Western Union spokesman defended the company's
position. "This company has a six-to-one ratio of retirees to
active workers. We very reluctantly had to reduce our subsidy
to the plan because of the company's impaired financial
condition."</p>
<p>Since taking over Western Union in late 1987 in a deal
that was touted as a bid to save Western Union, Mr. LeBow and
his managers have sold off numerous Western Union operations,
fired half its work force and slashed pension and other
benefits to those that still work at the almost 140-year-old
communications company.</p>
<p>During the same period, however, the LeBow rescue team has
prospered with steadily increasing compensation. Mr. LeBow
alone has been drawing a $2.4 million annual management fee,
including $50,000 per month for overhead expenses. And this
year, President Robert Amman and Chief Financial Officer
Stewart J. Paperin received raises of 23% and 26%,
respectively, not counting bonuses. Their medical benefits
remain intact.</p>
<p>Mr. LeBow will no longer draw that management fee under a
deal worked out with the company's bondholders as one
condition for accepting an exchange offer aimed at
restructuring the company's $530 million in junk-bond debt.</p>
