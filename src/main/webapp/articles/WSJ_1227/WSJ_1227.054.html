	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- The U.S. is attempting to withdraw as many
Americans as possible from four pro-Iraq nations in the
Mideast and Africa.
   American officials fear that if war starts between the
U.S. and Iraq, U.S. citizens in those countries could be
vulnerable to both Iraq-inspired terrorist attacks and to
violence and harassment from local governments or pro-Iraqi
mobs.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Separately, a senior U.S. military intelligence officer in
Saudi Arabia predicted that Iraq's leader would defy the
United Nations demand that he pull his army out of Kuwait by
Jan. 15. The U.N. has sanctioned the use of force to oust
Iraqi troops after that date. Air Force Lt. Col. Tom Coury,
appearing at a military news conference in Riyadh, said, "We
presently assess that Saddam Hussein intends to remain in
Kuwait for the long haul."</p>
<p>Yesterday, the State Department ordered all "nonessential"
U.S. government employees and all dependents of government
employees, to leave Jordan and Sudan. It also urged all other
Americans to leave the two countries, whose governments
sympathize with Iraq, "well before" Jan. 15.</p>
<p>The U.S. already had been evacuating U.S. employees and
urging private Americans to leave Yemen, a third ally of
Iraq's. Also, the department has authorized -- but not
ordered -- the departure of government dependents and
nonessential government workers from Mauritania.</p>
<p>The department also has encouraged the departure of
dependents of U.S. government employees from Arab countries
that are friendly to the U.S. but close to the potential
battlefront. They include Bahrain, the United Arab Emirates,
Qatar and the Eastern Province of Saudi Arabia.</p>
<p>In Saudi Arabia, Lt. Col. Coury said at the first in a
planned series of military news conferences there that Iraqi
leader Saddam Hussein is spending so much of his scarce
resources digging into Kuwait that a peaceful withdrawal is
unlikely.</p>
<p>"One of the things you look at as an intelligence officer
is how a man is spending his resources," Lt. Col. Coury told
reporters. "You're looking at an economy that's embargoed
right now, and this man is spending tremendous resources to
build defenses in Kuwait and on his western flank," he said.
"And that suggests to me that he has all intentions of
remaining there."</p>
<p>Lt. Col. Coury also said a chemical-weapons attack on U.S.
and allied forces is "likely" if war breaks out, that Iraq
has installed Silkworm missiles to strike at U.S. ships, and
that it is "very realistic" to expect Iraq to try to attack
Israel if war starts.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, President Bush is scheduled to return from the
presidential retreat at Camp David today for staff
consultations on the Persian Gulf as well as other routine
business, the White House said. Aides wouldn't identify with
whom the president planned to meet; they said he is expected
to resume his vacation in midafternoon.</p>
