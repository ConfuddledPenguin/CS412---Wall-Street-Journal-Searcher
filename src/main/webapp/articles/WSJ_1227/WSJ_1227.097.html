	<p class="article-leader">Continental Insurance Cos. asked a U.S. court to protect
it from having to pay Wickes Cos.' defense costs in
securities-fraud cases involving Michael Milken.
   Continental filed the lawsuit in federal court in
Manhattan asking the court to declare that Wickes's general
liability coverage doesn't apply either to defense costs or
any damages that might be awarded. Wickes is named as a
defendant, along with Mr. Milken and Drexel Burnham Lambert
Group Inc.'s brokerage unit, in four civil lawsuits alleging
securities fraud.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Continental argues that the insurance doesn't apply mainly
because the cases allege wrongdoing by Wickes. According to
the lawsuit, the coverage applies only to damages or injuries
caused by an accident. "Stock manipulation is the antithesis
of an accident," said Barry Ostrager, an attorney
representing Continental. "That's someone willfully
committing something that is wrong."</p>
<p>The allegations against Wickes stem from stock
transactions in 1986 that allowed the company to convert its
preferred stock into nondividend-paying common shares and to
save about $15 million annually in dividend payments. The
lawsuits against Wickes, Mr. Milken and Drexel allege that
the conversion was the result of an illegal
stock-manipulation scheme. Prosecutors allege that Mr. Milken
directed the manipulation of the Wickes stock with the
assistance of Ivan Boesky; Wickes wasn't charged with any
criminal wrongdoing.</p>
<p>A spokeswoman for Wickes, a Santa Monica, Calif.,
manufacturer and retailer, declined to comment on the suit by
the Continental Corp. unit.</p>
<p>Both Mr. Milken and Mr. Boesky pleaded guilty to felonies
related to securities transactions, but the counts they
admitted didn't involve Wickes. Coincidentally, Continental's
lawsuit was assigned at random to Judge Kimba Wood, the same
judge who last month sentenced Mr. Milken to 10 years in
prison.</p>

<p>PFIZER LOSES bid to throw out investors' suits over heart
valve.</p>
<p>In federal court in Manhattan, Judge John Keenan rejected
a motion by Pfizer Inc. to dismiss the class-action lawsuits,
which seek unspecified damages. The lawsuits, which have been
consolidated, claim that investors from March 27, 1987, to
Feb. 26, 1990, were defrauded because Pfizer failed to
disclose problems with the artificial heart valve. On Feb.
26, a House subcommittee staff report criticized the New York
pharmaceutical company for its level of disclosure. The
heart-valve was removed from the market in 1986.</p>
<p>Pfizer argued that the suits should be dismissed for not
making adequate claims of fraud. But Judge Keenan, in
allowing the suits to go forward, said: "The sources of
plaintiffs' allegations, such as the staff report and others,
are highly reputable. The allegations, therefore, are not
unfounded or speculative."</p>
<p>Judge Keenan also said in his opinion that "Pfizer knew
that there were problems with the heart valves, and it knew
that suits {by heart-valve recipients} were being and
expected to be filed. Whether what was told to investors was
sufficient is an issue for trial."</p>
<p>Attorneys for Pfizer couldn't be reached for comment.</p>

<p>PROFESSOR WINS RIGHT to sue over alleged free speech
deprivation.</p>
<p>A federal judge ruled that the professor, who espouses the
view that blacks are intellectually inferior to whites, can
sue officials of City College of the City University of New
York for allegedly violating his First Amendment right of
free speech.</p>
<p>The professor, Michael Levin, who is white, teaches
philosophy at the college. His statements and writings about
race have led to protests and demonstrations at the school,
where the student body is 39% black, 28% Hispanic, 17% white
and 16% Asian. Following the campus protests, the college
formed a faculty committee to review the issue of when
academic freedom can be restricted and to examine some of Mr.
Levin's statements.</p>
<p>Judge Kenneth Conboy ruled that because the committee's
recommendations could lead to the revocation of Mr. Levin's
tenure, the professor's suit can proceed. The judge didn't
rule on whether the college infringed on the professor's
rights. Mr. Levin said he has turned down speaking
engagements and requests for articles because he is worried
about how the faculty committee will react.</p>
<p>In the suit, he also alleged that college officials were
unwilling to punish student protesters who disrupted his
classes and threatened his safety.</p>

<p>MOST LIBEL CLAIMS against Glamour are thrown out in
Foretich case.</p>
<p>A lawsuit by Eric A. Foretich alleged that a Glamour
magazine article left the false impression that he had
sexually abused his daughter, as claimed by his ex-wife,
Elizabeth Morgan.</p>
<p>In throwing out all but one remaining libel claim, U.S.
District Judge Gerhard Gesell of Washington stated that it
was "crystal clear" that the disputed statements constituted
opinions and thus were constitutionally protected. Conde Nast
Publications Inc. publishes Glamour.</p>
<p>The judge allowed Mr. Foretich to proceed with one libel
claim stemming from a reader's letter. A lawyer for Mr.
Foretich couldn't be reached for comment.</p>
