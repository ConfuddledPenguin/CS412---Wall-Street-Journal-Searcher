	<p class="article-leader">Southeast Banking Corp., Miami, said its primary banking
subsidiary is negotiating a 10-year agreement with
International Business Machines Corp. under which IBM will
manage the bank's data processing operations.
   The pact, part of a banking trend of handing over
computing tasks to computer companies, will save the
subsidiary, Southeast Bank, $6 million in the first year,
bank officials said. The agreement will also give, within one
year, the bank's 230 branches a sophisticated new system for
completing transactions.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Kenneth T. Sheridan, executive vice president for systems
and operations, said it would have taken Southeast three
years to assemble the system on its own, and would have cost
the bank more to operate it. He declined to put a value on
the transaction, which Southeast Bank and IBM expect to
complete next month.</p>
<p>Southeast Bank is attempting to cut costs as it struggles
with losses from commercial real estate loans. Southeast
Banking Corp. recorded a net loss of $164.4 million for the
first nine months of 1990.</p>
