   Lock In What With Whom?</h3>

	<p class="article-leader">Secretary of State Baker says Eduard Shevardnadze's
resignation shouldn't change U.S.-Soviet cooperation. With
the President scheduled to visit Moscow in February, U.S.
policy is to "lock in" arms-control agreements while the
Gorbachev era lasts.
   But the Shevardnadze resignation, it seems to us, raises
an even more fundamental question: With whom are we
negotiating? With the continued disintegration of the Soviet
Union, and with the collapse of President Gorbachev's de
facto authority even as he demands new paper authority, who
in the Soviet Union can order the Red Army to lay down its
arms?</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Recent events give us reason to doubt, indeed, whether
signing an agreement with Mr. Gorbachev can "lock in" the
current regime, let alone all future ones. In November, he
and President Bush signed a treaty paring back conventional
forces in Europe. But the ink was barely dry before the
Soviets began acting like there was no treaty at all. The
Soviets declared 20,000 fewer weapons than NATO thought they
had, and transferred others out of the area covered by the
treaty -- a clear treaty violation. By one account, the
Soviets literally replaced Army uniform patches with navy
markings, since naval "infantry" aren't covered by the
treaty.</p>
<p>Even before November, one of the largest military
movements in history had already transferred some 60,000
tanks and armored pieces east of the Urals, where they also
won't be covered by the treaty. This may be technically legal
under the treaty, but it doesn't say much for the spirit of
disarmament. Instead of being destroyed along with NATO's
weapons, Soviet tanks will now sit just a few hundred miles
further east.</p>
<p>The START nuclear-arms talks are also stymied, though
President Bush insists he wants to sign the treaty on his
February trip. The Soviets are balking at a U.S. request to
inspect plants for the rocket motors used to launch ballistic
missiles. These plants are easier for U.S. intelligence to
detect, so cheating would be more difficult. For their part,
the Soviets only want to allow inspection of missile-assembly
plants, which is like inspecting a house without looking at
the furnace. What do Soviet generals have to hide?</p>
<p>This verification point is critical because the U.S. has
already agreed to the Soviet request not to ban mobile
missiles. In a country (or Russian republic) spanning 11 time
zones, there are plenty of places to stash warheads. Congress
is in the process of killing America's mobile missiles (the
MX and Midgetman), so any Soviet breakout would leave them
far ahead. Throw in concessions the U.S. has already made
limiting our best weapon, the cruise missile, and it's easy
to imagine a treaty that Georgia chameleon Sam Nunn could
pick apart in the Senate.</p>
<p>And, amazingly, new SS-24 missiles (deployed on rail cars)
and SS-25s (on trucks) continue to roll off the assembly
line. The SS-25 made its first public appearance in a Kremlin
parade in November. Soviet military capabilities remain
formidable, and have continued to grow despite glasnost and
the rest. In particular, the Kremlin retains the world's
largest nuclear arsenal, with warheads still aimed at
Washington and Wyoming, not Baghdad. Leningrad citizens may
be clamoring for food, but the Soviet military seems to have
no problem getting what it needs. Indeed, the military
refuses to release or account for its own strategic food
reserves.</p>
<p>All of which makes us wonder, what's our rush? So far,
arms control has not reduced the Soviet threat, even with Mr.
Shevardnadze, Mr. Gorbachev and the rest. It is even less
likely to restrain the Soviets if, as Mr. Shevardnadze fears,
its political system evolves back to "dictatorship." Indeed,
agreements may even retard Soviet reform by guaranteeing the
Soviet military a certain "floor" for its military
production. It's possible Mr. Baker wants a treaty for
American political purposes, of course, though it might prove
embarrassing to sign a treaty with a leader who turns around
and declares martial law in the Baltics.</p>
<p>The Soviets are the ones who should be dying for arms
agreements, not us. They have the economy that's a shambles,
and the empire that's breaking at the seams. Why lock in
anything now? If we've really won the Cold War, why don't we
just declare victory in arms control, too?</p>
