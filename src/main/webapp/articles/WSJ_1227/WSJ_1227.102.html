	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- If anything in the 1980s caught on faster than
Nintendo, Ninja Turtles or junk bonds, it was the
recreational cruise. In 1981, 41,000 berths were afloat in
North America. The number now is 84,000, with 18,000 more due
in the next two years.
   The chief exponent and beneficiary of this boom has been
Carnival Cruise Lines, the biggest North American operator.
The question now is to what extent Carnival may suffer from
an overhang of berths, which is hitting the market just as
higher air fares are raising the cost of air and sea
packages, the world is awash in rival amusements such as
theme parks and casinos, and the economy seems headed into a
recessionary dive.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Miami-based Carnival is, according to travel agents and
tour operators, the best cruise operator going. And with the
exception of tiny Regency Cruises, Carnival is the only
publicly traded U.S. operator. Short of buying or selling an
ocean liner, Carnival's stock is the only major way for
investors to play the cruise market.</p>
<p>That market appears soft. Travel agents say bookings are
holding up, but prices are not. "There is an awful lot of
discounting going on," says Jay Lewis, president of Market
Scope, a market research firm. "Everybody is feeling it," a
tour operator adds.</p>
<p>Howard Frank, Carnival's senior vice president for
finance, says "we really haven't seen any softness. Our
bookings are holding strong." However, Mr. Frank's tone is
that of a man who has, at least, glimpsed the potential for
softness. Carnival's brochure prices for 1991 are being held
flat. Why? "Uncertainty about what this softer economy will
do for us," Mr. Frank says. "If people keep telling you that
things are soft, your thinking becomes colored."</p>
<p>On its two oldest ships (out of 15 mostly newer ones)
Carnival is already promoting or discounting more heavily
than in past years, Mr. Frank says. And Carnival's Bahamas
hotel and casino, which according to Mr. Frank "seems more
prone to recession," should post losses of $20 million to $22
million for fiscal 1990, ended Nov. 30.</p>
<p>Air fares paid by Carnival will rise an estimated 10% in
1991. Carnival hedges most, but not all, of its fuel costs.
And its labor costs, in 1991 as in most years, are apt to
rise a bit. The coupling of higher costs with stable prices,
Mr. Frank notes, will depress profit margins on cruises,
perhaps by a couple of percentage points. The engine of
Carnival's growth, in the immediate future, will be more
beds. The 2,044-berth Ecstasy will debut in June; three other
ships are in construction.</p>
<p>Thus, Carnival will need to continue growing even as the
general economy, and in particular, the market for leisure
dollars, contracts. Mr. Frank says it will do so. The company
has an advantage in name-recognition with travel agents and
tourists. "We have a huge reservations center; we make it
easy for agents to book on Carnival," he says.</p>
<p>Wall Street agrees. Bear Stearns, Salomon Brothers and
Shearson Lehman are bullish on Carnival shares. At 14 1/2,
they trade at 9 1/2 times earnings based on Carnival's
estimate of $1.50 to $1.55 a share for the recently ended
fiscal year. This, to Shearson's Caroline Levy, signals that
the stock is "more than discounting the negatives of fuel
prices and recession."</p>
<p>But Wall Street in some respects seems to believe that
Carnival will sail through the recession essentially
unscathed. Steven Eisenberg of Bear Stearns says, "The public
is demanding price and value and Carnival's reputation is
built on that." He envisions net income rising 13% in fiscal
1991. Salomon, despite the soft market, sees Carnival's
cruise revenue growing in 1991 by 15% and profit margins on
cruises dropping by only a half-percentage point.</p>
<p>At 14 1/2, Carnival is trading at about twice its book
value and it has $1.27 billion in debt, equal to a hefty 57%
of capital. Carnival's strengths are real. It may suffer a
recession after other cruise lines, and to a lesser extent
than others. But given the supply of berths, it seems
unlikely that if discounting becomes fierce Carnival won't be
hurt.</p>
<p>The secret of its heady growth has been that Ted Arison,
Carnival's founder and controlling stockholder, recognized
that cruises, once the preserve of the idle rich, could be
popularized. Although some of its cruises are pricey,
Carnival's passengers, in the main, are what Bear Stearns'
Mr. Eisenberg refers to as "Mr. and Mrs. Middle America." If
anyone is apt to feel the recession, they will. The most
beguiling of bullish arguments, stated by Salomon, is that
more supply will lead to more demand. As Salomon puts it,
"the fanfare associated with major ship launchings {may} help
inflate demand, and to some extent offset a weak economy."
But after 10 years of new ship launchings, this may be a
slender reed on which to invest.</p>
