	<p class="article-leader">French tourism group Club Mediterranee S.A. announced a
7.1% increase in group revenue for the year ended Oct. 31,
1990.
   The company's revenue rose to 8.15 billion francs ($1.55
billion) from 7.61 billion francs a year earlier.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The company didn't release profit figures, but earlier
this month, it estimated earnings after payments to minority
interests would be up about 8% in the year ended Oct. 31 from
the 365 million francs posted in the year-earlier period.</p>
<p>The company noted, however, that it hasn't yet taken
account of capital gains recorded in the latest period.</p>
<p>If the 1989-90 figures come in as expected, they would
represent an improvement from the 3% profit decline in the
first half, although they pale in comparison to a 21% advance
the year before.</p>
<p>Several negative trends affect the company, however. Club
Med is experiencing weak sales in the Mediterranean region as
a result of the Persian Gulf crisis, and the economic
slowdown in the U.S. has cut into North American sales for
its Club Med Inc. unit.</p>
