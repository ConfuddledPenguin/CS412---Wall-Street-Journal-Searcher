	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Unlisted stocks were unable to match the gains
posted by New York Stock Exchange issues yesterday and ended
fractionally lower in thin trading.
   Traders say many market participants were absent as they
extended their Christmas holiday. National Market System
volume totaled 57.4 million shares, the fourth lowest daily
volume recorded this year.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"Portfolio managers aren't reachable. The players just are
not in today," said George Jennison, co-manager of OTC
trading at Wheat First-Butcher & Singer. "It's tough to get
anything done."</p>
<p>The Nasdaq Composite Index fell a fractional 0.01 to
372.40. Meanwhile, the Big Board composite index gained 0.59,
or 0.33%, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average added 15.84,
or 0.60%.</p>
<p>While year-end portfolio adjustments helped push the
industrial average higher, that momentum didn't carry to the
over-the-counter market. But traders see yearend related
factors boosting volume in unlisted shares later this week
and next Monday.</p>
<p>Steve Bliss, head of OTC trading at Mabon Nugent, says "a
little year-end rally" could develop later this week based on
portfolio adjustments. But he says that once 1991 begins,
there will be little reason to buy stocks ahead of the Jan.
15 United Nations deadline for Iraq's withdrawal from Kuwait.</p>
<p>"I think everyone is going to be a little tentative
waiting for Jan. 15," Mr. Bliss says. Uncertainty about a
possible military confrontation in the Middle East has put
downward pressure on the market since the August invasion.</p>
<p>Advancing Nasdaq issues narrowly outnumbered decliners 846
to 826 yesterday.</p>
<p>Enstar Group led active issues, closing down 1/32 to 3/32
on unusually heavy volume of 2.3 million shares. About
245,000 Enstar shares typically change hands daily.</p>
<p>Other active issues include: MCI Communications, which
ended unchanged at 19 1/2; First Executive Corp., which
gained 3/32 to 1/2; Apple Computer, which dropped 1/4 to 43
3/4; and Intel, which shed 1 3/8 to 37 1/2.</p>
<p>Acclaim Entertainment added 1 1/2 to 5 1/4. The stock was
included this week on a Barron's list of stocks whose share
prices have been battered recently despite positive earnings
prospects and solid fundamentals. Acclaim's chief financial
officer, Anthony Williams, says he also suspects
short-covering aided in the stock's rise, according to Dow
Jones Professional Investor Report.</p>
<p>Short-covering refers to the purchase of shares by people
who have previously sold borrowed shares. Short sellers
profit when the shares they have borrowed decline in price,
and they are able to replace the borrowed equities with
shares purchased at a discount.</p>
<p>Micro Healthsystems gained 1 1/4 to 22 1/2 after having
added a point Monday. Its chief financial officer, Walter
Cruickshank, said Monday that there were no corporate
developments to account for the rise. But he noted that the
firm was favorably mentioned in the January issue of the
"Special Situations Letter," a newsletter published by
Financial Research Center Inc. of Holliston, Mass.</p>
<p>Repligen rose 3/4 to 12 3/4. Chief Financial Officer
Ramesh L. Ratan says he isn't aware of any corporate
developments to explain the increase. The move, he says, may
be a continued reaction to positive comments about the firm
made on Dec. 17 by Oppenheimer & Co. analyst Jeffrey Casdin,
according to DJPIR.</p>
<p>Octel Communications slumped 1/2 to 12 after losing a
point on Monday. Hambrecht & Quist analyst Steve Levy
recently trimmed his earnings estimates for several makers of
voice and data communications equipment, including Octel,
Digital Microwave and Tellabs.</p>
<p>Tellabs added 1/8 to 15, after dropping 1/4 on Monday;
Digital Microwave rose 1/2 to 17 3/4, after shedding 1 5/8
Monday.</p>
<p>M.S. Carriers gained 3/4 to 17 3/4, a move that the firm
was unable to explain. A spokesman said there were no
developments to account for the advance, and said the firm is
comfortable with analysts' 1990 earnings estimates of about
$1.32 a share, according to DJPIR. The company earned $1.57 a
share in 1989.</p>
<p>Envirosource rose 7/16 to 4. A company spokesman said the
move was in reaction to news late last week that the Ohio
Hazardous Waste Facility Board voted to reconsider a decision
that had denied a subsidiary's expansion at a waste facility.
The stock advanced 5/16 on Monday.</p>
<p>AST Research rose 5/8 to 34 1/8. This newspaper yesterday
reported that the computer maker continues to gain market
share and increase its earnings as it introduces new
products. Another personal computer maker, Dell Computer,
rose 5/8 to 16 5/8.</p>
