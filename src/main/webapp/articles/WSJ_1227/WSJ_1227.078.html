	<p class="article-leader">BEVERLY HILLS, Calif. -- Investor Leonard M. Ross said he
has proposed to buy all the shares of Hotel Investors Trust
and Hotel Investors Corp. for $13.7 million.
   Mr. Ross currently owns 9.8%, or a 1,190,400 share stake
in the companies, which are paired and trade together on the
New York Stock Exchange.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange
yesterday, Hotel Investors Trust and Hotel Investors Corp.
shares closed at $1.625, up 50 cents.</p>
<p>In a Dec. 21 letter attached to a Securities and Exchange
Commission filing, Mr. Ross said that the proposal would
consist of a merger between Rossco Holdings Inc. or a newly
organized corporation to be formed by him, called Newco, and
Hotel Investors.</p>
<p>Under the merger proposal, holders of the paired shares
would receive $1.25 a share in cash and the stock of a newly
formed subsidiary, the Nevada Corp., into which all of the
assets associated with hotel and gambling properties would be
placed free and clear of mortgage debt. According to the
filing, the stock to be received would be registered.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, Hotel Investors Trust, a real estate
investment trust based in Los Angeles, suffered a series of
setbacks in its long effort to sell most of its hotels to
Park Plaza Inc., a unit of EIE International Corp. of Japan.
Park Plaza told Hotel Investors that it was unlikely to
complete the sale because of financing problems.</p>
