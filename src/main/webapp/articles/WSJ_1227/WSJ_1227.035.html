	<p class="article-leader">Tokyo stocks ended mixed in razor-thin trading Wednesday
as concerns about the Mideast and the situation in the Soviet
Union continued to discourage investor participation.
   The number of gaining issues increased during the
afternoon session, however, in response to advances in
Japanese bond prices. Some investors, anticipating that some
investment trust funds will start spending fresh money on
stocks, came into the market to buy, traders said.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>In Europe Wednesday, most markets were closed for
holidays.</p>
<p>The Nikkei index of 225 selected issues rose 119.68 to
23887.56, the first advance in four trading days. The index
lost 351.72 points Tuesday.</p>
<p>In trading early Thursday, the Nikkei was up 33.76 to
23921.32.</p>
<p>Volume on the first section Wednesday was estimated at 220
million shares, little changed from 228.7 million shares
Tuesday. Declining issues outnumbered advancing shares 462 to
441, while 161 others remained unchanged.</p>
<p>The Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed in the
first section, which lost 39.65 points Tuesday, was up 4.64
points, or 0.27%, at 1729.81.</p>
<p>The Second Section Index, which dropped 46.40 points
Tuesday, was down 17.17 points, or 0.63%, to close at
2718.07, the lowest level this year. Volume in the second
section was estimated at four million shares, down from 5.6
million shares Tuesday.</p>
<p>Stock prices moved stably for most of the day, helped by a
decline in selling pressure, traders said.</p>
<p>Transactions for stocks traded Wednesday will be settled
on Jan. 4, the first trading day of 1991, and fund managers
who are extending their New Year holidays to Jan. 4 didn't
place any orders, some traders said.</p>
<p>"Life insurance companies {which have been active
profit-takers recently} were very quiet. . . . It helped to
thin selling," said a trader at Wako Securities.</p>
<p>Buying activity was also sluggish as most investors
refrained from increasing their positions ahead of the long
holidays.</p>
<p>The market has seen a year-end rally every year in the
past decade. But this year that won't be the case,
participants said.</p>
<p>The Middle East crisis and the uncertain political
direction of the Soviet Union are "too-big factors," said
Yoshihiro Ito, general manager of stock trading at Okasan
Securities. Fears that the situations may worsen during the
holidays are keeping investors from buying, he said.</p>
<p>With only one and a half days of trading left in the year,
many analysts predict that trading will reflect a tug-of-war
between buying by investment trust funds and selling by
margin traders.</p>
<p>According to Shin Tokoi, general manager of stock trading
at County NatWest Securities, about 250 billion yen ($1.84
billion) is expected to be newly invested on the market
beginning Thursday. Meanwhile, he said, about 350 billion yen
of stock exists as potential sell pressure prompted by margin
calls in the week.</p>
<p>Most investors can't or don't want to participate toward
the year end other than to hedge risks trading in futures and
options, Mr. Tokoi said.</p>
<p>Despite the relative firmness of stock prices Wednesday,
substantial trade activities were nonexistent, he said.</p>
<p>Fumihiko Ishii, manager of investment research at Nomura
Securities, said few investors are likely to increase their
positions ahead of the New Year holidays, but that "doesn't
necessarily mean stock prices will decline." He predicts
stable price moves for the remaining trading days.</p>
<p>"Investors have few reasons to expect stock price plunges
from the current level" ahead of Jan. 15, the deadline set by
the United Nations for Iraq to withdraw from Kuwait, Mr.
Ishii added.</p>
<p>As the bond market firmed in the afternoon,
interest-rate-sensitive, large-capital shares were pushed up
by bargain hunters, traders said. Among shipbuilding
companies, Hitachi Zosen rose 19 yen to 479 yen and Kawasaki
Heavy Industries gained 5 yen to 526 yen.</p>
<p>Construction shares ended mostly higher. Ohbayashi gained
10 yen to 860 yen, while Kajima rose 20 yen to 1,580 yen.</p>
<p>Shimizu ended flat at 1,500 yen, however.</p>
<p>Blue-chip electronics concerns advanced in the afternoon,
with Hitachi up 20 yen at 1,110 yen. Pioneer gained 20 yen to
4,050 yen, while Sharp rose 20 yen to 1,170 yen.</p>
<p>Separately, the Tokyo Stock Exchange said that in the week
ended Dec. 21, the balance of margin buying declined 177.5
billion yen to 4.959 trillion yen, the seventh consecutive
week of decline. The balance of outstanding short positions,
meanwhile, fell 4.7 billion yen to 632.5 billion yen.</p>
<p>Elsewhere Wednesday, share prices closed lower in Paris
and Madrid. Markets in London, Frankfurt, Zurich, Brussels,
Amsterdam, Stockholm, Helsinki, Copenhagen, Oslo, Milan and
Johannesburg were closed for holidays.</p>
<p>Share prices closed lower in Singapore, higher in Taipei,
and mixed in Manila and Seoul. The markets in Sydney, Hong
Kong and Wellington were closed for holidays.</p>
<p>Here are price trends on the world's major stock markets,
as calculated by Morgan Stanley Capital International
Perspective, Geneva. To make them directly comparable, each
index is based on the close of 1969 equaling 100. The
percentage change is since year-end.</p>
