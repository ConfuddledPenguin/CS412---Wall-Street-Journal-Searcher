	<p class="article-leader">HOLLISTON, Mass. -- Money-fund yields were little changed
in the latest week, despite the recent decline in short-term
interest rates.
   "Moves in recent weeks to lower interest rates have been
counteracted by year-end pressures that drive rates up," said
Martha Wittbrodt, editor of IBC/Donoghue's Money Fund Report.
"But I expect yields to drop after the first of the year."</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The average seven-day compound yield, which assumes
reinvestment of dividends, remained at 7.42% in the week
ended Tuesday, according to Donoghue's. The average 30-day
compound yield eased to 7.47% from 7.49%.</p>
<p>Assets of the 453 taxable funds tracked by the newsletter,
based here, decreased $1 billion, to $419.2 billion.</p>
<p>The average maturity of the investments in fund portfolios
decreased one day, to 51 days. The funds invest in such
things as commercial paper -- or short-term corporate IOUs --
short-term bank certificates of deposit and Treasury bills.</p>
<p>The average seven-day simple yield of the taxable funds
eased to 7.16% from 7.17%. The average 30-day simple yield
eased to 7.21% from 7.23%.</p>
<p>Assets of the 245 tax-free funds fell $50 million, to
$85.5 billion, Donoghue's reported. The average seven-day
compound yield increased to 5.87% from 5.55%. The latest
yield is equal to 8.15% for an investor in the 28% tax
bracket and 8.76% for someone paying 33% in taxes.</p>
<p>The average maturity of the tax-exempt funds increased one
day, to 55 days.</p>
