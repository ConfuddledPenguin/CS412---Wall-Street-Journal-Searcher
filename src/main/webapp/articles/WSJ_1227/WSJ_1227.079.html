	<p class="article-leader">BEIJING -- As the centerpiece of the new $450 million
World Trade Center, the China World Hotel was envisioned as
an elegant refuge for refined tourists, wealthy traders and
globe-trotting tycoons.
   Today, its marble lobby resembles a luxurious loading
dock. While the hotel orchestra performs Mozart, overweight
couples in overshoes tramp in, dragging huge nylon bags of
clothing behind them. Gumsnapping students and young women
sporting tight jeans, spiked hair and a jangle of bloated gym
bags shuffle through in noisy groups.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The desired clientele of genteel capitalists disappeared
from Beijing after troops opened fire on demonstrators 18
months ago. So this city's top hotels are settling for an
unusual strain of socialist fat cats: Yugoslavian black
marketeers.</p>
<p>They are vacationers with a purpose and they are flooding
into Beijing at the rate of nearly 1,000 a week. Staying
usually six or seven days, they mine money from the cracks
between their country and China's half-reformed socialist
systems. They buy whatever isn't available in Yugoslavia,
from silk shirts to cigarette lighters to fishing rods, and
resell it for prices five to 10 times higher on the black
market back home. A typical profit from such a trip is
$3,000.</p>
<p>Guest-starved quality hotels here will rent rooms for
about $50 a night. So the visiting Yugoslav proletarians live
like plutocrats in Beijing. They savage breakfast buffets,
stuffing purses and pockets with enough for lunch and dinner.
Room service gets requests for a dozen free toothbrushes at a
time. Blankets and silverware disappear. A hotel that gave
money to a woman claiming cash was stolen from her room found
30 Yugoslavs lined up the next day with the same grievance.</p>
<p>What the Yugoslav visitors lack in refinement, they make
up for in business savvy. Their country's late leader,
Marshal Tito, was a renegade among Communists because he
allowed small private shops. This inspired the Chinese to do
the same 12 years ago.</p>
<p>Yugoslavia is far ahead though, with a $6,500 per-capita
income compared with China's $340. China has the edge in
manufacturing clothing and consumer goods. But official
trading channels and socialist bureaucracies of both
countries are too balled up in red tape to respond. Private
Yugoslavs can't get licenses to trade with China. Chinese
can't leave their country to sell in Yugoslavia. So the gap
is filled by any Yugoslav who can arrange a week off and get
enough cash for a plane ticket.</p>
<p>"If the travel agents could get the planes, this place
would be full of Yugoslavians," says Jasmina Janik, the
Yugoslavian sales manager of Beijing's Jianguo Hotel. "The
good hotels are fighting for these groups because it is the
only market existing now."</p>
<p>Alex is a 29-year-old chemist at a state factory. Dressed
in a black silk coat and green silk shirt and slacks, he sits
in a hotel bar reminiscing about the good old days of last
January. At that time, Alex could spend $3,000 on silk shirts
and ties in Beijing and turn it into $10,000 in Belgrade.
Then word spread about this money-making vacation of a
lifetime in China. With the coming of the hordes, Alex now
spends $4,000 to earn $7,000 because prices are up here and
down in Yugoslavia. He'll keep coming anyhow. His state
factory is going under. "There's much more money in coming
here," says Alex, who like others requests only his first
name be used because selling imported goods without a license
in Yugoslavia is illegal.</p>
<p>The top attraction for most foreign visitors to Beijing is
the Forbidden City, a magnificent 9,000-room palace where
China's emperors lived for 600 years. Yugoslavs find it
boring. There's nothing to buy. Few visit the ornate,
6,670-acre Temple of Heaven. But many stop at the market
outside its front gate to buy cigarette lighters, calculators
and pearls. The Great Wall? They can't resist. A vendor there
has Beijing's cheapest silk tablecloths.</p>
<p>Yugoslav tourists flock to Elegant Water Street, a narrow
alley where about 100 private vendors in cramped metal stalls
hawk clothing. Yugoslav buyers and Chinese vendors, who share
no common language, huddle over calculators, haggling with
hand signals and the only phrase they seem to need is "Show
your last price."</p>
<p>An $18 silk blouse fetches $100 in Belgrade. A $40 down
jacket sells there for $200 or more. Leather coats bought for
$200 can bring $1,000.</p>
<p>"I love Yugoslavs," says Xiao Guo, a sweater vendor posing
for pictures with Yugoslav secretaries who just spent a
bundle at his stall. "Our business was dead until they
started coming."</p>
<p>After a hard day of shopping, soaking in the China World
hotel's black marble whirlpool bath is a welcome respite. A
corpulent Yugoslav bank clerk flails about, using his first
whirlpool experience to see how many water jets can tickle
his body at the same time. Perica, a 27-year-old engineering
student wearing a thick gold necklace, is more sedate. He
made $4,000 on last month's trip. He plans to come back for a
third visit in January. As a student, he says he can live
well on $5,000 a year. Leaning back gazing at the ceiling,
Perica sums up his Christmas vacation:</p>
<p>"I don't like communists. I don't like China. But this
isn't a bad place to do business."</p>
