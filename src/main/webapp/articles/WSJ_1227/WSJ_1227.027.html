	<p class="article-leader">TOKYO -- Sales at Japan's department stores and other
major retail stores grew 6.6% in November from a year earlier
to 1.712 trillion yen ($12.58 billion), the Ministry of
International Trade and Industry said.
   The pace of year-on-year growth picked up from October's
4.7%. November volume continued to suffer from sluggish sales
of winter clothes and heaters because of unusually warm
weather, however, a ministry official said. The 6.6%
year-on-year growth is still slower than levels earlier this
year, when retail sales posted double-digit growth.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Meanwhile, November sales were pushed up partly by
high-paced growth of food sales at both department stores and
other retailers. The official said the growth reflects sharp
price increases in fresh vegetables and fruit caused by
unfavorable weather conditions.</p>
