	<p class="article-leader">JAPAN'S UNION MEMBERS</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Union members in Japan increased this year for the first
time in eight years, but their share in the total labor force
dropped to the lowest level since the end of the war,
according to a survey released by the Labor Ministry.</p>
<p>Ministry officials said union membership grew 37,000 at
the end of last June from a year earlier to 12.27 million,
putting an end to a downtrend that started in 1983. However,
union members accounted for 25.2% of the country's entire
labor force, down 0.7 percentage point from the previous year
and the lowest level in the postwar era, officials noted.</p>
<p>Ministry officials ascribed the decline to an expanding
population of workers as a result of Japan's sustained
economic growth. The long-lasting economic expansion, now in
its 49th month, has brought more women and part-time workers
into the labor market, they said. This influx grew faster
than the number of workers joining labor unions, they
explained.</p>
<p>Ministry officials said, at the same time, that the number
of labor unions throughout the country dropped 403 to 72,202
at the end of June.</p>
<p>OECD'S JOBLESS OUTLOOK</p>
<p>The unemployment rate among the 24 members of the
Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development held
steady in October from September at 6.1% of the work force,
the OECD said. But the group of industrialized nations said
initial data for November suggest that "the recent period of
stability has come to an end: The unemployment rate rose in
all six countries for which data are available."

<p>EXPANDING BARAJAS AIRPORT</p>
<p>Madrid's Barajas International Airport is to triple its
terminal space and add three runways under a
200-billion-peseta ($2.03 billion) expansion plan. Spain's
Transport Minister Jose Barrionuevo said the three-phase
plan, expected to end in 2030, includes a major increase in
parking space and access to downtown Madrid by high-speed
train and superhighway. The airport is to accommodate up to
80 million passengers a year; it now handles 16 million,
sixth among European airports.</p>
<p>MAZDA PENALIZES EXECUTIVES</p>
<p>Japan's Mazda Motor Corp. will cut the salaries of
Chairman Kenichi Yamamoto and 17 other executives by 5% to
10% for 1991's first three months. The cuts were announced
one day after the Transport Ministry warned Mazda to pay
stricter attention to the safety of its cars. The ministry
earlier investigated allegations that Mazda has been
replacing defective parts during routine maintenance without
recalling the cars or notifying the government. After the
warning, Madza notified the ministry that it would recall
3,498 Luce model passenger cars produced between Aug. 8,
1986, and Jan. 31, 1987, because of switch defects. None of
the cars went to the U.S.</p>
<p>BRAZIL STUDIES TAX CUTS ON AUTOS</p>
<p>Brazil is studying tax cuts and legal action to force the
nation's foreign-owned auto makers to curb "abusive prices,"
the Economy Ministry said. The move would force the companies
"to compete with less expensive and better-made cars," a
ministry spokesman said. Imports of foreign cars now are
subject to a 40% tax. "We are studying the possibility of
lowering this tax or eliminating it altogether," the
spokesman said.</p>
<p>RECORD EXPENSE SPENDING</p>
<p>Expense-account spending by Japanese corporate executives
totaled a record $36.53 billion between February 1989 and
January 1990, according to the annual report of the National
Tax Administration Agency. The agency said the figure was
9.4% higher than the previous year's, which had been the
record. Company expense-account spending is tax-deductible in
Japan.</p>
<p>CHANGING ALBANIA</p>
<p>Albania's state bank has joined a Swiss company to form
the first bank with foreign capital in the communist country,
the state news agency ATA said.</p>
<p>ATA said the bank would be known as Iliria Bank and would
start trading in January in Tirana. It named the partners as
the Albanian State Bank for Relations with Foreign Countries
and a Swiss company, Iliria Holding S.A. It didn't state
their respective stakes or say how much capital was involved.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, Albania's President Ramiz Alia lifted
measures imposed by his predecessor, the late Stalinist
leader Enver Hoxha, that made it a crime to seek foreign
investment or loans for the long-isolated Balkan state.</p>
<p>ATA said the new bank would help attract foreign capital
for construction projects in such areas of the economy as
light industry, foodstuffs, building materials,
electromechanics and tourism.</p>
<p>POSTSCRIPTS . . .</p>
<p>A Japanese district court ordered the city of Iwaki to pay
$81,000 in compensation to the family of a 14-year-old
student who committed suicide after being bullied by his
classmates. "The main cause of the suicide was bullying, and
the school failed to fully discharge its duty of protecting
and superintending {students}," a Japanese news agency quoted
the presiding judge as saying. . . . Robert Fitzpatrick,
president of Euro Disneyland, said the $3 billion theme park
near Paris would open on schedule in early 1992.</p>
