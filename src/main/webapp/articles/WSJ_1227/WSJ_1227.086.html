	<p class="article-leader">The Securities and Exchange Commission is investigating
whether McDonnell Douglas Corp. and General Dynamics Corp.
have made proper financial disclosures regarding the troubled
A-12 aircraft program, both companies confirmed.
   Word of the SEC inquiry, which was first reported by
Defense Week, a trade publication, comes on the heels of a
separate criminal investigation into the A-12 project. That
probe is being led by the U.S. attorney in St. Louis, where
both companies are based.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Defense Secretary Dick Cheney has given the contractors
until Wednesday to devise a plan to save the A-12, which
although designed to replace the Navy's aging fleet of A-6
attack planes, has been plagued by cost overruns, technical
snags and schedule slips.</p>
<p>"The SEC has informed us that they are conducting an
informal inquiry related to our disclosures about and
accounting for the A-12 program," a McDonnell Douglas
spokesman said.</p>
<p>A General Dynamics spokesman said the company is "aware
there's an investigation going on," but wouldn't comment
further. In Washington, an SEC spokesman declined comment.</p>
<p>In the second quarter, General Dynamics registered a $450
million charge against earnings on the A-12, while McDonnell
Douglas used a different accounting method and didn't take a
writeoff. "We believe it's the difference in reporting that
led to the inquiry," the McDonnell Douglas spokesman said.</p>
