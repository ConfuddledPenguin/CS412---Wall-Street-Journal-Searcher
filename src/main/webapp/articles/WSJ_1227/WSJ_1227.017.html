	<p class="article-leader">PHILADELPHIA -- Presbyterian Ministers' Fund, which bills
itself as the world's oldest life insurance company and the
oldest continuously operated corporation in the U.S.,
observed its 273 years by changing its name to Covenant Life
Insurance Co.
   The company started in 1717 as a relief fund for
Presbyterian ministers and their families who were having
financial difficulties.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Presbyterian, incorporated since 1759, said the name
Covenant better reflects the diversity of its clientele,
which now includes clergy of many denominations, including
Baptists and Methodists.</p>
<p>"People wouldn't understand that the company wasn't just
for Presbyterians," said a spokeswoman. "We did a lot of
biblical research to come up with a name that was more
friendly to our customers in the religious community."</p>
<p>The company has offices in 40 states, $471 million in
total assets and more than $2 billion of insurance in force.</p>
