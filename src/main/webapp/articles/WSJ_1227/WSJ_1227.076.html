	<p class="article-leader">Windmill Corp. said the Federal Trade Commission approved
its pending acquisition of White Lily Foods Co., a unit of
Archer-Daniels-Midland Co.
   Based in San Francisco, Windmill, a privately held
specialty miller of consumer baking products sold under a
variety of labels, said the acquisition of White Lily will
"fit well" with the company's current product line. And the
purchase fits into the company's strategy to broaden its
reach as a national supplier of consumer baking products.
Windmill reported annual sales of $300 million a year ago.
Terms weren't disclosed.</p>

throughout the southeastern U.S. Windmill said the
transaction should be completed sometime in January.</p>
