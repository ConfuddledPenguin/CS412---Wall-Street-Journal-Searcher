	<p class="article-leader">BOSTON (AP) -- Hemophilia patients, many already infected
with the AIDS virus, may be spared from using blood-based
products that can contain other viruses, new research
suggests.
   The first large-scale testing of a new genetically
engineered clotting protein, called recombinant factor VIII,
shows that it works as well as the natural variety of factor
VIII derived from human blood plasma. The development could
allow hemophiliacs to routinely take preventative doses, as
diabetics take insulin, one specialist says.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"It's a tremendous advance and one we are all excited
about for the hemophiliac community," said Dr. Jeanne M.
Lusher, who tested the new material at Children's Hospital of
Michigan in Detroit.</p>
<p>Hemophilia is caused by a genetic defect that's passed
from mothers to sons and afflicts about 20,000 American men.
Patients fail to produce enough factor VIII, a protein
necessary for the body to form clots to stop bleeding.
Without treatment, cuts may bleed for days into joints,
causing crippling deformities.</p>
<p>Injections of factor VIII derived from donated blood can
control bleeding. But early in the acquired immune deficiency
syndrome epidemic, factor VIII was widely tainted with HIV,
the AIDS virus, though no one knew it at the time. As a
result, about 60% of hemophiliacs are infected with HIV, even
though most do not have AIDS.</p>
<p>New purification techniques have made factor VIII free of
HIV, but some specialists worry that some new microbe might
silently infiltrate this treatment again if blood remains the
sole source.</p>
<p>Now, two companies are competing to introduce factor VIII
made by inserting a human gene into animal tissue that churns
out the protein in large quantities. Since they involve no
blood, the products should not contain viruses or potentially
harmful human proteins that can slip through purification
processes.</p>
<p>Last year, Baxter Healthcare Corp., a unit of Baxter
International Inc., reported on preliminary use of its
variety of recombinant factor VIII on two patients. In
today's New England Journal of Medicine, Cutter Biological
described results of testing its competing product on 107
hemophiliacs. Both forms of factor VIII are being considered
for approval by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.</p>
<p>Most of the patients in the study have been using the
genetically engineered factor VIII for nearly two years. The
treatment effectively controlled their bleeding and caused no
unwanted side effects.</p>
<p>"It offers the potential for people with hemophilia to
have an interim cure," said Alan Brownstein, executive
director of the National Hemophilia Foundation.</p>
