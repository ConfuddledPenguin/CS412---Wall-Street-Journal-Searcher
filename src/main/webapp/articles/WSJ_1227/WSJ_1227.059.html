	<p class="article-leader">Fame was fleeting.
   A once-promising celebrity magazine, Fame shut its doors
last week after two years. Its founder and publisher, Steven
Greenberg, said he decided to close the magazine after
estimating that advertising pages for the monthly wouldn't
grow in 1991 and that he needed to invest heavily to increase
the magazine's circulation.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>An executive at the magazine said Mr. Greenberg spent more
than $10 million on the start-up and operation of Fame. In an
interview, Mr. Greenberg said that in the last year he had
been contacted by potential buyers of a part interest in the
magazine. There was no sale, however, because no agreement
could be reached on the size of needed future investments, he
said.</p>
<p>There is a remote chance that Fame could be brought back
to life by its editor in chief, Gael Love. Mr. Greenberg said
Ms. Love has begun discussions with outside investors who may
be interested in buying the magazine.</p>
<p>In a difficult publishing climate, the folding of Fame
isn't considered a surprise, particularly because it
published independently of any other magazine titles. Most of
the magazines that have gone out of business in 1990
published independently or were part of small publishing
groups. Fame had a staff of about 45, based in New York and
Los Angeles.</p>
<p>"We would have had a market in the 1980s, but the '80s are
over," Mr. Greenberg said. "In 1991, many magazines are going
to look as thin as pamphlets."</p>
<p>America's seemingly endless fascination with celebrities
and movie stars made Fame's magazine category a relatively
sturdy one. Fame's recent cover subjects included Warren
Beatty, Cybill Shepherd and Tom Hanks, and the last issue in
December carried stories on composer Andrew Lloyd Webber's
love affairs and a murder in Beverly Hills.</p>
<p>Though Fame was noteworthy for sensational stories, its
circulation never exceeded 200,000 after its launch in 1988.
Mr. Greenberg said he had expected the magazine to make a
profit in 1991, but that plan was derailed by the country's
general economic slowdown, which has resulted in sharply
smaller advertising budgets for magazines and other media.</p>
