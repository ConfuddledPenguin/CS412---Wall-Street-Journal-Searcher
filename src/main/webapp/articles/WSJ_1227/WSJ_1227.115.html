	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- The Census Bureau added 3.8 million more
people to its 1990 headcount, but critics continue to
complain that the bureau is missing millions more.
   The bureau said yesterday that its almost-final tally from
the 1990 census is 249,632,692 people, 10.2% more than the
1980 census found.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The addition of 3.8 million people to the preliminary
total released this summer reflects 2.9 million residents the
bureau missed the first time as well as the anticipated
922,819 military and other federal employees and dependents
overseas.</p>
<p>Under the Constitution, the new headcount will result in a
shift of 19 seats in the U.S. House of Representatives.</p>
<p>California is the big winner, adding seven seats to give
it 52 representatives, or nearly 12% of all the seats in the
435-member House. New York is the big loser. It will lose
three seats and end up with 31 seats after the 1992 election.</p>
<p>The 1990 tally includes military and other federal workers
and dependents living overseas. The 1980 tally didn't.
Excluding those people, the resident population of the U.S.
grew by 9.8% during the 1980s, Census Bureau Director Barbara
Bryant said.</p>
<p>The bureau may yet make additional adjustments to the
tally. Under terms of an out-of-court settlement of a lawsuit
brought by New York City and others who argued that the
census disproportionately misses minorities, the Commerce
Department must decide by July 15 whether to adjust the
tallies statistically to compensate for the undercount.
Commerce Undersecretary Michael Darby yesterday called the
1990 census "full, fair and efficient."</p>
<p>But congressional skepticism persists. "It's not a
question of whether we have counted everyone. The census
never does," said Rep. Thomas Sawyer (D., Ohio), chairman of
the House census subcommittee. "The question is how close
they've come to the truth."</p>
<p>New York State Attorney General Robert Abrams, among those
suing the bureau, was quick to complain that the 1990 census
still undercounted his state. "When large segments of our
residents are left out of the political process, democracy is
devalued for all of us," he said.</p>
<p>Additions to the preliminary tally reflect, among other
things, recanvassing of a substantial number of housing units
by census enumerators. With aid from state and local
governments, the bureau also identified about 125,000 housing
units it had missed. It also turned up an extra 400,000
people from parole records, Mrs. Bryant said recently.</p>
<p>Mr. Darby noted that the new tally is "surprisingly close"
to earlier projections that the census would find a
population of 250 million. But Rep. Sawyer noted that the
249.6 million total is still substantially shy of the
bureau's recent projections, based on demographic data, of
253.4 million.</p>
<p>The 1990 census confirms trends identified in earlier
reports, such as the rapid growth of the western states. "The
West is the big population gainer," Mrs. Bryant said. In the
past decade, the population of the West has grown by 22%,
while the South grew by 13.5%, the Northeast by 3.4%, and the
Midwest by 1.3%.</p>
<p>The reassignment of seats in the House reflects these
trends, with the West and Sunbelt states gaining at the
expense of the big industrial states of the Northeast and
Midwest. In addition to California, states adding seats
include Florida, which gains four seats; Texas, which gains
three seats; and Arizona, Georgia, North Carolina, Virginia
and Washington, which each gain one seat.</p>
<p>Besides New York, states losing seats include Illinois,
Michigan, Ohio and Pennsylvania, which each lose two seats;
and Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Massachusetts,
Montana, New Jersey and West Virginia, which each lose one
seat.</p>
<p>None of these shifts comes as a surprise, however. Earlier
bureau reports on the 1990 count pointed to all of them.</p>
<p>The figures may provide new ammunition for the District of
Columbia's perennially unsuccessful campaign for statehood.
Although the census found that the district lost population
during the 1980s, it still is larger than either Vermont,
Alaska or Wyoming. Yet the district hasn't any seats in the
Senate, and its one representative in the House can't vote.</p>
<p>The bureau also noted yesterday that four states lost
population in the 1980s. They are Iowa, North Dakota, West
Virginia and Wyoming.</p>
