	<p class="article-leader">DAMMAM, Saudi Arabia -- For air-conditioner salesmen along
the Persian Gulf, August normally is the cruelest month.
Despite the heat, there's no business because summer is
almost over.
   This past August was different. The U.S. military swooped
in, needing machines to cool acres of tents. Then some
250,000 Kuwaitis arrived, many seeking temporary quarters
that had to be air conditioned. Finally, the trade embargo
shut down competitors in Iraq and Kuwait. Saudi merchants
such as Ahmad Al-Zamil, who owns a group of air-conditioner
companies with his 11 brothers, couldn't be happier. Building
contractors and vendors of other products who are cashing in
on the crisis feel the exact same way.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"We were always ready for this," says Mr. Al-Zamil.</p>
<p>The Saudi government estimates that local merchants are
providing $1.2 billion a month worth of "host nation support"
for U.S. and allied troops in the Gulf. The business comes as
a huge relief to the merchants, who had just seen the end of
the multibillion dollar building boom of the 1980s that
transformed Saudi cities from desert towns to places that now
resemble chunks of Los Angeles. They now faced empty
construction camps, fleets of unused trucks, vacant port
facilities and lots of "excess capacity" in plants like
Al-Zamil Refrigeration Industries.</p>
<p>According to Maj. Gen. Gus Pagonis, head of the U.S.
logistics operation here, the sharp slump in the Saudi
building boom was a key factor in President Bush's hasty
decision to send in combat units without combat supplies in
August. "We knew the bases, the ports, the flatbeds (trucks)
were here," he says. "They've overbuilt, so then the question
is what do you send in first? You send in the troops."</p>
<p>Unlike Korea and Vietnam, the Americans were landing in a
country where the host had a big checkbook. Gen. Pagonis and
his team of contracting officers needed contractors who could
provide large quantities of food, water, fuel, transportation
and leases for bases. They appeared and the Saudis paid them.</p>
<p>Within a few days, a huge fleet of flatbed trucks that
once carried bulldozers to construction sites was on the
freeways carrying U.S. tanks to the front. "If they didn't
get help from Saudi Arabia, they'd still be sitting with
their supplies on the beach," says Abdul Rahim Al-Rashed,
director of a local building supply company, which happened
to have a nearly empty construction camp complete with
barracks and kitchens for 4,000 workers.</p>
<p>The Al-Rashed camp, which was last used to build a modern
sewer system for Dammam, is now "Superleg City," the main
U.S. logistics operation. The building where concrete pipes
were made is now the home of the Army's M-1945 portable
bakery that pumps out 2,000 loaves of white bread and raisin
bread a day.</p>
<p>The former building supply storage area now features Sgt.
Steven Price's laundry, which is struggling to provide a
weekly fresh change of clothes for the troopers of the 82nd
Airborne Division. "If a soldier out there is going to be
dirty and stink, his morale isn't going to be worth nothing,"
observes Sgt. Price.</p>
<p>A. Salman Almatrood knows about dirty troops. Back in the
late 1940s, when U.S. airmen converted a nearby airfield into
a strategic bomber base, he was one of the 12-year-old Saudi
boys who used to scramble for their business. He'd wash their
uniforms in an aluminum tub.</p>
<p>Now he owns a gleaming new laundry, built just down the
road. He has plenty of excess capacity, but, so far, other
competitors for the dusty uniform business have underbid him.
Noting that there are 150,000 more troops on the way, he says
he is content to wait: "I know one thing, there is not going
to be enough capacity to do laundry for the whole Army."</p>
<p>The first American troops arriving outran both the Saudi
and the U.S. support systems. Capt. Lou Boone of the 82nd
Airborne recalls one of his first Saudi meals. It was a sack
with two burgers, large french fries and an apple pie
garnered by supply sergeants from a local Hardee's. (The
Saudis, according to Gen. Pagonis, have since reimbursed the
U.S. Treasury for $680 million worth of initial supplies the
U.S. purchased before local support kicked in.)</p>
<p>Ragi Abouhaidar, regional director for the Saudi Catering
and Contracting Co., remembers the first Air Force crews to
arrive. "It was very difficult because they wanted everything
and they had nothing and everything they had to have was
needed on the same day," he says.</p>
<p>Saudi Catering, whose cooks fed Korean, Indian, Pakistani
and Thai laborers at 120 locations all over Saudi Arabia,
swung into action. The company, which is owned by an uncle of
King Fahd, managed by Lebanese, and operated by a small
United Nations of 4,000 employees, is still scrambling,
importing chicken from France, lamb from New Zealand and
hamburger makings from the U.S.</p>
<p>Saudi money, and Napoleon's maxim that an army marches on
its stomach, is what drives Saudi Catering on. "Can you
imagine," asks Mr. Abouhaidar, "if we went to the troops and
said, `I'm sorry, we can't feed you today, gentlemen'?"</p>
