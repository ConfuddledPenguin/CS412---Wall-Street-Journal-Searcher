	<p class="article-leader">A small-business executive hopes to save low-cost,
American-made cameras from extinction; unscrupulous
storekeepers cheat electronics consumers; a small firm banks
on a windfall, thanks to Saddam Hussein.
   Subjects such as these -- covered by The Wall Street
Journal during 1990 -- illustrate the trials and triumphs of
entrepreneurs.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>With 1991 approaching, reporters made progress reports on
some of the people and companies featured this year. Here are
their findings:</p>
<p>FOR KEYSTONE CAMERA, the financial picture has gotten
bleaker.</p>
<p>In July, Keystone Camera Products Corp., Clifton, N.J.,
was struggling to remain the last U.S. maker of under-$50
cameras. Besieged by price-cutting competitors in Asia,
Keystone had reported losses for five consecutive years and
defaulted on its loans.</p>
<p>"Everyone else said we were finished," says Myron Berman,
chairman of Keystone since last January. Since July, the
company has introduced two cameras designed to hold down
costs. Where Keystone's old lines were selling at break-even,
Mr. Berman says profit margins on the new cameras should run
30% or more. But despite concessions from lenders and
suppliers, Mr. Berman still needs to raise $5 million to
shore up the company's finances.</p>
<p>He and a partner already have invested $15 million in
Keystone, which reported a net loss of $2 million for the
third quarter. "We'd put in more," Mr. Berman says, "but
that's all we've got."</p>

<p>STORM CLOUDS in the Gulf are aiding Survival Technology
Inc.</p>
<p>In August, the Bethesda, Md., company, the sole U.S. maker
of battlefield antidote kits to counter nerve gas, was
looking for a windfall in the Middle East. Almost overnight,
the Pentagon doubled a $1 million order.</p>
<p>Since August, the Defense Department has ordered $16.6
million of the company's nerve-gas antidote kits. Meanwhile,
the company's sales of nonmilitary products have also
increased. The company's St. Louis manufacturing plant is now
running around-the-clock six days a week.</p>
<p>Although the company recorded a $361,000 net loss for the
fiscal year ended July 31, its operations had turned
profitable even before the surge in orders. Now Survival
Technology expects to be profitable for fiscal 1991, says
James H. Miller, chief executive officer.</p>

<p>A PUBLIC OFFERING for American Waste Services Inc. got off
the scrap heap.</p>
<p>In late September, investors were balking at the
Youngstown, Ohio, waste-disposal company's lofty plans to go
public at $14 to $17 a share. Investors worried about the
lackluster stock market, the poor performance of other
waste-related stocks, and American Waste's sought-after
multiple: some 100 times 1989 pro-forma share earnings.</p>
<p>But American Waste did go public in October, through
underwriters led by Goldman, Sachs & Co., selling six million
shares at $10 each. While that was a sharp drop from the
initial expectations, pre-existing shareholders weren't
complaining. "The offering went fine, and the company's
moving along real well," says Oliver Nicklin, president of
First Analysis Corp., a Chicago investment firm that had
bought American Waste shares at $1.04, on average. The shares
closed unchanged yesterday in New York Stock Exchange
composite trading at $11.75.</p>

<p>THAT'S NOT SANTA visiting these ripoff retailers of
electronics in New York City.</p>
<p>It's Mark Green, the city's commissioner of consumer
affairs, who says he's intensifying a crackdown announced in
July against unscrupulous stores. According to this
newspaper's October report, the city has been fighting a
losing battle against such stores for decades.</p>
<p>But this month, Mr. Green ordered a two-day enforcement
sweep. Nine stores were charged with illegally
misrepresenting used items as new; five others were charged
with using illegal sales tactics, such as "bait-and-switch"
schemes. Those five each face fines of more than $50,000.
Several of the companies declined to comment on the charges;
others couldn't be reached. At one concern, a manager hung up
on a reporter seeking a statement.</p>
<p>Says Mr. Green, "We're making a list and checking it
twice, for electronic stores who haven't been nice."</p>

<p>MOVIEFONE IS RINGING coast to coast, despite problems that
almost put the service on hold.</p>
<p>Los Angeles entrepreneur J. Russell Leatherman, 28 years
old, and his partners in PromoFone Inc. found themselves
battling with the Los Angeles Times last year when it refused
to carry ads for their new phone-in theater guide, in part
because it competed with the newspaper for movie ads.</p>
<p>After some wrangling with the Times, the partners turned
to such alternatives as billboards, bus cards and
cross-promotions with a local radio station to plug their
777-FILM line, called MovieFone. The strategy worked, and the
service has since expanded to the New York area, San
Francisco, Boston and Miami. MovieFone gets between 130,000
and 150,000 calls a week now, up from just 30,000 a year ago.</p>
<p>The partners are selling 15-second commercial spots on the
phone line; among the takers are Walt Disney Co., Twentieth
Century Fox and Columbia Pictures. "We're sold out for most
of next year," Mr. Leatherman says. In addition, the studios
have been buying demographic information that the service
collects from callers. All of which helped PromoFone reap
$1.5 million in revenue in 1990. Mr. Leatherman hopes to see
the first profits on his company's $2.5 million investment in
the next two to three years.</p>

<p>FOR THESE NURSES, moves into their own businesses are
paying off.</p>
<p>Laura Gasparis Vonfrolio -- one of seven
nurse-entrepreneurs covered in an August article -- has
stepped up her attack on the medical establishment. She has
just put on sale "Nurse Abuse," a new book of essays on
nurses' grievances.</p>
<p>She's also planning a quarterly magazine named Revolution:
the Journal of Nurse Empowerment. A regular feature will be
the War Stories section, with nurses recounting the outrages
committed against them by doctors and hospital
administrators. "We'll have an analysis of each story by a
nurse-psychiatrist, a nurse-lawyer and a pro-nurse
administrator -- if we can find one," she says.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, inventor Nancy Gorski, a former operating-room
nurse, is in an exultant mood. Her 11 years of
entrepreneurial toil will pay off in a big way in January,
she says. The disposable latex sheath that her Gorsk Inc.
developed for anesthesiologists' laryngoscope blades will
finally hit the market. More important, she will sign a
contract giving multinational rights to sell a special
receptacle she designed for discarded surgical sponges. She
says her royalties are expected to total several hundred
thousand dollars next year. She adds: "Suddenly, I'm a hot
item. Isn't that great?"</p>
