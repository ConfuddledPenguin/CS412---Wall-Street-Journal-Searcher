	<p class="article-leader">Investors are often cautioned to beware of strangers
trying to sell them securities over the telephone.
   But the same warning goes for investors who receive phone
calls from dealers offering to buy bonds they already own.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The dealer may be trying to buy the bonds at cut-rate
prices to resell directly to the issuer at higher prices.</p>
<p>Even if the dealer is offering what may initially sound
like an attractive price, several bond-market specialists
advise against leaping at the offer. With a little bit of
detective work and comparison shopping, savvy investors may
be able to do even better.</p>
<p>Bond issuers often need to buy back some of their bonds to
fulfill what is known as a "sinking-fund" requirement. This
refers to a provision in the fine print of many municipal and
corporate bonds requiring or permitting issuers to buy back
some of their bonds at specified intervals before the final
maturity date.</p>
<p>The risk for unwary investors was brought into sharper
focus by recent charges that a former state-agency official
in Kentucky and his father profited from "misuse of
confidential information" relating to a sinking-fund program.
Several bond specialists say the case involves what are
probably the first indictments charging insider-trading in
municipal bonds.</p>
<p>The two men, Noble Donald Morse II, who was
secretary-treasurer of Kentucky's Infrastructure Authority,
and his father, Donald Morse, are accused of making about
$7,000 by buying bonds they knew could be resold to the
authority at higher prices. They were indicted by a grand
jury under a state law in late October.</p>
<p>The Morses have pleaded not guilty. J. Guthrie True, a
lawyer representing them, says a motion has been filed to
dismiss the charges. He says the Kentucky statute is
"unconstitutionally vague, because it fails to define what
constitutes confidential information."</p>
<p>Typically, issuers subject to mandatory sinking-fund
requirements have a choice of ways to meet them. Often, they
can redeem a certain amount of bonds at a specified price --
such as "par," or the bond's face value -- with holders drawn
by lot. Or they can try to buy enough of their bonds in the
resale market, at lower prices, to fulfill the requirement.</p>
<p>Several municipalities and companies hire specialists to
contact bondholders directly. The firm writes letters
summarizing the sinking-fund requirement and asks holders if
they would be interested in selling, and, if so, to specify a
price. After the bids come in, the lowest prices are
accepted, usually up to the limit of the sinking-fund
requirement -- although sometimes the agency can buy even
more than that.</p>
<p>For example, Fiduciary Communications Co. of New York says
it is working on a sinking-fund retirement program for
several issues of New Jersey's Housing Finance Agency, which
subsequently merged with another agency to become the New
Jersey Housing and Mortgage Finance Agency. About 2,000
bondholders soon will receive letters asking if they want to
sell, and at what price. The letters also will give an 800
number for holders to call.</p>
<p>Fiduciary recently handled a sinking-fund retirement
program for Kansas City, Mo., special facility airport
revenue bonds issued to help finance a facility for Trans
World Airlines. It received 211 tender offers, of which 167
came from individuals, says Amy Winchell, a vice president of
Fiduciary.</p>
<p>Large brokerage houses often get involved with
sinking-fund redemptions, too. Usually they act
independently, trying to make a profit for themselves by
contacting large institutions and individual holders to buy
back bonds to resell to issuers.</p>
<p>What should investors do if they get a call from someone
offering to buy their bonds? First, several traders say, ask
the callers why they want the bonds so badly and whether it's
because of a sinking-fund requirement.</p>
<p>Frank Scaraggi, an executive vice president at Lehman
Brothers, advises: "Ask whoever is giving you the bid, `Are
you buying these for an active sinker,' that is, for an
issuer that is satisfying a sinking-fund requirement. Then
ask for more information, and any reputable broker should
give you more, including what they think the sinker will
pay."</p>
<p>Even if the offer still sounds good, don't stop there, Mr.
Scaraggi and many others suggest. Investors should check the
fairness of the price by calling at least two other firms
they trust. Prices often vary widely from one firm to
another, especially on municipal bonds -- and especially for
trades of $25,000 or less.</p>
<p>Ask for any research reports the firms have on the issuer,
and whether the issuer's credit ratings have changed since
the bonds were issued; these factors can greatly affect the
price. Also check the prospectus or official statement for
details of the bond's sinking-fund requirements.</p>
<p>In some cases, large bondholders may be able to get more
information by contacting the issuer directly. Some
treasurers say they are willing to explain the intricacies of
their sinking-fund requirements to bondholders -- and even to
steer them to major market-makers in those bonds.</p>
<p>"The last thing we want to have is a situation where
someone thinks there's no secondary market" for the bonds,
says the treasurer of one municipal agency. On rare
occasions, he says, the agency might even agree to buy back
bonds directly from investors holding large blocks, typically
$100,000 or more.</p>
<p>Investors who don't want to worry about the intricacies of
sinkers can buy shares of mutual funds and let fund managers
worry about it. Or they can stick to buying U.S. Treasury
bills, notes and bonds, which don't have sinking funds.</p>
