Transport stock.
   Builders, located in Camden, S.C., is a trucking-services
holding company. Mr. Gay holds a 5.2% stake in the company.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission,
Mr. Gay said that in the Nov. 30 letter the board said that
it may wish to reconsider the issue if Mr. Gay's holdings
draw near the 15% threshold.</p>

Walentas, the chairman of Builders Transport, asking that the
board reconsider his request. Mr. Gay states that "as a
concerned stockholder of BTI, I am of course concerned that
the board act in the best interest of all stockholders."</p>
