	<p class="article-leader">CLEVELAND -- Ameritrust Corp. said construction on its
60-story downtown headquarters will be delayed. The
developer, Jacobs, Visconsi & Jacobs Co., said it asked the
bank holding company for the delay due to uncertain economic
conditions.
   The office tower, which will include a 484-room Hyatt
Regency Hotel, was expected to open in 1994. Revised
projections call for construction to begin in 1993, and it's
to be completed in 1996.</p>
