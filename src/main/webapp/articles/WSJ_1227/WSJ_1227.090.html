	<p class="article-leader">Itoman & Co., a Japanese trading company troubled with
huge investments in real estate, said it agreed to sell its
88.22% stake in Itoman Total Housing Corp. to two real estate
companies affiliated with Sumitomo Bank Ltd.
   A spokesman for Itoman said Sogo Real Estate Co. and
Ohtemachi Tatemono K.K. will pay a total of nine billion yen
($66 million) for the stake.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The move is part of Itoman's previously announced program
to cut its property-investment debts, estimated in the fall
at 876 billion yen.</p>
<p>In 1988, Itoman bought the stake in Itoman Total Housing,
then called Sugiyama & Co., at the request of Sumitomo Bank.
Sumitomo and Itoman have had close ties since 1975 when
Sumitomo sent its former managing director to run the
troubled trading company.</p>
<p>The latest agreement also calls for Itoman and seven other
affiliated firms to sell some of their properties to Itoman
Total Housing. The accord will help Itoman reduce its debts
on a consolidated basis by 192.2 billion yen, according to
the Itoman spokesman.</p>
<p>But the prospects for Itoman's turnaround are believed to
be clouded, due to the deteriorating Japanese real estate
market. In November, Sumitomo Bank said it was sending a
rescue team to try to help Itoman through its problems.</p>
