	<p class="article-leader">HOUSTON -- Pennzoil Co. said it raised its stake in
Chevron Corp. to 9.4% from 9% and has received a ruling from
the Internal Revenue Service that would enable it to buy more
shares through May 31 if it chooses.
   Both Pennzoil and Chevron, based in San Francisco, are oil
companies.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>In a Securities and Exchange Commission filing, Pennzoil
said it acquired an additional 1.3 million Chevron shares for
$89 million as of yesterday. Pennzoil began making its latest
purchases on Dec. 3, right after the Federal Trade Commission
said it would allow Pennzoil to acquire more.</p>
<p>In its previous government filings, Pennzoil said it would
use the $2.6 billion of proceeds from its 1988 legal
settlement with Texaco Inc. to buy just under 10% of
Chevron's shares. The 10% threshold triggers a variety of
Chevron's anti-takeover provisions. To date, Pennzoil has
spent about $2.2 billion amassing its Chevron stake.</p>
<p>Pennzoil's settlement with Texaco ended four years of
litigation in which a court found that Texaco had improperly
interfered with Pennzoil's acquisition of a portion of Getty.</p>
<p>For the latest purchases, Pennzoil paid an average price
of $69.75 a share.</p>
<p>Chevron closed yesterday at $73.25, up $2, in New York
Stock Exchange composite trading. Pennzoil finished at $65,
up $1.375, also on the Big Board.</p>
<p>Pennzoil said the IRS on Monday granted a company request
extending the time for investment of the Texaco settlement
under a tax theory Pennzoil hopes will allow it to delay
taxes on the money. A Pennzoil spokesman said it asked for
the extension "because of delays in obtaining clearance from
the FTC for the purchases." The period was to expire at year
end but now will continue to May 31.</p>
<p>Pennzoil seeks to qualify its Chevron investment as
property "similar or related in service or use to" the
contractual interest it had in Getty Oil Co. That agreement
was the subject of Pennzoil's litigation with Texaco. On
Pennzoil's tax returns, the company has been treating the
Texaco settlement proceeds as compensation for the
involuntary conversion of property. Under Pennzoil's tax
theory, so far untested, such proceeds would be excludable
from taxable income if they're used to acquire property
similar or related to its interest in Getty.</p>
<p>In its SEC filing, Pennzoil said its tax position "will be
subject to review by the IRS in due course." The company
spokesman declined to comment on whether Pennzoil views the
IRS extension as an indication that the agency would also
regard Pennzoil's tax plan favorably.</p>
<p>Pennzoil accumulated the bulk of its Chevron shares in
1989 and has described its stake as "a long-term investment,"
maintaining it doesn't want to take over the company. But
Chevron has alleged in a number of court actions that
Pennzoil misstated its intentions and may try to take over
the company. So far Chevron hasn't received any support from
the courts.</p>
