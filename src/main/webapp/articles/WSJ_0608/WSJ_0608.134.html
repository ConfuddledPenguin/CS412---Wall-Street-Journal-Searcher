	<p class="article-leader">FAIRFIELD, Conn. -- Barry Blau & Partners Inc., a direct
response advertising agency, said it will restate its
financial results for certain prior years as a result of "an
understanding" with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
   The adjustments, of an unspecified amount, involve
deferred compensation aspects of a 1984 employment agreement
with Barry Blau, the company's chief executive officer. In
addition, the company will accelerate in prior years the
write-off of certain deferred costs.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The company said the restatement won't "materially affect"
stockholders' equity as of March 31. The company said the
vested portion of the deferred compensation agreement has
been waived by Mr. Blau and has been contributed back into
the company as capital; the other deferred costs had been
treated as expense as of March 31.</p>
<p>Fred Kaseff, chief financial officer, said the restatement
would include the financial results for the nine months ended
March 31, when the company reported net income of $69,839 or
4 cents a share, on revenue of $45.4 million.</p>
<p>The company also said that, apart from the accounting
issues, it anticipates that over the near term, earnings will
suffer "due to budget reductions and program cutbacks at
certain clients." Mr. Kaseff declined to elaborate.</p>
<p>The company has been reviewing a number of accounting
issues raised by its former accountants Coopers & Lybrand in
the 10-Q report for the three months ended Dec. 31. At that
time, the accounting firm said it believed certain prior-year
results should be restated, and that its report on the fiscal
year ended last June 30 shouldn't be relied upon.</p>
<p>Subsequently, the company's board hired accounting firm
BDO Seidman to analyze the accounting issues. The company
said it decided to restate its figures on the basis of
consultations between the company, BDO Seidman and the SEC
staff.</p>
