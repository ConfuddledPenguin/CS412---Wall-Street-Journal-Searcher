	<p class="article-leader">REP. JAMIE WHITTEN: Are you aware of any agreement, any
assurance, by yourself or anyone else in high government
office, to Khrushchev that if he would withdraw at the time
under the conditions that you showed us, the U.S. would
thereby commit itself to any particular course of action?
   SECRETARY OF DEFENSE ROBERT MCNAMARA: I am not only
unaware of any agreement, it is inconceivable to me that our
President would enter into a discussion of any such
agreement. Moreover, there were absolutely no undisclosed
agreements associated with the withdrawal of the Soviet
missiles from Cuba.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>In a recent book, McGeorge Bundy calls Mr. McNamara's
premeditated lie to a congressional committee "most justified
deception." The country eventually learned that President
Kennedy had agreed to remove Jupiter missiles from Turkey in
exchange for the Soviets ending the missile crisis. "There
certainly would have been criticism from hardliners in the
U.S.," Mr. Bundy wrote, but "the assurance itself and the
secrecy with which we surrounded it were justified."</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>Justified or not, no independent counsel ever prosecuted
Mr. McNamara. John Poindexter is not so lucky. On Monday,
Judge Harold Greene must decide his proper punishment. Mr.
Poindexter was not charged with any understandable crime --
Independent Counsel Lawrence Walsh didn't allege that the
diversion of Iran arms sales to the Contras broke any law --
but with conspiracy and misleading and obstructing Congress.
For this he could get 25 years and a $1.25 million fine.</p>
<p>Judge Greene may feel under some pressure to make Mr.
Poindexter the first Iran-Contra defendant sent to jail. On
the other hand, as the AT&T judge who oversees the U.S.
telecommunications industry, Judge Greene hardly needs to
prove that he is energetic. But to imprison Mr. Poindexter
would most certainly align the federal judiciary on the side
of congressional criminalizing of policy differences with the
executive branch.</p>
<p>Independent Counsel Lawrence Walsh, who has so far spent
more than $28 million, has filed papers demanding that Mr.
Poindexter go to jail. "If, as occurred in this case,
high-ranking officials of one branch of government feel free
to feed the other branch a diet of lies," Mr. Walsh wrote in
high dudgeon, "then the constitutional system will surely
sicken and, eventually, die."</p>
<p>Mr. Walsh didn't show any such concern about lying by his
clients, the Members of Congress who created his job and to
whom he must report. While Judge Greene required former
President Reagan to testify, he upheld the prosecutor's
objection to the Poindexter request that some 65 Members of
Congress and their staffers testify about what they knew
about Iran-Contra and when they knew it. In so doing, Judge
Greene accepted Mr. Walsh's argument that it was irrelevant
to argue that Members of Congress lied when they said they
were misled about Oliver North's work for the Contras.</p>
<p>Mr. Poindexter testified to Congress that the executive
branch was abiding by the letter and spirit of the Boland
amendments. His meaning was clear to everyone. Congress had
voted down bills that would have barred all U.S. government
aid to the Contras. The Boland compromise was that the CIA
and other agencies were prohibited from using appropriated
funds to help the Contras, but the White House and its
National Security Council could strive to keep the Contras
alive. As President Reagan testified, he would have sent a
similar letter to Congress except that "If I had written it
myself, I might have used a little profanity."</p>
<p>A National Security Agency staffer testified in the
Poindexter case that there were several secret congressional
briefings during the Boland period about executive-branch aid
to the Contras. Still, Rep. Lee Hamilton testified that
Boland was drafted to cover Mr. North. We don't think Mr.
McNamara, Mr. Poindexter or Members of Congress should go to
jail for these kinds of misleading statements. Does anyone
think we should have indicted Members of Congress who failed
to deliver on promised spending cuts after President Reagan
raised some taxes early in his term? Should we criminalize
assurances by Congressmen that the pending "civil rights"
bill won't create quotas? In our system, voters not jurors
decide when officials need to be punished for their policies.</p>
<p>So what is suitable punishment for Mr. Poindexter? Mr.
North was fined and sentenced to community service fighting
drugs in Washington. How about sentencing Mr. Poindexter to
community service lecturing on separation of powers to the
new democratic government in Nicaragua that he did so much to
make possible.</p>
