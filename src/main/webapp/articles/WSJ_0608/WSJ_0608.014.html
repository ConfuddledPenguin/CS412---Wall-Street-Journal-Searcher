	<p class="article-leader">SAN FRANCISCO -- The last time the International Monetary
Conference held its annual meeting here, in 1976, 56 U.S.
banks were members. Now, 35 are.
   In his opening remarks this week to top executives from
the industrial world's leading banks, Rainer Gut, chairman of
Credit Suisse, made a second telling -- and, to Americans,
disturbing -- observation: In 1976, seven of those banks
hailed from California; but now, "three of those are owned by
the Japanese and one has withdrawn from international
business."</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Douglas Kidd, a senior vice president at Bankers Trust Co.
in New York, said that "a major part of our growth over the
past five years has been overseas" because of constraints on
what the bank can do in the U.S. "You have our taxes moving
offshore and our employees moving offshore," he said.</p>
<p>Nobody in the room needed to be reminded that U.S. banks
aren't as competitive as they used to be. In the past few
years, many have retreated from international business, or
sold operations to meet new international capital
requirements, and watched foreign banks gobble up an
ever-increasing chunk of the U.S. market.</p>
<p>This trend threatens to damage the competitiveness of U.S.
industry -- especially the export sector -- and erodes
revenue in industries that serve banks, such as computer
companies, according to analysts and bankers. It also means
fewer jobs.</p>
<p>Moreover, the growing foreign presence in the U.S. raises
concerns about the concentration of economic and financial
power, especially in terms of doling out credit to U.S.
industries and companies that compete with foreign ones.</p>
<p>U.S. offices of foreign banks now control roughly a
quarter of U.S. banking assets -- Japanese owners alone
account for 14% -- compared with 14% foreign control in 1982
and 3.8% in 1973. The consolidated U.S. assets of six
Japanese banks would rank them among the 30 largest U.S. bank
holding companies, and "a couple would be within striking
distance of the 10th largest banking organization in the
U.S.," according to a study by the Federal Reserve Bank of
New York.</p>
<p>At the same time, U.S. banks are shedding businesses
either to help stay afloat or to meet international capital
standards planned for 1992. In the past few years, Chase
Manhattan Bank sold a Dutch bank with $5 billion of assets to
France's Credit Lyonnais, and BankAmerica Corp. sold its
Italian bank to Germany's Deutsche Bank AG. Just last week,
Bank of Tokyo Ltd. closed its $500 million purchase of Bank
of New England Corp.'s leasing unit.</p>
<p>Noting that U.S. banks are unloading operations in Asia as
well as in Europe, Alexis Wolkenstein, head of the
international division of Credit Lyonnais said, "I don't
understand the American banks; they are giving up markets and
relationships that took years to build." He added: "This is a
loss to the U.S.; it gives it less influence in the world."</p>
<p>At home, U.S. banks suffer from excess capacity -- there
are simply too many banks -- as well as from geographic
limits on where they can take deposits and restrictions on
what products they can sell. U.S. banks also have shot
themselves in the foot, lending billions of dollars to
developing countries that may never be able to repay them and
lending too much to the real estate and oil industries in the
U.S.</p>
<p>John Reed, chairman of Citicorp, said the company wanted
the right to take deposits anywhere in the U.S., in addition
to securities powers and possibly the right to underwrite and
sell insurance. "Clearly, the geography thing killed us, and
the degree to which industrial companies are in our
business," Mr. Reed said. "It takes a lot of banking business
away from us."</p>
<p>Charles S. Sanford Jr., chairman of Bankers Trust, said,
"Not having securities powers makes U.S. banks less
competitive with European banks, and this will be exacerbated
when Japanese banks get more powers."</p>
<p>Meanwhile, 15 years of unsteady economic growth and
volatility in the inflation rate in the U.S., plus the
nation's deteriorating trade position and its low savings
rate "have all contributed to a financial environment that
breeds difficulties at home and contributes to slippage
abroad," E. Gerald Corrigan, president of the New York Fed,
said in recent congressional testimony.</p>
<p>In the Far East, U.S. banks face rich, aggressive Japanese
banks; in Europe, powerful banking institutions are allowed
to enter businesses in their home markets -- such as
investment banking and insurance -- that are denied to U.S.
banks in their own markets. Europe's big banks also stand to
gain from the planned 1992 abolition of trade and financial
barriers among the 12 countries of the European Community.</p>
<p>The turmoil in the Japanese stock and bond markets this
year resulted in lower earnings for Japanese banks and chewed
up some capital represented by stock they hold in Japanese
companies. But Kaneo Nakamura, president of Industrial Bank
of Japan Ltd., and Teruyoshi Yasufuku, deputy president of
Sanwa Bank Ltd., both said that talk of a pullback by Japan's
big banks was exaggerated. "The markets {in Japan} have
improved, and the {Japanese} economy is strong," Mr. Yasufuku
said.</p>
<p>"It will still be several years until Japanese banks'
advantages in cost of equity and borrowed funds dissipates,"
said Perry Quick, a principal at Quick, Finan & Associates,
an economic consulting firm in Washington.</p>
<p>And while U.S. banks still are regarded as leaders in
financial innovation and sophistication, "our lead in
technology is narrowing," he said. "Japan is developing its
own financial technology or buying it."</p>
<p>U.S. banks are also considered to be more profitable than
many of their foreign competitors. Nonetheless, Mr. Reed of
Citicorp said that neither the West German nor the Japanese
stock markets penalize their banks for their low
profitability. By contrast, the shares of many U.S. banks
have been severely depressed.</p>
<p>The West German banking system, said Hans-Georg Engel,
resident counsel at J.P. Morgan & Co.'s Frankfurt branch, is
one of the world's strongest. Because its big universal banks
can bank anywhere in the country, and can trade stocks and
bonds and sell insurance, "they are less exposed to cyclical
shocks," he said. "The universal banks are well-capitalized,
have good asset quality, weren't hurt by the stock market
crash in 1987 and have absorbed their LDC {less developed
country, or Third World lending} problems."</p>
<p>In his testimony, Mr. Corrigan of the New York Fed said
that the U.S. is "the only major country that does not have a
true national banking system." Even after the planned
dismantling of some barriers to interstate banking, he said,
the U.S. will still be left with a "crazy-quilt pattern" of
state and federal laws and regulations.</p>
<p>Structurally, the U.S. banking system is increasingly
viewed as obsolete, especially when rapid technological
change is creating instruments that blur traditional product
lines. Moreover, many corporations whose credit ratings are
higher than those of banks now can raise money through bond
and stock markets, bypassing U.S. banks altogether.</p>
<p>"Financial services have become commodities available from
a number of differing bank and non-bank sources, and
distinctions between products have faded," said Cynthia
Glassman, director of research for Furash & Co., a consulting
firm in Washington.</p>
<p>Noting that a European corporation can have all its
financial needs met by a single institution, she said: "A
U.S. company has to go different places for a loan,
underwriting and insurance. The difference is like buying a
car and buying the parts separately to build the car."</p>
<p>Mr. Engel of Morgan said: "If a Volkswagen, a Lufthansa or
a BASF asks you to do for it in America what you do for it in
Europe, you're forced to say you can't, even though it's your
home market, your currency and the world's major currency.
That has a tremendous impact on the competitiveness of U.S.
banks."</p>
<p>As Mr. Corrigan himself testified last month: "The U.S.
banking system is simply out of step with the rest of the
world, and more importantly, it is out of step with the
realities of the marketplace."</p>
