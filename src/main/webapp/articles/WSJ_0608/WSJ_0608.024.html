	<p class="article-leader">As the author of language in the House oil-spill bill to
require double hulls on all tankers operating in U.S. waters
within 15 years, I take great exception to your May 7
editorial "Double Whammy."
   Your use of phrases such as "dubious" technology, "popular
quick fix" and "an expensive way for Congress to show it is
doing something" is misleading and incorrect.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>You ignore the large and ever-growing body of evidence
that a double hull is the most effective available technology
to prevent many spills and reduce the damage from others. The
Coast Guard says that of five recent major spills, four,
including the California spill caused by the vessel's own
anchor, would have been prevented if the vessels had been
constructed with double hulls; it also said the spill from
the Exxon Valdez accident would have been reduced 60% with a
double hull.</p>
<p>Calculated over the lifetime of a tanker, the added cost
of double-hull construction is one-tenth of one cent per
gallon.</p>
<p>If, in fact, the value of double hulls is still in doubt,
why do we currently require them on ships carrying liquified
natural gas and other hazardous materials?</p>
<p>The House supported my double-hull requirement 376-37; a
similar requirement in the Senate fell two votes short.</p>
<p>We have a window of opportunity now that we will not have
again for more than two decades. By 1992, more than 40% of
the current world fleet will be more than 20 years old, and
another 25% will be in the 15-to-19-year-old range. In the
Alaskan fleet, the average age is 18 years.</p>
<p>We will lose a valuable opportunity to increase safety at
a reasonable cost if we wait for additional studies that are
likely to confirm what we already know -- that double hulls
prevent accidents.</p>

<p>---</p>
<p>You stated that tanker double bottoms may not prevent
every oil spill, yet for many years hazardous cargoes have
been required to be carried in double-bottom or double-hull
ships. In fact, with few exceptions, all ships carrying
products other than petroleum have double bottoms. Also,
there is little evidence to suggest that ship-stability
problems are aggravated by double hulls or double bottoms.</p>
<p>The Exxon Valdez disaster was an extraordinary occurrence
and, as you point out, oil would still have been spilled even
if the ship had been fitted with a double bottom/double hull.
However, if the ship had been designed and built with a
double hull or bottom, the oil spilled would have been
reduced in quantity and flow, thereby aiding in the cleanup.
The reality is that normal collisions and groundings of
single-hull tankers will almost always result in the release
of oil, and the reverse is true for double-hull tankers.</p>
<p>Most of us in the marine industry are just as concerned
with maintaining the quality of the oceans as the
environmentalists your editorial discredits. Within our
industry, there is little argument about the superiority of
double-hull construction as a deterrent to oil pollution.</p>
<p>The combination of increasing prices, tightening of some
world-wide capacity, and an international agreement
eradicating subsidy practices leaves U.S. shipyards in an
enviable position since American yards have available
capacity, a stable labor situation, and long-term competitive
pricing to pursue commercial market opportunities. This has
led U.S. yards and naval architects to design double-hull
tankers that will cost less to build and be cheaper and safer
to operate.</p>
