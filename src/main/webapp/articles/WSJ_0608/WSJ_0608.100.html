	<p class="article-leader">DALLAS -- Chili's Inc. said it has called for redemption
July 6 its $35 million of 6.25% convertible subordinated
debentures due 2012 at a price of $1,057.81 per $1,000 face
amount, eliminating almost all of the restaurant company's
debt.
   Chili's said the debentures are convertible until June 26
into common stock at a price of $27.67 a share, or about 36
common shares per $1,000 bond. Assuming all the debentures
are converted to common stock, Chili's will issue 1.3 million
new common shares.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The company currently has about 10.6 million shares and
stock options outstanding. Chili's said that under an
agreement with Goldman, Sachs & Co., Goldman will purchase
any debentures that aren't converted and then will convert
its holding to common stock.</p>
