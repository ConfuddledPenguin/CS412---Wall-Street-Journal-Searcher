	<p class="article-leader">BROWNSVILLE, TEXAS -- A federal bankruptcy judge approved
a series of measures that allow Greyhound Lines Inc. to keep
its buses on the road for the start of the summer travel
season.
   Judge Richard S. Schmidt said he would permit Greyhound to
pay salaries and operating expenses until June 28, when he
scheduled another hearing to discuss the matter. He also
permitted the company to release $2 million in pre-filing COD
payments from package-express customers and to honor charter
bus deposits made before Monday, when Greyhound and five
other units of GLI Holding Co. filed for protection under
Chapter 11 of the federal bankruptcy code.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"This enables us to get on with business as usual,"
Greyhound spokesman George Gravley said of the decisions.</p>
<p>But the proceedings also set the stage for continued
wrangling between Greyhound and the Amalgamated Transit
Union, which has waged a three-month-long strike against the
company. Among the $29.5 million in pay, benefits and
workers' compensation claims to be honored were $2.5 million
in paychecks issued, but not cleared before the Chapter 11
filing. In a move affecting top Greyhound executives, ATU
attorneys successfully negotiated a $2,000-per-employee cap
on honoring those checks.</p>
<p>Before the hearing, Greyhound withdrew a tender offer it
made two weeks ago to redeem about $191 million in face
amount of debt for about $86 million in cash. J. Michael
Doyle, senior vice president and chief financial officer,
said the action was taken "so that we can focus on mapping
out a sound debt restructuring plan for the court."</p>
