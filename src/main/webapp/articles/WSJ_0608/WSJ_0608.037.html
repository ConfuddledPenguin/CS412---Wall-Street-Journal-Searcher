	<p class="article-leader">Gone is Nikita Khrushchev's boast that the Soviet peoples
are "merging" and Leonid Brezhnev's claim that they are at
least "converging." The Soviet Union is no melting pot. This
conclusion fairly leaps from comparisons of the 1979 and 1989
census figures in the official yearbook.
   The U.S.S.R.'s total population grew 9% in the 1980s, to
286.7 million in 1989. The Moslem republics grew much faster
than the European: Uzbekistan, Turkmenia, Kirghizia and
Tadzhikistan grew 22% to 34%; Azerbaijan, 17%; Kazakhstan,
13%. The European, traditionally Christian regions grew at
less than the Soviet average: the Russian Republic,
Byelorussia and Estonia by 7%; Latvia, 6%; the Ukraine, 4%.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Few Central Asians move to the Russian countryside, which
is badly in need of strong young workers. Instead, Central
Asia's already overcrowded rural communities are becoming
still more populous, a trend aggravated by military force
reductions. Since Central Asians don't move around much, they
intermarry very little with other ethnic groups. In four
Central Asian republics roughly 95% of the natives marry
other natives. Even though more Russians than Kazakhs live in
Kazakhstan, Kazakhs still tend to marry other Kazakhs.</p>
<p>There is a trend away from intermarriage across the Soviet
Union. In the Baltic states, as in Central Asia, the share of
in-group marriages has increased since 1978. In Lithuania, it
is up to 94% from 92%; in Estonia, to 91% from 90%; in
Latvia, with the lowest rate of the Soviet republics, such
marriages increased by slightly less than 1%, to 80%. Nearly
all Armenian men living in Armenia marry Armenian women --
98%. Even in the Russian Republic, which draws students and
workers from many parts of the country, roughly 90% of
Russian men marry other Russians. In Russia as in most of the
republics the ratio of women marrying their own nationality
is slightly lower than these figures for men.</p>
<p>Some minorities do not hold their own. Tatar males, living
in their own "Autonomous Republic" enveloped by Russia, marry
their own kind only 61% of the time -- down from 70% a decade
before. The shrinking number of Jews creates pressure on that
group too for intermarriage: Only 27% of Jewish men in the
Russian Republic marry Jewish women -- down from 41% in 1978.</p>
<p>Unlikely to marry each other, Soviet citizens are growing
apart in other ways too. European Soviets are becoming more
citified. The most urbanized republics are the Russian (74%),
Estonian (72%) and Latvian (71%), while the Central Asian
republics and Moldavia are only 33% to 47% urban. Of the 29
cities with more than a million residents, only five have
many Moslems: Tashkent, Baku, Alma-Ata, Kazan and Ufa.</p>
<p>The predominately rural women of Central Asian are also
extremely fertile. They have about five children on the
average, compared with just over two in Byelorussia, the
Ukraine, the Baltic and Russian republics. The more urbanized
European regions are likely to have low or no population
growth, while Central Asia's soars. Government subsidies for
larger families have spurred fertility slightly in some
European republics, but the trend line for Central Asia has
shot off the chart.</p>
<p>The same rural poverty that leads Central Asians to have
so many children also shortens their life spans. As of 1989
the average Soviet citizen lived to 69.5 years (64.8 for the
average man, and 73.6 years for the average woman, despite
her many chores). As Moscow's demographers acknowledge, the
average life span in the Soviet Union is five to eight years
shorter than it is in the U.S., Western Europe and Japan.
Comparisons for Turkmenia, Moldavia, and Kirghizia are even
less favorable: their life spans average only 66 to 68 years.</p>
<p>Soviet authorities now also admit that mortality rates
increased throughout the U.S.S.R. in the second half of the
1960s and throughout the 1970s, as rampant alcoholism led to
industrial accidents and other health problems. The State
Committee makes the dubious claim that the anti-alcohol
campaigns started in mid-1985 quickly produced a 1.8-year
gain in average Soviet life spans, but it concedes that these
gains, whatever they were, halted after early 1986.</p>
<p>Moslem Central Asia suffers less from alcoholism than
European Russia, but much more from infant mortality: In
Tadzhikistan at least 49 of 1,000 children die in their first
year, compared with 11 in Latvia and 19 in Russia. The Soviet
average is 24.7 per 1,000 -- still 2.5 to five times higher
than in many "developed capitalist countries," the State
Committee says, complaining that Soviet figures have shown
little improvement in the past decade.</p>
<p>In principle the Soviet Union should be able to draw upon
the strengths of Europe, Asia and the Transcaucasus; on the
traditions of Christianity, Islam, Buddhism, Judaism and
other religions; on cultures as diverse as Georgian and
Mongolian. In practice this diversity yields not synergy but
entropy.</p>
