	<p class="article-leader">Gerald Greenwald, who left the No. 2 job at Chrysler Corp.
to lead the proposed employee buy-out of United Airlines,
will be paid at least $9 million under terms of his
employment contract, even if the buyout effort fails.
   Mr. Greenwald, who quit as Chrysler's vice chairman last
week, received a $5 million bonus for signing on with the
buyout group, according to people familiar with his
compensation. He will receive an additional $4 million fee
even if the takeover isn't completed.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The big payments are part of a five-year contract Mr.
Greenwald negotiated with United Airline's three unions
before agreeing last Wednesday to spearhead their takeover
effort. Under that agreement, the 54-year-old executive began
earning a $1.2 million annual salary the day the contract was
signed.</p>
<p>If the transaction is completed, Mr. Greenwald will
receive a "success fee" of $1.2 million in addition to his
regular salary in the first year of the contract.</p>
<p>Mr. Greenwald, who is slated to become UAL's chairman if
the employees take control, was in a strong bargaining
position since there is no guarantee the buy-out will
succeed. The unions had sought to keep terms of the agreement
secret. However, details of the pay package began to emerge
as the effort enters a critical stage.</p>
<p>Mr. Greenwald and the unions' advisers are about to the
begin formal discussions with banks over financing for the
$4.38 billion so that they can meet a financing deadline of
Aug. 9. The buy-out group is also in the last stages of
negotiations with United's nonunionized employees whose
support is considered critical to the effort.</p>
<p>The unions have proposed that the noncontract employees
contribute as much as $55 million in annual wage concessions
to fund the buy-out.</p>
<p>Some employees are raising questions about Mr. Greenwald's
level of compensation, especially since workers will have to
take wage cuts to provide "sweat equity" for the buy-out.
However, one leader of the nonunionized employees called Mr.
Greenwald's deal "no worse than what goes on in baseball."</p>
<p>Spokesmen for United's three unions declined to comment on
Mr. Greenwald's contract. Mr. Greenwald couldn't be reached,
but has declined in the past to discuss his compensation.</p>
<p>Union officials have indicated previously that the
financial package was structured to compensate for potential
income and benefits Mr. Greenwald was giving up at Chrysler,
where he was in line to succeed Chairman Lee A. Iacocca. They
note than UAL paid current Chairman Stephen M. Wolf a $6.7
million bonus to take the job three years ago.</p>
<p>One union adviser characterized as "perfectly natural" the
portion of the agreement guaranteeing Mr. Greenwald a fee if
the transaction fails.</p>
<p>At Chrysler, Mr. Greenwald received an annual salary of
$1.1 million. According to 1990 proxy materials, he held
47,647 Chrysler shares and had options to buy $21,625 more at
prices ranging from $13.98 to $25.88. Chrysler stock closed
at $16.125 yesterday in composite trading on the New York
Stock Exchange.</p>
<p>The UAL agreement also provides Mr. Greenwald with stock
in the airline. It couldn't be determined how big of a stake
Mr. Greenwald would receive. As currently contemplated, the
employees would own 100% of United Airlines if the buy-out
succeeds.</p>
<p>Discussions with the nonunionized employees are expected
to come to a head within the next few days. The buy-out is
structured so that it could proceed without the participation
of the 26,000 non-contract employees. But it would hurt the
buy-out group if dissent among the ranks surfaced during
financing negotiations with the banks.</p>
<p>The buy-out group is also close to finalizing a proposed
slate of directors should the buy-out succeed. The unions
asked Spencer Stuart Associates, an executive search firm, to
recommend eight outside directors for the 15-member board.</p>
<p>The unions want to have a slate of directors in hand in
order to convince banks that Mr. Greenwald and the board, not
the unions, will govern the company. One official familiar
with the deliberations said the unions want to keep some
current UAL directors, believing that will enhance their
chances with the banks.</p>
<p>Mr. Greenwald and three union representatives will also
sit on the board.</p>
