	<p class="article-leader">In one of several recent executive changes, NV Philips
said the last founding-family member in its senior management
is retiring from the company.
   Frans Otten, 55 years old, will step down July 1 as an
executive vice president, the Dutch electronics company said.
Last February, the company announced that Mr. Otten would
leave Oct. 1 to take charge of its relations with the
European Community in Brussels.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Philips said Mr. Otten decided not to take the Brussels
job for "personal reasons." He was unavailable for comment.</p>
<p>Walter Grunsteidl, Philips's representative in Brussels,
is moving to Vienna to monitor developments in Eastern
Europe. Philips has made no decision on who will succeed Mr.
Grunsteidl.</p>
<p>Philips also announced that shareholders will be asked
next month to approve a series of management changes,
including the appointment of Jan Timmer as president,
succeeding Cornelis van der Klugt, who also is retiring.</p>
<p>Mr. Timmer, in his current post as head of the consumer
electronics division, has improved results in recent years,
the company said, partly because of the rise in compact disk
sales.</p>
