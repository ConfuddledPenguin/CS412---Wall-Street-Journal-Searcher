	<p class="article-leader">OTTAWA -- The Canadian government decided to delay for
three years a planned smoking ban on international flights of
more than six hours by Canadian carriers.
   The Transport Department said the ban, which was to have
taken effect July 1, will now be implemented July 1, 1993.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>In the meantime, the department said carriers will be
required to reduce the proportion of seats for smokers on
long-range flights by 25% July 1 and by similar amounts
annually until July 1, 1993, when the ban takes effect.</p>
<p>The department, in explaining its decision to delay the
ban, said Canadian airlines and some labor groups have
expressed concern that the Canadian airline industry would
suffer "serious declines in passenger traffic in markets
which have higher percentages of smokers, such as Eastern
Europe and the Far East."</p>
<p>A smoking ban currently applies to all domestic Canadian
flights, to Canada-U.S. flights and to international flights
of less than six hours.</p>
