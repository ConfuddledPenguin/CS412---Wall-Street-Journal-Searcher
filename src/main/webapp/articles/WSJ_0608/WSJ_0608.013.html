	<p class="article-leader">New York -- Anybody who believes architecture is going to
the dogs need look no further than the Cooper-Hewitt Museum.
Beginning today, the former Carnegie mansion's garden will
display two dozen model residences -- all designed for
occupants of the four-pawed variety.
   "We were interested in how something as out-of-the-way as
the doghouse could illuminate the design process," says Ralph
Caplan, a design consultant who helped select the submissions
to be constructed as well as wrote the entertaining
accompanying brochure. "And the exhibit is a reminder that
design has as much to do with the ordinary as with the
lofty."</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Indeed "The Doghouse" (on view here through Oct. 14) shows
remarkably diverse -- and often ingenious -- approaches to
this relatively humble design problem. As different as
Maltese and mastiffs, the structures range from a Mayan
temple made of dog biscuits to a "Bauwauhaus" built on an
overturned Breuer table. There are nostalgic houses like
Charles W. Moore's copper-roofed barn, and deconstructivist
ones like Donna Selene Seftel's, which explodes the box into
four interlockable units. There's a garden bench with canine
quarters below, a portable "Pup Tent," even a "K-9 Club Car"
-- which looks an awful lot like a hot-dog cart.</p>
<p>But there's more to this show than meets the eye.
Co-sponsored by a prominent guide-dog school, Guiding Eyes
for the Blind Inc., the exhibit marks the beginning of the
Cooper-Hewitt's effort to become more accessible to the
visually impaired. Architects invited to submit plans were
encouraged to consider the needs of this audience in addition
to those of the canine "clients." The doghouses are arranged
along specially designed paths with Braille labels. And
during the show there will be weekly tours of the mansion for
the blind and visually impaired.</p>
<p>Particularly responsive to this challenge is "The
All-Seeing `Eye' Doghouse" by Paul Haigh, both of whose
parents are blind. When the dog enters the sleek structure,
topped by a hieroglyphic eye, wind chimes signal his
presence. Flaplike "petting panels" labeled in Braille are
cut into the walls. For added nonvisual appeal, the house is
built from aromatic cedar.</p>
<p>The flea-fighting wood also lines Ronald G. Chung's witty
"Don't Fence Me In." You could call the Berkeley architect's
creation a hole in the wall -- the hidden house is entered
through a dog-inviting gap in the picket-fence facade.</p>
<p>The exhibit's pooch de resistance is Lew Davis and William
H. Paxson's "The Trojan Dog." It's literally a dog house -- a
wooden shelter shaped like a 4 1/2-foot hound. This dog all
but begs to be petted, from his floppy movable ears down to
his claw feet. About the only thing visually impaired
visitors will miss is the charming Egyptian-style dog frieze
ringing the body.</p>
<p>What its creators hope won't be overlooked is "The Trojan
Dog's" somewhat hidden message. Harking back to the
structure's mythological inspiration, the wooden horse used
to penetrate the walls of Troy, Mr. Davis says: "Here we have
a Trojan dog that symbolically represents an assault on the
barriers that still have to be broken down between disabled
people and the rest of society."</p>
<p>Another amusing structure with a serious side is "Lassie
Come Home," by Tucker Viemeister and associates. Real-life
Rin Tin Tins can find refuge in this recycled TV console --
complete with built-in picture window. "We think there are
already too many products so we wanted to use something that
was out there," Mr. Viemeister says. "And what epitomizes the
wasteland more than a junked TV set?"</p>
<p>During the dog days ahead it would be hard to beat Lee H.
Skolnick's "Lap Dog Pool House." The shelter here is pretty
bare-bones -- a red corrugated metal triangle set into a
white-shingled wall -- but the amenities are posh. There's an
astroturf-covered sundeck, a bone-shaped weather vane and, of
course, a pool.</p>
<p>Some of the structures are more appealing in theory than
practice, an architectural problem that extends far beyond
doghouses. For instance, the idea behind Robin Parkinson's
spiraling design -- the circular path dogs take before lying
down -- is considerably more interesting than the stark
metallic teepee that resulted. Ms. Seftel's four-component
"DogMA Doghouse," a spatial exploration inspired by the
Japanese word "ma" (or "space in-between"), is nothing if not
clever: There's a dog-shaped feeding dish for the
"dog-eat-dog world" area, a skylight for gazing at the Dog
Star, etc. But the Great Dane-sized explanatory plaque makes
it all seem too, well, dogmatic.</p>
<p>No one is likely to pick that bone with Peter Pennoyer's
"Dog House for Small Dogs." From the 6 1/2-foot tower's
bone-shaped supporting columns to its crowning
doggie-detailed clock, this is a whimsical winner. The
architect explains the design was shaped by his in-house
consultants, a pair of miniature longhaired dachshunds: "I
find little dogs often want more attention than big dogs."</p>
<p>So, how did they like the result? "When I put a bone
inside they decided it was a pretty good place to be," Mr.
Pennoyer says. "But being New York City dogs, they prefer
upholstered furniture."</p>
