	<p class="article-leader">MOSCOW -- Mikhail Gorbachev has left behind the cheering
American crowds and come home to confusion and critical
deadlines on the economic front. Within a week, he must find
support for his latest economic proposal, now under attack
from all sides.
   After several years of halfway measures that generally
have only worsened the shortages, speculation and daily
hardships, the Soviet people show little to no faith in the
government's ability to improve the situation. The Soviet
Parliament plans to decide next week whether to approve the
latest Gorbachev program. It has already extended its session
twice to grapple with the issue.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Since Soviet Premier Nikolai Ryzhkov announced the program
May 24, its backers such as First Deputy Premier Leonid
Abalkin have been campaigning in the media for public
understanding of the plan to turn a centrally controlled
economy into a market economy.</p>
<p>But politicians and economists from the right and left are
assailing the program, and most people here simply don't
understand what a market economy is.</p>
<p>"In Moscow today you find more opinions than people," Axel
Lebahn, director of Deutsche Bank AG, said at a recent
conference on the outlook for investment in the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>Those who are classed as conservatives here argue that the
program doesn't protect workers from unemployment or
inflation. They say its risks are great and that the worker
will have to bear the greatest burden in the transition,
paying higher prices without being adequately compensated.</p>
<p>On the other side, some argue that the transition
envisioned is too slow. Others say that the overall pace may
be adequate but that the program is starting from the wrong
place by making price increases one of the first steps.</p>
<p>The program outlines a five-year transition to take place
in three stages:</p>
<p>First, 1990 would be spent preparing price changes, and
the social and legal framework for a market economy.</p>
<p>Next, in 1991 and 1992, the government would still direct
some industrial and agricultural production, but a new price
and tax system, higher interest rates and other fundamental
measures will be implemented. Some state property will be
transferred to collective, semiprivate or individual control.</p>
<p>Finally, from 1993 to 1995, market pricing and competition
are to develop rapidly as central control withers away.</p>
<p>The program's architects say that unemployment will rise
and production will fall in the first two years of the
program but that 1993 should start to bring an improvement in
living standards. The government rejected the alternative of
Polish-style "shock therapy," an immediate freeing of prices
and an halt to government subsidies like those adopted by the
new non-Communist government in Poland, as extreme and
politically risky.</p>
<p>For the public, however, the first concrete evidence of
what this plan will mean was the government's announcement of
a tripling of bread prices as of July 1 followed by price
increases on many other foods, consumer goods and services
next Jan. 1. The program also provides for raises in pay, but
its opponents say the increases won't fully compensate
anyone.</p>
<p>The announcement sparked a flurry of shopping and
hoarding, with Muscovites standing in line for hours to buy
such staples as matches and macaroni. More important, by
announcing the price rises as a first step to a market
economy, the government fed popular fears that a market
economy simply means higher prices.</p>
<p>"The most dangerous thing with this program is that it can
discredit the whole idea of the market," says Rair Simonyan,
a senior economist at the Institute of World Economy.
Pro-reform economists agree that price overhaul is essential,
but some say it is the wrong place to start. Prices could
evolve more naturally if industry were put in private hands
first, they say.</p>
<p>"It would have been wiser to have started from the other
end, from agriculture -- giving the freedom of economic
activity on the land," says Oleg Bogomolov, director of the
Institute of the Economics of the World Socialist System.
Large state-owned farms could be leased in parcels to
families and cooperatives, he says, and there could be a
gradual reduction of their legal obligation to deliver
certain kinds and amounts of products.</p>
<p>But the program's designers defend starting with price
increases, saying they will familiarize people with real
price structures and will help soak up the roughly 160
billion rubles ($268 billion at the official exchange rate)
in cash that the Soviet people are estimated to have stashed
away.</p>
<p>In the past week, Mr. Abalkin has tried to separate the
price increases from the fundamental concept of a market
economy. In several newspaper interviews and a televised
debate, he has explained that price rises are only a
preparation to allow a move to a market economy. He said the
government announced them at an early stage to be honest with
the people. "The only chance for avoiding social eruption is
to honestly declare the intentions of the government," he
said in an interview with Pravda this week.</p>
<p>But the people appear unconvinced. The nation's largest
coal-mining area has threatened a strike to protest the price
rises, and the three largest Soviet republics have all voted
to refuse to impose them. A recent poll by the All-Union
Center for Studies of National Public Opinion found that 77%
of those surveyed expect increased economic difficulties or
an economic catastrophe. Only 32% tended to believe the
current government would be able to lead the country out of
the crisis.</p>
<p>Says Levada Alexandrovich, a senior researcher at the
polling center: "For a long time we've lived a socialist
life, and it's not a joke. It's not a good life, but a large
part of the population is accustomed to it -- to not so much
wages and not so many goods, but more or less stability."</p>
