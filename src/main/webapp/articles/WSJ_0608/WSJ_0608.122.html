	<p class="article-leader">Tokyo stock prices finished higher with a broad range of
issues adding moderate gains on active buying by
corporations, individuals and dealers who traded for their
own accounts, analysts said.
   Meanwhile, stocks in London steadily lost ground in late
afternoon trading, with the Financial Times-Stock Exchange
100 Share Index ending at the midway point of its intraday
range.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Tokyo's Nikkei Index of 225 issues gained 239 points to
33192.50, finishing above 33000 points for the first time in
five trading days. The index gained 31.88 points Wednesday.</p>
<p>In early trading in Tokyo Friday, the Nikkei index rose
54.09 points to 33246.59.</p>
<p>With help from some arbitrage buying, the Nikkei Index
moved at higher levels Thursday afternoon, before closing
just below its intraday high, traders said.</p>
<p>Because Thursday was the last trading day for the June
stock futures and options, fears of a possible heavy sell-off
linked to the unwinding of the futures contract had
discouraged buying until yesterday.</p>
<p>But growing confidence that the market can absorb such
futures-related selling prompted investors to buy stocks
without waiting for the special quotation today, when
settlement prices for the June futures and options are
determined, said Hiroyuki Murai, general manager of stock
trading at Nikko Securities.</p>
<p>"That's because investors are expecting gains when
uncertainty {about the impact of unwinding of the futures} is
cleared," the analyst said.</p>
<p>Volume on the first section was estimated at 650 million
shares, up from 599.6 million shares Wednesday. Advancers
outnumbered decliners 567 to 372, while 185 issues were
unchanged.</p>
<p>The Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed in the
first section, which shed 1.86 points Wednesday, was up 5.37
points, or 0.22%, at 2428.44.</p>
<p>The second section index advanced for the eighth
consecutive trading day, gaining 17.75 points, or 0.44%, to
4057.12. Volume was estimated at 24 million shares, down from
30.6 million shares Wednesday.</p>
<p>"Fears of a vast sell-off were wiped out," said Masashi
Okuma, a senior trader at UBS Phillips & Drew International,
as arbitragers opted to roll over their positions held
against the June futures contract to the September contract.</p>
<p>Analysts said the prevailing view on the market is that
stock prices will advance strongly today and in the first
half of next week if domestic interest rates and exchange
rates remain at current levels.</p>
<p>One analyst said not many investors are willing to buy any
issue steadily, pushing its price higher. But investors place
buy orders whenever stock prices fall, gradually pushing up
the bottom of the Nikkei Index's range.</p>
<p>Buying interest was spread over a wide range of sectors.
Volume failed to grow in the afternoon session, as
large-capital shares, which were the focus of morning trade
were replaced by small-capital shares, traders said.</p>
<p>On the one hand, large-capital shares led by shipbuilding
stocks gained, partly supported by major brokerage houses'
efforts, traders said. Brokers were trying to make up profit
declines caused by lowered commission fees this month by
increasing trade volume, observers said.</p>
<p>Buying interest, including that from institutions,
continued to stream toward small-capital shares with bright
earnings outlooks. Such interest wasn't limited to the Tokyo
Stock Exchange first and second sections, but was consistent
on over-the-counter trading, as well as on the Osaka and
Nagoya stock exchanges.</p>
<p>Other issues that gained were laggards in sectors such as
mining, cement, machinery and automobiles.</p>
<p>Winners included construction companies such as Kajima,
which gained 20 yen to 1980 yen (13 cents to $12.98), and
Kumagai Gumi, which added 50 yen to 1250 yen.</p>
<p>Some car makers ended firmer, with Isuzu gaining 20 yen to
1110 yen, and Honda up 20 yen to 1810 yen.</p>
<p>In London, traders said that the market was being pulled
in two directions, with London continuing to look undervalued
relative to other leading exchanges but being dictated to by
Wall Street's fortunes.</p>
<p>"There's a lot of nervousness about Wall Street because
it's all over the place," said one market maker, referring to
Wall Street's recent erratic trading pattern.</p>
<p>If Wall Street holds steady, London could easily breach
upside resistance levels, traders noted. With the recent
phenomenon of trade houses' running short positions largely
ended, the market is in a healthier position to scale new
heights, the traders added.</p>
<p>A gain would be aided by an actual takeover bid. Current
takeover rumors are helping to shore up prices, but an actual
bid would swiftly add 30 points to the FTSE 100 index, the
traders reckon.</p>
<p>The FT-SE 100 Share Index ended up 19.9 points yesterday
to 2378.4. The index initially fell, but the day's reversal
was largely attributed to bargain hunting by institutions
with considerable cash.</p>
<p>The Financial Times 30 Share Index rose 23 points to 1904.
Volume was 592.5 million shares, compared with 429 million
issues Wednesday.</p>
<p>In the futures markets, the June FT-SE 100 index contract
ended at 2425, up from 2399 Wednesday.</p>
<p>Banks issues suffered yesterday, running out of steam
after a recent run-up on speculation of a takeover. Lloyds
fell 6 pence to 291 pence (10 cents to $4.91), while Midland
shed 42 pence to 354 pence.</p>
<p>Unilever's 7 pence loss to 698 pence was ascribed to
U.S.-led selling. Burton dropped 10 pence to 164 pence, as
the retail sector generally fell.</p>
<p>Boots, which reported a rise in pretax profit for the year
to March 31 to #358 million from #306.7 million, eased after
an initial rally. The stock shed 2 pence to 296 pence.
Traders said the results were discounted in the share price,
which rose earlier in the week. In addition, the company's
much-vaunted new heart drug won't likely yield profits for
several more years, traders said.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, stocks closed higher in Milan and Brussels,
lower in Stockholm, Frankfurt, Zurich and Madrid, and mixed
in Paris and Amsterdam. South African gold stocks closed
sharply lower.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, shares ended higher in Manila and Singapore,
and lower in Sydney, Taipei, Hong Kong, Seoul and Wellington.</p>

Perspective, Geneva. To make them directly comparable, each
index is based on the close of 1969 equaling 100. The
percentage change is since year-end.</p>
