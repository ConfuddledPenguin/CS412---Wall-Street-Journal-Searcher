	<p class="article-leader">TOKYO -- Hitachi Ltd. said it has developed a prototype
for a "next-generation" 64-megabit dynamic random access
memory chip with extremely low power requirements.
   The prototype, which Hitachi says is the world's first,
has 16 times the memory capacity than the four megabit DRAMs
that are the largest capacity chips in mass production today.
The next largest chips, with capacity of 16 megabits, are
still in the experimental stage.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Hitachi officials said the prototype consumes
approximately one-tenth the electricity required by the
16-megabit DRAMs the company unveiled recently, suggesting a
new step toward miniaturization of products such as laptop
computers.</p>
<p>The prototype is capable of operating on a 1.5-volt
battery cell, because of the use of dense packing technology.</p>
<p>An industry analyst said the timing of the announcement
"isn't a mystery," considering the speed with which Japanese
semiconductor makers are developing advanced chips.</p>
<p>The Japanese industry also is working to develop advanced
mass-production techniques, he noted, adding he expects
Hitachi to begin producing the chips by 1996. Hitachi said it
didn't know when mass production would begin.</p>
