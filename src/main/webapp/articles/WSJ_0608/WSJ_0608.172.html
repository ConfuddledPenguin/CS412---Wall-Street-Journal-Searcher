	<h3>Your Money Matters: Bank-Lobby Shopping for Mutual Funds May Be Convenient, but at What Price?</h3>

	<p class="article-leader">Probably more people could tell you which six states
border Arkansas than could tell you whether the mutual funds
they buy in banks are different from other funds.
   But this ignorance can be costly. While it is possible to
find top-performing mutual funds at banks, many do little
better than passbook savings accounts. There can also be
other pitfalls.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Banks have been offering stock and bond mutual funds for
only a few years. But more and more of them are getting into
the act these days, lured by lucrative fees and a captive
consumer base.</p>
<p>"It's a natural addition to their product line," says
Patrick Kennedy, a marketing vice president at Northern Trust
Co. in Chicago. "They have the distribution channels in
place, and they have the image as a more secure organization,
whether right or wrong."</p>
<p>Lipper Analytical Services Inc. tracks the performance of
435 bank-advised funds, representing $71 billion. That
compares with a mutual fund universe of 2,549 funds, at $1
trillion. Only about 88 of the largest banks actually manage
investments themselves. Other banks without the in-house
resources to manage money often contract with mutual-fund
companies to sell outside funds in bank offices, sometimes
under a bank name, in exchange for a percentage of fees.</p>
<p>The banks' biggest selling point is convenience. Customers
can purchase mutual funds with the same ease that they buy a
certificate of deposit -- and have the ability to redeem
shares into their checking accounts with a phone call. Some,
including Chase Manhattan Bank, also count the money in
mutual funds toward the minimum balance necessary for free
checking.</p>
<p>But investors who limit themselves to mutual funds they
find for sale in bank lobbies may be curtailing their choices
unnecessarily. Unless a bank has a brokerage affiliate that
enables depositors to buy "outside" funds, they may have to
settle for a family with six or fewer funds.</p>
<p>"Investors who want a growth fund, a money market and a
fixed-income fund would be lucky to find that the three
offered by their bank all have better than average returns,"
says Matthew Fink of the Investment Company Institute, a
trade group for the mutual funds industry.</p>
<p>Further, investors in most cases are limited to funds that
charge sales fees, usually 4.5% to 5%, though a few major
institutions such as Chase and Citibank offer their own
no-load funds. Anyone with the energy to pick up the phone
has access to many top-performing mutual funds that are
available from mutual fund companies without sales fees.</p>
<p>As for performance, bank officials challenge the
prevailing belief that mutual fund companies are inherently
better at managing money. "One of the myths on Wall Street is
that banks aren't good at managing money," says Gregory
Sanford, a managing director at Security Pacific Corp. in Los
Angeles.</p>
<p>Since most bank-advised funds are relatively new, they
don't have performance figures available for longer than
three years, which makes long-term performance impossible to
evaluate. But the numbers that are available show that
returns vary widely. Moreover, some of the major bank fund
families include both stellar and mediocre performers.</p>
<p>"The bottom line is that the performance is generated by
the investment managers, and you have good and bad in
banking, and good and bad in outside fund management," says
Stephen Mintos, director of sales and marketing with the
Winsbury Co., a Columbus, Ohio firm that provides mutual fund
services to banks.</p>
<p>Investors evaluating the performance of a bank-advised
fund should compare it with other funds of its type, such as
growth funds or balanced funds, "regardless of whether it's a
bank fund or a traditional mutual fund," Mr. Mintos says.</p>
<p>Says Northern Trust's Mr. Kennedy: "Only go with a bank if
you get the type of fund you're looking for, and the
performance."</p>
<p>Some bank funds have done quite well. Over the past 12
months, for instance, Chase Manhattan's Vista Growth and
Income was up 36.87%, compared with an average of 9.8% for
all growth-and-income mutual funds, according to Lipper
Analytical; Vista Capital Growth was up 10.35%, compared with
11.24% for all growth funds.</p>
<p>Other bank funds with healthy returns over the past 12
months include Security Pacific's Pacific Horizon Convertible
(up 16.81% vs. 4.48% for all convertible funds) and Banc One
Co.'s Helmsman Income Equity (up 12.22%, compared with 6.85%
for all equity-income funds).</p>
<p>On the other hand, Citibank's Landmark Growth and Income
was up just 2.08%, far below the 9.8% group average, Lipper's
numbers show.</p>
<p>Investors who stick with their banks should also know that
the funds available there tend to be smaller than other
mutual funds. "They haven't been around as long, and aren't
marketed nationally," says James McLaughlin, director of
trust and securities for the American Bankers Association.</p>
<p>Their smaller size may give some bank funds the same
disadvantages all smaller funds typically face, such as being
more difficult to track, and having higher expense ratios,
which can have a negative effect on performance. However,
many banks have been willing to waive some investment
advisory fees until the fund reaches a target size.</p>
<p>"Read the prospectus to find out what fees they're
waiving, and for how long," says Michael Ryba, product
manager for Columbus, Ohio-based Banc One's Helmsman funds,
which charge no advisory fees on most funds.</p>
<p>(Finally, for those who've been racking their brains about
geography, the six states bordering Arkansas are -- starting
to the north and moving clockwise -- Missouri, Tennessee,
Mississippi, Louisiana, Texas and Oklahoma.)</p>

<p>      How Some Bank-Advised Mutual Funds Compare</p>
<p>Bank mutual-fund families typically include money-market,
growth-stock and fixed-income funds; some also include such
other offerings as aggressive-growth, growth-and-income,
balanced and international funds. Most bank fund families
offer telephone switching and redemptions, and fund
investments are sometimes counted toward balances required
for no-fee checking.</p>
