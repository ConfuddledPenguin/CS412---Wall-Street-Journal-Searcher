	<p class="article-leader">Ipsco Inc., a Regina, Saskatchewan, steelmaker, said it
will report a charge of 19.8 million Canadian dollars
(US$16.9 million), or C$1.39 a share, against its
second-quarter net income, as a result of asset write-downs
and severance payments.
   A year earlier, Ipsco earned C$6.8 million, or 48 Canadian
cents a share, on revenue of C$127.9 million.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The company said it wrote down the value of its Canadian
assets producing tubular steel products used in the oil and
gas industry, as a result of an expected decline in demand.
The assets had a net book value before the write-down of
C$77.2 million, Ipsco said. Even without the write-down, the
company said it would have recorded a second-quarter loss,
owing to falling sales of flat-rolled steel and a delay in
shipping a large order of large diameter pipe, for
environmental reasons.</p>
<p>Ipsco said its third-quarter outlook is positive, from the
expected shipment of two large steel pipe orders. But if the
Canadian dollar maintains its high value against the U.S.
currency, Ipsco said its sales to traditional U.S. markets
could be further affected.</p>
