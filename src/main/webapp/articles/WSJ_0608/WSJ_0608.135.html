	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- Democratic and Republican leaders in the
Senate said they will continue efforts to salvage an omnibus
anti-crime bill, after a second attempt to limit debate on
the wide-ranging legislation failed.
   After private negotiations last night, proponents of the
bill said they will try to preserve for a future vote
provisions already fiercely debated on the Senate floor,
including a three-year ban on nine types of semi-automatic
"assault" weapons, expansion of the federal death penalty,
and sharp curbs on constitutional appeals by death-row
inmates.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>But George Mitchell, the majority leader, and Robert Dole,
the minority leader, emerged from the closed-door session to
report that they didn't have an agreement. Democrats, Mr.
Mitchell said, "will review and take a look at" a Republican
proposal to avoid a filibuster that has threatened to kill
the entire bill.</p>
<p>Delaware Sen. Joseph Biden, who is managing the
legislation for the Democrats, sounded more optimistic in a
separate press conference. Calling the Republican proposal "a
serious effort," he said, "my gut tells me something will
break and we will get a bill."</p>
<p>Among other things, the GOP proposed to strip a measure
that would allow criminal juries in certain instances to
consider unconstitutionally gathered evidence. Mr. Biden
predicted there would be several days of negotiations before
any further votes.</p>
<p>Earlier yesterday, Democratic proponents of the bill had
pronounced it dead after the Senate failed for a second time
to limit debate on the legislation. The second vote in favor
of a 30-hour debate limit was 57-37, but 60 votes are needed
under Senate rules.</p>
<p>With some 300 amendments pending at that point, debate
could have dragged on indefinitely. Mr. Mitchell had said
that without a time limit, he would be forced to end
consideration of the bill. That outcome is exactly what
opponents of the gun-control provision, led by the National
Rifle Association, had sought in helping orchestrate the
avalanche of amendments.</p>
<p>But South Carolina Sen. Strom Thurmond led a Republican
effort to save some portion of the crime legislation. In a
private caucus, GOP leaders agreed to propose to Democrats
that each party be allowed to propose a maximum of 12
amendments to the current version of the bill, with a
predetermined time limit on debate, Republican aides said.</p>
<p>Another set of noncontroversial amendments might also be
added under the Republican plan, aides said. GOP leaders
proposed that the Senate drop consideration of a Biden
proposal to allow certain exceptions to the so-called
exclusionary rule, which bars the use of unconstitutionally
gathered evidence in criminal prosecutions. Republicans have
advocated even broader exceptions to the rule, and the issue
was sure to provoke sharp conflict.</p>
<p>In his news conference, Mr. Biden indicated a willingness
to consider eliminating the exclusionary-rule provision, as
well as his proposal to create a new division for drugs and
organized crime within the Justice Department.</p>
