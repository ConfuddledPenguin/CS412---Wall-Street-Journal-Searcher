	<p class="article-leader">Despite declining revenue from bond funds, Piper Jaffray
Inc. expects small investors' increasing enthusiasm for
stocks to slightly boost its earnings for the fiscal year
ending Sept. 30, Charles Hayssen, chief financial officer,
said.
   "The days are over for {bond} funds. People have had
enough of them," Mr. Hayssen said in an interview. Yields
have fallen on many such funds since the October 1987 stock
market crash. Revenue from a new bond fund helped boost net
income of Piper's regional brokerage concern, Piper, Jaffray
& Hopwood Inc., last year to $11.7 million, or $2.92 a share,
on revenue of $195.2 million.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Piper, based in Minneapolis, is typical of regional
brokers who specialize in analyzing industries in their area
for individual investors. Piper's expertise is largely in
food, agricultural and medical technology concerns.</p>
<p>The financial performance of such regional firms is viewed
by some analysts as a gauge of small investors' interest in
the market. Regional brokers generally haven't been hit as
hard by cutbacks on Wall Street as have their national
full-service counterparts, some of whose revenue from
investment banking is off by 20% or more.</p>
<p>At Piper, brokers' commissions on sales of mutual funds
over the past seven months are running 50% ahead of the like
period in the previous fiscal year, according to Mr. Hayssen.
Commissions on listed stocks rose 20% in the same period, he
said, which indicates to him that "the small investor is
showing some courage."</p>
<p>The turnover rate in the ranks of Piper brokers is about
10% this year, compared with 18% a year ago. The industrywide
broker turnover rate a year ago was about 20%. Piper
currently has about 750 retail brokers, compared with 675
just before the 1987 market crash.</p>
<p>Piper has helped its earnings in the past two fiscal years
by starting bond funds in its fourth quarter that sold well.
Last year, 35% of Piper's earnings came on sales of such a
fund. "That isn't likely this year," Mr. Hayssen said.</p>
<p>But, he insisted: "Small investors are listening to
brokers' stories about stocks again. They're starting to get
interested. The fear from the crash of October 1987 is
disappearing."</p>
<p>He declined to forecast net for the fiscal third quarter,
ending June 30. But he said revenue in the first two months
of the quarter was 15% higher than a year earlier. In last
year's third quarter, Piper had net of $3.3 million, or 83
cents a share, on revenue of $53 million.</p>
<p>Mr. Hayssen said it's too early to make a specific
forecast for full-year earnings, although analysts expect
them to be flat. He disclosed that planned initial offerings
and additional offerings of stock by certain of Piper's
Midwestern clients could cause earnings in the fourth quarter
to surge from last year's $4.1 million, or $1.03 a share, on
revenue of $57.4 million. But he said such offerings might
also be delayed until the next fiscal year.</p>
<p>For that reason, a specific forecast isn't possible, and
earnings for the year "may be about the same, plus or minus a
little," he said.</p>
