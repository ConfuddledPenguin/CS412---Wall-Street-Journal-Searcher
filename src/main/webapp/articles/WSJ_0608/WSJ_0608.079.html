	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- A third day of selective profit-taking wiped
out an opening surge in stock prices, pushing that market
lower while bond prices inched higher on more evidence of
slowing economic growth.
   The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 14.32 points to
close at 2897.33 in moderately active trading. Long-term U.S.
Treasury bond prices rose an eighth of a point -- or $1.25
for each $1,000 of face amount -- in light trading. The
dollar was mixed against the mark and the yen, with many
traders awaiting new readings next week on the inflation
rate.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Money manager Rajiv Sharma, president of Serco
Investments, Sausalito, Calif., was among the stock-market
profit-takers. "We have been net sellers since it went over
2900," he said. At 2850, he started selling technology,
oil-drilling and environmental-services stocks. At 2900, he
started shedding Dow industrial stocks.</p>
<p>The rally that took the industrial average above 2900
Friday was sparked by a run-up in bond prices. Rather than
risk the possibility of bonds heading into a severe downturn,
"It's better to take profits now and let the market play
itself out," Mr. Sharma said.</p>
<p>But without a bond-market retreat, Gene Seagle,
technical-research director at Gruntal & Co., says the
industrial average still could make a run for 3000. If the
extreme bears throw in the towel and the New York Stock
Exchange has a few 200 million share days, "we'll go through
3000 to 3150 before we have an intermediate correction," he
predicted.</p>
<p>Concern about too much bullishness may be tempering buying
interest, some analysts say. This week's Investors
Intelligence survey of investment advisers shows the bulls
rising to 47.8% of those surveyed from 45.5% last week; bears
fell to 35.4% from 41.1%. The worry is that advisers who call
themselves bulls are in the market, which implies there are
fewer investors on the sidelines waiting to get in.</p>
<p>The bullish percentage is "still below a level that would
suggest the market is overbought," said Michael Burke, editor
of the survey for Chartcraft Inc., New Rochelle, N.Y. "When
it gets into the 53% to 56% range, that normally signals a
correction."</p>
<p>Bond prices moved narrowly as investors tried to figure
out how -- or if -- Manuel Johnson's resignation as a Federal
Reserve Board governor might affect Fed policy on interest
rates. Prices then rose on the news that consumer-installment
credit in April rose much less than expected.</p>
<p>Some analysts say consumers are leery of taking on debt
because they lack confidence in the economy's health. This
additional indication of sluggish economic growth in turn
raises investors' expectations that the Fed will lower
interest rates to stimulate business activity and keep the
economy from tipping into recession.</p>
<p>In major market action:</p>
<p>Stock prices fell on volume of 160.4 million shares, down
from 164 million Wednesday, in Big Board trading. Declining
issues outnumbered advancers, 852 to 638.</p>
<p>Bond prices rose. The yield on the Treasury's benchmark
30-year bond eased to 8.42%.</p>
<p>The dollar gained slightly. In late New York trading, the
currency was at 1.6935 marks and 152.55 yen, compared with
1.6885 marks and 152.65 yen Wednesday.</p>
