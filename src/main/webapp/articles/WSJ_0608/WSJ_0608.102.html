	<p class="article-leader">Martin S. Davis, the chairman of Paramount Communications
Inc., said that John A. Mulheren Jr. offered to secretly
monitor the activities of Ivan F. Boesky in connection with
Paramount.
   Testifying on behalf of the government in the conspiracy
and securities fraud trial of Mr. Mulheren, Mr. Davis said he
met with Mr. Mulheren in October 1985, only two days after he
met with Mr. Boesky and Carl C. Icahn, the New York financier
who is chairman of TWA Inc.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Mr. Davis said Mr. Mulheren phoned him and asked if
Paramount's predecessor company, Gulf & Western Inc., would
join with a group led by Mr. Mulheren to acquire CBS Inc., a
transaction that never occurred. Mr. Davis said Mr. Mulheren
also "stated he could be very helpful to us in monitoring the
activities of Ivan Boesky" in Gulf & Western stock. "He was
in agreement with positions I stated about Mr. Boesky," which
were "nothing complimentary," Mr. Davis said.</p>
<p>Mr. Mulheren is charged with, among other things,
manipulating the price of Gulf & Western shares at the
request of Mr. Boesky. The government has accused Mr.
Mulheren of buying 75,000 Gulf & Western shares on Oct. 17,
1985, in an effort to boost the market price of Gulf &
Western stock so that Mr. Boesky could sell his 4.9% stake in
the company at a higher price than the shares might otherwise
have traded on that day. Mr. Boesky sold his Gulf & Western
stake to the company that day.</p>
<p>Mr. Davis said that when Mr. Mulheren indicated he agreed
with Mr. Davis's unfavorable view of Mr. Boesky, Mr. Davis
didn't know that Mr. Mulheren was then a co-trustee of trusts
established for Mr. Boesky's children.</p>
<p>Shortly after Mr. Mulheren offered his assistance, Mr.
Davis said, Mr. Mulheren called Mr. Davis to say that he did
not believe that Mr. Boesky held any Gulf & Western shares.
However, Mr. Davis indicated in his testimony that he knew
that Mr. Boesky held 4.9% of Gulf & Western's stock at that
time.</p>
<p>Mr. Davis also testified about two separate meetings he
held with both Mr. Icahn and Mr. Boesky, each of whom held
4.9% stakes in Gulf & Western in October 1985. At the first
meeting, held in September 1985, Mr. Boesky proposed a
buy-out of Gulf & Western, an offer Mr. Davis rejected. At
the second meeting, in October of that year, Mr. Boesky
proposed that Gulf & Western repurchase his shares at $45 a
share.</p>
<p>The night before Oct. 17, 1985, Mr. Boesky again
reiterated he wanted to sell his shares at $45 each. But the
company's stock was then trading slightly below $45, and Mr.
Davis told Mr. Boesky he would pay the market price for the
stock.</p>
<p>The following day, when the stock reached $45 in trading
on the New York Stock Exchange, Mr. Boesky and Mr. Icahn sold
their shares at the price Mr. Boesky had sought.</p>
<p>"Did you view" Mr. Icahn and Mr. Boesky "to be acting in
concert?" Mr. Davis was asked by Thomas Puccio, the attorney
for Mr. Mulheren. "No," Mr. Davis responded. Mr. Davis, who
said Mr. Icahn is "someone I know well," said he didn't
believe Mr. Icahn would necessarily do whatever Mr. Boesky
did.</p>
