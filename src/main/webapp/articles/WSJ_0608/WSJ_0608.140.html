	<p class="article-leader">NEC Corp. has developed a new siliconwafer etching
technology, taking a crucial step toward mass production of
64 megabit dynamic random access memory chips, the company
announced.
   The latest semiconductors to be mass produced are 4
megabit chips while 16-megabit chips are still in the
experimental stage.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>A NEC spokesman said the new technology, called Super-ECR
Plasma Etching, makes it possible to quickly etch the tightly
packed, complicated structures necessary for the
next-generation chip.</p>
<p>The spokesman said the new technology will first be
applied to the production of 16-megabit chips.</p>
<p>NEC's newly developed technology, using plasma over the
silicon wafer, makes it possible to etch electric circuits at
high speed.</p>
<p>Compared with previously developed plasma etching methods,
the new technology is faster, finer and causes less damage to
adjoining layers of wafer membrane, the spokesman said.</p>
