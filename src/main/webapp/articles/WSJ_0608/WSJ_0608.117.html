	<p class="article-leader">ALC Communications Corp., a long-distance telephone
service company based in Birmingham, Mich., said it
significantly restructured its debt.
   The company obtained $7.5 million in additional financing
from a group of three institutional investors; in exchange,
the investors will receive two-year notes paying 15%
interest, and warrants granting them the right to purchase
17% of ALC's common stock. ALC said a "significant majority"
of holders of its senior subordinated debentures accepted a
deferment of interest payments. ALC's revolving credit line,
provided by Foothill Capital Corp., was renewed for a
two-year term, under substantially unchanged terms. ALC's
majority shareholder, Communications Transmission Inc.,
converted its $20 million bridge loan, due September 1990, to
a term loan, due June 4, 1992, at a reduced interest rate.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"As a result of these and other concessions we have
obtained, the company's cash operating costs have been
reduced by over $1.2 million per month," Marvin Moses, ALC's
chief financial officer, said.</p>
