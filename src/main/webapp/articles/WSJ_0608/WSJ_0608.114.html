	<p class="article-leader">Guardsman Products Inc. President Charles E. Bennett said
the Grand Rapids, Mich., company is "less optimistic today
than previously" about financial results in the current
quarter and for the rest of 1990.
   For the first quarter, the maker of paints, varnishes and
other chemical coatings reported sales of $47.7 million and
net income of $1.7 million, or 23 cents a share. That was
down from year-earlier sales of $46.9 million and net of $1.5
million, or 27 cents a share.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"Our best prediction now for the current period (ending
June 30) is that our second-quarter numbers for both sales
and earnings may be flat or slightly down from the first
quarter," Mr. Bennett said.</p>
<p>Guardsman's stock stopped trading on the New York Stock
Exchange late Thursday afternoon.</p>
