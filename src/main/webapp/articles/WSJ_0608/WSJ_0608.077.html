	<p class="article-leader">TOKYO -- Capital investment plans by Japan's major
semiconductor makers remain strong despite predictions that
the market will show little growth this year.
   According to World Semiconductor Trade Statistics
estimates, semiconductor sales are expected to decline by
about 1% this year, after rising 8.2% in 1989.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Despite the prospect of slow growth for the near term,
however, Japanese manufacturers aren't trimming their capital
investment plans. Leading makers say they are increasingly
confident that they've passed the worst stage of the "silicon
cycle" between the end of 1989 and the first few months of
1990.</p>
<p>Rather than cut capital investment for an expected
short-term lull in demand, producers are gearing up for a
battle for the 4-megabit semiconductor market, the latest in
a series of increasingly powerful chips to be mass-produced.</p>
<p>At present, such Japanese semiconductor makers as Hitachi
Corp., Toshiba Corp. and NEC Corp. are planning to hold
capital investment spending at last year's levels. But
ultimately, investment plans will depend on how quickly the
4-megabit market expands.</p>
<p>"We're optimistic that the market is gradually on the
upswing," a Hitachi spokesman said. "Depending on market
conditions, we may expand {our capital investment plans}
beyond 95 billion yen." The spokesman said the company is
expecting makers of computers, including personal computers
and workstations, to aggressively incorporate the 4-megabit
chip into their products.</p>
<p>"We're currently producing 500,000 4-megabit chips a
month. By the summer, we'll expand production to one million
chips a month and by the end of the year, we'll be producing
two million a month," the spokesman added.</p>
<p>Other chip makers said they're taking a wait-and-see
attitude to see how strongly demand grows.</p>
<p>"We still don't know how quickly the market {for 4-megabit
chips} will grow," said a spokeswoman for NEC. She said mass
production of 4-megabit chips has just begun, but demand
could prove strong by the second half of the year.</p>
<p>A Mitsubishi Electric Corp. spokesman said his company had
planned to reduce 1990 capital investment by about 22% on the
belief that the 4-megabit market wouldn't take off until
1991.</p>
<p>But the spokesman said Mitsubishi Electric will adjust its
spending plans should the 4-megabit market blossom early. In
the end, he said, capital outlays for fiscal 1990 could equal
1989 outlays.</p>
<p>"Nobody knows what they're going to be producing by the
end of the year," said Steven W. Myers, senior industrial
electronics analyst with Jardine Fleming Securities Ltd. in
Tokyo. With market conditions so unclear, makers can say what
their capacity will be, but they can't say what their
production will be, Mr. Myers added.</p>
<p>Although rising optimism among Japanese semiconductor
makers could lead to a general increase in capital investment
plans this year, Mr. Myers said he doesn't expect to see
supply far outdistance demand.</p>
<p>"We're not going to see a war of attrition like we saw in
the mid-80s," Mr. Myers said. He said such a "bloodbath,"
with makers losing heavily as they expanded production in
pursuit of market share, won't be tolerated either
politically or economically this time around.</p>
<p>Mr. Myers said Japanese makers already cut back production
in late 1989 when supply appeared to be outstripping demand.</p>
<p>Japanese makers' investment as a proportion of sales this
year will be around 23% to 24%, far below the 40% level in
the mid-1980s, Mr. Myers said.</p>
<p>He said the strength of Japanese investment in
semiconductor capacity doesn't necessarily imply that U.S.
makers are in danger of being overwhelmed. He said such
leading U.S. players as Motorola Inc., Texas Instruments Inc.
and Intel Corp. have strengths which should give them staying
power in the market.</p>
