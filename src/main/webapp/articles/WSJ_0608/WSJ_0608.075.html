	<p class="article-leader">LOS ANGELES -- Pathe Communications Corp. said Time Warner
Inc. agreed to amend its accord to provide a $650 million
loan to Pathe, which is seeking to acquire MGM/UA
Communications Co. for $1.27 billion. Pathe also gave itself
another week to complete its $20-a-share tender offer for the
studio.
   Observers have been skeptical about the bid by Pathe and
its chairman, Italian financier Giancarlo Parretti, but Time
Warner apparently is anxious to do whatever it takes to get
the deal done. The change in the agreement would allow Pathe
to retain more revenue from the new films it would produce
after acquiring the studio, a move that also would make it
easier for Pathe to borrow money.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>If the transaction is completed, Time Warner would get
distribution rights to MGM/UA's valuable library and Pathe's
new films in return for the loan. Time Warner has a lien on
the library as security for the loan, and also warrants that
could give it 20% of the new company.</p>
<p>Pathe also said its offer, which was set to expire
yesterday, has again been extended, this time to June 15. It
can't be extended beyond June 23, according to the initial
purchase pact. Pathe has already deposited $150 million in
cash toward the purchase price, and a fourth $50 million down
payment is due tomorrow.</p>
<p>The original agreement with Time Warner provided that
Warner Bros. would collect a distribution fee on the library
and Pathe's new films, and that Pathe would be required to
devote 65% of its remaining revenue to repaying the loan. The
amended agreement allows Pathe to retain 100% of the new film
revenues, after distribution fees, though it still must repay
the loan; the agreement on the library revenue remains the
same.</p>
<p>"This gives us flexibility," said the Pathe spokesman.</p>
<p>Pathe said it had also obtained a commitment for $125
million in production loans from a bank and was discussing
with Time Warner whether that would fulfill an agreement to
obtain $200 million.</p>
<p>Pathe also provided details about the additional $450
million to be advanced to Pathe by Luxembourg-based
Comfinance S.A., the closely held vehicle for Mr. Parretti.
First of all, Pathe said it only needed $366 million, not
$450 million, which will be provided in return for stock in
the new company. The funds primarily will come from various
lines of credit from other affiliated companies of Mr.
Parretti.</p>
<p>The details seem to indicate that Pathe has arranged the
financing without MGM/UA majority shareholder Kirk Kerkorian
having to retain a stake, but an MGM/UA spokesman said Mr.
Kerkorian hadn't made a final decision.</p>
<p>The Time Warner agreement stipulates that Pathe's
additional funding must be in debt, not equity, and
negotiations with Time Warner are still going on over this
issue, said the Pathe spokesman.</p>
<p>Although some cynical observers have maintained that Time
Warner's aim is to see Pathe default so it can grab the
library, Warner Bros. Chairman Robert Daly dismisses the
idea.</p>
<p>"This is not a deal that we make and hope he goes
bankrupt," said Mr. Daly in an interview recently. "If Pathe
does well and they make eight or ten movies a year, we have a
distribution services agreement with them. So the upside of
this deal could be great and that's what we are really
betting on."</p>
<p>In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday,
MGM/UA shares closed unchanged at $18.25, and Pathe shares
fell 37.5 cents to close at $4.</p>
