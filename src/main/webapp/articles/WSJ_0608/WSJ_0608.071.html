	<p class="article-leader">Rupert Murdoch's News Corp. said it will make a public
offering of 49% of its Hong Kong newspaper business, which
includes the South China Morning Post, Hong Kong's largest
English-language daily.
   Sydney, Australia-based News Corp., which said last month
it would sell off an undisclosed portion of South China
Morning Post Holdings Ltd., didn't specify how much it
intends to raise through the offer. The company said it plans
to provide further details Monday at a news conference.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Outside estimates of the newspaper's value range from four
billion to five billion Hong Kong dollars (US$514.1 million
to US$642.7 million). The sale comes as News Corp. attempts
to sell some of its assets to cut the almost $7 billion in
debt created by an aggressive acquisition spree in recent
years.</p>
<p>News Corp. said it has applied to the Hong Kong Stock
Exchange to list the South China Morning Post's entire issued
capital of 1.5 billion ordinary shares. But the company said
it will keep 51% of the shares, retaining the majority
holding.</p>
<p>The public will be offered 17.5% of the Post's shares,
while an additional 17.5% will be placed with institutional
and professional investors. United Overseas Bank Ltd. has
agreed to acquire a further 9% of the shares, while Singapore
Press Holdings Ltd. will acquire 5%.</p>
