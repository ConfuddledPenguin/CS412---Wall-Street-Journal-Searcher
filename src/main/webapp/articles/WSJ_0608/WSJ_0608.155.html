	<p class="article-leader">ConAgra Inc. agreed to acquire Beatrice Co. from Kohlberg
Kravis Roberts & Co. for a scaled-back $1.34 billion in cash
and stock.
   The price is about half the amount some Beatrice insiders
boasted the food company would fetch just before the October
1987 crash dashed those expectations. KKR still will profit
substantially, with a 50% annualized return from its
four-year ownership of Beatrice. The transaction price,
however, apparently also was below KKR's more-recent hopes.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"They kept saying our {offers} were way too low," Charles
M. (Mike) Harper, ConAgra chairman and chief executive
officer, said in an interview last night. But the acquisition
includes assumption of $987 million of long-term debt, an
additional $552 million in other noncurrent liabilities plus
$419 million in noncurrent and deferred taxes. More than half
of Beatrice's $3.5 billion in assets is good will, reflecting
the premium above book value that Beatrice has paid for
various acquisitions over the years.</p>
<p>Among the household name-brands ConAgra would acquire are
Hunt's tomato products, Wesson oil, Orville Redenbacher
popcorn and Peter Pan peanut butterstrong brands that will
vastly enhance ConAgra's clout in the dry grocery business.
The company already is the nation's second-largest food
processor, behind the Kraft General Foods unit of Philip
Morris Cos. The transaction is subject to government
clearances.</p>
<p>The proposed sale represents the last chunk of a
much-larger Beatrice that KKR swallowed for $8.2 billion in
1986. Since then, KKR has sold off 10 major pieces for a
total of about $7.7 billion.</p>
<p>Terms call for ConAgra to pay $626 million in cash plus
$355 million in common stock and an identical amount in two
series of preferred stock for Beatrice. The company said the
proposed acquisition was not expected to dilute per-share
earnings, and it forecast record earnings for the year just
under way.</p>
<p>For the fiscal year ended last May 28, ConAgra is expected
to report sales approaching $16 billion. In its latest fiscal
year, which ended last Feb. 28, Beatrice reported sales of
$4.3 billion. Thus a combined concern could easily exceed $20
billion in annual sales.</p>
<p>KKR will end up, on a fully diluted basis, owning 15% of
ConAgra. KKR founding partner Henry Kravis indicated that KKR
intends to hold its ConAgra stake long-term, calling the
shares "excellent investments."</p>
<p>While announcement of the proposed deal came after the
stock market had closed, Wall Street analysts initially
reacted favorably. "There's a very good fit," said Goldman,
Sachs & Co. food analyst Nomi Ghez, who noted that ConAgra
was acquiring Beatrice at less than 60% of its annual sales.
Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. analyst John M. McMillin
noted that ConAgra "has an insatiable appetite for cheap
assets."</p>
<p>But both Moody's Investor Service Inc. and Standard &
Poor's Corp. debt-rating services put ConAgra under immediate
review for possible downgrading of some of it debt, although
Moody's said it anticipates "significant benefits" to ConAgra
from Beatrice's consumer food lines.</p>
<p>Acknowledging that "we stretched our balance sheet
standard {of 35% long-term debt} on this," Mr. Harper said
the acquisition would put ConAgra at nearly 50% debt. "But we
intend to get back to 35% as soon as practical," he vowed,
noting that Beatrice has good cash flows.</p>
<p>ConAgra, which is particularly strong in the red-meat
business, features such brands as Armour in meats, Banquet,
Healthy Choice and Morton in frozen foods, and Chun King and
Patio in ethnic prepared foods.</p>
<p>There are some product overlaps. For example, in Chinese
foods Beatrice has LaChoy, while ConAgra already owns a
peanut-butter brand. Also, because both companies are major
forces in the prepared-meats business, government regulators
may study the proposal for antitrust implications.</p>
<p>But Mr. Harper, asked about that, said he wasn't worried.
"We think we're below the threshold of their concern level.
We feel very confident about that." He said ConAgra was
particularly attracted by Beatrice's sales and distribution
system in the dry-grocery business, where it now is an
also-ran.</p>
<p>ConAgra, which Mr. Harper likes to say dominates "the
middle of the plate," has been an aggressive food-business
buyer. In 1986 it bought RJR Nabisco's frozen-food unit,
including the Patio and Chun King brands, for $64 million; in
1987 it acquired Monfort, a large Colorado beef and lamb
concern, and in 1988 it added to its phalanx of flour mills
by picking up those of International Multifoods Corp. for $76
million. Last year it added Pillsbury Co.'s
grain-merchandising business, but lost out in a protracted
bidding war with Tyson Foods Inc. for Holly Farms Corp., a
large poultry processor.</p>
<p>The assets ConAgra seeks include 63 manufacturing or
distribution facilities in 20 states and 15,900 employees at
Chicago-based Beatrice. ConAgra already employs more than
55,000 people world-wide and has operations in 25 countries.</p>
<p>ConAgra shares closed at $32, up 75 cents, in composite
New York Stock Exchange trading yesterday. Volume was
relatively light, indicating that both parties had managed to
keep a lid on the proposal.</p>
<p>Mr. Harper said the first discussion came while he was
riding a chairlift with investment banker Eric Gleacher in
Colorado, while skiing last January. Yesterday's acquisition
accord caps at least four months of talks between KKR and
ConAgra, following a get-acquainted meeting between Messrs.
Kravis and Harper.</p>
<p>Mr. Kravis came away from those talks "impressed, talking
about how he would love to do something with Mike Harper," a
witness recalled.</p>
<p>Beatrice in its current form has been shrunk almost
two-thirds from its sprawling size when KKR acquired the
company in 1986, as units such as Avis, Tropicana and Playtex
have been sold off. Nonetheless, the remaining core of the
business has proved tough for KKR to sell, mainly because of
possible tax liabilities and $1.8 billion of goodwill, an
accounting item that penalizes reported earnings.</p>
<p>To finally sell Beatrice this spring, KKR asked that
ConAgra "get comfortable with the contingent liabilities"
before visiting Beatrice's operating units, said a KKR
adviser. That strategy was designed to avoid jitters that had
affected previous potential buyers, who liked Beatrice's
operating businesses but pulled back when they examined its
books more closely.</p>
<p>On May 15, top ConAgra officials visited KKR's offices and
worked out the outlines of an acquisition agreement. ConAgra
then visited Beatrice sites in detail, and checked with
rating agencies to ensure that the debt involved in the
Beatrice acquisition wouldn't hurt its credit rating too
severely.</p>
<p>Yesterday at 7:30 a.m., the Beatrice board held a
three-hour meeting at KKR's New York offices to approve the
proposed acquisition, while ConAgra did the same in Omaha. A
witness said that while the Beatrice board's vote was
unanimous, it was a "difficult" moment for Donald Kelly, the
former Beatrice chairman who had played a major role in
reshaping Beatrice in the first two years after the 1986
buy-out.</p>
<p>In recent months, KKR -- which was by far the most active
takeover player of the 1980s -- has become noticeably less
active in seeking to take over entire companies. Instead, KKR
has been selling some of its portfolio companies and taking
minority stakes in publicly quoted companies.</p>
