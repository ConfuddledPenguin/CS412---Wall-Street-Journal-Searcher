	<p class="article-leader">PARIS -- In a further sign of warming East-West relations,
the U.S. and its 16 main Western allies agreed to ease their
41-year-old embargo on sales of high-technology products to
the East bloc.
   The agreement, reached at a two-day meeting of allied
officials here, authorizes a major liberalization of
technology-trade restrictions to the East. All export curbs
will end for most Western personal computers and other
commonly available technology products. More important, the
allies agreed to greatly reduce restrictions on sales of
mainframe computers, telephone exchanges, machine tools and
other more-sophisticated products.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The accord, based on a Bush administration proposal
announced May 2, opens the door to East-West trade in a wide
range of technology products. As one indication of the
accord's importance, U.S. officials said the products
involved currently make up about $45 billion, or 30%, of
annual U.S. technology exports around the world. The East
hasn't enough hard currency to place orders anywhere near
that volume. But Western businesses expect the accord to
allow a gradual rise in direct sales to the East, and an
immediate surge in East-West technology joint ventures.</p>
<p>Many Western businesses cheered the accord, even though
some had urged even greater liberalization. "We are very
pleased," said a spokesman in Armonk, N.Y., for International
Business Machines Corp. "This represents substantial
progress." An official of the West German Industry Federation
called the accord "a step forward" in East-West trade.</p>
<p>The pact also was attacked by some U.S. conservatives.
This "ill-advised" accord will "enable the Soviets for far
less {effort} to field far more capable military forces in
the future," said Frank Gaffney Jr., a former Pentagon
official who heads the Center for Security Policy, a
conservative Washington think tank.</p>
<p>Before sales can begin, the agreement has to be
implemented by laws or rules in each of the 17 countries
participating in the trade organization, called the
Coordinating Committee on Multilateral Export Controls, or
Cocom. The 17 countries are the U.S., Japan, Australia, and
all of the West European countries except Iceland that belong
to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.</p>
<p>Commerce Secretary Robert Mosbacher, who helped craft the
U.S. proposal to Cocom, said the U.S. strategy of
"differentiation" prevailed over West European plans to treat
the Soviet Union and the East European countries essentially
the same way. Cocom's decision to reward the more-democratic
Eastern European countries with higher technology could
induce the Soviets to "move towards the same direction," he
said.</p>
<p>Mr. Mosbacher said he expects both the former East bloc
nations and U.S. companies to take advantage of the
opportunities being opened. "American companies are going to
leap into Eastern Europe," he predicted. And their presence
could help to "jump-start" those nations' economies.</p>
<p>The success of the Paris meeting proves that Cocom is
"very much alive," he said. Cocom will have to closely watch
how the special provisions for East Germany work, but after
the two Germanys unite they will be "treated like any other
Cocom member," he said.</p>
