	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Reports on monetary policy in Switzerland and
Australia sparked traders' interest against a background of
mixed U.S. dollar dealings.
   The Swiss franc fell against the dollar and other
currencies on a news-service dispatch, later termed
misleading, about comments made Wednesday by Swiss National
Bank Chairman Markus Lusser in San Francisco. The market took
the report as a sign that the central bank might soon ease
its tight monetary policy.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Meanwhile, a comment by Australian Treasurer Paul Keating
that the nation's monetary policy would stay tight drove the
Australian dollar higher.</p>
<p>In other activity, the U.S. dollar extended its gradual
rise against the mark, but slipped slightly against the yen.
U.S. dollar dealings were characterized by participants as
slow, amid a general dearth of news on which to trade.</p>
<p>But the U.S. currency leapt against its Swiss counterpart
after traders seized on the news-service report. The report
appeared to signal a change in tone by Mr. Lusser, who in the
past has vowed to do whatever is necessary to maintain the
strength of the franc, meaning in practice a policy of
relatively high interest rates.</p>
<p>But a central bank official later termed the report
misleading, and added that the bank hasn't any intention of
easing policy soon. The bank raised its Lombard rate to
10.875% from 10.75%.</p>
<p>In Australia, Mr. Keating said the continued tight grip on
money is needed to prevent a rebound in spending. He said it
will be some time before policy can be relaxed, because the
country's inflation and current account deficit are too high.</p>
<p>In late afternoon New York trading, the dollar was at
1.6935 marks, up from 1.6885 marks late Wednesday, and at
152.55 yen, down from 152.65 yen. Sterling was at $1.6890, up
from $1.6875.</p>
<p>The dollar was at 1.4445 Swiss francs, up from 1.4360
francs late Wednesday. The Australian dollar was at 77.75
U.S. cents, up from 77.23 U.S. cents.</p>
<p>In Tokyo Friday, the dollar was trading at 152.55 yen soon
after opening at 152.58 yen; it closed in Tokyo Thursday at
152.55 yen. Meanwhile, the U.S. currency was trading at about
1.6925 marks, up from Thursday's Tokyo close of 1.6884 marks.</p>
<p>In other dealings, the U.S. dollar continued to strengthen
against its West German counterpart, which has been weakening
in past days on nervousness about labor unrest in East
Germany.</p>
<p>A nationwide strike by retail, restaurant and other
workers at small, independent businesses has been called for
today. They are protesting terms of the planned integration
of the two Germanys July 2, which employers' groups have said
would result in the near-term loss of as many as 350,000
jobs.</p>
<p>In Europe, the U.S. dollar was mostly firmer, although the
currency continues trading in well-established bands. In
Tokyo, the U.S. dollar was narrowly mixed in thin trading.</p>
<p>Separately, U.S. monetary authorities sold $1.78 billion
for yen and marks in the three months ended April 30,
according to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.</p>
<p>While the level of intervention was greater than the $750
million sold for yen in the November-January period, it was
small relative to other recent periods, and mainly was
intended to moderate the dollar's rise against the yen, the
Fed said. In the May-July quarter of 1989, the U.S. sold a
record $11.92 billion.</p>
<p>For the year ended Jan. 31, the Fed spent approximately
$21 billion in intervention operations, according to Sam Y.
Cross, executive vice president of the New York Fed in charge
of its foreign group, who presented the Fed's quarterly
foreign-exchange report to Congress.</p>
<p>The Fed sold $1.58 billion to buy yen during the most
recent period, and $200 million to buy marks, often in
concert with the central banks of other Group of Seven
industrial nations, Mr. Cross said. G-7 nations include the
U.S., Japan, Britain, West Germany, France, Italy and Canada.</p>
<p>Mr. Cross said the Fed didn't intervene against any other
currencies in the period. The Fed does, however, occasionally
act as agent for other central banks.</p>
<p>The dollar rose 10% against the yen and fell less than
0.5% against the mark on balance during the period, Mr. Cross
said.</p>
<p>The Fed didn't comment on any current activities in the
currency market.</p>
<p>On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for current
delivery fell $2.80, to $354.60 an ounce. Estimated volume
was a moderate 3.5 million ounces.</p>
<p>In Hong Kong Friday, gold was quoted at $354.25 an ounce.</p>
