	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- Consumer debt barely grew in April, weighed
down mainly by a plunge in car loans, the Federal Reserve
said.
   Consumer installment credit outstanding -- generally all
forms of personal debt but mortgages -- grew a scant $584
million in April, amounting to an annual growth rate of 1%,
the Fed said. That followed annual growth rates of 4% in
March and 0.1% in February, both far smaller than most gains
last year and weaker than many economists had predicted.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Consumer credit has expanded at a faint pace all year.
Many economists say the slowdown mainly reflects a new
caution among consumers in response to uncertain economic
conditions.</p>
<p>"Consumer spending had held up pretty well through the
first quarter, but it has begun to weaken a bit, as has the
job market and income gains," said Sandra Shaber, an
economist for the Futures Group. "So we can't take consumer
spending as much for granted as we had." She noted that the
expansion of consumer debt has slipped behind personal-income
gains during the past six months.</p>
<p>Automobile loans, which fell in two of the past three
months, tumbled at a 10.3% annual rate during the month, a
drop of $2.5 billion. But revolving credit, which includes
mostly short-term debt such as credit-card and bank-card
borrowing, shot up $2.4 billion, or at a 14% annual rate.</p>
<p>The numbers were adjusted for seasonal fluctuations.
Without adjusting, consumer installment credit outstanding
stood at $715.82 billion at the end of April, up 4.3% from a
year earlier.</p>
