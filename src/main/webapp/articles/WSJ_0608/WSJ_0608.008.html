	<p class="article-leader">Clark Clifford has given me astute and honest counsel
throughout most of my 40-year tenure on Wall Street.
   I was therefore greatly distressed to read your May 3
page-one article on the Bank of Credit and Commerce
International (for which Mr. Clifford is a lawyer).</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>For more than 50 years Mr. Clifford has been a respected
adviser and friend to U.S. presidents, regardless of party
affiliation. He has served and upheld the laws of this
country without prejudice.</p>
<p>Your article twists facts and implicates by innuendo.</p>
