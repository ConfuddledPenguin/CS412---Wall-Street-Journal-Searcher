	<p class="article-leader">ATLANTA -- Earlier this year, when the Atlanta Braves
decided to dispense with a team slogan for the 1990 baseball
season, the local newspaper asked readers what tag they would
attach to the club. Their suggestions?
   "Atlanta Braves -- Still in the Major Leagues]"</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"It Just Doesn't Get Any Better Than This -- Ever]"</p>
<p>Subtle enough? Try one more:</p>
<p>"Mathematical Elimination Fever -- Catch It]"</p>
<p>That pretty well sums up 25 years of frustration on the
part of local baseball fans. Since moving to Atlanta in 1966,
the Braves have never won a pennant, never mind a World
Series. The last time they won even a divisional championship
was eight years ago. This year, the team is well on its way
to its seventh straight losing season and is already locked
in a close contest for last place in the National League's
Western Division.</p>
<p>Not surprisingly, finding a seat at Atlanta-Fulton County
Stadium, the home of the Braves, is rather easy these days.
With only 12,000 people or so passing through the turnstiles
for each game -- the lowest attendance in the majors -- the
average Atlantan has a choice of about 40,000-odd seats for
any home date.</p>
<p>All of this misery, however, overlooks one poignant point:
Few clubs in the major leagues have tried harder to get fans
out to the park. And yet no one has had worse luck -- or, on
occasion, has proved more inept -- at doing that than the
Braves.</p>
<p>Simply put, nothing seems to go right. Not the weather
(Opening Day this year wasn't simply rained out, it was
tornadoed out); not the team's promotions (a disk jockey was
once invited to dive into the "world's largest bowl of ice
cream" and had to be hauled out of a vat of chocolate muck
when he almost drowned); and definitely not its choice this
year of a celebrity endorser (Ernest P. Worrell, of "Ernest
Goes to Jail" movie fame, whose rubbery face has been roundly
booed by fans when flashed on the stadium scoreboard).</p>
<p>Some people say the problem is that team owner Ted Turner
spends more on his cable empire than on what is still being
billed, frightfully, as "America's Team." But Mr. Turner, who
reports losing $7.4 million on the Braves last year along
with 97 games, demurs. "We've tried spending exorbitant
amounts of money and we've tried not spending exorbitantly,"
he says. "If I knew what to do differently, I'd have already
done it."</p>
<p>Take last October. Please. At the end of the season, the
Braves were so close to the million mark in attendance they
could taste it. Facing the final weekend series, against the
Los Angeles Dodgers, they needed only 19,910 fans to make it.
The team got a big break when Chrysler Corp. bought a block
of 10,000 tickets for Friday night. Saturday was Fan
Appreciation Night, which, with all the giveaways, seemed a
guaranteed 25,000 to 30,000 seats sold. And that left Sunday
as gravy.</p>
<p>Then, it rained. And rained. Friday and Saturday were
washed out, and on Sunday, the last day of the season, only
4,840 fans showed, leaving the Braves 15,070 short of a
million. "We don't even like to think about it," says Jack
Tyson, director of ticket sales.</p>
<p>Under fire from all sides, Braves loyalists like to dredge
up the old days, when things were really bad. The latest
issue of the Tomahawk Times, the Braves' booster-club
newsletter, reminds members that in 1935, when the Braves
were in their original home town of Boston, the team went
38-115, finishing 61 1/2 games out of first. And they had
Babe Ruth.</p>
<p>"We're not really playing bad," contends booster-club
president Wayne Coleman. "It's just that the other team has a
tendency to score at least one more run than we do."</p>
<p>That tendency makes life particularly tough for the Braves
marketing department. Saddled with a team that is perennially
short on athletic talent, the sales staff over the years has
concocted some of the most bizarre, and sometimes tasteless,
promotions in the annals of baseball.</p>
<p>In the mid-1970s in particular, after Mr. Turner bought
the team, the ballpark became a virtual circus. Aerialists
walked across wires suspended from the roof of the stadium;
ostriches raced around the outfield; ponies were given away
as door prizes.</p>
<p>On one memorable evening in 1976, nine couples were
married at home plate and were quickly followed by a
professional wrestling match. It was called "Wedlock and
Headlock Night."</p>
<p>And those were the good promotions. The team also
sponsored Braves Halter-Top Night, a Farrah Fawcett-Majors
Look-Alike Contest and an on-field wet T-shirt contest. "It
was a disgrace, but you couldn't disgrace our team in those
days," says the Braves' former publicity director, Bob Hope.</p>
<p>These days, the Braves' promotions seem to lack hope. What
famous personality was on hand to pose for snapshots with
children at a recent game? Slugger Henry Aaron? Pitching
legend Phil Neikro? Nope. It was the Vlasic Pickles Stork.
And it's hard to find anyone with a kind word for what is
generally considered a geeky-looking mascot called "Homer the
Brave," a baseball-uniformed body with an oversized plastic
Indian head topped with a Mohawk.</p>
<p>Often, the Braves' biggest draw is the other team. At a
recent Cubs-Braves game in Atlanta, the loudest cheers came
from a sea of Cub-blue hats and shirts when Chicago's Andre
Dawson slugged a two-run homer. Hanging from the left-field
wall was a spray-painted sheet that read: "Lost Cubs Fan:
Please Return to Wrigley Field."</p>
<p>"I don't think the fans are angry with the Atlanta
Braves," says Danny Goodwin, the optimistically named Braves
director of community affairs. Mr. Goodwin is sometimes
introduced as the "Bravest Man in Atlanta" for appearing
before the Rotary Club and other groups to field questions
about the team. "We're an outlet to vent frustrations from
bills, the job, whatever," he says.</p>
<p>Frustrations with the Braves themselves are currently
being vented in the form of suggestions from local marketing
types on how the team might put some fans in the stands. One
advertising director has suggested a Frequent Suffering Bonus
system, in which Braves fans earn points, redeemable for
prizes, based on the number of innings they endure.</p>
<p>Another idea is called the Guaranteed Win Plan. Fans who
attend a game that the Braves lose could keep coming back for
free until the team manages to win.</p>
<p>But to fill stands, winning still is the dominant factor.
In 1982, when the team sailed into the National League
playoffs (only to be swept by St. Louis), 1.8 million fans
poured through the gates. In 1983, a record 2.1 million
showed up to cheer the team into second place, without a
single ostrich appearance.</p>
<p>At the current rate, the Braves will draw about 960,000.</p>
<p>Despite all their woes, the Braves have had the most
consistently loyal fan in all of baseball. Before this season
started, Pearl Sandow is said to have shown up for all 1,899
home games the Atlanta Braves had played since relocating
from Milwaukee in 1966. Honoring her achievement, the
Baseball Hall of Fame last summer immortalized her with a
statue in Cooperstown, N.Y.</p>
<p>In February, the septuagenarian Hall of Famer fell and
broke her shoulders. Now, Ms. Sandow watches the games on
television. When she gets off the disabled list, though,
she'll be back in the spot she had occupied for 24 years:
Section 105, Row 9, Seat 1.</p>
<p>For her, there is really no other choice. As she explains
it, "Bad baseball is better than no baseball at all."</p>
