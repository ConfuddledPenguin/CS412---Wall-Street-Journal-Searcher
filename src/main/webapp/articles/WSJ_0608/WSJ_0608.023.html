	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- The world's industrial economies are growing
at a steady but slowing pace, latest figures indicate.
   The Conference Board, a business information service, said
its International Economic Scoreboard shows that the
composite leading index for 11 major industrial countries is
growing at a 1% annual rate, down slightly from the 2% growth
rate three months ago and 3% rate six months ago. The figure
suggests slower growth ahead, the report said.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The report looks at leading indicators, or measures
thought to signal economic turns because they generally rise
or fall in advance of the general economy. The report for the
most part covers statistics as current as February and March.</p>
<p>The Pacific region continues to show the greatest
strength, especially in Taiwan, where the leading index is
growing at an 8% annual rate; Korea's rate is 5%. Growth has
slowed in New Zealand, 1%, and Japan, 0%.</p>
<p>"The weakest economy among these 11 countries is still
Australia, where the long drop in the leading index --
declining at a 6% rate -- looks more and more like a
recession," the report said.</p>
<p>In Europe, growth rates are "essentially flat," except for
West Germany's 5% annual growth rate. Others include Italy,
2%, France, -1% and the United Kingdom, -3%.</p>
<p>In Canada, the leading index is growing at a 1% rate while
in the U.S. the leading index is flat.</p>
<p>The indexes are compiled monthly by the Center for
International Business Cycle Research at the Columbia
University Business School.</p>
