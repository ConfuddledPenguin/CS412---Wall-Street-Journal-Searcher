	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- The creditors' committee of Drexel Burnham
Lambert Group Inc. rejected the company's reorganization
proposal and said it will ask the bankruptcy court to let it
take the lead in coming up with a workable plan.
   The committee said its proposal will call for the ouster
of Drexel's board and management. In an unusual arrangement,
the plan also will set up an independent trust responsible
for going after the $260 million in bonuses that Drexel paid
its executives just weeks before filing for bankruptcy-law
protection. Recovery of the bonuses, however, would only be
sought if the sale of assets doesn't bring in enough money to
pay creditors.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The creditors' committee is proposing that it and other
groups representing shareholders and subsidiaries' creditors
organize a search committee to find a new chairman for
Drexel.</p>
<p>The committee voted unanimously to reject Drexel's
preliminary proposal, which was unveiled Wednesday. While
Drexel's proposal was light on specifics, the creditors'
committee will file "a detailed plan, a full-blown plan" with
the court on Monday, said Wilbur Ross, senior managing
director of Rothschild Inc., the committee's financial
adviser.</p>
<p>The plan will be filed along with a motion asking federal
bankruptcy court Judge Howard Buschman III not to extend the
time period during which only Drexel can officially propose a
reorganization plan under Chapter 11. Drexel hasn't yet filed
a plan with the court and has said its preliminary proposal
earlier this week merely meant the negotiations of a plan
were under way.</p>
<p>"The committee was quite unhappy with essential elements
of the Drexel plan," said Mr. Ross.</p>
<p>A Drexel spokesman said, "The proper forum for discussing
these issues is in the court, and there is a hearing set for
Tuesday at which they will be discussed." The hearing will be
in Judge Buschman's chambers in federal bankruptcy court in
New York.</p>
<p>Similar to Drexel's proposal, the committee's plan calls
for issuing securities backed by the company's assets,
estimated at about $2 billion. The notes, with maturities
staggered over three years, would be paid off as assets are
liquidated, Mr. Ross said. Unlike Drexel's plan, the
securities could be publicly traded immediately, Mr. Ross
said -- rather than having to be held for 30 months.</p>
<p>Some creditors would be paid cash immediately, depending
on how much money is available when the reorganization plan
is confirmed. Mr. Ross said all creditors would be paid
securities or cash for 100% of the amount owed.</p>
<p>If the liquidation of assets doesn't bring in enough money
to pay creditors, then the bonus payments would be targeted.
Under the creditors' proposal a separate trust would be
formed to pursue litigation to recover the bonuses, Mr. Ross
said. Bankruptcy attorneys say the payments could be
recoverable if Drexel was insolvent at the time or if the
payments were unreasonable.</p>
