	<p class="article-leader">As the Senate revs up to pass campaign-reform legislation,
enthusiasts should recall how the last batch of "reforms"
turned out. As usual, the do-gooders seem to have done more
good for themselves than for the general public.
   Last year's "reform" of congressional ethics turned out to
be a back-door pay raise for members of Congress.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The "reform" of franked mail regulations was heralded as
curtailing the free mailings that have given incumbents an
almost insurmountable advantage over challengers. But in the
House the cost of such mailings has practically doubled --
from the $41 million budgeted for this year to an estimated
$79 million.</p>
<p>No wonder Congress loves "reform."</p>
<p>And no wonder the public is unenthusiastic about the
campaign-reform legislation gathering steam in the Senate.</p>
<p>The measures being negotiated behind closed doors are
another example of incumbent self-perpetuation disguised as
statesmanship. The evils to be vanquished are "unlimited
spending," according to the Democrats, and "special
interests," according to the Republicans.</p>
<p>But the Democrats really want full public financing of
campaigns and even greater perks and security for incumbents.
(Most incumbents are Democrats.) The Republicans really want
to block the Democrats without appearing to be against
"reform." So the enterprise boils down not to the Democrats
vs. the Republicans, but to the Incumbents vs. the
Challengers -- the Imperial Congress vs. the Voters.</p>
<p>Campaigns cost too much, say the Democrats. In speeches
introducing their bill, they bemoaned "the money chase {that}
has corrupted the political process of this country" and "the
escalating arms race of fund-raising that is destroying the
system." Their prescription: public funding and overall
campaign spending limits.</p>
<p>Democrats stress the spending limits are voluntary, but
apparently no one will volunteer without the lure of
substantial government benefits: low-cost television time,
subsidized campaign mail (there they go again), and public
money to match money spent by independent groups and
"excessive" spending by an opponent.</p>
<p>To collect all these goodies, the incumbent merely has to
promise not to spend more than a certain limit. But if the
challenger, swimming upstream against the powerful current of
incumbent advantage, spends more than the limit, the
incumbent gets millions more in public money, and the
spending limit is removed.</p>
<p>Republicans oppose spending limits. The centerpiece of
their "reform" proposal is the abolition of political action
committees. PACs, so it is argued, are "special interests"
that dominate campaigns and give more to incumbents than
challengers.</p>
<p>The Democrats recently jumped on the "Kill PACs"
bandwagon, and the good-government forces are now shifting
into bipartisan high gear.</p>
<p>Initial posturing is completed. Partisan positions are
staked out. Bipartisan negotiations are under way. Now,
observe the next step in this typical dance: In the coming
weeks a bipartisan compromise is likely to emerge, and there
will be much back-patting among the reformers -- Democrats
and Republicans alike. If scientists measure the hot air
coming from the Senate wing of the Capitol, they'll probably
identify it as a critical source of global warming.</p>
<p>The truth is, there always have been "special interests"
in American politics, and there should be. People get into
politics because they are interested in something, mad about
something, or want to get something done. If teachers, oil
workers or accountants have a beef with Washington and want
to band together to support or oppose a candidate for
Congress -- what's wrong with that?</p>
<p>Nothing. It's one of the animating principles of our
Constitution. Madison explains in "The Federalist Papers"
that a multiplicity of "interests" are fundamental to
republican government. De Tocqueville observed: "As soon as
several inhabitants of the United States have taken up an
opinion or feeling they wish to promote . . . and as soon as
they have found one another out, they combine. From that
moment they are no longer isolated men, but a power seen from
afar, whose . . . language is listened to." Perhaps the
moralists and would-be reformers of today should reflect upon
De Tocqueville's conclusion that the banding together of
citizens to promote these "special interests" enhanced both
individual rights and the common good.</p>
<p>PACs make "special interest" money both public and
accountable. The alternative, at least in the past, was that
special interests exerted influence behind closed doors. Read
Robert Caro's latest book on President Johnson: During the
1948 Senate campaign, Johnson aides took $50,000 cash
donations from oil tycoons in paper bags, he claims.</p>
<p>In the last campaign, PAC money for all Senate races
constituted an estimated 23% of campaign money, vs. 64% from
individuals. And, like PACs, individuals also gave more to
incumbents than they did to challengers. Eliminating PACs
makes no more sense than eliminating individual
contributions.</p>
<p>Most important, eliminating PACs probably would be
unconstitutional. In Buckley v. Valeo, the Supreme Court left
no doubt that campaign contributions and expenditures are
protected as a form of expression by the First Amendment. And
PACs, as voluntary associations of free citizens seeking
lawful political aims, are protected by the Constitution as
well.</p>
<p>Also in dubious constitutional standing are the provisions
in the Democratic bill that guarantee that public revenues
will be used to match "excessive" spending by an opponent or
by PACs or other independent groups. What does it do to the
protected political expression of a challenger who, as he
spends more money -- as he must necessarily do -- to take on
a powerful incumbent, has his expression effectively
nullified by an ever larger public subsidy flowing to the
incumbent?</p>
<p>Granting reduced TV broadcast rates and mail costs to
candidates using public money, while denying them to those
using private money, is also likely to run afoul of the First
Amendment. The American Civil Liberties Union calls this
"effort to micromanage the content of political speech . . .
wholly inappropriate and unconstitutional," declaring:
"Surely, there is no justification for allowing a publicly
benefitted candidate to pay only 25% of the price of a
first-class stamp, while a privately financed candidate pays
full rate."</p>
<p>Incumbents claim they're forced to spend too much time
chasing campaign money, at the expense of their jobs in
Congress. If that is true, why is last year's average for
roll-call-vote attendance 94% in the House and 98% in the
Senate? How do members find the time to act on bills
designating "National Tap Dance Day" or "National Juke Box
Week"?</p>
<p>Then there is the claim that campaigns are too expensive.
Put it in perspective: $459 million was spent in the last
election on all House and Senate campaigns. That's less than
the amount spent to advertise just snacks and soft drinks on
network TV: $492.8 million. In 1988, each of 52 American
companies spent more on advertising alone than the combined
cost of all the campaigns for the U.S. Senate that year.</p>
<p>What's really wrong is not campaign finance -- it's what
goes on in Congress itself. To truly limit the power of
incumbents, bring fresh blood and competition into
congressional races, and correct some related abuses in
Congress, we should:</p>
<p>1. Limit terms. The career Congress, with its 98%
incumbent re-election rate in the House and 85% in the
Senate, breeds cynicism, now at epidemic proportions.</p>
<p>We have strayed far from the Founders' idea of
landholders, merchants, farmers, and those in the various
professions coming to represent their fellow citizens for a
time in the national legislature. We have forgotten that, in
a civic sense, returning home is as important as coming to
Washington in the first place.</p>
<p>Limiting representatives to six terms and senators to two
seems reasonable.</p>
<p>2. End free mail. The franking privilege gives incumbents
a huge advantage over challengers. Reforms, controls, and
limits haven't worked.</p>
<p>In fiscal 1989, one Republican senator mailed 12.1 million
pieces with a price-tag of $2.7 million. A Democratic
colleague sent out 10.3 million items at a cost of $1.7
million. He fired out one million pieces of mail in the first
quarter of fiscal 1990.</p>
<p>In 1988, the latest year for which figures have been
disclosed, members of both houses mailed 805 million
newsletters and other franked mail -- more than seven pieces
for every household in America -- at a postal cost of $113.4
million, according to the estimates of the House clerk.</p>
<p>3. Cut congressional spending. The money Congress spends
just on itself is outrageous. It took Congress 191 years to
reach an annual budget of $1 billion in 1980. Just 10 years
later, it had climbed to $2 billion. With reduced budgets,
fewer staffers and fewer perks, incumbents could perform
their duties and have less idle time and fewer resources to
waste.</p>
<p>4. Shorten the campaign season. Members of Congress should
volunteer to defer fund-raising until 12 months before any
given election. Think how it would free them to devote their
attention to important legislation]</p>
<p>5. Insist on openness. Full disclosure of all campaign
contributions is the best accountability imaginable. Citizens
would have the freedom and power to band together and
contribute to candidates. Voters would know everything and
could make their decisions accordingly.</p>
<p>Pundits and politicians profess to be concerned about the
growing cynicism of American voters. But the campaign reforms
before the Senate are exactly the kind of legislation that
fosters such cynicism from Portland to Pueblo to Peoria.</p>

<p>Sen. Armstrong (R., Colo.) has announced he will not seek
a third term when his current one expires this year.</p>
