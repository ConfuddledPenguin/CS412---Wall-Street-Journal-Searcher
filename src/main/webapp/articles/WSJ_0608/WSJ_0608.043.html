	<p class="article-leader">LONDON -- SmithKline Beecham PLC named Jan Leschly, the
former president of Squibb Corp., to run its world-wide
pharmaceutical business after John Chappell resigned in a
dispute over management philosophy.
   The health-care giant's decision to hire a highly
respected outsider for the post may quell investor doubts
about SmithKline Beecham, one of the boldest mergers in a
recent wave of drug-industry consolidations. Danish-born Mr.
Leschly, 49 years old, also will have a good shot at
succeeding Robert Bauman, SmithKline Beecham's chief
executive officer.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Mr. Bauman, 59, revived the earnings momentum of Britain's
Beecham Group PLC before its merger last summer with
SmithKline Beckman Corp. of Philadelphia. Some analysts
expect the go-getter American chief executive to seek a fresh
challenge in a year or two when he finishes the difficult
integration. The marriage's much-touted synergy is emerging
slowly. For example, in trying to trim its heavy debt and to
focus on health care, SmithKline Beecham searched for nine
months before finding a buyer for the first part of its
cosmetics business.</p>
<p>Mr. Leschly "is obviously a prime candidate" to succeed
Mr. Bauman, said Erling Refsum, an analyst at Nomura Research
Institute in London. "He has run a major pharmaceutical
company before." Concurred Viren Mehta, a drug-industry
consultant based in New York: "It (the appointment)
strengthens their management team and offers a possible
succession planning" with a man who "has a strong grasp of
the pharmaceutical industry."</p>
<p>Mr. Leschly, a former tennis professional, quit as
Squibb's president and chief operating officer last fall
after it merged with longtime U.S. rival Bristol-Myers Co. "I
worked very hard for Squibb," he recalled in an interview
yesterday. But "I wasn't part of the acquiring company."</p>
<p>Mr. Leschly said he made about $1 million a year at
Squibb. A SmithKline Beecham spokeswoman said he won't take a
pay cut in his new job, but declined to disclose his new
salary.</p>
<p>During his 10-year tenure in various Squibb executive
posts, Mr. Leschly earned industry kudos for overseeing its
introduction of Capoten, a heart drug that's now the second
biggest-selling prescription medicine in the world.</p>
<p>Drug analysts expressed hope that he may help SmithKline
Beecham find a similar blockbuster and relieve investor
concerns about the marriage's long-term payoff. No major drug
looms to replace Tagamet, SmithKline Beecham's biggest
moneymaker. The $1 billion anti-ulcer drug is threatened by
slowing U.S. sales and world-wide patent expirations starting
next year in West Germany.</p>
<p>Analysts also were encouraged by the departure of Mr.
Chappell, 53, who joined SmithKline in 1962. His resignation
will lead to "a further upgrading in the price of the stock,"
said James Keeney, head of health-equities research at Mabon,
Nugent & Co. in Boston. "The guys who presided over the
decline of Tagamet are no longer in charge."</p>
<p>In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday,
SmithKline Beecham American depositary shares rose 75 cents
to close at $47.25.</p>
<p>Mr. Chappell had run the pharmaceutical business since the
merger's completion last summer. In a phone interview
yesterday, he said he stepped down from the $500,000-a-year
post because of differences with Mr. Bauman and SmithKline
Beecham Chairman Henry Wendt over "fundamental philosophy,
rather than (over) the nuts and bolts of managing the
business." There was "a lack of alignment" over values, he
went on, while declining to be more specific. "When that
happens at the top of the house, you really have to do
something about it."</p>
<p>Mr. Bauman wasn't available for comment. But the
SmithKline Beecham spokeswoman described the disagreement as
"differences in how they would structure management of the
business."</p>
<p>In addition to appointing Mr. Leschly, SmithKline Beecham
promoted Frederick Kyle, president of its U.S.
pharmaceuticals business. Mr. Kyle, 57, assumes the new
position of president for the drug business's commercial
operations world-wide.</p>
