	<p class="article-leader">Lonrho PLC, a British trading conglomerate, said interim
pretax profit eased 8.3% from year-earlier levels, when
taking into account last year's disposal of bulk whisky
stocks. Sales of platinum group metals and gold contributed
"significantly" to earnings in the current period, the
company said.
   Excluding last year's #38 million ($64.2 million) disposal
of bulk whisky stocks, pretax profits rose 34%.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Profit attributable to shareholders before extraordinary
items fell to #56 million from #70 million last year.</p>
<p>The company said in addition to the contribution from
mineral extraction and refining, its Hondo Oil & Gas division
saw improved profits in the first half. The group's hotels
and newspaper interests in the U.K. produced higher profits,
although the manufacturing and motor companies were hit by
the downturn in the British economy. The company didn't
provide a detailed breakdown by division and officials
weren't immediately available for comment.</p>
