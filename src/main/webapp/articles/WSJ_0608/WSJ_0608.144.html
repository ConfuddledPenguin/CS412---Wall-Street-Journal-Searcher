	<p class="article-leader">SAN FRANCISCO -- Soon after Philip Anschutz bought
Southern Pacific Transportation Co. in 1988, dozens of
employees gathered in the Utah desert to re-create railroad
history.
   As cameras clicked, the celebrants posed on facing diesel
locomotives from the Southern Pacific and from Mr. Anschutz's
smaller Denver & Rio Grande Western. Recalling the 1869
"golden spike" ceremony on completion of the first
transcontinental railroad, the scene was meant to symbolize
Mr. Anschutz's plan to revive Southern Pacific as part of a
new railroad across the West.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>But Mr. Anschutz's Southern Pacific is hitting rough
track.</p>
<p>Faced with deepening losses at the railroad and high debt
obligations, Mr. Anschutz is keeping the Southern Pacific
afloat with accelerated real estate sales. Shippers complain
of management confusion, erratic pricing tactics and delays
caused by worn-out locomotives.</p>
<p>"A lot of people thought Anschutz coming aboard was like
Santa Claus coming down the chimney," says Rollin Bredenberg,
a Southern Pacific general manager. But combining the
railroad with Mr. Anschutz's smaller Denver & Rio Grande
Western "hasn't solved any of the fundamental problems of the
Southern Pacific," he concedes.</p>
<p>Others worry that Mr. Anschutz, a Denver owner of oil and
gas, real estate and Western art, doesn't know how to run a
railroad. Robert Starzel, a Southern Pacific vice chairman
and Anschutz confidant, says that railroading has proven
"difficult for us" but insists his boss will make the
railroad prosper.</p>
<p>Although the Southern Pacific is the weakest of the
nation's seven major railroads and isn't publicly owned, its
health is of keen interest to shippers, consumers and
travelers. The railroad is the largest hauler of
international goods to the Midwest from Southern California
ports and its scenic routes are traversed by Amtrak passenger
trains.</p>
<p>Mr. Anschutz and minority partner, Morgan Stanley & Co.,
acquired the company in a $1.02 billion leveraged buy-out
plus assumption of $780 million debt. The purchase was widely
hailed by Southern Pacific employees after a plan to merge
the railroad with Santa Fe Pacific Corp. was rejected by the
Interstate Commerce Commission in 1987.</p>
<p>But hopes for fast rejuvenation of Southern Pacific have
faded. The company's rail operations had a loss of $66
million last year, reflecting a downturn in automobile and
lumber traffic, rate wars, a major accident and the cost of
adding new trains. Proceeds from property sales, however,
resulted in net income of $98 million.</p>
<p>However, when real estate sales failed to cover the
company's burden of debt and capital spending, Southern
Pacific renegotiated terms of its loan with Bank of America
last December to avoid default. In April, Moody's Investors
Service downgraded $695 million of the company's long-term
debt, concluding that proceeds from real estate sales will
only partially offset the gap in cash from lower rail
operating earnings.</p>
<p>The company's disappointing railroad performance has
shaken the confidence of some shippers. "I'm concerned that
they will become financially insolvent and the railroad will
be sold piecemeal," says Homer Bollard, general traffic
manager of Louisiana-Pacific Corp., a big lumber shipper.</p>
<p>Southern Pacific officials dismiss such concerns. "This
isn't a question of bankruptcy. There are billions of dollars
of assets here," says Vice Chairman Starzel. Even if company
forecasts for profitable rail operations next year don't pan
out, Southern Pacific could support its railroad with
proceeds from real estate sales for years, Mr. Starzel says.</p>
<p>Mr. Anschutz declines to give interviews. But he has told
shippers that his 15,000-mile rail franchise is among the
strongest, because it includes two major east-west routes and
track to most West and Gulf coast ports. To strengthen the
system, Mr. Anschutz bought a regional rail line last year,
giving Southern Pacific trains direct access to Chicago for
the first time. Now he is trying to overcome the objections
of competing railroads to buy a second route to Chicago.
Slight, restless and 50 years old, Mr. Anschutz likes to take
freight trains to meet crew members and entertain shippers
aboard the Anschutz family yacht.</p>
<p>The Southern Pacific is struggling to regain ground lost
to competitors when it was held in trust for five years
pending its aborted merger with Santa Fe. While Southern
Pacific languished, larger rivals Union Pacific Corp. and
Burlington Northern Inc. moved aggressively to shed surplus
lines and employees and invest in modern technology.</p>
<p>Without the heavy coal and grain traffic of Union Pacific
and Burlington Northern, the railroad is also highly
dependent upon cyclical and rate competitive shipments of
lumber, automobiles, chemicals and containerized freight.</p>
<p>Mr. Anschutz also inherited the results of years of
lagging capital spending. Although Southern Pacific's main
lines have been upgraded, some of its yards are old and
poorly maintained. As he walks through Southern Pacific's
freight yard in Portland, Ore., trainmaster Robert Melbo is
summoned by radio to a two-car derailment caused by rotted
ties under the rails.</p>
<p>Much of the company's locomotive fleet is old and
outmoded. And its freight cars for carrying lumber are
deplorable, says Dennis Williams, director of traffic and
distribution at Bohemia Inc., Eugene, Ore. "They have some
good cars but too few. The rest are old and inefficient."</p>
<p>But some problems are of Mr. Anschutz's own making. He
built the railroad's management team with a president from
the Southern Pacific and a vice chairman from Denver & Rio
Grande, even though the two railroads have conflicting
philosophies. While President D. Michael Mohan was steeped in
the Southern Pacific's costcutting ways, Vice Chairman
William Holtman learned at Denver & Rio Grande to put a
premium on service. Southern Pacific executives say the
confusion is heightened because Mr. Holtman sometimes differs
with Mr. Mohan on important decisions.</p>
<p>Last year Mr. Mohan tried to cut crew costs by ordering
that freight trains be combined. But after freight began to
back up in yards and customers complained of delayed
shipments, Mr. Holtman shortened train sizes. "We adopt a
strategy, and before it can produce results, we drop it and
try something else," says Mr. Melbo, the trainmaster, adding
that the company has changed its train-size requirements four
times in the past 18 months.</p>
<p>Southern Pacific has won some freight lost to competitors
but often at such low rates that the railroad lost money
hauling the traffic. "In our zeal to sign up customers we
lost sight of the fact that you sign them up to make money,
not just to lure them away from someone else," says a former
Southern Pacific vice president.</p>
<p>Now, the railroad's efforts to boost rates are straining
relationships with customers. "They had tremendous reductions
in rates to gain market share and then raised rates beyond
what the market will bear," says Philip Yeager, chairman of
Hub Group, a Chicago-based shippers' agent. "They have
bewildered the shipping public."</p>
<p>Company officials say Mr. Anschutz sought to clear up
management confusion last fall by declaring Mr. Holtman head
of the railroad's day-to-day operations while putting Mr.
Mohan in charge of marketing and long-range strategy. Last
month Mr. Anschutz hired Don Orris, a former American
President Cos. executive who is highly regarded by shippers,
to give new direction to Southern Pacific's troubled
marketing and sales department.</p>
<p>Some shippers see signs of improvements. American
President, a big container shipper, recently dropped threats
to abandon the Southern Pacific after the railroad boosted
on-time delivery of its shipments to 90% from 60%.</p>
<p>Mr. Anschutz has won praise from rail labor. Glynn
Gallagher, a general chairman of the United Transportation
Union, says Mr. Anschutz improved relations between
management and labor by retiring a vice president who was
unpopular because of his harsh disciplinary tactics. "We're a
lot better off with Anschutz than we would have been any
other way," says Mr. Gallagher, who is supporting a plan to
sharply reduce crew sizes aboard Southern Pacific freight
trains in the West.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Mr. Anschutz tries to accelerate sales of real
estate that company officials value at close to $2 billion.
The company stunned long-time employees last month by
announcing that the company's San Francisco headquarters
building may be offered for sale. Southern Pacific is also
trying to peddle surplus lines in Los Angeles and San
Francisco to the state for rail transit corridors. When state
officials had trouble meeting the company's price for the
lines, Southern Pacific contributed $250,000 to an
environmental group that campaigned for new sources of
transit funding. Californians voted on and passed measures
Tuesday, which will provide $1.9 billion for state rail
projects.</p>
<p>"Voters have said not only that they want these rail
corridors but that they are willing to pay for them and that
can mean a lot of money for us," Mr. Starzel said.</p>
