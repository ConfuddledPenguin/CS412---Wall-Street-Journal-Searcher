	<h3>Marketing & Media -- Advertising: Newsreels May Offer a Way Into Theaters</h3>

	<p class="article-leader">Booing and hissing by outraged moviegoers helped persuade
Disney and Warner, among others, to ban commercials from
theater screens showing their films.
   But intrepid advertisers in search of a captive audience
are undaunted. And now, they have found a new way to sneak
into theaters by the backdoor: newsreels.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Once a staple of movie showings, newsreels are starting to
resurface. Today's version, though, is less likely to be a
recap of current events and more likely to be a blatant
vehicle for advertisers. The most notable of the bunch, "The
Popcorn Report," is basically just a series of video news
releases strung together. Cable News Network last week began
testing a more conventional newsreel, shown commercial-free
in a dozen Manhattan theaters, and is already out scouting
around for sponsors.</p>
<p>Stan Zeitlin, president of West Glen Communications, which
puts out the Popcorn Report, believes the newsreels will fly
even in theaters that wouldn't normally allow commercials.
Indeed, he says, the Disney and Warner ad bans have been
terrific for business: Advertisers frozen out of running ads
in theaters are now considering the pseudo-newsreel as a way
to circumvent the ban. Advertisers provide West Glen the
video news release and pay $12,500 to be included in the
report. The report, Mr. Zeitlin says, is positioned "as a
short subject, not as a commercial. It's more subtle."</p>
<p>Subtlety, apparently, is in the eye of the beholder. A
recent Popcorn Report includes a segment on cotton that is an
undisguised promotion for Cotton Inc., the cotton trade
group. In just two minutes, the viewer is treated to a long
shot of Cotton Inc. headquarters, an interview with a Cotton
Inc. executive, and a glimpse of a Cotton Inc. fashion show
in which the trade group's logo looms larger than life. Other
segments score about the same on the subtlety scale, with
"sponsors" ranging from Sandoz Pharmaceuticals to Skippy
Peanut Butter.</p>
<p>That bash-'em-over-the-head approach may not pass muster
among some ad-ban proponents. At Loews Theater Management
Corp., which doesn't allow commercials on its 850 movie
screens, "we won't accept any commercial advertising for our
screens in whatever form. We wouldn't go for anything that
would make anyone even slightly bristle in their seats," a
spokesman says. At General Cinema, which allows
advertiser-sponsored slides before the lights go down on its
1,400 screens, but which bars filmed commercials, a spokesman
says a newsreel would be considered. But he adds, "if it's
blatant advertising, we'd be opposed to it."</p>
<p>Disney executives couldn't be reached, while at Warner, a
spokesman says the only advertising or promotions the studio
would welcome would be those pushing other films. "The reason
for the ban on screen advertising is because it isn't related
to movies. We don't want to lose screen advertising time for
our upcoming movies," he says.</p>
<p>How Disney and Warner stand on the newsreels is of
enormous importance to the advertisers. Disney is about to
release the summer's most talked-about new movie, "Dick
Tracy," while Warner, which scored last summer with "Batman,"
is coming out with "Gremlins II." Advertisers would love to
find a way to sneak back onto the screens where both studios'
films are showing; if they can't, advertising in theaters
could be far less effective.</p>
<p>To try to make advertising more palatable to the big
studios, CNN is going the low-key route as it searches for
sponsors. "We're hoping to get somebody interested in just a
mention at the beginning -- CNN Reel News is brought to you
by Nabisco, or something like that," a CNN spokeswoman says.
"Hopefully, they can get it to be real inconspicuous."</p>
<p>CNN's newsreel, which lasts just over two minutes, puts
together light news clips that have already aired on CNN,
like a story about the last manned lighthouse. The
unsponsored test will last for three months before CNN
decides if and how to expand.</p>
<p>Advertiser interest since the Disney and Warner ad-ban
decisions, meanwhile, is prompting West Glen to consider
expanding. So far, it has remained a tiny operation, with
just 50 copies of each "Popcorn Report" edition. But since
the bans, some national advertisers have expressed interest,
including one of the networks seeking to promote its fall
season, Mr. Zeitlin says. As a result, he says, it is "quite
probable" that within the next two weeks he'll expand the
report. He also wants to increase the frequency to bimonthly
from quarterly.</p>
<p>There's no assurance, though, that the theaters will run
the pseudo-newsreel; currently, participating theaters get
the report for free, and run it as often -- or as
infrequently -- as they'd like. But Mr. Zeitlin says he
thinks theaters will bite, contending: "It is certainly a
form of advertising, there's no question about that. But
{theaters} don't see it as a commercial."</p>

<p>Nintendo Picks Foote Cone</p>
<p>Foote, Cone & Belding's San Francisco office added a major
national advertiser to its client roster, winning the video
games account from Nintendo of America.</p>
<p>Nintendo, based in Redmond, Wash., said the account will
bill $35 million this year. According to Leading National
Advertisers, Nintendo spent only about $15 million
advertising its game products last year, but Nintendo said
the figure was actually much higher.</p>
<p>The account had previously been handled by
McCann-Erickson, a unit of Interpublic Group. Donald Coyner,
Nintendo's advertising manager, wouldn't say what prompted
the switch.</p>
<p>He did say, however, that Foote Cone's work with Levi
Strauss and other youth-related clients was a factor in
awarding the account to that shop. "We feel that the guys in
the San Francisco office can help us well into the future,"
he said.</p>
<p>In addition to Foote Cone, Nintendo also considered
Chicago-based Leo Burnett for the business.</p>
