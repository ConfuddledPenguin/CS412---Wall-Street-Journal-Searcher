	<p class="article-leader">Compression Labs Inc. said it agreed to supply Sony
Corp.'s U.S. unit with video-conference equipment.
Compression said that no dollar amount was specified but that
the agreement could provide tens of millions of dollars in
revenue over the next several years.
   Under the agreement, Compression will supply Sony with
"video codecs," circuitry used to squeeze video signals onto
phone lines or airwaves that otherwise are too small to carry
the signals. Codecs are used in video conferencing to
transmit without distortion the moving images of people at
conference tables.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"Sony's a big company and this is going to be a very large
market in a couple of years," the company said.</p>
<p>Compression Labs is a San Jose, Calif.-based supplier of
codecs. The company also is working on circuitry to compress
signals for high-definition television, which requires many
times the amount of information that conventional TV signals
contain.</p>
