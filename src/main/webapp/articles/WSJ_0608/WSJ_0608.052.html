	<p class="article-leader">SAO PAULO -- In typical Brazilian fashion, Jarbas Rezende,
a local businessman, tries to capture with a joke the mood of
his crisis-torn country and its latest, most dramatic
austerity plan: "Adam and Eve had no house. They had no
clothes. Just an apple. And they thought they were in
Paradise. They must have been Brazilian]" Everyone at the
business meeting laughs.
   Yet not everyone is laughing in Brazil these days. Luz
Wright, a Brazilian married to an American, titters a moment
and then reacts seriously to the joke: "I don't think
Brazilians think they live in paradise any more. It used to
be paradise, but it has changed. Brazil has troubles."</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The troubles are deep and serious: persistent and
explosive inflation, currency constantly shrinking in value
and being reissued, growing poverty, a massive and hurting
informal economy, entrenched state subsidies and privileges,
fragile institutions in a democracy still finding its way
after a generation of military rule, and a spreading sense of
alarm and despair.</p>
<p>Neide de Paula Santos and her family are a bizarre example
of many of Brazil's troubles. They have just moved into a new
house they built on land given them by the local government.
The two-bedroom home is three times larger than the shanty
they lived in, but it has no electricity, no sewer hookup, no
water and no heat. Mrs. de Paula Santos and her husband are
both unemployed and -- because of layoffs caused by the
austerity plan -- have no prospects for employment soon. So
their new home has no wooden floors nor glass in the windows.
To keep occupied, Mrs. de Paula Santos plays dominoes in the
afternoon.</p>
<p>President Fernando Collor de Mello used his election
mandate to launch the toughest assault on Brazil's problems
in its history: freezing wages, prices and financial assets,
creating yet another new currency and initiating a variety of
tax measures to curb the public deficits. And despite
widespread complaints and world-wide skepticism, the Collor
Plan (which started March 16) is biting hard and enjoys a
remarkable degree of public support. A recent survey by the
Institute Brasileiro de Opiniao Publica in Rio de Janeiro,
shows 74% of the electorate support the plan (18% don't), the
president has the confidence of 67% of the voters and would
get 61% of the vote if elections were held today. The survey,
unlike earlier ones, sought to reflect all the voters, not
just people who live in urban centers.</p>
<p>The high degree of support is surprising in the face of a
recession that moves unevenly across the economy. It reflects
a grudging acceptance of the fact that Brazil faced certain
financial doom if it continued its wild course of the 1980s.
A new mood of personal discipline is replacing the profligate
ways of the recent past. During a recent strike of
transportation workers in Rio, clerks at the daily Journal of
Brazil walked to work. "Up to 20 kilometers," says an amazed
Marcus Sa Correa, the editor. "Five years ago, that wouldn't
have happened. They'd have stayed home."</p>
<p>Now that inflation is reduced, "People are thinking more
about the cost and benefits of what they buy," says Julia de
Carvalho Filho, a Sao Paulo working mother of three. "In my
house, we used to buy five or six of things. We'd stock up.
We'd reach in the closet and get the next one. When the
toothpaste was hard to squeeze, we'd throw it out. Now we buy
one tube at a time."</p>
<p>Whether the Collor Plan ultimately succeeds or not -- and
government freezes rarely do -- it seems to be changing the
attitude of many Brazilians: They seem sadder, wiser,
soberer. Is a sometimes-juvenile country coming of age and
reaching a new maturity?</p>
<p>Success of the plan is far from certain. Brazilian
congressmen, facing elections in the fall, are a major threat
to the program. They face strong pressure from workers and
unions as the plan continues to cut into the purchasing power
of paychecks (already reduced up to 60% since March 16,
according to some calculations). Labor observers expect a
wave of strikes in the fall.</p>
<p>To pave the way for cost-of-living increases, Congress
voted to set aside President Collor's temporary order that
barred wage increases. The president immediately reissued a
new 30-day temporary order. The attorney general now is
taking sides with Congress, asserting the "reissued"
temporary order violates Brazil's new constitution. The case
is now before the Supreme Court.</p>
<p>Many small businesses are hurting. At one machine-parts
factory in Sao Paulo, customers aren't taking delivery of
parts previously ordered so the parts lie wrapped up on a
shelf. In the informal sector, which may support as many as
50 million Brazilians, sales are slumping. The Collor Plan
requires all transactions to have receipts for payments. The
small-business men who normally buy in the informal sector
are turning away because the marginal suppliers won't provide
the receipts the government requires. The little businesses
don't want to give the receipts because they can't afford to
pay taxes.</p>
<p>But pressures abound for the government to give ground,
and it has. At the start of this month, elderly people and
certain others got concessions, freeing up funds frozen in
banks. The nation's money supply shrank dramatically in the
first three days of the plan, and is now working its way back
to about 80% of its pre-plan level. Some experts fear it may
be growing at a faster rate.</p>
<p>So far, however, there is little sign of one of the
primary offshoots of repressed inflation: Few basic goods are
in short supply. The shelves of a supermarket in central Sao
Paulo are adequately, if not abundantly, stocked, and the
lines at the checkout counter are relatively short. To keep
supplies of vegetable oil ample, the government allowed the
prices to rise. One basic in short supply is black beans, a
staple that is mixed with rice. But the cause may be export
demand from Cuba and other customers, not the Collor Plan.
Some prices seem to be tumbling, but this seems more illusion
than reality. Many merchants raised prices sharply before the
plan was announced, and now aggressively advertise "Super
sales . . . up to 50% discount" and "40% discount for cash"
to stimulate sales without really cutting prices.</p>
<p>To many Brazilians, the Collor Plan offers a last chance.
"I'm trying to be as optimistic as possible," says a
secretary in Rio. "The problem is there is so much to be
done." Some journalists and intellectuals speculate about a
restive military waiting in the wings ready to move in if the
Collor Plan fails. But most Brazilians agree with Journal of
Brazil Editor Sa Correa: "Impossible. There is no
international support for the military anymore. It is
finished."</p>
<p>Currently everything in Brazil seems to ride so totally on
the success of the Collor Plan that all conversations with
thoughtful Brazilians end with a plaintive -- almost
desperate -- plea: "The plan needs time and must work.
Because if it fails . . . " For the sake of all Brazilians,
especially the half who live on $800 a year or less, one can
only hope Brazil's apparent new maturity prevails.</p>
