	<p class="article-leader">Blood cells taken from volunteers immunized with an
experimental AIDS vaccine showed an unexpected ability in the
test tube to selectively destroy cells infected with the AIDS
virus.
   The finding suggests that a type of acquired immune
deficiency syndrome vaccine may be more effective than
scientists had previously thought. The scientists cautioned,
however, that it still may take several years to develop and
test a safe and effective AIDS vaccine.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The vaccine involved in a human experiment at Johns
Hopkins University medical school was genetically engineered
by Micro-GeneSys Inc. of West Haven, Conn. Similar
experimental vaccines have been developed by Bristol-Myers
Squibb Inc. and by Genentech Inc., which announced last week
that its vaccine had protected two chimpanzees against
deliberate infections with the AIDS virus and that tests in
humans might begin this summer.</p>
<p>The experimental vaccines are known as subunit vaccines,
because they are made only of certain proteins that coat the
human immunodeficiency virus, HIV-1, which causes AIDS. Most
conventional vaccines are made of a whole virus. The hope is
that the viral surface protein alone will trick the body's
immune system into launching an attack against HIV-1.</p>
<p>The three companies each have their own version of a
subunit vaccine made with an HIV-1 protein known as gp160.
The vaccine is designed to trigger an immune attack on
anything that displays gp160.</p>
<p>Most vaccines, including AIDS vaccines, are aimed at
triggering the body to make antibodies that will disable the
infecting virus. But in AIDS, the virus wreaks its havoc by
worming its way into certain white blood cells, where it
escapes the attack by antibodies. The virus's destruction of
these infected blood cells is what cripples the immune system
and causes AIDS.</p>
<p>There has been some question about whether the subunit
vaccines, such as those made with gp160 protein, can trick
the body into activating "killer" lymphocytes that will
destroy cells that are infected with the deadly virus. If so,
the vaccines would be more effective than if they just
activated antibodies against the freefloating virus.</p>
<p>The new experiment at Johns Hopkins, reported in this
week's issue of Science, indicated that the gp160 vaccine
will, indeed, activate killer cells that attack HIV-infected
blood cells. But the vaccines did so in an unexpected way.</p>
<p>In their experiment, the researchers vaccinated eight
healthy human volunteers with four extremely small doses of
the MicroGeneSys gp160 protein. They then extracted the
lymphocytes from the blood of the volunteers. Laboratory
tests found that lymphocytes from three of the volunteers
did, in fact, kill HIV-infected cells.</p>
<p>"This was the first time this vaccine was used in humans,
so we used extremely low doses on the order of 40 thousandths
of a gram," noted co-author Robert F. Siliciano in explaining
why only three of the eight patients appeared to respond to
the vaccine. Tests are under way to see whether higher doses
will produce immune responses in a greater proportion of
volunteers.</p>
<p>As they proceeded in their laboratory experiments, the
researchers found that the killer lymphocytes were of a type
known as CD4-positive lymphocytes. These CD4-positive
lymphocytes ordinarily don't operate as killer cells. Yet the
vaccine had done something to turn them into killers.</p>
<p>Moreover, the CD4-positive lymphocytes picked out and
destroyed only those cells that were infected and ignored
cells that had accidentally picked up scraps of the HIV-1
virus on their surfaces.</p>
<p>The tests also indicated that the CD4-positive killers
activated by the vaccine will destroy cells infected by
almost any version of the lethal HIV-1 virus. Scientists have
worried that a vaccine may be effective against only one or a
few of the several varieties of the HIV-1.</p>
