	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- The federal government's first comparison of
public and private schools shows that private-school students
score significantly higher on tests of writing ability than
those who attend public schools.
   However, the federally financed National Assessment of
Educational Progress characterizes the average writing
ability of students in all schools, public and private, as
"minimal." It says the scores of private-school students,
including those from church-operated schools, were just less
minimal than public-school students' scores.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The agency's latest report on tests administered in 1988
also shows a greater disparity between the writing abilities
of minority and white students than earlier assessments. The
National Assessment was established by Congress to measure
how much students learn in school.</p>
<p>The report is likely to fuel two current revolts against
traditionally run public schools: One demands greater
parental control of schools and the other seeks to give
parents and students wider choice among schools.</p>
<p>In several cities, including Chicago and Detroit,
inner-city parents, largely of minorities, have won greater
managerial authority over local schools. Wisconsin has
launched a novel program to allow a limited number of
low-income children in Milwaukee to attend private schools
with public assistance. In addition, some liberals are
joining conservatives in arguing that all students should be
allowed to go to private schools with public assistance if
their parents choose.</p>
<p>The data from tests of nationwide samples of students
shows that eighth-grade students in private schools
demonstrated greater writing proficiency than 12th graders in
public schools. Looking at the difference in writing scores
between public and private school students, Roy Truby, the
executive director of NAEP's governing board, said, "The gap
between them is substantial." However, he noted that the
writing performance of students in so-called advantaged
public schools, generally those in wealthy suburbs, is equal
to that of private-school students.</p>
<p>The latest NAEP report on writing skills isn't comparable
with an assessment of writing skills the agency released in
January, which showed a small decrease in the gap between
whites and minorities. NAEP officials said the latest scores
are based on writing tests as much as 30 minutes long, rather
than the 15-minute tests used in other assessments. "The new,
longer format appears to have had the effect of raising the
average performance of white students by increasing the
proportion with adequate or better responses," Mr. Truby
said. "However, it had very little effect on blacks and
Hispanics. . . . As a result, the racial gap appears wider on
the writing exam than on other NAEP assessments."</p>
<p>The wider gap between whites and minorities on longer
tests could raise ticklish political issues. NAEP is planning
writing tests of as long as 50 minutes for its 1992 writing
assessments. The longer tests are part of an effort to find
better ways to gauge student skills and performance, which
will come under greater scrutiny as the nation measures its
progress toward ambitious educational goals President Bush
and the nation's governors set for the year 2000.</p>
<p>In explaining the overall poor writing performance, NAEP
noted that students do only a "limited" amount of writing in
school. Only a third of the eighth and 12th graders reported
having to write one or two-page assignments at least once a
week.</p>
<p>In a companion report on reading performance, the NAEP
said about half the students surveyed in the fourth, eighth
and 12th grades reported reading 10 pages or less a day in
all their courses combined.</p>
