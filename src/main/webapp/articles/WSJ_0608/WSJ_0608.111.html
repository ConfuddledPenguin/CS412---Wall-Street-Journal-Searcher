	<p class="article-leader">Playboy Enterprises Inc., Chicago, said it completed a
recapitalization plan, under which it will convert its common
stock into voting and nonvoting classes.
   The proposal was criticized by some holders, but passage
was never in question, as it had the support of Hugh M.
Hefner, founder and former chairman, who holds a 71% stake in
the publishing and entertainment concern.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>After the measure was approved, Playboy said, it carried
out a 1-for-2 reverse split of its common stock, and
reclassified that reduced number of shares as voting Class A
stock. It then paid a stock dividend of three shares of new
nonvoting Class B common stock for each share of Class A
common. The two classes will trade separately on the New York
Stock Exchange, beginning today, Playboy said.</p>
<p>The dual-class arrangement will allow Mr. Hefner, should
he wish to do so, to retain his majority voting stake while
shedding up to three-quarters of his shares. That was what
irked some shareholders, including Industrial Equity
(Pacific) Ltd., which has a 7.6% Playboy stake.</p>
