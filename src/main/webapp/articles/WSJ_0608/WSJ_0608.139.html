	<p class="article-leader">LONDON -- Lloyd's of London Chairman Murray Lawrence said
he plans to step down at year end, and the insurance market's
ruling council nominated David Coleridge, a recent deputy
chairman, to succeed him.
   Approval for Mr. Coleridge's nomination is expected Dec. 5
at the first meeting of a newly elected Lloyd's council. If
cleared, he will take the helm at an important time. The more
than 300-year-old insurance exchange has been buffeted in
recent years by increasing competitive challenges and is
trying to increase its business and reduce costs.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Mr. Lawrence, 55 years old, appears to be looking for a
change after serving on Lloyd's governing panel for 11 years,
the past 2 1/2 of them as chairman. "These have been years of
great change and achievement," he said. But, he added, now is
"an appropriate moment for a successor to take over the
reins." Mr. Lawrence will continue to head the Lloyd's
underwriting agency that bears his name, and will continue as
a member of the council for another year.</p>
<p>Mr. Coleridge, 58, is considered a consumate Lloyd's
insider, having been a broker, underwriter and executive in
the market for more than 35 years. He currently is chairman
of Sturge Holdings PLC, one of Lloyd's largest underwriting
agents. He also has served on the ruling council for seven of
the past eight years, and was a deputy chairman until last
December.</p>
<p>In a brief telephone interview, Mr. Coleridge declined to
discuss any plans for Lloyd's. But he said he "will really
try hard" in the post.</p>
