	<p class="article-leader">Behind the bright lights of the anti-communist revolution
that has swept Eastern Europe lie the cold details of
remaking nations and their economies. It is important that
the West not lose interest as these incipient democracies now
take up the hard part. For Czechoslovakia, that begins this
weekend as citizens go to the polls for the first free
election in 42 years.
   The country's new Parliament will be drafting a
constitution, an undertaking no less important than the task
that confronted the Founders of the United States 200 years
ago. This will be the fifth version of the country's
constitution since the Czech lands of Bohemia and Moravia
united with Slovakia in 1918. The current squabbling between
the country's Czechs and Slovaks reflects an identity crisis
that has haunted Czechoslovakia throughout its history.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The internal divisions among the 10 million Czechs, five
million Slovaks plus Hungarian, German, Polish, Ruthenian and
Romany nationalities have made the country easy prey to
external and internal predators. The Slovaks have felt all
along that the dominant Czechs reneged on a promise of Slovak
autonomy. But it wasn't until about the 20th birthday of
Czechoslovakia before Slovaks could find someone to take up
their cause. The tragedy was that that someone turned out to
be Adolf Hitler.</p>
<p>When the "Fuhrer" swooped down on Czechoslovakia in 1938,
he renamed the country "Czecho-Slovakia," with a hyphen and a
capital S, the same spelling Slovakian separatists have been
demanding this year. The 1948 communist "coup d'etat" brought
Czechoslovakia under a Stalinist constitution. Perversely,
Communist rule had the effect of unifying the country. The
political and cultural liberties of the Czechs were trampled
as much as those of the other nationalities. Anti-communism
was a sentiment all groups could support.</p>
<p>But when constitutional tinkering in 1960 eased press and
cultural restrictions, the issue of Czech domination of the
other nationalities once again caught fire. Jan Carnogursky,
one of Slovakia's leading human-rights and religious
activists, and who emerged from prison as the November
revolution began to unfold, wants Slovakia to apply as a
separate entity for membership to the Common Market. He could
succeed this weekend in leading his right-wing Christian
Democratic Party to victory over the Civic Forum's Slovakian
affiliate. Vaclav Havel, Czechoslovakia's current and
undoubtedly future president, has been crisscrossing the
country trying to defuse the issue, but without much success.</p>
<p>Since all parties agree that the country needs to adopt a
market economy, tough issues such as privatization, currency
reform and the development of capital markets rank low in the
electioneering. Despite this promising consensus on economic
policy, the people responsible for it will need solid
political support, not factionalism, if they are to have the
courage to carry through on these reform.</p>
<p>The longer Czechoslovakia remains adrift in its
constitutional void the greater the danger to all the good
that it has achieved and to its great future potential.
(Voters also go to the polls this weekend in Bulgaria, a
country whose long road to recovery is suggested by the fact
that, unique among East European countries today, one still
sees the Soviet flag flying.)</p>
<p>Whether a consensus can be reached in Czechoslovakia on
the sovereignty of the state hinges on the ability of
political leaders at a crucial point in their country's
history to devise a federal structure that recognizes the
authority of the majority, while it extends to nationalities
collective political rights sufficient to satisfy them. Such
an extraordinary achievement would be a first in Eastern
Europe.</p>
