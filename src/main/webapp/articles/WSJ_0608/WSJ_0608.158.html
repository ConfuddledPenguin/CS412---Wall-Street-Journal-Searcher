	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- White House and congressional budget
negotiators appear to have discovered that, for all their
vows to reduce the deficit, there's little appetite for
cutting spending outside the Pentagon.
   A couple of Republicans emerged discouraged from
yesterday's review of government spending, but most
participants said they are resigned to another week of what
Sen. Pete Domenici (R., N.M.) called "a learning experience,
a get-people-involved experience."</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Sen. Domenici said he doubts the parties will begin any
significant bargaining for another 10 days. White House
Budget Director Richard Darman called that assessment
"realistic," although he has been pressing for a faster pace.</p>
<p>When Mr. Darman expressed impatience at yesterday's
session, participants said, Sen. Wyche Fowler (D., Ga.)
responded by reading excerpts from a 1967 speech by then-Rep.
George Bush asserting that President Lyndon Johnson wasn't
exercising presidential leadership.</p>
<p>House Majority Leader Richard Gephardt told negotiators he
still hopes for an agreement in principle this month and
vowed longer and more frequent meetings toward that end,
participants said.</p>
<p>The budget summit agreed to form a
congressional-administration staff group to prepare a list of
ways to cut spending on federal entitlement programs, Mr.
Darman said.</p>
