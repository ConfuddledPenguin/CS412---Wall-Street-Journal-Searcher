	<p class="article-leader">FIRST FIDELITY BANCORP. (Lawrenceville, N.J.) -- Standard
& Poor's Corp. lowered its ratings on about $750 million of
debt, citing the regional banking concern's recent
announcement of an expected increase of as much as 40% in
nonperforming assets. S&P lowered its subordinated debt
rating on the company, which operates in New Jersey and
Pennsylvania, to double-B-plus from triple-B, and its rating
on preferred stock to double-B from triple-B-minus. Other
ratings were also lowered, S&P said. The rating concern put
the company on its CreditWatch list for a possible lower
rating in May after First Fidelity said second-quarter loan
losses could be as much as $300 million and announced a
dividend cut. S&P said the increase in problem loans could
marginally exceed the company's estimates. "While the
downside risk is limited, given the company's relatively
moderate exposure to commercial real estate and highly
leveraged transactions," S&P said, "First Fidelity's poor
financial performance over the past several months has
weakened its ability to handle new problems." It said that
although the company has bolstered credit policies and sought
to deal with its costs, "a weak operating environment will
delay the financial benefits from these changes."</p>
