	<p class="article-leader">MOSCOW -- In the fall of 1985, two Soviet hackers sat down
at a computer and devised an infuriatingly simple game that
has taken the world by storm. Now a standard feature on
Nintendo, the popular home video system, Tetris is one of the
hottest software games ever to hit the market. Four million
copies have been sold in the U.S. alone so far.
   But Alexei Pazhitnov and Vadim Gerasimov, the game's
inventors, are only half celebrating. Although Tetris has won
them international fame, the two hackers haven't received a
penny of the profits the game has generated -- and it isn't
likely they ever will. Mr. Gerasimov, a 21-year-old student,
can't even afford a computer of his own. "I don't worry about
money very much," the thin, shy hacker says modestly, "but I
hope that this mistake will be corrected."</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>As Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev battles to overhaul his
nation's economy, he is counting on the talents of people
such as Mr. Pazhitnov and Mr. Gerasimov. Mr. Gorbachev
insists the U.S.S.R. has more to sell than just raw materials
like oil and minerals, and he frequently talks about the
nation's "huge scientific potential." Soviet officials hail
the success of Tetris as proof.</p>
<p>But Tetris seems as much a testament to the chronic
shortcomings of the Soviet economic system as an
advertisement for Soviet science. Tetris's path from computer
lab to international stardom was littered with obstacles. Its
discovery owes more to chance than design. And clumsy Soviet
efforts to market the game sparked acrimonious copyright
lawsuits in the U.S., giving the Soviets an unprecedented
taste of American jurisprudence.</p>
<p>"Tetris has made history," says Nikolai E. Belikov, the
Soviet trade specialist responsible for licensing the game.
But he also concedes that the Soviet inexperience in trade
hurt efforts to capitalize on Tetris. "This was our first
contract with computer games and it was necessary to
understand the market. We needed time," he says, adding that
"we have learned very much" from the experience.</p>
<p>Tetris is the brainchild of Mr. Pazhitnov, 35, a bearded
expert in applied mathematics who works at the prestigious
Soviet Academy of Sciences Computing Center, which studies,
among other things, artificial intelligence. Like hackers the
world over, he is often drawn to computer play. His passion
happens to be puzzles.</p>
<p>While noodling around on his machine, Mr. Pazhitnov came
up with a kind of computerized Rubik's Cube. In his version,
a player races the clock to create orderly blocks out of
squares, rectangles and other shapes that drop from the top
of a computer screen.</p>
<p>The Computing Center's clunky Soviet machines weren't
equipped to handle graphics, so the first version of the game
was fairly primitive. When the center purchased more
sophisticated personal computers from IBM in 1985, Mr.
Pazhitnov set about adapting his game to them. He got some
help from Mr. Gerasimov, then a 17-year-old math whiz who
frequently dropped by the center after school.</p>
<p>Fine-tuning Tetris became an obsession. "All the chiefs
began to hate me because they wanted serious work," Mr.
Pazhitnov recalls. But the two persisted, and over a period
of months they came up with a game that was simple, elegant
and, according to its many fans, addictive.</p>
<p>Tetris was an instant hit among Soviet computer buffs, who
copied it and passed it from hand to hand. "Within a couple
of weeks, I found it in every corner of Moscow," Mr.
Pazhitnov says.</p>
<p>For all their work, Mr. Pazhitnov and Mr. Gerasimov had
only token rights to their invention and couldn't stop it
from being pirated in the U.S.S.R., which doesn't have any
effective copyright laws. The pair handed over the rights to
Tetris to the Computing Center, which, as a state
institution, is allowed to own inventions. The two knew it
was the only chance they had to get the game on the market.</p>
<p>Soviet officials concede they probably wouldn't have done
anything with the game had they not received a telegram in
late 1987 from Robert Stein, a Hungarian refugee who runs a
British company called Andromeda Software, seeking to acquire
the rights to Tetris. Mr. Stein had spotted the game in 1986
while on a visit to Budapest. "I sat down and played it," Mr.
Stein says. "I'm not a games player, and I knew that if I
liked it, it must be a success."</p>
<p>Mr. Stein copied the game and took it back to London,
where he sold the rights for an undisclosed amount to a
British company called Mirrorsoft, a software unit of Maxwell
Communication Corp., the media conglomerate. Mr. Stein
concedes he sold rights that weren't legally his, but he says
he thought he would eventually be able to acquire the rights
from the Soviets.</p>
<p>Mirrorsoft launched the game in Britain and Western Europe
in January 1988, and, a few months later, in the U.S.
Mirrorsoft subsequently sublicensed the U.S. home-video
rights to Tengen Inc., a software unit of video-game
manufacturer Atari Games Corp. of Milpitas, Calif.</p>
<p>Apparently concerned about his company's claim to Tetris
-- and its right to license it to Mirrorsoft -- Mr. Stein
went to Moscow in early 1988 to secure a license from Elorg,
a Soviet state trading agency that acted on behalf of the
Computing Center. Elorg gave Mr. Stein's company, Andromeda,
a license to sell the personal-computer version of the game.</p>
<p>Elorg officials say they discovered only by chance that
Tetris was a big hit on the home-video market in the U.S. and
elsewhere; they found out by reading computer trade
magazines. Officials, who say they thought they had licensed
only the personal computer version, not the home video
version, to Mr. Stein, were shocked. They complained to him,
but didn't take any action to halt sales.</p>
<p>Elorg also claims Mr. Stein deliberately dragged his feet
in paying them licensing fees, although the agency won't say
how much it believes it is owed. Mr. Stein acknowledges some
delays in paying the Soviets, but he says his customers were
slow to pay him.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, another problem loomed. Rigid Soviet accounting
rules make it almost impossible to reward people who think up
marketable ideas. The Computing Center has earned hundreds of
thousands of dollars so far from Tetris, but the money goes
into a special fund that can be used only to buy new
equipment. "It's part of our general stupidity in this
country," says Vladimir Mazurik, a senior official at the
center. "It's important to reward people who work hard."</p>
<p>Mr. Pazhitnov says he never expected to make a fortune off
Tetris. He recalls telling his bosses at the Computing
Center: "If you can pay me, please do. If you can't, it
doesn't matter." Recently, he got a small bonus of 5,000
rubles. That's about $8,000 at the official exchange rate
but, at the more realistic tourist rate, only $800.</p>
<p>The Computing Center also hopes to give IBM computers to
Mr. Pazhitnov and Mr. Gerasimov. But "we can't without
special agreement of the presidium of the Academy of
Sciences," shrugs Yuri Yevtushenko, the center's director.
"We are not a private organization, we are a state
institute."</p>
<p>Evidently embarrassed by the situation, he says: "It's a
new problem for the Soviet Union. We never even considered it
before."</p>
<p>In any case, by early 1989, international interest in
Tetris was soaring. Japanese, American, and British firms
rushed to Moscow to vie for various rights to the game. Over
several hectic days in February 1989, Elorg conducted
parallel negotiations with Mr. Stein, who was trying to
acquire the license for coin-operated arcade games, and Kevin
Maxwell, Mirrorsoft's chairman and the son of British media
tycoon Robert Maxwell, who thought he already held many of
the licenses via Mr. Stein but came to Moscow to get more.</p>
<p>Nintendo of America, the U.S. unit of Nintendo Co. of
Kyoto, Japan, the video-game giant, also entered the fray --
and ultimately walked off with one of the most valuable
rights: an exclusive world-wide licensing agreement to use
the game in its entertainment systems. (Mr. Stein got the
arcade-game rights.)</p>
<p>Mirrorsoft's Mr. Maxwell was furious; he had hoped to
receive all rights to the game. So apparently was his father,
Robert Maxwell, chairman and chief executive of Maxwell
Communication, whose publishing firm brought out the English
version of Mr. Gorbachev's book "Perestroika." Mr. Belikov
says the senior Mr. Maxwell fired off an angry letter to the
Soviet government complaining about Elorg's negotiations with
other companies. A spokesman for the senior Mr. Maxwell
declines to comment on the matter.</p>
<p>Were it not for the tolerance of senior officials, who
shrugged off the complaint, Mr. Belikov is convinced his
career would have been ruined. "Thank heavens for
perestroika," he beams.</p>
<p>When Nintendo of America, based in Redmond, Wash.,
returned to the U.S. in April, it was promptly sued for
copyright infringement in federal court by Atari's Tengen,
which thought it had acquired the video-game rights through
Mirrorsoft. Nintendo filed a countersuit, also claiming its
rights had been infringed upon. At issue was the question of
whether Mr. Stein, the British businessman, had acquired the
home-video rights along with the personal-computer rights in
1988.</p>
<p>After an initial hearing in San Francisco in June, lawyers
from both sides arranged a deposition in Moscow, believed to
be the first such proceeding in the Soviet Union. For several
hours, Mr. Pazhitnov and an Elorg official faced a barrage of
questions in Moscow.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, an American lawyer for Tengen tracked Mr.
Belikov down in Singapore, where he was on state business.
The Soviet trade specialist wouldn't cooperate. Nintendo's
lawyers had more luck. They persuaded Mr. Belikov to divulge
many of the details of the commercial contracts with Mr.
Stein. For the Soviet Union, long a closed and extremely
secretive society, this was a major step into unknown
territory. Mr. Belikov gave crucial details of the business
transactions to the lawyers. Later, he went to the U.S.
Embassy in Moscow on six separate occasions to swear that his
comments were true.</p>
<p>"It was the first time a Soviet trade organization had to
swear an oath," says Mr. Belikov. "This is very unusual for
us."</p>
<p>The final test of Soviet willingness to cooperate in the
dispute came in November, when the case went to court in San
Francisco. Mr. Belikov agreed to go and give evidence --
"very apprehensively," says a lawyer for Nintendo. Because of
extreme difficulties in getting a passport and U.S. visa, he
just made it in the nick of time. But as it turned out, the
judge issued a summary judgment against Tengen, and no
evidence was heard. Tengen's lawyers say the company will
appeal.</p>
<p>Elorg apparently decided it could play hardball too. A few
days before the hearing in San Francisco, the Soviet trading
agency employed a U.S. accounting firm to audit Mr. Stein's
books to determine exactly how much revenue the game had
generated. The audit results weren't available.</p>
<p>Back in London, Mr. Stein is indignant. "Everybody hates
me, and everyone is making a fortune out of Tetris," he says,
though he declines to say how much he made off the game
himself. "The Soviets didn't know they had this product. We
told them they had a hot product. We made it famous."</p>
<p>Mr. Belikov concurs. "It's quite true what he says. We are
grateful to Mr. Stein because he did much to introduce the
game," he says with a smile. "If he had just paid us
adequately, he would have gained a million times more than he
has earned now."</p>
