	<p class="article-leader">Transcisco Industries Inc., San Francisco, said it agreed
to make a "substantial" investment in Piper Aircraft Corp.
and to take over Piper's parts-distribution business.
   Transcisco said a letter of intent signed with Piper calls
for Transcisco to form a separate company to take over
Piper's world-wide parts business. Transcisco said the letter
also calls for it to receive warrants to acquire an
unspecified amount of stock in Piper, a troubled Vero Beach,
Fla., maker of small airplanes.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The acquisition of the Piper business, if completed, would
fit into Transcisco's effort to expand transportation
businesses beyond the company's basic rail-equipment
maintenance-and-leasing operations, Transcisco said. More
than 90,000 piper airplanes are flying around the world, it
said, representing a large market for replacement parts.</p>
<p>The transaction provides the privately held Piper with the
working capital it needs to deliver its order backlog of
aircraft, which Piper estimates at over $200 million, and to
develop new models, Transcisco said. Terms of the proposed
acquisition weren't revealed.</p>
