	<p class="article-leader">How long should a chief executive officer stay on the job?
   Lee Iacocca's anouncement yesterday that he plans to
remain CEO of Chrysler Corp. beyond his current contract,
which expires at the end of next year, points up the issue of
whether a chief executive can overstay his welcome.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>In the case of the redoubtable Mr. Iacocca, the question
may appear heretical. For many people, he is Chrysler. He
engineered the auto maker's return from the brink of
bankruptcy. His reputation boosts confidence in Chrysler, and
his public acclaim keeps the company in the spotlight.</p>
<p>But the events behind his decision -- including last
week's resignation of Gerald Greenwald, Chrysler's No. 2
executive and Mr. Iacocca's former heir apparent -- have
raised warning flags among management specialists.
Consultants and academics -- and even some former chief
executives -- say any veteran CEO (Mr. Iacocca has been on
top for a decade) who is beyond normal retirement age (he
already is 65 years old), without a clear succession plan (he
now has none) and without a fixed retirement date risks
sticking around too long.</p>
<p>Though they bemoan corporate leaders' focus on short-term
results, many management specialists agree that too much of
even a very good thing can be worse than too little. "It's
likely that more companies are hurt by CEOs staying on too
long a time than by those staying on too short a time," says
Donald Perkins, former chief executive of Jewel Cos.</p>
<p>The pitfalls include disruption of orderly succession
plans, the danger of losing touch with markets and
technology, and simply growing stale in office. But knowing
how long is too long often is difficult.</p>
<p>Some argue for lengthy tenures. "From my point of view, 25
years is just about right," says Philip G. Barach, chairman
of U.S. Shoe Corp. He recently stepped down as chief
executive of the troubled Cincinnati company after 22 years
in that post. "You bring out the best in people in a stable
environment."</p>
<p>Walter Wriston, who headed Citicorp for 17 years until
retiring six years ago at age 65, agrees in principle that
lengthy service is preferable in some circumstances,
including his own. "If a CEO wants to change the culture or
direction of a big corporation, two years is not enough. If
he or she is only there for two or three years, the
organization is looking intently over your shoulder to see
who the next person is coming along."</p>
<p>Still, even Mr. Wriston has reservations. After too long
at the top, he says, "It's easy to say, `I know the answer to
that,' when the spin that comes over the plate today is
different than on the ball I hit out of the park five years
ago."</p>
<p>A decade or so seems an ideal tenure to many people. Mr.
Perkins, for instance, stepped down at Jewel after 10 years
when he was only 53. "For most people," he says, "a time
frame of 10 to 12 years is probably appropriate" before they
grow stale. "As I discuss this matter with current and past
CEOs, I find a lot of agreement with that."</p>
<p>Indeed, according to studies by executive recruiters
Heidrick & Struggles Inc. in Chicago, many leave even sooner.
According to the firm's studies, chief executives' average
tenure fell to 6.4 years in 1987 from 7.6 years in 1977.</p>
<p>Moreover, in a book on executive succession, Harvard
Business School Prof. Richard Vancil notes that nearly 60% of
chief executives retire when they hit the company age ceiling
at 65 or younger. For the majority of the remainder, terms
are shortened by either failure or the fact that the chiefs
were older than usual when appointed. Only 4% fall into a
category that Prof. Vancil calls "curmudgeons" -- that is,
chief executives who hang on for longer than 12 years.</p>
<p>Jeffrey Sonnenfeld calls them "monarchs" who won't leave
until they are forced out or die. Mr. Sonnenfeld, director of
the Center for Leadership and Career Change at Emory
University's business school, says monarchs are more common
at smaller companies than larger ones, possibly because big
companies are more likely to have a formal succession policy.</p>
<p>One big problem is that too-long tenures tend to drive
away successors. "When we hear a CEO bragging to the press
that he is going to stick around for the next five years or
so, we immediately look at who's under him," says Gerard
Roche, chairman of Heidrick & Struggles, the recruiting firm.</p>
<p>In the case of Chrysler, people close to Mr. Greenwald and
familiar with details of his job switch privately say that
the blocked route to the top of the company was a factor in
his decision to leave to lead a proposed employee buy-out of
United Airlines. Mr. Greenwald says impatience to get to the
top wasn't a factor in his decision. A Chrysler spokesman
said Mr. Iacocca wouldn't comment for this story.</p>
<p>Older chief executives who show no sign of letting up,
such as 92-year-old Armand Hammer, can thwart aspirants.
During his term as chairman of Occidental Petroleum Corp.,
which so far has lasted 33 years, a half-dozen potential
successors have departed, including A. Robert Abboud, now
chairman of First City Bancorp of Texas. Mr. Hammer's current
potential successor, 55-year-old Ray R. Irani, president and
chief operating officer since 1984, was tapped as heir
earlier this year.</p>
<p>But younger chief executives often block the succession
process even more. "We practically do actuarial tables here,
looking at the ages of CEOs," says Mr. Roche, the Heidrick &
Struggles chairman. "Frankly, the {companies} that are very
good hunting fields for us are the ones where the CEO is
young and there are people around him who are his age."</p>
<p>Another problem, experts say, is that the longer the
tenure, the greater the chance of facing multiple crises.
Chief executives who put their stamp on a company early on
may be especially handicapped later.</p>
<p>"Are they able to repudiate themselves?" asks Mary Ann
Devanna, associate dean for executive education at Columbia
University. "It's one thing to come in and say, `This place
is a mess and I'm going to clean it up,' because you have no
ownership in the mess. It's another thing to say, `I've been
in charge of this place for 10 years, and this place has to
go through another revolution.' We don't see much evidence of
people being able to do that."</p>
<p>Long-term incumbents may have spent political capital
earlier in their career. "Going into any job, you have a pile
of poker chips," says James Buttimer, director of
organizational planning at consultants Arthur D. Little Inc.
"You play through your pile, and after X years your pile is
gone. If you overstay your welcome, you've played out your
chips."</p>
<p>Mr. Sonnenfeld's research indicates that it seems harder
for an executive to leave a company in trouble. "The greater
the increases in income and in earnings per share in the two
years prior to the leader's retirement, the cleaner the break
from the firm," Mr. Sonnenfeld writes in a book on
executives' departures. Those with lower profit growth
"resisted retirement more."</p>
<p>Part of the reason might be fear of being blamed. At U.S.
Shoe, the timing of Mr. Barach's resignation as CEO, amid
soft share prices, the failure of a planned unit sale and the
discovery of some accounting irregularities, prompted
speculation that Mr. Barach had been forced out -- which he
vigorously denies.</p>
<p>At Chrysler, a spokesman says that Mr. Iacocca is still
vital, powerful and effective, and still very much involved
in day-to-day affairs of the company. His visibility among
stock analysts and the public is especially important at a
time when the car maker is being rocked by weak sales and
staff cuts. "He's way at the top of the ladder for Chrysler's
needs," says a spokesman. "He hits the ball right out of the
park."</p>
<p>Mr. Iacocca has said he isn't indispensable. Still, some
management specialists say the fact that any chief executive
would appear to be indispensable so late in his tenure is a
sure sign of having stayed too long. "Having the players and
the culture in place so that when the CEO goes, the thing has
a strong engine is the ultimate form of leadership," says
John Kotter, a professor at Harvard Business School and
author of several books on leadership. "Anything else,
including turnarounds, is a lesser act."</p>
