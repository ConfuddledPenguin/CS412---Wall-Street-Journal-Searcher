	<p class="article-leader">Nixdorf Computer AG of West Germany posted a 1989 net loss
of about 1.07 billion marks ($623.5 million), compared with
year-earlier profit of 26.4 million marks after extraordinary
gains.
   The financially troubled computer concern, which is being
taken over by Siemens AG of West Germany, said its pretax
operating loss last year widened to 849 million marks from
59.8 million marks in 1988.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The 1989 net loss figure reflects unspecified charges to
account for the cost of Nixdorf's continuing corporate
overhaul, the company said. In 1988, the modest profit
included 152.8 million marks of extraordinary gains.</p>
<p>Analysts had been anticipating a Nixdorf loss of as much
as one billion marks for 1989, which the company has
characterized as the worst year in its history.</p>
