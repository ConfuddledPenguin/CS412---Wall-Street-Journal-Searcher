	<p class="article-leader">PITTSBURGH -- USX Corp. said 57.1% of its shareholders
rejected a proposal by New York investor Carl Icahn to spin
off at least 80% of the company's steel operations.
   The preliminary count of the May 7 balloting showed that
75,021,397 shares, or 42.9% of shares cast, voted in favor of
the plan, including Mr. Icahn's 33.9 million shares. About
28.4 million shares abstained. Mr. Icahn proposed shedding
steel operations, with shareholders receiving a dividend for
that business.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"In rejecting Mr. Icahn's call to spin off the steel
business as a dividend, the shareholders have decisively
supported our policy of well considered and prudent corporate
change," said USX chairman Charles A. Corry.</p>
<p>Mr. Icahn said his proposal failed because a handful of
institutions, while agreeing with his goal, voted with the
company because of "strong indications" that management would
undertake a restructuring. They were afraid, he said, "a
positive vote might have the `backlash' effect of restricting
their methods of restructuring."</p>
<p>The company won all but two of the 11 proposals before
shareholders. In those two instances, shareholders favored
the right to vote on the company's shareholder rights plan
and the right to keep votes confidential. Both proposals were
recommendations and, as such, aren't binding. But they likely
will be reviewed by the board.</p>
<p>Mr. Icahn said he was "particularly interested" in the
company's response to what is "now a shareholder mandate to
remove or submit to a vote the company's `poison pill.'"</p>
