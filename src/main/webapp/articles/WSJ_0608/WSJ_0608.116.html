	<p class="article-leader">IRT Corp. said it has completed new lender bank agreements
and a private-equity financing of about $4 million, led by
Euro-American-I L.P. of Menlo Park, Calif.
   IRT, which makes automated X-ray equipment used to monitor
manufacturing processes, said the equity investment consists
of about $4 million of convertible preferred stock purchased
by investors and members of the IRT board. Four of the five
IRT board members are buying some $650,000 of the preferred,
each share of which is priced at $16 and is convertible into
10 common shares. The stock initially carries a cumulative
annual dividend of 7%.</p>

used in part to pay existing credit with Sanwa Bank. IRT also
said Sanwa has renewed its line of credit for $3 million
through April 1, 1991, under new agreements.</p>
<p>In addition, IRT said that Citibank, a unit of Citicorp,
restructured a $5 million senior subordinated note to an
amended senior subordinated seven-year note with amortization
beginning in fiscal year 1993. The note initially has reduced
interest rates. Citibank also forgave a note for $885,000,
originally due April 1, 1990, and forgave accrued but unpaid
interest of about $200,000.</p>
