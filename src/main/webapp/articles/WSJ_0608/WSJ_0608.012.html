	<p class="article-leader">Cold, wet weather damped May sales for many of the
nation's largest retailers, which may now be forced to slash
prices on slow-moving summer clothes.
   Sales in May rose an average of about 3.5% from
year-earlier results, falling short of year-to-date gains of
about 5%. But analysts blamed bad weather in the East and
Midwest in the second half of the month, rather than a
significant change in consumer-spending habits, for the
disappointing numbers.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"It has been a mediocre environment," declared Edward
Weller of Montgomery Securities. "Warmer weather in February
and March led some observers to believe the underlying
strength of the consumer was greater than it is. . . . Now it
looks worse because of weather-inhibited sales."</p>
<p>Mr. Weller added that he expects spending to remain weak
because of the thrift crisis and sluggish demand for durable
goods.</p>
<p>The unseasonably cold weather hurt May sales of bathing
suits, shorts and other summer clothes as well as lumber,
patio and barbecue supplies, gardening equipment and air
conditioners, the analysts said.</p>
<p>If the weather doesn't break soon, consumers could find
big bargains. "Markdowns will begin by the third week in June
if sales trends haven't changed," predicted Barry Bryant of
Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. Such markdowns would depress
retailers' second-quarter profits.</p>
<p>Indeed, some analysts started cutting their Gap Inc.
forecasts yesterday, sending the specialty retailer's stock
tumbling $4.375 to close at $58.50 in composite trading on
the New York Stock Exchange. Although Gap reported a
respectable 6% gain in May sales at stores open at least a
year, the chain had planned for a bigger increase. Limited
Inc. shares also fell on news that it posted a 6% gain in
same-store sales, closing at $47.375, down $1.875, in Big
Board composite trading. Analysts said investors were
disappointed by soft same-store stores at the company's key
Limited division.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Wal-Mart Stores Inc., a rapidly growing
discounter, continued to outpace its rivals with an 11% gain
in same-store sales.</p>
<p>Other big retailers didn't fare as well. Sears, Roebuck &
Co. and K mart Corp. each said same-store sales rose a meager
0.9%. And at J.C. Penney Co., comparable-store sales gained
only 1%. Dayton Hudson Corp.'s same-store sales rose 4.2%.
Its Mervyn's stores and Target discount division more than
compensated for a weather-related 4% decline in same-store
sales at its department stores in the upper Midwest.</p>
<p>Same-store sales rose 4% at May Department Stores Co., 3%
at Woolworth Corp.'s U.S. divisions and 2.2% at Carter Hawley
Hale Stores Inc. Mercantile Stores Co. reported a 1% increase
in same-store sales, while Hills Department Stores Inc. said
same-store sales fell 4.1%.</p>
<p>Same-store sales, meanwhile, rose 9.5% at Neiman Marcus
Group Inc., a specialty-store chain with a big presence in
the West, where bad weather wasn't a factor.</p>
