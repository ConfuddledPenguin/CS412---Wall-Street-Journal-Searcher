	<p class="article-leader">LONDON -- Takeover talk is back in the British market
after more than a half-year's absence, fueled by new and old
rumors and one or two deals.
   But equity analysts don't foresee a rerun of last year's
record level of merger mania -- #26.1 billion ($44.07
billion) in mergers and acquisitions were completed in 1989
-- and are skeptical that the talk will add an extra punch to
the London market's current upward thrust.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The bid business that does get done, analysts say, is more
likely to be through mergers than outright takeovers. With
companies generally short of cash, interest rates high, and
the stock market rallying, share swaps will be back in vogue.
Cash-based acquisitions, which some analysts say accounted
for between 70% and 80% of takeovers in 1989, will be few.</p>
<p>"The balance sheets in the corporate sector are severely
stretched," implying that the aggressive takeover behavior of
last year won't recur, Richard Kersley, an analyst at
Barclays de Zoete Wedd Ltd., said.</p>
<p>Analysts said Rank Organisation PLC's pending bid for
Mecca Leisure Group PLC on a part share-swap basis typifies
the type of merger activity expected this year. Willis Faber
PLC, a British insurance brokerage, is merging with a U.S.
counterpart, Corroon & Black Corp., through an exchange of
shares.</p>
<p>Mr. Kersley and other analysts say they expect overall
corporate investment in 1990, including spending on
acquisitions, to fall sharply from year-earlier levels, as
earnings growth slows.</p>
<p>Randall Goldsmith, an analyst at James Capel & Co.,
estimated that earnings growth for British companies,
excluding the financial and oil sectors, will average 7.4%
this year, compared with 9.4% last year. Though analysts
still consider this pace reasonably buoyant, companies
clearly aren't as well-positioned to launch the staggering
cash-based takeover bids characteristic of 1989. Those
resulted in a net injection of about #15 billion into the
market, according to Glenn Davies, an analyst at Laing &
Cruickshank Ltd.</p>
<p>Chief among these was the joint #2.04 billion bid by
General Electric Co. -- unrelated to the U.S. company of the
same name -- and Siemens AG of West Germany for Plessey Co.,
and Hanson PLC's #3.5 billion takeover of Consolidated Gold
Fields PLC. A Hoylake Investments Ltd. consortium's #13.4
billion bid for B.A.T Industries PLC also stirred up
excitement, until it ran into trouble late last year.</p>
<p>While the move on B.A.T failed for reasons of its own,
other takeover attempts stalled for reasons more closely tied
to the economic climate. Perhaps the most significant example
was the failure of a British Airways PLC-backed attempt to
acquire UAL Corp., the Chicago-based parent of United
Airlines, last October for lack of financing. News of that
bid's demise helped push the London market into a slump from
which it only recently recovered.</p>
<p>But as the British stock market rebounds from recent lows,
the high interest rates and lenders' skittish sentiment that
crushed the British Airways-UAL plan remain. Against that
background, analysts question whether big cash bids backed by
borrowing are feasible.</p>
<p>Thus, analysts tend to dismiss much of the current bid
speculation, including talk that a private investor group is
eyeing Scottish & Newcastle Breweries PLC.</p>
<p>"We wonder if (any bidder) will be able to generate proper
financing," said Ian Brenner, a Kleinwort Benson Securities
dealer specializing in the brewery sector.</p>
<p>High interest rates -- British base rates are at 15% --
are cited by some analysts as a very real impediment to
takeover business. Debt-financed deals, such as Magnet Group
PLC's management buy-out, proved to be "sobering
experiences," said Mr. Kersley of Barclays de Zoete Wedd.</p>
<p>But other analysts maintained that high interest rates
don't necessarily have an effect on takeover activity, noting
that rates were already at their current highs in the 1989
third quarter, when takeover activity was intense.</p>
<p>Indeed, noted Laing & Cruickshank's Mr. Davies, high
interest rates, producing weaker corporate profitability,
could encourage takeovers, as some companies become more
vulnerable to their fitter competitors. But he too cautioned
that such business will be minimal, compared with previous
years. "Until interest rates come down," he said, "don't
expect much takeover activity within the U.K."</p>
