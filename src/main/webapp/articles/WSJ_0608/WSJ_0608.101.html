	<p class="article-leader">WHITE HOUSE WORRY: Will Greenspan cut rates to support a
budget deal?
   The Fed chairman's tight-fisted policies have
administration officials on edge. They believe last month's
weak employment growth should have prodded the Fed to ease;
they argue that with the economy already growing at less than
2% a year, a stingy Fed could mistakenly tip that into
negative numbers.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>But the big issue, Bush aides say, is whether the Fed will
provide a major cut in short-term rates if there is a budget
accord with Congress. The administration thinks a deal should
be worth at least 1 1/2 percentage points. But Greenspan
indicates the Fed would pursue a more cautious path.</p>
<p>"The odds are high they will move when the time comes,"
says an administration aide. "The question is whether it will
be far enough or fast enough."</p>
<p>MANDELA AIMS to use his U.S. trip to keep the heat on
South Africa.</p>
<p>Despite President de Klerk's partial lifting of the state
of emergency, the African National Congress leader will use
his June 26 speech to a joint session of Congress to rebut
arguments from U.S. conservatives that sanctions should be
eased. He will stress the importance of isolating South
Africa until apartheid truly is dead.</p>
<p>The rest of his trip will be used to generate U.S.
political support and raise money. In addition to a New York
ticker-tape parade, he plans appearances in Boston, Atlanta,
Detroit and Oakland, as well as a Miami address to AFSCME to
thank organized labor for its anti-apartheid stance. A major
event in Los Angeles will seek financial support from the
entertainment industry.</p>
<p>SUMMIT DEALS raise political hackles in both the Soviet
Union and U.S.</p>
<p>Soviet press commentaries increasingly complain that while
the Soviets are giving up their military edge on land, Bush
refuses to negotiate cuts in navies, a traditional area of
American strength. Shevardnadze warns Baker that the newly
independent Supreme Soviet might balk at ratifying pacts it
sees as unequal.</p>
<p>In the U.S., meanwhile, conservatives criticize the trade
treaty and other economic moves as sops to Gorbachev just
when he is losing power to Yeltsin and others. "Bush is about
six months behind in understanding how far along the
disintegration of the Soviet Union is," says Heritage
Foundation official Kim Holmes.</p>
<p>Conservatives complain the chemical weapons treaty isn't
verifiable.</p>
<p>DEMOCRATS CHEER the weak showing of Montana GOP Senate
candidate Kolstad in Tuesday's primary; they now think Sen.
Baucus could have an easier time than anticipated. The
Republicans, meanwhile, say North Carolina Sen. Helms will
have no problem painting Democratic nominee Gantt, who is
black, as ultraliberal. But Democratic strategists think
Gantt will be able to raise a lot of money for his uphill
battle.</p>
<p>SPRING SLUMP? The high-powered Democratic political
consulting firm of Doak, Shrum & Associates isn't off to a
good start this year. Their candidates have already lost
high-stakes gubernatorial primaries in Texas, California and
Iowa, and trail in Georgia and Florida. Says Bob Shrum:
"Unlike some people in this business, we do difficult
campaigns."</p>
<p>NERVOUS REGULATORS await Tuesday's first-quarter banking
report. Delinquencies on consumer loans have been creeping up
in recent quarters; the number typically drops off in the
first quarter, but that might not happen this time, which
would indicate consumers are living beyond their means and
that banks ought to worry.</p>
<p>INFRA REDS: Gorbachev had hardly left town when salesmen
for the Soviet space agency arrived to pitch their Almaz
radar satellite, which can take pictures through cloud cover
and at night. The Soviets believe the technology --
originally developed to track U.S. aircraft carriers -- will
draw customers ranging from oil companies to urban planners.</p>
<p>PRESSURE GROWS to allow more flights into already
congested airports.</p>
<p>Prodded by upstart America West Airlines, the Senate
Commerce Committee is working on a bill to loosen or
eliminate limits on the number of flights into LaGuardia,
JFK, O'Hare and Washington National. Landing rights are
currently dominated by more-established carriers, leading
newer competitors to complain they are shut out of lucrative
markets.</p>
<p>Transportation Department officials worry that changing
the current system would increase noise and overcrowding
problems, and could raise safety questions as well. To defuse
congressional pressure, though, they might fashion a
compromise requiring airlines that don't use their slots
enough to cede them to others.</p>
<p>Secretary Skinner says the issue is "something we wish we
didn't have to decide."</p>
<p>MINOR MEMOS: The sole GOP candidate to oppose Georgia Sen.
Nunn withdrew from the race after the check for her filing
fee bounced. . . . Ever since Gorbachev threw a horseshoe
ringer at Camp David, White House chief of staff Sununu
claims he's being accused of magnetizing the stake to assure
success. . . . Departing FDIC chief Seidman, a last-minute
speech replacement for Quayle, said he was disappointed
because he wanted to hear what the vice president thinks --
"if he does" -- about the competitive woes of U.S. banks.</p>
