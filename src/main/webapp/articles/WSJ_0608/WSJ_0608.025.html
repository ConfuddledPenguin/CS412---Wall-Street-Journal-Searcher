	<p class="article-leader">HQ OFFICE SUPPLIES WAREHOUSE Inc. said it began an
offering of 10,000 units priced at $1,000 each. Each unit
entitles the holder to $1,000 principal amount of a
convertible debenture, due June 1, 1995, and 200 Class C
warrants. Each warrant entitles the holder to buy one Class A
common share for $6. The office products retailer, based in
Long Beach, Calif., said it expects net proceeds of about
$8.6 million from the offering, with a portion to be used for
expansion in the Southern California market.</p>
