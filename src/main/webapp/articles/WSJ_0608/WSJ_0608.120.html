	<p class="article-leader">PARIS -- Total-Cie. Francaise des Petroles intends to put
its Paris headquarters up for sale in the near future, but
the oil concern gave no indication of the size of the capital
gain the sale would bring.
   Company Chairman Serge Tchuruk told shareholders that the
oil group also intends to boost its capital base in the near
future, but he declined to reveal the magnitude of the
planned capital increase.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Mr. Tchuruk said the group's financial performance since
the beginning of this year has been satisfactory in the
exploration and production sectors, while refining and
distribution businesses have been steady but still below
average industry levels of profitability in Europe.</p>
<p>Mr. Tchuruk said it is "imperative" for Total to improve
its profitability. He pointed out that last year Total's
profitability, defined by earnings as a percentage of
revenue, was 6.4%, well below the industry average of 9%. He
said it was Total's firm intention to improve the group's
profitability to more than 10%, if possible, within the next
2 1/2 years.</p>
<p>Answering shareholders' criticism that the group's
dividend has remained unchanged since 1985, Mr. Tchuruk said
Total shareholders fare much better than those of most other
big French groups in terms of dividend as a percentage of
earnings per share.</p>
<p>In Total's case, this came out at 38% for 1989 compared
with 30% for a sample group of 14 big French industrial
groups, he said. He also noted that Total's shares were
yielding 4.2% on the basis of a share price of around 700
francs ($122.81), compared with 2.6% for the sample group.</p>
<p>Mr. Tchuruk, who is also Total's chief executive officer,
said the group's 400 million tons of crude-oil reserves in
the Middle East will become an increasingly strategic asset,
as the region will become the key area for the international
oil market.</p>
<p>He reaffirmed his belief that there is no future for the
petrochemical industry in countries that are oil importers.
But he said Total is studying possible partnerships in the
petrochemical field with concerns from oil producing
countries.</p>
