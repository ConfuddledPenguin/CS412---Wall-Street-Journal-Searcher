	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- The World Bank approved a $250 million loan
to Poland to increase natural-gas production and reduce the
country's dependence on coal.
   The bank said its loan will help finance rehabilitation of
existing gas fields and expansion of gas-transmission and
storage facilities. The European Investment Bank also will
provide Poland with a $60 million credit for the same
projects, World Bank officials said.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"As Poland moves toward a market economy, demand for gas
and oil is expected to increase, while demand for coal, which
produces large quantities of air pollution, is expected to
decrease," the World Bank said.</p>
<p>The Energy Sector Management Assistance Program, jointly
financed by the World Bank and the United Nations Development
Program, will provide Poland with technical assistance on
pricing gas and setting up a contractual framework to expand
the country's petroleum industry through foreign and domestic
private-sector enterprises.</p>
<p>In other actions, the World Bank cleared a $190 million
loan to Indonesia to improve public-water-supply facilities
in the Jakarta region, while the International Development
Association, a bank affiliate, approved a $175 million credit
to Bangladesh to strengthen the country's banking and
financial system.</p>
<p>The bank also approved a $50 million loan to Papua New
Guinea to support economic reforms and help maintain
financial stability in the wake of the closing of the
country's main gold and copper mine.</p>
<p>In addition, the bank cleared a $32 million loan to
Algeria and a $17 million loan to Tunisia to help finance
agricultural research.</p>
<p>The World Bank loans will be at variable interest rates,
currently 7.75% a year; the IDA credit to Bangladesh will be
interest-free but will involve administrative fees.</p>
