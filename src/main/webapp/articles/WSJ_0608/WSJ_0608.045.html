	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- The U.S. Forest Service plans a significant
cutback in logging in national forests over the next five
years while putting greater emphasis on recreation and
wildlife protection.
   The annual harvest of timber in national forests averaged
12.2 billion board feet from 1983 through 1988, but it will
fall to 10.8 billion board feet by 1995 under the Forest
Service's new master plan for managing its vast domain of
natural resources. The annual harvest rate won't be restored
to the 12 billion board feet range until the year 2040,
despite a projected 79% increase in demand for hardwoods and
a 35% increase for softwoods by then.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The agency also plans to permit less livestock grazing on
national forest land, an important source of pasture for the
nation's cattle and sheep industries.</p>
<p>"We are looking at multiple-use management from a new
perspective," said Agriculture Secretary Clayton Yeutter.
"Where timber and mineral production and livestock grazing
cannot be accomplished in an environmentally acceptable
manner, production levels will be reduced."</p>
<p>Representatives of the timber industry warned that the
plan will only aggravate tight timber supplies, particularly
in the Pacific Northwest. Luke Popovich, spokesman for the
American Forest Council, dismissed the Forest Service's
projections as "essentially useless" because they ignore such
critical factors as the anticipated listing of the rare
northern spotted owl as a threatened species. The industry
fears the listing will trigger logging bans across large
sections of northern California, Oregon and Washington. The
U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service is due to rule on the owl's
status by June 23.</p>
<p>The Forest Service's five-year plan calls for greater
environmental sensitivity and a better balance among multiple
uses of public lands. Among other things, the agency intends
to permit 49% less clear-cutting of national forests by 1995.</p>
<p>Clear-cutting, unlike selective cutting of trees, is
regarded as environmentally harmful because it causes soil
erosion and destroys wildlife habitat. The plan also
strengthens the Forest Service's commitment to protecting
"special places" and expanding wilderness areas.</p>
<p>Under the new plan, the Forest Service projects its annual
costs will hit $3 billion by 1995. Last year, its programs
cost $2.3 billion. Jobs created by Forest Service activities,
including logging, are expected to total 623,000 by 1995, up
49,000 from 1989.</p>
