	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- In the third major spill this year in New York
Harbor, a British-registered oil tanker ran aground, spilling
about 260,000 gallons of heavy crude oil.
   New York and New Jersey officials reacted angrily, some
calling the spill a consequence of the failure of the Reagan
administration to require tougher safety standards for
tankers, such as double hulls. By late-afternoon, a strike
force of the U.S. Coast Guard that specializes in oil-spill
cleanups arrived from its station in Mobile, Ala.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The single-hull tanker, BT Nautilus, was being guided by
two tugboats when it went aground in the Kill van Kull, a
narrow waterway between New York City's borough of Staten
Island and the marine terminals of New Jersey. The other
spills this year involved ruptured pipelines or leaks at
facilities.</p>
<p>By noon, tanker Captain Frank Ainscrough and several crew
members had been given urinalysis tests to check whether they
were impaired by alcohol or drugs. Later in the afternoon,
investigators for the New Jersey attorney general arrested
the first mate, Geoffrey Frederick Gregory. He was scheduled
to be arraigned last night on charges of operating a vessel
while under the influence of intoxicants and of discharging a
pollutant without a permit. A criminal inquiry of possible
violations of the state's environmental laws is continuing.</p>
<p>It wasn't clear what caused the tanker to run aground.
Several officials, along with Judith Yaskin, New Jersey's
commissioner of environmental protection, noted that
navigational charts of the area included a warning of a large
rock in the Kill van Kull. "We don't know if we have a case
for negligence here," she said. "This still has to be
investigated."</p>
<p>The Coast Guard said the Army Corps of Engineers is
dredging the waterway to make it deeper, but a project to
blast heavy rock formations in the area won't begin until at
least year end.</p>
<p>Coast Guard Capt. Robert North, who is coordinating the
spill cleanup, said the BT Nautilus was inspected by the
Coast Guard in Philadelphia in August and its
pollution-prevention, navigational and cargo-containment
equipment were found to be in good condition.</p>
<p>Capt. James Sanial, chief of marine inspection for the
port, added that the 11-year-old ship was cited by the Coast
Guard on only one occasion, in 1986, for not having correct
navigational maps. "That's the only problem we know of," he
said.</p>
<p>The ship, which is owned by the Nautilus Motor Tanker Co.,
London, a subsidiary of BT Shipping Ltd., of Bermuda, was
carrying 350,000 barrels, or 12.6 million gallons, of No. 6
crude.</p>
<p>The starboard hold where the rupture occurred, had 1.2
million gallons. By late morning, booms were erected around
the ship and oil was siphoned off up to the 30-foot rupture
point. "There was no more product going into the
environment," said a Coast Guard spokesman. However, the
cleanup of the spill will take at least a month, another
spokesman said.</p>
<p>The crude is owned by Coastal Corp., Houston, and was
loaded in the west African nation of Cameroon. Coastal plans
to distribute the oil to industrial customers.</p>
<p>Angry officials from New York and New Jersey appeared
exasperated as they stood at Coastal's shoreline facility in
Bayonne, N.J., near where the BT Nautilus was being pumped.
"The message here is the folly of the Reagan Administration's
policy to abandon the double-bottom ships," said Thomas C.
Jorling, commissioner of the New York State Department of
Environmental Conservation.</p>
<p>Ms. Yaskin said "taxpayers won't pay for this cleanup.
We're going to charge the {responsible parties} for cleanup
costs, property damage and any other penalties that exist
under our spill laws."</p>
<p>"We're getting sick and tired of the repetitive nature of
these spills," said Sen. Frank Lautenberg (D., N.J.). "Here
we've had 40% of the significant spills {in the country} this
year and the {Coast Guard's} national strike team is based in
Alabama."</p>
<p>Moments later, when Rear Adm. Richard Rybacki, commander
of the First Coast Guard District, Boston, Mass., walked over
to greet the senator, Mr. Lautenberg asked sarcastically, "So
Admiral, has your ace force arrived yet? We have too much
activity here. We have to have the best facilities possible"
for handling oil spills. The admiral stared at the senator
while an aide said the strike team would arrive in 15
minutes.</p>
