	<p class="article-leader">Coloroll Group PLC said it went into receivership after
the company was unable to arrange a refinancing strategy with
Candover Investments PLC, a venture capital group.
   Coloroll, a U.K. home fashion and home products concern,
has been involved in talks with Candover since May. Coloroll
issued a strong profit warning in January, as returns from
various operations waned in the wake of a downturn in the
U.K. housing market and consumer spending.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Accounting firm Ernst & Young, the appointed receiver, and
Coloroll weren't available to comment.</p>
<p>Financial problems have dogged Coloroll for several
months, as the group's ratio of debt to equity rose following
the purchase of John Crowther Group PLC, a British cloth and
carpets maker, in a stock swap for #215 million ($363
million).</p>
<p>Coloroll planned to sell off several Crowther units, but
they became less attractive as U.K. interest rates rose
before the sales could be put into effect.</p>
<p>For the six months to Sept. 30, Coloroll reported a 50%
drop in pretax profit to #10.1 million.</p>
