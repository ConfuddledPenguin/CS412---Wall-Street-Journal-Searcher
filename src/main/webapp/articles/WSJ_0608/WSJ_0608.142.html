	<p class="article-leader">Valmont Industries Inc. said its second-quarter earnings
won't equal last year's second quarter, but will exceed the
$4.5 million, or 38 cents a share, it earned in the first
quarter.
   In the second quarter of 1989, the maker of irrigation
systems and industrial products earned $6.1 million, or $1.05
a share, on sales of $199.6 million.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Valmont of Valley, Neb., said its second-quarter
performance of 1990 is the result of sales in its irrigation
markets slowing sooner than expected. The lower activity was
due to an early spring planting season and abundant rainfalls
in irrigation markets, as well as the slowing of industrial
products sales in construction markets.</p>
<p>The company said that, while its second-quarter earnings
will be lower than last year's, it expects earnings for 1990
will exceed the 1989 level of $20.7 million, or $1.78 a
share, on sales of $789.8 million.</p>
