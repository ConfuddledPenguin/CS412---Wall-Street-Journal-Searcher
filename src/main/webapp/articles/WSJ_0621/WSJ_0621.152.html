	<div class="article-body"><p>YUPPIE, THE 1980'S ACRONYM for "young urban professional,"
became a synonym for greedy strivers. Like most blanket
condemnations, it was wrong.</p>
<p>A few typical young New York professionals banded together
in 1985 to figure out how busy people with little free time
could do volunteer work. Today, New York Cares, the
organization they formed, sends hundreds of volunteers to
staff soup kitchens, visit the elderly, haul debris at
low-cost housing sites, look after AIDS sufferers and crack
babies, tutor children, and pitch in on the myriad thankless
tasks imposed by inner-city problems.</p>
<p>Real estate analyst Andrea Gittings was one of the
original four, along with Andrew Luger, now an assistant U.S.
attorney, and Jeanne Straus, who works in her family's
broadcasting business. Ms. Gittings says the idea sprang from
seeing the "people we had to step over on the way to work."
By 1988, the four had an organization, a full-time director
and a mailing address.</p>
<p>The nerve center of New York Cares is a four-room walk-up
a block from Bloomingdale's, which executive director Kenneth
Adams rents for only $6,000 a year. ("The landlady like
volunteers," he says.) Besides Mr. Adams, the overhead is his
staff of three. Everything else, from paint and furniture to
computers and legal services, is donated. Working with a 1990
budget of less than $200,000, Mr. Adams runs an army of 3,000
volunteers, about 700 of them working at any one time on one
of his 60-odd "team projects." Fifty to 70 of his young
volunteers keep track of the rest, others run orientation
sessions for the approximately 130 new volunteers that show
up each month.</p>
<p>The disparity between the size of Mr. Adams's army and the
number at work is dictated by the nature of New York Cares.
All are young, 25 to 35, most are single, and all have
full-time jobs. The time they give comes after (or before)
regular jobs. For some, this is once a week, for others once
a month, and some at even longer intervals.</p>
<p>The wide variety of chores is an advantage. Volunteers
stand ready to give time but are not sure what jobs they can
handle. One young woman, for instance, explained that she
started taking city children on outings but discovered "I
couldn't stand kids." Now she hauls trash from housing-rehab
sites. "You'd be surprised," she says, "at the satisfaction
you can get when you see a dumpster finally fill up."</p>
<p>The recruiting, all word of mouth, produces remarkably
durable connections. Founder Gittings, for example, still
puts in 15 hours a week as president and treasurer of New
York Cares and finds time to visit a disabled man each week.
Ms. Straus, a director, does the same for a house-bound
woman. Mr. Luger gave up the New York Cares presidency when
he went into public service but is still on the board and
manages one shut-in visit a week.</p>
<p>Mr. Adams, a 30-year-old, Manhattan-born graduate of
Vermont's Middlebury College, passed up a shot at Yale's
management school to take on his job at New York Cares. ("My
mother still wonders.") A slender, intense embodiment of a
Central Casting yuppie, he sees New York Cares developing
into a Peace Corps for the Big Apple. He thinks it could
serve as a model for a national network of volunteer bands of
young professionals. (Two copies have been created in Atlanta
and Washington, D.C.) Now he is helping New York corporations
organize in-house volunteer organizations.</p>
<p>Mr. Adams's only concern is the same one Ms. Gittings
remembers. "The volunteers are out there. Our nightmare is we
could be overwhelmed by their numbers."</p>
