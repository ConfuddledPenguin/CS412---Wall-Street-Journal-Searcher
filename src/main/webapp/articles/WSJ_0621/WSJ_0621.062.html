	<p class="article-leader">Travelers Corp. said it will no longer write homeowner and
auto insurance in nine states as part of a major revision of
its personal-lines business.
   The Hartford, Conn.-based insurer is also reducing its
agency force and revamping its commission scale, tying fees
the company pays agents directly to the profitability of the
policies they write.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Travelers has informed the insurance departments in
Arkansas, Idaho, Nevada, Oklahoma, North Dakota, South
Dakota, South Carolina, Wyoming and West Virginia that it's
leaving the auto and homeowner markets. The company said it
had a small share of the auto and homeowner market in these
states and it saw little chance of future growth. In 1989,
$42 million out of the $1.7 billion in personal-lines
premiums came from these nine states.</p>
<p>Ronald E. Foley, senior vice president in charge of
Travelers' personal lines, said the company wants "to focus
{its} resources on markets where there is the greatest
potential for long-term growth and profitability."</p>
<p>The withdrawal from the nine states will affect some 230
agents, Travelers said. Earlier this year, the company began
streamlining its entire personal-lines operations,
eliminating 500 to 600 jobs in over 90 field offices
throughout the country. Already some 900 agents are no longer
writing personal insurance for the company.</p>
<p>The company has already been cutting back its
personal-lines business selectively in a number of states.
It's no longer writing new auto insurance policies in
Pennsylvania and it has nearly completed its withdrawal from
the auto insurance market in California.</p>
<p>Travelers is adopting a variable commission schedule for
agents selling auto insurance. The company will pay a higher
commission to agents writing profitable policies and less to
those who bring in more risky drivers. Several other insurers
have changed their commission scales, hoping to provide their
agents with some incentive to write better risk and more
profitable business.</p>
<p>Alice Cornish, an insurance industry analyst with
Northington Partners, said the change in Travelers
commissions scale is far more important because it should
help improve the profitability of its auto book of business.
During the first quarter, Travelers paid out $1.18 in claims
and expenses for every dollar of auto insurance premium
collected. That's worse than the industry average of about
$1.10 in claims and expenses.</p>
<p>In the 1990 first quarter, the company lost $4 million in
its personal-lines business, compared to net income of $7
million in the year-earlier period. For 1989, it posted a $13
million loss, after earning $29 million from personal lines
in 1988.</p>
