	<p class="article-leader">British Coal Corp.'s pension funds increased their hostile
takeover offer for Globe Investment Trust PLC's ordinary
shares to 205 pence ($3.53) from 191 pence.
   The new offer, which the pension funds declared final
unless a rival bidder appears, values Globe at #1.11 billion
($1.91 billion).</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The coal pension funds launched their bid in April and had
succeeded in gaining acceptances for only 1.42% of Globe
shares. Prior to launching the bid, the pension funds owned
slightly less than 34% of Globe.</p>
