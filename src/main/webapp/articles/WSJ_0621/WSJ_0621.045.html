	<p class="article-leader">Allegheny Ludlum Corp., Pittsburgh, said it has
accelerated its previously announced plans to build and
operate a commercial prototype thin-strip direct-casting
machine to produce stainless and carbon steel flat products.
   The machine will be designed and installed by the
specialty steel producer's joint venture partner,
Voest-Alpine Industrieanlagenbau Ges.m.b.H., of Linz,
Austria. Voest-Alpine is a supplier of casting machines.
Terms were not disclosed.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Allegheny Ludlum did not say where the plant housing the
machine will be located but said construction will begin in
the second quarter of 1991 and is expected to be completed in
the second half of 1991.</p>
<p>The company said it expects the new process to advance
state-of-the-art steelmaking significantly because it
eliminates the need for conventional slag or ingot casting or
hot strip rolling that currently is used by metal concerns.
The new process, Allegheny Ludlum said, is expected to be
commercially available in the mid-1990s.</p>
