	<p class="article-leader">Until now, mainstream black leaders and civil rights
groups have been conspicuously absent from the debate over
whether certain rap-music lyrics are obscene.
   But yesterday, the National Association for the
Advancement of Colored People broke that silence -- and its
response provides no comfort to embattled rap group 2 Live
Crew, which is fighting obscenity charges in South Florida
and elsewhere.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"Our cultural experience does not include debasing our
women, the glorification of violence, the promotion of
deviant sexual behavior or the tearing into shreds of our
cherished mores and standards of behavior," says NAACP
Executive Director Benjamin L. Hooks in a statement, which
otherwise reiterates the NAACP's support for First Amendment
rights.</p>
<p>Mr. Hooks's statement seems to reflect a fundamental
disagreement in the black community over whether the
ultra-raw lyrics of many rap songs legitimately reflect the
black cultural experience.</p>
<p>Many middle-class blacks identify strongly with values
they link to upward mobility -- family, work and faith. They
say they are put off by the celebration of values from the
streets, including violence and exploitation of women, that
inform much of rap music. And they have been indifferent, at
best, to 2 Live Crew's call for support of what the rap group
claims to be an African-American art form.</p>
<p>When 2 Live Crew leader Luther Campbell appeared on a
television talk show Monday to defend his controversial
album, "As Nasty As They Wanna Be," NAACP headquarters in
Baltimore was besieged with phone calls. The callers "took
offense at his attributing these sentiments to black culture
and wrapping it in the mantle of black tradition," says an
NAACP spokesman.</p>
<p>The NAACP response didn't surprise Henry Louis Gates Jr.,
a professor of English at Duke University who's considered
one of the leading scholars on African-American literature.
He says this type of conflict goes back as far as the Harlem
Renaissance in the 1920s, when middle-class progressive
figures such as W.E.B. DuBois, one of the NAACP's founders,
maintained that black art must serve the aims of political
and social advancement.</p>
<p>Mr. DuBois criticized blues music from the fields as
setting blacks back, especially in the eyes of whites, Mr.
Gates says. Middle-class blacks today take a similar view, he
says. They don't feel "a revulsion to obscenity {in rap},
it's a revulsion to a reminder of roots that they'd rather
suppress." Mr. Gates, who doesn't excuse the sexism in
"Nasty," maintains that the lyrics are squarely within the
black vernacular tradition.</p>
<p>Mr. Gates sees a greater danger in the cool reaction of
middle-class leaders than in the record's possible obscenity.
Racism lies at the root of the attacks on the rap group, he
says, adding, "The failure to defend 2 Live Crew reveals the
ignorance of how dangerous this case is to us all."</p>
<p>Some other black opinion leaders agree that whether the
album is African-American art or obscenity, 2 Live Crew must
be defended. "The snowballing legal actions against them
nationwide puts us on the slippery slope of the majority
defining what is art -- and for a minority that's a dangerous
position to be in," says Robert Johnson, president of Black
Entertainment Television, the black-oriented cable service
that reaches 30 million homes.</p>
<p>Set against this view are those of some black social
thinkers who say that defending the lyrics as art reinforces
values that are destroying the black "underclass," the group
rap music claims to represent.</p>
<p>"It does make me squeamish," says San Francisco
sociologist Nathan Hare at the thought of 2 Live Crew lawyer
Bruce Rogow arguing in court that use of the term "bitch" for
a female is a cultural norm for the black underclass. The
term, used 163 times on the album, is one of its kinder
references to women. "It's not black art, it's art that some
young black people are practicing now," says Mr. Hare. He
adds that "we like chitterlings {a stew of pig intestines},
but that doesn't mean it's good food."</p>
<p>Most rap music doesn't contain anywhere near the level of
graphic acts of male sexual dominance that 2 Live Crew
features. Since its emergence in the late 1970s, rap lyrics
have moved rapidly from harmless chants about the rapper's
prowess with a microphone and turntables to stories of ghetto
alienation and most recently to assertions of "Afrocentric"
values. These have often included anti-drug and anti-violence
themes. But songs that push an image of black male potency
based on female exploitation, like "Pimpin' Ain't Easy" on
Big Daddy Kane's latest album, also have been an unquestioned
staple of the repertoire until "Nasty" became the first album
to be ruled obscene by a judge.</p>
<p>"Rap has always been on a collision course" with
middle-class values, both black and white, says Village Voice
writer Barry Michael Cooper. "That's where it gets its edge."
He adds, "I'm glad this is happening, because it's going to
make rap artists re-examine where they're coming from and
rethink their values."</p>
<p>Washington Post columnist Courtland Milloy, who writes
about black social issues and who came down hard on 2 Live
Crew in his column last week, also looks forward to the
coming debate over rap's place in the black community. "It's
futile to try to suppress this thing with court action. But
if this case can be used to get people on the record saying
we don't like having young black men talking about abusing
women and girls, and by extension themselves, then let the
trials begin."</p>
