	<p class="article-leader">LONDON -- Net new investment in U.K. unit trusts totaled
#191.9 million ($330.3 million) in May, up more than 12 times
from #15.6 million in April, the Unit Trust Association said.
   The latest month's figure for the trusts, similar to
open-ended mutual funds, is down 12% from the #219.4 million
in net new investment recorded a year earlier.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The value of funds under management by association members
rose 7.1% to #57.1 billion from #53.3 billion in April and
10% from #51.7 billion a year earlier.</p>
<p>The association attributed the performance to the upturn
in the value of both the U.K. and other major world stock
markets during the month.</p>
<p>Sales of unit trust shares to investors were up 13% to
#754 million in May from #666 million in April but were off
