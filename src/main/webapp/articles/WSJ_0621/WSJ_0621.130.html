plans to locate a research and development facility at the
Catholic University of Leuven, Belgium, about 19 miles

will be about $8 million for 20 acres of land -- with an
option to buy five more acres -- initial construction and

mid-1991 and the first phase is expected to be completed in
early 1993.</p>
