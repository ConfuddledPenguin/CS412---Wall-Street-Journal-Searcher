	<p class="article-leader">Moto Photo Inc., Dayton, Ohio, said that it expects to
report profit for the second quarter, but that the net income
will be lower than the year-earlier $201,018, or one cent a
share.
   The franchiser and owner of one-hour photo processing
stores said earnings from those operations improved in the
current quarter, compared with a year earlier. But it said
the year-ago results included a substantial profit from store
refranchising.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Moto Photo said it expects to report "considerably
improved" first-half results. In the 1989 first half, the
company had a net loss of $1.2 million. The company also said
full-year earnings "will be substantially better." It had a
1989 net loss of $1.9 million, or 44 cents a share.</p>
