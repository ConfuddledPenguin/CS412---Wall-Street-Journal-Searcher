	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- The House cast a solid vote for overriding
President Bush's veto of a bill that would ease restrictions
on political activity by federal workers, but the real test
comes in the Senate today.
   The House voted 327-93 to override the veto, which was Mr.
Bush's 12th since taking office. The Senate, which voted
67-30 for the bill last month, is scheduled to vote today on
overriding the veto, and Democratic proponents of the measure
and Republican opponents both say the outcome will be very
close. As in the House, a veto override requires at least a
two-thirds vote.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The Senate vote would have been 68-32 with all senators
voting, based on later statements by the three senators who
didn't vote. Those favoring the legislation included all 55
Democrats and 13 Republicans, while 32 Republicans opposed
it. So two of the 13 Republicans will have to join their GOP
colleagues in a vote to sustain the veto, assuming no other
switches occur.</p>
<p>The bill vetoed by Mr. Bush was the more-modest Senate
version, accepted by the House last week. It would let
federal employees engage in more off-the-job political
activity, including holding positions in political parties,
attending party conventions as delegates and raising money
from fellow union members. But running for elective office
would still generally be banned. And on-the-job political
activity, such as wearing a campaign button at work, wouldn't
be permitted anymore.</p>
