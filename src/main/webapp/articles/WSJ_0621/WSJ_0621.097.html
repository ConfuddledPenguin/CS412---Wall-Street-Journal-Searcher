	<p class="article-leader">As my Midwestern granny always said: First comes the rain,
then comes the sun. First we had Ravi Batra's "Great
Depression of the 1990's" and now we have Charles R. Morris's
"The Coming Global Boom: How to Benefit Now from Tomorrow's
Dynamic World Economy" (Bantam, 267 pages, $19.95).
   Just as Mr. Batra spread darkness and gloom, so does Mr.
Morris chase away the clouds. With a chirpy optimism that
would make Doris Day cringe, Mr. Morris looks into the future
and finds it better than good, he finds it stupendous. The
1990s, he gushes, will be a decade of unparalleled economic
growth.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Unfortunately, Mr. Morris is a better critic than a seer.
He comes out on the contrarian side of many current issues,
but is maddeningly unconvincing when it comes to predicting
the future.</p>
<p>Looking at the three headaches of the times -- the budget
deficit, the trade deficit and industrial policy -- Mr.
Morris finds the conventional wisdom wrong.</p>
<p>To begin, the twin deficits are not really deficits. In
both cases, says Mr. Morris, the deficits are creatures of
accounting problems. The federal budget deficit failed to
deck the economy during the 1980s because it wasn't much of a
deficit in the first place; indeed, when state and local
surpluses are taken into account, government deficits were
under control. Also, because we owe the debt to ourselves,
the numbers just represent a transfer of wealth from some
citizens to others and therefore is unremarkable.</p>
<p>Ditto for the trade deficit. When assets and liabilities
are properly measured, the U.S. is not the largest net debtor
nation; in fact, the U.S. may have been a creditor nation
throughout most of the 1980s. Moreover, says Mr. Morris, it's
okay for foreign investors to own assets here because it
means that foreigners have a stake in our future and, anyway,
the money they earn mostly stays here.</p>
<p>As for the debate over whether the U.S. should have some
form of industrial policy to direct investment and protect
domestic industry, Mr. Morris is in the don't-be-silly camp.
He points out that industrial policies don't work -- witness
the many European failures and the big boo-boos made by
Japan's Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI).
(For example, Britain subsidized its auto companies to death
and MITI was only lukewarm on a Japanese car industry.)</p>
<p>So far, so good. But then comes the embarrassing part in
which Mr. Morris describes the forces that will create a
global boom. Consider:</p>
<p>First, there will be a trend toward less government
borrowing that will result in lower interest rates. (Just why
governments suddenly will stop spending more than they have,
he doesn't say.)</p>
<p>All things are possible, of course, but Mr. Morris goes on
to predict that the 1990s will bring a shortage of government
bonds. The folks at Resolution Trust Corp. will be pleased to
hear that the tremendous number of bonds they must float over
the next decade to fund the thrift bailout will find an eager
market suffering under conditions of scarcity. They might
also be puzzled, quite understandably, since Mr. Morris
doesn't say how this and escalating off-budget borrowing
activities fit into his scenario.</p>
<p>Second, there will be a bust in the real estate market
that will free up capital for industrial investment. This
force is a consequence of the disappearance of the causes of
the real estate boom in the 1970s. Those causes, according to
Mr. Morris, were baby boomers looking for shelter and old
folks holding on to their homes.</p>
<p>Okay, but the explosion of demand for real estate also was
due to wicked inflation, which made hard assets a smart thing
to hold, and tax laws that promote investment in residential
housing. Tax laws certainly are crucial in discussing and
forecasting the real estate market, but Mr. Morris doesn't
mention them.</p>
<p>Third, there will be an organizational and technological
transformation of global industries that will mean increases
in manufacturing productivity and a rise in global output.
Sure, but using a bunch of business baloney that will make
Tom Peters drool with envy, Mr. Morris does more rhapsodizing
about corporate cleverness than explaining the coming change.</p>
<p>He argues that the notion of comparative advantage is
old-fashioned; in the new world of global industries,
comparative advantage will belong to companies, not
countries. Maybe, but even global industries might want to
locate in countries with good human capital, a sophisticated
infrastructure, an accommodating body of laws and, of course,
reasonable tax laws. But, again, in his rush to spread the
sunshine, Mr. Morris ignores these critical factors.</p>
<p>After making these and other peculiar leaps of faith and
hopeful claims, Mr. Morris offers some disappointingly flat
investment advice. If he really believes interest rates and
inflation are coming down, then locking in a lot of long-term
Treasuries would be the way to go. But, no. Mr. Morris
classifies those as speculative and recommends, instead, that
investors diversify their portfolio of stocks and invest for
the long term. Money magazine couldn't have done better.</p>
<p>It's not that Mr. Morris should have written a different
book; this one would have been just fine if he hadn't made so
many weird omissions or substituted singsong cheerfulness for
argument. It's enough to make one yearn for a thundershower.</p>

<p>Ms. Lee is writing a book on the origins of economic
crisis.</p>
