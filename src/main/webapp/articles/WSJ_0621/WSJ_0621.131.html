	<p class="article-leader">OAKLAND, Calif. -- Clorox Co. is hoping to mop up on the
mix of bleach, disinfectant and insecticides.
   The Oakland-based concern said it will acquire the
household-products business of American Cyanamid Co. for $465
million. The purchase includes Cyanamid's well-known Pine Sol
cleaner and Combat insecticide labels.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Clorox called the move a natural one that will allow it to
boost its already formidable presence in the $900 million
all-purpose cleanser market while providing it with a quick
foothold in the household insecticide business.</p>
<p>The stock market seemed to agree. In composite trading on
the New York Stock Exchange yesterday, Clorox common closed
at $43.875, up 37.5 cents.</p>
<p>American Cyanamid of Wayne, N.J., makes medical,
agricultural and chemical products.</p>
<p>Clorox has been considering entering the insecticide
market for a number of years but had been stymied by the
slow, costly and risky effort required to bring a new
insecticide to the sales counter. Combat, according to
Clorox, is currently the No. 2 brand in the $450 million a
year household insecticide market.</p>
<p>Clorox said it expects the Cyanamid brands to boost
revenue about $235 million annually while adding
significantly to its international sales. It plans to pay for
the acquisition with about $400 million in short-term
borrowings, with the balance in cash.</p>
<p>The company said debt and other costs associated with the
purchase is expected to dilute earnings by 30 cents to 40
cents a share during the first year, and ten cents a share
during the second year. By the second year, however, the
deal, after payment of financing costs, is "expected to
generate positive cash flow," the company said. For the
fiscal nine months, ended March 31, Clorox had profit of
$111.3 million, or $2.02 a share.</p>
<p>The company's existing household products brands include
Clorox liquid bleach, Formula 409 spray cleaner and
Liquid-plumr drain opener. Clorox said it expects to make
significant cost savings by combining manufacturing and
marketing of its current labels with its newly acquired
Cyanamid brands. The purchase includes a Pine Sol and Combat
manufacturing plant in Mississippi that has 200 employees.</p>
