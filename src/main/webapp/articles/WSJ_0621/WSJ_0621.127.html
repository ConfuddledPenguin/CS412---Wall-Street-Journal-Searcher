	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- The Resolution Trust Corp. said it's
accepting bids for 14 of its biggest insolvent savings and
loan associations, with total assets of $39.8 billion.
   The thrifts range from City Savings Bank of Bedminster,
N.J., with assets of $8.5 billion, to Yorkridge-Calvert
Federal Savings Bank, Baltimore, with $540 million in assets.
Both S&Ls were hurt by declining values of real estate in the
Northeast, the S&L cleanup agency said.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Selling the large thrifts is complicated and expensive for
the government. Most sales so far have left the thrifts' bad
investments in the hands of the RTC, so the buyers get huge
cash infusions to compensate for those assets.</p>
<p>Other institutions up for bid in the latest round are:
Empire of America, Buffalo, N.Y., with $8.17 billion in
assets; Merabank, Phoenix, Ariz., $6.38 billion; Benjamin
Franklin Federal Savings & Loan Association, Portland, Ore.,
$4.97 billion; Homeowners Savings Bank, Boston, $3.62
billion; Mercury Savings & Loan Association, Huntington
Beach, Calif., $2.16 billion; Sooner Federal Savings
Association, Tulsa, Okla., $1.43 billion; Great American
Federal Savings & Loan Association, Oak Park, Ill., $1.01
billion.</p>
<p>Also, City Federal Savings & Loan Association, Birmingham,
Ala., $493 million; Arlington Heights Savings Association of
Illinois, $510 million; North Carolina Federal Savings & Loan
Association, Charlotte, N.C., $628 million; Midwest Federal
Savings Bank of Minot, N.D., $960 million; Capitol City
Federal Savings Association, Austin, Texas, $409 million.</p>
