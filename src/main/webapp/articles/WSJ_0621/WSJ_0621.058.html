	<p class="article-leader">PROVIDENCE, R.I. -- Even by Rhode Island standards, the
political career of Vincent A. "Buddy" Cianci Jr. has been
entertaining.
   He was elected mayor of this blue-collar city as a
Republican and at the tender age of 33. Facing a 1982 primary
challenge in the GOP, he ran for his third term as an
independent and was re-elected. In his nine years as mayor,
he saw a goodly number of officials and other city workers
hustled off to prison, having been convicted on criminal
charges of corruption.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>And on the night of March 20, 1983, Mayor Cianci beat up
the lover of his estranged wife, pummeling the fellow and
poking him in the face with a lighted cigarette, as several
cronies -- including the policeman who was the mayor's
chauffeur -- looked on.</p>
<p>Mr. Cianci pleaded no contest to two assault charges and
resigned his office in disgrace. His sentence was suspended,
and he was put on probation.</p>
<p>But in a comeback that would be the envy of Richard Nixon,
Buddy Cianci (pronounced see-ANN-see) is currently the toast
of Providence, the host of the highest-rated afternoon
rush-hour radio talk show, a political commentator on TV, a
sought-after after-dinner speaker -- and possibly the next
mayor of Providence.</p>
<p>As the June 27 filing deadline approaches, the question in
Providence is: Will Buddy run?</p>
<p>Visiting the opening of a Jaguar dealership on a hot
summer night, he is surrounded by admirers. (As Andy Warhol
once said, and Mr. Cianci does too, he'll go to the opening
of an envelope.) "Are you coming back?" asks a cop on
horseback in the mounted patrol Mr. Cianci created when he
was mayor.</p>
<p>The effervescent Mr. Cianci, who now is 49, pudgy and
wearing a toupee, seems to know everyone. Men grab his
shoulder, women kiss his cheek and whisper in his ear. "When
are you going to announce? . . . You can do it, you can do
it. . . . I love your show. You gave them hell today. . . .
I'm going to be disappointed if you don't run. . . . What are
you gonna do?"</p>
<p>He smiles. He shrugs. He doesn't answer. Buddy Cianci's
lips are sealed -- perhaps for the first time ever.</p>
<p>Even President Bush recently asked reporters about Mr.
Cianci's political future.</p>
<p>If he runs, local pols say, he can win. Polls show Mr.
Cianci ahead -- whether he runs as an independent, a
Republican or, why not, a Democrat. "Between the Democratic
and Republican parties in Rhode Island, there isn't a hell of
a lot of difference. . . . The only philosophy they have is
to win," notes Mr. Cianci, who is called "Spanky" by some
city workers. His chances are good despite the fact 44% of
Providence voters think his election would be an
embarrassment to the city and even though about a fourth of
them believe he was a corrupt mayor. He denies that.</p>
<p>His chances are good because the incumbent isn't running
for re-election, because the election is likely to be a
three-way affair that Mr. Cianci could win with a minority of
the vote, and because his admirers, particularly ethnics and
blue-collar workers, are crazy about him. Maybe 25% of the
electorate is smitten. Nobody else has "the star quality
Buddy Cianci does," says Michael Vallante, a Republican
political consultant.</p>
<p>When Mr. Cianci's "personal domestic matter," as he calls
it, comes up, some Providence voters are more than forgiving
-- they positively empathize. "I think I would have done the
same thing if somebody went after my wife," says Anthony
Drury Jr., a sidewalk vendor. A store clerk on Federal Hill,
the city's Italian neighborhood, goes further: "Maybe if it
was me in his shoes, I would have killed the bastard."</p>
<p>Rhode Island is tolerant of its public servants. In 1985,
the town council in suburban Johnston voted to allow a member
who had been convicted of odometer tampering to take part in
meetings via telephone from federal prison. (Penitentiary
officials scotched the idea.) Everyone snickered, but the
general reaction, says Mr. Vallante, the consultant, was,
"Hey, that's Rhode Island, it's no big deal."</p>
<p>Rhode Islanders are similarly amused by the tale of the
convicted murderer turned state's witness who had a heart
attack and died in 1988 (with cocaine in his possession)
while on his way to go sky diving. He was, all the while,
supposedly under the watchful eye of the Providence police.</p>
<p>Rhode Islanders are so laid back about these things -- and
Mr. Cianci so popular with his claque -- that less than a
year after his ignominious departure from public office in
1984, he was on the air with "The Buddy Cianci Show." An
instant hit, too. Aired from 3 to 6 on weekday afternoons on
WHJJ-AM in East Providence, the soapbox is a politician's
dream. And it is the quintessence of Buddy Cianci:
boisterous, opinionated, egotistical. He ventures opinions on
public issues (from coal-fired power plants to school prayer
and off-track betting). He puts down guests. When a phone
caller challenged him on a recent show, Mr. Cianci
interrupted: "Wait a minute. I'll decide what's important on
my show because I've got the microphone."</p>
<p>Part of the listening pleasure involves trying to figure
out why he's skewering whom he's skewering. Close listeners
say his favorite targets are people who have crossed him.
Says a politician's aide: It's the opposite of you scratch my
back, I'll scratch yours.</p>
<p>And he does get to Rhode Islanders. According to Arbitron
ratings, he has 100,000 listeners a week, in a state of just
980,000 residents.</p>
<p>"How can they give air time to a violent felon to use to
gain retribution {against} his enemies?" wonders Dan Hackett,
editor of Rhode Island Lawyers Weekly and former aide to the
state attorney general who prosecuted Mr. Cianci on the
assault charges.</p>
<p>Mr. Cianci, a lawyer too, disputes that: "I have certain
opinions I don't hold back on. But settle scores? No."</p>
<p>One of Mr. Cianci's targets has been Bruce Sundlun, the
Democratic candidate for governor in 1988, who appeared on
his show a few days before the election. Mr. Sundlun made the
mistake of boasting that as president of the local chamber of
commerce he had had something to do with redeveloping
downtown Providence. That made Mr. Cianci mad. So he
lambasted Mr. Sundlun on the air. "He claimed credit for
everything that happened in the city of Providence since
1636," the year the city was founded, complains Mr. Cianci.</p>
<p>Mr. Sundlun lost the election by just 6,614 votes, or
1.6%. "He sandbagged me," complains Mr. Sundlun, who is
running again this year.</p>
<p>(When the two men run into each other at the Jaguar
dealership, Mr. Cianci said, "Bruce, I think you're going to
win this time." Replies Mr. Sundlun: "Only if you get
laryngitis.")</p>
<p>Lately, Mr. Cianci has been attacking Republican
congressional candidate Trudy Coxe. He doesn't approve of her
crossover voting in Democratic primaries, and he is angry
that she refused until recently to appear on his show. "Those
are my beefs, it's not personal," he says. (Her real sin,
some political insiders say, is that she headed an
environmental group that accused the city of polluting
Narragansett Bay while you-know-who was mayor.)</p>
<p>Mr. Cianci, the son of a proctologist, will have to give
up show business, his broadcasting at any rate, if he runs
for mayor. The decision won't be easy, he says. Life as a
media celebrity is fun -- and lucrative. The radio station is
trying to hold onto him by offering him more money -- some
say half a million dollars over three years. "I get paid now
to do what I did for free," he says.</p>
<p>He does love the limelight, and his association with
famous and powerful people. The study of his
multimillion-dollar carriage house at the corner of Power and
Benefit streets, near downtown, displays pictures of Buddy
with George Burns, Buddy with Frank Sinatra, Buddy with
President Ford, Buddy with Vice President Bush, Buddy with
Muhammad Ali.</p>
<p>He confesses: "I miss the hustle and bustle."</p>
<p>He says the run-in with his former friend, the lover of
his ex-wife, should not be an issue: "I left {office} under
circumstances I'm not proud of. But I paid my price. To err
is human, to forgive divine."</p>
<p>If he runs, Mr. Cianci will emphasize his record (not his
criminal record) of revitalizing the city's neighborhoods and
its dying downtown. And, he says without irony, he will make
an issue of its worsening crime rate.</p>
