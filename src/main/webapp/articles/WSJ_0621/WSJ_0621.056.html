	<p class="article-leader">From whatever Valhalla dead statesmen look down at the
contemporary world, one of them, at least, must be
contemplating recent developments with particular
satisfaction. That would be Franklin D. Roosevelt.
   Over the 45 years since his death, critics have held FDR
personally responsible for the growth of Soviet power, the
spread of communism and the rise of the Cold War. Roosevelt's
fatal wartime error, critics said, was to subordinate
political to military objectives, neglecting the shape of the
world to come in the interest of beating Hitler. Roosevelt's
naivete, critics claimed, handed Eastern Europe over to the
Soviet Union and encouraged Stalin to undertake his quest for
world domination.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Now, FDR was many things. He was not, however, renowned
for naivete. He was in fact the most political of
politicians, political in every reflex and to his fingertips
-- and just as political in war as he had been in peace. As a
virtuoso politician, he understood perfectly that there could
be no better cloak for the pursuit of political objectives in
wartime than the claim of total absorption in winning the
war. He had plenty of political objectives all the same. The
perspective of half a century allows us to see them with
greater clarity.</p>
<p>Was Yalta, after all, the root of all postwar evil? Such
charges come mostly from people who seem never to have read
the agreements made at Yalta.</p>
<p>Recall the Declaration on Liberated Europe. In this
document Roosevelt, Churchill and Stalin pledged that "the
liberated peoples" of Eastern Europe would be enabled "to
choose the form of government under which they will live,"
"to create democratic institutions of their own choice" and
to establish "through free elections . . . governments
responsive to the will of the people." The Declaration on
Poland pledged "a strong, free, independent and democratic
Poland" with "free and unfettered elections . . . on the
basis of universal suffrage and secret ballot."</p>
<p>Far from handing over Eastern Europe to the Russians, the
Yalta accords called for precisely the democratic Eastern
Europe that is finally coming into existence today. To
achieve his expansionist goals Stalin had to violate his
Yalta pledges. With the Red Army in control in Eastern
Europe, there was little enough the West could do about it.</p>
<p>The two declarations could not be enforced by diplomatic
methods alone, and in 1945 the U.S. and Britain, with weary
armies in Europe and a war still to be won in the Pacific,
could not conceivably have gone to war against the Soviet
Union over Eastern Europe. Still Roosevelt's declarations
laid down a set of standards for Eastern Europe by which the
world subsequently measured Soviet behavior and found it
wanting.</p>
<p>Molotov sensed the danger at the time and objected that
the declarations "amounted to interference in the affairs of
liberated Europe." But Stalin signed the declarations
nevertheless, partly because a unanimity rule nullified them
as a check to his immediate plans, partly because he probably
supposed that free elections would result in communist
victories, partly because he did not want to risk an open
break with Roosevelt.</p>
<p>In the short run, Stalin gained. But statesmanship is
tested by the long run. Now, 45 years later, the Soviet Union
is at last honoring the Yalta agreements. The Eastern Europe
of Vaclav Havel and Lech Walesa represents not the
repudiation, but the fulfillment, of Roosevelt's purposes at
Yalta.</p>
<p>Roosevelt was much criticized too for naivete in
supposedly thinking that he could charm Stalin into amiable
postwar collaboration. Perhaps FDR was not so naive after
all. Stalin was not the helpless prisoner of Marxist-Leninist
ideology. The Soviet dictator, not a man given to undue
modesty, saw himself less as the disciple of Marx and Lenin
than as their fellow prophet.</p>
<p>Roosevelt therefore had a point in concentrating on Stalin
as the only lever capable of changing the Soviet course. Only
Stalin had the power to rewrite the Soviet approach to world
affairs, as he had already rewritten Soviet domestic ideology
and Soviet history. It was the best chance the West had to
alter the Soviet doctrine of irrevocable hostility between
capitalism and communism.</p>
<p>FDR's determination to work on and through Stalin was, it
seems in retrospect, founded on shrewd insight. As Walter
Lippmann once observed, Roosevelt was too cynical to think he
could charm Stalin. "He distrusted everybody. What he thought
he could do was outwit Stalin, which is quite a different
thing."</p>
<p>In the longer run, Roosevelt anticipated a narrowing of
differences, a measure of convergence, between democratic and
communist societies. He told Sumner Welles, his
undersecretary of state, that, marking American democracy as
100 and Soviet communism as zero, the American system, as it
moved away from laissez-faire, might eventually reach 60 and
the Soviet system, as it moved toward democracy, might
eventually reach 40. The illustration was typically slapdash,
but the anticipation looks a good deal less naive in 1990
than it did, say, in 1950.</p>
<p>Roosevelt, here and elsewhere, had a powerful instinct for
the deep-flowing currents of history. He had no doubt, for
example, that Western colonialism was finished in Asia and
Africa. What seems obvious in the aftermath was not so
obvious at the time. The biggest quarrel between Roosevelt
and Churchill was over the future of India. But, despite
Churchill, the British Empire went the way Roosevelt
expected, and rather quickly too.</p>
<p>FDR hoped, but failed, to prevent the French from
returning to Indochina. Had he succeeded, America would have
been spared much agony, and many brave Americans who died in
Vietnam would be alive today.</p>
<p>FDR believed too that China would in due course become a
great power, which is why he wanted to install China as one
of the Four Policemen charged with supervising the peace. For
this thought Roosevelt suffered much ridicule from Churchill
at the time and from critics since. But was Roosevelt's
instinct about China really so naive?</p>
<p>When Churchill at Tehran objected to the buildup of China,
FDR responded that he wanted China as one of the Big Four,
"not," as the minutes put it, "because he did not realize the
weakness of China at present, but he was thinking farther
into the future. . . . After all China was a nation of 400
million people, and it was better to have them as friends
rather than as a potential source of trouble." At Yalta he
told Churchill that it would take "three generations of
education and training . . . before China could become a
serious factor."</p>
<p>Two of those three generations have now passed, and China
has grown from 400 million to a billion people. No one can
doubt that China is "a serious factor" today. FDR's
assessment perhaps seems a little less naive than Churchill's
derisive dismissal of those he called the "pigtails" and his
ironical description of China as the "Great American
Illusion."</p>
<p>Roosevelt had an assured vision of the world he wanted
after the war. It was the vision stated in the speech he gave
50 years ago next January setting forth the Four Freedoms --
freedom of speech and expression, freedom of worship, freedom
from want, freedom from fear; the vision soon elaborated in
the Atlantic Charter -- a world of democratic nations, based
on human rights, economic growth, social reform, united in a
"permanent system of general security" and in a freely
trading international economy; in short, more or less the
kind of world we are moving toward today.</p>
<p>There was still great concern in the war years about a
postwar relapse into isolationism. So Roosevelt moved quietly
and methodically during the war to prepare the American
people for a paramount international role.</p>
<p>By the end of 1944, with the war still on, a series of
international conferences, held mostly at American initiative
and dominated mostly by American agendas, had begun to shape
the postwar world: Bretton Woods (creating the World Bank and
the International Monetary Fund and providing for the
stabilization of international exchanges); Dumbarton Oaks
(drawing up plans for the United Nations); Hot Springs (food
and agriculture); Washington (relief and rehabilitation);
Chicago (civil aviation). At his death in April 1945
Roosevelt left an encompassing framework for the world after
the war -- quite an achievement for a leader who allegedly
subordinated political to military goals.</p>
<p>Of all the statesmen of the first half of the century,
Roosevelt would be the least surprised by the shape of the
world in 1990. For all his insouciance, improvisation and
persiflage, he saw more deeply than his contemporaries into
the great emergent movements of modern history. Let us give
him a little credit.</p>
