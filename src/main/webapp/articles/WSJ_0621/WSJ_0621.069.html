	<p class="article-leader">TAIPEI -- Chinese pop star Hou Dejian, a Taiwan native who
defected to China seven years ago only to become the
mainland's most outspoken dissident last summer, has fled
back to the island on a fishing boat, Taiwan's state-owned
radio and television reported.
   Mr. Hou's whereabouts and details of his escape weren't
immediately clear. Taiwanese television stations reported
that he had turned himself in to the Taipei prosecutor's
office last night after visiting his mother. They said he had
been arrested and was being detained for entering Taiwan
without a visa, but police denied that report.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Whatever his immediate circumstances, Mr. Hou's return
could pose a dilemma for local officials torn between
welcoming him home or prosecuting him as a traitor because of
his 1983 defection. He could also be charged with violating
national security laws for entering Taiwan without a visa.</p>
<p>But Mr. Hou, 33 years old, is viewed as a hero in Taiwan
because of his role in helping some students escape last
year's massacre of pro-democracy demonstrators in Beijing. On
the night of June 4, he negotiated the students' peaceful
retreat from Tiananmen Square with military officers. That
exploit, and his subsequent emergence as China's leading
dissenter, was described in a page one story in this
newspaper last month.</p>
<p>Because of his intervention on behalf of the students,
political analysts here said it is unlikely he will be
prosecuted -- if he goes to court at all. Government
spokesman Shaw Yu-ming said only that his fate is uncertain.
"What he did on June 4 was courageous," Mr. Shaw said. "But
if there are legal entanglements, that will have to be
decided by judicial authorities."</p>
<p>People close to Mr. Hou said he left Taiwan because his
marriage was breaking up and because he was angry that Taipei
censors had changed the lyrics in one of his songs. His
defection was a major embarrassment for the ruling
Kuomintang, which had embraced his most famous song,
"Descendants of the Dragon," as a patriotic inspiration, and
then felt obliged to ban it for several years.</p>
<p>In the aftermath of the massacre in Beijing, Mr. Hou's
fame as a pop star and his unique status as a defector from
Taiwan kept him out of jail as other dissidents were being
rounded up. He thus became the most visible person in China
willing to publicly criticize the government. In interviews
with foreign reporters, he referred to China's leaders as
"mad dogs" and called paramount leader Deng Xiaoping a
"killer."</p>
<p>Mr. Hou and two other dissidents disappeared May 30, on
the eve of a news conference scheduled to demand the release
of political prisoners. The other two -- Gao Xin, a former
university newspaper editor, and Zhou Duo, a former
university lecturer -- had served time in prison after the
June military crackdown. Both men resurfaced this week and
returned home -- Mr. Zhou on Monday and Mr. Gao yesterday.</p>
