	<p class="article-leader">MORE AUTOMATION is needed, manufacturers say.
   Middle market manufacturers "are still in love with
technology as a solution to becoming more competitive in the
global marketplace," says Michael Cantwell of accountant
Grant Thornton. In a recent survey, some 67% of officials of
mid-size companies said use of advanced technologies by U.S.
industries is too low. The technologies most widely in use:
just-in-time inventory techniques and computer-aided design.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Continuing efforts to automate are keeping capital
spending growing despite the current economic slowdown, says
Gordon Richards, economist for the National Association of
Manufacturers. But the best use of automation may be "minor
low-cost modifications" of existing equipment, says Roy
Harmon, an independent consultant with Arthur Anderson & Co.</p>
<p>When asked about their own companies, 40% said they were
automated enough. "We call this the `Not My Factory'
syndrome," Mr. Cantwell says.</p>
<p>POOL BUILDERS say fewer people are taking the plunge.</p>
<p>Sales at East Bay Gunite Inc., Livermore, Calif., stalled
in June, usually the company's biggest month. "People are
just a little less willing to plop down the money," says
George Aylwin, vice president, estimating that sales are off
15% from last year. "People are spooked. They aren't spending
their money," agrees Thomas Rogers, owner of Classic Pools
Inc., Roswell, Ga. Sales there are down 20%.</p>
<p>Even those that claim healthy sales admit business is down
from the mid-80s boom. "Five years ago we couldn't find the
time to do all the work," says Ed Kaminski of Aqua-Qual
Swimming Pool Co., Farmingdale, N.Y. In California, the
drought is making pool sales even tougher. "Psychologically,
people just aren't comfortable with the idea of new pools
when the state is suffering from water shortages," says
Stephen Zall of Aqua Blue Pools, San Jose. One bright spot:
Last October's earthquake damaged some pools so badly that
they're cheaper to replace than repair, he says.</p>
<p>A GREENER GNP finds growing support among economists.</p>
<p>Current measures of national income "take into account
changes in our net worth with respect to buildings and
equipment," but not our natural resources, says Robert
Repetto of the World Resources Institute, Washington. A
handful of countries, including Norway, France and West
Germany, are actively working on such environmental
accounting. Within five years, he says, there could be "a
methodological and empirical base on which to revise the
definition of national income."</p>
<p>Such changes are especially important for developing
countries "because they are so heavily resource-based," says
Henry Peskin of Edgevale Associates, Silver Spring, Md. With
funding from the Environmental Protection Agency, he is
developing a set of accounts on Chesapeake Bay. Greg Michaels
of the EPA views creation of a "green" GNP as unlikely, but
says linkages between the economy and the environment are
clearly being established.</p>
<p>The National Accounts Experts will devote a third of its
annual meeting next month to incorporating environmental
quality into national accounts.</p>
<p>LATE MORTGAGE PAYMENTS were at their lowest level in a
decade during the first quarter, says the Mortgage Bankers
Association of America. That's good news for the economy,
says MBA's Warren Lasko, predicting lower foreclosure rates
will follow.</p>
<p>STAYING DRY is one answer to water pollution worries,
finds a Coors Pure Water survey. Some 56% of those surveyed
say they have cut back water recreation activities at
beaches, lakes and rivers. In the Northeast, that number hit
71%.</p>
<p>PHYSICIANS WHO REFER to specialists often end up losing
patients. The Medical Tribune found some 37% of family and
general practitioners lost patients because of referrals in
the last year, with the average loss eight patients per
doctor.</p>
<p>KIDS' ELECTRONICS move beyond the toy tape recorder.</p>
<p>With their eye on demographics, some major consumer
electronics companies are taking aim at the toddler and
pre-adolescent set. "This market offers tremendous
opportunity," says Buddy Paris of KIDdesigns Inc., a firm
formed by Soundesign Corp. to create products under the
Playskool name. Sony Corp. of America, which helped pioneer
the kidtronics market with its My First Sony line, is seeing
sales jump 20% a year. It's latest entry: an electronic
sketchboard that can be hooked up to the TV screen.</p>
<p>Introduced first in Japan, Sanyo Fisher Corp.'s Robo line
is designed with brightly colored, interchangeable panels
that can be removed with a screwdriver, which is included.
"We want children to master motor and cognitive skills," says
Stewart Cyment, national product manager. Products include a
talking alarm clock, a programmable telephone and sing-along
machine with applause button.</p>
<p>Targeting kids is one way to build brand loyalty early,
says Sony's Marnix Van Gemert, who expects further line
expansion.</p>
<p>BRIEFS: Petite clothing sales more than doubled from 1983
to 1989, while the overall women's apparel market grew only
35%, says MRCA Information Services. . . . Car phones are the
fastest growing executive perk in the U.S., says the National
Institute of Business Management.</p>
