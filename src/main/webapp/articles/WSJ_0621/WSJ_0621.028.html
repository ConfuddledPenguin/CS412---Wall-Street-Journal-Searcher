	<p class="article-leader">In regard to Lee Yee's June 4 editorial-page story ". . .
But Meantime, Hong Kong Braces for a Fall": Mr. Lee realized
there is an analogy to today's situation in Hong Kong, but it
is a far darker analogy than a ship heading toward a volcanic
isle. With adult children abandoning their elderly parents,
lovers deserting each other in search of a partner with
travel papers, a community rampant with desperate greed in
order to buy oneself a way out, what the current frenzy in
Hong Kong most closely resembles is the terror of the Jews in
the Warsaw Ghetto.
   During World War II the Jews of the ghetto faced with
resettlement in the East found themselves hopelessly trapped
by an uncaring world. For the Chinese of Hong Kong, it looks
as if "never again" has come again too soon.</p>
