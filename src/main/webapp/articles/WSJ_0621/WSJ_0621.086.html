	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- The House Judiciary Committee narrowly
passed legislation that would repeal major portions of the
insurance industry's exemption from federal antitrust law.
   The committee's action, by a 19-17 vote, poses the biggest
threat the insurance industry has ever faced to the antitrust
exemption, passed by Congress as the McCarran-Ferguson Act in
1945.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"Congress can no longer ignore the widespread economic
dislocation caused by premiums that are unreasonably high --
or policies that are unavailable at any price," said Rep.
Jack Brooks, a Texas Democrat and Judiciary Committee
chairman, who sponsored the new legislation.</p>
<p>Approval of the bill set the stage for a battle in the
full House, possibly in late summer. But if the measure
passes the House, over strong opposition, a Senate proposal
also faces a tough fight. Consumer groups that support the
legislation concede that the best they may be able to hope
for is passage by the House this year, and a quick start in
the new Congress next year.</p>
<p>The bill passed the committee despite opposition by all 14
of the Republicans on the 36-member panel. The measure was
supported by 19 Democrats, and was opposed by three
Democrats.</p>
<p>The legislation would repeal insurers' exemptions for the
practices that are generally deemed by antitrust experts to
be most anti-competitive. These include price-fixing,
allocating geographic regions among competing companies,
attempting to monopolize markets, and requiring consumers to
buy insurance packages that include policies they don't
really want.</p>
<p>The proposal would allow insurance companies to continue
sharing some basic information about claims and economic
trends, while phasing out the sharing of some other types of
information. And the exemption from federal enforcement would
remain intact in states that actively regulate the insurance
industry.</p>
<p>A broad coalition of some 30 consumer and professional
groups, including the American Bar Association, supports some
type of legislation to amend the McCarran-Ferguson law. "I
can't imagine losing on the {House} floor during an election
year," said Robert Hunter, head of the National Insurance
Consumers Organization in Arlington, Va. "We're going to
frame this debate as `Who is for or against insurance
price-fixing.'"</p>
<p>Earl Pomeroy, North Dakota insurance commissioner and
president of the National Association of Insurance
Commissioners, calls the bill "bad public policy." He said
supporters of the legislation haven't demonstrated how "it
will lower prices and improve service -- the two things
consumers most want."</p>
<p>Mr. Pomeroy also said that, although the measure would
allow for federal enforcement in insurance by enabling the
Federal Trade Commission to investigate allegations, passage
of the bill "doesn't mean we'll have federal regulation
tomorrow."</p>
<p>Some large insurers, such as Allstate Insurance Co., a
unit of Sears, Roebuck & Co., and State Farm Mutual Insurance
Co., would be willing to live without the federal antitrust
exemption if states abolished laws that regulate rates, which
they said just adds another layer of regulation to what
already exists. "Give us what other competitive industries
have -- complete pricing freedom," said Robert Pike,
Allstate's general counsel.</p>
