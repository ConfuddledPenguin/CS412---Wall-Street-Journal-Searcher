	<p class="article-leader">N.V. Philips announced the first stage of a plan to
retrench its computer operations and said it hopes to end
losses in the division by the end of 1991.
   Retreating from its efforts to be a technology leader in
minicomputers, the Dutch electronics company said it plans to
eliminate 210 jobs at its data systems product group in
Apeldoorn, the Netherlands. The product group, which makes
minicomputers and related products and employs 2,100 people
world-wide, will "drastically" reduce efforts to develop
systems using its own hardware technology, Philips said.
Instead, the unit is to focus on putting together computer
systems based on industry standards and on tailoring systems
for specific industry applications. Philips's minicomputer
business specializes in systems for banks, insurers and
government agencies.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The moves announced yesterday don't affect the company's
personal computer product group, whose main plant is in
Montreal, but a spokesman said further moves to restructure
the computer division would be announced later. Philips said
the restructuring is aimed at "drastically reducing costs"
and making "strategic choices" about which products it will
offer.</p>
<p>Some analysts estimate that losses at Philips's computer
division totaled 150 million guilders ($80 million) in the
first quarter of 1990. A Philips spokesman yesterday would
say only that the losses are running at an annual rate in the
"hundreds of millions of guilders." The company, whose
overall net profit totaled 1.37 billion guilders in 1989,
warned last week that its 1990 results would be "very low,"
reflecting losses in the computer and semiconductor divisions
and high restructuring costs.</p>
<p>Analysts called yesterday's announcement a step in the
right direction. "It's very encouraging that they are taking
the knife {to the computer division} in this fashion," said
Laurence Heyworth, an analyst at London merchant bank Robert
Fleming & Co.</p>
<p>Arjen Los of County NatWest Securities Ltd. in London said
the moves are a sign that Philips is putting more emphasis on
offering customers what they want rather than trying to
impose its own technology on the market. "If you can't be a
leader, you have to look for the niches and be market-driven"
rather than technology-driven, Mr. Los said.</p>
<p>But he said investors are still waiting to hear Philips's
overall strategy for the computer division. Philips's new
chairman, Jan Timmer, is expected to address that question at
a shareholders meeting in Eindhoven, the Netherlands, July 2.
Mr. Timmer, whose rapid clean-up of the consumer electronics
division in the late 1980s earned him the nickname "Hurricane
Gilbert," is taking over from Cornelis van der Klugt, who was
forced to resign last month after the company said
first-quarter results tumbled unexpectedly.</p>
<p>Mr. Los speculated that Philips might try to repair its
computer division enough to make it an attractive candidate
for a sale or a merger with a stronger rival. Only last week,
Philips and Ing. C. Olivetti & Co. of Italy announced that
they had ended talks on possible cooperation in the computer
business. Some industry executives said the talks failed
partly because Olivetti decided that fixing Philips's
computer division would be too costly.</p>
<p>Many analysts have long argued that Philips is too small
in computers to survive on its own. Dataquest Europe, a
consulting firm, ranked Philips as the 12th largest personal
computer company in Europe last year, with a market share of
2.2%. IDC Nederland estimates the computer division's sales,
including software and peripheral equipment, at $1.7 billion
a year. The division employs about 15,500 people, out of a
company total of nearly 300,000.</p>
