	<p class="article-leader">PHILADELPHIA -- U S West Inc. and Bell Atlantic Corp. said
they agreed to form a joint venture with the Czechoslovakian
government to build a public data network in that country.
   The three parties together would invest about $45 million
over 10 years to develop the country's first public switched
packet data network, a U S West spokesman said.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The agreement would give the regional Bells a 49% stake in
the joint venture and the Czech Ministry of Posts and
Telecommunications a 51% ownership.</p>
<p>Construction is expected to begin in the next few months
after the agreement is signed, and data network service
initially connecting Prague, Bratislava and Brno is due to
start in 1992. Czechoslovakia has a population of about 15.5
million people and about 2.2 million telephone lines.</p>
<p>Construction costs would be paid in hard currency, while
wages would be covered with the local currency, U S West
said.</p>
<p>The agreement is the second in a week for the two regional
Bells, which were selected by the Czech government Friday to
build and operate a cellular telephone network in that
country.</p>
<p>A switched packet data network allows large amounts of
information to be sent "more efficiently" than a steady data
stream, U S West said.</p>
<p>"Data transmission over a high-quality network is
important to the economy and development of a country," U S
West said.</p>
