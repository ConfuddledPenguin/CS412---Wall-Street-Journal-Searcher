	<p class="article-leader">Triton Energy Corp, Dallas, said its 59%-owned subsidiary,
Triton Europe PLC, has signed a conditional agreement to sell
its interests in the Alba oil field to Conoco U.K. Ltd. for
$61 million. The sale is subject to the consent of the U.K.'s
secretary of state for energy.
   Proceeds of the sale are to be used to retire $45 million
in long-term debt held by Triton Europe, the company said.
Assets to be sold consist of non-producing interests in 12
blocks in the North Sea, including the Alba oilfield.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The sale comes against a backdrop of renewed interest in
the company by New Zealand financier Sir Ronald Brierly. Last
week Industrial Equity (Pacific) Ltd., which is controlled by
Sir Ronald, bought 357,249 Triton common shares and raised
its stake to 11% from 9.3%.</p>
<p>Industrial Equity has informed the Securities and Exchange
Commission that it may seek control of Triton, and has
antitrust clearance to acquire up to 14.9% of the company.</p>
<p>Triton said it has not had any contact with Industrial
Equity, but noted that Sir Ronald has been a long-term
investor in Triton.</p>
