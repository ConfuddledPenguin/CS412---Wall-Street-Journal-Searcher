	<p class="article-leader">Pathe Communications Corp., amid a flurry of reports that
its $1.2 billion bid for MGM/UA Communications Co. is on the
brink of collapse, said it remains confident it will complete
the acquisition of the movie studio.
   However, yesterday, Pathe's negotiations with its chief
financial backer in the bid, Time Warner Inc., appeared to be
deadlocked. So far, Time Warner has refused to alter the
terms under which it agreed to finance about half of Pathe's
$20-a-share offer.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Edmund Hamburger, general counsel to Pathe, said Pathe has
asked MGM/UA to extend the original deadline of June 23 and
the request is "under discussion."</p>
<p>Officials of Time Warner say they continue to hope the
Pathe-MGM/UA deal goes through and believe that it would be a
good one for Time Warner. "We haven't changed our position,"
one company executive said.</p>
<p>Yesterday, MGM/UA shares closed at $16.625, off 50 cents,
in composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange. A
spokesman for MGM/UA said: "The negotiations are proceeding.
Our position is {that} nothing has changed."</p>
<p>Time Warner had said that Pathe itself must come up with
$450 million in equity as part of the offer. Pathe also must
come up with another $150 million in equity, rather than
debt, from outside parties. Time Warner officials say they
aren't prepared to put up any equity themselves or provide
any other kind of financing beyond the existing agreement.</p>
<p>But Pathe, headed by Italian financier Giancarlo Parretti,
has had trouble raising the equity and has asked Time Warner
to ease the equity requirements, a request that Time Warner
has rejected.</p>
<p>Mr. Hamburger said Pathe is now arguing that a loan to
Pathe from Comfinance S.A., a Luxembourg-based affiliate of
Mr. Parretti, should be considered equity because the terms
allow it to be repaid in Pathe stock. Comfinance has agreed
to provide Pathe with $368 million it raised through a
combination of bank loans and asset sales. "We are arguing
that we meet the original terms of Time Warner," said Mr.
Hamburger.</p>
<p>Pathe already has deposited $200 million in cash toward
the acquisition. In the event that the deal fell through,
that amount would be converted into 10 million shares, at $20
each, and held in an escrow account until any litigation was
resolved.</p>
<p>A second issue still under negotiation between Time Warner
and Pathe is additional financing for MGM/UA movie
production. Warner had asked Pathe to provide $200 million
for that purpose. A Pathe spokesman, Craig Parsons, said
Pathe has secured a bank credit line of $125 million toward
movie production. "Pathe is saying we think that is
sufficient," Mr. Parsons said.</p>
<p>Privately, some Time Warner officials acknowledge that the
odds of Pathe completing the transaction on acceptable terms
appear to be diminishing. The snags also leave some analysts
on Wall Street doubting that the MGM/UA acquisition will ever
be completed.</p>
<p>"I've always thought it was an iffy deal. That's going to
be my attitude until the ink is dry," said Alan Kassen of
Morgan Stanley & Co.</p>
<p>"From the start," added analyst John Reidy of Smith
Barney, Harris Upham & Co., "the only thing that gave this
deal credibility was the entrance of Time Warner onto the
scene, and {now} even they have some constraints as to what
they're willing to do."</p>
<p>The question, Mr. Reidy said, is what other deep-pockets
buyer could emerge should the Pathe bid falter. Because an
earlier offer last year from Rupert Murdoch's News Corp.
didn't work out, that company is an unlikely bidder, he
added.</p>
<p>Last October, MGM/UA terminated a $1.5 billion agreement
to be acquired by Qintex Australia Ltd. after Qintex failed
to deliver a $50 million letter of credit.</p>
