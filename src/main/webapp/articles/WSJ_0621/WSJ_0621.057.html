	<h3>Retailing: `Segment' Is New Buzzword for PC Sellers</h3>

	<p class="article-leader">John Howman thinks he knows where the next big wave of
personal-computer buyers will come from.
   "The home market," says the Milwaukee computer-store
owner. "There's going to be an absolute explosion of home and
home-office buyers."</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>But even if he's right, Mr. Howman, president of Allied
Computer Group Inc., a franchisee of ValCom Inc., won't make
much money on his prediction. Like an increasing number of PC
dealers, he's concentrating on a few market segments, and the
home market isn't one of them.</p>
<p>This notion of "segmentation" -- focusing on a limited set
of customers -- is relatively new in the struggling PC retail
business, which has long tried to be all things to all
people. But the concept is gaining ground amid a deepening
profit crisis and prodding from major PC makers, especially
industry leader International Business Machines Corp.</p>
<p>If it's widely adopted, segmentation would augur a major
change in the way PCs are bought and sold. It promises a
world of niche computer outlets, paralleling the rise of
specialty stores in other retail fields. IBM believes such
outlets will promote increased use of computers in specific
businesses, creating new customers and allowing dealers to
reap big profits on specially tailored packages of hardware
and software.</p>
<p>Right now, PC retailers face a simple problem. Although
the unfettered expansion of the early and mid-1980s is over,
the number of dealerships continues to grow apace, chasing a
slow-growing customer base. In the past 18 months, that
disparity has led to an all-out price war, squeezing margins
almost to oblivion. As giants such as Businessland Inc. and
the Computer Factory Inc. continue to post poor results, even
optimists are getting worried.</p>
<p>"Things are pretty bad," says Ed Anderson, chief operating
officer of ComputerLand Corp., a leading computer store
franchiser based in Pleasanton, Calif. "More than a few
people will be selling pens for a living before this is
over."</p>
<p>A wide range of solutions have been proposed, including
catalog shopping, single-brand stores and warehouse-like
"superstores." But segmentation has garnered the most
interest, if not yet the largest following, in part because
IBM is pushing it so aggressively.</p>
<p>IBM, like other computer makers, has a big stake in the
ultimate health of the "channel," as the PC retail market is
known. Unless dealers stop squabbling over current customers
and concentrate on creating new ones, IBM's PC growth will
inevitably stall.</p>
<p>"The real issue dealers must face isn't profitability, but
how to differentiate themselves with the customer," says
David Thomas, head of IBM's National Distribution Division.
"There are people in this business who do well, and they do
well because they have a focus. That's the way to grow a
market."</p>
<p>IBM has identified more than 40 growing market segments,
such as accounting, auto repair shops and beauty salons. The
computer giant believes dealers can pick a few of these
narrow segments and cater to them with specialized packages
of hardware, software and service.</p>
<p>Sears Business Centers in Chicago has taken this tack.
Some salespeople focus on systems tailored for attorneys and
others are assigned exclusively to the distribution industry.
Says Richard Foster, Sears regional general manager: "If I'm
going to sell an expensive system to a customer, I'd better
understand his business. How can I do that if I'm selling to
20 different businesses?"</p>
<p>In Indianapolis, ComputerLand franchisee John Nelson has
started marketing PC systems to small newspapers. Mr. Nelson
says he's still making most of his sales to large customers,
but has discovered that, as IBM promises, niche marketing can
be profitable. "But the software has to be there," he adds.</p>
<p>IBM's Mr. Thomas agrees -- and promises more software in
the future. He says his aim is to ensure that all
IBM-authorized outlets are in a position to woo a
well-defined set of customers.</p>
<p>IBM is offering plenty of incentives to achieve this,
including funds for targeted advertising and discounts on
packages of equipment and software. In all, one analyst
estimates, the incentives may add up to seven extra points of
margin on IBM products. Mr. Thomas won't disclose numbers but
concedes that IBM is spending "a significant amount of
money."</p>
<p>Mr. Thomas insists that "this isn't a forced march," but
IBM also is wielding a big stick. It recently started setting
up barriers to discourage everyone but specialized dealers
from selling certain niche products. It's also restricting
distribution of its hot new RISC System/6000 workstation to
ensure that it's marketed for industry-specific applications.
And Mr. Thomas threatens to help the competitors of any
outlet that refuses to specialize in a market segment that
IBM believes has obvious growth potential.</p>
<p>Other manufacturers are following suit. "We are all
singing the same tune," says Erna Arnesen, Apple Computer
Inc.'s director of value-added channel development. "The
concept of specialization is a critical element of our
long-term strategy." Like IBM, Apple is subsidizing targeted
ads, and it's identifying local consultants who will work
with its dealers to capture certain market segments. Although
Ms. Arnesen says Apple's strategy is based on incentives,
another leading PC maker, Compaq Computer Corp., has set
stringent requirements for dealers who want to sell its
popular SystemPro.</p>
<p>After years of mixed signals from manufacturers, dealers
generally welcome a consistent direction. "We've been asking
for IBM's help on segmentation for years," says Cal Albee,
Businessland's IBM product-line director. "IBM isn't forcing
this on the channel," concurs William Keiper, president of
MicroAge Computer Centers Inc., a unit of MicroAge Inc. "It's
just one of those ideas whose time has come."</p>
<p>But definitions of segmentation vary, and change has been
slow to come. Much of the talk thus far has been lip service:
Most dealers believe they already are focused, and are loath
to sacrifice any part of their revenue stream.</p>
<p>At Computer Factory, for example, Vice President Russ
Madris says he supports segmentation and criticizes PC makers
for being slow to offer incentives and well-focused packages
of hardware and software. But then he goes on to identify
Computer Factory's two main segments: small-to-medium-sized
businesses and large corporate accounts, which together cover
most of the PC business.</p>
<p>"I don't think any one dealer, or especially one chain,
would be smart to pick one skinny segment," he explains. "Our
strategy is a matter of leveraging our strengths to two
different marketplaces."</p>
<p>Seymour Merrin, a PC retail analyst, thinks such attitudes
will prove fatal for many dealers -- and for the strategy of
segmentation. He also believes that "selling to those
segments is an art form that's expensive and unprofitable. If
there was money to be made there, dealers would already be
making it." Instead, he predicts, the future will support
only two types of dealer: the price-oriented superstore and
the service-oriented "superboutique," or systems integrator.
Everyone else, he says, will end up going bankrupt.</p>
<p>ComputerLand's Mr. Anderson, who admits that about
one-third of his firm's franchisees show signs of resisting
change, also prophesies major trouble ahead for PC dealers.
But unlike Mr. Merrin, he believes segmentation really is the
answer.</p>
<p>"What we have here is a bunch of people who think they're
Bo Jackson, and can play two sports simultaneously," he says.
"Well, they just won't make it in either major league. To
survive, people must pick a sport."</p>
