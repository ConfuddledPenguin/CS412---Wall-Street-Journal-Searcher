	<p class="article-leader">President Bush reportedly is pondering whether to be a
major donor to Francois Mitterrand's "Save Gorbachev" fund.
We can suggest two questions:
   1. Which Mikhail Gorbachev are we trying to save, the
liberal or the conservative?</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>2. Exactly how would a large sum -- $20 billion is being
bruited about -- accomplish that task?</p>
<p>President Mitterrand's interview in yesterday's Le Monde
raised the specter of a world-wide impact if President
Gorbachev fails to master the current Soviet crisis. No
disagreement there, but the world has been feeling the impact
of Mr. Gorbachev's inability to control events for some time
now. Not all of the consequences have been unwelcome. A
democratic Poland, Czechoslovakia and Hungary, a reunified
Germany and a reduced Soviet military presence in Asia,
Africa and Central Europe are results of a loss of Soviet
control that we rather like.</p>
<p>We are fully aware of the ominous trends, however. Some
people living within Soviet boundaries are hungry. Famine in
some areas is possible. In such events, industrial nations
would be justified in insisting on direct relief flights to
distressed areas and direct supervision over food
distribution. That too would be expensive, but the money
spent would achieve immediate results. The West is not
without debt to Mikhail Gorbachev, but most of all it owes,
and can afford, humanitarian aid to any starving populace.</p>
<p>Meeting such a contingency, however, is totally different
from pumping $20 billion into some further vague Gorbachev
"economic reform." He has been talking of perestroika for
five years now, while at the same time upholding Communist
rule, something that is antithetical to true reform. Is this
the kind of reformer the West should want to back with $20
billion?</p>
<p>Andrei Anikin, a Russian scholar and author, graphically
describes the current chaotic state of Soviet political and
economic affairs in an article nearby. Mr. Gorbachev
yesterday threatened to step down as leader of the Communist
Party of the Soviet Union (CPSU) if things don't go his way.
The same threat surfaced in January just before a crucial
central committee meeting, although then it was merely a leak
to the CNN news network that was later denied. The ploy
worked in January, but this time it might backfire. As
Professor Anikin notes, Mr. Gorbachev is not as popular at
home as he is abroad.</p>
<p>Should he give up party leadership, Mr. Gorbachev still
would have his five-year term as president of the Soviet
Union. But the survival of the "union" also is in doubt. With
no visible exceptions, the non-Russian republics want out.
Gorbachev rival Boris Yeltsin has won the presidency of the
vast Russian Federation. Part of yesterday's CPSU agenda was
to create a separate Russian Communist Party. In short, the
fragmentation of the Soviet Union is proceeding apace, and
Mr. Gorbachev, as president, soon may have little left to
govern.</p>
<p>Should it be the business of Mr. Mitterrand and Mr. Bush
to halt Soviet fragmentation? It hardly seems so. The seizure
of property and power by local authorities -- a process of de
facto decentralization that already is well under way -- may
be the only hope for averting total collapse. The trading
arrangements these authorities are making independently of
central power could save some areas from exactly the kinds of
calamities that President Mitterrand has every cause to fear.</p>
<p>On the level of Realpolitik, a case can be made for
funneling some money to the Soviets in exchange for their
acceptance of German NATO membership and a full withdrawal of
Soviet troops from Germany. The Germans are appalled when
anyone publicly describes that as their purpose, fearing that
it makes Mr. Gorbachev look like an extortionist. But we are
talking about Realpolitik, not definitions of crime, and full
withdrawal of the Red Army from Central Europe could be worth
$20 billion.</p>
<p>As to saving the Gorbachev reforms, the people supporting
such a move first must answer the question, what reforms?</p>
