	<p class="article-leader">AUSTIN, Texas -- A Texas grand jury has returned the first
indictments in an investigation of the state's insurance
industry, triggered by the $93.5 million collapse of two
companies controlled by high-rolling Texan Robert H. Walker.
   Mr. Walker was charged with a combined 14 counts of theft,
misapplication of funds and filing of false statements in his
management of National County Mutual Fire Insurance Co. and
of Walker General Agency, a primary insurance wholesaler.
Both companies were placed in receivership in late 1988 after
National County was declared insolvent.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Also indicted, on unrelated charges of commercial bribery
and misapplication of funds, were John Gordon, Frances Gordon
and W.H. "Pip" Lasiter, owners of Best Lloyds Insurance Co.,
which was declared insolvent and placed in receivership in
April of 1988. An indictment charging misappropriation of
more than $1 million in premiums also was returned against
R.W. Brayton, an official with the State Board of Insurance
from 1976 through 1979.</p>
<p>State insurance regulators allegedly ignored warnings
about Mr. Walker's flamboyant lifestyle and use of company
premiums for unrelated expenses for several years before
National County collapsed.</p>
<p>According to former associates, Mr. Walker used income
from his auto insurance companies to create a maze of
companies in various industries. He then allegedly siphoned
off cash from this empire to pay the $6,000-a-month mortgage
on his house, buy a nine-seat helicopter with gold-plated
door handles and a yacht in Monte Carlo, among other things.</p>
<p>An outraged state legislature responded to National
County's demise by demanding a statewide investigation of the
industry, and all three members of the State Board of
Insurance were replaced. Steve McCleery, first assistant
district attorney for Travis County, says the grand jury is
reviewing at least 60 additional cases for possible fraud.</p>
<p>Mr. Walker's whereabouts, meanwhile, are unknown, although
he is believed to be living in Europe. Mr. McCleery said a
fugitive warrant will be issued and added that his office has
sought extradition in the past.</p>
