	<p class="article-leader">MOSCOW -- With Western corporations flocking here in
record numbers, the government last year changed the way
Soviets did business with the rest of the world.
   Instead of insisting that all imports and exports be
channeled through a few state-run agencies, the Kremlin ruled
that any Soviet organization could trade directly with
foreign partners.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>It was the sort of move many Western executives had pushed
for, in the hope of unlocking opportunities. For Soviet
managers, it meant liberation from an army of bureaucrats who
were inept at selling their products and who took months or
even years to buy needed machinery abroad.</p>
<p>And in the 14 months since then, Soviet trade has indeed
undergone a revolution of sorts. The number of organizations
doing business abroad has leaped from a handful to more than
14,000. But these, alas, aren't the only far-reaching
changes. Far from bringing the hoped-for benefits, the Soviet
foreign-trade liberalization has left a trail of havoc and
confusion that is costing the Kremlin dearly.</p>
<p>Dozens of Western companies, many of them longtime Soviet
trading partners, have been waiting months to be paid for
deliveries, and some have stopped shipments altogether. The
Soviet Union's reputation as a trustworthy partner has been
badly tarnished. Essential supplies of materials for Soviet
factories, ranging from cocoa to fertilizers, are starting to
dry up. And the Kremlin, already nearly overwhelmed with
domestic problems, now is struggling with a trade debacle it
can barely contain. Soviet officials estimate the total of
unpaid bills at $2 billion.</p>
<p>Thus is the Soviet Union, just as it yearns to revitalize
its economy and link arms with the international world of
free enterprise, caught in a hard-currency squeeze of its own
making. Prime Minister Nikolai Ryzhkov admitted as much to
the Soviet parliament recently, saying steps must be taken
"to bring back the confidence of our overseas partners." The
steps he announced were to increase some exports and cut
imports. But now world financial markets are abuzz with
rumors that the Soviets might use their gold reserves to ease
the currency crisis.</p>
<p>The story of what went wrong with the overhaul of foreign
trade is an instructive tale of the "perestroika" on which
Mikhail Gorbachev and, to a considerable extent, his
erstwhile Cold War adversaries are depending. The trade
liberalization was well-intentioned and by most accounts long
overdue -- yet it came unstuck through a host of unforeseen
difficulties. Almost everyone, from government ministries to
the state banking system, seemingly was caught unprepared.</p>
<p>Trading partners certainly were. For years, the Kremlin
had guaranteed all Soviet import and export transactions,
effectively making business in the U.S.S.R. a risk-free
undertaking. But from April 1, 1989, onward, the government
stopped vouching for transactions, forcing enterprises and
even government agencies to fend for themselves.</p>
<p>M. Golodetz Ltd., a London-based trading organization that
has done business with the Russians since 1921, soon felt the
difference. Over the years, it had built up a close
relationship with its Soviet partners, selling chemicals for
the oil, automaking, construction and consumer industries.
"All our business here was on trust. When we concluded a deal
on the telephone from London or Moscow, we never worried
about signing the contract," says Jack Geller, managing
director of Golodetz. "There were occasions when the contract
was simply forgotten. We delivered and were paid."</p>
<p>Other longtime traders report similar happily
unbureaucratic procedures. Most of them didn't bother with
expensive letters of credit or export insurance, receiving
cash on delivery or shortly thereafter. If the money was
late, a written reminder to the Soviet partner or the foreign
trade bank was enough to elicit the money -- and sometimes an
apology.</p>
<p>All that has now changed. Mr. Geller says that starting in
mid-November, Golodetz didn't receive payments for products
it delivered, and its telexes went unanswered. The British
firm is still waiting for "very substantial" payments and has
ceased most of its shipments. Other executives and Western
bankers in Moscow say almost all sectors of the Soviet
economy have been affected, from chemicals to wool, computers
to machine tools.</p>
<p>"I'm an eternal optimist, but the lack of payments does
hurt," Mr. Geller says.</p>
<p>Soviet and Western officials point to several causes of
this mess. One thing that had happened was that the new
trading system rerouted the flow of Soviet hard currency.
Much of it began to flow not to state organizations but to
the thousands of other organizations selling abroad. But
managers of the exporting enterprises sometimes used their
hard-currency earnings to buy consumer goods for their
workers instead of essential supplies and machinery. So state
organizations continued to buy from abroad largely as before,
even though they sometimes didn't have the money to pay.</p>
<p>Their money squeeze wasn't entirely unprecedented,
however. Unknown to most Western companies, the Soviet Union
had always juggled its cash-flow.</p>
<p>Vladimir Sukharev, a former deputy government minister,
says that every summer Moscow tried to plan its foreign trade
for the next year based largely on calculations of expected
oil revenue. State agencies were then given instructions
about the volume of orders they could place abroad. But if
oil prices fell or the Soviet harvest didn't meet
expectations, plans had to be revised. "There were often
changes," Mr. Sukharev recalls. "Sometimes it meant selling
more gold or oil."</p>
<p>When the government controlled all trade, Western
suppliers rarely noticed such fine-tuning. The new policy
brought the inefficiencies into the open, shifting the burden
of balancing the books onto Soviet enterprises and state
trading agencies.</p>
<p>Soyuzkhimexport is one of the old-line state organizations
that couldn't cope with the change. It is a giant
government-run agency that used to buy virtually all the
chemicals, plastics and related products the U.S.S.R.
imported. Soyuzkhimexport still does the biggest share of
this chemical business. But it ran into trouble because the
government no longer automatically puts up the money for the
orders it places. Revenues from its exports don't nearly
cover the cost of what it imports.</p>
<p>Soyuzkhimexport managers admit that they continued
ordering supplies for Soviet clients even though they didn't
have the money to pay the bills. The organization soon racked
up huge debts to its foreign suppliers, including such big
companies as Du Pont, West Germany's Hoechst and Holland's
Akzo. Many have now stopped deliveries, pending payment.</p>
<p>"We still consider ourselves good partners," says Victor
Rudnez, Soyuzkhimexport's director. But "a big portion of the
cash flow has been taken away from the state," he says, going
now to factories that are in the export business themselves.</p>
<p>Soviet state bankers don't buy this explanation, blaming
managerial failings instead. "They don't balance their ins
and outs correctly," says Yuri Poletaev, deputy chairman of
the state-owned Bank for Foreign Economic Affairs.</p>
<p>But there are signs that the Soviet banking system itself
was overtaxed by the new policy. The Bank for Foreign
Economic Affairs suddenly had to deal with a 300-fold
increase in the number of foreign-trade accounts it oversees.
Lacking sophisticated computers or enough personnel, it
developed a bottleneck.</p>
<p>"The narrowest place is the bank," contends Yuri Gurin, a
former state trading official who now heads an association of
Soviet machinery exporters. He says money from abroad can
sometimes take two months to be cleared.</p>
<p>The bank had painstakingly built a reputation in the West
as a reliable partner. Its officials still insist they are
honoring all their obligations on Soviet sovereign debt. But
Western bankers and business people in Moscow say the Bank
for Foreign Economic Affairs, in trying to resolve the
payments problem, took some steps of its own that added to
the confusion.</p>
<p>They say there is evidence the bank sought to juggle the
hard currency under its jurisdiction, taking money from one
account to pay the bills owed by another. When this merely
compounded the problem, it froze payment from all accounts,
and refused to issue crucial letters of credit that Western
suppliers were increasingly demanding. Then it tried to duck
out of the firing line.</p>
<p>One American businessman says he tried to get an interview
at the bank together with his partner from a Soviet trade
organization that claimed it did have money in its account.
He says the bank told him in no uncertain terms that it would
see him but not his Soviet partner.</p>
<p>Another time, a Soviet trade agency sent a messenger to
the bank with a letter requesting the release of funds in its
account. The bank turned the messenger away, refusing to
accept the letter, according to Western bankers in Moscow.
(The bank declines to comment.)</p>
<p>Officials of the Bank for Foreign Economic Affairs finally
clammed up completely. At a recent business conference, angry
Western executives surrounded Tomas Alibegov, the bank's
deputy chairman, demanding to know why they hadn't been paid
for deliveries. Citing "clerical difficulties," Mr. Alibegov
gave out his business card and left in a hurry.</p>
<p>The card proved little consolation. The bank had moved
earlier this year, so both the address and the phone number
on the card were wrong.</p>
<p>Since then, the Soviet bank has been trying in vain to
raise fresh loans abroad. It has also tried to persuade
companies to turn money they are owed into credits, and in
this it has had more success.</p>
<p>In theory, Soviet factories stood to gain the most from
the trade-policy changes. Before, they couldn't order abroad
directly but had to get the go-ahead from the ministry that
oversaw them, which in turn needed clearance from state
planning authorities. Orders could take months, and sometimes
the wrong kind of material arrived.</p>
<p>Freed to buy and sell, many managers jumped at the chance.
But they have been hampered by a severe lack of experience.
One frustrated West German businessman based in Moscow says
that when he's not chasing unpaid bills, he spends a lot of
his time giving lessons in basic economics to would-be
partners. "It reminds me of the time I worked in Nigeria," he
says. "I give lessons. . . . I explain why the secretary
types and the lawyer doesn't."</p>
<p>All these problems growing out of the sudden overhaul of
trade procedures might have resolved themselves after a
painful transition period. But the already-reeling system
took one too many blows last fall when Mr. Gorbachev, facing
growing worker unrest, suddenly announced plans to import the
equivalent of $16 billion in consumer goods. Government
planners scrambled to accommodate such a high-level political
decision, even though they had doubts the nation could
finance it.</p>
<p>"The unexpected purchases caused big problems," says a
senior official in the Ministry of Foreign Economic Affairs,
adding that they are "one of the main reasons" for the
liquidity squeeze.</p>
<p>Partly as a result of the emergency imports, which
included razor blades, soap, winter boots and clothes, the
Soviet Union posted a trade deficit last year for the first
time in 14 years. The purchases also caused enormous
headaches for the government trading agency that handled
them, known as Raznoexport.</p>
<p>"The transport wasn't ready," says Pavel Vorobyov, a
Raznoexport official. "It all came at once, and we didn't
have enough people to reload and distribute it." The result
was a mad dash to find enough trucks and containers to pick
up the consignments at the Soviet border.</p>
<p>So as the Soviet Union weighs new, more-radical steps
toward restructuring, its economy is still trying to digest
this somewhat-modest trade move made 14 months ago. And in
foreign trade, says Mr. Gurin of the machinery-exporters'
association, "at the moment, nothing works well because of
perestroika.</p>
