	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Chase Manhattan Corp. Chairman Willard C.
Butcher said he will retire Oct. 31, two months earlier than
expected, to clear the way for a major reorganization of the
nation's second-largest banking concern.
   Mr. Butcher said Thomas G. Labrecque, president, will
succeed him as chairman and chief executive officer, as
expected. Arthur F. Ryan, currently the vice chairman in
charge of Chase's highly successful consumer bank, will
succeed Mr. Labrecque.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"Tom Labrecque and I have been working on some of the
responses to the challenges facing the banking business and
we think those responses require some organizational
changes," Mr. Butcher said in an interview. "There will be
some changes in the next level of the corporation and we
believe we couldn't implement those changes until the
succession issue was resolved." He said his long-stated plan
had been to retire on Dec. 31, but that the decision was
advanced in order to give Mr. Labrecque a chance to put the
new organizational structure into place before the end of the
year.</p>
<p>Details of the reorganization will be released next week,
but it is understood to include cutbacks in the bank's
corporate finance department and top personnel changes in
other areas of the company.</p>
<p>Mr. Butcher said that among the challenges facing Chase,
as well as other banks, is the corporate financing business,
where competition for the lower volume of business is vicious
and profit margins are under pressure.</p>
<p>"Obviously, we're going to have to skinny down there," he
said. "We also face challenges in how we configure Europe,
we've got to grapple with the real estate challenge, and we
have to continue to grow certain important businesses like
consumer banking that has been so good to us."</p>
<p>Mr. Labrecque said he expects the reorganization to be
fully in place by the end of the year. He wouldn't comment on
how many employees will lose their jobs as a result of the
reorganization, but he said the negative financial effects
would be outweighed by the postive effects and that most
write-offs would be taken this year.</p>
<p>Chase isn't alone in its cutbacks. Earlier this week,
Bankers Trust New York Corp. announced that it was slicing 75
people from its corporate finance department.</p>
<p>Manufacturers Hanover Corp. executives say that they have
seen memos targeting 25% reductions in personnel for some
departments, and Bank of Boston Corp. recently eliminated its
highly leveraged transaction unit.</p>
<p>In addition, for the first quarter Chase posted
disappointing earnings and a big rise in non-performing
loans. Chase reported earnings of $44 million, or 20 cents a
share, compared with $132 million, or $1.27 a share a year
earlier. Non-accrual loans rose to $4.1 billion in the first
quarter from $3.9 billion at the end of last year.</p>
<p>Mr. Butcher, 63 years old, will become chairman of the
executive committee of the board of directors on Oct. 31 for
a one-year term. He has served as chairman of Chase since
1980 when he succeeded David Rockefeller. Mr. Labrecque, 51,
was named vice chairman of the board and chief operating
officer in June 1980 and was subsequently elected president
in April 1981. Mr. Ryan, 47, was named vice chairman for
individual banking in November 1984.</p>
