	<p class="article-leader">SAN FRANCISCO -- The Sixth International Conference on
AIDS opened amid protests against U.S. immigration and health
policies.
   After a night of demonstrations at the Immigration and
Nationalization Service building here and the storming of a
local hotel, protesters yesterday pushed past police lines
into Moscone Center as 12,000 delegates filed in for opening
ceremonies.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Police arrested about 90 demonstrators associated with the
AIDS activist group ACT UP. Four of the protesters made it
into the giant conference center before they were taken into
custody.</p>
<p>At a news conference before the opening ceremonies, June
Osborne, chairwoman of the National Commission on AIDS,
expressed "personal horror" at U.S. policy restricting people
with AIDS from entering the U.S. The policy is opposed by the
U.S. Public Health Service, the International Red Cross, the
European Parliament and many national and international
health groups. Many here called on President Bush to end the
curbs.</p>
<p>"Discrimination is the single greatest enemy of public
health," said Dr. Osborne in remarks prepared for delivery at
the opening ceremonies.</p>
<p>In a speech aimed as much at the White House as at the
meeting's delegates, Dr. Osborne said bias drives patients --
"our most important collaborators" -- underground, and thus
threatens "the deployment of elegant scientific advances"
that could lead to a cure. No breakthroughs are expected
among the 3,000 research papers slated for presentation over
the next four days, but progress reports on drugs and vaccine
experiments are anticipated.</p>
<p>Dr. Osborne dedicated her talk to those who were absent --
both casualties of the epidemic itself and of the immigration
policy. To date, the World Health Organization estimates
there are 650,000 cases of AIDS world-wide, with a further
6.5 million people infected by the virus but not yet
exhibiting symptoms of the disease. The U.S. Centers for
Disease Control counts 136,204 cases of AIDS through the end
of May, with an estimated one million Americans infected. The
U.S. death toll now has surpassed 83,145, more than the
combined battle deaths of the Vietnam and Korean wars.</p>
<p>In a reference to President Bush, who declined to attend
the conference, Peter Staley, an invited speaker from ACT UP,
led the delegates in a chant of "300,000 dead from AIDS --
Where is George?"</p>
<p>AIDS scholars, meanwhile, proffered hope through research.
"In this decade, we have come a long way in understanding HIV
infection," said Dr. Jay A. Levy, professor of medicine at
the University of California at San Francisco, in a prepared
text.</p>
<p>"AIDS infection has its long-term survivors," he added,
with 25% of virus-positive people remaining healthy for 10 to
12 years. Research on how the virus enters certain target
cells in the body and how its genes boost the virus's
virulence will offer drug and vaccine designers potential new
points of attack, he said.</p>
<p>At a related conference across town on combination drug
therapies, members of ACT UP threw leaflets and interrupted
speakers, cutting short a presentation by Jerome E. Groopman
of Harvard University. Dr. Groopman, an AIDS researcher,
asked demonstators to allow him and others to present their
information. When protests continued, he left the stage.</p>
<p>ACT UP, which has accused researchers of putting too much
emphasis on Wellcome PLC's AZT drug, held a mock trial of
five scientists in the AIDS Clinical Trial Group, which
conducts drug tests in concert with the National Institutes
of Health. "We plan to try them for crimes against gay
people," said Kevin Farrell, an ACT UP member.</p>
<p>One of the "defendants," Lawrence Corey, a researcher at
the University of Washington, Seattle, was responsible for
findings about low-dose usage of AZT that could curb side
effects and lessen the problem of viral resistance. "I am a
scientist here to attend a meeting," said Dr. Corey. "I have
no comment, please."</p>
