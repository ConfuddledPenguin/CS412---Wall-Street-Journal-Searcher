	<p class="article-leader">OAKLAND, Calif. -- The financially beleaguered Oakland
Tribune said it was firing one-fourth of its 725-person work
force -- including 40% of its executive staff -- in an effort
to stay afloat. The announcement was made by Robert C.
Maynard, the newspaper's owner and president.
   The declining fortunes of the former Gannett Corp.
publication have been the subject of persistent speculation
for months. The paper, acquired by Mr. Maynard in 1983, has
been plagued by steadily slumping circulation and
advertising, in part from stiffening competition, in part
from Oakland's economic woes. The Tribune suffered yet
another blow when severe damage from the Oct. 17 earthquake
set back blossoming Oakland revitalization efforts, and
subsequently sapped advertising revenues.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Mr. Maynard, in a statement, said he has asked the
Tribune's various unions, representing 70% of its employees,
for their "participation in the restructuring."</p>
<p>"It gives me no pleasure to think of the Tribune losing a
quarter of its employees. We are, after all, family," he
said.</p>
<p>Mr. Maynard is a nationally known journalist and
syndicated columnist whose buy-out of the Tribune drew
considerable attention when it made him the first black owner
of a major metropolitan newspaper in the U.S. The paper, with
a circulation of 130,000, earlier this year won a Pulitzer
Prize for photography.</p>
