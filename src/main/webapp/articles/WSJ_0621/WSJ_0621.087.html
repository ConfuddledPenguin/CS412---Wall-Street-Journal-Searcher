	<p class="article-leader">Friday, June 22, 9-10 p.m. EDT, on PBS (PBS air dates and
times vary, so check local listings): "Evening at Pops."
Melissa Manchester sings Gershwin, along with an assortment
of torch songs and blues, accompanied by saxophonist Benny
Carter. The centerpiece of this production is their joint
rendering of the immortal "Sophisticated Lady."</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Sunday, June 24, 8-9 p.m. EDT, on Arts & Entertainment:
"Art in the Third Reich." The first of a two-part series on
Nazi painting, sculpture and architecture. A detailed look at
how fascist culture and ideology found its expression in all
forms of art in the Reich, including furniture design. Nazi
art, the documentary notes, drew from the styles of the
period, in a sinister wedding of ideology and fashion.
Repeats at midnight. (Part two airs Sunday July 1, 8-9 p.m.
and repeats at midnight.)</p>
<p>Monday, June 25, 8-9 p.m. EDT, on PBS: "The Struggle for
Democracy -- An Update." Host Patrick Watson conducts
interviews with citizens and government officials in Poland,
the Soviet Union and Romania.</p>
<p>Monday, June 25, 9-11 p.m. EDT, on ABC: "All-Star Pro
Sports Awards." This first annual ceremony will name the
public's choices for athlete of the year in baseball,
basketball, boxing, football, golf, ice hockey, horse racing,
tennis and auto racing. Winners were chosen by ballots mailed
or phoned in by fans. Stars of Hollywood and television --
Clint Eastwood, John Candy, Arnold Schwarzenegger and such --
will be making guest appearances at this ceremony, the
producers of which hope to make it an annual event on the
order of the Oscars. If only in the interest of social
responsibility, they should consider putting this particular
ambition aside. The prospect of yet another annual rite of
congratulation, another parade of winners discoursing
lengthily on the thanks owed to family, coaches, longtime
companions and astrologers is almost as chilling as the
possibility of Oscar-style political manifestoes delivered by
jocks. This year, at least, intentional hilarity will be
provided by the awards emcee, comic Richard Lewis.</p>
<p>Monday, June 25, 9-11 p.m. EDT, on PBS: "Firing Line
Special Debate." "A United Germany: Anything to Worry About?"
Former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger discusses the
possible rise of the Fourth Reich with former Treasury
Secretary William Simon, British Member of Parliament Roy
Hattersley, U.S. Ambassador to West Germany Vernon Walters,
International Herald Tribune editor John Vinocur and, of
course, William F. Buckley Jr.</p>
<p>Tuesday, June 26, 9-10 EDT, on PBS: "Giving Up the Canal."
One participant in this documentary calls it "our moon shot
of the early 1900s." The building of the Panama Canal was in
fact a triumph of American achievement. Where the French had
been defeated by the jungle and the mosquitoes, the Americans
prevailed and built the canal. In 1977, the Carter
administration agreed to treaties that will give the canal to
Panama in the year 2000. This somewhat deceptively titled
film, narrated by the always reassuring Edwin Newman,
provides riveting material on the digging of the canal, and
what it calls "the U.S. city-state" in Panama. But all too
soon, history is cast aside in favor of talkiness, mostly
talkiness of a familiar, if not absolutely mindnumbing, kind
about the failures of our Latin American policy.</p>
<p>Wednesday, June 27, 9-10:30 p.m. EDT, on PBS: "American
Playhouse" this time out offers Tom Kempinski's aptly named
"Separation," the story of a romance begun under what are,
you will admit, daunting circumstances. An emotionally
crippled British playwright and an American actress afflicted
with a rare neurological disease face up to the challenge of
love. Even people without this duo's fundamental disabilities
would find it challenging to conduct an amorous relationship
entirely via transatlantic telephone.</p>
<p>Wednesday, July 4, 8:05-9:35 EDT, on TBS: "Festival at
Ford Theater." There is but one reason to watch this: the
remarkable performance of presidential impersonator Jim
Morris as he captures George Bush's preppy persona perfectly,
with an admirable touch of spleen. Encore Tuesday, July 10,
12:35-2:a.m.</p>
<p>Wednesday, July 4, 9-10 p.m. EDT, on A&E: The first
installment of a new 17-part documentary series, "The War
Years," to be continued on subsequent Wednesdays. The World
War II footage is extraordinary and mostly unfamiliar, edited
so as to concentrate in almost leisurely fashion on details.
The result is a harrowing, suspenseful close-up of the war,
and the preparation for it. The first chapter, dealing with
the Nazi staging of the invasion of Poland, and then, the
onslaught itself, provides a lingering last look at the
Warsaw that was. It is history as it should be told. It is,
above all, history that should not be missed.</p>
