	<p class="article-leader">Media General Inc., Richmond, Va., said it put up for sale
its Garden State Paper Co.'s newsprint recycling mill in
Garfield, N.J.
   Media General said the planned sale is part of its
strategy to concentrate on its communications properties,
which include daily newspapers, network-affiliated broadcast
television stations, and cable TV systems.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Media General hired Goldman, Sachs & Co. to handle the
sale of the recycling mill; an asking price wasn't disclosed.
The mill has 220,000-ton capacity and will be sold with
related recycling centers and other waste-paper operations. A
Garden State Paper official said that an oversupply of
newsprint in the market has led to depressed prices for
newsprint, but that recycled newsprint, which is in greater
demand, is scarce and selling at premium prices.</p>
<p>Media General will retain its one-third ownership in a
recycled-newsprint operation in Dublin, Ga., which it owns
with Knight-Ridder Inc. and Cox Enterprises Inc.</p>
