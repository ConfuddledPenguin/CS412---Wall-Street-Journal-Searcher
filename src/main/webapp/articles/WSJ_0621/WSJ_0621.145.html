	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Stock prices closed mixed as a late round of
buying offset a midday sell-off that was triggered by a
report from the Federal Reserve that further damped hopes for
lower interest rates.
   The Dow Jones Industrial Average rebounded from
double-digit losses to finish with a gain of 1.74 at 2895.30,
and broader indexes also ended slightly higher.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Despite the market's gyrations, trading activity remained
lackluster as concerns with rates and corporate earnings
continued to hang over investors. New York Stock Exchange
volume amounted to 137,420,000 shares, compared with
134,930,000 on Tuesday.</p>
<p>"We really have a market that has no sustaining power up
and no sustaining power down, as indicated by the lack of
volume in either direction," said Jack Solomon, a technical
analyst at Bear, Stearns.</p>
<p>After stocks failed to sustain opening gains, the market
skidded to session lows at midday after the Fed issued its
"beige book" summary of economic conditions. In the report,
the central bank said there had been "continued slow growth
in the economy with little change in the underlying inflation
rate."</p>
<p>That assessment, arriving on the heels of some
better-than-expected economic reports for May, triggered a
sell-off in bonds that spilled into stocks. Long-term
Treasury issues showed losses in late trading of around 1/2
point, or $5 per $1,000 face amount.</p>
<p>But stock prices rebounded near the close in a recovery
fueled by program buying related to stock-index arbitrage,
which went into effect after index futures contracts advanced
to sharp premiums to the cash indexes.</p>
<p>Standard & Poor's 500-Stock Index climbed 0.63 to 359.10,
while the New York Stock Exchange Composite Index gained 0.23
to 195.84 and the Dow Jones Equity Market Index added 0.45 to
334.22. Declining issues outnumbered advancers on the Big
Board, however, by 777 to 668.</p>
<p>Rate-sensitive issues, especially those in the banking and
financial-services sectors, were hit with selling as the
outlook for rates turned for the worse. Citicorp went down
3/8 to 22 1/2 in Big Board composite trading of 1.4 million
shares, Federal National Mortgage Association declined 7/8 to
40 on 1.2 million shares, and American Express lost 5/8 to 30
1/8.</p>
<p>Among regional banks, Banc One eased 5/8 to 28 7/8 as 1.9
million shares changed hands. An offering of 10 million
common shares of the bank holding company was made at $29 a
share. First Interstate Bancorp dropped 1 1/2 to 40 1/8, NCNB
lost 5/8 to 37 5/8, MNC Financial eased 3/8 to 14 1/4 and
SunTrust Banks fell 5/8 to 21 1/8.</p>
<p>Chevron fell 3/4 to 70 7/8, but the market's late rebound
swept oil stocks higher even though oil prices extended a
decline in which the price of crude has reached 18-month
lows. Exxon rose 1/2 to 47 7/8, Texaco added 3/4 to 58, Mobil
gained 5/8 to 63, Amoco rose 1 3/4 to 53 1/2 and Unocal went
up 3/8 to 28 5/8.</p>
<p>Upjohn rose 2 1/8 to 42 1/8 on 1.5 million shares amid
renewed speculation that the drug company could follow the
lead of others in the industry and seek a merger partner.
Schering-Plough was mentioned as a potential suitor for the
company, along with American Home Products, traders told Dow
Jones Professional Investor Report. Upjohn declined to
comment.</p>
<p>Diversified Energies rose 1 1/4 to 32 1/2. The stock's
advance came after a block trade of 968,000 shares, amounting
to 6% of its shares outstanding and accounting for the bulk
of the stock's trading. The company said it believed Service
Corp. International, which owned a 7.1% stake as of early
April, sold the shares into "friendly hands."</p>
<p>Consolidated Freightways fell 1 7/8 to 13 7/8. The company
said it would have to suspend dividend payments on its common
stock under provisions of an agreement for a new $860 million
line of credit, as well as amendments to existing bank
arrangements.</p>
<p>Abbott Laboratories gained 1 to 40. A Food and Drug
Administration advisory committee recommended approval of a
test kit, produced by the company, to help physicians assess
growth or shrinkage of tumors in breast-cancer patients.</p>
<p>Motorola went up 1 to 86 after a federal court granted a
stay of a lower-court decision that would have required the
company to stop selling a computer chip found to infringe on
Hitachi's patents. Separately, the company is expected to
disclose plans for a new satellite-communications system that
may permit expanded coverage by cellular-phone systems within
a few years.</p>
<p>A set of dividend-related trades early in the session
swelled volume in Canadian Pacific, which added 1/8 to 18 on
2.1 million shares. The stock carries a dividend yield of
5.1% and goes ex-dividend today.</p>
<p>Hilton Hotels rose 1 3/8 to 57 3/8 amid speculation that
the company may be interested in reacquiring the Trump Castle
hotel-casino in Atlantic City, N.J., from Donald Trump, who
has run into financial troubles. Hilton declined to comment.</p>
<p>RJR Nabisco Holdings warrants fell 1/8 to 6 1/2. As
expected, the company and Kohlberg Kravis Roberts announced
that they are working on a refinancing that will involve
retiring "a significant amount" of the junk bonds issued in
its leveraged buy-out.</p>
<p>AMP rose 3/8 to 51. Merrill Lynch named the issue, which
carries its highest investment ratings, as "focus stock of
the week." Among other things, the firm said it expects AMP's
earnings to begin improving before year end.</p>
<p>Environmental Systems went up 3/8 to 14 after Brambles
Industries, the company's largest shareholder, said it hasn't
sold any part of its 23% interest and isn't planning to do
so. However, Brambles acknowledged that it had considered
reducing its stake.</p>
<p>Contel, which filed for the sale of 14.5 million common
shares, declined 5/8 to 27 1/8. The company said it would use
the proceeds to reduce debt resulting from its Contel
Cellular unit's purchase of cellular properties in February.</p>
<p>The American Stock Exchange Market Value Index fell 0.02
to 360.81. Volume totaled 13,890,000 shares.</p>
<p>Fruit of the Loom dropped 7/8 to 12 1/4 on 1.9 million
shares. Chairman William Farley has been reducing his
holdings in the company since March; company officials
couldn't be reached for comment on the stock's latest round
of activity.</p>
<p>Oneita Industries lost 1 1/4 to 8. Oppenheimer & Co.,
citing weakness in the T-shirt industry, lowered its earnings
estimates for the fiscal year that ends in September and the
following year.</p>
<p>Binks Manufacturing gained 2 1/4 to 42 although the
company denied it had received a takeover offer, as disclosed
by Kelso Management, a major shareholder. Kelso said the bid
was higher than the $45-a-share offer made earlier this year
by Illinois Tool Works.</p>
