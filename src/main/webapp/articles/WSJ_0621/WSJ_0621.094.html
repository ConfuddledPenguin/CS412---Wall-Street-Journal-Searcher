	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Straight Arrow Publishers Inc. said it will
launch a new general interest men's magazine, joining an
increasingly crowded field.
   Straight Arrow, which publishes Rolling Stone and US
magazines, said it will launch the as-yet-unnamed magazine in
fall 1991. The closely held company had recently been rumored
as a buyer for Smart, a year-old men's magazine owned by New
American Magazines Co.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The Straight Arrow publication will join a horde of new
U.S. men's magazines that focus on issues beyond typical male
magazine topics. News Corp.'s Murdoch Magazines plans to
launch Men's Life this fall. Christopher Kimball, the founder
of Cook's magazine, is planning Men, aimed at the
25-to-40-year-old set. And Conde Nast Publications Inc. has
revamped Details as a style magazine for young men.</p>
<p>John Rasmus, 36-years-old, who for the past six years has
been the editor of Outside, a Chicago-based monthly, will be
the editor of Straight Arrow's new publication. Under Mr.
Rasmus, Outside magazine won two National Magazine Awards.</p>
