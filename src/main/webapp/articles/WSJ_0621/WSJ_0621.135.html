	<p class="article-leader">Amax Inc., continuing the decentralization and
consolidation of its corporate structure, plans to cut about
40%, or 80 jobs, from its total corporate work force of 200
by year end.
   The company, which has interests in domestic energy and
gold production as well as aluminum and manufactured aluminum
products, plans to close its Greenwich, Conn., office by year
end. Amax, based in New York, moved its executive offices
there from Greenwich in 1988 and moved other jobs there
earlier this year.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>An Amax spokesman said some of the Greenwich employees
would be transferred to New York. He said some functions
would be assigned to operating units and some jobs would be
eliminated.</p>
<p>The spokesman said the company expects some cost savings
from the layoffs, but he didn't estimate them. He said he
believed the appropriate write-offs would be taken this year.</p>
<p>Amax, which had 20,000 employees at the end of 1989, had a
56% drop in first quarter net income, to $50 million, or 57
cents a share, a result of the softening economy and sharply
lower aluminum prices. Sales fell 5.3% to $927.9 million.</p>
