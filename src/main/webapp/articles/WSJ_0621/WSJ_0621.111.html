	<p class="article-leader">GPA Group PLC of Ireland, an aircraft lessor, said it
signed a 10-year lease agreement with the Canton region of
the Civil Aviation Administration of China for five 737-300
planes and five 737-500s made by Boeing Co., Seattle.
   The new aircraft, which will be delivered between December
1990 and December 1991, will enter service with China
Southern, the new airline that will replace the Canton CAAC
regional administration in September. As part of the
agreement, GPA said, it will buy 10 older-version 737s from
CAAC and lease them to airlines in China or elsewhere.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>GPA said the agreement represents the first time a Chinese
airline has signed for a so-called operating lease -- a
relatively short-term, off-balance-sheet rental -- of
passenger jetliners. The company estimated that China will
need to lease or buy 400 more jetliners in the next 15 years.</p>
