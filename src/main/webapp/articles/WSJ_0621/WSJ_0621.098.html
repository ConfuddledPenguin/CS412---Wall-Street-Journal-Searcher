	<p class="article-leader">RJR Nabisco Inc.'s junk bonds soared as much as 6%
yesterday as the company confirmed it is considering ways to
retire "a significant amount" of its most troublesome bonds.
   As reported in yesterday's Wall Street Journal, RJR has
begun a vast refinancing effort that centers on retiring at
least $4 billion of high-yield "junk" bonds. The program is
being negotiated by RJR's main shareholder, Kohlberg Kravis
Roberts & Co. It involves bonds that are due to have their
interest rates reset by next April; difficulties with that
reset could hurt the food and tobacco company's financial
health.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The biggest price run-up yesterday came in RJR's
convertible reset bonds of 2009, which jumped $62.50 for each
$1,200 face amount, to close at $971.25 each. Those bonds now
are regarded as likely candidates to be exchanged for cash or
a new convertible preferred stock. RJR's reset bonds of 2007,
meanwhile, climbed $42.50 for each $1,000 face amount, to
$806.25. As word of RJR's refinancing plans has gradually
emerged the past two weeks, both series of bonds have risen
nearly 15% in price.</p>
<p>Junk-bond specialists were pleased about RJR's plans, but
wary of sounding too enthusiastic until it's clear that all
the necessary financing is in place. "It's pretty good news,"
said Carolyn Katz, an analyst at Goldman, Sachs & Co., "but
we have to see the precise terms first."</p>
<p>RJR said it expects to finish its deliberations and start
its refinancing program by the end of July. Bankers expect
RJR to raise $2.25 billion in fresh bank loans and as much as
$1.7 billion from an equity infusion by limited partnerships
that KKR controls. In addition, RJR may issue $1.5 billion of
convertible preferred stock in exchange for some of the reset
bonds outstanding.</p>
<p>If the RJR refinancing is carried out as currently
planned, it will reduce the company's debt-to-equity ratio
from a daredevil 28:1 to a more conservative, though still
high 5:1, according to sources familiar with the plan.
Although that would reduce the potential profits that the
leveraged buy-out firm of KKR can earn on the buy-out, it
would put RJR on a sounder financial footing.</p>
<p>Beyond its three-paragraph news release, RJR declined to
comment on its refinancing. "We think that further
elaboration at this point would complicate things," a
spokesman said.</p>
<p>Even so, some money managers quickly issued bullish
assessments of the likely refinancing package. "It's pretty
attractive," said one West Coast arbitrager, who had bought
RJR junk bonds at prices as low as 60 cents on the dollar.
"I'm not a pig," he added. "If they can get me out at 85
cents on the dollar, I'm a happy departee."</p>
<p>Analysts cautioned that many junk-bond holders' selling
price appears to be 7% to 10% above whatever the current
market price is. That suggests that as the junk bonds
appreciate, RJR may have a hard time buying them back at much
less than face value.</p>
<p>Some investors said the reported terms of the preferred --
a 10% dividend and conversion into RJR equity at about a 50%
premium to the indicated current market price -- seem
appealing enough. Alan Snyder, president of San
Francisco-based Snyder Capital Management, argued that the
preferred issue will compare favorably with a similar issue
of convertible preferred stock issued by Time Warner Inc.</p>
<p>But a more bearish view was expressed by traders at
Goldman, Sachs & Co., who suggested that RJR would have to
lower the conversion premium to make the preferred trade at
face value. Terms are likely to be thrashed around for the
next month or more.</p>
<p>Analysts say it's clear that KKR is choosing a more
cautious, safer course. "People believe this deal is KKR's
franchise," said Edward Mally, an analyst at Salomon Brothers
Inc. "They want to believe that at the end of the day, they
have to make it work. This isn't a situation where they can
afford to hurt bondholders."</p>
<p>Executives close to RJR say an improving outlook at the
company may be encouraging KKR to invest more equity in its
buy-out. Although RJR posts net losses because of its big
interest bill, operating profit in the first quarter of this
year surged 50% from a year earlier. Its operating profit
from tobacco jumped 40% in the first quarter, robust growth
for any industry, let alone one in which domestic demand is
shrinking more than 3% a year. RJR's operating profit from
food grew 18% in the first period.</p>
<p>"They're getting a hell of a lot more cash flow than they
ever expected," said a senior executive close to RJR.</p>
<p>RJR also may be starting to look for growth by
acquisitions, after a flurry of divestitures the past 16
months that helped reduce debt. Since the buy-out, many
food-industry analysts have expected RJR to shed its
shredded-wheat breakfast cereal division because the unit
holds just a small slice of its market. But RJR executives
have apparently decided to hold the business for now, said an
executive close to Nabisco, and are even considering an
acquisition to increase market share.</p>
