	<p class="article-leader">A STORY on page B1 of yesterday's edition incorrectly
reported that Distribution Warehouse & Service Corp. and REI
Distributors were named in criminal complaints brought by an
individual alleging the misuse of milk crates. Neither
company was named in the complaints, and neither has been
accused of any illegality. The complaints name an individual
at each company, but not the company itself.
