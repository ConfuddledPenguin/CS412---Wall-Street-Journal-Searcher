	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- Economic activity continues to be weak in
most regions of the country, with new signs of constraints in
credit, according to a Federal Reserve report.
   The construction industry is particularly frail, the Fed
said, and the credit squeeze is concentrated in real estate.
The Fed, in a report on a survey of the 12 regional reserve
banks, also noted weakness in retailing.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>In its previous survey of regional economic conditions,
conducted in March and April and released in May, the Fed
noted some tightness in real estate credit in the Northeast,
but said it saw little evidence of a widespread credit
crunch.</p>
<p>In the latest report, which will help guide officials of
the central bank when they meet to set policy July 2 and 3,
both the Richmond Fed and St. Louis Fed, covering sizable
portions of the Midwest and East Coast, reported tightening
of credit in their districts. Economists at the San Francisco
Fed found that "lending standards have become more stringent
in recent months." Home builders around New York City and
northern New Jersey are finding that a shortage of credit for
acquisition and construction is "becoming a major problem."</p>
<p>While the tightening in credit seems to be limited to real
estate, the Fed said, "limited information suggests small
business firms in some areas may be affected."</p>
<p>Evidence has mounted over the past several months that
banks, reacting to pressure from regulators and the soft
economy, have become increasingly cautious in lending to
small and midsize businesses. This has been particularly
apparent in the real estate industry, one of the weakest
areas of the economy. Economists and government officials
have been watching the situation carefully, out of concern
that the economy could stall if credit becomes too scarce.</p>
<p>The Fed survey doesn't suggest that credit conditions are
reaching such a serious stage. In Cleveland, the squeeze is
limited to borrowing for commercial buildings and large
residential structures, according to the survey, while there
appear to be ample funds for single-family housing. Weak loan
demand in Atlanta has driven banks to encourage borrowing.</p>
<p>Generally the report sketched a picture of an economy that
is sluggish in most areas of the country, with little
evidence of change in the inflation rate.</p>
<p>The following is a summary of activity in each of the Fed
districts:</p>
<p>Boston. (The Boston bank covers Massachusetts, Maine, New
Hampshire, Vermont, Rhode Island and most of Connecticut.)
Many retailers report flat or declining sales and high
inventories. Manufacturers are doing a bit better; sales and
orders are generally running above last year's levels and
inventories are in line. Job losses are expected to mount
through the end of the year, and no significant job growth is
expected before 1992. The battered construction, finance and
real estate industries probably won't turn around until 1992,
a regional research firm predicts.</p>
<p>New York. (New York state, northern New Jersey and
Fairfield County, Conn.) Office vacancy rates in Manhattan
have reached their highest level in two decades, but they
have stabilized elsewhere in the region. Unemployment remains
below the national average. Nevertheless, General Electric
Co.'s aerospace division is planning to eliminate 4,200 jobs
over the next 2 1/2 years, responding to drops in defense
spending. Half of the losses will be in upstate New York. But
a new GE electronics-parts plant outside Binghamton, N.Y.,
will bring 500 new jobs to the area.</p>
<p>Philadelphia. (Eastern Pennsylvania, Delaware and southern
New Jersey.) Manufacturers here believe their yearlong
decline may be leveling off. Consumers don't seem to be
spending freely; rather they are shopping for the best price
and quality of goods for which they feel "relatively urgent
need." Loan growth continues, although a slowdown appears to
be developing. The reason is mostly a drop in demand.
Commercial and residential construction continues to decline.</p>
<p>Cleveland. (Ohio, western Pennsylvania, eastern Kentucky
and northern West Virginia.) Many firms here are increasing
capital spending. Multinational companies are finding
overseas markets remain generally strong. Major retailers say
May and June sales have been disappointing. The culprits are
cold and rainy weather, slowing income gains and competition
from discount chains. Credit standards have tightened but
"ample funds" are still available outside real estate and
highly leveraged transactions.</p>
<p>Richmond, Va. (Virginia, Maryland, North and South
Carolina, District of Columbia, most of West Virginia.)
Retail sales are flat, and manufacturing is softening a bit.
Tourism has been mixed. Home sales are generally steady, but
housing construction is down. Demand for business loans
decreased slightly in May, while applications for home-equity
loans grew in many regions.</p>
<p>Atlanta. (Georgia, Alabama, Florida, eastern Tennessee,
southern Mississippi, southern Louisiana.) Sales of
appliances and other durable goods are declining, reflecting
the weak housing market. Auto sales have also weakened
further, dealers report. Manufacturing activity is picking up
in many sectors, but the auto and textile industries remain
sluggish. Overbuilt markets and stringent lending conditions
are hurting the construction industry. Many banks see weak
consumer loan demand. Employers report little change in wage
and price pressures.</p>
<p>Chicago. (Northern Illinois, Iowa, lower peninsula of
Michigan, most of Indiana, southern Wisconsin.) Manufacturing
is beginning to improve, while construction and retail sales
are weakening. Bad weather in May and early June damaged
crops and slowed planting. Plans for some large construction
projects in Chicago are being pushed back, but so far few
have been canceled.</p>
<p>St. Louis. (Eastern Missouri, Arkansas, western Kentucky,
western Tennessee, northern Mississippi, southern Illinois,
southern Indiana.) Many of the biggest commercial banks have
tightened standards for loans to small and medium-size
businesses. Excessive rainfall has damaged crops and delayed
planting. A growing number of retailers are reporting larger
than desired inventories. Defense cutbacks are beginning to
be felt. The pending scale-back of a military base in
Kentucky has brought a decline in retail sales and a rise in
the inventory of unsold homes in the area. A cut in military
orders led to a sharp drop in production at an Illinois shoe
factory. Makers of building materials, however, are
benefiting from an improvement in the Texas economy.</p>
<p>Minneapolis. (Minnesota, Montana, North and South Dakota,
northern Wisconsin, upper peninsula of Michigan.) Conditions
here have been "moderately good" lately, though there are
signs of softening. Employment growth is low and retail sales
growth is slowing. Car sales are particularly soft. Housing
sales are still quite strong, but housing construction is
weak. Manufacturers of scientific and medical instruments
report vigorous growth. But electronics firms in the
Minneapolis area are having troubles. Defense suppliers
report drops in orders and production. Forest-product and
mining industries are doing well.</p>
<p>Kansas City. (Western Missouri, Kansas, Oklahoma,
Nebraska, Wyoming, Colorado, northern New Mexico.) Thrifts
report weak mortgage demand but banks say loan demand is
steady or rising. Plentiful spring rains seem to have brought
an end to the region's two-year drought. Both retailers and
manufacturers are trying to trim inventories. New home sales
are slow.
</p>
<p>Dallas. (Texas, northern Louisiana, southern New Mexico.)
Oil equipment sales are accelerating. Electronics and
computer firms say their sales are increasing after a slump
late last year. Although retail sales are slowing, many
national chains say sales in the region are outperforming the
national pace. Service firms report some growth in demand.
Construction remains weak. Business construction contract
values have risen slightly but remain well below levels of
late last year. Although oil prices have fallen, the energy
sector of the region's economy is expanding.</p>
<p>San Francisco. (California, Washington, Oregon, Idaho,
Nevada, Utah, Arizona, Alaska and Hawaii.) This is still the
healthiest region in the country. Nevertheless, business
leaders expect slow growth over the next year. Capacity
constraints are limiting commercial aircraft production.
Several defense firms have announced layoffs recently, but
they hope "the strength of commercial aviation, as well as
possible increases in NASA funding" will bring continued
business. Conditions are healthy in most Western real estate
markets. Despite widely publicized problems in Arizona real
estate markets, home prices there have remained relatively
stable. Arizona banks, however, will only lend to builders
with "excellent records and significant equity." Car dealers
in the region are concerned about tightening credit criteria.</p>
