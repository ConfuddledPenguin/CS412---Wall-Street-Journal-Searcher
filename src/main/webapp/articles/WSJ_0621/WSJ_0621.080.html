	<p class="article-leader">Perhaps the only good news coming out of the S&L mess is
that it has awakened some policy makers to the $863 billion
in potential liabilities piled up by such entities as Fannie
Mae, Freddie Mac and Sallie Mae.
   Last month, a Treasury study of their financial safety and
soundness concluded that these off-budget lending
institutions must adopt stricter capital standards, a credit
rating not based on their taxpayer guarantees and full
disclosure in the federal budget. It makes little sense to
allow these entities to operate as private-sector companies
and still be backed up by federal guarantees.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>However, some of them already have started wheeling out
their lobbying guns. Three House committee chairmen -- Henry
Gonzalez and Kika de la Garza of Texas and Gus Hawkins of
California -- have written Speaker Foley demanding that
reform of these government-sponsored enterprises, or GSEs, be
taken off the table at the budget summit. That way any reform
proposals will have to be routed through their committees,
where they can be "modified."</p>
<p>The sudden concern of these committee chairmen for the
prerogatives of these agencies is striking. Save for when the
Farm Credit System went bust in 1985, no one at their
respective committees could recall the last time any of them
held an oversight hearing on their financial condition. Given
the lack of attention that GSEs have received to date, the
budget summit negotiators would be remiss if they didn't put
reforming them high up on the agenda.</p>
