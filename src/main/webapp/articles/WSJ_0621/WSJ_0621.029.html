	<h3>Fortune Smiles, but Let's Hope They Don't Rename the Town</h3>

	<p class="article-leader">Gold Hill is a tiny town in southwest Oregon that boomed,
then faded, after miners discovered a mother lode of gold in
1860. Now the town has discovered another mother lode, a
treasure-trove that's being mined to defray city expenses.
   For fear of claim jumpers, the site of the new strike is
known to only a handful of city employees. And for good
reason. The stuff is lying in mounds on the floor of a cave
on city property, so intruders could easily make off with
bags full.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Gold Hill is mining bat guano, packaging it in city hall,
and selling eight-ounce bags of the nitrogen-rich manure for
$5 each and one-ounce bags for $1. The deposit was discovered
a month ago by a city employee, and Mayor Jay DeYoe, who has
a reputation for ingenious marketing, soon saw the
possibilities for raising cash for the financially strapped
town.</p>
<p>The proceeds have been modest, about $100 so far. But that
helps pay for four part-time police officers. Demand is
steady for the rich fertilizer, and supply is no problem. "If
we run short at city hall, why we just go back and get a few
buckets more," says Mayor DeYoe.</p>
<p>He's trying to boost sales by attaching a bat logo to each
bag, and the police chief sports a bat on his uniform as
well.</p>
<p>Mining bat guano isn't the mayor's first unusual venture.
He patented "Dirt Bags," oversized plastic river rafts
stuffed with Styrofoam peanuts. Mr. DeYoe says the latest
venture has prompted area residents to start calling him
Mayor Guano. That's an improvement. "I kind of like it," he
says. "They used to call me Dirt."</p>
<p>Every bit of loose change helps in Gold Hill. The gold
mine played out after eight months, and times have been tough
for the past 130 years. The town's only recent new
enterprises have been two blackjack parlors and a topless
bar. Citizens are eagerly awaiting construction of a new bank
because the current one is housed in a mobile home. People
worry "because somebody could back {a car} up to it, hitch it
up and just take it away," says Kathy Caruso, the
receptionist at city hall.</p>
<p>For a town whose mayor sells dirt bags, boasts of a
"vortex" house with a strange magnetic field that makes balls
appear to roll uphill, and town-limit signs that contradict
each other (one says pop. 965 and the other 935), selling bat
guano at city hall doesn't seem out of character.</p>
<p>"Everybody in Gold Hill is kind of strange anyway,"
observes town historian Linda Genaw.</p>
