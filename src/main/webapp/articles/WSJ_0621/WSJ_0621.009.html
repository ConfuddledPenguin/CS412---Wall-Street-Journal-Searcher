	<p class="article-leader">Once upon a time in 1978 there was an orphan called SIF
(Stock Index Future). SIF was in an orphanage, looking for a
home. The director of the orphanage wanted to place SIF in a
home that would promote his welfare.
   In 1978 two sets of prospective parents came to the
orphanage to inquire about the child. One set was well
established, very wealthy and highly respected in their
community. The family name had been admired in major cities
of the world since 1934. Many people thought Mr. and Mrs. SEC
would be ideal parents for the orphan.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>However, Mr. and Mrs. SEC already had many children of
their own and they were concerned that the addition of one
more child might cause jealousy and friction within the
family. This by itself was reasonable enough, but they went
further. They did not want anyone else to adopt SIF. They
told others that the child was no good. They said that SIF
"fail{ed} to satisfy . . . statutory requirements," would
likely be of "limited utility" and could not meet the "heavy
burden of demonstrating an economic purpose." (Letter from
Irving M. Pollack, Commissioner, Securities and Exchange
Commission, to William T. Bagley, Chairman, Commodity Futures
Trading Commission, dated Aug. 21, 1978.) st</p>

<p>The other prospective parents were Mr. and Mrs. CFTC. They
were delighted by the child. Although they were not as well
connected socially as Mr. and Mrs. SEC, nor as wealthy, the
entire family worked very hard at good, honest labor.
Frequently they were employed by American farmers, but some
of their younger children had gone into banking and finance,
where most of the SECs' children were employed. Mr. and Mrs.
CFTC were eager to adopt SIF because they could see that he
would be valuable for "hedging on more than an occasional
basis." They recognized that SIF would be a valuable
complement to the products of one of America's most powerful
firms, Wall Street, Inc.</p>
<p>With Mr. and Mrs. CFTC for parents, SIF grew to be happy
and successful. He moved to the city -- not the same city as
the SECs' home, but a big city nonetheless. The child worked
hard and became accepted by high society and in fact became a
peer or even a rival of some of the SECs' children. Mr. and
Mrs. SEC became jealous and somewhat embarrassed that this
orphan of "limited utility" should compete with their own
beloved darlings. At first they tried to reshape their own
children in a way that could successfully duplicate the
unique attributes of SIF. They tried putting all their
children in a single basket, but that did not work. They
tried other extreme measures, some of which were found to be
illegal.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>Ultimately, Mr. and Mrs. SEC decided that if the child was
determined to thrive in their society, they must adopt him
for themselves. Supported and even urged on by Wall Street,
they returned to the orphanage and demanded custody of the
child. They said the interest of the child, and society in
general, would be better served if the original adoption were
reversed and SIF were to live out the rest of his life in the
SEC family.</p>
<p>Mr. and Mrs. CFTC could not understand the SECs' pique
over the success of SIF. After all, the SECs' children had
done quite well since SIF was adopted (although they had had
some ups and downs). Nor could they understand Wall Street's
pique, since its stock had tripled in value since the
adoption of SIF.</p>
<p>But the SECs continued to lobby the orphanage director.
"We can offer him wonderful advantages and bring harmony to
his life," they said. "We never really meant those silly
things we said in 1978, and will agree to continue to raise
him in exactly the same way the CFTCs have raised him. It
won't be hard to do since the CFTCs have produced a child
care manual and we will follow it carefully. Furthermore,
once the adoption is complete, we are sure others in his
family will want to join him. For several years now we have
had our eyes on his sister, T-Bond Future."</p>
