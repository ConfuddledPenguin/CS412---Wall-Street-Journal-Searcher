	<p class="article-leader">TOKYO -- Because of a drop in tax revenue from financial
concerns, the Finance Ministry issued 208.5 billion yen
($1.35 billion) of deficit-financing bonds to its trust fund
bureau for the past fiscal year, ministry officials said.
   An official familiar with the ministry's debt issuing
plans said these were the only deficit financing bonds issued
for fiscal 1989, which ended March 31. The ministry was
originally budgeted to issue 1.331 trillion yen of
deficit-financing bonds, but that was reduced to 681 billion
yen in the revised budget.</p>
