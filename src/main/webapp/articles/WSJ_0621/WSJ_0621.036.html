	<p class="article-leader">STURM, RUGER & Co.'s secondary offering of 1,830,000
shares was priced at $25 a share and sold out. The New
York-based firearms maker registered the offering with the
Securities and Exchange Commission two weeks ago. On the day
the offering was announced, the shares closed at $23.50; they
have since rebounded, and closed in New York Stock Exchange
composite trading yesterday at $25.625, up 25 cents, on
volume of 543,400 shares. As expected, the stock was offered
by four shareholders, who will receive all the proceeds;
these holders include Chairman William B. Ruger Sr., who sold
one million shares. The underwriters, led by Kidder, Peabody
& Co., had an option on 274,500 additional shares to cover
overallotments. In January, with its stock price around $28,
Sturm Ruger registered 1,850,000 shares, with the offering to
be underwritten by Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. On March 8,
with the shares at about $24.50, the company withdrew the
offering, saying the stock price was too low.</p>
