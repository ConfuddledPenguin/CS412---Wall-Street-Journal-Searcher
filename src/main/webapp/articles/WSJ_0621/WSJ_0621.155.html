	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- A federal grand jury indicted a
gasoline-distribution unit of Getty Petroleum Corp. and one
of the unit's executives for tax evasion and conspiracy.
   Getty Petroleum, a Jericho, N.Y., independent gasoline
marketer, said Tuesday that the office of U.S. Attorney
Andrew Maloney in Brooklyn had notified the company that it
was seeking the indictment.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The four-count indictment names as defendants Getty
Terminals Corp. and William Rea, manager of the unit's Supply
and Trading department, primarily responsible for gasoline
sales.</p>
<p>Also charged were John Pabone, president and owner of J&J
Petroleum Inc., a Staten Island, N.Y., gasoline distributor;
and John Quock, president and owner of Tun Yung Oil Corp. and
Westwind Petroleum Inc., both New York gasoline distributors.</p>
<p>A separate indictment issued yesterday charges two
brothers, Richard and Robert Kennon, with filing false
excise-tax returns and conspiracy. The Kennons are owners
and, respectively, president and vice president of three
gasoline companies: Jenny Oil Corp., Pelham, N.Y., and Oil
City Enterprises Inc. and Mount Vernon Energy Terminals Inc.,
both in Mount Vernon, N.Y.</p>
<p>The indictments are part of what the Justice Department
called a continuing "multi-agency investigation into an
estimated $1 billion annual nationwide loss" of federal
gasoline and diesel excise taxes because of fraud in gasoline
wholesaling.</p>
<p>Getty Terminals said it is "outraged" about the
indictment, which charges it with evading $946,000 of taxes
in 1985. The charges are "completely baseless," the company
said, and it plans a vigorous defense for itself and Mr. Rea,
who couldn't be reached for comment.</p>
<p>Messrs. Quock, Pabone and Kennon couldn't be reached.</p>
