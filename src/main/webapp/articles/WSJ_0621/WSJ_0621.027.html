	<p class="article-leader">SOUTHFIELD, Mich. -- What happens to a financial-services
company that posts six straight years of record earnings
while maintaining a conservative lending approach?
   If the company is part of Chrysler Corp., it gets thrashed
by credit-rating services and finds its access to key credit
markets for raising cash diminished.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Last week, Standard & Poor's Corp. cited long-term
uncertainties in Chrysler's automotive business when it
downgraded the company's credit rating to triple-B-minus, one
notch above speculative grade. Moody's Investors Service Inc.
said it also may downgrade Chrysler debt because of similar
automotive concerns.</p>
<p>But Chrysler Financial Corp. will suffer the most from the
ratings change, even though it has had a standout record in
recent years, and will be a far larger profit center for
Chrysler this year than car and truck manufacturing.</p>
<p>"This downgrading means our borrowing costs are higher and
our profits will be lower," says John P. Tierney, chairman of
Chrysler Financial. Already, his company has had to dip into
about $12 billion in standby bank credit, a more costly
source of funds that was previously arranged to cover just
such an emergency as this.</p>
<p>Still, Mr. Tierney is projecting record earnings for the
second quarter (partly because the downgrading occurred too
late to have much impact) and "a very good third quarter."</p>
<p>During its six straight record years, Chrysler Financial's
earnings surged nearly fourfold largely because the auto
maker diversified the unit into businesses besides making
loans to car buyers and dealers.</p>
<p>Because of that push, Chrysler Financial now gets 44% of
its results from operations that have nothing to do with
Chrysler or the auto industry, including mergers financing
and rail-car leasing. Meanwhile, its earnings have steadily
climbed the past four years while earnings from the finance
arms of General Motors Corp. and Ford Motor Co. have slipped.
One reason is that Chrysler Financial has kept a more
conservative approach to its consumer auto lending. At the
end of March, 0.69% of Chrysler Financial retail auto loans
were delinquent compared with a 2.06% industry average rate.</p>
<p>What's more, last year Chrysler Financial's net income of
$284 million accounted for nearly 80% of Chrysler's overall
earnings. The results, contends Mr. Tierney, suggest that
Chrysler Financial didn't deserve a lower credit rating.</p>
<p>S&P, though, reasoned differently. It acknowledged that
Chrysler Financial's "performance has been very good and its
asset quality remains sound." But S&P added: "The credit
quality of Chrysler Financial is ultimately a function of its
parent company." Thus, besides lowering Chrysler's long-term
debt rating, S&P lowered its rating on Chrysler Financial's
$7.5 billion of commercial paper to the bottom of the scale:
single-A-3 from single-A-2.</p>
<p>Commercial paper, essentially an unsecured corporate IOU,
is crucial to Chrysler Financial. Unlike a bank, the company
doesn't get deposits. So it raises money by selling debt, and
then turns around and lends the money to buyers of Chrysler
vehicles, to Chrysler dealers and to a range of other
business borrowers.</p>
<p>For Chrysler Financial, having its credit rating dropped
just one notch was critical. Investors who buy commercial
paper are jittery these days about the quality of debt that
far down on the rating scale. And many money-market mutual
funds are restricted from buying any commercial paper rated
that low.</p>
<p>As a result, the market for Chrysler Financial commercial
paper is now merely one-tenth as large as before the rating
change, says Mr. Tierney. Thus Chrysler Financial has turned
to more expensive sources of funds.</p>
<p>A typical interest rate on the standby bank credit,
Chrysler Financial says, will run about 8.45% compared with
the 8.30% it paid on commercial paper borrowings. "That may
not seem like the world's biggest difference," Mr. Tierney
says. "But it quickly adds up to make a difference."</p>
<p>The company also had to pay higher rates on $300 million
of two-year notes sold to the public just after the ratings
action. And $100 million in Chrysler Financial notes that
Shearson Lehman Hutton planned to sell to its retail
customers was held up because of the debt-rating cloud.</p>
<p>Chrysler Financial is trying to cope in other ways. For
instance, it is packaging more auto loans to consumers and
wholesale loans to dealers for resale on securities markets.
That way, the company can reduce its reliance on commercial
paper debt. So far this year, Chrysler Financial has sold
$5.4 billion of the loan receivables compared with $4.8
billion for all of last year.</p>
<p>Despite the scrambling for new sources of funds, Mr.
Tierney says Chrysler Financial hasn't faced a liquidity
problem. Fitch Investors Service Inc. agrees. On Tuesday, the
debt-rating agency stated that with the "combination of bank
borrowings, asset-backed securities sales and continued
rollover of maturing commercial paper . . . Chrysler
Financial shouldn't face a liquidity crisis." Nonetheless,
Fitch placed Chrysler Financial's long-term debt on watch
status.</p>
<p>"It's a real dilemma they face and it's an unfair one,"
says Harald Gundersen, portfolio manager with Ivy Money
Market Fund in Hingham, Mass. Referring to the parent
company, which is beset by sagging earnings and slumping
market share, Mr. Gundersen adds: "It is like guilt by
association."</p>
