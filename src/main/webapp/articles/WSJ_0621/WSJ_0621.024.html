	<p class="article-leader">Ask the typical small-business owner about getting away
for a vacation, and you'll get a laugh -- or a sob.
   "Taking a vacation is a small nightmare," says Deborah
Krabacher, a shopkeeper in Grand Junction, Colo. The first
time she slipped away for two weeks, she sought to assure
customers she hadn't closed for good. She left a sign on the
door and ran radio ads with the message: "See you in two
weeks."</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>But her strategy backfired. While she vacationed in the
Yucatan, her shop was burglarized. Police weren't
sympathetic; they scolded her for publicizing her absence.
Now when she takes off, a part-timer keeps her shop open, and
she also relies on a security system tied into the police
station.</p>
<p>Many small-business owners don't take a vacation at all
because it seems such an ordeal. They fear their customers
will evaporate. They're reluctant to trust someone else to
fill in. They convince themselves they're indispensable.</p>
<p>Small-business owners "always find excuses not to take
vacations -- or, at the last minute, to truncate them," says
John L. Ward, professor of private enterprise at Loyola
University in Chicago.</p>
<p>Blame the psychic makeup of the typical small-business
owner for that, says Kenneth Kaye, a Chicago psychologist who
counsels family businesses. Individuals attracted to the
long, hard hours that business ownership entails tend to be
anxiety-driven, he notes. They seek to escape that anxiety by
immersing their minds in the minutiae of running a business.
And, he says, they resist taking a break for fear their
anxiety will return.</p>
<p>But keeping one's nose to the grindstone can hurt the
business. The prolonged stress of fighting distraction,
focusing intensely on dull details and working at protracted
tasks fatigues the mind, says Stephen Kaplan, a University of
Michigan psychologist. The result: a rise in errors, troubles
handling the public, more accidents, and declining
workmanship.</p>
<p>Jim Stewart, an owner of Stewart-Cooper-Architects, in
Gastonia, N.C., says he works at least 60 hours a week, takes
a rare three-day weekend, and sometimes feels like "a large
raw nerve." "Your morale drops," he says. "You wonder, `What
am I doing?' `I've been doing this for 20 years?'"</p>
<p>Still, Mr. Stewart can't stop. He's convinced it would
take him a month to unwind completely, and he doesn't buy the
idea that his business would run fine without him. So he
keeps going, even when his overloaded brain causes him to
miss appointments. Last year, he forgot to attend a
ground-breaking ceremony for a church he designed -- and
congregation members have teased him about it since.</p>
<p>Spouses of workaholic entrepreneurs must use ingenuity to
pry their mates away for a spell. Mr. Ward says some spouses
pre-pay for vacations that carry hefty penalties if canceled.
Since small-business owners typically hate to waste money,
they often feel compelled to go. (Even if they forfeit the
money for themselves, their spouses usually go anyway, he
says.)</p>
<p>Frequently, though, it takes something extraordinary -- a
heart attack or illness -- to persuade a business owner to
let loose. Last year, Patricia Kavoura, owner of Labyrinth, a
clothing store in Mystic, Conn., was laid up for two months
after fracturing her ankle in an auto accident. She had been
used to working seven days a week, with no vacation.</p>
<p>That enforced vacation, she says, helped her realize the
store could function without her. She delegated merchandising
tasks, such as making displays, by hiring a once-a-week
contractor. When she returned, "I felt rejuvenated. I was
nicer to people," she says. She has retained the contractor,
trimmed a day or two off her workweek, and now tries to take
a week or so off several times a year.</p>
<p>Yet, to some small-business owners, even a day away may
seem too costly. Lynn and Doug Kowaleski, who own BelAir
Colonial Funeral Home in Madras, Ore., can go for weeks in
their business without getting a call to handle a death. But
missing just one call can mean lost revenues averaging $1,780
that could go to their more entrenched local competitor.</p>
<p>So, the Kowaleskis consider themselves on call 24 hours a
day, year-round. If they get away for a day, they switch
their calls to a funeral home in another town, keep in touch
by a CB radio, and rush back whenever a call comes in. Ms.
Kowaleski admits that funeral work is "a real burnout --
stressful kind of business," but adds that "people are
depending on {us}."</p>
<p>Operating cycles in a small business can also complicate
vacation plans. Rick Sheridan, who runs a neon lighting
company in his Des Moines, Iowa, home, often gets a contract
at the last minute that forces him to stick around while his
wife, a travel agency manager, goes ahead with their
pre-booked vacation. This year, he expects to complete a
large installation at a local hotel in time for a three-day
jaunt with his wife to Las Vegas.</p>
<p>But the project required him to pour all his capital into
it. He won't be paid until after the couple returns from
vacation, so he must borrow $1,000 for spending money.</p>
<p>To some small-business owners, any time away is better
than nothing. Lee Hubert and her husband have taken little
time off in the 16 years they've run Ted's Electric, a motor
sales-and-repair shop in Chico, Calif. But, married for 35
years, she knows that when her husband smokes more than
usual, he's due for a respite. She urges him to go off with a
buddy on one of their occasional one-day gambling trips to
Reno. He takes $50 with him, blows it, and relaxes by telling
her all about it when he gets back.</p>
<p>Ms. Hubert herself hasn't been away long by herself,
except to visit ailing relatives. But she vows within five
years to take her dream vacation: two weeks in New Orleans,
with paddle-wheeler rides and plantation tours.</p>
<p>Enduring the small-business grind with no letup clearly
isn't for everybody. Reza Manafi bought a Subway Sandwiches
franchise in Albany, Calif., four years ago, expecting to
open five more within two years, hire people to run them,
then take it easy.</p>
<p>But he found that operating one outlet sapped his energy.
He hasn't expanded, and he claims he can't find enough
reliable help to get away for more than 72 hours.</p>
<p>"It's just work, work, work and no play," he says, "and I
don't like it." He's put his franchise up for sale.</p>
