	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Nobody got richer in a gold rush, the old saw
had it, than the guy selling shovels, and that also used to
be the case on the New York Stock Exchange.
   When stock prices soared in 1987, the price of a seat on
the Big Board also rose to a record, with one seat changing
hands at $1,150,000 -- triple its price of two years earlier.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Stock prices again are close to record highs, but the
stock of the exchange itself, as measured by the most recent
seat sale price of $430,000, is languishing.</p>
<p>To put things in perspective, it now costs 42% more to get
into the business of flipping hamburgers at McDonald's, which
charges $610,000 for a new franchise, than it does to buy a
seat on the country's premier stock exchange.</p>
<p>"{The exchange} had a terrific franchise for years, but
{now} you have tremendous structural changes taking place,"
says George Bodine, managing director and head of stock
trading at Equitable Capital. "You're seeing more
fragmentation of the market. You're seeing more indexers
trying their utmost to reduce costs and transact
electronically."</p>
<p>The price of a seat, like the price of a restaurant or any
other franchise, reflects its present and anticipated future
earning power. And the earning power of a seat is suffering.</p>
<p>The 1,366 Big Board seats, in essence, convey a franchise
to buy and sell listed stocks on the exchange floor and to
charge a small commission to those who don't have access.
Seats are owned by brokerage firms, independent floor brokers
and the so-called specialists who each make a market in
certain assigned stocks.</p>
<p>But institutions such as Equitable increasingly buy and
sell Big Board-listed stocks in so-called third and fourth
markets that circumvent the stock exchange. These include
Jefferies Group's Posit, a highly automated system that
trades baskets of stocks off the exchange; Instinet, an
electronic order matching system owned by Reuters Holdings;
and over-the-counter brokers such as Jefferies and Bernard L.
Madoff Investment Securities. Jefferies and Madoff perform
much the same function as Big Board members -- except that
neither belongs to the exchange.</p>
<p>Thus, not only is the Big Board's volume down, but in the
first quarter of 1990, only 68% of all transactions in Big
Board-listed stocks were actually conducted on the exchange.
That was down from 85% in 1980 (though the Big Board still
handled last quarter more than 80% of the total shares traded
in its own stocks).</p>
<p>One day this week, for example, First Boston Corp. traded
nearly one million shares of Big Board stocks with 12
different customers in London before the New York market
opened.</p>
<p>In addition, commissions are far lower than they were
before deregulation. And with the rise of passive, or
index-oriented investing, the pressure is on for lower
commissions still.</p>
<p>"The claim of indexers is that you're buying a commodity
and that you should pay a commodity rate," says Austin
George, head of equities at T. Rowe Price Associates.</p>
<p>A traditional "limit order," or an order to buy stock at a
specific price, is handled manually and entails a big
commission. But such orders are on the wane. Passive
investors increasingly are buying stock over the Big Board's
automated order system known as DOT, which can handle baskets
of stocks at lower commissions. Or, they are buying a
surrogate of the stock market in the form of Standard &
Poor's 500-stock index futures, which trade on the Chicago
Mercantile Exchange. A seat on the Merc sold for $485,000
yesterday.</p>
<p>In addition, brokerage firms, themselves under pressure to
cut costs, are squeezing independent floor brokers to charge
less for handling trades. For all of these reasons, owning a
seat is less lucrative than in the past.</p>
<p>"The correlation between the market itself and seat prices
has broken down," says John Burke, an independent floor
broker or "two-dollar broker," as they are known in the
trade. "Guys on the floor have been under increasing pressure
to decrease what they charge. You have anemic volume and you
have a lot of trading" of Big Board stocks off the exchange.</p>
<p>"If a two-dollar broker leases a seat," he adds, "he has
to make about $200,000 a year in gross to afford the lease
and expenses. The average commission has gotten to a level
where it's unprofitable" for some brokers.</p>
<p>Although stock exchange spokesmen declined to comment for
this article, the exchange is clearly aware that their
franchise is under attack. Recently the Big Board unveiled
plans to introduce afterhours and, ultimately, 24 hour-a-day
trading.</p>
<p>The notion that the exchange might succumb to an
electronic "black box" isn't new. Donald Stone, senior
partner in the specialist firm Lasker, Stone & Stern and a
vice chairman of the exchange, says that when he hears talk
about the demise of the exchange and of specialists he feels
"like Tom Sawyer attending his own funeral."</p>
<p>"I am still here," he notes. "I firmly believe that common
stocks are the investment of the future; the majority of
companies that went private in leveraged buy-outs will become
public again by re-selling stock." Mr. Stone's firm owns 8
seats.</p>
<p>Another specialist, James Maguire, chairman of Henderson
Brothers Inc., says, "I am very bullish on seats." Henderson
Brothers recently bought an additional seat, taking their
total to 19. Like Mr. Stone, Mr. Maguire thinks that there
will be a boom in stock issuance in the 1990s and that the
resulting trades should spur "new highs in seat prices."</p>
<p>Seats have in fact moved up from a five-year low in
February of $351,000. And at least in theory, the rental
market suggests that seats are a bargain. Investors can lease
a seat to a user, such as a floor broker, for about $80,000 a
year; at today's seat price, that amounts to a hefty annual
yield of 19%. But high yields often signal uncertain futures
-- and few bodies have a murkier future than the Big Board.</p>
<p>"What is the value of a seat? You don't know what kind of
exchange will be there {in the future}," says the head of
equities at one Wall Street firm.</p>
<p>The number of companies listed on the Big Board continues
to climb, rising to a record 1,721 in 1990, including some
newly listed high-profile stocks such as L.A. Gear. However,
overall volume this year, about 157 million shares a day, is
running about 17% below its 1987 peak.</p>
<p>The Big Board's appeal is that, by matching the greatest
number of buyers and sellers, it can set prices efficiently.
Typically, orders are routed to a specialist's post; when
buyers of a stock outnumber sellers, or vice versa,
specialists step in to buy or sell stock, easing the
imbalance. But as commissions have fallen, specialists'
profits have dropped. As a result, investors say specialists
have become less willing to take risks.</p>
<p>"The liquidity is gone and isn't going to come back," says
Fred Moran, a portfolio manager. He says he's particularly
incensed by one specialist because "if you go to this guy
with 5,000 shares," he'll declare an order imbalance and halt
the stock. Mr. Moran, who began his career with Goldman
Sachs, says that in the past "we were willing to take a hit
when commissions were 25 to 30 cents. At six cents a share
who wants to put capital on the line?"</p>
<p>Mr. Bodine, of Equitable, says that "if there are two or
three buyers on the floor and I would be the fourth buyer, it
may be to my advantage if I can get the merchandise via
another source." Commissions in off-exchange trades generally
are lower.</p>
<p>Even the exchange's proposal to expand into night trading
dilutes the value of a seat, some say, because the plan calls
for electronic trading, which would circumvent the
specialists. In effect, the afterhours exchange would become
one more competitor to the traditional, daytime Big Board.</p>
<p>In fact, some say the very notion of a franchise in an
electronic market is anachronistic. Junius W. Peake, chairman
of the Peake/Ryerson Consulting Group, says exchanges
"shouldn't be clubs" with members, but public utilities that
grant wide access.</p>
<p>"When the exchange talks about the possibility of an
electronic system, the value of a seat for a specialist or
anyone else goes way down," says a senior official at one
member firm. He adds: "I don't know that there's much
possibility for a rebound with all this volume moving off the
exchange."</p>
