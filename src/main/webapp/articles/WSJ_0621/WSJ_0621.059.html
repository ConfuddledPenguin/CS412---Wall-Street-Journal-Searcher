	<p class="article-leader">ATLANTA -- A former vendor for a Southern Co. unit who
made illegal political contributions on behalf of the
electric utility pleaded guilty to filing a false corporate
tax return.
   Fred Suttles Jr., president of Outdoor Media Inc., entered
the guilty plea in federal court here and agreed to cooperate
with a continuing federal investigation of the affair.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Outdoor Media, a Pensacola, Fla.-based outdoor advertising
firm, rented billboard space to the Gulf Power Co. unit of
Southern. According to court papers, Mr. Suttles directed his
employees and several of his vendors to contribute $40,550 to
more than a dozen state and local political candidates
designated by Gulf; he then reimbursed the workers and
vendors. The income-tax charge relates to his listing those
reimbursements as legitimate business expenses.</p>
<p>Court papers filed by the Internal Revenue Service said
Mr. Suttles agreed to the scheme to get Gulf advertising
contracts. The papers said Jacob F. "Jake" Horton, a former
senior vice president of Gulf, asked for the contributions.
Mr. Horton was killed in April 1989 in a corporate plane
crash, the cause of which has yet to be determined.</p>
<p>The scheme was intended to circumvent federal law, which
prohibits utility holding companies, such as Southern, from
making political contributions.</p>
<p>Mr. Suttles, who couldn't be reached for comment, faces up
to three years in prison and a $250,000 fine. His plea isn't
apt to affect Gulf Power, which itself pleaded guilty last
fall to two felonies -- conspiracy to make illegal political
contributions and conspiracy to defraud the U.S. of income
taxes. Gulf Power paid a $500,000 fine.</p>
<p>However, an IRS probe of individuals involved in the
scheme continues, and further charges are anticipated, those
familiar with the investigation said.</p>
