	<p class="article-leader">MOSCOW -- Mr. Gorbachev returned from his North American
tour, if not triumphant, at least with a fair amount of
success, to face his kitchen problems: how to feed the
people, how to fight inflation, how to deal with all sorts of
opposition, and not least, how to come to terms with Boris
Yeltsin, who had just acquired new power as leader of the
Russian Republic.
   Even before Mr. Gorbachev left for America, Prime Minister
Nikolai Ryzhkov had to confront a hostile Supreme Soviet when
he submitted his plans for market-type economic reforms. The
population reacted feverishly to the prospect of the doubling
of food prices and considerable rises in other prices and
tariffs. Is it not a strange "market" where the government
declares that it intends to raise meat prices exactly 2.3
times and fish prices 2.5 times? The immediate effect was
catastrophic. There was panic and a run on the shops,
particularly in Moscow, where no rationing had been
introduced before (most big Soviet cities have been using
some form of rationing for months or years).</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Longer-term results are the progressive deterioration of
the national distribution channels and the spreading of
economic (and political) separatism. Parliaments in Ukraine
and Byelorussia have adopted resolutions requiring their
explicit agreement to any rise in prices. Moscow felt
compelled to introduce defensive measures preventing
residents of nearby areas from shopping in the capital. Now
the Moscow authorities are trying to set up some form of
special trade area with the regions of Central Russia. The
new radical mayor of Leningrad, law professor Anatoly
Sobchak, is talking about special arrangements with the
Baltic republics, which are formulating plans to introduce
their own local currencies.</p>
<p>Two elements of the former political and economic
structure created by Stalinist and post-Stalinist regimes are
making their devastating effects felt. One is totalitarian
centralization, with the lack of any clear-cut and
democratically accepted division of jurisdictions among the
Union government, the constituent republics and the local
authorities. The other is uncertainty over property rights,
with everything belonging to the state and without specific,
responsible owners of the "socialist," or "people's,"
property.</p>
<p>These create a source of conflict among different tiers of
authority, and between central agencies running enterprises
and the newly elected local soviets. A specific problem is
the property of the Communist Party: In the Baltic republics
it is contested by opposing party factions; in many other
areas people have started to grumble about the legality of
this huge wealth. The issue seems to have precipitated an
open conflict between the Leningrad party and the local
soviet's authorities.</p>
<p>As usual, the government program of marketization has been
severely criticized both from the right and from the left.
Critics from both camps, meanwhile, are trying to exploit
popular discontent and fears of more inflation and
unemployment. Together they have managed to run down the
central government's rating in popular polls to the lowest
level ever recorded.</p>
<p>The criticism of the program is well-founded. Much of it
looks half-hearted and irresolute. Take the all-important
problem of private property and entrepreneurship. The program
contains references to privatization of some branches of the
economy: A considerable part of small- and even medium-size
enterprises in trade, services and public catering are
intended to be leased or sold to individual or family owners.
Another source of private capital is to be provided by a more
extensive effort to attract foreign capital.</p>
<p>On the other hand, consider this quote from an interview
with the architect of the reform, Leonid Abalkin: "We are
against the development of private property with the use of
hired labor. This is unacceptable and incompatible with the
socialist choice made by this country."</p>
<p>This statement is in flagrant conflict both with the
program itself and with evolving public sentiment. How can a
growing and successful enterprise be run without hired labor?
If it is not allowed to hire hands it is doomed to
stagnation. Another strong deterrent to entrepreneurship will
be the new tax law, which raises the highest personal income
tax rate to 60% from 13%.</p>
<p>After a few stormy sessions, the Supreme Soviet closed its
doors for a summer recess, leaving behind a toothless and
indefinite resolution on the switch to a "regulated market."
To be sure, it accepted the principle of markets. But it sent
the measure back to the government with restrictions and
qualifications, and then relegated the whole problem for
consideration by about three dozen members of the parliaments
of constitutent and autonomous republics. As a report in
Izvestia put it: "Only a blind person will not notice that
this document abounds in contradictions and wishfulness."</p>
<p>Any steps toward a market economy are being postponed at
least until autumn, or more probably, until next year.
Meanwhile, with strictly controlled and administratively
fixed prices, the last remnants of the legitimate
distribution sector, both wholesale and retail, are
disappearing. In their place, gray and black markets are
growing.</p>
<p>Optimists would say, nevertheless, that the Supreme Soviet
economic program is a breakthrough to some new and rational
economic structure. Pessimists would reply that the decision
pays only lip service to that aim. That brings to mind a
saying: Pessimists are nothing but well-informed optimists.
The best we can do is hope that this saying is not applicable
in this particular case.</p>
