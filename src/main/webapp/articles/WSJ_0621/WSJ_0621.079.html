	<p class="article-leader">BOULDER, Colo. -- Daisy Systems Corp. edged closer to
bankruptcy court proceedings, acknowledging a breakdown in
negotiations with bondholders and a secured creditor over its
default on $118 million in debt.
   The company also said that Heller Financial, its secured
lender, has notified Daisy that it will not extend a
"standstill agreement" that ended June 15 and will not
guarantee its purchase of workstations from Sun Microsystems
Inc.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The announcement apparently clears the way for a June 26
court hearing on a petition for involuntary bankruptcy, filed
by Daisy's bondholders May 30. The maker of computer-aided
engineering stations has missed interest payments since
November.</p>
<p>According to a company spokesman, Daisy's cash shortage is
severe enough to prevent its customary purchase of Sun
Microsystem workstations. As a result, domestic shipments of
its products in the third quarter, ending June 30, "will be
significantly less" than in the quarter ended March 31. The
second quarter saw a slump in revenue to $33 million, from
$47.2 million a year earlier.</p>
<p>Daisy's troubles began with its optimistic $200 million
acquisition of Cadnetix Corp. at the end of 1988, but
disappointing sales have left it unable to service its debt.
Although the company spokesman said Daisy is seeking
third-party funds, he acknowledged that company officials are
not optimistic and that failure to find help soon means Daisy
"will be unable to continue normal operations."</p>
