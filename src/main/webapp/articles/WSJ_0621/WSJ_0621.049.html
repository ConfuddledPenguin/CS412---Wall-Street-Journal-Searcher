	<p class="article-leader">There are probably a few politicians in Washington who are
seriously and unreservedly in favor of amending the Bill of
Rights each time some transient threat arises. Sen. Jesse
Helms comes immediately to mind. There is undoubtedly a
slightly larger clutch of office-holders who have convinced
themselves that two or three dedicated flag-burners (or two
or three hundred for that matter) pose a threat to the nation
so great, a challenge to the nation's sense of itself so
impudently presumptuous, that qualifications should be
attached to the First Amendment's guarantee of free speech
and expression.
   But the number of congressmen, Democrat and Republican,
who honestly believe flag-burning is a clear and present
danger to the Republic is as small proportionately as the
number of exhibitionists champing to torch Old Glory. The
vast majority backing the amendment are cynical partisans,
cowards, summer soldiers or timeservers without a conviction
more meaningful than the need for self-protection.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Watching the news or reading the papers, it is
occasionally difficult to hold down the food. When a
politician in a leadership role like House GOP whip Newt
Gingrich contemptuously refers to the "five lawyers" on the
Supreme Court who struck down the flag-burning law, it's easy
to believe the clock has been turned back 36 years. Then,
another Supreme Court overturned precedent and ruled
"separate but equal" schools unconstitutional, and another
group of barking political jackals declared war on the court.
The late Sen. James Eastland of Mississippi, the
segregationist champion, was no less cynical than Rep.
Gingrich is today telling cheering crowds they had a "sacred
duty" to defy the court. And all those Southern politicians
who declared eternal resistance to the decision invoked
majority opinion as their sacred god no less than those who
now push for a constitutional amendment to save the nation
from itself.</p>
<p>There is something else worth noting in comparing the
blatant hypocrisy of the never-never segregationists of the
1950s and 1960s and the flag-savers today. High in the ranks
of today's Capitol Hill patriots are men who were ardent
defenders of sedition and silent supporters of insurrection
only yesterday. Among them are men who implicitly stood on
the side of the mobs when federal force was required to give
life to the principle of equal justice before the law
regardless of race. To watch them speaking grandiloquently of
the need to protect the symbol of the nation is to realize
there are people without shame.</p>
<p>For some time it has been hard to remain silent when
encountering some of those sporting American flag lapel pins.
I remember when their public commitment to that symbol of
American unity might have been meaningful, but was
conspicuously absent. In the early and mid-1960s, those who
flew the American flag or otherwise displayed it in many
parts of the Deep South were perceived as enemies of "our way
of life." During that terrible last convulsion of the old
racist order, when the Eastlands, Wallaces and Barnetts were
calling the Southern shots -- and a number of today's
all-American political heroes were their aides -- everything
the American flag represented was fair game.</p>
<p>That was a time of real crisis, when basic American values
were at stake and everyone had to decide what mattered and
what did not. To put it bluntly, some now leading the charge
for protecting the flag were among those desecrating it by
their actions and attitudes then. There is no need to list
names, though each knows his own and I would provide them for
those who ask. The point is, the bedrock meaning of the
nation and its future direction were being determined in
those days, and the side those politicians chose was
contemptible in goal and vicious in method" -- un-American"
in word and deed, to use one of their favorite phrases.</p>
<p>Such men are but a tiny minority of those who now clamor
to head the list of those who would torch the Bill of Rights
to save its symbol. The vast majority supporting a
constitutional amendment to prohibit flag-desecration are
opportunists above all else. They've read the polls and know
their duty -- join the lemmings' rush. At root, that is also
"un-American." Ours is not a plebiscitory democracy where
issues are instantaneously decided by moving majorities, but
a representative government in which those we elect are
supposed to represent principle and thought as well as
today's popular opinion.</p>
<p>Put the president at the head of those who should know
better, and he probably does. He knows the televised images
of flag-burning are gross distortions. He knows those who
burn the flag are at least as cynically manipulative as those
who would profit politically from their symbolic games.
George Bush knows that in the real world of tough issues,
flag-burning is not in the top 100, let alone the top 10.
Unfortunately, he also knows a free ride when he sees one,
and he is incapable of passing one up no matter how
demeaning.</p>
<p>It is good to see the Democratic leadership in both houses
come out forthrightly against the amendment. It is depressing
to realize this is not an issue on which heavy chits are
being called, as witness the decisions of such orthodox
Democrats as Sen. Max Baucus of Montana and Rep. Tom McMillan
to support the amendment. There is too much sympathy among
many Democrats about the understandable need for this
congressman or that senator to take a walk on the issue, lest
he be bludgeoned into political oblivion. Utterly amoral
political consultants are quoted regularly about the issue's
potency, or at least its potential impact, and those
quotations become justification enough for cowardice.</p>
<p>It's the wrong time for the politics of expediency. Just
as the Constitution itself has been preserved because of its
resilience, the Bill of Rights has been preserved because of
its enduring integrity. When you are dealing with something
this fundamental, you cannot take risks. Chop away a little
in the name of the flag today; chop away a little more
tomorrow in the name of public morals; undercut it further on
the day after in the name of crime in the streets. It is at
exactly the moment that a majority is most intent on tearing
away the protections that have preserved liberty that those
who know better must stand up and say "no]"</p>
<p>There is no free pass on this one. Preserving the Bill of
Rights is not a minor matter. Politicians who stress the need
to save themselves to fight the good fight in the future are
kidding themselves and the public. There will be no better
fight, not because the proposed amendment is particularly
meaningful in itself, but because the precedent would be so
horrific.</p>
<p>A little more than 30 years ago, all but a handful of
Southern congressmen signed "The Southern Manifesto,"
repudiating the Supreme Court's desegregation decision and
endorsing resistance to it. Among them were men sickened by
what they were doing but convinced they had to stay in office
for the sake of a larger good. But not one ever again found
himself capable of breaking with the monolithic
segregationist front when it mattered. So it is likely to be
for those who know better but reluctantly go along with the
flag-burning amendment. Saying yes to this one, they will
find it even harder to say no to the next ones sure to come
if it is ratified.</p>
