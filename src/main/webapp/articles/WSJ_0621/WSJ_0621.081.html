	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- The National Association of Securities
Dealers, in a move cheered by shareholder groups, said it
plans to introduce a "one-share, one-vote" rule similar to
that recently struck down by a federal appeals court panel.
   In an interview, NASD President Joseph Hardiman said the
group is eager to maintain the rule despite last week's
appeals court decision that the Securities and Exchange
Commission had overstepped its authority in adopting the
rule. He said he expects to present "reasonably promptly" a
proposal to the NASD advisory board and board of governors.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The move comes at a time when many on Wall Street expected
the court ruling to reignite a battle among U.S. exchanges to
lure companies to list shares. Exchanges could use relaxed
listing requirements as incentives to companies concerned
about hostile takeovers.</p>
<p>But Mr. Hardiman said the NASD "is not going to trigger a
race to the bottom" in listing standards. "We will abide by
19c4 {the one-share, one-vote rule} as long as it is in
effect, and if appeals fail we hope to adopt a similar rule,"
he said.</p>
<p>Mr. Hardiman said that part of the reason behind the move
is an agreement that the NASD has with states that allows the
over-the-counter market exemptions from state securities
laws. If the NASD adopts rules of corporate governance that
are more lenient than those of the exchanges, he said, NASD
dealers will fall under tougher scrutiny from state
regulators.</p>
<p>Mr. Hardiman quickly added, however, that his stance "has
to be tempered by what the competition is doing." The New
York Stock Exchange adopted its own version of one-share,
one-vote after the SEC rule went into effect, but the
American Stock Exchange and Nasdaq didn't.</p>
<p>Amex Chairman James Jones said the exchange is still
studying the court's decision. He added, "But the fact that
we haven't made a decision doesn't mean one thing either
way."</p>
<p>A Big Board spokeswoman said: "We don't see things
changing immediately. We don't see many companies that would
want to do anything with their corporate structure that would
fall under the 19c4 rule. If they do, we would review the
rules as the situation arises."</p>
<p>An SEC spokeswoman said the agency is "pleased" with the
NASD's action but declined to comment further. She said the
agency hadn't yet decided whether to appeal the court's
decision.</p>
<p>The SEC's rule prohibited already traded companies from
issuing a class of common stock with lesser voting rights.
That practice had become common in the mid-1980s as a
takeover defense. But the SEC's rule was challenged by the
Business Roundtable, a trade group of large companies, which
argued that the federal rule overstepped the traditional
rights of states in corporate governance. The appeals court
agreed.</p>
<p>The SEC rule never precluded public offerings from having
two classes, because shareholders buying into those offerings
would know of the limited voting rights. The agency's
argument for 19c4 was that holders shouldn't have rights
taken away when they bought the stock under other conditions.</p>
<p>The NASD plan met with applause from shareholder groups.
"That was what we had pressed for: That the exchanges would
do this on their own without regulation," said Ralph
Whitworth of United Shareholders Association. "We believe
that dual-class voting is the ultimate
management-entrenchment device."</p>
<p>He added that he expects the move to put pressure on the
Amex to abide by a one-share, one-vote rule, especially if
the Big Board holds the line on its 19c4-type rule.</p>
