	<p class="article-leader">McDonnell Douglas Corp. said it will try to save $700
million a year through "substantial layoffs" and other
measures.
   In a memo to employees yesterday, John McDonnell,
chairman, cited "potentially serious cost problems" on
fixed-price development pacts with the Pentagon, including
the A-12 attack jet, the C-17 cargo plane and the T-45
trainer.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>He also referred to the fact that the company, though
laden with debt, will have to invest $2 billion this year on
the MD-11 passenger jet. "Furthermore," he said, "our MD-80
delivery rates and costs are not yet satisfactory."</p>
<p>Mr. McDonnell added that a corporatewide restructuring
launched with much fanfare almost 18 months ago is "a long
way from realizing its full potential." Indeed, the most
radical reorganization has occurred at the company's
transport-aircraft subsidiary in Long Beach, Calif., and the
unit has been the company's biggest loser quarter after
quarter.</p>
<p>"The hard reality," Mr. McDonnell wrote, "is we must begin
immediately to take further strong actions to reduce our
costs."</p>
<p>At the end of 1989, according to McDonnell Douglas's
financial records, the St. Louis concern had expenses
totaling $14.71 billion; that would mean a $700 million
reduction is equal to about 5% of the company's cost
structure.</p>
<p>"At least that's a start," said First Boston Corp.
aerospace analyst Peter Aseritis, who last week lowered his
1990 earnings estimate for McDonnell Douglas. Because of a
disclosure by the Navy that there is a problem with the A-12,
he is now looking for a $2.25-a-share loss for the year,
instead of a $3-a-share profit.</p>
<p>Carving out $700 million is "a pretty strong step," said
George Shapiro, of Salomon Brothers Inc. "But I don't think
they have any other choice," he said.</p>
<p>Mr. McDonnell said a recent move to cut 4,000 jobs in Long
Beach and eliminate 3,000 contract-labor positions there
already has helped the company meet its cost-savings
objective. But, he asserted, additional actions need to be
taken at every division in areas such as overtime, travel,
new hiring, consultants, advertising and support activities.</p>
<p>And the bottom line, he said, is that "to reduce costs by
the desired amount will entail substantial layoffs across the
corporation." A company spokesman declined to be more
specific. But late last night, Mike Schoen, an assistant
business representative for the Machinists union District 837
in St. Louis, said he understood that 4,000 slots, mostly
white-collar, could be eliminated from the company's Missouri
fighter plant alone. The factory has about 40,000 workers,
and McDonnell Douglas employs more than 130,000 people
overall.</p>
<p>Mr. McDonnell explained in his letter -- addressed, as is
his custom, "to all teammates" -- that because "the
prospective layoffs are driven by ongoing unsatisfactory
business results rather than by productivity improvements, we
will not be offering voluntary retirement severance
programs."</p>
<p>"If possible, we will do what we can to help those
displaced," he said, "but we cannot guarantee jobs where none
exist." A number of military projects at McDonnell Douglas,
the nation's No. 1 military contractor, are slated to be axed
by the Pentagon.</p>
<p>A turnaround at McDonnell Douglas couldn't come too soon.
Although it has been promising improved performance for some
time, the company's debt-to-equity ratio is now almost
1-to-1, and its stock is trading at less than half its book
value.</p>
<p>After tumbling on the A-12 news all last week, McDonnell
Douglas shares closed in composite trading yesterday on the
New York Stock Exchange at $39.50, up 87.5 cents. The company
didn't make known its latest plans until hours after the
market had closed.</p>
<p>Mr. McDonnell, who began meeting yesterday with top
executives to search for places to save money, said he hopes
to have a complete strategy in place by early August.</p>
