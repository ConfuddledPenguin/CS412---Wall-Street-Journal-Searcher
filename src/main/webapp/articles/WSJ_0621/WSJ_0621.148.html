	<p class="article-leader">MANDELA ARRIVED in New York, beginning a 12-day visit to
eight U.S. cities.
   The South African black nationalist leader, who became one
of the world's most celebrated political prisoners, stopped
at a Brooklyn high school before a ticker-tape parade up
Broadway to City Hall. During a welcoming ceremony,
71-year-old Mandela called for a continuation of economic
sanctions against his homeland and offered thanks to his
American supporters. Mandela's U.S. tour will be marked by
festivities celebrating his Feb. 11 release from a South
African prison after 27 years of confinement. He also will be
meeting with U.S. business, religious and political leaders
to discuss anti-apartheid efforts.</p>

sanctions against Pretoria until certain requirements are
met, including release of political prisoners.</p>

<p>BUSH SUSPENDED talks with the PLO over an Arab assault on
Israel last month.</p>
<p>The president halted the 18-month dialogue with the
Palestine Liberation Organization because of its links to an
attempted terrorist attack May 30. Bush, who was reluctant to
call off U.S.-PLO discussions, declared that the U.S. is
ready to resume talks "any time" the PLO more clearly
condemns the seaborne assault on Israel and disciplines those
responsible. "We've given the PLO ample time to deal with
this issue," he said. Members of Congress said they welcomed
the decision.</p>
<p>The PLO called the move "an unfriendly and provocative
act," but an aide to Israel's Shamir said the action "removed
a major obstacle" to peace.</p>

<p>Gorbachev acknowledged that he could lose his Communist
Party post at a national congress in less than two weeks. His
remarks were made in response to criticism from hard-liners
at a Russian Communist meeting. There has been speculation
Gorbachev could step down as party secretary to focus on his
duties as Soviet president.</p>
<p>Uzbekistan and Georgia stepped toward sovereignty, but
neither took actions as radical as the Baltics' independence
declarations. Uzbekistan's parliament proclaimed the
republic's sovereignty, but the Tass news agency said
secession isn't under consideration. Georgia moved to create
a legal mechanism for restoring independence.</p>

<p>An international AIDS conference opened in San Francisco
following a tense prologue of marches and arrests. At a news
conference, Dr. June Osborne, chairwoman of the National
Commission on AIDS, expressed her "personal horror" at
current U.S. laws that restrict infected people from entering
the country.</p>

<p>Romania's Iliescu pledged to be a democratic president of
reconciliation, but the U.S. boycotted his inauguration to
protest violent attacks on opposition figures. Iliescu vowed
to defend "fundamental human rights and freedoms." His
government last week used thousands of miners to put down
massive demonstrations in Bucharest.</p>

<p>Federal prosecutors agreed to release up to $6 million
from Noriega's European bank accounts, saying they wanted to
move quickly with a drug-trafficking case against the former
Panamanian leader. In April, defense attorneys threatened to
withdraw from the case, stating that government seizure of
the assets deprived them of fees.</p>

<p>A fire raged for several hours aboard the U.S. aircraft
carrier Midway off Japan, injuring 16 sailors and blocking
efforts to find two missing men, the Navy said. It was the
second serious Navy accident since a series of mishaps last
fall that killed 14 people and resulted in November's two-day
suspension of Navy operations for a safety review.</p>

<p>The House voted to override Bush's veto of legislation to
give millions of government employees the right to play a
more active role in politics. The 327-93 House vote, well
over the necessary two-third majority, sets up a Senate
showdown today on the bill, which would remove many of the
prohibitions contained in the 1939 Hatch Act.</p>

<p>A major earthquake shook Northern Iran. Early accounts by
the Iranian news agency said that heavy casualties were
feared and also reported widespread destruction. The temblor,
which measured 7.7 on the Richter scale, occurred in the
Caspian Sea about 15 miles off the Iranian coast and 210
miles northwest of Tehran.</p>

<p>An environmental conference was poised to endorse a global
ban by 2000 on chlorofluorocarbons and many other
ozone-destroying chemicals. As the 10-day meeting got under
way in London, many delegates expressed confidence they would
be able to reach an agreement on tougher protective measures
for the world's ozone layer.</p>

<p>Taipei newscasts said Chinese rock star Hou Dejian, a
Taiwan native who defected to the mainland seven years ago
only to become its No. 1 dissident last summer, fled back to
the island.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>Bolivian workers began a two-day national strike called by
the country's main trade union body to protest gasoline price
rises. Union leaders said the walkout paralyzed some
factories and public transportation, but the Andean nation's
labor minister said most of Bolivia was unaffected. Protest
marches were scheduled for today.</p>
