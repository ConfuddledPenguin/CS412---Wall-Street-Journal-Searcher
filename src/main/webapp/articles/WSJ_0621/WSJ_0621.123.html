	<p class="article-leader">FRANKFURT, West Germany -- West German personal car
production rose 16% in May to 419,600 units from 361,186 a
year earlier, the German Automobile Industry Association
said.
   Some of the increase came from an additional work day in
May, compared with the year-earlier month, but even on a
calendar-adjusted basis, output climbed 11%.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>In the first five months of this year, car production
increased 6% to 2,071,000 from 1,969,000 a year earlier.</p>
