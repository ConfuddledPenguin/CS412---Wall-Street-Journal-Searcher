	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- The dollar ended mostly higher after receiving
a boost from foreign-exchange traders' desertion of the mark
on news of turmoil in the Soviet Union. The West German
currency fell against all other major currencies, allowing
the gains by its U.S. counterpart.
   Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev told a stormy Communist
party conference he may soon no longer be the party leader.
"Tomorrow, or after 10 days or 12 days, there may be another
General Secretary," Mr. Gorbachev said. He didn't say whether
he would resign his post or be forced out as chairman by
party hardliners.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Recently, there has been some speculation that Mr.
Gorbachev could relinquish his post as party secretary to
concentrate on his duties as Soviet president.</p>
<p>According to a second report -- later corrected -- the
Soviet Central Asian republic of Uzbekistan declared
independence. The Tass news agency corrected its story to say
the Uzbekistan parliament was merely debating a draft of such
a declaration.</p>
<p>But the short-term damage to the mark had already been
done. In the confusion, the dollar rose to its intraday high
of 1.6840 marks, about 22 minutes after the correction had
appeared on news services.</p>
<p>The mark was hurt by the political news more than other
non-dollar currencies for various reasons, dealers said.</p>
<p>At the beginning of trading, the foreign exchange market
was generally long marks. When dealers moved to the dollar --
the traditional safe-haven currency in times of turmoil --
the mark had the most to lose.</p>
<p>Also, as the Soviet Union's biggest trading partner in the
West, West Germany is considered the most vulnerable to
economic deterioration by its giant neighbor. And it is
assumed that divisiveness in the Soviet Union will delay
unity in Germany.</p>
<p>The planned reunification of East and West Germany has
been the principal support beneath the mark of late, largely
accounting for its 20-pfennig rise against the dollar since
the Berlin Wall fell in November.</p>
<p>By coincidence, the start-up of German monetary union and
the opening of the 28th Soviet Communist Party Congress,
where Mr. Gorbachev's leadership faces a challenge, will fall
on the same date: July 2.</p>
<p>Late in New York trading, the dollar was quoted at 1.6785
marks, up from 1.6738 marks late Tuesday in New York. The
U.S. currency also was changing hands at 153.93 yen, up from
153.55. Sterling was trading at $1.7215, up from $1.7210 late
Tuesday.</p>
<p>In early trading in Tokyo Thursday, the dollar was quoted
at 154.33 yen; it closed Wednesday in Tokyo at 153.98 yen.
Meanwhile, the U.S. currency was trading at about 1.6793
marks, up from Wednesday's Tokyo close of 1.6790 marks.</p>
<p>Helping the mark recover from its intraday low against the
dollar on Wednesday was a feeling among traders that, for Mr.
Gorbachev, shedding the burden of being both Soviet president
and Communist leader may be the best thing, said Peter
Iversen of Shawmut Bank of Boston.</p>
<p>David Puth, foreign exchange manager for Chemical Bank,
added that "people's memories are still very geared to what
happened last time" there was a report that Mr. Gorbachev
would resign. Last Jan. 30, when Cable News Network reported
that Mr. Gorbachev might step down as Communist Party chief,
the dollar soared about 2% from around 1.6800 marks to 1.7130
marks within 15 minutes.</p>
<p>The story was denied, and the dollar retreated as quickly
as it had advanced. "When the market moves that fast," Mr.
Puth said, "people are losing money." This time, he said,
traders were more wary.</p>
<p>On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for current
delivery rose $1.40 to $350.50 an ounce. Estimated volume was
a moderate 3.3 million ounces.</p>
<p>In Hong Kong Thursday, gold was quoted at $350.45 an
ounce.</p>
