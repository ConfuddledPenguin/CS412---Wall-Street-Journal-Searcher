	<p class="article-leader">GERMANY'S FUTURE CAPITAL</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>As German unity nears, the argument over a future capital
continues to grow.</p>
<p>Berlin, capital of the old Germany, is working hard to
prepare to resume its role as the power center of the new
nation. But Bonn, West Germany's "temporary" capital since
1949, has launched a campaign to hold on to parliament,
ministries and foreign embassies.</p>
<p>What's likely to emerge is a compromise, with the head of
state, whose role is strictly ceremonial, moving to Berlin
and the city being made the official capital, while the real
seats of power -- the chancellor's office, the parliament and
government ministries -- stay in Bonn.</p>
<p>A full move to Berlin by all of Bonn's politicians,
bureaucrats, lobbyists, diplomats and journalists could cost,
pro-Bonn campaigners say, at least 80 billion marks ($48
billion).</p>
<p>APPEAL FROM AFRICA</p>
<p>At a summit of African leaders with French President
Francois Mitterrand, the Africans appealed for Western help
to salvage their shattered economies before they can embrace
multiparty democracy. "Africa is suffering more from its
economy than from its politics," Togo's President Gnassingbe
Eyadema told Mr. Mitterrand. Evidently in agreement with that
view, Mr. Mitterrand told the French daily Le Monde that "it
is for the Africans to decide who rules them and how."</p>
<p>LATIN AMERICAN HEALTH CRISIS</p>
<p>Some 170 million people in Latin America are denied basic
nutrition and health care, and more than 40 million live in
critical poverty, a World Health Organization official told
an international conference on "Democracy and Health" in
Caracas. The official, Carlyle Guerra de Macedo, said health
conditions in the region had worsened in the 1980s. Although
the region spent $45 billion on medical care, an estimated
30% of the money was wasted or wrongly spent, he said.</p>
<p>CORRUPTION IN HONG KONG</p>
<p>In a Hong Kong magistrate's court yesterday, Charles
Warwick Reid, former head of the commercial-crime unit of the
Hong Kong Legal Department, pleaded guilty to corruption. Mr.
Reid was charged under the British colony's Prevention of
Bribery Ordinance with possession of assets disproportionate
to his government pay. The assets cited include 2.4 million
New Zealand dollars (US$1.4 million) in bank balances and
three tracts of property in his native New Zealand. The
offense to which Mr. Reid pleaded guilty carries a maximum
penalty of 10 years in prison and a fine of 100,000 Hong Kong
dollars (US$12,840).</p>
<p>FRENCH LANGUAGE CHANGES</p>
<p>France's Premier Michel Rocard accepted a report by the
High Council of the French Language incorporating 15 pages of
recommended spelling changes. The premier said he will ask
National Education Minister Lionel Jospin to assure the
changes are taught in all schools as of next year. The
recommendations indicate the hyphen, much used in French, is
all but being discarded. Thus, "cow-boy" and "week-end" --
two words borrowed from English -- will under the new rules
become "cowboy" and "weekend."</p>
<p>TOBACCO RESTRICTIONS IN CHINA</p>
<p>China's legislature began deliberating a proposed law that
would ensure state revenue from tobacco sales and address the
risks of smoking. The draft bill would restrict cigarette
imports, ban the sale of cigarettes to teenagers and require
China's tobacco industry, the largest in the world, to warn
that "smoking is harmful to human health." Under the proposed
law, the state would control all tobacco imports and exports.
China has an estimated 300 million smokers among its 1.1
billion population.</p>
<p>SWISS REFUGEE LAW</p>
<p>The Swiss parliament gave its final approval to more
restrictive immigration legislation.</p>
<p>The new law, effective tomorrow, speeds up screening
procedures to separate genuine refugees fleeing political
persecution from people seeking better living conditions. In
a bid to make Switzerland less attractive to economic
migrants, the law also prohibits asylum seekers from working
for the first three months of their stay.</p>
<p>Last year, nearly 25,000 people asked Switzerland for
refugee status, while a further 40,000 requests remained
outstanding from previous years. More than 95% of
applications processed in 1989 were rejected. Turks
constituted the largest group of asylum seekers, followed by
Sri Lankans.</p>
<p>Authorities have anticipated there will be at least 32,000
applications for refugee status this year. In a country where
16% of the 6.7 million inhabitants are foreigners, the influx
of immigrants has become a contentious political issue.</p>
<p>POSTSCRIPTS . . .</p>
<p>In Passau, West Germany, those who aren't soccer fans can
escape the World Cup mania at the White Cross pub. The owner
guarantees no soccer will be shown on the TV and says anyone
found discussing the sport will be barred for the rest of the
tournament. . . . Long hours of Torah study and bobbing of
the head in fervent prayer make Jewish seminary students
twice as likely to be nearsighted as the average Israeli
teenager, according to an eight-year-long study by David
Berson, head of ophthalmology at Jerusalem's Shaarei Zedek
Hospital.</p>
