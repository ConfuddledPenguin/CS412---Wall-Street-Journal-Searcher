	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- The Democratic majority on the House Rules
Committee sent the flag-desecration amendment to the House
floor for a vote today despite particularly savage demands by
Republicans to wait until next week.
   The GOP wanted to use the weekend to round up votes for
the proposed constitutional amendment, but Speaker Thomas
Foley (D., Wash.) pushed for bringing it to the floor
quickly. The vote is expected to be close.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>During debate on the floor, Rep. Gerald Solomon (R., N.Y.)
accused Mr. Foley of "kowtowing to the ilk like the Communist
Youth Brigade to allow them to trample and desecrate our
American flag." His remarks were challenged as improper by
Rep. Barbara Boxer (D., Calif.), and he was forced to
withdraw them after a ruling by Speaker Pro Tempore Jolene
Unsoeld (D., Wash.) that they violated House rules concerning
proper debate.</p>
<p>The House Judiciary Committee voted 19-17 Tuesday to send
the amendment to the floor without recommendation. The Rules
Committee, 9-4, set the vote for today, waiving the normal
three-day waiting period.</p>
<p>Speaker Foley said there was no reason to delay the
measure, which he said had been "debated and discussed as
much as any other legislative proposal of this Congress."</p>
