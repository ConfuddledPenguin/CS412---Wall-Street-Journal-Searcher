	<p class="article-leader">STOCKHOLM -- Sweden's Svenska Cellulosa AB agreed to
acquire British forest products concern Reedpack Ltd.,
continuing the spate of recent takeovers sweeping Europe's
pulp and paper industry.
   SCA agreed to pay #543.9 million ($937.4 million) for
Reedpack's fully diluted share capital and will assume #500
million in debt. Reedpack was formed two years ago in a #610
million management buy-out of Reed International PLC's
European paper, packaging and office supplies operations.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>SCA's offer is nearly triple the #210 million in equity
and preference capital injected by management and
institutional investors under the buy-out -- Britain's
biggest management buy-out to date. Reedpack directors
unanimously recommended the offer and irrevocable acceptances
have been received from investors representing 75% of
Reedpack shares outstanding, the companies said.</p>
<p>The transaction remains subject to shareholder approval,
as well as an antitrust review by U.K. authorities. British
officials raised no objections during preliminary contacts,
SCA said. To facilitate the antitrust review, the company
agreed to sell its minority stakes in two U.K.-based
packaging ventures to their controlling owner, Jefferson
Smurfit Group PLC.</p>
<p>SCA Chief Executive Sverker Martin-Loef said the big
Swedish forestry group had been a suitor when the Reed
operations were spun off in 1988 but was outbid by the
buy-out group.</p>
<p>The acquisition would strengthen SCA's position as one of
Europe's biggest producers of corrugated packaging products
-- and make the Swedish concern a major producer of newsprint
using recycled waste paper as raw material.</p>
<p>SCA said interest costs for the debt-financed acquisition
will dilute per-share earnings this year, but Mr. Martin-Loef
predicted that gradual synergy gains -- plus effects of
substantial capital investments made by Reedpack during the
past two years -- would add about 10% to SCA's previous
projection of per-share earnings in 1992.</p>
<p>Swedish investors seemed to approve of the marriage. SCA's
B-free shares, the series most traded internationally,
climbed one krona to 115 kronor in moderately heavy trading
on the Stockholm Stock Exchange yesterday.</p>
<p>But some analysts questioned the acquisition's high price
-- a multiple of 20 times Reedpack's fiscal 1990 earnings --
and warned that SCA's 1990 pretax profit could plunge by as
much as 20% as a result.</p>
<p>"This shows that companies are prepared to pay exceptional
prices to achieve market positions, size and long-term growth
in European pulp and paper, though markets probably will
soften for the next two or three years," said forestry
analyst Stephen Weller at London securities firm UBS/Phillips
& Drew.</p>
<p>Swallowing Reedpack would increase SCA's annual sales by
about 25% to an estimated 33 billion Swedish kronor ($5.44
billion).</p>
