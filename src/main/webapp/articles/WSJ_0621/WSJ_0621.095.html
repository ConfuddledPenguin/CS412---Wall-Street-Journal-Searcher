	<p class="article-leader">Another financial institution fell from the ranks of the
exclusive but brutally competitive U.S. securities dealers
that do business directly with the Federal Reserve Bank of
New York.
   Australia's Westpac Banking Corp. said it was closing its
Westpac Pollock Government Securities Inc. subsidiary
immediately. The primary dealer had losses of about $29
million in the first half of its year that began Oct. 1.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Once one of the most coveted franchises in international
finance, the group of firms that deal with the New York Fed
when it buys and sells U.S. government securities as part of
its activities to influence U.S. monetary policy -- known as
"primary dealers" -- have had a tough time making money over
the past two years.</p>
<p>The U.S. government-bond business "has become very
difficult," said John R. Burrus, president and chief
executive officer of CRT Government Securities Ltd., another
primary dealer. "Trading volume is down, profit margins are
down, too, and volatility is way down from prior years."</p>
<p>Westpac is Australia's biggest bank with about 118 billion
Australian dollars (US$92.5 billion) in assets, of which
roughly 10% is in the U.S. The bank said most of the closed
unit's approximately 160 employees have been dismissed.
Westpac paid $120 million for Wm. E. Pollock Government
Securities Inc., an independent securities firm, in late
1986.</p>
<p>The securities subsidiary posted a deficit of $3.9 million
in fiscal 1989, ended Sept. 30, mostly because of losses
associated with a failed attempt to start up a
mortgage-backed securities operation. But Anthony J. Walton,
executive vice president and general manager at Westpac in
New York, said that the government-bond dealing operations
had remained profitable until this year.</p>
<p>People in the bond market said that Westpac tried selling
the operations to France's Cie. Financiere de Paribas and a
big Japanese bank, but was unsuccessful. Paribas didn't
return a phone call for confirmation.</p>
<p>Some other firms are rumored to be either on the block or
considering closing down their operations, several traders
said.</p>
<p>Despite the closing, Mr. Walton said: "Westpac's other
operations in the U.S. are very healthy and very profitable."
He said the bank maintained relationships with about 250
major U.S. corporations.</p>
<p>"You have to be very, very clear on focus, and we felt
that strategically the primary dealership no longer fitted as
it did in 1986," said Mr. Walton, noting the intense
competition in global securities markets. "It's a very tough
decision to give up something that so many people prize such
as this; but at the end of the day, it's the shareholder that
counts."</p>
<p>Last year, two British banks -- National Westminster Bank
PLC and Lloyds Bank PLC -- abandoned the business, along with
L.F. Rothschild & Co. Two dealerships were also eliminated
when Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. last year acquired the
brokerage business of Thomson McKinnon Securities Inc. and
Drexel Burnham Lambert Group Inc. filed for protection under
the federal Bankruptcy Code.</p>
<p>Westpac's dropout lowers to 43 the number of primary
dealers, from a peak of 46 at the end of 1988. Sixteen of the
firms are controlled by foreign institutions: eight Japanese,
three British, two Swiss and one each from Canada and Hong
Kong. The Fed also lists First Boston Corp. as a foreign
institution, because over 50% of it is owned by foreigners,
but doesn't assign it a specific national designation.
However, some people regard it as a Swiss institution,
because it is 44.5% owned by CS Holding, which also owns
Credit Suisse, a big bank.</p>
<p>Still, several firms, mostly foreign, have eagerly sought
to be designated as primary dealers. A major reason is that
numerous U.S. pension funds, insurance companies and other
large institutional investors will do business only with
primary dealers. Moreover, winning admission is widely
considered a mark of prestige.</p>
<p>A subsidiary of Swiss Bank Corp. became a primary dealer
in March. Last December, units of Union Bank of Switzerland
and Britain's Barclays Bank PLC joined the elite club. And
other foreign institutions, including West Germany's Deutsche
Bank AG, are waiting in the wings.</p>
