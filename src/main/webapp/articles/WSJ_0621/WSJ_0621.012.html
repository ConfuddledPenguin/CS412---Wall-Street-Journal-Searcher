	<p class="article-leader">Tim W. Ferguson's May 22 Business World column attributing
rising health-insurance premiums to use and abuse of
psychiatric care is a grotesque distortion. There is in fact
little evidence that the use of mental-health services is
surging out of control as is being alleged by some
psychiatric managed-care companies, and the data cited by Mr.
Ferguson also do not make the case.
   Let's take two of the items on which he bases his charge:
the Higgins studies and the rise in inpatient admissions over
20 years. First, if the Higgins surveys show anything worth
reporting, it is that very few employers have any data at all
on the cost of psychiatric care in their health plans. The
1988 Higgins survey of psychiatric costs, showing the
much-ballyhooed 27% rise in a single year, had a net response
rate of only 8%. Of the employers that were asked this
question, 82% did not answer, and of the 18% responding, more
than half said they "did not know" what share of total
health-plan costs represented mental-health services.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The National Institute of Mental Health data are correct:
Hospital admission for treatment of mental illness and
substance abuse from 1969 to 1987 rose about 38%. Of course,
the U.S. population during that time also rose 21%, so there
was a net per-capita rise of roughly 17% -- less than 1% a
year. Of this, about a third can be explained by greater
resort to treatment of alcohol and drug abuse.</p>
<p>In 1969, treatment of chemical dependency was limited
mostly to alcoholic psychosis -- "DTs" -- the most advanced
form of alcohol abuse. Moreover, even this treatment was not
covered by health insurance, so the cost in that period would
not have been noticed in employee health plans. Three
separate studies -- 1971, 1980, and 1985 -- estimated that
the total direct costs of mental illness and substance abuse
ranged from 12% to 14% of all health-care costs.</p>
<p>The best global estimates do not support the shrill outcry
of the managed-care promoters so frequently echoed by the
journalists they have been able to con.</p>

<p>Mr. Ferguson's concluding sentence states that ". . .
mental health responsibilities, like much of wellness, are
best handled close to home." What he and most other critics
of mental-health and physical-health expenditures fail to see
is the near-perfect correlation between the major social
changes of the past 50 years and the increased need for
mental-health services. The increased need for
substitute/compensatory institutional services in the form of
medical and mental-health services demonstrates that the
vacuum left by the loss of family and community and economic
instability is being filled by these services. Again we are
reminded that any "progress" will come at some significant
but often unpredicted cost.</p>

<p>---</p>
<p>One factor not addressed is the public's increased
acceptance of mental conditions and substance abuse as
treatable disorders, a point of view more common on the West
Coast. The success of these facilities is largely a product
of this attitude.</p>
<p>In both my private practice and position as a hospital
clinical director, I have had to deal with frustrating
financial trends. Currently, inpatient benefits are being cut
back drastically, but with little being done to adjust
outpatient and partial hospital benefits to offset this. And
often, when hospitalization is covered, mental-health
benefits have such limited caps that the insurance will cover
the cost of only a few days' stay, barely enough time to
assess adequately (not treat) a patient. While costs have to
be controlled, let's be balanced in the approach and let's
also accept that there are people who really need these
services. Psychotherapy is not a luxury nor in the same class
as beauty surgery, as Mr. Ferguson implies.</p>
<p>We need to be realistic about how people coped with mental
problems in the past (and frequently still do). They isolated
themselves, dropped out of school or work, frequently drank,
and became a burden to their family and community. If their
condition became bad enough, they ended up in state
hospitals. Is this what we want to be the future standard?</p>

<p>Mr. Ferguson's column is an example of what I call
"diseasism." He uses mental-diseasist codewords such as
"shrinks" and "pysch shops," refers to the disorders of
sexual abuse, eating disorders and co-dependency as "voguish
social and personal problems," equates the benefits of
psychotherapy with cosmetic surgery, and refers to therapies
for mental illness as "another burden of modern life {that}
had been made institutional instead of individual."</p>
<p>Diseasism, like racism or sexism, embodies a set of
attitudes that are pejorative and discriminatory and result
in adverse actions being taken against groups of people just
because of the disease they have. Legislation is a remedy
when the "isms" get out of hand and that is why insurance was
mandated for addictive disorders, as well as for civil
rights.</p>
<p>Shall we harken back to Mr. Ferguson's good ole days, to
the days of shame and stigma, when alcoholics were denied
treatment in emergency rooms and were jailed, and when
psychiatric patients were hidden behind a family's closed
doors, often resulting in the family's emotional and
financial bankruptcy?</p>
<p>Cutting all benefits for mental and addictive diseases
would barely put a dent in overall medical costs (about 5% to
10%, according to Mr. Ferguson's data) and would short
circuit a resolution to the nation's health-care financing
crisis. Denying these diseases by not treating them will
result in more serious medical, psychiatric, criminal and
societal problems later on and will magnify health-care
costs.</p>
