	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- In his five years as chairman of Citicorp,
John S. Reed has used phrases like "consistent" and
"predictable" to describe his earnings objectives for the
nation's largest banking company.
   "My goal is to be boring," he once told securities
analysts.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>But "disappointing" more accurately describes Citicorp's
performance under Mr. Reed, the wunderkind who built the
Citibank consumer business. In the past decade, Citicorp has
achieved its earnings goal only once, in 1988.</p>
<p>Now, investors, who once patiently conceded that Mr.
Reed's vision of a global financial-services company couldn't
be realized overnight, are increasingly questioning whether
he will achieve his goals -- 18% return on equity and 15% to
20% annual growth in earnings per share -- anytime soon.
Citicorp's first-quarter results strongly suggest it won't
happen this year. Says Mr. Reed: "That's a good bet."</p>
<p>Typical of restive Citicorp shareholders is Kevin McCarey,
a portfolio manager at Fidelity Investments. Saying that at a
meeting with Citicorp officials a month ago some investors
were "berating them," Mr. McCarey adds: "Everyone, including
us, is getting impatient because their consumer business is
going so well and more of the positive effect should be
reflected in the stock price."</p>
<p>The 51-year-old Mr. Reed, the company's largest individual
shareholder, understands their frustrations: "You could say
our stock stinks, which is true." Yesterday, it closed at
$22.50, down 37 1/2 cents a share on the day and well below
its book value of $25.36 a share.</p>
<p>Much of the disappointment with earnings in recent years
is attributable to soured Third World loans. But as that
problem receded somewhat, investors expected Citicorp's
tremendous consumer business to propel earnings to new
heights. However, those hopes have been dashed by a slump in
commercial real estate and corporate takeovers and
restructurings. Now, borrowers such as Campeau Corp., Ames
Department Stores and Donald Trump are replacing Brazil and
Argentina as the main problems dragging down Citicorp's
earnings and stock price. (The bank's Trump debt, largely
secured by the developer's properties, exceeds $200 million.)</p>
<p>"While John Reed has done a lot of the right things,
there's good reason to get upset with Citicorp," says Nancy
Young, an analyst for the College Retirement Equities Fund, a
large stockholder. "We see all these goodies {in its consumer
business} and wonder why aren't we reaping more of the
benefits. In their zeal to invest in the future, they forget
about today. I don't have any problem with their investments
in the information business and other areas, but there has to
be some kind of balance."</p>
<p>As troubled loans rise, Citicorp's reserve and capital
levels are looking skimpy. In both areas, Citicorp comes in
at or near the bottom among big U.S. banks: Its reserves are
only 56% of nonperforming loans, while many big competitors'
reserves are at about 70% or more, and its common-stock
equity is below that of almost all its rivals. By some
estimates, Citicorp needs $2 billion in additional capital
and reserves.</p>
<p>Citicorp is "leaving a thin margin for error," says
Kenneth Pinkes of Moody's Investors Service.</p>
<p>The low levels of capital and reserves recently led the
major debt-rating agencies to downgrade most ratings on
Citicorp's debt. The result: Citicorp will pay a slightly
higher price when borrowing money in the commercial-paper
market. Next to consumer deposits, commercial paper --
short-term IOUs -- has been Citicorp's cheapest source of
funds.</p>
<p>The credit downgrading and weak stock price may, in turn,
curtail Citicorp's expansion just as it is prowling for
acquisitions in Europe and in California, which is opening
itself up to full-blown interstate banking in 1991.</p>
<p>Indeed, Citicorp may be reconciled to sitting on the
sidelines. It recently agreed to purchase tiny DeAnza Bank,
of San Jose, Calif. California bankers interpret the $35
million acquisition as a signal that Citicorp may forgo
seeking to buy First Interstate Bancorp., a long-rumored
target, or another major institution there in favor of using
DeAnza to grow a branch at a time. Citicorp itself says it is
simply keeping its options open. (Since 1986, it has owned a
savings and loan association, recently renamed Citibank FSB,
in the San Francisco Bay area.)</p>
<p>Citicorp dismisses criticism from Moody's and Standard &
Poor's that it needs proportionately higher reserves. The
company argues that its far-flung, diverse portfolio makes it
unique among U.S. banks. Thomas E. Jones, Citicorp's
executive vice president for financial controls, audit and
taxes, says that in its worst years write-offs of bad loans
never exceeded 20% of nonperforming loans.</p>
<p>Moreover, he says, one-third of the amounts written off
are eventually recovered. During the 1970s, Citicorp says,
the bank ultimately recouped half of what it wrote off on
real-estate loans through sales of foreclosed properties and
other means.</p>
<p>But bankers and analysts see in the downgrading of the
nation's only truly global bank symbolic implications far
outweighing the pennies per share that it will cost
shareholders. "At the margin, capital markets are being shut
down to the nation's largest bank," says Charles Peabody, a
Kidder, Peabody & Co. analyst.</p>
<p>Rather than knuckle under to calls for greater reserves
and more emphasis on short-term profits, Mr. Reed takes a
damn-the-torpedoes attitude. He refuses to cut bait on
several poor acquisitions that he made, such as its Arizona
bank, two S&Ls and the Quotron subsidiary. He insists that
reserves are adequate and that capital will be replenished
through asset sales and retained earnings. New shares will be
issued only for a major acquisition, he adds.</p>
<p>Mr. Reed, who relishes his reputation as a maverick,
always has had a penchant for risk-taking. As a junior
executive at Citicorp, he undertook what many regarded as a
no-win task: streamlining its back office and data
processing. Later, while building the consumer business, Mr.
Reed came close to being fired for his nonchalant attitude
toward years of mounting losses, former Citicorp officials
say. In his most celebrated move since becoming chairman, he
threw down the gauntlet to deadbeat borrowers such as Brazil:
His surprise $3 billion addition to reserves in 1987 implied
a willingness to halt any further lending to such countries.</p>
<p>In April, Mr. Reed's bravado surfaced again. Citicorp
thumbed its nose at critics by announcing a 9.9% increase in
the dividend at the same time its write-offs of bad loans
soared 79% and first-quarter earnings plunged 56%.</p>
<p>Yet, Mr. Reed clearly feels the pressure to improve
performance. The clearest sign was his decision in January to
name Richard S. Braddock to the long-vacant presidency. Mr.
Braddock, who had headed the consumer business, is a much
more hands-on manager than Mr. Reed, who prefers dealing with
strategic issues rather than nuts-and-bolts administration.
Now, Mr. Braddock is reviewing individual businesses'
progress on a monthly rather than a quarterly basis, enabling
the bank to respond more quickly to developing problems.</p>
<p>To be sure, Mr. Reed has delivered on many of his
promises. For the first time this year, Citicorp's consumer
business will earn more than $1 billion, more than a fivefold
increase since he became chairman. The consumer bank's
earnings are growing by at least $100 million a year, and
Citicorp continues to invest heavily in global expansion and
in new technology, such as its new home-banking terminal, the
"Enhanced Telephone."</p>
<p>In addition, Citicorp is in a neck-and-neck race with
American Express Co. to be the world's biggest issuer of
charge and credit cards. It also has become the nation's
biggest originator and servicer of residential mortgages.</p>
<p>And despite the criticism of Citicorp's reserve position,
it is in better shape than it was under Walter Wriston, Mr.
Reed's predecessor. When Mr. Reed became chairman, reserves
were less than $1 billion; today, after increases in 1987 and
1989, they total $4.6 billion. And in the past three years,
Citicorp has worked down its developing-country debt to an
$8.4 billion problem from an $11 billion one.</p>
<p>"We've actually made some pretty good progress against our
vision" of what the bank should do, Mr. Reed says. For much
of his chairmanship, his energies have been consumed by the
developing-countries debt problem. "I can't begin to tell you
the degree of distraction that it has been," he says. "I
personally think that when we look back on this period we'll
give ourselves pretty high marks for how we managed the
problem."</p>
<p>"I give him good marks, not top marks," Ronald Mandle, an
analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., comments. "He's more
visionary than most bankers, and he's bought shares with his
own money, unlike other New York bank managements. His
interests are more aligned with shareholders."</p>
<p>Mr. Reed complains, however, that something beyond the
bank's control has repeatedly cropped up and kept it from
achieving its financial goals. What he calls the
"externalities" blighting the 1990 outlook are the weakening
commercial-real-estate market and the disappearance of highly
leveraged corporate buy-outs.</p>
<p>So, when will the dark clouds blow away? "My guess," Mr.
Reed says, "is that you're going to see that in 1992 to
1995." By then, he explains, the danger of developing-country
loans will have been defused, and real-estate markets should
be rebounding.</p>
<p>Citicorp is the nation's largest lender on commercial real
estate. Since 1985, Citicorp's portfolio of such loans has
more than doubled to $12.8 billion. However, its past-due
real-estate loans and foreclosures have surged fivefold to
$1.6 billion from $303 million. Further increases are likely;
downturns in real-estate cycles typically last two to three
years. Similarly, Citicorp's $7.9 billion of loans to highly
leveraged transactions includes nearly $700 million of loans
in trouble.</p>
<p>As big as the numbers are, those two types of loans pose
less of a threat to Citicorp than to other banks.
Commercial-real-estate loans make up only 10% and highly
leveraged transactions only 5% of Citicorp's $160 billion
loan portfolio. Most large banks show higher percentages.</p>
<p>Moreover, Citicorp's real-estate portfolio is well
diversified geographically. Only 3% of it is in hard-hit New
England; the largest exposure, 21%, is in the healthy
California market.</p>
<p>Citicorp contends that even in troubled leveraged
buy-outs, such as Campeau's Allied and Federated units, which
owe Citicorp $288 million, its position is fully secured and
insulated against losses. But banks do lose money on some
deals.</p>
<p>For all today's problem loans, Mr. Reed is upbeat about
Citicorp's prospects. "If you're concerned about my
temperature," he says, "I'm feeling better about where we are
than I was three years ago."</p>
<p>To unleash the profit potential of the consumer
businesses, analysts and consultants suggest that Citicorp
should dump its money-losing Quotron subsidiary, slash staff
and expenses and cut deeply into commercial lending in North
America, Europe and Japan. Though once accounting for nearly
all of Citicorp's earnings, commercial banking in the
developed countries may earn only $160 million this year.
"Traditional commercial banking, as practiced by most banks,
is only a 7% return-on-equity business," says James McCormick
of First Manhattan Consulting Group.</p>
<p>Citicorp has reined in some commercial-banking activities.
In commercial real estate, for instance, Citicorp is
stressing less risky roles for itself, such as arranging
sales, debt and equity investments. In the past month, Mr.
Reed has met individually with more than three dozen of
Citicorp's large real-estate customers to gauge market
conditions and to assure them that the bank isn't abandoning
the business.</p>
<p>Citicorp also has shut down -- with much embarrassment --
big money-losing ventures, such as its Citicorp Scrimgeour
Vickers securities dealer in London and its underwriting of
municipal securities in the U.S. And it is pursuing its
hard-won corporate securities underwriting powers with far
less elan than Bankers Trust New York Corp. and J.P. Morgan &
Co.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Michael A. Callen, who heads Citicorp's
commercial and investment banking for North America, Europe
and Japan, is preparing a plan to focus Citicorp's resources
on about six profitable lines of business, according to bank
officers. However, Mr. Reed rejects suggestions that he shut
down traditional commercial-banking businesses in the
developed countries. "Intellectually and culturally, it's
still the heart of the business," and a "solid" commercial
business can be built in those nations, he says. "There are
very few consumer-only financial companies that are
exciting."</p>
<p>The information business, which in the first quarter of
this year lost money at a $164 million annual rate, is
another drain on earnings that is off-limits to cost-cutters.
Much of that loss is simply amortization of the premium paid
in the $628 million acquisition of Quotron in 1986. However,
with all the cost-cutting on Wall Street, the stock-price
service is losing money on an operating basis, too.</p>
<p>All along, Mr. Reed has said the information business is
in the incubation stage and won't contribute significantly to
profits until the mid-1990s. Citicorp is investing heavily in
it. It is developing a consumer marketing information system
that gives retailers new ways to target consumers for
promotions. And Quotron is developing a trading terminal for
government bond dealers and a foreign-exchange trading
terminal, called FX Trader, that shows promise of making
inroads against Reuters Holdings PLC's rival service. Last
year, Telerate Inc., which is owned by Dow Jones & Co., the
publisher of this newspaper, also introduced its own
electronic foreign-exchange trading system, The Trading
Service.</p>
<p>Mr. Reed confidently predicts Citicorp earnings will
triple to $5 billion by the mid to late 1990s. However, many
investors, weary of unfulfilled promises, can't help but
wonder whether Mr. Reed is referring to some massaged measure
of earnings. But others remain optimistic.</p>
<p>"In 10 years, the question investors will ask each other,"
says Heiko Thieme, a fund manager at Deutsche Bank Capital
Corp., "will be: `Did you buy Citicorp?' Not, `What did you
pay for it?'"</p>
