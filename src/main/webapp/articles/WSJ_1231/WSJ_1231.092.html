	<p class="article-leader">LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Orion Pictures Corp. agreed to give
its majority shareholder a cut of profits from the movie
"Mermaids" in return for a $23 million investment.
   Shareholder John W. Kluge and his partner Stuart
Subotnick, executive vice president of Mr. Kluge's Metromedia
Co., will receive up to 64% of certain profits from the
movie, according to a filing with the Securities and Exchange
Commission.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>In addition, the filing indicates the pair may receive
certain profits from Orion's next scheduled release, "The
Silence of the Lambs," should receipts from "Mermaids" prove
disappointing.</p>
<p>The romantic comedy starring Cher and Winona Ryder grossed
$8.3 million over the Christmas holiday weekend.</p>
<p>An Orion spokeswoman would not comment on the $23 million
investment -- in the form of a joint venture called
MetMermaids -- saying she could not reach top executives for
an explanation.</p>
<p>Mr. Kluge holds about 70% of Orion shares.</p>
<p>Orion recently retained the New York investment banking
firm Salomon Brothers to find new sources of money.</p>
