	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- The annual year-end jump in short-term
interest rates is unusually intense this year as banks,
particularly Japanese banks, scramble to get their hands on a
diminished pile of available money.
   Short-term rates usually soar around year-end as banks
race to borrow short-term funds to put on their balance
sheets. This maneuver is done for accounting purposes and is
commonly known as "window dressing."</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>While it's not unusual for year-end rates to rise into
double digits, eyebrows were raised in midweek when the
closely watched federal funds rate charge on overnight loans
between banks briefly reached 100% -- far above its target of
7% -- and some Eurodollar deposit rates hit 50%.</p>
<p>"There has been frantic bidding for year-end funds" for
more than a month, said Louis Crandall, economist at W.R.
Wrightson & Associates. He said the jump in rates reflects
unsually strong demand for funds at a time when many lenders
in the market -- which consists mostly of other banks -- are
limiting supply.</p>
<p>Although most economists expect the pressures to be
relieved later this week or next week, they say that rising
short-term bank borrowing rates is a major reason commercial
banks haven't yet lowered their prime lending rates, a common
benchmark for consumer loans.</p>
<p>Late in the week, brokers who trade in the federal funds
market were quoting rates for U.S. banks of between 10% and
12%. Yet some Japanese banks -- a group that has been
severely squeezed in the short-term funds market -- were
paying between 20% and 50%.</p>
<p>Essentially, these borrowers were locking in commitments
to take delivery of funds at year-end that they plan to repay
in early January, a phenomenon known to the market as
turn-of-the-year financing.</p>
<p>It might seem surprising that the Japanese banks have been
hit much harder than their U.S. counterparts, considering
that many of the largest Japanese banks are thought to be
healthier than the big U.S. banks. But there are widespread
concerns that some Japanese banks will stumble amid further
erosion of Japan's stock and real estate markets. This fear
is causing U.S. investors to discriminate against all
Japanese banks. The Japanese stock market declined nearly 40%
in 1990.</p>
<p>Rates have been moving higher and higher as Japanese banks
apparently worry that overnight funding supplies will be
exhausted before their needs are met.</p>
<p>"If somebody is afraid that his credit line might be cut
off, he is willing to borrow now to make sure he has the
money he needs at year-end," said Samuel D. Kahan, economist
at Fuji Securities Inc.</p>
<p>Moreover, some lenders have reduced their exposure to
Japanese banks in the interbank funding market and some money
market funds have cut back their purchases of deposits of
Japanese banks.</p>
<p>Reflecting the year-end funding squeeze, one-week
Eurodollar deposits were quoted late last week at 11% bid,
15% asked; one-month Eurodollar deposits were quoted at 10%
bid, 10 1/2% asked.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>Friday's Market Activity</p>
<p>Prices of long-term bonds deteriorated as renewed concerns
about the Middle East prompted investors to sell bonds ahead
of the weekend and New Year's holiday. But some short-term
notes posted modest gains.</p>
<p>The Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond fell 5/8 point, a
loss of about $6.25 for a bond with a $1,000 face amount. The
issue's yield, which moves in the opposite direction of its
price, rose to 8.30% from 8.24%. The benchmark bond was
quoted late Friday at a price of 104 28/32 compared with 105
16/32 on Thursday.</p>
<p>Prices of two-year notes rose slightly to 100 1/32 from
par on Thursday. The yields on the issue fell to 7.20% from
7.23%.</p>
<p>Charges from the Bush Administration that Iraq is blocking
progress in setting up meetings to discuss a resolution of
the Middle East crisis, and ill-founded rumors that shots had
been fired in the Persian Gulf, spurred some selling.</p>
<p>Trading activity was light, partly because of the holiday
season and an East Coast snowstorm that kept many players
away. Most bond dealers closed their trading desks before 3
p.m.</p>
<p>In the corporate bond market, prices were little changed.
For all of 1990, corporate debt sales fell to a five-year
low, according to Securities Data Co. Only $105.6 billion in
corporate debt was sold this year, down 20% from the $134.1
billion in corporate financing last year.</p>
<p>Expectations of lower interest rates kept many corporate
borrowers on the sidelines during the first half of the year,
and a spike in interest rates after Iraq's invasion of Kuwait
stifled issuance in the third quarter.</p>
<p>Only $19.8 billion of corporate debt was sold in the third
quarter, compared with $27.8 billion in the comparable period
last year. But offerings rebounded in the fourth quarter when
falling interest rates sparked a flood of financings.</p>
<p>According to Securities Data, $31.2 billion of corporate
debt was offered in the fourth quarter, a slight dip from the
$33.3 billion sold in the year-earlier period.</p>
