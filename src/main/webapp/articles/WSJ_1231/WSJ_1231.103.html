	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- The Bush administration said it would try to
block on antitrust grounds the acquisition of a U.S.
semiconductor-equipment company by Nippon Sanso KK of Japan.
   The action comes even though President Bush earlier had
approved the deal as posing no threat to national security.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The Justice Department said Friday that it would file a
civil antitrust lawsuit seeking to block the proposed sale by
Hercules Inc. of Wilmington, Del., of its SemiGas Systems
unit to Tokyo-based Nippon Sanso. Critics of the
controversial transaction, including many Democrats in
Congress, have said it would hurt the struggling U.S.
semiconductor industry.</p>
<p>Semi-Gas provides crucial chip-manufacturing services to
Sematech, a Pentagon-supported consortium of U.S.
semiconductor manufacturers and other electronic companies.</p>
<p>A spokesman for Hercules said that the chemical-maker
would fight the Justice Department move. The spokesman,
Robert Hessler, said the company's lawyers had received "only
verbal notification" that the department plans to seek an
injunction. "But based on that, we believe the government's
claim has no merit or basis, and accordingly, Hercules is
prepared to defend any claims brought by the department," he
said. Hercules agreed to sell Semi-Gas for $23 million.</p>
<p>The Justice Department said the proposed sale would
violate federal antitrust law by combining the two leading
producers of gas cabinets in the world and "substantially
{increasing} Semi-Gas Systems' dominant position" in the U.S.
market. Gas cabinets are used to distribute specialty gases
for semiconductor fabrication. The Justice Department didn't
specify in which federal court it planned to file suit or
when it would do so.</p>
<p>The proposed sale "may substantially lessen competition in
the production and sale of gas cabinets in the United
States," said James Rill, the Justice Department's antitrust
chief.</p>
<p>In July, President Bush provoked criticism from
congressional Democrats when he endorsed the sale of Semi-Gas
contingent on certain conditions for protecting sensitive
semiconductor research. Sen. Albert Gore Jr. (D., Tenn.)
attacked the administration for doing a "lackadaisical" job
of screening foreign takeovers of U.S. high-technology
assets. The interagency panel that advises the president on
such takeovers has approved almost every transaction it has
reviewed since late 1988.</p>
<p>Mr. Rill denied that the administration had taken
conflicting positions on foreign takeovers of U.S.
high-technology assets. "The two actions were totally
unrelated," he said. "They do not depend at all on the same
statutes or on the same considerations. . . . This is a very
straightforward {antitrust} case."</p>
<p>A Sematech spokesman praised the Justice Department for
its promised legal action. "Our concern is that another
American technological jewel not fall into the hands of a
foreign competitor," said Mark Nelson, director of government
affairs for the Austin, Texas, consortium. Sematech claims
that Japanese companies currently don't have certain Semi-Gas
technology.</p>
<p>Executives of Semi-Gas earlier had failed to raise enough
money to match Nippon Sanso's offer for the Hercules
subsidiary. A person familiar with the situation said Friday
that in recent months "the employees' group has been trying
to put their deal back together" in an effort to prevent a
takeover by the Japanese company.</p>
