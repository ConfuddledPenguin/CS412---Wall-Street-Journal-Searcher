	<p class="article-leader">Abandoning plans to build additional B-2 Stealth bombers
in 1991, the Air Force instead plans to spend $4.1 billion to
continue assembling and testing only those aircraft already
approved for production.
   The freezing of production at the current level of 15
planes, which is expected to be announced by the Pentagon
shortly, gives B-2 opponents an important political advantage
and increases chances that Congress will permanently cut off
production money for the imperiled bomber during Pentagon
budget debates this spring. The decision is especially
damaging to champions of the bat-shaped bomber in the Senate,
who fought intensely during the summer and fall to save the
program by hammering out compromise language and ensuring
that there would be funds to continue expanding the fleet.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The House voted to bar production of any new planes, and
Rep. Ron Dellums (D., Calif.) and other senior members of the
House Armed Services Committee have threatened to file suit
if the Pentagon crosses that line. Now, Air Force Secretary
Donald Rice has decided to accept the House position and
Defense Secretary Dick Cheney is expected to formally approve
the scaled-back production next month.</p>
<p>While a big chunk of the $4.1 billion approved by Congress
for the current fiscal year will be eaten up by cost overruns
on previously authorized B-2s, prime contractor Northrop
Corp. is trying to play down the significance of the
anticipated lapse in production funding. The company
emphasized that immediate cutbacks in its work force won't be
necessary beacause the assembly line already is working at
reduced speed and can rely on a multibillion-dollar cushion
of previously authorized planes. Oliver Boileau, president
and general manager of Northrop's B-2 division, likens the
effect to "a rubber band {that} just stretches" the
production timetable.</p>
<p>But at the same time, company officials acknowledged that
they are preparing for a do-or-die debate on the B-2. To try
to show that an $850-million-a-copy Stealth bomber remains
relevant in the post-Cold War world, they have come up with a
new presentation to Congress and other groups that stresses
how valuable it would be against Iraqi troops.</p>
<p>The White House originally requested more money for the
B-2 than any other weapons system in fiscal 1991, and it
threatened to veto any defense spending bill that didn't
include production money for new planes. Barely two weeks
ago, some industry insiders were convinced that position
would prevail. But after consulting with the new Air Force
chief of staff and the general who has been named to take
over as the head of the Strategic Air Command, Mr. Rice
decided to throw in the towel on providing seed money for
additional planes in the current fiscal year.</p>
<p>For any manufacturer trying to pin down cost and hiring
schedules, the questions surrounding the B-2 make long-term
planning nearly impossible. "I've never seen a period of
greater uncertainty than we have now," said C.G. King,
executive vice president of Boeing Co.'s military airplanes
division, a major B-2 subcontractor. "It's awfully difficult
to plan."</p>
<p>The B-2 now accounts for more than half of Northrop's
revenue, and building a fleet of 75 B-2s would cost well over
$65 billion. Still, many analysts believe that Northrop and
its B-2 subcontractors would be better off if the Stealth
program were killed outright, rather than dribbling out one
or two planes a year. Cancellation would entitle Northrop to
receive large termination payments, even though it could take
several years to collect them.</p>
<p>Besides mounting problems with the B-2, Northrop faces
cancellation of another of its major defense programs. There
is widespread talk in the Pentagon that the Northop-built
Tacit Rainbow radar-destroying missile, which has performed
poorly in tests, will be killed as part of the
administration's fiscal 1992 budget request.</p>
