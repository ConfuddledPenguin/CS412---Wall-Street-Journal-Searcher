	<p class="article-leader">LIMA, Peru -- Standing before one of the many murals of
Mao Tse-tung that adorn the worn halls of San Marcos
University, Gustavo Buntinx, a Harvard-trained art history
professor with flowing hair and an elegant ascot, begins a
lecture on late "Sendero Luminoso" style.
   He doesn't get far before a dozen students take off like
spooked birds.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>For Sendero Luminoso isn't some Peruvian conceptual
artist. Shining Path, as it is known in English, is a Maoist
political sect that criticizes other Marxist movements by
hanging dogs from lampposts. It also kills people; at least
20,000 have died during its decade-long guerrilla war with
Peru's government. So for students, it's dangerous to be
identified either as pro-Sendero by the police, or as
anti-Sendero by Sendero. "They are caught in the crossfire,"
Prof. Buntinx says of his fleeing students.</p>
<p>Welcome to the University from hell. San Marcos is an
institution with a noble past, a school that claims to be the
oldest university in the Americas. But now, like Peru, it is
caught between guerrillas and security forces. Ill-managed
for years and virtually bankrupt -- also like Peru -- it is
in dire straits. San Marcos University and the changes it has
gone through are a mirror of this troubled country.</p>
<p>Students at San Marcos can't study, many professors don't
teach, and the campus is in tatters. "When you come into San
Marcos, you are hit in the face with the nation's reality,"
says Walter Silvera, a law student. "It's an open wound."</p>
<p>Once-pleasant lawns and gardens of the campus are
reverting to desert. With no money to pay gardeners,
maintenance chief Raul Montesinos has let university workers
turn the grounds into a quilt-work of alfalfa and potato
patches, hoping they will water the sandy soil and thus save
the dying trees. But in Peru, a novel solution like this
could prove a Faustian bargain; Peruvian law says land
belongs to the tiller, and some fear the university's
militant unions may one day literally inherit the earth --
the campus. "San Marcos has no future," says Leon
Trahtemberg, a prominent educator.</p>
<p>It has an illustrious past, though. Founded 439 years ago
by Dominican priests in a Lima convent, San Marcos has over
the centuries been the alma mater of a Who's Who of
distinguished Peruvians. But in the late 1960s, in a process
common in developing countries, it quadrupled enrollment at
the same time as funding was shrinking. This year, amid
hyperinflation, San Marcos's budget came to $300,000, for a
university with some 40,000 students. (The money ran out by
March, and the government kicked in an added $600,000.)</p>
<p>The kind of students coming also changed. Most of the
white creole middle and upper class left, largely replaced by
the mestizo and Indian sons and daughters of peasants and new
migrants to the city, who had crowded into a misery belt of
shantytowns around Lima. During the 1970s, says Rodrigo
Montoya, an anthropologist and San Marcos professor, this new
type of student, sometimes angry and resentful, collided with
a Marxist ideology that identified professors and the
university as class enemies. The result, he says, was that
San Marcos was sacked.</p>
<p>"They stole toilets, basins," says Mr. Montoya, sipping
coffee in his book-lined study. Students evicted the dean of
the school of arts and letters and turned his office into a
classroom. "The feeling was: The university belongs to the
bourgeoisie, let's expropriate it."</p>
<p>And they did. University appointments became the fiefdom
of leftist political parties. University workers didn't work.
Students, treasuring the free medical attention, cafeteria
meals and cheap transportation, stayed on for years. Then
Peru's government, seeing in San Marcos a seedbed of
subversion, slashed its funding. Hyperinflation decimated
what was left.</p>
<p>The result: chaos. Last year, San Marcos's water and
electricity were cut off when the school couldn't come up
with money to pay the bills. For most of this year, power was
off several nights a week because of guerrilla attacks on
electric installations and because of a drought. The
university's 33 libraries can't afford a subscription to a
single foreign journal, full professors are paid about $70 a
month, and books are rare. Most students use photocopied
notes or pirated knockoffs of textbooks published on cheap
paper. Strikes by workers and professors are epidemic.</p>
<p>The campus looks like a battleground. Rusting steel rods
protrude from the unfinished roofs of classroom buildings,
glass facades are punctuated with broken windows, and dark
hallways reek of urine.</p>
<p>As night descends and electricity splutters in San Marcos,
classes may be cut short. In some classrooms, groups of
students huddle like medieval monks around a teacher and a
kerosene lamp while shadows dance on walls.</p>
<p>Graffiti proclamations call, in dense Marxist language,
for a popular war. A hit parade of discredited Communist
prophets -- Mao, Che Guevara, Lenin, Stalin, Marx and Engels
-- stare sternly from the corridors. But the visionary who
casts the longest shadow is Sendero Luminoso's founder,
Abimael Guzman, a one-time philosophy professor at a
provincial college whose bespectacled visage is endlessly
repeated on the walls here. No one is sure whether Mr.
Guzman, whose nom de guerre is "Presidente Gonzalo, the
Fourth Sword of Marxism," is alive or dead.</p>
<p>Besides murals, Sendero does dogs. Twice Mr. Montesinos's
maintenance crews have had to remove dead dogs hung from
light posts, decorated with placards blasting policies in
China or the Soviet Union deemed to be deviations from
Marxism.</p>
<p>In the student dining room on a recent day, a Sendero
activist read excerpts from the movement's clandestine
newspaper over a loudspeaker as students ate. "Only students
and workers allowed," growled an attendant, barring a
visitor.</p>
<p>Working in this environment is rough. "I feel stress,"
concedes Mr. Montesinos. Threats are common, and some years
ago terrorists threw a stick of dynamite at his office,
poking a hole in a wall. "They wanted me to resign," he says.</p>
<p>Studying isn't easy, either. "It's depressing," says
Magali Arellano, poring over her notes. Good students here,
she says, are self-taught.</p>
<p>A professor who is an old Sendero activist estimates that
the guerrilla movement has the sympathy of 20% of San Marcos
students, though many students and faculty members call this
a huge exaggeration. Sendero has contested one election, at
the education faculty, where it won about 10% of the vote.
When hooded Sendero activists stage marches, they never
number more than about 100.</p>
<p>For the rest of Peru, however, the image of the venerable
university now is inextricably woven with that of Sendero and
other radical groups. "Studying in San Marcos is considered a
crime" because of its terrorist image, says Francisco
Mendoza, a slightly built psychology student standing in a
dark hallway as his class meets nearby by the light of a
kerosene lamp. He is missing class this evening because the
feeble light from the lantern hurts his eyes and a candle he
brings to school burnt out earlier.</p>
<p>Three times in three years police have swept through the
campus arresting hundreds of students, later released. Each
time, university officials say, precious lab equipment has
been destroyed and other equipment has vanished. In one raid,
a watchman was shot dead by police, and on another police
killed a student onlooker.</p>
<p>If not quite in Sendero's camp, San Marcos is undoubtedly
attuned to a plethora of leftist groups and causes. A
Christian group named Alpha and Omega publishes a newspaper
called Armageddon and awaits the second coming of a
revolutionary Christ who will wipe out capitalism. A notice
by the biochemistry department urges students to sign up for
the Friedrich Engels Biology Study Group. Outside of the
microbiology lab, where researchers work on new types of
potatoes, a placard hails the "victory of socialism in the
Albanian People's Socialist Republic."</p>
<p>Fidel Castro, viewed in much of the world as an aging
dictator, recently was awarded an honorary degree by the
university. To the purists of Sendero, however, Castro is a
revisionist heretic.</p>
<p>In this maelstrom, the university manages to struggle on.
Research centers somehow keep up their investigations, of
tropical illnesses or of ways to preserve the genes of
threatened plants. Some faculties, like the medical and
veterinary schools, are still considered the best in Peru.
And against all odds, students study.</p>
<p>Some have made a stab at bettering these conditions. They
repainted the accounting department and then put up iron
gates to thwart the graffiti artists, and bought a generator
for blackouts. Other student groups have painted murals to
rescue the walls from Sendero's graffiti and protest the
violence in which Peru, and the university, are mired.</p>
<p>But once out of San Marcos, graduates bear its stigma.
Many private as well as government employers think the
school's graduates are crypto-terrorists, and ill-educated
ones at that. Help-wanted ads in Lima papers sometimes
stipulate that candidates must have degrees from a short list
of prestigious and expensive private universities. (San
Marcos is tuition-free.)</p>
<p>At any rate, there is barely a job market left in Peru.
Four out of five Peruvians are underemployed or unemployed.
Over the last two years the nation's gross national product
has plunged 20%, caught in a precipitous spiral of
hyperinflation that for the last 12 months ran at a rate of
about 8,000%. The new government of President Alberto
Fujimori last August announced an economic austerity program
that, while slashing inflation, spun the economy into a
deeper recession and led to strikes and increased guerrilla
attacks.</p>
<p>Yet for some students, the self-respect attached to having
a college education is what counts. That is the case with
Vitaliano Chanli, a round-faced locksmith from Puno, a
hardscrabble mountain province.</p>
<p>Sitting on a tree trunk reading a book of essays on the
conquest of Peru, Mr. Chanli, a history student, recounts how
his father, an illiterate peasant, brought him to a Lima
shantytown to get an education. An uncle, also illiterate,
lent him money to start his shop. The uncle, a humble man, is
often stiffed by bigshots who look down on him, says Mr.
Chanli, but they can't do that to him.</p>
<p>"Since I have more culture, when the bigshots come, I know
how to treat them," says Mr. Chanli with a wide smile. "We
talk like equals."</p>
