	<p class="article-leader">AVON, Mass. -- Child World Inc., helped by clearance
sales, expects December sales to be "about flat" compared
with last year, said Peter Hayes, its president and chief
executive officer.
   Mr. Hayes, however, declined to disclose a dollar figure,
noting that the company doesn't report monthly sales.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>In the year-earlier fourth quarter, ended Feb. 3, 1990,
Child World reported sales of $404.6 million. Most of that
came from December sales, analysts said.</p>
<p>"The discounts really brought in the traffic," Mr. Hayes
said. "Without the promotion our sales would definitely have
been down." Mr. Hayes estimated that unit sales were up by at
least 10% from last December.</p>
<p>Separately, in an effort to keep Child World from filing
for bankruptcy protection, a committee of the toy retailer's
creditors has urged other unsecured creditors to try to
negotiate a debt repayment plan out of court.</p>
<p>The group, composed of six major U.S. toy makers, said it
"recommends that each unsecured creditor refrain from taking
any precipitous action to hinder the current ongoing
restructuring efforts."</p>
<p>Child World, short on cash, owes approximately $212
million to its vendors. On Dec. 5 it informed toy makers that
it wouldn't be able to pay them until after Jan. 15. But to
keep its shelves well stocked it promised to pay in cash for
any deliveries made in December and the first half of
January.</p>
