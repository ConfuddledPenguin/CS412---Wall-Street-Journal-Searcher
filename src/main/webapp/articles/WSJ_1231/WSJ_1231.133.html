	<p class="article-leader">Chief Justice William Rehnquist urged Congress to make it
more difficult for individuals or businesses to sue one
another in federal court over matters of state law.
   In his annual year-end report on the federal judiciary,
the chief justice also renewed his plea to Congress to make
changes in 1991 in the system of death penalty appeals. He
said federal law should ensure that lawyers are available to
handle the appeals of death row inmates, while "assuring to
the states the necessary degree of finality."</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The first proposal involves what is known as "diversity"
jurisdiction, a federal law that allows lawsuits between
citizens of different states to be filed in federal court,
even though no issue of federal law is involved. In May 1989,
Congress amended the law to require that only disputes
involving at least $50,000 can be considered by federal
courts. This increase -- from $10,000, the amount required
for the previous 30 years -- caused the number of such cases
filed in federal court to drop to 57,000 this year, compared
with 67,000 in 1989, Chief Justice Rehnquist said.</p>
<p>The chief justice proposed that, at the very least,
Congress should raise the threshold to $75,000. He didn't
mention more drastic proposals to throw all such cases out of
federal court and leave them to the state courts, although he
has endorsed broader measures in the past.</p>
<p>His comments on the death penalty reflect his
disappointment that Congress dropped efforts to change the
system of appeals to federal court by death row inmates
convicted in state courts. Many law enforcement officials
blame these appeals, called habeas corpus petitions, for
delaying state executions. Chief Justice Rehnquist has said
the system should be streamlined by setting strict limits on
the number of such appeals and the amount of time after which
they can't be filed. But the proposals became mired in
controversy this year and were dropped from a crime bill.</p>

<p>INSURERS ORDERED to pay defense costs in patent suit.</p>
<p>A federal judge in Los Angeles ordered three insurance
companies to pay $500,000 in attorneys' fees to a company
that is defending itself against a patent infringement suit.</p>
<p>The ruling appears to follow a trend of holding carriers
liable for policyholders' legal expenses in other kinds of
cases.</p>
<p>Lawyers for the company, Intex Plastics Sales Co., Long
Beach, Calif., said the decision will be a boon to companies
seeking relief from costly intellectual property litigation.
"Now people who are sued for patent infringement can remain
in the marketplace because they will have the backing of a
large commercial insurer," said one of the lawyers, Daniel J.
Callahan of Irvine, Calif.</p>
<p>New York patent lawyer Steven D. Glazer said the court's
ruling is likely to encourage similar suits in other states.
"If the trend continues, this could result in insurance
carriers rethinking potential losses and may affect the
reserves they'll have to maintain to cover those losses,
which can only exacerbate problems at insurance companies
already in financial trouble," he said.</p>
<p>The issue arose when Intex, which makes waterbeds, sued
the providers of its commercial general liability policy,
claiming that a clause covering "advertising injury" applied
to legal fees in patent suits. Federal District Judge
Consuelo B. Marshall agreed.</p>
<p>"If I were an insurer with a policy out there like the one
litigated in this case, I'd be having a heart attack right
now," said David J. Lee, a New York patent lawyer who wasn't
involved.</p>
<p>But Mr. Lee noted that federal courts in other states,
including New York, haven't been willing to interpret similar
clauses as broadly, resulting in "an area of major dispute"
likely to be resolved only at the appellate court level.</p>
<p>Lawyers for the insurance companies, United National
Insurance Co., First State Insurance Co., and New England
Reinsurance Co., couldn't be reached for comment.</p>

<p>WIDOW CAN BE DENIED federal aid for lack of a marriage
license, court rules.</p>
<p>A federal appeals court ruled that the Social Security
Administration properly canceled federal widow benefits that
were being paid to a 74-year-old New York woman who had lived
with her husband for 47 years.</p>
<p>The woman, Gertrude Thomas, began receiving the benefits
when her husband died in 1985. But a year later the Social
Security Department concluded that her marriage had been
invalid because evidence of a marriage ceremony couldn't be
found and because Joseph Thomas apparently had never divorced
his first wife.</p>
<p>The U.S. Second Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that
federal law does allow benefits to be paid to a widow whose
marriage turns out to have been invalid -- but only if a
marriage ceremony was held. Living as common-law husband and
wife for 47 years -- and having 10 children, as in Ms.
Thomas's case -- doesn't qualify the woman for benefits, the
court in Manhattan said.</p>
<p>Ms. Thomas said the marriage was performed by a minister
in Georgia in 1938 when she was 21 and Mr. Thomas was 45, but
she couldn't prove it. She told officials that she never
verified whether a marriage license was issued "because I was
quite young at the time and I just took what {Mr. Thomas}
said to be true."</p>
<p>The appeals-court panel said the 1960 law covering the
benefits fails to mention widows of common-law marriages.</p>
<p>Some states grant extensive rights to common-law spouses.
But the court said Congress may have "believed that persons
who have doubts about whether a prior marriage has been
validly ended will be more reluctant to go through a marriage
ceremony than they will to enter into an informal
cohabitational relationship."</p>
<p>Ms. Thomas's attorneys couldn't be reached for comment.</p>

<p>SEXUAL HARASSMENT suit filed by EEOC is settled by law
firm.</p>
<p>The U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission sued
Paul, Hastings, Janofsky & Walker in October for alleged
sexual discrimination in the Los Angeles firm's New York
office. The civil suit, filed in federal court in Manhattan,
alleged that women employees were subjected to sexual
harassment and threats, and then punished for complaining to
partners at the firm.</p>
<p>Under the settlement, the firm didn't admit any
wrongdoing, but agreed to fully abide by federal
sexual-discrimination laws. The law firm also agreed to
provide training about the problem of sexual harassment to
all its attorneys. Other details about the settlement weren't
disclosed.</p>
<p>"The matter has been satisfactorily resolved," said Paul
Hastings partner Dennis H. Vaughn.</p>

<p>COLUMBIA LAW faculty selects new dean.</p>
<p>The faculty of Columbia University School of Law chose
Harvard Law School Prof. Lance M. Liebman, 49 years old, to
succeed Dean Barbara A. Black, who announced in April that
she would step down at the end of the academic year to return
to teaching and research at Columbia.</p>
<p>A Columbia spokesman confirmed that the dean search
committee had relayed a faculty recommendation to the
university president but declined to comment further. The
spokesman said the president and the board of trustees must
still approve the selection.</p>
<p>Columbia has traditionally chosen its dean from within the
school's ranks. The two other finalists were Columbia
professors Harvey J. Goldschmid and Peter L. Strauss,
according to people familiar with the process.</p>
<p>Vincent A. Blasi, a professor and chairman of the dean
search committee, said he couldn't comment while the process
is under way.</p>
<p>Mr. Liebman has been a professor at Harvard since 1970. He
began teaching there three years after graduating from the
law school. He teaches employment and property law and was
associate dean of the law school from 1981 to 1984. Mr.
Liebman declined to comment.</p>
