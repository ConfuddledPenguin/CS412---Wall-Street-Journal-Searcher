	<p class="article-leader">Congress has done such a wonderful job regulating the
Savings and Loan industry that some Members now want the
federal government to take charge of regulating the insurance
industry as well. If this happens, no insurance policy at any
price will protect premium holders or taxpayers from the kind
of congressional "constituent services" that made Charles
Keating a household name.
   Insurance remains regulated primarily by the states, which
so offends Rep. John Dingell and Senator Howard Metzenbaum
that they have held hearings on the effrontery. Senator
Donald Riegle, of Keating Five fame, now urges Treasury to
jump on the federal-regulation bandwagon. Their argument for
a federal takeover of state regulation is, believe it or not,
that only the feds can regulate such a complex industry.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The word from state insurance commissioners and insurance
executives is that congressional staffers are busily crafting
new legislation to be introduced early next year to reverse a
half-century of regulation at the state level. Among the
proposals is a new federal agency to totally replace state
regulators.</p>
<p>A possibly likelier proposal is just as dubious. This is
the potent combination of giving the federal government new
oversight over the solvency of property, casualty and life
insurers while the states would continue to regulate
insurance prices.</p>
<p>Ralph Nader groups and the trial lawyers are the biggest
boosters of the idea that the feds should regulate solvency
while the states regulate prices. It's easy to see why. This
would give states new incentives to mandate cuts in insurance
premiums -- as several states have done with auto insurance
-- regardless of the economic realities or tort-system
problems that insurers face.</p>
<p>Indeed, there would be a race to the bottom as each state
made sure its residents got lower premiums, solvency of the
insurers be damned. Why worry about solvency if that's
Washington's problem? A series of legislated price cuts in
the states would lead to a real solvency crisis for insurers
that the feds would then have to "solve." Indeed, this
Keystone Kops system of regulation would be a recipe for
another S&L fiasco.</p>
<p>The better argument is that there is little likelihood of
an S&L-style debacle for insurers unless Washington gets more
involved in regulating them. There are enormous differences
between thrifts and insurance firms. Insurers have no
equivalent to the taxpayer-guaranteed deposits that
encouraged thrifts to make high-risk loans. There is no
parallel with the dead-of-night jump to a $100,000 guarantee
per deposit.</p>
<p>There is little reason to think the feds would do a better
job of regulating insurers than do the states, which recently
created new guidelines on capital requirements. State
insurance commissioners have also developed methods for
forcing healthy insurers to take some responsibility for
troubled insurers. This gives insurers incentives to
self-regulate their industry in ways that were never created
for the thrifts.</p>
<p>There is no denying difficulties in the insurance
industry. It's doubtful, though, that Congress will solve any
of the problems. The immediate problem facing many insurers
is troubled commercial mortgages in the soft real estate
market, with a few insurers also posting losses from the
regulatory attack on junk bonds. There have been insurance
insolvencies in past recessions, but insurance analysts doubt
we will have any major calamity.</p>
<p>There is a well-known, longer-term problem facing
insurers, but there's little hope that Congress will do
anything about it. This is that our incompetent legal system
makes writing insurance a very risky business. If anyone
still doubts that there is a relationship between the
breakdown in the rule of law and problems in the insurance
industry, take note that even the insurers have decided they
need insurance. Lloyd's of London recently announced that
enormous liabilities from the U.S. had forced it to form a
separate reinsurance fund. The idea is that its members will
join together to spread the risk against by-now expected but
wholly unpredictable long-term liability from U.S. pollution,
asbestos and malpractice claims.</p>
<p>Someone needs to start to make sense of America's
unpredictable liability system. It should be possible for
insurers to correctly price premiums to reflect potential
liabilities. With its trial-lawyer lobby, however, Congress
has declared itself part of the problem and not the solution.
Legislators have defeated all tort reform proposals in recent
years.</p>
<p>More broadly, if the Keating hearings are teaching us
anything, it is that asking Congress to regulate an industry
has become asking foxes to watch over hens. Nothing in the
S&L disaster argues for more federal regulation of a
financial industry. On the contrary, the presumption against
new federal regulatory powers has become well-nigh
overwhelming.</p>
