	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- The Jacob K. Javits Convention Center offers
trade-show exhibitors a chance to tap the nation's largest
marketplace. Owned and operated by a New York state
authority, it attracts three million visitors a year.
   But businesses find that displaying their wares at the
center can be a profit-draining ordeal. They complain of
rising theft of merchandise and of unions' power to impose
restrictive work rules that drive up costs. To circumvent the
union restrictions, some contractors that exhibitors use may
feel forced to resort to illegal payoffs.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The unions' grip on the Javits exhibition business could
be eased, however, by a criminal investigation quietly
launched recently by Manhattan District Attorney Robert
Morgenthau. He is inquiring into whether union officials at
Javits are taking illegal payoffs from trade-show contractors
to guarantee labor peace and circumvent the costly work
rules.</p>
<p>Investigators also are trying to determine how much
influence the mob wields at the center, which is the site of
the 1992 Democratic Party convention, and whether
contractors, in the interest of labor harmony, hire "ghosts,"
or people who collect pay but don't work.</p>
<p>The trade-show contractors, most of whom are retained by
the exhibitors, hire carpenters to install the booths,
Teamsters to unload the freight, and exposition workers to
move the freight to the booths. The electricians, who supply
the power lines and connect equipment to outlets, are
employed by a contractor retained by Javits. The exhibitors
are billed by the contractors for labor charges incurred.</p>
<p>Two large contractors say their payroll records have been
subpoenaed. Michael Cherkasky, chief of the district
attorney's rackets bureau, says, "We're not commenting on a
pending investigation."</p>
<p>Although Javits enjoys a high 83% occupancy rate, at least
one trade show already has abandoned the center. The National
Shoe Fair, with 1,200 exhibitors, is moving to Chicago's
McCormick Place. The shoe fair's last show at Javits was last
August when labor costs and rental rates for the Javits show
totaled $1 million, according to Edward Launzel, show
manager. Labor-rental rates at McCormick Place will be an
estimated 15% less. "It costs too much to be in New York,"
Mr. Launzel says, noting that street crime and steep hotel
and restaurant rates also figured in the decision to abandon
New York.</p>
<p>Michael Hough, operator of A/E/C Systems, a trade-show
management company in Newington, Conn., sounded out
exhibitors about the New York and Chicago trade show centers.
Mr. Hough says: "Our exhibitor surveys have said, `Chicago is
bad, but New York is even worse. Please don't take the show
to New York.'"</p>
<p>Four key unions service Javits Center: Teamsters Local
807, Exposition Workers 829, the New York City District
Council of Carpenters and Electrical Workers Local 3.</p>
<p>"We're aware of the investigation," says John Hohmann, the
Teamster local's secretary-treasurer. "But there's no problem
as far as any official of 807 is concerned. We enforce the
contract we have." The exposition and electrical workers
unions failed to respond to repeated requests for comment.</p>
<p>In September, the U.S. Attorney's office in Manhattan
filed a civil racketeering suit against the 30,000-member
District Council of Carpenters, asserting that the labor
group is controlled by the Genovese crime family. The
complaint, charging that "illegal payoffs have become
virtually a way of life in the New York carpentry industry,"
seeks to replace District Council officers with a
court-appointed trusteeship. The carpenters council has
denounced the federal charges as baseless and hadn't any
comment on the Morgenthau investigation.</p>
<p>Whether union officials are taking payoffs to bend the
work rules isn't known. What's clear is that Javits
exhibitors believe the work rules are cutting into their
profits.</p>
<p>Says a computer-software exhibitor: "I had a small booth
in 1988 that I could have set up myself in an hour and a
half. Instead, I had to have three men -- two to set it up
and one to hang a picture, clean the booth, and stand around
and run errands. These extra labor costs -- you have to make
it up in sales."</p>
<p>A wristwatch exhibitor describes his problems with the
electricians. "It takes just a couple of minutes to plug an
extension cord from the showcase into an outlet," the
exhibitor says. "Yet the union says I must hire an
electrician for it. At the February and June shows this year,
I paid for an electrician, though I wasn't happy about it. At
the September show, I plugged it in myself -- the night
before the show opened. The union guy came by, saw my
showcase lights were on, and asked who switched me on. I
didn't answer. He looked at the (electrical) box and said it
didn't look like the union did it. I didn't say anything.
Next morning, I came in an hour before the show opened. My
electricity was off. So I paid. Then a strange thing
happened. At the end of the show, they gave me back the
money. Was it because I bitched? I don't know."</p>
<p>Tony Calanca, vice president of operations for Cahners
Exposition Group, a trade-show organizer based in Stamford,
Conn., points to low productivity. "We had a customer at one
of our computer shows who had a booth in New York and
Chicago. In Chicago, it took 50% of the electrical hours to
set up the same booth as it took" at Javits, Mr. Calanca
says.</p>
<p>Labor rates at Javits, with few exceptions, are the
highest in the industry. Rates for electricians are $78.50 an
hour (straight time), compared with Las Vegas' $62, Chicago's
$55, the Los Angeles area's $45, and Atlanta's $28, according
to Tradeshow Week, an industry publication, in a survey. (The
rates include workers' wages and benefits and contractors'
profit and expenses.)</p>
<p>Javits Center officials are aware of exhibitors' gripes.
Benjamin C. La Rosa, vice president of operations and labor
management, says Sol Chaikin, Javits' chairman and acting
president and the onetime president of the International
Ladies Garment Workers Union, recently met with more than 50
union officials to discuss productivity and employee honesty.
"Chaikin said, `We're in a competitive world, and we need
your help to stay competitive,'" Mr. La Rosa says.</p>
<p>Marcello Svedese, former financial secretary for New York
Carpenters Local 17, says in a court affidavit that mob
associates receive carpenters' union jobs at Javits. The
jobs, he says, involve easy work at overtime rates and offer
the "opportunity to make even more money by shaking down
exhibitors, theft, and other rackets." The Svedese affidavit
is filed with the federal complaint against the Carpenters
District Council.</p>
<p>Ralph Coppola, a Genovese Family associate, wields great
power at Javits Center as chief steward for the Carpenters
District Council, according to the federal complaint and the
Svedese affidavit. By controlling job assignments, the
complaint says, the district council can saddle employers
with disruptive and unskilled workers, raising the threat of
costly delays.</p>
<p>Federal documents accompanying the complaint say Mr.
Coppola was imprisoned in New York for arson for nearly two
years and was paroled in March 1987. In November 1988, he was
appointed chief steward by Paschal McGuinness, district
council president. Mr. McGuinness, a defendant in the federal
complaint, didn't do anything wrong, according to the
carpenters union. Mr. Coppola, who isn't a defendant,
couldn't be reached for comment.</p>
<p>Investigators are seeking evidence on whether the mob is
involved in the increased number of thefts at Javits.</p>
<p>Early last month, two members of the Exposition Workers
were arrested on charges of theft and possession of $23,000
of crystal and glassware taken from gift shows at Javits. One
of the defendants confided to an informant "that he can
easily steal at any time from (Javits), and that he has
committed a number of thefts of freight and merchandise,"
says the felony complaint, filed in Manhattan criminal court.</p>
<p>The police department's 10th Precinct, which has
jurisdiction over Javits, says exhibitors reported 115 felony
thefts in the first nine months, a 13% rise from 102 thefts
in the 1989 period. The value of the merchandise stolen in
the 1990 period declined, however, to $639,161 from
$1,234,559 a year earlier.</p>
