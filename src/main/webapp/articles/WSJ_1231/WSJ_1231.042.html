	<p class="article-leader">TOKYO -- Japan's seasonally adjusted jobless rate in
November was 2.1% of the labor force, down from 2.2% in
October, the statistics bureau of the prime minister's office
reported Friday.
   The bureau said there were 62.98 million jobholders in
November, an increase of 1.19 million workers, or 1.9%,
compared with the same month a year earlier.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>November's decline in unemployment contrasts with
October's 1.5% year-on-year increase in the number of
jobless. October's figure had marked the first year-on-year
increase in the number of unemployed since October of 1987.</p>
<p>November's figures indicate that Japan's labor market
remains tight. Officials at the Bank of Japan frequently cite
the need to combat inflationary pressures as they defend the
central bank's tight monetary policy.</p>
<p>In November, 1.26 million people were unemployed, and the
decrease by 70,000 people from a year earlier represented a
5.3% decline, the bureau said.</p>
