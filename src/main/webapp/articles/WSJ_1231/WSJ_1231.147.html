	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- A New York real estate developer and its
Japanese partner resolved a dispute that had stalled
construction of a $400 million Manhattan office building for
a year, but it remains unclear which partner will eventually
own the building.
   Under the agreement reached Friday, the Japanese partner,
KG Land New York Corp., ceded its controlling interest in
Americas Tower to its partner, New York Land Corp., which is
controlled by the Bernstein family. The dispute was before an
independent arbitration panel when agreement was reached.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>KG, a subsidiary of Kumagai Gumi Co., a big Tokyo
construction and development firm, obtained an option to buy
the building outright through an affiliate for "fair market
value." It must exercise the option between Jan. 4 and Jan.
31.</p>
<p>The accord should give financially troubled KG Land time
to find financing to finish the million-square-foot project,
which is three-quarters completed.</p>
<p>Last December, after investing $180 million on the
building's construction, KG moved to force the project into
bankruptcy proceedings, apparently because the reputation of
its partner had hindered efforts to secure the necessary
financing. That didn't succeed, so the dispute went to
arbitration.</p>
<p>The Bernsteins had been entangled in numerous legal
battles surrounding the U.S. holdings of the late Philippine
dictator Ferdinand Marcos and his wife Imelda. The Bernsteins
had represented the Marcoses in their Manhattan real estate
investments.</p>
<p>Under the settlement, KG Land's interest in the
partnership will drop from 60% to "substantially" less than
50%, according to New York lawyer Henry Bubel, who
represented the Bernsteins.</p>
