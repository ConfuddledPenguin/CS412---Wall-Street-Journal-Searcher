	<p class="article-leader">TOKYO -- Japan's financial behemoths may look scary to
foreign competitors, but at home they show a different face.
   At the main entrance of the Industrial Bank of Japan
Ltd.'s austere, wedgeshaped headquarters in Tokyo,
stone-faced security guards stand toe-to-toe with
three-foot-tall Kewpie dolls.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The plump, rosy-faced cherubs with swirled topknots and
ambiguous gender beam cheerfully at passers-by from mounted
glass boxes. They're an odd match for the hard-driving
lender, the world's seventh-largest bank in terms of assets.
"We use Kewpie because it's cute," says Hiroyuki Komiya,
manager of the bank's public relations section, explaining
how the dolls help Industrial Bank promote its fixed-interest
savings products.</p>
<p>Unlike big financial companies of Western nations, which
spend millions of dollars on advertisements calculated to
project images of prudence and sobriety, Japan's banks,
securities brokers and insurance companies like to keep
things light.</p>
<p>Among the other distinguished celebrities who represent
the giants of Japanese finance: Mickey and Minnie Mouse,
occasional spokesmice for Mitsubishi Bank; the Little Prince,
the official mascot of the world's biggest brokerage firm,
Nomura Securities Co.; Pee Wee Herman, ringmaster of a kooky
children's television show and commercial standard-bearer for
Wako Securities Co.; and Bugs Bunny, who tells television
viewers what's up at Aizawa Securities Co.</p>
<p>Robert Wilk, managing director of Infoplan, a marketing
research arm of McCann-Erickson Hakuhodo Inc., says: "The
basic object of these campaigns is to add some warmth to the
institution. It's not as silly as it seems."</p>
<p>Mammoth Mitsui Taiyo-Kobe Bank Co., the world's
second-largest, is represented by British storybook character
Paddington Bear. The bear's furry visage turns up on
depositors' passbooks, as well as the barrage of posters,
calendars, handkerchiefs and coin banks Mitsui Taiyo-Kobe
hands out to savers as gifts.</p>
<p>Of course, cuddly isn't everything. A few smaller Japanese
institutions seem willing to settle for silly. Earlier this
year, Wako Securities, a medium-sized securities firm, began
airing 30-second TV spots starring Pee Wee Herman. In the
commercials, a bow-tie-clad Mr. Herman careens madly across
the screen in a midget-sized car, crooning to the melody of
"Old McDonald Had a Farm." "Pee Wee Herman having fun]
Ee-ai-ee-ai-oo]" he intones in his trademark nasal whine.</p>
<p>Wako's wackier image also has made it easier to recruit
new employees -- a big bonus in a nation where the lack of
manpower is acute. Prospective hires seem to like the idea of
working at "Pee Wee's company," a Wako official says.</p>
<p>In theory, what works for Japanese financial institutions
should work for foreign firms, too, Japanese advertising
experts say. But so far Merrill Lynch & Co., the only foreign
securities firm with a retailing operation in Japan, seems
reluctant to adopt the marketing techniques of local rivals.
The Japanese unit sticks to the logo of the bull used in the
U.S.</p>
<p>"I don't know if the image of the bull means the same here
as it does in the United States," worries Toru Ichikawa,
manager for public affairs at Merrill's Tokyo office. In
fact, he confides, most Japanese investors see the creature
as "just a big farm animal," and some of them even may think
the bull suggests "something that is slow or stupid."</p>
<p>Recently, a few of Japan's financial giants have tried to
lend their advertising campaigns a bit more sophistication.
Recently Daiwa Securities Co., flubbed its attempt to launch
a campaign using Nobel Prize-winning American economist Harry
Markowitz, an adviser to the company.</p>
<p>Soon after Prof. Markowitz was named as one of this year's
Nobel recipients, Daiwa took out newspaper ads boasting,
"We've got Nobel Prize-winning intelligence ready to work for
you." Prof. Markowitz was irked by the ads and a
mistranslated newspaper report that suggested -- incorrectly,
Daiwa officials say -- the Japanese broker had named a new
investment product the "Nobel Fund."</p>
<p>While collecting his prize in Stockholm, Prof. Markowitz
announced that he would not renew his contract with the
powerful brokerage firm, in part, he said, because its
advertisements were "not sufficiently tasteful."</p>
