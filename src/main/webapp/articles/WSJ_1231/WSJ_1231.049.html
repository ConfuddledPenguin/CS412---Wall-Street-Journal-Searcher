	<p class="article-leader">What is federalism? Conservative and liberal intellectual
contributions to the debate about Europe's future have been
so weak that the concept of federal union has become almost
irredeemably associated with the enlargement of central
power, rather than its diffusion, and with stronger rather
than more limited central institutions.
   Yet federalism ought to mean, and once used to mean, quite
the opposite of what it has come to imply. A century or more
of blind faith in collectivist government, and the powerful
intervening state, have caused us to lose sight of the older
view and purpose of federal structures. This was that the
member states or units of a federation should delegate only a
few and the most carefully circumscribed powers to the
federal body, and that these powers could be altered or
reclaimed as circumstances changed.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Yet the authors of the proposals for European Community
development aired in Rome seem to have overlooked all this.
Their mindset remains determinedly centralist. Many more
powers over social policy, greatly extended inter-regional
transfers, many more decisions to be taken by majority vote
among ministers -- these things lead "inevitably" to a far
stronger and larger commission and a stronger European
Parliament to control it. An imposed single currency can only
add to the mounting activities of EC officialdom.</p>
<p>In short, we have here the recreation of the familiar 20th
century bureaucratic nation state, but on a Leviathan scale.</p>
<p>Constant complaints that Europe is an economic giant and a
political pygmy, and that it must somehow develop to be on a
par with the U.S. and Japan, confirm all too clearly where
these ideas are intended to lead. But monolithic Europe would
be the last great folly of the 20th century, hustled into
existence at the very moment when such concepts are withering
everywhere else.</p>
<p>A monolithic Soviet Union is collapsing before our eyes.
Eventually a more modern and looser confederation will have
to replace it (and we will all face great dangers in Europe
until it does). A much-too-centralized U.S. is stumbling
along, but as Professor James Buchanan has pointed out in his
dazzling essay "Europe's Constitutional Future," (published
by the Institute of Economic Affairs, London) American
federalism has become "a mockery." Feelings are growing that
a century of power-drift to the center should be reversed and
the old wisdom of James Madison and others, from a
pre-collectivist-socialist age, revisited.</p>
<p>At this point in history Europe therefore has a golden
chance to be different -- to maximize the enormous benefits
of economic integration, as offered by the Single Market, but
without repeating all the errors, or the vanities and
conceits, of the collectivist epoch.</p>
<p>The Single Market idea looks like it works (although we
are not there yet) precisely because it came to be based,
after a shaky start, on market and competitive principles
rather than socialist-centralist ones. It sought to create
competition based on variety and diversity between industries
and nation states, and not on sameness. But the ambitious new
encroachments on national diversity now proposed by the
"federalists" seem to have ignored this lesson. Instead they
re-embrace the old Adam of the socialist, redistributive
state, but recast in a European mold.</p>
<p>Stretching this mutated (and outdated) "federalism," not
just to social and monetary policy, but to defense and
foreign affairs, is a recipe for even greater weakness.
Experience in the Gulf vividly confirms that while a European
voice is useful on certain world issues, when it comes to
action a collective European stance on all foreign policy
would be a policy of indecision -- a lowest common
denominator of agreement to disagree. On external defense
issues this would apply even more strongly.</p>
<p>Yet Europe may be saved from the paralysis that this sort
of federalism promises by three factors:</p>
<p>First, Margaret Thatcher's departure changes the whole
context of the European debate. Mrs. Thatcher certainly
identified the European issues clearly -- perhaps too
clearly. Too often her presence seemed to polarize the debate
fruitlessly between sovereignty and supra-nationalism. Now
that she has gone Europe's policy-makers have no option but
to square up with vigor to the real issue, which is whether
they want a federation (or confederacy) of nation-states or a
federated nation state. This is an issue of deepest
constitutional significance that cannot be by-passed by
references to the elastic concept of subsidiarity.</p>
<p>Second, the head-on collision in the GATT talks between
agricultural subsidy and freer world trade ought to awaken
Europe to the dangers of further doses of centrally
administered protectionism. Quite the wrong lesson to be
drawn from this saga is that Brussels needs a still tighter
hold on farm policy in Europe. The right lesson is that
individual nations should support their rural economies in
varied ways and liberalize their food trade not through
coordinated inertia but as and when they separately so wish.
A truly competitive federal Europe would have repatriated
much of this kind of policy away from the centralizers, long
ago.</p>
<p>Third, the opening of Eastern Europe and the fierce
commitment of the post-communist governments there to market
forces may push the protectionists of the EC firmly onto the
defensive. If the new democracies are to succeed they will
have to be offered by the EC something far more liberal and
diffuse then the centralist menu of CAP, common social policy
and single money. A continent in change will need a different
and more supple kind of federal union.</p>
<p>Like almost every other global issue, the European unity
debate has now been overtaken by the revolutionary events of
1989. It is no longer a matter of faster or slower movement
towards an "inevitable" central government of Europe, with
only a few nationalist laggards obstructing the advance.
Instead, a historic debate opens about the best
constitutional structure of Europe for the next century.</p>
<p>There has been nothing like it since the founding of the
U.S. Even now, the dominance of past collective thinking is
so great that the need for such a debate to begin is denied
by some, or dismissed as a mere hang-up caused by the insular
British. But begun it has, if very belatedly. And we shall
see now whose kind of federal union prevails -- the kind that
concentrates more and more power in strong central hands or
the kind that spreads power in a new age of diffusion, the
kind that closes Europe or the kind that opens it.</p>
<p>It is nothing less than a struggle between the 20th and
the 21st century for Europe's soul.</p>
