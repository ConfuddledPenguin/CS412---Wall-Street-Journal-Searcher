	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- The U.S. should experience "continuing but
slow growth" in most sectors, the Commerce Department said in
its annual industrial outlook.
   "Overall, we see continued growth in 1991 for the majority
of industries, both manufacturing and services," said J.
Michael Farren, undersecretary for international trade.
Exports, which represented more than 70% of sluggish U.S.
growth in the first three quarters of 1990, will partly
counteract weakness in other aspects of the U.S. economy, he
added.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The growth rate for all industries covered by the survey,
however, is expected to slow slightly to 1.13% from 1.38%,
according to Jonathan C. Menes, director of the department's
office of finance, industry and trade information. But since
the report was prepared, many private economists, who say the
country is in a recession, have become increasingly
pessimistic about the country's economic prospects.</p>
<p>The study, a series of forecasts for specific industries
prepared by more than 100 department analysts, makes certain
assumptions about the future of the U.S. economy. In
particular, it assumes that real growth in 1991 will be
between 1% and 3%, with the "most likely case being growth at
the lower end of that range." In the first three quarters of
1990, economic growth averaged about 1.3%.</p>
<p>Among manufacturing businesses, the report said most of
the high-technology and health-related industries will
continue to outperform the rest of the economy. It forecasts
8.9% growth in 1991 in the semiconductor and related
industries and expects computer industry shipments to
increase by 6% during the year. Medical instruments, supplies
and appliance businesses also are projected to grow at rates
of between 7% and 9% in 1991. Leather tanning and finishing,
with a projected 9.4% growth rate in 1991, should outperform
most manufacturing businesses.</p>
<p>But there are laggards as well. Motor vehicles and
construction "will experience negative growth" in 1991, Mr.
Farren said. Manufacturers of butter, mobile homes and frozen
baked goods -- other than bread -- will be hit particularly
hard, the report said.</p>
<p>The aircraft industry, including engines and parts --
which was the boom manufacturing business during the past
year -- will experience a 4.6% growth rate in 1991, down
sharply from 17.9% in 1990. But the aerospace industry is
expected to have a record 1991 trade surplus of $31 billion,
up from more than $28 billion in 1990. Machine tool
production also is expected to continue to be strong, with a
predicted 5% growth rate in 1991, after a 5.3% rise in 1990.</p>
<p>In service industries, the strongest sectors will be
electronic information, computer software and data
processing, with revenues growing as much as between 16% and
20%, according to the report.</p>
<p>Despite the report's predictions for continued sluggish
growth, many private economists paint an even gloomier
picture. They say the economy is in a recession, with no
guarantee that it will perk up before late 1991. Recession is
commonly defined by economists as at least two consecutive
quarters of negative growth.</p>
<p>Generally, the Commerce Department's industrial outlook is
based partly on midsummer economic projections released by
the Office of Management and Budget. This year, however, the
Aug. 2 Iraqi invasion of Kuwait, with the subsequent turmoil
in oil and other markets, forced the department to use a
revised set of economic assumptions prepared in August. In
general, the department's analysts "assumed that the economy
would avoid a recession, though a soft economic environment
would persist into the first half of 1991, followed by a
gradual pickup," according to J. Antonio Villamil, the
department's chief economist.</p>
<p>The report's assumptions project an inflation rate of
between 4% and 4.5% for 1991, down slightly from 4.5% to 5%
in 1990. They also assume a slight reduction in interest
rates, with the Treasury bill rate falling to between 6.8% to
7.2% in 1991, from between 7.2% to 7.5% in 1990, while the
10-year Treasury note rate would fall to a 1991 range of 8.0%
to 8.5% from between 8.5% to 9.0% in 1990. According to the
report, the unemployment rate may pick up slightly to between
5.5% to 6.5% in 1991 from between 5.5% and 6% in 1990. The
report also assumed a 1991 oil price of $25 a barrel.</p>
<p>These projections, which were prepared in recent months,
are already somewhat dated. The administration will soon
release its economic report of the president, which will
include more current economic forecasts for 1991.</p>
