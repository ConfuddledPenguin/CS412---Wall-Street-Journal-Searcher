	<p class="article-leader">ROCKVILLE, Md. -- W. Bell & Co., citing mounting losses
because of weak sales, filed for protection from creditors
under Chapter 11 of the federal Bankruptcy Code.
   The catalog showroom retailer said its third-quarter loss
widened to $5.8 million, or $1.53 a share, from $833,000, or
22 cents a share, a year earlier. Revenue fell 22% to $15.7
million from $20.2 million.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>W. Bell shares plunged in reaction to the announcement. In
over-the-counter trading Friday, the stock fell 75 cents to
close at 50 cents a share. It had been trading as high as $4
a share earlier this year.</p>
<p>The company said the Chapter 11 filing will enable the
company to continue operating while it works with creditors
to develop a plan to pay back debt. Martin Pfeifer,
treasurer, said the company had about $4.9 million in
long-term debt. It listed assets of $40.7 million and
liabilities of $33.5 million.</p>
<p>Despite the filing, the company said normal customer
services and store operations such as store hours, credit
card charges, merchandise returns and gift certificate
redemptions would continue as usual for its retail business.</p>
<p>The filing, made with the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in
Rockville, Md., follows an offer by Hong Kong-based Venture
Link Co. to acquire all W. Bell shares outstanding. The
offer, which was valued at between $8.6 million and $10.5
million in October, is still pending, the company said.</p>
