	<p class="article-leader">TORONTO -- BCE Development Corp. said it would stop paying
interest to holders of its unsecured debentures to convince
senior creditors in the U.S. to accept smaller debt-service
payments.
   The real-estate development concern, which is 67%-owned by
BCE Inc., a diversified holding company based in Montreal,
also said it wanted to channel all its financial resources
into completing several major projects, including the huge
BCE Place office tower in downtown Toronto.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>BCE Development, which had a loss last year of 710 million
Canadian dollars (US$611 million) after writing down C$550
million in property assets, said it plans to present a full
debt-restructuring proposal to its creditors next spring.
Under the proposal, the company said it expects to offer
lenders up to 20% of the equity in its main operating unit,
Brookfield Development Corp., in exchange for retiring debt.</p>
<p>In the meantime, BCE Development said the cash flow
generated by its properties isn't sufficient to cover
debt-service payments. Edwin Nordholm, senior vice president
and general counsel at BCE Development, said most of the
company's creditors have agreed to accept payments below that
called for in lending agreements. But he said agreements to
accept reduced payments still need to be reached with "one or
two" senior lenders. These lenders complained that junior
creditors hadn't made similar sacrifices, prompting the
company to cut off interest payments to its debenture
holders, he said.</p>
<p>"By and large, we're pretty confident most of the lenders
are looking to do a deal with us," Mr. Nordholm said. He
wouldn't identify the creditors except to say most of them
were U.S. insurance companies. He said the company's
remaining problem properties are in Denver and in Minneapolis
and St. Paul, Minn.</p>
<p>BCE Development said it wouldn't pay interest due Dec. 31
on its 8% debentures, saving roughly C$4 million. It also
said it was "unlikely" to pay C$1.4 million in interest on
its 10.75% debentures, due April 30. The company said it
would call a meeting with the trustees of the debenture
holders to explain its position.</p>
<p>Mr. Nordholm said the decision to end interest payments on
the debentures wasn't forced by the company's major financial
backers, BCE and Carena Developments Ltd., a real-estate
developer controlled by Toronto financiers Peter and Edward
Bronfman. The two companies have provided a secured credit
facility of up to C$700 million to BCE Development to finish
construction of various projects. About C$550 million of the
facility has been used so far, Mr. Nordholm said.</p>
<p>In September, BCE Development said the two backers might
restrict the funds from being used to meet debt obligations.
But Mr. Nordholm said the credit facility is still being used
to supplement cash flow from certain properties in order to
meet debt-service payments. At one of its properties, this is
costing BCE Development C$1 million a month, he said.</p>
<p>BCE and Carena have agreed to convert much of their loan
into equity under a previously reported rights offering of
Brookfield shares scheduled for next June. A separate issue
of Brookfield warrants, representing up to 20% of the
subsidiary's equity, will probably be used to settle debt
from other creditors, Mr. Nordholm said.</p>
