	<p class="article-leader">WEST CHESTER, Pa. -- Molly Daly's television show doesn't
begin until midnight, but the lateness of the hour hardly
deters her hard-core fans. Don't leap to conclusions. The
sauciest things about this show are saucepans. Until 3 a.m.
most mornings, Ms. Daly's fans watch and listen while she
tries to sell cosmetics, luggage, jewelry, clothing,
appliances and other such goods.
   Ms. Daly, 34 years old, is the not-quite-perfect shopping
hostess in the not-quite-prime-time slot on QVC ("Quality,
Value, Convenience") Shopping Network, a growing,
24-hour-a-day cable enterprise that beams live into 38
million homes. Tonight, she wipes some lipstick off her
orthodontic braces, mops spilled soda from her note cards and
snags her suit on a chair as she delivers her pitch.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The first tonight is for a Cobra answering machine that
sells at retail, according to the script, at $119.90. QVC's
regular price is only $84.50, Ms. Daly says, but today the
machine has a "special value" price of only $69.96. "The
touch pads are concave," she says. "The numbers are Arabic --
think if people tried to dial with Roman numerals]"</p>
<p>By 12:20 a.m. the audience feedback has begun. A woman who
identifies herself as "Dolores from Mount Carmel" calls in
with doubts about the answering machine after watching Ms.
Daly program it. "It seems kind of complicated," Dolores
says. Not so, Ms. Daly assures her. "If your dog ate the
manual, you could operate this."</p>
<p>And if Molly, an admitted klutz, can get it to work, maybe
Dolores can, too. This, at least, is the message that QVC's
management hopes will reach all the Doloreses out there.
"Host identity" is critical to what QVC Chairman Joseph Segel
calls the "psychographics" of interactive TV home shopping.
This market involves a "critical mass" audience, an
800-area-code telephone network, charge-card availability --
and, perhaps most important, an appealing family of hosts who
steer clear of the hard sell and talk about themselves nearly
as much as the products. "I want the audience to love them,"
Mr. Segel says.</p>
<p>It does. QVC gets about 85,000 phone calls a day. Some
callers giggle about being "maxed out" on their credit cards.
Some ask about a host's new baby or recent vacation, as if
they were soap opera characters.</p>
<p>The shopping system works by dint of a satellite dish and
the diverse dynamics of 17 hosts who are relentlessly
promoted as the "QVC family." Their salaries range from
around $50,000 to $100,000 a year each, although a part is
held hostage to each quarter's popularity ratings. QVC is
constantly surveying its audience. Among other people who
have returned postal response cards sitting in a three-inch
stack here is a woman who writes, "I am disabled and do not
get out much. QVC is a godsend for me. Keep up the good
work." From another: "The hosts are just like my friends."
But unlike family and other guests, Ms. Daly notes, as a TV
host "you're not leaving wet towels on the bed."</p>
<p>Ms. Daly says viewers consider her "offbeat." She calls
fellow hosts Bob Bowersox "everybody's favorite son-in-law,"
Jane Rudolph Treacy "the girl next door, only more so,"
Jeffrey Hewson "the guy everybody wishes their daughter will
bring home," and her pal and the host who precedes her, Steve
Colantuno "the guy everybody wants to come to their party."</p>
<p>Among viewers, no one carries more clout than Elizabeth V.
Fisher, a Pennsylvania grandmother who says she writes to QVC
almost daily. She corrects grammar and critiques hair styles
and clothing so fastidiously that the chairman offered to
hire her as a consultant. She declined. "I don't want to be
tied down," she says. Besides, it might detract from her
shopping. Mrs. Fisher figures she spends $30,000 or so a year
on mail-order shopping, including her QVC buys.</p>
<p>Ms. Daly, hired in 1986, is one of QVC's original hosts.
She is a former rock-group and telegram singer who dropped
out of Temple University in her senior year. She likes music,
birding, history, writing, dogs, lapel pins, the environment
and ice cream. "When I used to be on in the day," she says,
"kids would call in and say, `You're goofy, but you're cool.
You remind me of Bugs Bunny.'" A serious problem with her
vocal chords last year forced her to leave the afternoon time
slot for a "no-talking" recuperation. "I wore Post-its around
the office saying, `I'm not rude, I'm resting my voice,'" she
recalls.</p>
<p>Ms. Daly brings to her calling a rich vocabulary -- and a
theatrical gene pool. Her Daly-Kelly family tree has borne a
Pulitzer Prize-winning Kelly playwright and the late Princess
Grace, as well as a Daly poet.</p>
<p>While Ms. Daly's profession isn't exactly show biz, it's
definitely biz. Mr. Segel keeps a vigilant eye on the
competition. "Let's call HSN (Home Shopping Network Inc.),"
he says, nodding to a bank of eight television monitors in
his office that are tuned to HSN, QVC and its recently
acquired CVN Cos., and J.C. Penney Television Shopping
Channel, among others. "I always enjoy doing that."</p>
<p>Punching up the HSN phone number, he puts the competitor's
operator through her paces as he demands to know the shipping
charges on the "Gray Flannel Travel Set" cologne that is on
the air at the moment. QVC, he says, always shows its
shipping charges on the screen. "Five dollars for a $14.75
item?" he exclaims after the operator has determined the
charge. No, he is not interested at that price.</p>
<p>Consumer price sensitivity colored QVC's important
Christmas shopping season. Mr. Segel says home shoppers were
very selective, often jamming phone lines but not to buy
higher-priced goods. He expects the fourth quarter to be
profitable, though not profitable enough to offset losses
earlier in the year as QVC digests its recent acquisitions.</p>
<p>Mr. Segel thinks of his hosts not as entertainers or
salespeople but as "explainers" whose job is to keep people
tuned in. But Ms. Daly sometimes spontaneously breaks into
song or impressions. One day, sitting off-camera in the QVC
cafeteria, wearing a cowgirl getup and eating a sandwich --
delicately, because of her braces -- she warbles in credible
Katharine Hepburnese: "The caaaalla lily is such a
beeeyoootiful fuhlowah."</p>
<p>The fringed blouse, bolo tie and boots are a costume for a
"celebrity interview" with country-Western singer Charlie
Daniels, one of her favorites. He is promoting his book and
tapes, which are being sold over QVC during the interview.
Ms. Daly prepared for the show by reading the book, listening
to the tapes and losing sleep to arrive at the studio at 4:30
a.m. for the special, four-hour-long Saturday broadcast.</p>
<p>Afterward, Mr. Daniels hurries to a video display terminal
that shows the morning's sales figures. "That's pretty good,"
he says of the figures. But outside the room, a telephone
order-taker confides to Ms. Daly: "Molly] Every other phone
call was for that blouse you're wearing. And the boots. We
could have sold thousands of them]"</p>
