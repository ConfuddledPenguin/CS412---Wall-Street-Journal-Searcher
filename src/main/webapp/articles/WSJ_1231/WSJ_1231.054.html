	<p class="article-leader">SEOUL, South Korea -- Burdened by increased oil imports
and sluggish exports, South Korea's current account sustained
a record one-month deficit of $1.21 billion in November, the
Bank of Korea reported Friday.
   It compared with a deficit of $625 million in October and
a surplus of $498 million in November 1989. The previous
one-month record deficit was $930 million in December 1981.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The November shortfall brought the 11-month deficit since
January to $2.52 billion, from a surplus of $4.26 billion in
the same period last year.</p>
<p>Bank officials said, however, that this year's cumulative
deficit is likely to be reduced to about $2 billion in
December when merchandise trade is expected to score a
surplus of $500 million.</p>
<p>This would be South Korea's first annual current account
deficit after four consecutive years of surpluses that ranged
from $4.6 billion to $14.1 billion.</p>
