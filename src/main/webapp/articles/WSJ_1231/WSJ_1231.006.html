	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- The government's main economic forecasting
gauge declined for the fifth consecutive month in November,
in yet another sign that the economy is headed into a
recession.
   "The economy has been flattened by everyone's reaction to
world events," said Charles Renfro, chief economist with
Alphametrics, an economic forecasting concern in Bala Cynwyd,
Pa. Iraq's invasion of Kuwait appears to have sparked a
sudden downward spiral in consumer confidence, which is
rippling through the economy, although some analysts believe
the economy was weakening before the August invasion.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The index of leading indicators -- a collection of
statistics intended to predict economic activity in the
months ahead -- dropped 1.2% in November after a revised
slide of 1.3% in October and a 0.8% fall in September, the
Commerce Department said. The October decline was reported
last month as 1.2%.</p>
<p>Since World War II, the index has turned down, on average,
nine months before the beginning of a recession. But it
sometimes also has predicted recessions that didn't ensue. In
fact, the November decline marked the greatest number of
consecutive decreases since the index fell for six
consecutive months in mid-1984. No recession followed those
earlier signals.</p>
<p>The index has been declining sporadically since the middle
of last year, with a brief show of strength early last
summer. Most economists now believe the economy is in a
recession -- generally defined as two consecutive quarters of
decline in output of goods and services -- but there is wide
disagreement about when it started and how deep and lengthy
it will be.</p>
<p>Eight of the 11 components of the leading indicators
declined in November. The biggest negative factors were
falling manufacturers' orders for consumer goods, a decrease
in materials prices that respond quickly to supply and demand
(this component doesn't include oil prices), and an increase
in manufacturers' unfilled orders.</p>
<p>The three gauges that indicated a positive trend were
rising stock prices, an increase in delays of deliveries of
supplies (which indicates increased demand), and a slight
rebound in the index of consumer expectations. The consumer
index, based on surveys, fell steeply from 79.3 in May to
50.9 in October. It rose last month to 52.8.</p>
<p>The department's index of coincident indicators, which is
supposed to track the current pace of economic activity,
dropped 1.1% in November after an identical tumble in
October.</p>

<p>                LEADING INDICATORS</p>
<p>Here are the net contributions of the components of the
Commerce Department's index of leading indicators. After
various adjustments they produced a 1.3% decline in the index
for October and a 1.2% decline for November.</p>
