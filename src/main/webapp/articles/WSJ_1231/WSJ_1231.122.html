	<p class="article-leader">HONG KONG -- The government unveiled legislation Friday
that would extend the statute of limitations for certain
securities-law violations to three years, from the current
six months.
   Tam Wing Pong, deputy secretary for Monetary Affairs, said
the change would allow the Securities and Futures Commission
to bring charges within three years of a suspected violation
of rules covering such offenses as shortselling, keeping an
improper securities register or failing to disclose
interests.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The new law would limit the securities watchdog group,
however, by also requiring that charges be brought within one
year of its launching an investigation.</p>
<p>In an interview, Mr. Tam said the SFC, established 18
months ago, has found that the existing six-month limit
provides insufficient time to develop a case against
complicated offenses.</p>
<p>"The (change's) purpose is to help them bring about more
successful investigations," Mr. Tam said.</p>
<p>Government officials said the bill is expected to be
introduced in the Legislative Council in mid-January, and
could become law later in the month.</p>
