	<p class="article-leader">The system of state regulation governing the insurance
industry is under fire. Many expect Chairman John Dingell of
the House Oversight and Investigations subcommittee to
introduce a bill that would at the very least set out federal
guidelines for state regulators. Here are the views of some
industry executives and critics on what needs to be done:</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Joseph Belth, editor of the Insurance Forum and professor
of insurance at the University of Indiana: "There certainly
needs to be something that will better coordinate the
{National Association of Insurance Commissioners} operations
and increase its powers {or} some type of federal regulation
. . . I never have been sure that federal regulation would be
better than state regulation {but} there are gaping holes in
the current system."</p>
<p>John J. Byrne, chairman and chief executive, Fireman's
Fund Insurance Cos.: "I wish that Congress would set some
minimum standards for regulation and leave the execution in
state hands. . . . The ideal is minimum standards."</p>
<p>Rep. Dingell: "If {the problems} aren't being addressed by
the state legislatures, which they don't seem to be, then
federal regulation is going to be required. . . . We're
looking at overseas reinsurers, reinsurers generally, the
adequacy of state regulations, solvency, a {self-regulatory
organization} and also perhaps some SEC responsibility. . . .
This is not a war against the insurance companies, and we are
not going to be shrill in what we do or say."</p>
<p>Wilson H. Taylor, chairman and chief executive officer,
Cigna Corp.: "The state regulatory process indeed does have
deficiencies. . . . I believe a self-regulatory organization
is intriguing. . . , a federal insurance solvency board like
{the industry-run Securities Investor Protection Corp.} could
address the regulation of insurer solvency, avoid additional
levels of regulation and, at the same time, create a
framework for positive future federal actions."</p>
<p>Robert C. Winters, chairman and chief executive officer,
Prudential Insurance Co. of America: "The insurance industry
doesn't need more regulation; it's already one of the most
heavily regulated. {However}, rules protecting insurer
solvency are weak in some states and should be strengthened.
That doesn't mean Washington should take on the role of
regulator. There's no evidence that the federal government
would do a better job."</p>
