	<p class="article-leader">As banks in many parts of the world struggle with big
loan-loss provisions and declining profits, banks in much of
Asia continue to show strong earnings and even are expanding.
But they, too, may soon face a shakeout.
   Earnings of domestic banks in the newly industrialized and
rapidly industrializing countries of Asia remain relatively
robust. And partly because they concentrate on domestic
business, which is underpinned by strong economic growth,
these banks aren't facing the crisis now hobbling their
counterparts in industrialized countries, where sluggish
economies are pinching business.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Further ahead, though, the Asian outlook clouds. "Overall,
banking is not going to be a very profitable business in the
next few years," says Philippe F. Delhaise, general manager
of Capital Information Services, an Asia-based rating agency.</p>
<p>Asian banking markets aren't uniform: Regulations vary
greatly, and in most countries there is a wide gap between a
few dominant banks and many smaller institutions. But
generally, increased competition is narrowing profit margins,
and slower economic growth may expose problem loans just when
Asian banks need to start improving their balance sheets to
meet new international capital rules set by the Bank for
International Settlements.</p>
<p>Thus, some analysts say, some banks won't be able to
survive the next few years, making an eventual consolidation
in Asia's banking industry likely. "With slower growth
anticipated and tighter monetary policy, you have to look at
the banks in the region with caution," says Robert Rountree,
managing director of ChinTung Research Ltd. of Hong Kong.</p>
<p>Prospects for banks in many of Asia's rapidly growing
nations aren't nearly as bleak as they are in the U.S. and
Japan. Many Asian banks, like Asian economies, will continue
to outperform the rest of the world, though economic growth
in the region will likely slow in 1991.</p>
<p>Even the battered Philippine economy is forecast to grow
2.8% next year, while growth in other countries in the region
is expected to range from 3.5% to nearly 9%.</p>
<p>In Malaysia, growth next year is projected at between 8%
and 8.5%, after a projected 10% expansion this year. "Banks
(in Malaysia) are poised to benefit from the broad-based
growth of the economy," says James Bax, research director for
Baring Securities (Singapore) Pte. Ltd.</p>
<p>Continued economic growth also may help support Asian
property markets, though some analysts are concerned that
loans made to finance property purchases at inflated prices
may sour now that certain markets have topped out.</p>
<p>Some real estate loans are likely to falter, analysts say.
But rapid growth and speculation have pushed land prices in
regional capitals so high that even if prices soften, they
likely will remain above levels of a couple of years ago.</p>
<p>Many Asian banks also benefit by focusing on their
domestic markets. Hongkong & Shanghai Banking Corp. -- Asia's
largest non-Japanese bank -- is the exception. In the past
decade, it launched a massive global expansion that is now
costing dearly; the bank reported a 21% drop in profit for
the first half of 1990 because of losses on its operations in
Australia and the U.S. and on its 14.9% stake in Britain's
Midland Bank PLC. Those losses dwarfed a strong performance
closer to home; analysts say Hongkong Bank continued to
profit handsomely in Asia during the period.</p>
<p>Some analysts say the best protection Asian banks have is
that many already went through a crisis in the mid-1980s,
when several regional economies suffered recessions. Those
hard times helped to clear banks' balance sheets of some bad
loans and cleaned up the books of borrowers.</p>
<p>In recent years, corporations in the region have made
increasing use of equity markets to raise capital, rather
than straight borrowings. That has left both creditors and
borrowers better off than they were at the start of the
1980s.</p>
<p>Still, higher interest rates and an unexpected credit
crunch resulting from an abrupt retreat by Japanese banks may
slow economic growth more than analysts are now forecasting,
raising myriad questions about the health of Asian banks.</p>
<p>For one, analysts aren't sure of the credit quality of
some loans. Although banks were able to remove some bad loans
from their books in the mid-1980s, credit demand soared in
recent years, and once again, some major bank borrowers have
become highly leveraged, these analysts say.</p>
<p>The personal character of traditional banking
relationships in Asia frequently means that banks make loans
to their longtime customers without completely understanding
or ascertaining how the money will be used. In many cases, it
has been used to speculate in stock and property markets, at
least until share prices began to slide this year. Added to
that, accounting practices in some countries are relatively
lax, making it more difficult for banks to know when loans
are souring.</p>
<p>Tighter credit conditions are also a problem. Interest
rates around the region are rising. "Higher interest rates
will put pressure on (profit) margins as growth in loan
demand slows," says William R. Ebsworth, director of research
for Fidelity Investments Management (H.K.) Ltd.</p>
<p>Competition among Asian banks in their domestic markets is
also taking a toll. Profit margins from retail banking --
long a major source of cheap funding for banks -- are
shrinking. Consumers are no longer content to deposit their
money at meager interest rates. That is forcing banks to
modernize by spending a lot to introduce new technology and
working to expand fee-based business.</p>
<p>The changes brought on by competition heighten the gulf
between the few dominant banks in most Asian countries and
the many smaller ones. In Thailand, for example, the four
largest banks control 68% of assets in the banking system.</p>
<p>"If one of the big banks has a couple of projects go bust,
they can withstand it, but if a smaller bank has two or three
projects go belly-up, it will have a dramatic impact on their
profitability," says a foreign analyst in Bangkok.</p>
<p>Governments around the region are keeping a protective eye
on their banks and aren't likely to allow any major
collapses. They may, however, shepherd weaker banks into
mergers. Just last month, the Indonesian government rescued
Bank Umum Majapahit Jaya, a small, private bank, and is now
seeking new investors for it.</p>
<p>Jakarta's action may be the start of a period of
consolidation in Indonesia's banking sector. Deregulation has
spawned hefty increases in business volume and profits,
though the process also has created worries about the
stability of the country's financial system. The creation of
nearly 50 new domestic banks in the past two years has
resulted in intense competition for professional staff. Some
rapidly growing banks could find their portfolios containing
poor assets stemming from their hurry to dispense credit
without proper evaluation.</p>
<p>In Indonesia, shaky accounting practices make it difficult
to assess banks. This worry was highlighted in September by a
scandal at P.T. Bank Duta, the nation's fifth-largest private
bank. The entire board and management were replaced and the
bank eventually announced it had suffered foreign-exchange
trading losses of $420 million. But those losses didn't show
up in the first accounts published by the bank after the loss
was disclosed. Foreign bankers reckon that if such problems
can occur at Bank Duta, there may be serious problems at
other banks.</p>
<p>The many analysts who predict a regionwide banking
consolidation say that though the end result will be fewer
banks, they will be better capitalized than before. Larger
banks in the region are likely to survive any shakeout and
become even stronger, analysts say. "There will be fewer,
better-capitalized banks," says a banking analyst in Hong
Kong. "We will definitely see that in the U.S., and we will
see that in Asia."</p>
