	<p class="article-leader">Data General Corp., working to cut costs and focus its
resources on a new computer line, quietly dropped a
high-profile product-development agreement with Nippon
Telegraph & Telephone Corp.
   Separately, Chief Executive Officer Ronald Skates
disclosed that the company has cut its work force more deeply
than had been expected, eliminating about 2,400 jobs, or 20%
more than the 2,000 jobs Data General had said it would cut
this year. By January, the payroll will total about 9,300,
down from a peak of 17,000 in 1985, he estimated.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The agreement with NTT to build high-speed hubs for
private data communications networks was unveiled with great
fanfare in a Commerce Department-sponsored press conference
in 1987, at a time of acute U.S.-Japan trade tension over
technology issues.</p>
<p>The project, code-named "asparagus" because it was
supposed to take two years to grow, apparently fell victim to
engineering delays and five years of losses and slow sales at
Data General. The move completes the Westborough, Mass.,
computer maker's withdrawal from the data communications
equipment business after investing millions of dollars in the
failed effort.</p>
<p>Although Data General never disclosed the value of the NTT
contract, NTT executives said at the time of the announcement
that the company planned to buy over a five-year period
starting in 1989 some $130 million of equipment to be
developed by Data General. The communications systems were to
link voice, data and computers in large, private
communications networks such as those used by corporations
and universities. Analysts said at the time that the revenue
could eventually be significant for Data General.</p>
<p>Barry Willman, an analyst with Sanford C. Bernstein & Co.,
says that killing the project now will help focus Data
General on its new Aviion workstations, which he called "the
company's future." He added that the NTT project had
"stalled" and revenue expectations for the fruit of the
venture had been "severely diminished."</p>
<p>Mr. Skates, the chief executive, said in an interview that
the financial impact of withdrawing from the data
communications equipment market "is already behind us." He
said the company "still has a strong business relationship
with NTT in other areas." He added that delays "on both
sides" combined with a changing market to reduce the
product's potential.</p>
<p>In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission,
Data General said the agreement was terminated Dec. 5 "at its
request."</p>
<p>Mr. Willman estimates Data General will lose about 15
cents a share, or $5 million, on revenue of $298 million for
the fiscal first quarter ended Dec. 30. In the year-earlier
first quarter, the company had a net loss of $20.5 million,
or 69 cents a share, on a 6% decline in revenue to $290.7
million.</p>
<p>Data General's deep cost-cutting had prompted some
analysts to predict that the company could break even as
early as its fiscal second quarter. But most now foresee a
loss for at least two more quarters.</p>
<p>In New York Stock Exchange composite trading Friday, Data
General stock closed at $4.25 a share, down 12.5 cents.</p>
