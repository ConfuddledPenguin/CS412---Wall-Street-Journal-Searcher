	<p class="article-leader">HOUSE OF FABRICS Inc.'s president and chief executive
officer, Gary L. Larkins, said in a letter to Fabricland Inc.
directors that the $13.50-a-share bid by House of Fabrics for
Fabricland was "both fair and generous" to Fabricland
shareholders. In the OTC Focus column in the Dec. 19 edition,
Mr. Larkin was misidentified as a Fabricland officer and his
comment was incorrectly attributed to the president of
Fabricland, which said it hadn't responded to the bid.
