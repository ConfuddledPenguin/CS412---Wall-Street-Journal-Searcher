	<p class="article-leader">The four Spanish oil refineries that control Spain's
retail gasoline monopoly, Campsa S.A., agreed to take over
its distribution network by July 31, an Industry Ministry
official said.
   Cia. Espanola de Petroleos S.A., or Cepsa; Petroleos de
Mediterraneo S.A., or Petromed; Ertoil S.A.; and Repsol S.A.
agreed to divide Campsa's gas stations, with each refinery
taking a part of the network proportionate to the size of its
shareholding. Spain must end Campsa's retail monopoly by 1992
to fulfill its obligations as a European Community member.
The distribution network covers 3,600 gas stations in Spain.
Repsol will sell 4% of its holding to the other shareholders
in exchange for rights to the Campsa trademark. Repsol will
hold 65.9% of Campsa, Cepsa 17.8%, Petromed 9.1% and Ertoil
7%.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The ministry said the move was intended to foster
competition in Spain's retail gas market and to increase
refineries' vertical integration into the retail sector. The
refineries eventually may set retail gas prices; prices are
set now by Campsa beneath government ceilings, which are
readjusted every two weeks.</p>
