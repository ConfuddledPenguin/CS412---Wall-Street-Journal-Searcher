	<p class="article-leader">TORONTO -- Campeau Corp.'s two U.S. retailing
subsidiaries, Federated Department Stores Inc. and Allied
Stores Corp., reported combined net income of $3.9 million
for November, compared with a loss in the previous month.
   The monthly profit was the first by the two units since
they filed for Chapter 11 protection from creditors under the
federal Bankruptcy Code last January. Analysts said the
turnaround increases the chances the units could show a
profit for the fiscal fourth quarter ending Feb. 2. Campeau
is a real estate and retailing concern.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>In a filing with the federal bankruptcy court in
Cincinnati, Federated reported net income of $1.7 million for
the four weeks ended Dec. 1 and Allied had earnings of $2.2
million. The results, which compared with a combined loss of
$23.7 million for the four weeks ended Nov. 3, don't include
costs related to the bankruptcy-law case. The companies
didn't disclose year-earlier figures.</p>
<p>Revenue at both units were up from the previous month,
reflecting a pickup in sales in the pre-Christmas shopping
season. Federated's revenue rose 27% to $459 million from
$362 million. Allied had revenue of $275.4 million, up 49%
from $184.4 million.</p>
<p>Still, the November revenues lagged behind year-earlier
levels, mainly because of a slowdown in consumer demand, the
companies said.</p>
<p>"It is no secret that this year's Christmas selling season
was difficult for us, as it was for most retailers," said
Allen Questrom, chairman and chief executive officer of
Federated and Allied.</p>
<p>But Mr. Questrom said he was encouraged by a continued
rise in gross profit margins at both units. He also said the
amount of cash available at Dec. 1, including investments,
unpurchased receivables and working capital facilities,
exceeded the expectations of the company and its bank
lenders.</p>
