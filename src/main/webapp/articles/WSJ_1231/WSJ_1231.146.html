	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- If some officials at the Federal Deposit
Insurance Corp. have their way, the term "national bank"
could have a whole new meaning.
   As the deposit insurance fund rapidly shrinks and fears
grow that some large regional banks could soon fail,
regulators are scrambling to find less expensive ways to deal
with insolvencies. One idea that is generating both attention
and controversy is to directly inject troubled institutions
with government money, perhaps even coupled with government
ownership.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The idea isn't unheard-of. In 1984, the FDIC put up $4.5
billion to bail out Continental Illinois Bank & Trust Co.,
took complete ownership of the Chicago bank and installed new
management. As the bank got back on its feet, the FDIC began
selling its stock and has recouped most of its money. In
efforts to arrange takeovers of some large Texas banks by
Banc One Corp. and NCNB Corp., the FDIC also took temporary
ownership interests.</p>
<p>But the regular use of such an approach would be a
significant break from current practice. In most cases now,
the FDIC arranges the merger of a failed bank into a healthy
one. The problem is that the cost of such arrangements to the
taxpayer can be huge: To make the merger work, the FDIC
itself takes over the failed bank's bad loans and other sour
assets.</p>
<p>"What really costs us money is the dead-weight loss of
assets when they come out of the banking system," says Roger
Watson, the FDIC's director of research. As soon as the FDIC
assumes the bad loans from a failing bank that's being taken
over, he says, the assets suffer an immediate loss of about
15% in value. This is partly because the FDIC's goal is to
sell, rather than manage, the portfolio.</p>
<p>FDIC officials say it might actually be cheaper to try to
keep the failed institutions alive. That's where the idea of
government money and possible ownership comes in. A capital
infusion into a bank that faces "market-induced problems"
such as sour real estate loans can help it skate through a
tough period, says Steven Seelig, the FDIC's director of
liquidation.</p>
<p>Critics, though, contend that such changes could produce
dangerous results. A recent report prepared for the Financial
Institutions subcommittee of the House Banking Committee
warned that FDIC investments in banks could lead to
"effective nationalizations of our major banks."</p>
<p>Moreover, say the critics, earlier attempts to give
savings and loans time to work their way out of problems
backfired, producing larger, rather than smaller, losses for
the government. "Forbearance doesn't work," says Rep. Charles
Schumer (D., N.Y.), a member of the banking panel. "We have
two choices: We can pay a little now or we can pay a lot
later."</p>
<p>Banking consultant Bert Ely argues that greater direct
government involvement will only delay what he sees as a
needed consolidation among the nation's 12,400 banks. "If the
government supplies capital to weak banks, it stacks the deck
against the better managed institutions and doesn't allow as
fast a shrinkage of the industry as should take place," he
says.</p>
<p>FDIC officials counter that things simply can't go on the
way they are now. They figure the Bank Insurance Fund will
incur gross losses of $11 billion in 1991, falling to $4
billion by year end. FDIC Chairman William Seidman has
proposed that banks pay a one-time assessment equal to 1% of
their deposits to pump $25 billion into the fund, but even
so, the agency says it has to find ways to slow down its
outlays.</p>
<p>"Because of current economic conditions, it's difficult to
find private buyers who can or want to purchase and fully
capitalize failed institutions," says Mr. Seidman. What's
more, he points out, "the forced liquidation of large amounts
of assets in weak markets is expensive," and is helping fuel
the downward spiral of real estate prices that is
contributing to the problems many banks face.</p>
<p>The FDIC's search for alternative ways of dealing with
troubled banks isn't limited just to the notion of taking
them over. Some analysts are beginning to talk of the need
for a modern version of the Reconstruction Finance Corp., the
federal agency that lent capital to some 6,000 banks to help
them through the Depression. Lowell Bryan, a banking expert
with the management consulting firm of McKinsey & Co.,
recently briefed Mr. Seidman and other regulators on a
proposal to use funds from the FDIC and private investors to
shore up solvent but undercapitalized institutions.</p>
<p>One of the concerns driving the review is the FDIC's
conclusion that more large banks will fail. In 1990, 169
banks failed, with assets totaling $16 billion; 148 of them
were so-called "purchase and assumptions," leaving the FDIC
holding most of the bad assets. In 1991, the agency predicts,
180 banks with total assets of $70 billion will fail --
meaning that the average failed bank will be much larger than
it was in 1990.</p>
<p>Agency officials won't say which banks they expect to
fail, but the $70 billion figure leaves enough room to
include two large shaky banks in the Northeast -- the Bank of
New England in Boston and Goldome Financial Corp. in Buffalo,
N.Y.</p>
<p>Mr. Watson, the FDIC's research director, says regulators
have learned enough from the S&L debacle to know "you can't
forbear on an institution that has no chance of turning
around" and "you can't allow an institution to grow out of
its problems" by making more risky loans.</p>
<p>Despite such lessons, finding a cheaper, easier way to
deal with failing banks won't be easy. "It's pretty clear
that if somebody comes up with a miracle that works and saves
money, everybody will jump to it," says James McLaughlin, a
regulatory attorney at the American Bankers Association. "But
I don't think they're going to find a miracle cure."</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>        How the FDIC Deals With Failing Banks</p>
<p>Here's how the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. handled 169
failing banks in 1990:</p>
<p>-- 148 by purchase and assumption. The deposits and some
assets are sold to a sound bank and the FDIC takes over the
bad loans. When banks are closed in this way, all deposits,
even those above the $100,000 federal insurance ceiling, are
protected.</p>
<p>-- 20 by liquidation. The bank is closed and depositors
are paid up to the $100,000 insurance limit.</p>
<p>-- One assistance transaction. The FDIC makes a capital
infusion to keep the bank alive.</p>
