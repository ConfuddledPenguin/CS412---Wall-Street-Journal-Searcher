	<p class="article-leader">Left-leaning historian Eric Foner writing in the Dec. 24
issue of The Nation:</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>In today's U.S.S.R., it is not simply the ubiquitous
shortages but how people do manage to obtain things that
feeds discontent. In a world of empty stores, shopping is
commonly done through the back door -- that is, via bribes,
barter and official or family connections. Even those in a
position to benefit from this system find it unfair and
humiliating. To a large extent, whom you know now determines
your standard of living. There is something positively
egalitarian about the way money in a market society can erase
other social distinctions, about a world in which anybody
with the cash can walk into a store whatever goods he or she
pleases, without incurring personal obligations.</p>
