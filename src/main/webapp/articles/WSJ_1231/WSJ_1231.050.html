	<p class="article-leader">If you are a small-business owner, the Ed Wilders of the
world want to help you get a piece of a $34 billion pie.
   The federal government spends roughly that amount annually
on contracts with small businesses for everything from
toothpaste and guard services to missile parts and
groundskeeping. If you know what you are doing, government
work can be a steady and profitable source of business.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>But for the uninitiated, trying to win and complete
government contracts "can really be a madhouse" that drains
resources from a small company, says Frank Lopez, owner of
Arion Computer Inc., a Houston computer supplier hoping to
snag its first federal contract.</p>
<p>That's where people such as Mr. Wilder come in. As
executive director of Houston-based Texas Information
Procurement Service, Mr. Wilder and his staff help small
businesses -- for a fee of $200 per year -- find government
work and navigate around sometimes encyclopedic bidding
requirements, arcane rules and flinty-eyed government
auditors.</p>
<p>Since opening in 1986, TIPS, as the Texas operation is
known, has helped some 3,000 businesses obtain over $200
million in contracts, says Mr. Wilder. "Of those companies,
90% had never done business with the government before," he
adds.</p>
<p>Mr. Wilder's operation is one of 90 relatively little
known procurement-assistance centers operating in 43 states.
Partly financed by $9 million a year from the Defense
Department and usually operated by local universities or
state agencies, these centers are in the front lines of an
effort to bring more small businesses into the
government-contracting arena, as a way of increasing
competition and lowering costs.</p>
<p>In the current economic downturn, the importance of such
centers is growing, observers say. A diet of government work
"can be the difference between surviving and getting burned
up" in a recession, says Jon Goodman, director of the
entrepreneur program at the University of Southern California
and a founder of TIPS.</p>
<p>TIPS, which is part of the University of Houston, is
lauded by federal officials and other center directors as one
of the better such operations going. Much of the credit is
given to the 45-year-old Mr. Wilder, who spent 21 years in
procurement activities for the U.S. Army before starting up
the center in 1986. "Ed is Mr. Procurement," says Phyllis
Golden Nelson, president of the Texas Association of
Procurement Centers, a trade group.</p>
<p>"If it weren't for Wilder, my firm would probably be out
of business," says Ed Pita, president of Process Technology
International Inc., a Houston engineering and fabrication
company. A supplier to the oil industry, Process Technology
had disdained government work until the oil bust of the
mid-1980s sent Mr. Pita scrambling to find new business.</p>
<p>With TIPS help, the company has won more than $1.5 million
in contracts, representing about 40% of its revenue, over the
past three years. One crucial bit of early aid, says Mr.
Pita, was showing the company how it could apply for and get
progress payments on its job of refurbishing some contracts
for the Army. "Without that cash flow, I couldn't have done
the job," says Mr. Pita.</p>
<p>Government contracting isn't for every small business,
says Mr. Wilder. A relatively new company, particularly, may
have a hard time persuading a government contracting officer
that it has the technical or financial wherewithal to
complete a contract, he says. Nonetheless, Mr. Wilder adds,
his experience in Texas convinces him that only a tiny
percentage of qualified small businesses actually go after
government work.</p>
<p>TIPS goes through the Commerce Business Daily, a
Department of Commerce publication that lists federal
contracts worth more than $25,000, looking for jobs to match
up with its clients. Sometimes Mr. Wilder goes through the
local yellow pages looking for a company to match up with a
contract he has found -- such as the $90,000 job he once
placed with a local concern to rent trailers to the Secret
Service for surveillance work.</p>
<p>The procurement service is also plugged into the
"grandmothers' network" that each year collects data on
hundreds of thousands of contracts of less than $25,000.
These smaller contracts only get posted on "bid boards" at
the local government facility that is in need of the service.
Local people, often retirees, who live near the facility copy
down the bid-board information and sell it to interested
parties, such as TIPS.</p>
<p>Finding the right contract is one thing, deciphering it is
another. A government bid solicitation can run several
hundred pages, spelling out the requirements in excruciating
detail.</p>
<p>And details can be crucial. Arion Computer's Mr. Lopez
says he was about to make a bid on supplying 30 computer
terminals to the government, until TIPS counselors discovered
that the computers he had in mind lacked one small, but
crucial specification. "If I had bid and won that contract, I
would have been stuck with 30 computers at $4,500 each," he
says.</p>
<p>Once a company has been declared low bidder for a
contract, it must often endure a "pre-award survey" by a
government contracting officer checking to make sure the
company can actually do the work. TIPS counselors do what
amount to dress rehearsals of these surveys and then act as
observers during the actual visits. "We want to make sure our
clients don't get jerked around," says Mr. Wilder.</p>
<p>Jack Reid, president of International Polymer Corp. in
Houston, says a TIPS review led him to rewrite his company's
quality-assurance manual, which was crucial in passing an
Army survey for an ammunition contract. "While we were
competent to do the job, the contracting officer wouldn't
have known it without the revisions," he says.</p>
<p>Barbara Lasris, president and owner of Air Repair
Products, says her four-person concern used to supply its
air-purifying products to companies working for the
government. Sometimes they didn't pay her. "TIPS showed me
how to bid directly and cut out the middlemen," she says.</p>
<p>TIPS also helped steer her through the esoterica of
government procurement. Once, she was about to ship her
devices four to a box when Mr. Wilder noticed a code on the
order form stipulated a limit of one per box. "That saved me
from possibly having it sent back for improper shipping," she
says.</p>
