	<p class="article-leader">Petroleos de Venezuela approved an ambitious expansion
plan that would boost oil production to 3,250,000 barrels a
day in 1993 from 2,330,000 now, Energy and Mines minister
Celestino Armas said Friday.
   Production capacity in 1991 is expected to reach 2,970,000
barrels a day, enough for sustained production of 2.5 million
barrels a day. Petroleos de Venezuela also approved
increasing its refining capacity, now 1.1 million barrels a
day, to 1.7 million barrels by 1997. Its 1990 profit reached
a record $2.12 billion, and profit for 1991 is expected to
exceed $3 billion. Investments in 1991 will total 250 billion
bolivars ($5.03 billion), mostly for exploration.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Mr. Armas wouldn't say whether he supports returning to
the pre-Aug. 2 quota system of the Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries; he previously said quotas would be
reapplied if needed to avoid a surplus in world oil supplies.
Venezuela's OPEC quota was 1,940,000 barrels a day. As a
result of the increase in oil prices and output, Venezuela
revised its estimated 1990 oil revenue to about $14.3 billion
from less than $10 billion.</p>
