	<p class="article-leader">Indonesian tycoon Liem Sioe Liong has gained control of
Singapore's diversified United Industrial Corp. with a share
purchase that surprised analysts.
   UIC's president, Oei Hong Leong, sold 182 million shares
at 1.60 Singapore dollars (91 U.S. cents) each to Mr. Liem's
Singapore investment company. The S$291.2 million transaction
reduces Mr. Oei's stake to 4.7% from 22.4%. The holding of
Mr. Liem's KMP Pte. rises to 24.5% from 6.7%.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Mr. Oei is also stepping down as UIC's president and chief
executive officer.</p>
<p>Mr. Liem's Salim Group, Indonesia's largest conglomerate,
has more than 200 companies involved in banking, trading,
manufacturing, property and other activities. Headed by the
74-year-old Mr. Liem, Salim has been steadily expanding its
activities in Singapore. Now, Salim will in effect get
control of a large block of Singapore's commercial real
estate: UIC controls the country's largest
commercial-property company, Singapore Land Ltd.</p>
<p>Neither Mr. Liem nor Mr. Oei could be reached for comment
on the transaction.</p>
