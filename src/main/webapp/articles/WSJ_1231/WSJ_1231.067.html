	<p class="article-leader">Ray Monk's new biography, "Ludwig Wittgenstein: The Duty
of Genius" (The Free Press, 654 pages, $29.95), provides the
fullest narrative yet of this contradictory, prickly, but
charismatic philosopher. Born in 1889, he was the eighth and
youngest child of a Viennese family of assimilated Jews of
enormous wealth and cultural sophistication. Gustave Klimt
painted his parents' wedding portrait; for his pianist
brother Paul, Maurice Ravel composed a concerto for left hand
after he lost his right arm in World War I.
   Standards of taste and proficiency ran high in this
exquisite and fastidious clan; so did accompanying stresses
and torments. No less than three of Ludwig's brothers
committed suicide. At 19, already handsome, lonely and
intense, Ludwig went to Manchester, England, as an
aeronautical engineer. It was the heroic age of air
pioneering, and Ludwig wanted to build and fly his own plane.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>But a bent toward the abstract drove him shyly and
hesitantly to Cambridge to study under Bertrand Russell,
whose revolutionary "Principles of Mathematics" reduced
philosophy to logic. Russell was captivated and exasperated
by this obnoxious apprentice: "My German engineer, I think,
is a fool. He thinks nothing empirical is knowable -- I asked
him to admit that there was not a rhinoceros in the room, but
he wouldn't." But as Wittgenstein began to outgallop the
master intellectually and spiritually, Russell's tune soon
changed to "I love him and feel he will solve the problems I
am too old to solve."</p>
<p>But Ludwig went home in 1914 to enlist in the Austrian
Army, where he served in logistics on the Galician front, in
artillery on the Russian front, and finally as a POW on the
Italian front. During these five tempestuous and formative
years in uniform, he wrote the major work published in his
lifetime, the 1921 "Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus" (the
clumsy title is an allusion to Spinoza's equally clumsy
"Tractatus Theologico-Politicus"). In form the book is a
series of separate, numbered, aphoristic paragraphs; in
spirit it is an uneasy wedding of Ludwig's Cambridge logic to
a Tolstoyan mysticism cultivated under fire. It affirms that
meaningful language is limited to propositions about fact,
but then declares that all this is but a ladder to be thrown
away. Ending with the famous aphorism "Whereof one cannot
speak, thereof one must be silent," it follows Kant in its
implication that God and ethics are true features of reality
but ineffable.</p>
<p>After the war, Ludwig tried teaching grammar school in a
succession of Austrian villages. His pedagogy showed a
characteristic combination of empathy and impatience; he
awoke the faster pupils with imaginative presentations of
astronomy, biology, botany and architecture, while inflicting
"ear-boxing" and "hairpulling" on the slow or dishonest. He
produced with none of the endless fuss that impeded his adult
writings a superb spelling dictionary for children, gardened
for a while in a monastery, and designed a severely
geometrical house for a sister in Vienna. Then he grudgingly
returned to Cambridge in 1933 to teach philosophy. He was to
remain on its faculty for most of the rest of his life (he
had given away his inherited fortune, which had briefly made
him one of the richest men in Europe). This most influential
of academics hated academe, urged his favorites to defect
from philosophy to medicine or factory work, and indeed saw
philosophy itself as something to be cleared away in favor of
a life of fiercely self-denying austerity.</p>
<p>Physically, he was forever fleeing the university for long
periods of roughing it in spartan climes -- Iceland, Norway,
the wild Irish coast and, very briefly, Stalin's Russia,
which apparently proved too spartan even for him. He spent
some of World War II as a medical orderly in Newcastle; he
died of cancer in Cambridge in 1951 and was given a Catholic
burial. His last years he spent jotting down questions about
language and meaning, but the exact questions have come to
matter less than the saintly tone of the questioner.</p>
<p>As the critic Guy Davenport put it, "Disciples who came to
him expecting to find a man of incredibly deep learning found
a man who saw mankind held together by suffering alone, and
he invariably advised them to be as kind as possible to
others." He seemed like those mystics specializing in
sweeping away verbal and other obstacles blocking the naked
contemplation of God. He did the sweeping in what he wrote;
he did the contemplating in how he lived.</p>
<p>Mr. Monk's book works well enough on the anecdotal,
day-to-day level. He also gives a quiet and credible account
of Wittgenstein's homosexual loves and friendships with shy
young disciples, eschewing both the sensational distortions
and the stuffy denials that have marred recent writing on
this sensitive topic. But Mr. Monk is not up to painting an
organically convincing picture of the sage. His presentation
of the very difficult philosophy is skimpy, random and
context-less; he does better but is still inadequate on
Wittgenstein's constant and profound entanglement with
concerns of the spirit. Saint and thinker remain too dim and
too far apart in this readable but finally unsatisfying life.</p>
