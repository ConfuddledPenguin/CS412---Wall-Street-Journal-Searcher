	<p class="article-leader">Matsushita Electric Industrial Co. completed its $6.59
billion tender offer for MCA Inc., accomplishing the year's
largest acquisition and the biggest takeover yet of an
American company by a Japanese one.
   By receiving about 97% of MCA's outstanding shares, the
consumer electronics giant becomes the majority shareholder.
A technical merger is expected to be achieved within two
weeks, after various legal filings.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Since a buy-out agreement was announced Nov. 26, attorneys
for the two companies were able to plow smoothly through
various government approvals and legal challenges. Completing
the tender offer by the end of the year allows the merger to
be treated as a 1990 taxable event. MCA holders who tendered
their shares by last Friday, Dec. 28, will be able to declare
their capital gains for this year even though their payment
checks will be dated Jan. 3.</p>
<p>Merger talks began late last summer, and endured only two
rocky moments. One was when the news broke in late September,
which dismayed the Japanese and "threw the process into chaos
for two weeks," recalls a principal. Later, during a furious
Thanksgiving week of negotiations, talks nearly broke down
over the price. Matsushita was persuaded to raise its bid to
$66 a share plus equity in a spunoff TV station, WWOR of
Secaucus, N.J., thought to be worth about $5 per MCA share.
This final price was still less than MCA, based in Universal
City, Calif., is said to have expected two months before.</p>
<p>Five shareholder suits were filed in state court in
Delaware and Los Angeles, charging that MCA management
accepted an unsatisfactory price in order to entrench
management. These lawsuits were tentatively settled, the
plaintiffs receiving attorneys' fees and a loosening of
anti-takeover provisions regarding the TV station, which is
expected to be sold. Shares of the station, called Pinelands
Inc., begin trading today on the New York Stock Exchange.</p>
<p>Another suit in federal court in Los Angeles charges that
MCA Chairman Lew Wasserman's payout from the acquisition
violates federal securities laws mandating equal treatment
for all shareholders. Mr. Wasserman is to receive preferred
stock rather than cash from Matsushita because many of his
nearly five million shares were acquired at a low-cost basis
and would have been subject to severe capital gains taxes.
U.S. District Court Judge Manuel Real denied a motion for
summary judgment Friday, refusing to grant a preliminary
injunction to block the merger. The suit, now seeking
damages, is still pending.</p>
<p>Also on Friday, U.S. Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia
refused to block the merger as requested by an antitrust suit
filed in federal court in Phoenix by Go-Video Inc., of
Scottsdale, Ariz. A shareholder suit filed in federal court
in New York was dismissed: That suit charged that the buy-out
violated the constitutional rights of American citizens by
allowing foreign ownership of a U.S. media company.</p>
<p>All in all, no serious obstacles arose to consummating the
transaction. By its own admission, Matsushita was nervous
about a political uproar over a Japanese takeover of a famous
American movie studio. But reaction was muted. Politicians in
Washington seemed distracted by events in the Persian Gulf,
and few were willing to challenge MCA Chairman Lew
Wasserman's wishes. MCA was in many ways Mr. Wasserman's own
company -- he had built it for 54 years -- and he has
powerful political connections. MCA and Matsushita assembled
a host of Washington insiders to lobby for the transaction.</p>
<p>Similarly, because of the high price and again perhaps
because of a reluctance to take on Mr. Wasserman, no other
companies joined in bidding for MCA or criticized the
transaction too vocally.</p>
