	<p class="article-leader">Manufacturers are cautious about launching major factory
investment projects these days, but most intend to carry out
previously planned modernization programs, machinery
producers say.
   U.S. machine tool plants received $203.4 million of orders
in November, 10% more than during the weak month of November
1989, but 24% less than October's $268.1 million.
Furthermore, last month's bookings were down 18% from the
average for the first 10 months of 1990, according to the
NMTBA, the Association for Manufacturing Technology, a trade
group based in McLean, Va.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Machine tool distributors, who handle imported machines as
well as those made in the U.S., saw November orders drop 32%
from a year earlier and 8.1% from October, said the American
Machine Tool Distributors' Association, Rockville, Md.</p>
<p>Because lathes, machining centers, metal-forming presses
and other machine tools are used to shape most metal parts --
and to make the molds for many plastic products -- machine
tool orders are a good barometer of investment in factory
machinery. Also, machine tool purchases usually can be
postponed without creating an immediate crisis, which makes
them a sensitive indicator.</p>
<p>November frequently is a weak order month because
Thanksgiving eliminates two business days. However, machine
tool executives say last month's scanty orders also reflect
reluctance to make major commitments while the economy is
weakening rapidly.</p>
<p>Thus far, there's no sign of widespread cancellations of
planned factory improvements such as those that occurred
early in the 1973-74 and 1981-82 recessions. Only $7.6
million of previously placed machine tool orders were
canceled in November, NMTBA said, a figure below the monthly
average for the last two years. By contrast, monthly
cancellations averaged $53.3 million during 1981, when the
last major recession was brewing.</p>
<p>"Orders from aerospace companies, both domestic and
overseas, continue strong, but general industry orders have
been very slow," says Christopher C. Cole, group vice
president for Cincinnati Milacron Inc., the nation's largest
machine tool maker. "We didn't see the year-end rush to use
up capital spending budgets that we've had in previous
years."</p>
<p>Spending for individual "stand-alone" machine tools has
weakened recently, says Brian D. McLaughlin, president and
chief executive officer of Hurco Cos., Indianapolis, a major
producer of computerized controls for such machines. Many
stand-alone machines are bought by smaller factories.</p>
<p>Larger factories often buy groups of machines that form a
parts-making system. Orders for these manufacturing cells
haven't dropped off as sharply. "We hear a lot of talk about
recession, but we don't see a precipitous pullback by our
customers," says John F. Townsend, vice president of Giddings
& Lewis Inc., Fond du Lac, Wis., a leading producer of
manufacturing cells. Orders for the company's automated
assembly systems also have held up well.</p>
<p>Forecasting into 1991 is unusually difficult because no
one can forecast the severity and length of the economic
downturn. Manufacturers continue to discuss new factory
equipment programs, but they don't sign order forms, says
Milacron's Mr. Cole. "You can be discouraged that orders
haven't been signed, or optimistic because plans aren't being
canceled," he says.</p>
<p>A Commerce Department survey made in October and November
of capital spending plans didn't signal a sharp drop. Major
machine tool buyers -- manufacturers of automobiles,
airplanes, appliances, machinery and other durable goods --
said they would reduce capital spending less than 1% next
year.</p>
<p>And Eli S. Lustgarten, machinery analyst with PaineWebber
Inc., thinks manufacturers will cut purchases of data
processing and communications equipment rather than factory
machinery. He's looking for a "single digit rise" in machine
tool orders next year because U.S. auto makers must spend
more on production systems to make new engines and
transmissions, or they will fall dangerously behind Japanese
competitors.</p>
<p>Based on the recent trend, 1990 orders for U.S.-made
machine tools are likely to be slightly higher than the $2.81
billion for all of 1989. Shipments in 1990 also will be up a
few percentage points from last year's $3.20 billion.</p>
<p>Shipments have exceeded new orders during much of the last
two years as machine tool builders filled backlogged orders.
At the end of November, the backlog of unfilled orders
totaled $1.52 billion, NMTBA said, down from $1.80 billion at
the start of 1990 and from a recent high of $2.32 billion in
February 1989.</p>
<p>November orders for lathes, machining centers, boring
mills, milling machines, grinders and other machines to cut
metal totaled $137.5 million, up 6.6%, from $128.9 million a
year earlier, NMTBA said. Last month's orders for
metal-forming presses and other machines to shape metal with
pressure were $66 million, up 19%, from $55.5 million in
November 1989.</p>
