	<p class="article-leader">Richfield, Ohio -- His team had just beaten the Cleveland
Cavaliers here Saturday night, giving them a heady 27-3
record for the still-young National Basketball Association
season, but Rick Adelman didn't want to get ahead of himself.
   "Yeah, the wins are great, but we know we've got a long
way to go before the playoffs," declared the coach of the
Portland Trail Blazers. "We've got to keep our minds on the
game at hand, not on goals we've set for five or six months
from now."</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>He allowed, though, that it's been a nice ride so far.
"Streaks like the one we're having don't happen very often
even to very good teams, so we'd better enjoy it while we
can," he said. "If you're not having fun when you're winning,
you'd better get out of the game."</p>
<p>For better or worse, the Portlanders had scant time to
savor their success, because they had to pack their blazers
and hit the trail to Milwaukee for a Sunday night contest.
That would make four games in four different cities in five
nights, a not-untypical NBA road trip. If the pro-hoops
mercenaries could convert their frequent-flier miles to cash,
they'd be able to buy the airlines. They'd probably do a good
job with takeoffs and landings, and they'd certainly install
seats with more leg room.</p>
<p>No one, however, anticipated the flight the Blazers have
been on for the past two months. Last season's NBA runnersup
to the Detroit Pistons, they began the campaign modestly
enough, with a one-point victory over Houston at home. They
won their next 10 games by an average of 17 points, lost one,
and then won eight more in succession.</p>
<p>They've won at home (15-1) and on the road (12-2 through
Saturday). They've beaten such leggy steppers as the Pistons,
L.A. Lakers and Chicago Bulls, and the also-rans. Their
record after Saturday was three games better than that of the
next-best team, the resurgent Boston Celtics, and, with the
schedule more than one-third over, they led the league's
Pacific division by 7 1/2 games.</p>
<p>Perhaps most remarkably, the Blazers have done it without
placing a man in the league's top 10 in such individual
measures as scoring, rebounding, assists, steals or blocked
shots. This is a gang that spreads both the wealth and the
work. After 30 games, seven Portland players had scored more
than 300 points, and six had more than 100 rebounds.</p>
<p>"We all play defense, we all hit the boards and we all
pass the ball. And I don't mean just the starters, I mean all
the guys who play," says Clyde "The Glide" Drexler, a
6-foot-7 guard who's both All-Pro and All-Nickname, and is
the Blazers' brightest star. "You hear about some teams
having specialists, or role-players, but not us. Everybody
plays all the roles."</p>
<p>Lenny Wilkens, whose Cleveland team was the party of the
second part on Saturday, had a similar assessment. "They're
deep, they're fast, and they play together well," said the
coach. "They're the best team in basketball now, and if they
stay healthy there's no reason they can't end the season that
way."</p>
<p>A bare two seasons ago, the Blazers were part of the NBA
pack, a 39-43 bunch that had some dash but little else. Then
Adelman, an ex-Blazer player known for an even keel, took
charge as coach near that campaign's end, and the next year
management traded for veteran rebounder Buck Williams to
supplement holdover starters Drexler, guard Terry Porter,
forward Jerome Kersey and center Kevin Duckworth. The combo
clicked, and the 1989-90 Blazers added 20 regular-season wins
to their year-earlier total.</p>
<p>This season's key addition, via trade, is veteran guard
Danny Ainge. He was dealt away (to Sacramento) when the
Celtics embarked on a back-court youth movement a couple of
years ago, but his vintage whine has gone down nicely in the
Great Northwest. He and 6-foot-10 Cliff Robinson, a maturing
second-year man, have given the Blazers the bench strength
they previously lacked.</p>
<p>Several other factors have contributed to Portland's fast
start. A schedule that allowed them to play 11 of their first
15 games at home was one, and good luck with injuries was
another. None of the top-seven players had missed a game
through Saturday, although Kersey broke that string by
straining a calf muscle against the Cavs and may be out for
two weeks.</p>
<p>Finally, there's been a carryover from last year's
success. "In winning our conference, and getting to the
finals, we proved to ourselves we were for real," says
Drexler. "The guys couldn't wait for training camp to open.
Everybody showed up early, in shape, and ready to go. We knew
good things would happen if we went about it right."</p>
<p>Portland's effort against Cleveland on Saturday mirrored
what it has been doing all season. Seven Blazers scored in
double figures in the 120-114 win, led by Drexler's 28, and
nine of the 10 who participated grabbed rebounds. Against a
team whose main strength is its inside players, especially
Larry Nance and Brad Daughtery, the Blazers assaulted the
hoop with their usual elan, outscoring the home team 66-46
"in the paint."</p>
<p>Cleveland, 11-17 in the won-lost column going in, has been
plagued with injuries, and performed without two of its best
players, guard Mark Price and forward John Williams. On top
of that, guard Craig Ehlo was caught punching Duckworth (in
retaliation for an elbow shot the officials missed) and was
ejected in the first quarter.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, the Cavs put up a brave fight before a
rainy-night throng of 17,000, and trailed by just three
points -- 112-109 -- with slightly over two minutes left.</p>
<p>But then the Blazers pulled away, with everyone on the
floor helping. Porter's dash to the hoop set up a short
jump-shot basket by Duckworth, after which Porter hit a
19-footer of his own. Ainge corraled a loose ball. Williams
got a rebound and fed Drexler, who waited until two seconds
remained on the shot clock -- and 20 seconds on the game
clock -- before banking in a clinching three-pointer.</p>
<p>"Three pointers aren't my usual thing, but if I'm gonna
shoot 'em, I guess this is the year for it," grinned The
Glide.</p>
