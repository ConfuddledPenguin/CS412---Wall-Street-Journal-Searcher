	<p class="article-leader">Charter Medical Corp., already struggling to hold its
operations together, said it will post a net loss of about
$210 million for the year ended Sept. 30.
   The giant hospital chain also said it will write down
about $100 million in assets and reserves.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The loss, which compares with a net loss of $36.7 million
a year earlier, is higher than most analysts expected, and
could force the company to restructure its finances or
consider even more drastic measures, analysts say.</p>
<p>"It looks inevitable that they'll have to take" radical
steps, said George Pillari, president of Health Care
Investment Analysts Inc. in Baltimore.</p>
<p>Executives at Charter declined to be interviewed. But in a
Dec. 13 letter to employees, William A. Fickling Jr.,
president and chairman, said: "Industry changes, coupled with
some operating setbacks, have diminished the financial
`cushion' the company has historically maintained." As a
result, he said, Charter might pursue a "financial
restructuring."</p>
<p>Charter, based in Macon, Ga., is one of the largest
operators of psychiatric hospitals in the U.S. In the face of
a tightening market for psychiatric care, it has been
struggling under $1.6 billion in debt from a 1988
management-led buy-out. Since January, 2,600 employees have
been laid off as part of a series of cost-cutting measures.</p>
<p>The company provided no other figures Friday and said it
would delay filing its annual report until the middle of
January. Mr. Pillari, however, estimated that the company's
interest expenses totaled about $200 million in its latest
fiscal year, while operating profit totaled only $147
million.</p>
<p>"I don't see how they're going to make debt service
payments in the future," he said. "There's too much of a
gap."</p>
<p>One answer, Mr. Pillari said, might be for Charter to sell
off a number of its 89 psychiatric hospitals and focus on a
group of about 25 core facilities. "The underlying business
is in a good industry," he said. "It's not a rust-belt
company or an oil company. There are still millions and
millions of patient-days out there."</p>
<p>Indeed, the company has moved to sell or close some
operations, but has met with mixed success. One hospital in
Texas has been sold; a second in Arizona is about to be.
(Terms haven't been disclosed.) A plan, however, to sell and
lease back 12 facilities to Health Care Property Investors, a
Los Angeles real estate investment trust, for $76.2 million
was "mutually terminated," said a Charter spokesman.</p>
<p>The estimated $210 million loss marks the end of a brutal
year for Charter. In March, the company disclosed that
internal accounting errors would result in a second-quarter
charge of $28 million. (The final figure was $35 million.)
That led, in May, to a second-quarter loss of $67 million,
the company's biggest loss since going private in 1988. In
June, federal regulators began investigating allegations that
Charter had inflated Medicare and Medicaid bills for
psychiatric hospital care. (The investigation is continuing,
and Charter said it is cooperating with regulators.)</p>
<p>In July and again in August, Moody's Investors Service
Inc. lowered its ratings on Charter's debt, citing concerns
about declining occupancy rates at the company's hospitals
and deteriorating cash flow. Also in August, the Securities
and Exchange Commission began a review of Charter's buy-out,
examining whether the company misled investment banks about
its financial prospects. (That investigation, too, is
continuing; Charter said it believes its financial records
are proper.) And last month, Standard & Poor's Corp. cut its
ratings on Charter, warning that the company could default in
March unless it secures outside funding or gets more time to
pay its debts.</p>
<p>The problems have been exacerbated by turnover in the
company's executive suite. This year alone, Charter has gone
through three executive vice presidents for hospital
operations, firing one in the wake of the accounting fiasco
and turning aside his successor after only four months on the
job. Two weeks ago, the company was hit by the resignation of
two top executives: C. Michael Ford, chief financial officer,
and J. Rodney Laughlin, executive vice president of human
resources and development. No reason was given for their
departures.</p>
