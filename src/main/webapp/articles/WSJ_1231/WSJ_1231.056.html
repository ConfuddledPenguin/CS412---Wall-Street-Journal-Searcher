	<p class="article-leader">MONTEVIDEO, Uruguay -- Luis Alberto Lacalle, Uruguay's
president, is discovering that it's a long way from
Switzerland to Singapore.
   Uruguay was long known as the Switzerland of South
America, a small, peaceful, conservative country where cows,
sheep and people happily coexisted, the latter deriving a
comfortable living from the former.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>But this idyll was broken in the last two decades, when
Uruguay suffered such typically South American problems as
military dictatorship, terrorism, inflation and public
deficits. Now, Mr. Lacalle, who took office in March, aims to
turn his country into South America's Singapore, a bustling
financial, services and port hub of an integrated Southern
Cone of the continent.</p>
<p>"I want to put the country back into the modern world," he
says in an interview, pacing back and forth in his office.</p>
<p>But he faces a big problem: Wary of change, Uruguayans are
happy enough with the old ways. This is a country where cars
from the 1930s still roam the streets and where milk
deliveries in Montevideo, home to half the population of
three million, are still made by horse and buggy. "We want to
live in peace and tranquillity with a decent standard of
living," says Carlos Baraibar, political secretary of the
Broad Front, a left-wing coalition opposed to Mr. Lacalle.
"We're not going to let Lacalle change the national character
of the country."</p>
<p>This sort of widespread sentiment makes Uruguay a paradox:
The smallest and one of the richest countries per capita in
South America is the one most vocal in its opposition to the
free-market winds blowing throughout the continent. "It's a
small place, but it's pretty complicated," says a diplomat
based here.</p>
<p>The 49-year-old Mr. Lacalle has been getting a first-hand
view of the complications. Unions have organized scores of
general and sectoral strikes. Bank workers, for instance,
staged three months of work stoppages until they got twice
the 15% raise they were offered. Government bills to lift
existing state monopolies or sell off public companies are
gummed up in Congress. Polls show a population upset by the
quality of public services -- but also a majority opposed to
their privatization. The coalition government Mr. Lacalle
heads gets shakier by the day.</p>
<p>"I'm afraid I was a bit naive," Mr. Lacalle admits. "I
thought we could do all that in 100 days. It's difficult to
sow these kinds of seeds. We were brought up in a country
where the ethics of security overrode the ethics of change."</p>
<p>Critics say Mr. Lacalle has mainly himself to blame.
"There have been some achievements, but I definitely don't
think he's achieved the objectives he's set for himself,"
says Victor Zerbino, general manager of Banco de Boston, the
local unit of First National Bank of Boston.</p>
<p>Despite the government's success in cutting the fiscal
deficit to 2.5% of Uruguay's $8.5 billion gross domestic
product, from 6.5% last year, inflation is heading to an
estimated 130% for the year from 89% last year. Economists
attribute much of the rise to a government's exchange-rate
policy, designed to boost exports. Having made the fight
against inflation his top priority, Mr. Lacalle's failure has
cost him credibility, analysts say.</p>
<p>Moreover, they say, Mr. Lacalle has wasted time seeking to
work out a seemingly impossible consensus on his
privatization and "demonopolization" bills. Rather than
quickly submitting legislation upon taking office, he tabled
the bills to break up the state monopolies in alcohol
distillation, insurance, telecommunications and port
activities only in August. He has also fudged on
privatization, which will likely include Antel, the
telecommunications monopoly, and Pluna, the national air
carrier. Mr. Lacalle now talks of "reform of state
enterprises," or less than full privatization.</p>
<p>Mr. Lacalle says his style reflects his difficult
political situation. Elected with only 22% of the vote, Mr.
Lacalle's National Party, better known as the Blancos, is in
a fragile parliamentary coalition with the Rural Party, known
as the Colorados. "I don't have a majority, so how can I bang
on the table and say, `I want this and this,'" says Mr.
Lacalle. "If I'd sent the bill without consultations, they
would have said this arrogant know-it-all wants to ram bills
down parliament."</p>
<p>In fact, Mr. Lacalle's greatest foe is probably the
Uruguayans resistance to change. Having built one of Latin
America's only cradle-to-grave welfare systems, with generous
retirement and public-sector employment policies, Uruguayans
have come to rely on the state. "There's no official religion
here, but in reality there is one: statism," says Javier de
Haedo, one of Mr. Lacalle's economic advisers. "Half the
population here is socialist in the sense that they have the
religion of the state."</p>
<p>The public sector employs over 25% of the work force of
one million, and an additional 670,000 are drawing state
pensions. This makes it all the more difficult for Mr.
Lacalle to push through his program to roll back the state.
Compounding the problem is that unlike other Latin American
state companies, most of Uruguay's, though overstaffed, post
small profits because the government doesn't hold down their
rates to keep inflation under control.</p>
<p>Still, Mr. Lacalle is posting small successes.
International commercial banks recently agreed to a plan that
would reduce Uruguay's $1.6 billion debt to them through a
series of options. And the government has completed the sale
of long-troubled Banco Comercial to a consortium consisting
of Credit Suisse, Chemical Bank, Dresdner Bank and
Argentina's Banco General de Negocios. The sale shows the
banks' growing interest in Uruguay, whose banking secrecy,
liberal foreign exchange regulations and generous tax regime
have made it a haven for flight capital from Brazil and
Argentina. Banks hold $5 billion in deposits, 80% denominated
in dollars.</p>
<p>With Brazil, Argentina, Uruguay and Paraguay set to join
in a common market in 1994, Mr. Lacalle wants to further
develop the service sector, and analysts say integration
could be the battlehorse he needs to impose change on his
country. But even his advisers admit it will be a long
process.</p>
