	<p class="article-leader">Prime-time TV continues to plumb the depths of our social
problems, and never more so than in the next few weeks, when
the schedule crackles with hot-button issues of the most
galvanic sort: abortion, AIDS and, that theme-de-resistance,
child molestation.
   Tonight, in addition to her many other troubles, Rosie
O'Neill must defend a woman who has killed her own daughter
(CBS, 10-11 p.m. EST). On Wednesday, "48 Hours" provides a
gruesomely detailed portrait of health-care workers infected
with AIDS (CBS, 8-9 p.m. EST). The weekend brings the CBS
Sunday Movie "Bump in the Night" (9-11 p.m. EST), about a
college professor who molests boys -- very young boys. Next
week's episode of "Law & Order" focuses on an abortion clinic
bomber (NBC, Jan. 8, 10-11 p.m. EST).</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The next night we are back to AIDS, when the intrepid
district attorneys on ABC's "Equal Justice" (Jan. 9, 10-11
p.m. EST) prosecute an AIDS carrier who has infected a young
woman. No one can accuse the networks of ringing the new year
in on a frivolous note.</p>
<p>The "48 Hours" segment is, not surprisingly, the program
that packs the biggest punch, since it's a documentary
dealing in real AIDS cases. In the course of the action a
physician in charge of a hospital emergency room goes public
with the news that he has AIDS, something he's withheld from
patients and everyone else except a few members of the staff.
Often when he was on duty, the doctor reveals, he went off to
cry, because he felt worse than most of the patients he was
treating. The hospital officials, the lawyers in particular,
don't conceal their apprehension about the doctor's on-camera
revelations.</p>
<p>They have cause for concern, as the program's opening
report -- about the young woman federal health officials
believe contracted AIDS from her dentist -- forcefully bears
out. Kimberly Bergalis, a 22-year-old Florida woman, makes no
secret of her fury at the dentist (now dead of AIDS) for
concealing his condition; she is now suing the insurance
company that sent her to him. She spends much of the rest of
her time agitating publicly for patients' right to know
whether the health professionals treating them have AIDS or
are HIV-positive.</p>
<p>Most of the film's most dramatic reportage bears out the
view that many health professionals are at particular risk
for AIDS. This is where the program's troubles begin, for "48
Hours" -- like so much of the rest of the major media
treatment of AIDS -- labors under a heavy burden of political
constraint. These politics decree certain rules. First, AIDS
victims must be presented not simply as suffering fellow
humans deserving of our deepest concern, which they assuredly
are, but as heroes. Second, the rule as regards the conflict
between AIDS patients' privacy rights vs. public safety is
that privacy wins. Liberal principle dictates this, and
anyway, or so the prevailing argument goes, the danger to the
public is negligible.</p>
<p>Obedience to this second rule required some fancy stepping
on the part of the folks who put this "48 Hours" together.
What the reporters have filmed implies one thing, while what
the reporters say -- or more precisely what they declaim --
broadcasts another.</p>
<p>Shouldn't she consider the cost to AIDS sufferers -- the
stigmatization -- that would result if they were made to
disclose their condition? reporter Erin Moriarty asks Ms.
Bergalis. Particularly since the danger of AIDS transmission
by health professionals is so very small?</p>
<p>Such arguments about minimal risk cut no ice with Ms.
Bergalis, who responds, unanswerably, "But look at me -- I'm
the one that came down with it, and it took my life away."</p>
<p>The things the program writers could not bring themselves
to say outright are, in their absence, glaringly obvious. Any
concession, for example, that fear of being treated by an
AIDS-infected health professional might be something other
than hysteria or bias. But what the script will not say,
outright, the film does manage to show, with considerable
clarity.</p>
<p>One of the most striking scenes is of a trauma unit in a
Miami hospital, in which a young surgeon and others working
to save a gunshot victim are splattered full in the face with
blood and vomit that gets past masks, and gloves. This sort
of thing takes on a certain alarming significance, in light
of the statistics offered -- that one out of every five
people coming in with a gunshot wound is carrying the virus.</p>
<p>An AIDS-infected New York City pediatrician whose identity
is concealed says he hides his condition from his patients
because they don't need to know and because mothers with
babies "tend to be emotional."</p>
<p>"48 Hours" in short manages, despite shilly-shallying, to
deliver what is, in the end, a tough and harsh picture of one
aspect of the AIDS crisis.</p>
<p>In the fiction department, social-issues category, ABC's
"Equal Justice" is worth mentioning mainly because it is so
striking an example of the sort of thing that has been going
on in scriptwriting for a while. This is the kind of program
in which four or five different story lines are thrown in,
affording viewers the opportunity to graze or doze, depending
on which bores them least. A few minutes of sustained story
line is all we are asked to absorb before, bam, the action
lurches elsewhere -- which in the case of the AIDS segment is
a stroke of fortune for everyone concerned.</p>
<p>"Law & Order's" treatment of the theme of abortion, it
should be said, is in distinguished contrast to the rest of
these televised sermons. It is a commendably well-written
treatment of an abortion-clinic bomber. It cannot quite
escape unfairness, suggesting, as it inevitably does, a link
between the fanatics who bomb clinics and the pro-life
movement overall. One of the strengths of the series is its
casting, and to appreciate how true that is one has only to
look at the restrained and altogether hypnotizing performance
of Caroline Kava as the right-to-life group's leader. The
chief flaw in this script is the obviousness of the way it
wears its political heart on its sleeve. The script's last
line equates the right to legal abortion to the black
liberation from slavery -- a glorification of abortion that
even its most ardent advocates might consider a trifle
excessive.</p>
