	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- As the New Year opens, the gap is widening
between economists who say the worst of the recession is over
and those who say more bad news is yet to come.
   In recent weeks, economists generally have agreed that the
significant drop in fourth-quarter economic activity pushed
the nation into a recession. Now, however, the debate is
growing over when and how fast a recovery will start.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Debbie Johnson, an economist at Prudential-Bache
Securities here, believes the economy could start to pick up
early next year. While sticking to her forecast of a
fourth-quarter decline in gross national product of 2% to
2.5%, she says the nation's output of goods and services
could rise 2% in 1991's first quarter. "We've probably seen
the worst of it," she says.</p>
<p>That doesn't wash with Sung Won Sohn, chief economist at
Norwest Corp. in Minneapolis. "It doesn't make any sense to
me that the economy is going to recover quickly," he says.
Mr. Sohn argues that those in the optimistic camp incorrectly
trace most of today's economic woes to the Middle East crisis
and higher oil prices. He maintains that the problems stem
from the nation's heavy debt burden. Furthermore, citing an
increasing rate of credit-card delinquencies for even
smaller, less-expensive items, Mr. Sohn worries that
consumers, too, have taken on more debt than they can handle.</p>
<p>In the shorter term, economists find more room for
agreement. Many predict that December's economic data, while
still showing important declines, will not slump by the same
magnitude as November's. Further evidence of moderation may
arrive in this week's economic indicators.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, the purchasing managers' index for December
is due. Predictions for the index, which is compiled by the
National Association of Purchasing Management, are for a drop
of 0.5 to 1.3 percentage points from November's level of
41.3%. While still reflecting weak economic activity, that
range would be less than the 2.1% decline reported in
November. Generally, a reading above 50% indicates an
expanding economy, while a reading below 50% suggests
contraction.</p>
<p>Norwest's Mr. Sohn doesn't expect this month's purchasing
managers' report to be as bad as last month's, but that
doesn't necessarily mean the index has bottomed. He sees the
manufacturing sector of the economy continuing to
deteriorate, depressed further by poor Christmas sales. He
notes that the weakness in durable goods now is spreading
from big-ticket items such as refrigerators and laundry
appliances to smaller items such as toasters and cassette
tape players.</p>
<p>Similarly, economists don't expect to see the same sharp
plunge in employment during December that they witnessed in
November. On Friday, the government releases December's
unemployment rate and the tally on non-farm payrolls.</p>
<p>Kenneth Mayland, chief economist at Society Corp. in
Cleveland, sees the unemployment rate rising to 6.1% from
November's 5.9% and expects another cut in payroll jobs of
150,000. In November, a striking number of non-farm payroll
jobs -- 267,000 -- were eliminated.</p>
<p>While not willing to go so far as to say the worst of the
recession is over, Mr. Mayland does argue that an analysis of
past recessions shows that bigger payroll declines occur in
the second half of a recession than in the first. "Sharper
rates of decline could be consistent with an imminent rebound
of the economy," he says.</p>
<p>Other economic indicators due to be released this week
include new-home sales and construction spending for
November, and auto sales for mid-December. With consumer
confidence still discouragingly low and banks more carefully
scrutinizing loan applications, economists don't see much
room for improvement in home or auto sales for awhile. The
construction industry remains in a profound slump, though a
bulge in public spending lifted the October construction
figures.</p>
