	<p class="article-leader">VINEYARD, Utah -- Geneva Steel, citing a general decline
in steel prices, reported net income for the first quarter
ended Nov. 30 fell 39% on 6% lower revenue.
   Net dropped to $7.1 million, or 47 cents a share, from
$11.8 million, or $1.01 a share, for the year-earlier
quarter. Revenue dipped to $124.3 million from $132.2
million. Tons shipped eased to 340,000 from 344,000 a year
ago.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Increased operating, labor and freight costs as well as
unscheduled mill downtime in September hurt profit in the
quarter, Geneva Steel said.</p>
<p>The company's $239 million modernization program, which
includes building two basic oxygen furnaces, a coilbox, a
continuous caster and other rolling-mill improvements, is
scheduled for completion by September 1992. The upgrades are
designed to reduce operating costs and increase the quality
of its finished products.</p>
<p>Geneva makes hot-rolled sheet, plate and other steel
products for use primarily in central and western U.S.
markets.</p>
<p>The company said the Linde division of Union Carbide
Corp.'s Union Carbide Industrial Gases Inc. will build and
operate a $25 million oxygen plant to supply oxygen and other
needed gases to the new furnaces. It is scheduled for
completion in 1991's third quarter.</p>
