	<p class="article-leader">TWO LAWMAKERS FAULTED Bush for rejecting Iraq's Jan. 12
date for talks.
   Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole and Rep. Les Aspin,
chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, said the
president and Baghdad's Saddam Hussein must break the
stalemate over diplomatic talks. Dole, asserting that
Americans "are not yet committed to war," said he has
received indications from Iraq that Baghdad may show
flexibility on dates for the talks. Meanwhile, a U.S.
official said he believes EC foreign ministers will reaffirm
support for a Jan. 15 deadline for an Iraqi withdrawal from
Kuwait when they meet Friday.</p>

<p>Soviet police with bulldozers razed Moscow's
five-month-old "Tent City," a group of plastic and cardboard
shacks near the Kremlin that had sprung up in a gesture of
disillusionment with Gorbachev's reforms. An interior
ministry spokesman said that 47 people were rounded up, and
that 52 makeshift dwellings were destroyed.</p>
<p>Moldavia agreed to comply with a Kremlin order to
reconsider its law making Moldavian the republic's official
language. The republic's parliament acted in response to a
decree issued by Gorbachev, who has sought to defuse ethnic
tension in Moldavia.</p>

<p>About 40,000 Argentines gathered outside President Menem's
office in Buenos Aires to protest his pardon on Saturday of
key figures who served in the military dictatorship during
the 1970s "dirty war" on leftists. Among those pardoned were
former Presidents Videla and Viola and a co-founder of the
Montonero terrorist group.</p>

<p>China's leaders approved a vague five-year plan that
offers few changes or surprises but gives the government a
good deal of leeway to manage the economy. The plan was

<p>Israeli soldiers shot and wounded 14 Palestinians in the
Gaza Strip, where four people were killed Saturday by troops,

used to launch assaults against Israel.</p>

<p>Poland's premier-designate attempted to form a
transitional government that will rule until parliamentary
elections expected next spring. Jan Krzysztof Bielecki, 39, a
free-market economist, was named by President Walesa on
Saturday to take over from Mazowiecki, who quit after losing
to Walesa in last month's presidential vote.</p>

<p>Greek officials reversed themselves and said they won't go
ahead with plans to pardon Greece's jailed military
dictators. The scheduled pardons of leaders of the 1967-74
right-wing military government had provoked protests by
left-wing politicians as well as members of the conservative
government of Prime Minister Mitsotakis.</p>

<p>Two Algerian army deserters gave up after hijacking a
domestic airliner, freeing their hostages and ending a

was forced to land in the city of Annaba.</p>
