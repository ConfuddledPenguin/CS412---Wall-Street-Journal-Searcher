	<p class="article-leader">Southwestern Energy Co., Fayetteville, Ark., said its
Arkansas Western Gas Co. unit received final regulatory
approval from Arkansas and Missouri for rate increases
totaling $7.4 million annually.
   The company had requested a total of $15.3 million.
Arkansas granted increases of $6.5 million a year, Missouri
$900,000 a year. Most of the increases apply to residential
and small-business customers.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>In granting its boosts, Arkansas's public service
commission also initiated a review of the way natural gas
purchase costs are passed on to customers, Southwestern said.
The commission maintained that "certain regulatory and
contractual impediments" exist in Arkansas Western's system
that could prevent it from obtaining competitively priced
gas, Southwestern said.</p>
<p>The commission in particular described a longstanding
supply contract between Arkansas Western and another
subsidiary of Southwestern as "diametrically opposed" to
current, more flexible contracting provisions, Southwestern
said. The commission will take initial testimony March 6 and
has scheduled an April 16 hearing.</p>
