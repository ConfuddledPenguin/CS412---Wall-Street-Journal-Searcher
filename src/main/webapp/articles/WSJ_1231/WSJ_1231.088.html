	<p class="article-leader">PURCHASE, N.Y. -- International Paper Co. said a $2
billion lawsuit that alleges that the company and
Georgia-Pacific Corp. dumped dioxin and other pollutants into
three state rivers is "frivolous and completely without
foundation."
   The suit, which includes more than 1,800 plaintiffs,
alleges that the two paper companies knew their plants were
dumping toxins into the water, but continued to do so, posing
a "health risk to human beings, wildlife, aquatic life and
the environment in general."</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>James P. Melican, general counsel, said International
Paper's mill in Moss Point, Miss., meets all environmental
permits and limits imposed by state and federal agencies.</p>
<p>"This is a manufactured lawsuit filed by a handful of
plaintiffs' attorneys who have been aggressively soliciting
clients for months, including by advertising in local
newspapers," Mr. Melican said. The company will "aggressively
defend" the suit, he added.</p>
<p>The suit, filed in Jackson County, Miss., chancery court,
seeks to enjoin the companies from continuing the alleged
practices. It asks for a judgment of $150,000 plus $1 million
in punitive damages, for each plaintiff.</p>
<p>In Atlanta, a spokeswoman for Georgia-Pacific Corp. said
the company still hadn't seen a copy of the lawsuit. She said
there "isn't any merit" to allegations outlined in a story
about the suit in Friday's Wall Street Journal. She added
that Georgia-Pacific "plans to defend itself vigorously."</p>
