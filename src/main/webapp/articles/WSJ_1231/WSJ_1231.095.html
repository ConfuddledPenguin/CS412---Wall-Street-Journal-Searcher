	<p class="article-leader">Tokyo stock prices slipped late in Friday's half-day
session, as investors took profits ahead of a string of New
Year holidays that will keep the market closed until
Thursday.
   In London, shares closed lower, after a lackluster week in
which Christmas celebrations ruled out the prospect of any
genuine business activity in the stock market.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>In Tokyo, the Nikkei index of 225 issues was down 91.99
points at 23848.71 at the end of the morning session. On
Thursday, the index gained 53.14 points. The Tokyo Stock
Price Index, or Topix, of all first section issues, which
gained 10.74 points Thursday, fell 6.72, or 0.39%, to
1733.83. First section volume was estimated at 180 million
shares, up from an estimated 150 million in Thursday's
morning session. Declining issues outnumbered advancing
issues 599 to 290, and 204 issues were unchanged.</p>
<p>The second section index, which added 3.99 points
Thursday, was down 10.91, or 0.4%, to close at 2711.15.
Second section volume was estimated at three million shares,
compared with 4.5 million shares a day earlier.</p>
<p>The Nikkei advanced to Friday's intraday high of 24055.29
in the first hour of the session, helped by buying by
arbitragers and some brokerage houses, traders said. The
market gave up the gains later, as declines in stock-futures
prices discouraged buying interest, while approaching margin
calls also put downward pressure on prices of high-technology
and other equities.</p>
<p>Considering a possible worsening of the continuing Middle
East crisis and the uncertain political situation in the
Soviet Union, "Investors felt it risky to pass the New Year's
Eve with stocks in their hands," said Atsushi Koishihara,
general manager of stock trading at Taiheiyo Securities.</p>
<p>Some participants expected that the Nikkei index would
finish Friday's session above the psychologically significant
24000 level. Though the index recovered from the intraday low
of 23770.72 near the end of the session, the market lacked
the strength to push stock prices up further, traders said.</p>
<p>Traders said the Nikkei index could have risen to 26000 in
December if it hadn't been for the shocking news of Soviet
Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze's resignation.</p>
<p>"I think the market ended the year at an adequate level,"
said Hiroyuki Murai, general manager of stock trading at
Nikko Securities. He said domestic interest rates are
expected to start softening in the first quarter, which has
recently lent support to interest rate-sensitive shares.</p>
<p>But the recent swelling of stock-futures arbitrage
accounts indicates the possibility of strong pressure from
arbitrage selling ahead of expirations of the March futures
and options contracts in mid-March.</p>
<p>Among the most actively traded stocks on Friday, Nippon
Steel closed unchanged at 448 yen ($3.28), Sumitomo Metal
added 2 to 458; Hitachi Ltd. rose 10 to 1,130, Honshu Paper
fell 50 to 1,760, Mitsubishi Heavy Industries eased 5 to 668,
Tokyo Electric Power fell 50 to 3,650, Kawasaki Steel was
down 6 at 410, NKK was up 1 at 402, Tokyo Gas eased 2 to 565,
and Marubeni lost 5 to 660.</p>
<p>In London, most British fund managers chose to plan to
unwind positions Monday, before the official two-day close of
trading on the stock exchange. The majority of operators
remained absent from the market Thursday and Friday, with
business expected to stay muted until after the New Year
break.</p>
<p>The quiet tone of the holiday period had led some
observers to forecast small gains for Friday in the absence
of fresh bearish news. But Wall Street's weak opening tone
and thin trading conditions helped to foster London's modest
losses for the day. Also behind the retreat, brokers said,
were bearish data on the U.S. leading indicators for
November, as they underlined recessionary conditions in the
U.S.</p>
<p>The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index ended
down 7.4 points at 2160.4. The intraday high was 2170.4, and
the day's worst level was 2160.0.</p>
<p>Associated British Foods shares closed a penny lower at
420 pence ($7.93). The company said Friday that shareholders
approved the #880 million ($1.66 billion) sale of its British
Sugar unit to Berisford International. Berisford shares
finished 2 higher at #18 ($33.97).</p>
<p>ECC, an industrial materials concern, closed a penny lower
at 351. The company said Friday that it completed its
previously reported acquisition of Georgia Kaolin for $340
million.</p>
<p>Among shares that bucked the market's downward trend, the
electronics group Thorn EMI finished 4 higher at 677; Carlton
Communications gained 5 to 396; and the beverage concern
Grand Metropolitan rose 4 to 677. Traders noted that several
stocks were higher, following share-purchase recommendations
in domestic newspapers.</p>
<p>Water company shares had a strong session, as their
defensive stature attracted investors. Severn Trent rose 3 to
247, Thames Water added 2 to 275, and Anglian finished a
penny better at 274.</p>
<p>Electricity shares had a weaker session, in fairly active
trading. The electricity package, comprising shares in all of
the recently privatized regional electricity companies,
closed 25 pence lower at #14.58 a unit.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, share prices closed higher in Stockholm and
Brussels, and lower in Paris and Frankfurt. Stocks were mixed
in Amsterdam, Madrid and Zurich and flat in Milan. South
African gold stocks closed weaker. Friday was the last
trading day of the year in Frankfurt. Zurich's market will be
closed Monday through Wednesday. Brussels had a late surge in
activity from so-called window dressing, in which investors
dump speculative stocks in an effort to make their portfolios
look better at year end. Stockholm's rise and Madrid's late
surge were attributed to window dressing activity.</p>
<p>Equities closed lower in Hong Kong and higher in
Wellington, and were little changed in Sydney and mixed in
Singapore and Manila; some Manila gains were attributed to
window dressing. The session marked the last trading day of
1990 for Manila, Sydney and Wellington. The stock markets in
Taipei and Seoul were closed Friday.</p>
