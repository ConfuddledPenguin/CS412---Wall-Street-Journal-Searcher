	<p class="article-leader">MANILA, the Philippines -- The Philippine gross national
product (GNP) managed to grow at a slower pace of 3.1% during
the year, according to advanced estimates reported Friday by
the National Economic Development Authority.
   This compares with 5.7% growth in 1989 and 6.58% in 1988.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>A series of natural calamities -- severe drought, an
earthquake and typhoons -- the Persian Gulf crisis and a
wider budget deficit pulled down the country's economic
performance, the agency said.</p>
<p>The GNP measures the value of a country's output of goods
and services.</p>
<p>The agency's advanced estimates placed personal
consumption at a higher growth of 6.2%, compared with 5.7% a
year earlier. Government consumption slacked to 3.7%, from
6.2%.</p>
