	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.
liquidated Capitol Bank & Trust Co. and began paying off
depositors after the Massachusetts banking commissioner
closed the Boston bank.
   The FDIC said it decided to liquidate the bank, which had
assets of $464.2 million, after failing to get an acceptable
bid to purchase the institution.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>When the agency liquidates a bank, it pays depositors in
full up to the federal limit of $100,000. Customers with
accounts larger than that usually receive at least part
payment on the balance as the FDIC sells off the bank's
assets. The FDIC said it would make immediate advance
payments of 45% of the uninsured deposits. Depositors could
get additional payments on uninsured amounts later.</p>
<p>The bank, which was closed on Friday, had 28,000
depositors with deposits of $438.1 million. These amounts
include $25 million held by 300 depositors with accounts of
more than $100,000.</p>
<p>Bank liquidations and depositor losses are relatively
rare. In 1990, the FDIC closed 168 banks, and the accounts
were fully protected in 148 of those banks.</p>
