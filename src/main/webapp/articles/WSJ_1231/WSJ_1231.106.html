	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- Experience pays.
   That, in brief, is the conclusion the Securities and
Exchange Commission staff reached after analyzing how
securities exchanges coped with the stock market's mini-crash
Oct. 13, 1989, when the Dow Jones Industrial Average plunged
190.58 points in the final 90 minutes of trading. The study
found that the exchanges had repaired many of the weaknesses
revealed by the far scarier market crash two years earlier,
when the industrials dropped 508 points in one day.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Nevertheless, the study by the SEC's division of market
regulation found room for improvement. Exchanges should
consider several changes "to improve their ability to
function as efficiently and effectively in turbulent markets
as in stable markets," the study said. In particular, the
report said it found some "very troubling" conditions in the
markets for index options, which allow speculators and
hedgers to bet on price changes in stock indexes, such as the
Standard & Poor's 500.</p>
<p>The report recommended that the New York and American
stock exchanges develop more objective standards for
measuring the performance of specialists, who make markets in
stocks by balancing orders to buy and sell shares. The agency
repeated its concern that specialists need more capital.</p>
<p>Exchange officials reached after the report was issued
Friday said they hadn't seen the 173-page report and couldn't
comment on it.</p>
<p>In general, the study contains reassuring news about the
steps exchanges have taken to maintain fair and orderly
markets in the face of sudden surges in trading volume and
sharp price fluctuations.</p>
<p>Market performance "has improved substantially during
periods of high price volatility and trading volume as a
result of the implementation of many of the recommendations"
following the crash of Black Monday, Oct. 19, 1987. Acting on
post-crash studies, the exchanges bolstered their operational
systems and took steps to prevent highly volatile markets
from spinning out of control.</p>
<p>Although options exchanges performed "significantly
better" in 1989 than two years earlier, "concerns about the
ability of the options exchanges to provide a continuous
market in stock-index options during extreme market
conditions, especially when the primary stock-index futures
contracts have ceased trading, resurfaced during October
1989," the report said.</p>
<p>To provide more reliable trading conditions for index
options in highly volatile markets, the SEC staff recommended
that exchanges consider automatically halting index-option
trading when markets in the index futures are closed
temporarily by the "circuit breakers" designed to stabilize
turbulent markets. In addition, the report recommended better
procedures for reopening trading in index options and higher
performance standards for specialists on options exchanges.</p>
<p>This is the second report the SEC staff has released on
the 1989 mini-crash. A study released in May looked at
trading patterns.</p>
