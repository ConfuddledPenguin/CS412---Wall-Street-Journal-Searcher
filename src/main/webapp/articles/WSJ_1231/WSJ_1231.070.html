	<p class="article-leader">LONDON -- The dollar isn't likely to begin a sustained
recovery until the second half of 1991, when the U.S. economy
has started to climb out of its slump and U.S. authorities
have room to boost interest rates again, international
economists forecast.
   They predict that while the Persian Gulf crisis will
continue to provide limited support for the dollar in the
early months of 1991, there is still a high risk that the
U.S. currency will fall back to its 1990 lows before the
middle of the year.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"In the first quarter, the dollar will remain vulnerable
to {further} U.S. economic decline and further Fed easing,"
predicted David Morrison, chief international economist at
Goldman Sachs International in London.</p>
<p>Indeed, on Friday the dollar dropped in very light trading
in reaction to further indications the U.S. economy is
weakening rapidly. In late New York trading, the greenback
was quoted at 1.4936 marks and 134.85 yen, down from 1.5255
marks and 136.40 yen late Thursday in New York.</p>
<p>In early Monday trading in Tokyo, the dollar was at 134.32
yen, down from Friday's Tokyo close of 136.05 yen. Meanwhile,
the dollar was trading at 1.4925 marks, down from 1.5210
marks Friday.</p>
<p>Michel Girardin, head of foreign exchange research at
Union Bank of Switzerland in Zurich, warned that a conflict
in the Middle East will trigger a short-term dollar rally.
But he said this "support will soon disappear as the market
starts to concentrate again on U.S. economic fundamentals."</p>
<p>Economists also see little chance that the Group of Seven
leading industrialized countries will run to the dollar's
aid, because member nations seem to be at odds on the issue.</p>
<p>How long and how strongly the Gulf crisis will work in the
dollar's favor remains to be seen. Most economists think
uncertainty about the chances for an armed conflict is the
main factor preventing the U.S. currency from falling at the
moment. They suggest that this could make the currency
vulnerable to a downturn if a war starts and sentiment
swiftly refocuses on the U.S. economic slowdown and the
possibility of further reductions in U.S. interest rates.</p>
<p>Nigel Rendell, international economist at James Capel &
Co., says he expects the U.S. federal funds rate to decline
one-half of a percentage point to about 6 1/2% in the first
quarter of 1991. About the same time, Germany will probably
raise interest rates another notch and further undermine
support for the dollar, he predicted. The federal funds rate
is the interest rate banks charge each other for overnight
loans.</p>
<p>Mr. Rendell predicted the dollar could drop to 1.45 marks
in the second quarter. UBS's Mr. Girardin thinks it could
even fall below 1.40 marks. The dollar's all-time low was
1.4625 marks, set Dec. 10.</p>
<p>"I would be surprised to see any rebound in the dollar
until there are signs of the {U.S.} recession passing," Mr.
Girardin said. Most economists don't expect any such signs of
recovery to appear until midyear. By then, they also expect
signs of a slowdown in Japan and Germany.</p>
<p>How far the dollar recovers will depend largely on how
quickly U.S. authorities increase interest rates. Some
economists suggest that the need to attract funds for the
Treasury's massive refunding programs will create pressure to
nudge rates higher as soon as possible.</p>
<p>But Robert Thomas, senior international economist at
Midland Montagu & Co. in London, said officials will have to
show caution because the economic recovery is likely to be
gradual and the fragile state of the U.S. financial system
will argue against any abrupt credit-tightening.</p>
<p>By contrast, German rates are widely expected to rise
another half to full percentage point in the first half of
1991 as the Bundesbank attempts to curb inflationary
expectations kindled by last October's reunification of East
and West Germany.</p>
<p>German inflation is likely to have peaked by the middle of
1991, though, and with the mark's strength depressing export
volumes and economic growth starting to slow, authorities
should be more receptive to lower interest rates and a weaker
mark, economists say.</p>
<p>Japanese interest rates are also expected to rise early in
1991 because the Bank of Japan remains concerned about high
wage demands and persistently high money-supply growth.</p>
<p>However, economists doubt that Japan will tighten policy
significantly, given signs that growth could slow sharply
next year. At the same time, Mr. Girardin of UBS added, the
yen isn't likely to benefit much from higher rates, which
would merely increase fears of a possible collapse in land
prices that would prompt another shakeout in Japan's stock
market.</p>
<p>Such concerns, says Mr. Thomas of Midland, could force a
decline in Japanese rates well before German rates head down
in 1991. And, after falling as low as 120 yen in the first
half of 1991, the dollar could recover to its current level
of around 135 yen by the end of 1991, he predicted.</p>
<p>This year, the dollar fell to a low of about 123.50 yen in
mid-October before rebounding as high as 137.05 yen near the
end of the year.</p>
<p>On the Commodity Exchange in New York Friday, gold for
current delivery settled at $394 an ounce, up $8.60.
Estimated volume was a moderate 3.5 million ounces.</p>
<p>In early trading in Hong Kong Monday, gold was quoted at
$391 an ounce.</p>
