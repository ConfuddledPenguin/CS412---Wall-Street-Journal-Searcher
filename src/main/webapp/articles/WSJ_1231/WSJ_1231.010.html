	<p class="article-leader">ATLANTA -- Equifax Inc. and Telecredit Inc. said
shareholders of both companies approved Equifax's acquisition
of Telecredit in a stock swap valued at $513 million.
   The merger makes Telecredit a wholly owned subsidiary of
Equifax through a tax-free exchange of 2.86 shares of Equifax
for each share of Telecredit. That number was raised from
2.69 in November to compensate for a decline in Equifax stock
value.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Equifax provides services such as insurance information
reporting, credit verification and direct-mail marketing
assistance. The company said Lee Ault will remain chief
executive officer of Telecredit, which is based in Los
Angeles. The company's main operations are in Tampa, Fla.,
and its primary services are check authorization and
credit-card processing.</p>
