	<p class="article-leader">With his major Iran-Contra prosecutions in a shambles,
Lawrence Walsh is reduced to going after one of his own.
Jeffrey Toobin, who joined Mr. Walsh's crew soon after law
school, has written a book that Mr. Walsh is doing his best
to suppress.
   We don't know exactly what's in "Opening Arguments: A
Young Lawyer's First Case -- U.S. v. Oliver North," because
Mr. Toobin and his would-be publishers at Viking fear
criminal prosecution if they dare send anyone a copy. It's
unlikely that Mr. Toobin, a former writer for the liberal New
Republic, criticizes Mr. Walsh's performance as strongly as,
say, we would. What we do know is that Mr. Walsh's
so-far-successful prior restraint yields a fine sense of
being on the receiving end of an independent counsel's wrath.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>When Mr. Toobin, now 30 years old, left the independent
counsel's office in 1989, he agreed to have anything he wrote
reviewed to make sure it divulged no confidential information
or violated the criminal prohibition against leaking grand
jury information. The CIA and Justice Department both quickly
approved the book, so it apparently contains no national
security or grand jury secrets.</p>
<p>Yet Mr. Walsh refuses to grant his permission to publish.
The passages he finds objectionable remain under court seal.
He asked that the Justice Department's Public Integrity
Section bring a criminal case against Mr. Toobin, which
Justice refused. According to Mr. Toobin's court papers, Mr.
Walsh even tried to get him fired from his new job as an
assistant federal prosecutor in Brooklyn. The FBI started
asking Mr. Toobin's friends about him. Mr. Toobin finally
decided to sue his former boss, citing Mr. Walsh's
"stonewalling, specious objections and intimidation." He
hopes to get judicial approval of his right to publish at a
hearing this week.</p>
<p>The First Amendment supposedly covered the threat of prior
restraint, though we do have some problems with prosecutors
divulging information, especially against individuals who
were never indicted and so could not defend against any
accusations. Mr. Walsh himself will write a report to
Congress that almost certainly will smear unindicted
officials, perhaps even President Bush. For that matter, Mr.
Toobin says that Mr. Walsh told him he planned to write his
own book on Iran-Contra. Any notion that prosecutors have a
special obligation to keep silent out of court began to
disappear with several books by Watergate prosecutors.</p>
<p>We doubt that any high principle is at stake here.
Instead, we suspect Mr. Walsh simply fears the embarrassment
of disclosure. The Viking promotional material promises that
the book will "trace the complex legal and political
struggles" of the prosecution, including "within the office
itself." Last year, Mr. Toobin got a letter from Mr. Walsh's
office objecting to references "to matters which were and are
totally internal to the Office of Independent Counsel,
including discussions of staff meetings." Sounds like
fascinating reading. We wonder if anyone on the staff warned
of the legal problems with the prosecutions.</p>
<p>Mr. Walsh's conviction of Oliver North even on the minor
charges was overturned because he used evidence that Congress
had immunized. A similar fate awaits the John Poindexter
conviction. Newspapers that once cheered on Mr. Walsh's
crusade now wish he'd just go away.</p>
<p>As we have said, this has been a political prosecution
from the beginning, which Mr. Walsh made worse by
grandstanding instead of following the law. While he waits
for court permission to publish, Mr. Toobin should add a
chapter on this final lesson from the unsupervised and
unaccountable prosecutor Walsh.</p>
