	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- CS First Boston Inc. has a New Year's gift for
hundreds of senior employees: a fat salary raise.
   But the employees are far from thrilled. That's because
late last week they also were required to sign an agreement
that authorizes the big securities firm under certain
circumstances to yank back as much as 40% of their 1990 cash
bonuses.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The raise, which is effective in 1991, increases
directors' base salaries to between $150,000 and $200,000
from the current $100,000. Managing directors will receive
$200,000 to $250,000, up from the current $150,000, people
familiar with the firm said.</p>
<p>But here's the hitch: Salary alone typically is just a
tiny part of overall compensation. Even in a down year, such
as 1990, a bonus may exceed 80% of total compensation. And
bonuses at CS First Boston are down roughly 40% this year,
according to the firm's executives.</p>
<p>Making matters more difficult, employees say, is the
agreement they recently were asked to sign. That agreement,
given to employees on Dec. 20 and required to be signed by
Dec. 27, stipulated that those who quit before the end of
1992 must give 40% of their 1990 cash bonus back to CS First
Boston. If they leave within three years, they also give back
all or part of their 1990 bonus that they received in CS
First Boston stock, which made up about half their 1990
compensation package.</p>
<p>"The net of the equation is that overall compensation is
going to be factored down at a time when {employees are}
facing a potential penalty" for leaving, says Jeffrey L.
Liddle, an attorney with the New York firm Liddle, O'Connor,
Finkelstein & Robinson who represents securities-firm
employees.</p>
<p>CS First Boston officials declined to comment on the
compensation changes or agreement.</p>
<p>The firm's salary strategy is part of a plan under which
Switzerland's CS Holding agreed last month to pump $300
million in equity into its CS First Boston unit, parent of
investment bank First Boston Corp.</p>
<p>Mr. Liddle also contends that employees didn't have enough
time to consider the accord's ramifications. "They gave this
thing to people to sign over the Christmas holiday," making
it more difficult to get a private attorney and without much
time to think about it, he says.</p>
<p>First Boston officials privately retort that employees
have known about the proposed changes informally for several
weeks.</p>
<p>In a separate internal memo, the firm said employees who
aren't asked to sign an employment agreement will be paid at
least 60% of their cash bonus in the next two weeks. "Any
remaining cash payments are scheduled to be paid on or about
February 15, 1991," the memo said.</p>
