	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- The U.S. paper industry charged that European
producers of magazine-grade paper are dumping their products
at below-market prices and pushing it out of that segment of
the business.
   The American Paper Institute said its Committee to
Safeguard the U.S. Coated Groundwood Paper Industry filed an
anti-dumping petition with the Department of Commerce and the
International Trade Commission. It said the price
undercutting by European paper companies range from 28% to
88% of fair market value, currently about $800 a ton. Coated
groundwood paper is used primarily for magazines, catalogs
and commercial printing.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>A. Paul Victor, an attorney at the New York firm Weil,
Gotshal & Manges who represents the committee, said he
believes it is the first such trade action by the U.S. paper
industry in more than a decade. He said the petition
"contains no allegation of government subsidies" in Europe to
paper makers. "It's all a matter of companies making private
pricing decisions" to garner market share in the U.S., he
said.</p>
<p>Based on the paper institute's recent 1990 capacity survey
for U.S. paper makers, coated groundwood production for the
year is expected to be about 4.4 million tons, indicating a
market of about $3.5 billion. Mr. Victor estimated imports
are about $300 million. But according to various industry
statistics, imports in this category have been growing, more
than four-fold in the last decade.</p>
<p>The institute represents substantially all U.S. producers
of paper and pulp, and said the committee's member companies
account for about 80% of shipments of the product. Nine
countries were named -- Austria, Belgium, Britain, Finland,
France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands and Sweden -- as
bases for various under-pricing producers. A copy of the
petition wasn't immediately available to identify specific
European companies.</p>
<p>"The European companies have dramatically increased their
capacity for making this product and are using the U.S. as
the prime market in which to sell their excess capacity,"
said Virgil K. Horton Jr., the institute's vice president for
paper products.</p>
<p>As a consequence, Mr. Horton said, U.S. paper makers are
"suffering from decreases in productivity, efficiency and
profitability, resulting in a drop in investment levels,
reduced employment opportunities, and an inability to justify
the dedication of capital to coated groundwood paper
operations."</p>
