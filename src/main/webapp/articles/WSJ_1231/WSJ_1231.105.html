	<p class="article-leader">HQ Office Supplies Warehouse Inc. said its board reached
"an agreement in principle" with its affiliate and former
subsidiary, HQ Office International Inc., to complete a
merger proposed on Sept. 4. The operator of office supply
stores currently owns 25% of HQ Office International.
   The transaction is subject to approval of the shareholders
of HQ Office International, regulatory approvals, and other
closing conditions. HQ Office Supplies said it expects the
merger will be completed in early 1991.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The company also said it entered into "a definitive
agreement" for the sale of substantially all its HQ Office
Supplies Warehouse retail stores in Southern California to
Staples Inc., and "an agreement in principle" to sell its
stores in Northern California and Las Vegas, Nev., to BizMart
Inc.</p>
<p>HQ Office Supplies said its "repositioning" is due in part
to its inability to close financing on a $40 million private
preferred equity placement during the fall of 1990. In
addition, the company said it was hurt earlier this year by
delays on the part of its underwriter.</p>
