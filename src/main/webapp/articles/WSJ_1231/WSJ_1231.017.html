	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- The self-regulatory body for the
over-the-counter stock market is considering imposing a new
rule designed to make it tougher for bearish investors to
spark a big sell-off in an OTC stock.
   The National Association of Securities Dealers today is
mailing out requests for public comment on whether to impose
the new curb, known as an "uptick rule."</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Already in place on the competing New York and American
stock exchanges, uptick rules are designed to curb abuses of
short-selling -- the practice of betting that a stock's price
will fall rather than rise. Short-sellers borrow stock and
immediately sell it, hoping to profit later when they
purchase cheaper shares to return to the lender.</p>
<p>Critics of short-selling have long charged that the
bad-news bears can trigger a price avalanche by selling
heavily just as prices are falling. Under an uptick rule,
short-selling is forbidden except at moments when the last
previous trade in a stock was higher -- that is, made on an
uptick.</p>
<p>"We are getting a growing number of requests from
companies and investors" for an uptick rule or similar test,
says NASD President Joseph R. Hardiman. "They have the
perception -- and I suggest it is just that -- that it's
easier to sell short a Nasdaq-listed security than a
comparable exchange-listed security." Nasdaq is the
computerized market that handles OTC trades.</p>
<p>"We have lost some companies to the exchanges this year
because of the absence of a comparable uptick test," Mr.
Hardiman adds, declining to name those companies. Nearly 75
companies defected to the exchanges from Nasdaq this year,
less than 2% of all Nasdaq companies and about the same rate
as last year.</p>
<p>The Securities and Exchange Commission first imposed an
uptick rule on the major exchanges in 1938 following public
outcry over stock-price swoons of the Depression era. This
year, regulators have faced renewed pressure to monitor
short-selling, as bank stocks among others have become
popular targets. The total amount of stock sold short on the
two major exchanges and Nasdaq hit record levels this fall,
reflecting widespread gloom about the economy and the Mideast
crisis.</p>
<p>The NASD's move comes as both the SEC and lawmakers are
dusting off proposals to control short-selling abuses. Next
month, the SEC staff will present the full commission with a
year-old suggestion that short-sellers be required to
publicly disclose short positions of 5% or more of a
company's common shares outstanding, said Richard Ketchum,
director of the SEC's division of market regulation.</p>
<p>A draft bill embracing a similar provision is expected to
be introduced in the next session of Congress by Rep. Doug
Barnard (D., Ga.), and prompted the SEC review, Mr. Ketchum
said. The Association of Publicly Traded Companies, a
Washington trade group of smaller companies, has actively
lobbied for the disclosure requirement. Mr. Ketchum, however,
noted that he has previously questioned whether such a
restriction would be effective enough to justify the expense
of implementing it.</p>
<p>Investors, company officials, regulators and traders are
divided on whether further requlation of short-sellers would
discourage some professionals from ganging up on OTC stocks.</p>
<p>An uptick rule "would prevent people from unmercifully
banging a stock down, which creates its own version of panic
among regular holders," said John LaPorte, manager of T. Rowe
Price Associates' New Horizons Fund of Baltimore. "I'm happy
to hear it's going to be considered."</p>
<p>Others, however, question how effective the limit has been
on exchange-listed shares. "The general consensus indicates
that the uptick rule really doesn't prevent (abusive)
shorting," said John Guion, president of the Association of
Publicly Traded Companies. A 1976 SEC staff study of the
so-called "tick test" concluded that it was costly and
ineffective.</p>
<p>"Its most important benefit would be to keep the exchanges
from beating Nasdaq over the head with the fact that they
have an uptick rule and Nasdaq doesn't," Mr. Guion added.</p>
<p>Two companies that now trade on the New York Stock
Exchange say they haven't seen any noticeable change in the
heavy short-selling of their stocks since they left Nasdaq.</p>
<p>"It didn't seem to make much of a difference for us," says
a spokeswoman for L.A. Gear, which reported a short position
of more than 6.2 million shares in mid-December -- more than
one-third of the shares of the athletic-footwear maker. The
short position in L.A. Gear dropped more than 22% within six
months after the company's 1989 listing on the New York
exchange, but resumed climbing this year as the company's
1990 earnings fell below the previous year's. At Friday's
close of 13 5/8, down 3/4, L.A. Gear is trading at less than
a third of the 50 3/8 peak reached in June.</p>
<p>Golden Valley Microwave, which made headlines starting in
1988 as one of the most popular short-selling targets in the
OTC market, still attracts bears. "If you look at the
activity and the short position, it's actually greater now
than it was a couple of years ago," says a spokesman for the
Minneapolis maker of microwave-oven foods. Since it peaked at
25 7/8 in June, Golden Valley's stock has toppled to Friday's
close of 10 1/4, down 3/8, as the company warned of flat
earnings.</p>
<p>Traders, who have no love for increased regulation and who
earn commissions from the shorts' trades, aren't lobbying for
any uptick rule for the OTC market. "It wouldn't make a
difference," says E.E. "Buzz" Geduld, president of Herzog,
Heine & Geduld in New York. "People still short stocks on the
New York exchange" even with its uptick rule, he says.</p>
<p>The nation's largest short-selling pool is increasingly
active in exchange-listed stocks, says Joseph Feshbach, who
oversees the nearly $1 billion pool of short positions for
Stockbridge Partners of Palo Alto, Calif. "We're short a lot
of exchange-listed stocks now and it hasn't made one bit of
difference," he said.</p>
<p>Mr. Feshbach conceded that an uptick rule would limit the
number of transactions his firm could execute on the OTC
market. But he questioned whether the rule could be easily
implemented. Unlike the auction-type market or the exchanges,
where orders are funneled to one specialist and result in
single "last" trades, the OTC market consists of multiple
negotiations among dealers.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>Friday's Market Activity</p>
<p>Over-the-counter stocks edged higher in moderately active
year-end trading.</p>
<p>The Nasdaq Composite Index inched up 0.15 to 371.20, a
0.04% gain, but ended the week 0.6% lower. Trading
accelerated Friday to 132.3 million shares from 102.7 million
Thursday. Declining issues outpaced advancers, 994 to 874.</p>
<p>The OTC's most active issues were mixed. MCI
Communications, the day's most active stock, eased 1/4 to 18
3/4, Sun Microsystems fell 1/4 to 21 7/8, United Healthcare
slipped 1/8 to 23 and Apple Computer declined 1/2 to 43.</p>
<p>CoreStates Financial, the day's second most active stock,
closed unchanged at 31 5/8; Oracle Systems rose 3/8 to 8 and
Intel added 7/8 to 37 7/8.</p>
<p>VeloBind skidded 2 1/8 to 7. The U.S. Department of
Justice confirmed that it will ask a federal court to block
General Binding's proposed $9.77-a-share acquisition of
VeloBind, on antitrust grounds. VeloBind is a Fremont,
Calif., maker of book and document binding equipment and
General Binding, which fell 1 to 15, is a Northbrook, Ill.,
maker of business machines and supplies.</p>
<p>Great Lakes Bancorp slipped 1 1/2 to 8. The Ann Arbor,
Mich., savings bank said that it plans to add between $15
million and $18 million to its reserves and to separately
write off a portion of its good will. As a result, the thrift
said that it expects to report a fourth-quarter loss and a
loss for the year.</p>
<p>Applied Biosystems jumped 2 to 11 1/4. Merrill Lynch
biotechnology analyst Stuart Weisbrod upgraded his
intermediate-term investment opinion on the Foster City,
Calif., biotechnology company to "above average" from
"neutral," citing the increased demand he expects for the
company's instruments.</p>
