	<p class="article-leader">United National Bancorp said it expects to post a loss for
the fourth quarter but a profit for the full year, after
adding $2.2 million to its provision for possible loan
losses.
   The Branchburg, N.J., bank holding company had net income
in the year-ago fourth quarter of $767,000, or 36 cents a
share. For the 1989 full year, United National earned $4.2
million, or $1.92 a share, adjusted for a stock dividend paid
in November 1989. An official of the company said he couldn't
yet estimate the size of the fourth-quarter loss.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The official said the $2.2 million addition to loss
reserves would bring the total provision for possible loan
losses to $2.7 million at year end. United National is the
parent of Plainfield, N.J.-based United National Bank. The
bank has 18 offices in central New Jersey.</p>
<p>The bank holding company said the addition would
accommodate write-offs of $1.5 million in nonperforming loans
and would help provide for future loan losses.</p>
