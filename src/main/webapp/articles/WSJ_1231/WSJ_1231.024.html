	<p class="article-leader">DALLAS -- The Justice Department said that Jerry W.
Peeples, the former president of the defunct Sunbelt Savings
Association of Texas, agreed to plead guilty to a charge of
causing a false statement to be made to the Federal Election
Commission.
   In a one-count criminal information filed in federal court
here, the government alleged that in July 1985 Mr. Peeples
caused the treasurer of the East Texas First Political Action
Committee to report a $1,000 contribution as being
voluntarily made by an individual. In fact, the information
charges, the money came from Sunbelt. Mr. Peeples faces a
maximum penalty of five years imprisonment and a $250,000
fine. Neither Mr. Peeples nor his attorney could be reached
for comment.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>But the plea agreement filed with the court Friday
stipulates that Mr. Peeples, who has been working recently as
an accountant in Dallas, won't face charges relating to his
actions at Sunbelt as long as he fulfills the terms of the
agreement.</p>
<p>Just last week, Edwin T. McBirney III agreed to plead
guilty to bank fraud and three other federal criminal charges
stemming from his role at Sunbelt, one of the more
spectacular Texas thrift collapses. Mr. McBirney's
cooperation was much prized by prosecutors because of his
extensive dealings with other thrifts and their executives
during the four years that he was chairman and chief
executive officer of Sunbelt Savings.</p>
<p>In that time, Sunbelt made 145 loans totaling $523.3
million to directors, officers and shareholders of other
thrifts, according to thrift regulators, who tallied
Sunbelt's total losses at more than $2 billion. The thrift
was declared insolvent and merged in August 1988 with seven
other Texas thrifts into a new entity, Sunbelt Savings FSB.</p>
<p>In a separate Texas thrift case, a federal court jury in
Dallas on Friday acquitted Bob R. Franks, a former director
of the defunct Metroplex Federal Savings Association, and his
onetime lawyer, Earl Rutledge of Hurst.</p>
<p>The two men had been indicted in May on charges related to
the misuse of loan proceeds from Metroplex and charges that
they attempted to hamper the grand jury investigation of the
loan.</p>
