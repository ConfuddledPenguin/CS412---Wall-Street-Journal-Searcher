	<p class="article-leader">Wheeling-Pittsburgh Steel Corp. said it would take a
one-time, $170 million charge to earnings for the fourth
quarter. The Wheeling, W. Va., steel company, which has been
in Chapter 11 bankruptcy law proceedings for a number of
years, earned $29.5 million in the year-ago fourth quarter.
   The one-time charge includes $74 million to establish a
fund for post-employment medical insurance benefits granted
in a labor contract the company signed earlier this month.
The charge also includes $96 million to adjust prior
estimates of the present value of post-employment medical and
life insurance benefits.</p>
