	<p class="article-leader">Many investors are forever seeking the market equivalent
of the Holy Grail.
   They yearn to discover a pattern that would allow them to
pick winning stocks ever after. They long for a technique
that would require little or no thinking, yet have a high
probability of success.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Three patterns that keep cropping up in Wall Street banter
around this time of year are the January effect, the Super
Bowl effect and the midterm-election-year effect. All three
are discussed below. But first, a cautionary word about
patterns in general.</p>
<p>Burton Malkiel, professor of economics at Princeton
University, has long asserted that prices of investments tend
to move in a random way -- that an investment's price today
is not related to yesterday's price. Such price action is
frequently described as a "random walk."</p>
<p>Professor Malkiel freely concedes that people can look at
historical data and find lots of patterns that work on paper.
But trying to profit from such information is difficult.</p>
<p>"Suppose you find something that appears to produce
profits," Mr. Malkiel says. "If there is really something
there, then investors won't wait for the starting date for
the strategy." And this tendency for investors to `jump the
gun' will, over time, cause the effect to disappear, says Mr.
Malkiel.</p>
<p>Mr. Malkiel concedes that some recent research has shown
persistent exceptions to the random-walk model. He argues,
however, that such effects are difficult, if not impossible,
to profit from, because of transaction costs. These costs --
commissions and the prices investors must pay to buy and
sell, the so-called bid-ask spread -- are frequently larger
than the effects themselves.</p>
<p>That said, let's zero in on some Wall Street buzzwords.</p>
<p>Midterm elections. In years past, the stock market's
behavior has correlated fairly strongly with the presidential
election cycle. The year after midterm congressional
elections -- the third year of a president's term -- has
tended to be a good year for the market.</p>
<p>"Since 1962, stock prices have registered a major bottom
in every (midterm) election year without exception," wrote
Robert J. Brinker in the Nov. 4 issue of his newsletter, Bob
Brinker's Marketimer. Larry Vaden, an individual investor and
longtime student of the stock market in Trenton, Texas, says
he is planning to invest more aggressively because the
midterm election indicator gives him confidence.</p>
<p>Indeed, the Dow Jones industrials have risen in 17 of the
past 20 calendar years following the midterm election year.
(The data run from 1911 through 1987.) The average gain for
all 20 such years was 12.2%.</p>
<p>The industrial average was up an average 17.8% in the 17
profitable years, and was down an average 19.6% in the three
losing years. A buy-once-and-hold strategy over the same 77
years would have produced an average 4.2% compounded return,
disregarding dividends.</p>
<p>"Presidents have awesome power to sweep dirt under rugs,"
says Yale Hirsch, editor of the Stock Trader's Almanac. "That
is why most bear markets take place in the first two years of
a presidential term."</p>
<p>"In the first couple of years of a president's term he has
to do nasty things to the economy," says Alfred Goldman,
director of market analysis at A.G. Edwards & Son Inc. in St.
Louis. "But in the next two years, he is going to do
everything in his power to get re-elected or keep his party
in power."</p>
<p>That, anyway, is the rationale -- but Mr. Goldman doesn't
think it provides any investment guarantees. "I wish life
were that easy," he says.</p>
<p>In fact, in the current case, the Bush administration
escaped a recession early in the term, but seems to be stuck
with one now. Given that the economy isn't following the
traditional election-cycle pattern, there's certainly no
guarantee that the stock market will.</p>
<p>The January effect is the pattern that receives the most
attention, especially around this time of the year.</p>
<p>According to market lore, stocks -- especially those
companies with smaller total market values -- tend to rally
in January. (In recent years, the rally has often started in
December.)</p>
<p>For the years 1980 through 1990, the industrial average
rose in seven Januarys out of 11. Smaller stocks, as
represented by the Nasdaq Composite Index, outperformed the
Dow industrials in five of the seven "up" Januarys.</p>
<p>On the other hand, there were four Januarys (1981, 1982,
1984 and 1990) in which the Dow industrials declined. In each
of those four cases, small stocks declined further.</p>
<p>Still, string the 11 Januarys together and the effect
looks pretty good. The industrials rose about 27%, and the
Nasdaq Composite rose about 38%.</p>
<p>There are a couple of possible explanations for the
effect. Portfolio managers may start a new year in a mood to
take some chances. As the year progresses, they may become
more cautious -- either to protect their gains or to avoid
looking truly foolish.</p>
<p>Tax factors are another often-cited explanation. People
who have paper losses on stocks often sell late in the year,
so they can use the losses to offset gains that would
otherwise be taxable. Stocks depressed by such tax-loss
selling may rebound smartly in the new year.</p>
<p>This year the small-stock rally was dubbed by some the
"Thanksgiving effect" as it started early -- perhaps because
of the "gun-jumping" described by Mr. Malkiel, perhaps
because of a little-noticed aspect of the 1986 tax law that
prodded mutual funds to sell many losing stocks before Oct.
31.</p>
<p>Money managers holding losses on small-cap stocks
apparently wanted to reap those losses to offset any gains on
other stocks in their portfolios. They knew that shareholders
wouldn't take kindly to having to pay capital gains taxes in
a year that, on the whole, was bad for stocks. But having
sold small stocks early, they also replenished their holdings
of such stocks early.</p>
<p>The Nasdaq Composite Index rose 12.9% from Oct. 31 through
last Wednesday. Over the same period, the industrial average
was up 8%.</p>
<p>For investors, the nagging question this time is: How much
January effect is left to happen in January?</p>
<p>Super Bowl Indicator: Few market forecasting techniques
appear to have less economic justification than this curio,
which depends on the outcome of the Super Bowl. Yet some
investors, no doubt, will be glued to their TV sets on Sunday
night Jan. 27 not because they have $100 riding on their
favorite team but to tell them whether they should continue
to hold stocks.</p>
<p>Football used to have two separate leagues, the National
Football League and the American Football League. The Super
Bowl indicator says that if a team from the old National
League wins, the market will rise.</p>
<p>Most old National League teams now are part of the
National Football Conference. Three -- the Pittsburgh
Steelers, the Cleveland Browns and the Indianapolis (formerly
Baltimore) Colts -- now are American Football Conference
teams. So bullish believers in the indicator usually root for
the NFC over the AFC, but not always.</p>
<p>Until 1984, the Super Bowl predictor had an unblemished
record of 17 correct market calls. But in the past seven
years it has been right only four times. This year, for
example, the NFC's San Francisco 49ers won, but the New York
Stock Exchange Composite is down about 7%.</p>
