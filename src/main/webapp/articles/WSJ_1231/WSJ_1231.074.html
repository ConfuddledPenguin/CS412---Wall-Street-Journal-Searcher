officer.
   The company, which makes and markets software systems for
the pension and life-insurance industries, said revenue in
the fourth quarter ended Nov. 30 rose 22% to about $4.5
million from $3.7 million.</p>

revenue and earnings to continue through 1991.</p>

20% from 9% a year earlier. He said selling, general and
