	<p class="article-leader">AmeriFirst Bank, already struggling to avoid seizure by
federal thrift regulators, reported a fourth-quarter loss of
$129.9 million that wipes out its remaining equity.
   The loss, which includes $86.7 million in loan-loss
provisions, amounts to $11.76 a share. A year ago, the thrift
posted a fourth-quarter loss of $49.1 million, or $4.44 a
share.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>AmeriFirst didn't specify the size of its total reserves
for bad loans. But it said it increased the reserves after
the Office of Thrift Supervision and auditors KPMG Peat
Marwick reviewed its assets.</p>
<p>An AmeriFirst spokeswoman said the bank, which has been
operating under strict supervision by the Office of Thrift
Supervision since August, has proposed a plan to meet capital
standards through an infusion of private capital by a group
including former Chairman M. Lee Pearce.</p>
<p>But the Miami bank now has a negative net worth of $81
million, and Sally McIver, an analyst with SNL Securities in
Charlottesville, Va., said that makes it a strong candidate
to be seized by regulators.</p>
