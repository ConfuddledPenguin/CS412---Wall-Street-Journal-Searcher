	<p class="article-leader">Heritage Communications Inc. of Des Moines, Iowa, and its
parent, Tele-Communications Inc. of Denver, said they will
consolidate their cable television operations in the 1991
first quarter.
   The consolidation, which will result in the loss of an
unspecified number of jobs at Heritage headquarters, is
taking place earlier than initially planned. When
Tele-Communications acquired Heritage in 1987, the companies
said they would manage their cable operations independently
for a five-year transition period. But in announcing the
consolidation, officials said planning had proceeded more
rapidly than expected.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>J.C. Sparkman, executive vice president and chief
operating officer at Tele-Communications, said he hopes
virtually all Heritage employees will remain with
Tele-Communications after the consolidation. He also said the
company will continue using the Heritage name. Heritage has
about 1,800 employees nationally, 90 of them in the Iowa
headquarters.</p>
