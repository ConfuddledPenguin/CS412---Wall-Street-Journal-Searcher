	<p class="article-leader">The Federal Communications Commission cleared four new
companies to provide air-to-ground telephone service, setting
the stage for the first-ever competition in the fledgling
industry.
   GTE Corp.'s Airfone Inc. unit, currently the only company
providing aircraft telephone service, will now face potential
challenges from four companies the FCC has allowed to enter
the field: In-Flight Phone Corp., Clairtel Communications
Group L.P., Mobile Telecommunications Technologies Corp., and
American Skycell Corp.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Airfone's immediate competition promises to come from
In-Flight, which has already spent $8 million developing
state-ofthe-art services that it says will include enhanced
reception, fax machine capabilities and video games.</p>
<p>In-Flight's entrance into the airplane phone service
business will pit communications entrepreneur John Goeken
against his one-time employer.</p>
<p>Mr. Goeken founded Airfone in 1984, but two years later
sold his brainchild to GTE. Complaining that the
communications giant was usurping his authority, Mr. Goeken
left Airfone early in 1989. Since then, he has been locked in
a legal battle with GTE, in part over his attempts to set up
a rival airplane phone service.</p>
<p>In August of this year, an Illinois court ruled that Mr.
Goeken was bound by a noncompete agreement he had signed with
GTE; since then, Mr. Goeken's daughter, Sandra Goeken, has
officially headed In-Flight and his wife has assumed
ownership of his majority of the company's stock.</p>
<p>Individuals close to the company said Friday that a court
settlement is expected "in very short order," that will allow
Mr. Goeken to resume his post as In-Flight's chairman and
chief executive officer.</p>
<p>An Airfone spokesman said he has "no knowledge" of an
agreement that would free Mr. Goeken to compete.</p>
<p>For the 60-year-old Mr. Goeken, who is best-known for
founding MCI Communications Corp. in the 1960s, the FCC
license and his reinstatement as chairman would offer him the
opportunity to once again break new ground in the
communications industry. Closely held In-Flight, of Oak
Brook, Ill., plans to swiftly implement a digital aircraft
telephone transmission system, which it contends is superior
to the analog system Airfone uses.</p>
<p>"We took the chance that the FCC would approve this and we
went ahead and spent $8 million to develop the system," Mr.
Goeken said in an interview.</p>
<p>In-Flight said it plans to have a limited number of phones
installed in aircraft owned by American Airlines, Northwest
Airlines, and USAir within about four months. "We'll expand
from there as the airlines want," a spokesman said.</p>
<p>Clairtel, formed through a limited partnership with McCaw
Cellular Communications Inc. and Hughes Network Systems, will
initially install systems similar to Airfone's, but also
plans eventually to introduce advanced technology. The other
newly licensed companies, which entered after Mr. Goeken
petitioned the FCC to open the field to competition, aren't
as far along.</p>
<p>The FCC's approval of permanent licenses for the four new
companies comes on the heels of an FCC ruling this year that
formally established aircraft telephones as a regular
communications service, and thus opened up the frequency
spectrum to competitors.</p>
<p>The development ended what has been a monopoly for
Airfone, which continues to operate under an experimental FCC
license, granted in 1984, when it began installing phones in
aircraft.</p>
<p>An Airfone spokesman said the company expects to receive
permanent licensing following further FCC analysis. "It is
much more difficult to grant our license than that of a new
company," the spokesman said.</p>
<p>Airfone currently has phones installed and operating in
more than 1,400 planes -- about one-third of the U.S.
domestic fleet.</p>
