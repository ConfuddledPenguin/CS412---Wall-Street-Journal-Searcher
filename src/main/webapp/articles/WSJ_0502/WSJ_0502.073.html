	<p class="article-leader">Tens of thousands of Soviet radicals jeered President
Mikhail Gorbachev and the rest of the Soviet leadership
Tuesday, turning the May Day parade through Red Square into a
ringing denunciation of 72 years of Communist rule.
   ---</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>So began a Reuters dispatch describing the extraordinary
scene that unfolded in Red Square yesterday. An estimated
100,000 Soviet citizens entered the square behind the
official, pro-government marchers and began shouting,
"Freedom] Freedom]" and "Politburo, Resign]" and "Down with
the KGB]" "A president from the people]" the crowd yelled,
while Mikhail Gorbachev and the Politburo on the dais stared
down.</p>
<p>Just to describe the banners and flags carried by the
crowd provides Western readers an unusual sense of the
discontent building in the Soviet Union: "Down with the
empire of Red fascism," said another. "Down with the Cult of
Lenin." "Socialism, no thanks." "A Dictator is a President
Without an Election."</p>
<p>The red, yellow and green flag of the Lithuanian republic
was prominent in the procession. "The Lithuanian Blockade is
the President's Shame," read one sign. Another, "Today a
blockade of Lithuania, tomorrow a blockade of Moscow."</p>
<p>Other marchers carried the red, white and blue colors of
pre-revolutionary Russia. Some carried flags of non-Soviet
Ukraine. Some even carried Soviet flags with the
hammer-and-sickle cut out, precisely the device used by the
Romanians who took to the streets in bloody battles with the
Securitate forces, while the Ceaucescus fell.</p>
<p>After about 20 minutes of this, enough became enough and
the leadership atop the Lenin Mausoleum disappeared for the
peace and quiet of the dachas.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>Events are moving rapidly in the U.S. as well. Yesterday
the White House announced that on Thursday President Bush
would meet at the White House with Lithuanian Prime Minister
Kazimiera Prunskiene. Only a week ago, Ms. Prunskiene was
saying that State Department officials had refused her a
visa, hinting that she try to come in June, after the
Bush-Gorbachev summit in late May. Now she will spend all day
Thursday pleading her case to the President and Members of
Congress.</p>
<p>A positive reading of these developments would be that the
political leadership in both East and West is at last
beginning to see the dangers in failing to recognize the
legitimate interests of all those who have a stake in the
evolution from totalitarianism to self-determination. In
particular, they may be starting to appreciate that the issue
reaches far beyond "ethnic unrest" in the Balkans or Baltic
Republic. Lithuanian nationalists and Russian democrats
understand that their cause is one.</p>
<p>In a poll published by Izvestia Monday, 92% of Latvian
ethnics favored secession from the Soviet Union, but so did
45% of Latvian residents of other ethnic extractions,
primarily Russians. Thousands of miles from Red Square
yesterday, demonstrators in Ulan Bator, Mongolia, were
marching to support hunger strikers demanding press freedom
and a faster evolution to full democracy. As the Red Square
demonstrations suggest, many Soviets now hate the very word
"communism.'</p>
<p>It is no doubt likely that there are large elements in the
general population, or in the army and government, who oppose
tossing over the current system. Absent any mechanism such as
a popularly elected government for absorbing these emotions,
the Soviet Union is ripe for civil war. This is an unsettling
prospect for a nation possessed of vast firepower, including
nuclear weapons. Surely avoiding such a cataclysmic and
probably uncontrollable event is in the interest of everyone,
both the Soviets and the West. But what policy does that
imperative demand?</p>
<p>Ceaucescu was singularly efficient at suppressing his
ethnic minorities (ask any Hungarian), and at keeping the
rest of his population in terror; his reward was the only
civil war and the only execution in the Eastern European
upheavals. Civil war is most likely to be averted not by
suppression but by accommodation of the Lithuanians, the
Azerbaijanis and the Great Russians in Red Square. They all,
ultimately, have legitimate grievances and legitimate
desires.</p>
<p>As we argued yesterday, the United States ought to support
a set of Soviet policies that ensures real reform rather than
ties it to one man. Mr. Gorbachev's policy was accommodation
in Eastern Europe, but has turned to suppression elsewhere,
including the blockade of Lithuania and the use of poison gas
and troops in Georgia and deliberately stirring ethnic
animosities in Azerbaijan.</p>
<p>In Russia, his "reforms" have systematically destroyed
other power structures, including the party, to gather all
power into his personal hands. Andrei Sakharov, in his last
warnings before his death, warned about the dangers of
seeking "democratic change through undemocratic means."</p>
<p>The most hopeful interpretation of yesterday`s Red Square
events is that Mr. Gorbachev permitted the demonstrations as
a tactic to get back on the path of accommodation and reform.
The test will lie in his treatment of the Lithuanians. But
the West stands warned that Mr. Gorbachev is a variable
partner. The West should support him when he favors reform,
but this does not mean looking the other way when he turns to
repression.</p>
