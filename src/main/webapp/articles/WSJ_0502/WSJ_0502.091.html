	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- The Air Transport Association, a U.S.
airline-industry group, announced it will pay as much as $1
million for information that helps authorities thwart
terrorism directed at airlines.
   The $1 million bounty will be used to supplement the State
Department's offer of as much as $2 million for such
information in cases of airline terrorism overseas. Unlike
the State Department's program, the ATA's offer will apply to
information related to domestic cases as well.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"It was the unanimous judgment that the combined reward of
$3 million . . . is a meaningful amount in terms of providing
a deterrent, a disincentive or an encouragement to someone to
come forward with the information," said Robert Aaronson,
ATA's president. Twenty-three airlines will contribute money
to the reward pool.</p>
<p>William Baker, assistant director of the
criminal-investigation division of the Federal Bureau of
Investigation, said nearly 800 people have been murdered by
terrorist bombs on airlines.</p>
