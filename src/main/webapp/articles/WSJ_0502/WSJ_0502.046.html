	<p class="article-leader">PITTSBURGH -- Win or lose in his proxy battle against USX
Corp., New York investor Carl Icahn is succeeding in forcing
management to consider some bold initiatives.
   Early indications are that Mr. Icahn won't get a majority
of shareholders to back his proposal to divide USX into
separate steel and energy businesses. Major institutional
investors, even those voting with Mr. Icahn, doubt he will
win, and the company said it "feels good" about the response
it is getting.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Still not all votes have been cast. And a source close to
Mr. Icahn says the investor has 70 million votes, including
his own 34 million, and needs only an estimated one out of
four votes outstanding for a simple majority. Both sides are
spending this last week before Monday's annual shareholder
meeting courting hesitant shareholders and institutional
investors through personal meetings and an advertising blitz.</p>
<p>But regardless of the outcome, Mr. Icahn has put USX on
the defensive. Executives expect to explore a number of
restructuring measures of their own. Some possibilities: more
joint ventures in the steel business or the possible sale of
part of U.S. Steel in a public stock offering.</p>
<p>USX management has over the years studied extreme
alternatives to reshape its steel business, including merging
with Bethlehem Steel Corp., the nation's second largest
steelmaker. And USX Chairman Charles A. Corry said he would
consider selling all or part of it when the time is right.</p>
<p>"There will be additional restructuring I'm sure, and a
lot will take place on the steel side," says W. Bruce Thomas,
USX's vice chairman-administration and chief financial
officer. One possibility, he indicated, is selling 20% of the
steel business in an initial public offering. He noted that
the company considered such a move in 1988, holding
discussions with investment bankers, but couldn't get
underwriting of an offering at an acceptable price.</p>
<p>"The time will come again, I hope in the next year or two,
where steel equity would be attractive to the point where it
might make sense to do something like that," he adds.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Mr. Thomas expects USX will be involved in
finding more joint venture partners to buy half of existing
steel plants or invest in new operations.</p>
<p>Mr. Icahn, who holds a 13.3% stake in USX, will be
watching eagerly. "I don't intend to sell a share until it
achieves the value I think it deserves," says Mr. Icahn, who
declined to identify a proper selling price.</p>
<p>Mr. Icahn wants to split USX into steel and oil operations
by spinning off at least 80% of the steel business as a
dividend to shareholders. Doing so, he contends, would boost
the value of USX stock to $48 a share, with Marathon Oil
valued at $39 a share and U.S. Steel at $9 a share. In
composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange, USX closed
at $33.125, up 37.5 cents. Shareholders will vote on the
proposal at the company's annual meeting, but an official
tally of the vote won't be known until several days later.</p>
<p>Given Mr. Icahn's experience in waging proxy fights, he
could come up with more ammunition in a last-ditch effort to
rally support. Late last week he said he would be willing to
buy $800 million of USX stock at $48 a share if his proposal
passes.</p>
<p>That failed to sway some institutional investors, who
credit USX management with closing outdated steel plants and
shedding lackluster operations to reduce debt and buy back
shares. They also doubt Mr. Icahn's $48-a-share estimate.</p>
<p>"With the pension liabilities, retiree medical costs and
the recent low spot price of steel, I think a lot of
institutional investors don't buy the $48 a share and are
sticking by management," says one portfolio manager who
handles USX for a large fund.</p>
<p>Other institutional investors have been scared off by
fears that the proposed spinoff might not be tax-free,
leaving them with huge taxes on their non-cash dividend.</p>
<p>Those favoring Mr. Icahn don't expect a victory, even
though the proposal isn't binding. Dissident shareholders who
don't back up their challenge with a cash or stock offer find
proxy fights difficult to win. Moreover, some institutional
holders, especially more conservative bank trusts and
traditional money managers, typically vote with management,
as do individual shareholders interested in long-term
investments.</p>
<p>"We don't believe he'll get the majority," says one
supporter, Richard Hirtle, treasurer of the North American
Security Trust, a Boston-based family of mutual funds. Still,
the funds are voting with Mr. Icahn, hoping to prod
management into further restructuring of steel operations.</p>
<p>He and others note that spinoffs historically have been
successful. Moreover, Icahn backers agree that USX shouldn't
allow oil profits to support more cyclical steel operations.</p>
<p>"This has allowed management to operate in a way that is
less sensitive to market forces," contends Lilli Gordon,
managing director of Institutional Voting Research Service.
Even if Mr. Icahn's proposal fails, she suggests that U.S.
Steel be required to generate its own capital through equity
or debt.</p>
<p>Should Mr. Icahn fail to get the needed majority, he will
succeed in strengthening his bargaining position. "The more
votes I get the more leverage I will have in dealing with
management," says Mr. Icahn.</p>
<p>That is precisely what some institutional holders want.</p>
<p>Martin D. Sass, president of M.D. Sass Investors Services,
which holds 950,000 shares of USX stock, says his vote in
favor of Mr. Icahn was intended to send management a clear
message. "I think they have a mandate to move in a fairly
bold fashion, to further enhance shareholder value." That, he
says, could include stock buy-backs, an increased dividend
and more aggressive sale of assets.</p>
<p>And while he's not sure Mr. Icahn's steel spinoff proposal
makes sense right now, given steel's current down cycle, he
thinks at some point USX will split energy and steel into two
companies.</p>
<p>Though USX's steel business is in infinitely better shape
than it was a decade ago, Mr. Icahn still believes it acts as
a "poison pill," dragging down the overall stock price. "If
it were spun off I believe there would be bids for Marathon
alone that would not come forth if steel is part of the
picture," he says.</p>
<p>USX's Mr. Thomas agrees that the stock is undervalued, but
only in that it doesn't adequately reflect the restructuring
done to date, including the $500 million stock buy-back, and
improved earnings performance. "I don't think those
improvements have been fully reflected in the stock price,"
he says.</p>
<p>Mr. Thomas says that Mr. Icahn's proxy has forced
management to justify its policy to shareholders. But he
credits Mr. Icahn for being a loyal and consistent
shareholder. "He's shown a great deal of patience, I think,"
he says.</p>
