	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- The Food and Drug Administration approved
the use of irradiation to control salmonella and other
bacteria in poultry believed partly to blame for rising rates
of food-borne illness.
   FDA scientists described irradiation as a safe and
effective process for, in effect, pasteurizing solid foods.
As in the heat-pasteurization of milk, they said, zapping
poultry with X-rays, gamma radiation or electron radiation
greatly reduces, but doesn't eliminate, all bacteria. Thus,
although irradiated poultry would be safe longer than
untreated poultry, it would still require refrigeration, just
as pasteurized milk does.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Despite FDA assurances that irradiation doesn't make food
radioactive or expose consumers to radiation, the poultry
industry expects consumer resistance to be a problem.</p>
<p>"It would be fair to say at this time that you won't see
companies jumping to take advantage of this technology, not
unless they feel the consumer will buy the product," said
Stephen Pretanik, science director for the National Broiler
Council, a trade group for major chicken processors. "There's
an element out there that is going to fight this."</p>
<p>Mr. Pretanik said that a consumer-education effort by
government and industry is needed to overcome "a lot of
misunderstanding and misinformation" about irradiation. Roger
Coleman, spokesman for the National Food Processors
Association, added, "The issue is consumer acceptance."</p>
<p>FDA approval had been sought by the Agriculture
Department, which is responsible for inspecting meat and
poultry products, and by RTI Inc., a Rockaway, N.J., company
engaged in food irradiation. "This will allow industry a
chance to use this new technology if it chooses to," said
James Greene, a department spokesman.</p>
<p>The department is particularly concerned about such
food-borne pathogens as salmonella and campylobacter, major
causes of illnesses. Poultry accounted for almost 10% of the
illnesses in U.S. outbreaks that were traced to a food source
between 1973 and 1987. FDA scientists estimate that almost
every American becomes sick from eating tainted food once
every year or so. The illnesses range from a stomachache to
an incapacitating, and sometimes fatal, attack.</p>
<p>The FDA already has authorized limited uses of irradiation
to inhibit sprouting in potatoes, retard spoilage in produce,
and control insects in herbs, spices, grains and other foods.</p>
<p>The latest approval was based in part on studies in which
lab animals were put on diets containing irradiated poultry.
Irradiation at the relatively low levels approved reduces the
number of pathogenic and spoilage bacteria but doesn't
sterilize the poultry, FDA officials said. As a result,
poultry products would continue to require proper handling
and refrigeration by retailers and consumers to prevent
surviving organisms from multiplying.</p>
