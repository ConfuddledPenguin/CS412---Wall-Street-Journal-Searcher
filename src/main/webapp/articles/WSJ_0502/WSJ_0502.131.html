	<p class="article-leader">A federal court in Cheyenne, Wyo., ordered two units of
Occidental Petroleum Corp., Los Angeles, to pay $28 million
to Colorado Interstate Gas Co. for wrongful interference in a
contractual relationship between Colorado Interstate and a
gas supplier.
   The judgment was recently disclosed by Occidental in a
regulatory filing. Occidental also said it has appealed the
judgment to the 10th Circuit Court in Denver.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The litigation began in 1984 when Colorado Interstate, a
unit of Houston-based Coastal Corp., sued Natural Gas
Pipeline Co. of America and NGPL-Trailblazer Inc. for alleged
antitrust violations, breach of contract and wrongful
interference.</p>
<p>Last September, the 10th Circuit Court overturned a lower
court ruling that ordered the Occidental units to pay $412
million to Colorado Interstate on the antitrust and
breach-of-contract charges. But the circuit court upheld
Colorado Interstate's wrongful interference claim. The two
sides disputed the amount of the claim.</p>
<p>The Wyoming ruling affirmed Colorado Interstate's claim
that the judgment was for $28 million, including interest.
Occidental maintained that the amount should be only $8
million. Separately, a Coastal spokesman said Colorado
Interstate petitioned the U.S. Supreme Court last week to
review the circuit court's ruling on the antitrust and breach
of contract allegations.</p>
