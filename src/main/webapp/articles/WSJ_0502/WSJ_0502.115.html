industrial buildings in San Diego for about $15.7 million.
   CalMat has been selling real-estate assets since 1988 as
part of a restructuring effort. The company has been focusing
on its asphalt, concrete and cement business and using some
of the proceeds from the real-estate sales to buy back stock.</p>
