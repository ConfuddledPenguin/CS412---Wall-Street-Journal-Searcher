	<p class="article-leader">Melodramas have their place even in law, but so far the
atmospherics have obscured the Michael Milken tragedy. The
shadows will some day recede. Do not be surprised if the
Greek chorus then moans a deeper loss than the personal
anguish of Mr. Milken. A legal system that could declare
itself satisfied with last week's plea bargain is a system
headed for a fall.
   Proportionality and fairness crumpled to give way to the
prosecution of Mr. Milken: The prosecutorial tactics were a
cannon to the flea of the six eventual pleas by Mr. Milken.
His plea has little to do with the original indictment's
allegations. The liquidation of Drexel Burnham Lambert and
Mr. Milken's $600 million fine completely dwarf the harm done
to clients and investors, which likely comes to less than $1
million. Without minimizing his offenses, the Justice
Department and Securities and Exchange Commission have some
explaining to do.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Mr. Milken has settled for some jail time and a possibly
partly tax-deductible fine. What remains unclear is how great
a criminal we should view Mr. Milken or how proud we should
be of our legal system for winning this plea bargain.</p>
<p>Let's first understand what Mr. Milken did not admit. The
indictment was 98 charges of racketeering, insider trading
and a manipulation scam underlying the junk-bond and takeover
markets.</p>
<p>No one seems to have noticed that Mr. Milken did not admit
to any of the charges as originally described in the
indictment. Instead, prosecutors indicted first, asked
questions later. As Justice Robert Jackson warns nearby, few
things are as dangerous as a prosecutor who finds a target,
then looks for crimes to pin on him.</p>
<p>It was no surprise that Mr. Milken did not admit to any
RICO counts -- these were included solely as rubber hoses to
bludgeon a plea. But Mr. Milken also did not admit to any
insider trading. In other words, those who consider him a
common crook must also think he is an idiot. At the peak of
the takeover battles, Mr. Milken had huge amounts of inside
information, probably more inside information than everyone
else in the market combined. Prosecutors apparently didn't
find a single case of misusing this information.</p>
<p>Most important, this means Mr. Milken is no Ivan Boesky, a
real crook who made easy money by trading suitcases of cash
for stolen inside information. So why did prosecutors agree
to give Mr. Boesky a reduced sentence for fingering Mr.
Milken? Maybe they assumed there was more to the Milken case
than exists. After all, former prosecutor Rudolph Giuliani
also leaped to wrong conclusions in the aborted
insider-trading indictment of investment bankers Robert
Freeman, Richard Wigton and Timothy Tabor.</p>
<p>Of the six crimes to which Mr. Milken pleaded, only three
were in the indictment in even a distorted form. The
Fischbach takeover, for example, is better viewed as Mr.
Boesky leaning on Mr. Milken for a favor than the other way
around. The indictment didn't mention the one crime where Mr.
Milken harmed clients. This was a commission-shaving scheme
that cost clients several hundred thousand dollars -- though
legally if only disclosed.</p>
<p>His lawyers noted that most of Mr. Milken's crimes were
accommodating the more serious offenses of others. Mr. Milken
said he knew at the time that his acts were wrong, but didn't
say he knew that they were crimes. Until recent years no one
could have imagined that victimless offenses such as aiding
and abetting someone else in filing a false net capital Form
X-17A-5 or an incomplete disclosure 13-D Form would warrant
more than a harsh letter from the SEC or a nominal fine.</p>
<p>If prosecutors were so sure of their case, why the
extraordinary pressure on Mr. Milken to cop a plea? RICO
makes a farce of the entire case. The Justice Department's
own prosecutorial guidelines prohibit such "imaginative
prosecutions" under the anti-mobster law because of RICO's
brutal force.</p>
<p>RICO meant Mr. Milken faced a possible jail sentence of
520 years and a fine of $11 billion. We lack the finality of
a trial partly because the Princeton/Newport trial put Mr.
Milken on notice that vague RICO allegations of fraud are
enough for convictions. Prosecutors made his lawyer brother
an indicted co-racketeer even though he had little to do with
the allegedly illegal transactions. Settling freed the
brother as a RICO hostage.</p>
<p>It's also possible that some prosecutors actually equate
investment banking and racketeering. One lawyer recounts the
chilling response he got when he tried to persuade top
Justice officials that RICO was inappropriate in a securities
case. A Justice official asked, "Isn't putting a company in
play criminal and an act of racketeering?" It explains a lot
if prosecutors think hostile takeovers are crimes.</p>
<p>I also understand that to get the plea prosecutors
threatened new indictments in every state where a savings and
loan bought bonds from Drexel. Trying to smear Mr. Milken
with the thrift mess would have been high irony; until
Congress forced fire sales, junk bonds were among thrifts'
safer investments. Mr. Milken must have wondered what next?
when an FBI agent was dispatched to interrogate his
92-year-old grandfather.</p>
<p>After all this, Attorney General Dick Thornburgh said this
shows the government won't abide "crime in the suites." SEC
Chairman Richard Breeden held a press conference to say that
Mr. Milken's "admissions today demonstrate that he stood at
the center of a network of manipulation, fraud and deceit."</p>
<p>What this case in fact shows is that if prosecutors had
the courage of Mr. Milken's supposed convictions, they should
have dropped the abusive RICO counts and gone to court. Now
prosecutors will use their sentencing memorandum to the judge
to retry the case without risk of rebuttal.</p>
<p>Mr. Milken's great accomplishments do not excuse cutting
legal corners, but justice requires viewing Mr. Milken by all
that he did with his financial genius. His hubris was that
getting the deals done came to be more important than
remembering that even in the most advanced societies
renegades get no margin for error. In the end, prosecutorial
abuses yield the best perspective on the Milken plea.</p>
