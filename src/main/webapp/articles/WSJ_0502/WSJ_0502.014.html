	<h3>Politics & Policy: Federal Budget Pinch May Cut Amount of `Pork' To Colleges Living Off of the Fat of the Land</h3>

	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- What a year for the Runnin' Rebels.
   Not only did the University of Nevada at Las Vegas take
the national basketball championship, it won the Pork Bowl
too. UNLV received $13 million in federal funds because of
its political connections this year, edging out Louisiana
State University for the top spot among colleges and
universities.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"We're delighted," says John Unrue, UNLV's provost, who
objects to the term "pork" but likes what federal dollars buy
-- a new supercomputer and an environmental research
laboratory.</p>
<p>Academic pork fattens up about 100 institutions of higher
learning, which have collected at least $1.2 billion in
special congressional allocations for buildings and research
over the past decade. But the trough isn't as full these
days, largely because of the federal budget crunch and the
determined opposition of such lawmakers as Georgia Democrat
Sam Nunn, who heads the Senate Armed Services Committee.</p>
<p>Pork-minded colleges depend on the largess of the
congressional appropriations committees, prodded by
influential lawmakers, to earmark funds for special academic
projects. In the current fiscal year, Congress earmarked
$132.4 million for such projects -- down 35% from the year
before, according to James Savage, a University of Virginia
government professor who tracks academic pork. He predicts it
will drop below $100 million in the coming fiscal year.
"There's a backlash against earmarking," he says.</p>
<p>One sign of the backlash is the fall-off in funds for
projects backed by Cassidy & Associates Inc., a big
university lobbying firm that was attacked by Appropriations
Committee Chairman Robert Byrd (D., W.Va.). Cassidy's college
clients reaped only $14.8 million in pork-barrel allocations
this year -- down from $82.9 million the year before, based
on Mr. Savage's figures. (A Cassidy spokesman says that in
the current fiscal year, the firm's clients received $55
million in university and hospital projects, but he didn't
provide a figure just for universities, or comparable figures
for the year before.)</p>
<p>If the budget squeeze finally eases, however, pork will
probably start sizzling again. The appetite certainly is
gluttonous. The House Appropriations Committee's agriculture
panel is reviewing two dozen requests to set up international
trade centers at institutions of higher learning. The
committee's energy and water panel, long the biggest pork
purveyor in Congress, has about 20 requests for university
projects, worth about $200 million.</p>
<p>"I hope to get back to accommodating the colleges," says
Rep. Tom Bevill, the Alabama Democrat who heads the energy
and water subcommittee.</p>
<p>The Senate Appropriations Committee's top members have
made schools in their states the decade's champion porkers.
West Virginia University, represented by Sen. Byrd and, for
three years by Cassidy, is number one, raking in $67.9
million. Oregon Health Sciences University, through the
efforts of Oregon Sen. Mark Hatfield, the committee's ranking
Republican, is number two with $62.4 million. With all the
new construction at Oregon Health Sciences, the school says
that it is now the fourth largest employer in Portland. "I
make sure that Oregon has the ability to compete," says Sen.
Hatfield.</p>
<p>Pork projects aren't judged by panels of experts, called
peer review, as is traditionally done with research grants to
weed out less-deserving projects. "Where's the quality
control?" with pork projects, asks Erich Bloch, director of
the National Science Foundation. "With peer review, there's
quality control on the research."</p>
<p>But pork-minded lawmakers deride peer review as a scam
designed to keep research funds concentrated at a few dozen
schools. "There's an old-boys' club that has operated for too
long in university research," charges Sen. Hatfield.</p>
<p>Now, with the budget crunch, these lawmakers must search
for new sources of funds. Democratic Sen. Harry Reid of
Nevada mined a proposed nuclear-waste dump, which is to be
established in his state's Yucca Mountain, for $13 million
for Nevada colleges this year, and got them $3 million more
through an environmental money bill. The state fiercely
opposes the dump and has passed a law making it illegal to
store high-level radioactive waste in Nevada, but its
colleges are happy to accept the goodies that come with
overseeing the dump. Sen. Reid won a Cray YMP supercomputer
for UNLV, and $3 million in research grants for the
University of Nevada system and its Reno campus.</p>
<p>He argues that accepting the money doesn't mean accepting
the dump. "All these years they {the federal government} have
been blowing up our desert" at the nuclear-weapons test site
"and we've got nothing for it," Sen. Reid complains. Now "we
got the supercomputer, and we're not going to get the dump."</p>
<p>Some lawmakers' deals have gone sour. Rep. William Natcher
(D., Ky.), one of the rare appropriations subcommittee
chairmen who usually opposes academic pork, first rebuffed a
bid last year by Senate Republican Leader Robert Dole of
Kansas to win $5 million for a new laboratory at the
University of Kansas. So Sen. Dole shopped around until he
found a congressional panel that agreed to authorize the
project, and that was enough to convince Rep. Natcher to try
to fund the deal. His appropriations subcommittee set up a
$15 million construction fund that Mr. Natcher says he
figured would be enough to cover the Kansas lab, a
laboratory-mice breeding facility favored by Senate Majority
Leader George Mitchell (D., Maine), and a cancer center
pushed by Rep. Pat Schroeder (D., Colo.). "I said, `You get
it {the projects} authorized and we'll put the money in and
tell them downtown that they should approve it,'" Rep.
Natcher recalls.</p>
<p>But the folks downtown -- in this case, the National
Institutes of Health -- evidently weren't listening closely
or the lawmaker didn't speak loudly enough. NIH started a
program in which the Kansas and Colorado projects would have
to compete with a dozen other proposals for a total of only
$5 million -- nearly assuring that Sen. Dole won't get the
money he wants. A spokesman for Mr. Dole says the senator
hasn't decided yet whether to push this year for a special
allocation for the laboratory.</p>
<p>Whatever Mr. Dole decides, others surely will push for new
projects. A Cassidy spokesman, for example, says his firm is
still hunting for $15 million for an engineering center at
Lehigh University that was stricken from last year's defense
appropriations bill.</p>
<p>"These are capital-fund drives for universities that don't
want to turn to their alumni," says Sen. John Danforth, a
Missouri Republican who has long opposed pork. "Come to
Washington; it's a horn of plenty."</p>
