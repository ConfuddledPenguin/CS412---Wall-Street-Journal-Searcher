	<p class="article-leader">Led by small-stock specialist Jonathan Steinberg, a
quartet of investment professionals once again trounced a
randomly selected "dart" portfolio in this column's
stock-picking contest.
   Mr. Steinberg, editor and publisher of Individual Investor
magazine and son of raider-financier Saul Steinberg, scored a
9% gain with his April selection, Image Entertainment Inc. It
followed his victorious pick for March, American Film
Technologies Inc., which has risen 58% in the two months
since he picked it at the beginning of March.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>April's brigade of investment pros averaged a 3.7% gain
for the month, while a group of four stocks chosen by tossing
darts at the New York Stock Exchange listings fell 12.7%. The
Dow Jones Industrial Average sagged 1.9%.</p>
<p>The biggest loser among the dart stocks was Caesar's
World, a casino company faced with tough new competition from
Donald Trump's Taj Mahal in Atlantic City and Golden Nugget
Inc.'s Mirage casino in Las Vegas. The investment pros have
now beaten the darts in 14 of 19 monthly outings.</p>
<p>Mr. Steinberg's new pick is Management Co. Entertainment
Group, a Santa Monica, Calif., film producer and distributor
whose most recent film is "Look Who's Talking." Traded over
the counter, the stock ended yesterday at $2.25 a share, bid.
Mr. Steinberg recommends purchasing it at any price up to
$4.50. "I think in 18 months it will be between $7 and $11,"
he says.</p>
<p>Last year, Management Co. Entertainment Group acquired
Virgin Vision Ltd., a British-based international
film-distribution company. Revenue, a mere $34 million in
fiscal 1989, will be $330 million in fiscal 1991, Mr.
Steinberg figures.</p>
<p>"It is extremely undervalued," he says. "Most production
companies trade at one-and-a-half to three times sales. This
company trades at about 60% of sales, and sales are growing
fast. If it trades at one times sales by the end of 1991, the
stock would be at $11."</p>
<p>To finance its growth, the company has taken on about $153
million of debt, Mr. Steinberg notes, including a $72 million
bridge loan from Kidder, Peabody & Co. "There's been downward
pressure on the stock because of the bridge loan," Mr.
Steinberg says. But yesterday, the company and Kidder
announced that the bridge loan will be extended on more
favorable terms.</p>
<p>Returning to the contest this month is R. Jerry Falkner,
director of research for Gulfstream Financial Associates Inc.
(a unit of Prescott, Ball & Turben, which is part of Kemper
Corp.). At the beginning of February, he recommended
Blockbuster Entertainment Corp., then selling for $14.125 a
share. Blockbuster ended April at $19.75, a 40% gain that
earns Mr. Falkner a return trip.</p>
<p>His pick now: Windmere Corp., a Miami-based maker of small
electrical appliances, especially hair-care products. Almost
everything that could go wrong for Windmere has gone wrong in
the past year, Mr. Falkner says. For starters, many of its
factories are in China, the scene of a bloody political
crackdown by the Communist regime against pro-democracy
demonstrators. Windmere also damaged its credibility on Wall
Street by issuing overly optimistic earnings predictions, Mr.
Falkner says.</p>
<p>But now, he thinks the stock is "very oversold," having
plunged to a recent $5.75 a share from a 1989 high of $29; it
closed yesterday at $5.875 in Big Board composite trading.
Mr. Falkner would pay up to $7 a share.</p>
<p>Windmere, which has annual sales of about $180 million,
recently won a $90 million jury award in an antitrust suit
against N.V. Philips, the big Dutch company that Windmere
says forced it out of the market for three-head rotary
shavers. Philips plans to appeal, but Mr. Falkner says, "We
think {Windmere} has a very high probability of receiving
that money."</p>
<p>Even without lawsuit proceeds, Mr. Falkner says, Windmere
shares are selling below their book value (assets minus
liabilities per share) of about $7.50. "We think they lost
some market share last year {though the company denies it},
but we think they're recovering," he concludes.</p>
<p>Two new stock-pickers join the fun this month. Lawrence A.
Cisneros is president of San Juan Asset Management Inc. in
Huntington Beach, Calif. Michael G. Seyfer is president of
Starmont Capital Ltd. in Des Moines, Iowa.</p>
<p>Mr. Cisneros suggests buying shares of Service Corp.
International, based in Houston, which owns a national chain
of some 500 funeral homes and more than 100 cemeteries. The
shares sold yesterday for $16.50 in Big Board composite
trading; Mr. Cisneros would buy them up to $18.50.</p>
<p>Several things attract him to the stock: Service Corp. is
selling off divisions that haven't pulled their weight
(prearranged funerals and funeral supplies). It plans to buy
back shares in June. And its business is "interest-rate
resistant and resistant to economic downturns."</p>
<p>Service Corp. stumbled through hasty and perhaps excessive
expansion, Mr. Cisneros says. But now he thinks "management's
taken the necessary steps to get it back on track," and he's
looking for annual earnings growth of 15% to 20%.</p>
<p>Mr. Seyfer likes Hecla Mining Co., a producer of gold,
silver and industrial minerals based in Coeur D'Alene, Idaho.
Hecla shares closed unchanged yesterday at $11.625 on the Big
Board. Mr. Seyfer says he'd buy at prices up to $12, but
wouldn't chase the stock up.</p>
<p>"I think silver under $5 {an ounce} is really attractive,"
he says. "You have to go back to the late 1970s to see the
price much under that." He thinks it's a good sign that Hecla
"bit the bullet" and took write-offs on some inactive mining
properties last year.</p>
<p>But mostly, he views Hecla as a play on precious-metal
prices. As he sees it, a "more normal price" of $5.50 to $6
an ounce for silver, which "may take a while" to achieve,
would make Hecla's profits perk up. "The price of silver is
reflected in their bottom line very quickly."</p>
<p>For May, the pros will be up against a dartboard portfolio
consisting of Borden Inc., Gillette Co., Leggett & Platt Inc.
and National City Corp.</p>
