	<p class="article-leader">Corporate Connection:
   Flight Facts by Fax</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>THOMAS COOK, the New York-based travel agency, yesterday
unveiled a do-it-yourself booking service for corporate
customers.</p>
<p>With the service, customers call into a computer, which
then asks a series of scheduling and price questions. The
caller responds by pressing the numbers on a push-button
phone. The agency then faxes a list of the available flights
and fare information from all different carriers to the
caller.</p>
<p>The faxed information includes up to seven outbound and
seven return flights, to make 49 schedule combinations,
complete with prices. The traveler can then call back and
book a seat, also by hitting phone buttons.</p>
<p>The service is aimed at business travelers, who often send
their secretaries scrambling to gather various flight
information. The fax also provides data about on-time
performance, flight duration and type of aircraft. Car
rentals can be handled as well.</p>
<p>"It's like the ATM for travel," says David Paresky,
chairman of Thomas Cook, referring to bank teller machines.</p>
<p>There are shortfalls: You must have an account with the
agency and you must have a fax machine at your disposal. The
plan also requires that users learn different number codes.</p>
<p>Other agencies hope customers will want to stick with
flesh and blood agents. "I've got people who change their
minds all the time in the middle of one telephone
conversation," says Kathryn Sudeikis, executive vice
president of Brennco Travel, an agency in Overland Park, Kan.
"How's a computer going to handle that?"</p>
<p>Actually, says Thomas Cook, a push-button code interrupts
the system to let you start over.</p>
<p>States Can't Get a Grip</p>
<p>On Air-Fare Direction</p>
<p>MANY STATES would be angry about rising air fares -- if
they were sure they were rising.</p>
<p>With deregulation, it's become extremely difficult to
monitor ticket prices and balance one market against another,
a fact that's led to tremendous confusion among state
watchdogs.</p>
<p>Last summer, North Dakota sued NWA Inc.'s Northwest
Airlines for $50 million, alleging price gouging, after a
state-commissioned study showed fares had soared at the
state's airports. But state officials dropped the suit two
weeks ago, after a U.S. Transportation Department report
reached the opposite conclusion on prices.</p>
<p>Originally, the state claimed fares from North Dakota
cities to Northwest's Minneapolis headquarters rose
"substantially" between 1986 and 1988. For example, it
charged that fares from Fargo, N.D., to Minneapolis surged
56%, while the national average rose only 17% and Northwest
systemwide prices inched up only 5%.</p>
<p>But Transportation Department numbers showed the state's
air fares are "in line" with national numbers. Slightly red
faced, North Dakota dropped the suit in exchange for a
promise by the airline that it wouldn't gouge residents.</p>
<p>The government study is "more up to date," says Nicholas
Spaeth, North Dakota's attorney general. According to Mr.
Spaeth, the federal government's report signaled that state
fares didn't change in 1989 while fares across the country
rose.</p>
<p>North Dakota isn't the only one baffled. Earlier this
year, the California Commission on Aviation and Airports
became so confused by piles of testimony and research on air
fares that it couldn't issue a verdict on what has happened
to California ticket prices since deregulation. Says
Christopher Thompson, a consultant to the commission: "It's
mind-boggling."</p>
<p>All's Fair in Love</p>
<p>And First-Class Seats</p>
<p>FREQUENT FLIERS are scheming to upgrade their seats to
first class.</p>
<p>Free upgrades from coach seats are the hottest awards in
frequent-flier programs. As a result, first-class seats have
become harder to find. Many airlines won't let fliers upgrade
their seats until 24 hours before the flight. By then, many
seats already are taken. Frequently, airlines put would-be
upgraders on a standby list until the last minute, to make
sure there will be room for anyone willing to pay real money
for a first-class seat.</p>
<p>To increase the odds that there will be room for them to
upgrade their tickets, some frequent fliers are booking
phantom travelers in first class. When the seats go unclaimed
at the airport, airline counter agents run through their
standby list and the schemers can step forward and get a
seat.</p>
<p>To get around the 24-hour rule, some frequent fliers book
phantom travelers days in advance and then cancel the
reservation a few hours before the flight. Then they'll call
back to make their upgrade. If all goes well, they'll be told
a seat just opened up.</p>
<p>"We've got to do this stuff," says an upholstery salesman
aboard a USAir flight to Chicago. "It's a dog-eat-dog world."</p>
<p>Pan Am Belt-Tightening</p>
<p>Shows Up at Mealtime</p>
<p>AMID FINANCIAL woes, Pan Am has launched a cost-reduction
drive that's expected to save an estimated $4 million a year.
It may reduce some passenger waists as well.</p>
<p>Among the cutbacks: On many short-haul flights, the ailing
carrier used to serve soup, a sandwich and dessert. By axing
the soup, Pan Am will save about $500,000 a year. On flights
between New York and Warsaw, first-class passengers will no
longer get caviar.</p>
<p>Not all of the fat to trim is from food: First-class
passengers now will get just one hot towel, instead of two.</p>
