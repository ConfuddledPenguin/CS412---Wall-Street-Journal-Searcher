	<p class="article-leader">CHICAGO -- The Chicago Mercantile Exchange said it fined a
trader in its Standard and Poor's 500-stock-index futures pit
$50,000 for violating trading rules Oct. 16.
   That was a day of frenzied trading as the stock market
fell sharply and then rebounded sharply in the wake of the
Oct. 13 minicrash, when the Dow Jones Industrial Average
plunged 190 points.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The futures exchange said Lloyd D. Gabbert traded in two
different accounts to create a loss in one account and a
profit in the other to satisfy a loss.</p>
<p>Mr. Gabbert didn't admit or deny the infraction. The Merc
said he agreed to a settlement that included the fine plus a
six-month suspension from trading.</p>
