	<p class="article-leader">ATLANTA -- Georgia-Pacific Corp. said it is considering
the sale of some assets to pay down debt from its recent
$3.74 billion acquisition of Great Northern Nekoosa Corp.
   While the forest-products concern declined to estimate the
value of the assets under study, one industry analyst said
three mills alone that might be sold could bring $1.1 billion
to $1.2 billion.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Georgia-Pacific said the decision to sell some assets
resulted from a study of the huge portfolio of holdings
resulting from the merger with Nekoosa. The study, not
surprisingly, turned up some operational overlap,
particularly among containerboard assets, said T. Marshall
Hahn, Georgia-Pacific's chairman and chief executive officer.</p>
<p>"This is a strategic decision, not one of necessity," Mr.
Hahn said. "In addition, we wanted to squelch any rumors
before they got started of certain mills and plants being
sold."</p>
<p>Indeed, Georgia-Pacific had sought to play down the need
to sell assets throughout its four-month battle to acquire
Nekoosa. "The view always was that they would sell two or
three mills to work down the initial debt," said Gary
Palmero, an Oppenheimer & Co. analyst who made the $1.1
billion to $1.2 billion estimate. "The company is in a
position where it's not necessary, but it's certainly
desirable."</p>
<p>Georgia-Pacific said assets targeted for possible sale
include mills in Georgia, Oregon and Wisconsin that make
linerboard, corrugating medium and kraft paper -- used to
make containerboard for boxes; several thousand acres of
accompanying timberland, and 17 box plants around the
country.</p>
<p>Mr. Hahn, while declining to estimate how much the assets
might fetch, said any proceeds would be used to reduce
Georgia-Pacific's debt load.</p>
<p>Oppenheimer's Mr. Palmero said the three mills "are all
well-run mills that will be in demand. The fact that
Georgia-Pacific isn't desperate only adds to the value."</p>
<p>Mr. Hahn said Georgia-Pacific "will move without delay"
now that it has completed its study. "We've had a good many
inquiries about these and other assets," he said. "That
obviously puts us in a position to move ahead."</p>
<p>In New York Stock Exchange composite trading,
Georgia-Pacific closed at $41.625, up 62.5 cents.</p>
<p>Separately, Ronald P. Hogan and James C. Van Meter were
elected Georgia-Pacific directors, bringing total membership
to 16. Mr. Hogan, 49 years old, is president and chief
operating officer. Mr. Van Meter, 52 years old, is executive
vice president, finance, and chief financial officer.</p>
