	<p class="article-leader">NEWTON, Mass. -- Cahners Publishing Co., which has been on
a buying binge of U.S. magazines, hired veteran magazine
publisher John J. Beni to pursue more acquisitions and
start-ups of consumer publications.
   Mr. Beni, 58 years old, was named senior vice president
and general manager of Cahners's Consumer Magazine division.
He had been president and publisher of New York Times Co.
Magazine Group's McCall's magazine.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Cahners Publishing is the U.S. publishing subsidiary of
London-based Reed International PLC. Cahners publishes 65
trade magazines and newspapers, as well as 10 consumer
magazines, such as Modern Bride and American Baby. In 1989,
Cahners's trade and consumer publications had revenue of $500
million.</p>
<p>Backed by Reed's deep pockets, Cahners has paid premium
prices for new U.S. properties in recent years. In 1987,
Cahners paid Diamandis Communications Inc. $64 million for
Modern Bride. In 1989, it paid $825 million for News Corp's
travel and hotel industry publications and electronic
publishing properties.</p>
<p>Mr. Beni, who was once president of Gruner + Jahr U.S.A.
Publishing, said Cahners is in the midst of negotiating
acquisitions of existing magazines as well as spinning off
new magazines from existing titles. Cahners spun off Health
Kids magazine from American Baby and, most recently, Your
Prom magazine from Modern Bride. Most Cahners magazines are
distributed largely on newsstands or under controlled
circulation, such as to doctors' waiting rooms.</p>
<p>"We are looking for line extensions based on our existing
publications," said Mr. Beni. He added that possible new
magazines could come from Cahners's Modern Bride and its
boating group of trade titles. As for acquisitions, Mr. Beni
said, "If there is anything out there that is a good fit, the
money will be there to buy it, be it one magazine, or a
collection of magazines."</p>
