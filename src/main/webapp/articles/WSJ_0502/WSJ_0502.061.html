	<p class="article-leader">British & Commonwealth Holdings PLC (B&C), a troubled U.K.
financial-services group, said holders of its bonds won't
declare the company in default.
   Law Debentures Trust Corp. PLC, trustee for holders of
several classes of the company's bonds, has decided against
forcing the company to repay the bonds at this time.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"Law Debentures recognizes that B&C and its advisers are
working on proposals" that would restructure the company in a
way that would ensure the company would meet its credit
obligations, B&C said.</p>
<p>It will resist calling the company in default so long as
it "remains otherwise satisfied that the interests of its
beneficiaries will not be further prejudiced," B&C said.</p>
