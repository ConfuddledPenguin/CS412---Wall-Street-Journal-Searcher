	<p class="article-leader">Cambridge, Mass. -- Tommy Rawson, an 81-year-old fight
trainer, is yelling instructions to two pairs of boxers.
"Jab, jab, right hand, watch your stance now." The duo on the
right is obviously new to the game. They move awkwardly in
and out of each other's range and appear surprised when they
are on either end of a successful punch. The pair on the
left, heavyweights with experience, glide easily, exchanging
crisp punches and displaying effective defense. Rawson waits
till the action reaches a crescendo then yells, "Time."
   Harvard's Malkin Athletic Center, the main gym on campus,
usually is home to such civil activities as badminton,
PingPong and ballet. But for a few hours each afternoon,
Rawson and his fighters commandeer the second-floor
mezzanine, and he teaches the intricacies of the sweet
science. While most of his charges are neophytes, Rawson
clearly is not. He's been training undergrads since Herbert
Hoover was sleeping in the White House.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"I enjoy seeing them come in. Most of them start out and
they don't know how to close their fists. By the end of a
semester they're doing well and have the basics down. First
they crawl, then they walk. With the fundamentals they can
defend themselves. It's a pleasure to watch them develop
their skills."</p>
<p>The better heavyweight comes over and Rawson helps him out
of his gloves. He is honor student Dennis Clark, the star
pugilist of the class of 1990 and Rawson's first heavyweight
Golden Gloves champion since 1949.</p>
<p>"You look good. But I don't want you standing there after
you punch. Remember, keep moving side to side, that way you
won't give him anything to hit."</p>
<p>Each year roughly 80 students come under Rawson's guidance
while only one or two go as far as fighting in outside
competition. Unlike many other schools, Harvard does not let
students fight under its name. As far as Clark and others are
concerned, it's just as well. The broken mill town of Lowell,
where the Gloves are held, is a long way from Harvard Yard
and not many fans, or judges, can be expected to look
favorably on Ivy Leaguers in their tournament. Like Jewish
and Italian fighters in the 1920s who took Irish names to
meet popular expectations, Harvard boxers fight under the
banners of gyms located on meaner streets.</p>
<p>Rawson came to the ring in traditional Ivy League fashion
-- through his father. Tommy Rawson Sr. had more than 300
professional fights and was the New England featherweight
champion. Rawson the younger compiled an amazing amateur
record of 222 wins and 5 losses. Professionally, he was 82
and 7, won the New England lightweight crown, and came within
one fight of a world title shot. "In those days you had eight
world championships, today there are what, 68 titles. It's
ridiculous." While he talks Rawson is watching four fresh
fighters mix it up. One of them is eating too many jabs.</p>
<p>"Time. Come here. You got a head, now let's use it. Slip
his punch when he jabs and come back with one of your own.
And keep your hands up." Rawson moves and punches to
demonstrate, still graceful a half century after retirement.
"How do you feel?" The fighter, eager to please, assures
Rawson he can go on and heads back into action.</p>
<p>"Boxing is a game of skill and cleverness. A good boxer
can always outpoint a puncher. You don't want to get hit.
It's a thinking game. Not just hit me and I'll hit you like
some people believe. I get these guys in good condition
first, then you want to dovetail the conditioning and the
skills. That's what makes a good boxer."</p>
<p>One thing you notice about Rawson is his influence over
his fighters. Like students in most big-time universities,
they sometimes wait weeks for 10 minutes with a professor,
but Rawson is there everyday. And he is as learned in his
field as any of Harvard's academic heavyweights.</p>
<p>"Without Tommy there's no way I could have won the Gloves.
I'm constantly learning with him. The guy is unbelievable,"
says Clark, who started fighting as a freshman after a neck
injury ended a promising football career.</p>
<p>"He's an inspiration; he makes you want to do well. You
know he cares about his fighters. He takes the time to make
sure you get it right," says Clark.</p>
<p>"They get out of it what they put into it. We use a
handicap system to determine who's going to box who. If a guy
is new, he gets to throw everything while the more
experienced guy will just use the jab. That way I can control
things and no one gets hurt. This builds their confidence.
When I think they're ready then I let them go full out,"
Rawson says.</p>
<p>"It's the best exercise there is. I don't encourage them
to compete, but if they want to, I prepare them as best I
can."</p>
<p>Rawson's relationships with his fighters often last
decades. He is still in touch with Tommy Rodgers, his most
remarkable boxer. Rodgers attended Harvard in the late 50s,
and though he did not win any outside tournaments, he remains
a legend around the Harvard Boxing Club. He lost his right
arm and part of his heel in a train accident and still wanted
to be a fighter.</p>
<p>"He kept coming to me and wanting to box. I didn't want to
let him, but finally I felt I had to. We used to have
on-campus bouts between the houses. He won the house
championships two years in a row. He had desire, see. And
that shows you how far it can take you."</p>
<p>Despite his age Rawson shows no signs of slowing down.
When asked how long he thinks he'll be training fighters, he
smiles: "I'll be here as long as I feel all right."</p>
<p>You get the impression that will be a long time.</p>
