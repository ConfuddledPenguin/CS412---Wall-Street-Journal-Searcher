	<p class="article-leader">A Maryland judge delivered a costly defeat to a group of
minority shareholders who contended they weren't treated
fairly in a CSX Corp. restructuring plan.
   Squeezed out in the 1987 reorganization, the minority
holders of Baltimore & Ohio Railroad Co. had contended they
weren't offered fair value for their shares. But State
Circuit Court Judge Joseph H.H. Kaplan in Baltimore
disagreed, upholding an unusual appraisers' report that
concluded the CSX offer was too generous and that minority
stockholders deserved even less.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Legal experts say similar cases involving valuation of
minority stock usually end up either affirming company offers
or else awarding the holders additional money. "This is sort
of a man-biting-the-dog situation," says Richard Magid, an
attorney in Baltimore with Whiteford, Taylor & Preston,
counsel for CSX. "I've never heard of appraisers coming in
below what a company had offered."</p>
<p>The suit grew out of a plan in which CSX decided to merge
its Chesapeake & Ohio Railway Co. unit with the B&O road. At
the time, B&O was about 95%-owned by the C&O Railway. CSX
offered to pay the minority holders $124 a share for their
holdings. Roughly one-third of the minority holders accepted
the offer, but others went to court, alleging that the fair
value of the stock was $412.17 a share.</p>
<p>Last month, a panel of three court-appointed appraisers
determined that the fair value of the stock was $112.44 a
share, $11.56 less than CSX had offered and $299.73 less than
the plaintiffs had been seeking. Based on some 80,000
minority shares Mr. Magid said were represented in the suit,
the price differential would amount to about $1 million less
than CSX had offered, and about $24 million less than
plaintiffs were seeking.</p>
<p>"In sum, we think the defendants overpaid," the appraisers
concluded. In their report, the appraisers observed that CSX
may have chosen to "err toward generosity" in an attempt to
avoid litigation. But they added that the definition of "fair
value" doesn't encompass any "largess" that might have been
included in the merger price. Judge Kaplan didn't issue a
written opinion when he approved the report Monday.</p>
<p>William Klein II, a New York attorney for several of the
minority holders, said that the decision was a "shock" but
that it probably wouldn't be appealed. "I think it's wrong,
but it's American now to say, to hell with shareholders,"
said Mr. Klein, an attorney with Tenzer, Greenblatt, Fallon &
Kaplan.</p>

<p>AETNA CHALLENGES state law controlling its exit from auto
insurance market.</p>
<p>Aetna Life & Casualty Co. has filed suit in federal court
in Boston attacking the constitutionality of two
Massachusetts laws that dictate how an insurer can withdraw
from the state's auto insurance market.</p>
<p>Aetna and several other insurers, including Travelers
Inc., Xerox Corp.'s Crum & Forster unit and Cigna Corp., have
announced plans to cut back on their auto insurance business
nationwide or drop out entirely because they face mounting
losses.</p>
<p>The suit challenges one Massachusetts statute that forces
insurers to pay a yearly assessement for eight years to the
state's pool for high-risk drivers, which is shunned by
conventional insurers. Payment of the fee would allow Aetna
to withdraw from the Massachusetts auto insurance market but
retain its licenses to sell other insurance. The company
estimates that paying this fee for eight years could amount
to well over $200 million.</p>
<p>The other law contested in the suit gives the insurance
commissioner the power to revoke all of an insurer's licenses
if the company pulls out of the car insurance market.</p>
<p>The Massachusetts laws would force an insurer "to pay an
extortionate tax or give up its valuable property," says
Stephen Deutsch, an attorney with Foley, Hoag & Eliot,
counsel to Aetna.</p>
<p>Fund American Cos. and Allstate Insurance Co., a unit of
Sears, Roebuck & Co., have decided to give up all insurance
licenses in Massachusetts. But Aetna, the state's
second-largest insurer behind Liberty Mutual Insurance Co.,
does not want to do that.</p>
<p>Timothy Gailey, Massachusetts's insurance commissioner,
believes that if Aetna wins its suit, a state's ability to
control its markets would be reduced. "A state should be able
to say which companies can go or stay under reasonable
conditions."</p>
<p>If the Massachusetts regulations are struck down in court,
"other states won't try to use this extortionate device as a
means of trapping companies into their local economies," says
Laurence Tribe, a constitutional law professor at Harvard
University who is working with Aetna's attorneys.</p>
<p>Earlier this year in California, Travelers successfully
challenged a provision of the state's Proposition 103 that
would have made it impossible for a company to withdraw from
a segment of the insurance market.</p>
<p>In New Jersey, an insurer can be asked to turn in all of
its licenses if it plans to quit the personal insurance
business, although the decision is made at the discretion of
the insurance commissioner.</p>
<p>New Jersey's insurance department has won a preliminary
injunction against Twin Cities Insurance Co., a unit of ITT
Hartford Group, keeping the company from leaving the state
without developing an orderly plan of withdrawal.</p>

<p>TWO SENATORS FACING ETHICS inquiries set up legal defense
funds.</p>
<p>Sen. David Durenberger, who is being investigated by the
Senate Ethics Committee for questionable financial
transactions involving a book promotion arrangement and real
estate dealings, has hired GOP fund-raiser Steven Gordon to
help fatten his legal fund, which was set up in March.</p>
<p>A spokesman for the Minnesota Republican said yesterday
that Sen. Durenberger owes more than $100,000 to the two law
firms that are representing him in the ethics investigation,
Washington's Olwine, Connelly, Chase, O'Donnell & Weyher and
Minneapolis's Popham, Haik, Schnindbrich, Kaufman & Doty.</p>
<p>The head of the Durenberger Legal Expense Trust Fund,
Minnesota businessman Wheelock Whitney, said the committee
would accept contributions only from individuals. Under
Senate rules, individuals and political action committees can
give a maximum of $10,000 a year to such legal funds.</p>
<p>Sen. Durenberger hasn't yet disclosed any of the
contributors to the fund and isn't required to do so until
July. Mr. Gordon declined to comment on who he was
soliciting.</p>
<p>Sen. Alan Cranston, one of five senators facing an ethics
inquiry into their ties to thrift executive Charles Keating,
reported last month that he has raised $105,510 for his legal
defense fund during the first three months of 1990. Among
those giving the maximum $10,000 contribution were the
fashion designer Liz Claiborne and her husband, Arthur
Ortenberg. Former Commerce Secretary Philip Klutznick gave
$2,000. Sen. Cranston, a California Democrat, also received
$10,000 from a political action committee sponsored by the
sheet metal workers union.</p>
<p>Sen. Cranston has paid two Washington law firms, Powell,
Goldstein, Frazer & Murphy and Zuckerman, Spaeder, Goldstein,
Taylor & Kolker $97,575 from his legal fund.</p>
<p>Five other senators are facing ethics inquiries, but they
are paying their legal bills out of personal funds or
campaign funds.</p>

<p>LAWYER IS TRIED ON CHARGES of helping sell Ashland Oil
secrets to Iran.</p>
<p>Charles Barnett, of Palm Beach, Fla., is accused of fraud
in a scheme to sell confidential Ashland Oil Co. documents to
the Iranian national oil company. Federal prosecutors allege
that Iran planned to use the documents in a suit against
Ashland, and that Mr. Barnett, in return, would have received
a cut of any damages Iran won. The case also involves former
Ashland Chairman Orin Atkins, who last year pleaded guilty to
two counts of conspiracy and wire fraud for his role in the
scheme. Mr. Atkins is expected to testify against Mr.
Barnett.</p>
<p>The U.S. attorney's office in Manhattan has charged that
Mr. Atkins, who will be sentenced this summer, initiated the
plan in 1982 after being forced to resign his executive
posts. But in his opening arguments this week, Assistant U.S.
Attorney Herve Gouraige said Mr. Barnett was instrumental in
getting the Iranians to agree to the alleged scheme.</p>
<p>Mr. Barnett, 38 years old, "thoroughly familiarized
himself with the contents of the stolen Ashland documents so
that he could explain their usefulness to the Iranians," Mr.
Gouraige said. Iran sued Ashland in 1985 for $780 million for
not paying for oil delivered in 1979. Ashland settled the
case last year by agreeing to pay $325 million.</p>
<p>Mr. Barnett's attorney, Marvin Segal, said in his opening
statement to the jury that Mr. Barnett's efforts were part of
a "legal enterprise to help the Iranian oil company collect
the money it avowedly was owed."</p>
<p>An Ashland attorney, the first witness in the case,
testified that the company had refused to pay Iran for the
oil because it believed Iran had breached the contract.</p>

<p>JUDGE ORDERS BREAK in Marcos trial while defense
interviews witnesses in the Philippines.</p>
<p>Federal Judge John Keenan said he will recess Imelda
Marcos's racketeering trial for two weeks in June so that
defense attorneys can take depositions from at least two
witnesses -- including one who claims he helped Ferdinand
Marcos recover a mysterious hoard of gold. Mrs. Marcos's
attorneys say the witnesses are unable to leave the
Philippines.</p>
<p>Mrs. Marcos, who fled the Philippines with her husband in
1986, is charged with stealing more than $160 million from
the Philippines and secretly hiding the assets in the U.S.
Mr. Marcos, who ruled the Philippines for 20 years, died in
September.</p>
<p>Attorneys for Mrs. Marcos say Orlando Dulay, an
ex-military officer, will testify that he transported large
amounts of the gold to the Marcos home. They say the
discovery of the gold, supposedly hidden in the Philippines
by a Japanese general during World War II, accounts for the
Marcoses' immense wealth. Prosecutors say the couple amassed
millions by plundering the Philippines treasury. Mr. Dulay is
in jail on charges of killing campaign workers for Philippine
President Corazon Aquino.</p>
<p>Judge Keenan refused to lift Mrs. Marcos's bail
restrictions to allow her to return to the Philippines for
the depositions.</p>
<p>He also rejected a request that a deposition be taken from
Mrs. Aquino, who succeeded Mr. Marcos as president.</p>

<p>AN EXPERIMENTAL PRO BONO program that would be voluntary
for lawyers has been endorsed by New York State's highest
judge. Chief Judge Sol Wachtler of the Court of Appeals made
the announcement in response to a proposal that the state's
80,000 lawyers be required to perform a minimum of 40 hours
of public service work every two years. The recommendation
was made earlier this week by a committee appointed by Judge
Wachtler. He said that if a voluntary program fails, he will
propose that the courts force lawyers to provide free legal
serivces to the poor.</p>
