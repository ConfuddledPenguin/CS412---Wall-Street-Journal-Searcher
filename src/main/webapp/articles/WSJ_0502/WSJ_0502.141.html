	<p class="article-leader">LONDON -- Bank of Credit & Commerce International said it
had a net loss of $498 million in 1989, largely as a result
of $600 million in loan charges.
   The closely held bank, which had a net loss of $48 million
in 1988 after loan provisions totaling $145 million, also
confirmed that the Abu Dhabi government injected $400 million
to help it meet international loan standards. The injection,
which included the issue of new shares in the bank, boosted
Abu Dhabi's stake to 77%.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Earlier this week, it was reported that Abu Dhabi had
become the majority holder of BCCI by acquiring a 20% stake
held by Saudi Arabia's Bin-Mahfouz family. Even before the
acquisition and cash injection, the emirate and its ruling
family members represented the largest block of shareholders
in the bank, which is based in Luxembourg.</p>
<p>BCCI said it had operating profit before loan provisions
of $224 million, up from $192 million in 1988. It added that
total capital after the cash injection was $1.48 billion, up
from $1.42 billion at the end of 1988. Total assets were
$23.5 billion, up from $20.6 billion.</p>
<p>BCCI didn't disclose full 1989 operating results. Its
brief statement followed reports that it would announce sharp
losses for the year and possibly sweeping organizational
changes.</p>
