	<p class="article-leader">Jacobs Engineering Group Inc., Pasadena, Calif., said it
signed a mutual cooperation agreement with Maeda Corp. of
Tokyo, under which the companies will pursue engineering and
construction projects internationally.
   Initially, Jacobs and Maeda will target projects in the
U.S. A Jacobs spokesman said that neither company could
project the value of the association, but that in several
years, the agreement could produce a "substantial portion" of
both firms' business.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>In addition to construction and engineering services,
Jacobs provides environmental and hazardous-waste services.
Maeda, one of Japan's largest engineering and construction
firms, is known for its work on civil engineering projects,
factories and commercial buildings.</p>
