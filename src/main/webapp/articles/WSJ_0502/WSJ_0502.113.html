	<p class="article-leader">Rogers Communications Inc. said the company's president
and chief executive, Edward Rogers, raised his voting stake
in the company from 81%, to 89%, by converting some preferred
share holdings to Class A voting shares.
   Mr. Rogers held the 4,150,000 Series VII convertible
preferred shares through his wholly owned Rogers Real Estate
Development Ltd.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>A spokesman for the Toronto-based telecommunications
concern said the company had planned to exercise its right to
buy back the series at 10 Canadian dollars (US$8.59) a share,
if Mr. Rogers hadn't decided to convert the preferred shares.</p>
<p>The conversion will save the company C$4 million in
dividend payments in 1990, the spokesman said. Because the
dividend rate is pegged to Canada's prime rate, which has
risen steadily in recent months, he said the dividend
payments have become "burdensome."</p>
<p>In trading on the Toronto Stock Exchange, the Class A
shares of Rogers closed at C$11, unchanged. The widely held
Class B non-voting shares closed at C$7.13, down 38 Canadian
cents.</p>
