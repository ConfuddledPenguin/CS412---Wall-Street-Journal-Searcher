	<p class="article-leader">I am glad to see Frederick C. Klein take the schools to
task for the gross mistreatment of their athletes (Leisure &
Arts, March 23). The schools, pro teams and networks all make
big bucks and the players are signed to pristine
non-compensatory contracts, we are led to believe.
   The young basketball player who died on the court recently
had a $1 million disability insurance policy (not life) for
which he had paid $6,600 out of pocket. I don't know many
collegians who can afford that kind of money for anything,
much less insurance. And now Notre Dame announces a $6
million adder in TV revenues over the next few years by
virtue of a new contract with NBC. That comes to more than
$10,000 per year per man on the roster, whether
fourth-stringer or scholarship hero. It doesn't seem right.</p>
