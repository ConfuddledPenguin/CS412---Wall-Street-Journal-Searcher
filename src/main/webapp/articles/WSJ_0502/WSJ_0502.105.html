	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- David Mullins hasn't joined the Federal
Reserve yet, but he already sounds like an old-timer.
   Mr. Mullins is the assistant Treasury secretary who is
awaiting Senate approval to a seat on the Fed's board of
governors. In written answers submitted to the Senate Banking
Committee recently, Mr. Mullins said he would oppose
immediate release of the minutes of Fed meetings. Immediate
release of the minutes has long been urged by outsiders, but
is staunchly opposed by Fed officials, who value their
secrecy. Mr. Mullins said release of the minutes "may add to
volatility" in the financial markets.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Mr. Mullins also said he would oppose legislation
requiring regular audits of the Fed by the Congress's General
Accounting Office, saying that would compromise "the
independence of the Fed."</p>
<p>But Mr. Mullins expressed some disagreement with Fed
Chairman Alan Greenspan on which federal regulator should set
margin, or credit, requirements, for stock-index futures. Mr.
Mullins said the Fed may be the appropriate agency; Mr.
Greenspan has argued against giving the Fed that power.</p>
<p>The Treasury official indicated little interest in his own
department's efforts to intervene in foreign-exchange
markets, saying: "In my view, intervention in the
foreign-exchange markets has never been an especially
important tool of United States monetary policy."</p>
