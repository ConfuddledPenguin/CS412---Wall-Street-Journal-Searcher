	<p class="article-leader">TOKYO -- Komei Tai is in a jam. He owes $600 million.
Creditors have seized his business. Gangsters are hunting
him. And Tokyo's haywire stock market no longer can bail him
out.
   It is the stock market's gyrations, in fact, that put him
in this jam. Mr. Tai is a professional stock speculator. A
big winner in boom times, he may well be the most notorious
victim of the Tokyo market's dramatic plunge this year.
Strewn in with his wreckage are dozens of securities firms,
financiers and a handful of companies in which he held stock.
With share prices on the stock exchange languishing, Mr.
Tai's prospects for recovery are bad. But few here show him
sympathy: Police had to rescue Mr. Tai a month ago after a
group of creditors turned hostile and tried to kidnap him.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"We are in difficulty," admits Ryutaro Zaima, who was
managing Mr. Tai's main enterprise -- a $12.50-an-hour "love
hotel" -- before it was stormed and shut down recently by
angry lenders. Peering furtively over a cup of coffee at a
cafe, he insists he doesn't know how to contact his boss, who
has been on the lam for more than a month. Mr. Tai, through
his lawyers, declined to be interviewed for this article.</p>
<p>The downfall of Komei Tai and his company, Akebono Kikaku,
is a tale of the times in Japan. In the past decade, when
Japan's market leapt to a succession of new highs,
speculators like Mr. Tai became important players. Leveraged
to the hilt with billions of dollars in borrowed money,
speculators terrorized companies with threatened takeovers or
noisy complaints. They usually demanded to be bought out at a
profit -- a practice known as greenmail -- or simply dumped
their stock back into the market when share prices rose,
making a profit for themselves but often causing losses for
other investors.</p>
<p>Speculators have been a fixture in Japan's stock market
for decades, throwing their influence around in a most
un-Japanese way. But as stock and land prices boomed, their
influence has grown. Companies as big as automobile giants
Nissan Motor Co. and Toyota Motor Corp. and camera-maker
Konica Corp. have been their targets. The companies have
retaliated by strongly supporting a change in the law
expected to go into effect this September requiring investors
to disclose significant stakes in listed companies.</p>
<p>Currently, it isn't always clear who the speculators are.
Some are thought to be criminals. The body of one Osaka
speculator who police say was involved with a local crime
syndicate was found buried two years ago in a cement mixer.
Still others are corporate raiders. One group staged Japan's
first-ever hostile takeover last year when it took control of
an aerial surveying concern it had stalked. And a few have
political connections. Former Prime Minister Yasuhiro
Nakasone has been cited in the Japanese press as being close
to at least one rich speculator group that has helped finance
his campaigns.</p>
<p>This year's 25% decline in the Japanese stock market has
fueled a new worry about speculators: Many market
participants fear that the demise of a few speculator groups
could bankrupt some small securities companies or financiers
and force a desperate new selling frenzy on financial
markets.</p>
<p>"An ominous mood has settled over the market," says Akira
Suzuki, a writer who specializes in stocks. On March 19, the
market suffered one of its biggest declines ever when rumors
spread that a speculator placed a large order for stock but
couldn't afford to pay for it. (The rumor proved correct.)
Reverberations from this sort of event can be felt as far
away as Wall Street. When fears spread April 4 that a major
Japanese speculator group was near collapse, U.S. investors
ran for the safety of U.S. Treasury bonds, pushing the Dow
Jones Industrial Average down 0.6%.</p>
<p>Ask Yamaichi Securities Co. about the hazard speculators
pose in Tokyo. The big Japanese firm says it is facing a loss
of as much as $24 million because an unnamed speculator group
couldn't pay for an order placed during the market decline
this year. Or ask Morgan Stanley Group Inc. The U.S. firm
lost as much as $7 million in August 1988 when another
stock-market speculator here failed to pay for a block of
stock he had ordered.</p>
<p>Many firms, including Morgan Stanley, say they won't deal
with any company or investor known for stock-market
speculation. But speculators operate under many names, Morgan
Stanley discovered. And as long as the fees flow, securities
firms are loath to cut off the business. "Did we make
mistakes? Yeah, and that's history," says John S. Wadsworth,
president of Morgan Stanley's Japan operation. "But there are
going to be a lot of people who are going to learn a lot of
this stuff soon."</p>
<p>Since prices began tumbling at the start of the year,
securities firms here have been erecting systems to guard
against losses from speculators. Some have lists of companies
whose business they avoid; others are demanding full
collateral for stock purchases. An industry group, the Japan
Securities Dealers Association, has gathered information from
more than a dozen anxious firms about risky deals, including
those pursued by Mr. Tai. One guess circulating among
brokerage houses is that 20 firms and nearly as many finance
companies could lose money on Mr. Tai's transactions. Losses
from all the speculator groups ensnared in the market's drop
could total as much as half a billion dollars, analysts
estimate.</p>
<p>Clearly, every market has its speculators. But Japan's
well-orchestrated bands share little of the legitimacy of the
arbitragers who prowl Wall Street. Known here as "shite" -- a
reference to the main actors in traditional Japanese mask
dramas -- speculators make a full-time business of
stock-market investment. That goes against the grain in
harmony-conscious Japan, where cross-holdings between
companies are the cozy norm. According to Jardine Fleming
Securities Ltd., stable shareholdings account for as much as
two-thirds of the stock market. When speculators move in,
they upset that comfortable world.</p>
<p>That is why Texas oil man T. Boone Pickens Jr. caused such
a ruckus when he surfaced last year as a major investor in
Koito Manufacturing Co. Just the notion of a foreigner taking
an unsolicited bite of a Japanese auto parts company was bad
enough; but worse -- from the Japanese perspective -- was
that a speculator, Kitaro Watanabe, sold Mr. Pickens the
shares.</p>
<p>A report prepared by the Tokyo Stock Exchange and the
Finance Ministry last year underscored the breadth of
speculator influence on the market. The report estimated that
in the three years to March 31, 1989, 128 stocks -- or nearly
one in ten of those listed on the exchange -- were cornered
by stock-market speculators. And nearly all speculators
recoup their money; in two-thirds of the cases, the stock
prices of targeted stocks rose two- to ten-fold as a result
of speculator purchases, nearly all within two years of a
speculator group taking its stake. In 22 cases, the
speculators were bought out at a profit.</p>
<p>That high success rate made speculators popular with
financiers. An entire business sprang up to fund investors
who play Japan's stock and property markets aggressively, the
so-called "machikin." So lucrative are the returns that even
big companies get involved: One of the firms that holds the
mortgage to Mr. Tai's love hotel, for instance, is Kawasaki
Enterprises Inc., a venture backed by Kawasaki Steel Corp.
and some big banks, including Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank Ltd. and
Long-Term Credit Bank Ltd.</p>
<p>The new plight of several speculators has rattled many of
the machikin finance groups. "I expect a considerable number
of machikin to go belly-up," says Tatsumori Takeyama, a
spokesman for one relatively well-off machikin, Daiki Corp.
His firm, housed in its own eight-story, glass-and-marble
building in central Tokyo, figures it has the wherewithal to
survive. But he says that's only because the firm insisted on
holding blue-chip stocks as collateral for its loans to
speculators. Daiki's $4 million in loans to Mr. Tai, for
instance, were secured by big-company stocks.</p>
<p>The way Mr. Takeyama sees it, for speculators "investing
in stocks is like narcotics. They can't control themselves."
But Daiki, too, has gotten caught in the rush. The company
has been trying to collect $45 million from one well-known
speculator, Seikichi Endo, who "became a beggar," in Mr.
Takeyama's words, when his sizable holdings in two regional
banks plummeted in value this year. Mr. Endo couldn't be
reached for comment.</p>
<p>Mr. Endo wasn't the only speculator to get burned in that
play. Stock market sources say Mr. Tai and companies he
controls, Akebono Kikaku and Sanwa Enterprises, also were
buying stock in the banks -- Kagoshima Bank Ltd. and Higo
Bank Ltd. -- partly with money borrowed from Mr. Endo. That
reveals another common practice among Japanese speculators:
weighing in on each other's raids. Even small-time
speculators sometimes lend money to large speculator groups.</p>
<p>"Mr. Tai was eaten by fellow speculators" who sold out
early, says Mr. Suzuki, the writer. Mr. Suzuki notes that
when he met Mr. Tai, he wasn't impressed. A plain dresser and
free spender, the 43-year-old Mr. Tai has a bad reputation in
Tokyo's stock-market district, Mr. Suzuki says. The reason?
"He would take profits ahead of other speculators," says Mr.
Suzuki.</p>
<p>In many ways, though, Mr. Tai's experience as a
stock-market speculator was classic. He began his career
outside the market, friends and associates say, as a medical
doctor. His father, in addition to being a doctor himself,
had invested in property in Tokyo. When his father died,
Komei Tai faced an inheritance-tax bill on the property of a
sum equal to several million dollars, he explained to a
Japanese weekly magazine earlier this year. Unable to pay it
outright but determined not to sacrifice his family's
property, he began investing in the stock market -- borrowing
money against his property.</p>
<p>When the stock market crashed, Mr. Tai had debts of around
$600 million, according to corporate credit banks. His main
fixed asset was his hotel, worth about $20 million, although
he had large blocks of stock held in collateral by a number
of finance firms. He held sizable stakes in several
companies, and was the largest single shareholder in Nikko
Co., a small civil engineering firm.</p>
<p>Because of Mr. Tai's troubles, Nikko's share price has
plummeted two-thirds since last December, causing small
investors to call the company and complain, and making it
difficult for the company to raise new capital by issuing
stock. "It's a nuisance," a spokesman for Nikko says.</p>
<p>Equally annoyed were Mr. Tai's creditors. On March 23,
after Mr. Tai issued a check in his company's name that
bounced, about 20 financiers called a meeting at a business
hotel near the Tokyo Stock Exchange. Some creditors grew
angry and tried to push Mr. Tai into a waiting automobile.
Police stopped them, concluding some were gangsters, and set
Mr. Tai free. He hasn't been seen publicly since then.</p>
<p>The disappearance of Mr. Tai and the downfall of other
stock speculators may mark an important transition in Japan.
Yujiro Hayami, a stock-market observer, says he thinks
Japan's speculators will slowly fade away.</p>
<p>"I don't think they will cease to exist, but {the new law
on disclosures} will make it difficult for them to behave the
way they have," he says. Now, he thinks, they may become
increasingly like America's arbitragers: willing to put money
into an investment they think will bring a quick return,
without pressing for greenmail.</p>
<p>"Until recently, the Tokyo Stock Exchange wasn't a mature
market," says Charles W. Lambert, a broker at Jardine Fleming
Securities' Tokyo branch. "Now it is, and the speculators
will fall."</p>
