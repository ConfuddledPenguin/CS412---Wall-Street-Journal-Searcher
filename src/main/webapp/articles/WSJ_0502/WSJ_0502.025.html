	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Talk about a close call.
   That's what it was for some corporate insiders, according
to filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. These
officers and directors sold stock in their companies just
weeks before prices fell sharply.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>According to the SEC filings:</p>
<p>-- David F. Brown, former chairman of General Development
Corp., sold his entire stake in the Miami real estate company
in the two weeks before it filed for Chapter 11
bankruptcy-law protection April 6. Mr. Brown, who resigned
under pressure from the company's board March 14, sold 39,059
shares at an average price of $4.40 a share. The stock
finished yesterday at $1.375 a share, up 12.5 cents, in New
York Stock Exchange composite trading.</p>
<p>-- Seven insiders at T. Rowe Price Associates Inc. sold
80,765 shares of the mutual fund between March 6 and March
13. Since then, the price of the Baltimore company's stock
has fallen about 16%, chiefly on the company's March 30
announcement that some of its mutual funds held commercial
paper issued by Mortgage & Realty Trust, a real-estate
investment trust that filed for bankruptcy protection. In
national over-the-counter trading yesterday, T. Rowe Price
shares closed at $24.25, down 25 cents; the insiders sold at
an average share price of $28.71.</p>
<p>-- Eight insiders at Network Equipment Technologies Inc.
sold over 164,539 shares in late January and February. They
got $28 to $31 a share; the stock's price has since fallen
sharply, closing yesterday at $10.625 a share, up 87.5 cents,
in New York Stock Exchange composite trading.</p>
<p>Mr. Brown sold all of his General Development Corp. shares
from March 23 through March 30, shortly after he pleaded
guilty March 22 in federal court in Miami to one count of
conspiracy. On the same day, the company also pleaded guilty
in a plea bargain with federal prosecutors to settle charges
it defrauded home buyers by charging inflated prices based on
improper appraisals.</p>
<p>General Development agreed to pay a $500,000 fine, and
under a pending restitution agreement, would pay the home
buyers about $80 million to $100 million over 25 years.</p>
<p>Mr. Brown and his attorney declined to comment on the
sales. Otis Wragg, spokesman for General Development,
declined to comment other than to say that Mr. Brown didn't
have to sell his stock as part of an agreement tied to his
departure from the company.</p>
<p>Although Mr. Brown's shares, at an average price of $4.40
a share, sold for far more than he would have earned if he
had waited to sell them until after the bankruptcy filing,
the former chairman probably lost money on the transaction.
Some of the shares were acquired through a retirement plan,
or through the exercise of warrants provided by the company,
but SEC files show Mr. Brown bought slightly less than half
of the shares in the open market in purchases from 1986
through 1988, paying $13.38 to $22.65 a share.</p>
<p>The stock of T. Rowe Price has also skidded lower since
its insider sales, chiefly on the company's exposure to the
problems of Mortgage & Realty Trust. On April 16, T. Rowe
disclosed it holds about $65 million of the REIT's commercial
paper and notes, and later announced it would take a $4
million charge against second-quarter earnings as a result.</p>
<p>Stephen Norwitz, spokesman for the company, said the
strong pace of insider selling in March was "coincidental,"
adding that Standard & Poor's Corp. didn't downgrade Mortgage
& Realty's commercial paper until March 13 -- after most of
the insiders had sold -- and that the REIT didn't file for
bankruptcy protection until later in the month.</p>
<p>The largest sale was by William D. Gould Jr., a vice
president, who sold 30,000 shares March 6 and March 8. The
sale represented 36% of his holding in the company, SEC
filings show. Stephen Boesel, portfolio manager of the firm's
Growth & Income Mutual Fund, sold 21,000 shares, the first
time he has sold shares since September 1986. SEC filings
show Mr. Boesel retains 21,100 shares, but the company said
he holds an additional 100,000 shares that have been omitted
in filings to the SEC.</p>
<p>The other T. Rowe insiders sold between 1,260 and 15,000
shares, representing 5% to 57% of their holdings, according
to the company.</p>
<p>Mr. Boesel and Mr. Gould declined to comment. Mr. Norwitz
said Mr. Boesel sold his shares to purchase a house, while
Mr. Gould sold to meet a personal obligation.</p>
<p>At Network Equipment Technologies Inc., Chairman Bruce
Smith was one of the biggest sellers, trimming his holdings
50,000 shares Jan. 24 through Feb. 15, according to SEC
filings. They show that he retains 179,781 shares. Steve
Schlumberger, formerly a company vice president and now on
sabbatical, also sold 50,000 shares in February, retaining
75,358 shares, SEC filings show.</p>
<p>The other six NET insiders sold between 393 and 23,000
shares, representing less than 1% to 50% of their holdings in
the company, according to SEC filngs.</p>
<p>The company declined to comment on the sales or to confirm
the SEC figures.</p>
<p>On April 2, the company announced that its fiscal
fourth-quarter results would fall well below expectations. It
reported those results April 25. For the quarter ended March
31, it had earnings of four cents a share, down 87% from a
year earlier, on an 18% revenue rise.</p>
