	<p class="article-leader">CHICAGO -- A former day-care center operator pleaded
guilty in U.S. District Court here to defrauding
telecommunications companies out of nearly $600,000 as the
head of a nationwide computer-hacking ring.
   Leslie Lynne Doucette, 36 years old, working with 152
alleged co-schemers, fraudulently obtained 481 telephone
credit-card codes, according to the plea agreement, and then
published them in voice-mail systems that were accessed by
other hackers. The scheme was discovered when a suburban
Chicago real-estate brokerage complained that its voice-mail
system had been invaded by the hackers, who had changed the
system's passwords.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Federal prosecutors charged Ms. Doucette last year in the
scheme, which according to the indictment resulted in a loss
of $1.6 million of telephone and computer services from the
communications concerns, including American Telephone &
Telegraph Co., ITT Corp., and Western Union Corp.</p>
<p>The one count to which Ms. Doucette eventually pleaded
guilty carries a maximum sentence of ten years in prison, and
a $1 million fine.</p>
