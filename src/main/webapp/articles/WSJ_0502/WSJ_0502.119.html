	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Stock prices moved higher after the first
piece of data on the economy's performance in April pointed
toward a recovery in the manufacturing sector.
   The report from the nation's purchasing managers helped
the market shake off another rise in interest rates, as did
well-received quarterly earnings reports from Chrysler and
Boeing.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Although some futures-related selling and profit-taking
just before the close cut into the market's gains, the Dow
Jones Industrial Average closed 12.16 higher at 2668.92.
Boeing, which jumped 2 1/2 to 72 1/4, accounted for more than
one-third of the rise in the 30-stock average.</p>
<p>Among broader measures, Standard & Poor's 500-Stock Index
advanced 1.45 to 332.25, the New York Stock Exchange
Composite Index went up 0.73 to 182.22, and the Dow Jones
Equity Market Index rose 1.33 to 309.46.</p>
<p>Traders said buying interest remained concentrated on
larger-capitalization issues. Gainers outpaced losers by a
relatively narrow margin of 820 to 679 on the Big Board.</p>
<p>Big Board volume amounted to 149,020,000 shares compared
with 122,750,000 shares Monday. Part of the improvement
stemmed from dividend-related trades by institutions that
boosted volume in the stock of Security Pacific, Chase
Manhattan and Eastern Utilities Associates.</p>
<p>Stocks rallied at the opening and gave back only part of
the gains after the midmorning release of the purchasing
managers' report. The group's index of economic activity rose
in April to 50.2% from 48.8% in March. That marked the first
time in a year that the index stood above 50%, pointing
toward an expansion within the manufacturing sector.</p>
<p>Bond prices retreated to lower levels on the report,
pushing the yield on the Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond
back above the 9% mark, but the downturn affected stocks only
briefly. "People have adjusted to rates being at these
levels," said Edward J. Laux, head of block trading at
Kidder, Peabody & Co.</p>
<p>Investors did more bargain-hunting in the market than they
have lately, Mr. Laux said, citing insurance stocks as a
sector that benefited from the renewed buying interest.
General Re went up 2 1/8 to 79 1/2, Aetna Life & Casualty
advanced 1 1/2 to 47 5/8, Unum gained 3/4 to 44 1/8, and Aon
rose 5/8 to 35 1/2.</p>
<p>Michael Metz, a market strategist at Oppenheimer & Co.,
said the market would need "a new negative" at this point for
stocks to turn lower again. He added that prices appear more
likely to move closer to the upper end of their recent
trading range over the short term, with 2730 or higher for
the Dow industrial average as a target.</p>
<p>"The market is really a trading affairrather than a
decisive bull or bear market," Mr. Metz said, citing "a
profound disinterest by professionals and amateurs alike."</p>
<p>One potential negative for the market is the decline in
dividend payouts. Standard & Poor's Corp. said yesterday that
there were 129 dividend increases last month, down from 149 a
year earlier. In the first four months of this year, dividend
omissions jumped to 83 from 39 in the same period last year,
while dividend decreases rose to 35 from 25. "Companies are
suffering from earnings declines and are harboring cash by
lowering dividends or omitting them entirely," said Arnold
Kaufman, editor of S&P's "Outlook" newsletter.</p>
<p>Security Pacific, Chase and Eastern Utilities took three
of the top four spots on the list of most active Big Board
issues as a result of trades designed to capture quarterly
payouts. Security Pacific finished unchanged at 36 on
composite volume of 3.7 million shares, Chase fell 1/2 to 24
7/8 on 3.6 million shares, and Eastern Utilities dipped 1/8
to 33 5/8 on two million shares.</p>
<p>The fourth company on the most active list was Tosco,
which plummeted 5 1/4 to 17 1/4 on 2.5 million shares after
its board abandoned efforts to sell the company or its
refining business.</p>
<p>Nearly 1.5 million shares of Boeing were traded in the
wake of its strong first-quarter earnings report. The
company's operating income climbed 87% from a year ago on a
60% sales increase.</p>
<p>Chrysler rose 3/4 to 15 1/4 on 1.2 million shares after
its first-quarter earnings report proved better than
expected. While income from continuing operations was down
79% from a year earlier, Chrysler's auto operations posted a
profit for the quarter, which analysts didn't anticipate.</p>
<p>Ames Department Stores gained 1/2 to 2 1/2 on 1.7 million
shares after the company hired as its chief executive officer
Stephen Pistner, a consultant who has played a role in
turnarounds at other retailers. Ames also named Mr. Pistner
to an "office of the chairman."</p>
<p>Sara Lee dipped 1/8 to 26 7/8 on 1.2 million shares.
Merrill Lynch lowered its short-term investment rating on the
stock to "neutral" from "above average," based on earnings
weakness in its food operations.</p>
<p>Coca-Cola rose 1/2 to 76 3/4, and PepsiCo dropped 1/2 to
65 3/4. Burger King, which is believed to be one of Pepsi's
largest domestic customers, said it is switching to Coca-Cola
as its soft-drink supplier in its U.S. restaurants.</p>
<p>Symbol Technologies slipped 5/8 to 8. The company said its
first-quarter net income plunged 95% from the year-earlier
level to $266,000, or one cent a share.</p>
<p>Huntway Partners skidded 2 to 5 7/8 after reporting a
first-quarter loss of $2.6 million and disclosing that it may
be unable to make any distributions to unitholders this year.
Genrad, which also posted a loss for the quarter, fell 1/2 to
4 1/8.</p>
<p>MGM/UA Communications lost 1 1/8 to 17 1/2 after granting
Pathe Communications a one-week extension on the third of
four payments of $50 million each, which Pathe is making as
part of its $1.27 billion acquisition of the company.</p>
<p>Centel rose 1 1/2 to 31 1/2. Smith Barney raised the
stock's investment rating to "buy" from "hold," noting that
it had fallen to a 50% discount to the firm's estimated asset
value of $60 a share.</p>
<p>The American Stock Exchange Market Value Index added 0.22
to 343.32. Volume totaled 10,640,000 shares compared with
9,220,000 Monday.</p>
<p>Echo Bay Mines fell 1/8 to 13 7/8. The company said it had
decided against proceeding with a plan to swap its stake in
Muscocho Group for an interest in two Muscocho gold mines. As
a result, Echo Bay said, its first-quarter results would
include a $42.4 million write-down of its holdings in the
company.</p>
<p>Air Express International rose 1 1/2 to 16 1/2. Morgan
Stanley boosted its rating on the stock to "buy" from "hold"
and raised its 1990 earnings estimate by 15 cents a share to
$1.90.</p>
