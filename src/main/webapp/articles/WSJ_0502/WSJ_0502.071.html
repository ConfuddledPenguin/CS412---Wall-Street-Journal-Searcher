	<p class="article-leader">Two makers of high-performance hard-disk drives reported
strong earnings gains in the fiscal fourth quarter ended
March 31, reflecting strong demand from makers of personal
computers, workstations and computer networks.
   Quantum Corp., based in Milpitas, Calif., said net income
rose 86% to $12.8 million, or 46 cents a share, from $6.9
million, or 27 cents a share, a year earlier. Sales rose 67%
to $129.8 million from $77.7 million. A competitor, Maxtor
Corp., based in San Jose, Calif., said net jumped more than
fourfold to $6.5 million, or 30 cents a share, from $1.4
million, or seven cents a share, a year earlier. Sales
climbed 45% to $141.6 million from $97.7 million.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Both companies reported strong gains in sales of new 3
1/2-inch disk products, earnings from certain discontinued
products and continued strong demand for older products from
computer makers. Quantum also announced that its board
approved a plan to buy back up to three million shares of its
common stock in the open market.</p>
<p>Quantum reported fiscal 1990 earnings of $47.2 million, or
$1.71 a share, up nearly fourfold from $12.9 million, or 45
cents a share, in fiscal 1989. Sales more than doubled to
$446.3 million from $208 million. For the fiscal year, Maxtor
reported net of $18.9 million, or 90 cents a share, more than
three times the $5.2 million, or 26 cents a share, earned in
fiscal 1989. Sales rose 40% to $491.1 million from $351
million.</p>
