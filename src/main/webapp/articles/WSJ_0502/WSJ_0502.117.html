	<p class="article-leader">Braniff Inc., operating under bankruptcy-court protection,
said it agreed to sell rights to buy as many as 74 Airbus
Industrie A320 jets for $50 million to Airbus.
   Airbus, a European aircraft consortium, is essentially
buying back the rights to its own planes.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Also, Airbus is waiving $32 million in bills that Braniff
owes it for spare parts. As part of the agreement, Braniff
will be returning the spare parts to Airbus.</p>
<p>Braniff, which has been grounded since last fall, said the
purchase is subject to higher and better offers, as well as
approval by the federal bankruptcy court in Orlando, Fla.,
where Braniff is based.</p>
<p>The company said it has until July 26 to market the
short-range A320 contract rights and the spare parts. It said
that, among other things, competing offers must be at least
10% higher than the Airbus offer.</p>
