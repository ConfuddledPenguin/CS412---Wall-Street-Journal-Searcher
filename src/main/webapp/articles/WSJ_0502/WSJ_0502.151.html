	<p class="article-leader">ROCKY HILL, Conn -- Ames Department Stores Inc., which
filed for protection from its creditors under Chapter 11 of
the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, may be short on cash. But it's
proving generous to Stephen Pistner, its new co-chairman and
chief executive officer.
   Yesterday, Ames received approval from a U.S. bankruptcy
court judge in Manhattan to pay Mr. Pistner more than $2
million for the first year of his services. That includes a
signing bonus of $500,000 to be paid over the first six
months and an annual salary of $1.5 million. In addition Mr.
Pistner gets reimbursed for travel, legal and other
incidental expenses.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Creditors, many of whom were in the court, apparently
approved of the new leader's salary. "If he's the right man,
so be it," commented Wilbur Ross, a senior managing director
for Rothschild's Inc., financial adviser to a number of bond
holders and creditors. "The task at hand is great and for a
job well done that would be small price to pay."</p>
<p>Mr. Pistner's appointment was approved at least on a
temporary basis by the bankruptcy court. The action enables
Mr. Pistner to serve in the two positions and hold
discussions with the retailer's creditors through May 19.
Though yesterday's approval is only temporary, court
observers said that a permanent approval is likely to follow.</p>
