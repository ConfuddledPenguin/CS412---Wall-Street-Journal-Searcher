	<p class="article-leader">American Express Co. plans to extend its "Portraits" print
ad campaign featuring celebrity card holders to a number of
European countries.
   Like the U.S. campaign that features American celebrities
such as Ella Fitzgerald and Neil Simon, the European ads will
be tailored to spotlight famous personalities of particular
countries. An ad for Germany, for example, features Alfred
Biolek, a prominent journalist and talk-show host there.
"American Express Mitglied seit {card member since} 1980,"
the ad says.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>American Express is rolling out the campaign in Europe as
part of a broader effort to beef up its card holder ranks
overseas. "All of our efforts are aimed at building an
upscale position with the people in the market," says Rick
Thoman, president and chief executive officer at American
Express International. "Our goal is to own the upscale
franchises."</p>
<p>But in its bid to build the business outside the U.S.,
American Express faces a formidable challenge. The concept of
credit is still a relatively foreign idea to many Europeans.
Though Americans spend well over 10% of their income with
credit cards, many Europeans live in countries where
consumers spend only 2% or 3% of their incomes with charge
cards. Italians spend just 1.5% of their incomes with charge
cards, the lowest percentage in Western Europe.</p>
<p>"Cash is the enemy," admits Mr. Thoman. But he says
attitudes overseas toward credit are changing. American
Express estimates world-wide spending on plastic will balloon
to about $3.5 trillion a year over the next decade from $800
million, with the bulk of that increase coming overseas.</p>
<p>American Express hopes the customized "Portraits" ads,
along with targeted television campaigns, will encourage
Europeans to apply for its card. The company has raised ad
spending overseas significantly, and Mr. Thoman says spending
outside the U.S. now accounts for about 40% to 45% of its
total ad budget, up from only 15% a few years ago. According
to Advertising Age, American Express spent a total of $247.2
million on advertising in 1988.</p>
<p>In the U.S., creative teams at Ogilvy & Mather, a unit of
WPP Group, work with American Express executives to develop
"wish lists" of celebrities they would like to feature in the
campaign. Mr. Thoman says Ogilvy teams in foreign countries
are working much the same way, identifying candidates in
sports, entertainment and politics.</p>
<p>American Express won't name all of the European
celebrities that have been chosen for the campaign. It says,
however, that the campaign for France will include Michel
Serrault, a French actor, and Christian LaCroix, the clothing
designer. The campaign in Germany, which has just begun
running, includes portraits of Alwin Schockemoehle, an
equestrian gold medalist, and Bernhard Langer, a German
golfer.</p>
<p>Although the U.S. campaign has succeeded in large part
because it appeals to Americans' thirst for pictures of the
famous, American Express and Ogilvy say the interest isn't
only an American phenomenon.</p>
<p>"We've found that the campaign has an ability to translate
fairly immediately almost anywhere," says Gordon Bowen,
senior vice president and creative director at Ogilvy.</p>
<p>All the photos in the international campaign, like those
in the U.S., were shot by Annie Leibovitz, a celebrity
photographer. American Express says the introduction of the
campaign in some instances has been delayed because of Ms.
Leibovitz's schedule. The firm says it decided that using a
separate photographer overseas would disrupt the continuity
of the campaign.</p>
<p>Ms. Leibovitz just finished shooting in France, and other
photo sessions are on deck for Italy, Spain, Belgium and
Switzerland, among others. The campaign is already running in
the Far East and Asia.</p>
<p>Although most stars in the campaigns for countries outside
of the U.S. won't be recognized by Americans, some of the ads
will run in more than one country. "There are a number of
portraits that have relevance across a number of markets,"
Mr. Thoman says. A portrait featuring classical musician Yo
Yo Ma, which was originally created for the U.S., recently
ran in Hong Kong.</p>

<p>Breene Is Leaving</p>
<p>Tim Breene, chief executive officer of Della Femina
McNamee WCRS's parent company, is stepping down as a result
of the company's elimination of its London co-headquarters.</p>
<p>The parent company, Eurocom WCRS Della Femina Ball, had
split its headquarters between London and Paris, but will
consolidate in Paris. Eurocom WCRS, which itself is 60%-owned
by France's Eurocom ad agency, was formed last year when
London-based WCRS sold its advertising business to Eurocom.</p>
<p>Mr. Breene had been deputy chairman of WCRS. He will stay
on briefly as a consultant to help with the transition and to
develop below-the-line, nonadvertising marketing services,
said Louise McNamee, president of Della Femina McNamee.</p>
<p>Mr. Breene will be succeeded by Pierre DePlais, who will
also remain chief operating officer of Eurocom in Paris.
Working with Mr. DePlais will be Jean de Yturbe, who had been
chief executive of ad agency HDM's European operations.</p>
