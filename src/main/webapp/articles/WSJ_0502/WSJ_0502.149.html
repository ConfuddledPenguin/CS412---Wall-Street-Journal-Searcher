	<p class="article-leader">HIGHLAND PARK, Mich. -- Despite sharp production cuts and
slumping sales, Chrysler Corp. rode cost-cutting savings and
financial-services gains to first-quarter profit that
surpassed many analysts' expectations.
   The No. 3-ranked U.S. auto maker reported first-quarter
net income plunged 80% to $71 million, or 32 cents a share,
from $351 million, or $1.50 a share, a year earlier.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Most analysts had expected Chrysler would only break even
in the quarter because slow sales and plant idlings sliced
January production by 41%. Investors reacted to the news by
bidding up Chrysler's stock 75 cents a share to $15.25, on
volume of 1.2 million shares, in composite trading on the New
York Stock Exchange.</p>
<p>Chrysler said it eked out a puny $8 million pretax and $5
million after-tax earnings from its automotive operations in
the quarter, despite weak output. The reason: Cost-cutting
measures slashed expenses about $200 million. That was
greater than anticipated under the company's previously
announced $1.5 billion cost-cutting program.</p>
<p>"We were virtually out of business in January with shut
factories and everybody writing rebate checks," said Robert
S. Miller Jr., Chrysler's executive vice president and chief
financial officer. "It was awful, but we think it's
significant that we could get back in the black even though
our factory vehicle sales were so much lower." Chrysler said
its world-wide factory unit sales dropped 26% to 493,612
vehicles in the first period.</p>
<p>The bulk of Chrysler's profit came from its Chrysler
Financial Corp. subsidiary, which had record first-quarter
earnings of $89 million compared with $65 million the year
earlier.</p>
<p>Mr. Miller attributed Chrysler Financial's improvement to
growing auto-loan volume and continued gains by the unit's
commercial and consumer-lending operations. Because of
Chrysler Financial's preferred stock and its lower tax rate,
about $23 million of its earnings aren't passed along to the
parent.</p>
<p>Wall Street's positive reaction to Chrysler's earnings
news broke a two-week slide that saw the auto maker's share
price fall 13%, or $2.25, to wind up at $14.50 a share
Monday. Since Jan. 1, Chrysler's stock value has fallen 23%.
Analysts blamed the drop on fears that Chrysler might cut its
dividend as a result of its weakened condition and the U.S.
car market's decline.</p>
<p>Chrysler's market problems are far from over. The
company's U.S. car and light truck sales continued to sag in
April, and some of its core products, including the Jeep
Cherokee sport utility vehicle and the popular minivans, are
under increasing competitive and pricing pressure.</p>
<p>But investors' worst fears apparently were eased by the
first-quarter earnings, which demonstrated that the company
is able to return a profit, albeit marginal, despite sharply
reduced sales volume. Some analysts said they now plan to
boost their estimates of Chrysler's full-year earnings.</p>
<p>Ronald A. Glantz, an analyst with Dean Witter Reynolds,
raised his 1990 Chrysler estimate to $1.50 a share from $1.
Wendy Needham, an analyst with Smith Barney, Harris Upham &
Co., said the benefits of Chrysler's cost-cutting program led
her to increase her 1990 estimate to $1.65 a share from $1.10
and her 1991 estimate to $3.75 to $2 a share.</p>
<p>"Everyone was surprised that Chrysler says it made profits
with auto operations," Ms. Needham said. "Anyone who says
they weren't surprised is lying."</p>
