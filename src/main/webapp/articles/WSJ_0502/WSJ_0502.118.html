and institutes to 16 from 18.</p>

execute daily monetary operations in a comprehensive manner.
A Bank Relations division and Capital Markets division will
oversee activities of financial institutions at home and
abroad.</p>
<p>A Financial and Payment System Department will be
established to cope with the increased risks to the financial
