	<p class="article-leader">For the first time, a Japanese auto maker has taken a page
from Detroit's marketing book by aligning itself with a U.S.
car-rental company.
   Mitsubishi Motors Corp., whose U.S. sales are growing
rapidly despite its lack of a distinct image, agreed to buy a
majority stake in Value Rent-a-Car Inc. of Deerfield Beach,
Fla. Terms of the transaction weren't disclosed, but Value's
management will retain a minority interest in the company and
continue to run it.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Value's fleet of up to 20,000 cars pales next to that of
industry leader Hertz Corp., which has about 150,000 cars in
the U.S. But Mitsubishi's move is significant because it
locks in a source of rental-fleet sales at a time when most
major car-rental companies are affiliated with one of
Detroit's auto makers.</p>
<p>"The big reasons for doing this are sales volume and
exposure to consumers," says Richard S. Recchia, who heads
Mitsubishi's U.S. sales arm. "We provide only 10% of Value's
fleet now, but that will go up to 85% in the near future."
Mitsubishi may, however, reduce its sales to other rental
companies, Mr. Recchia adds.</p>
<p>By using Value as a mostly captive customer, Mitsubishi
will be following the lead of Detroit's Big Three auto
makers. They have consolidated control of the nation's major
rental companies in recent years by lending them money,
investing in them or buying them outright.</p>
<p>Ford Motor Co. has poured cash into Hertz and Budget Rent
A Car Corp. General Motors Corp. has done the same with Avis
Inc. and National Car Rental System Inc. Chrysler Corp. owns
Thrifty Rent-A-Car System Inc. and Snappy Car Rental Inc.</p>
<p>It isn't clear whether other Japanese auto makers will
follow Mitsubishi's lead. Toyota Motor Corp. has considered
buying a rental company and scouted possible candidates, but
hasn't found any to its liking. The major Japanese companies
have strong brand images in the U.S., and thus don't need
additional consumer exposure as much as Mitsubishi does.</p>
<p>In Mitsubishi's case, controlling a rental fleet should
help the company's expansion plans in the U.S. Value rents
cars in Sun Belt cities to vacationers and tourists who --
unlike business people -- rent cars for a week or more at a
time. Mitsubishi views the rentals as extended test drives
and hopes they will help to overcome the brand's problem: low
consumer awareness in a crowded car market.</p>
<p>"We're suffering from that," acknowledges Mr. Recchia.
"The fact is that we started in the U.S. 20 years later than
Honda and Toyota did. Having Value Rent-a-car will help."</p>
<p>Some of the smaller Japanese car companies have been
struggling in the U.S., but Mitsubishi is an exception.
Overall U.S. car and truck sales dropped slightly in the
first quarter, but Mitsubishi's sales jumped 90%.</p>
<p>The company hopes to sell more than 200,000 vehicles in
the U.S. this year. That would be less than three month's
work for Toyota Motor Corp., but it still would represent a
big jump from the 150,000 vehicles that Mitsubishi sold last
year.</p>
<p>Some of the increase reflects a loosening of Mitsubishi's
longtime ties to Chrysler. Mitsubishi didn't sell cars under
its own name in the U.S. until 1983. Instead, it sold them
through Chrysler; they included such models as the Dodge Colt
and Plymouth Vista. In 1988, Chrysler sold nearly 190,000
Mitsubishi-made vehicles as Chrysler products.</p>
<p>But last year that number dropped to 140,000 cars and
trucks, and this year it may fall below 100,000. As the U.S.
car market has softened, Chrysler has concentrated on selling
vehicles that it makes itself to shore up its flagging
production schedules.</p>
<p>This has opened the door for Mitsubishi to boost its sales
under its own brand. Mitsubishi, like all Japanese car
makers, has a quota on its vehicle shipments to the U.S.
Every Mitsubishi car that Chrysler doesn't take is one more
that Mitsubishi can try to sell on its own -- which it's
doing, much to Chrysler's chagrin.</p>
<p>What's more, Mitsubishi now has its own production base in
the U.S.: the Diamond-Star Motors plant in Illinois, a joint
venture with Chrysler, which opened in 1988. The plant makes
the Mitsubishi Eclipse, a sporty subcompact that's been a big
hit for the company. (Nearly identical models are sold by
Chrysler as the Plymouth Laser and Eagle Talon.)</p>
<p>All this is providing Mitsubishi with enough cars to
sharply expand its U.S. dealership network. The company now
has 430 U.S. dealers, up from 246 in January 1989.
"Mitsubishi has dramatically increased its number of dealers
in the U.S.," says Christopher Cedergren of J.D. Power &
Associates, an auto-consulting firm. "Also helping is an
aggressive product strategy."</p>
<p>This fall, Mitsubishi will introduce the 3000GT, a $31,000
high-tech sports car designed to build the company's image
and compete with the Nissan 300ZX and Porsche 911. And next
spring, the company will launch a new version of the Montero
(its Jeep-like vehicle), two new minivans and a new Sigma, a
near-luxury sedan that sells for close to $20,000. The
company will spend some $100 million on advertising this
year, up 30% from last year, when it began using network
television for the first time.</p>
<p>Despite all this, Mitsubishi isn't aiming to join the
front rank of Japanese car companies in the U.S. Even if
Mitsubishi hits its goal of selling 300,000 vehicles a year
in the U.S. by 1993, it will still trail Mazda Motor Corp.,
which sold nearly 342,000 vehicles to Americans last year.</p>
<p>"You have to be realistic," says Mr. Recchia. "Right now,
the competition in each market segment is pretty intense.
Some awfully good products are out there."</p>
