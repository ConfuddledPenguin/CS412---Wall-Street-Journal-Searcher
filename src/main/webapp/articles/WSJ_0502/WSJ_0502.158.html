	<p class="article-leader">MONTREAL -- Domtar Inc. halved its quarterly dividend to
6.25 Canadian cents (5.37 cents U.S.) and reported a
first-quarter loss from continuing operations.
   The reduced dividend is payable June 15 to stock of record
May 15.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"I would be less than honest if I said I exude confidence"
about Domtar's short-term prospects, James Smith, chairman,
president and chief executive officer, said after the annual
meeting.</p>
<p>"We don't really see any signs of a near-term turnaround"
in the company's paper and building-products markets, Mr.
Smith said, adding that Domtar wouldn't "be unhappy" with a
break-even second quarter.</p>
<p>Montreal-based Domtar reported a first-quarter loss from
continuing operations of C$10 million, or 15 Canadian cents a
share, compared with profit from continuing operations of
C$20 million, or 19 Canadian cents a share, a year earlier.
Sales fell to C$611 million from C$623 million a year
earlier.</p>
<p>Net income in the latest period was C$20 million, or 19
Canadian cents a share, including a C$23 million after-tax
gain from the sale of most of Domtar's salt business. A year
ago, net was C$26 million, or 26 Canadian cents a share.</p>
<p>Investors "shouldn't have been surprised" by the dividend
cut, said Raymond Kilroy, an analyst with Nesbitt Thomson
Deacon Inc. Mr. Kilroy said Domtar "will have to struggle" to
post a profit for the full year.</p>
<p>Domtar is the third major Canadian forest-products concern
to cut its dividend in recent months. Last December,
Abitibi-Price Inc. halved its quarterly dividend to 12.5
Canadian cents. Two weeks ago, Canadian Pacific Forest
Products Ltd. slashed its quarterly payout 69% to 20 Canadian
cents.</p>
<p>Yesterday, in New York Stock Exchange composite trading,
Domtar closed at $10.25, off 25 cents.</p>
