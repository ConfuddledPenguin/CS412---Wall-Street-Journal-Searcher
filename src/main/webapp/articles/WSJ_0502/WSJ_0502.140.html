	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- Hill & Knowlton, whose Washington office
last month disclosed plans to wage an anti-abortion campaign
on behalf of the nation's Roman Catholic bishops, is
generating new controversy over another client: the
government of Turkey.
   In a letter to Hill & Knowlton Chairman Robert Gray,
Armenian Assembly of America accused the New York-based
public relations firm of seeking to "censor" U.S. schoolbooks
regarding the 1915 mass deaths of Christian Armenians in
Turkey. Armenian Assembly labels the 1915 events as genocide.
Estimates of those killed range from several hundred thousand
to more than one million.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Under an agreement signed last June by representatives of
Hill & Knowlton and the Turkish embassy, the firm agreed to
help "rectify substantial factual errors about contemporary
Turkey and Turkish history contained in secondary-school
social science textbooks."</p>
<p>Tacan Ilam, press consulate for the Turkish embassy, said
Hill & Knowlton wasn't asked to promote any particular
interpretation of the 1915 events in U.S. schoolbooks. He
said the Turkish embassy was responding to a number of
factual errors about Turkey in U.S. textbooks, none of them
involving the Armenian deaths. Hill & Knowlton hasn't yet
recommended specific changes in textbook language, according
to its senior vice president, Chuck Pucie, but he added that
"is not to say we would not do so."</p>
