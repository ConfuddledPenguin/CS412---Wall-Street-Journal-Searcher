	<p class="article-leader">On Sept. 8, 1985, the aspiring artist Ana Mendieta
plummeted to her death from the 34th-floor Greenwich Village
apartment she shared with the moderately famous minimalist
sculptor Carl Andre. Andre subsequently told police that his
mildly inebriated wife, a Cuban-American, was depressed about
not being as moderately famous as he, and leapt. The police
did not bite. Circumstantial evidence was sufficiently strong
to indict Andre for second-degree murder, but not
sufficiently strong to put him in the slammer, where people
who have spent their adult lives arranging hundreds of bricks
or bales of hay in fascinating patterns on museum floors do
not win friends as easily as in lower Manhattan.
   To this day, no one knows what happened up on the 34th
floor in the moments before Mendieta's death, but this has
not prevented Robert Katz from writing a 456-page book about
it. In fairness to Mr. Katz, "Naked by the Window" (Atlantic
Monthly Press, $19.95) must have been a tough assignment.
With Mendieta dead and Andre unwilling to be interviewed, Mr.
Katz had to reconstruct the story by talking to 200 friends
or relatives of the artists. He didn't get much out of them.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>By the end of the book, Mr. Katz cannot conceal his
chagrin at the art world's circle-the-wagons mentality, at
the reluctance of New York's artistic community to bare its
soul to an outsider. Since a typical Katz sentence reads, "He
believed in the culture of art as a cathedral in which one
might find communion with the essence of one's times," the
artists probably were smart to clam up.</p>
<p>The author has arranged the story in such a way that the
reader starts off assuming that Andre is guilty of his wife's
murder -- because of the artist's oddly phrased 9-1-1 call
reporting his wife's fall, because of a suspicious scratch on
his nose, because Mendieta was afraid of heights, and
because, at 4 foot 10 inches tall, the rising 36-year-old
artist was too short to have accidentally fallen out of the
window, not with 73% of her body below the sill.</p>
<p>But despite Mr. Katz's potboiling efforts to make the
verdict seem in doubt, it becomes apparent that Andre could
never be convicted on evidence as inconclusive as this,
particularly not when there were so many people willing to
attest to his worth as an artist and as a human being, and to
lend him big bucks to hire a hotshot lawyer (there was no way
the court was going to accept 183 bales of hay as bond
collateral, no matter how ingeniously they were arranged).</p>
<p>This is not Mr. Katz's only problem. Although Andre is an
artist very familiar to a knowing but tiny elite, he is not
Andy Warhol (or even Jasper Johns). That's largely why the
scandal, after an initial flurry, attracted so little
interest. Andre was a star, but not of the first magnitude,
and Mendieta was not a star at all.</p>
<p>To make matters worse, the trial was completely
overshadowed by two other New York scandals: Robert
Chambers's strangling of fellow preppy Jennifer Levin in
Central Park, and art dealer Andrew Crispo's alleged crossing
of the line from Saturday-night sadomasochism to the
fullblown torture of one man and the death of another.</p>
<p>Mr. Katz intermittently throws out the suggestion that
Mendieta's Hispanic origins may have had something to do with
this lack of press interest, but in truth the exiled daughter
of anti-Castro Cubans, the girl who had grown up in an Iowa
orphanage, never truly belonged to the Hispanic community
north of 96th Street; she was a denizen of the artsy-craftsy
barrio south of 14th. The ethnic angle does not ring true.</p>
<p>The feminist angle does -- or should. Had Mendieta not
been a short, obscure female artist, Mr. Katz seems to argue,
and had Andre not been an established male fixture on the art
scene, more of a stink might have been raised by his
acquittal. But even here Mr. Katz ran into problems, for, to
his amazement, plenty of women were ready to go to bat for
Andre, and the feminist community never really got its dander
up.</p>
<p>The book purports to be a voyage inside the SoHo artburb,
but it falls short here as well. As Tom Wolfe demonstrated to
great comic effect but little practical result in "The
Painted Word," modern artists are sitting ducks for satire.
That's because this is a society that condemns painters who
earn millions from their worthless pieces of paper, but
idolizes leveraged buyout specialists who earn billions from
their worthless pieces of paper. If you're a halfway decent
writer -- which Mr. Katz is -- and you want to make
20th-century artists look stupid, you won't have much trouble
doing it, but to the credit of contemporary artists most of
them don't seem to care.</p>
<p>So Mr. Katz's backhanded slaps at SoHo bohos don't work
any better than the rest of his story. Shifting back and
forth between hardboiled true-detective patter and windy
pseudo-psychologizing, Mr. Katz acts as if hundreds of pages
of mildly interesting biographical details will make "Naked
by the Window" into a big book. It isn't big; it's just
large. But there is a good book to be written on this
subject, and here's hoping some woman writes it.</p>
