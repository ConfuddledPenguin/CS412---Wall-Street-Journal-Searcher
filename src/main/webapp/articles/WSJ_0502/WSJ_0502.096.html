	<p class="article-leader">TOKYO -- Vigorous domestic demand and eased restrictions
combined to push Japan's 1989 food imports up to $32.6
billion, a 5.4% rise from a year earlier, the Japan External
Trade Organization, a quasi-governmental promotion agency,
said.
   The increase was in line with an upward trend that began
at least five years ago. Though the yen declined in foreign
exchange markets, especially in the 1989 second half, and
made imports more expensive, robust domestic demand such as
personal consumption and less stringent regulations resulted
in the food import rise.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Shrimp imports again topped the list, totaling $2.59
billion, followed by corn, $2.26 billion; beef, $1.65
billion; and pork, $1.63 billion. Imports of processed foods,
including alcoholic beverages such as whisky and brandy, also
showed conspicuous gains as a result of changes in the
country's liquor taxes.</p>
<p>Food imports from the U.S. totaled a record $10.27
billion, exceeding the $10 billion level for the first time,
from $9.7 billion a year earlier. The U.S. accounted for 32%
of Japan's overall food imports last year. Beef imports from
the U.S. jumped 38% to $880 million, and accounted for 53% of
Japan's total 1989 beef imports.</p>
