	<p class="article-leader">Ferranti International PLC will take "very substantial"
write-offs this year, said Chairman Eugene Anderson.
   He said at the company's extraordinary general meeting in
London that the majority of the write-offs will have "no
immediate cash-flow implications but will, when combined with
the extraordinary gains which have been achieved in recent
sales of assets, more accurately reflect company assets and
liabilities."</p>

and defense equipment maker last year wrote off about #185
million ($303.5 million) and arranged special, short-term
