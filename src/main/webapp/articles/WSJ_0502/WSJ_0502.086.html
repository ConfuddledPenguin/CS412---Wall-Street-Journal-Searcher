	<p class="article-leader">ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. -- Florida Federal Savings Bank was
convicted by a federal jury of falsifying statements in
connection with government-backed student loans.
   In early 1988, Florida Federal came under scrutiny for
allegedly filing as many as 17,000 fraudulent insurance
claims on $35 million dollars in student loans. The
investigation helped trigger a management shake-up that
included the resignation of Florida Federal's chairman.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The federal jury in Tampa found the company guilty of 43
counts of falsifying statements between November 1986 and
July 1987. Sentencing is set for June 27. Florida Federal
faces a possible fine of $21.5 million and restitution of $18
million.</p>
<p>Two former officers of the company -- Robert O. Harmas, 42
years old, of Noblesville, Ind.; and James J. LaMantia, 59,
of Largo, Fla. -- were also convicted of falsifying
statements. Neither could be reached for comment.</p>
<p>The thrift's chief executive officer, John W. Sapanski,
said in a prepared statement: "We are disappointed in the
verdict. However, resolution of the student loan problem has
always been the new management's primary objective, so that
we can proceed with implementing a plan to meet {federal}
capital requirements. The conclusion of the trial and the
sentencing will represent significant steps toward resolution
of the problem."</p>
