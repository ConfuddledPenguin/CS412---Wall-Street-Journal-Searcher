	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- The Senate approved a $3.3 billion fiscal
1990 spending bill providing $720 million in increased aid
for Panama and Nicaragua, and warning the Soviet Union that
any new trade agreements would be jeopardized unless
accommodations are made on Lithuania.
   The Lithuania amendment, adopted 73-24, was orchestrated
by Republican conservatives in an apparent bid to stiffen the
Bush administration's stance toward Moscow, but critics
argued the measure was a gratuitous slap restating the
politically obvious. "The timing is terrible, but the
substance is reality," said one Democrat.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Despite its opposition, the White House was left to watch
as even Republican Leader Robert Dole of Kansas joined in the
vote for passage.</p>
<p>The action came as Secretary of State James Baker signaled
an increased willingness to bridge the administration's
differences with Congress over conditions on military aid to
El Salvador. The murder of Jesuit priests last year has
angered liberals in both houses, and House Democrats have
linked the El Salvador question to final release of the
pending funds for Panama and Nicaragua.</p>
<p>In private House and Senate meetings, Mr. Baker appeared
willing to accept some conditions, and though he hopes to
push the issue into fiscal 1991, his tone encouraged hopes of
a settlement on the emotional issue.</p>
<p>The spending bill, approved by a simple voice vote, goes
next to a House-Senate conference. There, despite agreement
on major foreign-aid provisions, negotiators face scores of
differences over smaller but nettlesome appropriations.</p>
<p>Within Pentagon accounts, the Senate went substantially
further than the House in reallocating funds. As adopted last
night, the bill calls for an estimated $2.86 billion in
reductions and transfers from defense to help stay within
budget ceilings for the year ending Sept. 30.</p>
<p>Among domestic accounts, increases are provided for food
stamps and child vaccine and education programs, as well as
conducting the current census. Apart from the Central America
package, $400 million in loan guarantees are provided to help
house Soviet Jews in Israel. The bill also frees up an
estimated $363 million in prior appropriations for the State
Department, including U.S. contributions to the United
Nations and the World Health Organization.</p>
<p>The complexity of the bill surpasses that of comparable
supplemental spending measures in recent years, and the
Senate floor debate was a testing ground for the rules of
procedure set by the Gramm-Rudman deficit law. Points of
order, established under the law, are intended primarily to
protect against excessive spending. But the maneuvering this
week showed how they can be used to freeze priorities and
gain leverage regardless of the deficit impact.</p>
<p>For example, Democrats appeared near success at one point
with an amendment calling for a $30 million cut from foreign
aid to help pay for accelerated investigations by the Justice
Department into the savings-and-loan scandal. The proposal,
by Sen. Timothy Wirth (D., Colo.), had no adverse impact on
the deficit, but the administration's allies nonetheless
prevailed by invoking a Gramm-Rudman rule requiring 60 votes
to waive.</p>
<p>Gramm-Rudman rules were again a factor in a proposal to
paper over the short-term deficit impact of billions of
dollars in working capital needed by the Resolution Trust
Corp., the agency that merges and sells insolvent thrifts.
But here the law ran up against one of its crusty
co-sponsors, Sen. Ernest Hollings. The South Carolina
Democrat raised his own parliamentary point of order against
the planned change, and proponents were forced to back away
despite the support of the White House budget office.</p>
<p>The defeat could prove significant in budget negotiations
this year because analysts estimate RTC borrowing could add
more than $30 billion to the projected deficit under
Gramm-Rudman in fiscal 1991. Already the corporation has been
authorized to borrow as much as $45.3 billion in the current
quarter. The money is intended to help manage the assets of
failed savings and loans before they are sold or merged.</p>
<p>The proposed amendment sought to change Gramm-Rudman
conventions to exclude the ebb and flow of RTC working
capital from deficit calculations. But critics have
challenged the premise that the money will be eventually
restored as assets are sold. "This is a good opportunity for
our distinguished Senate to sober up," said Mr. Hollings,
and, in his best Southern drawl, he mocked the solution as
"artfully not artificially" drawn. Sen. Pete Domenici (R.,
N.M.), who was Budget Committee chairman when Gramm-Rudman
was first written, protested but admitted too, "If we'd have
known about these ins and outs when we designed Gramm-Rudman,
I think we would have fixed it."</p>
<p>The Central America package, promising $420 million for
Panama and $300 million for Nicaragua, remains the
centerpiece for the administration but also a magnet for
special interest amendments by influential members. Munitions
plants in Louisiana and Mississippi are preserved despite
Pentagon objections. Favored domestic appropriations run from
compensation for sugar growers to a new fish laboratory in
Arkansas.</p>
