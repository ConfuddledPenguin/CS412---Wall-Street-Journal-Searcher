	<p class="article-leader">Charles M. Leighton acquires companies more often than
most entrepreneurs buy cars. In 20 years, he has purchased 16
companies that make everything from sailboats to
do-it-yourself clock kits.
   He has tried to assemble a group of companies that cater
to well-off consumers who play as hard as they work. But in
the course of his shopping spree, Mr. Leighton learned what
can go wrong when an entrepreneur expands through
acquisitions.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Most of the acquisitions haven't worked out. Mr.
Leighton's company, CML Group Inc., Acton, Mass., has shed
all but four of the 16 concerns. It sold some at huge losses.
Others fetched less than Mr. Leighton planned when the buyers
couldn't come up with all the money. Even promising companies
kept by Mr. Leighton have cost him dearly. Last year, for
instance, CML had to buy out the contract of a unit's two
founders who were getting unexpectedly huge bonuses
approaching a total of $10 million a year.</p>
<p>The buying binge saddled CML with debt -- its $115.8
million in long-term liabilities dwarfs its $4.4 million in
tangible equity -- and deficits. The company reported a loss
of $31.9 million on sales of $234.6 million in its fiscal
year ended July 31, 1989, and a loss of $1,850,000 on sales
$159.9 million in the six months ended Jan. 27.</p>
<p>Problems with acquisitions have attracted Minneapolis
investor Irwin Jacobs, who owns 14.8% of CML's stock but
thinks it is undervalued. He has tried since November to buy
the company. Last month, he called off an attempt to oust
CML's board after Mr. Leighton assured him the company's
performance would improve.</p>
<p>"We've learned from our mistakes, and our record is not a
bad one," says Mr. Leighton, CML's 54-year-old chairman.
"We're finally starting to produce what we've been trying to
do for the last 20 years."</p>
<p>Mr. Leighton means he believes CML at last has in place a
winning combination of acquisitions, such as P.S.I.
NordicTrack Inc., a Chaska, Minn., maker of
cross-country-skiing exercise machines. America's
health-consciousness helped increase annual sales to $74.4
million in fiscal 1989 from $14.2 million in 1986, when CML
bought it. Nature Co., a Berkeley, Calif., retailer of gifts
for nature lovers, is prospering from growing attention to
the environment. Annual sales since CML bought it in 1983
soared tenfold to $50.6 million.</p>
<p>Overall, Mr. Leighton projects CML's earnings from
continuing operations during the fiscal year ending July 31,
1990, will grow to at least $12.8 million from a loss on
continuing operations of $5.5 million a year earlier.</p>
<p>Some analysts, however, still wonder if the company has
turned the corner. Says Adams, Harkness & Hill's Harry Wells
III, "CML has always been a story that's about to get
better."</p>
<p>Mr. Leighton, together with President G. Robert Todd,
still owns 9.6% of the company, which the two founded in
1969. Less than a year later, Mr. Leighton purchased Boston
Whaler Inc., a Rockland, Mass., powerboat builder, and
Carroll Reed Inc., a Portland, Maine, apparel retailer. Mr.
Leighton bought a third company in 1970 and, by the end of
1973, had added five more, including Ericson Yachts Inc.,
Irvine, Calif. In a second wave of acquisitions beginning in
1979, CML picked up eight more companies.</p>
<p>But by 1985, 16 acquisitions later, Mr. Leighton began
selling companies even faster than he had bought them. Some
small apparel retailers ran into competition from big
national firms, says CML Vice President Michael Wilder. As
for companies making clothing, camping products and other
goods, Mr. Leighton failed to get them enough shelf space in
stores. "Charlie decided fighting your way into the retail
distribution network was just too damn hard," Mr. Wilder
says.</p>
<p>Even though Mr. Leighton in the past six years alone has
sold 10 of the 16 companies he acquired, analysts say he
waited too long to unload some of them. By the time CML sold
Boston Whaler, the venerable and once immensely profitable
manufacturer was losing $3 million a year. Reebok
International, which acquired the boat builder, originally
planned to spend $42 million. It ended up paying only $29.8
million, plus possibly $3 million more in contingency
payments, when it completed the deal last October.</p>
<p>"We get very emotionally attached to these companies," Mr.
Leighton concedes. "We're not in the business to buy and sell
them. Because we are so involved, we have a tendency to wait
longer than just a numbers guy. Plus, can you attract the
next company if they think you're just going to get rid of
them" when times get bad?</p>
<p>Such allegiance to owners may have cost Mr. Leighton in
other ways as well. He chose at times to sell companies back
to management rather than outsiders, as long as the managers'
offer was competitive. Now, though, some former associates
can't come up with all the money to pay Mr. Leighton's price.
In the 1989 fiscal year, CML wrote off $1.6 million of notes
it took from the buyers of Ericson Yachts and other
companies. It also set aside another $3 million to cover
future bad debts.</p>
<p>In addition, Mr. Leighton paid more than expected for
companies he still owns. CML usually wooed companies it
acquired with promises to keep the owners and managers, give
them financial incentives to expand the business quickly and
profitably and allow them plenty of freedom to do so.
Sometimes the arrangement worked too well.</p>
<p>When CML bought NordicTrack, Mr. Leighton agreed to share
the company's income through July 1991 with founders Ed and
Florence Pauls. By 1989, NordicTrack had become the most
profitable company CML owned, with an estimated operating
profit of $28 million that fiscal year, according to Dan
Wewer, an analyst at Robinson-Humphrey Co. in Atlanta. The
Pauls, as a result, were raking in huge and rapidly rising
bonuses that last year doubled to $9.6 million -- which CML
had to borrow to pay.</p>
<p>With two years of the agreement remaining, Mr. Leighton in
1989 bought out the Paul's contract for $25.7 million. "If we
did it again with another company, we'd put a ceiling on the
amount of dollars the bonus would pay," Mr. Leighton says.</p>
<p>Mr. Leighton, in fact, has altogether altered the way he
acquires companies. Where he used to buy them outright, he
now is investing only in small firms whose owners grant CML
the right to buy their company at book value in five years.
In exchange, CML, which has made three such deals so far with
small specialty retailers, provides them with management
advice and financial support.</p>
<p>"We'll be testing the marketplace and growth potential of
a company before we bring it into CML," Mr. Leighton says.
"If we like what we see, then we can exercise our option."</p>
