	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- Senate Republicans yesterday unveiled their
proposals for overhauling the system of financing federal
campaigns. Democrats promptly denounced the proposals as
insufficient.
   The Republican campaign-finance package would eliminate
political action committees, reduce and require stricter
disclosure of "soft money" contributions made to state
political parties, restrict contributions from out-of-state
individual donors, create a special fund for congressional
challengers, and provide lower broadcast rates to candidates.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>These proposals, which Senate Republican Leader Robert
Dole hailed as an "historic and challenging campaign-reform
package," will soon be introduced as legislation by Kentucky
Republican Mitch McConnell, who led the filibuster that
killed campaign-finance legislation in the Senate two years
ago.</p>
<p>Two leading Democrats, Majority Leader George Mitchell of
Maine and Sen. David Boren of Oklahoma, said the GOP
proposals unveiled yesterday wouldn't stem the flow of
special-interest money in politics because they wouldn't cap
the overall amount of money candidates can spend in their
campaigns. "Without limits on spending there cannot be
genuine reform," Sen. Mitchell said.</p>
<p>There has been a partisan logjam on campaign finance for
years, with Democrats advocating spending caps and
Republicans resisting them. Democrats are also much cooler to
the idea of eliminating the role of PACs, and several
Democratic senators said that proposals to abolish them would
be unconstitutional.</p>
<p>Yesterday, Sen. Boren indicated that Democrats might be
willing to agree to the centerpiece of the Republican
packagethe abolition of PACs-but only if the Republicans were
willing to embrace some form of spending limits.</p>
<p>Democrats, meanwhile, have been meeting for weeks in an
attempt to reach consensus on various campaign-finance
proposals. Democrats who face re-election in 1992 are seeking
an array of transitional provisions to preserve certain
fund-raising advantages they enjoy under the current law. But
Sen. Boren said the Democrats are close to agreement and hope
to unveil their proposals in the next few days.</p>
<p>The question left unanswered yesterday is if there is any
real hope that the partisan deadlock on campaign finance can
be broken this year. "There's still plenty of room for
negotiation," Sen. Boren said.</p>
