	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- After a halt of more than two years to
resolve safety and management problems, the Energy Department
tentatively plans to resume producing a key component of
nuclear bombs by late December or early January.
   When the government in 1988 closed down its tritium
production reactors at the department's Savannah River
facility in South Carolina, fears were raised that the
nation's nuclear weapons arsenal would be weakened. Tritium,
a perishable radioactive gas, is used to enhance the power of
nuclear bombs.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>One reactor at Savannah River is scheduled to begin
low-power testing in December, with production to resume soon
thereafter. All three reactors at the facility are planned to
go back in production by the end of next year. The restart
plans, which have been delayed, are contingent on an
assessment of environmental implications.</p>
<p>"Until I am assured that the environment, safety and
health considerations have been satisfactorily addressed, I
will not approve restart of the reactors at Savannah River,"
Energy Secretary James Watkins said.</p>
<p>Improvements already completed or planned at Savannah
River, which is run by Westinghouse Electric Corp., include
increased training for employees and changes designed to make
operations at Savannah River more like those at commercial
nuclear facilities.</p>
