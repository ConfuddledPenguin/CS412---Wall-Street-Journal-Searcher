	<p class="article-leader">With the environment now certified as a politically sacred
issue, special interests are using the Clean Air Bill as a
Trojan Horse for some of the most dubious subsidies ever
foisted upon the American people. Richard Ayres, head of the
National Clean Air Coalition, says it was the victim of "a
special-interest feeding frenzy" as Senators vied to insert
favors in late-night voice votes. They range from a national
pollution center in Texas to an acid-rain research project
for Wyoming. But the most egregious is an amendment
co-sponsored by Minority Leader Bob Dole that will require
the use of ethanol fuel in nine cities.
   The farmers who produce ethanol, a corn-distilled alcohol,
are already among the most pampered in America. Ethanol
receives a 60-cent-a-gallon tax credit that is about equal to
the entire refinery cost of a gallon of gasoline. This
program has cost the federal Highway Trust Fund, which is
used to repair bridges and roads, more than $3 billion since
1979.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The latest ethanol giveaway sets out specific requirements
for all gasoline that will be sold in the nine smoggiest
cities by 1994. Rather than set overall clean-air goals and
let the cities find a way to meet them, the Senate has
dictated the oxygen content and other qualities of the new
fuel. The only fuel that meets the standard is ethanol.</p>
<p>Iowa Senator Tom Harkin says the provision would cover
about 25% of the nation's drivers, and he boasts that it
"could double the amount of ethanol used." The Congressional
Research Service estimates the extra 10 cents to 15 cents
per-gallon cost of the fuel would cost consumers in the nine
cities $25 billion to $50 billion.</p>
<p>The irony is that forcing smoggy cities to burn more
ethanol may not improve air quality. Ethanol lowers carbon
monoxide emissions, but the Environmental Protection Agency
reports that it produces more nitrogen oxides and
hydrocarbons than normal gasoline. Thus, Wisconsin officials
say mandating ethanol will make it difficult for Milwaukee to
meet federal ozone smog standards.</p>
<p>The main beneficiary of this windfall will be
Archer-Daniels-Midland Inc., which accounts for 75% of U.S.
ethanol production. For years, ADM has romanced Washington
policy makers through generous contributions and sponsorship
of the Beltway's favorite Sunday-morning political shows. ADM
chief executive Dwayne Andreas is a major contributor to
Senator Dole and ADM's foundation has given $160,000 to his
Dole Foundation. ADM claims it didn't lobby for the ethanol
amendment, but perhaps it didn't have to. Mr. Dole insisted
on it, and the White House withdrew its veto threat in the
face of his support.</p>
<p>"The piggishness of ADM has caused a major political
problem for the whole corn industry," says John Ford of the
American Corn Growers Association, a group that decries Mr.
Andreas's influence in Washington. "The corn industry, the
politics of it, is controlled by one man, and Bob Dole is his
gofer on the Hill," Mr. Ford told the Kansas City Star.</p>
<p>The Clean Air Bill is now up for debate in the House,
where Texas Reps. Jack Fields and Ralph Hall plan to
challenge the ethanol subsidy. Their plan would require the
use of alternative fuels in the nine target cities, but lets
engineers and local officials find a way to meet the
standards.</p>
<p>We've said before that there's a lot more to the politics
of the Clean Air Bill than a desire to improve the
environment. Rather than rely on market-based incentives to
clean up pollution, it uses controls and red tape to reward
some industries and punish others. The bill may ostensibly be
about clean air, but the deals hatched in the smoke-filled
rooms of the Capitol are pure, pork-barrel politics.</p>
