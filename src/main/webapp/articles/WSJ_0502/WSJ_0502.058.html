	<p class="article-leader">Campbell Soup Co. laid off 14% of the staff at its
corporate headquarters in Camden, N.J., and said it had
eliminated another 5% through attrition since Jan. 1.
   The cutbacks at the head office continue the streamlining
program started by Chief Executive Officer David W. Johnson
when he joined Campbell in January.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The maker of food products said a total of 364 positions
were eliminated, 267 through layoffs and 97 through
attrition. The staff reduction is expected to save about $17
million over the first full fiscal year, which begins in
August. All levels of staffing were affected, including
senior management.</p>
<p>In an interview, Mr. Johnson said the cutbacks are
symbolic of his drive to improve productivity and boost
Campbell's earnings growth and return on equity, both of
which now rank near the bottom among major food companies. In
addition, the changes are intended to make Campbell less
bureaucratic and more efficient by eliminating layers of
supervisors and reports.</p>
<p>"The headquarters is where you set the drumbeats and the
tones," Mr. Johnson said. "If I can get the drumbeats and
examples set out here, we can begin to change the vast
empire."</p>
<p>Since Mr. Johnson's arrival, Campbell has put its Juice
Bowl unit on the auction block and closed several previously
targeted plants in the U.S. and United Kingdom. In addition,
several top executives have left the company. They include
Carl V. Stinnett, president of Campbell's non-grocery
business, Steven A. McNeil, head of frozen foods, and Raymond
J. Land, category general manager for convenience foods.</p>
<p>Mr. Stinnett, 55 years old, took early retirement and his
job was eliminated. Mr. McNeil, 47, left to pursue other
interests and will be replaced, Mr. Johnson said. Mr. Johnson
would not comment on the departure of Mr. Land, 45.</p>
<p>Mr. Johnson declined to specify which senior executives
were laid off yesterday. But he noted that Herbert M. Baum,
executive vice president in charge of Campbell's North
American operations, now has only 10 people reporting
directly to him, about half the number he had before.</p>
<p>Mr. Johnson said the reorganization was necessary to his
plan to improve Campbell's financial performance rapidly. "I
can't keep sitting back and telling the shareholders to give
me another year," Mr. Johnson said. "In my first 12 months,
we're going to see the results," he vowed. He said he
expected Campbell to be exceeding food-company averages of
15% annual earnings growth and 22% return on equity by the
end of the calendar year.</p>
<p>"The score card we're going to be judged on is the
quarterly report," Mr. Johnson said.</p>
<p>In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday,
Campbell closed at $50.75, unchanged.</p>
