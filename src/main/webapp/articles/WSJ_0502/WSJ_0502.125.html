	<p class="article-leader">German Wings Luftfahrtunternehmen G.m.b.H., a small,
struggling West German airline, said that it halted all
flights just before midnight Monday and that it will hold a
news conference this morning at its headquarters near Munich.
Yesterday was a holiday in West Germany.
   The one-year-old airline, which has been searching for a
European partner for the past four months, said another small
West German airline, Aero Lloyd, is accepting passengers
holding tickets for German Wings flights.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"All flights have been stopped," a German Wings spokesman
said. "We don't know anything more." Sources said the airline
has begun bankruptcy-law proceedings, but this couldn't be
confirmed.</p>
<p>News reports have said that German Wings had a loss of 50
million marks ($29.8 million) in its first year of
operations. Just one week ago, the airline said it planned to
announce the name of a new partner and to report its
first-year financial data at a news conference scheduled for
last Friday, but on Thursday it canceled the session.</p>
