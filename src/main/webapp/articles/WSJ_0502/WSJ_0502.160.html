	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Wanted: Private-placement specialists. Good
pay. Immediate openings. Bright future.
   Welcome to Wall Street's latest bull market. The expected
surge in privately placed securities under the Securities and
Exchange Commission's new Rule 144a has made
private-placement specialists one of the hottest commodities
around.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>This is big news at a time when most of the securities
industry is fast contracting and many investment banks are
looking for ways to lop off jobs. Since the October 1987
stock market crash, nearly 45,000 securities employees have
been dismissed nationwide.</p>
<p>But the SEC's new rule, which is expected to make it
easier for corporations and institutional investors to sell
and trade bonds and stocks in the $170 billion
private-placement market, is a bright spot for securities
firms scrambling for ways to generate fees. And it couldn't
come at a better time: In the first quarter, investment
banking revenue at many major investment banks was down 20%
or more from year-earlier levels.</p>
<p>The result: a bidding war and defections from the
private-placement departments at major securities firms. In
the past several weeks alone, the heads of the
private-placement groups at Merrill Lynch & Co., American
Express Co.'s Shearson Lehman Hutton Holdings Inc. and
Prudential Insurance Co. of America's Prudential-Bache
Securities Inc. have bolted for greener pastures. Other
securities firms and banks have reshuffled their
private-placement desks, and securities industry executives
expect further moves in the next few weeks.</p>
<p>Wall Street executive recruiters are busily trying to
match up private-placement specialists with securities firms
dangling big salaries. Gary Goldstein, president of Whitney
Group, a New York executive search firm, says: "Everything
relating to private placements is increasingly in demand.
This is a very hot area right now."</p>
<p>Joan Zimmerman, executive vice president at GZ Stephens
Inc., a New York executive search firm, said, "Wall Street
has learned that private-placement people can be revenue
generators."</p>
<p>The new SEC rule, which went into effect earlier this
week, could transform the way many companies raise capital.
This is because it will make it easier for companies to
sidestep many of the registration requirements of public
offerings and sell debt or stock directly to big
institutional investors through private placements. The SEC
rule also is expected to increase the ease of trading in the
secondary, or resale, market.</p>
<p>The moves at big securities firms have come with dizzying
speed. Last week, Merrill Lynch officials were stunned by the
sudden departure of Jerome P. Greene, for nine years its head
of private placements, and Benjamin J. Sullivan Jr., a
managing director, who both joined Benedetto, Gartland &
Greene Inc., a small investment banking boutique. Philip B.
Pool Jr., a managing director in Merrill Lynch's
private-placement group, also had planned to leave with
Messrs. Greene and Sullivan, but was persuaded to stay at the
last moment with promises of expanded responsibility, Merrill
Lynch officials said.</p>
<p>Merrill Lynch nevertheless recently lost two other
private-placement specialists, Luke Bowes, who moved to
Prudential-Bache, and Jay Applegate, who departed to Dean
Witter Reynolds Inc., a Sears, Roebuck & Co. unit. At the
same time, Merrill Lynch has beefed up its 11-member
private-placement unit with the additions of two former
Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. employees, Lawrence Aletto and
David Weiss, who will concentrate on high-yield,
below-investment-grade "junk" bond issues.</p>
<p>The turnover at Prudential-Bache has been no less hectic.
The firm recently lost its private-placement head, Dorothy
Dotson, along with Shel Hirschberg, senior vice president,
and Dale Hunt, vice president, to S.G Warburg & Co., the U.S.
arm of the London-based merchant bank. Ms. Dotson was
succeeded by Henry S. Miller, a former Shearson Lehman
executive who joined Prudential-Bache last summer.</p>
<p>In addition to hiring Mr. Bowes from Merrill Lynch,
Prudential-Bache picked up Eli Hassine, a senior vice
president, and John Youngblood, a vice president, from
Shearson Lehman. And it hired Mary Morse, a former vice
president at Marine Midland Banks Inc., a Buffalo, N.Y.-based
unit of HongKong & Shanghai Banking Corp. of Hong Kong.</p>
<p>Shearson Lehman, in addition to seeing Messrs. Hassine and
Youngblood defect to Prudential-Bache, also recently lost its
head of private placements, Joel Glasky. It isn't clear where
Mr. Glasky has landed. Named as co-heads of Shearson Lehman's
group are Kathryn Maney and Gilbey Kamens, senior vice
presidents.</p>
<p>Commercial banks haven't escaped unscathed, either. A
total of more than a dozen private-placement professionals
have jumped ship from the Citibank unit of Citicorp and the
Bankers Trust Co. unit of Bankers Trust New York Corp. to
launch their own firm, Capstar Partners, securities industry
executives said.</p>
<p>Private-placement specialists help to structure deals and
target potential buyers. They typically are paid between
$200,000 to $250,000 a year, recruiters said.</p>
<p>But private-placement specialists who help drum up deals
can earn far more. These specialists suggest companies that
might be ripe for privately placed deals, and work out ways
they can be structured and placed in the market. Those who
work on more complex financings can be paid anywhere between
$350,000 and $600,000, recruiters said.</p>
<p>While private placement has never been considered
glamorous on Wall Street, these executives nevertheless are
increasingly valuable these days. Whitney Group's Mr.
Goldstein said, "It's one of the few areas left with
attractive spreads," or profit margins.</p>
