	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Yields on certificates of deposit at major
banks and brokerage firms rose across the board for the week
ended yesterday, but continued to trail those available to
investors on Treasury securities.
   The biggest gains were among small-denomination CDs sold
by leading brokerage firms. Average yields on six-month CDs
rose to 8.37% from 8.29%, while average yields on five-year
CDs climbed to 8.93% from 8.85%, according to figures
compiled by Banxquote Money Markets, a New York information
service.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>CDs sold directly by banks offered somewhat lower yields,
according to an 18-bank survey by Banxquote. The average
yield on small-denomination, one-year CDs was 8.08%, up from
8.02% the week before, while five-year consumer CDs offered
8.26%, up from 8.20%</p>
<p>For large-denomination CDs, which typically require
deposits of $90,000 or more, the average six-month yield was
8.13%, up from 8.04%, while one-year yields were 8.33%, up
from 8.25%</p>
<p>Despite the increases, investors could do even better with
Treasurys, which have offered sharply higher yields in the
past couple of weeks because of renewed inflationary fears.
Six-month Treasury bills, for instance, were yielding 8.5%
yesterday, while investors willing to lock up their money for
three or more years could get yields in excess of 9%.</p>
<p>"Banks will be under a lot of pressure to increase CD
yields even further to make them competitive with equivalent
Treasury securities," said Norberto Mehl, chairman of
Banxquote.</p>
<p>Typically, bank yields lag Treasury yields when interest
rates are rising. That's because banks adjust their yields
periodically to reflect the need for deposits and local
competitive factors; yields on Treasury securities are tied
directly to developments in the money markets.</p>
<p>Currently, CD yields show considerable variation from
region to region, with banks in Texas and Florida offering
some of the least attractive levels. For example, the
five-year CD average in Texas is 7.50%, compared with 8.47%
in New York and 8.53% in Pennsylvania. Average yields on
three-month CDs were 7.13% at Florida banks and 7.21% at
Texas banks, compared with 7.88% at both Pennsylvania and New
York banks.</p>
<p>Chase Manhattan Bank in New York is offering a 9.17% yield
on five-year jumbo CDs, one of the highest in the nation,
according to Banxquote. Continental Bank in Chicago is
offering a 9% yield on five-year jumbos.</p>
