	<p class="article-leader">With the junk bond market in the doldrums, junk bond
players have developed a new pastime: figuring out how to
profit from RJR Nabisco's $6 billion high-yield-headache.
   RJR is supposed to reset the interest rate on $6 billion
of its debt by next May so that the two bond issues will
trade at 100 cents on the dollar. That's a tough problem for
bonds that have been trading as low as 57 cents on the dollar
this year.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Prices of some RJR bonds have risen from their deeply
depressed levels of earlier this year amid speculation about
what RJR and its parent, Kohlberg Kravis Roberts, will do.
Even after the run-up, several junk-bond analysts are
recommending the RJR issues, betting that the combination of
RJR's strong cash flow and KKR's financial engineering skills
will drive the bonds still higher within a year.</p>
<p>These particular RJR bonds are highly volatile and aren't
for the faint of heart: They are two separate issues of
"payment in kind" bonds, which pay interest in more bonds,
not cash. One of the two PIKs, which can be converted into
25% of RJR's common equity in 1993, is especially "high
octane stuff," warns Dirk M. Van Doren, a junk bond analyst
with McCarthy, Crisanti & Maffei.</p>
<p>With the bonds now trading at around 67 cents on the
dollar, they would require an interest rate of 20% or more to
cause them to trade at par, their full face amount. Paying
such a high rate would be costly for RJR and would probably
undermine investor confidence in RJR's other debt issues.</p>
<p>As a result, KKR has had two investment banking firms,
Merrill Lynch and Morgan Stanley, hard at work on potential
solutions to the reset problem. And analysts, in turn, are
trying to figure out what KKR's advisers might devise.</p>
<p>"We've identified 15 scenarios and most are favorable to
KKR, RJR and bondholders," says Sam DeRosa-Farag, a First
Boston bond analyst.</p>
<p>If RJR can get its two issues of PIK reset bonds close to
par by next May, the returns for investors will be
impressive. The RJR subordinated exchange debentures of 2007
closed at 66 7/8 yesterday, indicating a yield of about 20%
plus a potential price appreciation of 49% if the bonds hit
par.</p>
<p>The convertible debentures due 2009 closed at 80 1/4
yesterday, but that price includes about 15 months' worth of
accrued interest. Derek A. Jones, a high-yield analyst with
J.P. Morgan Securities, estimates that the principal amount
reflected in that price is also about 67. With the added
attraction of convertibility into common stock, Mr. Jones
says he favors the debentures due 2009 because he believes
they're cheap relative to those due 2007.</p>
<p>Several analysts, including Mr. DeRosaFarag, have
suggested that RJR might sell its Planters/Lifesavers unit
for at least $1.5 billion and use the proceeds to reduce
senior debt or buy back some of the PIK reset bonds. Buying
back a significant amount of the bonds would require
permission from RJR's bank lenders, but that isn't viewed as
a major stumbling block.</p>
<p>But RJR's management wants to keep its remaining major
businesses, according to people familiar with KKR. Although
an asset sale in excess of $1 billion remains a possibility,
it is very low on the list of options, these people say.</p>
<p>Another set of scenarios revolves around a possible
exchange offer, in which RJR might ask bondholders to accept
a change in the terms of the bonds such as the reset
provision, in exchange for a sweetener such as a drop in the
price at which the bonds can convert into equity or an
increased share of the equity. Why not simply swap new PIK
bonds? Last summer after the RJR bonds were issued, Congress
changed the tax law so that interest paid on PIK junk bonds
can't be deducted for corporate income tax purposes. Interest
on new junk bonds must be paid in cash or it can't be
deducted.</p>
<p>A third group of scenarios involves a partial buy-back of
the bonds either by RJR or KKR. RJR would need its banks'
permission. Although KKR could conceivably use money from its
leveraged buy-out fund to buy some of the RJR convertible
bonds, that investment would probably drag down the fund's
overall return. Rumors that RJR or KKR has been buying back
bonds have helped drive up the prices of RJR junk bonds in
recent weeks, but those rumors are unfounded, people familiar
with RJR say. RJR and KKR decline to comment.</p>
<p>Another option, which undoubtedly appeals to KKR, is to do
nothing more than allow the bond market to watch RJR's
improving cash flow. In the first quarter, for example,
operating income before amortization of trademarks and good
will increased 43% to $754 million from $526 million a year
earlier. Says Mr. Van Doren: "If you get another two quarters
like the first quarter they had -- they're not boomers, but
they're fairly strong -- the market starts to feel that
they're a fairly good credit and they can stand that debt,
and the price of the bonds goes up. If they can get the bonds
to 90 cents on the dollar, they can reset them."</p>
<p>One factor working in RJR's favor -- and perhaps against
bondholders -- is that the bonds, once reset, don't have to
trade at par to fulfill the terms of the bond indenture. RJR
simply must obtain opinions from two investment banking firms
that the reset interest rate would have caused the bonds to
trade at par on a particular day.</p>
<p>Analysts and junk bond investors believe that the supply
of RJR PIK bonds far exceeds current demand for such issues.
And even for speculative investors, there's a tax problem.
Holders of PIK bonds must pay taxes on the interest that's
building up, even though the interest isn't paid in cash.</p>
