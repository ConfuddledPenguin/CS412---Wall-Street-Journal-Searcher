	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Arthur Ross, president and co-chief executive
officer of Carter Organization Inc., will leave the proxy
solicitation firm in several months, as part of a
cost-cutting move.
   Carter, which is owned by VPI Group PLC of Britain, has
been hurt by the slowdown in merger-and-acquisition activity.
And just last March, the firm's founder and former chairman,
Don Carter, pleaded guilty to charges of grand larceny and
personal income-tax evasion. Following the plea, Mr. Carter
was fired.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Mr. Ross, however, said the firm's troubles aren't linked
to Mr. Carter's situation. "There's no direct cause and
effect," he said. Though there have been almost no client
defections, the 48-year-old Mr. Ross said, "It's fair to say
our business could be stronger."</p>
<p>Mr. Ross, whose duties are largely administrative, said
his resignation was part of a staff reduction that focused on
the administrative side of the business.</p>
<p>Mr. Ross, who has been with Carter since 1985, is one of
several people -- he wouldn't say how many -- who will leave
the firm in the next few months. As of last Friday, Carter
had slightly more than 100 employees. Simon Strauss,
executive vice president of VPI N.A., the North American
holding company, and senior vice president of Carter, also
will leave.</p>
<p>Mr. Ross said he will remain for several months through a
transition, and work with Dennis Mensch, co-chief executive,
who is responsible for client services. Whether a successor
is named will be decided later.</p>
<p>Mr. Mensch, 37 years old, said Mr. Ross "participated
fully in this decision."</p>
<p>Mr. Carter, the former chairman who entered the guilty
plea, faces as long as four years in state prison. State
officials have said that behind Mr. Carter's plea was "a
systematic pattern of greed and fraud" involving the
overcharging and false billing of corporate clients at
Carter, which Mr. Carter founded in 1974. As part of his plea
agreement, Mr. Carter is to put $1 million in escrow to
reimburse wronged clients, which officials said included
firms such as Caesars World Inc. and MacAndrews & Forbes
Holdings Inc., parent of Revlon Inc.</p>
