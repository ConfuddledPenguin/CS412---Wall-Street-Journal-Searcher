	<p class="article-leader">GENEVA -- OPEC ministers meeting here to attempt to prop
up oil prices arrived apparently convinced that short-term
production cuts are the only way to calm nervous oil markets.
   As a result, their main task when they officially open
their session today is expected to be determining the size of
such cuts and how they'll be shared among the 13 members of
the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Technically, the emergency meeting called by Sadek
Boussena, Algeria's oil minister and acting OPEC president,
is only of the organization's policy-setting monitoring
committee. But Mr. Boussena invited all ministers to attend,
and as they arrived yesterday, most quickly began informal
consultations. Many also met with Mr. Boussena last night.</p>
<p>The ministers were summoned on only about 10 days' notice
to figure out ways to halt a steep petroleum price slide. The
meeting was seen as so urgent that it was called even though
a regular session had already been scheduled for May 25. Mr.
Boussena pushed that back to June 25.</p>
<p>World oil prices have skidded as much as $6 a barrel this
year, mostly because OPEC's output has been running as much
as two million barrels a day ahead of its official first-half
production ceiling. Only in recent days have prices come off
their lows to stabilize, in part because of OPEC's planned
meeting and signs that its production is already easing some.
Yesterday, oil prices rose as traders tried to avoid being
caught short by today's meeting.</p>
<p>As they arrived, several ministers made clear that they
are disturbed by current oil prices.</p>
<p>"We want them higher," said Hisham Nazer, oil minister of
Saudi Arabia. The kingdom, Kuwait and the United Arab
Emirates generally are cited as major contributors to the oil
glut because they have been producing beyond their quotas.</p>
<p>Still, most of the oil ministers appeared to be in
agreement with Mr. Boussena on the task before them. "The
target is clear: {elimination} of the surplus in the market,"
Mr. Boussena said.</p>
<p>Mr. Boussena then proposed a solution: OPEC production
cuts of one million to 1.5 million barrels a day. However, he
said the question of whether all members including those such
as Algeria that already are producing below their quotas
should cut back "is one of the issues we will discuss."</p>
<p>Other suggestions of possible reductions ranged from
500,000 barrels a day to two million. Whatever the figure,
the consensus seemed to be that any measures taken here
should be limited to May and June and that the meeting be
kept brief to avoid controversy that might further upset oil
markets. OPEC's second-half production ceiling and
country-by-country quotas should be left to the regular
summer conference, several ministers insisted.</p>
<p>"We have to concentrate on what is happening now," said
Diego Tamariz, Ecuador's oil minister.</p>
<p>Differences have surfaced over how much OPEC is producing
at the moment. Some delegates suggested that some ministers
are inflating estimates of total production to make any cuts
look larger. On the other hand, there have been indications
recently that production already is coming down from the
eight-year high of 24 million barrels a day reached in March.
Buyers have been balking as storage tanks are brimful, and
some exporters have refused to discount prices further to
move more of their oil.</p>
<p>Current output estimates range between 23 million and 24
million barrels a day. Most are right about in the middle,
though Issam Abdul Raheem Al-Chalabi, Iraq's oil minister,
puts it at the top of the range. "It's quite high," he told
reporters. "It will have to go down quite a bit."</p>
<p>OPEC's economists are warning that continued output in the
current range would mean an enormous increase in oil
inventories. They cautioned that the increases could reach
2.2 million to 3.2 million barrels a day and that this
development could lead to another price fall similar to last
month's.</p>
<p>In their latest report, the economists again slightly
revised upward their projected demand for OPEC oil for 1990
to 22.5 million barrels a day. Still, they noted that demand
for OPEC oil, excluding inventory changes, totals only 20.9
million barrels a day this quarter. Their estimates for the
third and fourth-quarter demand are 21.4 million and 24.3
million, respectively.</p>
<p>Those figures aren't much different from estimates made by
some outside oil economists. Paul Mlotok of Morgan Stanley &
Co. forecast demand for OPEC oil at an average of 23 million
barrels a day for the year, though he said it will run below
that this quarter. "They really do need to hold it {output}
down for May and June," he said.</p>
