	<p class="article-leader">LONDON -- Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. joined the list
of international financial firms that are trimming their
equities operations here.
   The U.S. securities house, a unit of Prudential Insurance
Co. of America, Newark, N.J., said it is "substantially
downsizing" its equities operation in Britain because of
lackluster returns. The firm, which started making markets in
British stocks about a year ago, is cutting about 20 of 30
jobs in the line and eliminating most of its
equities-research department.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>A spokeswoman said Prudential-Bache will continue to make
markets in 10 big British stocks, and provide brokerage
services. "Market conditions in the U.K. have quite simply
forced us to reassess (our) commitment to the U.K. equities
market," the firm said.</p>
<p>Citicorp, Chase Manhattan Corp. and Morgan Grenfell are
among the firms that have sharply reduced or eliminated their
British equities operations amid overcapacity and lackluster
profits in the competitive London markets. Prudential-Bache
employs about 500 people in London, in a variety of foreign
exchange, trading and corporate finance activities.</p>
