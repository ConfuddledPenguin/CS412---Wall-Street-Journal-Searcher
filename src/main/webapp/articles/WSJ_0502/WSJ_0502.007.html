	<p class="article-leader">MAYNARD,Mass. -- Digital Equipment Corp. is negotiating an
equity investment and technology agreement with fast-growing
software maker Ingres Corp.
   Ingres, the Alameda, Calif.-based software developer,
which changed its name last year from Relational Technology
Inc., had sales of $130.7 million in the fiscal year ended
June 30. It develops relational data base software for
Digital computers and other computer designs.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>A Digital spokesman said the two companies are discussing
"both a technology and a business partnership" that would
result in a minority investment by Digital.</p>
<p>Digital rarely makes investments in other companies,
though it has broken that tradition recently for access to
new technologies. Last year, it bought a 5.7% stake in chip
maker MIPS Computer Systems Co., Sunnyvale, Calif., and it
holds warrants to purchase up to 18%.</p>
<p>Digital is especially interested in Ingres's software for
Unix, an increasingly popular computer operating system
developed by American Telephone & Telegraph Co. and viewed as
"open" because it is widely licensed by AT&T to others.
Digital has become increasingly aggressive in the Unix market
in the past year, as sales of its proprietary VAX line have
slowed.</p>
<p>Separately, Digital unveiled a suite of software products
designed to allow its computers to work easily with computers
made by Apple Computer Inc., Cupertino, Calif.</p>
<p>The products tying the two companies' computers together
are the first to emerge from a widely heralded technology
alliance disclosed two years ago. They were announced in New
York by Kenneth H. Olsen, Digital's president, and Apple
Chief Executive Officer John Sculley.</p>
<p>Digital will market the products, which among other
capabilities allow Digital computers to be used as file
servers tying together networks of Apple Macintosh computers.
The software packages make it possible to share data,
electronic mail, printers and other devices.</p>
