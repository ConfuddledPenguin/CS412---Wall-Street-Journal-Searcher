	<p class="article-leader">Bulldozers run riot, ripping scars in the land and
belching fumes in the air. What kind of place is it?
   How about, Acres for Wildlife.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>That's the new name slapped on 700 acres of land north of
Peoria, Ill., owned by Caterpillar Inc. Every day is Earth
Day at the site, which the heavy-equipment maker uses to
demonstrate its bulldozers, wheel loaders and other giant
yellow machines. (Once or twice a decade, the company also
holds its big Power Parade at the area; thousands come to
watch a mammoth demonstration of Cat machines weighing as
much as 100 tons.)</p>
<p>But besides customers and special visitors, the site has
also been attracting uninvited guests: poachers stalking deer
in the surrounding woods. So a Cat service technician
proposed making the whole area part of the state's
acres-for-wildlife program. The designation allows Cat to
post "Illinois Acres for Wildlife" above its "No Trespassing"
signs, telling poachers they are doubly unwelcome.</p>
<p>Max Runkle, a district wildlife biologist for the state,
was skeptical at first. The preservation program, created to
recognize landowners who set aside property for wildlife,
usually is used by farmers.</p>
<p>But Mr. Runkle says a tour of the site convinced him that
Cat was a worthy recipient of the designation. As if on cue,
half a dozen deer showed up at the side of the road. He says
he found much of Cat's property "a basic panorama of
Midwestern Illinois," with woods and fields flowing over the
hilly terrain.</p>
<p>As for the diesel fumes wafting through those hills, the
biologist says Cat's demo activity isn't "ongoing or
intensive." And he and company officials also point out that
the demonstration area is only about 15% of the 700 acres Cat
owns.</p>
<p>Because ground clawed bare by earth-moving equipment tends
to erode, Cat digs ponds at low spots in the area to collect
the runoff. It then moves the recaptured dirt back to the
demo site. "A lot of people think our tractors just tear up
the earth, but Cat machines do a lot to enhance the
environment, too," a company official asserts in an employee
newsletter heralding the wildlife designation.</p>
<p>And what about the noise?</p>
<p>Tom Potts, the Cat technician who suggested the
wildlife-acres idea, says the deer don't seem to mind. "They
get used to heavy equipment. As long as you don't bother
them, they stand out and watch you."</p>
