	<p class="article-leader">In "Stand and Deliver," America met Jaime Escalante, the
barrio teacher who bullied, cajoled and inspired his students
to step onto the top rung of academic accomplishment. When
Mr. Escalante's students conquered the Educational Testing
Service's Advanced Placement examination in calculus, America
knew they had reached the highest standard we have for our
high school students. They had done college-level work while
in high school and had that work certified by a national
examination.
   Eat your heart out, Japan] In your face, Western Europe]
These were our kids, and they were top-notch students. The AP
program said so, and AP means high standards, as high as
anyone's.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Or does it? The development committee for the AP Latin
examination has announced that in 1990-91 the AP syllabus in
Vergil's "Aeneid" will be reduced by nearly a third, from
2,649 lines of Latin to 1,842. Students will read the rest of
"The Aeneid" in English translation.</p>
<p>This is only the most recent in a series of reductions
made over the past two decades. When I started teaching in
1969, the AP Vergil syllabus included 3,166 lines. And in
1964 a fourth-year Latin class at a public high school in
Little Rock, Ark., found it possible -- not easy, but
possible -- to read half "The Aeneid" in Latin. I know,
because I still have the well-marked text I used as a student
in that class.</p>
<p>Could less be more? Could objections to the reduced
syllabus come from gerund-grinding Latin teachers who think
that the only object of Latin class is a line-by-line forced
march through the text and the production of a translation in
the style of Housman's "Oh suitably attired in leather boots,
head of a traveller?" Have the enlightened examiners now
allowed students time to lift their heads from ground
littered with supines or enclitics and appreciate the
beauties of the Vergilian landscape around them?</p>
<p>Probably not. The new syllabus distorts as well as
reduces. Anyone who reads half "The Aeneid" in Latin and half
in translation can claim to know what Vergil is like. So,
with somewhat less reason, can someone who has read a third
of the epic in Latin. But students who read the new AP Vergil
syllabus -- less than one-fifth of "The Aeneid" in Latin and
the rest in English -- will have taken a course in translated
literature. They will know something, and something worth
knowing, but they will not have read Vergil in Latin. They
will know about as much about the epic in Latin as a Japanese
would know about Elizabethan drama in English after reading
Tom Stoppard's "Dogg's Hamlet" and a Japanese translation of
Shakespeare's play.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the changes in the Vergil examination have
not been made with the intention of improving the AP
syllabus. They have been made in response to a decline in the
standard of work asked of most students in American secondary
and higher education. When the Educational Testing Service
asked colleges about their undergraduate Vergil courses, most
colleges replied that their students did not read anything
like 3,000 lines of Vergil in a semester. Many high schools
reported that the AP Vergil syllabus was impossible to finish
in a year's work.</p>
<p>Not all high schools find the present standard
unreachable. But now that the AP program no longer requires
students to read as much as they did, the present standard
may become unreachable. Schools have little incentive to ask
their best students to read more than the AP syllabus
requires. The prestige of the AP program guarantees that the
new, dwarf syllabus will come to be regarded as the national
standard of excellence -- at least until even the 1,800-line
syllabus becomes too much for most colleges and schools.</p>
<p>It would be unfair to blame the Educational Testing
Service for responding to reports that most of its
constituency finds the present AP standard too difficult. The
examiners have simply acted on the results of their marketing
survey.</p>
<p>But the AP program -- in every subject -- serves American
education by providing one of our only national standards of
excellence. All of us, not just Latin teachers, ought to
become concerned when one of the few markers we have to show
our children the top moves down several notches. We may not
be able to hope that our average students are as good as
those from more homogeneous societies and less egalitarian
educational systems in Europe and Japan, but we have consoled
ourselves with the thought that our best, whether at Andover
or in East L.A., are as good as theirs. One of the standards
by which we measure our best has just been lowered, and all
of us, not merely the students lucky enough to read Vergil in
Latin, stand a little lower.</p>
