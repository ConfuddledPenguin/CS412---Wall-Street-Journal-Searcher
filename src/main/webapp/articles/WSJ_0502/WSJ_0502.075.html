	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- The House voted 218-208 to approve a
Democratic spending plan for fiscal 1991 that Speaker Thomas
Foley described as only "a first step in the process" of
crafting a budget.
   Viewed by House Democrats as little more than their
opening position for talks with the Senate and the White
House, the $1.24 trillion plan managed to attract votes even
from some Democrats who dislike the measure because they
think it cuts too much defense spending and from some who
think it cuts too little. In all, 34 Democrats voted against
the plan, and no Republicans voted for it.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>In an unusual and spirited speech to the House, Speaker
Foley (D., Wash.) exhorted Democrats to support the
leadership's budget to "set forth today the new agenda" and
demonstrate "that we can march, not drift, into the century."</p>
<p>Ostensibly, the House-backed budget would trim $35.5
billion from the deficit for the fiscal year starting next
Oct. 1. But its chief author, House Budget Committee Chairman
Leon Panetta (D., Calif.), estimates the "hard savings" at no
more than $26 billion or $27 billion. The plan leaves largely
unexplained about $9 billion of the deficit reduction it
assumes.</p>
<p>Even at face value, the House plan isn't sufficient to
avoid across-the-board budget cuts this fall, White House
Budget Director Richard Darman said. Because of the slowing
economy and higher interest rates, he now estimates that
Congress needs to pare $45 billion or more from the fiscal
1991 deficit to meet the Gramm-Rudman law's target of $64
billion.</p>
<p>In the Senate, meanwhile, Budget Committee Chairman James
Sasser (D., Tenn.) is circulating a new plan among panel
members in his efforts to forge a majority. "We're close . .
. but no cigar," he told reporters. "But we can smell the
aroma of the cigar."</p>
<p>Although the numbers may change marginally as Sen. Sasser
woos members, those who have seen his plan say it would
shrink the deficit by about $43 billion from projected
levels. It calls for cutting spending of all types more than
in the House plan and for raising $13.9 billion in taxes, the
same as the House budget.</p>
<p>Specifically, it would cut $13 billion from projected
defense spending, less than the $15 billion Sen. Sasser
endorsed earlier; cut entitlements such as Medicare and farm
subsidies by about $5.6 billion, and cut other domestic
spending by about $3.6 billion. It also would include $6.2
billion in new or increased user fees and other non-tax
receipts.</p>
<p>Sen. Sasser also is embracing a proposal made by Sen. Kent
Conrad (D., N.D.), a former state tax commissioner, to raise
an additional $11.1 billion for the Treasury by declaring a
tax amnesty of sorts to increase collections of back taxes
and by intensifying Internal Revenue Service enforcement
efforts.</p>
<p>If the committee can agree on a plan and win approval from
the full Senate, the next step in the budget process is for
the two houses to reconcile their approaches and come up with
a budget resolution to guide appropriations and tax-writing
committees. However, talks with the White House on a
bipartisan compromise could begin before a formal
House-Senate conference is completed.</p>
<p>The House plan calls for cutting defense spending by $11.5
billion from projected levels and for raising taxes by $13.9
billion, with details dependent on an agreement with the
president. The budget calls for spending more on popular
domestic programs, such as education, than does President
Bush's budget, and it rejects many of the cuts in domestic
spending that Mr. Bush seeks. "We have to establish what
Democrats are all about," Mr. Panetta said.</p>
<p>In a last-minute change in tactics, Republicans didn't
offer the president's budget for what would have been certain
defeat on the House floor. Speaker Foley called the
unwillingness of a single Republican to formally put the
budget before the House "a quiet, if secret, repudiation of
the president's proposal."</p>
<p>Minnesota Rep. Bill Frenzel, senior Republican on the
Budget Committee, replied that the changes in the economy and
world politics have overtaken both the Bush and the
House-backed budget. "Republicans aren't afraid or ashamed of
the Bush budget," he said. But he acknowledged that some
Republicans aren't currently willing to cast votes in favor
of the spending cuts that the president has proposed.</p>
<p>A spokeswoman for House Minority Leader Robert Michel (R.,
Ill.) defended the GOP decision by noting that Defense
Secretary Richard Cheney's recent comments make clear that
the administration is ready to settle for lower defense
outlays than the $303.3 billion it proposed in January.</p>
<p>Mr. Foley, who invited the president to submit a revised
budget, said that in the future the president's budget should
automatically come to a vote on the House floor.</p>
<p>The House vote yesterday came after the House rejected,
334-90, an alternative crafted by the Congressional Black
Caucus that would have cut more from defense, spent more on
domestic programs and raised taxes higher than the
House-passed budget.</p>
