	<p class="article-leader">U.S. SURGICAL Corp., a Norwalk, Conn., maker of surgical
staplers, said directors declared a 2-for-1 stock split and a
25% dividend increase. The additional shares will be
distributed May 31 to stock of record May 17. The company had
about 11.9 million shares outstanding on March 31. The
quarterly dividend of 12.5 cents a share will be paid June 22
to stock of record June 14. The pay-out is equal to 25 cents
on pre-split shares; the company previously paid 20 cents a
share quarterly. Leon Hirsch, chairman, said, "Continuing
strong sales and earnings gains, and significant growth
potential enabled the company to increase its shareholders'
total return on investment."</p>
