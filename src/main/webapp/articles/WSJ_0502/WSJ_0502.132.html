Supply Inc., Dedham, Mass., for $10 million.
   Temco said it will have a nonrecurring profit on the
transaction of about $1 million, or 19 cents a share, in the
second quarter. In addition, repayment of bank loans with the
sales proceeds will cut interest costs enough to increase
profit by 12 cents a share annually, the firm said.</p>
