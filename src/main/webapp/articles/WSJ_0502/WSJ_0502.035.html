	<p class="article-leader">SOVIETS JEERED the Kremlin leadership, disrupting May Day
celebrations.
   Tens of thousands of people in Moscow's Red Square
whistled and mocked Gorbachev and members of the Politburo
and Presidential Council, turning the traditionally
stagemanaged workers' parade into an unprecedented protest
against Communist rule. The officials left their posts atop
Lenin's Mausoleum, but the demonstration continued for an
hour before it was dispersed by KGB security police. The
crowd's action was considered the most vivid display to date
of public anger at the Kremlin's leadership, underscoring a
growing mood of rebellion in the Soviet Union.</p>

<p>The Senate approved a $3.3 billion fiscal 1990 spending
bill providing $720 million in increased aid for Panama and
Nicaragua. The measure also included an amendment, backed by
GOP conservatives, warning the Soviet Union that new trade
pacts would be jeopardized unless accommodations are made on
Lithuania.</p>

<p>Cheney extended a world-wide spending moratorium on base
construction. The defense secretary also listed 207 projects,
including Navy "home ports" in Texas, New York and other
states, as possible candidates for cancellation. The move
affects more than $7 billion in Pentagon contracts.</p>

<p>The Energy Department plans to resume producing tritium at
the Savannah River facility in South Carolina by late
December or early January. The department had closed the
nation's nuclear-weapons reactors in 1988 because of safety
and management problems, raising concerns of a shortage of
the gas used in making nuclear bombs.</p>

<p>Former hostage Reed underwent preliminary medical
examinations in West Germany, and a special State Department
team began questioning the 57-year-old educator about his
more than three years in captivity. Reed, who was released
Monday in Beirut, was described as "weak and tired." Six
American hostages are still being held.</p>
<p>The U.S. said it was making "small gestures" of
appreciation to Iran and Syria over Reed's freedom, and there
were hints that a release of Arabs jailed in Israel could
lead to the freeing of Westerners. U.S. and Iranian aides,
meanwhile, met in Holland for scheduled talks on financial
disputes arising from Iran's 1979 revolution.</p>

<p>About 150 Jewish settlers obeyed an Israeli court order
and evacuated a complex they had occupied for almost three
weeks in the Christian sector of Jerusalem's walled Old City.
An official, meanwhile, said about 10,500 Soviet Jews arrived
in Israel last month, the largest monthly figure since a mass
Soviet immigration began last year.</p>

<p>South Koreans staged May Day strikes to protest a
crackdown this week on strikers at Hyundai Heavy Industries
shipyard in Ulsan and at Korea Broadcasting Service
headquarters in Seoul. Sporadic violence flared as riot
police were sent to college campuses, government buildings
and industrial sites.</p>

<p>The Bush administration agreed in principle to link future
U.S. assistance to El Salvador to specific progress toward
peace and human rights. The move followed a report Monday by
a House Democratic task force, which concluded that a
Salvadoran investigation into the killing last year of six
Jesuit priests was at a "virtual standstill."</p>

<p>The FDA approved the use of irradiation to control
salmonella and other bacteria in poultry believed partly to
blame for rising rates of food-borne illness. FDA scientists
described using radiation as a safe and effective process
for, in effect, pasteurizing solid foods.</p>

<p>Canadian researchers said the drug THA didn't provide any
benefit to Alzheimer's disease patients in a controlled
study. Separately, two doctors warned that the costs of
caring for elderly people disabled by Alzheimer's, hip
fractures and certain diseases will soar as those over 85
rise four to six times by 2040.</p>

<p>Cambodian Premier Hun Sen concluded talks with officials
in Thailand, saying a cease-fire was a necessary first step
toward resolving Cambodia's 11-year civil conflict. He also
said that the Khmer Rouge must be part of a negotiated
settlement, but stressed that the guerrilla group's older
leaders couldn't return to power in Phnom Penh.</p>

<p>A Mohawk Indian was killed as tribal factions fought a
gunbattle at the St. Regis Mohawk Indian Reservation in
Quebec. The 22-year-old man was the first fatality in a
nine-month-old dispute over casino gambling on the
14,000-acre reservation.</p>
