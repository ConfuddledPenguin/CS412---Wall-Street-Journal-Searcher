	<p class="article-leader">DETROIT -- Ford Motor Co. extended sales incentives for
most of its 1990 cars and trucks, offering customers the
choice of cash rebates of as much as $1,500 or financing
rates as low as 6.9%.
   The latest program, which began yesterday and expires May
31, replaces one that ended Monday. The new 1991 Ford Escort,
which went on sale at Ford dealerships last week, isn't
included in the new program. The cash incentive of $1,000 on
the leftover 1990 Escort was unchanged from last month's
program, a Ford spokesman said.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>There were some minor changes in the program. Ford, for
example, increased rebates on the Ford Probe by $500 to
$1,500 but it decreased incentives on the Crown Victoria by
$200 to $750.</p>
