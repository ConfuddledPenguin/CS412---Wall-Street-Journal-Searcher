	<p class="article-leader">CLEVELAND -- Society Corp. said it settled a shareholder
suit pending against Trustcorp Inc., Toledo, before Trustcorp
was merged into Society last Jan. 5.
   The settlement, subject to approval by the federal court
in Toledo, calls for Society to pay $5.6 million, the company
said.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Society, a bank holding company with assets of $15.4
billion, said the settlement isn't expected to have a
significant impact on 1990 earnings. Society said it is
seeking reimbursement under insurance in force at the time
the suit was filed.</p>
<p>Early in 1989, six shareholders or former shareholders of
Trustcorp filed suit against Trustcorp and certain of its
officers and directors. The suit alleged that misleading
statements about Trustcorp's loan portfolio and general
condition caused the plaintiffs to lose money by purchasing
Trustcorp shares that were artificially inflated in price
because company statements failed to reveal problems in the
loan portfolio. The stock subsequently fell when the bank
holding company made large additions to loan-loss reserves.</p>
<p>In national over-the-counter trading, Society closed at
$28.75, down 75 cents.</p>
