	<p class="article-leader">Kinark Corp. said its board received a $7-a-share, or
about $24.8 million, acquisition proposal from Steel Partners
Limited Partnership, a New York investment partnership.
Kinark shares closed at $5.625, down 25 cents, in American
Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday.
   Kinark said that it told Steel Partners the Tulsa, Okla.,
company isn't for sale, but that its board will consider the
bid. The proposal is the latest attack on the embattled
company, which owns galvanizing plants and chemical-storage
facilities. Altair Corp., Lincolnshire, Ill., has said it is
nominating three directors to Kinark's eight-member board at
the May 23 annual meeting in opposition to Kinark's three
nominees. Altair owns 6.7% of Kinark.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Kinark said Steel Partners has indicated it owns about
4.4% of Kinark's 3.5 million shares outstanding. Steel
Partners, which includes Larry Butler and Warren
Lichtenstein, said its bid is contingent on the group's
arranging financing and Kinark's completing its planned sale
of its hotel properties for $12 million. Kinark had
first-quarter profit of $626,000, or 18 cents a share, on
sales of $8.3 million.</p>
