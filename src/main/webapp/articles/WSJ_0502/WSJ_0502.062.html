	<p class="article-leader">Evidence of increasingly robust economic growth gave stock
prices a little boost while pushing bond prices lower.
   The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 12.16 points to
2668.92 in moderate trading. Long-term bond prices slipped
about 3/8 point, or about $3.75 for each $1,000 of face
amount, while the dollar was mixed. The big May Day holiday
in Europe curtailed trading action in both the bond and
currency markets.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Investors were caught by surprise when the National
Association of Purchasing Management reported that its index
of economic activity for April jumped to 50.2% from 48.9% in
March. Economists had expected only a tiny increase in the
measure of the nation's industrial economy. If the index is
below 50% the economy is presumed to be contracting, while
readings above 50% show an expanding economy. The April
level, the highest in a year, tends to support a view that
the economy and inflation are both picking up steam.</p>
<p>The immediate effect of the purchasing manager's report
was a modest retreat in bond prices, which had risen slightly
in early New York trading. Bond investors have been shaken in
recent weeks by the mounting evidence that inflation is
accelerating. Accelerating inflation is expected to force the
Federal Reserve to boost short-term interest rates sometime
soon and the purchasing managers' report will, if anything,
advance the Fed's timetable.</p>
<p>While they await a Fed move, bond traders are braced, too,
for today's Treasury announcement about next week's big
quarterly refunding auction. They worry that Japanese
investors won't be aggressive buyers since interest rates in
Japan are competitive with rates available here. If Japanese
investors shun the auction, yields on the Treasury issues
will have to rise to attract other buyers.</p>
<p>But if rising economic activity worries bond investors, it
leaves stock investors in a quandary. On the plus side, a
more robust economy could spur corporate earnings to higher
levels later this year. But the higher interest rates that
usually accompany rising inflation increase the cost of doing
business. And if the Federal Reserve really cracks down and
pushes short-term rates sharply higher to curb inflation, the
economy could slip into a recession.</p>
<p>Right now investors are taking a positive view, noting
that International Business Machine Chairman John Akers on
Monday predicted a "substantially improved" performance this
year.</p>
<p>In major market action:</p>
<p>Stock prices rose. Volume on the New York Stock Exchange
totaled 149 million shares. Advancing issues on the Big Board
were ahead of decliners 820 to 679.</p>
<p>Bond prices were lower. The Treasury's benchmark 30-year
issue lost 3/8 point, or $3.75 for each $1,000 of face
amount. The yield on the issue rose to 9.03%.</p>
<p>The dollar barely budged. In late New York trading the
currency was quoted at 1.6808 marks and 158.83 yen compared
with 1.6796 marks and 158.90 yen Monday.</p>
