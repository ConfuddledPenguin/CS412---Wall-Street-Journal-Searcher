	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Over-the-counter stocks shrugged off the
declining bond market and hung on to slim gains in quiet
trading.
   The Nasdaq Composite Index closed up 1.78 at 421.85, a
0.42% rise, slipping from an earlier gain of 2.08. Volume
rose to 124.1 million shares from 105.8 million shares
Monday.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"When the bond market weakened, we hung in there," said
Lance Zipper, head of OTC trading at Kidder Peabody. "The
breadth is a little bit better," he added, noting that
advancing stocks outpaced declining shares, 1,048 to 852.</p>
<p>However, Mr. Zipper and William Sulya, director of OTC
trading at A.G. Edwards & Sons in St. Louis, noted that most
of the day's trading was among professional investors hunting
selective bargains.</p>
<p>Oracle Systems dominated action late in the day after word
spread that the software maker's chief executive officer and
president, Lawrence Ellison, will meet this afternoon with
securities analysts in New York. The day's most active stock,
Oracle dropped 1 1/8 to 14 3/4 on 2.7 million shares, 59%
more turnover than average.</p>
<p>Analysts, who are divided in guessing what the company
will say, suggested the stock fell amid nervousness about the
meeting. Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette software analyst Scott
Smith said in an interview that he expects the Belmont,
Calif., company to report a positive long-term outlook.
Merrill Lynch analyst Stephen T. McClellan said he expects
"some handholding" amid caution the company might not achieve
its short-term objectives.</p>
<p>MCI Communications led the Nasdaq utility index, which
outpaced other Nasdaq industry groups. The utility index
gained 0.8%, closing up 4.84 at 584.42. Peter Coolidge,
senior OTC trader at Kidder Peabody, said he saw buying of
selective utility shares in the wake of a sell-off in that
group amid fears of higher interest rates.</p>
<p>MCI Communications, the day's second most active stock,
rose 3/8 to 35 3/8 after announcing it received a $375
million, five-year contract to provide long-distance services
to the Navy Resale and Services Support Office. The contract
is expected to produce $75 million in annual revenue.</p>
<p>Aspect Telecommunications traded actively after an initial
public offering Monday of two million shares priced at $14.50
each. Shares of the San Jose, Calif., equipment concern
closed unchanged at 15 1/4 on nearly 1.4 million shares.</p>
<p>Apple Computer added 1/4 to close at 39 5/8 after
unveiling a set of products that links certain Digital
Equipment systems with Apple's Macintosh computers and
AppleTalk networks.</p>
<p>Merrill Corp. rose 1 1/4 to 8 3/8 after the St. Paul,
Minn., provider of typesetting, distribution and printing
services said it expects to report record revenue and net
income for the fiscal first quarter ended Monday.</p>
<p>Syncor International advanced 3/8 to 6 7/8 after the Los
Angeles pharmacy service company announced it will buy back
500,000 shares, or 5% of its common stock outstanding.</p>
<p>Amgen jumped 1 1/2 to 65 1/2 after this newspaper reported
yesterday that the Thousand Oaks, Calif., biotechnology
company won a round in a patent infringement suit involving
Genetics Institute and Japan's Chugai Pharmaceutical Co.
Shares of Genetics Institute of Cambridge, Mass., closed
unchanged at 36 1/4.</p>
<p>International Game Technology gained 1 5/8 to 34 3/8 on
199,000 shares, more than four times average volume. The
Reno, Nev., maker of casino games reported net income for the
second quarter ended March 31 was 58 cents a share, up from
24 cents a share a year earlier.</p>
<p>Syntellect added 1 7/8 to close at 19 3/8 after the
company's executive vice president and chief financial
officer, C. Philip Chapman, spoke bullishly about the outlook
for electronic voice processing before a Hambrecht & Quist
technology conference in San Francisco, according to Dow
Jones Professional Investor Report. The company went public
in late March at $15 a share.</p>
<p>FNB Rochester gained 3/4 to close at 11 after announcing
it received an unsolicited acquisition offer. The Rochester,
N.Y., bank holding company declined to identify the suitor
and said no formal agreement had been reached.</p>
<p>Among the day's losers was System Software, which tumbled
3 1/4 to 20 3/4 after Mr. Smith of Donaldson Lufkin pulled
the Chicago software company from the firm's list of
recommended stocks to buy, according to Professional Investor
Report. Noting the stock has risen 33% since December, Mr.
Smith said he expects the company's business to slow in the
second half of the year.</p>
<p>Employers Casualty fell 2 3/4 to 7 1/4 after the Dallas
insurance concern said it's omitting a quarterly cash
dividend for June because of poor operating results in the
first quarter. The company last paid a 10-cent dividend in
March. The company reported a first-quarter loss of 91 cents
a share, compared with profit of 55 cents a share a year
earlier.</p>
<p>Helix Technology lost 1/2 to close at 9 after the Waltham,
Mass., maker of cryogenic refrigeration equipment reported
net income for the first quarter of three cents a share, down
from 37 cents a share the year before. The company also
authorized the purchase of as many as 350,000 of its 2.5
million shares outstanding.</p>
