	<p class="article-leader">Arturo Toscanini, who dominated the international musical
scene for more than three decades, developed from a
revolutionary conductor to commercial icon to posthumous
totem. Now a new generation will have the opportunity to
assess his position for itself as BMG Classics (which owns
RCA) launches "The Toscanini Collection," an ambitious
re-release of all the conductor's approved recordings for
RCA-Victor.
   Scheduled for completion by January 1992 (to coincide with
the 125th anniversary of the conductor's birth), the
digitally remastered series of 82 compact discs (or 81
audiocassettes) will include Toscanini's first records with
the orchestra of La Scala in 1920, his recordings with the
New York Philharmonic and Philadelphia Orchestra, and his
performances with the NBC Symphony, created for him in 1937
by RCA's founder and director, David Sarnoff.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>During 1990, BMG also is releasing "Toscanini: The
Television Concerts (1948-52)," nine VHS videocassettes or
laser videodiscs containing live NBC performances never
commercially available before in the U.S. The first two,
released this month, are a concert version of Verdi's "Aida"
(with Herva Nelli and Richard Tucker) and Beethoven's Ninth
Symphony.</p>
<p>Now, I freely admit to my penchant for heroes, and of
20th-century musicians, few were so generously endowed with
heroic qualities as Arturo Toscanini. Styled "The World's
Greatest Conductor" by the Sarnoff publicity machine, he
looked the part, with his flowing white hair, pointed
mustache and penetrating eyes. Indeed, not until the
ascendancy of Herbert von Karajan was there quite so
charismatic a podium figure as this son of a Parmesan tailor.</p>
<p>Born in 1867, Toscanini played cello at the premiere of
Verdi's "Otello" in 1887, and conducted the premieres of
Leoncavallo's "Pagliacci" and Puccini's "Boheme" before he
was 30. By middle age, having weathered successive stormy
tenures at La Scala and the Metropolitan Opera, Toscanini was
regarded as the supreme interpreter of Verdi and of Wagner:
He was the first non-German to conduct at Bayreuth, and a
recent EMI CD of his 1934-35 performances of excerpts from
"Parsifal" and "Gotterdammerung" with the BBC Symphony show
why. He also was considered the best symphonic man around.</p>
<p>His active repertoire included roughly 600 works by 200
composers, all of which he conducted -- and rehearsed -- from
memory. Renowned for his almost hypnotic power over
orchestras, he could reduce hardened players to jelly with an
angry glance, and his rehearsal tirades were Vesuvian -- one
NBC Symphony musician eventually collected 200 of Toscanini's
broken batons.</p>
<p>Called "The Maestro" or "The Old Man" by those who revered
him, and a lot more colorful things by those who didn't,
Toscanini literally came to represent classical music to a
generation of Americans who religiously tuned into his weekly
NBC Symphony broadcast from NBC Studio 8H in New York.</p>
<p>In any event, his controversial legacy is well documented,
and the first batch in the "mid- priced" BMG series certainly
is solid: three boxed sets including the Beethoven symphonies
(five CDs), Brahms symphonies and selected works (four CDs),
and a triple package including Verdi's "Aida," "Falstaff" and
Requiem. BMG rates high marks for the handsome physical
product, embellished with portraits from Robert Hupka's
famous candid photo series, and featuring learned
commentaries and reminiscences.</p>
<p>The meticulous digital remastering, under the direction of
RCA Executive Producer John Pfeiffer, who produced some of
the actual sessions themselves, extracts as much as possible
from the original grooves. We hear details (musical and
otherwise) that were never so apparent on the 78s or on the
later LP transcriptions. Nonetheless, the sound itself can
never be more than adequate: The 1940s, when many of these
performances were recorded, was far from a sonic golden age
for RCA-Victor, and Toscanini's NBC Symphony recordings are
marked by a particular grainy quality in the strings and a
generally unreverberant ambiance due primarily to the
notorious dryness of Studio 8H.</p>
<p>According to Mr. Pfeiffer, Toscanini himself preferred
this "clean articulate ambiance because it allowed him to
hear everything without the distortion of reverberation."
Even when he recorded in the warmer Carnegie Hall, he asked
that the miking reproduce the dry character of 8H.</p>
<p>But what of the performances themselves? Toscanini's
primary goal as an interpreter was objectivity -- the purest
possible expression of the composer's ideas with as little
intrusion of Toscanini's own ego as he could manage. This
often has been misinterpreted as slavish adherence to the
printed page, which it was not. However, his success is
strictly up to the listener. Hence, while many swear by
Toscanini's versions, others swear at them.</p>
<p>At the high end of the current crop are his Verdi
performances: The 1950 "Falstaff" is a touchstone of
vivacious ensemble work with a nearly perfect cast led by
baritone Giuseppe Valdegno. The 1949 "Aida" (the same one
that's on the video) and the Requiem are almost as fine.
Toscanini's Brahms contains some remarkable readings -- for
example, the eloquent poco allegretto movement of the Third
Symphony. But on the whole, the sound and the swift tempos
often strip these scores of their satisfying warmth. Nor is
Toscanini's Beethoven cycle one's desert-island choice. His
Ninth is superb, with a princely Jan Peerce singing the
fiendish Turkish variation in the "Ode to Joy," but the First
and Fifth are so driven that one feels one's teeth loose by
the end, and his slow movement of the Seventh is, to these
ears, emotionally pallid next to the reading of more
"subjective" conductors such as Furtwangler and the late
Eugen Jochum. Yet Toscanini represents a pioneering modernist
approach to performance, a swing away (sometimes too far
away) from the over-indulgent exaggerations of his romantic
predecessors in search of what he perceived to be musical
honesty.</p>
<p>Much of his work may not stand as definitive nowadays (his
magnificent Rossini overtures, for example, wouldn't pass
muster in light of modern scholarship). Nonetheless, it is
the work of a highly cultivated musician, a brilliant
technician, and a lively spirit. You may love it or hate it.
But you cannot dismiss it.</p>
