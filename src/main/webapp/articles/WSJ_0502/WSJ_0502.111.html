	<p class="article-leader">ENGLEWOOD, Colo. -- Blinder, Robinson & Co. said it plans
to appeal sanctions against it that were handed down last
week by a Securities and Exchange Commission hearing officer.
   The penny-stock brokerage firm, once the nation's largest,
said it plans to appeal the decision of Brenda P. Murray to
the commission and then, if needed, to take "all necessary
and appropriate legal steps" to appeal an adverse SEC
decision in the courts.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>An appeal was expected. Blinder, a unit of
Intercontinental Enterprises Inc., has bitterly contested
regulatory and legal actions against it, and the current case
has been under way for several years. Another hearing officer
ruled in 1985 that Blinder Robinson and founder Meyer Blinder
violated securities laws in a 1980 stock underwriting, and
the commission concurred in 1986. But Blinder appealed in
1987; in early 1988, an appeals court panel sent the case
back to the SEC.</p>
<p>In her decision, Ms. Murray suspended Blinder Robinson for
45 days and barred the firm from underwriting securities
offerings for two years. She also barred Mr. Blinder from
associating with any brokerage firm for at least two years.</p>
<p>Responding to the judge's ruling, Blinder argued that Ms.
Murray had ignored the appeals court ruling and said the
confrontation between it and the commission will continue "as
long as the SEC continues to attempt to justify its
systematic destruction of one commercial enterprise and the
professional career of its founder under the guise of
protecting the public interest."</p>
