	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON (AP) -- U.S. savings bonds will earn interest
at a 7.01% rate from May 1 through Oct. 31, up slightly from
6.98% during the previous six months, the Treasury Department
said.
   Treasurer Catalina Villalpando said the new rate "will
keep savings bonds in the competitive range with other
market-sensitive instruments during the coming months."</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Savings-bond interest rates are changed each May 1 and
Nov. 1 to reflect open-market rates. They are based on 85% of
the yield from five-year Treasury securities, which have
averaged 8.25%.</p>
<p>Bonds must be held at least five years to earn
market-based rates. However, holders of savings bonds are
guaranteed a minimum rate, which currently is 6%.</p>
