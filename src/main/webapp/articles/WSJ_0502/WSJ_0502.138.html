	<p class="article-leader">National Employers' Mutual General Insurance Association
Ltd. of Britain said it plans to dispose of its operations
world-wide in an effort to satisfy creditors.
   The move follows the company's statement over the weekend
to regulators in Victoria, Australia, that it isn't able to
continue paying claims on policies in Australia. The British
insurer, which as a mutual group isn't listed on any stock
exchange, is proposing to establish an arrangement under a
U.K. law that would allow it to sell its assets without the
pressure of a legal liquidation. Australian insurance
officials have begun legal action to liquidate the company.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Stanley Hallowell, the company's managing director, said
that the move was triggered by the Australian claims. He
declined to say what the company hopes to earn from the asset
sales.</p>
<p>The Australian business was closed in 1985. Australian
regulators say the company has liabilities there of more than
200 million Australian dollars (US$150 million).</p>
