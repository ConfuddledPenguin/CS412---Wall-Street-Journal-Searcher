	<p class="article-leader">LONDON -- Media baron Robert Maxwell, after lowering his
lofty sights for a pan-European daily newspaper, is plunging
ahead next week with an expensive gamble on a weekly version.
   The European is to hit newsstands May 11 as a 64-page
weekend broadsheet aimed at affluent, mobile Europeans. The
English-language paper, selling across Europe for roughly 50
pence per issue (about 82 cents), will make extensive use of
color and splashy graphics and will vaguely resemble Gannett
Co.'s USA Today.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The 67-year-old publisher is pulling out all stops on his
most gutsy publishing foray. He intends to spend #10 million
($16.4 million) this year to promote the paper in Britain and
on the Continent -- and may shell out more to deliver a
million copies free to households in the United Kingdom. He
said he has committed an initial #25 million to the entire
project. If needed, "we will put in another #25 million. The
European newspaper will be around as long as Europe is
around."</p>
<p>The European should sell 300,000 copies a week and reach a
break-even point within three years, Mr. Maxwell predicted.
"We wouldn't be surprised if we broke even in year No. 2," he
added.</p>
<p>But analysts, competitors and advertisers remain skeptical
of the European's chances for success. The latest Maxwell
venture, coming after 2 1/2 years of false starts, looks
highly risky. Two-thirds of the European's initial
circulation of 225,000 copies is expected to come from
Britain, a highly saturated newspaper market where ad
spending is dropping and where Mr. Maxwell's last newspaper
enterprise flopped spectacularly in 1987.</p>
<p>The European "won't work," said Hugh Stephenson, a
journalism professor at City University here. "There isn't a
market for it" among readers or advertisers, Mr. Stephenson
added. "I think it {the European} is 10 years before its
time."</p>
<p>He and other newspaper-industry watchers figure Mr.
Maxwell may end up spending between #50 million and #75
million before he reaps a profit from the European. "He is
going to have to throw in a lot of money," said Stephen Rau,
advertising director of USA Today's international edition,
which claims daily European circulation of 38,000 copies
after a four-year effort.</p>
<p>Mr. Maxwell is tackling Europe's increasingly crowded
field of English-language papers. In Britain alone, two
so-called quality Sunday papers have sprung up since
September, sparking a circulation war with the three existing
publications.</p>
<p>The rivalry is equally fierce across the Continent.
Besides USA Today, London's Guardian newspaper publishes a
20,000-copy edition on the Continent that competes with
Pearson PLC's Financial Times, which said it sells 57,858
copies of its Continental version. Other English-language
dailies in Europe include The Wall Street Journal/Europe,
published by Dow Jones & Co., and the International Herald
Tribune, published by New York Times Co., Washington Post Co.
and Whitney Communications Corp.</p>
<p>Advertising-agency executives like the sophisticated look
of the European's dummy version but report that many
companies refuse to advertise in the new paper. "It's more of
a case of wait and see what happens," especially as most
major corporations already have committed their pan-European
ad budgets for 1990, said Catriona Wilson of ad agency Leo
Burnett.</p>
<p>Martin Vernon, who joined the fledgling paper as
advertising director 10 days ago, said the maiden issue has
sold out its 20 pages of advertising. Advertisers mainly are
big airlines, banks and drink makers lured by hefty
discounts. He wants the European to boost that relatively low
proportion of ad pages. Unfortunately, "we're going into one
of the worst advertising recessions in recent times," he
said.</p>
