	<p class="article-leader">DALLAS -- Hallwood Energy Partners L.P. said its offer to
exchange its units for interests in 18 oil and gas
partnerships brought in tenders representing an estimated
$22.5 million in limited partnership interests, or roughly
one-third of the total assets it was soliciting.
   The company said a majority of the limited partners of
Hutton/Apache 1982 Energy Income Fund Ltd. and Hutton/Apache
Energy Income Fund II agreed to swap their $13.9 million in
limited partner interests for Hallwood units, receiving one
Hallwood unit for each $15 of exchange value. In addition,
limited partner interests representing $8.6 million in
exchange value in the other partnerships also tendered their
interests.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Hallwood had estimated the value of the reserves in the 18
partnerships at about $66 million.</p>
<p>Hallwood said it expects to complete its merger with
Energy Development Partners Ltd. and the limited partners
next week, giving it reserves of about 9.8 million barrels
and 142 billion cubic feet of natural gas.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, unit holders of Energy Development
agreed to merge with Hallwood and to receive 0.34 Hallwood
unit for each Energy Development unit.</p>
