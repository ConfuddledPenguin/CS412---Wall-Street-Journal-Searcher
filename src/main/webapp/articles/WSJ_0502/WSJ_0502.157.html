	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- The pound rose against the dollar, mark and
other currencies in a surprising show of strength ahead of
this week's British parliamentary elections, which are
expected to result in losses for the ruling Conservative
Party.
   Relatively strong activity in pound dealings was the most
noticeable example of a trend toward non-dollar transactions,
as the U.S. unit idled against the mark and yen in trading
bands close to 1.68 marks and 158.80 yen.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Participants said tests of both higher and lower dollar
levels against the mark and yen early in the New York day
failed to spark decisive movement in the U.S. currency,
largely because of unusual market thinness following a
holiday Monday in Japan and the observance of May Day in
Europe.</p>
<p>In the vacuum left by the dollar, sterling was the star
performer of the day, making strong gains against the mark
and rising modestly against its U.S. counterpart in defiance
of widespread predictions that the pound would fall ahead of
tomorrow's parliamentary elections in Britain.</p>
<p>The pound's surprising strength stemmed from confidence
that the British government won't relax the country's high
interest rates even in the event of a strong opposition
showing tomorrow, traders said.</p>
<p>"It's a foregone conclusion" that the Conservatives will
emerge from the local elections with some losses, and the
pound's resilience suggests the market has already discounted
the election results, said Raimund Sargent, vice president
and senior dealer at Shawmut Bank of Boston N.A.</p>
<p>Traders said they expect the dollar to begin moving up
once some depth returns to the market today.</p>
<p>"If the market (in New York) was at full strength, we
would take the dollar higher," said Gabriel Grippo, senior
foreign exchange trader at Manufacturers Hanover Trust in New
York. Mr. Grippo cited a surprisingly good reading of 50.2%
from the April survey of the National Association of
Purchasing Managers, well above expectations of 48.9%.</p>
<p>The figure suggests an expansion is taking place in the
U.S. manufacturing sector after 11 months of declines in the
NAPM survey. The number from March's survey was 48.8%.</p>
<p>Other participants agreed with Mr. Grippo's assessment of
market conditions, saying the positive meaning of the NAPM
survey hadn't been compromised by other factors such as a
1.4% drop in construction spending during March, the steepest
monthly fall since a 1.5% drop in February 1989. March's
level was still 3.8% above the level one year earlier.
February's construction spending was revised to a rise of
3.2% from an increase of 2.6%.</p>
<p>In late New York trading yesterday, the dollar was quoted
at 1.6808 marks, up from 1.6796 marks late Monday, and at
158.83 yen, down from 158.90 yen late Monday. Sterling was
quoted at $1.6445, up from $1.6408 late Monday.</p>
<p>In early trading in Tokyo Wednesday, the dollar was quoted
at 158.45 yen, down from Tuesday's Tokyo close of 158.90 yen.
Meanwhile, the U.S. currency was trading at about 1.6815
marks.</p>
<p>The pound surged against the mark after reaching 2.75
marks in New York, where technical buying came in to boost it
above 2.76 marks. The British unit finished New York trading
around 2.7624 marks, above 2.7552 marks late Monday in New
York.</p>
<p>The mark was weakened slightly against the dollar and
other currencies because of continued uncertainty over the
effects of German monetary unification, traders said.</p>
<p>On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for current
delivery settled at $370 an ounce, up $1.60. Estimated volume
was a moderate 2.7 million ounces.</p>
<p>In Hong Kong early Wednesday, gold was quoted at $370.55
an ounce.</p>
