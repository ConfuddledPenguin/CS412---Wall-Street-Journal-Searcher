	<p class="article-leader">American General Corp. is likely to remain under pressure
to put itself up for sale or take other action to boost its
stock price whether or not the Houston-based insurer wins a
proxy vote at its annual meeting today.
   Five out of eight institutional investors surveyed
yesterday said they are voting for directors nominated by
Torchmark Corp., a smaller insurer based in Birmingham, Ala.,
that made and withdrew a $50-a-share, $6.3 billion bid for
American General.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>More ominous for American General Chairman Harold Hook,
two of the three institutions backing management's directors
said they also favor a Torchmark resolution that the company
should be sold. Although nonbinding, a big vote for the
measure could keep management under pressure to maximize the
company's stock price.</p>
<p>Wall Street stock traders say the outcome of the vote,
which may be close, is difficult to predict. Normally,
stockholders favor a challenger who has made a credible
offer. But Torchmark withdrew its bid to avoid getting
ensnarled in state rules limiting insurance takeovers. "This
is a hybrid," said one trader.</p>
<p>Separately, a Tennessee federal court yesterday blocked
enforcement of an order issued Monday by a Tennessee state
official barring Torchmark from soliciting votes for the
contest. The federal court news sparked a surge in American
General stock, which rose $1.125 a share to $40.125 in
composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange.</p>
<p>Before the ruling, Torchmark had defied the order and
continued soliciting votes, arguing that the order was
illegal.</p>
<p>Although only six of American General's 15 directors are
up for re-election because the board has staggered terms,
traders believe a significant minority of dissident directors
can stir up enough trouble to force a sale of the company. To
avoid that, American General might pursue either a friendly
acquirer or a recapitalization or restructuring to try to
boost its stock price.</p>
<p>Just last week, the threat of a proxy victory by a
dissident minority slate sparked the $1.9 billion sale of
Worcester, Mass., abrasives maker Norton Co. to Cie. de
Saint-Gobain, a French glass concern that saved Norton from a
hostile bid by BTR PLC, a British conglomerate.</p>
<p>Torchmark is the third major corporation in the last six
months to use the one-two punch of a bid and proxy fight to
try to break down a target's anti-takeover defenses.
Georgia-Pacific Corp. did so in acquiring Great Northern
Nekoosa Inc., and BTR used it on Norton.</p>
<p>If the vote is close, or if management is losing, American
General may not announce the result for two or three weeks.
If Torchmark loses, the result may become known quickly.</p>
<p>The institutions that plan to vote for Torchmark include:
the Michigan State Treasurer, with 2.8 million shares; New
York State Teachers Retirement System, 1.3 million shares;
Capital Research & Management Co. in Los Angeles, with 1.3
million shares at year-end 1989; Brandywine Asset Management
Inc. in Wilmington, Del., 600,000 shares, and State of
Wisconsin Investment Board, 446,600 shares.</p>
<p>Michigan Treasurer Robert Bowman said he believes the
Torchmark nominees "would do the most to enhance the values
of American General, either by putting together a sale to
Torchmark at $50 a share, or if that doesn't pan out to
emulate Torchmark's good record."</p>
<p>Darin Klemm, an analyst at the Wisconsin Investment Board,
said, "We don't believe that American General has performed
at a satisfactory level, and they haven't shown us a plan to
improve this."</p>
<p>Investors that said they planned to vote for American
General Management included the Texas Teacher Retirement
System, with 1.1 million shares, California Public Employees
Retirement System, with 916,000 shares, and another
institution that asked to remain unidentified.</p>
<p>Joseph Perrone, chief investment officer of the Texas
Teacher fund, said he hopes today's vote will encourage the
two companies to explore a friendly merger "to capitalize on
each other's strengths."</p>
<p>But another holder, who asked to remain unidentified,
objected to Torchmark's tactics in giving American General
only 48 hours to consider its bid before withdrawing it. "We
don't think the future of the company should be decided on
ultimatums like that," he said.</p>
<p>Even though several institutions sided publicly with
Torchmark, the outcome remains uncertain because many of the
largest holders wouldn't discuss their votes.</p>
<p>For example, some analysts believe Fayez Sarofim, a money
manager who owned 6 million shares at the end of 1989, may
vote for American General because he is based in Houston, the
company's hometown. Mr. Sarofim didn't respond to requests
for comment.</p>
<p>Also, an American General employee savings plan holding
more than 4 million shares is expected to side with
management. American General has 119.2 million shares
outstanding.</p>
<p>The largest stock holder, American Financial Corp. with
9.1 million shares, won't influence the outcome because it
has an agreement with American General that its shares will
be voted in the same proportion as shares it doesn't own.</p>
