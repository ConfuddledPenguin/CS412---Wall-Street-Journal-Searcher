	<p class="article-leader">Hit by a decline in market demand from Britain and France,
the Anglo-Dutch truck builder DAF N.V. revised its forecast
for the first half to a loss of between 20 million guilders
and 30 million guilders ($10.6 million and $15.9 million).
   In its annual report for 1989, DAF initially predicted
profit for the 1990 first half would be lower than the
year-earlier 74 million guilders. The expected loss owes
largely to high British interest rates that are cutting
demand for trucks, DAF said, and to a volatile and weakening
pound that is hurting DAF's profitability on trucks sold in
Britain. The company didn't indicate why demand for light,
commercial trucks in France is declining.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>DAF still maintains it will show a profit for all of 1990,
though it didn't specify a sum. It said a productivity
program and stringent profit controls being put into effect
should be enough to lift the company back to profitability in
the second half.</p>
<p>Overall for this year, DAF said, it expects to maintain
its commercial vehicle production at the 1989 level of
58,660.</p>
