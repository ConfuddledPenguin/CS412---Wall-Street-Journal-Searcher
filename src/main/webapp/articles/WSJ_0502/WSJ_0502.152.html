	<p class="article-leader">DALLAS -- Texas Employers Insurance Association, once the
largest writer of workers' compensation insurance policies in
Texas, was placed in conservatorship by the state insurance
commissioner.
   The appointment of a conservator "will enable {the
insurer} to wind down its affairs in an orderly manner,"
Commissioner A.W. Pogue said.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Texas Employers reported assets of $307.3 million and
liabilities of $297.9 million as of March 31. The liabilities
don't include about $57.6 million in deferred assessments due
the state's assigned-risk pool, the fund created to provide
coverage for employers in hazardous businesses who couldn't
obtain insurance elsewhere. The fund is financed by insurers
based on their shares of the Texas workers' compensation
market.</p>
<p>Texas Employers cited its liabilities for the
assigned-risk pool when it stopped issuing new workers'
compensation policies Oct. 1. But the company was unable to
reverse its losses and was placed under supervision by the
state insurance commissioner on March 6, a less stringent
measure than conservatorship.</p>
<p>Under conservatorship, payment of Texas Employers'
policyholder claims will take precedence, and a partial
payment to the assigned-risk pool is possible in two-to-four
years, the commissioner said.</p>
