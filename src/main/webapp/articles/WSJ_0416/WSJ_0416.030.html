	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- For some stock traders, the competition
between Xoma Corp. and Centocor Corp. is a story of mice and
men.
   Wall Street has pitted the two biotechnology companies
against each other in a highly publicized race to market
genetically engineered antibodies used to treat septic shock
syndrome, the sometimes deadly onslaught of infections that
can follow abdominal wounds, surgery and contamination of
catheters. Now treated with antibiotics, such infections are
estimated to strike 220,000 U.S. patients a year, killing
about 80,000.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Xoma's drug is derived from mice. Centocor's is made from
human antibodies, which, according to some investors, will
give Centocor a distinct advantage when it comes to selling
the products. Xoma's detractors also claim that Centocor's
drug is more effective in later, deadlier stages of the
ailment, though complete results of studies supporting those
claims won't be released until May 5.</p>
<p>Of the two companies, Xoma offers investors the best
potential, says Montgomery Securities analyst Denise M.
Gilbert. The analyst recently advised investors to buy Xoma
shares, even though in the long run she thinks that Centocor
will edge out Xoma in sales of septic shock drugs. There's
room for two companies in the market, she says, and there's
little downside risk for Xoma shareholders.</p>
<p>The growing drumbeat from Centocor's fans has hurt the
shares of Xoma, which is based in Berkeley, Calif.</p>
<p>Xoma's stock has dropped 27% from a high of 26 1/2 to
Thursday's close of 19 1/4, since early January. That's when
Centocor executives first told securities analysts at a
Hambrecht & Quist conference in San Francisco that results of
clinical trials of Centoxin, the drug it is developing in
competition with Xoma's Xomen-E5, were "very favorable." At
the same time, Centocor's shares have climbed 22% from 25 7/8
to Thursday's close of 31 1/2.</p>
<p>Simultaneously, the number of Xoma shares sold short has
more than doubled to 1.9 million in mid-March, or about 14%
of the company's total outstanding, from 890,000 in
mid-December. Short-sellers are investors who sell borrowed
shares in the expectation of being able to replace them later
at a lower price. Xoma's chairman and chief executive
officer, Steven C. Mendell, explains that part of the short
selling may have been done by arbitragers who own one or both
of the company's two convertible debenture issues.</p>
<p>Even though short selling often brings with it a whirlwind
of rumors, Mr. Mendell says he's not fazed. "I look at the
short situation as bullish," he says. As good news pushes up
a stock, he says, short sellers usually have to buy stock to
cover their positions.</p>
<p>"I'm confident there will be positive news going forward,"
Mr. Mendell says. "We submitted a complete application to the
FDA and our feeling at this stage is that it can be approved
by the end of the year."</p>
<p>Xoma's detractors aren't so sure. One short seller, who
declines to be identified, claims that a Stanford University
physician familiar with studies of Xoma's drug is convinced
that the Food and Drug Administration won't approve the drug
until next year at the earliest. Xoma, however, says the
physician isn't involved in the studies of its drug. At any
rate, the physician failed to return two phone calls to
verify the opinions attributed to him.</p>
<p>Speculation about when, or if, Xoma will get approval for
its drug isn't the only uncertainty chasing the stock.
Centocor has raised questions about which drug is more
effective in cutting the death rate during the later stages
of septic shock syndrome. Some Centocor holders say they
think the scientific world will prefer human-based antibodies
rather than antibodies derived from mice.</p>
<p>That isn't so clear at this point, says George Farrington,
a senior consultant with Wilkerson Group, a health care
management company. Mr. Farrington explains that the use of
antibodies derived from mice becomes risky if used over a
period of time, as previous studies have shown that the human
body rejects mouse monoclonal antibodies if used repeatedly.
But short-term doses such as the one or two over the course
of 24 hours that Xoma plans to use for the treatment of
septic shock syndrome haven't been shown to have a high rate
of rejection, he says.</p>
<p>The competition between the two companies may boil down to
marketing muscle, according to Mr. Farrington. He says he
believes Xoma's six-month head start in submitting its
application to the FDA will guarantee approval before
Centocor. He notes that Xoma has a marketing agreement with
Pfizer Inc.'s Roerig unit, in which Pfizer gets 50% of the
Xomen E5-sales in exchange for putting its 750-member sales
force to work marketing the drug. On the other hand, he adds,
Centocor may be better able to home in on its market with a
small sales force dedicated solely to its own drug.</p>
<p>Barry Feirstein, a money manager with Equitable Capital
Management Corp., a Xoma shareholder, says he's still betting
on Xoma because of its head start on Centocor. He says he
doesn't have anything against Centocor, but explains that his
fund can only invest in biotechnology companies that appear
to have products ready for market within 12 months.
Centocor's Centoxin, he estimates, probably won't be approved
until next year.</p>
<p>Mr. Feirstein notes that Centocor plans to market Centoxin
itself. While that means Centocor will be able to reap all
the revenue from its Centoxin sales, it will mean heavy
initial start-up costs. He agrees with Roger Honour,
portfolio manager of Alliance Capital Management's $150
million technology fund, that the septic shock sydrome market
is big enough for both companies.</p>
<p>Mr. Honour says he has been convinced by Montgomery's
analyst that Xoma is the better way to play this particular
biotechnology race. Under a worst-case scenario calculated by
the analyst, Xoma would get only 30% of an estimated $500
million market for the early and later stages of septic shock
syndrome. Even then, the stock would trade at $15 to $17 a
share in 12 months -- or about where it has been recently
trading, while Centocor's could trade as high as $40 to $44 a
share by her calculations.</p>
<p>But under the analyst's best-case scenario, with the
companies splitting the market evenly between them, Xoma's
shares could trade as high as $37 to $38 a share a year from
now, while Centocor's could fall to $25 to $30 a share. That,
she says, even allows for the chance that both companies
won't get FDA approval until next year.</p>
