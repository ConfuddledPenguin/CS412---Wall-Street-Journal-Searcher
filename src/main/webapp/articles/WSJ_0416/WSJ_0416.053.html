	<p class="article-leader">THE WELL-BEING OF JAPAN</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Japan ranked highest among a group of industrialized
countries in economic well-being last year but ranked low in
living conditions, a survey by Japan's Economic Planning
Agency said.</p>
<p>In the survey, the agency examined a variety of economic
and non-economic data related to living conditions and
converted them into a numerical score, with 50 being the
average for a group of six nations -- Japan, the U.S.,
Britain, West Germany, France and Sweden. Japan ranked
highest in the group in economic well-being with a score of
60.3, mainly because of its high savings rate and robust
economic growth, the agency said.</p>
<p>Japan's score in the broad category of environment and
safety was above average at 55.0, while family life stood at
55.4. However, Japan ranked lowest in sewage, size of houses
and the number of paid vacation days used, the agency said.</p>
<p>Only 39% of Japanese people live in homes serviced by
public sewage treatment plants, compared with 64% in France
and 91% in West Germany in 1983, the agency said.</p>
<p>ECONOMIC CRIMES</p>
<p>A Shanghai court sentenced four people to death and four
others to life in prison for economic crimes, that city's
Liberation Daily reported. The paper said two others were
given sentences of three to five years. All 10 were tried
together, and their crimes included embezzling, receiving
bribes for signing contracts and demanding large amounts in
compensation from foreign businessmen unable to meet
contracts, the paper said, adding that the graft involved
totaled $274,000.

<p>U.S.-KOREAN AVIATION TALKS</p>
<p>The U.S. and South Korea ended five days of aviation talks
Friday without agreement on major issues, South Korea's
Transportation Ministry said. But ministry officials said
differences were narrowed in some unspecified areas and the
two sides agreed to meet later. Officials said the U.S.
delegation, citing opposition by U.S. airlines, refused a
South Korean request that Korean Air Lines be allowed to add
Chicago, San Francisco, Dallas and Atlanta to its air routes
in the U.S. KAL now flies to Honolulu, Los Angeles, New York
and Anchorage.</p>
<p>AIDS IN KENYA</p>
<p>Almost 85% of a group of Nairobi prostitutes recently
tested were found to carry the AIDS virus, Kenya's health
minister said. The minister, Mwai Kibaki, told parliament the
results were found in a random test of 200 prostitutes by
government researchers, the Daily Nation newspaper reported.
He reportedly gave no dates for the testing.</p>
<p>BUYING INTO A MOSCOW HOTEL</p>
<p>South Korea's Samsung Group will buy 51% of the stock of
Moscow's Sports Hotel, Samsung officials said. The price
wasn't given. Officials said it was the first South Korean
acquisition of a Soviet hotel since the two countries, which
have no full diplomatic ties, began active trade and other
exchanges in 1988. Samsung said it also agreed to provide a
$20 million loan to finance renovation of the 20-story hotel.
Hotel Shilla, a Samsung subsidiary, will run the Moscow hotel
after its renovation, which is scheduled to be completed by
the end of this year.</p>
<p>DUTCH RECYCLING</p>
<p>In the Netherlands, one of the world's most densly
populated nations, about 350,000 cars are consigned each year
to junkyards that are nearly filled to capacity. But an
auto-demolishers' group believes recycling will eliminate
Dutch auto graveyards within the next decade. "We can achieve
this by dismantling the cars, sorting out the usable parts,
and offering them to the {auto parts} industry," Chris
Engelbert, chairman of the Auto Demolishers' Lobby said.
"Tires can be ground up and used in asphalt-road surfacing .
. . and plastic can be recast into new bumpers and auto gas
tanks."</p>
<p>CHINESE BIRTH CONTROL</p>
<p>China, worried by predictions of a record baby boom adding
to its billion-plus population, is renewing its foundering
one-child-per-family campaign.</p>
<p>"Now we are facing the biggest boom ever in the numbers of
women of child-bearing age," said Shen Guoxiang, an official
of the State Family Planning Commission. He said a national
meeting on birth control in February decreed that education
and propaganda be intensified to encourage the one-child
family.</p>
<p>The expected baby boom is a consequence of unchecked
procreation under the rule of Mao Tse-tung, who once called
birth control "bloodless genocide." Only after Mao's death in
1976 were widespread population curbs introduced.</p>
<p>In the year 2000, there will be 340 million Chinese women
of child-bearing age, up 35 million from last year's figure.</p>
<p>POSTSCRIPTS . . .</p>
<p>Members of Earthtrust, a Hawaii-based conservationist
group, said they have persuaded residents of Taiwan's Penghu
islands to stop killing dolphins for food. The
conservationists said they've been teaching the islanders how
to keep dolphins in captivity for tourists. . . . The Soviet
Peace Fund will try to raise funds for victims of the
Chernobyl nuclear-plant accident with a 24-hour telethon on
April 26, the fourth anniversary of the disaster. Chess
master Anatoly Karpov, chairman of the fund, said the
telethon will be broadcast from Moscow on Soviet state
television.</p>
