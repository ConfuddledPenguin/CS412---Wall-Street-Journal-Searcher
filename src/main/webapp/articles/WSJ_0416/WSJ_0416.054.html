	<p class="article-leader">In the rush to integrate the world's economy, one element
has been forgotten: labor. Why? The conventional wisdom is
that labor is a fixed factor because workers do not want to
move. Only those compelled by economic necessity (or
political repression) will leave home.
   But this view is surely wrong. It is roughly equivalent to
saying that the poor have no taste for luxury goods and
therefore do not buy them. If labor is such a naturally
immobile factor, why do we need stringent laws inhibiting
immigration? In fact, workers are prevented from exploiting
the full potential of their labor by formal and informal
barriers to transnational mobility.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Mobility restrictions are least severe for the most
unskilled workers (who may migrate clandestinely) and for the
very top of the management ladder. But for employees in the
broad middle categories of semi-skilled, skilled and educated
labor, the barriers are highly limiting.</p>
<p>The problem of mobility is not the same as that of
permanent immigration. A Briton who wants to work for a few
years in Italy does not necessarily want to become an
Italian. He may just want to make more money, or live in
Turin for a while or broaden his professional outlook.</p>
<p>After 1992, Britons will be able to work in Italy without
obtaining visas. But Americans won't -- nor will Italians be
free to work in the U.S. But imagine a new regime in which
workers would be free to move in search of work, while
remaining citizens of their home countries.</p>
<p>The great differences in level of development, incomes and
labor histories and expectations -- not to mention national
political and security considerations -- might make it
unrealistic, at first, to extend such broad mobility to every
country. But what objection could there be to such an
arrangement among the most developed countries -- say, the 24
members of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and
Development? Roughly comparable levels of development, living
standards, protection of workers' rights and shared
democratic political traditions suggest great possibilities
for cross-national mobility among these countries. The world
might then re-create the kind of freedom to move across
borders that once characterized the Roman world or the
Atlantic community of the 18th century.</p>
<p>To achieve this freedom, simple repeal of formal barriers
will not suffice. Just as free trade has had to be
accompanied by measures to harmonize tax laws, insurance
regulations, product safety standards, copyright and patent
rules and a host of other informal obstacles, so labor
mobility would require the removal of informal obstacles.
That means:</p>
<p>-- A simple and quick system for issuing work visas,
similar to the system that now exists for tourist visas.</p>
<p>-- Recognition of foreign qualifications. What is needed
is not some supra-national bureaucratic classification system
that is unlikely to be effective anyway, but rather a way to
make skills internationally transferable by making them
transparent and translatable.</p>
<p>-- Clear information about and quick access to social
security coverage. (In most OECD countries, social security
also includes health care.) Workers who consider migrating
face intimidating uncertainty about their rights and
eligibilities under nationally operated social security
systems. These systems are highly bureaucratic and difficult
to deal with, and even though in recent years various
bilateral treaties have been reached to ensure that migrating
workers receive proper credit for pension payments, many
foreign workers, one suspects, simply have their "voluntary"
contributions deducted from their paychecks and never
collect.</p>
<p>Simple lack of information is one problem. Providing
proper documentation is another. Why not equip workers with
"social security passports" that would be universally
accepted as documentation, and credit their payments to
workers' homecountry retirement accounts?</p>
<p>National governments have restricted the geographical
freedom of workers. Practical reforms can roll back these
restrictions. Geographic mobility ought to be thought of as
one of the most fundamental freedoms for labor, as it was for
the serfs who struggled centuries ago for the right to work
where they chose.</p>
