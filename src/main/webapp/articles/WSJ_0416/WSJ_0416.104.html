	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- A Food and Drug Administration study
revealed small amounts of a potential carcinogen in milk
samples from two cities.
   The level of contamination, one to three parts per
billion, was termed "tiny" by FDA spokesman Jeff Nesbit.
"Clearly there's no public health risk at those levels," he
added. However, some FDA officials have publicly expressed
concern in the past about levels of the substance below one
part per billion.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The contaminant is sulfamethazine, a sulfa drug used in
veterinary medicine. It has been found to cause thyroid
cancer in rats and mice at high dosage levels. The FDA has
banned the drug for dairy cattle, and plans to propose a
further ban for beef cattle and pigs.</p>
<p>The FDA study found traces of the drug in three out of 70
milk samples collected nationwide. It also found traces of
other sulfa drugs in 57 out of the 70 samples, also at levels
from one to three parts per billion.</p>
<p>The tests were conducted last January after surveys by The
Wall Street Journal and the Center for Science in the Public
Interest found widespread milk contamination by sulfa drugs.
The FDA's latest tests used milk samples from cartons taken
from stores in 14 cities. The three sulfamethazine-tainted
samples were found in samples from New York City and Kansas
City, Mo.</p>
<p>The new findings contradict an earlier summary of the
FDA's test results released in February. An FDA news release
then stated that the test revealed "no residues of any
antibiotics, including sulfa drugs," and said that "no
sulfamethazine" had been found.</p>
<p>"FDA intentionally misled the public," charged Rep. Ted
Weiss (D., N.Y.) in a statement released by his office
Friday. Rep. Weiss chaired congressional hearings on the
matter two months ago.</p>
<p>FDA spokesman Bill Grigg said, "The information that was
provided at the time was what we had at the time." He said
that the FDA's initial concern was whether sulfa drug
contamination was more than 10 parts per billion, the level
at which the FDA is required to take action.</p>
<p>At an FDA advisory committee meeting last October, Dr.
Richard Teske, deputy director of the agency's Center for
Veterinary Medicine, suggested that sulfamethazine could pose
a cancer risk "in the low parts-per-billion range, or perhaps
even in the sub-parts-per billion range."</p>
<p>Experts now express concern about the 57 other sulfa drug
traces found in the milk samples. No hard data show these
other sulfa drugs to be carcinogens. But according to Joe
Settipani, a dissident FDA scientist involved in the
development of testing procedures, "any scientist would tell
you that because of the very close structural analogy" with
sulfamethazine, these other drugs may also pose cancer risks.</p>
<p>Lisa Lefferts, staff scientist for the Center for Science
in the Public Interest, said the FDA needs to extend its
sulfa drug ban beyond sulfamethazine and encourage
development of new animal drugs "so that farmers have safe
and effective drugs to use."</p>
