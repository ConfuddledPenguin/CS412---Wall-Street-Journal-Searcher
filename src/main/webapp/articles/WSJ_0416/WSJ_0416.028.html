	<p class="article-leader">TOKYO -- Japan's wholesale prices in March jumped 0.7%
from the previous month and 3.9% from a year earlier, the
Bank of Japan said.
   The month-to-month increase was the largest since a 0.7%
rise in June 1989.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>A Bank of Japan official attributed the steep increase to
the weak yen.</p>
