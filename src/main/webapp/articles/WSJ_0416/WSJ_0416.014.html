	<p class="article-leader">PITTSBURGH -- USX Corp., in a letter to shareholders,
attacked a proposal by New York investor Carl Icahn to spin
off the company's steel business, saying the plan may not be
tax-free.
   Shareholders are scheduled to vote May 7 on Mr. Icahn's
proposal to split the company's steel and energy businesses,
and give 80% or more of the steel business to shareholders as
a dividend.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>USX Chairman Charles A. Corry cited a study by Robert
Willens, who follows tax and accounting issues for Shearson
Lehman Hutton Inc.</p>
<p>Mr. Willens suggests that the Internal Revenue Service may
question whether the spinoff was made for a valid business
reason, or whether it was a device to raise the stock price,
in which case it may not qualify as tax-free.</p>
<p>Mr. Willens concludes that "there is doubt regarding the
transaction's qualification as a tax-free spinoff."</p>
<p>Mr. Icahn couldn't be reached for comment. He previously
said, however, that his lawyers had advised him that the
spinoff could be done on a tax-free basis.</p>
<p>Mr. Corry also said Mr. Icahn's proposal fails to consider
at least $115 million a year in new expenses involved in
forming two separate companies. For example, he said, the
riskier steel business would have to borrow separately and
would probably pay a higher interest rate than USX pays now.</p>
