	<p class="article-leader">Sumitomo Metal Industries Ltd. said it plans to emphasize
diversification away from the steel business over the next
three years, while working to increase its efficiency in that
sector.
   The company intends to commit 100 billion yen ($632
million) to development of non-steel enterprises between
fiscal 1990 and fiscal 1992.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Like many of Japan's steelmakers, Sumitomo has committed
itself to building revenue from areas such as engineering,
electronics and advanced materials. The industry has faced
stiff competition from other Asian nations.</p>
<p>Sumitomo plans to increase sales from non-steel businesses
such as engineering and electronics to 320 billion yen. The
company's total sales amounted to 1.223 trillion yen in
fiscal 1988, the last year for which final figures are
available.</p>
