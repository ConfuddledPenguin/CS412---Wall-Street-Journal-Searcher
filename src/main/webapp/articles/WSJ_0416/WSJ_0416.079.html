	<p class="article-leader">MGM/UA Communications Co., Culver City, Calif., said a
jump in home video and pay-television revenue and a reduction
in overhead expenses helped narrow its fiscal second-quarter
net loss to $9.8 million, or 19 cents a share, from a deficit
of $14.7 million, or 29 cents a share, a year earlier.
   Last month, Pathe Communications Corp., the main
investment arm of the Italian financier Giancarlo Parretti,
began a tender offer to acquire MGM for $20 a share, or about
$1.2 billion. In New York Stock Exchange composite trading
Thursday, MGM closed at $18.50, up 12.5 cents.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Revenue for the second quarter ended Feb. 28 decreased 27%
to $176.8 million from $241.9 million. MGM cited a lack of
feature films in theatrical release.</p>
<p>For the fiscal first half, MGM posted a net loss of $11.9
million, or 23 cents a share, including an extraordinary gain
of $1.6 million, or three cents a share, from early
retirement of debt. The deficit narrowed from a year-earlier
net loss of $54.2 million, or $1.08 a share. Revenue fell
5.8% to $388.3 million from $412.2 million.</p>
