	<p class="article-leader">Children under age six are more likely to be poor than any
other age group in America, and more than half of them have
at least one working parent, reside outside urban areas and
live in small families, according to a Columbia University
study.
   The study's findings contradict some stereotypes about
poverty as an affliction in the main of welfare-dependent
inner-city children. Only 28% of poor children under age six
live in families that rely solely on public assistance, the
study says.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The university's National Center for Children in Poverty
report called on policymakers and others to view the issue
"through a new lens" and recommended comprehensive efforts to
prevent and reduce the problems of poor children.</p>
<p>In total, five million children under age six live in
families with incomes below the federal poverty line, or
nearly one of every four young children in the U.S.,
according to the study. Another 2.7 million children in that
age group live in "near-poor" families with incomes slightly
above the poverty line. Of the five million poor children,
42% were white, 32% were black, 21% were Hispanic and 5% were
other minorities. Though the largest group of poor children
are white, minorities are more likely to be poor. In 1987,
48% of young black children were poor, while only 13% of
young white children were poor.</p>
<p>The poverty rate for children under age six was 23% in
1987, higher than the rate for any other age group and nearly
double the rate for the elderly. In all, the number of poor
children under six grew by about 50% between 1979 and 1983;
that number has since declined slightly.</p>
<p>The report, which drew on existing literature and original
analyses of data, also noted that though 46% of poor children
under age six lived in central cities, 28% lived in suburban
areas and 26% in rural areas. And though children under six
living with single mothers are more likely to be poor than
those living with two parents, 38% of poor young children
live in married-couple families.</p>
<p>In addition, 53% of poor children under age six had at
least one parent who was working or looking for work, and 51%
lived in families with two or fewer children.</p>
<p>Robert Greenstein, director of the nonprofit Center on
Budget and Policy Priorities, praised the report for bringing
together research that shatters mistaken stereotypes.</p>
<p>"The extent to which poor families with children are
working poor families and the extent to which they live in
rural areas is really not widely appreciated," he said. "The
degree to which most poor families do not live in high
poverty areas in central cities probably would come as a
surprise to most Americans."</p>
<p>The center, established last year, received funds from the
Ford Foundation and Carnegie Corporation.</p>
