	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- The Defense Department's latest spending
plans call for cutting active duty Army troops and front-line
Air Force jet fighters by almost 25% by 1998, according to
Pentagon and congressional aides.
   The budget-cutting proposals, which still must be approved
by Defense Secretary Dick Cheney and President Bush, are
about twice as large as reductions envisioned in the
military's current five-year plan through 1995. Mr. Cheney is
likely to use the recommendations in preparing a long-term
spending blueprint, which would seek to protect high-tech
weaponry at the expense of personnel and existing hardware,
according to these aides.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>But Congress probably will demand significantly faster and
deeper cuts in military programs, especially from the Army,
which under the latest proposals maintains its roughly
one-third share of the Pentagon's overall budget through the
late 1990s.</p>
<p>Under proposals submitted by Army leaders to Secretary
Cheney, total active-duty strength would fall to about
580,000 soldiers over the next eight years from the current
764,000. This would amount to a one-quarter reduction of Army
forces world-wide, according to people familiar with the
details, which were first reported by the Associated Press.
Over the same period, the size of the National Guard and Army
reserve forces is slated to fall to 645,000 from 776,000.</p>
<p>By agreeing to slash personnel, Army leaders are betting
they can stave off deep reductions in maintenance and
training accounts for the remaining troops. They also
apparently hope to save their most cherished acquisition
programs, including plans to spend about $40 billion to
purchase a new generation of light attack helicopters and
untold billions of dollars to develop and field replacements
for the heavy Abrams tanks and several armored vehicles.</p>
<p>Gen. Carl Vuono, the Army's chief of staff, has told
lawmakers that without the new helicopters, the Army "is
going to go into the 21st century with 30-year-old
technology." The light scout helicopter, facing increasing
criticism on Capitol Hill, is being developed by two
competing teams of contractors: McDonnell Douglas Corp. and a
Textron Inc. unit are pitted against Boeing Co. and a unit of
United Technologies Corp.</p>
<p>At the same time, however, Gen. Vuono and other top
Pentagon officials are strongly resisting congressional
demands for faster withdrawals of U.S. troops from West
Germany prior to completion of U.S.-Soviet arms-control
talks. Among other things, Mr. Cheney still has to decide how
large a portion of the contemplated active-duty cuts will
come from Europe over the long run and whether reserve forces
should face proportionately smaller cuts as Gen. Vuono and
Army Secretary Michael Stone advocate.</p>
<p>For the Air Force, Mr. Cheney is putting the finishing
touches on plans reducing the number of fighter wings to 28
from the current 35, according to congressional and Pentagon
aides. A tactical fighter wing has as many as 72 aircraft,
and such cuts would require phasing out well over 300
high-performance aircraft from active duty by the late 1990s.
Previous plans announced by the Pentagon talked about
eliminating a maximum of five such frontline Air Force units
by the mid-1990s.</p>
<p>To try to save its multibillion-dollar plans to purchase
fleets of radar-evading B-2 Stealth bombers, new Stealth
fighters and C-17 transport planes, the Air Force is
considering cutting another 45,000 uniformed personnel by the
late 1990s, according to Pentagon and congressional budget
analysts.</p>
<p>Moreover, Air Force Secretary Donald Rice is leaning
toward putting some of the service's most trusted hardware on
the chopping block, including reducing F-16 production and
possibly phasing out all purchases after 1998 of the fighter
built by General Dynamics Corp.</p>
<p>Taken all together, the spending proposals being reviewed
by Secretary Cheney make up the most far-reaching package of
personnel and acquisition cuts prepared by high-level
Pentagon planners since Communist governments in Eastern
Europe began toppling last fall.</p>
<p>The Navy, which has been fighting hard to keep the budget
knife from its 14 aircraft carriers, is expected to face
smaller proposed percentage reductions in personnel and
shipbuilding accounts than the other services. But Mr. Cheney
has ordered a review of Trident submarine production and has
hinted that as many as 50 older Navy surface ships and
submarines may be retired from the fleet during the next six
or seven years.</p>
