	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Big money is beginning to circle vulture
funds. Now even the traditionally cautious pension plans are
getting into the act.
   Vulture funds, which feed on the securities of companies
that are in or near bankruptcy-law proceedings, have long
attracted money from wealthy people, insurers and Wall Street
partners investing for their own accounts. More recently,
endowments such as Yale University's and the Rockefeller
Foundation have been buyers. And now the $40 billion General
Motors Corp. pension fund has invested. So has International
Paper Co.'s $2.2 billion pension fund.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>At Warner-Lambert Co., "We foresaw there would be a lot of
problems with leveraged buy-outs and felt there would be a
big supply" of troubled securities, says Fred G. Weiss, head
of the $1.3 billion pension fund. Distressed securities --
such as bonds and bank loans on which a company has missed
interest payments, as well as those of concerns in
bankruptcy-law proceedings, among other problems -- had
chalked up an "outstanding track record," he says, so the
pharmaceutical company put $10 million into a vulture fund
last year.</p>
<p>Batus Inc., the U.S. arm of Britain's B.A.T Industries
PLC, also has allocated $10 million to the field, convinced
that "a lot of LBOs would disintegrate over time," says
Thomas J. Hartlage, director of Batus's pension fund.</p>
<p>Most vulture managers won't buy a stake in a distressed
security unless they can expect to make 30% a year, says Mary
Ann Johnson, president of New Canaan, Conn.-based Tremont
Partners Inc., which is organizing a bankruptcy fund to be
managed by several vulture firms.</p>
<p>These expected returns can be reduced by failures and
unexpectedly long waits before receiving payouts. Vulture
investors usually "will get something between 18% and 25%
{annual return}, and that's extremely attractive," she says.</p>
<p>Yet the influx of vulture players may reduce profit
opportunities, some investors say. "You've seen some of it
already," Warner-Lambert's Mr. Weiss says. "There are an
increasing number of players in this, and some of the deals
are being priced more steeply than they would otherwise."</p>
<p>Indeed, some skeptics believe that by the time pension
funds target an area for investment, many of the best
opportunities are gone. "That should tell you that this is
the top of the market," says Peter Langerman, executive vice
president of Short Hills, N.J.-based Mutual Series Fund Inc.,
which does some bankruptcy investing. Attracting pension
funds' interest, he says, "is like being on the cover of
Sports Illustrated. It's a jinx."</p>
<p>With the appetite of institutions whetted because of the
high returns, relative to traditional investing, the air is
full of vulture-fund operators trying to attract investors.
Twenty separate groups have raised a total of $1.07 billion
for funds and partnerships investing in turnaround situations
and troubled securities; they and others are trying to raise
almost $1 billion more, according to a recent tally by
Buyouts, a Needham, Mass., newsletter.</p>
<p>Hundreds of millions of dollars more have been allocated
to distressed securities by investment firms and money
managers such as New York-based Magten Asset Management Inc.
that don't operate special funds.</p>
<p>"Most of the investment banks are building up a trading
capability in this area or a turnaround advisory group or
both," says George Putnam III, publisher of Boston-based
Bankruptcy DataSource, which tracks companies in
bankruptcy-law proceedings. "This is one of the few growth
areas on Wall Street."</p>
<p>But while interest in vulture investing is running at an
all-time high, it is still a drop in the bucket, compared
with other specialized investing areas such as venture
capital. Vulture investing "is growing, but my sense is that
the amount of money seeking troubled securities isn't growing
nearly as fast as the supply of troubled securities," Mr.
Putnam says.</p>
<p>Indeed, despite expectations of a rising number of
distressed securities from high-yield, below-investment-grade
"junk" bond casualties -- and still more opportunities if the
economy swings into recession -- vulture investing is likely
to make up only a tiny part of even the most adventuresome
institutional portfolios. Many pension funds are barred from
holding bankrupt securities or even those rated below
investment grade.</p>
<p>The mere mention of the term bankruptcy scares other
investors, large and small. "We don't use the word
bankruptcies; we always say reorganizations," says Norman G.
Herbert, investment officer for the University of Michigan
endowment, which has allocated a total of $10 million to
three vulture funds. One reason for his emphasis: Companies
in bankruptcy-law proceedings can be hurt by cash squeezes
but often have adequate assets to pay their debts, he says.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, there is no escaping the high risks of
vulture investing. Carefully negotiated restructurings can
blow apart at any time. Assets listed on the books may be
nowhere to be found. Legal proceedings are unpredictable and
can drag on for years before investors get paid for their
holdings.</p>
<p>Veteran vultures say they are taking all this into
account. "What determines risk is the price of a security,"
says David Breazzano, portfolio manager of the Baltimorebased
T. Rowe Price Recovery Fund. International Business Machines
Corp., now trading at about 107, "to me is a very risky stock
at $200 a share, but at $50 a share, there isn't a lot of
risk. What it all boils down to is that if you're buying it
at a price below the asset values of the issuer, you're
probably pretty safe."</p>
<p>Timing also can be critical. Just after Eastern Airlines
entered bankruptcy-law proceedings a year ago, Mr. Breazzano
says, he paid between 40 and 60 cents for each dollar face
amount of some Eastern debt issues. Four months later, he
sold them for about 80 cents on the dollar, despite the
potential for further gains, as the airline was promising to
pay creditors in full.</p>
<p>But those plans collapsed and the Eastern debt issues now
sell for less than 20 cents on the dollar. Because of the
pledge to pay creditors in full, "The people we sold to
thought they were taking less risk, but they got blindsided,"
Mr. Breazzano says, adding: "You can get hammered."</p>
<p>Vultures fall into two camps, depending on whether they
try to gain control of the companies in which they invest.
Control-type vultures buy large enough chunks of a company so
they can install their own management team, expecting to
profit by shaping up the troubled company's operations. Such
intensive work usually limits these vultures to only a few
investments at a time.</p>
<p>So-called portfolio vultures go in for a larger number of
smaller investments. They don't want control, though they may
become company directors or members of creditor committees,
often taking turns in assuming the lead role to stretch their
manpower. Some are even more passive, shunning any insider
role in bankruptcy-law proceedings that could limit their
trading freedom.</p>
<p>Some vultures have junk-bond backgrounds, but veterans say
the investing techniques for the two areas are very
different. Junk-bond holders expect to receive interest and
principal payments on time, while vultures know not to count
on either. Instead, vultures have to be expert in legal
proceedings, because their profit will depend on the outcome
of the reorganization.</p>
<p>Fairfield, Conn.-based Common Fund, which invests money
for more than 600 college endowments, considered buying junk
bonds for the first time last year, but instead put $50
million in bankrupt securities. Fund President George Keane
says he is enthusiastic about the results so far, which
"suggest there are better returns at lower risk with bankrupt
securities than junk bonds."</p>
