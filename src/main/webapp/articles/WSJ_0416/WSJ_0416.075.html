	<p class="article-leader">Sun Electric Corp., Crystal Lake, Ill., called for
redemption on May 14 of its $14.4 million aggregate principal
amount of 8% convertible subordinated debentures due May
2006.
   The maker of auto-test and diagnostic equipment said
holders will receive $1,056 principal amount, plus $39.78 in
accrued interest, for a total of $1,095.78 per $1,000
principal amount.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Holders may, until 5 p.m. EDT May 9, convert their
debentures in Sun Electric common shares at a price of
$11.875 a share, or about 84.21 shares of common per $1,000
principal amount. On Thursday, the company noted, Sun
Electric's closing price was $16.75 each.</p>
<p>As long as the market price of the company's common stock
