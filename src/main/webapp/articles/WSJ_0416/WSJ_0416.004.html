	<p class="article-leader">The newly elected Estonian Parliament enacted a resolution
Thursday relieving young Estonians of their legal obligation
to serve in the Soviet army. Latvia will likely follow next
month. The Baltic Republics' challenge to Soviet military
power suggests that there might after all be something in the
suggestion made by various members of the Soviet government
-- including, it has been reported, President Mikhail
Gorbachev himself -- that the Red Army instigated the
crackdown on Lithuania. While Western analysts have a natural
proclivity -- certainly justified by past experience -- to
discount stories about "hardliners in the Kremlin," this time
these claims might be true.
   The Soviet military does have reasons to make a show of
force in Lithuania. Although the armed forces initially
supported President Mikhail Gorbachev's reform drive, the
political, social and moral status of the military have been
undermined by his policies. Minister of Defense Sergei
Sokolov was unceremoniously retired, along with a number of
senior commanders; the defense budget has been cut and troop
strengths reduced; Eastern Europe has been lost; the standard
of living of career servicemen, officers and NCOs has been
permitted to deteriorate; and the leadership has failed to
control the criticism of the military in the newly free
press.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>There have been signs of military restiveness in recent
months. In a March interview in Izvestia, defense minister
Gen. Dmitri Yazov echoed the criticisms of Soviet defense
policy made by Chief of General Staff Gen. Mikhail Moiseev in
an interview with the army's newspaper, Red Star, in
February. Gen. Moiseev had expressed unprecedented criticism
of the new party program and said that the cuts in the
defense budget might reduce the Soviet Union's military
potential. Military journals such as Communist of the Armed
Forces and the Military Historical Journal have issued
ominous warnings to those who are trying to "unilaterally
disarm us against the aggressor."</p>
<p>The military simply may not be prepared to accept an
Eastern European outcome in the Baltic states, not just
because of the threat to Soviet security, but because of the
threat to its own integrity as an institution. The publicity
around the 500 deserters that the Soviets have rounded up in
Lithuania has created a false impression that the Soviets are
dealing with the problem of desertion for the first time. But
even before the crisis in the Baltics, desertion had become a
serious problem for the Soviet military. The military has
complained for years about the declining quality of its
recruits, particularly their lack of motivation and poor
physical condition. Large numbers of Moslem draftees -- who
by the year 2,000 will provide more than 50% of the available
pool of young men -- speak virtually no Russian. Worse, they
show extreme reluctance to serve.</p>
<p>Outright draft resistance, however, was virtually unknown
in the Soviet Union before Mr. Gorbachev's time. Now it is
spreading. Official figures list 6,647 young men who failed
to register during last spring's "call-up." A number of
unofficial reports suggest that the real figure is at least
twice as high. More than 1,200 Armenian and Azeri soldiers
fled their units and joined their fellow nationals during the
ethnic strife in Baku. According to the Chief Military
Prosecutor, Gen. Aleksandr Katusev, more than 1,000 Balts are
currently listed as deserters.</p>
<p>Military authorities are almost entirely dependent upon
local law enforcement organs to ensure compliance with the
law and punish those who resist the draft. Increasingly,
these organs are reluctant to take action against fellow
nationals. Local political authorities have also lent support
to draft resisters and deserters.</p>
<p>Military authorities complain that local governments in
Lithuania have been refusing to establish draft boards and
that youth are being encouraged to join the republic's new
militia and border forces. A local Georgian party secretary
reportedly responded to a military official's plea for help
in his district with the following statement: "I am with the
people. And the people don't want to serve." In Armenia,
hatred of conscription led to an attempt on the life of the
local draft commissioner.</p>
<p>The Russian republic itself is not immune to the problems
of draft evasion and desertion. In some Moscow districts,
fewer than 5% of draftees reported on the first day of the
"call-up" last fall. Although complete statistics are not
available, the figures for large cities such as Leningrad and
Moscow are apparently alarmingly large. The storming of the
Vilnius Psychiatric Hospital in search of Lithuanian
deserters on March 27 may have been a sign that further draft
resistance and desertion will not be tolerated.</p>
<p>The military is also clearly unhappy about its new role in
policing ethnic strife. In April 1989, airborne units were
called on to suppress a massive demonstration in Tbilisi,
Georgia. Since early 1989 the armed forces have been
enforcing martial law in Armenia and Azerbaijan.</p>
<p>The armed forces' strong show of force in Lithuania may be
intended to relieve them of the necessity of suppressing
similar rebellions elsewhere in the future. It may also be
that the military feels so reluctant to police the population
because it is aware of its inability to continue doing so for
very much longer.</p>
<p>The Soviet armed forces are composed of five separate
services: the strategic rocket forces, the ground forces, the
air defense troops, the air force and the navy, but only some
part of the ground forces can be used against the population.
Most ground forces divisions are of reduced strength. Without
summoning the reserves, these divisions are not capable of
doing much more than maintaining and guarding equipment. But
a reserve "call-up" would require the cooperation of local
authorities -- the same authorities who have already shown
themselves to be at cross purposes with the military. The
January "call-up" of Russian reservists for duty in Armenia
and Azerbaijan was canceled because of strong protests by
mothers and wives, as well as reluctance to report among the
reservists themselves.</p>
<p>The only forces reliably available to the Soviet
government to support the local police and the anti-riot
internal troop units are therefore the combat-ready regular
strength army troops and the elite airborne, air assault and
"spetsnaz" units. Altogether, that gives the government: 24
motorized rifle divisions and independent corps; 24 tank
divisions; five airborne divisions; 10 air assault brigades;
20,000 spetsnaz troops; and 35,000 Ministry of the Interior
troops.</p>
<p>Although this "order of battle" may appear impressive, in
fact, most of the infantry and tank units listed are deployed
in Eastern Europe and in strategically important areas near
the borders. This leaves the airborne, the air assault and
spetsnaz troops -- and these troops, though well trained and
drafted mostly from the Slavic regions of the Soviet Union,
are hardly enough to suppress simultaneous large-scale
revolts.</p>
<p>Many of these troops are already deployed in the
Transcaucasus region to control the Azeri-Armenian conflict.
In Lithuania, the 7th Airborne division had to be utilized
because the only ground forces division in Lithuania is not
combat ready. While the Soviet military may be capable of
dealing with isolated disturbances, putting out many
dispersed fires would seriously tax its capabilities.</p>
<p>The tensions in Lithuania now seem to be subsiding. The
Lithuanians have adopted a less defiant attitude, and the
Soviets have dropped hints that they are open to
negotiations. But once again the interests of the military
may interfere. The 1990 spring call-up began on March 31.
Many young Lithuanians can be expected not to have responded
by the May deadline. The military may then once again be
tempted to use force to reclaim what it considers its due:
the military service of every eligible young man who lives in
those territories it believes to be its own.</p>
