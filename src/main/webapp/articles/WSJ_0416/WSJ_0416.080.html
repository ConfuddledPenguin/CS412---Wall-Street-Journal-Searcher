	<h3>Turkey Ponders Building `Peace Pipeline' --- Diverting Rivers Would Provide Drinking Water</h3>

	<p class="article-leader">ISTANBUL -- Across the barren winter highlands of eastern
Turkey lay range after range of snowbound mountains, a huge
potential source of water, Turkey says, for the parched
Arabian peninsula to the south.
   Two Turkish rivers, the Ceyhan and the Seyhan, flow
little-used down to the Mediterranean, and Turks wax
eloquently about diverting them into a "peace pipeline" to
bring drinking water to millions in Syria, Jordan, Saudi
Arabia and other Persian-Gulf states.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"It's an ideal like its name, peace. It's not just for the
benefit of one country but in the interest of all," said
Tevfik Okyayuz, the Turkish Foreign Ministry's water
specialist. "What we are saying is, let's trust each other."</p>
<p>Unfortunately, trust is as scarce in the Middle East as
water, which is becoming a hot political topic as demand for
it rises. This was clearly demonstrated recently when Turkey
stopped the flow of the Euphrates River for a month to begin
filling the Ataturk Dam lake, the third and largest dam
Turkey has built on the river. Both Syria and Iraq protested
the cutoff.</p>
<p>The Ataturk Dam is part of Turkey's mammoth Southeast
Anatolian Project, or GAP. That project isn't related to the
peace pipeline, which so far had advanced no further than a
preliminary study and a burst of diplomatic traffic two years
ago.</p>
<p>Turkish leaders dusted off the peace pipeline idea
recently in an effort to deflect criticism of its cutoff of
the Euphrates. Plans for the pipeline call for its eastern
and western branches to run for a total of 5,000 kilometers
(3,100 miles).</p>
<p>But the peace pipeline's feasibility may fade from the
utopian to the unreal if its original planned output of 70
cubic meters (91 cubic yards) of water a second drops by as
much as half as southeast Turkey's domestic needs grow,
predicts Dogu Ergil, an Ankara University water specialist.</p>
<p>For many who go for up to a week without running water in
Turkey's big western cities, it is ironic that the original
water export figure is four times the amount consumed by the
seven million inhabitants in the country's biggest city,
Istanbul.</p>
<p>"I lived in Saudi Arabia seven years and never had a water
cut. Now I'm here in Istanbul in the middle of a rainstorm
and have had no water for three days," said an executive with
Brown & Root Engineering & Construction International,
consultants to the peace-pipeline project.</p>
<p>While some potential Arab customers like the idea of the
peace pipeline, the key state, Saudi Arabia, is against it
despite growing water needs, people close to the project say.</p>
<p>Saudi Arabia would receive over a third of the water and
is a main potential source of financing, but is said to be
wary of both the probable $15 billion cost and the fact that
the pipeline will pass through Jordan and Syria. Damascus
showed its lack of respect for pipeline accords in 1982 when
it cut Iraq's oil pipeline to the Mediterranean at the height
of the Gulf war.</p>
<p>"It's easy to say the water is just supplemental to start
with. The Saudis are afraid of becoming dependent," said the
Brown & Root executive, who didn't want to be identified.</p>
<p>But the basic dams to supply the peace pipeline are
already in place in southeast Turkey, the water surplus
exists and the water probably would be cheaper than that
produced by desalination plants -- or derived from icebergs
the Saudis plan to tow in from the antarctic.</p>
<p>So Turkey is biding its time, aware that industrialization
and growing populations are making the Arab world ever
thirstier. Also, regional cooperation is making some headway.
Turkish officials say construction is due to begin soon on a
precedent-setting electricity grid between Turkey, Syria,
Iraq, Jordan and Egypt.</p>
<p>A senior Western diplomat in Ankara said that work on the
peace pipeline was unlikely to begin in the next few years
but that he was convinced Arab needs meant the pipeline would
one day be built.</p>
<p>Added Tony Allan of London's School of Oriental and
African Studies: "Water tables are falling. In Syria, more
ground water is being used than surface water. It's a
dramatically difficult problem all over the region. We even
have a new word for it: hydropolitics."</p>
<p>Nowhere is hydropolitics more evident than in GAP. Turkey
has pledged to keep the Euphrates' flow to downstream Syria
at 500 cubic meters a second, which experts say is about a
third less than usual in recent years. But if Turkey ever
finishes all the 21 dams of GAP, the Euphrates certainly will
drop far more, according to Turkish experts and London
analysts.</p>
<p>Officials in Ankara plead ignorance of the figures for the
Euphrates flow before the first GAP dam started filling in
the early 1970s. But in Birecik, a Turkish town on the
Euphrates close to the Syrian border, everyone knows that the
level has already fallen far in those 20 years.</p>
<p>Several meters above the current level of the muddy river,
Birecik townsman Omer Suleyman runs his hand along the stone
wall of the town's medieval Ulu mosque to show how high the
water of the Euphrates used to rise. "When the river level
reached a black stone marker in the mosque courtyard, we
would send urgent flood-warning messages downstream to
Syria," said the 65-year-old Mr. Suleyman.</p>
<p>Syria should be so lucky now. Even if the floods used to
cause widespread damage, the Euphrates supplies almost all
northern Syria's surface water and most of its hydroelectric
power.</p>
<p>"Syria is stuck . . . . This year's cut was compensated
for and is in fact rather irrelevant compared to the question
of the long-term flow. Lakes equivalent to the total volume
of Lake Nasser in Egypt are filling upstream," Mr. Allan
said.</p>
<p>GAP also includes water projects on the Tigris River,
which flows to the east of the Euphrates from Turkey into
Iraq. But Tigris projects mainly will be hydroelectric dams
that won't divert water for irrigation. Access to the Tigris,
whose flow is increased in Iraq by downstream tributaries,
spares Iraq the worst effects of cuts in the Euphrates. In
addition, Iraqi hydraulic projects at the Tharther basin
between the two rivers aim to further reduce Iraq's exposure
to low flow from the Euphrates.</p>
<p>Syria completely cut the Euphrates' flow to Iraq in the
mid-1970s when it started filling its own Thawra Dam lake, a
move that pushed Baghdad and Damascus to the brink of war.
Repeated Iraqi protests at Turkey's recent cut were met by
Ankara with offers of $800 million of export credits and
remarks that Baghdad should make a water agreement with
Damascus. "The problem is not between us and them nthe
Iraqism, it's between Iraq and Syria," said Turkish State
Minister Kamran Inan.</p>
<p>Representatives of the three nations met recently in
Ankara to discuss the use of Euphrates River water, but no
new agreements were reached.</p>
<p>A hand on the sluice gates of an increasingly precious
resource is well appreciated in Turkey, which has had a hard
economic fight to survive since the republic was declared in
1923. Turkey, a poor country before a boom in tourism and
manufactured exports this decade, has few natural resources.</p>
