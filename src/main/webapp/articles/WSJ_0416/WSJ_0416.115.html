	<p class="article-leader">Lands' End Inc. can't seem to get itself back on course.
   The Dodgeville, Wis., catalog company, which recently
reported its first annual decline in profit since going
public in 1986, said earnings for its fiscal first quarter,
ending April 30, would fall sharply to between $1.6 million
and $2.4 million, or eight cents to 12 cents a share. Only a
month ago, Lands' End predicted first-quarter earnings would
be "no better" than its year-earlier results of $4.7 million,
or 23 cents a share.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The announcement came on Good Friday, when the markets
were closed. Lands' End's stock has been sliding for months
on news that its sales growth is slowing and profit is under
pressure. Some analysts also warn that Lands' End, which
sells classic casual clothing, is losing ground to trendier
catalogs and stores and is being hurt by its own reluctance
to drop tired styles.</p>
<p>Richard C. Anderson, president and chief executive
officer, attributed the grimmer first-quarter outlook to
lower-than-anticipated sales and the fact that more goods
than last year are now being sold at discount prices. He
wasn't available for comment.</p>
<p>But a spokesman said Lands' End is trying to clear out
inventory by quickly identifying slow sellers and marking
down prices instead of waiting until the end of each season
to liquidate leftover goods. He said the company started its
fiscal first quarter with inventories 28% higher than last
year's.</p>
<p>Lands' End predicted that sales for the first quarter
would be "only marginally better" than the year-ago $108
million. The company previously had said only that sales in
the first quarter would rise less than 10%.</p>
<p>The spokesman attributed the slowdown in sales partly to
sluggish consumer spending that has been pinching many
retailers. But, he also noted, "We're working to bring more
new products into the book and make it more efficient."</p>
<p>The spokesman declined to comment on what the poor
first-quarter showing portends for the rest of the fiscal
year. The period is usually the slowest for retailers, and
the spokesman said "we can certainly recover from something
like this." But, he added, "It's really too early to know
what the implications are for the full year."</p>
<p>Even before Friday's announcement, analysts weren't
expecting a banner year. Their profit forecasts ranged from
$1.48 a share to $1.77 a share, representing increases of
anywhere from 2% to 22%. In its heyday, Lands' End posted 30%
increases.</p>
