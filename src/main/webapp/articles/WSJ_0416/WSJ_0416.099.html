	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Laventhol & Horwath, the seventh-biggest U.S.
accounting firm, is reducing profit pay-outs to partners and
planning layoffs, according to Robert N. Levine, the firm's
executive partner-elect.
   Mr. Levine, who will assume the top post at the
Philadelphia-based firm on June 1 but who is effectively
running the firm's operations now, said that a quarterly
profit distribution made to partners in mid-April has been
reduced by half. The reason, he said, was that big litigation
payments have reduced taxable income and tax liabilities.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"This distribution is normally given to partners to pay
their quarterly taxes and since their taxes won't be so high,
we reduced the pay-out," Mr. Levine said. He denied
speculation in the accounting industry that the firm is in
deep trouble but conceded that some layoffs are imminent at
the firm's 51 U.S. offices.</p>
<p>There has been speculation in industry circles that from
10% to 15% of the firm's 425 partners, 3,500 professional
staff members and 1,200 administrative employees, would be
given notice. Last year Laventhol had more than 450 partners.
Mr. Levine said the new reductions won't be as high as 10%.
"We will do what we have to do to make the firm profitable,"
he said. "We won't be dealing with people in terms of numbers
but in terms of performance."</p>
<p>Mr. Levine said that he "is very pleased with operating
results in February and March," which he said exceeded the
year-earlier figures. "Our income is the best it's ever been
and we have satisfactory capital for all our needs," he
added. "We're simply making some personnel adjustments, which
are normal at tax season this time of the year." He said that
revenue for the fiscal year ended last Jan. 31 was about $345
million, up 5.2% from the previous year.</p>
<p>In response to a query, he said that the firm's total
operating profit prior to litigation costs in the year ended
Jan. 31 declined 9% from a year earlier. In the year ended
Jan. 31, 1989, operating profit dropped about 6% from the
year earlier, he said. In the year ended Jan. 31, 1988, such
profit was flat with the year before, he said. "But the
per-partner profit decline is less because of the reduction
in partners each year," he added.</p>
<p>In response to a query that the firm was losing major
clients, Mr. Levine said, "We are looking at our client base
and we are beginning to weed out clients based on risks to
the firm and profitability of the specific engagement."</p>
<p>Mr. Levine denied reports that the firm had lost some of
its bank lines of credit. "We are borrowed up to our full
line with three banks but that's usual this time of the
year," he said. Laventhol keeps major credit lines with
Fidelity Bank in Philadelphia and Chase Manhattan Bank in New
York. A smaller credit line is kept with State Street Bank in
Boston.</p>
<p>Laventhol has been hit by big lawsuits, resulting in
massive pay-outs for allegedly sloppy audit and
financial-preparation work. Last December, Laventhol settled
a class-action lawsuit with investors of several fraudulent
limited partnerships for $13.5 million, to be paid out in
three equal installments over the next three years. Insurance
covered only $4.4 million of the settlement. Laventhol had
prepared audited financial statements for the partnerships.</p>
<p>An out-of-court settlement in Chicago last October with
nine creditor banks in a holding-company bankruptcy
proceeding cost Laventhol at least $30 million, of which
about $20 million was covered by insurance. And in 1988,
Laventhol paid $15 million in an out-of-court settlement of
an anti-racketeering class-action suit, making Laventhol the
first accounting firm to lose a jury trial under the federal
Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations law.</p>
<p>Reports have also been circulating that many partners and
executives in important practice areas are leaving the firm.
Mr. Levine acknowledged that an early-retirement program had
been initiated with a group of partners, and a number have
accepted the offer. "In the Northeast, where our real-estate
practice has been hurt by the economy, we've had staff
reductions that have followed the economy," he said.</p>
<p>But Steven Matthews, a former partner who left Laventhol
on March 1 to form his own actuarial and employee-benefits
consulting firm in Phoenix, Ariz., said that he and three
other partners left Laventhol "because of the litigation
problems." Mr. Matthews joined Laventhol three and a half
years ago when Laventhol acquired his consulting firm.</p>
<p>Mr. Matthews said that Laventhol "has been purging
partners from its offices who were not considered effective
and it's safe to assume that these types of reductions will
continue." He said that Laventhol withheld its monthly
payment of $9,000 in February to himself and the three other
partners who left.</p>
<p>"Laventhol told us that because of the litigation, we
weren't getting our monthly pay-outs because we were
leaving," Mr. Matthews said. "We don't think this is fair,
but we're currently negotiating return of our capital
accounts so we don't want to make problems." He also said
that Laventhol told him and the three other partners who left
that they won't get their April bonus for work performed in
1989 "because of dollars committed to the litigation
reserves."</p>
<p>Mr. Levine said he couldn't comment specifically on Mr.
Matthews's experiences in leaving the firm. "We lost some
people who find they are dissatisfied with a big-firm
environment," Mr. Levine said.</p>
<p>Mr. Matthews, who now heads Matthews, Malone & Associates,
said he knows of seven or eight additional Laventhol partners
who plan to leave the firm because of its litigation woes.
Such problems threaten to reduce earnings and partners'
capital. Several key partners in the consulting and
hospitality practices in Chicago and Boston have already said
they were leaving to form their own firms or join other
organizations.</p>
<p>Almost all major accounting firms are experiencing profit
pressures, with revenue growth for the major firms slowing to
12.8% in 1989 from 17.25% a year earlier, according to
Bowman's Accounting Report. Thus, Laventhol's added
litigation woes have only decreased its ability to cope with
the already existing challenges of slower revenue growth and
increased competition, said Arthur Bowman, publisher of the
Atlanta-based newsletter.</p>
