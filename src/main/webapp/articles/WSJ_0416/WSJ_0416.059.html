	<p class="article-leader">NORWALK, Conn. -- Gateway Financial Corp. said its Gateway
Bank subsidiary took over Columbia Federal Savings Bank, a
failed Westport, Conn., thrift.
   Under an agreement with Resolution Trust Corp., the
government agency that manages failed thrifts, Gateway is
assuming all Columbia deposits and secured liabilities, which
total about $149 million.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Gateway also is assuming $114.7 million of Columbia's
assets, including about $87.9 million in residential mortgage
and consumer loans as well as $24.6 million in cash and
securities, the government said.</p>
<p>Gateway isn't acquiring any of Columbia's currently
identified non-performing loans, nor is Gateway paying any
cash to take over the troubled thrift. The government will
pay Gateway about $40 million and will keep about $8.7
million of Columbia's assets.</p>
<p>Columbia Federal has been in conservatorship under the
U.S. government since February 1989. Gateway will reopen all
six branches of Columbia Federal as Gateway branches today.
Before the takeover, Gateway had 23 branches in Fairfield
County.</p>
<p>Gateway, which has about $1.4 billion in assets and a
capital ratio of more than 8%, said the takeover would
increase its market share and broaden its geographical
coverage.</p>
