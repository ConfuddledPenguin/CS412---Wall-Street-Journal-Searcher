	<p class="article-leader">LOS ANGELES -- First Executive Corp. said its Executive
Life Insurance Co. subsidiary acquired several real estate
projects from FPA Corp., a Huntingdon Valley, Pa., real
estate developer, in exchange for FPA debt totaling $39.7
million.
   Executive Life said it plans to sell the properties. The
FPA debt includes $21.3 million principal amount of 12 5/8%
senior notes due 1993 and $18.5 million principal amount of
14 1/2% subordinated debentures due 2000.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The properties include 45 single-family lots and two model
homes in Boca Raton, Fla., 47 acres of undeveloped property
within the Boca Golf & Tennis Club and 600 acres of
undeveloped land at Palm-Aire Country Club, Sarasota, Fla.
Executive Life also acquired three condominium apartment
sites in Pompano, Fla., a newly issued $4 million seven-year
subordinated note bearing interest at the prime rate, and a
three-year option to acquire 400,000 shares of FPA at $4 a
share under certain circumstances.</p>
<p>Fred Carr, First Executive's chairman and chief executive
officer, said the two FPA debt issues hadn't been written
down and weren't in default.</p>
<p>Worries have widened about First Executive and Executive
Life because of their large junk-bond holdings. First
Executive units held $8.05 billion of junk bonds, of which
$244.9 million was in or near default as of December,
according to documents filed with state insurance
commissions.</p>
