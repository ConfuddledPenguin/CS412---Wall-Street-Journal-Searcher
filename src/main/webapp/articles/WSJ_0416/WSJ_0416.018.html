	<p class="article-leader">Landmark Land Co. has entered into an agreement to sell
much of its real estate and resort holdings to California
developer Barry G. Hon, in a deal that could have a value of
as much as $967 million, according to people close to
Landmark.
   The sale, one of the largest real estate transactions this
year, would involve most of Landmark's premier golf-centered
resorts, which include PGA West, La Quinta and Mission Hills,
all located in the Palm Springs area.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Landmark, a thinly traded land and golf-course development
company based in Carmel, Calif., is 28%-owned by its chairman
Gerald G. Barton and 24%-owned by Olympia & York Developments
Ltd., the Toronto conglomerate controlled by the Reichmann
brothers.</p>
<p>The agreement is expected to be announced today.</p>
<p>Landmark's real estate holdings are owned through its
savings and loan subsidiary, Oak Tree Savings, which is based
in New Orleans. The sale was triggered by the Financial
Institutions Reform, Recovery and Enforcement Act of 1989,
which raised the amount of capital that savings and loans had
to have in order to stay in the real estate business. As a
result of the act, a number of savings and loans have sold
their real estate at deflated prices.</p>
<p>The sale to Mr. Hon, an Irvine, Calif., home builder and
land developer, appears to be fully valued. Mr. Hon's
company, Palos Verdes Land Holdings Inc., is best known for
developing the 2,743-acre Foot Hill Ranch in South Orange
County. When complete, the project will include 3,900 housing
units and approximately eight million square feet of office
and retail space. Mr. Hon couldn't be reached for comment.</p>
<p>Mr. Hon also reportedly owns 1,200 acres along the Palos
Verdes Peninsula, and is in the process of obtaining
development approvals for a planned community there.</p>
<p>"Most of the thrift real estate sales we're seeing are
selling at below book value," said Jack Rodman, managing
partner at Kenneth Leventhal & Co., a Los Angeles-based
accounting firm that advised Landmark. "The Landmark deal has
a 50% premium over book value, which is unusual in itself."</p>
<p>Landmark stock jumped $2.125 a share to close at $17.50 in
American Stock Exchange composite trading Thursday, in
relatively heavy trading of 143,800 shares.</p>
<p>"It sounds like this deal could bail out their S&L," said
Kenneth Campbell, president of Audit Investments Inc., a
Montvale, N.J., investment advisory firm that follows real
estate companies. "I had always assumed the buyer would be
Japanese, since they're the ones paying the big numbers for
golf courses these days."</p>
<p>Mr. Rodman said he expects Japanese companies to purchase
individual properties from Mr. Hon after the deal closes. No
Japanese purchaser emerged to buy the entire portfolio, he
said, because of the downturn in Japanese financial markets.</p>
<p>Under the agreement, Mr. Hon would purchase the first part
of the portfolio in the second quarter for $497 million,
which would generate a gross pretax profit of about $270
million. Mr. Hon would also have the option to purchase a
second portfolio of properties in the second quarter of 1991
for $470 million. That sale would generate a gross pretax
profit of $200 million.</p>
<p>Properties in the first phase include Landmark's Oak
Valley, Oak Summit, Greenspot and Moreno Valley Ranch
developments in California. Also included is the Carmel
Valley Ranch Resort, which Landmark had agreed to sell to
American International Golf Resorts Inc. for $60 million last
month. Mr. Hon would purchase the contract on that property
from American International.</p>
<p>The second phase would include properties in Kiawah
Island, S.C.; West Palm Beach, Fla.; and Riverside and Placer
counties, Calif.</p>
<p>Three quarters of the financing would be provided by
Landmark.</p>
<p>The sale would leave the company with about $400 million
in real estate remaining in California, Oklahoma and
Louisiana. Most of those properties will be disposed of over
the next five years, said people close to the company.</p>
<p>While many of Landmark's properties have received high
marks for their beauty and design, the company's fortunes
have sagged along with the economies of Oklahoma and
Louisiana. Even many of its golf courses that are considered
among the world's best have had negative cash flow, said Mr.
Campbell.</p>
<p>The company posted a fourth-quarter loss of $20.5 million,
or $2.57 a share, in contrast to profit of $16.9 million, or
$2.09 a share, a year earlier.</p>
