	<p class="article-leader">Myriad groups are volunteering to bless certain products
with environmental seals of approval. But their altruistic
gestures toward the Earth may only muddy up the issue.
   A hodgepodge of federal, state and private
product-labeling initiatives promise to point consumers
toward goods that are recycled, recyclable, less polluting or
less wasteful. Proponents of such product endorsements,
similar to the Good Housekeeping Seal, say labels would
motivate consumers to make better choices and thereby
pressure industry to make fundamental changes in product and
packaging design.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>But others fear too many labels could frustrate consumers,
and thus frustrate the environmental effort. "We will defeat
the whole purpose if we confuse consumers with so many
conflicting labels," says Jeanne Wirka, an analyst with the
Environmental Action Foundation, a Washington-based advocacy
group.</p>
<p>The labeling idea is also a controversial one because one
person's notion of "environmentally sound" may not match
another's. An environmental label could leave itself open to
claims that it is unfair or misleading. The American Heart
Association ran into such a problem recently with its
ill-fated attempt at food labeling, a program that was
canceled almost as soon as it was announced.</p>
<p>Government officials and some environmentalists are
concerned that private seal programs, such as one announced
last Friday by four grocery-store chains, may be rushing to
cash in on Earth Day-related publicity. "The public shouldn't
be misled into thinking that a green seal is going to
eliminate confusion," says Barry J. Cutler, director of the
Federal Trade Commission's bureau of consumer protection.</p>
<p>Environmental labeling projects are plowing ahead,
nonetheless. Green Seal Inc., a private, nonprofit group
headed by Earth Day organizer Denis Hayes, hopes to launch a
national environmental-labeling program later this year. Mr.
Hayes says an independent board of scientists would set
standards and award seals to products causing "significantly"
less damage during manufacture, use and disposal.
Participation would be voluntary, with manufacturers paying
fees to wear the seal and have products tested by independent
laboratories.</p>
<p>Simultaneously, Sen. Frank R. Lautenberg (D., N.J.) has
drafted legislation that would make the Environmental
Protection Agency review products and award a federal seal.
EPA officials, meanwhile, say they may include a separate
labeling initiative in proposed pollution-prevention
legislation.</p>
<p>At the state level, two groups are working to establish
package-labeling regulations this year for adoption by 10
Northeast states, from Maine to Delaware. The Coalition of
Northeastern Governors and the Northeast Recycling Council
are drafting standards for labeling packaging, and possibly
products, as recyclable, reusable, recycled or
waste-reducing.</p>
<p>Not waiting for others, some retail chains, such as
Wal-Mart Stores Inc. and Loblaw Cos., have adopted their own
environmental labeling.</p>
<p>Jumping on the bandwagon last week were four Western
supermarket chains, which together announced a Green Cross
labeling program. The supermarkets, including Ralphs Grocery
Co., a California chain, say strict standards developed by a
private consultant will help promote recycling and reduce
confusion over misleading claims. Products and packaging will
have to contain at least 50% recycled consumer waste to
receive recycling seals, for instance. To win a Green Cross
environmental seal, products must fulfill recycling
requirements and the manufacturing process must not emit any
known carcinogens or chemicals causing birth defects, or
violate pollution laws.</p>
<p>Some help in sorting through the labeling mess may come
within two to three months: The Federal Trade Commission and
an eight-state task force are expected to develop uniform
labeling guidelines as part of a continuing investigation of
manufacturers' environmental claims. Such guidelines would
help to clean up "a proliferation of different seals and
labels," says New York Attorney General Robert Abrams. The
threat of FTC action recently prompted Mobil Corp. to
announce that it will stop making "degradable" claims for its
Hefty trash bags. Other products are likely to follow suit.</p>
<p>Although the guidelines will mostly help consumers choose
products that generate less waste when thrown out, they
probably won't address pollution caused by manufacture and
use. That's why Green Seal is proposing a complex
"cradle-to-grave" analysis of products. Industry critics,
however, say it would be difficult to make this
scientifically accurate without being impractical or
confusing. "We are extremely concerned that these
(seal-of-approval) programs could potentially make the
situation much worse," says Deborah D. Anderson,
environmental coordinator for Procter & Gamble Co., the
Cincinnati-based consumer-products giant.</p>
<p>Much is at stake if consumers reject products that don't
get seals. P&G, which controls nearly half the $3.5 billion
U.S. market for disposable diapers, disputes Canada's recent
decision approving cloth diapers over disposables as "lacking
critical data," Ms. Anderson says.</p>
<p>Inconsistency looms as the biggest potential problem, both
sides agree. If labeling among different agencies and
organizations conflicts, there is a danger that consumers
might ignore the labels or that manufacturers might refuse to
submit their products for approval in voluntary programs.</p>
<p>In which direction to go is another issue. At the state
level alone there are disagreements over the best ways to
encourage recycling and waste-reduction. The Northeast states
are considering a proposal that would prohibit companies from
calling their packages "recyclable" unless the material was
actually being recycled at a rate of 50%. At current
recycling rates, only aluminum containers would qualify.</p>
<p>Environmentalists say this high threshold would force
industry to rapidly expand collection and recycling programs
for glass, plastic and paper. But industry and some state
officials argue that a 50% standard would actually discourage
recycling because few products would qualify for labels that
would help consumers identify packaging that is recyclable.
New York state has proposed a 25% recycling standard as a
"reasonable compromise," says William Colden, chief of waste
reduction and recycling at New York's Department of
Environmental Conservation.</p>
<p>The Northeast states are also considering a requirement
that any plastic packaging labeled "recycled" contain at
least 25% recycled material, including 15% from consumer
waste. Industry officials say that standard is too high and
would worsen a shortage of recycled plastic. "We can't get
enough now to meet our needs," says Tom Rattray, a packaging
official at P&G.</p>
<p>P&G also worries that such rules might not recognize some
products it feels are deserving, such as the Downy
fabric-softener concentrate it is test marketing. Although it
isn't recyclable, the small carton cuts packaging waste 75%
because of its size, and therefore deserves a stamp of
approval, the company believes.</p>
<p>William Ferretti, a New York state official who heads the
labeling initiative for the Coalition of Northeastern
Governors, says it's too early to predict the final
recommendations to the 10 states, but a labeling conference
will be held in June in hopes of reaching a consensus.</p>
<p>"We want a national symbol, rather than each state having
its own labeling program," says Rod Lowman of the Council for
Solid Waste Solutions, which represents the packaging
industry.</p>
<p>Although many environmentalists say government should
enforce minimum standards for package labeling and
advertising, some draw the line when it comes to approving
products with seals. Green Seal, for instance, says a private
program could approve products more rapidly and wouldn't be
subject to political pressures. Indeed, an Environmental
Protection Agency consultant recently recommended that a
labeling program be run by an independent organization, not
the EPA.</p>
<p>To avoid delays, Green Seal says it might initially
endorse products whose benefits are undisputed, such as
recycled motor oil, toilet tissue made from 100% recycled
paper and super-efficient light bulbs, Mr. Hayes says. To
ensure credibility, the group won't accept industry funding
or allow anyone with vested interests to participate in
decisions. So far, directors of Green Seal have raised about
$120,000 toward a $700,000 first-year budget, Mr. Hayes says.</p>
<p>EPA Deputy Administrator F. Henry Habicht says his
agency's main concern, likewise, is ensuring that criteria
for awarding seals are "reliable and objective." One option
is to have EPA provide funding and establish or review the
criteria, but leave decisions to an independent group, Mr.
Habicht says.</p>
