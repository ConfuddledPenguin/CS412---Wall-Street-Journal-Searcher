	<p class="article-leader">Reader Henry R. Friedberg (letters, March 29) accuses
British historian Paul Johnson of being blind to history when
he (Mr. Johnson) asserts that we need not fear a united
Germany. Mr. Friedberg then informs us, "Germans have been
aggressive since they first appeared in history." Also, he
appears to single out West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl's
refusal to guarantee the Oder-Neisse Line as the Polish
border in advance of a peace conference as evidence of German
aggressive intentions. Perhaps it is Mr. Friedberg who is
blind to history.
   He gives us no evidence of the aggressive nature of
Germans. Maybe he has in mind World Wars I and II. If so,
does he believe history began with the advent of the 20th
century? Is he not aware that the Soviet Union, as we know it
today, came about through military conquests? Has he never
heard of Napoleon Bonaparte and his wars of aggression?
(Perhaps he was actually a German in disguise.) Who put
together the largest overseas empire the world has seen if
not Britain? Or does Mr. Friedberg imagine that the colonials
welcomed British rule? Many more specific examples of
non-German aggression could be cited. What history tells us,
even if it fails to inform Mr. Friedberg, is that every
nation in Europe, at one time or another, has warred upon its
neighbors.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Also, Mr. Friedberg, with his knowledge of history, should
be aware of why Germans might reasonably object to the
Oder-Neisse Line as the Polish border. After all, beyond that
line lie territories that have been populated by Germans,
governed by Germans, and infused with German customs and
culture for 800 years. In contrast, consider that the first
English settlement in what is now the United States was
established about 400 years ago. Imagine, for a moment, how
we Americans would feel if all of our lands east of the
Appalachian Mountains were confiscated and placed under a
foreign government.</p>
<p>But Mr. Friedberg no doubt would say that Germany should
pay for the destruction and loss of life it caused in World
War II, and that is true and that is the purpose of
reparations. The German government has accepted this burden
and paid hundreds of millions of deutsche marks in
compensation to both individuals and other governments and is
committed to paying many millions more in the future. What is
generally not known is that West Germany has given far more
humanitarian assistance in direct financial grants and
in-kind assistance to Poland than any other Western country.
And, no doubt, it will pay reparations to Poland and other
countries long after the conclusion of a peace treaty. But
have a part of its territory confiscated? That is reparations
forever]</p>
<p>It is often said that Adolf Hitler was not born in
Braunau, Austria, his natural birthplace, but at Versailles.
The Treaty of Versailles humiliated and impoverished the
German people and laid the groundwork for World War II. What
is now needed to conclude a just World War II treaty and
establish lasting peace is statesmanship; what we are likely
to get is a political settlement that repeats the errors of
the past.</p>
<p>Whatever the outcome of peace negotiations, I believe it
highly unlikely that a future conflict will be instigated by
the Germans. Anti-war sentiment in Germany is very strong.
But if that unfortunate event should come to pass, a future
historian of Mr. Friedberg's insight can again place the
blame on German aggression rather than seeking out the root
causes of the conflict.</p>

<p>As a West German citizen I am proud of the recent
developments in our Eastern brother country and feel very
offended by Mr. Friedberg's letter. "Vae victis" still seems
to be the motto of this outdated hard-liner.</p>
<p>Anyone seriously versed in European current events is
cognizant of the naivete of statements justifying a military
threat by a reunified Germany toward Europe. Any military
strategist with only limited insight and experience will
inform Mr. Friedberg about the improbability -- the
impossibility -- of conquering Europe with an army of 600,000
troops. West Germany, in opposition to suggestions and
encouragements from NATO and in particular from the U.S. to
increase the size of its army, is in fact about to reduce the
number of its troops. It is interesting to note that in the
postwar era the relationship between West Germany and its
NATO partners has strengthened to such an extent that the
trust and confidence implied in a suggestion for military
increases supersede any apprehension of a military threat.</p>
<p>With regard to Mr. Friedberg's concern about Germany's
military aggressiveness, a quick review of West Germany's
military behavior demonstrates nonaggression toward any group
or nation.</p>
<p>It is time for people like Mr. Friedberg to rid themselves
of their archaic/slanted view of the German people and admit
to the friendship and political bond that have developed
between our two nations. The foundation of both our
countries' constitutions is rooted in democracy, an
inalienable freedom that recent history has demonstrated
cannot be suppressed.</p>
