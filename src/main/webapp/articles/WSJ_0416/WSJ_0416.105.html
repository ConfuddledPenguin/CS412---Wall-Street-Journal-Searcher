	<p class="article-leader">LITHUANIA FAILED to meet a Kremlin deadline to end its
independence bid.
   Leaders of the breakaway Baltic republic ignored
Gorbachev's ultimatum, made Friday, to rescind within 48
hours laws promoting secession or face the cutoff of supplies
of major products. The Soviet president didn't specify what
materials, but Lithuania buys oil and natural gas only from
Moscow. It wasn't clear how the Kremlin, which has declared
illegal the republic's March 11 proclamation of independence,
would implement the economic blockade. In Soviet Armenia, Red
Army tanks and armored vehicles rolled through Yerevan after
a crowd tried to storm KGB headquarters.</p>

that Lithuania would achieve independence through
"respectful" talks with Moscow.</p>

<p>The Pentagon's spending plans call for cutting active duty
Army troops and frontline Air Force jet fighters by almost
25% by 1998, according to Defense Department and
congressional aides. The latest proposals are about twice as
large as reductions envisioned in the military's current
five-year plan through 1995.</p>

<p>Police in China arrested a lone protester in Beijing's
Tiananmen Square as he attempted to lay a wreath with an
inscription to "heroes who died for democracy." The arrest
came on the first anniversary of former Communist Party chief
Hu's death. Hundreds of police patrolled the capital's plaza
to discourage other shows of dissent.</p>

<p>Black factional fighting raged in South Africa's Natal
province, despite tight security measures. Police said 20
people were killed in the latest clashes. In Britain, black
nationalist Mandela arrived for a visit to London and ignored
an invitation to meet with Prime Minister Thatcher, who has
eased anti-apartheid sanctions on Pretoria.</p>
<p>South Africa's de Klerk plans to make a "statement of
intent" this week to eliminate remaining apartheid laws, the

hold black-white power-sharing talks with the African
National Congress next month.</p>

<p>Protesters in Nepal stormed an academy in Katmandu, where
opposition and government leaders opened talks about
revamping the Himalayan nation's political system. Police
confronted the demonstrators demanding immediate freedom and
democracy.</p>

<p>India's security forces clashed with Moslem militants in
the disputed Kashmir region. The Kashmiri independence drive
has prompted India and Pakistan to accuse each other of
trying to provoke a war. In New Delhi, police issued a
warning for the public to be on the lookout for bombs. Three
devices have exploded in the past week.</p>

<p>Bush and Thatcher held a day of talks Friday in Bermuda
that focused on EastWest relations and the future of NATO
amid the changes sweeping Eastern Europe. The two leaders

president described as "deeply disturbing."</p>

<p>The Bush administration eased visa restrictions on
foreigners infected with the AIDS virus, allowing the
visitors to attend certain conferences on special 10-day

moving to end a policy that activists consider
discriminatory.</p>

<p>A Columbia University study found that children under age
six are more likely to be poor than any other U.S. age group,
and more than half have at least one working parent and
reside outside urban areas. The findings contradict some
stereotypes about poverty as an affliction of
welfare-dependent inner-city children.</p>

<p>NASA installed a new auxiliary power unit in the space
shuttle Discovery and began recharging the batteries of the
Hubble Space Telescope. The spacecraft is scheduled to lift

placed in orbit, the telescope will be used to study stars
and galaxies at the edge of the universe.</p>

<p>An FDA study found small amounts of a potential carcinogen
in milk samples from New York City and Kansas City, Mo. The

spokesman, who said there wasn't any health risk. But the
findings contradict an earlier summary of the FDA's test
results released in February.</p>

<p>Rebel Philippine soldiers threatened to do battle with the
U.S. if Washington intervenes in the country's affairs. In a

who can't implement political change.</p>
