	<div class="article-body"><p>Some always look to the future,</p>
<p>Obsessed with the "if and when";</p>
<p>Others elect to dwell in the past --</p>
<p>The nostalgic "there and then."</p>
<p>There are also those more fortunate ones</p>
<p>Who have learned the secret how</p>
<p>To make the most of the present --</p>
<p>The fleeting "here and now."</p>

<p>There's one thing on envelopes</p>
<p>I've been seeing of late:</p>
<p>If it is stamped "Urgent]"</p>
<p>Then I know it can wait.</p>
