	<p class="article-leader">PARIS (AP) -- A drug company halted production at its
factory and ordered its products removed from drugstore
shelves after tests indicated contamination of some of its
medicine with sulfuric acid.
   Smith Kline & French, a subsidiary of the
British-U.S.company SmithKline Beecham PLC, said it was
suspending all exports of Zentel, an anti-parasite medicine
sold in many African, Asian and South American countries
under the name Albendazole.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The company said traces of sulfuric acid were found in a
bottle of Zentel after threats by an unknown person demanding
$1 million. The firm said efforts would be made to recall
Zentel shipped overseas since the first threat was made in
early April.</p>
<p>Zentel is produced only for export, but the company
announced a temporary halt to production of all medicine at
its factory in Limay, outside Paris. The concern also imposed
a quarantine on sales of all products made at the factory
since March 15.</p>
<p>The firm said police were investigating.</p>
<p>The company didn't provide further details of the
contamination.</p>
