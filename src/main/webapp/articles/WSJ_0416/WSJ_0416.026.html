	<p class="article-leader">RIO DE JANEIRO (AP) -- Locked in battle with inflation,
several Latin American governments unwittingly have struck
fear in the hearts of investors by seizing their accounts.
   Putting money in a Latin American bank is exciting but
risky business. Returns can be terrific: Recently, in Brazil,
a money-market fund was paying 105% a month. But a risk is
that the government might seize the account.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>This is why Latin Americans have more than an estimated
$200 billion in private money reportedly stashed away in
Switzerland, the Bahamas, Miami and other places.</p>
<p>Latin American leaders have appealed to citizens to bring
their cash home. But recent government actions in this region
indicate there will be few takers.</p>
<p>The latest Latin American financial "earthquake," as one
newspaper termed it, occurred in Brazil in March. President
Fernando Collor de Mello, on his first full day in office,
froze $115 billion of individual and corporate checking,
savings and money-market accounts and bank certificates of
deposit.</p>
<p>Mr. Collor de Mello said the drastic "liquidity
reduction," approved by the Brazilian congress last week ,
was needed to reduce the nation's annual inflation rate of
over 4,850%.</p>
<p>The government permitted withdrawals of just $1,200 for
checking and savings accounts. Those with money in mutual
funds, money-market accounts and CDs could draw only $600, or
20% of their balance, whichever was greater.</p>
<p>The government promised to pay the rest back in 18 months,
with interest.</p>
<p>The Brazilian leader said he was after "big speculators."
But the draconian measures in fact snared millions of
middle-class savers who saw their dreams of new cars or
down-payments on apartments suddenly put on hold.</p>
<p>Carlos Geraldo Langoni, a former president of the
Brazilian central bank, said, "There's no doubt that the
measures seriously affected people's confidence in the local
savings and banking system. They furthered the belief that
for Latin Americans, the only real financial protection is
the U.S. dollar or some other strong currency."</p>
<p>Clarice Pechman, a Brazilian foreign-exchange analyst,
estimates Brazilians have more than $40 billion outside the
country.</p>
<p>"On the other hand," Mr. Langoni said in an interview
here, where he now is a private consultant, "Brazil couldn't
go on with four-digit inflation." He said, "If the new
economic plan meets with total success, maybe it will erase
the trauma."</p>
<p>Argentina, Mexico, Chile and Bolivia also have decreed
"economic plans" that left ordinary savers stranded and
distraught. This has largely stymied government efforts to
get local investors to bring their money back from abroad.</p>
<p>In January, Argentina, facing a monthly inflation rate of
600%, seized about $1.5 billion of seven-day, high-interest
bank CDs and converted them into 10-year government bonds.</p>
<p>Argentines who don't want to wait until the year 2000 to
get their money back can sell off the bonds for cash. But
they get only about 30% of the original value.</p>
<p>"They robbed me," said Raul Tucci, the owner of a small
Buenos Aires furniture factory, as he stood in line at a bank
that was handing out free cups of coffee to customers
agonizing over their frozen CDs.</p>
<p>"I owe money for wood I bought. I can't pay it. I have to
close the factory and lay off my 50 workers. Who wants
coffee? I want my money."</p>
<p>Mexico, in 1982, snatched some $10 billion in U.S. dollar
accounts in local banks, forcibly converted them into pesos,
and then devalued the peso by 30%. Savers lost $3 billion.</p>
<p>Many Mexicans learned, the hard way, it wasn't safe to
keep their money at home. Those near the border quickly
opened accounts on the U.S. side or invested in real estate
in Texas.</p>
<p>Unofficial estimates say Mexicans have $100 billion
outside the country.</p>
<p>Recently, however, under the new, free market-oriented
president, Carlos Salinas de Gortari, about $2.5 billion to
$3.5 billion in so-called "flight capital" has returned to
Mexico. Peso bank accounts now pay 20% in interest a year --
above the inflation rate.</p>
<p>Bolivia in the 1980s tried to "undollarize" its economy.
It seized formerly legal U.S.-dollar accounts and turned the
balances into bolivianos, the local currency.</p>
<p>The government claimed that at the official exchange rate,
nobody lost anything. But out on the street, bolivianos
supposedly worth a dollar fetched only 10 cents. The result
was a rush to deposit in safer currencies overseas.</p>
<p>An exception to Latin American banking instability is
Uruguay. There, Swiss-style bank-secrecy laws are in effect.</p>
<p>Of the estimated $60 billion in Argentine funds held
outside the country, some $2 billion is thought to be in
neighboring Uruguay.</p>

<p>Corrections & Amplifications</p>
<p>ARGENTINA faced a monthly inflation rate of 71% in
January. Because of an error by the Associated Press, the
percentage figure was misstated in an earlier article about
Latin American countries struggling with inflation.</p>
