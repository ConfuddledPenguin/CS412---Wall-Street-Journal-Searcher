	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- A recent slackening in Japanese demand for
dollars is making foreign-exchange traders edgy, but they
doubt the U.S. currency will tumble from its current high
plateau any time soon.
   "It won't be the turn in the trend" if Japanese investors
shy away from the dollar for a bit longer, says Nori Kato, a
trader at Industrial Bank of Japan Trust Co., New York. "The
general trend" of dollar strength against the yen "is still
intact."</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Although there has been broad-based buying of the dollar
in recent months because of a lack of confidence in Japan's
government, financial markets and monetary policy, Japanese
market participants have played a major role in dealings.</p>
<p>The dollar's rise from 143.95 yen at the end of last year
to a 39-month peak of 160.30 yen April 12 was spurred by
Japanese buying. The aggressive purchases, currency analysts
say, reflect changes in long-term positions and a scramble
for investment opportunities outside Japan that are more
attractive than those in the domestic markets.</p>
<p>However, Japanese investors' dollar buying lightened
noticeably just before major monetary officials convened in
Paris April 7. And it hasn't gotten back to full blast even
though there is skepticism about the resolve of global
central banks to curb the dollar's strength against the yen,
traders say.</p>
<p>Consequently, the dollar has become stalled at its higher
levels and has grown more vulnerable to profit-taking.</p>
<p>Early Monday in Tokyo, the dollar was trading at 159.05
yen, up from Friday's Tokyo close of 158.42 yen.</p>
<p>Demand from Japanese investors "seems to be satisfied for
the time being," says Keith Cheveralls, foreign exchange
manager at the Nippon Credit Bank, New York. There's "no real
indication" of what the Japanese will do next, he says.</p>
<p>While there are still many forecasts for a decisive dollar
rise above 160 yen by summer, some traders suspect that such
a move wouldn't be fueled by heavy Japanese buying.</p>
<p>"They're not really desperate" to purchase dollars, says
Mr. Kato.</p>
<p>He suspects Japan's higher interest rates are finally
beginning to keep capital in the nation, possibly by
encouraging Japanese banks to make yen loans and take
advantage of the rate rise that has occurred in the past
year.</p>
<p>But at no time soon is capital outflow expected to cease
as a problem for Japan and the yen, not with Japan's interest
rates and financial markets still unattractive to most global
investors and Japanese investors keen on obtaining foreign
assets.</p>
<p>Primarily because of that outlook, the mood about the
dollar remains positive, traders say.</p>
<p>Late Friday in New York, the dollar traded at 158.70 yen
and 1.6722 marks, compared with 158.18 and 1.6724,
respectively, at Thursday's close.</p>
<p>The "critical issue" isn't whether or not the U.S.
financial markets will continue to draw Japanese capital;
it's a question of how much capital U.S. interest rates will
be able to lure, says Roger Shields, chief international
economist at Chemical Bank.</p>
<p>U.S. interest rates, he says, will probably stay firm
despite continued hints of weak economic growth.</p>
<p>As for central banks, any efforts to undermine the dollar
will be futile if the resolve behind the actions remains
questionable, traders say.</p>
<p>Even though the Group of Seven industrial nations termed
the yen's weakness "undesirable" at their meeting in Paris,
it is widely believed the Bank of Japan may have to fight
pretty much single-handedly to solve what is regarded as a
Japanese problem. The G-7 are the U.S., Japan, West Germany,
Britain, France, Canada and Italy.</p>
<p>The Bank of Japan's struggle to prop up the yen will
probably require it to undertake the bulk of any dollar
selling in "concerted" attacks. It probably also will have to
raise its 5.25% discount rate soon without any aid from the
Federal Reserve in terms of easier monetary policy, currency
analysts say.</p>
<p>It will "undermine any yen rally" if the market perceives
that the Bank of Japan is working alone to boost the yen,
says Mr. Cheveralls of Nippon Credit Bank. "The solution must
come primarily from Tokyo," he says, but cooperation among
the major industrial nations would help.</p>
<p>If demand keeps dwindling, the Bank of Japan may not have
to work very hard to depress the dollar in the near term.</p>
<p>"Shorter-term speculators will be disappointed" and may
take profits if the dollar doesn't rise, says John Lyman, a
senior customer dealer at Bank of Tokyo Ltd., New York. "What
we need now is new demand."</p>
