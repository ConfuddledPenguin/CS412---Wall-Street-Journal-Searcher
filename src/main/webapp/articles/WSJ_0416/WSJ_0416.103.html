	<p class="article-leader">Italian sportwear group Stefanel S.p.A. said it signed an
agreement with Tradex, a private Hungarian company, to launch
a chain of ten franchise stores in Hungary by the end of the
year.
   The first store was opened Friday in Budapest; the second
is due to open within weeks in the tourist center of Siofax
on Lake Balaton, Stefanel said.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Under the agreement, Stefanel will sell in Hungary the
same collections available contemporaneously in Milan, Paris
and New York. The company said the accord marks the first
time a Western clothing manufacturer has agreed to market its
most recent designs in Eastern Europe in local currency.</p>
<p>Separately, Benetton Group S.p.A. said it opened its first
Soviet outlet on Red Square in Moscow. The store is managed
by the Elegant joint venture, which is 65% Italian. Two more
stores are projected to open in Moscow, as well as a
distribution center that will manage sales of Benetton
products in the Soviet Union and set up stores in Kiev,
Leningrad and Riga.</p>
