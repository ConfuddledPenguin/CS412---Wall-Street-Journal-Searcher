	<p class="article-leader">Two frequent contributors to this page have just published
books about disruption in major American institutions, the
corporation and the university. Their underlying theme is job
security.
   Amanda Bennett, who heads up a team of journalists
covering management issues for The Wall Street Journal, has
applied her reportorial skills to surveying the end of the
postwar heyday for middle management in "The Death of the
Organization Man" (Morrow, 270 pages, $19.95). Ms. Bennett
shows how the perk-padded paradise described in William H.
Whyte's 1956 best-seller "The Organization Man" went to hell
in the '80s. People who had staked everything on loyalty to a
Fortune 500 company found themselves out on their own,
severed to meet cutback quotas forced by Japanese
competition, post-raid reorganizations and similar bolts from
the blue.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Because this wholesale pummeling of big business's chicken
colonels was the dark side of the major financial news of
recent years, this book amounts to a general business history
of the period told through the wretched biographies of its
frontline casualties. Without sentimentalizing their fates,
Ms. Bennett has interviewed dozens and dozens of organization
men and women now forcibly converted into entrepreneurs,
consultants or early retirees. For the most part, she has
concealed their true names, in order to quote them fully and
give poignant life to what was, after all, a major convulsion
in middle-class American life. With all her reporter's
distance and willingness to see the positive effects of
downsizing on the corporate economy, Ms. Bennett has, in
effect, devoted much energy to telling us about a mass
firing: 3.1 million jobs lost in eight years.</p>
<p>It was enough to shake a tough senior exec. Donald Frey,
former chairman of Bell & Howell Co., told Ms. Bennett that
"a classical economist is someone who never had to close a
plant and put his friends on the street. I survived, and my
friends survived, but I hated the process. All the theory
goes out the window, when you've known the people and their
families by name over many years and you have to tell them
that there's no job next month."</p>
<p>Nothing of the sort blighted employment in American
academic life. Instead, tenure crept over the radical
graduate students of the '60s like a sheltering robe. Today,
with the anachronistic predictability of a Beatles record,
they continue to reproduce the New Left message of their
youth, having added the mystagogic patois of French
deconstructionism and the politicizing yawp of feminism and
Third World me-tooism to their subversive repertoire. This,
in short, is Roger Kimball's stern analysis of the present
danger on campus in "Tenured Radicals: How Politics Has
Corrupted Our Higher Education" (Harper & Row, 204 pages,
$18.95).</p>
<p>Mr. Kimball, who reviews art exhibitions for this page and
also is managing editor of the New Criterion, views with
alarm a world in which English teachers zealously shape their
syllabi according to a system of literary affirmative action
that gives a boost to women writers and writers from other
cultures at the inevitable expense of Shakespeare, Milton and
Dickens. And so he attacks the professors who have attacked
the traditional "canon" of writers once held up to students
as pillars of "their" Western tradition.</p>
<p>Although it may seem as if Mr. Kimball follows squarely in
the wake of Allan Bloom's "Closing of the American Mind," he
has, while aiming at many of the same targets in academia,
focused more sharply on an interrelated set of evils he
argues beset our intellectual life, from the Stanford Western
Civ brouhaha to the neo-Marxist gobblydegook of the art
magazine October, to the "new sophistry" in literary
criticism and architecture.</p>
<p>This is an angry and pugnacious book, but Mr. Kimball's
tone is calm, even quizzical, and he proceeds methodically,
starting out as an inquiring reporter, quoting chapter and
verse and public lecture, but ending in amazement at the
willful perversity of the Mandarins he has undertaken to
expose.</p>
<p>People for whom Stanley Fish, Paul De Man, Geoffrey H.
Hartman, Rosalind Krauss and Peter Eisenman already represent
the embodiment of a deep crisis in the humanities will find
Mr. Kimball's accounts of their views and work an articulate
and compendious reminder of everything they hate in the
current highbrow scene. Others, who leap stairs two at a time
in their lust to hear a deconstructionist lecture on Kwakiutl
lesbian verse, will abominate Mr. Kimball as a white male
elitist entirely too pleased with his skill at writing clear
prose and as a capitalist dupe who purports to be defending
common sense and traditional values in order to attack the
right of oppressed societies to have their cultures put at
the heart of curricula in the Ivy League.</p>
<p>Perhaps the way to resolve this apparently hopeless
polarization is to deconstruct Mr. Kimball. Any educational
system that could have produced someone of his range and
rhetorical skill can't be in a state of total collapse.
Shakespeare still is in print, and hundreds of thousands of
Ms. Bennett's early retirees have the time to read him.</p>
