	<p class="article-leader">As Pennsylvania prepares to adopt the most stringent
anti-takeover law in the nation, some of the state's major
corporations and labor groups are openly questioning the
wisdom of such a move.
   Passage of a final version of the bill this week seems
secure, so executives and employees can count on strong
protection against hostile takeovers and other challenges.
But despite the measure's pro-corporate stance and the
business-labor alliance backing it, some Pennsylvania
companies and labor organizations now acknowledge that they
fear the possible consequences. Indeed, a number of them are
likely to choose to be excluded from coverage by the law.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Last Wednesday, for example, the chairman and chief
executive officer of VF Corp., Lawrence R. Pugh, wrote to
Gov. Robert P. Casey urging him not to sign the bill. "I
agree that corporations should be given proper time to
respond to raiders," wrote Mr. Pugh. "I do not agree that
there should be legislation that protects weak management
from shareholders."</p>
<p>Meanwhile, such leading employers as Westinghouse Electric
Corp. and H.J. Heinz Co. are trying to distance themselves
from the legislation. In addition, some smaller, private
firms, which wouldn't be subject to most of the bill's
provisions, are uneasy. Even the chairman of the Pennsylvania
Chamber of Business and Industry, the group that drafted the
bill and has lobbied heavily to get it through the
legislature, now says he has doubts about whether he wants
the law to apply to his own company.</p>
<p>The proposed statute would garnish the profits of
short-term shareholders who sell after a failed attempt to
"control" the company, restrict voting rights of large
holders in proxy fights and guarantee severance pay for
employees who lose their jobs after a takeover. What's more,
the new law would let boards base decisions not only on
shareholders' interests, but also on the interests of
employees, customers, suppliers and the community. A recent
House amendment to the bill would also insulate directors
from lawsuits by any group claiming its interests were
ignored.</p>
<p>For a small firm, the fiduciary duty changes could mean
financial disaster. "You have to assure the shareholders that
the directors will act in their best interests," said Robert
Heise, lobbyist for the Berks County Chamber of Commerce. "If
you can't show that to investors, they may not want to
invest."</p>
<p>In addition, says Mr. Heise, smaller companies fear the
precedent set by the bill's guaranteed severance benefits for
employees. "It will give our opponents, labor, a leg to stand
on for other mandated benefits," Mr. Heise says.</p>
<p>The Berks County business group so strongly opposed the
bill that on March 30, its directors voted 20-3 to become the
first -- and so far, only -- local chamber to break ranks
with the powerful state chamber.</p>
<p>But other companies discomforted by the bill are unwilling
to directly challenge their more enthusiastic corporate
colleagues that favor the bill, including Armstrong World
Industries Inc., Scott Paper Co., AMP Inc. and PPG Industries
Inc.</p>
<p>"I can't think of anyone who wants to be leading a
charge," says Donald E. Meads, chairman of Philadelphia First
Group Inc., a private merchant bank. Mr. Meads, who was
chairman and chief executive of CertainTeed Corp. when a
French firm acquired control of it in 1978, says he is
philosophically opposed to anti-takeover legislation.</p>
<p>Sympathy is particularly strong for Armstrong, the object
of a proxy contest and possible takeover bid from the
Belzberg family of Canada. Speedy passage of the bill, with
its restrictions on proxy fights for control of a company,
could well help Armstrong in its battle with the Belzbergs at
its April 30 annual meeting.</p>
<p>So rather than oppose the legislation outright,
Westinghouse, Pennsylvania's largest public company, worked
to secure opt-out clauses in the proposed law so any company
could duck the provisions within the first 90 days after
enactment. "This bill, SB1310, goes too far. There is
adequate legislation on the books today as far as
Westinghouse is concerned," says Robert F. Pugliese,
Westinghouse's executive vice president, legal and corporate
affairs.</p>
<p>Many companies worry about the potential threat to capital
from enacting what some investors see as anti-shareholder
legislation. The Belzbergs, who lead the opposition, are
understandably crying foul: The family has made a fortune
from runs on such U.S. corporations as Ashland Oil Inc. and
USG Corp. But institutional investors have also threatened to
pull their money out of Pennsylvania companies if shareholder
rights -- and the possibility of high profits from corporate
buy-outs -- are restricted.</p>
<p>Indeed, money managers and pension funds representing more
than a quarter of the country's institutional money -- about
half a trillion dollars' worth -- have formally declared that
they may divest themselves of shares in Pennsylvania
corporations if the law is passed.</p>
<p>"If they do, that could have a negative effect on the
value on the stock held by our shareholders," said Mr. Pugh,
VF's chairman. According to a study by the Securities and
Exchange Commission, share prices in Ohio declined an average
of 2% after less restrictive anti-takeover legislation was
passed.</p>
<p>The threat to share prices puts the state's employee
pension funds in an awkward position. Although the state
AFL-CIO and United Steelworkers union have joined the Chamber
of Business and Industry in backing the bill, some funds in
the state are dubious. "I've looked into this for over a
month, and it's still a confusing situation," says Don
Morabito, chief lobbyist for the Pennsylvania State Education
Association, representing 85,000 teachers and their pensions.</p>
<p>Certainly, the bill carries great political appeal for
state legislators and Gov. Casey, who faces an election this
year. Although the governor is officially withholding
judgment until he sees the final version of the bill, a few
weeks ago he told residents of Lancaster, Armstrong's
headquarters, that he expects to be able to sign it. And last
Thursday, the state AFL-CIO endorsed Mr. Casey in the
Democratic primary.</p>
