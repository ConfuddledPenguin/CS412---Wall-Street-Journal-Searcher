	<p class="article-leader">CAMBRIDGE, Mass. -- Genetics Institute Inc. said its
first-quarter loss widened and revenue fell.
   The biotechnology concern said the loss widened to $7
million, or 57 cents a share, from $3.9 million, or 28 cents
a share, a year earlier. Revenue fell 44% to $8.6 million
from $12.4 million.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>A spokeswoman said first-quarter results were hampered by
lower shipments of the company's anemia drug, erythropoeitin,
or EPO. She also said that the results didn't include any
revenue from the manufacture or sale of an immunity-building
protein sold a year ago.</p>
