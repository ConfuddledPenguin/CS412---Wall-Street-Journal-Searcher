	<p class="article-leader">I saw "Roger and Me," the muckraking documentary that
recycles the hackneyed theme of the pitiless corporate giant
vs. the beloved working-class community -- and was
frightened. I read "Barbarians at the Gate" (written by two
of this newspaper's reporters), the best seller about
corporate greed -- and was revolted. I reviewed Harvard Prof.
Michael Jensen's sanctimonious "Eclipse of the Public
Corporation" -- and was enraged.
   Where are the corporate champions? Is there no one in
corporate America capable of intellectually challenging this
sophistic blitzkrieg on the integrity of business?</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>In the late 1970s General Electric's Reginald Jones or Du
Pont's Irving Shapiro would no doubt have been quick to take
to the pen or podium to dissect these simplistic caricatures
of reality.</p>
<p>Are today's business leaders too preoccupied with
restructuring, or the Japanese, to take on these
disinformationists?</p>
<p>It's not so much that Michael Moore, director of "Roger
and Me," by a tricky re-arranging of events distorted the
history of both Flint, Mich., and GM. What concerns me is
that no CEO has stood up to address the larger issue: the
manipulative thrust of the film, which was meant to rekindle
class warfare.</p>
<p>After a brief period of lauding the achievements of the
entrepreneurial spirit in the early to mid-1980s, we seem to
be coming full circle to the anti-business climate of the
1960s and 1970s. And there's been no serious or scholarly
confrontation by business itself of the implied thesis that a
decay of morality and values in corporate America is rampant.</p>
<p>I suspect that the star-studded class of CEOs of the 1980s
-- Walter Wriston, David Rockefeller, John DeButts, et al.,
would long ago have risen to the bait. There are plenty of
positives in the American business story in the decade just
ended. In fact, for anyone who clearly looks at the facts,
there is reason for unfashionable optimism about America's
future.</p>
<p>One lesson the 1980s should have taught American business
leaders is the pivotal importance of corporate credibility.
Achieving it, sustaining it, protecting it is not a damage
control matter. It has to be a daily activity. It demands
visible, candid, even visionary leadership.</p>
<p>Abstracts like integrity and values generally have little
agenda space as business copes with quantitative issues --
competition, costs, quality, legal headaches, etc. With the
third millennium now within reasonable strategic planning
distance, an Industry Week survey (in addition to others) of
CEO pronouncements about the issues of the new decade showed
a disturbing absence of concern for these troubling,
insidious undercurrents that question the value and relevance
of capitalism.</p>
<p>Why are other issues considered more important? Trade is a
tangible problem; trust, an intangible. But of no less
importance when one notes that a Carnegie Mellon study
indicates fully one-third of 400 senior executives surveyed
distrust their direct bosses and 55% do not believe top
management. A survey of 611 executives by New Forum Group, a
Boston-based consulting firm, shows a significant gap between
what the CEO thinks he's communicating and what his
executives hear. A full 82% of the CEOs feel that their
strategy is clear and understood. But less than one-third of
the chief operating officers and vice presidents agree.</p>
<p>If there is, as the year-end cover story in Fortune
magazine indicated, a major "trust gap" existing between top
management and the rest of the company, why isn't this given
any priority in planning?</p>
<p>The speeches and writings of today's leadership on
concrete issues are incisive and far-seeing. But on
philosophical issues they are largely mute. The Bully Pulpit
has been debased.</p>
<p>Of course, perceptions are devilishly hard to pin down, to
reverse or to neutralize. Yet, left unchallenged, they create
an environment of cynicism that can, ultimately, create havoc
for any one company, any one CEO. They can easily move from
general perceptions into specific barriers to effective
management, such as mistrust of senior management, or the
lack of confidence in its competence.</p>
<p>Executives must recognize the need to identify and accept
the validity of these qualitative issues and address them as
forthrightly as they do the quantitative ones. Each
management decision has an element of the qualitative
inherent in it.</p>
<p>Human resources isn't just about pay, child care or drugs.
It is also about rebuilding the social contract between
employers and employees shredded by layoffs, takeovers and
restructurings.</p>
<p>CEOs shouldn't be expected to know all the answers, but
they should at least be aware of the questions and be of a
mind to tackle them publicly.</p>
<p>This may end up being the real issue of the 1990s. Will
CEOs have the intellectual sophistication to respond to these
subtle but dangerous currents?</p>
