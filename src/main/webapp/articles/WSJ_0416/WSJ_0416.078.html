	<h3>Credit Markets: Credit-Card Bonds Are Hot, but May Be Stingy on Yield</h3>

	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Bonds backed by credit-card debt are one of
Wall Street's hottest products.
   So far this year, more than $6 billion of the securities
have been sold to both institutional and individual
investors. Later this month, Citibank is expected to issue
$250 million of credit-card securities in a deal targeted to
individuals.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>But while sales continue to soar, a few analysts have
begun to question whether the interest rates on some
credit-card securities are high enough to compensate
investors for the risk they are taking.</p>
<p>After all, they note, credit-card debt is unsecured, and
some economists believe Americans are stretched so thin that
a severe economic recession could cause credit-card defaults
to soar. Meanwhile, the issuers, mostly commercial banks and
retailers, aren't in the best of shape these days, either.</p>
<p>The latest splash of cold water comes from Fitch Investors
Service, which is moving aggressively to establish itself as
major force in the credit-rating business. Fitch recently
downgraded to double-A from triple-A the rating on $1 billion
of credit-card securities issued by Sears, Roebuck & Co.</p>
<p>Further, Fitch warns in a new report, the triple-A rating
assigned to several other credit-card debt offerings may be
too generous. It isn't that the credit agency thinks the
securities are a bad investment. Fitch is simply spreading
the word that the triple-A -- the rating assigned to
International Business Machines Corp., General Electric Co.
and the federal government -- may be too good in some cases
for bonds backed by bills for everything from shoes for the
kids to a night on the town.</p>
<p>Credit-card securities are created by pooling a large
amount of consumer debt into one package and structuring it
in a way that resembles a bond. Investors are promised a
fixed interest rate, which is paid either monthly or
quarterly.</p>
<p>Most credit-card debt would be rated on the same level
with high-risk, high-yield junk bonds if it weren't for
"credit enhancements" that are intended to increase the
safety of the securities.</p>
<p>The most popular credit enhancer is excess cash flow or
"over-collateralization." Consider a recent $1.4 billion
offering by Citibank, the biggest seller of credit-card debt.
Citibank charges annual interest rates of about 20% on its
Visa and MasterCard credit cards, which have a default rate
of about 4.6%. Citibank is paying credit-card investors
coupon rates of as much as 9.5% for the senior portion of the
issue, and spending about 2% for servicing charges. That
leaves a cushion, or "excess cash flow," of nearly four
percentage points.</p>
<p>For further protection, some asset-backed deals come with
other enhancements, such as a letter of credit from a
top-rated bank or guarantees from a bond-insurance company.</p>
<p>Recently, however, many issuers have been using still
another credit-enhancement technique, the
"senior-subordinated structure." It is this technique, the
fastest-growing type of credit enhancement, that is at the
heart of Fitch's concern.</p>
<p>The senior-subordinated structure offers two levels of
ownership interest in the credit-card receivables: a
higher-rated senior portion that carries very little risk and
a much smaller, lower-rated subordinated portion. If things
go wrong, the subordinated portion absorbs most of the risk.
Of course, if default rates are lower than expected, this
subordinated portion can be more profitable.</p>
<p>Fitch likes the senior-subordinated structure, as long as
it is sold to a third party. But in the case of the recently
downgraded Sears issue, Sears kept the subordinated structure
itself. As a result, from a legal perspective, investors'
protection isn't as strong as it is with most other
asset-backed bonds, Fitch says.</p>
<p>Fitch concedes that there wouldn't be any problem except
in the "unlikely event" that Sears joined such other
merchants as Federated Department Stores and Bonwit Teller in
bankruptcy court. Its concern, says Fitch analyst Neil Baron,
is that if there were a bankruptcy-law filing, it is possible
the credit-card receivables and other Sears assets could be
consolidated. And that could hurt investors, who might have
to stand in line with other creditors, he says.</p>
<p>To some, the credit agency's concern is far-fetched. No
one, not even Fitch, is suggesting that Sears is anywhere
near bankruptcy.</p>
<p>For its part, Sears says it is displeased by the Fitch
downgrading. It notes that Fitch's two bigger rivals in the
credit-rating business, Moody's Investors Service and
Standard & Poor's Corp., both affirmed the triple-A ratings
on Sears's credit-card securities, although they give Sears
itself a single-A rating. (Moody's did say, however, that it
may take a closer look at the Sears credit-card securities
from a legal perspective.)</p>
<p>Still, even some industry insiders are critical of the
Sears deal. Their fear is that other, less-reputable
companies may adopt the same credit-enhancement approach,
which is potentially more vulnerable to abuse.</p>
<p>"It is in our best interest to see that this market
develops in a positive way," says John Caouette, chief
executive of Capital Markets Assurance Corp., a
financial-guaranty insurance subsidiary of Citicorp,
Citibank's parent. "Investors are vulnerable when you leave
the servicing of the deal in the same hands of the guy who
they bought it from in the first place."</p>
<p>Some others say they are relieved someone has raised the
question of whether yields on credit-card securities are high
enough to compensate for the risks.</p>
<p>"Credit-card debt has never traded like other triple-A
securities, because the market has been saying for some time
that they don't view them that way," says Allan Berliant,
investment officer at Hartford Life Insurance Co. For
investors, "it's harder to get the same comfort level" with
credit-card securities as with more traditional bonds.</p>
<p>For example, credit-card securities with two-year
maturities currently are quoted at yields of more than 9.2%,
which is nearly three-quarters of a percentage point higher
than yields on two-year Treasury notes. In comparison, the
yields on two-year securities issued by IBM and GE are about
four-tenths of a percentage point higher than comparable
Treasurys.</p>
<p>Mr. Berliant, however, believes that may not be high
enough. One of his major concerns is that there isn't enough
information provided to investors about the securities.</p>
<p>"If I have questions about IBM, I can call the company's
treasurer and there's a lot of public information about IBM,"
said Mr. Berliant. "But with credit cards, there's a lot we
just don't know."</p>
