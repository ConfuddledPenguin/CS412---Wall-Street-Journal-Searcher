	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- The chairman of the president's Council of
Economic Advisers said that substantially reducing gases that
some scientists believe will cause the Earth to warm
catastrophically could cost the U.S. as much as $200 billion
a year and batter economies world-wide.
   "The stakes are very high economically," said Michael
Boskin, CEA chairman. "You'd likely wind up seeing a sharp
reduction of economic growth" around the globe if the
so-called greenhouse gases are to be reduced by 20% during
the next 15 years.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Mr. Boskin's comments reflect an attempt by the Bush
administration to refocus the debate over possible global
warming from the effects on the environment to the potential
costs of any clean-up. The president has invited 17 nations
to a two-day conference on global warming that begins here
tomorrow; the U.S. and Japan are expected during the meetings
to emphasize the potentially staggering costs of reducing
greenhouse gas emissions.</p>
<p>Environmentalists contend that the administration's tactic
will slow any effort to combat global warming. "What they're
doing is backing away from commitments already made," said
Rafe Pomerance, a senior associate at the World Resources
Institute, a Washington environmental research organization.
"They have absolutely no plans to do anything about global
warming."</p>
<p>Bush administration officials deny that. William Reilly,
chief of the Environmental Protection Agency, said he expects
the U.S. to begin preliminary negotiations on a global
warming compact by the end of the year. He called
calculations of the economic effect of curbing greenhouse
gases the "significant missing dimension" in international
talks so far on the subject.</p>
<p>Climate scientists say the world may be heating because of
the rapid increase in the atmosphere of carbon dioxide and
other gases produced by human development. These gases trap
heat in the atmosphere and block it from escaping into space.
During the past century, the earth has warmed about 0.5
degree Celsius, according to White House Science Adviser
Allan Bromley, but it isn't clear how much of that rise is
due to human activity.</p>
<p>Mr. Boskin, one of the three co-chairmen of the
global-change conference, played down the significance of the
potential heating. A rise of a few degrees Celsius would be
similar to the change from moving from Boston to Washington,
and might even benefit U.S. agriculture, he said.</p>
<p>He also argued that people could use technology to adjust
to the warmer weather. "For example, air conditioning has
made previously less-hospitable climes much more hospitable,"
he said.</p>
<p>David Rind, a climate specialist at the National
Aeronautics and Space Administration's Goddard Institute for
Space Studies, said that computer models predict a rise of
between about two degrees and six degrees Celsius if the
amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere doubles, as
expected, in the next century. Even a rise of two degrees
would increase droughts in Florida and the southern-most
parts of the U.S., Central America and large parts of Africa
and South America. A four-degree rise would be a "disaster,"
leading to droughts in most of the U.S., he said.</p>
<p>The earth usually changes temperature exceptionally
slowly. At the peak of the ice age 15,000 years ago, the
earth was on average only four degrees Celsius colder than it
is today. What makes global warming so menacing, he said, is
that it would vastly accelerate the pace of environmental
change.</p>
<p>Mr. Boskin said he and his staff hadn't done original
research on the costs of greenhouse warming, but had reviewed
a "substantial number" of U.S. computer models. Cutting
emissions 20% by the year 2005, as has been suggested by
countries in Western Europe, would cost the U.S. "trillions
of dollars -- $100 billion to $200 billion a year would be in
the ballpark," he estimated.</p>
<p>"It would mean a period of substantially higher
unemployment and lower economic growth," he said, because the
U.S. would have to switch to "much more expensive forms of
energy."</p>
<p>Even stabilizing carbon dioxide emissions would deal a big
blow to the economy, Mr. Boskin predicted. The last time U.S.
emissions of the gas didn't grow was after the Arab oil
embargo quadrupled the cost of oil and the economy plummeted.</p>
<p>William Nordhaus, a Yale University economist who served
on the CEA under President Carter, estimated the cost of
stabilizing greenhouse gas emissions overall during the next
40 years at about $50 billion a year for the U.S. and $150
billion annually for the rest of the world. During the past
year, Mr. Nordhaus conducted research into the costs of
trying to limit global warming.</p>
<p>Slowing the increase of greenhouse gases so they grow at a
rate 20% less than predicted would cost little, he said, and
might "actually have benefits" economically.</p>
