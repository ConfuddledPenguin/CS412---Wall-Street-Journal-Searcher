	<p class="article-leader">CAMBRIDGE, Mass. -- Intermetrics Inc., citing increased
competition and a slowdown in government defense spending,
said it expects to report net income fell 69% in the fourth
quarter ended Feb. 28 to about $215,000, or six cents a
share, from $695,000, or 20 cents a share, a year earlier.
   The company estimated revenue at $12 million, compared
with $12.5 million a year earlier.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Joseph A. Saponaro, president and chief executive officer,
said in an interview that full-year net fell 46% to about
$1.5 million, or 43 cents a share, from $2.8 million, or 79
cents a share, in fiscal 1989. Revenue fell 7.3% to about $46
million from $49.6 million. The results are in line with
analysts' projections, the company said.</p>
<p>Intermetrics provides software for government projects
including anti-submarine warfare systems, navigation systems,
the space shuttle and the Federal Aviation Administration. It
also makes software development tools for commercial
customers.</p>
<p>Mr. Saponaro said government delays in funding its awarded
contracts cost Intermetrics about $3 million in anticipated
revenue for the year. In addition, the company encountered
unexpected problems in consolidating its product lines with
those of Whitesmiths Ltd., a software developer acquired in
October 1988. The consolidation problems have been corrected,
he said.</p>
<p>Intermetrics ended the year with a $49 million backlog,
compared with a $26 million backlog in fiscal 1989.</p>
<p>Intermetrics recently declared a special one-time dividend
of 80 cents a share and an initial annual dividend of 20
cents a share to shareholders of record April 30. Both
dividends, Mr. Saponaro said, are payable May 22.</p>
<p>Mr. Saponaro said he sees "no fantastic growth" in the
current fiscal year. Instead, Intermetrics will concentrate
on positioning itself more competitively in an increasingly
crowded marketplace. The company sees no change in the next
three years from its current business ratio of 25% commercial
products and 75% government contracts.</p>
