	<p class="article-leader">Giving more clout to workers who allege age
discrimination, a U.S. appeals court said such complaints can
be taken to federal court even if a state agency rules that
no discrimination occurred.
   Other federal appeals courts have ruled both ways on the
issue. But because the U.S. Second Circuit Court of Appeals
in New York is considered more influential on labor issues,
its decision is likely to guide judges in similar cases
around the country unless the decision is appealed further,
attorneys said.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The appeals court reversed a lower-court ruling that had
barred a former vice president at Astoria Federal Savings &
Loan from suing. The district judge had ruled that because
the New York State Division of Human Rights had rejected the
discrimination claim, the matter couldn't be brought to
federal court.</p>
<p>Age-discrimination attorneys said that if the lower-court
decision had been allowed to stand, workers would have
avoided decisions on their cases by the state agencies, where
many age-discrimination cases currently are resolved.</p>
<p>Federal law requires that if a state has its own
age-discrimination law, a worker must at least begin the
state proceedings before suing in federal court; the federal
suit can't be filed until 60 days after the state proceedings
begin, unless they are terminated earlier. Under the
lower-court decision, anyone who let a state agency decide an
age-discrimination case would be risking the right to pursue
the case later in federal court, said Lamont White, an
attorney with the federal Equal Employment Opportunity
Commission.</p>
<p>The EEOC and the American Association of Retired Persons
filed friend-of-the-court briefs in support of the former
Astoria Federal employee, Angelo Solimino.</p>
<p>In order to pursue a federal suit "you'd have to get out
of the state process as quickly as you could," said Cathy
Ventrell-Monsees, an attorney with the AARP.</p>
<p>The appeals court agreed that it would be unfair to bar an
employee from suing in federal court just because a state
agency didn't find probable cause for a discrimination case.
The court said the federal age-discrimination law wasn't
meant to allow state agency's fact-finding decisions to stand
without judicial review.</p>
<p>Anthony Atlas, an attorney for Astoria Federal, said no
decision has been made on whether to appeal. Leonard Flamm,
an attorney for Mr. Solimino, couldn't be reached for
comment.</p>

<p>WOMEN LOSE BIG as a result of bias in the justice system,
a new Florida study shows.</p>
<p>The extensive 2 1/2-year study ordered by the state's
Supreme Court showed that bias against women is "pervasive"
in the state's legal system. "People misunderstand gender
bias as the `sweetie and honey syndrome' -- that it's judges
calling women these names in court," says Florida Supreme
Court Justice Gerald Kogan, chairman of the commission.
"That's only a minute part of the problem."</p>
<p>He said "a great majority" of the findings reflect a
national problem. Florida is the ninth state to issue a
report on the issue, and 21 other states are in the process
of analyzing gender bias in the courts, according to Lynn
Hecht Schafran, a New York attorney who was an adviser on the
project. " The overall pattern of systemic bias is repeated
from state to state," she says.</p>
<p>The commission found, among other things, that:</p>
<p>-- In divorces, men typically keep more than half of the
marital assets and walk away from a marriage with "an
enhanced earning capacity," but women and children are
economically harmed.</p>
<p>-- Women serve more time in prison than men do for the
same crimes and have fewer innovative programs and facilities
at their disposal.</p>
<p>-- Female lawyers are treated as inferiors by many lawyers
and judges in the courtroom.</p>
<p>The commission is composed of lawyers, judges and a
trustee. In its 239-page report, it suggests that female
lawyers in Florida have a lot to be unhappy about. They are
short-changed on judgeships. As prosecutors, they make less
money than male counterparts and they are often assigned to
less important cases. Opposing male attorneys interrupt their
court presentations more frequently than they do other male
attorneys. Judges as women to prove their credentials.</p>
<p>Many women can't afford adequate counsel in divorce cases,
the study found, and judges tend to minimize homemakers'
contributions. They also wrongly believe that middle-age
women with little job experience will quickly enter the work
force and therefore need little alimony.</p>
<p>The commission found that longstanding beliefs persist
among many in the criminal justice system that domestic
violence against women is acceptable. Police are hesitant to
arrest offenders and prosecutors are reluctant to press
charges. Often, the victim is blamed, the commission's report
said.</p>
<p>Male convicts are released from prison sooner than women
because of overcrowding. Women are prosecuted for
prostitution, but seldom are the men who sell and buy their
services, the report said.</p>
<p>The commission recommended legislation and remedies, such
as the re-education of judges and lawyers and more emphasis
in law schools on studying such bias. It also calls for pay
equity in state court jobs.</p>
<p>Other proposals call for a community-property law for the
state and allowing credit-card payments of child support.</p>

<p>RIGHTS GROUP SUES INS over privately operated detention
center.</p>
<p>The Lawyers Committee for Human Rights asked a federal
judge to force the Immigration and Naturalization Service to
turn over documents about a facility operated by Wackenhut
Corp. The committee claims the rights of people seeking
political asylum in the U.S. are being deprived at the
center. In the suit, which doesn't name Wackenhut as a
defendant, the committee said it needs the documents to
determine if standards set for the center are being met.</p>
<p>Arthur Helton, director of the committee's refugee
project, said the center in Queens, N.Y., is mainly used to
detain people from Afghanistan, Sri Lanka and other countries
after they arrive at Kennedy International Airport. Mr.
Helton said the detainees are seeking political asylum
because they have been persecuted or tortured in their
countries.</p>
<p>"Most of the cases ultimately win asylum, but most are
held in detention a year or two years before they win," he
said.</p>
<p>Mr. Helton said conditions at the facility are inadequate
for people being held for long periods of time. He also said
that problems at the center, including its inconvenient
location, make it difficult for detainees to get legal
representation. He said the facility lacks outdoor exercise
facilities, language programs, and medical personnel who can
speak the detainees' languages.</p>
<p>A spokesman for the INS said the Wackenhut center "is a
safe facility where humane treatment is the rule." He said
efforts are being made to make it easier for the detainees to
contact attorney.s</p>
