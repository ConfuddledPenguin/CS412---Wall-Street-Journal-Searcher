	<p class="article-leader">DALLAS -- Oilman T. Boone Pickens Jr. lost more than a big
distribution check when his Mesa Limited Partnership stopped
its annual payment to unit-holders earlier this year. He also
lost his general partner's fee.
   According to the company's recently mailed proxy
statement, Mr. Pickens, as the general partner of the oil and
gas master limited partnership, is entitled to receive 1% of
the partnership's cash distribution. That amounted to $1.6
million in 1989.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>After scrounging for several years to make the
distribution, Mesa halted it with the February payout because
its cash flow wasn't nearly enough to cover it. As a result,
the general partner's fee drops to zero.</p>
<p>"I get some fees if we make money on something," such as
securities gains or acquisitions, says Mr. Pickens. "But
other than that, I'm a cheap employee this year."</p>
<p>In addition to losing the general partner fee, Mr. Pickens
also loses about $10.5 million in annual distribution for the
approximately seven million Mesa units he owns.</p>
<p>But the move doesn't exactly leave him poor. Last year,
along with the general partner's fee, he also received about
$2.3 million in fees from securities and futures contract
gains and acquisitions fees. A proposed Mesa unit-option
plan, up for unit-holder approval at the May 17 unit-holders'
meeting, would give him options to buy two million more Mesa
shares.</p>
