	<p class="article-leader">There's an obscure provision in the Simpson-Mazzoli
immigration bill that could quickly erase one of the worst
parts of the 1986 law -- but only if someone notices. The
forgotten provision says that once there's been an official
finding that Simpson-Mazzoli led to discrimination against
minority workers, Congress can get an expedited vote within
30 days to repeal the sanctions against employers for hiring
illegals.
   In late March, the General Accounting Office found
widespread discrimination. Thus, the one good chance to
repeal sanctions runs up to April 29. And indeed, an unusual
alliance of Senators Ted Kennedy and Orrin Hatch has
introduced a resolution to repeal employer sanctions. Yet few
Congressmen have heard from businesspeople urging a vote to
repeal.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Simpson-Mazzoli is the modern era's Prohibition -- a
misguided attempt to "control the borders." The bill
deputized all employers as immigration cops by requiring that
they somehow make sure their employees are in the country
legally. One problem is that you could gather all the
country's immigration lawyers into one room and they couldn't
reach a conclusion about which noncitizens are allowed to
work or how to spot forged documents.</p>
<p>The difficulty employers have complying with the law has
even led to calls for a national identification card, but the
fundamental problem remains that the law created perverse
incentives. Think of Simpson-Mazzoli as the first legislation
since Jim Crow where the government is so closely aligned
with a process that produces discrimination. The law
encourages what we'd call preventive discrimination.
Employers know that overavoidance -- discriminating against
foreign-sounding job applicants -- is the safest way to avoid
fines or jail. If all your employees look and speak as if
their ancestors stepped off the Mayflower, you probably won't
go to jail.</p>
<p>So it's no surprise that the General Accounting Office
found "widespread discrimination" against job applicants
either because they weren't citizens or because they had a
"foreign appearance or accent," especially Hispanics and
Asians. The study, which began the time clock on 30-day
repeal, estimated that almost 20% of firms discriminate. Its
provisions led to such absurdities as author Gore Vidal, who
lives in Rome, being asked for proof of citizenship before he
could appear as a guest on the Johnny Carson show. Companies
from Wendy's to Wal-Mart have been fined for offenses.</p>
<p>The punishments can be severe. Eleven employees of the
Piedmont Quilting Corp. of Walhalla, South Carolina, were
indicted last year for immigration violations involving
faulty records and hiring 85 illegal aliens. The Immigration
and Naturalization Service distributed a press release noting
that the company could be fined $60 million and that Chairman
Alfred Mizhir and 10 others could be sent to jail for 653
years each. The INS has never been known for subtlety. The
company has paid a half-million-dollar fine. Mr. Mizhir
pleaded to 120 counts and is waiting to see if he'll be the
first employer to be jailed under the new law.</p>
<p>Jail aside, there is something absurd about the idea of
criminalizing voluntary agreements, such as employment. The
truth is that "illegal" immigrants fill many jobs throughout
the economy, from agriculture in the West to food services in
the East. We are now in the midst of a labor shortage, which
Congress seems to want to make worse. The easiest way to
ensure economic growth, Julian Simon argues in "The Economic
Consequences of Immigration," is for the U.S. to take in a
million more legal immigrants every year. Removing the
employer sanctions is the first step to a more open
immigration policy.</p>
<p>Why have business groups been so mouselike on repealing
sanctions? Probably because no one likes the idea of pleading
guilty to discrimination in order to get a law changed --
even if the discrimination is the result of a perverse law.
Other groups have urged repeal, though, including the U.S.
Civil Rights Commission, the American Bar Association (which
once supported sanctions) and many Hispanic groups.</p>
<p>Backers of the Kennedy-Hatch resolution say unless there's
a big push in the next several days, this opportunity to fix
the law will slip by. If this happens, expect the INS to
bring many more cases against employers in the comfort of
knowing there's little reason to worry. Without the
discipline of a forced quick vote, Congress won't get around
to reforming the employer sanctions any time soon.</p>
