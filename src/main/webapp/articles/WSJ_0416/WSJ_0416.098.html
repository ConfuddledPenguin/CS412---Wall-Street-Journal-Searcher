	<p class="article-leader">Hallmark Cards Inc., Kansas City, Mo., extended its offer
to 5 p.m. EDT tomorrow to buy back at a discount $270 million
of junk bonds issued by its Univision Holdings Inc. unit.
   The offer had been scheduled to expire at 12:01 a.m. last
Friday. Hallmark's move wasn't a surprise: A majority group
of holders hadn't agreed to accept the offer until late
Thursday evening.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Hallmark's tender offer is conditioned on receipt of at
least 90% of the bonds in each of the two classes
outstanding. On Friday, Hallmark said that holders of
Univision's senior subordinated discount notes, due 1998, had
either tendered or given notice of guaranteed delivery "in
excess of 90%" of the $165 million principal amount
outstanding. Holders of Univision's $105 million in
subordinated debentures, due 1999, had tendered or guaranteed
delivery of about 85% of the outstanding total, Hallmark
said.</p>
