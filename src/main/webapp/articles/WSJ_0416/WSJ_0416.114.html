	<p class="article-leader">Communist China has patched up its 30-year quarrel with
the Soviets -- at least temporarily -- only to open a new
rift in its global relations. There seems to be a quarrel
with Lesotho. This tiny African kingdom's offense was not,
say, shooting unarmed students. It was something far more
offensive to Communist Party sensibilities in Beijing.
Lesotho -- as did Grenada, Belize and Liberia last year --
has just established diplomatic relations with the Republic
of China on Taiwan.
   That produced the spectacle of Beijing's Foreign Ministry
deploring Lesotho's "totally wrong" decision and declaring
that the People's Republic couldn't tolerate any country with
which it had relations also having official links with
Taiwan.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Well, perhaps a few foreign shores trembled at this blast,
but the days have passed and Lesotho is still standing. By
our lights it has gained stature for coming to grips with the
same kind of practicalities once invoked as an argument for
the West to recognize Communist China.</p>
<p>Grenada, Belize, Liberia and Lesotho did not seek to break
formal ties with the mainland; they merely sought to
recognize that in the race for modernization, Taiwan is
quantum jumps ahead of the People's Republic. While the
Beijing regime fiddles with fixed prices and shoots
democratic dissidents, Taiwan has become a major player in
the world economy and a contender for membership in the club
of democracies.</p>
<p>This is hardly a diplomatic juggernaut at work here;
combined, the four countries have fewer than five million
people. But it's hard to believe that these will be the last
countries to try Taipei's policy of "dual recognition." And
it must be especially galling to Beijing that two of the four
renegade nations are from sub-Saharan Africa, a region with
which the PRC claims a special bond.</p>
<p>Given the condition of the rival governments, Lesotho's
decision looks sensible. Over the past two decades, Taiwan
has been the world's fastest-growing economy. The ROC is so
eager to make friends, and so rich -- it has more than $70
billion in foreign reserves -- that for Grenada and the
others this looks like one diplomatic gamble that will yield
a jackpot.</p>
<p>Already Taiwan has promised Lesotho and Liberia hefty aid
packages, a generosity that Beijing derided as "silver bullet
diplomacy to buy hearts and minds." We would endorse trade,
not aid, as the best deal Taiwan has to offer such countries.
The point, however, is that the PRC, economically and
politically bankrupt, is in no position to buy anybody.</p>
<p>For developing nations in particular, Taiwan's example and
friendship are more alluring than Beijing's bluster and
bankruptcy. The Pacific island of Palau has said, for
instance, that upon independence it will recognize Taiwan,
not the People's Republic. The Philippines has recently
upgraded its office and is considering strengthening its ties
further. Trade delegations from Southeast Asia are beating a
path to Taipei.</p>
<p>Beijing's effort to freeze out Taiwan diplomatically
should be recognized for what it is: a clumsy way of
deflecting attention away from the fact that Taiwan has
succeeded where the mainland has failed.</p>
