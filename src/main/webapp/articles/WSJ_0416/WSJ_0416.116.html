	<p class="article-leader">Torchmark Corp. indicated it would halt attempts to
acquire American General Corp. if Torchmark's slate of
nominees for American General's board is defeated at the
latter's annual meeting.
   The new condition means that the end of Torchmark's
three-week-old battle for control of American General could
come as early as the May 2 meeting. Torchmark, a Birmingham,
Ala.-based insurance and financial services company, had
initially bid $50 a share, or about $6.3 billion in cash and
stock for the Houston-based insurer in late March. One week
later, Torchmark withdrew the bid, saying American General
hadn't responded to its offer in time.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>At the same time, however, Torchmark proposed its own
slate of five independent nominees for American General's
board. Moreover, it introduced a resolution seeking to force
American General's board to sell or merge the company. The
moves, coupled with battles already emerging on legal and
regulatory fronts, signaled that the fight for American
General could be a long and messy affair.</p>
<p>In discussing the new condition, which was set forth over
the weekend in an amended proxy statement, Torchmark's
president, Jon W. Rotenstreich, said that the resolution
seeking a sale or merger of American General is non-binding
and that the current board could ignore it altogether. "Thus,
if {shareholders} don't elect the independent nominees, we'll
have to think heavily about re-considering any further bids,"
he said. "Because for us to make another offer would fall on
deaf ears."</p>
<p>Although Torchmark's options now appear to be riding on a
single shareholder vote, Mr. Rotenstreich said he is
optimistic that the company will prevail in getting both the
resolution adopted and its nominees elected to American
General's 15-member board. He said Torchmark has already
begun lobbying American General's institutional holders for
support. The group controls about 69% of American General's
common shares.</p>
<p>"We're prepared not to {pursue the merger} if it's not in
the shareholders' interest," Mr. Rotenstreich said. "However,
no one's told us why it's not."</p>
<p>Torchmark's slate of nominees has already encountered
considerable opposition. On April 6, a U.S. District Court
judge in Houston barred Torchmark from soliciting proxies for
its slate, saying the company had missed a 60-day deadline
for submitting the nominees. Last week, however, a federal
appeals court stayed that decision, opening the door for
Torchmark to proceed with its proxy fight.</p>
<p>Last Friday, American General said it plans to battle
Torchmark's slate of nominees on several fronts. The company
said it will ask a federal appeals court at a hearing set for
April 30 to uphold the original decision barring Torchmark's
solicitation of proxies for its slate.</p>
<p>In addition, American General said it has "been in
communication" with insurance regulators in 10 states where
it does business. The company contends that Torchmark must
win state regulatory approvals before it can propose a slate
because changing directors implies a change in control of the
company.</p>
<p>"We expect a number of states will be issuing their views
in writing and scheduling proceedings by {this} week," an
American General spokesman said.</p>
<p>Executives at American General said yesterday they hadn't
been informed of Torchmark's new condition and declined to
comment. But a person close to the company called the new
condition "another attempt by Torchmark to manipulate and
confuse the situation" and an effort "to bolster their
position by making out that they've been treated unfairly."</p>
