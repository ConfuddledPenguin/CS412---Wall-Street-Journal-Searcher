	<p class="article-leader">Norwest Corp. said Wyoming National Bancorp. agreed to a
reduced $19-a-share, or $41 million, acquisition proposal.
   In March, Norwest, Minneapolis, signed a letter of intent
to acquire Wyoming National for $20 a share, or $43 million.
But April 6 -- when the companies had said they would
determine whether to proceed with the transaction -- Norwest
said only that it was "continuing discussions" with the
Casper, Wyo., company.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The latest proposal is subject to signing a definitive
agreement, and approval by regulators and Wyoming National
holders.</p>
<p>Wyoming National has assets of $450 million, and owns six
banks in the state. Norwest has assets of $24.3 billion.</p>
