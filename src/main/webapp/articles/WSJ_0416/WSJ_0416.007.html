	<p class="article-leader">JOHANNESBURG -- The South African economy appeared to be
heading for a "soft landing" in the early months of this
year, the nation's central bank said in its latest quarterly
review.
   The Reserve Bank said "the soft landing of the economy up
to the early months of 1990 came about despite the
progressive tightening of monetary policy since late 1987 and
the de facto quite restrictive posture of fiscal policy in
the fiscal year 1989-1990."</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>A more significant slowdown had been predicted for the
South African economy. The Reserve Bank attributed the
better-than-expected performance to the sharp rise in
agricultural production from 1988 to 1989. Other factors
contributing to the softer landing were relatively receptive
export markets, the vigorous performance of South African
exporters, the more positive business mood and higher levels
of consumer confidence.</p>
<p>Also helping cushion the economy's slowdown were the rise
in wages of non-agricultural workers and the increased share
in labor remuneration, which were likely to have supported
household spending and the propensity to consume in the
economy as a whole.</p>
<p>The bank said the economy has been "moving in the right
direction" satisfactorily as regards the balance of payments
in general and the foreign exchange rate situation in
particular.</p>
<p>Less satisfactory progress has been made in subduing
inflation, moderating wage adjustments and slowing down the
expansion of bank credit and money supply.</p>
<p>The bank takes the view that South Africa's
balance-of-payments position has improved substantially and
its foreign debt commitments were likely to ease as a result
of improved foreign perceptions about the country.</p>
<p>The bank said net sales by foreigners of securities listed
on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange in the first half of 1989
were replaced by large net purchases of such securities in
the second half of the year.</p>
