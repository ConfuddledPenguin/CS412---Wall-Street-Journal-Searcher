	<h3>Commodities: `Sour' Crude-Oil Contract Appears a Tasty Idea To Some Exchanges; Singapore May Offer One</h3>

	<p class="article-leader">Now that even natural gas is being traded in the
fuel-futures market, can a "sour" crude contract be far
behind?
   Probably not. The petroleum futures exchanges are
seriously studying the addition of a contract to represent
the sour crudes -- those with high sulfur content. "Sour
crude is a high priority," said an official of the
International Petroleum Exchange.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The London-based exchange is looking at several
possibilities among the sour grades -- perhaps even a package
of crudes. But the most likely candidate for the contract is
the Dubai sour crude, perhaps to be traded on the Singapore
exchange. Dubai is an important Middle East petroleum --
already ranked among the world's benchmark crudes -- that is
produced in the United Arab Emirates.</p>
<p>Two other benchmark crudes currently are traded in the
futures market. The North Sea's Brent is listed on London's
International Petroleum Exchange. West Texas Intermediate,
the U.S. benchmark crude, is on the New York Mercantile
Exchange.</p>
<p>As a futures commodity, West Texas Intermediate has been a
smashing success. It isn't unusual for a day's volume in WTI
futures trading to number more than 100,000 contracts of
1,000 barrels each. That's nearly double the petroleum the
world actually uses each day.</p>
<p>But both WTI and Brent are light "sweet" crudes, low in
density and in sulfur. Priced at a premium, they yield more
preferred fuels such as gasoline. Also, they are important
for environmental reasons. They pollute less than high-sulfur
oil.</p>
<p>As a result, the sour crudes are responsible for the
current oil glut. The refiners mainly want sweet oil. That
has meant a widening gap between the prices paid for the
sweet and sour crudes, currently as much as $4 or $5 a
barrel. "The sweet crudes have decoupled from the sours,"
said Humphrey Harrison, a London-based oil analyst, "but
there is still a need for a futures market for sour crudes."</p>
<p>Indeed, the world's future oil needs will have to be met
more and more by the sour crudes. There isn't going to be
much choice.</p>
<p>The world's crude stream is growing heavier. Most reserves
that will have to be tapped in the years ahead are in the
Middle East and are considered heavy, or dense, crudes. Most
are high in sulfur. Six of every 10 barrels produced by the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries are in the
heavy or sour crude categories.</p>
<p>Dubai is a relatively light crude. Its density is on par
with that of Arabian Light. Still, the sulfur content makes
it a sour crude. But whether it's Dubai or not, oil analysts
expect that a sour crude will be added by one of the
petroleum exchanges soon.</p>
<p>The betting is on Singapore. The Singapore International
Monetary Exchange, or Simex, is succeeding in the futures
trading of a high-sulfur residual fuel oil contract launched
more than a year ago. There have been some problems, but the
Simex contract is doing much better than similar heavy
fuel-oil trading offered on the International Petroleum
Exchange or the New York Merc. The Rotterdam Energy Futures
Exchange in Holland abandoned its fuel oil contract recently.</p>
<p>The Simex will get considerable support if it does offer a
crude contract. The government and a growing community of oil
traders in Singapore back the idea, and the island
city-state's refineries process a lot of crude from the
Middle East.</p>
<p>The Simex itself already has endorsed the introduction of
a Dubai contract, although there are certain remaining
approvals to be obtained. Such a sour-crude contract could be
traded soon. "We are looking at a time frame of sometime
before June 1," Frankie Lim Choo Beng, the Simex vice
president-energy futures, said in a recent interview.</p>
<p>Looking ahead to commodity markets this week:</p>
<p>Precious Metals</p>
<p>If the dollar resumes climbing, it will be "the death
knell" for gold, says William O'Neill, director of futures
research at Elders Futures Inc. in New York.</p>
<p>Dinsa Mehta, chief bullion trader for Chase Manhattan
Bank, says this is a testing time for gold: "Gold needs a
convincing move to the upside to dissipate the negative
sentiment that has built up." June-delivery gold rose $1.30
an ounce Thursday to $379.70.</p>
<p>Frank Taucher notes in his "1990 Supertrader's Almanac"
that over the past five years, if one contract of
June-delivery gold were sold on April 15 (April 16 this year)
and bought back May 31, an average profit of $968 would have
been reaped (before commissions). The worst paper loss
experienced on a daily closing-price basis was $560. Mr.
Taucher cautions that seasonal trades don't necessarily
repeat each year. But he believes that traders contemplating
entering any market should be aware of seasonal patterns.

<p>Copper</p>
<p>According to Michael Frawley, metals trader at PaineWebber
Inc. in New York, the market will be watching two barometers
due out tomorrow: the stockpile levels to be announced by the
London Metals Exchange and the disclosure of the offers to
sell copper to the U.S. Mint.</p>
<p>The London Metals Exchange usually announces its warehouse
stocks Monday but because the exchange is closed today for
Easter, the data will be released tomorrow. Last week, rumors
of an impending increase in stockpiles kept the market on
edge.</p>
<p>Periodically, Mr. Frawley said, the Mint accepts for
purchase 4,000 tons of copper for its coin manufacturing
operations. On Tuesday at 11 a.m. EST when the Mint opens
offers, he said, speculators will be watching closely to see
the prices at which copper has been tendered to the Mint.</p>
<p>The tender "is a good indication of how strong the market
is, and I think it will set the tone for the balance of the
week," says Mr. Frawley. Copper has a tendency to peak around
this time of the year, he adds.</p>
<p>Mr. Taucher confirms that belief. He says in his almanac
that over the past five years, if May-delivery copper were
sold April 15 (April 16 this year) and bought back April 30,
an average profit of $788 a contract would have been realized
(before commissions). The worst paper loss experienced on a
daily closing-price basis was $138.</p>
<p>Seasonal trading is used by many traders in the commodity
markets. Usually it is combined with other technical trading
techniques to determine precise entry and exit points.</p>
<p>Livestock and Meats</p>
<p>Cattle traders this week will formulate their estimates of
the size of the herd being fattened for slaughter in 13 major
cattle-producing states.</p>
<p>On Friday, the Agriculture Department is slated to release
its quarterly survey after the close of trading.</p>
<p>The early speculation is that the department will probably
report that the number of cattle on feedlots on April 1 rose
slightly from the same 1989 date.</p>
<p>The department is also expected to report that the number
of young cattle placed on feedlots, as well as the number of
fattened cattle sold from feedlots to slaughterhouses, fell
during the quarter.</p>
