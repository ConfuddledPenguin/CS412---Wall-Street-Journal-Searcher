	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Software entrepreneur Frank H. Dodge dropped a
previously disclosed lawsuit in Massachusetts that alleged
Dun & Bradstreet Corp. and the software company he founded
were interfering with his efforts to get re-established in
the industry.
   Through his attorneys, Mr. Dodge filed a notice of
voluntary dismissal in state Superior Court in Cambridge,
Mass., late Friday. The action came a day after the court had
declined to issue a preliminary injunction against Dun &
Bradstreet that Mr. Dodge had sought as part of his lawsuit.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Yesterday, a Dun & Bradstreet spokesman hailed the move as
a vindication. Mr. Dodge left the company earlier this year.
As reported, he had alleged that Dun & Bradstreet fired him
without cause as president and chief executive of the
McCormack & Dodge software unit. Thus, the suit argued, he
wasn't bound by an agreement that bars him from competing
against the software company for a year. Dun & Bradstreet
responded that Mr. Dodge resigned and therefore was subject
to the terms of the agreement.</p>
<p>Mr. Dodge and a co-founder sold McCormack & Dodge to Dun &
Bradstreet in 1983, and he had stayed on as president.</p>
