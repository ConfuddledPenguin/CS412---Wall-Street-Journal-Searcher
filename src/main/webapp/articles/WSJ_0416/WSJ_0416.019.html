	<p class="article-leader">HARTFORD, Conn. -- What's knocking out the Democratic
governors of New England?
   All three of them -- first Michael Dukakis of
Massachusetts, then William O'Neill of Connecticut and
finally Madeleine Kunin of Vermont -- are bowing out of
re-election bids. The result is that these states will plunge
into the 1990s without the political figures who dominated
them for most of the 1980s.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The easy answer to the region's predominant political
riddle is the soft economy here in New England. Growth in
personal income lags behind the national average, the
high-tech and banking industries are in full-blown crises,
and the states are struggling with budget deficits -- all at
a time when the fires of taxpayer revolts are being stoked
and when governors are facing startling levels of political
resentment.</p>
<p>"We've all had to confront this situation," says Gov.
Dukakis, "and we are all facing the usual unhappiness that
comes with it."</p>
<p>But the region's economic woes also have served to
highlight other political difficulties the three have
suffered: Gov. Dukakis's disappointing presidential campaign,
which trumpeted his state's economic "miracle" at a time when
it was unraveling; Gov. O'Neill's management problems; and
Gov. Kunin's support for a state planning effort that town
after town bitterly rejected.</p>
<p>The three are leaving their respective statehouses with
frustration over the political climate created by a decade of
Republican presidents who have elevated opposition to taxes
into a civic religion.</p>
<p>"There has been a national climate painted about taxation
that makes the public want to listen to the easiest message,
and that's George Bush's message," says Gov. Kunin. "If
people hear that again and again, they start to wonder why we
don't behave that way at the state level."</p>
<p>Here in Connecticut, Mr. O'Neill sounds a similar theme.
"The mood of the times is `no new taxes,' and you can't run a
government that way," says Mr. O'Neill, who sits below an old
seal of Connecticut in the governor's office. "Not only has
the federal government been irresponsible in not sending
money to the communities, it's been irresponsible in not
raising taxes when they're needed, and more irresponsible in
saying we don't need to raise taxes."</p>
<p>The federal share of 60 major state programs dropped to
22% in 1988 from 36% in 1981. "The New Federalism is a way
for Washington to pass the buck -- not the dollar buck, but
the responsibility buck -- to the states," Mr. O'Neill
complains. "It's very difficult to run for office in this
kind of atmosphere. People resent raising taxes and don't
understand why I have to do it and Washington doesn't have
to."</p>
<p>But Mr. O'Neill's critics argue that the governor
squandered a $1.3 billion surplus over four years. "There was
a boom in New England and unfortunately booms are followed by
busts," says Democratic Rep. Bruce Morrison, who is hoping to
succeed Mr. O'Neill. "None of these governors was able to
repeal the laws of economics or even to foresee that the
booms would end."</p>
<p>Today, Mr. O'Neill estimates a $196 million fiscal-year
deficit, though legislative leaders' estimates run closer to
$220 million. State figures show that payroll positions
increased every year for the past decade -- a 23% increase in
the O'Neill years -- with payroll costs nearly tripling.</p>
<p>"The way the Democrats spend and mismanage explains the
whole thing," says Republican state Rep. Gene Migliaro, a
former Democrat who is a 16-year veteran of the
Appropriations Committee. "It all caught up with them. You
can't spend what you don't have, and they finally woke up to
it."</p>
<p>The economic problems and the invective are even harsher
in Massachusetts, where Mr. Dukakis is being criticized for
ignoring or papering over a weak state financial picture long
enough to win the 1988 Democratic presidential nomination.</p>
<p>"People feel that Dukakis and the Democratic leadership
deceived them about the economy," says Alexander Tennant,
executive director of the Massachusetts Republican Party.
"He's the best thing that's ever happened to the Republican
Party here."</p>
<p>Last week, Democratic state Rep. Richard Voke, chairman of
the House Ways and Means Committee, estimated that the state
needed an extra $2.3 billion over the next 15 months, adding
that he envisioned a major tax package, large spending cuts
and a bond sale. The state's budget deficit now is estimated
at $900 million, though some in the Statehouse believe it may
be even higher.</p>
<p>"Taxes are never popular, but given our relatively low
burden we have to do it," says Mr. Dukakis, who is leaving
after a dozen years -- "probably the maximum useful life of a
governor," in his estimation -- in office. "I hope people
will give us credit for standing up and doing the right
thing," he says. Massachusetts House Speaker George Keverian
told reporters and editors of the Boston Globe last week that
the House would pass a tax increase if Mr. Dukakis, whom he
described as "the most hated man in the state," would resign.</p>
<p>The difficulties are being compounded by serious revenue
problems, with the state now projecting that it will actually
receive less this year than last. "These revenue declines,"
says Mr. Dukakis, "were predicted by nobody last year."</p>
<p>Indeed, income-tax withholding is still slightly above
last year's levels, but corporate-tax receipts are down
nearly 15% and sales-tax receipts are down about 5%. "With
things this bad, you'd think the booze tax money would be
up," says Richard Manley, who directs the non-partisan
Massachusetts Taxpayers Foundation, "but even that's down."</p>
<p>Amid the rubble, there's little sympathy for Mr. Dukakis,
who argues that "governors of other states who did not run
for the presidency are having problems." One private GOP poll
of a solidly Democratic state senate district in the central
Massachusetts city of Worcester shows the governor with an
unfavorable rating of 89%.</p>
<p>"There's no way he could run," says Mr. Manley, who has
been unremittingly critical of the governor. "He's getting
blamed for a heck of a lot that he didn't do. There were a
lot of bad decisions made around here in the banking and
high-tech industries that he had nothing to do with, and the
Legislature deserves some blame. But the governor signed the
budget and there's a feeling he lied about the fiscal health
of the state when he was running for president."</p>
<p>The phenomenon of three Democratic governors stepping down
simultaneously also underlines the risks of the job. "The
longer you're governor, the tougher it is," says Frank Bryan,
a University of Vermont specialist in state government. "In
Congress you survive by doing favors for people. As governor
you have to make tough decisions. You can get a lot done in
the governorship, but it's a political graveyard."</p>
<p>Vermont's Gov. Kunin, who faces a revenue shortfall of $45
million, discovered these limits when she pressed towns on a
planning law, Act 200, designed to direct development, assure
the availability of affordable housing and protect
agricultural land. More than a hundred towns voted it down,
only a dozen accepted it, and she became so unpopular that
one Vermont town actually voted on whether to permit her to
speak at the town meeting.</p>
<p>It's not just Democrats who are affected. New Hampshire's
Gov. Judd Gregg faces a budget deficit and a surprisingly
strong challenge from former Democratic state chairman Joseph
Grandmaison. Maine's Gov. John McKernan faces a fight from
Democratic Rep. Joseph Brennan, who wants to recapture Blaine
House, the governor's mansion he relinquished four years ago.
And Rhode Island's Edward DiPrete faces very low poll
ratings.</p>
<p>"The Republican governors are not immune from all of
this," says David Moore, a University of New Hampshire
political scientist. "The economy is not good for incumbents,
and people like Gov. Gregg are finding that their performance
ratings aren't all that impressive."</p>
