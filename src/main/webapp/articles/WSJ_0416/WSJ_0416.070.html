said it has received 11,843,089 shares in its $1.64 billion,
or $75-a-share, offer for Norton Co.

previously held, it had 64.1% of the Norton common
outstanding. The company earlier indicated it expected to
receive between 50% and 70% of the shares in the offer.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Norton, a Worcester, Mass., abrasives maker, is fighting
the tender offer; the company is looking for an alternative
suitor or investor to thwart BTR's bid. The company has also
lobbied Massachusetts lawmakers to pass a law that could
delay the installation of new directors in the proxy fight
BTR is waging against Norton. The proxy vote is scheduled at
an annual meeting April 26.</p>

tender offer until 9 p.m. eastern time April 27. The offer
