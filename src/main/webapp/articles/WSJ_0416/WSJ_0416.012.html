	<p class="article-leader">CANAKKALE, Turkey -- The band snaps to attention as a few
nonagenarian veterans from Turkey's war of independence stand
unsteadily by.
   But as President Turgut Ozal arrives to celebrate the
Ottoman defense of the Dardanelles Strait during World War I,
Canakkale's elected mayor refuses to stand.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>In fact, the mayor used the occasion last month to attack
Turkey's "sultans," adding: "Anyone taking decisions without
the people's support is condemned to be lost in the darkness
of history." Hours later, the minister of the interior fired
the mayor.</p>
<p>Such unpleasant schisms are multiplying, weakening the
already brittle structure of the Turkish republic. A
stumbling government, political boycotts, student protests,
terrorism, Kurdish insurgency and growing Islamic
fundamentalism, are brewing what one senior Western diplomat
calls a "dire scenario" for the 55 million people of Turkey,
a member of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.</p>
<p>Mr. Ozal says that he now plans to take the unusual step
of heading some cabinet meetings. Turkish presidents usually
don't get involved in cabinet deliberations. "Maybe I will do
it every month. They won't like it, but . . . I can help
them," he says.</p>
<p>Prime minister of Turkey from 1983 until he was elected
president in November 1989, Mr. Ozal may be secure for his
seven-year term. But the Motherland Party he founded in 1983
isn't as sanguine about its ability to hold together and hold
off opposition demands for early parliamentary elections, now
set for 1992.</p>
<p>Three national opinion polls last month put support at 12%
or less for the Motherland Party, a center-right grouping of
Islamists, reformists, nationalists and free-market
advocates. "None of them wants to accept that the story of
Ozal and the Motherland is over," wrote Hasan Cemal, editor
of the left-wing Comhuriyet newspaper.</p>
<p>The man Mr. Ozal chose to succeed him as prime minister
last November, Yildirim Akbulut, a slow-speaking provincial
lawyer, faces ridicule as books of Akbulut jokes become best
sellers. The minister of foreign affairs resigned in February
and the minister of finance quit in March to prepare bids to
succeed Mr. Akbulut.</p>
<p>Mr. Ozal, 62 years old, officially has cut his ties with
Motherland because of his presidential vow to be "without
bias." But he says he is still the guiding hand behind
Turkey, and he firmly lists the wide powers available to the
president under Turkey's 1982 constitution. Turkey's system
of government, similar to France's, has a president and prime
minister.</p>
<p>Diplomats say major foreign governments all deal directly
with Mr. Ozal, sometimes bypassing the Foreign Ministry. When
a ministerial post falls vacant, Mr. Ozal names the
successor. Economic decision-makers meet monthly for
"briefings" at Mr. Ozal's palace.</p>
<p>Indeed, Mr. Ozal uses the flourishing economy -- which he
has controlled for a decade -- to silence his critics. "If
there are no economic problems, {the opposition} cannot
collect the masses," he says.</p>
<p>The lifting of foreign-exchange controls, an export boom
and rapid tourism development have reversed Turkey's
once-chronic foreign-currency shortages. Turkey registered
balance-of-payments surpluses of $1.5 billion in 1988 and
$966 million in 1989. The account is still in the black, Mr.
Ozal says, though the foreign trade deficit has widened
recently as import growth has far outpaced that of exports.
The trade deficit ballooned to $504 million in January from
$292 million a year earlier, the national statistics bureau
said April 13.</p>
<p>Foreign investment hit a record $650 million last year and
officials and bankers say it hasn't let up this year. But not
everyone has shared in the wealth.</p>
<p>Austerity budgets have brought inflation that hit 87% in
1988 down to 62% for the fiscal year ended March 31. But
gross national product, the total value of goods and
services, slowed to 1.7% growth in 1989, down from 3.4% in
1988, 7.4% in 1987 and 8.1% in 1986. Industrial production
has been picking up steam, but Istanbul's business leaders
are concerned about rising public dissatisfaction and
political uncertainty, which has paralyzed bureaucrats who
control 60% of the country's production and regulate the
rest.</p>
<p>The Motherland Party has resisted calls for early
elections since it lost many municipal elections in March
1989. It has been helped by the lack of credible alternative
policies from the two main opposition parties on the left and
right. They are even in the polls but neither is likely to
win a parliamentary majority.</p>
<p>While the political establishment is locked in battle and
the army, which intervened in political crises in 1960, 1971
and 1980, remains on the sidelines, forces outside the
traditional framework are winning sympathy. Western diplomats
are concerned about the rising power of Islamic
fundamentalists.</p>
<p>Mr. Ozal insists that Islam is moderate in Turkey and that
pressure on religion only breeds extremism. He sees a greater
danger in the southeast, where ethnic Kurds are becoming
increasingly militant. PKK, the main Kurdish guerrilla group,
is organizing protests in Kurdish-speaking southeast Turkey
modeled after the Palestinian intifada. More than 2,000
people have died in violence since the PKK started armed
attacks in 1984.</p>
<p>Sitting high above Istanbul in his luxury apartment in the
army's main hotel, Mr. Ozal says he believes Turkey is a
stabilizing influence amid the changes sweeping its Balkan
and Soviet neighbors. Turkey embarked on a course of economic
liberalization in 1983 on which its neighbors are only
beginning to embark, he says.</p>
<p>But long-promised political liberalization has slipped
down the agenda, sparking criticism from human-rights groups
such as Helsinki Watch, which said 400 Turkish journalists
were prosecuted for their writings in 1989. An overhaul of
the most restrictive articles of Turkey's 1926 penal code
probably won't be ready until after the summer, Mr. Ozal
says.</p>
<p>Amnesty International and other groups repeatedly have
accused Turkish police of systematic torture. "Ozal doesn't
favor torture, but I think he is unconcerned. The police are
acting almost independently in this matter, out of control. .
. ." says Istanbul Human Rights Association chief Emile Galip
Sandalci.</p>
