	<p class="article-leader">For this season's power tie, think red with white polka
dots.
   On a recent newscast on the "NBC Nightly News," no fewer
than five people, including Secretary of State James A. Baker
III and anchor Tom Brokaw, wore dotted red ties. Even the guy
in the AT&T commercial wore one, as did a subway mugging
victim interviewed later on "Inside Edition." On another
newscast, President Bush wore one.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"I have noticed there is a kind of . . . generic uniform
around," consisting of said tie, a blue suit and a white
shirt, says Mr. Brokaw. Not to be upstaged, Dan Rather, Ted
Koppel and John Chancellor are among those who've been seen
wearing the tie. But Mr. Brokaw notes there wasn't any
power-tie premeditation involved in selecting the tie, which
happens to be the oldest one he has. But if the polka-dotted
red tie is, indeed, the power tie, then "I'm not getting my
share of power," says Mr. Brokaw.</p>
<p>Esquire magazine's fashion director, Bob Beauchamp, traces
the emergence of the red-patterned tie to the presidential
campaign, where the uniform was, not surprisingly, red tie,
white shirt and blue suit. But, he says, "I don't know if
there is a power tie after the yellow tie" (the power-tie
color of the go-go '80s).</p>
<p>Joseph Abboud, the men's designer noted for his splashier
tie designs, sees the red-patterned tie as a flight to
safety. "I can't tell the difference between the airline
pilots and the politicians anymore," says Mr. Abboud, who
designed the wardrobe of "Today" show host Bryant Gumbel for
the Olympics. Although Mr. Abboud isn't suggesting that men
start wearing ties with naked ladies on them, "we've got to
get these guys to be more daring."</p>
<p>At Bigsby & Kruthers, an upscale men's retailer in Chicago
with such power customers as basketball star Michael Jordan,
"Everybody's becoming a little more aggressive" in their
choice of ties, says Brent Lob, manager of the Water Tower
store. "People are turning to ties" to express themselves, he
says. But at the more traditional Brooks Brothers near Wall
Street, which has seen a resurgence in sales of polka dots,
"Red is the power color," says manager Ivan Clements.</p>
<p>In any case, the wrong tie could be an albatross around
one's neck. As Mr. Brokaw says somewhat ruefully: "One thing
I've learned, no matter what you say, no matter what the news
is, more people will respond to your tie than anything else."</p>
