	<p class="article-leader">MEXICO CITY -- Unemployment in Mexico declined in 1989,
the government news agency Notimex said.
   Open unemployment dropped to 2.4% for the first 11 months
of 1989, half a point below the December 1988 level, the
agency said, citing a Budget and Planning Department report.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The figure is considered conservative. Private economists
estimate combined unemployment and underemployment at around
40%.</p>
<p>The biggest declines in joblessness were in the northern
cities of Monterrey and Torreon, along with Mexico City,
Merida, Orizaba and Puebla.</p>
