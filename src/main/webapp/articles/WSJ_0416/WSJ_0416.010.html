	<p class="article-leader">One of the spinoffs of the political upheaval in middle
Europe is a new confusion of two familiar political terms,
"liberal" and "conservative."
   They have been common coinage in Britain at least since
the 18th century and have been used elsewhere since, but with
increasingly less precision of meaning. The imprecision
widens when they are applied to Soviet and East European
politics.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The etymology is clear enough. Conservative has roots
implying preservation of the status quo. Liberal draws on
Latin roots relating to freedom. In its early usage it
implied a break with tradition, particularly monarchical
constraints on freedom.</p>
<p>But such broad terms cannot escape contradictions. In the
U.S., the two words often adhere to their original meanings
when applied to social attitudes. Liberals indeed tend to be
more liberal than conservatives on matters such as explicit
sex on TV. But that is not a hard and fast rule. Many are
hellbent to prevent their fellow citizens from smoking
cigarettes. On politico-economic issues, the meanings often
reverse themselves entirely. U.S. conservatives, not
liberals, usually are the ones demanding greater freedom from
the power of the state, just as did the 19th-century liberal
John Stuart Mill.</p>
<p>Jimmy Carter, who had styled himself a conservative
Democrat, began the serious work of economic deregulation in
the U.S. in the late 1970s. Ronald Reagan, a conservative
Republican, carried it through. Margaret Thatcher is also a
conservative economic liberationist.</p>
<p>When Soviet communism was born 72 years ago, the two terms
had little application. Stalin certainly wasn't a
"conservative" when he was seizing the farms of peasants and
murdering those who resisted. Nor was he a "liberal,"
although some Western liberals of the 1930s were sympathetic
toward his revolutionary experiments. They believed he was
emancipating Russians from serfdom. The press of that era
somehow never managed to reveal the enormity of Stalin's
crimes.</p>
<p>Now politicians in Russia and its former satellites are
eligible to be called liberals or conservatives as those
political systems open up to public debate. But that brings a
further loss of precision. The press and academics often
refer to communist traditionalists -- some would call them
neo-Stalinists -- as conservatives and Soviet reformers as
liberals. Mikhail Gorbachev is a "liberal." The Pamyat
Russian nationalists are "conservatives."</p>
<p>To the literal-minded, William F. Buckley Jr. would be an
excellent candidate for the editorship of Pravda, were it not
for the fact that Pravda, after losing large chunks of
circulation, is trying to make itself more "liberal." Mr.
Buckley will have to look elsewhere.</p>
<p>Many American liberals see no contradiction. President
Gorbachev, they say, represents progressive forces, much as
Teddy Kennedy does in the U.S. It was perfectly natural for
these two to meet at the Kremlin recently so that the Russian
liberal could assure the American liberal that the Red Army
will not use force against Lithuania -- maybe.</p>
<p>But then one must ask about some other folks who are
giving Mr. Gorbachev a bit of trouble. Are the leaders who
are overthrowing Soviet rule in Eastern Europe trying to
preserve the status quo? Is it possible to describe the
daredevil Lithuanian secessionist, Vytautas Landsbergis, as a
"conservative?"</p>
<p>What all of this means is that politics can never be
reduced to simple definitive terms. In some sense, the labels
fit. American conservatives are more likely than liberals to
cling to the values of their forefathers, just as Russian
conservatives pine for the Marxist-Leninist verities of 1918.
But keep in mind that American and Russian conservatives are
upholding opposite sets of values. The desire for less state
involvement in their lives easily makes Mr. Landsbergis, East
German Prime Minister Lothar de Maiziere, Czech President
Vaclav Havel and the other revolutionary leaders of Eastern
Europe conservatives in the American sense.</p>
<p>Now, this is not an indirect way of calling American
liberals communists. There is another important distinction.
American liberals and conservatives alike are by and large
ardent democrats. Even when American liberals engage in the
Marxist-style politics of class warfare, they cannot be
equated with the Russian conservatives who happily renounce
democratic process on the grounds that it interferes with the
egalitarianism they profess.</p>
<p>The terms liberal and conservative are imprecise but the
word democracy has a definite meaning. It was clearly
understood by the royalists of the 18th century, who referred
to it as "mobocracy," and it is understood by the Communist
apparatchiks of today, who also view it with fear and scorn.
It is no accident that the U.S. began to have more
foreign-policy success when, in the 1980s, it made the spread
of democracy a key goal.</p>
<p>There is no confusion about democracy between Vytautas
Landsbergis and the Pamyat folks across the way in Leningrad.
The Lithuanians took a vote, a real one. Nobody appointed
Pamyat as the guardian of all things good in the Russian
culture. That kind of distinction is the one most clear to
the peoples who have been throwing out Communist parties
throughout Europe.</p>
<p>Through having lived under statist absolutism, they also
have a vivid sense of the connection between democracy and
market economics. Democracy lets individuals vote for their
leaders. Market economics lets them vote their preferences in
goods and services. In both cases, the principle of private
property comes into play.</p>
<p>Democracy cannot thrive where the state is everyone's
landlord and thus can exercise absolute power over the lives
of individuals, determining what housing, what jobs, what
farm plots will be awarded to whom. In the Soviet Union
today, people are voting against a Communist Party that
exercises such enormous control over their lives, but with a
combination of desperation and fear, and with an expectation
that at some point -- maybe beginning with Lithuania -- the
party will retaliate.</p>
<p>As for market economics, it also is impossible to have a
market economy without private property. Markets result from
individuals making judgments about how much they are willing
to pay to own property. Bargaining over property you don't
own is like playing poker with matchsticks.</p>
<p>The words conservative and liberal will not be banished.
Bill Buckley, a man of formidable language skills, will
continue to call himself a conservative just as Sen. Daniel
Patrick Moynihan, similarly gifted, will cheerfully call
himself a liberal. Whatever the terms, voters won't have much
trouble deciding whom they want to lead them -- providing a
choice is available.</p>
