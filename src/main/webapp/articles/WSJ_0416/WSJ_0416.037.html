	<p class="article-leader">John Neff has had some pretty lean years in his quarter
century as manager of the $8 billion Windsor Fund. But 1989
was the roughest year of all.
   "I was down 17 percentage points {relative to the
market}," notes the 58-year-old Mr. Neff, shaking his head in
disgust. "Never been down that much before."</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Mr. Neff often sees value where others only see problems,
so he's often buying what the crowd is selling. But in 1989
he found himself wildly out of touch with the mood of the
market.</p>
<p>"People were giving lip service to a soft landing {for the
economy}, but they weren't betting on it." he says. "That's
what killed us last year." Although he was up 15%, the
Standard & Poor's 500 zoomed past him with a 31.6% total
return, which is price change plus dividends.</p>
<p>After lagging behind the market so badly, many investors
might switch strategy. Not Mr. Neff. He's sticking with the
same strategy that has made him one of the country's
pre-eminent fund managers: buying stocks that trade at low
multiples of corporate earnings.</p>
<p>For him, that currently means betting big-three quarters
of Windsor's portfolio -- on cyclical industries such as
autos and aluminum and on financial stocks like banks and
insurers.</p>
<p>This year is likely to further test the mettle of Mr.
Neff, whose 20.7% annual return for Windsor's investors over
the past decade has comfortably beaten the 17.7% for the S&P
500. With bond yields up, corporate earnings seemingly
stalled and leveraged buy-outs moribund, "the froth should be
off" the stock market, says Mr. Neff, who thinks a 15% or 20%
market drop is possible.</p>
<p>Mr. Neff's dry spell began in January 1989, when Vanguard
Group reopened Windsor to new investors for five months. Some
$1.2 billion of new money poured in, flooding him with cash
just as the market was taking off. He entered 1989 with hefty
positions in the Big Three auto makers, International
Business Machines and Telefonica de Espana, all of which
trailed the market badly in 1989. Worse still was Bank of New
England, where problem loans have forced a halt in dividends
and pounded the shares to around $4, well below Windsor's $22
average cost.</p>
<p>So far, 1990 hasn't been much kinder. Windsor lost 2.9% in
the first quarter, against a 2.3% loss for the average stock
fund. Recently, one of Mr. Neff's favorite thrifts, Golden
West Financial, was marked down 20% as indiscriminate selling
beat down the stocks of savings and loans.</p>
<p>"We've been killed before," recalls Mr. Neff. Windsor
trailed the market badly in the early 1970s, as the
highflying "nifty 50" stocks zoomed and Mr. Neff's portfolio
plodded. Mr. Neff again lagged behind in 1980, as oil and
technology stocks soared.</p>
<p>But 1989 was especially bad. The year's big stock market
winners were companies specializing in beverages, foods,
household products, telephones and medical drugs, the sort of
products that continue to sell even in a recession. "That
wasn't high-expectation type of merchandise," notes Mr. Neff.
Nonetheless, these companies, which make up almost a third of
the S&P 500, were up 46% last year.</p>
<p>Mr. Neff's portfolio, by contrast, has been heavily
weighted toward the auto makers, financial companies such as
insurers, banks and thrifts and cyclical commodity companies
such as Lyondell Petrochemical, Alcan Aluminium, Bethlehem
Steel and International Paper. In part, this reflects Mr.
Neff's belief that there will indeed be a "soft landing" for
the economy.</p>
<p>But those sectors are also where Mr. Neff has found his
bargains with low price-earnings multiples, or P/Es. Mr.
Neff's portfolio now trades at six times his own estimates of
1990 earnings. He notes that his estimates are aggressive,
and says the consensus of Wall Street analysts would probably
put his portfolio at 7.5 times estimated 1990 earnings. But
either way, Mr. Neff's holdings are well below the S&P 500's
14 times estimated 1990 earnings.</p>
<p>Mr. Neff also looks for high dividend yields, and the
average yield on his holdings is currently 5.7%. In addition
to the dividends, Mr. Neff reckons his companies could see
earnings advance 9.9% this year, if his aggressive estimates
prove true.</p>
<p>Even if Mr. Neff's stocks remain mired at their current
lowly P/Es and his estimates prove, say, two percentage
points too optimistic, his shareholders could still do very
nicely. A company that enjoys 8% earnings growth, but stays
stuck at the same P/E, would by definition see its stock
price advance 8%.</p>
<p>That, plus the 5.7% yield, translates into a healthy 13.7%
annual return. But the big payoff comes if a company's
earnings growth garners attention from Wall Street analysts
and brokers, who then help shove up the stock price.</p>
<p>Since the start of the year, Mr. Neff has lowered his cash
position. But he still has 16% of Windsor's assets in
intermediate-term government bonds, certificates of deposit
and the corporate IOUs known as commercial paper. Even as he
sits on a hunk of cash, Mr. Neff is still bullish on
individual stocks.</p>
<p>Windsor's biggest position is Ford Motor, which earned
$9.06 a share last year (after nonrecurring items). Mr. Neff
estimates the company should earn between $8 and $9 a share
this year, despite a poor first quarter. He also thinks the
longer-term outlook for auto makers is anything but grim.</p>
<p>"The Big Three have given up about eight percentage points
in market penetration {in cars} to the Japanese," notes Mr.
Neff. "In the same time, they've improved their penetration
in trucks by eight percentage points. So what, you say?
Trucks are growing a hell of a lot faster than cars."</p>
<p>Mr. Neff has a hefty stake in Citicorp, the country's
biggest bank. He is much taken with the bank's consumer
banking business, particularly its credit card operation.
"They'll earn $3 a share this year on the consumer side," he
estimates. Mr. Neff reckons that Citicorp's consumer banking
business can grow at 15% to 20% a year, and is worth maybe 10
to 12 times its $3 earnings. If his match is right, Citicorp,
which closed last Thursday at 24 7/8, is trading for less
than the value of its consumer banking business.</p>
<p>Overall, Mr. Neff thinks that Citicorp will earn between
$4 and $4.50 a share this year, if it's a bad year. ("It
looks like we'll have a bad year," he adds.)</p>
<p>Among insurers, Mr. Neff is betting on Cigna, a big
multiline insurer. Cigna should benefit, he says, as rate
increases are applied to the commercial property and casualty
insurance policies coming up for renewal over the next 12
months.</p>
<p>But what really piqued Mr. Neff's interest was the
turnaround at Cigna's group health operation, particularly
its health maintenance organization and its preferred
provider organization, which are attracting corporate clients
anxious to limit burgeoning health costs.</p>
<p>Mr. Neff thinks Cigna should earn between $6 and $7.50
this year. "The reason it's so wide is because I don't know
what will happen on the catastrophe side," he explains.</p>
<p>So what will it take for the market's view of Cigna,
Citicorp and Ford to coincide with that of John Neff? For
value investors like Mr. Neff, that's the irritating
imponderable. "Eventually right wins out," says Mr. Neff,
"but you have to show a little patience in this business."</p>
<p>Mr. Neff has been managing Windsor, now the country's
second-largest stock fund, since 1964. He also runs two other
funds. One is a mutual fund, $120 million Vanguard High Yield
Stock Fund, which like Windsor is closed to new investors.
Mr. Neff says neither fund is likely to be reopened.</p>
<p>Those who want to invest with Mr. Neff should check out
the third fund he runs, $275 million Gemini II, a closed-end
fund that trades on the New York Stock Exchange. Unlike a
regular mutual fund, a closed-end issues only a fixed number
of shares, which then trade publicly just like any other
stock, meaning they can trade higher or lower than the
per-share portfolio value.</p>
<p>Gemini II is even more peculiar than most closed-ends.
It's a so-called dual-purpose fund, which means it has two
classes of shares outstanding, income shares and capital
shares. The income shareholders get all the dividends that
the fund collects, while the capital shareholders benefit
from any capital gains. Taken together, Gemini II's capital
and income shares are trading at a 5% premium to net asset
value.</p>
