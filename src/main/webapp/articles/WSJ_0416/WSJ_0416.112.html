	<p class="article-leader">TOKYO -- When the U.S. manager of a small high-tech
company sought to hire his first Japanese salesman, he was
advised to put a detective on the case. The executive
reluctantly agreed.
   The investigator's report was chock-full of information,
and some of it -- including how much the candidate paid for
his house or what sort of relationship he had with his wife
and neighbors -- was of questionable relevance to the
American. "I learned more about this guy than I ever wanted,"
the manager says.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>In the process, the executive also learned one of Japan's
secrets: Nosing around in other people's business has long
been big business.</p>
<p>And it's getting bigger. Part of the reason is the rising
number of foreign companies that are setting up shop in
Japan. Detectives say recent increases in mid-career
job-hopping, much of which involves foreign companies, have
given their industry a boost. Newcomers may even discover
they are targets of investigations.</p>
<p>The growing affluence of the Japanese also has swelled
demand for detectives' services. Business in background
checks on prospective Japanese business partners, employees,
and future sons-in-law or daughters-in-law has never been
better.</p>
<p>More spouses are having their mates investigated, thanks
in part to a rash of television dramas depicting men running
off with women in their office, or dejected wives sneaking
around while their husbands work overtime.</p>
<p>Japan's 1,000 detective agencies aren't numerous compared
with other countries, but many outfits elsewhere are one-man
offices. In Japan, it isn't uncommon for a detective agency
to have 20 investigators. The Teikoku Private Detective
Agency is a conglomerate, with some 500 full-time
investigators, 51 offices in Japan and one overseas branch in
Seoul, South Korea.</p>
<p>"Japanese people are very concerned about roots," explains
Midori Sato, president of Sato Midori Research Inc. At 69
years old, she is one of Japan's most-experienced private
investigators. "In the countryside, you know who's father did
what and if he went to jail. But in Tokyo, you don't even
know who lives next door to you."</p>
<p>Many Japanese consider it rude to confront delicate
matters directly. So those who need to know why someone quit
a job, whether a student really graduated from a prestigious
university, or if there are any skeletons in a would-be
in-law's closet, hire a detective.</p>
<p>Such information matters more here than in other places.
The flip side of lifetime employment is that it's difficult
to fire someone. New hires had better be clean. The stigma of
divorce is still so strong that protective parents want their
children to make the right choice the first time.</p>
<p>Mrs. Sato, who has done hundreds of investigations for
still-common arranged marriages, knows just how crucial such
a choice can be.</p>
<p>In 1959, she was asked to check out Michiko Shoda. After
an intense 20-day probe, Mrs. Sato filed a glowing report:
"She was a good student . . . a wonderful personality. She
was almighty." As the person requesting the investigation
didn't seem out of the ordinary, Mrs. Sato was surprised to
learn a few months later that Miss Shoda was engaged to Crown
Prince Akihito and would one day become empress.</p>
<p>Today, Mrs. Sato's 20-person firm, like many others, is
going global. Worried Japanese parents pay a minimum of
500,000 yen ($3,300) to find out if their child attending
school in the U.S. is really studying in a library before
examinations. Mrs. Sato recently calmed one Japanese couple
distraught over their daughter's plan to marry a
Chinese-American from Los Angeles. With the help of a U.S.
investigator, she concluded that "he came from a good
family."</p>
<p>Mac Jeffery, a U.S. businessman formerly stationed in
Tokyo, found out what it's like to be the object of an
investigation. He was dating a Japanese woman while her
parents, unaware of the affair, were trying to arrange a
match with a Japanese.</p>
<p>The woman went along with her parents until one of the
suitors got serious, ran a check on her and discovered she
had an American boyfriend. When he learned that he had been
followed, Mr. Jeffery fumed at the invasion of privacy.</p>
<p>"The first thing that went through my mind was, `Oh, my
God, have I done anything delinquent lately?' " he recalls.
"But then I just thought this happens all the time in Japan."</p>
<p>That tale at least had a happy ending: A few months later,
Mr. Jeffery married the woman.</p>
<p>Many agencies find there's still lots of yen to be made in
the bread-and-butter business of detectives everywhere:
chasing illicit affairs.</p>
<p>Katsuki Umiymama and Takao Kato are rookies learning the
trade by staking out a subject. The two young detectives from
the Kishimoto Research Agency were hired by a distressed
housewife to investigate her husband, whom she suspects is
having an affair with a family friend.</p>
<p>On a recent evening, the detectives parked their red
Nissan outside a downtown Tokyo newspaper company and waited
for their man to emerge.</p>
<p>Neither one expected much action tonight. That's because
the previous night was a huge success: They tailed their man
to a nearby restaurant and then photographed him dining with
his mistress. Settling in for a long night, Mr. Umiyama, 19,
cranked up the radio and wondered aloud: "Do you think anyone
would deliver pizza to a parked car?"</p>
<p>After five hours without seeing their man, 25-year-old Mr.
Kato called the boss on his portable telephone and reported:
"I guess he really is working late tonight."</p>
<p>Such seamy associations still tend to overshadow the
commercial and cultural side of the business. "Detectives
don't have a very good image," says a Japanese banker.
Indeed, there are plenty of cases of shady detectives using
hot information to blackmail clients.</p>
<p>The police say clamping down is difficult because, unlike
many other countries, Japan doesn't require detectives to be
licensed. For their part, private investigators are trying to
upgrade their image with a newly formed industry association.</p>
<p>Private eyes have a long history in Japan. While many of
the oldest detective agencies began as compilers of Japanese
versions of Who's Who, business really took off after World
War II. As people rushed to jobs in the big cities,
background checks on small and medium-sized companies and job
candidates became standard.</p>
<p>Michinao Kodama traces the industry's roots back further,
to the ancient Japanese art of ninjutsu. Ninja were spies
trained to enter enemy territory to obtain information for
their masters.</p>
<p>For 20 years, Mr. Kodama has been trying to instill the
ninja spirit in young investigators at his school for
detectives in western Tokyo.</p>
<p>In a three-month course, students learn research,
shadowing and disguise techniques. More advanced students
focus on corporate spying skills: how to get on with senior
company officials and discreetly pick their brains for
information about a new product or strategy. Mr. Kodama
refuses to divulge his techniques to outsiders. In another
security measure, students aren't told one another's names or
backgrounds.</p>
<p>That makes for rather bizarre graduation ceremonies.
Instead of reading the names on the diploma, Mr. Kodama tests
the students with a silent roll call. "If you don't know how
to read the teacher's eyes and face and know its your turn
you're not ready to be a detective," he says.</p>
<p>So far, about 1,000 students have passed the test,
including Jack Torrance, a private eye from California. Mr.
Torrance, enrolled in Mr. Kodama's school in 1980 to hone his
skills for the local market. "The Japanese are masters at
shadowing," he says.</p>
<p>Believed to be the only resident foreign detective in
Japan, Mr. Torrance operates from an office he calls
Baskerville House -- to give the place that Sherlock Holmes
touch. He divides his time between foreign and Japanese
clients and isn't afraid to take on cases involving the
Yakuza, a Japanese organized-crime syndicate.</p>
<p>Oddly enough, Mr. Torrance says being a foreigner is his
greatest asset. "Foreigners see another foreigner, and they
remember everything. But the Japanese never really see
foreigners."</p>
