	<p class="article-leader">HONG KONG -- The Hong Kong hotel industry, long envied
world-wide for its full houses and firm rates, faces hard
times.
   Visitor arrivals have yet to recover from the slump that
followed the June 4, 1989, crackdown on protesters in
Beijing. At the same time, the number of hotel rooms in the
British colony continues to multiply, as hotels planned years
ago are completed. Further, a persistent labor shortage
threatens to erode an international reputation for exemplary
service.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"There will be lean times for two years, even if China
comes back," predicts Peter Jentes, general manager of the
575-room Grand Hyatt Hong Kong, which opened in December.</p>
<p>Indeed, hoteliers and industry analysts expect competition
for hotel guests to intensify during the next year. Room
discounts have become commonplace, which may be good news for
travelers, but bodes ill for new hotels with heavy
construction-related debts. "The newer properties have to
have cash flow," says James Smith, general manager of the
Hong Kong Hilton and chairman of the Hong Kong Hotels
Association.</p>
<p>Stock analysts take a bearish view of Hong Kong-listed
hotel companies. In a report on the hotel sector published in
May, Baring Securities (Hong Kong) Ltd. said: "Declining
occupancies and intensifying competition will limit the
upside potential in room rates and hence profitability in the
medium term."</p>
<p>Two years ago, it was difficult to obtain a hotel room in
Hong Kong without making reservations far in advance. Aided
by a tourism and a business boom in China, average hotel
occupancy rates reached 90% in 1987 and 92% in 1988, compared
with an international average of about 65%.</p>
<p>But then came the rapid supply increase and the tourism
slowdown. The average occupancy rate slid to 79% last year --
still high by international standards, but Hong Kong's lowest
annual average for the decade -- and hoteliers predict the
rate will fall to 60% this year. Some of the leading hotels
on Hong Kong Island, the site of most of the new
construction, may have trouble maintaining occupancy rates
above 50% during the June-September slow season.</p>
<p>Although part of the blame lies with Beijing, Hong Kong's
hotel woes are largely of the industry's own making and could
have been foreseen before events last year in China. A hotel
building boom began in the late 1980s, prompted by a stream
of record years for visitor arrivals in the colony that
developers mistakenly thought wouldn't end soon.</p>
<p>In 1988, according to figures from the Hong Kong Tourist
Association, there were 65 hotels in Hong Kong with a total
of 22,882 rooms. By the end of this year, there will be 77
hotels with 30,572 rooms, a 34% increase in the number of
rooms in two years. By the end of 1992, there will be 96
hotels with 36,572 rooms -- a 60% increase in rooms in four
years.</p>
<p>These increases in capacity were meant to accommodate
growing numbers of visitors from around the globe. In 1980,
2.3 million people visited Hong Kong; by 1988, the figure had
risen to 5.6 million. The increased traffic was fueled in
part by the opening of China to foreign investment and
tourism. Also swelling the numbers was the strong
appreciation of the yen, which prompted a flood of Japanese
tourists seeking bargains in Hong Kong shops. Taiwan's
decision in 1987 to relax regulations on overseas travel by
its citizens added significantly to the influx.</p>
<p>But even with such strong underpinnings, the high
occupancy levels of Hong Kong hotels couldn't last
indefinitely. Indeed, with the opening of several large
hotels in late 1988 and early 1989, occupancy rates started
slipping back into the 80% range.</p>
<p>Then came June 4. Wholesale cancelations of China tours
and business travel reverberated through the colony.
Occupancy rates tumbled in June and July, nearly emptying
hotels that had booked Chinatour groups from the U.S. and
Europe. (Although Hong Kong is a major business and tourist
destination in its own right, China-related travelers are a
significant portion of the market. The Hong Kong Tourist
Association estimates that 23% of visitors to Hong Kong in
1989 also visited China, down from 28% in 1988.)</p>
<p>Since the start of this year, visitor arrivals have been
creeping back to pre-June 4 levels, but aren't expected to
keep pace with the increase in room supply. Visitor arrivals
in 1989 fell 4.1% from the previous year to about 5.4
million, the first decline in more than a decade. Before June
4, a rise of 11% to 13% had been forecast for the year.</p>
<p>Yet, the 1989 decline might have been worse if the local
tourism industry hadn't moved quickly with heavy advertising
campaigns and hotel promotions. The government-funded tourist
association spent an extra 25 million Hong Kong dollars
(US$3.2 million) on promotions and advertising between June 4
and the March 31 end of the association's fiscal year. It
focused on Southeast Asia to lure short-haul visitors to
replace the Americans and Europeans who were canceling China
tours or were afraid that violence might spill into Hong
Kong.</p>
<p>So far, the strategy appears to be working. Southeast
Asian visitor arrivals in the first four months of 1990
jumped 16.1% from a year earlier, according to tourist
association figures, while total visitor arrivals were down
1% from a year earlier.</p>
<p>"We're actually a little ahead of our forecast on
arrivals," says Douglas King, general manager of marketing
for the association. He predicts visitor arrivals this year
will grow 8% to 10% from last year and will exceed the 1988
record.</p>
<p>Such projections do little to reassure the hotel industry.
"Although visitor numbers are just behind last year, the
hotels aren't getting the same clientele as before," says Mr.
Smith of the Hilton. That's because visitors from North
America, Europe and Australia continue to stay away in large
numbers, and these visitors tend to stay in top-market
hotels, where the room glut is greatest.</p>
<p>In the first four months of this year, the number of
visitors from the U.S., the colony's No. 3 source, fell 14.2%
from a year earlier. European arrivals declined 8.8%, and
arrivals from Australia fell 11.2%. The number of visitors
from Japan, the colony's No. 1 market accounting for 22.9% of
arrivals, were down only 0.3% during the period, and the
number coming from Taiwan, the No. 2 market accounting for
22.8% of arrivals, rose 1.9%.</p>
<p>The problem is that those visitors who have taken up the
slack since June 4 -- mostly from Taiwan and Southeast Asia
-- are checking into two-star and three-star hotels,
preferring to save their money for shopping. Only 15.7% of
the average daily expenditure of Taiwan visitors went for
hotels, while Southeast Asians spent 28.3% on hotels. By
contrast, North Americans shelled out 47.4% of their daily
spending on hotels, Europeans spent 44.3%, and Australians
spent 36.5%.</p>
<p>Hoteliers working with overseas tour directors say it
could be as late as 1992 before Americans and Europeans start
heading back to China through Hong Kong in big numbers. In
addition to their concerns about political stability in
China, Americans and Europeans are being drawn away from Asia
by new opportunities to travel in Eastern Europe.</p>
<p>The Hilton's Mr. Smith expects the turnaround to come in
October 1991, the start of the annual high season for
tourism. Meanwhile, he predicts that the recently refurbished
Hilton's occupancy rate will drop this year to an average of
66% from 86% last year. The Hilton has cut its average room
rate 10% since a year ago to HK$1,150, he says, adding that
the Hilton, which takes in a mix of business travelers and
tourists, is a good indicator of general trends in the local
market.</p>
