	<p class="article-leader">Korean Airlines is expected to sign a contract today for
23 747-400 Boeing jumbo jets in a deal valued at almost $4
billion.
   The transaction would mark the third giant order for
Boeing Co. from Asia in the past few weeks, underscoring the
rapid growth in that market.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Seattle-based Boeing, the world's leading commercial
airplane maker, has scheduled a news conference for 11 a.m.
in Washington, D.C., to mark the signing.</p>
<p>In addition to the attendance of Boeing Chairman Frank
Shrontz and C.H. Cho, a senior executive vice president of
Korean Airlines, lawmakers also have been invited, a signal
that the South Koreans hope will show that they're continuing
to try and reduce the U.S.'s merchandise trade deficit with
their country. The deficit, according to Commerce Department
figures, stood at $6.3 billion at the end of 1989.</p>
<p>Boeing declined to disclose what kinds of planes Korean
Airlines will purchase, but an official at the carrier said
it will make 12 firm orders for 747-400s, as well as 11
"re-confirmations" for the four-engine aircraft. A
re-confirmation gives Korean Airlines the right to cancel at
a future date, but it is considered more of a commitment than
taking out options. Deliveries are planned to begin in 1991.</p>
<p>Sources close to the transaction cautioned that the
numbers could slightly change before the contract signing.</p>
<p>The airline executive said Korean Airlines will pay about
$170 million each for the 747s, adjusted for inflation.</p>
<p>The official said that Korean Airlines also considered
Airbus Industrie's A-330 planes, but he said the Boeing
aircraft "are particularly suited" for trans-Pacific and
European routes. Airbus's A-330s also won't be ready until
several years after the Boeing planes are available.</p>
<p>It wasn't immediately clear which of the world's
jet-engine manufacturers -- General Electric Co., Rolls-Royce
PLC or United Technologies Corp.'s Pratt & Whitney unit --
will power the planes. An engine order often lags an aircraft
order. Pratt & Whitney, though, has been named the supplier
for nine other 747-400s bought in the past by Korean
Airlines.</p>
<p>The Korean Airlines order -- which follows a $2 billion
deal with China's Civil Aviation Administration and a $3.1
billion booking for 747-400s for Japan Airlines -- could
boost Boeing's stock price.</p>
<p>The stock hit a 52-week high last Monday at $87. It
slumped later in the week, closing Friday in New York Stock
Exchange composite trading at $82.50, off $1.375.</p>
<p>Judith Comeau, aerospace analyst for Goldman, Sachs & Co.,
attributed the fall to profit-taking, noting that a number of
other blue-chips have suffered a similar fate over the past
few days. But she believes there is plenty of upside
potential left in the stock. "It is much too early to sell
Boeing," she said.</p>
<p>Ms. Comeau pointed out that the 747-400 is a particularly
hot commodity right now. She said she recently visited AMR
Corp.'s American Airlines unit, for instance, where officials
are struggling to find a leasing company or another source
that can provide six 747s. "They can't get them anywhere,"
she said, explaining that they'll "probably have to settle
for" smaller McDonnell Douglas MD-11 trijets.</p>
<p>The demand for the 747 is particularly acute in the
Pacific Rim. Boeing's own forecast is that air traffic to
Asia from North America and Europe will soar 9% annually
through the next decade. Within Asia, air traffic is expected
to surge over the same period almost 8%, and within the U.S.
only 5.2%.</p>
