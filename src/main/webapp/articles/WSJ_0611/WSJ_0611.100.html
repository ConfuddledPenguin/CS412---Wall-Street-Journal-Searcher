	<p class="article-leader">From an Aruba hotel to a Zambia mine, the stocks of
companies in just about any corner of the world are easier
for U.S. investors to buy with this month's launch of the
over-the-counter market's new Bulletin Board.
   That may be a blessing or a curse.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Since June 1, such well-known international names as
Volkswagen, Nestle and West Germany's Deutsche Bank have
begun popping up on the computer screens of dealers using the
OTC Bulletin Board. Just one week old, the electronic system
allows eligible dealers to indicate twice daily the prices
they're willing to pay for hundreds of foreign securities,
previously quoted once a day in the Pink Sheets.</p>
<p>Traders say the new system, while it has its "bugs,"
promises to make it easier and more efficient to trade
international stocks. But one regulator who is keeping a
close eye on international securities says let the investor
beware.</p>
<p>"At this point, I would suggest it's premature for
individual investors who aren't sophisticated to develop
significant portfolios in foreign issues that aren't traded
on the New York exchange, the American exchange and Nasdaq,"
says Walter White, Wisconsin's Commissioner of Securities and
head of a group of state securities regulators that monitors
international stocks.</p>
<p>"We're coming out of a period where we have just witnessed
substantial abuses and losses of individuals' money in the
savings and loan scandal," Mr. White notes. "We run the risk
of similar catastrophes if Americans, without firmly
understanding their risks, get involved in overseas
investments."</p>
<p>The first week brought a fast start for the OTC Bulletin
Board, which is meant to shed new light on the murky world of
the low-priced Pink Sheets stocks. More than 100 dealers --
twice the number expected -- used the system in its first
week to advertise prices or interest for about 3,000 U.S. and
foreign securities, says the National Association of
Securities Dealers.</p>
<p>More than two-thirds of price quotes for U.S. stocks were
firm, an "astounding" figure, says John T. Wall, executive
vice president, marketing operations, for the NASD, the
self-regulatory body for the OTC market. In other words,
dealers stood ready to buy 100 shares or sell 100 shares at
their quoted prices. Other dealers just indicated possible
prices or gave phone numbers, much as they do in the Pink
Sheets.</p>
<p>Unlike Nasdaq or exchange-listed stocks, those flashed
upon the Bulletin Board's 2,700 screens needn't meet minimum
standards for size, net worth or financial soundness. And
foreign Pink Sheets companies don't have to meet U.S.
disclosure rules by making periodic, detailed financial
reports to the Securities and Exchange Commission. All they
must provide is the data they supply regulators in their home
countries.</p>
<p>The NASD's competitors aren't thrilled. Kenneth Leibler,
president of the American Stock Exchange, says the Bulletin
Board will give foreign stocks the legitimacy of Nasdaq even
though they don't meet Nasdaq's standards. Not only does this
situation pose risks for small investors, he says, but it's
unfair to the exchanges which, like Nasdaq, can trade only
foreign securities that meet U.S. disclosure rules.</p>
<p>In a compromise proposed by the NASD and accepted by the
SEC, prices of foreign stocks are updated only twice a day,
between 9 and 9:30 a.m. EDT and between 12 and 12:30 p.m.
EDT. The prices aren't firm, only indicated. Traders must
still call one another to get current prices. Even so, the
Amex's Mr. Leibler contends the new system will provide "a
level of stature and visibility that exceeds what should be
allowed for unregistered foreign securities."</p>
<p>On the plus side, the Bulletin Board will make it tougher
for brokers to give investors widely varying quotes for
foreign stocks, says Thomas McIntyre, vice president of the
$30-million Dessauer Asset Management portfolio of
international stocks, Orleans, Mass.</p>
<p>"Anything that makes it easier for investors to track
these things and punch up a quote and feel like it's a
representative quote will be better," he says. "It removes
{the trading of foreign issues} out of the black box category
and puts it onto the screen category."</p>
<p>One of the biggest U.S.-based traders of foreign stocks
agrees. "It helps our client base see the markets," says
Michael Dritz, president and chief executive officer of Smith
New Court, Carl Marks Inc., whose clients include hundreds of
regional and other market makers and large institutions. He
says that in the first week, Smith New Court indicated prices
on the Bulletin Board in about 80 of the 300 foreign issues
it routinely trades. Those included Nestle, Volkswagen,
Deutsche Bank, Britain's Racal Electronics, Hongkong &
Shanghai Banking and Canada's Hemlo Gold Mines.</p>
<p>There are some "bugs" in the system, he says: Many clients
still don't understand that prices aren't up-to-the minute.
The first half-hour of the morning, already busy with the
opening of the U.S. markets, allows scant time to update
prices. But Smith New Court expects to keep adding more
quotes to the system.</p>
<p>Investors still face a battle to determine the soundness
of foreign OTC companies that don't meet U.S. disclosure
rules. The information on file in home countries can be slim.
"There's tremendous resistance in Europe" to higher
disclosure standards, Wisconsin's Mr. White says. He adds
that insider trading and market manipulation are common in
some Asian markets. Differences in foreign accounting
practices, difficulties in currency translations and clearing
costs can add up to more headaches, Mr. White says.</p>
<p>Furthermore, many of the more than 1,700 foreign issues
now listed on the Pink Sheets are obscure and rarely traded.
"If a stock is trading infrequently, you're stuck with it,"
he says. "You certainly won't have the ability to get in and
out at a reasonable price."</p>
<p>Nonetheless, the NASD's Mr. Wall says he's convinced the
OTC Bulletin Board is providing investors in foreign
securities with more, not less, protection. "This market
existed before June 1," he notes. "We're just providing more
information, and we think that provides an additional
regulatory apparatus." At least now the regulators can keep a
closer eye on trading of the securities.</p>
<p>COLORADO REFORMS: Gov. Roy Romer signed a bill Friday
designed to crack down on securities violations in Colorado,
which regulators say has been a haven for penny-stock fraud.
The new legislation requires all offerings to be registered
with the state; establishes licensing requirements for all
broker-dealers and sales agents and beefs up state
enforcement powers. It also requires all funds raised in
"blank check`" offerings to remain in escrow until a business
plan is adopted and the state securities commissioner is
notified. Colorado Securities Commissioner Philip Feigin
said, "A change was necessary to restore investor confidence
in Colorado offerings."</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>Friday's Market Activity</p>
<p>The Nasdaq Composite Index of OTC stocks fell 3.22, or
0.7%, to 460.87.</p>
<p>Declining shares continued to outpace advancers, 1,085 to
758. Volume fell to 137.9 million shares from 151 million
shares Thursday.</p>
<p>Apple Computer fell 3/4 to 38 1/4 and was the day's most
active stock, reflecting two analysts' reports.</p>
<p>Dillon Read & Co.'s John C. Maxwell III lowered his
investment opinion on the computer maker, citing "lackluster
sales" among other things, according to Dow Jones
Professional Investor Report. On Thursday, Needham & Co.
analyst Barbara S. Isgur lowered her fiscal 1990 and 1991
earnings estimates for Apple.</p>
