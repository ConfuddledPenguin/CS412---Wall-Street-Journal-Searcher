	<p class="article-leader">Arizona Public Service Co., the main unit of Pinnacle West
Capital Corp., said it will slash its work force further and
will revamp operations to hold down its rates, which it
conceded are among the highest in the utility industry.
   The proposed belt-tightening moves come in the wake of
Pinnacle West's rejection of both PacifiCorp's $1.82 billion
takeover bid and Salt River Project's $500 million proposal
to buy some of the assets of Phoenix-based Arizona Public
Service.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Pinnacle West suspended its 40-cent-a-share common stock
dividend in October, and announced at its May 23 annual
meeting that it probably won't resume payouts for another
three years.</p>
<p>Arizona Public Service, which has already slashed its work
force to 7,700 employees from 9,100, said that the current
announced cuts would go beyond the 150 previously planned for
1990. A spokesman said the company hasn't determined the
exact number yet. It also is attempting to reduce a 21%,
three-year rate increase it had requested from the Arizona
Corporation Commission beginning in 1991.</p>
<p>"We must reduce our costs to be around in the 1990s," the
spokesman said.</p>
<p>Spokesmen at PacifiCorp and Salt River Project said the
downsizing plans won't affect their bids. A spokesman for
PacifiCorp, a Portland, Ore., utility, said "it's unfortunate
that the company has to take such Draconian moves against
their own employees."</p>
<p>Arizona Public Service said it has hired the Lexington,
Mass., consulting firm of Temple, Barker & Sloan to assist in
the cutbacks.</p>
<p>The Phoenix utility said it has been trying to cut costs
since 1988 through the dismissals, cuts in capital
expenditures and by encouraging out-of-state businesses to
move into its utility territory.</p>
<p>The Arizona Public Service spokesman said the utility has
been "under a multitude of pressures to cut costs."</p>
<p>PacifiCorp, which has made several recent hostile
acquisition bids for Pinnacle West, said that if it took over
the company it would increase utility rates 2% per year for
four years. Arizona Public Service, the state's largest
utility, had proposed annual rate increases of 6.5% between
1991 and 1994.</p>
<p>Salt River Project, Arizona's second largest electric
utility, said in its offer for certain distribution and
transmission facilities in the Phoenix area that it wouldn't
raise rates in the acquired areas for five to seven years
until those rates are equal to the lower Salt River rates. In
the past two weeks, a Phoenix councilman has proposed that
the city study the possibility of seizing some Arizona Public
Service utility territory and giving the business to someone
else, possibly Salt River Project, which serves areas
surrounding Phoenix.</p>
<p>In New York Stock Exchange composite trading, Pinnacle
shares closed Friday at $15.875, off 25 cents.</p>
