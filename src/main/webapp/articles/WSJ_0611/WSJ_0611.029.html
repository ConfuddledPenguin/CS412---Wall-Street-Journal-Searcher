	<p class="article-leader">PARIS -- New York law firm Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher &
Flom announced plans for an association with Bredin, Prat,
Saint-Esteben, Grandjean & Morabia, a corporate-law
specialist here.
   The two law firms said they don't plan to merge. But
because they don't have offices in each other's home cities,
they will refer business to each other and cooperate closely.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Bredin Prat of Paris also said that as soon as statutory
changes here permit -- probably in September of 1991 -- it
will merge with a new U.S.-led group of lawyers in Paris,
creating one of this city's first Franco-American firms.</p>
<p>The U.S. lawyers, formerly with the Paris office of the
U.S. firm Coudert Brothers, will begin using Bredin Prat's
offices and working closely with the French firm as of July
1. Until the merger, they will remain a legally separate
entity, to be called Schepard, Baxter & Associes.</p>
<p>Two months ago, two other Paris-based firms, one U.S.-led
and the other French, announced merger plans, creating what
would be one of Paris's largest firms. S.G. Archibald, one of
the country's oldest non-French firms, and Courtois Bouloy
Lebel & Associes, a large French firm, said they will merge
once the law permits. They too will work closely together
while they wait.</p>
