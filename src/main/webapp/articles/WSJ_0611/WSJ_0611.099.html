	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- For the first time in memory, producer and
consumer price reports hit back-to-back in the same week. Not
for the first time, both inflation gauges are expected to
rise in the same month.
   Normally, wholesale prices precede the important CPI by
about a week, giving economists time to adjust their main
inflation forecasts. "They're going to get no chance at all
to revise" this time, said Patrick Jackman, chief of the CPI
branch of the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The May CPI, due
Friday, comes right on the heels of Thursday's PPI report.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The week's other indicators take the latest pulse of an
economy that has recently been slowing. They include: May
retail sales, industrial production and capacity utilization,
as well as April's trade deficit and business inventories.</p>
<p>But the inflation data are likely to steal the statistical
show because already-disclosed reports have set the tone for
most of the other numbers. Economists expect an uptick in
producer prices after two months of declines. The consensus
view calls for a 0.2% increase, according to MMS
International, a unit of McGraw-Hill Inc. Consumer prices are
thought to have again increased, with the consensus also
expecting a 0.3% rise. In April, the CPI rose 0.2% and in
March it jumped 0.5%.</p>
<p>The CPI trackers have been working for some time to shave
days off the release date of the index. Traditionally, the
CPI takes longer to gather since its market basket is
compiled throughout the month. The PPI reflects one sample
day. Economists noted that eclipsing the time between reports
(bureau rules prohibit sameday disclosure) could heighten
analysts' anxiety on months the gauges move in different
directions. Such discrepancies aren't that uncommon, largely
because the CPI is heavily weighted toward services, while
the PPI doesn't measure services at all.</p>
<p>Richard Trainer, senior economist at Bank of Tokyo in New
York, is in the camp that expects both inflation gauges to
rise a bit in May. But he's expecting only a 0.1% increase in
May producer prices, largely because of the past behavior of
prices for basics like feeds, foodstuffs and natural gas. "I
think we'll see some increase in some food and energy prices
at the consumer level, too," Mr. Trainer said. He expects
about a 0.2% rise in the CPI.</p>
<p>He and some others expect cooler inflation over time.
"We're coming off some very, very high inflation numbers that
were driven by special factors late last year," he said.
Among the quirks, he cited unusually cold weather and a sharp
runup in apparel costs. Mr. Trainer noted that the recent
economic sluggishness indicates "we're going to see some
relief in demand pressure on prices. Then we'll actually see
some dust settling down." But he added: "It takes a while,
perhaps {until} late summer or early fall. But then we're
back into the winter season."</p>
<p>Mickey D. Levy, chief economist at First Fidelity Bancorp.
in Philadelphia, believes that a flattening trend in money
supply portends cooler inflation down the road. A
decelerating money supply would be "very significant" to
produce the slow-growth scenario necessary to sustain his
lower-inflation forecast.</p>
<p>Mr. Levy has one of the most optimistic inflation outlooks
for the rest of 1990 and for 1991. "By the end of 1991, we'll
be in the 3.25% range, maybe a little lower," he said.</p>
<p>The consensus view on retail sales, due Wednesday, expects
a 0.1% rise, following April's 0.6% drop. Sluggish auto sales
are expected to again act as a drag on the overall number.
Economists are particularly interested in any gains in
apparel sales to determine if discounting drove up volume or
whether prices held.</p>
<p>Industrial output and capacity utilization, due Friday,
are expected to rebound slightly. The consensus view calls
for output to rise 0.4%, which would put the operating rate
around 83.2%. In April, industrial production slipped 0.4%
and capacity utilization was 83%.</p>
<p>Economists continue to expect slow improvement in the
trade deficit. April's deficit report, due Friday, is
expected to narrow to $7.5 billion, following March's
widening to $8.4 billion.</p>
