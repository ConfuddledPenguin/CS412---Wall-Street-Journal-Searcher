	<p class="article-leader">Texas Instruments Inc. said it will reduce its defense
systems work force by about 1,000 employees over the next
year in response to reduced defense spending.
   The Dallas-based semiconductor and defense concern said
that all its Defense Systems and Electronics Group sites,
which employ about 22,000 people, will be affected by the
decision.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Texas Instruments said it expects the overall financial
impact from the reductions to be minimal.</p>
<p>The company also announced it agreed with a unit of the
Netherlands' N.V. Philips to swap designs for a group of
computer chips called bus-interface logics.</p>
<p>Under the agreement, Texas Instruments and Philips
Components-Signetics will make and sell each other's
bus-interface chips, which act as go-betweens in computers,
allowing chips to communicate with each other and to outside
equipment such as telephone lines.</p>
<p>Texas Instruments estimates the world market for
bus-interface chips at about $850 million.</p>
