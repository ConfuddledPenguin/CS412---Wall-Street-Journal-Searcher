	<p class="article-leader">Every business manager I know shares one frustration: the
difficulty obtaining fast, accurate and comprehensive market
information. Whether selling mouthwash, disk drives or, in
our case, snack foods, a manager needs to know whether a
product is giving the competition fits, or if it's a clinker.
And you need to know quickly, or the competition will kill
you.
   Until recently, Frito-Lay had a centralized
decision-making structure common to many corporations.
Product information crept upward through the organization on
what I thought was a timely basis. I soon discovered it
wasn't timely enough.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>It did not, for example, provide Frito-Lay enough time to
respond quickly to its rapidly changing and complex markets
or to fine-tune its inventory. It also did not allow us to
shorten our business cycle enough to stay ahead of the
competition. And it did not allow me, the CEO, to have the
latest sales and profit information on the 14 million snacks
sold weekly through our 400,000 sales calls.</p>
<p>So we changed -- radically.</p>
<p>The catalyst was our Decision Support System, brought on
line last year. DSS kicks back to 200 managers detailed sales
and inventory information fed into it by 10,000 route
salespeople equipped with hand-held computers.</p>
<p>For example, one of our sales people who handles more than
50 stores for us in New Jersey no longer spends hours writing
orders, invoices and sales reports. With his palm-sized
computer, he now completes his "paper work" in a minute or
two at each stop, running through a programmed product list
complete with prices. At the end of each day, his sales
report is transmitted in seconds to headquarters in Dallas.
Even conservatively, if we estimate that our route
salespeople save just three hours a week, that's 30,000 hours
a week for the entire sales force, and untold savings in
clerical, postage and forms costs.</p>
<p>Here's how the system serves us:</p>
<p>-- Helps in tracking new products. In this area, DSS is
invaluable. This spring, for example, Frito-Lay launched its
new "Light" line of snack foods. DSS allows me to see if this
new line is cannibalizing other Frito-Lay brands -- and I get
the information in a matter of days, not weeks as was
previously the case. I also have easy access to data showing
our performance vs. competitive brands'. For Ruffles Light
Potato Chips, I can determine: total sales from the previous
week; supermarket sales vs. smaller accounts; average sales
on a particular route; and the success of our promotions.
Most important, the data allow me to make mid-course
corrections to ensure the success of the Light line.</p>
<p>-- Facilitates faster, more accurate decisions. Recently,
I noticed red numbers (indicating reduced market share) for
tortilla chips in our central business region. I punched up
another screen display and located the problem: Texas. I kept
punching up new screens and tracked the red numbers to a
specific sales division and, finally, the chain of stores.
The numbers pinpointed the problem area and, after additional
research, revealed the culprit: the introduction of a generic
store-branded product. We quickly formulated a
counter-strategy and sales climbed again. Time invested: a
couple of weeks. Before DSS, finding such a problem and
correcting it took the better part of three months.</p>
<p>Through information technology, even cardboard cartons
used to transport our products become a business opportunity.
Last year, 88% of all cartons shipped to our distribution
centers were returned by our sales force for re-use. If we
push the percentage up a single point, it saves Frito-Lay
$700,000. So, through DSS, we are now tracking cardboard
returns by individual sales route, and by store, and hope to
push returns above 90%.</p>
<p>-- Assists in "management by walking around." When Tom
Peters coined that phrase he wasn't thinking of a computer
tour of operations by the CEO. But that is what DSS allows me
and other senior executives to do. I can, at a glance, view
the performance of each of our managers and salespeople
around the country. If I see something I don't like, I can
fire off an electronic-mail memo. Conversely, if there is
good news, I'm likely to contact the manager and congratulate
him.</p>
<p>-- Helps us to decentralize. I never thought a computer
would be responsible for a total reorganization of Frito-Lay,
but it has been. Last year we decentralized, breaking the
company into four geographic business areas, each with its
own business plan, structure and profit-and-loss
responsibility. We did so because DSS, and the detailed
information it provides, allows middle managers to have a
complete picture of what is happening in their regions. Now
approximately 60% of the decisions that used to be made by
top management are made by regional managers, leaving the
decisions affecting the company as a whole at corporate
headquarters.</p>
<p>As a result, top management can see within a few days
which products are hot and which are not, enabling it to
devise its strategy on the spot. But most important, DSS
gives us the information we need -- not what someone wants to
give us after it has been massaged and sanitized. And we get
it when we want it, which is usually immediately. While DSS
currently operates through 200 terminals, it will reach 600
managers before fall, many of them via satellite
transmission.</p>
<p>A note of caution, however: When incorporating an
information technology system, do so step-by-step. Computers
as a strategic marketing tool may still be unfamiliar to
lower and middle management, and may require a breaking-in
period. Let your people feel the impact of the system, so
that as additional programs are incorporated, the process
will seem evolutionary. The results will be revolutionary.</p>
