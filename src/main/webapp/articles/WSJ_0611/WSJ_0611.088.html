	<p class="article-leader">It all seems modest enough: Goemon Inc., Boston, owns but
a single restaurant, a Cambridge, Mass., Japanese-style
noodle shop that opened last year. Because of high start-up
costs, the restaurant isn't even showing a profit yet.
   All the same, Goemon is preparing a franchising program.
It aims to have its first franchisee up and running,
somewhere between Boston and Chicago, later this year and
five to 10 more next year. Its majority owner, Yashuhide
Sunamura, already owns more than a dozen successful noodle
shops in Japan. Moreover, the company-owned test unit in
Cambridge "is doing extremely well, better than we had
anticipated," said Eleanor Arpino, vice president of Goemon.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Goemon is one of many foreign firms increasingly making
inroads in this country through franchising techniques that
American companies largely pioneered. The moves come as
American franchisers are pressing into new foreign markets,
lately including Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>The foreigners think they have innovative businesses that
will stand out even in the crowded American franchising
market.</p>
<p>Roche-Bobois U.S.A. Ltd., New York, a pioneer among
foreign-controlled franchisers in the U.S., began operating
in this country in 1974 and has 24 U.S. franchisees, which
sell leather seating pieces and other luxurious furniture of
French design. Michael Lerner, executive vice president, said
the concern brings in a high-income clientele "that's
difficult to duplicate." Besides, becoming a franchisee is
the only way that any American store can sell the name-brand
furniture line.</p>
<p>Sometimes, foreign franchisers are entering the American
market by acquiring existing franchising operations. But the
foreigners also are gingerly nursing new U.S. franchising
businesses. In either case, it's foreign-based franchising on
a scale experts say they haven't seen before.</p>
<p>"We are seeing foreign companies catch on to the
advantages of franchising in ever-increasing numbers," said
Patrick J. Boroian, president of Francorp Inc., an Olympia
Fields, Ill., franchise-development and consulting firm. The
foreigners most interested in the U.S., he said, are from
countries, such as Canada and Japan, where American
franchisers have had notable success, providing inspiration.</p>
<p>For example, Ceiling Doctor International Inc., based in
Toronto, has sold 16 ceiling and wall-cleaning franchises in
the U.S. since 1987. Moneysworth & Best Shoe Repair Inc.,
also of Toronto, last year opened its first U.S. shoe-repair
outlet, in Washington, D.C., which it subsequently sold to a
franchisee. Meanwhile, the company sold 17 more U.S.
franchises.</p>
<p>Keith J. Kanouse, a West Palm Beach, Fla., lawyer and
franchising consultant, said foreign interest in U.S.
franchising "gets larger each year." Mr. Kanouse said he
attended the National Restaurant Association convention in
Chicago last month and encountered about 20 small companies,
largely from the Far East and Latin America, all considering
franchising their restaurant concepts in this country.</p>
<p>Until recently, most American franchisers have been nearly
free from direct foreign competition. But now "reverse
franchising," as the spread of foreign franchising into the
U.S. is called, could mean new pressures and problems for
many U.S. businesses, including franchises. Foreigners
offering franchises are often competing for the same
investors as American franchises. They and their franchisees
are also competing for the same spaces in malls and the same
consumer dollars.</p>
<p>Like their American counterparts, foreigners who turn to
franchising aim to attract managers and capital faster than
they could do so through strictly company-owned operations.
Typically, franchisees finance their outlets, while paying
fees and royalties to the franchisers.</p>
<p>But reverse franchising often proves more costly and
difficult than franchisers expected, and thus may be
well-suited only to large, wealthy franchisers. John L.
Scott, president of Fastframe USA Inc., an Agoura, Calif.,
franchiser controlled by British shareholders, advises
prospective franchisers from overseas: "Whatever you think
it's going to cost you to get started, quadruple it." Federal
and state regulatory demands on franchisers are enormous in
the U.S. compared with those in many European countries, he
said.</p>
<p>David J. Kaufmann, a lawyer in New York, said foreigners
seeking to franchise nationally are often shocked to learn
that 16 separate regulatory filings are required, one with
the Federal Trade Commission and one each for 15 states with
their own franchise registration laws. Moreover, the
foreigners are unaccustomed to the level of disclosure in
each document.</p>
<p>Franchisers accustomed to Europe are also taken aback by
U.S. demographic patterns, Fastframe's Mr. Scott said. In
British towns, for example, well-heeled consumers can be
counted on to shop in downtown areas alongside poorer
customers, Mr. Scott said. In U.S. cities, by contrast, a
downtown location "could be the death knell for your
business," he added.</p>
<p>Despite the difficulties, Fastframe has opened 89 U.S.
franchises, offering custom framing and related services,
since 1987. Potential rewards outweigh costs, Mr. Scott said,
because "the U.S. has five to six times the market potential
of the U.K."</p>
<p>Still, the start-up costs are expected to deter many
foreign companies from attempting to franchise in this
country. Philip F. Zeidman, a lawyer in Washington, D.C.,
said: "Not a lot of small companies are going to be willing
to try this. It's the larger franchisers that are going to be
interested." Mr. Zeidman predicts that more foreign
franchisers will enter the U.S. through giant acquisitions,
rather than starting up their own operations.</p>
<p>In the absence of acquisitions, building a franchise chain
can be slow. Thousands of franchisers are competing for U.S.
investors. "The main problem is coming up with qualified
people," said Roche-Bobois's Mr. Lerner. Roche-Bobois still
lacks franchisees in such large cities as Pittsburgh, St.
Louis, New Orleans and Atlanta.</p>
<p>Others, though, see no such shortage. Buth-Na-Bodhaige
Inc., a Cedar Knolls, N.J., unit of Body Shop International
PLC of Britain, began franchising Body Shop outlets, which
sell toiletries and cosmetics, in the U.S. this year. In
addition to 17 company-owned Body Shop outlets in this
country, there are four franchises. Ranjit Singh, franchise
director, said there's no lack of prospective franchisees.
"When we last counted, we had over 5,000 letters of interest
on file," he said.</p>
