	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- In what could be the final round of
bilateral negotiations between the U.S. and Japan on
trade-related "structural" economic issues in Tokyo late this
month, U.S. officials are hoping that Japanese policy makers
won't openly advocate a new doctrine that Japan's huge
current-account and trade surpluses are desirable in
maintaining world economic stability.
   For their part, Japanese officials are apprehensive over
the amount of pressure U.S. officials might exert in the June
25-26 negotiations for more specific commitments on future
actions to open up Japanese markets for more imports and
private foreign investments.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>In advance of these talks, Japanese officials are
indicating that they aren't planning to make any new
concessions to the U.S., such as making advance commitments
on the amount of planned public works spending in Japan as a
percentage of the country's gross national product.</p>
<p>Japanese officials also are less than enthusiastic about
another U.S. proposal that negotiations on structural trade
issues be "institutionalized" in the form of continuing
consultations several times a year, to rehash old issues and
discuss new ones.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the new economic "theology" about the merits of
continued Japanese international trade surpluses, put forward
by some Japanese "think-tank" experts, is viewed as a
potentially troublesome issue, particularly if the Japanese
government were to openly endorse such a strategy.</p>
<p>Thus far, U.S. reaction has been low-keyed, but several
top U.S. economic policy makers have said this idea lacks
merit.</p>
<p>As things stand, the U.S. and Japan are slated to produce
in mid-July the final versions of their reports on policy
actions, both in Tokyo and Washington, to achieve a better
balance in trade on a longer-term basis.</p>
<p>In interim reports issued in April, both governments
managed to ease some of the tensions in their bilateral trade
relations. Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu and President Bush,
who are expected to get together early next month in Houston,
ahead of the economic summit, probably will be looking for
ways to keep things on a smooth track.</p>
<p>Delays in Congress: General Motors Corp. and other
companies are signing some long-term agreements to supply
equipment and technology to the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>But they may have to wait until September or even longer
to know whether Congress will approve a bilateral trade
agreement to reduce U.S. tariffs on Soviet goods and, perhaps
more important, clear the way for the Export-Import Bank to
help finance exports of goods and services the Russians want
to buy.</p>
<p>Separately, it also may take several months for U.S.
companies doing business with China to know, for sure, that
the U.S. will continue its "most-favored-nation" treatment
for imports of Chinese-made goods.</p>
<p>The House Ways and Means international trade subcommittee,
headed by Rep. Sam Gibbons (D., Fla.) will begin hearings
June 19 on various bills designed to overturn President
Bush's decision to extend for one-year most-favored-nation
treatment for Chinese products, which means lower U.S. import
duties.</p>
<p>Mr. Gibbons is promising other members of Congress, irked
over the White House decision on China, a comprehensive set
of hearings that will explore, among other things, Chinese
government policies and the impact of trade and investment
ties on the U.S., China and Hong Kong.</p>
<p>Technically, Congress must decide no later than Sept. 3
whether to uphold (through inaction) or disapprove (through
legislative action) the White House China trade decision of
May 24.</p>
<p>But some House members are proposing entirely new
legislation that would change the ground rules and set new
conditions for any future extensions of the U.S. tariff
concessions on imports of apparel, footwear, toys, machinery
or other products from China.</p>
<p>On the Soviet Union, U.S. trade-policy officials were
saying recently they couldn't predict how soon President Bush
would formally transmit the bilateral trade agreement with
that country to Congress, coupling this with approval of
"waivers" under a 1974 Trade act to lower U.S. import duties
on Soviet exports.</p>
<p>They suggested it won't happen soon because Moscow may
take several months to enact a law allowing unrestricted
emigration of Soviet residents to other countries.</p>
<p>How Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev resolves Moscow's
problems with the breakaway Baltic states also will be an
important factor in this situation, according to
congressional leaders who discussed this issue with President
Bush at the White House recently.</p>
<p>Credits To Finance Trade: Although the Soviet Union now is
appealing openly for credits from Western nations, including
the U.S., Moscow hasn't gotten around yet to applying for
membership in the International Monetary Fund or the World
Bank, both of which are pumping out funds to other Eastern
and Central European countries to support economic reforms.</p>
<p>Last week, for example, the World Bank approved a $250
million loan to Poland to help expand natural-gas production
in that country. The bank also has assigned experts to help
Poland work out contractual arrangements to attract foreign
participation in the country's oil industry.</p>
<p>While some Russian officials apparently are claiming that
they have sought informal, unofficial advice from the IMF
about currency-related issues, IMF officials say that hasn't
happened.</p>
<p>In the bilateral trade agreement negotiated between the
U.S. and the Soviet Union, it was agreed that commercial
transactions between these two countries would have to be
settled in freely convertible currencies.</p>
<p>In a separate "side-letter" agreement that could create
new drains on Moscow's limited holdings of dollars, the
Russians promised to begin discussions with the U.S. on
repaying about $714 million in old U.S. government loans,
after the main U.S.-Soviet trade agreement takes effect.</p>
<p>U.S. officials said these old debts include $674 million
in World War II lend-lease accounts, plus $44 million the
Soviet Union still owes to the Export-Import Bank on loans
approved many years ago.</p>
