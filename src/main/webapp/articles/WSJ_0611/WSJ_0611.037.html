	<h3>Panel Rules Most Waste Cleanup Costs Must Be Taken as One-Time Expenses</h3>

	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Companies will have to use a one-time
accounting method, as opposed to spreading the costs over
time -- to cover most expenses for treating environmental
contamination on their property, according to an accounting
panel's decision.
   An exception is the cost of treating asbestos. However,
the panel ruled that for most other cleanup costs, companies
must use so-called expensing, rather than longer-term
capitalizing, which can offer some immediate advantages to
the bottom line.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Many companies had been watching for a decision on the
environmental accounting issue, reached recently by the
Emerging Issues Task Force of the Financial Accounting
Standards Board. The FASB, located in Norwalk, Conn., is the
chief rulemaking body for accountants.</p>
<p>The task force addresses narrower issues than the FASB,
but its decisions are applicable to any company following
generally accepted accounting principles.</p>
<p>Questions about whether companies could capitalize
environmental treatment costs arose after the task force
agreed last October that a company's costs to handle asbestos
problems may be capitalized if the treatment increases the
realizable value of the property.</p>
<p>"The asbestos conclusion was the springboard of the whole
issue," says Gregory Jonas, a partner in accounting
principles at Arthur Andersen & Co., which brought the latest
issue before the task force.</p>
<p>Capitalizing a cost on the books gives a company the
advantage of spreading the cost over a longer period, thus
enhancing the bottom line in the near term. Expensing a cost
is a one-time event. In the past, there was a diversity among
companies about whether to expense or to capitalize these
costs, says George Schleier of the FASB staff. The decision
doesn't address tax issues.</p>
<p>"Basically, what the consensus does is it makes it very
difficult to capitalize the cleanup costs other than in a
purchase transaction where you buy property and improve it"
or in removal of asbestos, says Don Nicolaisen, national
director of accounting services at Price Waterhouse, and a
task force member. Costs of improvements, such as installing
pollution-control equipment, that prevent future
contamination also may be capitalized.</p>
<p>But Mr. Nicolaisen and others on the task force say that
although companies were given greater discretion to
capitalize costs relating to asbestos cleanup than other
environmental contamination, the distinction between the two
isn't all that clear cut.</p>
<p>"The essential distinction is between something that
arises in use, as opposed to something that existed when it
was built or at the time of purchase," says Bernard Doyle, a
consultant in corporate accounting at General Electric Co.,
who also sits on the task force. "It's not a perfect
solution, but it seemed to be a reasonable distinction to
make," Mr. Doyle says, noting that asbestos was put in most
buildings as an improvement, whereas much other environmental
contamination is a by-product of industrial processes.</p>
<p>The environmental consensus "provides a framework for
companies to support a decision to capitalize," says John
Gribble, a member of the FASB staff. Mr. Gribble cites the
example of a company cleaning up a toxic waste dump on its
property. In the past, a company might have argued for
capitalizing the cost because cleaning it up improves it. But
under the consensus on issue 90-8, "all you've done is
restore the land to its original state," so the cost should
be expensed, he says.</p>
<p>Mr. Gribble notes that "asbestos is a strange bird because
of its dangerous nature." He distinguishes it from other
contaminants by saying that its "mere existence could be
considered to mean a building is unsafe."</p>
<p>Others aren't so sure about the distinction. "I have a
hard time believing it (asbestos) is any more dangerous than
any of the other things that are out there," such as toxic
waste, says Robert F. Richter, a partner in the national
accounting and auditing department at Laventhol & Horwath.
"There is a difference, but I don't think it goes as far as
they have stretched it," says Jay C. Agarwal, vice president,
technology assessment, at Charles River Associates, a
consulting firm. Mr. Agarwal says the difference is between
accumulated danger and continued danger. Some argue that
leaving asbestos in place doesn't create as much of a hazard
as disturbing it when it is removed.</p>
<p>The accounting decision doesn't address when to recognize
liabilities related to environmental contamination or how to
measure them, "a bigger problem by far," says Edward Murphy,
director of finance, accounting and statistics at the
American Petroleum Institute in Washington, D.C. Companies
are attempting to assess their liability, but "it's a
horrendous task," Mr. Murphy says.</p>
<p>General guidance on when to record a liability for
cleaning up these problems is given in the FASB's statement
five. That says the latest you can record a liability for
something like an oil spill is "when you write the check and
the earliest is when you find out about it," says Mr. Jonas
of Arthur Andersen. Liabilities should be recorded as soon as
a company is reasonably certain one exists and that it's
reasonably quantifiable, says Mr. Murphy. But, says Mr.
Nicolaisen of Price Waterhouse, the whole issue of measuring
the liability "is still an evolving process."</p>
