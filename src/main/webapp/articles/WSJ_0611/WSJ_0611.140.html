	<p class="article-leader">The recent acquisitions of Rockefeller Center and Columbia
Pictures have caused some worry that foreign investors are
buying the soul of America. While such transactions are
highly visible, the actual causes and effects of foreign
investment are much harder to discern. This task is made more
difficult still by the surfeit of books and articles about
foreign investment in the U.S., most of which rely heavily on
anecdotal evidence. In my view, much of this literature has
sacrificed credibility in favor of alarmist tones and
superficial analysis.
   The notable exception is "Foreign Direct Investment in the
United States" (147 pages, $11.95) by Edward M. Graham of
Duke's Fuqua School of Business and Paul R. Krugman of MIT's
Department of Economics. Published by the Institute for
International Economics in Washington, D.C., it offers an
excellent analytical treatment of the many issues raised by
foreign direct investment (FDI). It also is accessible to
laymen, a rare occurrence in the literature of economics, and
it should lay to rest much of the irresponsible rhetoric
about FDI heard inside the Capitol Beltway.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The focus of the debate on foreign investment in the U.S.
has been on FDI, which, unlike portfolio investment, gives
foreign investors the ability to control specific assets. The
Commerce Department, which collects data on foreign
investment, classifies an interest as FDI when the investor
holds at least a 10% equity interest in U.S. business or real
estate.</p>
<p>Messrs. Graham and Krugman dispel the most popular
explanation for the rise in FDI -- that it is a result of the
growth of the trade deficit -- by demonstrating that the
growth in FDI began back in the early 1970s, when the U.S.
frequently enjoyed trade surpluses and FDI surged between
1977 and 1981, tailing off before the rise of the huge
deficits. Nor is the claim that the growth of FDI is spurred
by lower foreign interest rates convincing. Even assuming
that foreign interest rates were lower, this would not
explain the heavy reliance on local financing. Messrs. Graham
and Krugman also reject the old saw that foreigners are
buying America on the cheap. Although the falling U.S. dollar
makes U.S. companies less expensive in foreign currencies, it
also makes their profit stream less valuable.</p>
<p>In the authors' view, the best explanation for the growth
of FDI is the standard economist's explanation, that it
allows foreign multinationals to produce goods locally when
they have an advantage in technology or management skills
over their domestic competitors.</p>
<p>This explanation accords with the change in the world
economic system after World War II. Instead of being the
pre-eminent economic power, the U.S. now is the leading
economic power among such peers as West Germany, Japan, the
United Kingdom and France. U.S. multinationals no longer have
a monopoly on the best technology and management. As a
consequence of the maturation of the economies of other
nations, FDI in the U.S. is approaching the levels existing
in other industrial economies, although inward direct
investment still has a long way to go to reach the level of
FDI common in other industrialized countries.</p>
<p>Many of the critics' arguments about the dangers of FDI
fare no better than their explanations for its growth. Claims
that FDI costs America jobs, transfers good jobs overseas,
reduces local research and development and worsens the trade
deficit all are systematically refuted by the evidence. On
other arguments, that FDI increases imports or that foreign
firms have bought high-tech U.S. firms and transferred their
technology abroad leaving hollowed-out shell corporations,
the authors point to a dearth of hard evidence either way. In
sum, no case has been made that FDI presents a danger to the
U.S. economy.</p>
<p>The authors successfully debunk the myths circulated by
the critics of foreign investment. Their research is careful,
their writing clear, and their analysis incisive. What their
book lacks, however, is a slick cover, a catchy title, and
self-serving quotations from politicians and representatives
of special interests. Without sensationalist innuendoes about
takeovers and a doomsday message, this serious and important
study is likely to be swamped by its more flashily marketed
competition.</p>
<p>Curiously, this seems to be true even in Japan, where
Japan-bashing books enjoy surprising popularity. The Japanese
have a great thirst for information about the U.S., their
largest and most important trading partner. Japan-bashing
books are readily available in a number of Tokyo bookstores,
and their authors lecture in Japan for hefty fees. But on a
recent trip to Tokyo I was unable to find a single copy of
the Graham/Krugman book. It is ironic that the Japanese are
doing so much to encourage their critics, while neglecting
the more balanced work of serious scholars.</p>
