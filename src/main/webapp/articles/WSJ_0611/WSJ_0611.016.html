	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- Savings-and-loan bailout officials are
racing to fashion a new policy to sell off real estate in
blocks so big they'd make Donald Trump a piker by comparison.
   The idea -- which has tremendous political momentum --
could put scores of $500 million packages of real estate on
the market over the next few years.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Burdened with a stockpile of properties that will grow by
tens of billions of dollars this quarter alone, officials
overseeing the thrift-industry bailout hope so-called bulk
sales will speed the real estate into the private sector,
where the properties can be managed more efficiently.
Political concerns are at work as well. Congress has been
lambasting the bailout agencies for moving too slowly, and
the bailout's drain on the federal budget has prompted
increased pressure from the Bush administration to raise cash
by selling the properties seized from insolvent thrifts.</p>
<p>"If it works," said an enthusiastic William Seidman,
chairman of both the Resolution Trust Corp. and the Federal
Deposit Insurance Corp., "we'll be selling the stuff in
half-billion-dollar chunks." In many cases, the government
would provide most of the financing and take a share of the
profits if the properties do well.</p>
<p>But some outside the RTC say bulk sales are a disastrous
idea that could increase the already astonishing cost to
taxpayers by slashing the government's long-term return from
the properties. The real estate would have to be sold at huge
discounts, critics say, because the pool of buyers for $500
million chunks would be so small.</p>
<p>Bulk sales "are a bad idea that should be nipped in the
bud," said William Isaac, Mr. Seidman's predecessor as FDIC
chairman, now head of a bank consulting firm, Secura Group.
"The process should be as competitive as possible. This will
just give the mega-investor a sweetheart deal."</p>
<p>Even supporters of the sales argue the risks for the
government are big. For instance, buyers wary of bad assets
may demand provisions -- known as asset puts -- to return
their merchandise to the government for a year. "If you're
selling with lots of unknowns, there's going to be a low
purchase price. And then if buyers can put back the worst
assets, the government may have wound up selling the best
assets at a very low price," said John Aldridge, an Atlanta
attorney who specializes in straightening out bad real estate
loans.</p>
<p>Another concern is that "the price of this action may be a
heavy effect on real estate values," said Norman Katz, a bank
consultant with Grant Thornton. But many officials now
believe the uncertainty created by the RTC's surplus of real
estate is creating a bigger problem in the markets than quick
sales would.</p>
<p>Not all of the RTC's inventory will be sold in bulk. Good
assets such as profitable hotels or other commercial property
will probably be sold individually -- many at a televised
auction this fall -- in order to draw many bidders. "By
blending strategies we can maximize the return," said Diane
Casey, spokeswoman for the RTC Oversight Board, which sets
policy for the RTC.</p>
<p>But fear of the alternative to bulk sales -- letting
bureaucrats manage and sell all the assets one by one -- is
driving the policy, which will be considered by the RTC's
board in the next few weeks. Said Mr. Seidman: "We know the
longer the government holds these assets, the more the value
tends to decrease."</p>
<p>Also driving the policy is the reluctance of buyers of the
RTC's broke thrifts to take on their loans and other assets.
In all but a handful of the 150 thrifts the RTC has sold or
liquidated, buyers have wanted only deposits, branches and a
few easily sold assets such as securities.</p>
<p>Thus the RTC's rotten and not-so-rotten real estate empire
grows bigger and bigger. At the end of March, the RTC held
$7.7 billion in real estate. By the end of this month -- if
the RTC completes its ambitious plan to sell 141 thrifts in
the quarter -- the total is likely to be $40 billion.</p>
<p>Bulk sale blocks might include healthy home loans, ailing
commercial real estate loans, or a mix of elements, said
Joseph Robert, president of J.E. Robert Co., a real estate
management firm. Mr. Robert, who has been consulting with the
RTC on the design of the deals, described a hypothetical sale
of a block of assets with an estimated value of $500 million.</p>
<p>The buyer would make a 15% down payment and demand, say, a
20% discount for buying in bulk -- bringing the price to $400
million. Once properties were sold, the buyer would receive
all proceeds to as much as $400 million. Above that level,
the government would take 70% of the proceeds, and the buyer
would get 30%. Above $500 million -- the original estimated
value -- the positions might switch, with the buyer receiving
70%. "It creates an enormous incentive for all parties to
maximize the return," Mr. Robert said.</p>
<p>Firms like Mr. Robert's would manage and prepare the
properties to be sold. Likely investors might include large
institutions such as pension funds or insurance companies.
Interests in the pools of properties also could be sold as
securities.</p>
