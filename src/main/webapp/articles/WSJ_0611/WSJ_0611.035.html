	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Perkin-Elmer Corp.'s onetime chairman and
chief executive, Chester W. Nimitz Jr., said he proposed that
shareholders ask management to put the company up for sale.
   Mr. Nimitz submitted the proposal for consideration at the
company's annual meeting in November. "The essence of the
proposal is that they put the company up for sale, and sell
it in a manner most advantageous to shareholders," Mr. Nimitz
said.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Based on Friday's closing price of $24.50 a share on the
New York Stock Exchange, the company would have an indicated
value of more than $800 million. Perkin-Elmer, Norwalk,
Conn., is an analytical instruments and material-sciences
concern.</p>
<p>The 75-year-old Mr. Nimitz, a retired rear admiral, was a
Perkin-Elmer executive for about 15 years; he left the chief
executive post in 1977 and the chairmanship in 1980. He is
the son of Adm. Chester W. Nimitz, the commander of the U.S.
Pacific fleet during World War II.</p>
<p>In a telephone interview, Mr. Nimitz, who owns 1,000
shares of Perkin-Elmer's 33 million shares outstanding, said
he took issue with the company's recent buy-back of 10.1
million common shares at $24.50 each. The company used part
of the proceeds from the sale of several of its businesses to
buy back the stock. Mr. Nimitz said "the poor suffering
long-term shareholder should have gotten the $240 million,"
or at least had a say in how the money was spent. The company
has never announced how much it received from sales of the
businesses.</p>
<p>A Perkin-Elmer spokesman confirmed that the company
received a letter from Mr. Nimitz, and said "his views will
be carefully considered by our board."</p>
<p>Perkin-Elmer announced a restructuring program in April
1989 to sell three businesses: semiconductor equipment,
German avionics and government systems. At the time the
company said it would consider using proceeds of the sales to
pay dividends to shareholders, but so far hasn't done that.
For the year ended July 31, 1989, Perkin-Elmer had a net loss
of $24.2 million on revenue of $784.3 million.</p>
<p>In May, Perkin-Elmer sold its semiconductor-equipment
business to a group of computer companies, but retained a
stake of less than 20%. The sale had been the focus of some
concern because a Japanese company was reported to have
expressed interest in part of the business. Mr. Nimitz said,
however, that he understood Perkin-Elmer had been in
licensing talks with the Japanese concern. Concerns had been
raised by U.S. semiconductor companies fearing inroads in to
the business by the Japanese.</p>
<p>Mr. Nimitz said that in comparison with the Standard &
Poor's 500-stock index from 1984 to 1989, Perkin-Elmer's
stock "has gone nowhere." In the statement supporting his
proposal, Mr. Nimitz said the dividends "don't even approach
the inflation rate." Perkin-Elmer's quarterly dividend is 17
cents a share.</p>
<p>The statement says that although the downsized company may
grow modestly, "going forward offers no suitable return" to
the long-term holder who is "already so far behind on his or
her investment."</p>
<p>Mr. Nimitz, who also sent a letter to Perkin-Elmer
chairman Horace G. McDonell, said he doesn't want to start a
proxy fight, and that he would withdraw the proposal if the
company puts itself up for sale. He said he would begin
contacting major institutional holders soon to seek support.</p>
