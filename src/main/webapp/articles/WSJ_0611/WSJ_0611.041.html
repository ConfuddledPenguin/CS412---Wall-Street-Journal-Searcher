	<p class="article-leader">SYDNEY, Australia -- A bank syndicate approved plans by
Australian publisher and investor Kerry Packer to take
control of Bond Media Ltd.
   Earlier last week, Australia's corporate regulators
cleared the plan.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Bond Media directors recently agreed to restructure the
debt-burdened company's capital and convert $200 million
Australian (US$155.4 million) of preference shares held by
Mr. Packer into common shares. Eventually, the plan calls for
Mr. Packer's closely held Consolidated Press Holdings Ltd. to
control almost 60% of the radio and television-station
operator.</p>
<p>Bond Media also said that a National Australia Bank
Ltd.-led syndicate owed A$367 million extended the credit
until March 29, 1991.</p>
