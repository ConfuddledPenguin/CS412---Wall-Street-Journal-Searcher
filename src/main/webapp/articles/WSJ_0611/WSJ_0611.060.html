	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- A Colorado utility plans the world's first
plant to convert landfill gas into diesel transportation
fuel.
   The $14 million plant, to be built in Pueblo, Colo., will
be owned by Fuel Resources Development Co., a unit of Public
Service Co. of Colorado. The plant is being designed and
built by Ultrasystems Engineers and Constructors Inc., a unit
of Hadson Corp., Oklahoma City, an energy, defense and
construction firm.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The plant, which will produce 100 barrels a day of diesel,
plus 50 barrels of naptha and 80 barrels of high-grade wax,
should be completed around year end, Ultrasystems' president,
John P. Coyle, said. The site is estimated to have 20 years'
worth of recoverable gas.</p>
<p>While there are other plants that recover landfill gas and
turn it into compressed natural gas and other products,
officials of the American Gas Association, a Washington-based
industry group, agreed that Ultrasystems' plant appears to be
the first for converting landfill gas into diesel motor fuel.</p>
<p>Ultrasystems Vice President Jackson Yu explained that the
plant will take the landfill gas -- which is roughly 50%-plus
methane and 40%-plus carbon dioxide -- and first chemically
break it down into carbon monoxide and hydrogen, or syngas,
using basic petrochemical-plant technology.</p>
<p>The syngas then will be run over an iron catalyst
developed by Rentech Inc., Denver, and be reformed into a
number of hydrocarbon compounds and water. The hydrocarbon
compounds then essentially will be refined into diesel,
naptha and wax. The refining process is similar to the
technology that's long been used by South Africa's state oil
company to make a wide range of petroleum products from coal,
AGA officials said.</p>
<p>A spokesman for Public Service of Colorado said the
utility believes there is a big market for its version of
diesel fuel, which it says will be cleaner burning, sulphur
free, and nearly odorless compared to ordinary diesel fuel.
Both Colorado and Southern California have major
air-pollution problems and strict pollution-control
regulations. The spokesman said tests have shown that the
fuel can be used without a major retrofit of vehicles.</p>
<p>The spokesman declined to say how much the new diesel
might cost, although he said that it will be more expensive
than regular diesel. He added, however, that the price will
be competitive with regular diesel.</p>
<p>In an interview, Richard Braun, executive vice president
of Fuel Resources, said the company has so far identified
more than 100 landfills in the U.S. and Canada that would be
economically viable candidates for similar plants. He added
that there are probably many more that haven't yet been
located.</p>
<p>A spokesman for the American Trucking Association said he
hadn't heard of the new fuel. He added that the association
is currently testing several alternative fuels that promise
to be cleaner-burning than regular diesel, and that the
industry is looking for one that is as close as possible in
characteristics to today's diesel fuel.</p>
