	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Just 16 months after RJR Nabisco Inc. went
private in a record-setting leveraged buy-out, a sliver of
the tobacco and food company's equity is trading once again
on the New York Stock Exchange.
   Analysts are gawking at the result.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The equity, in the form of RJR warrants, has soared 45%
from its value at the time of the 1989 buy-out. The RJR
warrants made their debut on the Big Board Friday, after
having traded sporadically over the counter. They finished
Friday at 7 1/4 on brisk volume, up from a value of about 5
at the time of the buy-out.</p>
<p>The boom in RJR warrants contrasts with the shabby
performance of RJR's junk bonds in the past year. Some of
those high-yield bonds have sunk as low as 69 cents on the
dollar, amid worries about RJR's ability to handle certain
intricacies of its debt load next year.</p>
<p>"Something's odd," says Ray Garea, an analyst at
Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette. "You wouldn't think this could
happen."</p>
<p>If RJR has debt troubles as severe as its sagging bond
prices imply, traditional analysis dictates that the warrants
should be nearly worthless. That's because bondholders should
have first claim on a company's assets. On the other hand, if
RJR is faring as well as its warrant price suggests, why are
the bonds doing so badly?</p>
<p>Perhaps the financial markets have just gone haywire, Mr.
Garea suggests, and soon will snap to their senses. "Either
the bonds are a screaming buy," he says, "or the warrants are
a screaming short-(sale candidate.)" (In a short sale, an
investor sells borrowed securities, hoping the price will
fall and that he can buy them back later for less.)</p>
<p>Some savvy investors draw different lessons. They observe
that the public markets are so glutted with RJR junk bonds --
and so starved of RJR equity -- that investors may chase
after the warrants more avidly than the bonds for some time
to come. They think RJR's equity investors may prosper even
if bondholders don't fare so well.</p>
<p>In financing its buy-out, RJR flooded the junk-bond market
with $12.2 billion of junk bonds. "RJR is my No. 1 holding,"
says Gerald Unterman of Cypress Capital Management, a typical
situation for a junk-bond manager. He's bullish about RJR's
outlook, arguing that a surge in the past year's operating
earnings improves its ability to pay debt. But he has largely
exhausted his buying limit for that single issuer.</p>
<p>By contrast, a mere $300 million of RJR warrants are
outstanding. For a token exercise price of seven cents each,
these warrants eventually will convert into RJR common stock,
most of which currently is held by Kohlberg Kravis Roberts
and its investment partnerships. If all the warrants are
exercised when they expire in 10 years, the warrants will
translate into 9% ownership of RJR. The warrants were issued
in February 1989 as a "sweetener" to attract big junk-bond
buyers to RJR bonds. Starting last month, it has been
possible to separate the warrants from the junk bonds and
trade them separately. That's how the warrants came to be
listed on the Big Board.</p>
<p>In a recent report, Salomon Brothers analyst Diana Temple
argues that the warrants are worth $8 to $13 each. Ms. Temple
bases her view on some optimistic forecasts of RJR's
operating earnings in the next few years, and of what sort of
multiple those earnings could command. Still, her analysis
underscores a crucial financial point: If the RJR buy-out
succeeds, there isn't any upward limit on equity holders'
return. The best that most bondholders can hope for is that
their securities will make it back to par, or face value.</p>
<p>The big risk for investors in any RJR security involves
how KKR will handle its obligations concerning two classes of
junk bonds totaling $6 billion. KKR has promised to reset
interest rates on these bonds next April so that the bonds
trade at par. That could be a painful process. These bonds
don't pay cash interest; for the next four to eight years,
they merely pay interest in the form of more bonds, something
investors don't like.</p>
<p>One of the issues, the 14.07% exchange debentures of 2007,
currently trades at 69 cents on the dollar, with an effective
current yield of 20.3%. Resetting the yield to anything near
20% could eventually chew up all of RJR's cash flow and
imperil the company's survival. As Wall Street speculates
about how KKR will handle the "reset" problem, some people
see ways that bondholders mightn't get 100 cents on the
dollar for a long time, if ever, while the warrant holders
could still thrive. Among areas of speculation: KKR could buy
in some bonds at a discount to their face value, albeit at a
premium to their current market price.</p>
<p>Bondholders might not protest too much. "We have a
covenant that says the company has to sit down with two
investment banks and reset these bonds so they trade at par,"
says Cypress's Mr. Unterman. Even so, when asked if he would
sell his most-depressed RJR bonds for 80 cents on the dollar,
Mr. Unterman hesitated before insisting he wouldn't.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, RJR warrants are catching the eyes of brokerage
firms, which are much more comfortable recommending equities
to clients than junk bonds. KKR -- which hasn't had much luck
lately in convincing Wall Street of the appeal of RJR junk
bonds -- has been peppered with brokers' inquiries about the
warrants in the past week or two. Market bears worry that the
warrants might be overpriced at $7.25 each. Yet when there
have been big profits to be made from leveraged investing,
it's generally the people who owned the equity, not the junk
bonds, who got rich.</p>
