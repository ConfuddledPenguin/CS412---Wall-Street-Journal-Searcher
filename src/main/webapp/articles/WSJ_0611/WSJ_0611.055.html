	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- The rest of the country has always thought
Wall Streeters made too much money. Wall Street is starting
to agree.
   Despite several rounds of cost-cutting since the 1987
stock market crash, pay levels at U.S. brokerage firms hit a
record last year, $82,714 for the average employee, nearly
double the level of a decade ago. "Much more needs to be
done" in rolling back compensation levels on Wall Street,
urges the Securities Industry Association, the industry's
main trade group.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>In its annual review of Wall Street -- this one called
"From Riches to Rags" -- the securities association notes
what it says is an alarming trend. Since 1980, pretax profits
in the securities industry have plummeted from $16,182 an
employee to $8,093 last year. However, compensation (salaries
plus bonuses) continues to soar.</p>
<p>Because it doesn't cost Wall Street much to physically
produce its products and services, compensation costs are the
industry's biggest expense aside from interest costs.</p>
<p>During raging bull markets, Wall Street typically pays
little heed to costs. But now the industry is forced to.
While revenues for the 355 brokerage firms that are members
of the New York Stock Exchange rose 15% last year to $60
billion, rising expenses hammered pretax profits, which fell
26% to $1.8 billion, the third-lowest profit of the 1980s.
(Only profits in 1984 and 1987 were lower.) Pretax profit
margins have slipped from double digits in the early 1980s to
3.1% last year.</p>
<p>Why is Wall Street still paying itself so much? Tradition,
complains the securities association's research chief,
Jeffrey Schaefer.</p>
<p>Although the securities industry has slashed 45,000
employees from its work force since the 1987 crash, a cutback
of nearly 20%, "the bulk of departmental trimming began with
staff overcapacity, and the first to go were part-timers,
temps, etc., but rarely the higher-paid department heads or
staff," Mr. Schaefer says. The result: "Per-employee
compensation continues to rise even as profits plummet."</p>
<p>Overall compensation costs slipped last year at the
biggest brokerage firms because of all the layoffs. But the
rising pay-per-employee figures mean that Wall Street is
stuck in a big-pay mode that will cause continual problems,
says the securities association.</p>
<p>Samuel Liss, brokerage industry analyst at Salomon
Brothers Inc., questions the relevance of "per-employee"
statistics. But he agrees that Wall Street has relied too
much on trimming staff, rather than taking a hard look at how
it pays survivors.</p>
<p>"Historically," says Mr. Liss, "the business has too often
defined expense control as being totally dependent on head
count, rather than a reset of compensation schemes."</p>
<p>Some big brokerage firms -- including industry giants
Merrill Lynch & Co. and American Express Co.'s Shearson
Lehman Hutton Inc. -- are making fresh attempts at linking
employee pay with the firm's performance, much as was done
during Wall Street's old private-partnership days. However,
in general, even incentive pay in the industry is too often
tied to how much revenue is generated, rather than actual
profit, says the securities association.</p>
<p>This revenue focus "will just perpetuate the industry's
trend of growing revenues and declining profits," the
association's report says.</p>
<p>The association says that Wall Street pay schemes are
"often irrational." For example, systems and secretarial
personnel working for a capital-markets division may get paid
more than similar workers in the operations division, "even
though they basically perform the same function." Also, the
securities industry tends to pay such workers more than their
counterparts in other industries.</p>
<p>As for high-priced investment banking and broker talent,
Wall Street is in a bind. Firms find themselves forced to
ante up big bucks, even during bad years, to keep top
producers from jumping to competitors -- or as Mr. Liss puts
it, to "the liquid secondary market for disgruntled
producers."</p>
<p>Other observations in the securities association report:</p>
<p>PRIVATE PLACEMENTS: For the first time, the amount of
money raised through private-placement stock issues in 1989
matched that raised in the public markets. The overall
private placement market, including both stocks and bonds,
accounted for 40% of total funds raised, twice 1980's
percentage.</p>
<p>IN-HOUSE TRADING: Trading gains for securities firms' own
accounts soared 9.2% to $12.3 billion in the year, accounting
for one-fifth to one-quarter of industry revenue.</p>
<p>MONEY MANAGEMENT FEES: One focus of the securities
industry has been an unqualified success. Fees from money
management activities soared 18% to $2.2 billion in 1989.</p>
<p>REGIONAL BROKERAGE FIRMS: Brokerage firms based outside
New York enjoyed a resurgence in the past year, but not as
great as some have believed. Profits slipped after peaking in
the second quarter, and profitability "wasn't evenly enjoyed
by all regional firms."</p>
