	<p class="article-leader">STOCKHOLM -- Stung by ballooning losses in this year's
first four months, Saab Automobile AB's new management moved
to cut costs by closing three Scandinavian parts plants.
   The move launches an overhaul of Saab's manufacturing
operations that was expected following General Motors Corp.'s
purchase late last year of a 50% stake in the Swedish auto
maker. The remaining stake is owned by Saab-Scania AB. In a
separate phase of the overhaul, Saab directors approved a
hefty investment program at the Nystad, Finland, plant where
contract assembly of GM's Opel Calibra model will begin in
March.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Saab said it plans to halt the manufacture of wiring
harnesses at plants in Kramfors, Sweden, and Halden, Norway
-- as well as seat production at two other Swedish
facilities. Buying wiring harnesses and seats from outside
suppliers could cost the jobs of as many as 1,400 workers,
nearly 9% of the total work force, Saab said.</p>
<p>The moves would save an estimated 200 million Swedish
kronor a year ($32.7 million). That's only about one-third of
the 600 million kronor a year Saab says it plans to save on
parts purchasing.</p>
<p>Such cost reductions took on added urgency as Saab
disclosed its pretax loss in the four months grew to 995
million kronor from 450 million kronor a year ago. The
company said it expects the "loss rate" to decrease during
the rest of 1990.</p>
