	<p class="article-leader">TORRANCE, Calif. (AP) -- A faulty Toyota pickup design was
cited as a jury awarded $5,270,000 to a woman for injuries
suffered in a 1984 accident.
   Officials with Toyota Motor Sales U.S.A. Inc., a
subsidiary of Toyota Motor Sales Ltd., said the award was one
of the largest ever imposed against the company. Attorneys
for the company said an appeal would be filed.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The Superior Court jury also awarded $100,000 to the two
daughters of Cynthia Gosper, 35 years old, of Garden Grove,
Calif., who was left a quadriplegic from the accident. The
daughters suffered minor injuries in the same accident.</p>
<p>Jurors found that a design flaw in the 1981 4-wheel-drive
SR5 pickup Mrs. Gosper was driving allowed it to roll off a
highway after it was struck from behind. The driver's side
door popped open, throwing Mrs. Gosper from the truck.</p>
<p>Toyota attorneys insisted that the truck's design is safe
and that the force of the collision caused it to roll over.</p>
<p>Sam Cole, an analyst with the Center for Auto Safety, a
Washington-based consumer group, praised the outcome. "I
think the jury was correct in their decision that the vehicle
was designed in an unstable manner," he said.</p>
