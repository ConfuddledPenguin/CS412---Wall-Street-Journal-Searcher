	<p class="article-leader">ADT Ltd., a Bermuda-based holding company, continued its
monthslong accumulation of Christies International PLC stock
by increasing its stake in the auction group to 21.27% from
19.6%.
   Christies said in London that it had been informed that
ADT, through its retirement fund unit, recently increased its
holding to 32.9 million ordinary shares from 30.3 million.
However, ADT's holding is diluted to 19.1% by closely held
Christies A shares. David Tyler, Christies controller, said
ADT hasn't yet informed the company of its intentions. ADT
officials couldn't be reached for comment.</p>
