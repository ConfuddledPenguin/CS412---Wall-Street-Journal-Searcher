	<p class="article-leader">BALTIMORE -- State regulators, feeling the heat of
congressional oversight and pressure from consumer groups,
are beginning to toughen solvency standards for insurance
companies.
   The National Association of Insurance Commissioners met
here last week and adopted several measures designed to help
regulators scrutinize insurers' reserve and capital
requirements as well as their investments in junk bonds. The
group also tightened rules on independent financial audits
and reinsurance practices.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"The states are paying more attention to the financial
condition of insurance companies because it's more of a
problem," says Richard Stewart, a former New York state
insurance commissioner.</p>
<p>The recent sharp rise in the number of insurer
insolvencies and the widely publicized problems of some
insurers' junk-bond investments have helped prod state
regulators to act. Also, state agencies are getting much more
attention from Congress. During the past six months, the
General Accounting Office has issued two reports that found
problems in how states monitor property/casualty company
solvency and reinsurance.</p>
<p>Earl Pomeroy, North Dakota's insurance commissioner and
current president of the national group, concedes that "every
insolvency represents a management failure and a regulatory
failure." He says the parallels drawn between the insurance
industry and the savings and loan crisis, as well as
increased political pressure, served as "a warning shot
across our bow."</p>
<p>By year end, the commissioners' group has pledged to
consider whether insurance-company investments in certain
areas such as junk bonds and real estate should be limited.
The group also plans to take up the thorny issue of whether
insurers' reserves should better reflect the actual risks in
their mix of businesses.</p>
<p>Most critical of the states' regulatory efforts so far is
a report issued by the House Energy and Commerce Committee's
panel on oversight and investigations, led by Rep. John
Dingell (D., Mich.). The subcommittee found serious
weaknesses and breakdowns in the current regulatory system.
Among the problems cited: infrequent examinations based on
outdated information, insufficient capital requirements and
licensing procedures, failure to require use of actuaries and
independent audits, and improper influence exerted on
regulators. Inadequate staffing and regulatory resources were
also mentioned.</p>
<p>Since the passage of the McCarran-Ferguson Act in 1945,
the states have had the responsibility for regulating the
insurance industry. The association of insurance
commissioners -- representing the 50 states, the District of
Columbia, American Samoa, Guam, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin
Islands -- has been the traditional vehicle for addressing
solvency issues at the national level. Its role has been to
develop model laws and regulations.</p>
<p>But the association has no enforcement power. Its model
laws, although usually well-crafted, must be refined and
adopted separately by each state legislature, a practice that
has resulted in some wide differences and inconsistencies.</p>
<p>The rules adopted last week apply to all states. They
increase the credit-quality categories for insurers' bond
portfolios to six from four. Insurers will now be required to
build larger statutory reserves over a shorter period of time
for lesser-grade bonds. In addition, the commissioners
adopted rules requiring that insurers' loss-reserve
statements be signed by certified actuaries.</p>
<p>In an effort to measure effectiveness of the state
regulators themselves, the group also approved development of
an audit process. The goal is to determine how good a job
states do in monitoring insurance companies' solvency. Audits
are to begin within the next 12 months. Results will be made
public so that consumers can know which state commissions
have met the national group's standards.</p>
<p>Mr. Pomeroy says several states are eager to be certified.
But others, including his own state of North Dakota, must
improve internal procedures to qualify.</p>
<p>The association will also be increasing its oversight
role, taking a look at how individual states are dealing with
problem companies. During the meeting last week, several
states were asked to provide more information about their
efforts to shape up troubled insurers.</p>
<p>Kenneth Merin, New Jersey's former insurance commissioner,
says the new emphasis on solvency is appropriate. But for
state insurance commissioners to be more effective in their
home states, he says, legislators and governors have to
confront the same problem. Instead, he says, their attention
"is usually focused on the hot consumer issues such as auto
insurance, worker's comp and health insurance."</p>
