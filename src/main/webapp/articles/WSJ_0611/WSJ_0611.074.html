	<p class="article-leader">SAN JOSE, Calif. -- Cypress Semiconductor Corp. said a
Soviet technology group agreed to grant the company a license
to make chips designed by the group and to use the groups'
manufacturing technology.
   Soviet chip-making technology is thought to be as much as
10 years behind that of the U.S. and Japan. But Cypress
President T.J. Rodgers said the Soviets have some excellent
chip designs and manufacturing processes, such as waste
disposal, that look promising on paper. Technology
constraints have forced bright Soviet engineers to build more
efficient circuits than those of Western chip makers, he
said.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"Their tech is 1978 but they've got a lot of frustrated,
very talented people" who have ideas and designs that could
translate into competitive chips if made in the U.S., Mr.
Rodgers said.</p>
<p>Representatives from the Soviet group visited Cypress's
headquarters last week and showed the company a list of
Soviet-designed chips, including chips that process voice
signals and perform functions needed in high-definition
television, Mr. Rodgers said. Under the agreement, Cypress
will put $100,000 in an escrow account from which the Soviet
group, the International Center for Informatics and
Electronics, will withdraw royalties.</p>
