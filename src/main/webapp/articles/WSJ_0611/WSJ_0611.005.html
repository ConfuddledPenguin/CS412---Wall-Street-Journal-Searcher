	<p class="article-leader">In response to Enola G. Aird's May 8 editorial-page
article "Feminism's Skewed Definition at Wellesley": The
debate at Wellesley centered around the appropriateness of
Barbara Bush as a graduation speaker for a group of women who
have completed four years of a unique education. This
education is based on the philosophy that women historically
have made valuable contributions in all areas of society
including business, politics, law, medicine and family.
   Their contributions often have been unnoticed or
unappreciated, but attest endlessly to their abilities.
Wellesley women are encouraged to use their talents and
skills in striving to accomplish whatever their goals and
aspirations may be, regardless of the barriers with which
they are faced. They have become successful writers,
actresses, lawyers, bankers, politicians and educators. In
addition, many have become important community volunteers.
Many of these women are also mothers and homemakers.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>With so many accomplished women from whom to select, why
then did the students choose Barbara Bush? Mrs. Bush was born
into a wealthy family and dropped out of college to marry
into another fortunate position. Perhaps she is a good
mother. No one doubts her dedication to public service.
However, her ability to give is not based on her own, earned
accomplishments but on those of her husband and her family.
Mrs. Bush's achievements are derived from a class status that
allows her the time, money and luxury to be a full-time
mother and volunteer. I do not mean to belittle her
contributions, for they are noble and valuable. I believe,
however, that her activities did not qualify her to speak to
the graduating class of 1990.</p>

<p>It's about time we moms at home stood up for ourselves and
Ms. Aird did that beautifully.</p>
<p>I am sick of living in a community and a country where
snotty feminists are allowed to dominate public opinion with
their narrow outlook. I am a college graduate who gave up
pursuing a second degree to stay home and care for my
children, and few of my "enlightened" professors or fellow
students could understand why I would be content being a
full-time mom. Yet I can't think of a better use for my
learning than to benefit my family. After all, anybody can be
a doctor, lawyer, secretary, etc. these days, but nobody else
can be Mom to my children.</p>
<p>It is interesting to note that the decline of marriage and
family has paralleled the decline in the number of women at
home. Despite an increased number of college graduates (a
"smarter" population, you might say), families seem to be
suffering more. I await Ms. Aird's "Militant Mothering," but
with such blind and deaf opponents the battle should be easy
to win.</p>

<p>Ms. Aird misinterprets the thrust of the protest as
primarily anti-motherhood, misrepresents all Wellesley
students as full of "disdain for women who choose to care for
their children full-time," and ends her convoluted argument
by accusing the protesters of somehow devaluing children. Her
reaction to what she perceives as the protesters' lack of
respect for motherhood is written in an
I'm-not-gonna-take-it-anymore rhetoric usually reserved for
flag-burning, drug-dealing terrorists. But she neglects to
address the point most central to the protest: Although
Barbara Bush is now an advocate of education in her campaigns
for literacy, she dropped out of college to marry her
husband. Because she did not ever complete her college
degree, she is an inappropriate role model for a graduation
ceremony of a women's college. She lacks the one value
obviously shared by the Wellesley Class of '90: a commitment
to women's higher education.</p>

<p>Ms. Aird has indeed been fortunate in receiving a fine
education, practicing her profession, and being able to be a
full-time mother and serve her community. However, most young
women today do not have those choices.</p>
<p>My own experience has run the gamut: full-time mother and
community volunteer, three children, back to graduate school,
divorce, and working outside my profession to support my
family. Frankly, although Barbara Bush is an admirable
person, she does not represent a role model to me, my
daughter or her contemporaries. Accomplishments like hers are
celebrated -- when community activists are recognized and on
Mother's Day -- but not at college commencements.</p>
<p>Let's face it -- women today still have a difficult time
being recognized as equals in so many fields. New graduates
need to hear from women who have faced those obstacles and
triumphed in spite of them. They need that inspiration.</p>

<p>Mrs. Bush's role as the mother at home is fast becoming
obsolete. For me, the alternative of not working has never
been an option, nor has it been, nor will it be, for a
growing portion of American women. Both Mrs. Bush and Ms.
Aird have that option. That is wonderful. But the simple
facts now are that living costs have gone so high that most
families cannot exist on one income. A few months ago, I
listened with amazement when Mrs. Bush told an interviewer on
public radio that women with young children should not be
working for that extra television set. My salary -- I shouted
to the radio -- pays the mortgage] And, I know I am not the
exception.</p>
<p>So, the real question facing most of the new mothers of
this generation which includes these Wellesley graduates --
is not whether full-time motherhood is a waste of talent.
That is not the issue here. Many of these graduates, like me,
are going to have to continue to work when their children are
born and when they are young. There will be no choice. The
problems that cry out for more attention -- to name a few --
include support from business for the working mother or
father, more child-care options and more job flexibility.</p>
