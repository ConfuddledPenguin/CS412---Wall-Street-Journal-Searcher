	<p class="article-leader">Remembrance of Tiananmen Square, that massive year-ago
uprising against the octogenarian tyrants who rule China,
inevitably leads to speculation about the country's future.
One question is whether China's communist system will be
shattered and fragmented by forces similar to those that are
breaking up the Soviet Union. There is a short answer and a
long answer.
   The short answer is that China is not the Soviet Union.
What the Soviets choose to call a "union" is in fact a
Russian empire in which some very harsh instruments of
political control have been used to force peoples of widely
varying nationalities -- from Letts to Armenians to
Moldavians to the Uzbeks -- to submit to Moscow's authority
against their will. As failed communist economic policies
have weakened Moscow's grip, its unwilling subjects have been
heading for the empire's exits.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>But the Chinese, it is argued, are not that way at all.
They -- particularly the Han majority -- think of themselves
as one people. So whatever happens in China, it won't be the
same thing as what is happening in the U.S.S.R.</p>
<p>Well, that's a short answer, but the long answer is
different and better, in that it explores this question in
greater depth. The process of change will indeed be different
in China, but the result could be similar. The "three Chinas"
that we talk of today -- the mainland, Hong Kong and Taiwan
-- could be supplemented with some further Chinas. Among the
candidates are Guangdong and Fujian, coastal provinces now
under Beijing's control.</p>
<p>For that matter, China is not totally without ethnic
diversity. Its western Moslems, not to mention the unhappy
Tibetans, have aspirations for independence not unlike those
in the restive Soviet republics. China's Moslems probably
identify more closely with the Kirghiz rebels who are
fighting Soviet security forces just across the border, or
the Kashmiris who are fighting Indian troops, than with the
Han majority in China. Islam, as we should know by now, has
significant polarizing power.</p>
<p>But whereas the peoples of the west are driven by ethnic
and religious beliefs, the southeastern coastal provinces of
China are feeling the effects of something altogether
different, economic influences from abroad. Unlike China as a
whole at the moment, they have prospects for significant
economic development. That could, for a number of different
reasons, weaken the political power exercised over them from
Beijing. Their prospects for a degree of both economic and
political independence are considerably better than those of
the western or interior provinces.</p>
<p>Of major importance to this process is that large and
generally affluent Asian population known as the "overseas
Chinese." These are the Chinese who among other things were
wise and foresighted enough to have left mainland China at
some point before or during the 40 years of communist rule.
Now some are going back, not to live but to look for
attractive investments. A lot of non-Chinese also have made
that search, only to be frustrated by Chinese bureaucracy or
appalled by the Tiananmen Square massacre. But the overseas
Chinese have special advantages. They know the language, the
people and the risks.</p>
<p>Tiananmen Square proved that the risks are a lot higher
than many Westerners had suspected. They had overestimated
the regime's commitment to political liberalization and
underestimated its willingness to employ mass murder as an
instrument of political control. But the overseas Chinese are
among Asia's most active risk takers, willing to place their
bets early, when things look bleakest. Proof of that is the
fact that they also are putting some money into two other
benighted areas, Vietnam and Burma, apparently out of a
belief that these places too have very little choice but to
move toward political and economic liberalization.</p>
<p>They have a considerable amount of money to invest. Taiwan
has almost as many dollars in its foreign reserves as Japan
-- some $75 billion. Mainland investments in the hundreds of
millions of dollars by the Taiwanese don't use up much of
that huge chunk but the amount is large by mainland standards
and growing rapidly. A great deal of it is going into Fujian
province, just across the Straits of Taiwan.</p>
<p>The Hong Kong Chinese, for their part, have been steadily
developing an important economic relationship with Guangdong
province, just to their north, and with its capital Guangzhou
(known as Canton in the old days). An estimated two million
Chinese on the communist side of the border now produce
products for Hong Kong firms, and fully 70% of China's
exports to the U.S. pass through Hong Kong. Western companies
have reaped a great harvest of frustration trying to operate
joint ventures with Chinese government enterprises. Even the
Japanese have been turned off by their unhappy experiences in
China. But the Hong Kong Chinese, by focusing on the kinds of
informal, small-scale arrangements that characterize business
in Hong Kong itself, have by and large made their China
investments pay.</p>
<p>Some China analysts think that strengthening business
connections with the outside world are pulling even the party
leaders in the coastal provinces away from the Beijing
party's tentacles. If that is true, it could be the origin of
a trend toward "provincialization" in China, with the
separate provinces exercising a greater degree of autonomy
than they have ever achieved in the years since the
communists came to power. The question of whether Hong Kong
might take over China in 1997 -- rather than the other way
around as currently planned -- is facetious. But it is not
out of the question that Guangdong might become more like
Hong Kong, thus representing a buffer of sorts against the
post-1997 destruction of Hong Kong's economy by mainland
communists trying to work their will on that free and
prosperous place.</p>
<p>But while all this is a hopeful scenario, a very powerful
note of caution is required. The overseas Chinese themselves
are exercising due care in their investments. A good many
Hong Kong citizens are not optimistic and many have migrated
to Canada or elsewhere. There are no economic miracles yet in
Guangdong or Fujian, and there won't be until Beijing's old
men are replaced by leaders willing to make really serious
economic and political reforms. Beijing's control of both
Hong Kong and Guangdong could destroy both. Moreover, other
Chinese provinces, because of the regime's mismanagement,
face very bleak futures -- perhaps even famine -- that could
lead to a political explosion rather than evolution.</p>
<p>But as the Journal's Claudia Rosett wrote on the page
opposite last week, something will have to change in China.
The anger of the huge crowds that protested in Tiananmen
Square, although suppressed with bullets, made that clear. If
you are making bets on China's future, the possibility of
provincialization, under the influence of overseas Chinese
who have learned how countries achieve economic success,
wouldn't necessarily be the worst one.</p>
