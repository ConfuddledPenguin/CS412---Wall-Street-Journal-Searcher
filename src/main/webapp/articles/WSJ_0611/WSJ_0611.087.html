	<p class="article-leader">WAYNE, N.J. -- GND Holdings Corp., parent of Grand Union
Co., said its net loss in the fiscal fourth quarter widened
as depreciation and amortization of assets increased
following the purchase of the supermarket chain.
   For the 12 weeks ended March 31, the loss widened to $14.4
million from $12.4 million a year earlier. Sales grew 2.5% to
$653.1 million from $637 million.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>For the year, the net loss widened to $53.8 million from
$14.9 million. Sales rose 7.3% to $2.92 billion from $2.72
billion. For the year, earnings before depreciation and
amortization, last-in, first-out accounting provisions,
unusual items, interest and taxes rose 20% to $170 million
from $141.5 million. Total interest expense increased to
$136.7 million from $95.3 million.</p>
<p>GND, whose principals include the New York investment
firms of Miller Tabak Hirsch & Co. and Salomon Inc., acquired
Grand Union in July in a leveraged buy-out. GND said that for
comparative purposes, results of GND for the 36 weeks
following the purchase were combined with results of GU
Acquisition Corp., the predecessor company, for the 16 weeks
before the acquisition. The combined results are compared
with those of GU Acquisition for the year ended April 1,
1989.</p>
<p>Earnings for the year before LIFO provision, depreciation
and amortization, unusual items, interest and income taxes,
increased 14% to $39.5 million from $34.8 million. GND said
results below the line of earnings before LIFO provision,
depreciation and amortization, unusual items, interest and
income taxes, aren't comparable on a year-to-year basis,
because of the acquisition of Grand Union last July.</p>
<p>Interest expense in the quarter rose to $35.6 million from
$24.5 million.</p>
<p>The purchase agreement last year called for the Miller
Tabak-Salomon group to pay $60 million for an 80% stake, and
for management to pay $15 million for the remainder. The
buyers also assumed about $300 million in existing debt, and
said they would refinance $545 million in bank debt and issue
about $325 million in new, high-yield junk bonds.</p>
