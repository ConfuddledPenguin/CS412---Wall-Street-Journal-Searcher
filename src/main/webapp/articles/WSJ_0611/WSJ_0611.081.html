	<p class="article-leader">HOUSTON -- U.S. Home Corp. said it will move to preserve
its cash by paying interest on its $13.7 million in 17 1/2%
reset notes due Dec. 15, 1997, and its $1.6 million in 10%
convertible subordinated debentures due Dec. 15, 1995, in
stock.
   The homebuilder said it paid the interest due last
December in cash, but made the interest payments in stock
last June, as allowed by the indentures for the debt.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The company said it will issue about 1.3 million common
shares to make the $1.3 million interest payment. It has
about 44 million shares outstanding.</p>
