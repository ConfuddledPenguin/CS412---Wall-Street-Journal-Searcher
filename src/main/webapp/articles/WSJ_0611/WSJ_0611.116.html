	<p class="article-leader">With the "easy" Gorbachev summit past him, President Bush
now returns to the work of the less glamorous budget summit.
By committing himself to this process, the president pulled
the congressional leadership's fat out of the fire. His
efforts are not likely to be rewarded.
   Recent experience and academic literature demonstrate that
presidents will tend to restrain the growth of government,
while Congress will tend to expand it. Moreover, Republicans
will tend to dominate the presidency, while Democrats will
tend to dominate Congress. Both presidents and Congress are
perfectly willing to engage in deficit finance. But when the
deficit gets too large, presidents are likely to deal with it
by restraining spending, while Congress is likely to prefer a
tax increase. Of the two, restraining spending is more
effective in reducing the deficit.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Had President Bush not agreed to a summit, he could have
held the line on taxes quite easily. Congress was unlikely to
pass a tax increase without his acquiescence, and even if it
did, the president could have vetoed the bill and been
sustained. Moreover, he would still have gained a substantial
deficit reduction. Under Gramm-Rudman-Hollings, the projected
deficit must be no more than $74 billion or else
across-the-board cuts (a sequester) must be administered to
reduce the projected deficit to $64 billion. And, given
congressional demands for a "peace dividend," President Bush
would likely have gotten a higher number for defense through
the sequester than Congress is likely to give him in any
budget deal.</p>
<p>Budget summits are also bad for presidents because the
congressional leadership cannot deliver. The days when a
Lyndon Johnson and a Sam Rayburn could drop in on an
Eisenhower and cut a little deal are long past. Although
congressional leaders will negotiate in earnest, the deal
they strike with a president is a mere proposal to be put
before Congress.</p>
<p>As an illustration, at the conclusion of the 1987 budget
summit, literally as we were pushing our chairs back from the
table, Tom Foley (the group's chairman) looked across the
table at the White House team (Jim Baker, Howard Baker and
me) and said, "Now, you've got to help us get this thing
passed]" This was after 20 arduous days and nights of
negotiating -- half the time that Noah spent on the ark]
While I do not question the integrity of congressional
leadership, there does seem something unwholesome about
congressional invitations to "deal." In commercial law, if
you negotiate to sell something that you cannot deliver, it
is known as fraud.</p>
<p>A third problem, related to the second, is that a
president has no assurance that Congress will not "undo" the
deal at some future time. For example, the 1987 budget summit
concluded in a two-year agreement for fiscal 1988 and 1989.
According to the agreement, the administration agreed to a
tax increase in exchange for certain budget "cuts" relative
to the current-services baseline. The claim of the group was
that over two years there would be "$76 billion in real
deficit reduction."</p>
<p>Yet, what really happened? Under the agreement, compared
with OMB's mid-session review baseline, receipts were
supposed to increase over the previous year by $68.6 billion
for 1988 and $69.8 billion for 1989. The actual increases
were $54.9 billion and $81.8 billion, respectively. So,
Congress pretty much got its increased revenue. But what
about the spending cuts? Under the agreement, outlays were
supposed to rise by $3.3 billion in 1988 and $43.6 billion in
1989. Instead, they went up a whopping $60.3 billion and
$78.8 billion, respectively. In short, President Reagan got
taken. So did the American people. Under the agreement, the
deficit should have been $93.1 billion in 1988 and $66.9
billion in 1989. Instead, the deficits were $155.1 billion
and $152.1 billion, respectively.</p>
<p>The "bottom line" is that in 1987, when President Reagan
held firm against invitations to "deal" and threatened to
veto any tax increase and any appropriations he deemed
excessive, the deficit narrowed by a record $71.5 billion (to
$149.7 billion from $221.2 billion). But when he went along
with demands for a budget summit, we got additional taxes,
spending growth, and no progress on the deficit.</p>
<p>Of course, it is conceivable that President Bush will be
able to negotiate budget-process reforms (a balanced-budget
amendment, an item-reduction veto, etc.) that would change
incentives sufficiently to solve the basic problem of deficit
finance and excessive spending. Much more likely, however, is
that he will have to settle for promised cuts in spending,
increased taxes (that will materialize and will be spent),
and little progress on the deficit. Soon, Congress will again
find itself in a deadlock and leaders will call upon the
president to bail them out with another budget summit.</p>
