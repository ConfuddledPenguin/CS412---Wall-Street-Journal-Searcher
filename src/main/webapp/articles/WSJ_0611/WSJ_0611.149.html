	<p class="article-leader">SAN FRANCISCO -- Transamerica Corp. said it agreed to
acquire First Interstate Bancorp's consumer-lending operation
for $108 million, in what is part of First Interstate's
effort to shore up battered earnings.
   Under the agreement, expected to close in July,
Transamerica will acquire First Interstate's Nova Financial
Services operation, which had about $430 million in
receivables on March 31. First Interstate said it expects a
pretax gain of more than $90 million from the sale.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The gain on the sale was higher than some analysts
expected. "The level of profit is good," said analyst Donald
Crowley at Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, who expected the unit to
sell for $70 million to $80 million. Selling the Nova unit
was the biggest part of First Interstate's divestment
strategy in which, he said, "They're trying to get rid of
what they consider nonstrategic assets." First Interstate put
Nova up for sale last March and is also trying to sell its
Los Angeles headquarters building.</p>
<p>The accord expands Transamerica's finance group, which
provided about half of the company's 1989 net earnings of
$332 million on revenue of $6.8 billion. Transamerica, with
$30.3 billion in assets, had $3.1 billion in finance
receivables outstanding on March 31. Transamerica said the
Nova acquisition will increase its total assets by about 5%
to $9.5 billion.</p>
<p>In trading on the New York Stock Exchange Friday,
Transamerica's stock closed at $39.375, down 62.5 cents;
First Interstate's shares closed at $42.375, down 50 cents.</p>
