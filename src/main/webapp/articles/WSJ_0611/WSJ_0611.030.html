	<p class="article-leader">IRVINE, Calif. -- Taco Bell Corp. said it recalled 300,000
plastic sports water bottles sold last week as part of a
nationwide promotion, because it discovered that a mouthpiece
part could be swallowed by children.
   Taco Bell, a Mexican-style fast-food chain, said no
injuries were related to the water bottle. But the company, a
unit of PepsiCo Inc., Purchase, N.Y., said it decided to stop
selling the bottles when a customer reported that his
21-month-old child had dismantled one of the bottles and
tried to swallow the mouthpiece. Last Friday, Taco Bell said
it had learned that two other children had done the same
thing.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Taco Bell last Monday began selling the water bottles for
99 cents each with a food purchase. Initial plans called for
the sale of about 2.5 million of the bottles, which were part
of a $12 million "Tacos to Go" advertising campaign.</p>
<p>The recall is voluntary and is being coordinated through
the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission, Taco Bell said.
Commission officials couldn't be reached to comment. The
bottle's manufacturer, Specialized Bicycle Components of
Morgan Hill, Calif., said it halted production of the
bottles, which it has made for 10 years, while it discusses
the matter with the safety commission.</p>
<p>Taco Bell said people can return the bottles for refunds.
A spokesman said the company hadn't determined the cost of
the recall.</p>
