	<p class="article-leader">LONDON -- France's Societe Nationale Elf Aquitaine, one of
the major crude oil producers in the West African state of
Gabon, lifted the force majeure notice it issued May 28 on
loadings of crude from the country's main oil port of Port
Gentil, industry sources said.
   People close to the companies which had received the force
majeure notice said the loading ban had been lifted about the
middle of last week, and that new loading dates for cargos
affected by the move had been received.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Elf imposed the force majeure notice, which informed
buyers of crude from the company that original loading plans
would have to be canceled, following rioting in Port Gentil
to protest the government of Omar Bongo.</p>
<p>During the disturbances, French troops were sent to Gabon.
Many oil industry personnel and dependents were evacuated and
oil production in the country was considerably reduced.</p>
<p>Oil output has now apparently recovered, industry
officials said.</p>
<p>The other main oil-field operator in Gabon, Royal
Dutch/Shell Group, didn't issue force majeure notices during
the disturbances, and cargos loading from Shell's Gamba
loading terminal were only slightly delayed, the sources
said.</p>
<p>Gabon produces fairly light, sweet crude oil which is
popular with U.S. and European refiners. Its total oil
production is estimated at about 260,000 to 280,000 barrels a
day.</p>
