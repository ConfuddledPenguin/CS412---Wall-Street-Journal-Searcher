	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Help-wanted advertising continued its sluggish
pace in April, and remained sharply lower than the
year-earlier level.
   The Conference Board said its help-wanted advertising
index fell to 138 in April, down from 139 in March and 21
points below April 1989.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The index, a seasonally adjusted indicator of hiring
plans, has remained about the same since February. The index
uses 1967 as a base of 100.</p>
<p>Ken Goldstein, a Conference Board economist, said, "If
business activity is indeed picking up, as we think is the
case, an increase in want-ad volume should start showing up
shortly."</p>
<p>Regionally, want-ad volume rose in the East South Central
and East North Central areas 5.8% and 4.4%, respectively, but
declined elsewhere.</p>
<p>Hardest-hit was New England, where help-wanted advertising
has declined 34% in the past year. The Pacific region, down
3.5%, suffered the mildest decline.</p>
<p>The Conference Board, a business-research organization,
surveys help-wanted advertising volume in 51 major newspapers
every month.</p>
