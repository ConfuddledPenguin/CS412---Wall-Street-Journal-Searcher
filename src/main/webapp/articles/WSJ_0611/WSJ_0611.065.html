	<p class="article-leader">SAN FRANCISCO -- In a new twist in the decade-long AIDS
epidemic, doctors say many AIDS patients are beating
infections and living longer only to develop an aggressive
cancer of the lymph system.
   As better treatments succeed in repelling infections,
patients with acquired immune deficiency syndrome may survive
the once life-threatening episodes of pneumonia and other
sicknesses to live years longer than they once did. However,
the erosion of their immune system leaves them vulnerable to
a virulent form of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, a cancer of the
B-cells produced in the body's lymph nodes.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The trend represents a major shift in the course of the
epidemic and a setback for the group that previously had
embodied the most hope -- those patients who were long-term
survivors. Meanwhile, what role the drug AZT may play in the
development of lymphoma is unclear, suggesting a new
direction for future AIDS research. Questions surrounding the
drug, which is made by Wellcome PLC, London, are sure to
provoke debate, especially from gay activists who feel AZT
has unfairly dominated the nation's research agenda. Efforts
to reach a Wellcome spokesman were unsuccessful over the
weekend.</p>
<p>Doctors at major AIDS centers are reporting a steep surge
in the number of AIDS-related lymphoma cases this year. "In
the first three months of 1990, we've more than doubled the
rate from prior years," says Lawrence Kaplan, of the
University of California at San Francisco. "It's an
extraordinary number of what we think of as a fairly unusual
disease."</p>
<p>At New England Deaconess Hospital in Boston, almost 10% of
advanced AIDS patients develop the lymphoma -- virtually all
of them while taking the drug AZT. Other centers see more,
increasing with length of diagnosis and time on AZT.</p>
<p>The trend "is real and important. It represents the
clinical evolution of AIDS," says Jerome E. Groopman of the
Deaconess Hospital. Where patients once succumbed after a
swift bout of pneumonia, AZT plus aerosol pentamidine and
other drugs now allay the acute danger of death from
infection, he says. Now, doctors see more chronic
neurological problems, and a wasting syndrome, but the most
striking new feature is the lymphoma, Dr. Groopman says.
"AIDS is a changing disease," Dr. Groopman cautions. "We have
to be flexible and ready to address new clinical events as
they arise."</p>
<p>Cancer has been associated with AIDS from the start.
Kaposi's Sarcoma (KS), a tumor of blood vessels, was the
earliest AIDS-linked malignancy to appear, but its incidence
has declined while lymphoma's has surged. In San Francisco,
for example, KS cases grew at a 2% annual rate in 1986 and
1987, the most recent years for which figures are available,
while lymphoma cases soared 48%, according to a report
published last week by the National Cancer Institute.</p>
<p>Moreover, cancer is a risk for anyone with a weakened
immune system. People who receive organ transplants run a
heightened risk of cancer due to the immunosuppressive drugs
they take to prevent transplant rejection. Children with
congenital diseases like SCID (severe combined immune
deficiency) also develop more than their share of tumors.</p>
<p>Studies in the U.S. show lymphoma also is on the rise in
elderly men for unknown reasons, possibly due to herbicides
or other environmental factors, says Robert Yarchoan, a
senior scientist at the National Cancer Institute.</p>
<p>Still, the rate of AIDS lymphoma -- now approaching 20% or
more for the most advanced patients on AZT -- is two to three
times the expected rate of such cancer in other immune
deficiencies, and even in early AIDS.</p>
<p>"The critical question is whether AZT is acting to enhance
the lymphoma, or whether the lymphoma is the outcome of a
prolonged immune deficiency," says Dr. Groopman. "Clearly,
people with AIDS develop lymphoma even when they aren't
taking AZT, as do people with organ transplants."</p>
<p>The mystery of AIDS lymphoma may involve several factors
acting in concert to set the stage for cancer: AIDS, another
microbe, and genetic damage.</p>
<p>About half of the AIDS lymphoma tumors contain a second
virus, Epstein-Barr virus, a member of the herpes family that
is already implicated in certain other cancers, Dr. Groopman
says.</p>
<p>Other AIDS lymphomas contain evidence of genetic damage:
breaks in certain chromosomes, or expression of an oncogene,
or cancer-promoting gene, called "myc."</p>
<p>"You might see that a patient today living four years with
AIDS -- in contrast with someone in 1984 who lived two years
-- might have more such chromosomal damage," Dr. Groopman
said. "My gut feeling is that it's not AZT," he added, but he
plans further studies to investigate the drug's possible
role.</p>
<p>AZT has been reported to cause vaginal tumors in rodents,
but "We think that's a different mechanism," Dr. Yarchoan of
the cancer institute said. Such a rise in vaginal tumors
hasn't been reported among women on AZT.</p>
<p>Dr. Kaplan of San Francisco suggests that a potential clue
to lymphoma's origin lies in one of the very first visible
symptoms of AIDS infection: swollen lymph nodes.</p>
<p>"Those lymph nodes are swollen because B-cells are going
wild," he says. "They're hyperactive and proliferating, so
that they can make antibodies to the AIDS virus. When you
have a patient in that situation, it stands to reason that
the longer their B-cells are proliferating, the greater the
chance that some second event will come along -- either a
second virus, or a spontaneous genetic {mutation}."</p>
<p>By Dr. Kaplan's reckoning, AZT contributes only "in an
extremely roundabout way, by making people live longer so
they get these malignancies."</p>
<p>Whatever the cause or causes, the prognosis for patients
with AIDS lymphoma is poor, with an average survival time of
about six months. Treatment so far is limited to the
conventional array of anticancer drugs. Many patients,
however, are too ill to withstand the rigors of chemotherapy,
because their bone marrow is depleted by the disease or by
AZT. Dr. Groopman's clinic has three patients in complete
remission, who are alive three years after treatment of their
lymphoma, but more often the cancer recurs, he says.</p>
<p>"In the worst-case scenario, we often see a situation like
that with Burkitt's lymphoma, where tumors double in size
overnight," says Dr. Kaplan. "You see a patient, and the next
day, his tumor has grown visibly."</p>
<p>"They are very aggressive tumors, found in the brain,
lung, and gastrointestinal tract," says Dr. Yarchoan. Unlike
classic B-cell lymphomas, which often crop up in the lymph
nodes, AIDS lymphomas often hide in the brain where their
symptoms may be mistaken for AIDS dementia, which is often
caused by toxoplasmosis, a parasitic infection.</p>
<p>"It's not uncommon for the lymphoma to be undiagnosed,"
says Parkash Gill, of the University of California Medical
School in Los Angeles. "So for many cases, it may be
unreported."</p>
<p>Experts are bracing for a rise in the number of lymphoma
cases. "I believe we'll see more of these cases as a result
of antiretroviral therapy, and treatment of opportunistic
infections," Dr. Yarchoan agrees, adding that he and his
colleagues at the cancer institute are analyzing AIDS
patients who developed lymphoma while participating in
treatment studies.</p>
