	<p class="article-leader">Home Owners Savings Bank said it sold its stake in
American Southwest Mortgage Investments Corp., a real-estate
investment trust in Tucson, Ariz.
   In a Securities and Exchange Commission filing, Home
Owners Savings said it sold 954,800 American Southwest common
shares in the open market from April 17 to June 4 for $3.18
to $4.05 each.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Home Owners Savings, formerly Home Owners Federal Savings
& Loan Association, gave no reason in the filing for selling
its holding.</p>
<p>Joseph C. Chan, American Southwest's chief operating
officer, said the stock sale is "positive for us, because it
removes the uncertainty as to that block of stock," which
amounted to less than a 7% stake in the company.</p>
