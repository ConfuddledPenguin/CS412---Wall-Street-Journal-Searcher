	<p class="article-leader">Manuel Noriega was hit by two legal blows when a
co-defendant pleaded guilty and agreed to testify against him
and a judge rejected a string of legal challenges to the
charges against the deposed Panamanian dictator.
   Enrique Pretelt, a Panamanian businessman and former close
associate of Mr. Noriega, pleaded guilty in federal court in
Tampa, Fla., Friday to two felony counts -- conspiring with
Mr. Noriega and attempting to import 400,000 pounds of
marijuana into the U.S. through Panama.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>According to several lawyers in the case -- including Mr.
Pretelt's attorney, George Tragos -- Mr. Pretelt's testimony
may bolster the U.S. government's cases against Mr. Noriega,
who faces federal drug charges in Miami and Tampa.</p>
<p>"He was a close personal friend as well as a business
associate of Noriega," said Mr. Tragos of Clearwater, Fla.
"I'm sure he will be able to corroborate a lot."</p>
<p>Among other things, Mr. Pretelt is said to have been
present at a meeting in Cuba that included Fidel Castro, Mr.
Noriega, and members of the Medellin, Colombia, drug cartel.
The Miami indictment alleges that at that meeting Mr. Castro
mediated a dispute between Mr. Noriega and the drug lords,
who were angry that Mr. Noriega had destroyed a
cocaine-processing plant in Panama despite having received
payments to protect it.</p>
<p>Mr. Pretelt's cooperation is also expected to shore up the
prosecution's case against Mr. Noriega in Tampa where he was
the sole co-defendant.</p>
<p>Defense lawyers familiar with the case have said its key
weakness was that it appeared to rely too heavily on the
expected testimony of one convicted drug smuggler -- Steven
Kalish. Samuel Buffone, Mr. Kalish's lawyer, said, "If
Pretelt would testify truthfully and accurately, he would
corroborate Mr. Kalish's story." In his plea agreement, Mr.
Pretelt said the U.S. could prove that he and Mr. Kalish
formed a business partnership with Mr. Noriega and another
drug trafficker for laundering drug money for Mr. Kalish.</p>
<p>Separately, on Friday, U.S. District Judge William M.
Hoeveler, who presides over the Miami case, swept aside every
legal challenge Mr. Noriega has raised as to the legality of
the charges against him. In an 80-page order that addresses
several legal issues never before a federal court before,
Judge Hoeveler rejected a defense argument that the U.S.
lacks jurisdiction over Mr. Noriega because the alleged
crimes occurred outside the U.S.</p>
<p>The judge was also unconvinced by arguments that Mr.
Noriega enjoyed immunity as Panama's ruler. He noted Mr.
Noriega was never recognized by the U.S. or the Panamanian
constitution as Panama's head of state, adding that such
immunity generally pertains to official actions. "The court
fails to see how Noriega's alleged drug trafficking and
protection of money launderers could conceivably constitute
public action taken on behalf of the Panamanian state," the
judge said.</p>
<p>The judge also refused to dismiss the charges on the basis
that the U.S. invasion of Panama, which resulted in the
deaths of innocent civilians, was so outrageous it "shocked
the conscience of the court," making Mr. Noriega's arrest
illegal. He said Mr. Noriega couldn't evade drug charges
because third parties may have had their rights violated.</p>
<p>The judge also declined to use his "supervisory power" to
drop the charges on the basis that the U.S. government's
actions were so vile he was required to do so. He said it was
beyond his "province to determine whether or under what
circumstances war is immoral."</p>
<p>The U.S. attorney in Miami declined to comment; the U.S.
attorney in Tampa couldn't be reached. Mr. Noriega's lawyers
also couldn't be reached.</p>
