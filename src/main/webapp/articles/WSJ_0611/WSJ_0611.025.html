	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- The Australian dollar has been springier than
a kangaroo's hop recently because of Australia's high
interest rates, and currency specialists forecast continued
strength in the near term.
   With rates holding firm, the mood about the currency is
bullish even though further Reserve Bank of Australia
intervention is expected and worries about slower Australian
economic growth persist.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"The day-to-day tone looks firm for now," says Trevor
Woodland, corporate sales manager at Harris Trust & Savings
Bank in Chicago. "I think the rise is almost entirely driven
by high interest rates and expectations that they are going
to stay that way."</p>
<p>Late Friday here, the Australian dollar traded at 77.18
U.S. cents, off from 77.70 cents late Thursday, but
substantially higher than levels around 75 cents in early
February.</p>
<p>Impressed with Australia's interest rates, some traders
predict the Australian dollar will work its way toward 80
cents in the next few weeks.</p>
<p>Australia's interest rates are among the most attractive
of major industrial nations even though the Reserve Bank of
Australia eased its monetary policy several times earlier
this year after remaining restrictive for almost two years.</p>
<p>Three-month Euro Australian dollar deposits currently
yield more than 15%, roughly eight percentage points more
than three-month Euroyen deposits and seven percentage points
more than three-month Eurodollar and Euro West German mark
deposits.</p>
<p>High interest rates are often helpful for a currency,
partly because they make yields attractive in the
Eurocurrency market.</p>
<p>Responding to signs of softness in the economy, the
Australian central bank loosened credit several times before
the nation's general elections were held March 24. The
Australian dollar slid in response to those moves, but it
stabilized once traders perceived rates weren't going to fall
very far.</p>
<p>Australia's treasurer, Paul Keating, has said that
"excessive easing" must be avoided to prevent an upturn in
demand and cost pressures. The inflation rate has run close
to 8% in recent years.</p>
<p>"There's no reason for {the Australian dollar} to go down"
as long as interest rates remain high, says Martin May, a
trader of Australian government bonds at National Australia
Bank Ltd. in New York.</p>
<p>But further Australian dollar gains may be a rocky ride,
traders warn. The Reserve Bank of Australia, which worked
hard to support the dollar only a few months ago, is now
trying to curb its strength.</p>
<p>Friday's decline was caused by profit-taking that occurred
after the central bank was spotted intervening during Sydney
dealings, traders say.</p>
<p>A very strong Australian dollar can hurt Australia's trade
performance by making the nation's exports too costly for
foreigners and increasing the domestic appetite for imports.
The Reserve Bank is expected to fight hard to keep the
Australian dollar down and prevent a worsening of the trade
picture.</p>
<p>Australia had an unadjusted current account deficit of
1.02 billion Australian dollars in April, narrower than
A$2.04 billion (US$1.57 billion) in March.</p>
<p>There's "good ground for concern" that exports will be
pinched if the Australian dollar keeps rising, says Rick
Porter, manager of corporate trading at Westpac Banking Corp.
in New York.</p>
<p>Australia is an exporter of many products, including beef,
wheat, metal ores, wool and coal. More than half of its
arable land is used for agriculture.</p>
<p>This year's generally firmer commodity prices are seen
supportive of the Australian dollar, even though gold is
trading at its lowest levels in four years, currency analysts
say.</p>
<p>Against its trade-weighted index, the Australian dollar is
hovering near 61.0 after moving out of an expected range of
58.0 to 60.0, and this certainly makes competitiveness an
issue for the central bank, says Mr. Porter.</p>
<p>The trade-weighted index measures the Australian dollar's
value against a basket of 24 currencies; the weights have
been set by the Reserve Bank of Australia.</p>
<p>Intervention isn't expected to spoil the Australian
dollar's rise right now, not with high rates working in its
favor.</p>
<p>Because a number of recent economic reports have showed
unexpected strength, more Reserve Bank easing isn't seen
likely for a while. Australia's gross domestic product rose a
larger-than-expected 1.8% in the first quarter. Last month,
the number of employed workers rose to 7,903,100 from
7,861,000 in April, more than economists had expected.</p>
<p>But the scenario may change soon and possibly injure the
Australian dollar. Analysts say high rates may suppress
growth in a number of sectors in the second half of the year,
likely causing a resurfacing of easing fears.</p>
<p>Treasurer Keating said last week that lower rates of
spending, production and employment are likely as the economy
makes the transition to lower spending and lower inflation
after rapid growth and spending in the past.</p>
<p>The Australian dollar may fall to 70 U.S. cents or lower
by year end if it is plagued by easing worries, says Mr.
Woodland of Harris Trust & Savings Bank.</p>
<p>As for the U.S. dollar, continued range trading is
expected as traders await fresh news about the U.S. economy,
the move toward German monetary union and the Soviet Union's
political turmoil.</p>
<p>Late Friday in New York, the dollar traded at 1.6975 marks
and 153.49 yen, up from 1.6935 marks and 152.55 yen late
Thursday.</p>
<p>In Tokyo Monday, the dollar was trading at 153.45 yen soon
after opening at 153.35 yen. Meanwhile, the U.S. currency was
trading at about 1.6985 marks, up a bit from Friday's Tokyo
close of 1.6938 marks.</p>
<p>On the Commodity Exchange in New York Friday, gold for
current delivery settled at $355.70 an ounce, up $1.10.
Estimated volume was a moderate 2.8 million ounces.</p>
<p>In Hong Kong Monday, gold was quoted at $354.45 an ounce.</p>
