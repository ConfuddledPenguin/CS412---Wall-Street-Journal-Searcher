	<p class="article-leader">California Energy Co. said SCEcorp's Mission Power
Engineering Co. unit filed a complaint in state court in Inyo
County against California Energy and its partners. In the
complaint, Mission Power claims additional compensation of
between $70 million and $80 million for construction work on
a series of power plants, California Energy said.
   California Energy said it is discussing the claims with
Mission Power. San Francisco-based California Energy, which
produces energy from geothermal resources, said it "disputes
the amounts claimed by Mission Power Engineering."</p>
