	<p class="article-leader">LOS ANGELES -- A federal jury convicted David Arnold
Feldman, 50 years old, of Palos Verdes Estates, Calif., of
defrauding financial institutions, including BankAmerica
Corp., of about $144 million in a mortgage investment scheme.
   Mr. Feldman was convicted on three counts of mail fraud,
but was acquitted of two other counts. He faces as long as 15
years in prison. Sentencing by Judge Dickran Tevrizian is
scheduled for Aug. 20.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Two other principal figures in the mortgage fraud pleaded
guilty earlier this year to reduced charges of mail fraud in
the case. They are Ken Borden Rogers, 50, of Huntington
Beach, and George Charles Ash Jr., 45, of Alta Loma. The
three were indicted last year for scheming to sell what
proved to be practically worthless mortgage loans to 20 banks
and savings and loan associations outside California.</p>
<p>The men had promised high interest rates and had assured
investors that their investments were protected by
independent underwriting policies, among other safeguards.</p>
<p>Most of the loans later went into default, and Bank of
America, as the trustee for most of the mortgage securities
pools, repurchased them and took a total of $95 million in
charges against the 1984 earnings of its parent, BankAmerica
Corp.</p>
<p>When the three men were indicted by a federal grand jury
last year, prosecutors called the case one of the largest
single frauds ever perpetrated in the savings and loan
business.</p>
<p>Mr. Feldman had been free on bond but was ordered returned
to custody to await sentencing.</p>
