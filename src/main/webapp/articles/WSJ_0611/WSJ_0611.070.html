	<p class="article-leader">A federal judge criticized the Commerce Department for
taking a "bare minimum" approach to complying with an
agreement that was meant to correct the Census Bureau's
undercounting of minorities.
   Judge Joseph McLaughlin also declared that it would be
constitutional for a statistical adjustment to be made in the
actual census count, if that would make the total more
accurate. Lawyers for New York, Los Angeles and other major
cities say that such an adjustment is necessary to correct
the undercounting of minorities. The Commerce Department,
which oversees the Census Bureau, has questioned whether the
adjustment would be constitutional.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"The concept of statistical adjustment is wholly valid,
and may very well be long overdue," said Judge McLaughlin, of
Brooklyn. Judge McLaughlin also raised questions about the
guidelines the Commerce Department has developed for
evaluating whether a statistical adjustment will be made. But
he stopped short of ordering the department to scrap the
guidelines, as the cities and other critics of the census had
requested.</p>
<p>The attorney handling the case for the Commerce Department
couldn't be reached for comment.</p>
<p>Peter Zimroth, a partner in the New York office of Arnold
& Porter, who represents New York City, said that under Judge
McLaughlin's decision, "if the Commerce Department chooses
not to adjust {the count}, it will have to prove that the
unadjusted numbers are more accurate."</p>
<p>The judge's decision stems from a suit filed by New York
and other cities in 1988 over the undercounting. In what was
considered a victory for the cities, the Commerce Department
last summer agreed to develop guidelines for adjusting the
census to make up for the large number of people who aren't
counted. Census figures are used to determine congressional
representation and some federal funding.</p>
<p>Noting that some of the guidelines "lend themselves easily
to abuse," Judge McLaughlin said the department is "on
notice, if it is not already clear, that backdoor attempts to
evade their commitment will not be countenanced."</p>
<p>The judge also accused the Commerce Department of
improperly depleting an account that was meant to fund an
independent advisory panel overseeing the issue. The judge
said he will order the Commerce Department to come up with
more funds if necessary.</p>

<p>BANKRUPTCY JUDGE APPOINTS special adviser to review
funding of Manville trust.</p>
<p>U.S. Bankruptcy Court Judge Burton Lifland, who presided
over Manville Corp.'s Chapter 11 reorganization, named Leon
Silverman to look into allegations that the fund is
mismanaged and inadequately funded.</p>
<p>It was Judge Lifland's first public response to decisions
issued by two judges raising questions about the trust.
Federal Judge Jack B. Weinstein and New York state Justice
Helen Freedman had told the trust and Manville to return to
bankruptcy court to address the problems, or face possible
harsh measures.</p>
<p>Judge Lifland said the judges' orders "raise important
issues about the trust and the consummated plan of
reorganization." The trust, which is independent of the
company, was formed as part of the reorganization plan to pay
asbestos personal-injury claims.</p>
<p>The trust and the company praised the appointment of Mr.
Silverman.</p>
<p>In turning to Mr. Silverman, a partner at Fried, Frank,
Harris, Shriver & Jacobson, Judge Lifland is bringing in one
of the chief architects of the reorganization plan that
allowed Manville to emerge from bankruptcy proceedings in
1986.</p>
<p>Mr. Silverman, who represented future personal-injury
claimants, was closely involved in deciding how the trust
would be funded.</p>

<p>FDIC WILL APPEAL reversal of $6.5 million verdict in
bankers' bonds case.</p>
<p>The case involved a dispute over a bond covering C.H.
Butcher Jr., former chairman of United Southern Bank of
Nashville, Tenn. The ruling has broad implications for claims
against officers and directors of failed banks. Bankers'
bonds are a form of insurance against fraud or other misdeeds
by officers and directors.</p>
<p>"I think it {the ruling} has the potential to be read
beyond the facts of this case," said Mark I. Rosen, deputy
general counsel for litigation at the Federal Deposit
Insurance Corp.</p>
<p>In this instance, Mr. Butcher and other bank employees
were covered under a bankers' blanket bond issued by Aetna
Casualty & Surety Co., a unit of Aetna Life & Casualty Co.
Under the terms of the bond's provisions, coverage would be
canceled "immediately upon the taking over of the insured
{bank} by a receiver or other liquidator or by state or
federal officials." Coverage could be extended under some
circumstances, but the bond denied state and federal agencies
the right to extend the coverage. The provisions are common
to most bankers' bonds.</p>
<p>Aetna cited the provisions when it rebuffed the FDIC's
request to purchase bond coverage after the bank failed. When
Aetna rejected the FDIC's claims for losses on five
fraudulent loans arranged by Mr. Butcher, the FDIC sued to
collect under the bond.</p>
<p>During the trial last year, a judge ruled that Aetna
couldn't use as evidence the provisions of its bond involving
renewal and cancellation by a federal agency. The judge said
the provisions were void because they were "contrary to
public policy."</p>
<p>The jury awarded the FDIC $3 million under the bonds and
$3.5 million in punitive damages. It ruled that Aetna had
acted in bad faith in failing to extend the bond coverage.</p>
<p>Aetna, represented by the Washington, D.C., office of
Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher, appealed, and late last month, a
panel of the Sixth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals reversed the
verdict and ordered the suit against Aetna dismissed. The
appellate panel took exception to the trial judge's exclusion
of the bond provisions. "The dominant public policy exposed
by this review is that the parties' freedom of contract must
not be disturbed," the panel wrote.</p>
<p>Last week the FDIC filed notice that it will seek a
rehearing by the panel, saying that "this reversal presents
several issues of exceptional importance, including an
adverse impact on the stability of the national banking
system and the FDIC's insurance fund."</p>

<p>PUBLISHING MILLIONAIRE is sentenced for failing to
