	<p class="article-leader">HAMPTON, N.H. -- Henley Group Inc. said it modified its
plan to reorganize and spin off its two largest operating
units as separate companies.
   Henley said it decided to distribute 35% of the shares of
Pneumo Abex Corp., an aerospace parts company, instead of
100% as originally proposed. It said the planned distribution
of all of the shares of Fisher International Inc., formerly
Fisher Scientific Group Inc., a laboratory equipment maker,
won't be affected.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The revisions are designed to benefit Henley shareholders
by simplifying the financing arrangements in the
reorganization plan, the company said.</p>
<p>Henley, spun off from Allied-Signal Corp. four years ago
with 35 different businesses that didn't fit in Allied's
plans, has been reorganizing and spinning off companies in an
effort to increase shareholder value.</p>
<p>After the distributions, Henley would continue to hold a
company that makes brakes, a methanol plant in Chile, 14.7
million shares of Itel Corp., and certain other investments.
The company said it expects to liquidate or dispose of those
assets during 1991.</p>

<p>Corrections & Amplifications</p>
<p>HENLEY GROUP Inc.'s Pneumo Abex Corp. subsidiary will
continue to own its brakes division after Henley distributes
35% of Pneumo Abex to shareholders. Henley, which dropped an
earlier plan to spin off 100% of Pneumo Abex to shareholders,
would have purchased the brakes division from Pneumo Abex
under the earlier plan, Henley said, clarifying a story in
yesterday's edition.</p>
