	<p class="article-leader">PARIS -- Lafarge Coppee S.A., the world's second-largest
cement company, said it reached an investment and cooperation
agreement with East Germany's largest cement concern,
Karsdorf.
   Under the agreement, France's Lafarge said it will help
modernize Karsdorf's factory and, if approved by the East
German government, take a "significant" stake in the company.
Lafarge didn't say how large the stake would be.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The announcement marks one of the first significant French
investments in East Germany.</p>
<p>East German officials have announced a series of joint
ventures involving West German interests, and have expressed
disappointment that French concerns weren't more active in
East Germany.</p>
<p>Lafarge said Karsdorf is located near Leipzig and produced
roughly one-third of East Germany's 1989 cement output of 12
million metric tons.</p>
<p>Lafarge said its own annual cement production capacity is
50 million metric tons, located primarily in France, Spain
and North America. A metric ton is 2,204.62 pounds.</p>
