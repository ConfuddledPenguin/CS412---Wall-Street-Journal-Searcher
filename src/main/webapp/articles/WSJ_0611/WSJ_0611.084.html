	<p class="article-leader">DEARBORN, Mich. -- The Michigan Court of Appeals granted a
stay Friday of an earlier state regulatory order blocking CMS
Energy Corp. from completing the sale and leaseback of
Midland Cogeneration Venture assets.
   The ruling was the final hurdle for the transaction, which
is scheduled to close June 15. State utility regulators had
been trying to stop the sale and leaseback, saying that
unregulated CMS Energy was trying to move assets from its
regulated Consumers Power Co. utility unit.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>But while the court allowed the deal to take place, it
also required Consumers Power to post a $450 million bond to
cover possible customer refunds.</p>
<p>The Michigan Public Service Commission ordered the posting
of the bond because it questioned whether CMS corporate
restructuring and asset transfers violated a special 1985
order that allowed the utility higher rates to stave off
financial collapse. CMS officials previously said they
wouldn't post the bond, but a company spokesman said that
position has been changed to permit the sale and leaseback to
go through.</p>
<p>The appeals court also decided not to immediately take up
the question about the state commission's jurisdiction in
restricting the transfer or use of CMS interests in the
cogeneration venture. CMS said the court said it will handle
that issue "under normal appellate procedures."</p>
