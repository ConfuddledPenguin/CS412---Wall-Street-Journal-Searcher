	<p class="article-leader">KOKOMO, Ind. -- The two businesses that make up General
Motors Corp.'s GM Hughes Electronics Corp. division said they
expect revenue will reach a combined $11.8 billion, up from
$11.4 billion a year ago.
   The Hughes Aircraft Co. unit said it expects 1990 revenue
to rise to about $7.5 billion from $7.4 billion a year
earlier, while GM's Delco Electronics unit projected its
revenues will reach $4.3 billion, up from $4 billion in 1989.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Hughes Aircraft President D. Kenneth Richardson said that
Hughes was projecting sales of $10 billion "in a few years."</p>
<p>"In order to do so, we plan to maintain our position in
the military market, but grow rapidly in other areas," Mr.
Richardson said. "We expect the ratio of military to
non-military will change from the present 75% to 25%, to
become 60% to 40%."</p>
<p>Donald J. Almquist, chairman, president and chief
executive officer of Delco Electronics, said the unit's
long-range business plan calls for sales of more than $6
billion in 1995.</p>
<p>Although GM car sales have been dropping in recent years,
Mr. Almquist said Delco Electronics sales have been rising
"because of the rapidly increasing electronic content in
motor vehicles and because of increasing sales to non-GM
customers."</p>
<p>Today the average electronic content per GM North American
vehicle is about $650. Mr. Almquist said that average could
reach $1,500 by 1995.</p>
<p>Officials from the two GM Hughes operations made their
projections during a media tour of Delco Electronics'
facilities. Delco also announced it formed a research and
development program to work on vehicle communications systems
with a unit of Hughes Aircraft. Delco said it expects the
first products from the new program to be cellular-based
equipment being developed with Motorola Inc.</p>
