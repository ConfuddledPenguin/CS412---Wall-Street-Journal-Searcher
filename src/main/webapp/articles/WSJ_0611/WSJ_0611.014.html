	<p class="article-leader">TOKYO -- Vincent van Gogh, a century ago, was obsessed
with Japan. He used Japanese motifs. He even gave himself
Japanese eyes in self-portraits.
   Today, Japan is obsessed with van Gogh. As the world
knows, his "Portrait of Dr. Gachet" is about to land on these
shores, purchased by a Japanese paper-company tycoon for a
record $82.5 million. Van Gogh's "Sunflowers" already hangs
in the skyscraper headquarters of a Tokyo insurance company,
which bought it in 1987 for $39.9 million -- a lot of money
at the time.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Hardly a painting by the Dutch master goes to auction that
Japanese collectors don't try to lay their hands on, at any
price. Japanese buyers have a similarly fevered interest in
nearly all the big names in Western art, particularly late
19th-century French impressionists.</p>
<p>Compare the spending frenzy with the measured interest and
the relatively modest sums Japanese buyers are willing to put
out for the best of Japanese art. At a major auction of
Japanese pieces held at Christie's in New York about two
months ago, the top price paid for a matched pair of
17th-century painted screens, a classic art form, was $1.76
million. That isn't peanuts, and Japanese buyers were the
most enthusiastic bidders, but the action was hardly in van
Gogh's league.</p>
<p>Japanese, with their penchant for things Western, have the
money to buy what they want, be it Levi's jeans, Rockefeller
Center or a Renoir masterpiece. With art, there is also
opportunity to buy into Western values.</p>
<p>Yuko Kikuchi, a spokeswoman for C Two-Network Co., a Tokyo
food purveyor, says, "Companies want to promote concepts like
freedom." Western art somehow seems to encourage such
purposes.</p>
<p>"For the Japanese, something Western has always been
associated with aspirations," says Kazuko Shiomi, president
of Sotheby's Japan Ltd. "We looked to the West to get
enlightened. It shows you are broad-minded. Japanese art is
nice, but it doesn't do the same thing."</p>
<p>Western art has snob appeal. And that, too, matters in the
land of the "nouveaux tres riches". Sotheby's exploits the
phenomenon by inviting wealthy Japanese to sit in its private
balcony at New York auctions, where elegant patrons bid up
the most expensive stuff.</p>
<p>Picassos, Chagalls, Renoirs, van Goghs and Monets go for
the highest sums, dealers say, because they are names
Japanese buyers learned in school. (Western buyers are
similarly impressionable, one dealer suggests.)</p>
<p>Issei Fujiwara, a hustling, shaggy-haired iconoclast, has
lately been trying to broaden collectors' tastes by making
contemporary American art more desirable to the Japanese. In
1987, he and Ikkan Sanada, a young art consultant in New
York, took the owners of 15 companies on an art tour of the
U.S., introducing them to contemporary pieces and trying to
interest them in spending money.</p>
<p>After the trip, real-estate developer Murimasa Okawa paid
$2.5 million for a Willem de Kooning painting. Since then, he
has spent millions more. His sunny, multistory home in the
heart of Tokyo's Shibuya district is accented with bright
works by Roy Lichtenstein, Hans Hofmann and Sam Francis.</p>
<p>"I could feel the energy and power that contemporary art
had," the 49-year-old Mr. Okawa says. "Impressionist art does
not have that. And Japanese art is like eggplants that are
cut and spread on the table. Not fresh."</p>
<p>Contemporary Japanese art, on the other hand, is so hard
to sell that most popular galleries don't show it, thus
forcing artists to rent their own space. "Critics always say
Japanese art has a long way to go to catch up with Western
standards," Ikuo Hirayama, the dean of a Tokyo art school,
recently told a magazine.</p>
<p>The major buyers of traditional Japanese art exhibit pride
in their heritage, not just love of art. Tea-ceremony
utensils, screens and scroll-paintings all have a following.
Art from feudal Japan is collected, especially by museums.</p>
<p>Indeed, Japanese buyers today also are pushing prices of
Japanese art higher, but it is a "completely different
market," says Michael Dunn, a private dealer in Tokyo. Adds
Hiroyuki Satoh, who works at Kobayashi Gallery Co., the Ginza
gallery that bought "Portrait of Dr. Gachet" at auction for
Ryoei Saito, the paper mogul: "The method of expression in
Japanese and Western art is quite different, and so is the
market."</p>
<p>Even the oddly reversed roles of Messrs. Dunn and Satoh
suggest the state of the art market: The Englishman, Mr.
Dunn, is a major dealer in Japanese art, while the Japanese,
Mr. Satoh, specializes in Western pieces.</p>
<p>Big Japanese companies, including Bridgestone Corp. and
Sanyo Securities Co., decorate their buildings and
company-sponsored museums with Picassos, Chagalls and
Renoirs. The brewer Suntory Ltd. recently spent $10 million
on 3,800 posters by the English artist Phillip Granville --
this after mainly collecting Japanese glasswork and pottery
for 30 years. But stop in at Salomon Brothers Asia Ltd., or
Deutsche Bank AG's Tokyo office, or even the U.S. Embassy,
and you will see a profusion of Japanese antiques or works of
modern, often obscure, Japanese artists. To each his own.</p>
<p>The Western fascination with Japanese art began with
19th-century artists, not only van Gogh but Claude Monet.
Both studied Japanese prints and found inspiration for their
own works in Japanese style. They employed similar colors and
compositions -- and gave their subjects a Japanese look.</p>
<p>Some art scholars conjecture that the affinity
impressionists had with Japan is what makes Japanese
collectors partial to the impressionists. (Oddly, the prints
the impressionists loved -- "ukiyo-e", or paintings of the
pleasure districts of old Japan -- weren't considered art at
the time by the upper class. Now, however, rich Japanese are
clamoring for paintings inspired by what their ancestors
repudiated.)</p>
<p>Masahiro Takano, the owner of a Tokyo taxi company, has
the world's largest collection of paintings by the French
artist Marie Laurencin, a contemporary of Picasso's whose
simple pastels remind him of Japanese prints. Perhaps, he
says, that's because "she used Japanese as models."</p>
<p>If the bottom ever drops out of the market for
impressionists, some think, Japanese might begin to lavish
huge sums on things familiar. There are historical precedents
for that. When Japan was isolated from the world in the early
17th century, lords would sometimes swap big tracts of land
for a single, rare tea-ceremony bowl. Come to think of it,
that isn't so different from dropping $82 million and change
on an old van Gogh.</p>
