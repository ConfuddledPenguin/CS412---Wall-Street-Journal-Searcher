	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- Move over M.C. Hammer and you other rappers.
Here comes Rep. Major R. Owens, and he's Baaad.
   Rep. Owens, a liberal Democrat from New York and a former
Brooklyn librarian, has been moved to use "the language and
the attitude of a street constituent" to put the government's
fiscal vice to verse in rap poems.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>In a poem entitled "The Budget Summit," he likens the
talks between the White House and congressional leaders to "a
meeting of the mob," where aid for the poor and children is
likely to get whacked in order to cut the deficit.</p>
<p>At the big white D.C. mansion</p>
<p>There's a meeting of the mob</p>
<p>And the question on the table</p>
<p>Is which beggars will they rob.</p>
<p>There's a meeting of the mob</p>
<p>Now we'll never get a job,</p>
<p>All the gents will make a deal</p>
<p>And the poor have no appeal.</p>
<p>The thrift bailout is a recurring theme for rapmaster
Owens. One ditty called "The S and L Riot" paints a biting
vision of thrift executives invited by former President
Reagan to loot the Treasury:</p>
<p>When our mint is picked clean</p>
<p>Hear these haughty hogs all scream</p>
<p>That there's no free lunch]</p>
<p>Only this plump bunch</p>
<p>Deserves a national free lunch.</p>
<p>While the rhymes may be stilted, and the rhythm a bit
unsteady, the message is always clear. "I feel the
frustration after seven years in a Congress where no funds
can be found for job creation or education to benefit my
constituents," Rep. Owens says. "I sit there unable to do
anything about it, and one way to relieve my anxiety is to
start writing."</p>
<p>Rep. Owens isn't the only federal official to dabble in
creative writing about fiscal matters. White House Budget
Director Richard Darman has written floridly of Cookie
Monsters and hidden Pacmen lurking within the budget. But
while Mr. Darman is at the center of the budget summit with
House and Senate leaders, Rep. Owens can only wish that there
were a place for him and his would-be street poetry at the
negotiating table.</p>
<p>The lawmaker says he'd have a lot to say. If they got
around to cutting social benefits, he might start with:</p>
<p>This rape is obscene</p>
<p>These gents are real mean</p>
<p>Keep your children inside</p>
<p>Teach them true national pride.</p>
<p>There's a riot at the mint]</p>
