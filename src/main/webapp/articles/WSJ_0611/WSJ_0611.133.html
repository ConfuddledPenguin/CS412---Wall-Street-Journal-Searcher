	<p class="article-leader">MILLBRAE, Calif. -- Genentech Inc. said its shareholders
overwhelmingly approved the company's plan to allow Roche
Holding Ltd. to acquire 60% of Genentech's stock, paving the
way for foreign control of the company that pioneered
biotechnology.
   Genentech said shareholders at its annual meeting voted
97% in favor of the agreement with Roche of Switzerland. The
agreement calls for Roche to pay $2.1 billion for a 60%
Genentech stake, and gives Roche an option to acquire the
remaining interest for as much as $2.5 billion more.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Under the agreement, Roche will invest about $492 million
in capital in Genentech, and pay stockholders $36 plus one
share of a new common stock for every two Genentech shares.
Despite shareholder suits seeking to block the merger, few
expected stockholders to veto the transaction.</p>
<p>The acquisition's completion is important to Genentech
because it provides money to finance its diverse
drug-development program without worrying about Wall Street's
reaction to quarterly earnings.</p>
<p>The transaction, announced in February, must still be
approved by the Federal Trade Commission, which last March
requested additional information on the proposed merger. The
companies say they are working to satisfy the request.</p>
