	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Western Union Corp. issued 9.6 million of its
common shares to its bank lenders to cover terms of its
December 1987 financial restructuring program.
   Under that plan, which retired $227 million in bank debt,
Western Union agreed to issue additional common to its 31
banks if its stock price fell below $2.05625 at Dec. 31,
1989.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>In composite trading Friday on the New York Stock
Exchange, Western Union shares closed unchanged at 50 cents.</p>
<p>The arrangement with the banks is similar to one that
Western Union had with ITT Corp. Last month, Western Union
issued an additional 7.8 million, or 9.02%, of its common
shares to ITT under terms of its December 1987 agreement to
buy ITT World Communications Inc. The agreement with ITT also
carried the same $2.05625 trigger.</p>
<p>The new issue gave ITT 16.58% of Western Union's common,
making it the second-largest owner next to New York financier
Bennett S. LeBow, who owns 43.4%. By contrast, the block held
by the banks is widely dispersed and difficult to count,
according to a Western Union spokesman, who added that he
wasn't sure how much of the company's stock banks currently
hold.</p>
<p>Western Union plans to distribute the additional stock
from a pool of 17.39 million new common shares that it
registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission
Friday.</p>
<p>The company spokesman said ITT will receive 7.8 million of
the registered shares since it had originally taken its new
stock in the form of so-called legend shares, which guarantee
ownership but cannot be traded. Those 7.8 million legend
shares now will convert to registered shares, he said.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Western Union, which has been struggling to
avoid a filing under bankruptcy laws, faces a big hurdle this
Friday when it must pay $51 million of interest on its senior
notes. Western Union has said it may be forced to default on
the payment if it can't find sufficient funds to cover it.
Annual interest payments at the company total $116 million.</p>
<p>To ease its debt burden, Western Union has proposed a
plan, now awaiting SEC clearance, that would give new debt
securities to its bondholders and reclassify its preferred
stock into new common shares in exchange for more favorable
terms on the $530 million debt from its notes.</p>
<p>The spokesman said so far there has been no progress on
the exchange offer either from the SEC or bondholders.</p>
