	<p class="article-leader">A federal judge in San Francisco denied a request by
Nintendo of America Inc. for a temporary restraining order
that would have kept Lewis Galoob Toys Inc. from selling a
video-game device.
   Nintendo sought to stop Galoob from distributing its "Game
Genie," a gadget that makes Nintendo games easier to play.
Nintendo of America, a unit of Japan's Nintendo Co., filed a
lawsuit against the South San Francisco company June 1,
alleging that the Game Genie lets consumers infringe on
Nintendo copyrights by altering Nintendo games.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>In addition to filing for the temporary restraining order,
Nintendo had sought an injunction. While denying the request
for the restraining order, the judge scheduled a formal
hearing for June 29 on Nintendo's request for a preliminary
injunction.</p>
<p>"We believe very strongly that we don't infringe on
anyone's rights," said Steven Klein, Galoob executive vice
president.</p>
<p>Lynn Hvalsoe, Nintendo general counsel said the company
achieved its objectives. "We went to court to get a hearing
date . . . and we got it."</p>
