	<p class="article-leader">American Airlines, in a blow to archrival United Airlines,
won a government recommendation to fly a coveted route to
Tokyo from Chicago, the base of United's operations.
   Acquisition of the nonstop route, pending approval by
several Transportation Department officials, would be a big
revenue generator for American, a unit of AMR Corp. United, a
unit of UAL Corp, had projected it would gain $300 million in
revenue annually from the route.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The route would bolster American's bumpy campaign to build
a world-wide route system. It also would boost American's
business at Chicago's O'Hare International Airport, the
country's busiest airport, where American has been trying to
erode United's dominant position.</p>
<p>The Chicago-Tokyo route is one of six to be parceled out
by the Transportation Department. The Department, under a
pact with Japan, is to grant passenger and cargo flying
rights between six U.S. cities and Japan, with three serving
Tokyo, and the remainder other cities. Along with the
Tokyo-Chicago route, American won recommendation for a
proposed route between Tokyo and San Jose, Calif. Delta Air
Lines also won two recommendations, with America West
Airlines and Hawaiian Airlines getting the remaining two.</p>
<p>Thomas Mahoney, public counsel at the Transportation
Department, made the recommendations late Friday, naming
first and second choices for six proposed routes. The contest
for the routes is considered the biggest in at least a
decade.</p>
<p>Mr. Mahoney recommended that United, which has waged a
tough lobbying campaign, only get dibs on the Chicago-Tokyo
route if American turns it down. Called "backup authority,"
that is little consolation because second-choice carriers
rarely take over a route.</p>
<p>But a spokesman at United said: "This is a very early
stage of the proceeding. The case is far from over."</p>
<p>William Kutzke, a consultant in Washington who compared
the competition for the routes to the Indianapolis 500, said:
"You can win from the back of the pack, but it's not likely."</p>
<p>An American spokesman said officials weren't prepared to
comment over the weekend.</p>
<p>Final approval isn't expected until late this year. In
early August, John J. Mathias, chief administrative law judge
at the Transportation Department, is slated to make separate
recommendations, in effect using Mr. Mahoney's
recommendations as a guide. Mr. Mathias's choices in turn
will be reviewed by two senior department officials and the
White House.</p>
<p>If American opts not to fly the route between Tokyo and
San Jose, where the carrier has built a hub of operations,
Mr. Mahoney recommended Delta Air Lines for a route between
Honolulu and Tokyo.</p>
<p>Mr. Mahoney recommended Delta for a route to Tokyo from
Los Angeles, a huge focal point for overseas travel. American
was recommended as a backup. Delta also was recommended for
service between Portland, Ore., and Nagoya. The backup is
Continental Airlines for Seattle-Nagoya flights. Hawaiian
Airlines was picked for Honolulu-Fukuoka flights; Continental
also is the backup, with a Los Angeles-Nagoya route; America
West was recommended for Honolulu-Nagoya, again with
Continental as a backup.</p>
