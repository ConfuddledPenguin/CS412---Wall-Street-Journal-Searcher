	<p class="article-leader">PITTSBURGH (AP) -- The chairman of USAir Group Inc. said
the nation's seventh-largest airline will postpone delivery
of a dozen new aircraft for more than three years because of
sluggish business.
   Edwin I. Colodny, chairman, said the airline would delay
delivery of the Boeing Co. planes from 1991-92 to 1995.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>USAir spokesman John Bronson confirmed the statement and
said the planes involved are all Boeing 737s.</p>
<p>Mr. Bronson said the proposal to defer delivery until 1995
was included in Mr. Colodny's recent letter to all USAir
employees.</p>
<p>In exchange for delaying the deliveries, USAir agreed to
buy 24 more planes from the manufacturer and purchase options
on 56 more aircraft after 1995, Mr. Colodny said.</p>
<p>USAir has one of the airline industry's younger fleets and
will delay retiring some planes, Mr. Colodny said.</p>
<p>USAir had a loss of $76 million in 1989 after 13
consecutive profitable years; it posted a $38 million loss
for 1990's first quarter.</p>
<p>In last year's annual report, the company said it had
commitments to buy five Boeing 767s before 1992 and 55 Boeing
737s before 1993.</p>
<p>Projected spending on new planes was $882 million this
year, $767 million in 1991 and $264 million in 1992, the
report said.</p>
