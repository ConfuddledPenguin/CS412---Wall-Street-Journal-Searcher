	<p class="article-leader">LISBON -- The government unveiled plans to slash the
public deficit and lower inflation, in a bid to prevent
Portugal from falling behind as the European Community drives
toward economic and monetary union.
   Finance Minister Miguel Beleza said the economic
adjustment plan would cut public-sector spending and widen
the indirect tax net. Some indirect tax rates may be raised,
he said.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Economists have warned that Portugal's large public-sector
deficit has overheated the economy, boosting inflation and
damaging Portugal's chances of meeting EC deadlines for
monetary integration. The government forecasts the 1990
deficit will reach about 610 billion escudos ($4.09 billion).
Inflation in April was running at an annual rate of 12.9%,
about double the EC average.</p>
<p>Mr. Beleza said the adjustment program will aim to halve
the public-sector deficit in five years to 3.5% of gross
domestic product. Inflation will fall to well below 5% by
1995, he said.</p>
<p>Portugal must fully participate in EC plans for economic
and monetary union, to influence the shape of the 12-nation
trade block, he said.</p>
<p>He restated Portugal's commitment to place the escudo in
the exchange-rate mechanism of the EC's European Monetary
System soon, but insisted the adhesion would have to be
handled cautiously. The exchange-rate mechanism fixes nine EC
currencies at a set rate against the European currency unit,
and permits them to fluctuate within fixed limits on either
side of that rate. Portugal, Greece and Britain are the only
EC nations outside the mechanism.</p>
