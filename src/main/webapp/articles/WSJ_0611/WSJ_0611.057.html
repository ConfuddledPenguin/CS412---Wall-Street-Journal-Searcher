	<p class="article-leader">BEVERLY HILLS, Calif. -- Salick Health Care Inc. said it
bought back $2,573,000 principal amount of its 7.25%
convertible subordinated debentures, due 2001, for about
$1.61 million.
   The company, which provides cancer and dialysis treatment,
said it purchased the bonds in a private transaction, because
it believes the market undervalues the company.</p>
