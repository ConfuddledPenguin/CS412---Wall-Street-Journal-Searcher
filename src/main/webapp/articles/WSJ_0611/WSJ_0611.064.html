	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Junk-bond indexes are proliferating on Wall
Street these days.
   Securities firms, vying for the junk-bond mantle formerly
worn by Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc., are eager to see their
names on a widely quoted junk bond index. And so three
different junk bond indexes are being promoted by Merrill
Lynch & Co., First Boston Corp. and Salomon Brothers Inc.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>In recent months the broad junk-bond indexes have shown
signs of strength for the first time in more than a year. But
before taking the leap into junk bonds, take note: Even the
analysts who compile the indexes warn that the broad averages
can be highly misleading.</p>
<p>To start with, the three indexes don't even agree on how
well the junk market is doing. Though all three show junk
bonds posted solid gains in May, the returns they show for
the first five months of the year vary.</p>
<p>While Salomon's index of 472 junk bonds posted a negative
total return of 1.04% for the five months, First Boston's
index of 349 junk bonds showed a negative 0.13%, and Merrill
Lynch's measure of 735 junk bonds reported a total return of
0.20%. Total return measures price changes plus interest
income.</p>
<p>The disparities -- which reflect the indexes' differences
in composition and sample size -- highlight the difficulties
that investors face when trying to determine how the $200
billion junk bond market is faring. It's an issue that is
getting more attention as investors try to figure out whether
the time is right to venture into that battered market.</p>
<p>"The average return is a less meaningful number in the
high-yield market" than in other sectors of the bond market,
said Thomas Doyle, an analyst at Salomon Brothers.</p>
<p>Like many other analysts, he says investors should look at
one small group of junk bonds at a time, considering such
factors as the credit rating, industry group, size of issue,
type of payment (cash, deferred payment or payment in
kind-interest in the form of additional securities) and even
whether the junk bonds were issued as part of a leveraged
buy-out.</p>
<p>Looking at them in this way brings out some extraordinary
differences. First Boston said its index of information
technology companies' junk bonds showed a total return of
9.5% for January through May, while junk bonds issued by
health care companies posted average returns of a negative
13.1%.</p>
<p>Sam DeRosa-Farag, an analyst at First Boston, said that
firm can "slice the market into 200 different subsets."</p>
<p>The broader junk indexes differ largely because each one
is constructed differently. The Merrill Lynch and Salomon
Brothers indexes remove bonds that have defaulted on interest
payments. As a result, these indexes receive a lot of
criticism from money managers, who can't easily purge bad
bonds from their own portfolios. "The indexes that eliminate
busted deals tend to overstate performance," said Thomas
Madden, high-yield portfolio manager at Federated Investors
Corp.</p>
<p>Merrill and Salomon also exclude noncash-paying bonds,
which are highly volatile. This omission understates overall
market performance when prices are rising and distorts losses
when the market is falling. For example, Salomon's
zero-coupon component, which is not part of the overall
index, rose 5.35% in May while the broad market index rose
2.63%. But in the past 12 months, when the market was mostly
falling, the zero-coupon component fell 15.72% while the
broad market index fell 2.84%. Zero-coupon bonds, instead of
paying interest, are sold at a deep discount, with the
investor collecting the full face amount when the bond
matures.</p>
<p>Of the three indexes produced by the brokerage firms, many
money managers say they like First Boston's the best, because
it includes some of everything.</p>
<p>Dan Baldwin, a high-yield investment manager at Chancellor
Capital, said he pays a little more attention to statistics
provided by Lipper Analytical Services Inc. that measure the
portfolio performance of other money managers than he does to
the brokerage firms' indexes.</p>
<p>This way, Mr. Baldwin said, he's competing against other
"people who are forced to make decisions," rather than "a
theoretical portfolio." The Lipper numbers, he said,
represent "the real world."</p>
<p>Another measure often used to appraise the relative value
of junk bonds, the yield spread, also falls short when used
as a barometer of the market's health. This compares yields
on a given security with those on a U.S. Treasury security
that has the same or a similar maturity. Because U.S.
government notes and bonds are considered the safest
securities of all, other fixed-income securities are priced
at yields that are higher than Treasurys to reflect their
higher risk.</p>
<p>When yields on corporate or mortgage-backed bonds, or
taxable equivalent yields on tax-exempt municipal bonds, move
closer to yields on Treasury bonds, they are considered
expensive relative to Treasurys. When yields on these other
bonds are farther from yields on Treasurys, the other bonds
are said to be cheap. Yields on bonds move in the opposite
direction from their price.</p>
<p>By this measure, the junk bond market is holding a fire
sale. According to Merrill Lynch, the spread between junk
bonds and Treasurys widened from 4.6 percentage points in
March 1989 to 10.2 percentage points in March 1990.</p>
<p>In a recent Merrill Lynch report, high-yield research
director Martin Fridson and analyst Scott L. Thomas compiled
a list of 118 of the largest non-defaulted junk bond issues
and found that on March 30, 1990, the average yield was
18.83%, or 10.19 percentage points higher than the yield on
the 10-year Treasury note. But within the group, they found,
only eight of the 118 issues actually had yields within one
percentage point of the average in either direction. They
concluded that the concept of an average yield was "highly
misleading," as 93% of the issues were "nowhere close" to
this average.</p>
<p>There also are numerous technical problems related to
pricing. Unlike the stock market, where there are central
processing systems that verify prices, the bond market is a
market in which each brokerage firm sets its own prices.</p>
<p>Moreover, the market is so fragmented and illiquid that
most dealers don't even trade 200 different bonds in a day,
out of the 3,000 or so junk bonds that are out there. That
means the folks who produce the indexes often must rely on
price data gathered from so-called street brokers, which
raises questions about the reliability of the quotes.</p>
<p>And because junk bonds don't always move in sync with each
other, there is no such thing as an average bond that can be
used as a benchmark. Instead, "there are a couple of hundred
in the high-yield market" that could be used as benchmarks
for segments of the market, said Joseph Bencivenga, managing
director of high-yield research at Salomon Brothers who once
held a similar post at Drexel Burnham Lambert.</p>
<p>Despite these problems, investors and money managers
insist on measuring performance whether or not perfect
indexes exist. That has led a number of investment firms to
scramble to beef up their research abilities to try to
attract new customers.</p>
<p>Mr. Bencivenga said Salomon is revising its high-yield
index and is considering adding a lot more bonds including
zero-coupon issues, defaulted bonds and securities that have
resettable interest rates.</p>
<p>This year, Salomon purchased a computer junk bond database
and software system from Drexel, which put the system up for
sale after it filed for bankruptcy-court protection. The
database has names, contacts and trading histories of about
3,000 issues. Salomon also is working on a new "flash" junk
bond index to measure the market's daily performance and
plans to soon begin compiling a daily list of the market's
best and worst performers.</p>

<p>Friday's Market Activity
</p>
<p>Treasury bond prices ended unchanged to 1/8 point lower,
or down $1.25 or less for each $1,000 face amount, after
drifting in quiet trading.</p>
<p>The benchmark 30-year bond was quoted late in the day at a
price of 103 9/32 to yield 8.44%, compared with 103 14/32 to
yield 8.42% Thursday. Short-term rates were little changed.</p>
<p>Bond dealers said investors continued to mark time ahead
of this week's deluge of economic statistics, starting with
Wednesday's release of May retail sales data. Also in
prospect are Thursday's report on last month's producer
prices and Friday's report on the May consumer price index.</p>
<p>In the corporate market, junk bond prices followed the
stock market lower. Most junk bonds, which are
speculative-grade securities with low credit ratings or no
credit ratings at all, ended about 1/4 point lower.</p>
<p>Traders said the nearly 35-point drop in the Dow Jones
Industrial Average prompted some high-yield investors to sell
junk bonds short, in effect making a bet that their prices
would decline.</p>
<p>Among the issues that finished lower were RJR Nabisco Inc.
payment-in-kind securities, which pay interest in the form of
additional securities. RJR's 14.07% convertible PIK
debentures due in 2009 finished one point lower at 83 on the
New York Stock Exchange.</p>
<p>The other widely held RJR issue, the 14.07% exchangeable
PIK debentures maturing in 2007, ended one point lower at 69.
RJR's payment-in-kind bonds are widely held by stock
investors and tend to decline or rebound in step with major
movements on the stock market.</p>
<p>Junk bonds of Beatrice Co. jumped on news that ConAgra
Inc. agreed to buy Beatrice for $1.34 billion in cash and
stock. The company's 13.71% senior subordinated reset notes
maturing in 1997 rose 2 1/2 points to 104 1/2. Dirk van
Doren, an analyst at McCarthy Crisanti & Maffei Inc., said
the bonds rose on the perception that ConAgra is financially
stronger than Beatrice. In addition, he said, the bonds can
be called at 105 on Nov. 1, and he said ConAgra is likely to
call them because it has a significantly lower cost of funds
than Beatrice does.</p>
