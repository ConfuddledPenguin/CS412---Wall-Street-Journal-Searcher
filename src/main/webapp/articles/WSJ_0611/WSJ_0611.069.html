	<p class="article-leader">MEXICO CITY -- The investor from a U.S. bank had come to
Mexico "just to look around," he said. Did he like what he
found, I asked as we were waiting to board the plane home.
"Yes, {President Carlos} Salinas is certainly on the right
track," he answered. "He's opened the country up and pushed
through the privatization of the banks faster than anyone
dreamed possible." But, warned the banker, who claimed to
have lost an earlier investment during the 1982 devaluations
and nationalizations, "they still haven't repudiated the
original nationalization of the banks. Who's to say they
won't change back again?"
   As Mr. Salinas visits the U.S. this week to meet with
investors and legislators, the question is not whether he is
doing the right things, but whether the changes will last.
The revolutionary, market-oriented changes being whisked
through Congress are overwhelmingly popular, both here and
abroad. Even leftist Mexican Sen. Porfirio Munoz Ledo has
recently endorsed, in principle, the most politically thorny
of the open-market policies: a free-trade agreement with the
U.S. and Canada.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>But the same swiftness and firmness with which Mr. Salinas
has turned around years of protectionist, state planning has
highlighted a weakness in Mexico's political structure that
eventually could derail the economic progress: As Mr. Salinas
and his policies gain in popularity, the political system
that grants him power to make such dramatic changes is less
popular than ever. And that doesn't do much to assure wary
investors that "guarantees" made today will not be rescinded
tomorrow.</p>
<p>In private, leaders of the ruling Institutional
Revolutionary Party (PRI) say a complete renunciation of the
past is impossible. As explanation, one is reminded that 35
of the Mexican congressmen who have approved Mr. Salinas's
plans to privatize the banks had, just eight years earlier,
heartily endorsed then-President Jose Lopez Portillo's
nationalization. It is exactly this type of blind allegiance
to the executive that worries investors.</p>
<p>Guillermo Ortiz, deputy secretary of the Finance Ministry
in charge of the bank privatization, insists that repudiation
of past mistakes is not necessary to draw investors to
Mexico. "The bank privatization is not an isolated move; it's
part of a whole change of policy," he says. Mr. Ortiz
emphasizes that, "the actual privatization is probably going
to be less significant than the process of deregulation of
the banks that started two years ago."</p>
<p>Indeed, perceived political weaknesses should in no way
diminish Mexico's recent economic successes and its even
greater growth potential. One of the more optimistic
projections is found in a report to be issued July 2 by
Polyconomics, a New Jersey consulting firm with an office in
Mexico: "In terms of size, population, resources, and overall
economic scope, Mexico should be much more than the next
South Korea: by the year 2000, it should be one of the
world's economic powers."</p>
<p>Among the report's many recommendations for continued
growth and development are a further lowering and
simplification of tax rates, a complete overhaul of the
disasterously inefficient state-controlled farming structure
and a further deregulation of Mexico's emerging equity market
(estimated at about 10% of gross national product).</p>
<p>On this latter point, Mr. Ortiz says his office has taken
the first steps toward opening an over-the-counter market for
companies currently not big enough to qualify for capital in
the equity market. "As the public gains an ever greater
access to information {about companies} in Mexico, we will be
able to cut back on the regulations designed to protect the
public," Mr. Ortiz says. "We even have private rating firms
now. So, eventually you won't have to have a bank guarantee a
new issue."</p>
<p>However fast capital market deregulation is introduced, it
would be hard to match the runaway success of Mexico's
supply-side tax cuts. Even so, the government seems
unnecessarily wary of pushing rate reductions much further.
"Yes, we have collected more revenue from lower rates," says
Francisco Gil Diaz, deputy minister of finance for taxation,
"but I think it's too early to call it a supply-side
phenomenon."</p>
<p>Tax revenues, as a percentage of GNP, increased to 10.5%
last year from 9.7% in 1988, according to Bank of Mexico
figures. One of the biggest jumps came in the revenue from
income tax -- this during a period when the top personal rate
fell to 35% from 40% and the corporate rate fell to 35% from
42%. Revenue from import taxes also grew significantly, again
because of dramatic cuts in import taxes and the resulting
rush of imports.</p>
<p>Still, current tax laws remain complex and arbitrarily
enforced. One financial writer tells of painstakingly filling
out myriad tax forms only to be told his accounting was
incorrect when he presented it to the tax authorities at one
of the two banks that accept tax receipts. He rechecked his
figures and resubmitted his form to the other bank. There,
his tax forms and payment were accepted.</p>
<p>Complicated inflation-accounting procedures for tax
computation are beyond the capacities of many of the small
businesses the government hopes to lure back into the formal
economy with reduced rates and better enforcement. A recent
article in El Financiero, a financial daily, told of a
lottery-ticket saleswoman who broke into tears at a bank
because she was unable to fill out a tax form. Mr. Gil Diaz
is unmoved. "Tax laws in Mexico are not too complicated," he
contends. "We hope to do away with inflation accounting by
eliminating inflation."</p>
<p>Although slow to embrace the success of its tax-rate
reductions, at least the government has rejected the
recessionary "shock" formula urged on it by several of the
multilateral lending institutions that recommend higher taxes
and severe currency devaluations. Renewed confidence in the
currency is paramount in a country where purchasing power has
been eroded by close to 50% since 1983, and as Mexicans gain
access to markets and goods formerly restricted to them. The
government announced two weeks ago that it would slow down
the rate of currency devaluation by 20% (from one peso a day
to 80 centavos). This reduces the annual rate of devaluation
to 10.5% from 14%.</p>
<p>Not only is Mr. Salinas confident of increased investment
to support the value of the peso, but he is convinced that
Mexico will grow its way out of inflation through tax,
deregulation and investment incentives. So far, he seems to
be right. Inflation came down to 20% last year from a high of
200% in 1987, and GNP increased 2.9% in 1989 and 1.1% in
1988. For next year, government officials privately forecast
a 7% growth rate with 5% inflation.</p>
<p>All these changes have left the government's political
opponents in disarray. The primary problem for the National
Action Party (PAN) is that the government is doing exactly
what the PAN has been recommending for decades. Thus, the PAN
is losing an important distinction between itself and the
ruling party. Jose Angel Conchello, a PAN member of Congress,
says his party missed an opportunity with the announcement of
the bank privatization: "We knew for some time that Salinas
was planning to privatize the banks. We should have demanded
that the president immediately begin privatizing the banks
and then claimed victory after he did so. We should now be
demanding an immediate change in agricultural policy."</p>
<p>The left of the political spectrum suffers from the
problem confronting socialist parties world-wide: defense of
an ideology that has been thoroughly discredited. According
to political analyst Lorenzo Meyer, "The Mexican left has
been unable to move from an enthusiastic social movement to a
coherent political party. They may now be trying to redefine
themselves in the image of, say, a Felipe Gonzalez-type of
socialist-against corporate elitism, but in favor of open
markets." Here again, however, Mr. Salinas is one step ahead
of the competition; by subjecting Mexico's business elites to
foreign competition he has cut into any monopolistic
interests the business community had.</p>
<p>Although Mr. Salinas may not have an opposition party to
worry about, his own party is no longer the leviathan it once
was. The union movement with which the PRI had a 40-year
alliance has lost much of its power due to the emergence of
independent unions and the growth of non-unionized labor.
Charges of electoral fraud continue to haunt the party --
most recently in a local election in the state of Michoacan
two weeks ago. And as practically all restrictions have been
lifted from the Mexican press, detailed reports of corruption
among local PRI administrations have lowered the PRI's
already dismal reputation. Says Mr. Meyer: "The PRI has
become as irrelevent to what is happening in the president's
office as is the left and right. And how long can a popular
president survive as top representative of an
unrepresentative political party?"</p>
<p>In the long run, the lack of credible political parties is
going to cause some problems for the economic policies being
forged now, no matter how successful or popular they may be.
In September the PRI will hold an important party conference.
There are reports that Mr. Salinas may announce the formation
of a new party to replace the PRI. Any steps he takes to
strengthen the party process in Mexico, at a moment when he
has the political strength to do so, will be vital. That
could be the signal to investors -- both foreign and Mexican
-- that the wise reforms being made today will not be quickly
or easily reversed.</p>
