	<p class="article-leader">I object to your May 9 editorial "The Ivory Censor"
describing Wellesley College as part of the national trend
toward censorship on college campuses. Unlike Northern
Colorado University, which rescinded its invitation to Linda
Chavez to be its commencement speaker, Wellesley College did
not revoke its invitation to Barbara Bush.
   A significant minority of the college's graduating class
does not think that Mrs. Bush should have been chosen by its
classmates because her distinction is based on the success of
her husband, not on professional achievement. Nor does it
think that one of the nation's premier colleges for women
should honor someone because of her success as a wife and
mother. The majority clearly did not agree, because it picked
her. The action of the protesters is not an example of
censorship because Mrs. Bush has not been and will not be
censored.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The students were not out of bounds in expressing their
views. Had the college invited Mamie Eisenhower to address
the class of 1960 when I was graduating from Wellesley, I
would have led the protest then. The tiny and diminishing
number of institutions that still maintains standards of
excellence and achievement should honor those values at their
commencement ceremonies.</p>
<p>I admire the response of Wellesley College's
administration to the affair: The college protected the right
of the minority to express its dissent, as well as the right
of the majority to prevail. Above all, it insisted upon an
atmosphere of civility and reasoned discourse. That's the
American way.</p>

<p>There is a phenomenon that seems to be pervasive in
academic and corporate America. While professing a quest for
"cultural diversity," institutions have sought refuge in
positioning themselves as the guardians of quality and
excellence.</p>
<p>Your editorial assumes Prof. Derrick Bell's insistence
that Harvard Law School appoint a black female to its faculty
diminishes his commitment to excellence. You decry that
"merit apparently must take a back seat to race and gender."
We all would join you -- if it were true.</p>
<p>To frame the argument in those terms takes an arrogant
presumption that there are no black females who can meet and
enhance the highest standards of excellence -- and, by their
mere presence, further diversify the culture of the
institution. Both goals, excellence and cultural diversity,
are ideal, yet achievable.</p>
<p>The notion that they are mutually exclusive, thus
undesirable, was recently advanced in Allan Bloom's "The
Closing of the American Mind." By documenting and, through
association with his considerable academic credentials,
codifying this halfbaked notion, Prof. Bloom gave hordes of
conservatives air cover to denounce the goal of cultural
diversity -- and to continue their embedded doctrine of
cultural exclusion.</p>
