	<p class="article-leader">OTTAWA -- Canada's unemployment rate rose to 7.6% of the
work force in May from 7.2% in April, Statistics Canada, a
federal agency, said.
   The rise was attributed to a weakening trend in the
Canadian economy.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Manufacturing employment fell sharply in May for the third
consecutive month.</p>
<p>Statistics Canada also said its help-wanted index, an
early indicator of labor demand, fell 5.3% in May. The index
monitors changes in help-wanted advertisements in major
Canadian cities.</p>
