	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- In its bleakest report yet on the
competitiveness of the U.S. electronics industry, the
Commerce Department said Japan could surpass the U.S. in
production of electronic goods by the early 1990s.
   "Except for software and medical equipment, the U.S. has
been losing market share in all products since 1984," said
John McPhee, director of the department's office of computers
and business equipment and a co-author of the report.
Although the U.S. still leads the world with more than $180
billion in annual output of electronic goods, Japan could
spurt ahead by 1994 if the current trend continues, the
report said.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The report urges various measures to improve the U.S.
industry's health, including adoption of a permanent
research-and-development tax credit, changes in antitrust
policies, and government actions against so-called unfairly
traded imports and foreign patent violations. But the report
places most of the burden for responding to the Japanese
challenge on the private sector.</p>
<p>The report shows declines in the U.S. share of world
markets even in such fields as personal computers,
supercomputers and microprocessors, which the U.S. has long
dominated. The study also notes that practically all capacity
for fabricating silicon wafers, the basic material for
manufacturing semiconductors, is now in Japanese and European
hands.</p>
<p>Moreover, Japan outspends the U.S. in X-ray lithography,
the most promising method for printing the
multibillion-transistor memories of the future, the report
says.</p>
<p>In 1987, the latest year for which reliable global-trade
figures are available, Japan already led the world in
electronic exports with shipments valued at $38 billion. The
U.S. trailed with $35 billion in exports, followed by the
European Community with shipments of $26 billion.</p>
<p>A comparison of corporate growth rates between 1983 and
1987 shows Japanese electronic producers to be outpacing
their U.S. rivals; the Japanese companies' sales grew 27.9%,
compared with 10.8% for the U.S. companies.</p>
<p>In another indicator of how industrial strength is
shifting, three Japanese companies won more U.S. electronic
patents in 1987 than any other companies -- Canon Inc.,
Hitachi Ltd. and Toshiba Corp. General Electric Co. was next
and N.V. Philips of the Netherlands was No. 5.</p>
<p>In the past few years, the Japanese have invested heavily
in U.S. electronic capacity, partly to avoid additional
import duties imposed on their personal computers,
semiconductors and electric typewriters. Although these
Japanese-owned operations create U.S. employment, they also
contribute to the U.S. trade deficit because the value of
their imports of components exceeds that of their exports of
final products, the report said.</p>
