	<p class="article-leader">EINDHOVEN, The Netherlands -- N.V. Philips
Gloeilampenfabriek said that its Hamburg medical systems
subsidiary has formed a joint venture with two Soviet
partners to install and service Philips medical equipment in
the Soviet Union.
   Philips will work with the Moscow-based Republican
Children's Clinical Hospital and the Research and Technical
Services Cooperative Tomotek to repair and service equipment
on the spot.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Prior to the formation of the joint venture, parts and
service technicians were flown to Moscow to repair the
medical machinery. Philips noted that the former approach
resulted in unacceptable delays in repairing equipment.</p>
<p>Of the three partners, Philips will hold the lion's share
of the venture with a 55% stake; the children's hospital will
hold a 30% share, with the remaining interest in the hands of
Tomotek.</p>
