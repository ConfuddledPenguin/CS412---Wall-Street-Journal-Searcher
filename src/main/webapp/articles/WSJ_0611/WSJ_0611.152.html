	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- Pat Williams, a Democratic congressman from
western Montana, gets a lot of unfriendly letters from
constituents.
   "I find myself sickened to think that you represent the
people of Montana," writes one in Great Falls. "You must be
some sort of human oddity," writes another in Laurel. "I pray
the voters will remove you from office," says a third in
Billings.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>In the past few months, Rep. Williams has received 32,000
letters, most of them from angry people. They contend Mr.
Williams, a former school teacher, is peddling pornography.
In his standard letter of reply, Mr. Williams says: "I want
to be absolutely certain you understand I have never
supported pornography or obscenity in any form, nor do I
now."</p>
<p>Mr. Williams receives such letters because he is chairman
of the subcommittee that authorizes spending for the National
Endowment for the Arts. The federal agency has existed for 28
years, quietly parceling out grants to the likes of the
Philadelphia Orchestra, the Society for American Baseball
Research and the Central Pennsylvania Friends of Jazz.</p>
<p>But in the past 18 months, the agency supported the artist
Andres Serrano and the late photographer Robert Mapplethorpe.
Those two grants, out of some 85,000 the agency has made over
the years, caused a furor. Mr. Serrano's work includes a
photograph of a crucifix submerged in a jar of urine, and Mr.
Mapplethorpe's work contains homoerotic images.</p>
<p>The outcry -- orchestrated by conservative groups -- has
reached the ears of members of Congress. "It's the hottest
button of all right now," says Rep. Steve Gunderson (R.,
Wis.). "It's almost like it's replacing abortion."</p>
<p>The endowment issue has been raised, unsuccessfully, in
elections in North Carolina and Arkansas.</p>
<p>Rep. Tom Coleman (R., Mo.) says: "The real problem comes
up at a town meeting back in your district. Some guy stands
up waving a photograph of one of these things, and he wants
to know why you're supporting this kind of stuff. And you're
going to be hard-pressed to respond."</p>
<p>Congress must vote this election year to reauthorize the
arts agency and to appropriate money for the fiscal year that
begins Oct. 1. Conservatives hope to use the votes
individually, or in batches, to defeat liberals.</p>
<p>His colleagues, says Rep. Williams, are appealing to him
to make changes in the grant-making procedures of the agency.
"`Give me something I can vote for,' they tell me." He's
trying, but so far he has had little help from the
administration.</p>
<p>President Bush has maintained a low profile on the issue.
In March, he responded to a news-conference question with an
endorsement of the agency's mission, but added that he found
certain works of art offensive. There wasn't any criticism
then of his position. And there isn't any criticism now over
the administration's bill to reauthorize the agency for five
years without any new restrictions on the kind of art it may
fund.</p>
<p>But the administration position isn't widely popular with
many members of Congress, Democratic or Republican. "We can't
pass it," says Rep. Coleman.</p>
<p>Anti-pornography forces, led by TV evangelist Pat
Robertson and Donald Wildmon, head of the American Family
Association, have given the administration a free ride,
concentrating their fire on Congress.</p>
<p>The battle has created internal problems at the agency.
Its chairman, John Frohnmayer, an Oregon lawyer and amateur
singer, fired his senior deputy, Alvin Felzenberg, allegedly
for leaking information to the agency's critics and for
suggesting changes in the agency's procedures. Mr. Felzenberg
is still on the job, but with no work to do, while the White
House looks for somewhere else to put him.</p>
<p>Last week, the administration altered its position on the
issue. Through Mr. Frohnmayer, it suggested: Reauthorize the
agency for just one year and postpone making changes in its
procedures until a 12-member commission, sworn in last week,
completes a report. The commission was created by Congress to
review the agency's grant-making procedures.</p>
<p>"It would be unfortunate for Congress to go rushing off
and dismantle the Endowment without listening first to what
this independent commission says," notes Mr. Frohnmayer.</p>
<p>But hardly anyone, least of all Rep. Williams, wants to
wait a year for a report. He hopes to reach agreement among
his subcommittee members on a multiple-year reauthorization
bill in a week or two. If the issue isn't resolved soon, he
fears, the agency will collapse.</p>
<p>But reaching agreement won't be easy. The agency's
congressional foes come in two guises.</p>
<p>The first group, led by Reps. Coleman and Gunderson, would
greatly alter the agency's procedures. The two congressmen
propose that 60% of the agency's funds be turned over to
state agencies, instead of the 20% currently. Of the 40% that
the agency would administer, grants would be for $50,000 and
up and would be limited to "art of national and international
significance." They would prohibit funding of works deemed
obscene as defined by the U.S. Supreme Court.</p>
<p>That proposal, says Mr. Frohnmayer, "emasculates the
federal presence in the arts, and it has been the federal
presence over all these years that has been responsible for
such a surge in growth in the arts." The arts community
agrees. Last week, museums dimmed their lights and shrouded
their paintings in black to protest attacks on funding
procedures.</p>
<p>The second group seeks to eliminate the agency altogether.
A leader is Rep. Dana Rohrabacher, a freshman Republican from
Orange County, Calif. He says the Coleman-Gunderson provision
to prohibit funding of works deemed to be obscene isn't
satisfactory.</p>
<p>"Simply because a work of art is legal, and the artist
can't be sent to jail, isn't enough," says Mr. Rohrabacher, a
former Reagan White House speechwriter. He insists the agency
should be abolished, and he will introduce such an amendment.
Sen. Jesse Helms (R., N.C.) is expected to make a similar
move in the Senate.</p>
