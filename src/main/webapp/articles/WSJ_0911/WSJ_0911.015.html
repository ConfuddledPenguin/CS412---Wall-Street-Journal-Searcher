	<p class="article-leader">CALABASAS, Calif. -- Lockheed Corp. said it signed a
memorandum of understanding with Japan Air Lines to discuss
investment by JAL in the aerospace concern's newly formed
Lockheed Commercial Aircraft Center Inc. subsidiary.
   A Lockheed spokesman said the company plans to invest
about $20 million to modify a hangar and purchase equipment
for the unit, which will maintain and modify Boeing Co. 747
aircraft. JAL may acquire a minority stake of 10% or more in
the unit, the spokesman said. Aircraft modification is a
growing business for Lockheed and other aerospace companies,
as their defense business shrinks.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The Lockheed unit has agreed with Norton Air Force Base in
San Bernardino, Calif., to lease two bays of a four-bay
hangar. When the base closes, sometime before 1994, Lockheed
will occupy the rest of the hangar. Each bay can accommodate
one Boeing 747 jetliner.</p>
<p>JAL has the world's largest fleet of Boeing 747s and is
highly experienced in maintaining and modifying the plane,
Lockheed said. JAL anticipates that a significant number of
its aging 747 aircraft will need modifications in the near
future, Lockheed said.</p>
<p>Lockheed is preparing the hangars to meet commercial
specifications. The facility is expected to begin operations
in the first quarter of next year. After a year of operation,
the unit is expected to have about 600 employees, increasing
to nearly 1,000 by 1994. The spokesman said Lockeed has about
75,000 employees.</p>
