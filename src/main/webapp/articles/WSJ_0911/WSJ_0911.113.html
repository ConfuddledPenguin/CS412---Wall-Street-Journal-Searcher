	<p class="article-leader">Healthco International Inc. said it filed a lawsuit in
federal court in Delaware alleging Gemini Partners L.P.
violated proxy rules in connection with the limited
partnership's consent solicitation to remove Healthco's
board.
   Healthco, a Boston-based dental equipment company, also
said that based on a review of the consents Gemini delivered
to Healthco last week, that Gemini hasn't obtained consents
representing a majority of Healthco's common outstanding.
Last week Gemini, based in New York, said it had received a
majority of consents executed by Healthco shareholders. If
certified, the consents would trigger the removal of the
incumbent Healthco board.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Healthco's lawsuit seeks to have written consents executed
in favor of Gemini's nominees declared invalid and seeks an
injunction against Gemini's consent solicitation.</p>
<p>Healthco alleges that Gemini violated laws by soliciting
and obtaining written consents prior to dissemination of
materials concerning Healthco's proposed merger with Hicks,
Muse & Co. It also alleges that Gemini is unlawfully
asserting the validity of written consents obtained before
shareholders knew about the proposed merger, in which Hicks
Muse will buy Healthco for $19.25 a share, or about $250
million.</p>
<p>Last week, Gemini filed suit against Healthco in Delaware
Chancery Court seeking a judgment declaring that Healthco's
current board has been lawfully removed by shareholders and
replaced by Gemini's seven-member slate.</p>
