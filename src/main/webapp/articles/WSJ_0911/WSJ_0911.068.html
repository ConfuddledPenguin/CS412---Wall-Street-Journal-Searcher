	<p class="article-leader">The following is an unsigned editorial in the Sept. 17
issue of National Review:</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>A number of our old friends and colleagues in the
conservative movement are offering an eccentric intepretation
of the present crisis. Mr. Bush's military intervention is,
they argue, a proper cause not for conservatives but for
neo-conservatives. A war, in which no vital American interest
is at stake, is being prepared for the benefit of Israel, the
despotic ruling family of Kuwait, and some utopian vision of
international order in which the U.S. would fight the UN's
wars. (Take your pick.) The deserts of Arabia will, against
all meteorological precedent, become a quagmire for American
forces. Bug out, America.</p>
<p>National Review, which can lay some claim to unhyphenated
conservatism, begs to differ.</p>
<p>America has at least three clear and vital interests in
this crisis. The first is secure access to oil at a price not
determined by a cartel under Iraqi military discipline. Our
second interest is in ousting an aggressive dictator who
seeks to lead "the Arab world" and who is building up
chemical and nuclear weapons in a region which has major U.S.
allies. These allies include, yes, Israel, but also Egypt,
Saudi Arabia, the Gulf sheikhdoms, and above all Turkey, to
which the U.S. is bound by NATO obligations and which has a
long-standing border dispute with Iraq. Not Zionism but
prudence suggests reducing the Iraqi threat while it is still
non-nuclear.</p>
<p>Our third interest is to ensure that the post-cold-war
world should, as far as possible, be one of peace and
stability. This is not global altruism. As a world power with
economic interests on all continents, the U.S. has a strong
interest in the international order that trade and overseas
investment require. Nor has it anything to do with a
universal crusade. Some local disputes will be ignored under
a "Pax Americana" just as Latin American wars went on
undisturbed during the "Pax Britannica". But disputes that
menace the wider world must be suppressed, or, better still,
prevented. The present crisis is exactly that. A victory for
Saddam Hussein would be an incentive to every Third World
dictator to settle his border disputes by force and to
acquire nuclear weapons as the means of certain victory; an
unadorned defeat would deter potential imitators. Our actions
now might well make the difference, at moderate cost, between
a century of commercial prosperity and one of multiplying
local conflicts and proliferating nuclear threats.</p>
<p>Against these solid interests, what arguments do our
friends on the neo-isolationist Right offer? They cite the
strategic defeatism of veterans of Jimmy Carter's National
Security Council. They borrow the Vietnam analogy from
Democratic opponents of Reagan's support for the Contras.
They swallow straight from Iraqi Ba'ath party propaganda the
notion of Arab nationalism sweeping all before it -- which is
hard to reconcile with its record of economic and military
failure, religious, tribal, and national division, and
internecine rivalry since 1945. They copy such sophisticated
inversions of the "foreign-policy establishment" as that an
American victory would be pyrrhic, leading to the overthrow
of friendly Arab regimes -- an argument which assumes that
the Gulf sheikhdoms now hosting U.S. forces are unaware of
their own interests and that they would be less threatened by
a U.S. defeat or U.S. inactivity in the face of Saddam's
aggression. They steal the argument that American power
should be committed only in support of democracy, to which
Kuwait's emir bears little resemblance -- from the
neo-conservatives] And when all else fails, they mutter
gloomily behind their hands that President Bush will "cave"
-- that is, follow their advice.</p>
<p>Such determined despair is unwarranted by the strategic
facts on the ground. President Bush has shown skill and
fortitude in building up a powerful force in Saudi Arabia
backed by diplomatic support from virtually the entire world.
We expect him to bite the bullet of military action when he
judges the time is right to reduce Iraq's power to harm. If
in the end he retreats, leaving Saddam Hussein to continue
his nuclear and chemical buildup for the next aggression, we
will criticize him as unambiguously then as we support him
now -- and we will have earned the right to do so. Those
conservatives who by their carping defeatism have made the
task of defeating Saddam Hussein appreciably more difficult
will have no such right. Should their views prevail, they
will have to live through the ensuing local wars, overthrows
of U.S. allies, credible threats of chemical and nuclear
aggression, spread of anti-American terrorism, seizure of
U.S. assets in the Third World, and disruption of the world
trade and commerce that underpins our domestic prosperity
without complaint and, we trust, in humble and contrite
silence.</p>
