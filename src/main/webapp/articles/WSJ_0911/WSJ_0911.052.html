	<p class="article-leader">TOKYO -- Government officials have again punched the hold
button on investors who want to buy a stake in the world's
biggest telecommunications company, Nippon Telegraph &
Telephone Corp.
   With Tokyo stock prices down nearly 40% since January and
NTT shareholders raising a ruckus, officials at Japan's
powerful Ministry of Finance confirmed what market analysts
here have been predicting for weeks: For the second year in a
row, the government will postpone plans to sell nearly two
million state-owned shares of NTT to private investors as
part of a continuing privatization program.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Ministry officials weren't available to comment, but
issued this statement late Monday afternoon: "Further
{government} sales of NTT shares could trigger more declines
in NTT stock prices and could have a bad influence on the
stock market."</p>
<p>The ministry still owns about two-thirds of the 15.6
million NTT shares outstanding; it is required by law to hold
at least one-third, but it would like to sell as many shares
as legally possible to use the proceeds to reduce the
government's debt.</p>
<p>Rumors of the announcement had cheered some investors. NTT
shares, the most expensive on the Tokyo Stock Exchange,
closed Monday at 881,000 yen ($6,285.94), up 21,000 yen. But
most analysts said the move indicates the telecommunications
conglomerate's distress.</p>
<p>"It's absolutely predictable," Michael Jeremy, an analyst
at Baring Securities (Japan) Ltd., said of the ministry's
move. "This company is in just as much difficulty as it was
last year at this time." And John Baldwin, an analyst at
Jardine Fleming Securities Ltd., said, "We took it as a
foregone conclusion."</p>
<p>Foreigners may buy and sell NTT shares but can't receive
their dividends.</p>
<p>Perhaps no other company listed on the Tokyo exchange has
proved as disappointing to Japanese investors as NTT, the
world's most heavily capitalized company. The public clamored
to own the stock after plans to privatize NTT were announced
in 1985. The press of eager investors was so great at the
first public auction of NTT shares in 1986 that the
government instituted a lottery to thin the ranks of bidders.
Individual investors snapped up the shares, assured by
enthusiastic Japanese brokers that it was impossible to lose
on NTT stock, because the biggest holder, the Finance
Ministry, would never allow its price to drop.</p>
<p>And at first, the predictions came true: By April 1988,
the price of NTT shares -- issued at a par value of 50,000
yen -- soared to a high of 3.18 million yen. But the price
declined relentlessly in the months that followed, as the
government continued to sell additional shares, even as
investors started to discover that NTT's financial prospects
weren't as rosy as anticipated. When the Finance Ministry
sold an additional 1.95 million shares in 1989, the price had
dropped to 1.19 million yen.</p>
<p>Jeffrey Zavattero, an analyst at Jardine Fleming, said he
expects NTT's operating profit in the year ending next March
to contract to 550 million yen from 665 million yen in fiscal
1990.</p>
<p>NTT faces competitive pressures in its most profitable
business, long distance. As a regulated monopoly, NTT must
maintain unprofitable local telephone businesses. It also is
caught in a cross fire between three regulatory agencies,
each of which has a different agenda for the company.</p>

<p>Corrections & Amplifications</p>
<p>JAPAN'S MINISTRY OF FINANCE first auctioned stock in
state-owned Nippon Telegraph & Telephone Corp. in 1987. It
last offered shares to the public in 1988. At the time, NTT's
stock traded at just below two million yen a share, down from
a high of 3.12 million yen in April 1987. In Tuesday's
edition, the history of the stock price was reported
incorrectly.</p>
