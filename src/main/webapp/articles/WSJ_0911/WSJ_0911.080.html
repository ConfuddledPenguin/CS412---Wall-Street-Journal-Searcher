	<p class="article-leader">JIDDA, Saudi Arabia -- On page two of the Arab News, just
above the daily listing of Moslem prayer times, a photo shows
a T-shirted U.S. servicewoman maneuvering a forklift as
another soldier looks on. In a country that bans women from
driving, working with men or appearing in public without
head-to-toe veils, the image breaks about every taboo in the
book.
   Yet Khaled al-Maeena, the newspaper's editor, says he
didn't think twice about publishing it. "The gulf crisis has
ushered in a new era in Saudi Arabia," he says. "It has
unleashed things here."</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Not everyone likes what's on the loose. At Rabieh Marmou's
beauty parlor, a discreet windowless salon, patrons shed
their veils and share their gripes about U.S. servicewomen.
"Not a single one approves of the women soldiers," Mrs.
Marmou says. "Everyone is sure they are here to provide sex
for the servicemen or, worse, to steal our husbands."</p>
<p>So it is that King Fahd's decision to invite U.S. troops
to this country has triggered debate all over Saudi Arabia,
and not just about women soldiers. The king's action has
irrevocably altered Saudi foreign policy and the nation's
image in the Arab world. It has exposed an intensely private
society to outside scrutiny and raised questions about the
need for a freer press and a more open political system.</p>
<p>Ever since the oil boom of the 1970s, Saudi Arabia has
been buffeted by bewildering crosswinds. Petrodollars brought
breakneck modernization to the tribal kingdom. But like a
desert chameleon changing its color, the conservative
monarchy managed to switch its skin without altering its
substance. Saudi Arabia adopted Western technology but
rejected Western values. Its austere, Wahaby version of Islam
and the absolute rule of the al-Saud family remain virtually
unchallenged despite a population increasingly well-educated
and well-traveled.</p>
<p>The result is a society that, to Westerners, can appear
slightly schizophrenic and filled with baffling
contradictions.</p>
<p>Sitting beneath diplomas from the Wharton School and
Georgetown University, a Saudi businessman describes as
"obnoxious" a Cable News Network decision to send a woman
reporter to Saudi Arabia. He goes on to express the hope that
U.S. troops remain sequestered on their bases to prevent
"unholy ramifications" from Western contaminants such as
alcohol and female drivers.</p>
<p>Like many wealthy Saudis, the businessman lives in a
handsome high-walled villa that groups working and living
quarters around a courtyard with fragrant flowers and a
floodlit swimming pool. Showing a guest out, he pauses and
asks, as an afterthought, if she would like to meet a few of
his friends.</p>
<p>Then, he opens the door on a scene of decadence worthy of
a Fellini movie. In a dimly lit room, a Philippine woman in a
skintight miniskirt gyrates to throbbing American rock as a
white-robed man fondles her rump. On sunken couches, women
caress men, or each other. One, a blond-maned Turk, rises to
pour drinks at a bar stocked with illicit gin, Heineken beer
and Johnnie Walker whiskey -- $135 a bottle on the black
market here.</p>
<p>Later, Saudis explain that such scenes are a safety valve.
"Anything is available so long as you don't bother your
neighbors," says a Saudi engineer who is, himself, strictly
religious. "Liberals can get what they want, fundamentalists
can get what they want."</p>
<p>An overwhelming majority of Saudis are, like the engineer,
deeply devout and wholeheartedly approving of their country's
strict, Islamically based legal code that provides flogging
for alcohol consumption and stoning for adultery. Even among
the secular minority, support is high for outward conformity
to Islamic rules. As custodians of Mecca and Medina, the
cities where the prophet Mohammed lived and preached, Saudis
feel that the eyes of a billion Moslems are upon them.</p>
<p>Most Saudis say they also are satisfied with the country's
political culture, essentially an elaboration of an ancient
tribal system without elections or parliaments. Here, the
complaints of the young are passed to their elders, who in
turn refer problems to tribal leaders. Each member of Saudi
Arabia's royal family of some 5,000 princes has a regular
open house, or Majlis, to which any citizen can come and ask
a favor or offer a criticism.</p>
<p>"There are princes scattered all over the country,"
explains Mohammed Abudawood, a Jidda-based trader and
industrialist. "So Saudis and their government share common
experiences and common interests." He believes the king's
quick call for American help during the current crisis shows
just how well the system works. "The man knew what he wanted,
and it was what we wanted," Mr. Abudawood says.</p>
<p>Saudis from all walks of life express support for the U.S.
presence. The clients of Mrs. Marmou, the hair stylist, may
have problems with female soldiers but they don't have any
complaints about the men. "Before they arrived, women were
hysterical," she says. "Some were hallucinating about gas
attacks, screaming that their skin was turning blue." Like
thousands of Saudis, Mrs. Marmou's family sent a cable to
King Fahd, congratulating him on his decision to request U.S.
help.</p>
<p>But some Saudis feel the current system copes well only
with the trivial problems of local constituencies, and isn't
adequate for the growing complexity of Saudi society.</p>
<p>"You have to be someone or know someone" to get anything
done, complains a senior Saudi official. In a government
building in Jidda, he reaches for a radio and tunes it to a
station blaring Arabic pop. "I'm sorry, but I want some noise
in the room," he explains, fearing that it might be bugged.</p>
<p>"OK, we have everything: We can go abroad and stay in
presidential suites. But when my wife goes out shopping here,
she can be harassed" by religious police who chastise or even
cane women who aren't strictly veiled. "And I can't take him
{the policeman} to court. I look at my children and
grandchildren and ask if they are going to live in a place
where law is respected."</p>
<p>For years now, King Fahd has hinted that he might
establish a Shura, or consultative council, to allow at least
a measure of formal public political participation. He even
erected a chamber for such a council in the capital, Riyadh.
But the building stands empty, and the subject has been
dropped.</p>
<p>Even Saudis who seek a more open system don't call for the
ouster of the al-Saud family. Ever since 1932, when Abdel
Aziz al-Saud -- the father of the current king -- unified
most of the Arabian peninsula and named it after his family,
the monarchy has proved remarkably durable and adept at
crisis management. In 1964, the princes banded together to
oust incompetent King Saud, their relative. In 1975, they
managed a smooth transition of power after the assassination,
at a Majlis, of King Faisal.</p>
<p>The current crisis appears to have enhanced King Fahd's
prestige at home, and reinvigorated his leadership. "He had
become lazy," confides a Saudi who knows the king. "He was
like a sophomore, letting things pile up for months then
staying up all night signing papers." Now, the Saudi says,
the king is once again the hands-on manager he was as a young
man, when, as crown prince, he guided the nation through the
oil boom.</p>
<p>By inviting Americans into Saudi Arabia, the king brought
the public face of Saudi foreign policy in line with the
longtime private reality. For years, the kingdom shared a
tacit alliance with the U.S., based on its need for military
protection and America's appetite for oil. But the symbiosis
was kept generally quiet for fear of damaging Saudi Arabia's
image with its fellow Arab nations.</p>
<p>Now, the bond with the U.S. has been blatantly exposed
and, for better or worse, Saudis are able to state bluntly
that Americans are friends without looking over their
shoulder at militant Moslems or radical Palestinians. Many
Saudis are breathing sighs of relief. "One thing I will thank
Saddam for forever," says Marwan Abdrabuh, a manager with a
Saudi oil refining company, "is showing us who our real
friends are."</p>
<p>Rumors abound of recent royal snubs of errant Arab
leaders. Prince Sultan, the defense minister, is said to have
hung up on Yemen's president when he called to complain about
Saudi violations of Yemen's airspace in the last few weeks.
King Fahd reportedly won't even take calls from Jordan's King
Hussein, while the Palestine Liberation Organization's Yasser
Arafat hasn't been allowed in the kingdom for over three
weeks.</p>
<p>Saudis seem dizzy with delight over this new freedom to
despise their erstwhile Arab allies. Nowhere is this more
apparent than in the Saudi press. "They used to stab at Brits
and Americans," says an American attorney working in Jidda.
"Now they're too busy sticking it to Saddam Hussein."</p>
<p>Sayidaty, a women's magazine that usually features bright
stories about family life, last week ran a graphic, harrowing
account of a Sudanese woman's rape by Iraqi soldiers in
Kuwait. On Sept. 3, Arab News published excerpts from the
U.S. State Department's 1989 report on human rights in Iraq.
The report, complete with accounts of the gassing and
deportation of minority Kurds in Iraq, has been out since
February, but before the current crisis its publication would
have been unthinkable in Saudi Arabia.</p>
<p>"I'm extremely upset with Arab media, including myself,"
says Mr. al-Maeena, the Arab News editor. "In the Middle East
the traditional policy was that you didn't criticize an Arab
country. Its internal affairs were its own business. Now the
time has come for each and every one of us to see that the
truth emerges . . . especially if there are human rights
abuses or clear-cut violations of Islamic law."</p>
<p>But such frankness on domestic issues might have to wait a
while. Asked if he would report on a human rights abuse in
Saudi Arabia, Mr. al-Maeena demurs. "As an editor my duty
would be to see that the authorities know about it," he says.
"I would take the information to the king or to the minister
of the interior.'</p>
<p>Debate on Saudi economic management also isn't likely to
make the papers, although it is a hot topic around dinner
tables. "We are all asking ourselves where the billions went
that we invested in military spending all these years," says
a manager in Dhahran, who is alarmed that without U.S. help
the kingdom would have been indefensible. At one huge base,
King Khalid Military City, Saudis laid dynamite and were
prepared to destroy the facility rather than let it fall into
Iraqi hands.</p>
<p>Many Saudis say it's clear enough where the defense
dollars went: building the first-rate infrastructure that has
received and housed the U.S. forces. Still, a number of
officials expect to see a doubling of Saudi military
spending, so that in a future crisis the country's need for
outside help won't be quite so urgent.</p>
<p>Saudi Arabia should have plenty of money to fund any
military buildup, thanks to higher oil prices and an increase
in its own production. Mr. Abudawood, the Jidda
industrialist, is among those who relish the coming
opportunities. The crisis, he says, "was a surprise, and
business doesn't like surprises." But now, he says, people
have seen the huge force the U.S. is willing to commit to
secure Saudi Arabia. With the might of the U.S. military
massed on its borders, he says, "Saudi Arabia probably is the
safest place on earth."</p>
<p>But a degree of social insecurity may be part of the
price. Cruising one of the three-lane highways that bisect
the desert, a young Saudi speaks of the new awareness of
human rights he hopes the U.S. presence may bring. Then,
overtaking a U.S. Army jeep, he glimpses pigtails sprouting
from beneath the driver's camouflage cap, slams on the brakes
and stares at the woman. "This isn't good," he says, shaking
his head gravely.</p>
