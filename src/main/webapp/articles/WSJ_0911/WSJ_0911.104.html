	<p class="article-leader">Amdura Corp. said that United Hardware Distributing Co.
submitted the highest bid for assets of its Amdura National
Distribution Co. unit during an auction in federal bankruptcy
court.
   United Hardware, a hardware cooperative based in Plymouth,
Minn., bid $21.5 million in cash for the Amdura unit's
inventory and distribution center in Milbank, S.D. The assets
were placed on the auction block after United Hardware topped
an earlier offer from Our Own Hardware Co.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The United Hardware bid is subject to the approval of the
bankruptcy judge overseeing Amdura's reorganization under
Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code. Amdura said a hearing on
the sale is expected before Sept. 25.</p>
<p>Amdura, a Denver hardware distributor, said the bulk of
the proceeds from the sale will be held in escrow for future
payments to creditors. About $1 million will be placed in
escrow to pay employee benefit claims and rebates due the
unit's customers.</p>
