	<p class="article-leader">DETROIT -- Mercedes-Benz of North America said it will
introduce three diesel models later this month, after nearly
eliminating diesels from its U.S. product line during the
last three years.
   Mercedes, a unit of Daimler-Benz AG of West Germany, said
it is counting on the midsize 300D, and the larger 350SD and
350SDL turbos, to help it meet government fuel economy
standards. The 1991 diesels range in price from $41,000 for
the 300D model to $57,800 for the 350SDL.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Mercedes hasn't had a diesel among its medium or
large-sized cars in the U.S. since 1987, and didn't sell many
diesel-equipped versions of its compact 190 model. Company
officials concede that some customers complained that the
diesels performed poorly, and that diesels simply weren't
particularly attractive in an era of low gasoline prices.</p>
<p>Now that era may be ending. While Mercedes was planning to
reintroduce diesels before the Persian Gulf crisis sent
gasoline prices soaring, it is clear the company was
concerned that federal fuel-economy standards would increase
in the long term.</p>
<p>The U.S. Senate is preparing to debate legislation that
could raise the average standard to 40 miles a gallon or more
by the year 2001. Currently, only a few subcompact cars meet
that requirement. Diesel engines generally get better fuel
economy than gasoline engines, though they also tend to have
more tailpipe emissions. In fact, the new diesel models won't
be sold in California, because they don't comply with that
state's strict emissions standards.</p>
<p>Mercedes, however, says its new diesels will perform
better, run quieter and have cleaner exhausts than their
predecessors. Mercedes said the 1991 models also get more
miles a gallon: The 300D, for example, gets 27 miles a gallon
compared with the smaller 1974-model 240D, which got 24 miles
a gallon.</p>
<p>At 27 miles to the gallon, the new 300D will come close to
meeting the current federal corporate average fuel economy
standard of 27.5 miles a gallon.</p>
<p>So far, Mercedes hasn't fared well in its attempts to meet
existing fuel laws, because it builds big cars. Last year,
Mercedes had to pay $20.4 million in federal fuel-economy
penalties. The auto maker's estimated penalty for 1990 is
$18.6 million, based on an average fuel economy of 21.2 miles
a gallon for all cars it sold in the U.S. In 1989, the auto
maker's average fuel economy was 21.4 miles a gallon on cars
sold in the U.S.</p>
<p>"If you build large automobiles, it isn't easy to comply
with fuel-economy regulations," Albert Weiss, general
marketing manager for Mercedes-Benz of North America, said at
a preview of the auto maker's 1991 model lineup. "If building
big cars brings penalties, I guess we'll have to live with
that."</p>
<p>The company also will have to live with federal
"gas-guzzler" taxes of between $500 to $1,300 a car on about
half of its 1991 model line.</p>
<p>Mercedes officials said they don't expect a big sales
surge from the new diesels despite the Mideast crisis,
because the rise in gasoline prices hasn't been strong or
sustained enough to influence its customers. The company
wouldn't project U.S. sales for next year. For the first
eight months of this year, Mercedes sold just over 48,000
cars in the U.S., about equal with last year. For all of last
year, though, the company's U.S. sales were 24% below the
peak year of 1986.</p>
