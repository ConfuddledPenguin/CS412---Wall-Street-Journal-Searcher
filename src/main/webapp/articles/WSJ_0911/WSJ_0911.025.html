	<p class="article-leader">It was certainly one of the most colorful protests in
business history. A dozen marchers paraded outside a
Pennsylvania factory, dragging along a human skeleton in a
wooden coffin. They carried placards that said: "When Does 8
x 8 Equal Less Than 64? When We Hate the New 8]" and "Indians
Call It Maize, We Call It Gone."
   Then they solemnly took a handful of crayons, broke them
in half, and dropped them into the coffin.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The target of this demonstration was Binney & Smith Inc.,
the maker of Crayola crayons. This summer the company, a unit
of Hallmark Cards Inc., retired eight colors from its
well-known, 64-crayon flip-top box: raw umber, maize, lemon
yellow, blue gray, violet blue, green blue, orange red and
orange yellow. In their place came eight sexy new hues for
the 1990s: wild strawberry, vivid tangerine, fuchsia, teal
blue, cerulean, royal purple, jungle green and dandelion.</p>
<p>To the company's surprise, the move has drawn an
outpouring of protest from a veritable spectrum of crayon
loyalists. Robert Pagani, a Phillipsburg, N.J., theme-park
worker, created CRAYON, Committee to Re-establish All Your
Old Norms. When Binney & Smith held a special ceremony to
enshrine the eight old colors in the Crayola Hall of Fame,
Mr. Pagani staged the protest march with the coffin and the
skeleton. "They call it a retirement. I call it a burial," he
says.</p>
<p>Karen Latinik, a sophomore at James Madison University in
Harrisonburg, Va., founded the National Campaign to Save
Lemon Yellow and sent a petition with about 100 signatures.
Binney & Smith's polite reply was signed in lemon yellow
crayon. "That seemed like a slap in the face to me," Ms.
Latinik says.</p>
<p>Kenneth Lang, a Locust Valley, N.Y., gifts and housewares
manager, sent an aggrieved letter from RUMPS, the Raw Umber
and Maize Preservation Society. Loretta Lampkin, the
associate minister of the First United Methodist Church in
Bossier City, La., wrote Binney & Smith to sadly recall
restoring the polish on her scuffed shoes with the old
colors. Another letter writer, artist Jane Hankins of
Gardner, Mass., warned: "Have you forgotten what happened to
Coca-Cola when they also decided to abandon tradition in
favor of a new `recipe.'"</p>
<p>And first-grader Ebony Faison from Philadelphia asked:
"Whenever I draw me, I use raw umber. What color should I
color now?"</p>
