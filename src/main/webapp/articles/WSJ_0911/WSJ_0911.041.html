	<p class="article-leader">PHILADELPHIA -- Westmoreland Coal Co. said it signed a
six-year extension of its contract to provide low-sulfur coal
to Appalachian Power Co., a unit of American Electric Power
Co.
   The new agreement extends an existing contract for
Westmoreland to supply about 600,000 tons of coal annually.
The extension begins Dec. 1, 1995.</p>

prices higher than current market base prices of $25 to $27 a
