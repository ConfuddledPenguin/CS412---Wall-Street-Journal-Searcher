	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- The House, in a strong show of bipartisan
support, passed on a voice vote a bill that would reregulate
cable television rates for basic service and assist emerging
competitors.
   The bill's swift passage, however, doesn't guarantee
enactment of the legislation this year. The bill faces an
uncertain future in the Senate as well as a veto threat from
the White House.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Under the House-passed bill, the Federal Communications
Commission would establish a maximum fee that cable operators
could charge for retransmission of broadcast signals, as well
as public education and government channels.</p>
<p>To discipline so-called bad actors, the FCC would develop
guidelines to identify exorbitant rates, and local or state
authorities would be allowed to step in on a case-by-case
basis when they suspect price gouging. Local cable
authorities would also monitor customer service standards
developed by the FCC.</p>
<p>While the bill permits cable operators to buy exclusive
programming, it also requires operators to provide their
signals to competitors, such as satellite and microwave
services, in a "reasonable" and "nondiscriminatory" fashion.</p>
<p>The measure received a swift rebuke from the White House,
which threatened a veto. The White House drew up a laundry
list of complaints, saying that the bill would impose
additional federal regulation over cable rates and hamper
cable programmers' ability to distribute their products.</p>
<p>In addition, the Bush administration criticized
restrictions on foreign ownership of cable systems,
expressing concern that this would invite retaliation
overseas. And it said the "must carry" requirements, which
spell out cable companies' obligations to carry signals of
broadcast stations in the area, raise First Amendment
questions.</p>
<p>On similar grounds, it raised concerns about the bill's
requirement that cable operators offer a basic tier of
service that doesn't include special cable programming. As
for competition, the administration reiterated its
recommendation that Congress lift restrictions that bar
telephone companies from entering the cable business, a
suggestion that cable companies adamantly oppose.</p>
<p>The National Cable Television Association, the industry's
main trade association, expressed dismay with the legislation
but didn't say it would oppose the bill. NCTA President James
Mooney said his group "continues to be deeply troubled by the
legislation" and it remains "an open question whether a
reasonable cable bill" can be enacted this year. "What began
as a consumer issue is now turning into an effort by other
industries to pile on, and hobble cable as a competitor," he
said.</p>
<p>The cable bill was spurred by sizable increases in monthly
cable fees since rates were largely deregulated in 1987. In
some cases, rates have doubled or tripled, although increases
have moderated in recent months.</p>
<p>House passage puts pressure on the Senate to take up its
version of cable revision soon, but whether Congress can pass
cable legislation this year remains uncertain. The Senate
measure, which has cleared the Commerce Committee, includes
tougher language on providing programming to competitors but
gives cable operators more leeway to raise rates. Even if the
Senate acts soon, the measures would have to go through a
conference committee to iron out details.</p>
<p>In the House, Rep. Edward Markey (D., Mass.), chairman of
the telecommunications and finance subcommittee and co-author
of the bill along with Rep. Matthew Rinaldo (R., N.J.), said
the bill "addresses real problems in a surgical and balanced
manner." He promised it would provide strong consumer
protection, ignite competition and expand diversity in video
programming.</p>
<p>Gene Kimmelman, legislative director of the Consumer
Federation of America, applauded the House bill. He called it
"one of the bigger victories for consumers this year because
it combines immediate pocketbook protections with the
promotion of competition to cable down the road."</p>
