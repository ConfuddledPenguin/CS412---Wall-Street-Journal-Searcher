	<p class="article-leader">TINTON FALLS, N.J. -- Denis R. Brown, a specialist in
corporate turnarounds, was named president, chief executive
officer and vice chairman of Concurrent Computer Corp. as the
company undergoes a restructuring effort.
   Concurrent also named a director, Dean W. Freed, chairman.
Mr. Freed, 67 years old, had been chairman and chief
executive of EG&G Inc., a provider of scientific products and
services in Wellesley, Mass.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Mr. Brown, 51, succeeds James K. Sims, 44, who resigned
his three posts in the wake of the company's report Friday of
a net loss of $38 million, or $2.05 a share, for the fourth
quarter ended June 30. The results include a $24.2 million
restructuring provision.</p>
<p>Mr. Brown said he will be "taking a good hard look" at
Concurrent's three segments, which supply computer systems to
commercial, technical and government clients. He formerly was
president and chief executive of Penn Central Industries
Group, a subsidiary of Penn Central Corp., Cincinnati.</p>
<p>Mr. Sims, who presided at Concurrent from its inception in
1985 to its merger in 1988 with Massachusetts Computer Corp.,
had weathered a series of revenue losses in recent years.
Industry downturns and economic uncertainties resulted in a
previously announced near-20% reduction in the company's
world-wide workforce and several plant shutdowns.</p>
<p>In national over-the-counter trading yesterday,
Concurrent's common stock closed at 75 cents a share, down
12.5 cents.</p>
