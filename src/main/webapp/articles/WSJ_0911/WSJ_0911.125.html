	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- The government strategy guiding the
savings-and-loan cleanup may have outlived its usefulness,
according to the chairman of the federal bailout agency.
   Testifying before the Senate Banking Committee, William
Seidman, chairman of the Resolution Trust Corp., expressed
some doubt about whether it is prudent to maintain the policy
of automatically seizing sick S&Ls. "Closing an institution
rapidly does not necessarily mean that we'll end up without
loss," Mr. Seidman said. "If the institution is not being
badly managed, we simply transfer bad assets from the
institution to the government."</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The government already has seized most of the biggest and
most insolvent thrifts, leaving the RTC bloated with billions
of dollars in assets. The assets remain a taxpayer burden
until the agency finds buyers -- a process that is expected
to take years. The RTC now must evaluate whether this
tourniquet approach makes sense for thrifts not bleeding red
ink so profusely.</p>
<p>But by allowing undercapitalized S&Ls to remain open, the
regulators risk repeating mistakes of the 1980s, when
regulators allowed ailing thrifts to continue operating in
the hope that the economy would improve. The strategy, called
"forbearance," simply gave the thrifts more time to pile up
losses.</p>
<p>"With the history during the 1980s, any notion of
forbearance tends to be automatically seen as unattractive
and not facing up to problems," Sen. Donald Riegle, chairman
of the committee warned. But the Michigan Democrat urged the
regulators to reverse course if new tactics can save money in
the long run.</p>
<p>Many industry experts have complained that the RTC has
taken an unyielding approach toward undercapitalized thrifts,
whose management and portfolios may differ radically. "The
RTC is already choking on everything it has," said Randy
German, a thrift accounting expert for Grant Thornton, a New
York-based accounting firm. "They are going to have to come
up with other ideas." He said the regulators should delay
seizing sick thrifts, while monitoring their operations.</p>
<p>With the bailout fund expected to run out of cash by the
end of the year, a strategy of easing up on undercapitalized
thrifts would allow cleanup officials to conserve cash in the
short term. And even after Congress sets aside new funds for
the cleanup, soft real-estate markets are going to push the
S&L cleanup costs still higher, Mr. Seidman said. "Every time
we estimate losses now, we're looking at lower real-estate
markets, which means the losses are higher," he added.</p>
<p>Also at the hearing, the banking regulators agreed to
resolve within 30 days a dispute over the amount of capital
that banks must hold in reserve. New regulations require
banks and thrifts to reserve capital based upon the amount of
risk in their lending. Mr. Seidman, also chairman of the
Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., said that the FDIC agrees
with rules proposed by the Federal Reserve governing minimum
capital standards. The two agencies are discussing
differences in the capital rule language with the comptroller
of the currency.</p>
