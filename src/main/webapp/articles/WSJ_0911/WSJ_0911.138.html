	<p class="article-leader">A set of class-action suits filed in 1986 by former
shareholders against MGM Entertainment Co., now MGM/UA
Communications Co., and its directors have been settled with
for up to $20 million.
   But at the same time, the Los Angeles-based entertainment
company and the directors filed a lawsuit against three
insurance carriers, claiming they acted in bad faith in
agreeing to the settlement. MGM/UA attorney Terry Christensen
called the insurers' action "a sneak attack."</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>If approved Friday by a Los Angeles Superior Court judge,
all defendants, including MGM/UA as a corporation, would be
dropped from the litigation except majority shareholder Kirk
Kerkorian and his Tracinda Corp. The suits allege that when
MGM/UA was acquired by Turner Broadcasting Systems Inc. in
1986, United Artists assets were sold back to Mr. Kerkorian
at an unfairly undervalued price, $470 million.</p>
<p>The remaining litigation against Mr. Kerkorian, who is not
insured by the three companies, is set to go to trial in Los
Angeles Superior Court Sept. 24.</p>
<p>The insurance concerns are Forum Insurance Co. of Chicago,
Associated International Insurance Co. of Los Angeles and
National Union Fire Insurance Co. of Pittsburgh.</p>
