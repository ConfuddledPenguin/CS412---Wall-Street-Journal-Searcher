	<p class="article-leader">ALBANY, N.Y. -- Xerox Corp. agreed to pay $90,000 in civil
penalties to the New York State Department of Environmental
Conservation for allegedly violating state air pollution
control laws.
   The agency charged that Xerox exceeded emission limits at
its Joseph C. Wilson Center for Technology in Webster, N.Y.,
for two years. No evidence suggested, however, that the
emissions posed any health threat, the department said. Xerox
agreed to the fine without admitting any of the agency's
charges.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>A spokesman for Xerox said that the Stamford, Conn.,
business-machines company's failure to comply stemmed from a
series of misunderstandings. "There was certainly never any
intention of deliberately not complying," he said, adding
that the company has agreed to pay the fine by Oct. 4 and
that the facility is in compliance with state environmental
laws.</p>
