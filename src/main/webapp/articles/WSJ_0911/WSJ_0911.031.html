	<p class="article-leader">Jean-Pascal Delamuraz, ordered the abolition of cartel-like
agreements in the country's banking industry.
   The long-awaited decision conforms to a request by the
country's cartel commission. The banking industry has
previously said it would appeal such a decision to the Swiss
Supreme Court.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Mr. Delamuraz's move caps a long battle between the banks
and the commission over four cartel-like arrangements. The
decree became necessary after the banks and the commission
failed to agree on a solution.</p>
<p>One of the four pacts deals with the syndicate of big
banks that dominates the underwriting of Swiss-franc bonds.
Mr. Delamuraz's order means that by the end of the year, the
banks must eliminate the so-called "loyalty" clause of the
convention, which prevents members from participating in
transactions outside the syndicate.</p>
<p>Also at year end, the agreement setting minimum fees for
documentary credits must be abolished.</p>
<p>Further, the decree orders the elimination by 1992 of the
convention that fixes fees on securities brokerage and of the
pact that governs commissions for custodial operations.</p>
