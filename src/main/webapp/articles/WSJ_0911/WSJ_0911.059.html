	<p class="article-leader">BOISE, Idaho -- At the headquarters of Albertson's Inc.,
one of the nation's three most profitable supermarket chains,
vice chairman and chief financial officer Gary Michael is
confident. With 524 stores located in middle-class markets
throughout the West and across the Sunbelt to Texas and
Florida, his company is well placed to keep growing in the
1990s.
   One key to Albertson's success, however, has been its
quickness to close stores that are fading, Mr. Michael notes.
The chain doesn't aim for overall market share but for
per-store revenue marks. And although he thinks price is
secondary to other factors in keeping his registers humming,
Mr. Michael concedes that if any of his shops get caught in
an untenable cost trap he will pull the plug pronto.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The prospect, if unlikely, isn't an idle one. Along the
West Coast, Albertson's has joined other chain grocers in
recent months in a series of wage pacts with the United Food
and Commercial Workers (UFCW) to lift the pay of experienced
clerks and butchers to the $12-$15/hour range, with rather
generous medical plans and vesting of benefits to part-timers
working as little as 16 hours a week. That's fine for
everybody in the industry until a nonunion challenger
arrives. Now that day may be here.</p>
<p>Wal-Mart is coming to California, and its food outlets
could follow. "Warehouse" sellers such as Costco, Price
Savers and PACE got started in the West offering housewares
nearly a decade ago, and now do a third of their business in
groceries. The discounters are hitting the high-cost
Northeast markets, too.</p>
<p>Some doubt this will amount to much. Analyst Sarah Stack
of Bateman Eichler, Hill Richards in Los Angeles says these
operators account for just 2% of the supermarket trade, and
doesn't think that will grow much. She agrees with
Albertson's Mr. Michael that convenient location, local
identity and manageable store size appeal more to shoppers
than slashed prices.</p>
<p>To some degree, the grocers have gotten the cost message.
Kimberly Walin, a Shearson Lehman analyst, says wage
settlements generally have trailed the cost of living since
the mid-'80s. At the UFCW's Washington, D.C., offices,
William Olwell, executive vice president for collective
bargaining, acknowledges that his union's compensation rates
have met resistance.</p>
<p>The warehouse stores, because they require items to be
bought in larger quantities, can't capture most consumers,
Mr. Olwell believes. But they're pinching. Sam's (as in
Walton) Wholesale Club "has done damage to our employers."
Together with nonunion grocery chains such as fast-growing
Food Lion in the South, they're holding UFCW membership from
the industry to about 800,000 nationwide. Cost pressure was a
cause of the much-noted Safeway layoffs and pullout from
Dallas.</p>
<p>Mr. Olwell says unionization rates are above 90% along the
West Coast. This is abetted by the antitrust-proof practice
of group negotiating by employers (and union locals) in
various regions. Even mainly nonunion entrants to the field,
such as Smith's from Utah, which plans 60 huge stores in
Southern California over the next five years, fall in step
and require workers to sign up with the UFCW. This "parity"
is fine with Albertson's Mr. Michael, who seems to assent to
what Mr. Olwell says is the UFCW's main goal: "to eliminate
wages as a competitive factor."</p>
<p>Consumers may not endorse that happy arrangement. Mr.
Olwell himself says that whereas he "didn't have to worry as
much" in the 1960s and '70s, when a nonunion operator would
typically keep whatever was scrimped from pay or fringes,
these days the saving underwrites price wars for which
higher-paying chains are less suited. (However, he claims
that in Florida, where the UFCW's situation is a "basket
case," shoppers are not realizing the gains from wage
discounts he says are 40% off the "normal" rates.)</p>
<p>Other things equal, a higher wage scale will bolster
longevity in the job -- ideally of employees who please
customers. Management and labor both cite this stability as a
plus, comparing grocery help favorably with department-store
cashiers whose pay is less and turnover higher. This is why
some nonunion grocers, and even a warehouse chain like
Costco, will at least match union scale. (The biggest of the
warehousers, Price Club of San Diego, has a Teamsters
contract.)</p>
<p>Mr. Michael, whose stores are nonunion away from the West
Coast, says Albertson's succeeds with either type of labor.
But he credits having the chain in many low-cost market
areas, as well as minimizing central-office overhead, with
its 11%-plus return on average assets.</p>
<p>Still, with costs for its 55,000 employees constituting
70% of Albertson's operating expenses (exclusive of
inventory), the union contracts are a potential drag on
profitability. Of the recent West Coast settlements, Mr.
Michael says, "We have to get productivity increases out of
those wage increases. . . . We have to have programs in the
meat departments where you cut more, where you bring in the
beef a little differently and you trim it differently.
Consumers are not going to let you pass it along."</p>
<p>He thinks Albertson's can tough it out with Sam Walton's
crew if need be. "When it comes to quality and assortment,
they can't compete with us," he says. "They're not going to
be able to sell fresh produce necessarily cheaper than we
are. It's not like selling toilet paper. You can't buy ahead.
If lettuce freezes in Salinas, their lettuce freezes just
like ours does."</p>
<p>If outsiders are to penetrate rich marketplaces such as
California, they will probably do best on urban outskirts.
Land costs in established areas are so high that finding a
site there and then trying to draw customers away from
established chains is considered a longshot.</p>
<p>Once blessed with a desirable address, the modern
supermarket tries to provide "one-stop shopping" for daily
needs, food or otherwise. By typically offering four times
the selection of items to be found in a low-cost "warehouse,"
the UFCW's Mr. Olwell says, the full-service chain store can
retain customers who don't want to shuttle shop.</p>
<p>We'll see. The warehouse stores, even with a cumbersome
membership arrangement, have boosted sales to $20 billion
from $1 billion in 1984. In 1988 the trade journal
Supermarket News found they offered more than a 14% savings
on food items. No wonder the UFCW is trying to organize them.
(Even if they pay according to scale, however, their lean
staffing is going to bleed the union.)</p>
<p>Grocery wage and benefit levels in much of the country are
a service-sector anomaly. Without commensurately higher
output they cannot be sustained, even in a cartelized
bargaining setup, unless consumers are prepared to pay extra
for whatever service or convenience premium is involved. To
date, most have been willing to do that, but their choices
are widening. If economic hard times are visited on the broad
middle class, they may choose another checkstand.</p>
