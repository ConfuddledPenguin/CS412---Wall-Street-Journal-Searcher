	<p class="article-leader">PALATINE, Ill. -- Sam Cali insists that he "played by the
rules" in his nearly 10 years as a futures broker.
   Some of those rules were written in the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange rule book. Others were simply practices devised by a
host of harried exchange members, at all levels, who were
struggling to cope with a crush of customer orders in the
go-go 1980s.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"I went according to the system," Mr. Cali says. "I didn't
get rich, and I didn't steal any money."</p>
<p>But prosecutors have a darker view of Mr. Cali: To them,
he is a key defendant among the 14 traders of Japanese-yen
futures who go on trial beginning today for allegedly
stealing customer profits.</p>
<p>The 39-year-old Mr. Cali, a thin, softspoken man, faces
two counts of racketeering, and more than 90 counts of fraud
and violations of the Commodity Exchange Act. He could be
imprisoned for as long as 20 years if found guilty of
racketeering by the 12-member jury in federal district court
in Chicago.</p>
<p>Mr. Cali certainly doesn't fit the popular image of a
futures trader as a high-rolling Prince of the Pits. He says
he never made more than $65,000 to $70,000 a year as a
Chicago Mercantile Exchange broker. Not bad for a high-school
graduate. But not much compared with the six- and
seven-figure annual incomes reaped by the biggest brokers in
the yen pit.</p>
<p>Nor does Mr. Cali live in an exclusive suburb or drive a
flashy car. To pay his legal bills, he is being forced to
sell a four-bedroom, two-story colonial home in this
middle-class suburb northwest of Chicago. Until he had to
give up his leased exchange seat recently, Mr. Cali left home
for the Merc every morning at 5:45 a.m. in a five-year old
Volvo that now has 90,000 miles on it.</p>
<p>Mr. Cali's relatively modest circumstances, and the
similar life styles of many of the other traders on trial,
highlight the difference between the Chicago futures-pit
probe and the Wall Street insider-trading investigation of
the past few years. In New York, insider-trading charges sent
multimillionaire investors such as Ivan Boesky to jail.</p>
<p>In Chicago, the trial's scope has raised questions about
the government's willingness to pursue the worst offenders.
Critics charge that despite its claims to the contrary, the
government is content to see just small fry jailed in order
to scare the markets into reform. The Merc's 14 yen traders
are among 48 people indicted last year in a government sting
operation aimed at rooting out alleged fraud in the futures
pits.</p>
<p>Next week, opening statements will be heard in a separate
trial of 10 soybean-futures traders from the Chicago Board of
Trade who are charged with stealing customer trading profits.
An 11th trader, Scott Anixter, pleaded guilty yesterday to
four misdemeanor charges against him in the case, and agreed
to cooperate with the government's probe of soybean traders.</p>
<p>Nine of the 19 soybean-futures traders indicted last year
have pleaded guilty to reduced charges in return for agreeing
to cooperate with the probe. Six of the 21 indicted
yen-futures traders have pleaded guilty. A seventh yen trader
pleaded no contest to the government charges and is also
cooperating with the investigation.</p>
<p>The yen and soybean trials, each expected to take at least
four months, will cover ground similar to an earlier case
this summer that resulted in a mixed verdict. In that case, a
federal jury in Chicago convicted two out of three
Swiss-franc traders of a total of eight trading violations,
but remained deadlocked on two-thirds of more than 100
charges against the three.</p>
<p>Many of the pending charges allege that pit brokers
routinely avoided having to pay for trading errors by
inducing an independent "local" trader in the pit to take a
losing trade into his account. The local would get repaid
later with profits or "points" from other customer orders.
Brokers also stand accused of exploiting futures-price swings
by skimming off a slice of the profits on customer trades. A
futures contract is an agreement to buy or sell a specific
amount of a commodity or financial instrument at a certain
price on a specified future date.</p>
<p>Mr. Cali grew up on Chicago's North Side, following his
father into the glass business after high school. In 1980 he
joined a high-school friend on the Merc trading floor to
become a futures pit broker. A year and a half ago he
followed another trader and close friend to the trader's
apartment building near the Merc. Once there, Mr. Cali was
confronted by federal agents, including one who had posed for
over a year as a fellow futures broker named Peter Vogel.</p>
<p>Mr. Cali said he knows he hasn't done anything wrong. But
he refused to comment on any of the specific government
charges against him.</p>
<p>His attorney, Thomas Durkin of Durkin, Foster & Roberts in
Chicago, has harshly criticized the government's use of
racketeering charges against his client, and said earlier
that Mr. Cali is innocent of all the charges. He declined to
be interviewed for this article.</p>
<p>Mr. Cali started small when he came to the Merc trading
floor in 1980. He held the "deck" of customer orders for his
high-school friend Dean Kaulentis, who was a broker in the
live cattle-futures trading pit at the Merc. By 1983 Mr. Cali
had transferred to the Japanese yen-futures pit, one of the
Merc's most boisterous and fast-growing trading arenas.
Within a year he was trading as many as 1,000 yen futures
contracts for customers on a busy day, compared with 200
daily when he moved into the pit.</p>
<p>Peter Vogel, the undercover agent whose real name was
Dietrich Volk, appeared in the yen pit regularly in early
1988. The agent stood in front of and one step below Mr. Cali
in the stepped trading pit. Mr. Cali would chat with the
agent when trading was slow. Occasionally they would have
breakfast together at Lou Mitchell's, a local restaurant
popular with Merc traders.</p>
<p>The agent was always asking Mr. Cali and other brokers if
he could "help them" execute customer orders. "I must have
told him 100 times no," Mr. Cali said. He said he turned to
another broker in the pit at one point and asked: "Why is
this guy always in my face?"</p>
<p>The government alleges that Mr. Cali did more than just
say no. When Mr. Cali was confronted by the agent and a
handful of assistant U.S. attorneys in January of 1989 at his
friend's apartment, he said, "I'm not a criminal. I mean I
am, but I'm not," according to the agent's testimony at a
pretrial hearing. The agent testified that Mr. Cali also told
him of participating in specific trades that the government
alleges were fraudulent.</p>
<p>After the investigation surfaced, Mr. Cali, at the Merc's
request, quit handling customer orders and started trading
one to five contracts at a time for his own account. The Merc
asked that other brokers who were targets of the government
investigation do the same. Mr. Cali said his income plunged
about 80% as a result.</p>
<p>His wife, Hiba, recently took a job at the checkout
counter of a local Dominick's supermarket to help keep her
mind off the coming trial and to bring in some income. "It's
scary," she says, sitting at the round oak kitchen table with
her husband. "Financially, we're busted."</p>
