	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- Consumer debt grew in July at its fastest
rate in nine months, the Federal Reserve reported, but
analysts found signs in the data that Americans may be
feeling financially pinched.
   The amount of consumer credit outstanding in the U.S.
increased by $4.47 billion during the month, or at an annual
rate of 7.4%, the fastest pace of increase since October, the
Fed said. That followed a meager $116 million rise in June,
amounting to a 0.2% annual rate of expansion, and an increase
of $3.65 billion, or a 6.1% annual rate, in May.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Most of the July increase was in revolving credit, a
category that includes credit-card borrowing. Revolving
credit soared $3.77 billion in July, a 21.7% annual rate,
after expanding at rates of 7% in June and 18.8% in May.</p>
<p>Analysts suggested that the figures might reflect more a
drop in repayments than a rise in borrowing.</p>
<p>Cynthia Latta, senior financial economist at
DRI/McGraw-Hill, an economic forecasting firm in Lexington,
Mass., said given the slowdown in the economy, a likely
explanation for the big rise in revolving credit is that
"people are feeling the squeeze and not paying off as much of
their balance."</p>
<p>At the same time, she said, "it looks as though people
have been trying to get their cars paid off," another common
occurrence during soft economic times.</p>
<p>Automobile debt declined $534 million in July, or at a
2.2% annual rate, after falling $1.21 billion, or at a 7.3%
annual rate, in June.</p>
<p>Mobile home loans edged up $33 billion, or at a 1.7%
annual rate, after dropping $83 billion, or a 4.3% annual
rate, in June.</p>
<p>A miscellaneous category, which includes vacation loans,
tax loans, education loans and other personal loans, rose
$1.2 billion in July, or at a 7% annual rate, after growing
$753 million in June, a 4.4% annual rate.</p>
<p>At the end of July, consumer installment debt totaled
$726.93 billion, up 4.1% from July 1989.</p>
