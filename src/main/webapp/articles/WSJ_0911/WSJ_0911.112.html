	<p class="article-leader">H.J. Heinz Co. reported that net income in the fiscal
first quarter increased 13% to $143.2 million, or 54 cents a
share.
   The Pittsburgh-based food-products company said it
benefited from price increases in most of its product
categories as well as the strength of foreign currencies
against the dollar -- which makes U.S. products cheaper
overseas.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>In the year-earlier period, the company earned $126.5
million, or 48 cents a share, adjusted for a 2-for-1 stock
split paid Sept. 27 of last year.</p>
<p>Sales for the quarter, ended Aug. 1, rose 7% to $1.56
billion from $1.45 billion a year earlier.</p>
<p>Operating profit rose 12% in the quarter to $232.9 million
from $207.5 million.</p>
