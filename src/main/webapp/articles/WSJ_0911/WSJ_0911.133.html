	<p class="article-leader">Builders Transport Inc. said it is considering a revised
offer to be acquired by Trism Inc. for $9 in cash, $4 in
12-year, 12% cumulative preferred stock, and one-fifth share
of Trism common stock for each of its shares outstanding.
   Builders Transport, a truckload carrier based in Camden,
S.C., said that under the proposal Trism would put $10
million in equity into a new unit that would acquire Builders
Transport. Trism would finance the balance of the transaction
with senior debt and a preferred stock investment from Heller
Financial Inc. and Banque Paribas.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Trism, a privately held New York-based investment company,
previously offered to pay $14 a share in cash and $3 in
cumulative preferred stock for the company. Trism later said
it might revise the proposal of $12 cash and $4 a share in
12-year, 12% cumulative preferred stock, but instead made the
new offer. Builders Transport has about five million shares
outstanding. Builders Transport said that it could not
immediately provide the value of the offer.</p>
<p>Separately, Builders Transport said it agreed to sell its
refrigerated-van operation as part of a restructuring. Terms
weren't disclosed.</p>
<p>Builders Transport also said a Delaware Chancery Court
dismissed a shareholder suit brought by David C. Walentas,
who is currently waging a proxy contest to obtain control of
the board.</p>
