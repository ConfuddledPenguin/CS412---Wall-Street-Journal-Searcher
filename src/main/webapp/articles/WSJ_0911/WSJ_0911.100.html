	<p class="article-leader">CUPERTINO, Calif. -- Tandem Computers Inc. said that its
growth rate might not meet Wall Street expectations, and that
it is implementing cost-cutting measures to preserve its
profit margins.
   Tandem, which makes computers with automatic backup
systems that are used by stock exchanges and banks, among
others, didn't elaborate.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Analysts had been projecting that for its fourth quarter
ending Sept. 30, Tandem would earn about $39 million to $44
million, or 35 to 40 cents a share, on revenue of about $510
million. J. Neil Weintraut, an analyst with Hambrecht & Quist
Inc. in San Francisco, said he trimmed his estimate of
Tandem's fiscal fourth-quarter earnings to 29 cents a share
on revenue of about $480 million. In the fiscal 1989 fourth
quarter, Tandem earned $39.4 million, or 38 cents a share, on
revenue of $456.2 million.</p>
<p>In projecting the downturn, Tandem cited weakness in the
banking industry, a major source of its business. The company
said its revenue is being crimped by high interest rates in
international markets, such as Australia and Britain, as well
as general economic weakness in the U.S., particularly on the
East Coast.</p>
<p>The announcement came after the market closed. In New York
Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, Tandem shares
closed at $13.625, up 12.5 cents.</p>
