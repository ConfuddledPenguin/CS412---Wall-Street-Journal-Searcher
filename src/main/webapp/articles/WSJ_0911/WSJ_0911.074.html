	<p class="article-leader">If I were still practicing law, I would love the
Kennedy-Hawkins Bill -- the so-called "Civil Rights Act of
1990." It may enrich contingency fee lawyers. But it will
also impoverish the principle of equality of all Americans.
All my life, beginning in the darkest days of segregation in
my home state of Georgia, I have fought against the principle
of color preference, then known as "white supremacy." This
bill institutionalizes color preference under the false flag
of civil rights. It is not a civil rights bill. It is a quota
bill that will achieve precisely what the landmark 1964 Civil
Rights Act stood foursquare against.
   Proportionality of result, not equality of opportunity, is
the touchstone of this flawed legislation. It creates a
presumption of guilt based only on crude race or gender
statistical imbalances in the workplace, and then forces
employers to rebut that presumption under a standard of proof
that rules out the pursuit of excellence as a defense and is
very difficult to meet. The cumulative weight of this stacked
deck will make the risk of having the wrong numbers so great
that the employer, in self-defense, will hire by quota.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Contrary to the blandishments of its supporters,
Kennedy-Hawkins rewrites 20 years of civil rights law. It
would do something I never thought I would see in America --
it would make racial, ethnic and sex imbalance alone
presumptively illegal. Under Kennedy-Hawkins, a plaintiff
need only allege a statistical disparity between minorities
in the labor pool and on the job, and charge that the
employer's practices collectively caused the imbalance --
nothing more. Because it effectively eliminates the
requirement that plaintiffs identify a specific
discriminatory practice, the legislation would turn a civil
rights complaint into an indictment without a bill of
particulars.</p>
<p>By effectively making bottom-line statistical imbalances
proof of discrimination (although protesting that it does
not), Kennedy-Hawkins holds employers hostage to raw census
data. Those statistics do not measure individual differences
in skills, experience, training or quality of education
within each job group. But such distinctions do matter: Try
convincing an employer that there's no difference between the
graduates of a third-rate college and those of a first-rate
university.</p>
<p>The bill's faith in the idea that statistical disparities
alone create a presumption of discrimination is equally
flawed. Abraham Lincoln's friend, the former slave Frederick
Douglass, understood the divisive and destructive
implications of the belief that, in a world without
discrimination, there would be racial proportionality in
every human endeavor: "Equality of numbers," he wrote in
1871, "has nothing to do with equality of attainments."</p>
<p>Without the requirement that the plaintiff specifically
charge discrimination, employers must justify every hiring or
promotion practice that might account for the imbalance --
and prove their innocence by rebutting a presumption of guilt
so difficult to overcome and so costly to fight that they
will capitulate and hire by numbers.</p>
<p>The proposed standard requires the employer to demonstrate
that every one of his hiring or promotion criteria "bear{s} a
significant relationship to successful performance of the
job" by means of "demonstrable evidence." How many employers
can "prove" that their hiring criteria -- whether they be
standardized tests, job interviews, written or oral skills,
education or experience -- definitively correlate with
successful job performance? Could a Supreme Court justice
prove by "demonstrable evidence" -- whatever that means -- a
"significant relationship" -- whatever that means -- between
law review experience and successful performance as a Supreme
Court clerk -- especially when seeking out the best is no
defense? Could a college faculty show that tenure track
candidates who publish articles always make better teachers
or advance the cause of knowledge?</p>
<p>Under this test, merit and high standards go out the
window, impairing not only the principle of American equality
but, inevitably, American efficiency and productivity.
Together, the bill's presumption of guilt and its high hurdle
of proof will force employers to avoid lawsuits and potential
liability by hiring and promoting by quota.</p>
<p>Kennedy-Hawkins wages war on objective standards at a time
when this society can least afford a lesser measure of
achievement. Objective criteria may not be perfect; some may
mask discriminatory intent, or have little relation to the
job. But Kennedy-Hawkins wields a bludgeon where a scalpel
would do. Existing law already walks the fine line between
protecting standards and weeding out potentially
discriminatory criteria. The Supreme Court's 1989 Ward's Cove
v. Atonio decision, the case Kennedy-Hawkins would overturn,
already demands an exacting standard of business necessity:
Why fix it if it's not broken?</p>
<p>But the social costs of a quota bill go beyond loss of
productivity and efficiency. It balkanizes and tribalizes our
nation by raising the color line; it stigmatizes and
demoralizes those it supposedly helps. Kennedy-Hawkins may be
a middle-class minority ride to preferential treatment; but
it won't solve our real minority problems. It won't help
fight the crack epidemic ravaging our minority youth; it
won't stem the tide of unwed minority teen pregnancies; it
won't stop the breakdown of our inner-city education system.</p>
<p>Congress and this administration have the opportunity,
perhaps more than any other in recent years, to forge a new
and lasting civil rights consensus. Every opinion poll
confirms that the vast majority of Americans of all races
share the goals of equal opportunity and color blindness and
will support the vision of Martin Luther King, who urged that
we judge ourselves "not by the color of our skin but by the
content of our character." Let's not miss this chance by
endorsing a quota bill.</p>
