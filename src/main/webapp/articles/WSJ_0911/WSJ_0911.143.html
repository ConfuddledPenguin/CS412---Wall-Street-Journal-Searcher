	<p class="article-leader">Rising above downtown Atlanta is what John Portman hopes
will be his crowning achievement: an unfinished, tower of
granite and glass that is meant once and for all to quiet the
critics who have for years reviled his hulking, atrium-style
hotels and corporate centers.
   The 65-year-old developer and architect of such projects
as the Embarcadero Center in San Francisco and the Mariott
Marquis hotel in New York's Times Square has dreamed of
building this tower for 25 years.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>So anxious has he been to complete the dream design for
what he calls One Peachtree Center that he unveiled it
several years ago before he had either financing or an anchor
tenant. He produced a coffee table book featuring likenesses
of the structure before he had even started building it.</p>
<p>To finance construction of the $300 million skyscraper, he
personally guaranteed a loan of $78 million as equity.
(Citicorp provided the entire $378 million in loans.) He also
took tenants for the planned 60-story structure away from
other buildings he had developed nearby.</p>
<p>Now, there are signs that Mr. Portman's financial empire
may be crumbling. And some developers and lenders say One
Peachtree Center is looking less like a monument to Mr.
Portman than a monumental folly.</p>
<p>Already, Mr. Portman has missed a $3 million loan
repayment to DG Bank Deutsche Genossenschaftsbank, which has
filed suit to collect. He has been in emergency meetings with
many of his 22 creditors to restructure the collateral on
more than $2 billion of loans. And as of Sept. 1, he stopped
making payments to Equitable Life Assurances Society of the
U.S. on a $333 million mortgage covering another of Mr.
Portman's projects in Atlanta, called Peachtree Center, which
opened in 1970.</p>
<p>Though Mr. Portman says the missed mortgage payment to
Equitable is just a temporary "technical" glitch, he is also
missing payments on tens of millions of dollars of personal
lines of credit with a number of lenders. Those funds have
been helping pay for the Portman Cos.' operations on three
continents.</p>
<p>Sitting in his Peachtree Center office yesterday,
surrounded by his own abstract paintings, two advisers and
his son, Jack, Mr. Portman insisted in an interview that his
business is still more than solvent.</p>
<p>Mr. Portman says he's in "friendly" negotiations with
Equitable on a broad financial package covering the Peachtree
Center property, which he says isn't facing a cash flow
shortage.</p>
<p>He blames the savings and loan crisis and the overbuilt
real estate market for sparking panic among his unsecured
lenders -- one that he insists isn't warranted in his case.</p>
<p>His unsecured lenders, he says, "for the first time in 10
years" called their lines of credit for payment this summer,
rather than revolving those loans as usual and accepting
repayment at the end of the year. With insufficient cash on
hand, Mr. Portman says, he and his advisers are trying to put
together a collateral pool comprised of future cash flows and
his interests in various real estate partnerships. If the
lenders approve their plan, the pool will serve as security
for the lines of credit, and the spigot of cash will continue
to flow.</p>
<p>"We came into 1990, and suddenly real estate is a bad
word," quips Mr. Portman.</p>
<p>Citicorp and Equitable declined to comment. The unsecured
lenders all either couldn't be reached or declined to
comment.</p>
<p>Kenneth Leventhal, the work-out specialist who helped
restructure Donald Trump's troubled finances and who is
assisting Mr. Portman with his, says lenders are cooperating
so far.</p>
<p>But executives close to Portman Cos. say additional
collateral may be more difficult to come by than Mr.
Leventhal suggests. Though Mr. Portman still owns large
equity positions in several of his successful developments,
most of those assets have already been refinanced and pledged
as collateral to mortgage holders. With real estate values
falling, they say, it may be difficult to convince creditors
that Mr. Portman's holdings are worth more than the mortgages
on many of the properties.</p>
<p>While Mr. Portman may not be as big as Donald Trump or as
far-flung as Trammell Crow, he has had widespread influence.
While his atrium-style hotels and giant centers like
Embarcadero and the Renaissance Center in Detroit have been
generally panned by critics, they have been major hits with
the public and much copied by other builders, lending
credence to his claim as "the people's architect."</p>
<p>Mr. Portman has never been embraced by the business and
social elite in Atlanta. Part of the reason Mr. Portman
failed to launch One Peachtree Center any earlier is that he
couldn't get any of Atlanta's businesses to be his anchor
tenant. Since the mid-1960's, he had shown variations of the
signature skyscraper proposal to some of Atlanta's biggest
employers, including Coca-Cola, AT&T, and most recently,
First Atlanta Bank. But all, for various reasons, turned him
down.</p>
<p>His summer place at Sea Island, Ga., an unusual,
museum-like chain of several atriums called Entelechy II,
packed with his own art, appalled many of the elite
homeowners on the island who found it obtrusive.</p>
<p>"You've got to remember, this is the antebellum South,"
Mr. Portman says.</p>
<p>The cause of the cash crunch that is pinching Mr. Portman
and his Portman Cos. is similar to that which recently
brought Donald Trump to the brink of bankruptcy. Like Mr.
Trump, Mr. Portman gorged on easy credit in the 1980s. In the
past five years, he refinanced nearly $1 billion of mortgages
on his many large properties, and used the proceeds, with
more than $600 million of fresh loans, to finance a building
spree.</p>
<p>He built a hotel and an apparel mart in San Francisco, a
triple-tower trade center in Shanghai, and two office
buildings, two wholesale marts, an athletic club, a hotel,
and a suburban office park in Atlanta -- in addition to the
office tower now in progress.</p>
<p>But many of the recent projects have fared poorly, in part
due to the national real estate glut hurting all developers.
In recent years, Mr. Portman added to his mart empire by
building or expanding four wholesale marts at a cost of $500
million in borrowed funds.</p>
<p>But both his Atlanta apparel mart, which has doubled in
size in the past three years, and his newer San Francisco
mart remain less than 70% occupied. Meanwhile, traffic in
apparel marts is declining nationwide, because their primary
customers, small clothing retailers, are going through an
industry shakeout.</p>
<p>In addition to the cash drain from managing and marketing
the marts, Mr. Portman has a $140 million construction loan
due next year on the Atlanta mart's expansion. If problems
persist, that loan may be difficult to refinance.</p>
<p>"Boy, I bet they're sorry they doubled their space," says
Dorothy Fuller, director of the Chicago Apparel Center, owned
by Joseph P. Kennedy Enterprises.</p>
<p>Moreover, Mr. Portman faces severe problems in his new,
$150 million technology mart in Atlanta, which sits
two-thirds empty.</p>
<p>But his other marts, Mr. Portman says, which house
showrooms for the carpet, furniture and gift industries, are
thriving, as is his trade-show promotion company, the third
largest in the U.S. And Mr. Portman maintains it's only a
matter of time until the apparel and technology marts come
around, too. "Marts are among our most successful
businesses," he says.</p>
<p>Mr. Portman lost roughly $50 million on an aborted attempt
to launch the first of what was to be his own line of pricey
hotels, beginning with the former Portman Hotel in San
Francisco. The hotel was built in 1987 and is one of the only
buildings Mr. Portman has ever sold. He received roughly $100
million for it, or about the size of the construction loan
outstanding on the project.</p>
<p>Lost were about $25 million in cost overruns and about the
same amount in operating shortfalls. Mr. Portman says the
hotel's problems were numerous, but basically, guests weren't
willing to pay $200 per night and up for the lavish service
he was trying to provide.</p>
<p>And Mr. Portman has launched a risky foray into the
Atlanta suburban office market, taking on high carrying costs
on land that is undevelopable in the current market.</p>
<p>Though Mr. Portman's problems are similar to those of
other debt-laden developers in today's market, they're also
different. As a hybrid architect-developer, Mr. Portman has
always operated on the premise that his superior designs can
make projects work that otherwise wouldn't seem to make
sense. That's exactly what he accomplished with the Atlanta
Hyatt Regency. When the building was finished in 1967, many
hotel experts scoffed at its soaring atrium, which looked
wasteful. But the public loved the vibrant expanse, and the
Regency's atrium style became one of the most emulated hotel
designs of the century, sparking a new standard of downtown
chic.</p>
<p>Developers who know Mr. Portman well, however, say his
faith in the power of his own designs -- and his
determination to win over his many critics in the
architecture world before retiring -- can also lead to bad
decisions. That's what happened with One Peachtree Center,
many Atlantans say.</p>
<p>For years, Mr. Portman's career has been dogged by a
dichotomy. Though people have flocked to his giant complexes
in Atlanta, New York, Detroit and San Francisco -- helping
revitalize the central cities and making Mr. Portman one of
the nation's most successful developers -- architecture
critics have reviled his work.</p>
<p>In Detroit, a reviewer for the Detroit News once wrote
that the Portman-designed Renaissance Center evoked "a sense
of imprisonment." The New York Times' architecture critic
called Mr. Portman's tourist-mobbed Mariott Marquis on Times
Square, "bombastic." And guidebook-writer Arthur Frommer
labeled his bustling hotels in Atlanta's Peachtree Center,
"fortresses with forbidding walls."</p>
<p>The new tower in Atlanta, slated for completion in 1992,
is Mr. Portman's answer to critics. Designs call for
surrounding the granite and glass structure with trees,
fountains and open spaces -- features that are normally found
inside a Portman project.</p>
<p>The building will have "a quality and uniqueness
indigenous to our time," Mr. Portman says.</p>
<p>But is the time right? While the office-vacancy rate in
Atlanta indicates otherwise, Mr. Portman's damn-the-torpedoes
attitude may have been spurred on by territorialism more than
anything else, according to local developers. Over the last
several years, a slew of big-name architects, including John
Burgee, Philip Johnson and Kevin Roche have designed
buildings for Atlanta. Mr. Portman wouldn't be edged out of
his own backyard, they say.</p>
<p>"You've got some world-class stuff going up down there,
and I think John's response was that he can do that, too,"
says C. Mack Taylor, an old friend and a partner in Taylor &
Mathis Real Estate, a large Atlanta-based firm.</p>
<p>Taylor & Mathis itself is one of two developers that have
killed their own plans for downtown towers. The firm had
lease commitments for 63% of its $280 million building. But
the 1.15 million-square-foot project was scuttled earlier
this year when financing costs rose and effective rents kept
plummeting.</p>
<p>"People aren't willing to pay for premier space in today's
market," sighs Mr. Taylor.</p>
<p>The office vacancy rate in downtown Atlanta is now at 16%
and rising. New vacancies exceed new leases by some 1,500
square feet a day, according to Coldwell Banker Commercial
Group Inc., creating the dreaded condition known in the real
estate industry as "negative absorption." Brokers only expect
the market to worsen, as One Peachtree Center and two other
large towers add 3.6 million square feet, or 31% more space,
to the market by 1993.</p>
<p>"Most people say One Peachtree probably shouldn't have
been built," says Randy Garfield Jr., an assistant vice
president with Coldwell Banker Commercial. "But it's like
turning a ship at sea. Was he too far along?"</p>
<p>Says another developer who has worked closely with Mr.
Portman: "John wanted to prove something to the world."</p>
