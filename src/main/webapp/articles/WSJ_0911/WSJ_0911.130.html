	<p class="article-leader">VILNIUS, Lithuania -- The final round of the so-called 4 +
2 talks on German unification is scheduled to get under way
tomorrow in Moscow. After 45 years, the end of the postwar
division of that nation and of Europe is at hand. Yet the
fact that the session could set down some of the essential
conditions for a long-delayed World War II peace treaty has
alarmed the recently elected leaders of the Baltic states.
They fear nothing less than a second Molotov-Ribbentrop
sell-out.
   The Council of the Baltic States, comprising the heads of
the Baltic governments and parliaments, will hold a news
conference in Moscow today at which it will express a "deep
concern that the resolution of the German question may be
held to be the final step in the liquidation of the
consequences of World War II, and that the fate of the
Republic of Estonia, the Republic of Latvia, and the Republic
of Lithuania will once again be decided without the knowledge
of our Peoples." If that should happen, of course, the U.S.
would be a party to it, as would Britain and France.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Vytautas Landsbergis, president of Lithuania's Supreme
Council, told me in an interview a few days ago that from the
point of view of the Baltic states, a formal reunification of
Germany is by no means the end of the World War II story.
"Three countries are still the victims of that war," Mr.
Landsbergis asserts. "The Baltic countries have not regained
their independence as promised in the Atlantic Charter."</p>
<p>While he doesn't think the Moscow meeting is likely to
produce a final peace treaty, Mr. Landsbergis fears
agreements that might involve "the principle of not changing
borders between Germany and Eastern countries, including the
Soviet Union. If these statements would purport to fix the
Soviet Union's borders, it would be a new Munich. It would
not necessarily have to be recognition of the annexation --
that would be inconceivable. But it could be done in some
indirect way, and this is our problem."</p>
<p>Mr. Landsbergis worries that the U.S. in its desire to get
Soviet cooperation in the Gulf crisis could overlook the
interests of the Baltic states. In fact, he is concerned that
Sunday's meeting between Presidents Bush and Gorbachev may
have already prepared the ground for such a deal. The Balts
take little comfort from the lukewarm support of the West for
their sovereignty drives. They are sure of one thing only,
that the Kremlin will try to derail their efforts.</p>
<p>The West's attitude nevertheless could be critical. Mr.
Landsbergis believes that when Western governments sternly
warned Mr. Gorbachev not to use force in his showdown with
Lithuania earlier this year, they tipped the scale in the
republic's favor. But Mr. Landsbergis doesn't disguise his
disappointment that the West fails to use its leverage more.</p>
<p>"Western recognition of our governments and the
establishment of diplomatic contacts is what we would
prefer," he says. "That could worsen the West's diplomatic
contacts with the Soviet Union a little. But we think that
the West is too careful; too careful, not to risk any
complications with the Soviets. They could push the Soviets
back more strongly, because the Soviets are collapsing and
are pulling back from all conquests and this pull-back could
include the Baltics."</p>
<p>The Kremlin has called off its economic blockade, which
had turned out to be at least seven times as costly for the
Soviet Union as for Lithuania in ruble terms. But it has
resorted to more subtle tactics to prevent Baltic
independence. There is much evidence of attempts at delaying,
distracting and dividing the states in their determined
campaign for independence.</p>
<p>Lithuania agreed to defuse the crisis with the Kremlin by
accepting a moratorium on its March 11 declaration of
sovereignty, for example. But the moratorium was linked to
the start of negotiations on sovereignty. A deadline for the
talks has passed, and the Baltic states are waiting, perhaps
in vain, for the Soviet side to respond to an initial
protocol for negotiations delivered to the Kremlin a month
ago. Amid growing opposition in the republics by those who
fear that their leaders may accept less than full
independence, the Baltic Council last week asked for a
meeting between Baltic leaders and Mr. Gorbachev.</p>
<p>Overt blackmail is again part of the Soviet strategy.
"They are threatening us," Mr. Landsbergis says. "Either we
accept the central government's proposals on a union treaty
or we can look forward to a winter without supplies of energy
and fuel." The proposed treaty, which is purported to make
secession possible, is really a trap in that it sets
obstacles in the way of secession; the only way to escape the
trap is not to sign the treaty at all. That, according to
Lithuanian parliamentarians, is the intention of the Baltic
states.</p>
<p>The Kremlin's economic blackmail is combined with some
apparently artificial shortages of consumer products.
Gasoline supplies are spotty. Sugar is limited to one kilo a
month per person, soap to one cake and wine to one liter.
Such products, made and distributed by the state, are turning
up on black markets at sharply higher prices.</p>
<p>The KGB and Moscow have attempted to establish alternative
government institutions in Lithuania, Mr. Landsbergis says,
"especially at the prosecutorial level. But they don't
succeed. The so-called general prosecutor sent by Moscow is
entirely isolated. And, Moscow's attempt to present the
Lithuanian Communist Party as a real political force is
simply not serious -- without monetary and political support
from Moscow it would just disappear."</p>
<p>"The KGB and central institutions are very much interested
in destabilizing the situation in Lithuania," Mr. Landsbergis
believes. "They are trying to sharpen national differences
among the Baltic peoples and among Russians, Poles and
Ukrainians. The official press and radio broadcasts from
military bases disseminate much disinformation." They are not
so successful here as they have been in areas such as the
South Central republics, he says, and the new governments
have much support among non-Baltic residents.</p>
<p>As examples of disinformation, Mr. Landsbergis shows
newspaper clippings that paint even czarist Russia as having
been kind to non-Russian peoples in the empire, without a
trace of attempts at Russification in the Baltics. But even
young Lithuanians know better. A 21-year-old cites an
infamous and failed attempt in czarist times to force the use
of the Cyrillic alphabet in Lithuanian literature. All
recognize the cynicism of communists who turned a Vilnius
Roman Catholic church into a museum for atheism while they
allowed the communist-controlled Russian Orthodox Church to
build new churches.</p>
<p>Cultures seldom succumb to persecution; indeed, they are
often fortified by the attempt. Lithuanian partisans were the
last to give up armed resistance to Stalin's domination,
fighting into the 1950s. The family history of almost every
living Lithuanian includes imprisonment, deportation or
murder at the hands of communists.</p>
<p>Balts are not asking the West to do their fighting for
them today, either. They are simply demanding that the World
War II Allies cut no deals over their heads. As the Baltic
Council's statement argues, the fate of the three republics
"is not an internal matter of the U.S.S.R."</p>
