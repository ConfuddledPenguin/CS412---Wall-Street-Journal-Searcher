   Reshape Metro Areas</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>DENVER and Washington have been strong "magnet" areas for
baby boomers.</p>
<p>As part of a broad study of metropolitan America for the
Population Reference Bureau, University of Michigan
sociologist William Frey picked out those metropolitan areas
experiencing extra-large gains or losses in baby boom
population. He defines magnet areas as those with the highest
proportion of men and women ages 21 to 40 in their total 1985
population and at least a 9.5% increase in this age group
from 1980 to 1985, the latest year for which such detailed
figures are available.</p>
<p>As of 1985, he calculates, almost one-third of
metropolitan Denver's population consisted of adult boomers,
and their number had grown more than 14% in the first half of
the 1980s.</p>
<p>The Washington and Houston areas ranked just behind, with
adult boomers constituting 31% of their 1985 population.
Filling out the top 10 magnet list were the metropolitan
areas of Austin, Texas; Atlanta; San Francisco; Dallas;
Colorado Springs, Colo.; Portsmouth, N.H.; and Las Vegas,
Nev. Adult boomers accounted for anywhere from 27% to 30% of
their 1985 population. Of all the top 10 areas, Atlanta and
Dallas registered the biggest gains in boomers from 1980 to
1985, almost a 20% increase in each case.</p>
<p>Mr. Frey notes that most magnet areas are important
service centers with good job opportunities and attractive
life styles. He concedes that both Denver and Houston may
have slipped in the ratings since 1985 because of
energy-industry problems, but doubts they have dropped from
the top 10 in percentage of boomers in their population.</p>
<p>The 10 top boomer losers -- with the smallest proportion
of adult boomers in their total population and a boomer
exodus from 1980 to 1985 of at least 5% -- were old
industrial areas, such as Scranton-Wilkes Barre, Pa.;
Buffalo, N.Y.; Johnstown, Pa.; and Youngstown, Ohio. Adult
boomers accounted for only 21% to 23% of the population of
these 10 areas, and from 1980 to 1985, the number of boomers
in a few districts fell as much as 15%.</p>
<p>Higher Outlays Backed</p>
<p>For Kids' Health Care</p>
<p>CHILD HEALTH emerges as a matter of increasing public
concern.</p>
<p>A recent nationwide survey by the National Association of
Children's Hospitals finds three in five Americans believing
U.S. children today are worse off than five years ago; a
whopping 29% believes kids are "much worse" off. Asked
specifically whether the U.S. should spend more on children's
health care, 71% answer affirmatively while only 20% think
the country can't afford it. A surprising 59% say they would
favor a $100-a-year tax increase earmarked for better health
care for uninsured poor children.</p>
<p>The poll found women more likely than men to say
children's situation has worsened, but the two genders
equally favor spending more on children's health. Even among
self-identified conservatives, three in five support greater
spending in this field.</p>
<p>The association and other child advocacy groups are
launching an "I Care for Kids" campaign to make child health
care a bigger issue in coming elections.</p>
<p>Racial Gap Shrinks</p>
<p>On Premarital Sex</p>
<p>PREMARITAL SEX becomes ever more common, according to a
1988 government survey of women 15 to 44.</p>
<p>Nearly three-fourths, 72.4% to be exact, indicate they
began their sexual experience in nonmarital relations,
"continuing a long-term trend since at least the late 1950s,"
says William Pratt of the National Center for Health
Statistics. In the previous, 1982 survey, the figure was
64.7%.</p>
<p>The recent rise has occurred mainly among white women. At
each age, higher proportions of black women report premarital
sex experience, but this has long been true. Now, says Mr.
Pratt, the black and white patterns are converging.</p>
<p>Sixteen percent of the 1988 respondents say they were
married when having their first intercourse, while 12% hadn't
yet had sexual experience.</p>
<p>Along with the rise in premarital sex, the survey shows
another drop in age at first intercourse -- two out of five
had begun sex before they were 18 -- and an increase in the
time between first intercourse and marriage. The almost
inevitable result is a rise in the number of women who have
had multiple partners and in the number of partners each has
had.</p>
<p>Another survey, however, offers a different perspective.
Writing in Society magazine, Tom Smith and colleagues from
the University of Chicago's National Opinion Research Center
report that the vast majority of Americans are monogamous, in
the sense of having had only one sexual partner, married or
unmarried, during the preceding year. Only 18% of all
sexually active adults in a large 1988 sampling weren't
monogamous under this definition. Even among unmarried men
under 30, almost half specified only one sex partner during
the previous 12 months.</p>
<p>Odds and Ends</p>
<p>OVER HALF of black children under 18 and nearly one-third
of Hispanic children live with only one parent, the Census
Bureau reports. This compares with 19% of white children. . .
. High school seniors who don't intend to go to college are
twice as likely to become smokers as those planning to go,
say Ingrid Waldron of the University of Pennsylvania and
Diane Lye of the University of Washington. They suggest that
for the non-college-bound, smoking may compensate for lack of
satisfaction in school status.</p>
