	<p class="article-leader">BRITISH TRIAL</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The British shipping company P&O European Ferries and
seven former employees denied manslaughter charges at the
start of their trial stemming from a ferry disaster that
killed 193 people.</p>
<p>The trial follows a police investigation into the
capsizing of the ferry Herald of Free Enterprise as it left
the Belgian port of Zeebrugge March 6, 1987. The company,
three officials and four crew members are accused of
unlawfully killing just one passenger, Alison Joy Gaillard,
27, selected to represent those who died.</p>
<p>The seven men and the company pleaded not guilty to the
charges.</p>
<p>Manslaughter carries a maximum sentence of life
imprisonment; the company faces an unlimited fine if found
guilty. The trial could last up to five months.</p>
<p>PORTUGUESE AIR FARES UP</p>
<p>The Portuguese government increased domestic air fares by
some 10% yesterday, citing rising oil prices. A one-way
economy fare between Lisbon and the southern resort of Faro
rose 9.5%, to 10,400 escudos (about $75). Economy rates
between the capital and the northern city of Oporto rose by
the same margin to 11,500 escudos. Air fares between mainland
Portugal and the Atlantic islands of Madeira and the Azores
were unchanged.</p>
<p>INDONESIAN PETROCHEMICALS</p>
<p>A new Indonesian company, PT Chandra Asri, signed an
agreement to invest $2.4 billion in a complex to produce
olefins, which are petrochemical byproducts used in making
plastics. The signing increases doubts that a previously
proposed $1.7 billion olefins project involving Royal
Dutch/Shell Group and Indonesia's Bimantara Citra Group will
go ahead. Shell and its Indonesian partners haven't been able
to agree on shareholding arrangements. Analysts said that if
the Shell-Bimantara deal falls through, either Bimantara or
its chairman, Bambang Trihatmodjo, a son of President
Suharto, could play an equity or other role in the Chandra
Asri development.</p>
<p>PIZZA HUTS FOR MOSCOW, BEIJING</p>
<p>With the Soviet Union's first two Pizza Huts scheduled to
open in Moscow today, China's first Pizza Hut opened
yesterday in Beijing and served 200 pizzas to an
invitation-only crowd of Chinese and foreigners before
running out of dough. In the future, the two-story, 180-seat
restaurant expects to serve about 285 pizzas daily, mainly to
foreign tourists and foreign residents of Beijing. But the
company also hopes to attract Chinese customers, not yet used
to pizza.</p>
<p>SPECULATION IN BRAZIL</p>
<p>Brazilian President Fernando Collor de Mello blamed
speculators for high prices and called for a "national
dialogue" to reduce inflation. "High prices still exist in
some sectors, due to a perverse combination of inflationary
memory and speculation," Mr. Collor said in a nationally
broadcast speech. "Save. Buy only essentials. Haggle," he
urged. When Mr. Collor took office in March, prices were
rising more than 80% a month; in August, monthly inflation
was 10.5%.</p>
<p>SANYO-SIEMENS LINK</p>
<p>Sanyo Electric Co. said it would start marketing next
April in Japan selected consumer electric products made by
Siemens AG of West Germany. Officials of the Japanese company
said Sanyo would sell four Siemens products -- refrigerators,
dishwashers, washing machines and stoves -- as part of its
system kitchens. The marketing tie-up will help Siemens
establish a toehold in Japan while at the same time help
Sanyo bolster sales of its system kitchens by incorporating
the German-made equipment, which Sanyo officials say is in
strong demand in Japan.</p>
<p>TECHNOLOGY FOR SOUTH KOREA</p>
<p>South Korean companies are beginning to use Soviet
technology for commercial applications.</p>
<p>Samil Pharmaceutical Co., a midsized South Korean medicine
company, plans to introduce by the end of this year in South
Korea a patented Soviet technology for measuring cholesterol.
An official at Samsung Co., the Korean agent for
Licensintorg, a Soviet government agency handling technology
trade with foreign companies, said the Samil deal is the
first of about 15 that combine Soviet technology with South
Korean manufacturing.</p>
<p>Licensintorg took hundreds of patented Soviet technologies
to South Korea for commercial applications during a Soviet
trade show in Seoul earlier this year.</p>
<p>The Soviet Union and South Korea are expected to establish
formal diplomatic relations within two months, Seoul's state
radio said yesterday.</p>
<p>POSTSCRIPTS . . .</p>
<p>Chinese Vice President Wang Zhen marked National Teachers'
Day yesterday with a call to resist foreign and domestic
plots to implant democracy in China. The People's Daily
newspaper carried a letter written by Mr. Wang calling on
primary and middle-school teachers to improve the "quality of
political thinking" by teaching Marxism and Maoist thought. .
. . South Korea's Constitution Court, which rules on the
constitutionality of laws, determined yesterday that the
country's prohibition of adultery is constitutional. "It is
imperative that adultery remain outlawed to protect the
existing marital system and harmonious family life and
prevent social harms that might be caused by it," the ruling
said.</p>
