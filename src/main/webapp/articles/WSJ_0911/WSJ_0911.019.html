	<p class="article-leader">CHICAGO -- UAL Corp. said August traffic at its United
Airlines unit increased 10.1%, to 7.87 billion revenue
passenger miles, from the year-earlier 7.15 billion.
   A revenue passenger mile is one paying passenger flown one
mile.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The August figure represented the "best monthly traffic in
United's history," the company said. "Unfortunately," UAL
added, "the cost of providing the services also is escalating
sharply with the dramatic increase in jet fuel prices."</p>
<p>Load factor, or percentage of seats filled, was 75.3% in
the latest month, off from the year-earlier 77.3%.</p>
<p>For the year to date, United traffic has increased 8.3% to
51.04 billion revenue passenger miles, from 47.15 billion.
Year-to-date load factor held steady at 67.6% overall,
although the load factor on North American flights slipped to
65% from 66.6%.</p>
