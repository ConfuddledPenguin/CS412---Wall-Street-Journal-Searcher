	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- After nearly a year of futile efforts to sell
its 20% stake in the ESPN sports channel, RJR Nabisco Inc.
may have found a buyer in Hearst Corp., which already is a
partner in two cable channels with ESPN's majority owner,
Capital Cities/ABC Inc.
   But although talks between Hearst and RJR are under way,
no agreement has been reached, and a final sale price may
fall well below the $250 million that debt-laden RJR Nabisco
had originally sought. People familiar with the discussions,
reported yesterday in Advertising Age magazine, said Hearst
may end up paying $180 million to $200 million for the 20%
interest if the sale goes through.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Hearst executives couldn't be reached, and RJR declined to
comment. Herb Granath, president of Capital Cities/ABC's
cable division, declined to comment on any discussions,
saying it was a matter for RJR and Hearst. But he did say
Hearst would make sense as a partner. "We've been together in
other ventures, so this would be somewhat logical," he said.</p>
<p>Separately, ESPN promoted its No. 2 executive, Steven
Bornstein, to succeed Roger L. Werner Jr. as president and
chief executive officer of the sports channel. Mr. Werner
resigned last week to head up a new regional-sports venture
owned by cable investor Bill Daniels.</p>
<p>ESPN has been enormously successful, reaching 61% of the
nation's cable homes. The cable network earned upward of $125
million in pretax profit last year, though profit this year
is expected to fall to $90 million because of losses on the
channel's first season of high-cost major league baseball
games. RJR Nabisco has been frustrated in finding a buyer for
its piece of ESPN because the stake carries no management
authority or even a guarantee of an annual dividend.</p>
<p>Those areas are under the sole control of Capital
Cities/ABC, which owns the other 80% of ESPN. A litany of
prospective bidders -- including such Japanese concerns as
Sumitomo Group -- have expressed interest in owning the
smaller stake but have balked at those terms.</p>
<p>But Hearst officials are less fretful over such matters,
given their current relationship with Capital Cities/ABC.
Hearst owns about one-third of the Arts & Entertainment
channel, in which Capital Cities/ ABC holds a 38% stake and
General Electric Co.'s NBC network owns the remainder. Hearst
also owns about one-third of Lifetime, in which Capital
Cities/ABC holds one-third ownership and Viacom Inc. holds
the remaining chunk.</p>
