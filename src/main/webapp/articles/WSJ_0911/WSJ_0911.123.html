	<p class="article-leader">LORAL Corp. (New York) -- Standard & Poor's Corp. said it
lowered its ratings on about $410 million of this defense
electronic company's debt and removed Loral's ratings from
its CreditWatch surveillance list. The rating concern
downgraded Loral's senior debt to triple-B from
triple-B-plus, and subordinated debt to triple-B-minus from
triple-B. S&P cited Loral's increased financial risk from its
pending acquisition of the Ford Aerospace unit of Ford Motor
Co. Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc., an American Express Co.
unit, will hold a 49% stake in the unit, Loral has said.
Initially, Loral will contribute about $150 million to the
new entity, funded mainly by borrowings, S&P said. Loral also
will have the option to increase its Ford Aerospace
ownership, which could require significant additional funds
over time.</p>
