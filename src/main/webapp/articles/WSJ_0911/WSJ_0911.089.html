	<p class="article-leader">FOXBORO, Mass. -- Moving quickly after completing its
$656.4 million acquisition of Foxboro Corp., Siebe PLC said
it plans to fire 1,600 Foxboro employees, or nearly 25% of
the work force.
   Foxboro, a maker of industrial controls, had been
unprofitable in three of the last five years. After the
company put itself up for sale earlier this year, Siebe, a
Windsor, U.K., engineering concern, won the bid at a price
that many analysts called surprisingly high.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>A Foxboro spokesman said that about 800 of the firings
will be among the 4,000 employees in Massachusetts, a state
already battered by downturns in high technology, defense and
construction. In addition, Siebe said that Gary K. Willis,
Foxboro president and chief executive officer, was fired.</p>
<p>The remainder of the firings will be at Foxboro facilities
around the world, including one in England.</p>
