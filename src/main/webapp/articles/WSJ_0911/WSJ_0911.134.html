	<p class="article-leader">MONTREAL -- BCE Inc., giving up for good on the energy
business, said it agreed to sell its 48.8% stake in
TransCanada PipeLines Ltd. for about C$1.3 billion ($1.1
billion) to a group of Canadian investment dealers for
subsequent sale to the public.
   A BCE spokesman said the company decided to take advantage
of an opportunity to sell TransCanada "because it really
isn't consistent with our core" telecommunications and
financial services businesses.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The spokesman added that a number of BCE subsidiaries have
heavy capital spending programs under way and so does
TransCanada. Disposing of its stake in the Calgary, Alberta,
pipeline company will free resources for a push into overseas
telecommunications markets, the spokesman said.</p>
<p>TransCanada said that BCE's sale of its stake won't hurt
the pipeline concern's ability to raise funds for its
projects. "We are quite confident of our ability to complete
our pipeline projects," TransCanada said in a statement.</p>
<p>The sale marks the end of Montreal-based BCE's current
effort to slim down. In a similar transaction, BCE disposed
of most its stake in oil and gas concern Encor Inc. earlier
this year. BCE also abandoned a disastrous foray into the
real estate business earlier this year when it wrote off its
stake in BCE Development Corp.</p>
<p>In a two-step transaction BCE said it will sell 37,500,000
units at C$17.00 a unit, or a total of C$637.5 million, to a
group of 10 Canadian investment dealers.</p>
<p>Each unit will consist of one TransCanada share and a
warrant to purchase one TransCanada share from BCE at C$17.50
until Dec. 15, 1992. If all the warrants are exercized BCE
will receive an additional C$656.3 million. BCE said the
units won't be offered in the U.S.</p>
<p>In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday,
TransCanada closed at $14.375, down 25 cents. BCE's
announcement of the sale of its stake was made following the
market's close.</p>
<p>The investment dealers will pay for the units in two
parts. A first payment of C$328.1 million will be made on
closing of the transaction in October. The remaining C$309.4
million is payable by Oct. 1, 1991.</p>
<p>BCE said it will realize a pretax gain of about C$147
million (C$119 million after tax) on the sale of the units
and will realize a similar gain if all the warrants are
exercised.</p>
<p>Also, BCE said the transaction will have an ongoing
favorable impact on its earnings, but a spokesman declined to
quantify that impact. BCE said the proceeds of the sale will
be used principally to reduce short-term debt.</p>
<p>TransCanada and BCE said the 10 underwriters agreed to
seek a wide distribution for the shares.</p>
