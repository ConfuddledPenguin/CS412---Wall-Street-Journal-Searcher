	<p class="article-leader">New York -- Years ago, when I first began writing about
the opera for this paper, I used to sit behind the music
critic from the New York Post, who invariably beat me to the
door. We never talked much, but I did notice that nobody
could run and write as fast as Speight Jenkins. He broke all
speed records escaping Fatlinde and her friends, and one day
just never came back.
   He went to Seattle in 1983. Even more enviable, he became
general director of the Seattle Opera, in a startling
transformation that keeps many of his onetime colleagues
eyeing the Met whenever the top job becomes available, which
has been rather often these days. Reports filtering back
suggested Mr. Jenkins was achieving worthy things in his new
home, including an adventurous "Ring" cycle.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Just how well Mr. Jenkins has been doing in Seattle was
evident when the company staged Prokofiev's "War and Peace"
in July. Featuring a huge Soviet-American cast, the staging
by Francesca Zambello with sets by John Conklin, reached the
level of excellence you would like to see more often in New
York. Seattle had to add an extra performance to contain the
crowds; critics slowed their pace to the doors and wrote
contented stories about this massively challenging $2.5
million undertaking, which suggested, at least to visitors
from Back East, that the torture of travel was a small price
to pay to escape the torture of tedium.</p>
<p>As the Russian people pressed triumphantly to the ramparts
to sing of their victory over the invading Napoleon, you did
not wish the opera to end. And in a way it didn't, thanks to
an Australian-born high-risk pregnancy doctor and an American
music-video promoter. Both convinced a dubious Mr. Jenkins
that what they really wanted to do with every penny they had
was to make a high-definition tape of "War and Peace."</p>
<p>A few months ago, Mr. Jenkins had never heard of
high-definition television (HD). As the owner of a box that
predates remote control, I wasn't much better informed. So
the other day I went down to Rebo Studio in New York to see
why Mr. Jenkins was so excited about his HD "War and Peace,"
which was at that moment being edited by Ms. Zambello.</p>
<p>I know it has its place in the dissemination of culture,
but I usually work hard to avoid seeing opera on television,
with its inevitable scenes of heaving sweat-heaps exposing
pinkish gums in some of the most frightening closeups seen on
television outside of National Geographic specials on the
feeding habits of the warrior ant.</p>
<p>Just exactly what HDTV is, the high-risk pregnancy doctor,
Robin J. Willcourt, was only too happy to explain as he
removed his improvised headband, a piece of thin metal tape.</p>
<p>If he wore an entire 63-minute tape, I would be looking at
$1,500, he explained. That's about seven times the cost of
regular videotape, but compared with conventional television,
HDTV offers more than twice the number of vertical lines per
frame, he went on. HD means crisp, dimensional pictures with
the color resolution of 35-mm film.</p>
<p>Even the one-eyed Marshal Kutuzov would have sung the
praises of the sumptuous images of St. Petersburg society
just then filling the monitor. In a white 18th-century
mansion illuminated by yellow flickering candlelight, Prince
Andrei and Natasha Rostova slowly began to waltz on a
glistening green marble floor. Swirling couples passed them
by, their graceful movement captured as if by painter's
brush. Even better, taking advantage of HD's unusually wide
format, Ms. Zambello emphasized the epic aspect of the piece,
keeping close-ups to midriff, and staying out of Natasha's
dentalwork.</p>
<p>It was HD's incredible detail and true-to-life colors that
first intrigued Dr. Willcourt when he was making medical
films for teaching purposes and found conventional TV
disappointing for the display of body parts. During the
editing, Dr. Willcourt briefly disappeared to deliver preterm
triplets at his hospital in Seattle. But this is a line of
work he is now abandoning, having emerged from his
self-described midlife crisis as the president of the
software company HD Pacific.</p>
<p>A young man in shorts came into the editing room with
sushi dinner and began making phone calls to Atlanta. Douglas
S. Cerrone, co-founder and vice-president of HD Pacific, used
to do marketing and promotion for MCA Records, and consulting
for Motown Records, the outfit responsible for keeping Renata
Tebaldi out of Tower Records's front bins and the Supremes
in. Similarily, Mr. Cerrone evaded opera his whole life
because he was bothered by the singing. Now he is a changed
man, having entered the arcane old world of opera through the
new medium of HD.</p>
<p>In Atlanta, Mr. Cerrone found just what he needed: a reel
of HD tape left over from the Hospital Satellite Network's
breast-surgery program. It will be flown up to Newark by
morning for use in "War and Peace." In the making of
Prokofiev's near-four-hour epic featuring a cast of 250, HD
Pacific pretty much depleted tape stock in America.</p>
<p>Equipment remains expensive ($200,000 for a lens; $500,000
for a videotape recorder) and hard to come by. The pieces are
essentially hand made in Japan, and Rebo is one of the very
few production studios in the U.S. that has supplemented
conventional TV equipment with HD technology. But in Europe
and especially Japan, the consumer electronics industry is
betting on HD as the medium of the '90s -- and another
technological weapon with which to beat up on the slow-mo
U.S.A. We are, of course, lagging way behind in development
and application.</p>
<p>It seems that many years will pass before home TVs will
come down to, say, $1,500. And when the U.S. finally gets
around to adopting a transmission standard it likely will be
lower than Japan's or Europe's. Barry Rebo, who heads up Rebo
Studio, tells me that the dream of a universal standard has
already been lost. At the same time, shooting in HD is
steadily increasing, particularly in the realm of
commercials. At Rebo I saw some pretty dazzling special
effects and montages that would cost more and take weeks of
studio manipulation if done with film or video.</p>
<p>The interesting thing is that all HD programming,
including "War and Peace," can be "downconverted" for showing
on regular TV sets. Similarly, 35-mm movies can be
transferred to HD -- though in that transfer, Dr. Willcourt
says, there is no loss in quality.</p>
<p>In fact, he first met Mr. Cerrone standing in front of a
huge screen that was playing an HD transfer of the Michael J.
Fox movie "Back to the Future" at a Las Vegas HD exposition.
Isn't that an incredible picture, one man gasped to the
other, and last February they formed HD Pacific to make some
of their own.</p>
<p>"War and Peace" is their first venture. Dr. Willcourt, who
unlike his sidekick sometimes hums the beginnings of arias,
had hoped to tape Seattle's visually stunning "Ring" cycle,
but when the company's plans changed, he was even more taken
by the prospect of doing an opera about the triumph over
oppression featuring Russians who could sing from experience.
And unlike the "Ring," which is tricky to hum, "War and
Peace" has some catchy stuff, including a booming tune for
Marshal Kutuzov and some rousing choruses. Had Prokofiev, who
spent his final years toiling on his opera, just rewritten it
a couple more times he might have come up with "Les
Miserables" and really made HD Pacific a bundle of money.</p>
<p>Even so, "War and Peace" is pretty accessible, though a
sad Mr. Cerrone has not been able to talk music-video shows
into playing Natasha's Song between La Toya Jackson and the
Mass Murderers. No weird classical stuff] he keeps hearing
from his former colleagues. More promising is the prospect of
a deal with a recording company for cassettes, compact and
laser discs. HD Pacific is hoping "War and Peace" eventually
will recoup its investment, partly by vividly displaying HD's
possibilities to future software clients outside the opera
world.</p>
<p>Mr. Jenkins, up to his ears in bills after the New York
City Opera dropped out as co-producer, could offer no
financial support. After Dr. Willcourt failed to extract a
few of our tax dollars from PBS, he dug into his own savings
for half the $750,000 budget. The rest came in donated
equipment and services, from companies such as Toshiba and
Ikegami; Northwest Mobile Television furloughed an
enthusiastic crew from the Goodwill Games. Ms. Zambello was
just then fixing a peculiarly angled shot of Napoleon on the
master tape.</p>
<p>In the next few weeks, Dr. Willcourt and Mr. Cerrone are
trundling globally, booking "War and Peace" into movie
theaters. Maybe even in Moscow and Leningrad -- which
probably will be called St. Petersburg before the U.S. fully
awakens to the siren song of HDTV.</p>
