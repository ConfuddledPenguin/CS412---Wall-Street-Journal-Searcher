	<p class="article-leader">Dear President Bush:
   I am a 26 year old Army Reservist and I am ready, if
called, to serve in the Persian Gulf. I can only speak for
myself, but I believe that many other Reservists, and indeed
members of my generation, share my commitment.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>I volunteered to join the Army and eventually the Reserve
not for tuition money and benefits, but so that I would be
ready to help our country in just this kind of crisis. Make
no mistake, I fear war and I fear death. I am married and I
have a lot to lose. But I am willing to endure hardship and
risk my life to help our country defeat an aggressive leader
who could kill millions in the future if left unchecked. We
need only to remember Saddam Hussein's threat "to scorch half
of Israel" with chemical weapons to understand the danger.</p>
<p>I am not poor. I am not underprivileged. I earned my
undergraduate degree at Harvard, and am about to start my
second year at Harvard Business School. However, I am willing
to leave my wife and delay both my education and career to
serve our country in this crisis -- even if that means going
to war.</p>
<p>Mr. President, I know that many Americans, especially
members of the generation now in its 30s and 40s, can think
of nothing but the tragedy of Vietnam when they see military
uniforms or hear talk of war. But I have studied the history
of other wars. As a result, I do not forget the 6 million
Jews who were murdered in the Holocaust or the 250,000
American soldiers and sailors (young men like myself) who
died fighting the dictatorial perpetrators of these and other
crimes during World War II. There is no doubt that there are
times when fighting a war is unnecessary -- even immoral.
Perhaps Vietnam was one of those occasions. Perhaps not. But
it is equally true that there are times when a democratic
people must go to war to halt aggression and atrocity.</p>
<p>Of course it would be best if you and other world leaders
could peacefully maneuver Saddam Hussein out of Kuwait and
out of power. However, if you fail, please have confidence
that I am prepared, as many others in my generation are, to
make whatever sacrifice is necessary to do the job by force
of arms.</p>
<p>Mr. President, 50 years ago you faced combat for your
country in a just and necessary war. If you need me now, I
will too.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>Mr. Meakem is a first lieutenant in the U.S. Army Reserve.</p>
