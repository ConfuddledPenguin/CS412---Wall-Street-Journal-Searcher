	<p class="article-leader">An estimated three million middle managers lost their jobs
in the 1980s, casualties of corporate America's thinning-down
regimen. Their experiences provide fresh ranks of displaced
managers with some clue of what awaits them.
   After some trying times, the pink-slippers of the '80s
generally have reconciled themselves to their dismissals and
emerged happier, if worse off financially. Many landed jobs,
often at smaller employers. Some became business owners
themselves. Others are semi-retired, pursuing hobbies or
sideline businesses.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>That, at least, is what is discerned by revisiting
corporate managers who lost their jobs in the past eight
years and some of whom talked earlier with this newspaper.
Since their corporate dismissals, one left the Connecticut
home he loved for a job in the Midwest. Another, laid off
from a chemical company in 1982, recalls "reeling like a
punch-drunk fighter" from the pressures of rejection,
mounting bills and the absence of corporate health insurance
to help care for severely ill family members.</p>
<p>Here are the stories of five of the managers. Most
striking is that all of them express a common sentiment: If
offered their old jobs back, they would turn them down.
Adversity has changed these people, they say, mainly by
making them more independent. Many place increased value on
family, friends and free time. And those on their own cite a
pride in personal accomplishment that corporate life didn't
give them.</p>
<p>THE DARKNESS LIFTED</p>
<p>Joseph Taylor considers the past three years "a complete
burnout -- like coming down the hill on the seat of my pants.
There was nothing between me and the ground."</p>
<p>In 1987, he lost his managerial job with a Shell Oil Co.
unit in New York when that company moved to Texas. He
expected to get a new position quickly, and at a higher
annual salary than the $43,000 he had been earning. It didn't
happen. This newspaper chronicled his first year out of work,
including 2,500 phone calls to land a new job and stints at
selling cars and insurance. "A long, dark, road," he called
it then.</p>
<p>Things got even darker. His next job, selling computers in
a mall, turned sour. "At one point I woke up and said, `This
is all bull. I might as well be selling ladies' underwear.'
It didn't matter how much I knew about computers." Mr.
Taylor, who lives in Howell, N.J., began consulting part time
and sending out more resumes. He mailed 1,000 last year; his
file of rejection letters is two inches thick. Though his
wife returned to work and he dipped into his son's college
fund, unpaid bills piled up. Bankruptcy loomed.</p>
<p>But last year, Mr. Taylor's part-time consulting work
turned a corner. His reputation spread, and small businesses
sought his services setting up personal-computer systems. Two
months ago, one client, a small brokerage house, hired him
full time. "It's a very small company, but I'm doing
something I really enjoy," he says. Financially, the
49-year-old Mr. Taylor says, "I'm worse off than I was" at
Shell. But he believes he has come out ahead personally.
"There's been a change in my sense of values," he says.
"Being with my family and enjoying myself is more important
than ever. Having all this time on my hands, I found the time
for them."</p>
<p>`LIVING WITH LESS FEAR'</p>
<p>Rock music blares from a packing room in a pink brick
warehouse in Mount Vernon, N.Y., as a half-dozen young men
slide cartons into storage bins. A tangle of computer
equipment spits out orders, while workers paste mailing
labels on fliers.</p>
<p>For Peter Greenhill, this is a long way from Rogers &
Cowan, the New York public-relations agency that dumped him
in a reorganization six years ago. His new business is
baseball cards; the company for which he works, New York Card
Co., expects $7 million in sales this year.</p>
<p>His new boss -- in a way -- is his 18-year-old son, David.
Mr. Greenhill, 52, handles finances, advertising and
administration. His wife, a teacher, works the computers
after school. But it's David, who started the business when
he was 13 to help the family through hard times, who decides
what cards to buy and sell. "He's got the knack," says his
father.</p>
<p>No one thought it would turn out this way. But Mr.
Greenhill's $75,000-a-year job proved impossible to replace.
Contacts evaporated; resumes he sent out went unanswered.
After four years without full-time work, he even applied for
$25,000-a-year positions, but to no avail. By 1988, with
"absolutely no offers whatsoever" on the horizon, Mr.
Greenhill and his family faced the prospect of selling their
condominium and moving.</p>
<p>But David, meanwhile, had been using his paper route money
to buy and sell baseball cards. His hobby grew. The family
took phone orders at home and packed orders on the kitchen
floor.</p>
<p>Today, the business has a 3,000-square-foot warehouse,
seven full-time employees and plans to double its floor space
and staff by year end. The Greenhills are reinvesting their
money in the business, so the family still isn't financially
secure. But, Mr. Greenhill says, "we are living with less
fear."</p>
<p>Would he return to his old profession? "No way," he says.
He expresses bitterness about his experiences while jobless.
"Friends turned out to be acquaintances," he says. "I'm
disappointed in the industry."</p>
<p>FINDING A FOCUS</p>
<p>Barbara Evans, a public affairs manager for American
Telephone & Telegraph Co., lived with corporate cutbacks for
many years, helping notify colleagues that their jobs were
being eliminated, before her own job was eliminated a year
ago. She fantasized about becoming an entrepreneur -- perhaps
running a wine and cheese shop.</p>
<p>But when she left AT&T, she didn't turn shopkeeper.
Instead, Ms. Evans, 55 and long divorced, operates a
corporate communications and market research company,
marketing the skills she acquired in a 31-year career there
and at the Bell companies. She invested about $25,000 in the
business and expects it to subsidize her life style. With her
pension, she says, "I could live, but I wouldn't be enjoying
all the super things {New York} provides," such as the
theater and ballet.</p>
<p>The hardest task has been finding a focus for her
business. "Within the Bell system, the emphasis was always on
getting an experience in a lot of different chairs so you
could get promoted to supervise those chairs." Today, she
says, "when someone asks you what you do, it's tough to say."</p>
<p>Selling, too, has been difficult. "I've always been on the
other side of the desk, and I was uncomfortable with the
calling and proposing." There's a "little bit of stage
fright," she says.</p>
<p>But her corporate past has advantages. One of the biggest
is a huge network of friends and contacts she can tap to find
artists, film makers, focus-group leaders and researchers to
help complete her projects.</p>
<p>"I'm pleased that what I am selling is me and my
experience and my brains," Ms. Evans says, adding that she
prefers being on her own.</p>
<p>FROM PERSONNEL TO PERFORMING</p>
<p>For Thomas McLaughlin, losing his job meant finding
himself. After a long career as a human-resources
administrator at Bethlehem Steel Corp., he is now a
performer, doing television commercials, voice-overs for
radio commercials and narrations.</p>
<p>Mr. McLaughlin, 48, doesn't make much money, but says that
doesn't matter. "I'm delighted with the direction I took," he
says. "I thoroughly enjoy what I am doing."</p>
<p>It all began with the steel-industry crisis nearly a
decade ago. For four years, Mr. McLaughlin helped Bethlehem
Steel Corp. shed jobs to cut costs. Then in 1985, he found an
additional saving: his own job, which staff cutbacks around
him had rendered unnecessary. He looked for a human-resources
position elsewhere, but a job counselor, noting his basso
profundo, suggested performing.</p>
<p>Today, he lives in Hellertown, Pa., on "less than half" of
his $50,000-plus Bethlehem salary, mostly from his pension.
After five years, his performance business is barely
profitable, but in years ahead he expects it to pay for
"goodies." Divorced and with a grown child, he had lived
frugally for years. One sacrifice, though, was his
country-club membership.</p>
<p>Bethlehem Steel's outlook has improved since he left. But
he has no desire to return. "To know you have done something
in a professional manner -- that's the kind of thing that now
defines success for me," he says. When a client calls back
with more work, "it's an ego trip." In a corporate job, "what
you do is what people expect you to do," he says.</p>
<p>What's more, working just three days a week, he revels in
his free time. "I have a thousand hobbies, a country house
that requires a great deal of maintenance. I have time to
pick berries and make wine. I play tennis two or three times
a week, and I have time to spend two or three hours cooking."</p>
<p>`LEAVE THE DOORS OPEN'</p>
<p>Stanley Collins was the quintessential company man. "I
grew up with big companies," he says. "I liked the companies
I worked for. I liked doing what I was doing." Indeed, he
might still be a manager at Owens-Corning Fiberglas Corp. if
a 1987 takeover attempt by Wickes Cos. hadn't pushed
Owens-Corning to pare nearly half its employees.</p>
<p>Today, he's the quintessential entrepreneur. A public
relations and video production business that he started with
a partner three years ago in Toledo, Ohio, now has eight
employees. It has branched out far beyond its original
client, Owens-Corning, which now represents just 10% to 15%
of its business.</p>
<p>At Owens-Corning, he worked 40 hours a week; at his own
business, it's a 60-hour week. "It's a lot of work, but it's
fun." The company will bill about $500,000 this year. Mr.
Collins, 57, says he's financially better off than he would
have been at Owens-Corning: "Unless they {had} made me
president."</p>
<p>And he doesn't think his former corporate colleagues are
as happy as he is. "Part of the problem for people who remain
is that it's a different business than the one they grew up
with. Their jobs are different, and they're doing a lot more
work."</p>
<p>His advice for other middle managers facing the loss of
their jobs: "You have to leave all the doors open. Don't be
afraid to open a new door. You'd be really surprised at where
it takes you."</p>
