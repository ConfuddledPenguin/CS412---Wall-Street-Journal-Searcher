	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- The Securities and Exchange Commission said
it has stepped up enforcement efforts against financial
companies, stemming from reviews of their public documents in
the wake of Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.'s collapse.
   The efforts, which touch nearly every division at the SEC,
is further fallout from the Drexel Chapter 11 filing and
indicates areas where the SEC wants to fine-tune its
supervision. The agency already has proposed a rule to limit
movements of capital by brokerage houses. "We tried to take a
very careful post mortem at anything we could do" to deal
with similar situations, SEC Chairman Richard Breeden said in
an interview. "We tried to learn from it. We would be
derelict if we didn't."</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>In response to written questions relating to the Drexel
bankruptcy and the junk-bond market, Mr. Breeden said the SEC
is focusing its review process on insurance companies,
publicly held brokerage houses and companies with large
brokerage subsidiaries.</p>
<p>He said the agency's accounting task force also is
reviewing public filings of "those banking and thrift holding
companies considered to involve the highest degree of risk."
Typically, the agency doesn't disclose what company filings
it reviews. These investigations concentrate largely on how
companies value their junk-bond holdings.</p>
<p>Mr. Breeden told senators in separate testimony that he
expects the commission to bring charges arising from
investigations by the SEC's savings-and-loan task force.
"There are a fair number of cases the unit is working on,"
Mr. Breeden said at a Senate Banking Committee hearing. "I
think there will be a number of cases where we'll find
certain practices that would not comply with the law." He
wasn't specific about the timing of the cases.</p>
<p>SEC Enforcement Director William McLucas said the agency
has "quite a number of investigations in our inventory." None
of the cases has been brought yet, he said, but the SEC has
15 professionals plus several accountants "occupied
full-time." But he added that the cases could take a while to
bring because "they are document-intensive."</p>
<p>The SEC's corporation-finance division also has asked
several financial companies to amend filings to better
reflect "the risks and effects of participating in the
highyield market" and has made "a number of referrals" to the
agency's enforcement division, Mr. Breeden said. Moreover,
the agency has notified junk-bond mutual funds of their
"disclosure obligations" and is monitoring those disclosures,
he added.</p>
<p>The discussion of stepped-up reviews and enforcement
appears to be a significant step in the post-Drexel era at
the SEC. The once-powerful brokerage house filed for
bankruptcy in February following a steep drop in the
junk-bond market that led to capital problems. The collapse
rippled through the junk-bond market, highlighting additional
risks and pointing up how much information about the market
was controlled by Drexel.</p>
<p>The agency already has offered for public comment a
proposed rule that would force brokerage firms to notify the
SEC before they shift large amounts of capital. In the Drexel
case, the brokerage house was shipping large amounts of
capital to its parent company to help fend off a liquidity
crunch. When an additional capital shift was denied by the
New York Stock Exchange and the SEC, Drexel's parent was
forced to file for Chapter 11 protection from its creditors.</p>
<p>Mr. Breeden also said the agency was continuing to look at
investment partnerships that were set up by Drexel and put
money from Drexel employees, among others, into deals
generated by the firm. Those partnerships, which were
lucrative for several Drexel staffers, also are under
investigation by a House subcommittee.</p>
<p>The SEC chairman also singled out several questionable
trades by Drexel's commodity-trading subsidiary. The unit
made unsecured loans to the parent company by generating
funds through the sale of borrowed commodity positions. For
example, the unit would borrow gold from third parties and
deliver that gold to parties to whom it had previously sold
gold short. Drexel's unit would hedge the short position by
buying futures contracts.</p>
<p>"The net effect of these transactions was to provide
another source of unsecured financing for the parent
company," Mr. Breeden said, "in a manner that was not typical
of major firms and did involve unusual risk for creditors of
Drexel Trading."</p>
<p>Looking back at the Drexel collapse, Mr. Breeden said he
wouldn't have engineered any kind of bailout, arguing that
there is no "too big to fail" doctrine for brokerage firms.
But he said the SEC and Big Board might have "suggested" that
Drexel secure back-up credit lines or increase its capital
immediately. Moreover, the agency might have asked Drexel not
to transfer funds to its parent, Mr. Breeden said. Finally,
the agency might have "insisted that Drexel management cancel
the large bonus-payment program when it was announced at
year-end 1989," he said.</p>
<p>Mr. Breeden is likely to get his chance to do that type of
oversight because Congress is nearing passage of legislation
giving the SEC a better look into the finances of brokerage
firms' parent companies.</p>
