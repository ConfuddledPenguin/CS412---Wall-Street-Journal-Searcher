	<p class="article-leader">John Morrell & Co., a unit of Chiquita Brands
International Inc., said the federal appeals court in
Minneapolis, Minn., upheld two verdicts in the company's
favor, including a damage award now valued at about $27
million.
   The court cases stem from a United Food and Commercial
Workers Union strike in 1987 at Morrell's Sioux Falls, S.D.,
plant. Morrell sells processed and fresh meats.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>In 1988, a federal jury in Rapid City, S.D., determined
that the strike was illegal, and awarded Morrell damages of
$24.6 million. With accrued interest, this award against the
union now has a value of about $27 million, the company said.</p>
<p>The court also upheld a related case that involved
Morrell's refusing to give back pay to the strikers.</p>
<p>James Lyons, president of local 304A of the United Food
and Commerical Workers in Sioux Falls, said lawyers at the
international union are considering appealing the decision,
but haven't yet made a decision. Mr. Lyons said the union
already had raised the cash, in the form of treasury bonds,
for the payment.</p>
<p>Officials at the international union couldn't be reached
for comment.</p>
<p>Chiquita, based in Cincinnati, is a fruit and vegetable
distributor. More than 80% of Chiquita's common stock is
