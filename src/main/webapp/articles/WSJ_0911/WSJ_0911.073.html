	<p class="article-leader">CHICAGO -- The Chicago Board Options Exchange said that
next month it will begin trading long-term options on
individual equities, which the exchange said is an industry
first.
   The so-called Long-Term Equity Anticipation Securities, or
LEAPS, are designed to appeal to retail investors "with a
longer time horizon who do not currently use options," the
exchange said.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The long-term put and call options for selected individual
stocks will differ from existing stock options by providing
investors with the ability to hedge against market swings for
as long as two years. In comparison, the options for the 14
companies -- including International Business Machines Corp.;
Sears, Roebuck & Co. and General Electric Co. -- on whose
common shares LEAPS will initially be offered, currently
extend a maximum of eight months.</p>
<p>The CBOE already offers long-term hedging on overall
market swings, through its S&P 500 Long-Term Index Option.</p>
