	<p class="article-leader">The U.S. formally asked its European allies to commit some
ground-based troops to the Persian Gulf and to provide cargo
ships and planes to move more Arab troops and weapons to the
area.
   The two requests, and several others, were presented by
Secretary of State James Baker at a meeting of the North
Atlantic Treaty Organization in Brussels. They came as Iraq
moved to shore up its standing in the international community
by agreeing to restore full diplomatic relations with Iran
and offering to give away oil to Third World countries if
those countries can arrange to pick it up.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>At the Brussels meeting, several NATO allies immediately
agreed to lend some ships and airplanes to carry fresh
Egyptian troops to Saudi Arabia, to join the huge military
buildup there aimed at reversing Iraq's occupation of Kuwait
and deterring a move into Saudi Arabia.</p>
<p>The allies also agreed to consider the secretary of
state's call to send some of their own ground-based troops to
Saudi Arabia. Washington seeks mainly small, symbolic
deployments of such troops to add to the U.S.-led force
confronting Iraq.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Mr. Baker disclosed that he will fly Thursday
to Syria -- a bitter foe of Iraq -- to try to cement the
U.S.-Arab coalition against Baghdad. He is making the trip
even though Damascus has provided sanctuary for terrorists
who have killed hundreds of Americans in recent years.</p>
<p>No high-ranking U.S. official has called on Syrian
President Hafez Assad since before the December 1988 bombing
of Pan American Flight 103 over Lockerbie, Scotland, that
killed 281 people. The U.S. believes the bombing was carried
out on behalf of Iran by Palestinian terrorists whom Mr.
Assad's regime sponsors.</p>
<p>Syria has sent troops to Saudi Arabia and has supported
the U.S. presence there.</p>
<p>In a news conference after his meeting with the European
allies, Mr. Baker also made a major disclosure on a separate
issue -- conventional arms control. He said the U.S. has
agreed with the Soviet Union to limit U.S. forces in Europe,
under a pending conventional-arms pact, to a figure lower
than the 195,000 agreed to by the superpowers in Ottawa last
winter. He didn't specify the new figure.</p>
<p>With the Soviets pledged to remove all their troops from
Germany under a German-Soviet pact signed in July, Mr. Baker
said, the Ottawa accord has been "overtaken by events" and
the U.S. troop level is "up in the air." He is expected to
discuss the issue with Soviet officials this week in Moscow,
where he flew after his news conference in the Belgian
capital.</p>
<p>The U.S. proposals to the NATO allies, if acted upon,
would help to increase Iraq's international isolation, draw
Western Europe deeper into the military aspect of the
anti-Iraq effort and begin to respond to criticism within the
U.S. that major allies aren't exposing their troops to the
risk of ground fighting in the Middle East being faced by
U.S. forces.</p>
<p>Mr. Baker hopes his trip to Damascus will be a powerful
sign to Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein that his enemies are
willing to patch up their differences to take him on. To try
to fuel such fears in Baghdad, Mr. Baker publicly praised
Iran's professed willingness to abide by sanctions against
Iraq.</p>
<p>The secretary also appeared to add to the publicly stated
goals of the anti-Iraq effort by calling for "intrusive"
international controls "to diminish the threat of Iraqi
weapons of mass destruction." And he said "other measures"
will be needed if "an outlaw like Saddam Hussein can be only
years away from having a nuclear capability." He refused to
define the "other measures" and appeared to be leaving the
impression that the U.S. might consider destroying Iraq's
nuclear and chemical weapons plants, as some members of
Congress have urged.</p>
<p>Mr. Baker said Iraq's Persian Gulf neighbors have agreed
to contribute $12 billion to the anti-Baghdad effort through
the end of 1990. Half of that sum, he said, would go to cover
the U.S.'s added military costs stemming from the Gulf
crisis. The rest would be used to help countries such as
Egypt and Turkey, which have been hurt by the world-wide
trade embargo against Iraq.</p>
<p>Mr. Baker raised the funds on a Persian Gulf swing last
weekend but didn't disclose the total amount until yesterday.</p>
<p>Iraq's agreement with Iran to reopen embassies in each
other's country came as Iraqi Foreign Minister Tariq Aziz was
in Tehran to nail down details of a peace agreement formally
ending the 1980-88 Iran-Iraq war. But the decision may have
little more than symbolic importance. Iran and Iraq never
formally broke diplomatic ties during their war and even
maintained embassies in each other's capitals from the time
the war broke out until 1986.</p>
<p>At the same time that Iran was agreeing to reopen
diplomatic ties yesterday, it was reaffirming its opposition
to Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion and seizure of Kuwait. Iraq clearly
hopes that Iran now will help circumvent the trade embargo
against it, but there's no sign yet that Iran will do so.</p>
<p>Iraq's offer to give away oil to Third World countries, in
a statement by Saddam Hussein read on Iraqi television, was
aimed at driving a wedge between poor nations and rich ones
supporting the campaign against Iraq. The message said Iraq
and Third World countries are "brothers" because of the
poorer nations' "evenhanded" policies on Arab issues.</p>
<p>But Iraq said Third World countries would have to figure
out for themselves how to pick up any oil, as the
international trade embargo and a U.S.-led blockade have
stopped Iraqi tankers from carrying oil out.</p>
<p>White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater dismissed both
Iraq's move toward Iran and its offer to give away oil. "The
desperation attempts, reaching out to Iran and this free oil
for the Third World, indicate that the pressure is pinching
them someplace," Mr. Fitzwater said. He said that even
picking up oil at no charge would violate the embargo.</p>
<p>Mr. Baker, in addition to requesting troops and cargo
craft from the NATO allies, said he asked the Europeans to
activate an emergency alliance planning committee to
coordinate allied aid in the Gulf crisis, move naval vessels
to the eastern Mediterranean, deploy radar control planes in
southern Europe, aid Turkey and Eastern Europe, and airlift
refugees from Jordan.</p>
<p>He said Greece and Denmark had agreed to provide cargo
ships, West Germany would provide unspecified sea and air
transport, the Netherlands would supply more gear to defend
against chemical weapons, and Belgium would send aircraft to
Egypt for evacuating refugees.</p>
<p>Some of the latest U.S. steps could prompt domestic
political criticism. For one thing, Mr. Baker said he would
be satisfied with "symbolic" small troop deployments by the
allies and that the forces they contribute needn't be army
combat units.</p>
<p>He referred to them as "ground-based" rather than "ground"
forces, and he implied that other allies might imitate
Britain, whose troops on the ground in the Gulf are pilots
and maintenance crews who operate a squadron of fighter jets,
plus troops to defend them. That wouldn't satisfy
congressional and other critics who are demanding large
allied participation on the ground.</p>
<p>In addition, the Baker visit to Syria is sure to spur
criticism. At his news conference, Mr. Baker testily denied
the trip would undermine U.S. anti-terrorism policy.</p>
<p>"We still have difficulties with Syria," he said, and he
insisted that "we will use the occasion of this visit to
discuss those difficulties with them as well." He said
improved U.S.-Syrian relations would depend on changes in
Syrian behavior and that strains between the two countries
wouldn't be "cured overnight" by their mutual stand against
Iraq.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the State Department said 161 Americans who
were stranded in Iraqi-occupied Kuwait for more than a month
arrived yesterday afternoon in Baltimore. The passengers left
Baghdad Sunday on an Iraqi charter jet and spent the night in
London, where three other Americans left the flight to join
family or friends in the British capital.</p>
