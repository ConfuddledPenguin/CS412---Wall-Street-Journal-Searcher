	<p class="article-leader">Increased parental control of British schools, as
discussed by David Brooks (editorial page, July 26), is
anything but the unalloyed good news it seems to be.
   The crucial factor in education is curriculum. In the name
of efficiency, a standardized curriculum is reportedly being
promoted in British schools. The state, not parents, will
decide this "standard" curriculum.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>In the U.S., as in England, the "choice" of school
buildings now being offered only disarms parents and makes
them foolishly think they are in charge of their children's
education. Instead of parents choosing their children's
curriculum, America's future curriculum will be shaped by
nongovernmental agencies and foundations. They will
underwrite national "achievement" tests, most probably in
concert with government-related agencies such as the National
Assessment of Educational Progress. These tests will define
and drive future curriculum in American schools.</p>
<p>If parents in American and British schools promoting
"choice" demanded that laws be passed to confirm their right
to choose all textbooks and all tests in such "choice"
schools, they would be surprised at how quickly the illusion
of "choice" would fade like fog before the sun.</p>
