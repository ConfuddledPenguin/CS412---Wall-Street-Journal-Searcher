	<p class="article-leader">DETROIT -- With four days to go until a strike deadline,
bargainers for General Motors Corp. and the United Auto
Workers union are still far apart on the top issue in the
talks -- job security for union members.
   But both sides say they're optimistic they can reach an
agreement by the Friday night deadline, despite the
differences over job guarantees.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>UAW officials want GM to promise that the company's
310,000 UAW workers will be employed for all but a specific
number of weeks per year. The requirement, which would allow
the company to close plants temporarily based on market
demand, would discourage the auto maker from moving
production work outside the country or to non-union plants.
The requirement is similar to the agreement that the UAW
reached with Tenneco Inc.'s J.I. Case division, a Wisconsin
farm-equipment maker.</p>
<p>GM officials, however, say they can't match the terms at
J.I. Case because the auto maker needs to reduce its North
American work force to cut costs. J.I. Case agreed to its job
security provisions when its work force was at a historic
low, GM officials say.</p>
<p>GM bargainers have indicated they might offer greater job
security to the 280,000 UAW members currently working for the
company. But that doesn't include some 30,000 now laid off
indefinitely. Instead, GM has indicated it might be willing
to boost compensation for those now laid off, some of whom
receive payments from GM in addition to regular government
unemployment benefits.</p>
<p>A key element in the discussions will be the current
requirement that GM replace one of every two workers who
retire or quit. The UAW wants to keep this provision in the
contract. GM wants it eliminated to speed downsizing efforts.
The company also is offering to sweeten pensions to encourage
older workers to retire.</p>
<p>Officials on both sides say the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait
has cast a shadow over the talks. The situation has
intensified concerns about a broad economic downturn, and a
worsening of the Big Three auto makers sales slump. "It's had
a very sobering effect on negotiations," said a GM official
close to the talks.</p>
<p>Still, UAW and GM officials agree the talks until now have
gone better than expected. The two sides quickly agreed to
language regarding basic health and safety issues. Bargainers
aren't expecting much trouble over basic wage and benefit
issues, either.</p>
<p>However, these matters remain secondary to job security
and pensions. Said one GM official: "If we have a strike,
everyone will know what it's about."</p>
