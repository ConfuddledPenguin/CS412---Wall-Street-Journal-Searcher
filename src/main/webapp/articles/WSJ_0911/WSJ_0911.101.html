	<p class="article-leader">Hees International Bancorp Inc., a merchant banking
concern controlled by Toronto's Bronfman family, said it will
proceed with its offer to purchase up to 40 million common
shares of Canadian Express Ltd. for up to 26 million Canadian
dollars (U.S.$22.3 million).
   The offer of 65 Canadian cents (56 U.S. cents) a share was
deferred in April after the Ontario Securities Commission
withdrew an exemption from a valuation requirement it had
granted to the offer.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Hees said discussions with the commission and the Toronto
Stock Exchange have resulted in the original offer's being
reinstituted. The bid, to be made through the Toronto Stock
Exchange, is intended to take place by the end of this month.</p>
<p>The bid would raise Hees's voting stake in the
Toronto-based merchant banking company to about 56% from 40%.</p>
<p>On the Toronto Stock Exchange yesterday, Canadian Express
gained 8 Canadian cents, to close at 41 cents.</p>
