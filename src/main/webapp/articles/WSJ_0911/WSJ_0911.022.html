	<p class="article-leader">How safe is my job?
   For many people, that's the issue of the 1990s. It's
becoming clear that corporate cutbacks weren't an '80s
oddity, but rather are likely to persist through the new
decade. So far this year, by one estimate, U.S. employers
have been trimming 30,000 people from their payrolls -- a
month.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Today's edgy employees can get some clue about how secure
their jobs are by taking the quiz offered here. It was
developed by exploring both those factors that have
determined just who has been laid off in the past and the
outlook for specific jobs, career paths and industries with a
number of academics, consultants and corporate executives.</p>
<p>A high tally on this unscientific quiz (on which possible
scores range from 24 to zero) shouldn't prompt people to
start clearing out their desks. Paul Hirsch, a professor at
Northwestern University's Kellogg School of Management, notes
that in any cutback, "more people are scared than wind up
getting hurt. Whenever 10% get cut, 90% worry that it will
happen to them."</p>
<p>Further, a company's particular style of treating
employees -- whether paternalistic, cold-blooded or in
between -- will be a factor. "You might come up with all the
right answers," says Robert Tomasko, a consultant with Arthur
D. Little Inc. and author of a book on corporate cutbacks.
"But you can't assume your company is acting rationally."</p>
<p>Still, the answers provide clues to help people look at
their jobs the way their bosses do.</p>

<p>SCORING THE RESULTS</p>
<p>1. Industry: Score a point for financial-services
industries such as banking, brokerage and insurance
companies.</p>
<p>These, says Mr. Tomasko of Arthur D. Little, are the
industries most prone to cutbacks in the early 1990s, along
with utilities, local telephone companies, consumer-goods
makers (still takeover candidates), defense contractors (hurt
by spending cutbacks) and retailers. Score a point for all of
these fields.</p>
<p>Give yourself a zero if you are in an industry less likely
to cut back, including heavy manufacturers such as
machine-tool companies, which already cut heavily in the
'80s.</p>
<p>2. Size: Score two points if your employer is a large
company, one if medium-sized and zero if small.</p>
<p>"In general, the bigger the company, the more likely it is
to be cutting," says Dan Lacey of Lacey & Co., consultants.
An American Management Association survey of personnel
managers at more than 1,200 companies confirms the trend:
Nearly one-third of companies with annual sales exceeding
$500 million plan staff cuts; fewer than 10% of companies
with under $10 million in sales reported such plans.</p>
<p>3. Market share: Count three points for a recent big drop
in market share.</p>
<p>"Market share was probably the most prevalent reason" for
staff cuts in the '80s, says Aneil Mishra, a research
associate working on a continuing University of Michigan
study of 30 automotive suppliers. Even within individual
companies, units with poorer market-share performance were
"much more aggressive" in cutting staff, he says.</p>
<p>4. Location: Score two points if your job is in the
Northeast, one for the Midwest and zero for the South or
West.</p>
<p>In the past three years, "the big unemployment increases
have been largely in the Northeast; the big employment
increases have been largely in the West," says Samuel
Ehrenhalt, Northeast regional commissioner for the Bureau of
Labor Statistics. He notes that New York dropped to No. 45
among states in job growth last year from No. 27 in 1987. In
the past three years, the bottom 10 states for job growth
have included New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Massachusetts and
Connecticut. Over the same time, Idaho, Washington, Oregon
and Utah all climbed into the top 10.</p>
<p>5. History: Give yourself two points if your company has
already had early retirement or layoff programs, zero if it
hasn't.</p>
<p>If you think you're safe because your company has made
cuts, think again. The recent American Management Association
study concluded that "the best predictor of future work-force
cuts was past work-force cuts," says Eric Greenberg, editor
of the study. Of companies that had cut staff in the past, he
says, 29% planned to do so again; of companies that had never
cut staff, only 7% planned future cuts.</p>
<p>6. Type of job: Point scores depend on individual factors.</p>
<p>If your company recently has faced, or faces, a leveraged
buy-out or merger, give yourself a point if you're a senior
manager or supervisor. "The highest executives are vulnerable
in a company that is being bought out," says James Buttimer,
director of organizational planning at Arthur D. Little. And,
he advises, don't be reassured by a friendly takeover team:
"Watch what they do, not what they say."</p>
<p>But where staff cuts reflect the need to cut costs, Mr.
Buttimer says, middle managers are more vulnerable. Give
yourself a point there.</p>
<p>In any case, holders of staff jobs should give themselves
two points. When outplacement firm Drake Beam Morin Co.
studied displaced managers over the past three years, they
found that nearly 30% were from general management or
administration; an additional 16% had finance or accounting
backgrounds.</p>
<p>7. Number of subordinates: Tally two points if you have
fewer than three people reporting directly to you; one point
for three to seven subordinates; and zero for more than
eight, because cost-cutting companies try to squeeze more
managing from fewer managers.</p>
<p>Today, an average manager supervises 3.5 workers, down
from about 10 in the '60s, says Jewell Westerman, a vice
president with consultants Temple, Barker & Sloane Inc. But
today, he says, companies are trying to increase that number.
Phillips Petroleum Co., for example, cut its management costs
to 28 cents a payroll dollar from 30 cents by moving to one
manager per 7.3 people from one per 5.8 in 1983, says Jerry
D. Fultz, manager of employee relations.</p>
<p>8. Dispensability: If outside contractors can do your job
better than you, give yourself three points; if not, score a
zero.</p>
<p>Employers are making tough make-or-buy decisions about
nearly everything they do. Mr. Tomasko suggests asking
yourself: "`If they had to go outside and buy what I do,
would they do it -- and would they pay enough for it to cover
my salary?'"</p>
<p>9. Customer contact: Give yourself two points if you never
deal with the outside world, zero if you do.</p>
<p>Many companies, such as International Business Machines
Corp., are shifting their focus from managing to meeting
customers. At American Telephone & Telegraph Co., "the Maalox
moments are if you have little to do with sales or with the
public," says Burke Stinson, a spokesman. AT&T is cutting out
6,000 positions at its long-distance unit. "There's quite
often a battalion of people who . . . do little else than
meet with other in-house people in a series of meetings,
essentially writing memos to themselves," Mr. Stinson says.
"If you are in one of those jobs, you may be able to duck
attention for a while, but you may not be able to do it
forever."</p>
<p>10. Age: Give yourself a point if you're a man over 40 or
a woman over 30; otherwise, score a zero.</p>
<p>The Drake Beam Morin survey found that in the three years
ended June 11, the bulk of men displaced -- 47% -- were 40 to
49 years old. For women, the largest age group -- 44% -- was
30 to 39. Low seniority also mattered: More than 60% had been
with their companies for less than 10 years, three-quarters
for less than 15 years.
</p>
<p>11. Performance reviews: Everyone gets a zero on this one.</p>
<p>"Performance reviews are more irrelevant than relevant,"
says Mr. Tomasko of Arthur D. Little. One reason is their
unreliability. "They are too lenient," says Craig Schneier, a
managing director at consultants Sibson & Co. "Everyone is
rated too high."</p>
<p>Companies in the University of Michigan study found that
as a result, the number of marginal performers identified was
small, while "the sheer numbers of people they needed to get
rid of was so great" says Mr. Mishra. So, they had to abandon
using performance reviews as a criterion.</p>
<p>12. Flexibility: Give yourself a zero if you're confident
of your ability to take new jobs, or willing to move to new
places. Add one point if you can't relocate, two points if
you consider yourself unlikely to be able to change jobs or
four points if your approach to work is inflexible.</p>
<p>"The No. 1 skill in the American economy is the ability to
adapt to change," says Mr. Ehrenhalt of the Bureau of Labor
Statistics.</p>
<p>Companies increasingly cut back in one area while adding
employees in others. Moreover, when working with a leaner
staff, companies are likely to value switchhitters more.
"When you still have 100% of the work, but only 80% of the
workers, you have to appraise who is going to be a helpful
survivor," says Norman Abazoris, a partner with Hewitt
Associates.</p>
