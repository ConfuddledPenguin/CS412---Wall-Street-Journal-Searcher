	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- A federal court upheld the authority of the
Office of Thrift Supervision to impose new capital
requirements on a thrift, in a case that temporarily put the
entire savings-and-loan bailout on hold.
   U.S. District Judge Royce Lamberth dismissed six counts in
the suit filed by Olympic Federal Savings & Loan Association,
Berwyn, Ill., ruling that he has no jurisdiction to prevent
federal regulators from enforcing capital standards
established by the S&L cleanup law.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Earlier this year, the thrift won a ruling that had the
effect of nullifying actions taken by the previous top thrift
regulator, on the grounds that he hadn't been appointed
properly. The ruling was later overturned by an appellate
court, and Olympic pursued its court case on other grounds.</p>
<p>In his decision issued late last week, Judge Lamberth said
he is still considering two other counts, in which Olympic
Federal argued that it didn't receive sufficient notice of
the new capital requirements and that the regulators hadn't
considered its request for federal assistance. Judge Lamberth
earlier denied Olympic Federal's request for a temporary
restraining order on those grounds.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Timothy Ryan, director of the thrift office,
predicted that the agency would be vindicated in its
contentious takeover of Franklin Savings Association, Ottawa,
Kan., with $11 billion in assets. In a complex case revolving
around how federal regulators accounted for Franklin's
losses, a federal court ruled that the government seizure was
improper. The government is appealing the decision.</p>
<p>Mr. Ryan said that he reviewed the thrift office actions,
which were launched prior to his taking his post. "I came to
the very firm conclusion that the institution, Franklin, is
appropriately in the Resolution Trust Corp.," he said. The
RTC acts as the liquidator of government-seized thrifts. He
contended that Franklin's losses presented an "extraordinary
risk" to the deposit insurance fund.</p>
