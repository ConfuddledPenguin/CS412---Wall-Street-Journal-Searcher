	<p class="article-leader">PORTLAND, Maine -- One Bancorp said it will begin today a
tender offer for its $36 million of 7 1/2% convertible
subordinated debentures outstanding due 2001.
   The commercial banking concern is offering $100 in cash
and three shares of a new issue of preferred for each $1,000
face amount of the debentures. Each share of preferred will
have a liquidation value of $10 a share and can be exchanged
for 26.67 One Bancorp common shares at any time. The
preferred will carry a 7% non-cumulative dividend rate, but
the financially troubled company said it doesn't plan to pay
a dividend in the foreseeable future. The tender offer
expires Oct. 10 and is subject to at least 75% of the
debentures being tendered.</p>
