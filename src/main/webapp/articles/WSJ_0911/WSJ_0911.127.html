	<p class="article-leader">Somebody doesn't like Sara Lee.
   Even though the Deerfield, Ill., marketer of food products
and clothing has posted 13 years of record earnings, its
stock has declined 20% this year, closing at 26 3/4 yesterday
in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. In the past two
months, short sellers have been placing big bets that the
stock will continue to decline.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Short sellers borrow stock and immediately sell it, hoping
the price will drop. Eventually they must buy shares to
replace the ones they borrowed. But if the price drops enough
in the meantime, they profit. Short interest -- the number of
shares borrowed and not yet replaced -- in Sara Lee stock
ballooned to 3.9 million shares as of mid-August, the latest
tally available from the New York Stock Exchange.</p>
<p>Sara Lee is hardly the sort of stock short sellers
normally swarm around. Shorts generally look for troubled
companies with painfully heavy debt loads. But Sara Lee has
been consistently profitable, with earnings growing about 14%
a year. Its debt load is higher than some people prefer, with
debt at about 36% of capital, but isn't far out of line with
that of competitors.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, three highly regarded money management firms
-- Steinhardt Partners, Tiger Management, and Soros Fund
Management -- are shorting the stock heavily, according to
some money managers and analysts. The three firms won't
confirm or deny the reports.</p>
<p>Sara Lee's chief financial officer, Michael Murphy, says
he has heard that the short sellers' main concern is Sara
Lee's T-shirt business, part of its Hanes clothing unit.
T-shirt sales are growing, but capacity to produce T-shirts
has grown faster. An inventory glut looms and will take at
least two more quarters to work off, Mr. Murphy says.</p>
<p>But Mr. Murphy says he is "puzzled" by the large-scale
short selling because T-shirts are only a small part of Sara
Lee's sales. How small? One analyst says 2%. Mr. Murphy won't
disclose a figure, but says it's "a little bit more than
that."</p>
<p>People familiar with the shorts' thinking say their
concerns go well beyond T-shirts. Sara Lee "has been one of
the faster growing food companies, but in the past 12 months
it has disappointed, slowed down," says Kurt Feuerman, a
Morgan Stanley analyst. "It's not going to be that easy for
them to ramp up the growth rate again." Mr. Feuerman himself
rates the stock a "hold."</p>
<p>Operating earnings in bakery goods and packaged meats fell
16% in the fiscal year that ended in June. Bakery business
was hurt by the trend to lower-calorie products, which Sara
Lee is belatedly joining. Meats were hurt by rising hog
prices, a factor that has since reversed. The company says
both businesses will do better this year.</p>
<p>Sara Lee's earnings now come mainly from clothing, rather
than food. Wall Street usually values food stocks more
highly, on the theory that food earnings are more dependable.</p>
<p>That's a "gross mistake," claims Sara Lee's chief
executive, John H. Bryan Jr. At a meeting Friday with
analysts and money managers in New York, he said that Sara
Lee's biggest apparel business, hosiery (L'Eggs and Hanes
brands), is steady and has outstanding profit margins, making
it in many ways a better business than food, where
competition is fierce.</p>
<p>Short sellers also point to what they say is a weak
pricing environment for underwear in general, not just
T-shirts. Sara Lee's Mr. Murphy says pricing lately is
"nothing out of the ordinary." He acknowledges that Hanes has
cut underwear prices three times, but says that the most
recent cut was some time ago.</p>
<p>One short seller claims that hosiery shipments lately have
been disappointing. The company, though it readily admits to
problems in T-shirts, won't stand for that kind of talk. Sara
Lee's hosiery business "is wonderful," Mr. Murphy says.</p>
<p>Mr. Bryan concedes that the U.S. hosiery industry "has
been in decline for several years," partly because of a trend
to more casual clothes. But he says Sara Lee can thrive in
the business nevertheless, by continuing to gain market share
(now about 43% in the U.S.). His target: a 60% U.S. share,
and similar dominance in Europe, where the hosiery business
is extremely fragmented.</p>
<p>Finally, some pessimists cite a report by Kellogg
Associates, a Los Angeles research firm, pointing to what
Kellogg sees as classic warning signs in Sara Lee's financial
statements -- a buildup of inventories and accounts
receivable, or money owed to the company. Sara Lee officials
say those figures are explainable by such things as a
changing business mix and the fact that "retailers are in
tough shape."</p>
