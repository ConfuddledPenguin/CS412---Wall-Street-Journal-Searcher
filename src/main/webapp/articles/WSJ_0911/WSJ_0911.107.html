	<p class="article-leader">Baxter International Inc. said it cut its stake in
Genetics Institute Inc. to 3.5% from 7% of the common shares
outstanding.
   In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission,
Baxter said it sold 521,374 shares Friday at $31.25 a share.
As a result, Baxter, a medical products and services concern
based in Deerfield, Ill., now holds 500,000 shares in
Genetics Institute, a pharmaceuticals company in Cambridge,
Mass.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>As previously reported, Baxter has said that it intends to
sell all or part of its investment in Genetics Institute and
that the proceeds from the sale will be used to reduce debt.</p>
<p>In making the announcement last month, Baxter said the
company has an "excellent working relationship" with Genetics
Institute. The two companies are involved in a joint effort
to develop and market a genetically engineered drug on which
Genetics Institute holds a patent. The drug is for
hemophilia, a hereditary condition in which one of the normal
blood-clotting factors is absent.</p>
