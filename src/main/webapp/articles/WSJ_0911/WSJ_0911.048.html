	<p class="article-leader">I am distressed and angered that you chose to begin your
Aug. 28 article "New Breed of Consultant Aims to Boost
Flier's Chances of Surviving a Disaster" with a cheap shot at
polyester. The statement "Polyester can kill" is misleading
and grossly inaccurate.
   Though the article later questions the contention of
consultant Linda Pearson that wearing polyester apparel "can
melt on skin and hamper a prompt escape" during a plane
crash, the damage has already been done -- a proven
misconception has taken on an aura of respectability.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Polyester is inherently flame-resistant. That Ms. Pearson
recommends the wearing of cotton, a fiber that burns rapidly
when ignited, adds insult to injury.</p>
