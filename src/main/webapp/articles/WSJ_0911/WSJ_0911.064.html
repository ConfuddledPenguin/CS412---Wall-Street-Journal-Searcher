	<p class="article-leader">China gave details of its multibillion-dollar program to
revive the economy of Shanghai, apparently hoping to attract
foreign investment for a project to regain for China's
largest city its lost status as one of Asia's most important
manufacturing centers.
   But even Chinese officials, as well as foreign investors,
say the plan to build a giant industrial zone called Pudong,
or East Shanghai, across the Huangpu River from teeming
Shanghai, initially could do more harm than good to
Shanghai's ailing industries.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Still, the opening of Pudong sends an important signal
that China's doors remain open to foreign investors despite
the reassertion of central planning that followed the
pro-democracy movement's suppression last year.</p>
<p>Yesterday, Shanghai officials announced the preferential
investment regulations for foreign and domestic enterprises
in Pudong. Under the Pudong plan, first promulgated in April,
a modern industrial, commercial and financial center is to be
built on a 135-square-mile tract of rural land at the estuary
of the Yangtze River. Chinese planners estimate that
completion of the site's utilities, roads, housing, factories
and other infrastructure will take about 30 years and cost
between $70 billion and $80 billion.</p>
<p>Foreign businessmen have shown little enthusiasm for the
project. Though they concede that the overall plan is sound,
they say the rules announced yesterday appear only slightly
more attractive than those already available elsewhere in
China. They also note that the investments in Pudong for
years will be limited largely to big infrastructural
projects, including power plants, ports and highways.</p>
<p>In addition, Chinese officials say that development of
Pudong could hurt factories in Shanghai proper, which already
accounts for 10% of China's total industrial output. These
factories don't get the preferential taxes and other
incentives that will cover Pudong, so they stand to lose
orders to Pudong, and probably will suffer in competition for
bank loans and funds.</p>
<p>"How do we not hurt Shanghai industry too much while we
develop Pudong? That is going to be very difficult," says a
Chinese adviser to the Pudong plan.</p>
<p>In February, paramount leader Deng Xiaoping visited
Shanghai, giving his blessing to the Pudong plan when the
subject was broached by former Shanghai Mayor Wang Daohan.
Mr. Wang drafted the development plan in 1985.</p>
<p>"Pudong waves the political banner for Beijing leaders,"
says Ming K. Chan, an analyst with the Hoover Institution, a
U.S. think tank. "If Pudong succeeds, it will lend substance
to Deng Xiaoping's claim that China's open-door policy hasn't
changed."</p>
<p>The choice of Pudong also marks a shift in the country's
development strategy. Under former Communist Party
General-Secretary Zhao Ziyang, Guangdong province and other
southern coastal regions were the major beneficiaries of the
central government's preferential investment programs.</p>
<p>Indeed, all of the country's five special economic zones,
the laboratories for experiments in market-style reform, are
in the south. "The current regime wants its own turf, and
Shanghai is its big apple," says Mr. Chan, because it has
faithfully toed the central-government line.</p>
<p>With Pudong, the focus of development is being shifted.
Chinese planners hope that development of Pudong will
invigorate the slumbering industries in Shanghai, as well as
in the vast hinterland of the Yangtze River delta. Shanghai
lost much of its prominence as a manufacturing giant
following the Communist takeover of China in 1949, when many
industrialists fled to the British colony of Hong Kong.</p>
<p>Foreign capital is vital to Pudong. Beijing has pledged
only 6.5 billion yuan, or about $1.38 billion in funds and
concessionary loans for the first 10 years, with an
additional one billion to two billion yuan a year to be
supplied by the Shanghai municipality. But Sha Lin, one of
Pudong's planners, estimates that for the first three years
alone, 26 billion to 30 billion yuan will be needed to build
infrastructural facilities.</p>
<p>So it was to attract the needed foreign capital that
Shanghai yesterday announced the investment regulations and
preferential policies for Pudong. As in other special
economic zones, foreign-invested enterprises will be subject
to a 15% profits tax, considerably lower than outside the
special zones. Enterprises that agree to operate in Pudong
for more than 10 years will get full exemption from profits
tax for the first two profit-making years, and a 50%
reduction in the following three years. Further benefits will
be extended to export-oriented enterprises.</p>
<p>For enterprises that invest in airport, port and other
transport facilities and that agree to operate for more than
15 years, the tax-exemption and tax-reduction period would
each be extended to five years.</p>
<p>Foreign companies will be allowed to set up trading
companies in Waigaoqiao, part of Pudong zoned as a duty-free
bonded area, to handle trade for foreign enterprises in
Waigaoqiao. Imports of goods into the zone would be
tariff-free so long as they are used for production of goods
for export. Bonded warehouses established elsewhere in China
already perform similar functions.</p>
<p>Foreign banks will be allowed to set up branches in Pudong
to engage mainly in lending and trade financing, the first
time such activities have been permitted outside the existing
special economic zones. The banks won't be allowed to handle
local-currency business, though.</p>
<p>Lack of fresh incentives in the rules is a big drawback.
Foreign businessmen had expected the regulations to create a
free-trade zone in Pudong that would allow foreign trading
companies to gain easier access to China's domestic market.
Under current nationwide regulations, all imports and exports
are handled by Chinese trading companies. But Monday's
package disclosed that Pudong will be little more than a
large duty-free bonded area.</p>
<p>The lack of substantial new incentives could put Pudong at
a disadvantage when vying for foreign funds with the special
economic zones in the south. Even so, Pudong will benefit
from the advantages of easy access to Shanghai's developed
supporting industries and abundant supply of skilled labor,
foreign businessmen say.</p>
