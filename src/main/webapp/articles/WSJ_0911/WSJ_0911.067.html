	<p class="article-leader">For some people, the end of summer means more than packing
away swimsuits and surfing gear. It means closing down a
business.
   Next month, for instance, Robert Drake will lock the door
of his clothing store in Highlands, N.C., which he opens
every May. The rest of the year he spends running his store
in Fort Lauderdale, Fla.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Mr. Drake has owned his Fort Lauderdale business, Rob't
Drake Inc., for 35 years. He says he opened the branch in
Highlands partly to follow many of his Fort Lauderdale
customers who regularly head for the summer resort town in
the North Carolina mountains.</p>
<p>Thousands of entrepreneurs such as Mr. Drake move with the
seasons. The way of life is filled with special strains and
problems. But many who follow it say it fulfills a simple
dream that somehow eludes almost everybody: to live in a
pleasant climate all the time.</p>
<p>In summer, Gus Correia runs a leather shop in a museum
village outside the seaside resort of Cape May, N.J. In
winter, he moves among arts and crafts fairs in the Florida
Keys. The leathersmith says his work requires him to "follow
people's wallets around the country." But that suits him just
fine. What he loves is "the freedom of it all," he says. He
just can't see the advantage of living all year in a place
that one hates part of the year.</p>
<p>Each year, thousands feel the lure of Mr. Correia's way of
life. Maureen and Stephen Horn own and manage two restaurants
in Cape May. Now they're looking for a third restaurant -- in
Florida.</p>
<p>The two restaurants in Cape May, Maureen and Es-ta-ti,
open in April and close in October. Mrs. Horn says she wants
to spend the period from Thanksgiving to Easter in Florida.
"We want to take the best months in each location," she says.
"That's our philosophy in business." Many resort restaurants
don't survive because they stay open all year round, she
adds.</p>
<p>But others find the way of life has its fair share of
problems. Mary-Lu Young remembers them from the 21 years that
she and her husband, Earl, ran gift stores in Highlands,
N.C., and Palm Beach, Fla.</p>
<p>Above all, Mrs. Young says she hadn't expected that she
would have to cater to different tastes in the two towns --
even among the same customers. In Palm Beach, she says, her
customers became much more glitzy. They wanted Italian
imports instead of the more traditional Southern goods in the
Highlands store.</p>
<p>Mr. and Mrs. Young had also expected to be able to take a
month's vacation between the seasonal moves. But the seasons
gradually extended in both resorts and soon began to overlap.
And "it's always difficult to get part-time help," especially
in an expensive resort town, she says.</p>
<p>For all the difficulties, Mrs. Young wouldn't have had it
any other way. "There's real variety with the sea and the
mountains," she says. Though she says high rent prompted the
couple to close the Palm Beach store, the Youngs still
operate the Highlands store and split their time between the
two resort towns. "Now we have the same life style without
the work."</p>
<p>Some think this way of life is more trouble than it is
worth. Joseph Dougherty runs Dock's, an oyster bar in
Atlantic City, N.J., that his grandfather opened 93 years
ago. In 1987, he opened another oyster bar in Jupiter, Fla.,
called "Dock's Since 1897." Now Mr. Dougherty closes the
Atlantic City business for all but three months of the year;
the Jupiter business remains open year round. For the three
months that he spends in Atlantic City, the Jupiter operation
is run by his son.</p>
<p>But Mr. Dougherty doesn't think he would do it again.
"Everybody thinks you must have the best of both worlds," he
says, "but in fact, you never have any time off." He says he
managed to soften the blow of opening the Florida business by
using architects and interior designers from Atlantic City.
But he still had to find employees and supervise the business
while he was in New Jersey.</p>
<p>Mr. Dougherty says having the second business brought his
family closer together. Still, he doesn't think that
justifies the work involved: "Now we're just running from one
place to another."</p>
<p>Yet many -- such as teachers -- find seasonal businesses
mesh well with their other activities. "It works out so
ideally," says Daniel Millea, a former teacher from Johnston,
R.I. "May to September you have to yourself . . . and this
coincides with the holiday season." He started the "Book
Nook," a book store in Block Island, R.I., 18 years ago.
Although meant to be a hobby "to keep body and soul together
during the summer vacations," it slowly turned into something
more profitable.</p>
