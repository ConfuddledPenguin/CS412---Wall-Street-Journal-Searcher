	<p class="article-leader">Peugeot S.A. Chairman Jacques Calvet said the French auto
maker is standing by its objective of maintaining its profit
for this year at the 1989 level of 10.3 billion francs ($1.96
billion).
   Mr. Calvet told reporters that Peugeot's consolidated
revenue is expected to rise at a slightly faster rate than
the 5.8% increase registered for the first half.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>He said that the European market for cars next year is
likely to contract 3% from this year, and that car sales this
year could ease to about 13.3 million vehicles from 13.4
million in 1989. He said the oil price increase resulting
from the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait means that Peugeot will
have to work harder to achieve its earnings goal.</p>
<p>Mr. Calvet said that it is too early to identify the final
effect of the Persian Gulf crisis on the French market, but
that demand this year will be boosted by tax cuts planned by
France, which is expected to announce this week that it will
reduce the top level of the value-added tax by three
percentage points to 22%.</p>
