	<p class="article-leader">I was surprised to read Paul A. Gigot's Aug. 17 "Potomac
Watch" column, which takes exception to my alleged position
on the current crisis in the Persian Gulf. The thrust of this
piece is that I am somehow leading the pack of post-Cold War
right-wing conservatives urging a return to traditional U.S.
isolationism.
   Most journalists -- even those who appear only on the
editorial page -- usually give a public figure the benefit of
a quote before going on to critique or characterize his point
of view. However, Mr. Gigot has failed to extend even this
minimal journalistic courtesy, so it is impossible for me to
know what has led him to this incorrect conclusion.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Since the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait, I have made numerous
public comments. By any objective standard, a reading of the
transcripts of those interviews demonstrates that I have
consistently emphasized:</p>
<p>-- One, that the U.S. has a vital interest in this region.</p>
<p>-- Two, that the U.S. had no alternative to responding to
the local nations' appeal for U.S. military assistance to
deter further Iraqi aggression.</p>
<p>-- Three, that the task of deterring Iraq from further
aggression and seeking the removal of its armed forces from
Kuwait is best handled by a multilateral response --
diplomatically, economically and militarily.</p>
<p>In this crisis, there are obviously dangers that we should
seek to minimize or avoid. For example, I have stressed that
a protracted U.S. large-scale ground presence in Saudi Arabia
would be difficult for the U.S. to sustain and over time
would cause severe problems for the Saudi government, both
within its own country and within the Arab world.
Consequently, I have urged that we follow a reinforcing
strategy, in which we emphasize air power, and that our
ground forces complement and support those deployed by
indigenous Arab governments, particularly Saudi Arabia and
Egypt. Should Iraq invade Saudi Arabia or use chemical
weapons, I have said that the U.S. should retaliate in a
massive way, with no sanctuaries for Iraq in its own
homeland.</p>
<p>If Mr. Gigot believes these views constitute an
"isolationist" position, then he is using a definition that
Webster's does not recognize.</p>
