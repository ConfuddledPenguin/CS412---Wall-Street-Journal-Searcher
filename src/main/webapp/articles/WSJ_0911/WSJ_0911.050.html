	<p class="article-leader">Your Aug. 22 editorial on South Africa is right on the
mark. Lebanon's factionalism is a far better analog for
understanding South Africa than is America's black
civil-rights movement. Seven years of living in Southern
Africa brought me to use the analogy of America's Indian
tribes similarly to make the dynamics comprehensible to my
American friends inexperienced in African political
realities.
   The attempts of black American politicos to exploit Nelson
Mandela for domestic political purposes have been shameful
but also somewhat burlesque. The realities of South Africa
are now beginning to overwhelm the artificial images
constructed for factional advantage in the U.S. and in
support of African National Congress hopes that America might
pull the rug from under the Boer government so that the ANC
could simply move into office -- a scenario perhaps modeled
on the perception of America's performance in Vietnam.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The Journal's somewhat contradictory role in helping
construct the artificial images should not be overlooked.
Despite its very accurate appraisals on the editorial page,
the Journal's front-page reporting often reflects the "civil
rights" stance properly decried as misleading by the editors.</p>
<p>With such mixed signals emanating from the Journal, the
reader must choose between the realities of the "news" and
those of the "opinions." I personally opt for the opinion
page, which more nearly coincides with my own experience, but
it detracts from the Journal's reputation for consistent
realism that it does not speak here with one voice.</p>
