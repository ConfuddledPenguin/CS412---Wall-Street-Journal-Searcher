	<p class="article-leader">Greyhound Dial Corp. said it acquired the Breck hair-care
products unit of American Cyanamid Corp. Terms of the
purchase weren't disclosed.
   Analysts estimated the price at about $50 million, $10
million less than Breck's revenue last year. A Dial executive
insisted the price was "well under that."</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>With 60 years of history behind it, Breck is a well-known
brand that has lost its sheen. Brooke Shields, Cybill
Shepherd and Kim Basinger were "Breck Girls" at the beginning
of their careers, and heavy print and TV advertising over the
years made it the market leader in shampoo. But Breck's share
of the hair-care market shrank drastically in recent years,
when American Cyanamid lost interest in its consumer products
group and stopped spending money on advertising and
promotion, analysts say.</p>
<p>"Customers in the hair-care market are notoriously
fickle," said analyst Bonita Austin of Wertheim Schroder &
Co. "There's little brand loyalty and they're
price-sensitive, so you've got to do a lot of promotion and
new-product introduction."</p>
<p>Although Breck's shampoo market share has shrunk to about
1.3% and its hair-spray business is its biggest line, Dial
plans to try to resuscitate the shampoo and conditioner lines
first. "We feel it was tired and it was resting," said the
president of the Dial unit, Andrew S. Patti, in an interview.
"What we want to do is wake it up." He said they will spend
ad dollars, use research and development to improve quality,
create more new products and modernize the image. "We're
going to be in there fighting all the time," Mr. Patti said.</p>
<p>Breck's hair spray had a 4% market share last year, but it
has fallen victim to spritzers and more modern names invading
the field. "Hair spray has a dowdy, old-fashioned image,"
says analyst Andrew Shore of Prudential-Bache Securities Inc.
"Dial will need to contemporize the image, change the
packaging and appeal to a younger audience, which
necessitates a much bigger advertising budget."</p>
<p>American Cyanamid, a Wayne, N.J., chemical company, has
been shedding its troubled Shulton Group consumer products
businesses since the beginning of the year. With the sale of
Breck, which American Cyanamid bought in 1963, the segment is
now defunct. The company divested itself of Old Spice, Lady's
Choice, Pine-Sol and Pierre Cardin fragrances to various
buyers, including Procter & Gamble Co., which will get
Breck's price deducted from the $370 million it agreed to pay
American Cyanamid for a number of consumer product lines
acquired last June.</p>
<p>Greyhound Dial, which sold its bus company in 1987 and
changed its name from Greyhound Corp. earlier this year, said
the acquisition would give Dial sales of more than $1 billion
a year. Greyhound Dial, Phoenix, Ariz., makes and markets a
number of consumer products including Dial soap, Brillo soap
pads, Purex Bleach and Armour Star canned meats. It also has
interests in transportation and financial services.</p>
