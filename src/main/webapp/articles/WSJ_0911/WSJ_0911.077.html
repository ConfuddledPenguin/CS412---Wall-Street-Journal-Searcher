	<p class="article-leader">Faced with a problem, the House did what comes naturally:
Voted to regulate it. The vote in the House yesterday was to
"reregulate" the price of basic cable TV service, after
receiving complaints of price increases and poor service. The
bill now will bring the FCC heavily into the cable business,
which is likely to ensure an industry in which innovation
becomes the lowest priority.</p>
