	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- Top Bush administration officials said
budget negotiations with congressional Democrats are making
little progress toward a deficit-reduction pact.
   "I would say that talks are going nowhere fast," Treasury
Secretary Nicholas Brady said on ABC's "Good Morning
America." And White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater told
reporters: "We are still hopeful but looking less and less
optimistic."</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Democratic negotiators weren't talking, but aides
confirmed that the talks are moving slowly. With little
progress to review, a planned meeting yesterday morning
between President Bush and congressional budget negotiators
was canceled.</p>
<p>Few details leaked from the fourth day of closed-door
talks at Andrews Air Force Base near here, but longstanding
differences about raising income-tax rates and cutting
capital-gains-tax rates were reportedly aired. Much of the
day was consumed by intraparty caucuses.</p>
<p>Some Democrats are uneasy about the possibility that Mr.
Bush will criticize them in his televised address to Congress
on the Middle East crisis scheduled for 9 p.m. today. But Mr.
Fitzwater said, "I don't expect any strong criticism in the
speech, rather it will be more geared to laying out our
objectives . . . why especially in view of the Persian Gulf
situation it's important that the U.S. put its domestic house
in order."</p>
<p>Without some agreement to reduce the deficit or alter the
Gramm-Rudman deficit-reduction law, about $85 billion in
across-the-board spending cuts will be triggered Oct. 1.</p>
