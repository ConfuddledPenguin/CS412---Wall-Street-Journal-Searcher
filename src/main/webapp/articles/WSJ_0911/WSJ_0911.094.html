	<p class="article-leader">By now, everyone in the U.S. seems to be aware of the
story of what New York City has become. A tourist from Utah
is stabbed on a subway platform, trying to defend his mother
from muggers. A young district attorney dies from a stray
bullet intended for someone else on the sidewalk. Children
get shot through steel-plated doors. Even street-smart New
Yorkers are astonished at the turmoil around them.
   Yet what New York has become is not impossible to
comprehend. We suggest that the key to understanding New
York's current distress won't be found in the usual treatises
on neglect, poverty and "resources." No, you can get a pretty
good idea of how New York got this way by looking at the
daily spectacle in front of a grocery store owned by Koreans
in Flatbush.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>It is a tableau of liberal politics gone utterly haywire.
Demonstrators led by self-anointed "black militants"
routinely hurl anti-Asian epithets toward the store and
distribute literature urging blacks not to buy from "people
who do not look like us." The leaflets don't just call for
the boycott of a particular Korean store that they have
charged with offending the black community. They tell blacks
they should "boycott all Korean stores." Passersby trying to
enter the stores are spat upon and threatened.</p>
<p>From the outset it was clear that the anti-Korean actions,
the handiwork of a fringe element, embarrassed many blacks,
inspiring some to brave the gauntlet and buy groceries from
the Koreans. One black schoolteacher defiantly led his
high-school students into one of the boycotted stores to buy
their lunch -- to teach them, he said, what democracy was all
about. The most telling detail, however, is that the police,
under orders, refuse to enforce a court order keeping
marchers 50 feet away from the store entrance. The law, in
short, is negotiable.</p>
<p>In lieu of enforcement, Mayor David Dinkins appointed an
"investigative panel" to look into the boycott of the Korean
stores. Its report, released in the middle of the recent
period of lawlessness, concluded that everyone involved is
guilty of something -- except the perpetrators of the
boycott. Repeating familiar litanies about the need for good
faith and negotiation, the mayor's panel, with a
head-in-the-sand evenhandedness, advises that "both sides of
the dispute" cease all inflammatory behavior.</p>
<p>This affair, though not as nationally prominent as the
crime stories, has been an important test of David Dinkins's
view of himself as a conciliator. Clearly Mayor Dinkins is
not a demagogue but a man of good intentions. Indeed, in the
past we have voiced support for his qualities of calm; the
city was on edge before he entered office. Yet by empirical
test, the conciliation strategy exemplified in his handling
of the anti-Korean boycott is not working. As the rest of the
nation now knows, the city's sores are getting worse instead
of better. Perhaps a tough stand on principle would do
better. Most especially for the people who live in the most
crime-ridden neighborhoods; tourists need not worry about
spending any time in the places where small children are
being shot.</p>
<p>Over a long period of years, urban liberals, black and
white, have tried to rationalize continuing urban
disintegration by resorting to a kind of sociologized
politics, with babble about "root causes," procedural
nitpicking in courtrooms, a juvenile justice system coddling
criminals-in-training, all set against the ritual invocation
of gun control as the patent medicine for all ills. Now, this
endlessly rationalized liberalism has been transformed into a
purely racial politics that attempts to legitimize fraudulent
political arguments and analogies, clearly evident in the
anti-Korean boycott. It shouldn't be too surprising that as
urban political leaders have persisted in peddling
doublethink and evasion, the main customers buying it are the
fringe fanatics and media-savvy hustlers.</p>
<p>The broader public is not buying. Juries are convicting,
whether it is white men accused of murder in Bensonhurst or
black men accused of assaulting the Central Park jogger. News
accounts of the latter deliberations depicted minority jurors
bringing along white holdouts. News accounts of the subway
stabbing suggest friends and relatives of some of the accused
see them as punks.</p>
<p>We think politicians incapable of absorbing elementary
truths clear to most ordinary citizens should start asking
themselves just whose interests they want to speak for -- the
political fringe or the people who elected them. Ultimately,
New York City's future, and that of other large U.S. cities,
turns crucially on the restoration of some respect for
civility and public order. While the legal system is far from
the whole of this, it is the starting point. Years of
paternalistic liberalism has turned the law into a system
laughed at by both criminals and citizens.</p>
<p>Having given conciliation its due day, Mayor Dinkins may
now be the right man to lead the stand for principle. He
can't be expected to restore respect for the law overnight,
but he can point the direction. The place to start is obvious
-- enforcing orders courts have already issued to protect
Korean greengrocers.</p>
