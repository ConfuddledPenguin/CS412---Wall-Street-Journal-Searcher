	<p class="article-leader">In the grand tradition of Harvard Business School
professors, Michael Porter requires an extraordinarily hefty
book to expand upon the following hypothesis: Active
competition for demanding customers in the home market keeps
companies under pressure to constantly innovate and upgrade.
Such Darwinian rivalry at home eventually produces a
competitive industry in world trade.
   This innocuous idea, imbedded in "The Competitive
Advantage of Nations" (Free Press, 855 pages, $35), has been
surprisingly controversial, greeted as either heresy or
revelation. Economists, for instance, seem annoyed with Mr.
Porter because he emphasizes case studies of particular
industries, such as the motion-picture industry in the U.S.
or printing presses in Germany. Further, he dismisses such
cherished "macroeconomic" statistics as budget deficits and
exchange rates.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"Nations have enjoyed rapidly rising living standards," he
notes, "despite budget deficits {Japan, Italy, Korea},
appreciating currencies {Germany and Switzerland}, and high
interest rates {Italy and Korea}."</p>
<p>A further source of irritation may be the way in which
this book immediately surrenders its title: "We must abandon
the whole notion of a `competitive nation' . . . The only
meaningful concept of competitiveness at the national level
is national productivity."</p>
<p>In fact, the concept of productivity has its limitations.
For example, output per worker might be increased,
Europeanstyle, by leaving all but the most productive workers
unemployed-through high minimum wages or formidable
restrictions on layoffs. But Mr. Porter doesn't really stick
to his own productivity standard for measuring national
success. Instead, he simply dismisses the recent doubling of
productivity growth in manufacturing in the U.S., from the
1970s to the 1980s.</p>
<p>This is "not yet a sign of fundamental change," he argues,
quickly switching to other measures of success, looking at
shares of world exports, or "outbound" foreign investment --
investment in other countries.</p>
<p>"Inbound foreign investment," he claims, "is never the
solution to a nation's competitive problems." Why not? Are we
really to believe that the U.S. doesn't make better cars
today as a result of the many Japanese factories on U.S.
soil? Would Canada really be as affluent as it is without all
the U.S. producers located there?</p>
<p>When criticizing the U.S., Mr. Porter wants to have it
both ways. If foreign companies invest in the U.S., he argues
that this means American firms are missing opportunities to
upgrade technology. If U.S. firms invest abroad, on the other
hand, Mr. Porter argues that this means American companies
(unlike foreign companies in the U.S.) do not know how to
produce efficiently in their own country.</p>
<p>Indeed, Mr. Porter's narrow concept of what constitutes a
"domestic" industry is archaic and provincial in a world of
transnational companies. His applause for the revival of the
Swiss watch industry, for example, neglects the fact that
several of the most famous Swiss brands are now owned by a
U.S. entrepreneur, North American Watch. Is a Chrysler with a
Mitsubishi engine really more "American" than a Ford Probe
LX, which is built in Michigan with a U.S. engine?</p>
<p>Aside from "outbound" foreign investment, the author's
only other measure of competitive advantage -- shares of
"world exports" -- is equally slanted against the U.S. World
exports have been heavily dominated by expanding exports to
the U.S., which is one race that U.S. firms can't even enter.
How could the U.S. be expected to export itself?</p>
<p>Mr. Porter draws pictures to illustrate his theory, with
four national attributes forming a "diamond" of competitive
advantage -- rivalry, demand conditions, factor conditions
and "clusters" of supporting industries. This is just a
pedagogic device for expanding a simple idea into hundreds of
pages, dividing it into four parts and four related "stages"
of development.</p>
<p>Under the category of "demand conditions," for example,
Mr. Porter asserts, without evidence, that American consumers
and retailers are no longer very "sophisticated." Yet this is
contradicted by his own chapter on services, which shows the
U.S. in the "leading position" in retailing.</p>
<p>Mr. Porter asserts that "high {educational} standards and
"a federal role in education" are "vital." Yet many
educational specialists are arguing for more diversity,
competition and choice in schooling. Since competition is the
driving force behind constant improvement in industry, why
should it not have the same effect in education?</p>
<p>The book's basic theme, that competition fosters
innovation, serves as a welcome antitoxin to the revival of
corporatist "social engineering" ideas that instead depict
competition as wasteful and cartels ("strategic alliances")
as innovative. It also serves to warn developing countries
not to penalize important domestic markets in favor of export
promotion. The case studies on how specific industries
prospered in various countries undoubtedly contain many
insights of value to business strategists.</p>
<p>Yet the title misleads. There is very little substance
here on the ways in which national policies, including tax,
trade and monetary policies, create more or less favorable
conditions for individuals and enterprises to generate
wealth.</p>
