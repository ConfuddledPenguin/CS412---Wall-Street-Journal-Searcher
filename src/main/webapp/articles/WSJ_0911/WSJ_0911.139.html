	<p class="article-leader">THE U.S. ASKED its NATO allies to send ground troops to
the Persian Gulf region.
   Secretary of State Baker also asked the alliance to
provide cargo ships and planes to move more Arab troops and
weapons to the area. The requests came as Iraq agreed to
restore full diplomatic relations with Iran and offered to
give away oil to Third World countries if they can arrange to
pick it up. Meanwhile, Baker said he will fly Thursday to
Syria -- a bitter foe of Iraq -- to try to cement the
U.S.-Arab coalition against Baghdad. A total of 161 Americans
from Kuwait arrived yesterday in Baltimore on an Iraqi
charter flight.</p>

Emirates and the exiled government of Kuwait agreed to
contribute $12 billion to the anti-Baghdad effort through the
end of this year.</p>

<p>LIBERIA'S DOE DIED after being shot in a clash with
rebels, reports said.</p>
<p>The State Department said it was informed that the
Liberian president, 38, who took power in 1980, died after
being captured by Prince Johnson's insurgent forces over the
weekend. On Sunday, Johnson declared himself president until
elections can be held. Meanwhile, Liberia's main rebel group,
led by Charles Taylor, said it would step up fighting,
dashing hopes for an end to the 8 1/2-month civil war that
has left 5,000 dead.</p>
<p>Doe had been interrogated by Johnson about missing funds,
witnesses told the BBC. The president's mutilated body was
displayed at a hospital, they said.</p>

<p>Moscow and Bonn reached an agreement on compensation to be
paid to the Soviets to help resettle returning soldiers after
the unification of Germany, Soviet Foreign Minister
Shevardnadze said, but he didn't provide details. West German
government aides said it was likely the two nations agreed on
a figure of about $7.6 billion.</p>
<p>German officials announced a $636 million contract to help
troubled East German farmers supply the shortage-plagued
Soviets with food and cigarettes. Deliveries of the surplus
goods are to begin in the next few days and continue through
June.</p>

<p>Baker said the U.S. is weighing more cuts in its European
forces as part of a pending arms-control agreement. He said
plans to limit U.S. forces in Central Europe to 195,000 had
been "overtaken by events," and cited the planned withdrawal
of Soviet forces from East Germany and an accord limiting a
united Germany's troops.</p>

<p>Cambodia's four warring factions signed an accord to set
up a joint council that would clear the way for a
U.N.-supervised settlement of an 11-year civil war. But the
groups traded accusations after the signing ceremony,
demonstrating the fragility of the agreement between the
guerrillas and the government.</p>

<p>Bhutto was charged with corruption by the army-backed
caretaker government in Pakistan, marking the first official
step toward possibly barring the ousted prime minister from
next month's election. Bhutto denied any wrongdoing, and
indicated the charges would be challenged in court.</p>

<p>Lt. Gov. Evelyn Murphy dropped out of the race for
Massachussetts governor less than a week after she took
charge in the absence of Dukakis and proposed steps to solve
the state's fiscal woes. Murphy, who was running third in
next Tuesday's Democratic primary, took command when the
governor left on a trip to Germany.</p>

<p>NASA crews worked to install a new set of fuel pumps on
the space shuttle Columbia in an effort to eliminate hydrogen
leaks so that the craft can be launched on an astronomy
mission early next week. The agency's third attempt to launch
Columbia, carrying seven astronauts and a $150 million
observatory, was halted during fueling last week.</p>

<p>Pope John Paul II blessed a multimillion-dollar basilica
in the Ivory Coast as he ended a 10-day tour of four African
nations. The cost of the Basilica of Our Lady of Peace,
completed last year in Yamoussoukro, has been controversial
in the West African nation, which is suffering its worst
economic crisis in 30 years.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>South Africa proposed a way for segregated public schools
to become integrated private schools if parents vote in favor
of such a change. The nation's private schools are allowed to
admit pupils of all races, but rigid segregation in the state
sector has been a fundamental principle of apartheid.</p>
