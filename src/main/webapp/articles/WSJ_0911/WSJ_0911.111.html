	<p class="article-leader">Thomas & Betts Corp., a Bridgewater, N.J., maker of
electrical and electronic connectors, parts and systems, said
it plans to take a third-quarter charge equal to 43 cents a
share, and to cut 5%, or about 250, of its workers.
   The moves, stemming from a consolidation of manufacturing
operations and cuts in operating costs, should save the
company about $10 million a year, a spokesman said. The
planned charge is about $13 million before taxes but will be
partly offset by a pretax gain of $4 million from the
disposal of real estate and certain other assets. In the 1989
third quarter, Thomas & Betts earned $12.1 million, or 71
cents a share, on revenue of $131.3 million.</p>
