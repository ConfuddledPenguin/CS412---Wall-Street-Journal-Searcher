	<p class="article-leader">AT&T Capital Corp. said it purchased U.S. Instrument
Rentals Inc., a subsidiary of Ford Motor Co.'s U.S. Leasing
International unit. Terms weren't disclosed.
   The financing unit of American Telephone & Telegraph Co.,
the New York telecommunications giant, said U.S. Instrument's
managers will remain in place.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>U.S. Instrument, with assets of $120 million, finances
general-purpose, chemical and analytical test equipment and
data equipment. Based in San Mateo, Calif., it has 280
employees with distribution centers in San Carlos, Calif.,
and Dallas.</p>
<p>Thomas C. Wajnert, president and chief executive officer
of AT&T Capital, said U.S. Instrument "will serve as the core
of a new line of business for AT&T Capital."</p>
<p>Separately, AT&T said it began its Global Messaging
service in Canada. Canada is the fourth country where AT&T
has introduced the facsimile and electronic mail service.
Although the portfolio of messaging services is a "relatively
small piece of the total communications market, the segment
promises dramatic growth in the coming years," AT&T said.</p>
