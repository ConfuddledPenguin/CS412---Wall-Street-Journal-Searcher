	<p class="article-leader">PARIS -- Rhone-Poulenc S.A. said it will sell more assets
that aren't central to its core activities to help defray the
cost of its $2 billion acquisition of Rorer Group Inc. of
Fort Washington, Pa.
   Rhone-Poulenc Chairman Jean-Rene Fourtou said asset sales
for all of 1990 could give the chemicals and pharmaceuticals
group between one billion francs ($190 million) and 1.5
billion francs ($285 million) in fresh cash. He declined to
identify which of the group's sectors would be affected by
the new asset sales, however.</p>
