	<p class="article-leader">McDonnell Douglas Corp. said it would restructure its
retiree benefit plan, allowing it to recognize a $234 million
gain in the third quarter.
   News of the windfall, equal to $6.11 a share, helped raise
the struggling aerospace concern's price on the New York
Stock Exchange yesterday; it finished in composite trading at
$48.75, up $1.125</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>An accounting adjustment will be made as the St. Louis
concern transfers its benefit obligations for 14,200 salaried
retirees, currently covered by an overfunded
company-administered pension plan, to a group annuity
contract with Metropolitan Life Insurance Co. The action will
decrease the number of liabilities in the company-run fund,
which will still have 26,400 participants. In turn, the plan
will become even more overfunded than before, allowing for
the third-quarter gain.</p>
<p>At the end of 1989, the plan had $5.9 billion in assets
and was overfunded about $2 billion.</p>
<p>McDonnell Douglas stressed that the annuity arrangement
"in no way alters the benefits due affected retirees or the
manner in which the payments are made." In fact, it said the
new system will "strengthen the benefit security" for
salaried employees. It noted that other corporations,
including Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co., Manufacturers Hanover
Corp. and Edison Brothers Stores Inc., have taken similar
steps.</p>
<p>In the past, however, the Pentagon has stepped in when
defense contractors have tinkered with their overfunded
pension plans, saying the government is entitled to at least
some of the assets because money poured into these funds was
derived from military contracts.</p>
<p>Just last month, for example, the Defense Department's
inspector general's office disclosed that it was
investigating whether Ford Motor Co. should be able to remove
$100 million from the pension fund of its aerospace unit
before selling the subsidiary to Loral Corp. In addition,
according to a 1989 Bear Stearns study, FMC Corp. and
Fairchild Industries attempted to recapture their excess
pension funds, but had to share or give back the surplus to
the Pentagon.</p>
<p>But the McDonnell Douglas situation appears different.</p>
<p>Although the company's equity position will improve as a
result of its deal with Metropolitan Life, it is not
terminating its pension plan, as has happened in other cases,
and it will receive no cash as a result of the transaction.
"There appears to be a real distinction here," said Lawrence
Harris, a securities analyst who follows McDonnell Douglas
for Bateman Eichler, Hill Richards Inc., a Los Angeles
brokerage firm.</p>
<p>"Not a penny will change hands," added Jerry Cantwell, of
Wertheim Schroder & Co. in New York. A Pentagon spokesman
said he couldn't comment on the particulars of the McDonnell
Douglas move.</p>
<p>Actually, the company has been recording asset gains to
recognize the overfunded portion of its pension plan since
changing its accounting methods in 1987. The pact with
Metropolitan Life -- the precise terms of which weren't
disclosed -- will merely allow McDonnell Douglas to
accelerate the recognition of that situation and adjust its
books all at once; smaller gains will continue to be
amortized in the future.</p>
<p>In the year-ago third quarter, McDonnell Douglas posted
net income of $38 million, or 98 cents a share, on sales of
$3.72 billion. The results included an extraordinary gain of
$6 million, or 14 cents a share, for the divestiture of the
bulk of the company's information systems group.</p>
<p>McDonnell Douglas, the nation's No. 1 defense contractor,
also got a lift last week when the U.S. said it completed
negotiations with South Korea for the sale of 120 of the
company's F/A-18 jet fighters to Seoul. Moreover, analysts
noted, the Persian Gulf crisis has been a boon by providing
an opportunity for more F/A-18 and F-15 jet sales to the
Middle East.</p>
<p>Before the pension-plan announcement, Mr. Harris said he
expected McDonnell Douglas to earn about 50 cents a share in
the current period, reflecting possible cost overruns on some
military programs and continued development expenses on the
new MD-11 commercial jetliner. Still, Herbert Lanese,
McDonnell Douglas's chief financial officer, said in a recent
interview that a massive cost-cutting drive initiated in July
would begin to bear fruit soon. "You should see some effect
in the third quarter, and it will really kick in in the
fourth," he said.</p>
