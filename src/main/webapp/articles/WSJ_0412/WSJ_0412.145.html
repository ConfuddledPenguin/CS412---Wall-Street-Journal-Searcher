	<p class="article-leader">The fierce battle between the Los Angeles Times and the
Orange County Register newspapers for the hearts and minds of
one of California's richest counties has entered a new arena:
cable television news.
   The Orange County edition of the Times is teaming with
Walt Disney Co.'s KCAL-TV in Los Angeles and Turner
Broadcasting Inc.'s Cable News Network to produce a TV news
program for Orange County, home to more than two million
people south of Los Angeles. The show is believed to be the
first news venture to join a newspaper, TV station and cable
operators.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The service, set to debut Monday, will consist of 4
1/2-minute news summaries appearing every half hour on
Turner's CNN Headline News. The segments will be produced by
KCAL's regular news staff in Hollywood from its own coverage
and stories in the Times's Orange County edition.</p>
<p>In January, the Register's owners unveiled plans for a
cable TV service to air next fall. To carry the service,
dubbed Orange County NewsChannel, cable operators have been
recruited representing about 200,000 subscribers, or about
half the cable households in the county. The Times, which
first reported the new venture in yesterday's editions, said
it initially will be available to about the same number of
subscribers as the Register's service.</p>
<p>Executives at the Times and Freedom Newspapers Inc., which
owns the Register, stressed the differences in their ventures
and downplayed the competitive aspects. The Times is owned by
Times Mirror Co.</p>
<p>The Times-KCAL venture is for brief local segments that
would air as part of an existing national news program.
Freedom Newspapers is planning a 24-hour news program geared
to Orange County.</p>
<p>"There's plenty of room for both services," said Alan J.
Bell, president of Freedom Newspapers's broadcasting
division. Jeffrey S. Klein, assistant to the Times's
publisher noted that there isn't anything to prevent a cable
company from carrying both services. Orange County is
underserved by local television stations that mainly feature
Los Angeles news, both men agreed.</p>
<p>"What Freedom is doing is much more risky and ambitious,"
said Tom Adams, an analyst with Paul Kagan Associates Inc., a
Carmel, Calif., media research firm. It's unclear whether
there's an appetite for local round-the-clock news. But Mr.
Adams predicted that in the current depressed advertising
environment more newspapers will be looking at TV and other
ventures that enable them to "repackage the news for profit."</p>
<p>Mr. Bell said that Freedom is "starting from scratch" and
recruiting a whole staff of TV news people. Freedom is
investing "multiple millions of dollars" in the project, he
said. Mr. Bell was president of the broadcasting group of
Lorimar-Telepictures Corp. until last year. For seven years
in the 1970s, he was vice president and general manager of
the NBC-TV affiliate in Philadelphia.</p>
<p>KCAL, purchased by Disney in 1988, recently launched an
innovative three-hour prime-time news program that has been
struggling in local ratings. News director Bob Henry said
that the Times would become a "new source of editorial
material for us." KCAL has 10 television vans, but no Orange
County bureau. KCAL will have access to some stories before
they are published in the Times, although the newspaper would
be able to preserve certain stories' exclusivity, Mr. Henry
said.</p>
<p>The Orange County edition of the Times has daily
circulation of about 196,000. The Register, published in
Santa Ana, Calif., has daily circulation of about 347,679.</p>
