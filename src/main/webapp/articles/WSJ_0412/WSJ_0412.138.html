	<p class="article-leader">GORBACHEV WARNED that changing internal borders would
prompt unrest.
   Amid a secession bid by Lithuania, the Soviet leader said
in televised remarks that redrawing the internal borders
would lead to "bloody carnage." More than 100 ethnic groups
inhabit the Soviet Union, and many are clamoring for lands
that were historically theirs and for more freedom from
Moscow. He also accused a bloc of Communist Party
progressives of wanting to restore capitalism, and the
Kremlin decided against an economic embargo on Lithuania.</p>

<p>EAST GERMAN LEADERS REACHED agreement on forming a
government.</p>
<p>After three weeks of talks, Prime Minister-designate de
Maiziere announced a coalition of conservatives, Social
Democrats, and liberal parties. The government is expected to
be endorsed by the legislature today, clearing the way for
reunification talks with West Germany. The coalition accord
appeared to be a compromise between the Social Democrats, who
favor a slow approach, and the conservatives, who want a
quick merger.</p>
<p>The U.S. rejected a suggestion by Soviet Foreign Minister
Shevardnadze that a united Germany temporarily be part of
both NATO and the Warsaw Pact.</p>

<p>ISRAEL'S PERES FAILED in an attempt to form a new
governing coalition.</p>
<p>In a blow to prospects for early peace talks with
Palestinians, two religious lawmakers defected from the Labor
Party leader's coalition just as the Knesset was about to
begin a special session to approve the cabinet. Israeli
President Herzog gave Peres an additional 15 days to form a
government to replace the coalition that collapsed March 15
over Prime Minister Shamir's refusal to accept U.S. proposals
for Mideast peace.</p>
<p>Herzog, in an apparent reference to Israel's electoral
system, said recent political haggling raised "questions
about . . . our political culture."</p>

<p>The FBI arrested a man wanted in connection with the 1976

conspiracy to murder a foreign official. He is the third
person arrested in the case.</p>

<p>British officials impounded a shipment of suspected gun

nuclear triggers headed for Baghdad were confiscated.</p>

<p>A car bomb exploded on a highway bridge in the Colombian
city of Medellin as a police patrol was passing, killing at
least 14 people, authorities said. There wasn't any immediate

traffickers have been recently killing police in retaliation
for a government crackdown on illegal drugs.</p>

<p>A U.S. paratrooper was charged with premeditated murder
and aggravated assault stemming from incidents that allegedly
occurred during the Panama invasion, Army officials said. The

<p>A study found that doctors at a for-profit health clinic
chain increased the number of patient laboratory and X-ray
examinations when they were offered bonuses to increase their
clinics' revenues. Some health care experts have expressed
concern that such incentives can cloud a doctor's judgment in
prescribing care.</p>

<p>France insisted that it hadn't dealt with terrorists in
negotiating the release in Lebanon of three hostages. A

Tuesday by Abu Nidal's Libyan-backed Palestinian extremist
group. Amid mounting criticism, Paris also denied paying a
ransom of three warplanes to Gadhafi.</p>

charitable organization "needs to be run efficiently."</p>

health insurance, and that Hispanics are more likely to be
uninsured than either whites or blacks.</p>
