	<p class="article-leader">You can refine crude oil into gasoline or crush soybeans
into meal without getting your hands dirty.
   All you need is an account at a commodities broker -- plus
a willingness to make a fairly complicated trade with some
significant risk. Product spreads in crude oil and soybeans
are traded every day -- even by people who wouldn't recognize
a barrel of West Texas Intermediate crude or a bushel of
soybeans if they were sitting next to one of them.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Though the raw materials used in oil refineries and
soybean processing plants are not similar, the mechanics of
trading product spreads based on them are nearly identical.
In each case, one side of the spread is the futures contract
for the raw material. The other side of the spread is the
contract based on what is made from the raw material-gasoline
and heating oil in one case, or soybean meal and soybean oil
in the other.</p>
<p>A futures contract is an obligation to buy or deliver a
specified quantity of a commodity, such as soybeans or
gasoline, at the agreed-upon price by a certain date. In
practice, however, most futures contracts aren't used to
transfer ownership of a commodity, but are simply nullified
by opposite trades.</p>
<p>Traders of commodity product spreads do so for two reasons
-- the lower risk and less money required to secure positions
than in some other futures trades. The lower risk comes about
from the hedged nature of the spreads. For example, usually
if the price of crude oil goes up, so will the price of the
products made from it. But the products do not move in
perfect lockstep with the raw material from which they are
made; if they did, there would be neither risk nor a profit
opportunity from trading product spreads.</p>
<p>Consider an example of a so-called crack spread. Because
about 70% of the crude oil in a barrel is refined, or
"cracked," into gasoline and heating oil, it is possible to
set up a trade between crude oil and its major products. The
most common trade assumes that three barrels of crude are
refined into two barrels of gasoline and one barrel of
heating oil.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the three contracts are not quoted on the
same basis. A crude oil contract is 1,000 barrels of 42
gallons each, priced in dollars per barrel. The gasoline and
heating oil contracts are each 42,000 gallons and are quoted
in dollars per gallon. The accompanying table shows how to
put all three commodities on a common basis.</p>
<p>Traders believe that a refiner turning three barrels of
crude into two barrels of gasoline and one barrel of heating
oil requires that the value of the products exceeds the value
of the crude by approximately $3 a barrel to break even.
Currently, a commodities broker will ask an investor to
deposit a minimum of $3,000 in margin or good-faith money to
initiate a trade on a crack spread using the 3:2:1 ratio.</p>
<p>While an investor doesn't need a lot of money to trade a
crack spread, a move of only $1 a barrel in the spread
between crude oil and product prices would produce a profit
or loss of $3,000 per spread trade. Since May 1988, the
premium of the products over crude oil has ranged from under
$1 a barrel in February 1989 to over $10 a barrel in December
1989, reflecting the supply and demand both for crude oil and
for its refined products. The futures contracts for crude
oil, heating oil and gasoline in a crack spread all trade on
the New York Mercantile Exchange.</p>
<p>A few weeks ago, Philip Gotthelf, publisher of the
Commodity Futures Forecast, decided that a reverse crack
spread looked appealing. So he recommended buying contracts
for heating oil and gasoline and selling the crude-oil
contract with the spread at around $4 a barrel. He believed
that both the Soviet Union and Mexico were ready to sell
large quantities of crude oil to raise foreign exchange.
Whatever the cause, he was right about the trade; the premium
of the products over crude has now moved up to about $4.73 a
barrel as the supply of crude oil has increased.</p>
<p>Soybeans have a value only after they have been crushed,
converting them from a legume into soybean meal, widely used
as an animal feed, and soybean oil, used in many food
products. A "crush spread" is set up by buying soybean
futures contracts and selling the contracts for soybean meal
and soybean oil, hoping that the products' value will
decrease over the value of the beans. A "reverse crush" is
initiated when an investor believes the value of the products
will increase relative to the value of the beans.</p>
<p>And just as in the energy trade, the three futures
contracts of the crush spread aren't quoted on a common
basis. Soybeans are quoted in dollars per bushel, with a
contract equal to 5,000 bushels. A soybean meal contract is
for 100 tons, with the price stated in dollars per ton; the
soybean oil contract is for 60,000 pounds, with a price
specified in dollars per pound.</p>
<p>To place the three commodities on a common basis, it is
necessary to take into account that a bushel of soybeans will
crush into about 48 pounds of meal and 11 pounds of oil. The
value of the products in excess of the value of the beans is
termed the crush margin. The table details how the conversion
is carried out.</p>
<p>This spread is frequently done using one contract of each
of the three commodities. For this ratio, an investor would
have to post good-faith or margin money of about $400 to
initiate a crush or reverse crush trade. However, a more
accurate match between soybeans and its products is obtained
by using 10 soybean contracts, 12 meal contracts and nine oil
contracts. This trade would require margin money of about
$4,000. Contracts for soybeans and soybean products all trade
on the Chicago Board of Trade.</p>
<p>A common crush spread involves the November soybean
contract and the December contracts for meal and oil. During
the 1986-87 crop year beginning September 1, the value of the
products over the beans sank to an 11-year-low of only 20.7
cents per bushel. During the 1989-90 crop year, this premium
set an 11-year high of $1.49 a bushel. Over 11 years, the
crush spread moved on average by 51 cents a year, or $2,550
per spread trade. When the spread is done using one contract
each of beans, meal and oil, each penny change in the crush
margin is worth $50 in profit or loss to an investor.</p>
<p>Mr. Gotthelf of Commodity Futures Forecast believes the
Soviet Union is going to be more interested in buying
soybeans than the products. That would lead him to consider
doing a crush spread by buying the beans and selling the
products. "Historically, beans are cheap," he says.</p>
