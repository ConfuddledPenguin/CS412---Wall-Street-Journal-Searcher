	<p class="article-leader">Privatization, launched in the First World by Margaret
Thatcher and her team of "free-market" theocrats is now
raging through Latin America and Eastern Europe at precisely
the moment Mrs. Thatcher's popularity plummets to record lows
in the U.K. and Britain's economic "revival" turns out to be
hollow.
   From Mexico to Argentina to Warsaw economists trained in
the U.S. are pushing through drastic deflationary onslaughts
on old structures of state ownership and employment, on
subsidies and public patronage, and even on private assets.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The "free-market" onslaught was promoted in its most
disastrously naked guise in Bolivia, where Harvard's Jeffrey
Sachs, now on retainer in Poland and Czechoslovakia, urged a
scorched-earth assault on hyperinflation. Under his direction
the state simply closed down, with huge chunks of the labor
force turned out on the streets and much significant economic
activity ceasing altogether. Inflation stopped, but so did
everything else, and soon Bolivia was urgently seeking advice
elsewhere on how to get things going again. Some Poles have
taken note of this sorry tale.</p>
<p>A rather more ominous story is unfolding in Brazil, which,
in contrast to a Bolivian economy sustained mostly by coca
cultivation, is the eighth-largest economy in the world.</p>
<p>In December, at the climax of a very tight race between
the Socialist Workers Party candidate, Lula, and the former
governor of the state of Alagoas, Fernando Collor de Mello,
victory was snatched by Mr. Collor, who had been denouncing
state corruption and who had seized some of Lula's lightning
by a populist message to Brazil's millions of desperately
poor.</p>
<p>No sooner had Mr. Collor taken office in March than he
announced a savage program of retrenchment and deflation. His
plan implied one of the most abrupt attempts at
centralization of power in political memory, designed to give
him and his advisers discretionary powers over state and
private assets undreamed of by the military regime.</p>
<p>Mr. Collor's deflationary plan, enacted March 16, one day
after he took office, was to freeze all bank accounts and
change the currency. All funds over approximately $1,000
would revert from the accounts in which they had been lodged
to named accounts in Brazil's Central Bank, where they would
remain for 18 months and then be paid back to their holders
in 12 monthly installments, tying up the confiscated funds
for more than two years.</p>
<p>Whom did this confiscation affect? Most bank accounts are
the purview of Brazil's less wealthy -- shopkeepers,
unionized laborers, cab drivers, small businessmen, etc.
Those with more cash generally invested in Brazil's
"overnight" market in speculative bonds and currencies that
yielded rates well above inflation. Virtually all large
corporate groups held their millions in the "overnight"
market or took their money overseas.</p>
<p>Mr. Collor and his economic team froze the "overnight" in
a manner quite different from the confiscation of checking
and savings accounts. Twenty percent of the assets in a given
"overnight" account could be reclaimed, while 80% would be
confiscated into the Central Bank for 18 months. As the
Brazilian economy went into shock and prices crashed, those
with any cash at all -- notably the 20% available to
"overnight" account holders -- were, relatively speaking, in
a position to take advantage of such opportunities as a stock
market that lost 60% of its value, or to purchase state
enterprises for sale at 30% of their value.</p>
<p>Furthermore, people with substantial fortunes seized by
the government are already making arrangements to get their
money back, negotiating lucrative concessions and so forth.
In this sense, Mr. Collor's seizure of assets has amounted to
economic hostage-taking to consolidate his political base.
The more than $100 billion now concentrated in the Central
Bank fund is at the disposition of Mr. Collor, who will
decide which companies get their money back and on what
terms. This creates a tremendous potential for corruption.</p>
<p>Mr. Collor has also struck down barriers to foreign
investment, permitting international investors to pick up
tempting portions of Brazil's crumbling economic masonry, as
well as mineral concessions, at bargain-basement prices. An
unconfirmed report in the Jornal do Brasil recently had
Japanese investors agreeing to assume responsibility for
Brazil's external debt in exchange for rights to all the gold
reserves in the Amazon. Simultaneously, he has cleared away
restrictions on imports, and this will further erode Brazil's
domestic economy.</p>
<p>What has Mr. Collor's program meant in the short term?
There have been big layoffs, with more than 20,000 workers
idled inside a month. A large portion, up to 90% of the auto
and machine capacity of the state of Sao Paulo -- the
economic core of Brazil -- has closed down and more than
10,000 government employees are soon to be laid off. Banks
and businesses have failed by the dozen.</p>
<p>Well-publicized arrests of jewelers, and supermarket and
business executives charged with various economic crimes,
have burnished Mr. Collor's populist image while the country
spirals into depression and its assets are thrown on the
international auction block. Mr. Collor's popularity is
running at 75% approval. The little guy is able to say that
at least he has the same bank balance -- $1,000 -- as the
richest man in Brazil, ignoring the situation of the
"overnight." This popularity is terrorizing Congress into
compliance. Brazil's powerful unions, which led the assault
against the military, now find themselves under direct
threat. Their gains had been most palpable within the
state-controlled steel and oil industries. But state
corporations -- notably Siderbras, the state steel industry
-- will soon be for sale, with new and hostile ownership in
view.</p>
<p>Mr. Collor's program amounts to a form of fascism: abrupt
concentration of power in the executive, personal control
over allocation of resources in the economy, a scrim of
populist rhetoric.</p>
<p>Mr. Collor's economic strategy is reform-by-dismemberment,
the model currently being essayed in Poland and nervously
heralded earlier this week in Moscow by Mikhail Gorbachev's
economic adviser, Leonid Abalkin. The plan outlined by Mr.
Abalkin and reported in the Western press on Tuesday
similarly looks to shutdown of state enterprises, untrammeled
foreign investment, mass unemployment, annulling of workers'
rights as the only way forward. Call that fascism, too, or
perhaps Market Stalinism, with "market discipline" imposed by
dictatorial fiat, the worst of both systems.</p>
<p>So the newly emerging world model is not the notional
"free market" but authoritarian capitalism as dreamed of by
leaders from Santiago, Buenos Aires through London to
Beijing. For Mrs. Thatcher, a response came, violently, last
week in the form of protests against the poll tax. For the
leaders in Beijing, an answer came in Tiananmen Square. Mr.
Gorbachev awaits the retort of the Soviet working class. In
Latin America, moving from military fascism to market fascism
(or enduring both simultaneously), the fate of these
strategies will similarly be settled in the streets.</p>
