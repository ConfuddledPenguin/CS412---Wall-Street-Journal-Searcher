	<p class="article-leader">AUSTIN -- Texas State Treasurer Ann Richards won a
decisive victory over Attorney General Jim Mattox in a
Democratic gubernatorial primary that sets up a Texas-sized
brawl with Republican Clayton Williams in the fall.
   Mrs. Richards, a recovered alcoholic, rode out a storm of
criticism from the pugnacious Mr. Mattox, who repeatedly
called on her to say if she had ever used illegal drugs. She
tried to deflect the question by charging that Mr. Mattox had
profited from his years in public service, and she called on
him to release his federal income-tax returns. It was, by any
standard, one of the nastiest campaigns in Texas political
history.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Mrs. Richards won more than 600,000 votes, or 57%, while
Mr. Mattox picked up more than 460,000 votes, or 43%.</p>
<p>Mr. Mattox said Mrs. Richards "has proven that she's a
very strong candidate" and pledged to help her in an uphill
campaign against the GOP's Mr. Williams, a banker, oil man
and rancher who spent $8 million, $6 million of it from his
own deep pockets, to win his party's nomination.</p>
