	<p class="article-leader">TORONTO -- John Kachmar resigned as president and chief
executive officer of Dickenson Mines Ltd. after management
lost a proxy battle with the gold mining company's major
shareholder, which succeeded in unseating two of Dickenson's
directors.
   Robert McEwen, chairman of Dickenson and president of
Toronto-based Goldcorp Investments Ltd., which owns 70% of
Dickenson's shares, said the company's direction won't change
because of the resignation of Mr. Kachmar, 53 years old.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The Dickenson board later elected Mr. McEwen to the
additional post of chief executive. David Libby, chief
operating officer, was named to the additional position of
president.</p>
<p>Mr. Kachmar, who has led Dickenson for the past nine
years, said at the annual meeting that his resignation is
"part of an orderly and normal process." He said he will
remain a Dickenson director, but he wouldn't elaborate on the
reasons for his resignation from the executive posts.</p>
<p>In the proxy battle, two of Dickenson's directors were
succeeded by Goldcorp nominees. Mr. McEwen said the rival
nominations were made to place more mining engineers on the
Dickenson board.</p>
<p>James McCartney, a long-term Dickenson director who lost
his seat, said Mr. Kachmar agreed to resign under pressure
from Mr. McEwen. Mr. McCartney, a lawyer, said the change in
top management breaches a covenant of Dickenson's 38 million
Canadian dollar (US$32.8 million) gold loan and will probably
lead to Dickenson's having to refinance the loan on less
favorable terms.</p>
<p>Mr. McEwen said his views "differ" from Mr. McCartney's,
but he wouldn't elaborate.</p>
