	<p class="article-leader">London -- Given the highly publicized tilt toward greed
now in the Soviet Union, few entrepreneurial schemes there
should surprise readers of this paper. But here is something
startling. Earlier this month, Sotheby's in London sold
13,000 bottles of Russian wine for more than $1 million.
   Sotheby's chairman, the Earl of Gowrie, told me he was
very pleased with the results, as the auctioneers had
predicted a total of only just over $800,000. Buyers included
many well-known wine merchants from both the East and West
Coasts of the U.S., Germany and Australia; but most of the
top prices -- especially for those bottles with a Czarist
provenance -- were paid by private buyers.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Russian wine does not have a good name. Few wine reference
books have a kind word to say about it, and some omit the
Soviet Union altogether, though its production of drinks such
as the saccharine Georgian ersatz "champanski" is large.</p>
<p>Yet Sotheby's sold three bottles of superb Russian wine
that are 150 years old, and still very drinkable. These
bottles from the 1830s were made for the Czar of All the
Russias, from grapes grown in the area around the Imperial
Family's summer palace at Livadia, in the Crimea. They were
served at the czar's table, and also were used for royal
christenings and coronations. They were bought by Cherry
Ripe, a well-known Australian journalist, for $1,732, nearly
three times Sotheby's pre-sale estimate. (To my own taste,
this was the most attractive style of wine in the sale.)</p>
<p>The wines -- some of which were original bottlings with
the imperial seal, the double-headed eagle, embossed in the
glass -- were consigned to Sotheby's for sale by the still
extant winery at Massandra, just outside Yalta in the Crimea.
The most expensive of these, three bottles of Livadia White
Port 1891, went for $4,223 a bottle to a Swiss buyer,
breaking the world-record price for vintage port. He also
bought the other two most expensive lots of the day.</p>
<p>The sale was a triumph for Nikolai Boyko, the
worker-elected managing director of the Massandra winery, who
was in London for the event.</p>
<p>Sotheby's wine expert, David Molyneux-Berry, had first
heard of the Massandra "Collection" (as the Soviets call it
themselves) 16 years ago, when he was actually shown a list
of some of the Massandra wines by one of those
hard-to-pin-down companies specializing in East-West trade
"arrangements." The Cyrillic letters were smudgy, the wine
sounded outlandish, nobody could explain how the wine would
be got out of the U.S.S.R., and the whole deal had the air of
a hoax.</p>
<p>But then last year Sotheby's held a well-publicized and
financially successful sale of work by contemporary Soviet
painters in Moscow, and the Massandra Collection surfaced
again. This time the auction house was interested.</p>
<p>Last October I visited the Massandra "factory" in the
Crimea myself, in company with Mr. Molyneux-Berry; Peter
Batkin, a wonderful, flamboyant Sotheby's man who is capable
of solving problems others find insoluble; and Sergei
Alekseyevich Alayeve, the general director of joint ventures
at the Ministry of Agriculture, who takes a close interest in
the fortunes of Massandra.</p>
<p>Sergei Alekseyevich is New Gorbachev Man, totally
committed to economic and social reconstruction. The sort of
person who wants to wear good clothes and eat in good
restaurants, he also wants to extend these privileges to
every Soviet citizen. When he met Mr. Batkin, he knew he
could help put Massandra back on the map.</p>
<p>The brief history of the winery is that it was founded
between 1894 and 1897 to supply the czar's summer place at
nearby Livadia. In fact wine had been made in the region
since the 1820s, when Count Mikhail Vorontsov, then said to
be the richest man in Russia, imported many French wine
varieties into the Crimea. His wine-making efforts at first
failed, as he was trying to imitate French table wines. In
the 1880s his interests were taken up by Prince Lev Golitzin,
who first tried to make "champagne," but finally realized
that the soil and climate were better suited to the
production of sweet dessert and fortified wines. (The current
wine-making team at Massandra claims, and Mr. Molyneux-Berry
agrees, that these types of wine, despite their copycat names
of "port," "sherry" and "Madeira," cannot be produced
anywhere in the world except on the south coast of the
Crimea.)</p>
<p>Under Golitzin there began a dynasty of wine makers at
Massandra, starting with Aleksandr Yegorov, who lived to the
age of 95, having survived the 1917 Revolution and the
nationalization of the Massandra winery. He was under the
personal protection of Stalin's henchman Anastas Mikoyan,
then commissar for the food industry, who invited Yegorov to
return to take over Massandra in 1936, despite his
pre-revolutionary connection.</p>
<p>His daughter Tatyana, also a wine maker and the second
member of the dynasty working at Massandra, had married an
aristocrat, Dmitri Rakovich, a colonel in one of the czar's
regiments and a fellow officer of the writer Lermontov.
Rakovich was shot by the secret police in 1937. His son is
the current wine maker of Massandra-Yuri Dmitrievich Yegorov,
who, following his father's execution, suppressed the
patronymic and took his mother's surname.</p>
<p>Mikoyan extended the same protection to Yuri, and he
helped his grandfather evacuate the Massandra Collection in
the early part of 1941. The Nazis entered Yalta on Nov. 8,
but the Yegorovs had finished dispatching and hiding the
collection in three separate locations in the Soviet Union on
Sept. 21st. The 1941 vintage was still in vat; to keep it
from the Germans, they opened the taps and let it run out
into the Black Sea. Late in 1944 the Yegorovs began returning
the collection, and by the time of the Yalta Conference in
February 1945 it was back in place.</p>
<p>The collection I saw now stands at more than a million
bottles, of which the youngest is 15 years old.</p>
<p>Why did the workers' committee of Massandra want to sell
even this small (but historic) chunk of the vinous equivalent
of its crown jewels? One reason, Mr. Yegorov told me, was
simply to raise hard currency to improve their plant and
equipment. The other was to establish a pricing mechanism for
their seriously under-appreciated current wine production:
"The National Agricultural Industry doesn't take quality into
account when fixing prices. So apple wine costs the same as
our wine in the shops."</p>
<p>Massandra faced the same problem that bedevils other
Soviet manufacturers of first-class goods: making the price
of its commodity equal its true value. The answer, thought
the people concerned at the winery, was to leap head-first
into capitalism, to export a small fraction of their best
wines by selling them at a public auction, conducted by the
world's most famous auctioneers, in London, the center of the
world wine trade.</p>
<p>These bottles had survived the Revolution, World War II
and Stalin. Their sale was only a small gamble for brave
veterans of Massandra, but they must be pleasantly surprised
at the size of their winnings. It appears that for one very
atypical sector of the Soviet economy, the free market may
have arrived.</p>
