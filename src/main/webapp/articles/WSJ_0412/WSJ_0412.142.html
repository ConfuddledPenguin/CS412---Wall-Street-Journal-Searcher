	<div class="article-body"><p>RICHARD J. RIORDAN is a 59-year-old lawyer, investment
banker, restaurateur, real estate man and venture capitalist
with a passion for education. He wants every child to be
reading and writing in the first grade. "If children cannot
do that," he says, "we have lost them for life."</p>
<p>His efforts have been applied to more than 500 schools and
50,000 five- and six-year-olds and he is now helping to put
the system into every elementary school in Mississippi, a
state laboring under an appalling illiteracy rate.</p>
<p>Mr. Riordan's crusade was sparked by a 1983 Carnegie
Foundation report arguing that language was the key to all
learning and that children should master it by the fourth
grade at the latest. After exploring what schools were doing,
Mr. Riordan concluded that computers could help achieve that
goal.</p>
<p>At first, the Riordan Foundation, the vehicle used for the
Los Angeles lawyer's philanthropies, concentrated on
parochial schools in that city. Mr. Riordan is education
chairman for the archdiocese of Los Angeles and thanks to his
fund-raising efforts, 103 of its 200 parochial schools now
have a computerized learning system in which children and
personal computers "talk" to each other, letting children
write the words they can say and read the words they can
write.</p>
<p>Public schools have been added to the program and it has
now spread to New York, Trenton, N.J., Orange County, Calif.,
and Kansas City, Mo. Mr. Riordan's role has been to combine
his own funds with those of local sources to finance the
programs.</p>
<p>Mississippi's statewide program is Mr. Riordan's most
ambitious by far. This phase began after the state's
41-year-old governor, Raymond Mabus, met Mr. Riordan while on
an industry-promotion tour in California and invited him to
the Executive Mansion for lunch. The governor has big plans
for education in Mississippi and the
computer-in-the-classroom approach, dubbed Writing-to-Read,
is part of them.</p>
<p>Mr. Riordan's approach is to act as a catalyst, putting up
his own money but raising the ante by enlisting the aid of
others with similar views. For the Mississippi program, he
put up $1 million. He then called on Robert Dowling, a New
York entrepreneur who has been a close friend since
grade-school days in New Rochelle, N.Y. Mr. Dowling responded
with a $500,000 gift of his own. Mr. Riordan also pledged to
raise $5.5 million more over four years.</p>
<p>The privately raised money went to International Business
Machines Corp., which installed 72 Writing-to-Read labs in 60
schools during the summer of 1989, a job that entailed not
only computers but new electrical outlets, desks, security
devices, lettered tiles for word-making, and a host of other
items. By the time the 1989 fall terms began, the
Writing-to-Read program was a fact. The goal is to have it
working in all 532 Mississippi grade schools by 1993.</p>
<p>Mr. Riordan's lunch with Gov. Mabus and the program it
produced did not go unnoticed. The lawyer has had calls from
the governors of Louisiana, Indiana and West Virginia asking
for help in developing their own computer programs. The
Riordan Foundation has also held meetings with business
groups from Arkansas and Chicago.</p>
<p>For Richard Riordan and his partners, the interest of the
business groups is especially gratifying. "Illiteracy is not
only evil and sinful," Mr. Riordan says, "it is extremely bad
business."</p>
