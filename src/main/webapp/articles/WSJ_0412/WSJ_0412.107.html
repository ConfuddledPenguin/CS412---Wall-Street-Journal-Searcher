	<p class="article-leader">LOS ANGELES -- Teledyne Inc. posted a 17% drop in
first-quarter net income to $58.3 million, or $1.05 a share,
from $70.5 million, or $1.26 a share, a year ago.
   Per-share amounts reflected a 5-for-1 common stock split
distributed March 1. Sales fell 3.2% to $836.9 million from
$864.3 million a year earlier. The manufacturing and
insurance concern said sales dropped in all segments except
its aviation and electronics businesses.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The company also for the first time broke out results for
its insurance and finance operations that are being spun off
into a new company called Unitrin Inc. Total revenue of the
Unitrin companies increased to $298.6 million from $272.1
million a year ago. Profit from those businesses, classified
as discontinued operations, fell to $25.6 million, or 46
cents a share, from $35.3 million, or 63 cents a share, a
year earlier. Per-share amounts were calculated using 55.4
million average Unitrin shares. Teledyne said it expects to
mail the Unitrin stock certificates to its shareholders this
month.</p>
<p>Teledyne said the casualty insurance companies experienced
a drop in underwriting results in the latest quarter,
primarily because of "adverse experience from storms and in
personal lines."</p>
<p>Profit from continuing operations fell to $32.7 million,
or 59 cents a share, from $35.2 million, or 63 cents a share,
a year ago. Included in the results for the latest quarter
was a reversal of a $7.7 million provision for income taxes
recorded in prior years on undistributed earnings of the
insurance and finance subsidiaries.</p>
<p>Earnings were released after the close of stock market
trading yesterday. In composite trading on the New York Stock
Exchange, Teledyne shares closed at $71.125, off 25 cents.</p>
