	<p class="article-leader">TOKYO -- Fuji Heavy Industries Inc.'s decision to name a
former Nissan Motor executive as president ends a
behind-the-scenes struggle for control of ailing Fuji between
Nissan and Industrial Bank of Japan.
   Fuji's current president, Toshijiro Tajima, announced that
he would hand over the reins to Isamu Kawai, a 68-year-old
former senior executive of Nissan and the president of Nissan
Diesel Motor Co., a Nissan affiliate. The appointment is
expected to be approved by shareholders at the annual meeting
in June. Mr. Tajima will remain chairman.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Nissan, Japan's second-largest car maker, Industrial Bank,
Fuji's main banker, and Fuji, best known for its Subaru
autos, are part of the IBJ-led industrial group. Power
struggles between companies in the same industrial group for
control of another member of the group are unusual in
harmony-driven Japan. But the instincts of both Nissan and
IBJ to support a fellow group member in trouble aren't
unusual. Being able to count on group members for financial
or technical assistance in times of need is among the rewards
of group intrarelationships.</p>
<p>But Fuji officials conceded that the company's fate will
be tied to Nissan. "The world is changing. Technology is
moving forward. We have to move closer to Nissan," said
Tetsuo Miyaji, executive vice president at Fuji. "We decided
it would be better to deepen the relationship."</p>
<p>Industry analysts predicted that once Mr. Kawai is
installed, Nissan will move quickly to forge closer
cooperation between the two companies -- in everything from
the initial design to production to sales and marketing.
"This is a sign that Nissan is going to take an active hand
in Fuji Heavy," said Neil Doying, an auto analyst at Baring
Securities (Japan) Ltd.</p>
<p>That's likely to mean a diminished role for IBJ, a bank
that has historically played a leading role in promoting the
development of key Japanese industries and coming up with
restructuring plans when companies in old-line industries,
such as shipping and steel, ran into trouble. Given its
longstanding ties to Fuji, observers had expected IBJ to do
the same with the car maker.</p>
<p>Currently, Nissan is Fuji's largest shareholder, with a
5.9% stake; IBJ is next, with 4.9%. While no one expects
Nissan to launch a full-scale takeover right away, analysts
didn't rule out the possibility of a merger sometime. They
said some consolidation in the Japanese auto industry may be
inevitable in the 1990s, as some of Japan's small car makers
realize they don't have deep enough pockets or the expertise
to think and act globally.</p>
<p>Fuji recently revised its estimated operating loss for the
year ended March 31 to 23 billion yen (about $145.6 million),
worse than previously figured. Net income is also likely to
be worse than estimated, down 16% to six billion yen. Final
fiscal-year figures won't be released until May. "They just
aren't selling enough cars to cover their costs," said Peter
Boardman, an analyst at Credit Lyonnais Securities (Japan).</p>
<p>In Japan, Fuji is a weak player in the intensely
competitive domestic market. The elimination of steep taxes
on new cars last April has hit subcompact auto makers hard,
especially Fuji. Demand for cars soared, but consumers
shunned small cars and snapped up large luxury models.</p>
<p>Fuji's best hope is the Legacy, its newest
four-wheel-drive model, which has sold relatively well so far
in Japan. But such reliance on the Legacy leaves Fuji
extremely vulnerable, analysts said.</p>
<p>Things don't look much brighter overseas. The Legacy
hasn't sold as well in the crucial U.S. market as Fuji had
hoped. Monthly unit sales dropped from around 13,000 in June
1989 to 6,570 in January 1990. Sales have climbed back
slightly so far this year, but not enough to get Fuji out of
the woods.</p>
<p>Despite Fuji's troubles, analysts said there are benefits
for Nissan in the new arrangement. For example, without any
substantial capital investment, Nissan may be able to use
Fuji's plants. That would help ease Nissan's current
production-capacity constraints. And both companies have
growing aerospace divisions that could benefit from closer
cooperation and technology exchanges, analysts said.</p>
<p>Even with Nissan's help and IBJ's continued financial
backing, no one expects Fuji's troubles to be reversed
overnight. Still, if anyone can make the new Fuji-Nissan
relationship work, it's probably Mr. Kawai. He spent 39 years
climbing the ladder at Nissan before becoming president of
Nissan Diesel in 1985. Industry experts give him high marks
for pulling Nissan Diesel out of a slump and expanding its
share of the Japanese truck market.</p>
