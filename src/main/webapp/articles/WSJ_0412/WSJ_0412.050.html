	<p class="article-leader">In your March 9 page-one article "Raider Referendum," you
characterize USX Corp. stockholders who support Carl Ichan's
efforts to split USX into separate companies as "quick-buck"
investors. A review of the facts demonstrates that USX stock
sells for about the same price today that it did nine years
ago. To add insult to injury, earnings are 73% lower, book
value is 72% lower, the dividend is 30% lower and long-term
debt is twice as high. Just how long should stockholders wait
before expecting reasonable returns on their investments?
