	<p class="article-leader">Few living writers in the West are as knowledgeable about
the history of the Soviet Union as Robert Conquest, and few
bring to the subject a literary sensibility that is a match
for his. This British-born historian poet, now a senior
research fellow at Stanford University's Hoover Institution
and curator of its East European Collection, has written --
among much else -- three key works about the horrors of the
Stalin era. They are: "The Great Terror," a definitive
account of the purges of the 1930s; "Kolyma: The Arctic Death
Camps," a study of what were undoubtedly the most beastly
outposts of the Soviet gulag; and "The Harvest of Sorrow,"
which traces in unremitting detail the course of the
terror-famine that Stalin's collectivization campaign imposed
on the peasants of the Ukraine in the years 1929-33.
   While producing these histories and a good many other
works -- six volumes of poetry and a science-fiction novel
that he wrote with his friend Kingsley Amis -- Mr. Conquest
also has kept a sharp eye on the heroic efforts of the
dissident writers in the Soviet Union in the pre-glasnost era
to tell the truth about their country. Now he has published a
chronicle of his commentaries on these writers under the
title, "Tyrants and Typewriters: Communiques From the
Struggle for Truth" (Lexington Books, 208 pages, $19.95). The
book is not only an expert guide to the most distinguished of
the dissident writers -- Pasternak, Solzhenitsyn, Sakharov,
et al. -- but a persuasive account of the crucial role that
this dissident literature played in bringing about the
momentous changes that lately have occurred in Soviet
politics.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>About that role Mr. Conquest has long exhibited a
comprehension that, in retrospect, now looks like something
closer to prophetic vision. In 1972, for example, while so
many others were wallowing in the illusions of "detente" --
remember "detente"? -- Mr. Conquest wrote: "The dissident
movement is weak, and is faced with a political machine of
immense strength. But it constitutes a growing point for the
eventual peaceful, democratic Russia we must all hope for."</p>
<p>Even earlier, in 1968, Mr. Conquest wrote about Andrei
Sakharov: "He shows that the system is morally and
intellectually bankrupt. It remains to be seen whether the
great revulsion of the Russian educated classes, who are
still almost powerless, will be able to translate itself into
political action." Again and again, Mr. Conquest was quick to
identify the political role of the dissident intelligentsia
in denuding the Soviet regime of the last vestiges of its
claim to legitimacy.</p>
<p>Thus, writing about Alexander Solzhenitsyn's "Gulag
Archipelago" in 1974, he focused on the analysis that
horrified some American liberals at the time but that is
today the conventional wisdom in Moscow as well as New York.
"Solzhenitsyn," Mr. Conquest wrote, "does not put the blame
solely on Stalin and the `personality cult.' He traces the
long evolution of terror, showing that the labor camp system,
the frame-up trials, the mass shootings, the secret
disappearances -- all go back to early Soviet times. . . .
That is to say, a major aspect of Solzhenitsyn's book is that
it breaks totally with the myth that has corrupted and
deluded so many commentators on the Russian Revolution and
the Soviet system: the myth of the liberal Lenin."</p>
<p>This may sound commonplace today, but some of us can
remember the howls of protest that Solzhenitsyn's critique
met with at the time. And we remember, too, with shame, the
refusal of a Republican president -- Gerald Ford -- to meet
with Solzhenitsyn at the White House, or anywhere else, for
fear of endangering the bogus policy of "detente."</p>
<p>Even today, of course, long after Solzhenitsyn has been
proved right on so many aspects of the Soviet debacle, his
work continues to be shunned by American writers. Has any
member of the American literary establishment -- Norman
Mailer, say, or Susan Sontag or E.L. Doctorow -- ever come
forward to acknowledge Solzhenitsyn's towering achievement?
Certainly not. Solzhenitsyn does not belong to the literary
left, and therefore is not to be accorded the kind of honor
they used to routinely hand out to apologists for the Gulag
such as Jean-Paul Sartre and Simone de Beauvoir.</p>
<p>This, too, is part of the story that Mr. Conquest has
undertaken to tell. He naturally reserves his deepest
contempt for those Western writers who were, as he says,
"determined to be duped" about the realities of the Soviet
regime. But his chronicle of the West's intellectual response
to the Stalinist terror is by no means entirely a tale of
surrender to political illusion. There are excellent accounts
of Arthur Koestler's "Darkness at Noon" -- "one of a handful
of books which has powerfully affected the political,
intellectual and moral climate of our times," and of George
Orwell's "1984." He is particularly scathing about Walter
Cronkite's cockeyed introduction to the Signet edition of
"1984," which attempts -- against all the evidence -- to turn
the book into an attack on life in the capitalist West.</p>
<p>In fact, it was Orwell who wrote in 1946: "It is too early
to say just in what way the Russian regime will destroy
itself. . . . But at any rate the Russian regime will either
democratize itself, or it will perish. The huge, invincible,
everlasting slave empire . . . will not be established, or,
if established, will not endure."</p>
<p>In "Tyrants and Typewriters" Mr. Conquest has given us a
fine account of the writers who helped to bring down that
empire.</p>
