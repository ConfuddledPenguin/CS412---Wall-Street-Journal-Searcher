	<p class="article-leader">Yields on money-market mutual funds edged up in the latest
week, remaining in the narrow range of the past three months.
   The average seven-day compound yield rose to 7.99% from
7.97%, according to IBC/Donoghue's Money Fund Report, a
Holliston, Mass.-based newsletter. The yield has hovered near
8% since early this year. (Compound yields assume
reinvestment of dividends.)</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Assets of the 427 taxable funds tracked by Donoghue's
slipped by $44.7 million to $383.6 billion.</p>
<p>Average maturity of the funds' investments, such things as
Treasury bills, bank certificates of deposit and commercial
paper (short-term corporate IOUs), remained at 45 days for
the third consecutive week.</p>
<p>Maturities are considered a sign of which way portfolio
managers think interest rates are headed, with longer
maturities thought to signal declining rates and shorter
maturities considered a sign of rising rates. Average
maturities have been as short as 29 days and as long as 53
days in recent years.</p>
<p>"The {interest} rate outlook has stayed very flat," said
Brenda Malizia Negus, editor of Donoghue's. "Federal Reserve
policy doesn't seem to be changing in either direction."
Yields on CDs and T-bills also were little changed in the
latest week.</p>
<p>The average seven-day simple yield of the taxable funds
rose to 7.69% from 7.67% in the week ended Tuesday, while the
average 30-day simple yield moved to 7.68% from 7.67%. The
average 30-day compound yield went to 7.98% from 7.97%.</p>
<p>Yields on tax-exempt money funds remained flat. The
average seven-day compound yield was unchanged at 5.57%.
That's equal to a taxable yield of 7.74% for investors in the
28% federal income tax bracket, and 8.31% for those in the
33% bracket.</p>
<p>Assets of the 220 tax-free funds tracked by Donoghue's
rose by $1.5 billion, to $78.8 billion. Ms. Negus attributed
the rise to tax concerns as the April 16 filing deadline
approaches.</p>
<p>Average maturity of the tax-exempt funds remained at 46
days.</p>
