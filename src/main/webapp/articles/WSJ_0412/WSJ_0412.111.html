	<p class="article-leader">Nutri/System Inc., a marketer of weight loss programs, is
having trouble getting network approval for new TV
commercials designed to bolster its badly damaged image.
   The proposed ads, which strongly assert the safety of the
Nutri/System program, were prepared after the company was hit
last month with several lawsuits from women alleging the
Nutri/System program caused severe gallbladder problems.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Nutri/System declined to comment on the new ads. But
network executives say they are concerned that some health
and safety claims in the proposed ads may be unsubstantiated.</p>
<p>Some of the controversial spots include assurances that
Nutri/System's primary concern is its customers' health.
Others assert that independent doctors recommend the program
or that weight lost under the diet plan is gone for good.
Network executives also said they are concerned that the ads
don't clearly advise potential customers to consult a
physician before joining up.</p>
<p>So far, none of the major networks has agreed to run the
new spots. Capital Cities/ABC Inc. and CBS Inc. have asked
Nutri/System to back up its claims. NBC, a General Electric
Co. unit, is also awaiting further information before making
a final decision. "We've seen new scripts, and some we've
seen have problems," says Rick Gitter, an NBC advertising
executive.</p>
<p>Executives at all three networks said they are continuing
to negotiate with the diet center chain, and haven't made a
final decision to reject the ads. Executives also pointed out
they have stringent guidelines for claims made by all weight
loss programs. "We have a responsibility to work closely with
them to come up with mutually acceptable advertisements,"
said Matthew Margo, vice president of program practices at
CBS.</p>
<p>Nutri/System's weight loss centers spent $31.1 million on
print and TV advertising last year, according to Leading
National Advertisers Inc. Eric Mower & Assoc., a Syracuse
agency, coordinates media buying for Nutri/System, which is
in the process of selecting a new agency for creative work.
It couldn't be learned who created the proposed television
spots.</p>
<p>Most Nutri/System ads fall into the familiar
"before-and-after" genre, where satisfied customers display
their newly trim figures and share tales of shedding pounds.
But given the scope of the marketing challenges Nutri/System
now faces, its traditional "We succeed where diets fail you"
pitch may no longer be enough to tempt new customers. Because
of the nature of its business, Nutri/System may be especially
prone to charges that its plan is unhealthy. Many consumers
who respond to the Nutri/System pitch are severely overweight
and hence especially vulnerable to a variety of ailments,
including gallbladder disease.</p>
<p>The lawsuits filed last month in Dade County (Fla.)
Circuit Court allege that although Nutri/System touts its
program as "professionally supervised," and "nutritionally
sound," it doesn't employ qualified physicians and nurses to
supervise clients. Lawyers for the plaintiffs claim that as a
result of participating in the Nutri/System program, 17 women
had their gallbladders removed, although previously they had
never been diagnosed as having gallbladder problems.</p>
<p>Nutri/System has said the suits are "without merit."</p>
<p>Since the original suits were filed, more than 700 people
claiming to have experienced health problems after following
the Nutri/System plan have contacted the law offices of the
Miami attorneys handling the cases. Although the law firm is
still in the process of reviewing the new complaints, "we
anticipate filing additional claims," said Herman J.
Russomanno, one of the attorneys involved.</p>
<p>The current controversy comes less than one month after a
congressional committee began investigating the entire $5
billion commercial diet market and its practices. During
hearings held on March 26, Federal Trade Commission Chairman
Janet Steiger told the subcommittee that her agency is
stepping up its scrutiny of advertising claims made by major
diet clinics and other weight-loss programs.</p>
<p>In her testimony, Ms. Steiger also said the FTC is
currently involved in several non-public investigations into
the advertising claims made by several clinics, salons and
marketers of diet products. The government agency would not
release names of the companies under investigation.</p>

<p>Ad Notes. . . .</p>
<p>MOOSEHEAD: Guinness Import Co., Stamford, Conn., pulled
its Moosehead and Moosehead Light beer brands from
McCann-Erickson and said it plans to reassign the brands
soon. Guinness acquired the brands with its acquisition of
All Brands Importers earlier this year. The brands have been
relatively inactive. Separately, Guinness said it named
Carroll Raj Stagliano to handle its Kaliber imported
non-alcoholic beer account. Guinness Import is a unit of
Guinness PLC.</p>
<p>MERGER: Levy, King & White, a Buffalo, N.Y., agency with
about $25 million in billings, said it reached an agreement
in principle to form a new company with Eric Mower &
Associates, a $50 million shop in Syracuse, N.Y. The new
company will be called LKW/Eric Mower & Associates Inc.
Clients of the merged shop include Welch Foods, Aloca and
Syracuse China.</p>
<p>NEW ACCOUNT: Angostura International Ltd. named
Campbell-Mithun-Esty, New York, a unit of Saatchi & Saatchi,
to handle a number of brands including Aromatic Bitters.
Billings weren't disclosed, but are believed to be small.</p>
