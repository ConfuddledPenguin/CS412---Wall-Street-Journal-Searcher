	<p class="article-leader">Where can you get something for nothing in New York? With
April 15 around the corner, the answer seems to be lying in
the streets.
   Since the Tax Reform Act of 1986, donating personal
property to charity doesn't seem to pay anymore. With that in
mind, more upper-crust residents are forgoing deductions and
simply putting their discards out on the street.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"If you donate a $500 table, for example, you have to
indicate when you bought it, how much you paid, and the fair
market value," says Stanley Person, senior partner in Person
& Co., an accounting firm. All that hassle "puts people off."
Moreover, Stephen Seltzer, another CPA, says today the
effective rate for tax savings on personal property
deductions for a New York City resident is only 37%, compared
with 60% before 1986. In other words, the incentive is gone.</p>
<p>To the delight of tasteful scavengers. Ruth Manning,
president of a personnel company and a hunter of terrific
trash in her fashionable Upper East Side neighborhood,
observes that "New Yorkers are more capricious about the way
they dispose of goods; they're not as concerned with giving
to charity anymore because it's not as much to their
benefit." Ms. Manning says she has amassed chairs, tables,
lamps and an antique bird cage, thanks to her "good eye" and
her habit of early-morning jogging.</p>
<p>Sometimes the best stuff doesn't even make it to the curb.
A Park Avenue resident, an art dealer who declines to be
named, describes the "private enterprise" of a small cartel
of building superintendents. "When someone dies in these posh
buildings," he says, "the heirs want to get rid of things
fast" without cumbersome paper work required for donations.
The supers take it off their hands -- and promptly sell it to
neighbors in the know.</p>
<p>Jonathan Roskes, an international bank examiner with the
Federal Reserve Bank of New York, praises the pickings in his
Upper West Side neighborhood, partly because he puts out his
own things. After all, he reasons, it's easier placing them
on the street "than selling them, packing and labeling them,
or arranging garage sales."</p>
<p>He cautions that some finds are better left behind. The
Columbia graduate claims classmates of his got more than they
bargained for with a found rug. "They lugged the carpet back
to our dorm, unrolled it, and discovered a dead body inside."</p>
