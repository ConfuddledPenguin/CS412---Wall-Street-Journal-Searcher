	<p class="article-leader">HOUSTON -- Shell Oil Co. began selling an environmentally
cleaner gasoline at 2,000 stations in the "dirtiest" U.S.
cities. But motorists may have to pony up more green to make
their cars run clean.
   The effort by Shell is the broadest attempt by any oil
company to sell so-called reformulated gasoline designed to
reduce air pollution.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The introduction of the new fuel at this moment by the
nation's biggest marketer of gasoline also comes just as
Congress is hammering out new clean-air legislation that
could force unwelcome changes on the oil industry.</p>
<p>Shell is selling its new gasoline in the nine metropolitan
areas often cited as having the most severe air-quality
problems. Moreover, the company is supplying its stations in
Washington, D.C., which isn't near the top of the dirty-air
list. Asked about the decision to add the nation's capital to
its roster, Shell said Washington is part of the same "air
shed" as Baltimore, which is high on the list.</p>
<p>Some other oil companies applauded Shell's effort, but
downplayed the significance, in part because the industry has
had the ability to produce such gasoline for a while. "It's
not particularly revolutionary," said Allen Kozinski, vice
president of research and development of Amoco Corp.'s
gasoline operations. "It's no technical breakthrough," he
added. Like many oil companies, Amoco has been testing new
auto fuels.</p>
<p>But so far, other companies selling reformulated gasoline
similar to Shell's are doing so only in select cities or only
for old-model cars. Almost any car can use Shell's
formulation.</p>
<p>That's because it will replace Shell's current super
unleaded product in the markets involved, its highest-octane
and most-expensive grade of gasoline. Not surprisingly, super
unleaded fuels also carry the fattest profit margins in the
industry.</p>
<p>Shell officials said it costs the company an extra two
cents a gallon to make the new product, called SU 2000E, but
they wouldn't say whether they will pass that cost on to
motorists. "It will be priced competitively in the
marketplace," according to Frank Richardson, chief executive
officer of Shell, a unit of Royal Dutch/Shell Group.</p>
<p>Motorists who already buy top-of-the-line gasoline,
generally with octane levels above 90, may only feel a price
impact if market conditions allow Shell to pass along its
added costs, or if enthusiasm runs so high that it can charge
a premium over competitors' high-octane gasoline.</p>
<p>But for motorists who normally buy regular or midgrade
gasoline and are motivated by environmental concern, a switch
to the new formula could pinch the pocketbook. In effect,
Shell is attempting the classic marketing tactic of trying to
induce customers to "buy up."</p>
<p>Super unleaded -- Shell's and everyone else's -- can
easily cost 15 cents to 20 cents a gallon more than regular
unleaded at the pump. On a 15-gallon fill-up, an
environmentally conscious motorist would pay as much as an
extra $3 for the Shell fuel.</p>
<p>Shell officials defended their selection of the high-price
end of the gasoline market for introduction of their cleaner
fuel. By making it a high-octane product, Shell said, the
fuel could be used by owners of the most powerful cars,
economy cars, old cars and new cars. If it were a lower
grade, it wouldn't be suitable for some of these categories.</p>
<p>Also, "it's something we think the customer wants and
demands," said Steven Miller, president of Shell's refining
and marketing operations. He expects a much more enthusiastic
response than Shell received in 1970, when it launched a
cleaner, lead-free gas and the public didn't care. "It was a
technical success but a commercial failure," he said. Later,
lead-free fuels became a requirement for new cars.</p>
<p>This time, he said, Shell views its new product as "only a
first step. The reformulation of gasoline has only just
begun."</p>
<p>In Washington, William Rosenberg, a Bush administration
advocate of alternative fuels, praised Shell's efforts but
noted the gasoline isn't as clean as fuels being proposed for
1995 and beyond in clean-air legislation now moving through
Congress.</p>
<p>Mr. Rosenberg, head of the clean-air office in the
Environmental Protection Agency, added that Shell's decision
to market to disparate cities should dispel logistical
concerns expressed by others in the oil industry about
distributing special fuels.</p>
<p>Currently, other oil companies that are selling
reformulated gasoline have limited themselves. Atlantic
Richfield Co. sells a reformulated gas just on the West Coast
and only for older vehicles. The Marathon Petroleum Co. unit
of USX Corp. markets a new gasoline in all three octane
grades, but only in Detroit. In Denver, the Conoco Inc. unit
of Du Pont Co. sells reformulated gas; Amoco is testing
liquified natural gas for some fleet vehicles; and Phillips
Petroleum Co. is testing propane for others.</p>
<p>Like others who have announced reformulated gasolines,
Shell said its version will reduce hydrocarbon and carbon
monoxide emissions. It said, for example, a car operating in
the summer in Los Angeles, which has the nation's worst
problem, would emit 10% less hydrocarbon vapors and 13% less
carbon monoxide. In New York, where the climate differs, the
reductions would be about 6% in each category.</p>
<p>On the other hand, emissions of nitrogen oxides, an
ingredient in smog, will rise, though less than 2%.
Hydrocarbons are unburned fuel and contribute to ozone and
smog, which in turn can cause respiratory irritation. Carbon
monoxide is partly burned fuel and is poisonous.</p>
<p>Shell uses an additive called methyl tertiary-butyl ether,
or MTBE, in place of butane to cut the gasoline's volatility
while enhancing its octane. The resulting fuel helps reduce
tailpipe emissions without hurting performance, and also cuts
the amount of fuel that evaporates from a vehicle, especially
on sunny days or in warm weather. Many areas of the country
have already required some reductions in volatility in the
summer.</p>
<p>Shell hasn't touched two other controversial components of
gasoline, aromatics and olefins. A joint study by the auto
and oil industries is trying to determine whether reducing
their levels will benefit the environment.</p>
<p>Officials of Shell said the company was considering
expanding production of the new gasoline, but that it can't
right now because of physical constraints. The company said
that while it's able to produce and distribute the new
gasoline with only a "modest" capital investment, any
expansion would be costly.</p>
