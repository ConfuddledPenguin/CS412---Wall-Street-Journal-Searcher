	<p class="article-leader">DETROIT -- Ford Motor Co. is attempting to call a
cease-fire in its fierce truck advertising war with General
Motors Corp.'s Chevrolet division.
   The No. 2 auto maker also is sharply boosting ad spending
for the launch of its Explorer sport utility vehicle in hopes
of attracting affluent young suburbanites who make up the
core of Chrysler Corp.'s Jeep Cherokee buyers. Chrysler,
meanwhile, is considering a plan that would lower prices on
some Cherokee models in response to Explorer and other
competitors.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>At a meeting with reporters here yesterday, Ford unveiled
a new truck ad campaign scheduled to begin Sunday night. It
will highlight Ford's leadership in U.S. truck sales as well
as several technological features of its vehicles. But it
will stop short of directly comparing Ford and Chevy models.</p>
<p>Many ads run by the auto makers over the past two years
have heavily criticized each other's trucks. Ford officials
said the battle quickly became a game of one-upmanship that
left consumers behind.</p>
<p>"We've spent, over the course of the past year, a great
deal of advertising money asking consumers what they think
about (the ad wars), and in all honesty they think it's a
bunch of baloney from our side and Chevrolet's side," said
John B. Vanderzee, advertising manager of Ford's Ford
division. "We're not interested in advertising wars anymore."</p>
<p>The new Ford ads will carry the slogan "Ford Trucks: The
Best Never Rest" and they won't mention any of Ford's truck
sales rivals by name. However, Mr. Vanderzee said Ford
tailored the ad campaign so it can take on competitors such
as Chevrolet if they renew attacks against Ford products.</p>
<p>Ford has widened its lead over Chevrolet during the past
year. Ford was ahead by 63,460 trucks for the first six
months of the 1990 model year, compared with 51,328 a year
earlier.</p>
<p>Mr. Vanderzee said Ford will spend slightly more on the
new campaign, which will include ads for all of Ford's trucks
except Explorer and the Ford Aerostar minivan. Ads for these
two models are currently aimed more toward car than truck
buyers.</p>
<p>Ford began running television ads for Explorer last
weekend. Mr. Vanderzee said the auto maker will spend three
times as much on Explorer this year as it spent last year to
advertise the Bronco II model Explorer replaces.</p>
<p>The Explorer is Ford's first four-door Jeep-like vehicle;
it also comes in a two-door version. Adding the four-door
model should boost sales to about 100,000 Explorers this year
and 220,000 in following years, Ford estimates. That compares
with top Bronco II sales of 124,109 units in 1988.</p>
<p>Most of the new Explorer ads are aimed at families and
women, Mr. Vanderzee said. Ford expects women to make up 50%
of Explorer's owners, compared with 30% for Bronco II.</p>
<p>The stepped up competition from Ford and other auto makers
in the four-door sport utility vehicle market is apparently
forcing Chrysler to consider cutting its profit margin on the
Cherokee to hang on to market share.</p>
<p>Chrysler plans to bring out this fall a "value" version of
the four-door Cherokee that will sell for less than the
$20,200 average most Cherokee buyers currently pay, according
to Jeep dealers and a Jeep spokesman, who confirmed a report
in the trade journal Automotive News. Jeep dealers, who have
pressed Chrysler to come up with more affordable versions of
Cherokee, say they expect the "value" Cherokee will sell for
between $16,000 and $18,000.</p>
<p>The "value" Cherokee would have as standard equipment
certain features, such as automatic transmission and air
conditioning, that are currently sold as options.</p>
<p>A Jeep spokesman said the division expects the "value"
Cherokee to be a "high volume" seller, but wouldn't confirm a
price range for the vehicle. He did say the model won't be
the least expensive in the Cherokee line, which currently
starts at about $13,000.</p>
