	<p class="article-leader">Societe Generale reported in Paris that its consolidated
net profit rose 17% in 1989 and unveiled plans to increase
its net annual dividend to 15 francs (2.7 cents) a share from
13 francs (2.3 cents).
   Marc Vienot, chairman of the private-sector banking group,
told a news conference that the 1989 performance was "more
than acceptable," with consolidated net profit after payments
to minority interests climbing to 3.56 billion francs from
3.04 billion in 1988 despite an inversion of the domestic
interest-rate curve that substantially cut profits from bond
market operations.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Mr. Vienot asserted that the weakness of bond market
operations was offset, however, by an "exceptional" rise in
profits from its asset management activity. He also noted
that Societe Generale's traditional commercial bank
operations continued to grow satisfactorily, with total loans
to customers rising 15% to 475 billion francs while client
deposits climbed 10% to 362 billion.</p>
