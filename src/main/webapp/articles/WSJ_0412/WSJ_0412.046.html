	<p class="article-leader">CLEAN-AIR COMPROMISES are sought in the House for smaller
companies.
   Under the clean-air bill that the Senate passed last week,
getting permits to operate would be a big hurdle for
companies that emit regulated substances. The House Energy
and Commerce Committee adopts an amendment backed by Rep.
Rick Boucher (D., Va.), requiring states to give small firms
extra time to comply with the rules. Rep. Ron Wyden (D.,
Ore.) will propose to temporarily delay steep fines if a
small company accidentally emits a prohibited substance as
it's trying to comply. His measure also is expected to seek
removal of criminal penalties for paper-work violations.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Without such safeguards, permit requirements could become
the small-business controversy of 1990, predicts Theresa
Pugh, the National Association of Manufacturers' director of
environmental policy. The trade group contends that it
probably would cost small firms more to analyze their
chemical emissions when seeking a permit than to clean them
up. It urges that small enterprises be allowed to submit
estimates. Printers and others that produce batches of
different products would face repeated hassles if required to
get a permit for each product.</p>
<p>The amendment for added time to meet permit rules remains
subject to review by the House panel; the Senate rejected a
similar provision.</p>

<p>PRESSURES EASE for small business on child-care and
parental-leave bills.</p>
<p>Small-business interests breathe easier after Congress
passes a child-care bill. Backers of the bill approved by the
House last week expect to reach a compromise with the Senate
version that will be acceptable to President Bush. Early
fears that a child-care law would sharply increase regulation
of small, private day-care providers or otherwise threaten
their businesses didn't materialize. Moreover, passage of the
bill may derail the push for legislation for mandatory
parental leave because Congress is unlikely to pass two
costly, family-oriented initiatives in one session.</p>
<p>Small-business groups contend that a law requiring
employers to grant leaves and other benefits to new parents
would be a hardship for many small employers. Feelings run so
high that mandated parental leave is the closest thing to a
small-business "litmus-test" issue for legislators, says the
National Federation of Independent Business. The bill has
been stalemated on Capitol Hill, with both sides lacking the
votes to adopt or defeat it. Small-business lobbyists are
focusing on Democratic lawmakers, who tend to support the
leave.</p>
<p>"Parental leave is a loser for the Democrats," argues Tom
Cator of National Small Business United. "It represents big
government."</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>THE LION'S DEN? Sen. Jay Rockefeller (D., W.Va.), who
generally won praise from small-business lobbyists as
chairman of the Pepper Commission on health care, may face a
tough grilling from business owners next month. He will
address a joint Washington meeting of National Small Business
United and the National Association of Women Business Owners.
The Washington-based groups concede that, despite Mr.
Rockefeller's cooperation with small business on some health
issues, their members are likely to speak up against such
commission proposals as mandatory health insurance.</p>

<p>A CIVIL RIGHTS BILL proposed in Congress to strengthen the
anti-bias rights of workers would probably increase the
number of lawsuits brought by disgruntled employees, small
businesses fear. "The bill could place a wedge between the
business community and the people they're trying to protect,"
says David Pinkus, whose Dallas landscaping company, North
Haven Gardens, employs 200 people. Businesses also fear the
bill's affirmative-action language would, in effect, force
them to have work forces numerically balanced by race and sex
unless they have business-related reasons for any imbalances.
The bill's backers say the measure wouldn't create quotas or
unfounded lawsuits.</p>

<p>HIGHER FEES, lower funding for some SBA programs are hot
budget issues.</p>
<p>The Bush administration proposes to boost fees on Small
Business Administration guaranteed loans to 5% of the loan
amount from 2%. It also wants to raise to 5% from 1.2% the
fee on small-business investment company loans. And the loan
fees for minority-owned investment firms would jump to 3%
from 1.2%. Some in Congress call the fee increases and other
changes in the fiscal 1991 budget "warmed-over Reaganisms"
because they're similar to those sought by Reaganites who
unsuccessfully tried to kill the SBA in the 1980s.</p>
<p>Under other Bush budget proposals, only business owners
unable to get loans elsewhere would be eligible for SBA
disaster loans. The administration also wants to cut funding
for the college-based Small Business Development Centers to
$30 million from $50 million and to eliminate the program
after fiscal 1992. But Congress has historically protected
the disaster-aid fund and the popular SBDC program, which
gives free management advice to small firms.</p>
<p>As for proposed fee increases, Senate Small Business
Committee Chairman Dale Bumpers (D., Ark.) says flatly: "We
ain't gonna do it."</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>SMALL TALK: The SBA plans by 1993 to increase to 500,000
from 172,000 the number of companies it lists on a
computerized program to help small firms win federal
procurement contracts. . . . Commerce Secretary Mosbacher,
asked to meet with some East German entrepreneurs during a
recent trip there, answered, "Sure, that's no longer an
oxymoron." . . . Humorist Bob Orben says, "I knew small
business had come to Russia when the Baskin-Robbins flavor of
the month was borsch."</p>
