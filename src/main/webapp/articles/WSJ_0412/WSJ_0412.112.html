	<p class="article-leader">Petroleum prices crashed and then rebounded in one of the
wildest trading days ever on world oil markets.
   The volatility and heavy trading left prices in a
shambles, with oil analysts summing up the day's events in a
word: confusion.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Some analysts and traders admitted that after yesterday's
roller-coaster ride, with prices swinging more than $2 a
barrel in West Texas Intermediate crude, they had no idea
whether oil prices now will head higher or continue on their
recent downward trend. The U.S. benchmark crude for May
delivery closed 38 cents higher at $18.06 a barrel.</p>
<p>A bearish view still seems widespread at the moment. But
several analysts and oil economists repeated previous
projections that the oil market should firm again by the end
of the second quarter, traditionally a sluggish demand
period.</p>
<p>Meantime, a typical example of yesterday's pricing melee
came out of the oil fields of Texas. There, several more
refiners reduced their posted prices for West Texas
Intermediate $1 a barrel to $16.50, even as others increased
postings 50 cents to $17.</p>
<p>Oil markets outside Texas were equally divided. By the end
of the trading day in European spot markets, North Sea and
Middle East crudes were down as much as $1.05 a barrel. But
in U.S. futures trading, the price of West Texas Intermediate
for May delivery fell like a rock in early trading. Then it
bounced back in an afternoon rally that had little more
support than the hope that the Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries was going to meet.</p>
<p>Senior officials of some members of OPEC confirmed that
the oil ministers are consulting with each other by phone
over the state of the oil market, said to be deteriorating
because of excess OPEC output.</p>
<p>But they again expressed doubt that there would be any
meeting of all 13 oil ministers before the regular midyear
conference, which is scheduled to begin May 25, probably in
Geneva. They didn't rule out an earlier meeting of the
influential monitoring committee of eight ministers, but
noted even that would be difficult because two religious
periods -- the Moslem Ramadan and the Christian Easter -- are
at hand.</p>
<p>Still, midday news reports on speculation that OPEC might
hold an emergency session before May 25 to deal with the glut
triggered a rebound in prices of oil and fuels on the New
York Mercantile Exchange. May, June and July contracts for
gasoline and heating oil futures closed sharply higher --
some by more than one cent a gallon -- while West Texas
Intermediate for May delivery surged above the
psychologically important $18 mark.</p>
<p>The June crude contract also was up 38 cents a barrel from
the Tuesday close.</p>
<p>Before the rebound, in the opening hour of trading, both
crude contracts had plunged. May West Texas Intermediate fell
$1.48 a barrel, possibly a record decline for such a short
period. Its low for the day was $16.25 a barrel.</p>
<p>"It was the most panicked day of trading I've seen in a
long time," said Vahan Zanoyan, senior director of
Washington-based Petroleum Finance Co. Others likened
yesterday's pricing hysteria to that of the 50% price
collapse in early 1986.</p>
<p>There are similarities with 1986. But there also are major
differences, and most analysts and oil economists are still
looking for a solid price recovery by summer.</p>
<p>"It has been clear there was going to be a serious problem
in the second quarter," said Humphrey Harrison, director of
energy research at the London brokerage firm of Kitcat &
Aitken & Co. "We will see up to a further $1 {a barrel}
drop," he added, "and then there will be a swift and strong
turnaround."</p>
<p>But much depends on OPEC. "There isn't going to be a quick
fix," said Philip L. Dodge, oil analyst with Nomura
Securities International in New York, "but it looks like the
classic pattern of the past several years. Some members of
OPEC overproduce as long as they can -- and then get religion
temporarily."</p>
<p>Indications of OPEC's high production of some 24 million
barrels a day -- two million above the group's ceiling --
came this week in fresh reports of expanding crude-oil
inventories in both Europe and the U.S.</p>
<p>Many traders attributed yesterday's early-morning price
collapse, in fact, to a late Tuesday report by the American
Petroleum Institute that U.S. crude oil inventories had
increased more than eight million barrels last week.
Significantly, that put U.S. crude stocks 45 million barrels
above the year-earlier level.</p>
<p>Even after yesterday's rebound, the near-month futures
price of West Texas Intermediate is some $5 a barrel under
this year's peak, reached in January. If oil prices remain at
this level or go lower, economists estimated there would be a
positive impact on inflation rates.</p>
<p>As a rule of thumb, each $1-a-barrel drop in the price of
oil should trim one-tenth of one percent off the U.S.
inflation rate the first year, with some additional impact in
later years, said Joyce Yanchar, DRI/McGraw-Hill senior
economist.</p>
<p>In other commodity markets yesterday:</p>
<p>COFFEE: May contracts fell 2.6 cents a pound to finish the
session at 95.17 cents. Analysts said Tuesday's price action
was psychologically bearish and set the market up for
yesterday's sell-off. In the Tuesday session, the market
failed to penetrate the $1-a-pound level and then retreated
to close nearly two cents a pound under the session's high.
The $1 level is considered an important technical-resistance
level. Celeste Georgakis, a commodity specialist at Cargill
Investors Services, New York, said Brazil would begin on
Monday to accept registrations for the export of coffee for
the next 12 months. She said, "Brazil is making a concerted
effort to reduce the role of government in the country's
economy." She pointed out that in furthering that goal, the
Brazilian Congress has approved the elimination of 22
government agencies concerned with the country's products;
that could have long-term bearish implications for Brazil's
exports, traders said. Yesterday's session reflected a
follow-through of Tuesday's weak close, according to Ms.
Georgakis. "The market was definitely overbought prior to
this recent decline and was due for a setback," she said.
Bernard Savaiko, senior commodity analyst at PaineWebber, New
York, said that when the market couldn't break the $1 level,
it began to encounter stop-loss orders, which quickly
exacerbated the sell-off. However, Mr. Savaiko said the
market wasn't far from a support area.</p>
<p>ORANGE JUICE: The May futures contract rose 2.55 cents to
settle at $1.9830 a pound in response to a Department of
Agriculture report. The report, released after Tuesday's
close, estimated the Florida crop to be 103.1 million boxes
based on data for April 1. The previous month's estimate was
for 103 million boxes. Traders were looking for an increase
of four million to five million boxes from the March
estimate. The report also reduced the current yield estimate
from 1.24 gallons a box to 1.21 gallons. Celeste Georgakis of
Cargill Investors Services, New York, said the smaller
estimate sparked a strong opening at $1.9850 a pound, with
follow-through buying sending the May contract to $2 before
profit-taking set in. "Speculative interests have been
shorting this market for sometime looking for a collapse.
With Tuesday's recent report they had no choice but to cover
their short positions," she said. She noted that tightness in
quality juice is continuing, and she sees no signs of an
imminent price collapse. She predicts a trading range in the
May and July contracts, during the next two months, from
$1.90 to $2.05. She added that she expects U.S. supplies will
continue to be supplemented by juice from Brazil. The harvest
on this year's Brazil crop won't begin until May.</p>
<p>LIVESTOCK and MEATS: Prices for pork-belly futures
contracts moved up the limit, as the market rallied to
encourage the industry to start putting more bellies away.
Analysts say the market was spurred by the fact that the
number of pork bellies going into cold storage in warehouses
outside of Chicago was less than expected. Last week, these
warehouses stored 934,000 pounds of pork bellies, while
traders were expecting between 1.5 million and 2.5 million
pounds. The previous week the warehouses had stored over
three million pounds. Hog-futures prices rose as a declining
slaughter "kept hog supplies relatively tight in the last
four to six weeks," says Tom Morgan, an analyst with Sterling
Research Corp. in Chicago. He notes that the slaughter, which
is normally higher in March and April, has declined
"contraseasonally," while there have been improvements in
demand for pork, particularly exports. Cattle futures traders
are speculating that the rise in the nearby cattle price
reflects a tight supply of animals ready for the market and a
strong cash price for cattle. "This furnished the futures
market with support to advance to the highest price level
ever paid for a live cattle future contract," says Charles
Levitt, an analyst at Shearson Lehman Hutton, Chicago. The
cattle contract for April delivery touched a new
life-of-contract high of 80.40 cents a pound before settling
at the end of the trading session at 80.37 cents a pound.</p>
<p>COPPER: The May contract ended 1.25 cents a pound lower at
$1.1810 in light trading, after reaching a high of $1.2020.
The market was driven lower initially by rumors that London
Metals Exchange stocks would be sharply higher when figures
are released on Tuesday. The London exchange will be closed
tomorrow and Monday, the usual day for release of copper
stocks. However, when no confirmation was forthcoming for
those rumors, the market rallied off of its lows. Betty
Raptopoulos, senior metals analyst at Prudential-Bache
Securities, New York, said the market is trading on low
volume, which makes it unusually volatile. "Both sides of the
market are reluctant to hold positions overnight. Traders
with even small profits take them quickly," she said.</p>
