	<p class="article-leader">Technology stocks led a slight gain in the
over-the-counter market as investors selectively dipped their
toes into quiet, pre-holiday trading.
   "The tech stocks are still hanging in there" after
Tuesday's strength, said Bob McCready, an institutional
trader with St. Louis-based A.G. Edwards & Sons.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The Nasdaq Composite Index closed up 1.63 at 433.53 for a
0.37% gain. Thus, it outstripped the Dow Jones Industrial
Average, which slipped 1.35 to close at 2729.73, and the
American Stock Exchange's market value index, down 1.98 to
close at 357.54. Advancing OTC stocks beat decliners, 956 to
906, as volume rose to 133,820,400 shares from 129,504,900.</p>
<p>Leading the technology stocks, Apple Computer added 1 1/4
to 42 1/2. Apple's chairman and chief executive officer John
Sculley gave a keynote address yesterday at a trade show in
San Francisco that focused on the company's Macintosh
personal computer hardware and software products. The company
is expected to report third-quarter earnings next week.</p>
<p>Microsoft, which yesterday introduced a software product
to help programmers boost productivity, rose 3 to 121. Intel,
which is expected to report first-quarter results today,
gained 1/4 to close at 42 3/4.</p>
<p>Investors tended to pick their shares carefully, said
William R. Rothe, managing director for OTC trading for Alex.
Brown & Sons in Baltimore. Most investors flush with cash are
content to "just sit back and rifle shoot and take
opportunities when they see them," investing in bargains and
selling on bad news, Mr. Rothe said.</p>
<p>Jerry Mullins, head of OTC trading at Dean Witter
Reynolds, saw retail buying outpace institutional buying at
that brokerage as investors favored the buy side. But by the
end of the day, E.E. "Buzzy" Geduld, president of Herzog
Heine Geduld Inc., said he saw institutional buying "leaning
toward the sell side."</p>
<p>Mr. McCready of A.G. Edwards predicts today's market will
drift until the last hour of trading, when he suggests the
market may bounce up as traders who sold shares short rush to
cover their positions in advance of the three-day Easter
weekend. Short sellers borrow shares and sell them, betting
on a decline that will allow them to return the borrowed
shares later at a profit.</p>
<p>MCI Communications closed off 3/8 at 36 1/8 after it was
reported that chairman and chief executive William McGowan
underwent exploratory chest surgery.</p>
<p>Disappointing earnings pressured shares of Vivigen Inc.,
off 2 at 19, and Home Savings & Loan, which fell 1 to close
at 15 1/2.</p>
<p>Vivigen, a genetic testing laboratory based in Santa Fe,
N.M., reported first quarter net income of 11 cents a share
versus 15 cents in the year-ago quarter.</p>
<p>Comshare fell 2 1/4 to 36 1/4. The company said a lowered
earnings forecast by a Chicago Corp. analyst was largely
responsible for the drop. The analyst slashed a fiscal
third-quarter earnings estimate for the company to about 40
cents a share from a previous estimate of 60 cents, according
to Dow Jones Professional Investor Report.</p>
<p>Amid positive earnings stories, Caere added 2 to 24 1/4
after reporting first-quarter net income of 25 cents a share,
up from 10 cents a year earlier.</p>
<p>Among bank stocks rising yesterday, University National
Bank gained 4 to 32, Midlantic rose 5/8 to 16 1/2, BayBanks
added 3/4 to close at 16 3/4, Northeast Bancorp added 1/2 to
32 1/2, and Society for Savings gained 5/8 to 12 1/4.</p>
<p>Laserscope slipped 7/8 to 15 3/8. Alex. Brown & Sons said
this activity was related to the partial expiration of a
lock-up agreement between the company and some major
investors that restricted those investors from selling shares
following Laserscope's November 1989 initial public offering.</p>
