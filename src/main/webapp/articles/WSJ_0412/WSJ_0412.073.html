	<p class="article-leader">From a letter to the Times of London by Antony Rouse, on
March 16:</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>That's terrific news you report (March 13) -- the creation
of a subsidiary of Oxford University in Japan -- but it needs
development.</p>
<p>Give them a subsidiary of Eton, a branch of the Guards
Officers' Mess at Wellington Barracks, a replica of White's
Club and the Japanese economy will be on its knees within a
generation.</p>
