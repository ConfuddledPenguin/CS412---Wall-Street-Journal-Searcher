	<p class="article-leader">PARIS -- Source Perrier S.A. officials say the U.S.
relaunch of their bubbly water now is a week or two behind
schedule, because of delays in rebuilding inventory and in
obtaining a U.S. Food and Drug Administration review.
   One month ago they announced that their green bottles
would be back in stores on the East Coast by the first week
of April, and on the West Coast by the third week of April.
Now they say it will be around April 23 before the East Coast
relaunch, and early May for the West Coast. Inland, it could
be as late as the end of May before stores have Perrier
again.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>In Britain, however, Perrier was relaunched on time, on
April 4, accompanied by a new advertising campaign.</p>
<p>Perrier announced a world-wide recall of its mineral water
in February, after trace levels of benzene were found in it
by U.S. scientists. Benzene is a suspected cause of cancer,
although U.S. and French authorities say the amount in
Perrier was too low to present a real health hazard.</p>
<p>Perrier says benzene always has been present in the
natural carbon dioxide gas it uses to increase its water's
carbonization. It says it failed to change filters frequently
enough on the pipes that supply carbon dioxide gas to its
bottling plant in the south of France.</p>
<p>Perrier officials say one purpose of the U.S. delay is to
avoid shortages.</p>
