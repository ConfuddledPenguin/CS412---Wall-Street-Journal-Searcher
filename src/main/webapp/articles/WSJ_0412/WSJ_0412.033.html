E. Nelms resigned as president and chief executive officer of
the severely troubled thrift.
   It said Mr. Nelms also resigned from the board.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>A spokeswoman said Mr. Nelms stepped down for "personal
reasons," but wouldn't elaborate. Mr. Nelms couldn't be
reached to comment.</p>
<p>Valley Federal said Scott A. Braly, chief financial
officer, was named interim president and chief executive.</p>
<p>Valley Federal is among the country's sickest thrifts.
Regulators have ordered it to halt lending and investment
activities, a move that generally is a precursor to
government takeover. It had a loss of $73 million in the nine
months ended Sept. 30 and has announced it will report a $66
million write-down for the fourth quarter, for losses at a
mobile-home subsidiary. Its results for the fourth quarter
and year haven't been released, but it has said it expects to
report tangible capital after the write-down of negative $43
million.</p>
