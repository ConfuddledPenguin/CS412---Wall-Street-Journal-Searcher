	<p class="article-leader">Friday, April 13, 8-9 p.m. EDT, on CBS: "120th Edition of
Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey Circus." The black panther
and the white rhinoceros, Johnny Peers and his clowning dogs,
the spinning whips of Argentina's Los Gauchos Latinos --
they'll all be there, kicking up the traditional sawdust.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Friday, April 13, 10-11 p.m. EDT, on PBS (PBS air dates
and times vary, so check local listings): "The Mormon
Tabernacle Choir: An Easter Gift of Music." Dame Kiri Te
Kanawa is the soloist in this program of inspirational music
ranging from Bach to Wagner to Sir Henry Bishop.</p>
<p>Sunday, April 15, 4-6 p.m. EDT, on ABC: "MacDonald's
All-American High School Basketball Game." Another talent
search for the nation's hottest high school players will
culminate in a game that also is a charitable fund-raiser --
this year's proceeds will go to institutions in the
Indianapolis area.</p>
<p>Monday, April 16, 8-9:45 p.m. EDT, on TNT (repeated April
16, 17, 21 and 22): "The Rose and the Jackal." According to
this fictionalized version of Civil War history, Allan
Pinkerton (the founder of the American Secret Service and the
famous detective agency) fell in love with Rose O'Neal
Greenhow (a beautiful Confederate spy) while prosecuting her.
No one knows whether such a romance actually occurred. But
this wonderfully stirring film, starring Christopher Reeve
and Madolyn Smith Osborne, will make you wish it had.</p>
<p>Monday, April 16, 8-9 p.m. EDT and PDT, on HBO (repeated
April 19, 24, 29, May 2 and 11): "History of the NBA." Ever
since Dr. James Naismith took that first rim shot a century
ago, the game has been getting better -- as evidenced by this
lively film, produced with the cooperation of the NBA.</p>
<p>Monday, April 16, 8-9 p.m. EDT, on PBS: "Profit the
Earth." The return of Earth Day (April 22) doesn't
necessarily mean the return of 1960s-style environmentalism.
This film offers some hope that the problems can be addressed
in ways that move beyond reflexive anti-business attitudes.</p>
<p>Friday, April 20-Sunday, April 22: Earth Day programming.
TDC will present a group of films exposing various problems
and issuing warnings: "Amazonia" (Friday, 9-11 p.m. EDT); the
three-part series "Earth" (each night, 8-9 p.m. EDT); and
"Where Have All the Dolphins Gone?" (Sunday 9-10 p.m. EDT).
ABC takes the concerned-celebrity route with an entertainment
special: "Time Warner Presents the Earth Day Special"
(Sunday, 9-11 p.m. EDT). And A&E offers the 27-part
documentary, "Challenge of the Seas" (beginning Sunday, 8-9
p.m. EDT and continuing on Saturdays, 7:30-8 p.m. EDT).</p>
<p>Friday, April 20, 9-10:30 p.m. EDT, on PBS: "Largo
Desolato." Written (appropriately enough) in 1984, this
gloomy but wry play by Vaclav Havel stars F. Murray Abraham
as a dissident Czech writer about to be interrogated by the
secret police. If it makes you curious about the playwright,
recently elected president of Czechoslovakia, stay tuned for
"Havel's Audience With History" (10:30-11:30 p.m. EDT), a
documentary that tries to capture the essence of two
different productions (one Czech, one American) of Havel's
best-known play, "The Audience," while also tracing his life
and character.</p>
<p>Saturday, April 21, 10-11:30 p.m. EDT, on Showtime
(repeated April 26, May 2, 8 and 13): "Showtime Coast to
Coast: All Star Edition." Most popular-music specials on TV
are too packaged and categorized. The same cannot be said of
this smart, eclectic series, now launching its third season
with a post-Grammys jam session featuring B.B. King, Herbie
Hancock, Bonnie Raitt, Michael Bolton and Rickie Lee Jones,
among others.</p>
<p>Sundays, April 22-May 20, 9-10 p.m. EDT (the first episode
is two hours long), on PBS: "Traffik." We Americans are so
accustomed to thinking about the drug crisis in terms of
cocaine, Central America and the U.S. that it comes as a
shock to see the same tragic scenario being played out in
terms of heroin, Pakistan and Europe. Few anti-drug films are
as starkly riveting as this Channel Four production filmed on
location in northwest Pakistan, Karachi, Hamburg and London.
More in Monday's column.</p>
<p>Sunday, April 22, 10 p.m.-midnight EDT, on HBO (repeated
April 25, 30, May 3, 8 and 11): "The Investigation: Inside a
Terrorist Bombing." More starkly riveting stuff from the
British Isles. Only this time, the subject is the 1974 IRA
bombings that killed 21 people. This docudrama, starring John
Hurt and Martin Shaw, means to stir up controversy about the
guilt of those convicted, the so-called Birmingham Six.</p>
