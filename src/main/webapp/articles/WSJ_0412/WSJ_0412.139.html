	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- The Brooklyn U.S. attorney's office filed
suit, charging Sperry Corp., Unisys Corp. and Honeywell Inc.
with defrauding the government by inflating cost estimates on
defense work.
   In 1986, Sperry and Burroughs Corp. merged to become
Unisys. Later that year, Honeywell bought the Unisys division
cited in the lawsuit, a maker of flight simulators to train
pilots.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Spokesmen for Unisys, a Blue Bell, Pa., computer maker,
and Honeywell, a Minneapolis business-machines company, said
the companies hadn't been served with the suit and couldn't
comment.</p>
<p>The suit, which seeks at least $48 million in damages,
charges that in 1979 and 1980, Sperry underbid on one
flight-trainer contract by $1.5 million to get a leg up on
competitors when two succeeding contracts came up for bids.
Sperry was awarded the next two pacts as well, but in its
cost proposals prepared after the awards, it secretly
inflated its anticipated costs, the complaint charges.</p>
<p>Earlier, a similar suit was filed by a former Sperry
executive, Ralph F. D'Avino, under the federal
"whistleblower" provision of the False Claims Act, according
to the law firm that represents him, Baden Kramer Huffman &
Brodsky here. Last Monday, U.S. Attorney Andrew J. Maloney's
office filed a superseding complaint.</p>
<p>In a Securities and Exchange Commission filing, Honeywell
disclosed "preliminary discussions" with the government about
alleged "false claims and statements" by Sperry and Unisys.
Honeywell said that the government indicated its single
damage claim could total $48 million, but that the complaint
seeks treble damages. Honeywell's filing said the action
"stems from facts and circumstances arising, in significant
part, prior to the company's acquisition of this portion of
its business from Unisys." Thus, Honeywell said it believes
it is covered by contractual indemnification provided by
Unisys.</p>
<p>Separately, Unisys and partner Westinghouse Electric
Corp., Pittsburgh, lost a contract to build part of the
Navy's Aegis radar system.</p>
<p>In late March, Unisys said, the Navy "decided to
discontinue second sourcing," dropping Unisys and
Westinghouse, a defense, electrical-products and broadcasting
concern. The first source is General Electric Co., a
Fairfield, Conn., broadcaster and defense and industrial
products company.</p>
<p>Unisys received the contract in April 1988. The company
said it expects to pare some of the 4,000 employees at its
Shipboard & Ground Systems unit in Great Neck, N.Y., but
isn't sure how many. The first phase of the project was
valued at $10 million for Unisys; the second phase, which was
under way when the Navy dropped the second sources, had a $90
million value to Unisys. A Westinghouse spokesman couldn't be
reached to comment.</p>
