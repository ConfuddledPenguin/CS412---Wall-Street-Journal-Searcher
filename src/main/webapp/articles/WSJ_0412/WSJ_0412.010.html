	<p class="article-leader">The Civil Rights Act of 1990, which would expand the
ability of workers to sue their employers on the basis of
discrimination, deserves more discussion than it is now
receiving. It might be more appropriate to say that civil
rights itself deserves more discussion. Shortly after the
Senate Judiciary Committee voted 12 to 1 recently to confirm
Clarence Thomas's nomination to be a federal appeals judge, a
Journal reader wrote to ask whether Senator Howard
Metzenbaum's lone vote against Mr. Thomas, who is black,
meant that it is Mr. Metzenbaum who is now "outside the
mainstream." The reader raises an important question. Who
indeed represents the civil-rights mainstream now?
   To the extent there has been any public discussion of this
issue, it has centered in the activities of the Judiciary
Committee, most prominently in the Supreme Court nomination
hearings for Robert Bork. This debate, however, began to cut
closer to the bone with the committee's nomination hearings
on a Justice department civil-rights job for William Lucas,
who is a black conservative. The committee voted down his
nomination, arguing that Mr. Lucas lacked competence to be
the department's civil-rights head. Mr. Lucas was raised in
Harlem and had been elected executive of Wayne County,
Michigan. It came out in the hearings that Mr. Lucas didn't
unquestioningly share the committee majority's opinion of
what constituted mainstream civil-rights policy. And we began
editorializing that the committee's Democrats were running a
Liberal Plantation.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>It next became clear that the committee would try to
oppose the judicial nomination of Mr. Thomas, raised in rural
Georgia, a graduate of Yale Law School and Ronald Reagan's
director of the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission.
Achievement-oriented, Mr. Thomas says he dislikes the "racism
of sympathy."</p>
<p>The view we expressed at the time was that the committee's
liberals and their allies were attempting to ostracize from
public life black men and women who didn't share their
"mainstream" views. In the event, the notion that Mr. Thomas
should be kept off the federal bench was too indefensible to
pursue in public view, and he now is rendering decisions for
the Washington, D.C., circuit.</p>
<p>The Thomas nomination was important. It established that
one side of this debate would not be able to use its
political authority and public-relations skills to intimidate
the other side into silence. Not that this is ever likely in
a healthy political democracy. Inevitably, other voices in
the civil-rights debate would emerge.</p>
<p>Clarence Thomas and William Lucas are among those voices.
Others now include the economist Thomas Sowell,
tenant-ownership advocate Robert Woodson, and Kevin
Pritchett, the Virginia-born editor of the Dartmouth Review
in Hanover, N.H. Virginia has just elected a black Democrat
named Douglas Wilder who calls his centrist political
philosophy the "new mainstream." New York City's new mayor,
David Dinkins, conducted an inclusive campaign that won
support across racial lines. Time Warner has just announced a
new magazine, with the telling name Emerge, which will be
targeted at the black middle class. Several prime-time TV
series now feature vibrant and successful middle-class black
characters; indeed one's called "Family Matters."</p>
<p>Some of these new voices flatly oppose affirmative action;
others would place less emphasis on blunt legal coercion to
advance black interests. Bill Lucas supports set-asides.
While one finds great diversity of opinion on the needs of
black America among these people, the so-called mainstream
views of the seven white men seated to the left of Judiciary
Chairman Joseph Biden all tend to flow in only one direction.</p>
<p>The legislation now before Congress has arrogated to
itself the title Civil Rights Act of 1990. To dispute its
provisions or even vote against it is to risk being described
as against . . . against what? An opponent of this bill might
still support the notion that an employer should diversify
its work force with conscious and voluntary affirmative
employment of blacks or Hispanics or women.</p>
<p>But surely one is in no sense opposed to civil rights if
one argues that it is wrong for a bill to create large
financial incentives to win punitive damages by filing
lawsuits and "disparate impact" cases against American
institutions. It is wrong because it puts the Congress of the
United States on record as saying that the nation's people
are by instinct and by nature racist. It says that their
racism is persistent and irredeemable, and that only the
efforts of lawyers and the judgments of courts will establish
an acceptable moral order in the U.S.</p>
<p>This is indeed what some voices in American political life
assert. Do they represent the mainstream? Or is it possible
that the U.S. is more likely to achieve its civil-rights
goals without the polarizing litigiousness of this
legislation? Perhaps it is possible that the mainstream is
much wider than Senators Kennedy and Metzenbaum will allow,
that it now includes businesses, colleges and communities
determined, despite opposition, to draw more Americans into
the mainstream of middle-class achievement.</p>
