	<p class="article-leader">DALLAS -- Greyhound Lines Inc. said it is restoring
service to 286 communities in a move the strike-bound bus
company said would increase its passenger service network by
28%.
   The company has been operating with replacement drivers
and union crossovers since March 2, when 9,400 members of the
Amalgamated Transit Union walked off the job in a contract
dispute over wages and workplace issues.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The unit of GLI Holding Co. said the increase, announced
just before the busy Easter travel weekend, boosts its daily
scheduled service to about 72% of pre-strike levels.</p>
