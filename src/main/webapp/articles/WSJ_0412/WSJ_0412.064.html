	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- In a bull market, it's easy for investors to
grab a bunch of stocks in a strong industry and watch the
returns soar. But in an uncertain market like today's, that
strategy may not work.
   With the economy crawling along in 1990, some money
managers are opting for eclectic portfolios of carefully
selected stocks. With old-fashioned stock picking, the money
managers hope to outperform their sector-betting peers.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"We're in a slower economy; a rolling recession not only
affects industries, but individual companies within
industries," says Ellen Harris, chief domestic investment
officer at Mitchell Hutchins Asset Management Inc., the
adviser to PaineWebber Inc. mutual funds. "You need strong
economic signals to create sector trends -- down or up."</p>
<p>No doubt, industry groups fall and rise even when markets
and the economy are moving sideways. Air freight and
semiconductor stocks, for example were two top performers in
the first quarter, with gains of 19.6% and 14.33%,
respectively. (Standard & Poor's 500 stock index fell 3% in
the quarter.) But lately, there is divergence among companies
within many industry groups, and that's why some stock
pickers are excelling this year.</p>
<p>Currently, "investors are focusing a lot more on
company-specific issues, rather than the group," says John
Lazlo, an analyst who covers semiconductor stocks for
PaineWebber. "There used to be group moves, but now stocks
move company by company."</p>
<p>For example, Mr. Lazlo notes that Intel jumped 21% in the
first quarter, while National Semiconductor gained a more
modest 7%. Why the difference? Intel dominates the market in
certain chip products, Mr. Lazlo says. National Semiconductor
competes in chip products that are also produced by other
suppliers.</p>
<p>Also, the technical shape of the stock market this year
seems to favor stock pickers. Though the market has been
rising in recent weeks, the gains are concentrated in fewer
stocks lately. The advance-decline, which adds up the
difference between declining and advancing issues on the New
York Stock Exchange, "has been falling since August, showing
internal market weakness," says Robert Dickey, technical
analyst at Dain Bosworth Inc.</p>
<p>Skillful sector players did well last year by picking a
few well-performing industry groups, like oil or beverage
stocks. Sector players are "top-down" investors. They believe
they can spot macroeconomic trends in the world economy that
will benefit a specific industry.</p>
<p>Sometimes, the top-down strategists try to predict shifts
in the supply and demand of certain commodities, like copper
or oil. Other times, they try to be the first to spot a major
trend in consumer habits, such as greater use of personal
computers. A top-down strategist's tool box is full of
forecasts and statistics on interest and exchange rates, the
money supply and economic growth around the world, to name a
few.</p>
<p>For a "bottom-up" strategist, it's secondary if a company
is big or small, makes shoes or gasoline. These investors
thumb through stock guides and research reports in search of
companies that have strong franchises, unique products,
dominant market share and a host of other criteria that might
make the company special.</p>
<p>Typically, most money managers use a blend of these two
strategies, but are biased toward one discipline or the
other.</p>
<p>George Bennett, the portfolio manager of Massachusetts
Managed Sectors Trust, must be invested in five or fewer
sectors of the stock market at any one time, according to his
fund's charter. Yet Mr. Bennett says he is a stock picker at
heart and has brought a "bottom-up" discipline to a
"top-down" fund. This past year, this combined approach
earned the fund a roaring 42% gain. But the first quarter has
been tougher. To date, Mr. Bennett says he lags the market by
"two or three percent."</p>
<p>"Sector investing becomes difficult when the market is
going through a transition period like it is now," Mr.
Bennett says. "You don't have a momentum in sectors; I can't
really move in this market."</p>
<p>Mr. Bennett still argues that the current muddle in the
market and economy make top-down analysis all the more
important. "I have been hurt by macroeconomic factors," such
as the rise in interest rates and the scare over credit
quality in financial stocks, he says. Many companies in his
portfolio, he says, are fundamentally sound, even though
they've been trampled by the herd.</p>
<p>Graham Tanaka, president of Tanaka Capital Management
Inc., keeps a macroeconomic outlook in mind, but it's not his
main focus when he is hunting for stocks. "Buying sectors is
almost as tough as predicting the direction of the market,"
he says. Mr. Tanaka is a bottom-up investor, and his main
investing criterion is earnings growth. His largest holding
is Airborne Freight Corp., up 35% this year. Other holdings
among his 18 stocks include Intel, Humana Inc., Federal
National Mortgage Association and American Cyanamid Co.</p>
<p>"The common theme among these stocks is that we believe
earnings will be in three years 40% to 100% higher than they
are now," he says. Mr. Tanaka's accounts were up about 2% in
the first quarter, about five percentage points better than
the S&P 500.</p>
<p>Stock pickers don't always win big, of course. One of Mr.
Tanaka's holdings, National Data Corp., is down 27% this
year. The company yesterday reported third-quarter earnings
fell 4.4% from the year-earlier quarter. But Mr. Tanaka is
sticking with his bet. Current earnings problems are related
to the cost of the company's effort to build a new business,
he says. National Data closed down $1 at $24.50 in
over-the-counter trading yesterday. "We see it as a major
buying opportunity," Mr. Tanaka says.</p>
