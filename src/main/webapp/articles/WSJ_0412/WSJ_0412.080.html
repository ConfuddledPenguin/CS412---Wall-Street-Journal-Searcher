	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Thomas G. Hopkins was named vice chairman of
Limited Inc., a post that has been vacant since Robert
Morosky resigned as vice chairman and chief financial officer
three years ago.
   Despite his new title, the 57-year-old Mr. Hopkins doesn't
appear to be the heir apparent to Leslie Wexner, Limited's
53-year-old chairman, president and chief executive.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>According to those familiar with the situation, the new
designation is formal acknowledgement of the additional
operating responsibilities Mr. Hopkins has assumed in recent
years. Since 1982, Mr. Hopkins has served as executive vice
president, organizational development.</p>
<p>"I don't think heir apparent is an operative term in
Columbus, Ohio," said William N. Smith, an analyst at Smith
Barney, Harris Upham Inc. "Mr. Wexner has done an excellent
job of developing a management team, but I don't see him
stepping down in the near future."</p>
<p>At the same time, Limited named Mr. Hopkins and Kenneth B.
Gilman, executive vice president and chief financial officer,
to the company's board. Limited will now have 13 board
members.</p>
<p>Apparently determined to avoid naming a clear No. 2
executive, Mr. Wexner told one associate yesterday that "Ken
and Tom are my right hand and my left hand, but I'm
ambidextrous."</p>
<p>When Mr. Morosky served as vice chairman, he was
considered Mr. Wexner's most likely successor at the
retailing giant. However, after Mr. Morosky resigned, many of
his responsibilities were delegated to others. Company
presidents now supervise their own information systems and
distribution centers, and Mr. Morosky's role as the Limited's
top financial executive has been assumed by Mr. Gilman.</p>
