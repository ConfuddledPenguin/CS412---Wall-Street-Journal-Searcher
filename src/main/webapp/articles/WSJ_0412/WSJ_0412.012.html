	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Bonds gyrated with the price of oil before
ending unchanged to modestly higher.
   "It was the first time in a long time that the bond market
tracked oil," said Kevin Flanagan, money-market economist at
Dean Witter Reynolds Inc.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>While the bond market always has some concern about the
inflationary implications of oil prices, it was the gyration
in energy prices that caught the market's attention.</p>
<p>Bond prices reached their peak levels of the day when oil
prices slumped. When oil prices later reversed direction and
recouped those losses, bond-price gains were trimmed.</p>
<p>Traders said the erratic energy markets held center stage
because there were few other developments to focus on during
the last full trading day of the week. Most bond trading
desks will close at 2 p.m. EDT today and will remain closed
through tomorrow in observance of Good Friday.</p>
<p>The Treasury's sale of $7.52 billion of new seven-year
notes went "as advertised," according to one trader. The
8.62% average yield was in line with expectations. However,
dealers and analysts said there was some disappointment that
institutional investors and the Japanese didn't show much
interest.</p>
<p>The bulk of the issue was bought by Wall Street dealers
for their own accounts, especially arbitrage desks, which
purchased the new seven-year notes while selling other
securities.</p>
<p>In trading, the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond ended
nearly 1/4 point higher, a gain of about $2.50 for a bond
with a $1,000 face amount. In when-issued trading, the new
seven-year notes were quoted at a yield of 8.63%, down from
8.64% immediately after the results were announced.</p>
<p>The mortgage-backed securities market received some
bearish news from Lewis Ranieri, one of the market's founders
who is chairman of Hyperion Capital Management Inc.</p>
<p>In a speech to institutional investors, Mr. Ranieri said
the government's bailout of the thrift industry could result
in huge sales of mortgage-backed securities. He noted that
the Resolution Trust Corp., the government's conservator for
insolvent thrifts, now has about $185 billion in assets and
so far has sold very little.</p>
<p>Mr. Ranieri said most of the assets, which are whole loans
and not securities, will be packaged into mortgage securities
as thrift liquidations proceed. He estimates that the RTC
could sell between $60 billion to $70 billion of mortgages in
the next six months and a total of $100 billion over the next
18 months.</p>
<p>Based on the speed at which the government is seizing
troubled savings and loans, Mr. Ranieri said about half of
the $500 billion of mortgage securities currently in thrift
portfolios could be sold over the next five years. The added
supply, he said, could expand the size of the mortgage-backed
securities market by 100%.</p>
<p>Junk Bonds</p>
<p>Prices of junk bonds, or high-yielding, speculative-grade
securities, were mixed in trading that was driven by rumors.</p>
<p>The junk bonds of RJR Nabisco Inc. surged on talk that
Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co. was snapping up the bonds.</p>
<p>But R.H. Macy & Co. bonds got clobbered on reports that
one Wall Street firm was short-selling the bonds.</p>
<p>A spokesman at RJR, which is controlled by KKR, declined
to comment on the speculation.</p>
<p>But dealers named Los Angeles-based Jefferies & Co. as a
major buyer of RJR bonds yesterday. David Feinman, a junk
bond trader at Jefferies, said the firm was "both a buyer and
seller of the {RJR} securities." Mr. Feinman declined to
comment on whether the firm was buying the securities for
KKR, saying only that the firm handled trades in RJR
securities "for a variety of customers."</p>
<p>Other traders said the buying by Jefferies caused other
dealers to scramble to cover short sale positions. In a short
sale, dealers sell borrowed securities and later seek to make
a profit by buying the securities back at a lower price.</p>
<p>RJR's 13.71% convertible pay-in-kind debentures, due in
2009, finished up 3 3/4 points at 81 1/4 on the New York
Stock Exchange. The other widely held RJR issue, the 13.71%
exchangeable pay-in-kind debentures, maturing in 2007, ended
4 3/4 points higher at 68 3/4.</p>
<p>RJR pay-in-kind bonds have been volatile for several
weeks, falling on concerns that the coupon on the bonds would
be reset at more than 20% and rising on speculation that the
company will either launch a tender offer for the pay-in-kind
issues or exchange them for a new security plus cash or
equity or both.</p>
<p>Macy's 14 1/2% senior subordinated debentures due in 1998
fell two points to 75 while its 14 1/2% subordinated
debentures due in 2001 were off two points at 62.</p>
<p>Merrill Lynch Capital Markets was rumored to be
short-selling Macy bonds to hedge a long position in Ames
Department Stores Inc. Bonds of Ames Department Stores
plunged nine points Tuesday on news about the company's
distressed financial condition. A Merrill spokesman declined
to comment on the rumors.</p>
<p>Separately, Moody's Investors Service Inc. said credit
rating downgrades of U.S. corporations outpaced upgrades by
four to one in the first quarter. Moody's said ratings of 95
corporations representing about $75 billion of long-term debt
were lowered, and ratings of 23 corporate issuers
representing $26 billion of debt were upgraded.</p>
<p>Treasury Securities</p>
<p>The benchmark 30-year bond was quoted late at a price of
99 4/32 to yield 8.57%, compared with 98 30/32 to yield 8.59%
on Tuesday. The latest 10-year notes ended at 99 5/32 to
yield 8.61%, compared with 99 2/32 to yield 8.63%.</p>
<p>Short-term rates were slightly lower. The discount rate on
three-month Treasury bills was 7.76% for a bond-equivalent
yield of 8.00%, while the rate on six-month Treasury bills
was 7.76% for a bond-equivalent yield of 8.17%.</p>
<p>The Treasury's seven-year note auction attracted the
largest amount of individual investor buying at such a sale
since last April. The reason was the relatively high yield.</p>
<p>The 8.62% average yield on the notes was up from 8.02% at
the previous seven-year note auction on Jan. 10 and was the
highest since 9.39% on April 12, 1989.</p>
<p>The robust buying by individual investors, however, didn't
totally offset the lack of interest by institutions.</p>
<p>Here are auction details:</p>
<p>Rates are determined by the difference between the
purchase price and face value. Thus, higher bidding narrows
the investor's return while lower bidding widens it.</p>

<p>The notes are dated April 16 and will mature April 15,

<p>Mortgage-Backed Securities</p>
<p>The $2.9 billion of Franklin Savings Association
zero-coupon mortgage securities that were the subject of the
recent decision by the Resolution Trust Corp. regarding
post-insolvency interest are trading at close to their
accreted value because of investor concerns about an early
call.</p>
<p>The $800 million of bonds due in 2014 trade at 6 1/4; the
$1.6 billion of bonds due in 2019 at about 4; and the $500
million of bonds due in 2024 at roughly 2 1/2, according to
one trader.</p>
<p>These prices are slightly above their accreted values
based on the yields of about 12% at the pricing in 1984, but
the prices are down several points from levels before
Franklin Savings' troubles emerged earlier this year. The
institution is being operated under the conservatorship of
the RTC after being seized in mid-February.</p>
<p>Zero-coupon bonds are sold at a deep discount to face
value. The bonds then accrete, or slowly rise in value, until
they reach their full face value at maturity.</p>
<p>The current price of the Franklin zero-coupon securities
is a reflection of the investor belief that the bonds will be
called.</p>
<p>In trading yesterday, most mortgage securities rose as
much as 1/8 point.</p>
<p>Foreign Bonds</p>
<p>Japanese government bonds weakened as short-term interest
rates and the value of the dollar rose.</p>
<p>In morning trading, the Bank of Japan bought 300 billion
yen ($1.9 billion) of overnight commercial paper at 7%. Prior
to this purchase and since the last discount rate rise on
March 20, the central bank has bought commercial paper three
times, once at 6.84% and twice at 6.88%.</p>
<p>Dealers said the increase in the rate at which the central
bank bought commercial paper seems to indicate that the Bank
of Japan is willing to let short-term rates go higher, thus
making long-term debt with a lower rate a less-attractive
investment.</p>
<p>Rates on new three-month certificates of deposit were
7.5%, up from 7.45% on Tuesday. The price of Japan's
benchmark 10-year bond fell 0.28 to 86.23 to yield 7.31%.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Canadian bonds rose between 3/8 and 3/4 point
on improved sentiment. Traders said the better tone is an
indication that investors believe rates have stabilized, at
least for now, after rising for the past three weeks.</p>
<p>British bonds ended moderately lower after a seesaw day,
as participants awaited today's release of several key
economic indicators, including the March retail sales and
employment reports. Britain's 11 3/4% benchmark bond due
2003/2007 fell 1/4 to 97 28/32 to yield 12.04%.</p>
<p>West German bonds ended stronger with the value of the
mark, but trading was lifeless. Bonn's benchmark 10-year bond
rose 0.38 to 94.30 to yield 8.63%.</p>
<p>Municipals</p>
<p>Tax-exempt issues were unchanged to 1/8 point higher in
late trading, having barely budged.</p>
<p>What little life there was in the market was in the
new-issue arena, where $187 million of new debt was priced.</p>
<p>Underwriters led by Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. reported
an unsold balance of about $46 million for $119 million of
Baltimore County consolidated public improvement bonds and
metropolitan district bonds.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, an unsold balance of about $23.2 million
remained for $68 million of Dallas limited tax bonds, won by
a Prudential-Bache Capital Funding group.</p>
<p>Looking ahead, $53 million of Milwaukee general obligation
corporate purpose bonds will be priced via competitive bid
today. No large negotiated issues are expected to be priced
today.</p>
<p>Among actively traded bonds, New Jersey Turnpike
Authority's 7.20% issue of 2018 was unchanged at 97 3/8 bid
to yield 7.40%.</p>
