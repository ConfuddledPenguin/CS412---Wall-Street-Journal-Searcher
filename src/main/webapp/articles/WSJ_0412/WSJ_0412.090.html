	<p class="article-leader">CHICAGO -- Abbott Laboratories was sued by a shareholder
who claims the maker of hospital products and pharmaceuticals
violated federal securities laws by failing to disclose
regulatory difficulties.
   The suit, filed in federal district court here, said
Abbott misled investors because its public statements didn't
indicate "that at least one of Abbott's manufacturing plants
was operating in serious violation of Food and Drug
Administration health and safety rules and regulations."</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Federal inspectors late last year turned up
quality-control problems at Abbott's North Chicago
injectable-drug facility. The company -- which has
consistently maintained that the shortcomings were technical
in nature -- responded to the findings with a plan outlining
corrective measures, but FDA officials last month labeled the
plan insufficient. The FDA has suspended approval of new drug
applications involving drugs made at the injectable-drug
facility until the matter is resolved.</p>
<p>As a result of Abbott's "misrepresentations and omissions"
involving the problems, the suit contends, the company's
stock price was artificially inflated. The suit seeks
class-action status on behalf of people who bought Abbott
stock from Feb. 21, 1989, to March 20, 1990, and asks for
unspecified damages.</p>
<p>Abbott called the suit "groundless," saying the company
has "met all disclosure obligations."</p>
<p>In composite New York Stock Exchange trading yesterday,
Abbott closed up 62.5 cents at $69.25, not far below the
52-week high of $70.375.</p>
