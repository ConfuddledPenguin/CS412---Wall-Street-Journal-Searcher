	<p class="article-leader">ENSR Corp. said it agreed to a $125 million acquisition
offer from a unit of a German company.
   ENSR, Houston, said its directors approved an offer of
$8.25 a share for all 9.6 million ENSR shares from American
NuKEM Corp., a U.S. subsidiary of NuKEM G.m.b.H., a German
holding company. The proposal also calls for NuKEM to assume
some ENSR debt, and is subject to NuKEM's acquiring 66.67% of
the shares outstanding. ENSR said a tender offer will begin
within five business days.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>In American Stock Exchange trading yesterday, ENSR surged
$2.125 to $8.</p>
<p>ENSR provides environmental consulting services and
hazardous waste remediation. The company had 1989 revenue of
$158 million. American NuKEM, based in New Jersey,
specializes in incineration and waste treatment. It had 1989
revenue of $49.6 million. The majority owner of its parent,
NuKEM G.m.b.H., is Rheinisch Westfaelisches
Elektrizitaetswerk AG, the largest utility in Germany. The
other two holders of NuKEM G.m.b.H. are Degussa AG and
Metallgesellschaft AG.</p>
<p>Bert Wollen, ENSR interim chief executive officer, said
the two companies have almost no duplication of services, and
complement each other geographically.</p>
