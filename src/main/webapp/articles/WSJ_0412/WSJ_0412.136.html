	<p class="article-leader">HomeFed Corp. said first-quarter net income rose 13%, to a
record $34.5 million, or $1.48 a fully diluted share.
   The San Diego, Calif.-based thrift cited increased net
interest income and tight expense controls. HomeFed also
benefited from an improving net-interest margin, the
difference between what it pays for funds and what it earns
on its assets. That at least partly reflects one positive
aspect of the much-maligned thrift bailout bill. The bill has
led to a reduction in cost of funds by putting some desperate
thrifts, which have to pay more to attract money and bid up
interest rates, out of business.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>In the year-earlier period, HomeFed earned $30.5 million,
or $1.31 a share.</p>
<p>HomeFed said net interest income totaled $116 million, 14%
above the year-earlier quarter's $101.7 million. Its
net-interest margin was 2.87, compared with 2.70 a year
earlier.</p>
