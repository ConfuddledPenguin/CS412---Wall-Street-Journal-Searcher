	<p class="article-leader">SPRING, Texas -- It's Saturday night, and streams of
revelers are handing their BMW and Coupe de Ville keys to
valet parkers in front of the imitation chateau columns
flanking the entrance to the Raveneaux Country Club.
   In keeping with the club's Napoleonic theme (Raveneaux
having been a favorite country retreat of the emperor and
Josephine), the main ballroom features a lifesize portrait of
the diminutive general over the stone fireplace. But there
all analogies to the French empire end.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>A fortyish crowd dressed in bobbysocks and letter sweaters
competes in a Hula-Hoop contest and twists to "Hermann and
the Dearhearts." Some women lie down to do dance steps in the
air, drawing applause as their panties come into view. A
singer burps into his microphone, prompting a roar of
laughter.</p>
<p>So this isn't the decorous dinner dance that typifies
social events at a Piping Rock, The Club of Brookline, or Los
Angeles Country Club. Raveneaux may be nouveau, but it's
thriving, especially with the baby-boom generation whose more
radical members once foreswore country clubs as the social
arm of the military-industrial complex.</p>
<p>Country clubs are being swamped with applications, with
some, like the Glen View Club in Golf, Ill., and Belle Haven
Country Club in Alexandria, Va., going so far as to refuse
new applications until current rolls thin. The surge has
swelled the average wait for memberships at existing clubs to
five years, doubling from 1986, says the National Club
Association.</p>
<p>Club membership rose 9.5% during the the 1980s -- after a
two-decade slump -- at 200 clubs surveyed recently by Pannell
Kerr Forster, an accounting firm. With space so limited at
the old-line clubs, a national building boom of new clubs is
under way.</p>
<p>While their ambiance may lean toward Naugahyde and sock
hops rather than faded chintz, most have much in common with
their more staid predecessors, whose members "were the upper
class created by wealth from the industrial revolution in the
1880s," says Michael Ebner, a historian of the upper class at
Lake Forest College in Illinois. "They needed a refuge and
the reassurance of those without antagonistic feelings toward
riches."</p>
<p>The ranks of country clubs had swelled to about 5,000 by
the 1920s, but hundreds closed during the Depression, when
many fortunes disappeared. The rising popularity of golf
during Dwight Eisenhower's presidency sparked a country club
resurgence curbed first by the social upheavals of the '60s
and then by economic uncertainties of the '70s. Now that
demand is strong again, even the newest clubs can afford to
be choosy.</p>
<p>At Brookstone Golf & Country Club in suburban Atlanta,
John McWilliams, a 32-year-old real estate developer,
straightens his tie before a get-acquainted dinner with Mary
Browning, the membership director. The club is just two years
old, yet its brochure claims a "time-honored tradition of
togetherness and camaraderie." Empty brass plaques await the
names of Brookstone's first golf and tennis champions. Its
newsletter is priming members for upper-class athletic
pursuits with a regular feature, "Croquet Term of the Month."
Halls are adorned with paintings of the palace gardens at
Versailles.</p>
<p>In the mock-Edwardian dining room overlooking the croquet
course, Mr. McWilliams pops the question: "What are the
parameters for rejecting applicants?"</p>
<p>"Gut feeling," says Ms. Browning, impeccably attired in a
black dress and white lace stockings.</p>
<p>"Gut feeling?" he asks, lowering his voice close to a
whisper.</p>
<p>"Yes," she answers firmly, her eyes fixed on his.</p>
<p>Acceptance would mean "instant prestige," he says. Many of
Mr. McWilliams's friends want to apply, but he says some
can't afford the $15,000 initiation fee. "I have been
fortunate."</p>
<p>Mr. McWilliams compliments the chef, the clubhouse and Ms.
Browning. Still, the dinner ends noncommittally. She plans to
play a few purely social holes of golf with him before making
her recommendation to the rest of Brookstone's five-member
admissions committee.</p>
<p>"If he flunks with Mary Browning, he's toast," says James
L. Rhoden Jr., builder and owner of Brookstone. (As of this
writing, and after several rounds of golf, Mr. McWilliams
still isn't a member, though he is said to have made a
favorable impression.)</p>
<p>Mr. Rhoden owns four clubs, and one such dinner soured at
the Indian Hills Country Club near Atlanta when the
prospective member haughtily snapped his fingers at a
waitress and ordered Glenfiddich Scotch. Informed that the
bar didn't stock that brand, he vowed it would when he became
a member. The membership committee nixed the applicant,
making sure that prophecy wouldn't come to pass.</p>
<p>Ms. Browning, a professional who has screened new members
for eight other clubs in the past decade, says, "It has to be
invitation only, or we're just barkers at a carnival waving
people in." At many of the new clubs, a professional
membership consultant remains a member of the admissions
committee, as does the club owner, even after the club's
start-up phase.</p>
<p>For many, membership in a country club is more than just a
status symbol: It truly is the fulfillment of the American
dream. Roger Thiltgen, the 38-year-old president of an oil
and gas concern in Houston, grew up on his family farm
outside Galena, Ill. Caddying at the local Dubuque Country
Club offered him an escape from shoveling the hog pen and
opened up new vistas. He dreamed of "bettering himself," he
says. Now, as a member of Raveneaux, he feels that dream has
been attained.</p>
<p>For Tommy Lee, 39, a vice president of a Houston
biomedical concern, "country clubs were another world to me.
I come from a mediocre family background, at best." At the
Raveneaux sock hop, Mr. Lee proudly plays host at a table for
his boss and other friends.</p>
<p>This sense of achievement may be especially strong for
members of minority groups traditionally excluded from the
old-line clubs, many of which remain conspicuously white and
Protestant. "We're establishing a new pecking order," says
Frank Martinez, a medical-equipment salesman who recently
paid $19,500 to join St. Ives Country Club near Atlanta. "I'm
a minority from the inner city of New York, so this is a big
deal to me," says Mr. Martinez.</p>
<p>He recalls that his father, a New York bus driver, was
murdered while walking home from work in 1969. "Whatever I
have today, there were trials and tribulations to get here,"
he says.</p>
<p>Although the new generation of country clubs insists it
doesn't discriminate on the basis of race or religion,
minorities remain underrepresented. Blacks, for example,
typically account for far less than 1% of total club
membership, and none were present when a reporter visited a
half-dozen clubs in the Kansas City, Houston and Atlanta
areas. During the party at Raveneaux near Houston, Mr. Lee
was complimented by one of his guests for playing on "the
last all-white" football team at the University of Texas; he
seemed embarrassed by the comment but said nothing.</p>
<p>Some black leaders fear that the surge in country club
applicants, who are overwhelmingly white, represents a
retreat from integrated cities and workplaces. "Many people
are shunning the melting pot that promotes racial harmony,"
says Kelvin Perry, president of the Black Chamber of Commerce
in Kansas City. "This nation has spent much time and money on
desegregation programs, but a lot of people just haven't
bought into it."</p>
<p>But the new club applicants include plenty of former
social activists who once marched against the Vietnam War and
campaigned for civil rights. "The club is a great place for
my kids. It replaces some school and municipal activities
that are overcrowded and run by people I don't know," says
Carter Harrison Jr., 42, a suburban Kansas City financial
consultant who campaigned for anti-war presidential candidate
Eugene McCarthy in 1968. He recently joined two country
clubs, Woodside Racquet Club and the Kansas City Country
Club. Back in the '60s, "I wouldn't have had anything to do
with this," he says.</p>
<p>Tom McMillan, a lumbermill owner in Kansas City, has gone
from social activist to social climber. Eighteen years ago,
he was taking over the ROTC building at the University of
Vermont in protest, but now he takes his two children to the
Homestead Country Club, a modern, ranch-style club with 20
tennis courts, a big pool but no golf course. "In 1970, I
thought country clubs symbolized the effete establishment and
the Vietnam War machine," says the 36-year-old Mr. McMillan.
"But today, the club is a safe harbor for my family."</p>
<p>Paula Chandler, 39, another Woodside member, says she
smoked pot and was arrested during peace demonstrations at
the University of Kansas 20 years ago. She once ridiculed the
country club crowd favored by her father, a plastic surgeon.
"But I've come full circle," says Ms. Chandler, who now
supervises a dating service. "Today, the club gives me a
sense of belonging and being with others of my kind."</p>
<p>Her father, Allen Chandler, adds, "Her generation has
decided it's OK to be filthy capitalist swine like me."</p>
<p>Still, some of the new clubs are catering to the
distinctive political and social values of the baby-boom
generation. Shadow Glen, a new $16 million club near Kansas
City, has recruited a state biologist to plant prairie grass
around the golf course and release flocks of ruffed grouse, a
species long absent from the area. "We're selling something
to people who were radicals. You can be a card-carrying
Sierra Club member and still appreciate this place," says
Charles Sunderland, a Shadow Glen official.</p>
<p>At St. Ives Country Club near Atlanta, where the clubhouse
isn't even completed, management has organized a clothing
drive for the homeless and a Christmas fund-raiser for abused
children. "Many of our members grew up in a turbulent time,
wanting to do the right thing," says Suzanne Carmichael, St.
Ives's director.</p>
<p>Many of the new applicants also view club membership as a
business proposition, even at clubs that bar conspicuous
displays of business papers in an effort to preserve a social
atmosphere. Mr. McMillan, the lumber-company owner, for
example, was urged to join Homestead by his bankers. "They
loaned me money to buy the company and suggested it pick up
the membership tab because it would be good for business," he
says.</p>
<p>Jerry Carey, a Kansas City stockbroker, joined a club
after an experience at a restaurant in which he tipped a
maitre d' in advance to greet him by name during lunch with a
client the next day. "But the guy just looked right through
me," he says. "You never know who you'll sit down beside at a
public restaurant," he adds. "And at public tennis courts,
people wear all kinds of clothes and have bad manners."</p>
<p>Laurel Cochennet, 32, an employee benefits consultant in
Kansas City, recently paid $26,000 to join a new club after
reading the names on its burgeoning rolls. "Many were from
companies I wanted to do business with," she says
matter-of-factly.</p>
<p>Despite worries that overbuilding or a recession could
muzzle the club boom, demographics suggest demand will remain
strong. International Golf Management Inc., in Pebble Beach,
Calif., recently announced plans to build a dozen new
superprestige clubs at a cost approaching $50 million each,
with memberships that could trade much like stock.</p>
<p>International Golf's members will all have to buy $150,000
of stock in the new company, and pay dues of at least $1,000
a month for "ultra-premier" surroundings, according to John
Killip, senior vice president of marketing. The clubs will
feature splits of champagne served at the tenth hole and a
clubhouse designed for workaholics -- complete with four
"boardrooms" for corporate directors' meetings.</p>
<p>Taking the club boom full circle, International Golf is
aiming at the old-line club crowd, not the fun-loving
newcomers at places like Raveneaux. Says Mr. Killip: "Our
clubs are for traditionalists, gray people -- pretty boring
people."</p>
