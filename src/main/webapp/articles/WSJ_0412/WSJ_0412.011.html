	<p class="article-leader">We commend you for your special supplement on the 1990
census (March 9), but would like to call your attention to
the fact that "Census '90" virtually ignored the minority
communities in this country and the issues they face in the
coming census. While these issues most directly affect
Hispanics, African-Americans and Asian-Americans, they also
will greatly affect the general public once the counting is
done.
   Major problems include undercounting of the Hispanic
community and other minority groups, an insufficient number
of Hispanic enumerators to go into those communities where
Hispanics will be missed, and the lack of an outreach program
by the U.S. Census Bureau. As a result, Hispanics and other
minorities will once again face an undercount. An undercount
in the census means decreased political power and fewer
federal dollars going into communities across the country.</p>

<p>I was fascinated by your observation in "Census '90" that
"computer whizzes have flourished in this statistical
hothouse." Exactly a century ago, inventor Herman Hollerith
saved the 1890 census from disaster and in doing so spawned a
revolution in data processing. In 1880, the Census Office had
been overwhelmed. It took seven to eight years to produce
detailed reports by largely manual methods. If nothing were
done by 1890, one census might overlap another and the whole
process fall into chaos. Fortunately, Hollerith's
punched-card tabulation system, developed for the 1890
census, saved the day.</p>
<p>Employing the first practical data-processing system, the
Census Office completed tabulating most of the 1890 census in
only two to three years, although Hollerith's system was used
only for the population portion of the job. For the first
time, it had been possible to draw every possible combination
of data from the census schedules. And the machines saved the
Census Office $5 million in labor costs.</p>
<p>Hollerith's punched-card machines made quite a hit with
industry, too. By the time he sold his Tabulating Machine Co.
in 1911, Hollerith's firm had about 100 commercial customers.
His firm was merged with several others making butcher
scales, time clocks and coffee grinders. In 1924, the new
company changed its name to IBM.</p>
<p>Witnessing Hollerith's machines at work in the 1890
census, journalist T.C. Martin noted, "The apparatus works as
unerringly as the mills of the Gods, but beats them hollow as
to speed."</p>
