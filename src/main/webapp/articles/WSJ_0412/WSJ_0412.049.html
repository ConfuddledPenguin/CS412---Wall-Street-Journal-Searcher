	<p class="article-leader">OTTAWA -- The Canadian government is considering an appeal
against a Quebec Superior Court decision, which ruled that
the operations of the Canadian Competition Tribunal were
unconstitutional.
   The Quebec court said the tribunal has been given the
powers of a court but doesn't have the "essential attributes"
of judicial independence.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The four-year-old tribunal is made up of appointed
judicial and business experts. It reviews cases referred to
it by the government's antitrust agency, the Bureau of
Competition Policy.</p>
<p>Howard Wetston, the bureau's director of investigation and
research, said the ruling was "an important decision that
raises a number of questions related to the enforcement of
the competition act." Mr. Wetston said he is carefully
studying the decision with the Canadian Attorney General and
is "considering the question of an appeal."</p>
<p>The Quebec court's ruling concerned a case involving Alex
Couture Inc., a Quebec City-based processor of animal waste
products. The tribunal approved a government order in 1987
blocking the merger between Alex Couture and a Montreal
animal rendering company. Alex Couture won a stay of
proceedings and then launched the court challenge against the
tribunal.</p>
<p>The Quebec court said that because the tribunal lacks the
judicial independence of a court it violated Alex Couture's
"right of association" and its right to be heard by an
independent and impartial tribunal.</p>
<p>The ruling prompted speculation about the possible impact
of the court's decision on major cases including its recent
approval of a consent order covering the merger of Imperial
Oil Ltd. and Texaco Canada Inc.</p>
<p>An Imperial Oil spokesman said the ruling doesn't have any
implications for its merger with Texaco Canada because the
consent order was reached between the company and the
competition bureau. The $4.15 billion Imperial-Texaco Canada
merger, was the biggest case to come before the tribunal
since the agency was established in 1986.</p>
<p>Imperial Oil, which is 70%-owned by Exxon Corp., purchased
78% of Texaco Canada last year from Texaco Inc. The Canadian
Bureau of Competition Policy reached an agreement for a
consent order with Imperial requiring Imperial to sell
various assets including 600 gas retail outlets, a refinery
and storage and distribution terminals.</p>
<p>The tribunal approved the consent order after some
adjustments were made. Imperial is proceeding with the
divestitures.</p>
