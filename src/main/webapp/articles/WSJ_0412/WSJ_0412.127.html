	<p class="article-leader">DAYTON, Ohio -- Mead Corp. reported a 25% decline in
first-quarter earnings because of lower prices for some types
of paper and heavy spending for new products and facilities.
   The forest products and electronic publishing concern
earned $39.5 million, or 62 cents a share, down from $52.6
million, or 81 cents a share, a year earlier. Sales crept up
1.1% to $1.14 billion from $1.13 billion.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Net income was 10% to 20% higher than many analysts had
been expecting. Mark S. Rogers, paper analyst with
Prudential-Bache securities, said net was well above the 50
cents a share he had forecast, but, like other analysts
contacted, he hadn't had a chance to obtain detailed numbers
that would show where profits exceeded his expectations.</p>
<p>Lower prices for uncoated papers and corrugating medium
were a major factor in the earnings decline, officials said.
Uncoated papers are used in copiers, computer printers and
other office applications. Corrugating medium is used to make
containers.</p>
<p>The $560 million expansion program under way at the
company's coated paperboard plant at Mahrt, Ala., disrupted
production of existing facilities at the site, Mead said.
Also, the company is incurring wage and training costs for
the people who will operate the new facilities beginning late
in the 1990 third quarter. A planned shutdown to modernize a
paper machine at Escanaba, Mich., also cut into earnings. The
company also is spending heavily to develop its new color
copying business, which Mead calls Cycolor.</p>
<p>Mead Data Central Inc., the company's electronic
publishing subsidiary, and Zellerbach, a paper products
distribution unit, had slightly higher first-quarter profit,
Mead said.</p>
