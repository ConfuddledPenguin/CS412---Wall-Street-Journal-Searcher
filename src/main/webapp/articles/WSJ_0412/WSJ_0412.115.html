	<p class="article-leader">Craig Corp., Los Angeles, said it was restating downward
its earnings for the first quarter, ended Dec. 31. The move
reflects Craig's share of nonrecurring losses in December by
Reading Co. in which Craig then held a 20% stake.
   Craig, with interests in retail supermarkets and the
importing of photographic accessories, said it restated its
first-quarter earnings to $1.5 million, or 32 cents a share.
Previously, the company reported earnings of $1.7 million, or
38 cents a share.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Edward Kane, president of Craig, said he expects results
for Philadelphia-based Reading, which has interests in real
estate and manufacturing, "would be positive in the future."
Craig now holds 34.3% of Reading's Class A common stock.</p>
