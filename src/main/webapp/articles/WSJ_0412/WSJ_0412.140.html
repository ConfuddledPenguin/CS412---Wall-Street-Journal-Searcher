	<p class="article-leader">VICTORIA, British Columbia -- The British Columbia
government said it plans to preserve as parkland more than
half of the 26-square-mile Carmanah Valley, a battleground
between environmentalists and loggers that reputedly contains
Canada's tallest trees.
   The decision, following months of debate between
environmental groups and MacMillan Bloedel Ltd., a forest
products firm that has cutting rights to the timber, was an
attempt at compromise that apparently satisfied neither side.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>MacMillan Bloedel said the move would cost 150 jobs and
could set a precedent for other land-use disputes, which
currently affect about 30% of a license area on Vancouver
Island that includes Carmanah, and about 3% of the province's
total timber-cutting land.</p>
<p>The Western Canada Wilderness Committee, an environmental
group, said it is considering court action to block the plan,
which requires legislation before it can proceed.</p>
<p>MacMillan Bloedel, 49.9%-owned by Noranda Forest Inc., a
unit of Toronto resource giant Noranda Inc., had proposed to
set aside a 1,300-acre tract on the valley floor that
contains the oldest trees, including a 311-foot Sitka spruce
that is believed to be the world's tallest.</p>
<p>Forests Minister Claude Richmond said compensation that
must be paid to MacMillan Bloedel for the loss of
timber-cutting rights "could amount to millions of dollars."</p>
