	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- U.S. businesses, showing unexpected optimism
about the economy, plan to increase capital spending 7.8%
this year, the Commerce Department reported.
   Despite evidence that business activity remains sluggish,
companies told the department in a survey taken in January
and February that they plan to spend $512.82 billion on new
plant and equipment this year. In a survey taken this past
autumn, the companies had projected a 6.4% increase.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"The figures reflect: one, the weakest part of the
economic cycle is behind us; and two, the competitive reality
of the global marketplace," said David Littmann, senior
economist at Manufacturer's National Bank of Detroit.</p>
<p>This year's expected growth would follow two years of
booming capital spending, and could keep the eight-year
economic expansion alive. The survey suggests higher spending
than econometric models have been forecasting, said Gordon
Richards, an economist for the National Association of
Manufacturers. Many analysts didn't anticipate companies
would increase capital spending as much because economic
growth has been slow because of high interest rates.</p>
<p>After adjusting for inflation, the department estimated
capital spending would increase 7.6% in 1990 to $503.41
billion, after rising 8.6% last year to $467.83 billion.</p>
<p>Overall capital spending is likely to be bolstered
especially this year by strong investment among service
industries in office-automation equipment. Non-manufacturing
businesses plan to increase their capital spending 9.7% --
not adjusted for inflation -- a rise just slightly less than
last year's 10% increase.</p>
<p>Manufacturing industries plan to increase spending on new
plants and equipment just 4.9% this year. Although that's
more than the 3.8% increase they planned for 1990 at the time
of this past fall's survey, the figure is still substantially
lower than the 11% growth in 1989.</p>
<p>Durable goods manufacturers plan to increase capital
spending 2.1% in 1990. The aircraft industry plans to boost
its spending 9.3%, while manufacturers of electrical
machinery project an 8% increase for this year. The survey
shows that the automobile sector plans to decrease its
capital spending 11.3%.</p>
<p>Manufacturers of nondurable goods plan to spend 7.1% more
this year on new plants and equipment. In the fall, they
expected 6.8% growth. All the figures are seasonally
adjusted.</p>
<p>Many economists believe that investment won't track
overall economic activity as closely in the 1990s as in the
past, but will be driven instead by the need of U.S.
companies to meet mounting global competition. The economists
suggest that, in turn, could help reduce cyclical swings in
economic activity. "The capital spending trends in the 90s
will transcend the business cycles," said Mr. Littman.</p>
<p>Here is the breakdown by major industries of capital
spending results for past periods and estimates for current
and future periods. For comparability with annual totals, the
quarterly figures are at seasonally adjusted annual rates, in
billions of dollars:</p>
