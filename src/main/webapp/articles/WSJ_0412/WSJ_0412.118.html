	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- The default rate on federally guaranteed
student loans fell slightly, but Education Department
officials said the decline probably doesn't reflect the
impact of a new program to reduce defaults of tuition loans.
   The default rate fell to 15.6% in fiscal 1988 from 17.3%
in fiscal 1987. Officials said that about 2.5 million loans,
totaling $9.2 billion, entered the repayment phase in fiscal
1988 and that about 385,000 loans, totaling $1.1 billion,
were in default by the end of fiscal 1989, which ended Sept.
30. A loan doesn't fall into default until a payment is 180
days overdue.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Last June, the government launched a default reduction
program aimed at schools with default rates of more than 20%.
Of the 5,226 post-secondary schools tracked by the Education
Department, nearly 1,600 have default rates of more than 20%.
If these institutions don't lower their default rates, their
ability to offer guaranteed student loans will be limited or
suspended. Last year, the department reported that vocational
schools had the highest default rates, followed by two-year
colleges and then four-year colleges.</p>
<p>Some of the reduction in the default rate reflects
technical changes in the way the rate is calculated. Without
these changes, the default rate would have been 16.5%, rather
than 15.6%.</p>
