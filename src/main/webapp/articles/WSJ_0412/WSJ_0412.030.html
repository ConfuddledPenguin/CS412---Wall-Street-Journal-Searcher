	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- The Federal National Mortgage Association
said first-quarter net income rose 67% to a record $277
million, or $1.06 a share.
   In the year-earlier period, Fannie Mae reported earnings
of $165 million, or 66 cents a share. The results reflected
increases in net interest income on Fannie Mae's portfolio,
income from guaranty fees on mortgage-backed securities, and
other income. At the end of the quarter, Fannie Mae's
portfolio totaled $123.64 billion and it had $246.39 billion
in mortgage-backed securities outstanding.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The federally chartered, publicly traded corporation
operates a secondary market in home loans, buying mortgages
from lenders, packaging some into securities for sale to
investors and holding the rest in its portfolio. The company
said the latest results were its ninth consecutive quarter of
record profits.</p>
<p>The results were "based on solid fundamentals," said
Chairman David Maxwell. "Our net interest margin was the
widest in history; we issued the largest volume of
mortgage-backed securities in any first quarter; and
properties acquired through foreclosures dropped to their
lowest level since peaking in 1987."</p>
<p>Fannie Mae said that net interest income rose to $378.4
million from $253.1 million the year before, reflecting
increases in the average investment balance and the net
interest margin. Guaranty fees rose to $120.5 million from
$94.5 million.</p>
<p>The provision for losses was $75 million, down from $80
million the year before. Charge-offs totaled $59 million in
the first period, up slightly from $58 million a year ago.
During the latest quarter, Fannie Mae acquired 2,455
properties through foreclosure, down from 2,975 in the 1989
quarter and 44% below the 1987 third-quarter peak.</p>
<p>Administrative expenses rose to $66.3 million from $56.1
million in 1989. Federal income taxes nearly doubled to
$110.1 million from $56.8 million.</p>
<p>Fannie Mae bought $5.7 billion of mortgages in the latest
quarter and sold $1 billion. That compares with purchases of
$3.4 billion the year before and sales of $1.8 billion. It
also said it issued $24.1 billion of mortgage-backed
securities in the latest period, compared with $14.4 billion
the year before.</p>
