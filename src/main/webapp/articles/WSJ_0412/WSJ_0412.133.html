	<p class="article-leader">CHARLOTTE, N.C. -- First Union Corp. reported that
first-quarter earnings fell to $71 million, or 67 cents a
share, from $72 million, or 68 cents a share, a year ago.
   However, the regional banking company said results
improved in all of its state banking operations over the
fourth quarter, including Georgia where it had run into
costly delays consolidating operations.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The results were better than most analysts had expected.
Analysts had been wary of the impact of a heavy load of
problem assets stemming from First Union's recent acquisition
of troubled Florida National Banks of Florida Inc.</p>
<p>Some analysts also remained skeptical following First
Union's earlier announcement that a recent federal
examination of its Florida commercial real estate portfolio
had turned up no significant problems. Further examinations
of First Union's real estate operations in Georgia, South
Carolina, North Carolina and Tennessee are scheduled for some
time this quarter.</p>
<p>The company said Florida National accounted for $234
million of the $272 million increase over last year in First
Union's nonperforming assets, including problem loans, to
$502 million. The company's provision for loan losses also
grew in the period to $24 million from $14 million a year
earlier.</p>
<p>First Union said, however, it expects to squeeze $40
million worth of expense savings out of the Florida National
merger both this year and next. "Our strongest focus in this
regard is on gaining the merger efficiencies in Florida,"
said Chairman Edward Crutchfield Jr.</p>
