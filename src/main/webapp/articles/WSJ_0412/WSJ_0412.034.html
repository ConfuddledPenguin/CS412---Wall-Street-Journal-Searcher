	<p class="article-leader">The failure of Shimon Peres to form a government may have
dealt a lethal blow to the leadership hopes of the veteran
politician, even though Israel's president gave him an
additional 15 days to bring possible coalition partners into
line.
   It is Mr. Peres's Labor colleague, Defense Minister
Yitzhak Rabin, who is likely to benefit from Mr. Peres's
failure, rather than Likud-bloc leader Yitzhak Shamir.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>But the loser certainly is the Israeli political system,
which continues to crumble under the weight of too many small
parties, too many cynical deals and too little stability to
address the serious issues confronting the state.</p>
<p>Mr. Shamir, who lost a parliamentary vote of confidence in
March, isn't any more likely to be able to break the 60-60
parliamentary deadlock than Mr. Peres. But Mr. Rabin, whose
more-hawkish stance may be more in tune with the current
Israeli temperament than Mr. Peres's dovishness, stands some
chance of being able to win the support of the small
religious parties whose backing now is crucial to the
formation of a coalition.</p>
<p>Mr. Rabin has been waiting quietly in the wings, careful
to avoid appearing to undermine Mr. Peres. But he is known to
believe that Mr. Peres acted unwisely in bringing down Mr.
Shamir's government, misjudging the solidity of the religious
parties' support. While the Labor Party may be reluctant to
risk the internal schism of overthrowing its own leader, it
also may want to avoid facing an early election with a
weakened leader in charge.</p>
<p>The unseemly political horse-trading of the past few weeks
has damaged Mr. Peres. His willingness to promise huge slices
of Israel's diminished financial pie to the ultra-religious
parties, and his sudden effusive speeches about religious
observance have antagonized secular Israelis, while making a
coalition deal with Avraham Sharir, a renegade former Likud
hard-liner, repelled others.</p>
<p>Mr. Peres had little choice, as any coalition had to be
cobbled together from disparate and often antithetical
elements. The difficulty of the endeavor was demonstrated all
too clearly when the Knesset, or parliament, erupted in
pandemonium on the news that two hard-line religious-party
members had withdrawn their support from Mr. Peres after
promising it only hours earlier.</p>
<p>President Chaim Herzog, in giving Mr. Peres an extension
to the three weeks he initially granted after last month's
no-confidence vote, said in a statement that the recent
political horse-trading raised "piercing questions about our
system of government and our political culture." In an
apparent reference to the need to overhaul Israel's
proportional representation system, which gives small parties
disproportionate power in coalition bargaining, the president
said Israel would eventually have to face these questions.</p>
<p>Mr. Peres may yet manage to forge his fragile coalition if
the ultra-Orthodox Augudat Israel party replaces its two
defecting Knesset members, or brings them back to the current
party line in support of Mr. Peres. The two defectors oppose
trading land for peace.</p>
<p>If he fails, Mr. Hertzog may call for an early election.
But "there are two arguments against it," says Shlomo
Avineri, professor of political science at Hebrew University.
"Everything, including the peace process, would be put on the
back burner. And the Soviet immigration, which now requires a
great national effort, and which many Israelis think is the
best thing that's happened for a long time," would suffer as
government planning stalled for the poll.</p>
<p>If Labor turns to Mr. Rabin, options widen. Mr. Shamir has
ruled out serving in a national unity coalition under the
leadership of Mr. Peres, but Mr. Rabin may prove more
palatable to a majority of Likud members.</p>
<p>The 67-year-old defense minister, like Messrs. Shamir and
Peres, is a familiar face to Israeli voters. As commander of
the Israeli defense forces during the Six-Day War, he won
kudos and was afterward appointed ambassador to the U.S. In
1973 he joined Golda Meir's government as labor minister and
on her resignation less than a year later narrowly defeated
Mr. Peres in a leadership ballot. In 1977, a scandal over his
wife's illegal U.S. bank account forced his resignation as
prime minister.</p>
<p>He has held the defense portfolio since 1984, and while
bungling badly during the early days of the Palestinian
uprising, has recently experienced a rise in reputation
through his handling of negotiations with Cairo over plans
for Palestinian elections. To many Israelis, Mr. Rabin
bridges the gap between their perception of Mr. Peres as
likely to make a bad deal with the Arabs, and Mr. Shamir's
rigid reluctance to make any deal at all.</p>
