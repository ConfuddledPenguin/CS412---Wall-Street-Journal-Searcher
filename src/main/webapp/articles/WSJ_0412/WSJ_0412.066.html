	<p class="article-leader">In reply to your March 21 editorial "No Tears for New
Jersey": Many women in New Jersey voted for Gov. Jim Florio,
known as a liberal, but also as a candidate who would protect
a woman's abortion rights. The other candidate promised no
new taxes and no abortion rights. Freedom carries a price
tag.

<p>I was struck by the timing of your editorial: March 21
coincided with the first day of spring, which to me has
always meant the return of fowl, particularly ducks. I feel
so abused by Gov. Florio's tax proposals that I want to
declare open season on this particular duck. How can the
governor (1) so callously ignore the will of the people and
(2) really believe that those making between $50,000 and
$100,000 are "rich" in this obscenely expensive state.</p>
