	<p class="article-leader">The big players in the credit card business are
consolidating their grip on the $147.7 billion market -- and
that's bad news for cardholders hoping for lower interest
rates.
   In the 13 months through January, at least $9.4 billion of
bank card loans -- representing about 7% of the Visa and
MasterCard business -- changed hands through acquisitions,
according to First Chicago Corp.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Industry officials say the pace of acquisitions is
expected to quicken, as Citicorp, Chase Manhattan Corp.,
Sears, Roebuck & Co., First Chicago, BankAmerica Corp. and
the other top card issuers take over more and more of the
business.</p>
<p>Just last month, First City Bancorp. of Texas sold its
$545 million bank-card portfolio to Bank of New York. The
reason: It was too small to compete effectively, a spokesman
says.</p>
<p>As the credit card wars continue to heat up, consumers can
expect to be enticed with bigger credit lines, special
services and a barrage of advertising. But don't expect lower
interest rates.</p>
<p>With fewer and bigger players, the dominant issuers face
less competitive pressure to cut their charges. That's
especially true since consumers generally tend to pick card
issuers on the basis of such factors as convenience and size
of credit ceiling, not interest rates. In fact, surveys show
that while at least half the people with credit cards use
them to borrow money, few people accept the cards intending
to do so.</p>
<p>Moreover, at a time of growing problems with real estate
and other loans, card issuers have a strong incentive not to
lower their rates: Credit card profit margins are the highest
in the banking business, despite loan losses that in some
cases are as high as 5% of loans outstanding. Pretax profits
for the biggest issuers are huge -- running between 3% and 5%
of total loans. That means pretax credit card profits at
Citicorp, by far the largest issuer, could soon reach $1
billion annually.</p>
<p>Some issuers still offer better deals than others, and
cardholders who maintain an account or some other banking
relationship sometimes get preferential treatment. But almost
all of the largest issuers charge a standard 19.8% rate, with
a $20 annual fee. And issuers show no signs of willingness to
cut the fees.</p>
<p>Asked if First Chicago plans to compete by lowering rates,
Scott Marks, an executive vice president, replied: "I think
not."</p>
<p>The prospect of little or no relief on rates gives
cardholders added incentive to pay off their balances. That's
especially true now that only 10% of the interest on credit
card bills is tax-deductible. Beginning next year, none of it
will be deductible.</p>
<p>People who don't have the resources to pay off all of
their credit card debt might want to consider reducing their
monthly payments by switching to a home equity loan.
Currently, the rate on a typical home equity loan, with an
interest rate of two percentage points over the banks' prime
rate, is just 12%. Moreover, interest payments on home equity
loans of as much as $100,000 are generally tax-deductible.</p>
<p>Borrowers should remember, however, that home equity loans
are secured by their home. Although they can be useful for
consolidating other debt, and sometimes for buying a car or
financing an investment, it isn't a good idea to borrow
against your home for things like a night on the town or a
new spring outfit.</p>
<p>High interest rates have been a sore point for years with
credit card users and critics such as Rep. Charles E.
Schumer, a New York Democrat. As recently as two years ago,
he threatened to propose a national cap on credit card rates.
But he held off, hoping that a law forcing uniform and more
prominent disclosure of rates and fees would spur price
competition by making consumers more aware of the costs of
borrowing by plastic.</p>
<p>That hasn't happened, however, and now Mr. Schumer says
he'll wait before trying to legislate lower rates. "The only
way it's going to happen is if one company with national
advertising power breaks out of the mold -- instead of
everybody winking at each other," he says. "Unfortunately,
{the uniformity of rates} isn't a violation of the law."</p>
<p>Instead of competing on rates, credit card issuers are
offering bigger credit limits, touting features such as
replacement insurance for merchandise bought by plastic and
using extensive advertising to make their cards appear more
appealing than that of their competitors.</p>
<p>James L. Bailey, who runs Citicorp's huge credit card
business, notes that switching to a different credit card
issuer is often as easy as mailing back a postage-paid,
direct-mail solicitation. Switching checking accounts, on the
other hand, usually involves a wait in line at two separate
banks.</p>
