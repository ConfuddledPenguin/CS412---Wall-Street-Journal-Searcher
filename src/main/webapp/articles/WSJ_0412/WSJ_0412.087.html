	<p class="article-leader">PHILADELPHIA -- Philadelphia Electric Co. said its annual
earnings will be reduced nearly $1 a share if state
regulators adopt a proposed $300 million reduction in the
company's pending rate request. In 1989, the company earned
$590 million, or $2.36 a share.
   Joseph F. Paquette Jr., chairman and chief executive
officer, said the expected rate reduction would also require
a one-time write-off of $1.20 a share during 1990 and a cut
in the dividend rate. Directors are expected to review the
dividend rate, currently $2.20 annually, April 23.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>In composite New York Stock Exchange trading yesterday,
Philadelphia Electric closed at $17, down 12.5 cents.</p>
<p>The Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission indicated
during preliminary polling last month that it was proposing a
rate increase of about $250 million, or less than half of
Philadelphia Electric's $549 million request. Two
administrative law judges earlier recommended a rate increase
of only $117 million. A final decision is expected next
Thursday.</p>
<p>Analyst Edward J. Tirello of Shearson Lehman Hutton said
he estimates 1990 earnings of around $1.80 a share, based on
a rate increase of $250 million. He said the estimate takes
into account cost-cutting measures that Mr. Paquette is
expected to announce soon. Mr. Tirello said he expects the
annual dividend rate to be cut to about $1.45, which would
reduce the yield to between 8% and 8.5%. The company declined
to comment on the estimates.</p>
