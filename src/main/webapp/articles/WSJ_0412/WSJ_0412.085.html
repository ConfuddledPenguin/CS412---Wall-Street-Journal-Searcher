	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Moody's Investors Service Inc. downgraded
credit ratings on U.S. companies four times more often than
it upgraded them during the first quarter.
   The credit-rating service issued lowered marks on some $75
billion of debt held by 95 corporations in the quarter,
citing such factors as declining real-estate values and the
rising debt obligations of many speculative-grade companies.
Moody's said 23 companies with $26 billion of debt were given
improved ratings in the same period.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Financial-services concerns such as banks, thrifts and
securities firms had the sharpest declines in credit ratings,
Moody's said, with 43 companies receiving lower marks.</p>
<p>The rating service said the current rate of downgrades is
unlikely to slow much this year.</p>
