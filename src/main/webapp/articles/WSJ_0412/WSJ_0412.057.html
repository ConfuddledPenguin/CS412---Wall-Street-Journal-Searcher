	<p class="article-leader">FORT WORTH, Texas -- Texas-New Mexico Power Co. filed with
the Public Utility Commission of Texas for a $43.1 million,
or 13.34%, rate increase, which it said is needed partly to
cover the costs of a 150-megawatt power plant that is nearing
completion in Robertson County, Texas. The utility said it
expects its rate case to be heard in July.</p>
