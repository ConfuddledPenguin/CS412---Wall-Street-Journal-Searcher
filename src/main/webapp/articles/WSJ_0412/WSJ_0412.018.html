	<p class="article-leader">TORONTO -- Harold Ballard, the 86-year-old cantankerous
majority-owner of Maple Leaf Gardens Ltd., died yesterday
afternoon, renewing speculation about who will inherit
control of the company and its profitable National Hockey
League franchise.
   Mr. Ballard's 80% stake in Maple Leaf Gardens, which owns
the Toronto Maple Leafs, is currently valued at about 130
million Canadian dollars (US$111.2 million). The company said
a summary of Mr. Ballard's will and testament will be
released after disclosure to his family and others, but it
didn't indicate exactly when that will happen.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Canada's two biggest beer companies, Molson Cos. and John
Labatt Ltd., have an interest in the provisions of Mr.
Ballard's will. Molson, which already owns the Montreal
Canadiens N.H.L. franchise, has an option to buy 20% of Mr.
Ballard's stake in Maple Leaf Gardens. Labatt is a partner in
an entertainment promotion concern owned in part by William
Ballard, Mr. Ballard's oldest son. William Ballard also
indirectly holds stock in Maple Leaf Gardens.</p>
<p>Control of Maple Leaf Gardens could be complicated further
by any claim on Mr. Ballard's estate made by Yolanda Ballard,
56, his longtime companion. Mr. Ballard never married Ms.
Ballard, but she legally adopted his last name and claimed to
be his common-law wife. If an Ontario court rules that Ms.
Ballard was Harold Ballard's common-law wife, she could be
entitled to a portion of his estate.</p>
<p>After several years of acrimony in his family, Mr. Ballard
recently reconciled with his two sons and his daughter. He
became seriously ill last January and had been in the
hospital since then for treatment of acute diabetes and heart
ailments. In February, a court in the province of Ontario
declared him incompetent to manage his affairs and he
subsequently was replaced as president of Maple Leaf Gardens.</p>
