	<p class="article-leader">TORONTO -- The Canadian partnership of the accounting firm
Price Waterhouse was ordered by the Ontario Securities
Commission to submit to an independent review of its policies
on auditing public companies.
   The order was the result of a hearing in which commission
staff argued that Price Waterhouse failed to comply with
generally accepted auditing standards in its audit of the
fiscal 1987 financial statements of National Business Systems
Inc.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>As previously reported, the president of National Business
resigned in January 1988 after irregularities were found in
the company's 1987 financial statements. He and four other
former company executives subsequently were charged with
theft and fraud.</p>
<p>In a negotiated settlement, Price Waterhouse agreed to
comply with the order, but it didn't admit or deny the
accuracy of commission staff's allegations and conclusions.</p>
<p>Under the order, Price Waterhouse must retain a firm of
chartered accountants to review certain of its auditing
policies and procedures. Price Waterhouse must implement the
independent accountant's recommendations within three months
of receiving its report, and must pay 70,000 Canadian dollars
(US$59,900) toward the cost of the commission hearing.</p>
<p>The order is the first of its kind from the commission,
said Brenda Eprile, associate chief accountant. It indicates
the commission's willingness to investigate allegations that
generally accepted auditing standards haven't been followed
during the audit of a public company, she said.</p>
<p>"We felt this was a major case," Ms. Eprile said.</p>
<p>In a statement, Price Waterhouse said the "great majority"
of changes made to the original 1987 financial statements of
National Business "reflected a massive management fraud
involving certain of the former senior {National Business}
executives" and others. It said the items that resulted in
changes to the financial statements occurred in the company's
Canadian operations for which Greenwood Cook & Co., an
accounting firm based in Mississauga, had primary
responsibility.</p>
<p>Commission staff said the relationship between Price
Waterhouse and Greenwood Cook during the 1987 audit of
National Business was "unclear." But Price Waterhouse was the
auditor of record and signed the financial statements, Ms.
Eprile said.</p>
<p>In a letter sent to the commission last month, Price
Waterhouse said it believed that Robert Greenwood, a partner
at Greenwood Cook, received certain payments made privately
by the former president of National Business while Greenwood
Cook was auditing National Business' statements.</p>
<p>Mr. Greenwood declined to comment. In a letter sent to the
commission, Greenwood Cook said it objected to publication of
the settlement agreement between the commission and Price
Waterhouse because certain allegations concerning Greenwood
Cook are "inaccurate."</p>
<p>National Business Systems, based in Mississauga, Ontario,
supplies plastic transaction card machines and related
equipment. Hees International Bancorp Inc., a Toronto
merchant bank and management and investment services concern
controlled by brothers Peter and Edward Bronfman, assumed
management of National Business in 1988.</p>
