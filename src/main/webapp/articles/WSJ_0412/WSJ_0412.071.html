	<p class="article-leader">A question for tax experts:
   Bonded Collection Service, of Longmont, Colo., has a
health-insurance plan whose beneficiaries are the firm's
owner, William Boettcher, two sons who work for him, and
about 20 other employees. Can Bonded deduct the costs of
insuring the three family members?</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>No, said Mr. Boettcher's accountant.</p>
<p>Outraged, Mr. Boettcher called the toll-free taxpayer
hotline. An Internal Revenue Service employee said the firm
could, in fact, deduct the costs for all three.</p>
<p>Both were wrong, an IRS specialist ultimately told
Bonded's befuddled accountant, Thomas Brock. The sons' health
insurance could be deducted, but not Mr. Boettcher's.</p>
<p>And the disagreements had only begun. Mr. Brock, the
accountant, turned to yet-another accountant, who sided with
the second IRS employee. Yet Mr. Brock still tells his client
that Bonded shouldn't take a chance by taking the deduction.</p>
<p>Mr. Boettcher himself says he only wants to pay his taxes
-- "every penny I owe. But in this case," he adds, "it's so
totally unfair and so totally confusing that nobody knows."</p>
<p>Does anybody really understand the U.S. tax code?</p>
<p>As Americans scramble to meet Monday's deadline for filing
1989 income-tax returns, they are struggling to comply with a
tax law that has been altered, overhauled, nipped and tucked
in at least eight major pieces of legislation in the past 10
years. The law has become so comprehensive and so specific as
to be in many areas utterly baffling, not only to taxpayers
but also to their accountants and attorneys and to the civil
servants charged with administering it.</p>
<p>Compounding the confusion are thousands of pages of IRS
regulations meant to tell taxpayers how to comply with the
law's intricacies. In its rules on so-called passive-loss
deductions, for example, the IRS defines the notion of
"activity" -- in 196 pages.</p>
<p>The thicket of regulations has grown so dense that Rep.
William Archer, a Texas Republican who personally helped
write much of the nation's tax law, found last year that, for
the first time in his life, he couldn't figure his own income
tax.</p>
<p>To be sure, millions of working Americans have found
preparing their returns far simpler in the past few years.
The sweeping revision of the tax code in 1986 substantially
increased the standard deduction, sparing many taxpayers the
chore of itemizing deductions, and removing millions of
low-income people from the tax rolls entirely. Between 1987
and 1988, according to the IRS, more than eight million
taxpayers switched from itemizing to using the standard
deduction.</p>
<p>But for most of the seven million businesses that file
returns -- plus more than 30 million individuals who still
itemize -- compliance has never been more complex. Nor more
costly. Some accountants say they are charging as much as 2%
of a small firm's revenue simply to prepare a tax return.</p>
<p>Some businesses are avoiding transactions purely to escape
the expense and burden of calculating the tax consequences.
One Ohio contractor, for example, decided against selling an
office building because the cost, complexity and uncertainty
of proving that it was, for tax purposes, an investment
property overwhelmed the benefits of the deal.</p>
<p>"He decided he couldn't afford to go through with it,"
says the developer's accountant, Ronald Cohen. "The whole
system is totally out of control. It's made us very much more
profitable -- at the expense of our clients."</p>
<p>Big business is also overwhelmed. It takes 2 1/2 hours for
a sophisticated computer at Dow Chemical Co. to complete one
calculation to satisfy IRS rules on allocating costs between
U.S. and foreign operations. Even the company's tax experts
are often confounded by the rules.</p>
<p>"There are whole big areas that are so uncertain that we
go to our tax counsel and ask them and they say, `Darned if I
know,' " says Glenn White, who directs Dow Chemical's tax
department. "People in the business community are losing
confidence in the system."</p>
<p>Taxpayers have long complained about the complexities.
Now, policy makers in Washington are beginning to echo the
outcry. Rep. Dan Rostenkowski, the Illinois Democrat who
heads the tax-writing House Ways and Means Committee,
recently ordered a study of ways to simplify the code.
Lawrence Gibbs, the IRS commissioner in the mid-1980s, cites
worries that complexity is pushing the system toward
breakdown. Many tax authorities, he says, are concerned that
"the tax law, in a large part, may no longer be administrable
by the Internal Revenue Service," he says, "and no longer
comprehensible by most taxpayers and many of their advisers."</p>
<p>The problem is obvious to anyone glancing at the stack of
tax-code pages on employee benefits, rules that affect
multinational corporate giants and tiny companies alike --
and ultimately, of course, millions of working Americans.</p>
<p>Every year since 1980, Congress has extensively changed
the laws governing private pension plans. The Association of
Private Pension and Welfare Plans says that, to distinguish
the employer from the employees, a firm must apply rules
concerning predecessor employees in section 414(a) of the tax
code; employees of a controlled group of corporations in
section 414(b) with a cross-reference to section 1563(a);
employees of partnerships under common control, as laid out
in section 414(c), with a cross-reference to Treasury
Regulation section 1.1563-1(d); employees of affiliated
service groups, as defined in section 414(m), and, not to be
forgotten, leased employees in section 414(n).</p>
<p>All this occurs before a company tries to figure out which
of its employees are "highly compensated" under the code's
anti-discrimination rules. But watch out: "Compensation" is
defined differently in sections 414(s), 414(q)(7) and
415(c)(3), the pension association notes. A highly
compensated employee might make an annual salary of $75,000
or more. Or $50,000 or more. Or $45,000 or more. To determine
which, a company must run a series of complicated, costly
tests. Or, more likely, pay an outside firm to do it.</p>
<p>In an effort to cut down on rising accountants' bills,
Vermont Marble Co., with 100 employees and a retirement
program, is updating some software to organize data better.
But for the most part, it's at the mercy of its
ever-more-expensive outside professionals. "Small-business
men are interested in running their business," says Thomas
Turner, Vermont Marble's treasurer and vice president of
finance. "They want to spend full time on that."</p>
<p>Relying on outsiders has its own perils. "We, the
professionals, haven't a clue as to what the laws mean," says
Sam Gilbert, who runs United Plan Administrators, a small
pension-consulting firm in Sherman Oaks, Calif. Some pension
consultants tell him they simply ignore parts of the law.
"They say, `I've read it. I don't understand it.' We are
really encouraging noncompliance."</p>
<p>The IRS itself concedes that complexity breeds evasion.
"If taxpayers cannot understand our laws, regulations and
administrative rules, or if compliance with those
requirements is prohibitively expensive, taxpayers will
engage in shortcuts and not fully comply," says IRS
Commissioner Fred Goldberg. The costs are stunning: A 1% drop
in compliance, he told Congress recently, costs the
government more than $5 billion in revenue.</p>
<p>Attacking the problem, Mr. Goldberg has ordered IRS
lawyers to draft simpler, briefer regulations -- even if that
requires issuing rules that might neglect to address every
possible situation under the law.</p>
<p>But the frenzy of tax legislation in recent years and
intricacy of some of the new statutes' requirements are
burying the IRS itself. Revenue agents must constantly
relearn the code in order to enforce it. And sorting through
the mounds of legislation, the agency's thousands of
attorneys have missed important deadlines in issuing
regulations implementing the law.</p>
<p>Stuart Lewis, managing partner of Washington law firm
Silverstien & Mullins, has frozen the pension plans of about
30 client companies because the IRS hasn't finished
regulations on part of the 1986 Tax Reform Act intended to
crack down on discriminatory retirement plans -- a statute
that went into effect Jan. 1, 1989. So, no money is being
paid into the plans.</p>
<p>"I'm confident of the advice I give," says Mr. Lewis, an
expert on pension tax law. But because of the gaps in IRS
guidance, "sometimes the advice is that there's no answer to
the question."</p>
<p>The code's growing complexity also is leading many top tax
practitioners to quit giving advice in whole areas of tax
law. No longer do most of the partners in Winthrop, Stimson,
Putnam & Roberts, a high-powered Manhattan law firm, tackle a
pensiontax question. They leave it to Susan Serota, who heads
the firm's retirement and employee-benefits department, and
her legal team. "You really do have to be a specialist in the
area," she says. "I don't think a generalist would be
comfortable giving advice in the area anymore. Certainly none
of my partners do."</p>
<p>But many tax authorities deplore specialization as
inefficient and harmful to the tax system.</p>
<p>"Increasingly all my brethren in the bar are saying
there's just certain sections of the code I can't look at
anymore," says Gordon Henderson, the tax chief at Weil,
Gotshal & Manges in New York. "More and more, we are becoming
narrower and narrower in our focus. That's an expensive way
to run a tax system."</p>
