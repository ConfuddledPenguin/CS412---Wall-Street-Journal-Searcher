	<p class="article-leader">The most popular movie in America right now is a
children's picture called "Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles." In
its first 10 days of release, this action picture about the
four radioactively altered turtles who live in the sewers of
Manhattan, eat pizza and fight bad guys has grossed almost
$51 million, one of the biggest openings ever.
   I liked the movie's deliberately artificial netherworld
and found it to be less frightening than many other popular
children's movies. Less frightening, for example, than
"Honey, I Shrunk the Kids," in which a microscopic child
lands in a bowl of cereal and is almost eaten by his father.
And I could appreciate the sentimental bond between the
turtles and their ninja master, a stern but kindly old rat
called Splinter.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>But for the most part I found the Mutant Ninja Turtle
experience a little like watching a film shot in a language I
don't speak: I got the drift but sensed I was missing
something, maybe everything. Unfamiliar with the comic book
and the cartoon show and the merchandise they have spawned, I
simply wasn't tuned into this '90s version of the Cabbage
Patch doll craze. Why do these teen turtles talk like Valley
Boys? Why are they named for Italian Renaissance painters?</p>
<p>I decided to find some experts who could explain the
appeal of this mix of martial arts, Manichaean drama and
"film noir".</p>
<p>First I checked with one of the more level-headed
seven-year-olds I know, Kirlene Caesar, a second-grader who
lives in Manhattan. Kirlene isn't a dedicated fan of the
Ninja Turtle animated television series. Still, she persuaded
an aunt to take her to the movie the day after it opened. She
pronounced the movie "very good." She elaborated: "Splinter
and the turtles have good moves and do good things. Shredder
{the bad guy} and his helpers do bad things."</p>
<p>Looking very demure in a pale blue corduroy dress,
sneakers with glittery pink laces and white tights embossed
with teddy bears, Kirlene said she thought the fight scenes
were exciting though she almost missed one crucial battle. "I
was eating popcorn and tying my shoes," she explained. "I
wanted to see the fight because I wanted the turtles to win."</p>
<p>There was tension, but not too much tension. "At the
beginning I was scared it was going to be scary, but it
wasn't," she said. "I was scared when Splinter was in jail. I
was scared he was going to die and he is one of my favorite
characters." Kirlene also found a role model in the character
of April O'Neil, the girl reporter saved by the Ninja
Turtles. "April was on TV and said, `Hey Raphael.' I want to
be on TV and say hi to my friends," said Kirlene.</p>
<p>I was starting to understand, but felt it was wise to
check in with Kirlene's nonurban counterparts, to see how
they reacted to the grittiness, the fighting. So I called the
placid suburbs of Denver, Colo., and spoke to my niece Laura
Abrams, age 10, just back from learning the box step at her
cotillion dance lessons.</p>
<p>"I loved it; it was really neat," said Laura. "I liked the
way the Mutant Turtles dressed."</p>
<p>As it turned out, I'd stumbled into a Ninja Turtle
stronghold. Laura's entire family, including her parents and
two siblings, had seen the movie on opening day.</p>
<p>Did Laura think the movie was violent? "Oh yes," she said.
"My brother Andrew's gotten much more violent since he's into
the turtles. He has swords and is always jumping on chairs
going, `Yah] Yah] Yah]'"</p>
<p>Andrew, age four, offers some insight into why the Mutant
Ninja Turtles have become a multimillion-dollar industry even
though many parents, including his, are unnerved by their
vivid hand-to-foot combat. His current stock of Ninja Turtle
goods include underwear, a thermos bottle, a biker pack,
pajamas, two shirts, jujitsu gear and a couple of Ninja
Turtle dolls. He would own more of the plastic figures but
the toys are now scarce in Denver.</p>
<p>Andrew's take on the movie? "I liked it when Michelangelo
went spinning around and when he cut up the pizza and it
landed on Splinter's head." As for April, the girl reporter:
"Yucko," said Andrew. "She doesn't even fight." Does he want
to see the movie again? "A new one," he said.</p>
<p>Even Julie, Andrew's almost-14-year-old sister, has been
caught up in this Mutant Ninja madness. She's already checked
out the turtle movie twice. "These guys behind me, they've
seen it like three times," she reports. "They love it. These
girls I was with didn't like it at all because they didn't
understand it. They didn't have little brothers so they don't
know what ninjas are."</p>
<p>Julie also suspects that the Ninja Turtles may inspire
aggressive behavior. Her evidence lies in a 13-year-old boy
acquaintance who likes the turtles so much he was given a
model sewer for his birthday. After he saw the movie, Julie
reports, he instigated a fight with her. "But I had a skirt
on so it was really unfair," she said. Then she reconsidered.
"I think he might have done it anyway."</p>
<p>Should parents worry? Yes, said Debbie, the Abrams mother.
"Do you know the other day I saw some men coming out of a
sewer and I wanted to run home and get Andrew because of the
ninjas. I thought: What's America coming to? It's coming to
Ninja Turtles."</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>"Crazy People," a movie about an adman who goes mad and
becomes very successful writing truthful slogans, may contain
some of the funniest advertising copy ever written.
Unfortunately, the satiric slogans are surrounded by a
sentimental and silly vision of life in the asylum. Dudley
Moore is convincingly daft as the advertising executive, and
Daryl Hannah continues to uncover a lovely comedic talent.
Better wait until this one is on video, so you can zap to the
commercials.</p>

<p>VIDEO TIP: Turtles have been generally neglected
throughout film history. However, there is the delighfully
whimsical British film, "Turtle Diary," about two
turtle-obsessed adults. Glenda Jackson and Ben Kingsley are
swell as the eccentric author and the bookstore owner who
take it upon themselves to liberate the turtles trapped at
the local zoo.</p>
