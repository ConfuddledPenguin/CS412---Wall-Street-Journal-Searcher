	<p class="article-leader">PARIS -- Groupe Expansion S.A. said the capital base of
its controlling holding company, Ponex S.A., will be
strengthened when Dow Jones & Co. and two European publishing
groups acquire minority interests in the French business
publications company.
   Ponex is to remain 50.2%-controlled by Expansion Chairman
Jean-Louis Servan-Schreiber. Dow Jones, the publisher of The
Wall Street Journal and other publications and information
services, will take a 16.3% interest in Ponex. Handelsblatt
of West Germany will have a 13% stake and the Prisa Group of
Spain will have a 5% shareholding. The remaining 15.5% is
owned by a group of Expansion managers and institutional
investors.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Expansion said Dow Jones and Handelsblatt also will become
shareholders of Eurexpansion, a network of 30 European
financial and economic publications in 11 countries that was
set up by Expansion last autumn. Dow Jones will have a 15%
share in Eurexpansion, which remains 58% controlled by the
French group. Handelsblatt is taking a 20% interest.</p>
<p>Including its new stakes, Dow Jones's cumulative
investment in Ponex, Groupe Expansion and Eurexpansion will
be about $20 million. Dow Jones had held a 14.5% direct stake
in Groupe Expansion. But part of that is being shifted to
Ponex, reducing Dow Jones's direct holding in Groupe
Expansion to about 7.5%.</p>
<p>Mr. Servan-Schreiber confirmed that Groupe Expansion
probably will seek a listing on the Paris bourse some time in
1991. A decision will be made early next year, he said.</p>
