	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Entry-level luxury? It may be a contradiction
in terms, but Nissan Motor Co.'s Infiniti division hopes the
concept will jump-start lagging sales in a way that Zen-like
image advertising simply hasn't done.
   Infiniti yesterday unveiled the new G20 sedan scheduled to
appear in dealer showrooms in mid-September and to be priced
"under $20,000," officials said. Meanwhile, Infiniti Monday
will begin showing its cars and their features in detail on
network television commercials for the first time.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The new commercials will replace the rocks, trees and
pussy-willow buds that, officials now concede, dominated
their advertising for far too long. "We always said our No. 1
objective was to establish a brand, not to sell a model,"
said William Bruce, the head of Infiniti. But brand awareness
came more quickly than Infiniti expected, said Mr. Bruce,
which is why it's now time for Infiniti to emphasize the
less-esoteric task of selling cars.</p>
<p>The new G20 model is a big part of that effort for
Infiniti, which has posted disappointing sales since its
launch last November. The so-called near-luxury niche is one
of the hottest segments in the market.</p>
<p>Ford Motor Co. flopped in the segment and killed its
Merkur brand last year, but Infiniti's well-established
competition includes the Mercedes-Benz 190, Saab 900, Volvo
240DL, Honda Motor Co.'s Acura Integra and Audi of America,
with its 80 and 90 models. Bayerische Motoren Werke AG, which
spent much of the past few years moving its models upscale,
is launching its own new near-luxury model, the 318is, with a
base price of $21,500.</p>
<p>Besides those formidable opponents, the Infiniti G20 also
faces possible stiff competition from within Nissan itself,
specifically from the upscale Maxima sedan. The Maxima is
base-priced just above $20,000 and is marketed as a
"four-door sports car," which isn't terribly different from
the "sports luxury sedan" label that Infiniti has chosen for
the G20.</p>
<p>"Will there be some cannibalization? Yes," conceded Mr.
Bruce at a news conference. "But will it be minimal?
Absolutely yes." The G20 and Maxima offer different features,
he explained. The G20 has a four-cylinder multivalve engine
and standard antilock brakes, while the Maxima has a
six-cylinder engine and offers antilock brakes as an
extra-cost option.</p>
<p>The G20 went on sale in Japan in February as the Nissan
Primera. It will add to a growing Infiniti lineup that
already includes the Q45 luxury sedan, priced at about
$38,000, and the M30 coupe, priced at $23,500. In August,
Infiniti also will introduce a convertible version of the
M30. And another upscale model, priced perhaps in the $30,000
range, will be introduced in a couple of years.</p>
<p>The goal, Mr. Bruce said, is to add enough models and
enough dealers -- for a total of about 150 instead of the
current 65 -- to sell about 100,000 Infiniti cars in the U.S.
each year by 1995. But Infiniti clearly has a long way to go.</p>
<p>Infiniti sold only about 3,700 cars in the first quarter
of this year, while Toyota Motor Corp.'s rival Lexus division
sold 13,167 cars -- nearly four times as many. Lexus was
expected to outsell Infiniti by about 2-to-1 (based on a
higher production capacity and more dealers), but the current
sales gap has frustrated Nissan.</p>
<p>The sales comparison with Lexus "is inevitable; we know
that and we accept that," Mr. Bruce said. But he tried to put
the best face on the situation by noting that Infiniti sold
more than 1,500 cars in March, compared with fewer than 1,100
in each of the previous two months. "The increase in
month-to-month sales," he said, "is dramatic."</p>
