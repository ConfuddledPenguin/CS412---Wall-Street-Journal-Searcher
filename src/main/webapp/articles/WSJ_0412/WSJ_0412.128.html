	<p class="article-leader">California regulators said they will require that Pacific
Enterprises' Southern California Gas Co. unit credit
customers $13.5 million of a $24.2 million gain on the 1987
sale of the company's downtown Los Angeles headquarters.
   The company said it hasn't decided whether to appeal the
ruling. The gas company had asked for permission to keep the
entire gain; regulators with the California Public Utilities
Commission had challenged the need for the sale and argued
that the capital gain should be used to offset more costly
headquarters the gas company will occupy.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Frederick John, senior vice president of Pacific
Enterprises, said that if the ruling isn't appealed or
modified, the amount would be used to offset future increases
for Southern California Gas's 4.5 million customers.</p>
