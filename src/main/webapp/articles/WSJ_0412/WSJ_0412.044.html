	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- Only a few months back, Congress was
accusing the nation's financial regulators of being too soft
in their handling of Southwestern banks and thrifts.
   Now lawmakers are worried that the regulators are being
too hard in New England and other parts of the country.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The difference is the fear that a credit crunch is
beginning to choke off lending. And the result is that some
on Capitol Hill are accusing regulators of overreacting and
perhaps even pitching the economy into recession.</p>
<p>"I think the experience of Texas looms too large,"
complains Rep. Barney Frank, a Democrat from hard-hit
Massachusetts. He says he has been deluged by complaints from
bankers and borrowers about regulatory excess. "The
regulators tell me they are erring on the side of safety,"
says Rep. Frank, who sits on the House Banking Committee. "I
don't think they should be erring at all."</p>
<p>Says William Isaac, a former chairman of the Federal
Deposit Insurance Corp. who is now a bank consultant: "The
pendulum is swinging too far in the other direction. We
needed to tighten up, but I am concerned we're tightening up
too far, too fast."</p>
<p>The prime target of these complaints is Comptroller of the
Currency Robert Clarke, whose examiners have stirred much of
the controversy by picking apart commercial real-estate
portfolios in New England's banks. Mr. Clarke, a soft-spoken
Houston banking lawyer, isn't backing down. He points to the
$243 billion thrift bailout as the justification for his
agency's aggressive examinations of banks.</p>
<p>"The shareholders and the public who have paid and will
pay for {the thrift} mess have sent a pretty strong message
that they don't want to do it again," Mr. Clarke told a
bankers' convention last weekend.</p>
<p>Mr. Clarke insists his agency hasn't tightened the rules.
Rather, he argues, when an economic slowdown hits, "the old
rules produce different results." With office vacancy rates
climbing in New England and the region's economy weakening,
Mr. Clarke says, it's only prudent for banks to "adjust the
fine-tuning knob" in evaluating loans, particularly those
made to real-estate developers. He argues that the strong
approach taken in New England is a model for financial
regulation in the 1990s.</p>
<p>But prudence has a price. For example, since last fall,
when Mr. Clarke's examiners began scouring New England real
estate portfolios, three major New England banks have set
aside a total of more than $2 billion in reserves for
potential loan losses. That capital could have been used to
back as much as $30 billion in loans to the region's flagging
economy, says the chairman of one of the banks, Joel Alvord
of Shawmut National Corp. Now, small businesses of all kinds
are complaining that credit is harder to get. Examiners are
similarly peering over the shoulders of nervous bankers in
the Southeast and other parts of the country.</p>
<p>Some critics argue that Mr. Clarke's office has backed
into making monetary policy by draining liquidity from the
banking system. Indeed, Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan
Greenspan and others at the Fed are known to be concerned
that examiners might go too far or that bankers might
overreact by curtailing credit too severely. Mr. Greenspan is
understood to have personally conveyed this concern to Mr.
Clarke.</p>
<p>Officials of the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency
say the big reserves taken by New England banks are a sign of
past banker mistakes, not of regulatory overkill. Karen
Wilson, newly appointed deputy comptroller for the Northeast,
says many banks have failed to update property appraisals
that may be from three years ago, before values began to
slide. In some cases, loans were made without any recorded
appraisals at all. Too many banks were counting on a rising
market to hide sloppy practices, she asserts.</p>
<p>Tight competition bred loose standards. At one big New
England bank, the comptroller's office says, the average loan
officer oversaw 110 commercial loans involving 60 different
customers. "Nobody can keep up with 110 loans," says Stephen
Steinbrink, a top official in the comptroller's office who
has been coordinating the extra examiners shipped to the
Northeast.</p>
<p>Many analysts, bankers and accountants concede that
lending mistakes were made, but still insist that regulators
have reacted too harshly. They point in particular to the
regulators' insistence that banks declare as nonperforming
certain loans that still are being serviced and set aside
funds to cover potential losses on those loans. The practice
has even created a new term, the "performing nonperforming
loan."</p>
<p>Even if the lending rules haven't changed, banks are
operating in a highly charged atmosphere created by the
thrift mess. Last summer's thrift-bailout law vastly expanded
regulators' enforcement powers. Regulators flexing their new
muscles have given bankers the jitters.</p>
<p>For instance, the FDIC recently slapped a tiny bank in
Edna, Kan., with a $9,600 fine -- more than a tenth of the
bank's annual income -- for filing a quarterly report two
weeks late. Only after Kansas Sen. Robert Dole raised the
matter on the Senate floor did the FDIC agree to reduce the
fine; the new amount hasn't been settled. But that isn't
likely to calm bankers worried about fines that can hit $1
million a day under the thrift law.</p>
<p>Despite Sen. Dole's intervention, bankers are learning
that friends are harder to find on Capitol Hill these days.
The rules may not have changed for banks, but they certainly
have for Congress: Every member is aware that the Senate
Ethics Committee is investigating the "Keating Five" senators
who interceded with regulators on behalf of the now-defunct
Lincoln Savings & Loan Association.</p>
<p>But it's easier for lawmakers now that the focus has
turned to the potential economic effects of regulators'
exams. Last month Sen. Christopher Dodd, a Connecticut
Democrat and a member of the Banking Committee, held a public
session back home at which he worried aloud that examiners
might be applying the lessons of Texas to New England without
taking into account differences between the two regions.
Unlike the oil-patch states, "We're not an economy based on a
single industry," he told Ms. Wilson of the comptroller's
office. He also raised the possibility that regulators could
create a "self-fulfilling prophecy" of tumbling real estate
values as banks scramble to foreclose and sell properties.</p>
<p>Ms. Wilson denied that her agency's examiners are doing
anything more than making banks recognize the deterioration
that has already taken place in the market.</p>
<p>Last week Rep. Joseph Kennedy (D., Mass.) held a similar
-- but closed-door -- meeting at the Federal Reserve Bank of
Boston. "There's tremendous concern about being tainted with
the Keating Five," says Mr. Kennedy. "But I'm not arguing on
behalf of a specific bank. I'm trying to find out what's
going on with our economy."</p>
