	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- CBS Inc. posted a 52% increase in
first-quarter net income, boosted by the January telecast of
the Super Bowl. But CBS warned of an "uncertain" outlook for
the second half of this year amid a sluggish economy and
rising costs for sports contracts.
   CBS, the third-place network in prime time, has bet $3.6
billion over several years for big-time sports events in the
hope of sparking a ratings turnaround. The first two big
payments on that gamble come due later this year, the first
year of CBS's four-year contracts for major league baseball
and professional football, priced at $1.06 billion for each
four-year package.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>In the first quarter, when neither sports package had yet
kicked in, CBS earned $85.3 million or $3.31 a share, up from
$56.1 million or $2.18 a share a year ago. Revenue rose 16%
to $851 million from $730.6 million.</p>
<p>The earnings far exceeded the consensus estimates of Wall
Street analysts, who had expected CBS to earn about $2.70 a
share instead of the $3.31 the company turned in. CBS stock
rose $2 a share immediately following the company's earnings
report, then fell back a bit to close at $180.125, up 62.5
cents, in composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange.</p>
<p>CBS didn't break out results for the CBS network. A
spokesman said, however, that the network would have posted
higher earnings even without the help of football's Super
Bowl. Analyst Raymond Katz of Mabon, Nugent & Co. estimates
the Super Bowl added $20 million in pretax profit to the
network's results.</p>
<p>The company's broadcast group, which includes the network,
TV stations and radio stations and is CBS's only major
subsidiary, logged a strong 89% gain in pretax operating
profit in the quarter. CBS also was aided by continuing
interest income on its $2.9 billion in cash and marketable
securities, gaining $41.7 million compared with $39.4 million
a year ago.</p>
<p>But how CBS fares later in the year is another matter. Mr.
Katz of Mabon Nugent said the first-quarter surge "isn't
indicative of a bullish year." He had predicted full-year
earnings of $12.50 a share (vs. $11.51 last year) but now
plans to reduce the forecast. By the fourth quarter, unless
the World Series features teams in large TV markets and runs
for more than four or five games, "they're going to get
hurt," he said.</p>
<p>Peter P. Appert of C.J. Lawrence, Morgan Grenfell Inc. is
more upbeat, predicting that CBS will earn $13 a share this
year. He sees strong ad sales in the second half, despite
worries to the contrary expressed by CBS President Laurence
A. Tisch, and says robust sales can "hide a lot of cost
problems."</p>
