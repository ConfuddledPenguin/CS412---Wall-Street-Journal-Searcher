	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- New government statistics on the condition
of the economy in the second quarter show that it was barely
afloat.
   Nearly every major indicator of private economic activity
declined, the government reported, making it about the
weakest performance in 7 1/2 years of expansion.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Only a buildup of business inventories and a rise in
government spending kept the overall economy from contracting
during the period. Personal consumption, construction,
business investment and exports all declined.</p>
<p>The annual rate of expansion for the second quarter was
1.2% after adjusting for inflation, down from a revised 1.7%
rate in the first quarter, the Commerce Department said. The
numbers were contained in a report on the nation's gross
national product, the market value of all the goods and
services the economy produces.</p>
<p>"I think there's no question that the economy took a
decisive turn for the worse in the second quarter," said
Joseph Carson, senior economist at Chemical Bank in New York.
"I'd say the GNP data no longer hint at a recession but show
one in the making."</p>
<p>Economists generally define a recession as two consecutive
quarters of negative growth. Although the economy has
weakened substantially over the past year, it has yet to have
a negative quarter.</p>
<p>The Bush administration was decidedly more upbeat than
most private analysts in the wake of the latest numbers,
insisting that the economy not only will continue to grow but
will improve markedly in the second half of the year. Noting
that the White House recently forecast 2.2% growth for 1990,
Michael R. Darby, undersecretary of commerce for economic
affairs, said, "We expect a rebound in economic activity in
the second half of the year, especially in the fourth
quarter."</p>
<p>But many economists say the administration's goal will be
nearly impossible to reach. To realize a 2.2% growth rate for
the year, the economy would have to grow at a 2.9% rate in
the second half, a pace not seen since the first quarter of
1989 -- when a rebound in farm production after a devastating
drought pushed growth to a 3.7% annual rate.</p>
<p>"As I look forward, I have a very difficult time trying to
see where we're going to get much growth. It seems the third
and fourth quarters could get dangerously close to recession
territory," said Stephen Slifer, an economist at Shearson
Lehman Brothers in New York. "We don't seem to be getting
much contribution from the consumer. Business investment is
not doing much, government spending is not going to do much.
The only place I see growth is in trade."</p>
<p>A number of economists believe the deterioration in
exports last quarter was an anomaly, as they have been
steadily growing for more than two years. But they also
expect government spending, one of the few sources of growth
last quarter, to slacken substantially later in the year, as
either the Bush administration and Congress agree on a
deficit-reduction package or mandated spending cuts go into
effect.</p>
<p>The administration is hoping that the Federal Reserve will
give the economy a boost by pushing down interest rates, as
it did two weeks ago.</p>
<p>"Monetary policy has recently become more supportive of
increased economic activity," Mr. Darby said at a news
conference after the report was released.</p>
<p>But Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan has twice indicated to
Congress that the central bank's policy makers viewed their
recent move to ease interest rates as a one-time action to
offset tight lending policies by banks.</p>
<p>Still, analysts said, the Fed could be persuaded by a
slowdown in inflation. A price index in the GNP report rose
at a 3.9% annual rate in the second quarter, compared with a
6.6% rate in the first quarter. The central bank has been
keeping credit tight to try to wring inflationary pressures
from the economy. Much of the price deceleration in the
second quarter came in food prices, which soared in the first
quarter after a severe cold wave destroyed crops throughout
the nation.</p>
<p>The second-quarter GNP report will be revised twice in the
next two months as the government collects more data.</p>
<p>The Commerce Department also revised its estimates of
economic growth for each quarter back to 1986. For the most
part, the revised numbers indicated a slower pace of growth
than the old figures.</p>
<p>From the fourth quarter of 1988 to the fourth quarter of
1989, for example, the economy grew 1.8% instead of 2.6% as
previously calculated. In the fourth quarter of 1989, the
economy was particularly unhealthy, growing at a mere 0.3%
annual rate instead of the 1.1% earlier estimated.</p>
<p>All the numbers are adjusted for seasonal fluctuations.</p>

national product expressed in seasonally adjusted annual
rates in billions of constant (1982) dollars:</p>
