	<p class="article-leader">CHICAGO -- GNP Commodities Inc., facing expulsion from the
futures industry, is transferring its customer accounts and
employees to a British futures firm and plans to cease
operation.
   GNP and its chairman, former Chicago Mercantile Exchange
Chairman Brian P. Monieson, were ordered banned from the
industry in May by an administrative law judge at the
Commodity Futures Trading Commission. Though the expulsion is
on hold while he and the firm appeal the ruling to the CFTC
commissioners, some GNP customers had been taking their
business elsewhere and others were uneasy with the situation,
Mr. Monieson said.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The CFTC case against Mr. Monieson and GNP, both accused
of failing to control allegedly renegade commodities
salesmen, could be a watershed in futures regulation. The
CFTC has, in effect, shown that it can put out of business a
powerful industry insider over the alleged wrongdoing of some
brokers working for him.</p>
<p>In recent months, other futures clearing firms have been
reducing or getting out of their so-called introducing broker
sales business because of the fear that they too could be
severely sanctioned for the actions of far-off salesmen. Such
sales offices often operate independently of their clearing
firm.</p>
<p>Dennis Klejna, CFTC enforcement chief, declined to comment
on the case other than to say that the agency will pursue the
expulsions against GNP and Mr. Monieson regardless of the
transfer of business.</p>
<p>The transfer of the accounts and GNP's 110 employees to
E.D.& F. Man International Futures Inc., London, was agreed
to late Thursday night and is to become final this morning,
Mr. Monieson said.</p>
<p>GNP will become an inactive futures clearing firm. Mr.
Monieson said he will devote his time to the appeal of the
expulsion order, and to his personal trading.</p>
<p>He wouldn't disclose terms for the transfer of GNP's
accounts, which included some big institutional traders and
exchange-floor traders as well. None of GNP's liabilities,
which include the CFTC case and some civil litigation against
the firm, was assumed by E.D.& F. Man. Before the CFTC
enforcement case became publicly known, Mr. Monieson had been
close to selling GNP for as much as $40 million.</p>
<p>E.D.& F. Man International is a subsidiary of E.D.& F. Man
Ltd., a closely held trading and money-management firm based
in London.</p>
<p>The CFTC administrative law judge, George H. Painter,
specifically found that, after being warned by other GNP
employees, Mr. Monieson failed to promptly stop some salesmen
from bilking customers. The salesmen, one of them a close
friend of Mr. Monieson, were accused of so-called trade
allocation -- initiating trades without the required customer
account number and then keeping the winning trades for
themselves and stuffing the losers in customer accounts.</p>
<p>The two brokers, Norman Furlett and Ira P. Greenspon, were
also ordered banned from the futures business and fined
$75,000 each. They denied the charges. Mr. Monieson and GNP
were fined $500,000 each. Mr. Monieson denied knowing about
the alleged abuses and said "no firm could survive" the
supervision standard he was being held to.</p>
