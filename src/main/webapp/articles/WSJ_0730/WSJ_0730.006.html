	<p class="article-leader">New York -- Anyone attending the Bolshoi Ballet during its
recently concluded season at the State Theater in Lincoln
Center was assumed to be a potential terrorist. Briefcases,
totes, parcels had to be left in the foyer. Handbags were
allowed inside the auditorium, but only after careful
scrutiny. Ticket holders had to pass through a cordon of
metal detectors. In an era of glasnost, the only possible
explanation for all this is that the company's American
managers were afraid New Yorkers would grow violent when they
saw how bad the Bolshoi has become.
   If so, management underestimated the forbearance of New
Yorkers and overestimated their sophistication. It's true
that after "Ivan the Terrible," the most tedious of the
full-length ballets presented here, somebody booed. By and
large, though, the audience sat dutifully through the
performances until the final curtain, when it put on a show
of enthusiasm -- possibly because people who pay as much as
$105 for orchestra seats need to convince themselves that
they haven't wasted their money.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Unfortunately, they had done just that. So had those who
bought the half-price tickets on sale for some performances.
With the exception of the flashier items in the two slightly
different highlights programs given at the end of the
company's two-week stint, nothing really turned the audience
on. Even the troupe's circusy numbers, which the crowd at
Lincoln Center obviously enjoyed more than anything else,
were short on genuine thrills.</p>
<p>What people were applauding is hard to say. Perhaps simply
a brand name. The Bolshoi of today has none of the virtues
that won the company its world-wide reputation 30 years ago.
The autocratic rule of Yuri Grigorovich, artistic director
and chief choreographer since 1964, has reduced the company
to a level of mediocrity that even undiscriminating audiences
are bound to notice before too long -- especially if, as
seems likely in the present political climate, the troupe
appears here more frequently than in the past. Part of the
company's appeal right now is its relative unfamiliarity.</p>
<p>Truth to tell, the Bolshoi is sadly short of first-rate
dancers. Though she currently is performing in Britain with a
group called, oddly enough, "The Stars of the Bolshoi
Ballet," Natalia Bessmertnova, now 49, has officially retired
from the company. Lyudmila Semenyaka, at 38, is past her
prime. That leaves only Nina Semizorova and Nina Ananiashvili
to sustain the ballerina repertory with the right kind of
authority and technical proficiency. Ms. Semizorova has
superb legs and feet, and is, moreover, a protegee of the
greatest of postwar Soviet dancers, Galina Ulanova. Despite
this advantage, her style is fussy and her deportment
unbearably arch -- she keeps breaking the tension by fixing
the audience with roguish stares.</p>
<p>Ms. Ananiashvili is more talented. While her line is not
as beautiful as Ms. Semizorova's, she has a direct and open
manner that lends her a winning air of spontaneity. As she
showed when appearing as a guest artist with New York City
Ballet in the spring of 1988, she has serious artistic
intentions. Unhappily, like her colleague -- indeed, like
virtually every Soviet dancer of today -- she lacks
musicality. Instead of treating the music as a prime artistic
resource, the determinant of rhythmic buoyancy, of
inflection, of scale, she treats it as an accessory to a
conception already there before the actual dancing starts. In
this attitude, she is seconded by the Bolshoi's conductors,
who adjust tempos and phrasing to the individual requirements
of solo artists, even when that means defying musical logic.</p>
<p>Similarly, in the absorbingly diverse variations that are
the glory of the Grand Pas from Petipa's "Paquita," the four
soloists -- Natalia Arkhipova, Nina Speranskaya, Marina
Nudga, Olga Suvorova -- communicate none of the poetry of
classical ballet, the infinite expressiveness of physical
grace, only its mechanics.</p>
<p>If the women have little to recommend them, the men have
less. Irek Mukhamedov, the most exciting "danseur noble" the
Bolshoi has developed during the past decade, recently
resigned from the company to join the Royal Ballet in London
and therefore was not on view in New York. Aleksei
Fadeyechev, son of Nicholai Fadeyechev, Ms. Ulanova's partner
during the 1950s, has a strong technique and a pantherine
jump that, given his huge size, is thrilling to see. A better
partner for Ms. Ananiashvili than Andris Liepa, with whom she
was previously paired and who has moved to the Kirov, Mr.
Fadeyechev nevertheless is stolid in phrasing and
inexpressive in demeanor.</p>
<p>The rest of the male soloists, whether the unconvincingly
aggressive Yuri Vasyuchenko, the uncertain Mark Peretokin or
the overripe Aleksandr Vetrov, are without distinction.
Though they perform all the old Bolshoi tricks -- grand
jetes, multiple pirouettes, air turns and assembles -- they
lack the strength and artistry to sustain the excitement.</p>
<p>Perhaps one shouldn't blame the dancers. Almost everything
the company performs is the work of Mr. Grigorovich, a
choreographer whose vocabulary is at once impoverished in
means and prosaic in effect. Trapped in works like his "Romeo
and Juliet" and "Ivan the Terrible" -- not to mention his
"Swan Lake," from which he has banished most of the original
choreography and narrative incidents -- the performers
quickly become hobbled. Since he uses the same few steps,
mostly turns, leaps and arabesques, with deadening frequency,
the dancers' technique is sacrificed to tricks, their
artistry to showmanship.</p>
<p>Mr. Grigorovich's baleful effect on the repertoire is seen
not simply in his own works, but in the drabness of the
Bolshoi's interpretations of Petipa and in the lack of
stylistic comprehensibility that marks the company's
"Petroushka," a travesty attributed without sufficient cause
to choreographer Michel Fokine.</p>
<p>The company continues its U.S. tour in Chicago (Aug. 1-5),
Los Angeles (Aug. 719), San Diego (Aug. 21-26), Honolulu
(Aug. 29-Sept. 2) and Boston (Sept. 6-13).</p>
