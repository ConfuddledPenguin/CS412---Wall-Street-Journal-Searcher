	<p class="article-leader">PITTSBURGH -- Kokichi Hagiwara, National Steel Corp.'s new
chairman and chief executive officer, has set a goal as lofty
as Mt. Fuji: turning around the least profitable big
steelmaker in the U.S.
   Soon after NKK Corp., Mr. Hagiwara's parent company,
bought 50% of National Steel from National Intergroup Inc. in
1984, the union soured. National Steel has gone from first in
industry profit margins to dead last. Productivity lags
behind that of competitors, and labor relations have been
anything but cooperative.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>That such a relationship would be so rocky surprised
nearly everyone. Even the toughest U.S. steel competitors
initially blanched at the union of deep-pocketed and
technologically advanced NKK and rock-solid National Steel.
But notes Charles Bradford, an independent steel analyst:
"It's wrong to put the Japanese on a pedestal as industrial
wizards." And late last month, the two parents, NKK and
National Intergroup, essentially split, leaving National
Steel in NKK's custody and Mr. Hagiwara in charge.</p>
<p>The thin and wiry 66-year-old remains undaunted, insisting
that profits will double to $185 million in five years. To do
that, analysts say, he'll have to cut labor costs while also
installing more modern -- and expensive -- equipment. "I
wouldn't look for any short-term turnaround at National
Steel," says Mr. Bradford. "The Japanese plod along, paying
attention to detail."</p>
<p>By the time Mr. Hagiwara arrived at National Steel as
president in 1986, the Japanese-American honeymoon there was
over. National Steel's longtime American president took an
early retirement that year in response to Japan's complaints
about his reluctance to share authority and information. To
make matters worse, National Intergroup said it planned to
sell its share of National Steel by 1990 and devote resources
to its upstart wholesale drug distribution business.</p>
<p>Customers naturally became edgy about the steelmaker's
future, employee morale hit a low, and quality problems
worsened. National Steel's mills had 10 times as many
unexpected shutdowns and rejected 10% to 12% more steel for
impurities than NKK's mills in Japan.</p>
<p>Mr. Hagiwara, considered a top technician at NKK, was
recruited as chief troubleshooter. Unlike his American
counterparts who manage from the top down, the calm and
methodical thinker rarely made moves without consulting
senior managers; he instituted weekly staff meetings and
created a nine-member management committee. Every month, he
visited a different plant -- the plants had previously
operated as autonomous fiefdoms -- to talk about inventory
and product line decisions.</p>
<p>In his visits, Mr. Hagiwara focused on correcting quality
problems. Instead of fixing equipment only when it breaks
down, he stressed preventive maintenance. He tripled the
number of NKK engineers at three mills and says proudly that
by the end of the year, National Steel will be the first
American steel company with 100% of its steel continuously
cast.</p>
<p>There's no question, analysts say, that National Steel has
made progress. Productivity has improved 16% and yield by 6%
since 1984-1985, says President Ronald Doerr. "The company
really made some strides in improving facilities and adding
new lines," says Christopher Plummer, an analyst with WEFA
Group. Moreover, Mr. Plummer says the Japanese connection
will help open doors to Japanese auto makers, who control 28%
of the U.S. automotive market.</p>
<p>But, still the company remains one of the industry's least
profitable. Its competitors -- both minimills and huge
integrated steel plants -- haven't sat still while National
Steel improved, building high-tech plants to make quality
coated steel for auto makers, its biggest customer. In spite
of an annual $200 million capital improvement program, blast
furnaces need repairs and unscheduled maintenance breakdowns
abound. And while the company has one of the industry's most
generous and innovative labor contracts, including a job
security provision restricting layoffs, local unions have
fought against efficiency-boosting job flexibility.</p>
<p>The soft-spoken executive sits back, puffing on a
cigarette, and nods at the litany of continuing problems. "We
are now paying some penalty due to lack of investment and
lack of maintenance during the 1980s," he acknowledges.
Moreover, huge investments take time to reap rewards and he's
a patient man. A statue of a Buddhist priest sits on his desk
as inspiration.</p>
<p>"We're in the middle of a transition period," he says. "We
must find a good balancing point between short-term profits
and long-term viability."</p>
<p>The company is also paying the penalty of a soured
marriage. Decision making was stalled by constant conferring
of two parents with different philosophies and strategies.
Having essentially one ownerNational Intergroup retains a 10%
stakeshould facilitate decision making.</p>
<p>But it may also create problems with xenophobic customers.
Mr. Hagiwara admits NKK was reluctant to boost its stake, in
part, because of potential backlash from Detroit auto makers.
He is expected to keep a low profile, letting Mr. Doerr
represent the company in industrywide issues and pep talks to
workers.</p>
<p>That doesn't mean Mr. Hagiwara hasn't adopted American
ways. He devours American spy novels, his favorite movie is
"Field of Dreams," and, while he speaks haltingly at times
and requires a translator, he insists on speaking English.
And he drives a Lincoln Town Car.</p>
