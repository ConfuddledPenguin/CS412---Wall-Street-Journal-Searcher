	<p class="article-leader">After a six-month trial, a federal jury has convicted six
men -- five of them former employees of the Luxembourg-based
Bank of Credit and Commerce International -- of conspiring to
launder $14 million in proceeds from the sale of cocaine.
   The verdict marked the second stage of a two-part
prosecution of the biggest single-bank, drug-money laundering
case in U.S. history. In January, BCCI pleaded guilty to
money-laundering charges and agreed to pay a $15.3 million
fine.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The defendants found guilty in Tampa, Fla. -- Amjad Awan,
41 years old; Syed Aftab Hussain, 30; Akbar A. Bilgrami, 35;
Sibte Hassan, 31; Ian Howard, 39; and Colombian businessman
Rudolph Armbrecht, age unavailable -- were also convicted of
various individual counts of money laundering, from three in
the case of Mr. Hassan, to 20 each in the cases of Messrs.
Hussain and Bilgrami. The jury acquitted Mr. Hassan of three
charges of money laundering. Mr. Armbrecht is the individual
who didn't work for BCCI.</p>
<p>Conviction on the conspiracy charge carries a maximum
sentence of five years in prison and a $250,000 fine; each of
the money-laundering charges carries a maximum penalty of 20
years imprisonment and a fine of either $500,000 or twice the
value of the property laundered, whichever is greater.</p>
<p>Judge William T. Hodges said a sentencing date will be set
later this week. In the meantime, he ordered that the six men
be held without bail.</p>
<p>The convictions come in the wake of an incident last week
that might well have resulted in a mistrial. After the jury
began deliberations July 18, one juror made at least one
phone call to individuals allegedly connected to the Medellin
drug cartel in Colombia, according to courthouse documents.
The juror obtained the phone numbers from an address book
that federal agents had seized from Mr. Armbrecht and that
the prosecution had entered in evidence.</p>
<p>The incident came to light after the juror mentioned the
call to other members of the jury; the husband of one of the
other jurors later tipped off the Federal Bureau of
Investigation. After a hearing Thursday, Judge Hodges
dismissed the juror and ordered the remaining 11 members of
the jury sequestered to complete their deliberations.</p>
<p>In a prepared statement, U.S. Attorney Robert W. Genzman
said he was "extremely satisfied" with the verdict. Defense
attorneys couldn't be reached for comment.</p>
<p>BCCI released a statement expressing "sympathy to the
families" of the six men, and adding that the crimes were
"contrary to the express, written policies of BCCI" and
occurred without the knowledge of the bank's management or
board.</p>

<p>SECURITIES INDUSTRY prepares to fight Florida arbitration
law.</p>
<p>The industry is gearing up to challenge a Florida law that
gives investors the option of bringing their disputes with
brokers to arbitrators not affiliated with the securities
industry.</p>
<p>Florida is the first state to enact a law that requires
brokers to allow their customers the freedom to take their
disputes to the American Arbitration Association, an
independent forum, or to arbitration panels subsidized by the
industry. AAA president Robert Coulson hailed the law as a
safeguard for the small investor's "right to select."</p>
<p>But a spokesman for the Securities Industry Association
said the trade organization will file a challenge to the law
in federal court by early August. William Fitzpatrick, the
SIA's general counsel, says the Florida law interferes with
brokers' contractual rights and conflicts with the Federal
Arbitration Act. He cites a recent U.S. Supreme Court
decision that the Federal Arbitration Act prohibits states
from singling out securities arbitration agreements for
tighter controls than other business contracts. In that
ruling, the high court knocked down a Massachusetts
regulation similar to Florida's law.</p>
<p>"We feel we can block the Florida law on the same grounds
that we successfully blocked the Massachusetts law," Mr.
Fitzpatrick says.</p>
<p>Mr. Fitzpatrick says the SIA's more than 600 members can
use any arbitration panel to settle disputes. But the
organization is opposed to the government demanding that
brokers write their agreements to provide freedom of choice
for investors, he adds.</p>
<p>It is standard practice for investors opening brokerage
accounts to sign an agreement promising to arbitrate disputes
rather than file lawsuits.</p>
<p>In its ruling early this year, the U.S. Supreme Court let
stand a federal appeals court decision that quashed the
Massachusetts regulation that prohibited securities firms
from requiring customers to sign arbitration agreements.</p>
<p>Increasingly, investors are asking courts or legislators
to give them greater choice in choosing forums for
arbitration with their brokers. Early this month the New York
Court of Appeals, the state's highest court, gave investors
the right to use the American Arbitration Association to
resolve disputes over broker agreements if their contracts
specifically allow for it.</p>
<p>Mr. Fitzpatrick says that at least nine other states had
contemplated a law similar to Massachusetts but backed off
after the regulation was declared unconstitutional. He says
California is in the early stages of considering a bill
similar to Florida's.</p>
<p>George Friedman, a lawyer with the American Arbitration
Association, predicts the Florida law will survive court
scrutiny. He says the Massachusetts plan was a regulation,
not a law, and attempted to limit brokers' rights to insist
on arbitration to resolve customer disputes.</p>

<p>LAW FIRM GETS $750,000 IN FEES in unusual libel case.
Nixon, Hargrave, Devans & Doyle, a Rochester, N.Y., law firm,
collected the money from the unsuccessful plaintiff in a
libel suit against Gannett Co.</p>
<p>The case was filed in 1978 by Hammer DeRoburt, then
president of the tiny Pacific Island nation of Nauru. Mr.
DeRoburt, one of Nauru's founding fathers, claimed that a
Gannett paper, the Pacific Daily News, falsely linked him to
a $675,000 loan to a political faction in the Marshall
Islands.</p>
<p>In 1985 a jury found that the article had been defamatory
but did not constitute actual malice. Mr. DeRoburt was
therefore not entitled to damages. U.S. District Judge Samuel
P. King ruled that Gannett, based in Arlington, Va., was
entitled to legal fees from Mr. DeRoburt. The case was tried
under a combination of English law, which is used by Nauru,
and U.S. law. Under English law a losing party is typically
required to pay the winner's legal fees.</p>
<p>After Mr. DeRoburt unsuccessfully appealed the verdict and
Judge King's decision on the legal fees, the parties settled
on the $750,000 payment. One of Mr. DeRoburt's lawyers,
Thomas N. Charchut of the Santa Monica, Calif., law firm of
Haight, Brown & Bonesteel, called the settlement "a
compromise both sides could live with."</p>
<p>John B. McCrory, of Nixon, Hargrave, said fees billed by
his law firm came to over $1 million.</p>
