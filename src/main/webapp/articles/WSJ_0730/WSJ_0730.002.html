	<p class="article-leader">From the Alan Guttmacher Institute's report "Abortion
Services in the United States, 1987 and 1988," by Stanley K.
Henshaw and Jennifer Van Vort, in the May/June issue of
Family Planning Perspectives:</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The basic trends in abortion service delivery that were
observed in 1985 have continued through 1988. The
concentration of abortion services in specialized abortion
clinics has continued to increase as a result of growth in
the number of such providers and higher caseloads per
provider. Conversely, abortion services in hospitals have
been declining as a result of lower caseloads and
discontinuation of abortion services altogether. The number
of physicians providing small numbers of abortions in their
offices has stabilized, but their average caseload is
smaller. . . .</p>
<p>It is . . . important that physician and hospital services
be available in sparsely populated areas where it is not
economical to establish clinics. The loss of hospital
abortion services has left increasing numbers of women
without any provider in their local areas. It is surprising,
however, that the loss of providers has been limited to
hospitals, considering the problems confronting private
physicians and clinics; anti-abortion harassment and violence
have most often been directed at non-hospital providers. In
addition, private physicians and clinics may have difficulty
in obtaining insurance, paying legal and security expenses,
and stretching income based on fees that have not kept up
with inflation.</p>
<p>The net decrease in the number of hospitals that perform
abortions has had the unfortunate effect of reducing abortion
services in states and counties where they were already
scarce. Extreme inequality of access to such services already
exists, even without new state restrictions that may result
from the decision in Webster v. Reproductive Health Services.
Women in many parts of the country have to travel long
distances to obtain abortions, and those who manage to
overcome such obstacles are likely to have their abortions
later in pregnancy, when the health risks are greater.</p>
