	<p class="article-leader">Dow Chemical Co. said it plans to sell as much as 27.7% of
its Destec Energy Inc. subsidiary in an initial public
offering for as much as $327.8 million.
   Dow Chemical, which intends to keep the remaining shares
of Destec, said the offering will provide a valuation for
Destec and give it access to capital markets as it seeks
opportunities in the independent power generation industry,
which sells power to large utilities. The Midland, Mich.,
company has estimated that Destec's sales will reach $500
million this year and $1 billion by 1995.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission,
Destec said it will issue as many as 17,250,000 shares at a
proposed maximum price of $19 a share. Goldman, Sachs & Co.
is leading the underwriting group.</p>
<p>Dow Chemical formed Destec, based in Houston, in May 1989
by consolidating some of the parent's energy-related assets,
including power-generating facilities not dedicated to Dow's
own factories. Destec expanded last October through the $115
million acquisition of PSE Inc., a Houston-based designer and
operator of energy-cogeneration facilities.</p>
