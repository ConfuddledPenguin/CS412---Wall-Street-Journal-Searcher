	<p class="article-leader">These dog days of late July and early August are intern
time in Washington, that summer sub-season when the Metro
trains and watering holes are choked with peachfuzz
idealists, fresh from the campus and helplessly eager to
please, wide-eyed at the possibility of catching their first
glimpse of Teddy Kennedy or (even) Tom Foley. They are the
federal government's nerds-in-training, the policy wonks of
tomorrow, soon to be initiated into the mysteries of rural
electrification dispersal and urban development no-point
reverse loans.
   Mark Bisnow deserves to be their patron saint. For more
than a decade, from the early '70s to the late '80s, Mr.
Bisnow labored on Capitol Hill as the wonk's wonk: free of
ideology, with a capacity for work that would shame a pack
mule, fiercely protective of his boss's interests and
unendingly loyal until a better job came along. Most
essential, he was incapable of boredom, and it is this gift
above all others that he displays in his memoir, "In the
Shadow of the Dome: Chronicles of a Capitol Hill Aide"
(Morrow, 319 pages, $20.95).</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Mr. Bisnow began his career as an aide to the curiously
named Don Bonker, Honorable Member from Washington, a mostly
forgotten participant in the post-Watergate class of 1974. It
is fitting that Mr. Bisnow entered Congress in the company of
these public servants, for the reforms they instituted --
among others, gutting the seniority system and seeding a
marvelous exfoliation of subcommittees, joint committees and
sub-subcommittees -- led to a diffusion of power that made
policy wonks indispensable to the increasingly impenetrable
machinery of the legislative branch.</p>
<p>At the same time, the post-Watergate reforms effectively
destroyed Congress as an institution capable of serving any
but the most parochial interest, but this seems to bother Mr.
Bisnow not at all. He exploited the era of wonk ascendancy by
bouncing from job to job, following up the Hon. Bonker with
John Heinz, Republican senator from Pennsylvania and classic
congressional meat puppet: handsome as a movie star, rich as
Croesus, and utterly untroubled by thought. Thence to the
presidential wannabe John Andersen, and finally, in the end,
at last, to the big time: Bob Dole.</p>
<p>Any book that climaxes with the appearance of Bob Dole
suffers from serious literary deficiencies. This is partly
Mr. Bisnow's fault: His gentlemanly circumspection tends to
blur all his bosses in a soup of geniality, making each one
as improbably admirable as the boss before him. But mostly it
has to do with the Washington life Mr. Bisnow chronicles.</p>
<p>For the sad truth is that wonk enthusiasm isn't contagious
-- otherwise, of course, everybody would move to Washington
-- and Mr. Bisnow's attempts to give his memoir spirit and
suspense and literary shape are doomed to fail. Why did Sen.
Max Baucus want to bring lamb products under the provisions
of the Meat Import Act? Will the ammonia-fertilizer lobby
succeed in limiting the principle of de facto specificity in
determining the countervailability of traded subsidies?</p>
<p>This is not the stuff of breathless anticipation, but it
captures precisely the tenor of life as we Washingtonians
live it. In our dreams, of course, it is a city of high
drama, of personalities possessing fathomless depth and
fascination, of Georgetown salons humid with world-shaking
badinage.</p>
<p>In our dreams, and in our novels. David Levy's "Potomac
Jungle" (Knightsbridge, 397 pages, $19.95) portrays
Washington as a city in which boredom -- particularly the
kind of meat-and-taters drudgery of wonk life -- is not only
unknown but impossible. There simply isn't time. Mr. Levy's
hero is a wily and handsome vice president who has an affair
with a beautiful network anchor, who later marries the deeply
principled president, whose son is having an affair with the
chief justice's daughter, whose brother is having (yes) an
affair with a Hollywood starlet, who (bringing this chain
full circle) also is having an affair with the handsome and
wily vice president.</p>
<p>For all the panting, remarkably little happens in "Potomac
Jungle" until one of the characters drowns in the Tidal
Basin. A slight flurry of activity ensues, but then things
quickly die down again under the dead hand of Mr. Levy's
narrative technique, which consists almost entirely of
melodramatic cross-cutting among scenes that possess no
intrinsic interest. (The climax of the story occurs while the
central character is watching television.)</p>
<p>Mr. Levy probably hoped that the Washington setting alone
would be sufficient to endow his story with drama and import.
This is the mistake that Mr. Bisnow also makes, but it's an
especially crippling error for Washington novelists, who have
yet to learn that banal dialogue is no less banal for having
been spoken in the Oval Office. All a Washington setting can
do for a novel is render certain events more improbable. Any
Washingtonian knows that a vice president worthy of the
office would much rather huddle with a wonk over the
countervailability of trade subsidies than play
slap-and-tickle with a Hollywood starlet.</p>
<p>It's just the way we are.</p>
