	<p class="article-leader">BRUSSELS -- Sir Leon Brittan, the European Community's
commissioner in charge of competition, is embroiled in a
bitter battle with External Relations Commissioner Frans
Andriessen over the role the commission should play in
policing mergers and acquisitions.
   The dispute is centered on the fate of the Dutch coffee
maker Douwe Egberts N.V. But it has broader implications for
competition policy in the EC single market planned for 1992.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The two commissioners disagree about whether Douwe
Egberts's acquisition of a rival coffee maker in February
1989 gave the company an unfair market position and whether
the company should be forced to divest itself of all or part
of the acquisition. Douwe Egberts is a subsidiary of Sara Lee
Corp., a Chicago-based food and consumer-products company.</p>
<p>Mr. Andriessen argues that Douwe Egberts's market share of
about 67% in the Dutch, Belgian and Luxembourg coffee markets
doesn't endanger competition in the EC and that the
commission shouldn't bother with intervening in such a small
part of the overall EC market.</p>
<p>On Sir Leon's side, however, officials say that by
acquiring Van Nelle Holdings N.V., Douwe Egberts "created a
position which is virtually unassailable." Douwe Egberts's
near-monopoly makes it almost impossible for another company
based elsewhere in the EC to grab a substantial share of the
Benelux market, they argue.</p>
<p>Mr. Andriessen, a Dutchman, has received support from
several other commissioners who also come from the EC's
smaller countries. They argue that companies in the smaller
nations should be allowed to build up sufficient size and
local market share to compete on a communitywide basis.
Commission President Jacques Delors, who currently is siding
with Sir Leon, wants the debate resolved before any decision
is taken on Douwe Egberts.</p>
<p>Some EC officials suggest Mr. Andriessen is taking sides
because of his Dutch nationality, though others dismiss that
suggestion. "He has been taking a very nationalistic stance
on this issue," says one official.</p>
<p>The dispute comes at an awkward time for Sir Leon, less
than two months before the commission's new merger-control
powers come into force. On Sept. 21, the commission will for
the first time have the power to block large anticompetitive
mergers before they happen.</p>
<p>"We're all a bit in a state of confusion now," says a
commission spokesman.</p>
<p>Some lawyers and officials are surprised that Mr.
Andriessen is challenging Sir Leon on the Douwe Egberts
issue. They say that Sir Leon had appeared to have a
clear-cut case.</p>
<p>"I don't think there should be any controversy here," says
Frank Fine, a lawyer with the British firm of Frere
Cholmeley. "It would be a mistake {for the commission} to
drop a case like this where the market share is so strong."</p>
<p>In any case, the dispute sets a bad precedent, lawyers and
EC officials say, because the new merger-control system won't
function if the commission can't stay free of the kind of
political infighting that is happening with Douwe Egberts.
Under the new merger-control rules, the commission will have
to make decisions within tight deadlines.</p>
<p>"It's a rather bad signal at a time when one might expect
that the commissioners would defend a common position in an
area as important" as merger control, says Alain Vanderelst,
a lawyer with the Brussels firm Van Bael & Bellis.</p>
<p>The commission's investigation of Douwe Egberts for "abuse
of dominant position" was officially launched more than a
year ago, in May 1989. Commission officials have been trying
to negotiate an amicable solution with the company, but talks
have broken down. The current dispute means that a decision
probably won't be reached until after the commission's August
holidays, but Sir Leon is expected to press on with the case.</p>
<p>"Brittan is doing his job, showing himself as an enforcer
{of EC competition law} that has to be reckoned with," Mr.
Fine says.</p>
