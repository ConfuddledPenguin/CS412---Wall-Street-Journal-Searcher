	<p class="article-leader">ISTANBUL -- Prices are booming on the Istanbul Stock
Exchange, with the index hitting a record Friday and rising
21% so far this month. Many expect the exchange to become the
world's hottest stock market for the second year in a row.
   Speculators and brokers are delighted with the action on
the trading floor -- and outside in a wide alleyway by the
exchange on a Bosporus quayside, where more than 200
"suitcase traders" do a brisk business from tables piled high
with colorful bearer shares.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"The market is maturing fast," said Henri van't Hoff,
Treasury coordinator at Istanbul's Ottoman Bank, one of many
that has seen an explosive rise in stock exchange business.
"Soon this won't be a big Lisbon but a mini-Milan."</p>
<p>Turkey's stock market capitalization is still only a
fraction of Italy's, but it has overtaken those of European
Community members Portugal and Greece. With Turkish family
companies flocking in for listings, further exponential
growth seems likely.</p>
<p>"We want to see Istanbul develop as a regional financial
center," said the exchange's chairman, Yaman Toruner. "We
want to see a rising index, a bullish market . . . but we
don't think the index can rise forever."</p>
<p>Gunes Taner, the cigar-chomping state minister who
oversees President Turgut Ozal's directives on the economy,
has no such qualms. He has predicted that Turkish stock
prices will quadruple in 1990.</p>
<p>They have already doubled. The Istanbul Stock Exchange
Index closed at 4986.84 Friday, a gain of 53.84 points on the
day -- and a 13% rise for the week. At the end of 1989 the
index stood at 2217.66, and at the end of June it was
4132.98.</p>
<p>A survey by the International Finance Corporation, an arm
of the World Bank, found the Istanbul market rose the fastest
of any emerging market both in 1989 and in the 12 months
ended March 30. An IFC dollar-based index showed the market
soared 333% in the 12 months ended March 30, while the
all-share Istanbul index increased sevenfold in the period.</p>
<p>Renewed foreign buying, stagnant returns in Turkey on
investments in gold, property and bank accounts -- as well as
expectations of high company profits this year -- have stoked
demand for shares, brokers and analysts say. New issues also
have been soaked up by a big widening of share ownership
among Turkey's 56 million people.</p>
<p>While share certificates are being pinned to Turkish
brides' dresses next to the traditional gold coins and bank
bills, simplicity may have its drawbacks. Last month only a
handful of more than 70,000 new shareholders in the
state-owned petrochemical conglomerate Petkim requested that
the selling bank keep custody of their share certificates and
coupons. "The shares are being stashed under the pillow like
gold and cash before them," said the left-wing Cumhuriyet
newspaper.</p>
<p>While individuals still dominate the market, institutional
savings funds are slowly raising their profile. The number of
domestic funds has tripled to more than 60 in the past 12
months. Foreign mutual funds have bought up at least $200
million of shares since foreign-exchange controls were lifted
a year ago.</p>
<p>The government is delighted. After years of promises,
false starts and delays, Turkey's creaking privatization
program is now on track. The state sold more than $400
million of shares to the public in the first six months of
this year. Most of the proceeds will go toward easing
Turkey's chronic budget deficit, officials say. They add that
many more state enterprises will soon go under the hammer.</p>
<p>Turkish businessmen also have caught the fever, even if
they are usually only selling off a first 15% of their
companies. These days, barely a week goes by without an
offering, with many of the issues selling out in days to
foreign funds and through bank branches all over Turkey.</p>
<p>Bankers say they are having to turn away some businessmen
wanting to issue shares, mainly because they want
unrealistically high offer prices. Half of the 15 new offers
this year fell below their issue price in initial weeks,
including key issues like Petkim. This has caused some
Istanbul speculators, if not standard investors, to avoid new
issues.</p>
<p>"I don't buy these new flotations. We want to see their
performance first," said Macit Sekerci, one of the suitcase
traders outside the exchange. Next to his shares on a picnic
table was a notice offering to sell his Mercedes car for
1,250 shares in the popular Eregli Iron & Steel Works.</p>
<p>Mr. Sekerci rents space on the street for the equivalent
of $11 a month from the city, part of the growing regulation
and sophistication of many aspects of the exchange. A smart
wrought-iron sign over a nearby eatery advertises "Le Buffet
de la Bourse" a far cry from the dingy teahouse that was the
center of unofficial trading only months ago.</p>
<p>Exchange Chairman Toruner said a new building and
computerized trading soon will bring an end to this colorful
brokering, in which former teachers, shopkeepers and even
tire repairmen keep in touch with the market on the latest
model mobile phones.</p>
<p>A new capital markets law regulating the market may
finally be passed in the fall, Mr. Toruner added, forcing
independent auditing and a closer watch on rampant insider
dealing at the exchange.</p>
<p>Manipulation already has become more expensive because of
a big rise in trading volume. Official figures show volume
climbed to the equivalent of $2.4 billion in the year's first
six months, 28 times the volume of the year-earlier period.</p>
<p>The number of shares listed on the exchange has risen to
more than 90 from 50 at the start of the year, and market
capitalization has reached more than $22 billion, nearly a
third of Turkey's 1989 gross national product.</p>
<p>Foreign investors have little doubt that there are risks
attached to the Istanbul market, which crashed in August
1987, after which the index steadily fell to lows of around
370 in January 1989 from 1332 at the time of the crash. The
average ratio of current prices to 1989 earnings is 22, well
above the IFC's emerging-markets average of about 17.
Foreigners' trading profits also may be eroded if the Turkish
lira comes under pressure from the country's widening
current-account deficit.</p>
<p>For the brave investor, as for those behind the burgeoning
direct foreign investment in Turkey, the market's potential
is worth such risks.</p>
<p>"Turkey is a platform between East and West, Moslems and
Christians, north and south. It will be a "passage
obligatoire," said Philippe Sardet, president of the Agame
group of European analysts, while visiting Istanbul. "Turkey
will be the Hong Kong of Europe for the next five years."</p>

<p>Friday's Market Activity</p>
<p>Tokyo's Nikkei Index registered its lowest close since May
2.</p>
<p>Bond prices crashed to six-year lows from the opening,
sending stock prices tumbling. The Nikkei Index regained some
strength when bond yields topped out, closing down 506.27
points at 30863.48.</p>
<p>At mid-morning in Tokyo Monday, the Nikkei index had
sagged another 491.36 points to 30372.12.</p>
<p>Friday's volume on the first section was estimated at 450
million shares, up from 342.4 million Thursday. Losing issues
overwhelmed winning issues 800-179, while 148 remained
unchanged.</p>
<p>The Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed in the
first section fell 31.94, or 1.40%, to 2249.26. The second
section index fell 21.20, or 0.48%, to 4363.10.</p>
<p>London shares ended lower as participants showed little
interest.</p>
<p>The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100 Share Index dropped
14 points to 2330.1. The Financial Times 30 Share Index fell
9.4 points to 1842.1. Volume was a skimpy 344.7 million
shares.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, shares closed higher in Stockholm, and lower in
Frankfurt, Paris, Madrid, Amsterdam and Zurich. Shares ended
mixed in Brussels and Milan. South African gold stocks closed
lower.</p>
<p>Stocks ended lower in Sydney, Seoul and Wellington, mixed
in Hong Kong, and higher in Singapore, Taipei and Manila.</p>
<p>Here are price trends on the world's major stock markets,
as calculated by Morgan Stanley Capital International
Perspective, Geneva. To make them directly comparable, each
index is based on the close of 1969 equaling 100. The
percentage change is since year-end.</p>
