	<p class="article-leader">Uniroyal Goodrich Tire Co. said it will increase prices on
private brand tires by 2% to 4.5% effective Sept. 4. Uniroyal
is a unit of Michelin Group of France.
   The move by the Akron, Ohio, company is part of a general
industry increase in list prices of replacement tires. Tire
makers previously announced increases of 2% to 4% on
replacement tires sold under the companies' own brands.
They're following up with an increase in the price of tires
sold to major wholesalers, mass merchandisers and other
concerns that contract with tire makers to produce tires for
them under private brands.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Tire prices have been discounted more than usual this
year, mainly because a slowdown in auto and truck production
forced some tire makers to sell in the replacement market
tires they produced for Detroit. Analysts doubt that tire
producers will collect the full amount of their recently
announced increases, but they do expect some increase in
realized prices.</p>
