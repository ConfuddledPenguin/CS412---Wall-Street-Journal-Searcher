	<p class="article-leader">DEARBORN, Mich. -- Ford Motor Co. is shuffling its North
American auto operations to realign a variety of engine
development, vehicle engineering and manufacturing operations
into three units.
   The moves, which take effect Sept. 1, are aimed at
streamlining Ford's North American automotive operations with
the company investing heavily in a campaign to develop new
vehicles, engines and transmissions, company spokesmen said.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Ford said Max L. Jurosek, 60-year-old vice president, car
product development, will become vice president and general
manager of powertrain operations. Mr. Jurosek will oversee
nearly all Ford's North American engine and transmission
operations, including engine and transmission engineering and
casting operations. Ford is making a major push to develop
new engines and transmissions and bolster one of the weak
spots in the auto maker's product lineup.</p>
<p>Mr. Jurosek will be succeeded as vice president, car
product development, by Kenneth K. Kohrs, 51, vice president,
car programs management and powertrain planning and
engineering. In his new role, Mr. Kohrs will oversee planning
for products as well as a new vehicle engineering operation.
In effect, he will oversee the process of taking a car from a
concept to a working product design.</p>
<p>Ford also is creating a vehicle operations unit that will
combine engineers who design car bodies for manufacture and
the people who design and manage the North American factories
that build the vehicles. The general manager of this new unit
will be Henry A. Nickol, 58, general manager of Ford's
powertrain operations.</p>
<p>Messrs. Jurosek, Kohrs and Nickol will report to Alexander
J. Trotman, executive vice president, North American
automotive operations, Ford said.</p>
