	<p class="article-leader">FRANKFURT, West Germany -- Sales of West German
wholesalers in June declined a real, or price-adjusted, 4%
from a year earlier and 5% in nominal or unadjusted terms,
the Federal Statistics Office said.
   June wholesale sales were valued at 73 billion marks
($44.9 billion). The agency didn't supply comparable
year-earlier figures. The monthly decline was viewed as
surprising because wholesale sales were expected to be buoyed
by the July 1 monetary and economic union of the two
Germanys.</p>

and adjusted terms to 437 billion marks, the statistics
office said.</p>
