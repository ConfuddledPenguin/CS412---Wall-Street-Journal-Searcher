	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Martin Zweig, whose stock market newsletter is
the top performer over the past 10 years, says he is "queasy
about the economy" and nervous about the outlook for stocks.
   Clad in blue jeans, he sits in his office here, surrounded
by a jukebox, traffic light and Cleveland Indians
memorabilia, and offers this prognosis:</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"My guess is that the market will be lower in six months.
I'm surprised that the economy has held up this well. Retail
sales are lousy. The money supply is terrible. And there is
too much debt."</p>
<p>Mr. Zweig is advising subscribers to his widely followed
Zweig Forecast to keep only about 40% of their money in the
stock market. But he isn't bailing out, at least not yet,
saying, "I live in the intermediate term." He says his
philosophy is that "if the market's going to go up 10% and
then down 50%, I want to be bullish, not bearish."</p>
<p>Mr. Zweig excels in a 10-year ranking newly issued by Mark
Hulbert, the de facto official scorer for the investment
newsletter industry. For a decade now, Mr. Hulbert, a former
philosophy student, has been collecting data on the nation's
investment newsletters.</p>
<p>Hundreds of thousands of investors use newsletters to
ferret out promising stocks or decide how much money to risk
in the market. Such advice doesn't come cheap. Most
newsletter subscriptions cost $100 to $500 a year.</p>
<p>Accordingly, investors pay a lot of attention to Mr.
Hulbert's rankings, published in the monthly Hulbert
Financial Digest (annual price: $135). Mr. Zweig's newsletter
has done consistently well. He now manages or helps to manage
$4 billion in pension funds, mutual funds and partnerships.</p>
<p>The accompanying table also lists some other newsletters
that have given their readers a good steer, in various
periods through the end of June. Mr. Hulbert can't track all
of the investment newsletters in this country, which number
several hundred. But he has rated 21 newsletters for the full
10 years, 61 for five years and 100 for the past year.</p>
<p>Asked to name some of his current favorite stocks, Mr.
Zweig sounds almost reluctant. Royal Dutch Petroleum "is OK"
he says, with a multiple, or stock price divided by per-share
earnings, of 11. He says two utilities "screen well" on his
computer: Texas Utilities and Detroit Edison.</p>
<p>He likes Unilever but quickly adds that it's "not cheap"
at 17 times per-share earnings. He recently sold Procter &
Gamble shares because they had reached a multiple of 20 times
earnings.</p>
<p>Mr. Zweig isn't a fanatic on the subject of price-earnings
ratios. He likes stocks with accelerating earnings, which
typically command fairly high multiples. But now, edgy as he
is about the market, Mr. Zweig prefers to play it safe with
lower-multiple stocks that probably won't fall as far if the
market slides.</p>
<p>A week ago, he jettisoned a few issues from his
newsletter's portfolio, bringing the average multiple down to
about 12 from 14. (The average stock in the market these days
sells at a multiple of more than 16 times the past 12 months'
earnings.)</p>
<p>Louis Navellier, the five-year champ in the Hulbert derby,
says he expects the major market averages to "flop around
like a fish out of water" for the next few months. "I'm not
optimistic for the blue-chips," he says. "They don't have the
earnings."</p>
<p>But Mr. Navellier says investors can still win with
carefully selected growth stocks. His computers comb the
market for stocks that move independently of the broad
market, exceed analysts' earnings estimates and have
expanding profit margins.</p>
<p>A few big-company stocks, such as Boeing and P&G, qualify,
he says. But most of his choices are smaller stocks, and many
of them are American depositary receipts of foreign
companies.</p>
<p>One of his favorites is Scitex, based in Israel, which has
a big world-wide market share in commercial color printing
equipment. Rupert Murdoch, the international media baron,
owns about 20% of the shares. And Scitex has the "obscene"
profit margins Mr. Navellier says he loves to see. Earnings
were more than 25% of sales in the past four quarters and
more than 30% in the most recent quarter.</p>
<p>Another pick is SynOptics Communications, traded over the
counter. This Mountain View, Calif., computer networking
company specializes in "high-end," or large and complicated,
systems. Profit margins have expanded to 16.5% from 12.2% in
the past four quarters. "I love that dearly," Mr. Navellier
says. Wall Street analysts, he says, don't pay enough
attention to trends in profit margins, so companies with
improving margins often surprise the Street with favorable
earnings reports.</p>
<p>Medical Technology Stock Letter placed first for the past
12 months. Long-term investors "should be fully invested,"
Jim McCamant, the editor, says, but short-term investors are
reaching a juncture where some sales might be prudent.</p>
<p>He expects a market decline this year "in the 10% to 12%
range" and says he thinks the economy will "continue to flirt
with a recession."</p>
<p>But Mr. McCamant says the medical technology sector "does
well during periods of low economic growth." His three
favorite stocks are basically development-stage companies
that show promise, not profits: Calgene, Davis, Calif.,
genetically modifies plants to produce varieties with
attributes such as low saturated fat, resistance to insects
or high density. Mr. McCamant says the company has "products
proven in the field" in cotton and tomatoes. The tomato
project is a cooperative venture with Campbell Soup, which
wants denser tomatoes that yield more paste or ketchup.</p>
<p>California Biotechnology, based in Mountain View, has a
patent on a nasal delivery system for human growth hormone.
It seeks approval from the Food and Drug Administration for
fibroblast growth factor to heal bedsores and other wounds
and a product intended to improve lung function in infants
born prematurely.</p>
<p>Synergen, Boulder, Colo., also is working with fibroblast
growth factor. In the pipeline is a product intended to
inhibit inflammation, which would help arthritis patients.
And Mr. McCamant says the company has "one of the best
neuroscience programs on chemicals in the brain," funded
mainly by its much larger joint-venture partner, Syntex.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>The stock market crowned a new king last week.</p>
<p>General Electric, fulfilling a long-held dream of its
chairman, Jack Welch, succeeded International Business
Machines as the U.S. company with the biggest market
capitalization, defined as its stock price times the number
of shares outstanding.</p>
<p>At Friday's closing price of 72, GE had a total market
value of $63.98 billion. IBM, which closed at 111 3/8, had a
total market value of $63.85 billion.</p>
<p>GE could lose its crown, of course, if its stock sinks or
IBM's rallies. IBM was displaced as the "market cap" leader
for a few months late last year and early this year by Exxon,
which now ranks No. 3 with a market value of $61.15 billion.</p>
