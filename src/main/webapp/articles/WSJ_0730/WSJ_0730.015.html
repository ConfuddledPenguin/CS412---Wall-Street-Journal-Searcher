	<p class="article-leader">SAN MATEO, Calif. -- Bay View Capital Corp. said it
withdrew a planned offering of $31.3 million of convertible
preferred stock, citing the poor market for
financial-institution stocks.
   Bay View joins a growing list of thrifts who have scrapped
equity offerings because the market wasn't much interested.
Coast Savings Financial Inc. recently gave up on a
$150-million offering of preferred shares for the same
reasons.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The market's disinterest in S&Ls' equity is making it all
the more difficult for the scores of undercapitalized thrifts
to raise equity and meet the new, tougher capital
requirements that took effect in December. Failure to meet
those new standards can lead to regulators' sanctions, which
can include being put out of business. Bay View said it
already meets all of the new thrift-capital requirements.</p>
<p>Separately, Bay View said it adopted a common-stock rights
offering plan to "deter abusive takeover tactics." The thrift
said the plan isn't in response to any specific takeover
threat. Such so-called "poison pill" plans are designed to
discourage unwanted takeover bids by making them much more
expensive.</p>
