	<p class="article-leader">MELVILLE, N.Y. -- Chyron Corp., a maker of electronic
graphics equipment, said its fourth-quarter shipments totaled
about $10 million, compared with a projected $14 million.
   The company blamed the shortfall, in part, on production
problems due to "working capital pressures," as well as soft
market conditions.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The company also said it is continuing to discuss its
financial situation with European American Bank and
Manufacturers Hanover Trust Co. to arrange a restructuring of
bank loans. The company has been in technical default on
certain loans since mid-1989.</p>
