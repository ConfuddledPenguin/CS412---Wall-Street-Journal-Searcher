	<p class="article-leader">PARIS -- France's Socialist government, its hands tied by
President Francois Mitterrand's 1988 election promise not to
privatize any state-owned companies, is planning complex
financial maneuvers to boost the capital of its public-sector
banks and insurers.
   The moves would help gird state-owned groups like Banque
Nationale de Paris and Assurances Generales de France for the
tough competition ahead when Europe drops all internal
barriers to create a single market by the end of 1992.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>But analysts, rival bankers and insurers are wary of the
plans, which they say involve a lot of shuffling of paper and
little in the way of fresh money for the companies.</p>
<p>Two separate plans are currently under review, government
and industry sources said, although nothing is likely to be
formally announced before the end of the summer holidays.</p>
<p>The first plan would allow BNP, one of France's Big Three
retail banks, to improve its capital adequacy ratios by
giving it control, but not ownership, of a 20% stake in Union
des Assurances de Paris, France's biggest insurer and also a
state-owned company.</p>
<p>To achieve this, the state would pool 10% of UAP's shares
in a new holding company alongside BNP's existing 10% in UAP.
BNP would probably take a 51% stake in the new company,
allowing it to consolidate the holdings' earnings and assets
within BNP group accounts.</p>
<p>This would help increase the bank's capital to the levels
required under the internationally agreed Cooke Committee
capital adequacy ratio, without actually giving BNP any new
funds. The Cooke Committee ruling calls for banks' capital to
equal at least 8% of assets by 1993.</p>
<p>Under the plan, UAP also would take control of a 20% stake
in BNP. The two groups agreed to an initial 10% share swap
last year.</p>
<p>French Finance Minister Pierre Beregovoy on Thursday
applauded plans for a BNP/UAP share swap. "It's a good idea,"
he told his weekly press conference.</p>
<p>But criticism was not slow in coming from other quarters.</p>
<p>Jean-Yves Haberer, chairman of BNP's main rival Credit
Lyonnais, itself a state-owned bank, described the proposed
plan as artificial. "It would be something of a caricature if
10 {percent in UAP} could be counted as 20 by an accounting
trick of mirrors," he said earlier last week.</p>
<p>Foreign investors also questioned the moves. Keith Baird,
European banking analyst with Kleinwort Benson Securities in
London, said, "It's certainly clever and the rules do allow
it, but this will definitely be seen by international
investors as a maneuver designed to shore up BNP's capital
adequacy without injecting new capital."</p>
<p>A separate plan is designed to open the way for insurer
AGF to raise new capital from private investors without
diluting the state's current 75% stake.</p>
<p>Under a law passed this year, the state cannot drop its
stake in any of the public sector insurers below this level.</p>
<p>But AGF will need new capital to finance foreign
acquisitions if it is to meet the ambitious growth targets
set last year by AGF Chairman Michel Albert.</p>
<p>The government plans to transfer to AGF minority holdings
in several state-owned industrial companies -- oil group
Total, chemicals group Rhone-Poulenc and metals group
Pechiney -- in exchange for new AGF shares.</p>
<p>This will raise the state's holding in AGF to around 80%
from 75%, giving AGF room to go to market, issuing new shares
to private investors.</p>
<p>An AGF official said last week that the group had to raise
new cash to fund its development plans. "AGF wants to double
its {revenue} by the end of 1993 and raise its foreign
business to about 40% of the total from 27% today. That means
growing internally and by acquisition."</p>
