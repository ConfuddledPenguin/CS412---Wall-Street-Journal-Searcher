	<p class="article-leader">WALTHAM, Mass. -- Thermo Process Systems Inc. said its TPS
Technologies Inc. unit was awarded a contract by Richmond,
Va., to clean up petroleum-contaminated sites in the city.
The value of the contract isn't known, because the amount of
soil to be cleaned hasn't been determined.
   Under the contract, the unit will treat soil from the
city's public works, police and fire departments and other
city-owned sites for as long as five years, Thermo Process
said. "This is probably our biggest cleanup contract to
date," a spokesman said. "It's the first time we've gotten a
contract to clean up a whole city."</p>
