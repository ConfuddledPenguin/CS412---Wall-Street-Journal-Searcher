	<p class="article-leader">Standard & Poor's Corp. and Moody's Investors Service Inc.
each lowered their ratings on debt of McDonnell Douglas
Corp., citing its weakened financial condition and the
troubles it is having with military programs.
   Separately, S&P downgraded debt of General Dynamics Corp.,
reflecting second-quarter charges related to military jobs.
Both aerospace companies are based in St. Louis.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>S&P reduced McDonnell's senior debt to triple-B-plus from
single-A-minus and subordinated debt to triple-B from
triple-B-plus. The rating concern removed the issues from its
CreditWatch list, where it had placed them June 18. The
single-A-2 rating on commercial paper was affirmed.</p>
<p>The McDonnell Douglas Finance Corp. unit's senior debt,
rated single-A-plus, and subordinated debt, rated single-A,
remain on CreditWatch with negative implications. The
single-A-1 commercial paper rating was placed on CreditWatch.</p>
<p>Total debt of McDonnell and the finance unit is about $5.2
billion, S&P said. It didn't say how much of the debt was
affected by its downgrades.</p>
<p>S&P said the reductions reflect potential cost overruns on
the Navy's A-12 attack plane that McDonnell is developing
with General Dynamics and the T-45 Navy trainer jet program.
It noted that McDonnell hasn't taken any charges against
earnings for the potential overruns. Instead, the company is
filing claims against the government for reimbursements it
believes are due on those programs; it included an estimate
of the value of these claims in its second-quarter earnings.
General Dynamics, however, took a $450 million charge in the
second quarter on the delayed A-12 program.</p>
<p>Moody's said it downgraded its ratings on McDonnell's
commercial paper to prime-3 from prime-2, senior debt to
Baa-3 from Baa-1 and subordinated debt to Ba-2 from Baa-2. It
also lowered ratings on the finance unit's senior debt to
Baa-1 from single-A-2; subordinated debt to Baa-3 from
single-A-3; and commercial paper to prime-2 from prime-1.</p>
<p>About $3 billion of long-term debt is affected by the
rating concern's actions.</p>
<p>"McDonnell Douglas Corp.'s financial condition has
weakened significantly, despite several major restructuring
programs designed to significantly improve its cost
structure," Moody's said.</p>
<p>McDonnell said it was "disappointed" by the ratings
reductions. "We don't feel that our company's performance,
financial condition and our future prospects warrant these
measures," a spokeswoman said.</p>
<p>In its action regarding General Dynamics, S&P downgraded
senior debt to singleA from single-A-plus and subordinated
debt to single-A-minus from single-A.</p>
<p>About $610 million of long-term debt is affected.</p>
<p>S&P affirmed its single-A-1 ratings on commercial paper of
the company and its General Dynamics Credit Corp.</p>
<p>S&P said the downgrades reflect the $450 million charge
the company took in the second quarter for the delayed A-12
Navy attack plane and a $50 million charge on the Sincgars
Army radio program. "As a result," S&P said, "financial
parameters will be weaker than previously anticipated."</p>
<p>General Dynamics said of the downgrades, "We expected it,
and it is probably no surprise to the financial community,
either."</p>
<p>In New York Stock Exchange composite trading Friday,
McDonnell shares closed at $42.75, up 12.5 cents, and General
Dynamics shares closed at $27.375, down $2.125.</p>
