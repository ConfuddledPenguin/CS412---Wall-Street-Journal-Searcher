	<p class="article-leader">BASTROP, Texas -- When the Frog went a-courtin', he didn't
risk being squashed flat. But that's what his kissin' cousin,
Bufo Houstonensis, faces here when he feels amorous.
   Now safe sex may be only a hop, skip and a jump away for
this rare and endangered species, otherwise known as Houston
Toads. And it's all because of a bunch of humans who set out
to save some trees.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>But we're leaping ahead of our story.</p>
<p>It seems that at mating time, these lovesick toads seek
the seductive surroundings of local ponds; and that, sadly,
can mean having to cross State Highway 21.</p>
<p>For a long time, few people here cared about the toads'
risky love life. But last fall, after a rash of accidents
involving cars and trees, the state highway department
proposed cutting down 700 to 1,000 loblolly pines along a
stretch of Highway 21. Soon 50 or 60 angry Bastrop County
residents were hopping on buses to Austin, the state capital,
to protest.</p>
<p>Although they got the highway department to ax its plan,
the protesters were still suspicious. "Finally we just had to
use this toad thing on them, otherwise they would have done
whatever they wanted," claims Don A. Fries, organizer of
Bastrop's Save the Pines Committee.</p>
<p>The "toad thing" led to an $18,500 Texas Parks and
Wildlife Department study that turned up six hopping and 12
squashed toads on the highway and concluded that the state
had to do something for the federally protected species.</p>
<p>The answer: Along with an auto guardrail, the state should
install 28,000 feet of concave, 16-inch-high plastic
"toadrail" to keep the creatures off the roadway, and provide
underground "toad tunnels" to ensure alternate access to
breeding grounds. (Such tunnels can be found in England, but
these just might become America's first toad-tunnels of
love.)</p>
<p>Now the state is awaiting federal approval of one of two
plans, both of which call for the felling of only 105 trees.</p>
<p>Andrew H. Price, the state zoologist who wrote the toad
rescue plan, is happy. "There are a number of people who like
toads, including myself," he says. Bastrop residents are
glad, too, because their beloved trees are out of the woods.</p>
<p>But even now, few here seem sure what a Houston Toad looks
like. "I don't know how they can tell one squashed toad from
another. I've never talked to anybody who's ever seen a
Houston Toad live," confesses Bastrop Mayor David Lock.</p>
