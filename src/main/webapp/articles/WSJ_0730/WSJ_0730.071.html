	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- President Bush endorsed a plan for Nippon
Sanso K.K. to acquire Semi-Gas Systems Inc., the leading U.S.
producer of high-purity gas systems, with certain conditions
for protecting sensitive, semiconductor research.
   Mr. Bush acted on the recommendation of an eight-agency
panel that examines the national-security implications of
foreign purchases of U.S. firms. The sale has yet to be
cleared by the Justice Department, which investigates
antitrust matters. Nippon Sanso already commands a major
share of the global market for gas distribution systems used
for semiconductor manufacturing.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>An administration official said Nippon Sanso will be
required to isolate itself from the work being performed by
five Semi-Gas technicians at Sematech, a U.S.-financed
consortium established to help the U.S. industry catch up
with Japanese semiconductor technology. These technicians
will report to a separate corporation governed by a board
made up of U.S. citizens, including one to be nominated by
Sematech.</p>
<p>A voting trust will be set up to separate Nippon Sanso
from the Sematech operation, and Semi-Gas will be required to
provide a secure area for the protection of Sematech
documents, the U.S. official said. The plan also calls for
sanctions against the Japanese acquirer if it violates these
security precautions.</p>
<p>Mr. Bush acted in the face of strong objections by House
Majority Leader Richard Gephardt and other House Democrats.
In a letter sent to the president, the lawmakers claimed that
the sale, along with earlier acquisitions, would reduce the
share of U.S.-owned, high-purity gas producers in the U.S.
market to 20% from about 72% in 1988.</p>
<p>Sematech had appealed to the White House to delay its
decision so that Semi-Gas executives could try to raise
enough money to match Nippon Sanso's bid to buy the firm from
its parent company, Hercules Inc., Wilmington, Del. A
Sematech spokesman said the Semi-Gas group's bid was $5
million less than Nippon Sanso's $23 million offer.</p>
