	<p class="article-leader">MILAN -- Montedison S.p.A and Ferruzzi Agricola
Finanziaria S.p.A., two companies controlled by Ferruzzi
Finanziaria S.p.A., announced plans to merge into a holding
company, controlling all the agro-industrial and chemical
interests of Italy's Ferruzzi group.
   The company, to be named Montedison S.p.A., will have
annual sales of about 35 trillion lire ($29.5 million).</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>As a precondition of the merger, Ferruzzi Agricola will
raise the value of its shares to 1,000 lire from 800 lire.</p>
<p>The company will also arrange a three-for-seven bonus
issue for all categories of its stock. It will then merge and
incorporate Montedison through a share swap, offering seven
shares of Ferruzzi Agricola Finanziaria for every 10 shares
of Montedison.</p>
<p>Ferruzzi Agricola said that, thanks to the bonus issue,
the effective share-swap ratio is 10 Ferruzzi Agricola shares
for every 10 Montedison shares. No cash is involved in the
transaction.</p>
<p>The new company, to be based in Milan, should make it
easier for investors to evaluate Ferruzzi's business and help
it raise money on international markets.</p>
<p>Ferruzzi said that the deal would benefit Ferruzzi
Agricola shareholders because it would strengthen the
company's assets. For Montedison shareholders, the merger
means the agro-industrial company Erizania S.p.A. will become
part of the enlarged group.</p>
