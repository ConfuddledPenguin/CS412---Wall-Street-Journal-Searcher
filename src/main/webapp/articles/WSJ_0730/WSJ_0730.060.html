	<p class="article-leader">PHOENIX, Ariz. -- Pinnacle West Capital Corp. cut the
quarterly dividends it takes from its Arizona Public Service
unit to $42.5 million from $52.7 million, in an effort to
help shore up the finances of the utility unit.
   The action comes one month after Pinnacle West, burdened
by heavy debt, unveiled a plan to reduce sharply capital
outlays and operating expenditures at Arizona Public Service.
Pinnacle West has said it plans to pay about $600 million of
debt by year-end 1993, with $200 million of that to be paid
this year. At March 31, Pinnacle West had $1.13 billion of
its own long-term debt; the consolidated total, including
debt of the utility, was $3.53 billion.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"I think it was prudent to do it, particularly with the
reduced earnings levels at APS," Richard Snell, Pinnacle
West's chairman and chief executive officer, said of the
dividend cut. "At some point, it allows APS to start reducing
some of its own debt." Last year, the utility unit paid more
to the parent company than it earned, "and it appears the
situation would have been the same this year," a company
spokesman added.</p>
<p>The dividend cut means that Pinnacle West will now receive
only $170 million annually from Arizona Public Service
instead of the previous $211 million a year. Still, the
utility holding company insists the cut will have little
impact on its debt repayment efforts. Pinnacle West plans to
make up the difference with proceeds from the pending $38
million sale of its Malapai Resources Co. uranium mining
unit, plus positive cash flow from its SunCor Development Co.
and Eldorado Investment Co. units. Since March, Pinnacle West
has paid down about $115 million of its debt.</p>
<p>"In developing a schedule for debt repayment, we
anticipated lower dividends from APS," Mr. Snell said. "For
that reason, we do not plan to reduce the rate of our debt
repayments, nor will the dividend reduction impact our
projections of increased equity in the company or our hope of
restoring a dividend to Pinnacle West shareholders by
year-end 1993." Pinnacle West suspended its 40-cent-a-share
common stock dividend in October in the face of mounting
losses from its MeraBank thrift unit, which was seized by
federal regulators in January.</p>
<p>Separately, Pinnacle West's board voted to eliminate the
annual $10,000 cash retainer paid to each board member.
Instead, directors will receive options to buy 3,500 Pinnacle
West common shares for $16.25 each, the market price as of
July 2. The company said it expects to pay directors with
stock options through mid-1993.</p>
<p>PacifiCorp, Portland, Ore., which has made an unsolicited
$1.82 billion takeover offer for Pinnacle West, didn't have
any comment on Pinnacle West's actions.</p>
