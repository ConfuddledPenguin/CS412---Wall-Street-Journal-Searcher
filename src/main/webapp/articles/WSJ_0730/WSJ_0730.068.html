	<p class="article-leader">CHICAGO -- The collapse of Stotler & Co., one of the
country's largest futures brokerage firms, might have been
prevented if regulators had challenged a questionable
inter-company funds transfer that Stotler reported at least
four months ago, futures industry officials say.
   The months of inaction by the Commodity Futures Trading
Commission and the Chicago Board of Trade are more surprising
as both contend they had been closely monitoring Stotler's
financial health for more than a year because of concerns
about its thin capital base and rapid growth.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>A senior CFTC staff member conceded in an interview that
the federal regulator should have known in March about an
unusual inter-company transfer of $13.4 million between
Stotler and its parent, Stotler Group Inc. When the agency
apparently did disallow all but $500,000 of the transfer in
mid-July, it triggered the chain of events that quickly
forced Stotler from the futures business last week for lack
of capital.</p>
<p>"Maybe we should've found it sooner, I don't know," the
CFTC staffer said.</p>
<p>In the CFTC's defense, the staffer noted that the transfer
"related to an obscure portion of their financial
statements."</p>
<p>Stotler disclosed the $13.4 million transfer of assets and
liabilities, including short-term bank loans, under the
heading "Other Transactions with Affiliates" on page eight of
the company's 1989 audited financial statements sent to the
CFTC in late March. The transfer is also noted in a glossy
pamphlet highlighting its finances that Stotler sent
customers. Stotler officials have refused to comment on the
firm's financial condition beyond brief prepared statements.</p>
<p>The fall of Stotler, whose chairman, Karsten "Cash"
Mahlmann, is also chairman of the Board of Trade, is likely
to strengthen calls on Capitol Hill for tougher regulation of
the futures industry. Futures regulators have been under fire
for their lax oversight since early last year, when a federal
undercover probe of futures trading run by the U.S.
Attorney's office led to indictments of 48 individuals on
charges of stealing from customers.</p>
<p>In addition, it was an audit of Stotler & Co. by the
Securities and Exchange Commission that raised questions
about the funds transfer and that attracted the attention of
the CFTC and the Board of Trade, regulators said. The CFTC
and the SEC have been locked in a jurisdictional battle over
the regulation of stock-index futures and their impact on
stock-market volatility.</p>
<p>The SEC has been especially alert to transfers between a
trading unit and its corporate parent since such
eleventh-hour capital shifts speeded the collapse of Drexel
Burnham Lambert Inc. earlier this year, regulators said.</p>
<p>Mr. Mahlmann may be pressured to relinquish the exchange
chairmanship by Board of Trade members. Many of them
speculate privately that the exchange didn't move earlier
against Stotler out of deference to its influential chairman.</p>
<p>"Why didn't we know about this? Why didn't we do anything
about this?" asked an exchange director. Mr. Mahlmann hasn't
returned calls for comment.</p>
<p>Exchange directors aren't the only ones who have been kept
in the dark about Stotler's problems. Last week Stotler
Group's three outside directors, who weren't involved in the
management of the company, resigned as directors. They
decided to quit after being excluded from any discussions
with management in recent weeks as the troubled company
scrambled to keep afloat, said one of the directors, who
asked not to be named.</p>
<p>"All we know is what we read in the papers," the director
said. The outside directors are John Dolkart, a Chicago
attorney, Timothy Mather, a Colorado businessman and Fausto
Solano Pereira, the head of a Brazilian company that is in a
joint venture with a Stotler unit. None of the three could be
reached for comment.</p>
<p>In defense of their own regulatory actions, Board of Trade
officials note that the exchange had fined Stotler several
times for temporary violations of capital rules. Partly
because of these problems, the company had been filing
monthly reports on its financial condition to the CFTC for
more than a year.</p>
<p>The CFTC staffer said regulators were also monitoring
Stotler's poor earnings performance and Stotler Group's
reliance on $11 million in short-term commercial paper to
finance its growth.</p>
<p>Regulators won't say what specifically led the SEC to
examine Stotler & Co.'s books, or what attracted its
attention to the $13.4 million funds transfer. Included in
the transfer was an undisclosed amount of short-term bank
loans for which Stotler & Co. remained liable if they
couldn't be paid by the parent. The finding was shared with
the CFTC, which has regulatory authority over the futures
brokerage firm.</p>
<p>On July 10 the CFTC told Stotler that, with the transfer
unwound, it wasn't meeting industry minimum capital
requirements. The Board of Trade delivered the same message
shortly thereafter.</p>
<p>Futures industry regulations require firms that clear and
guarantee customer trades to maintain a capital cushion equal
to at least 4% of customer-segregated funds, or be forced out
of the business. Restrictions begin to be put on a company's
activities when its capital falls to 7% of customer funds.</p>
<p>Stotler disputed the regulatory treatment of its capital
and prepared two reports showing its reading of its capital
position vs. that of the regulators. The reports, dated July
13, show that according to Stotler, it had net capital of
$20.6 million, or $9.5 million more than its minimum
requirements, at the end of May.</p>
<p>But the report compiled after regulators removed $12.9
million of the $13.4 million funds transfer from Stotler &
Co's readily available capital category showed the firm with
just $7.7 million in capital, or $3.4 million less than its
regulatory minimum.</p>
<p>After a last-ditch effort to line up a capital infusion of
$10 million from a Taiwanese investor fell through last week,
Stotler Group said it was pulling out of the futures
brokerage business and had defaulted on $750,000 in
short-term commercial paper obligations. The company
indicated it may not be able to make $7.6 million in debt
payments due in 30 days without refinancing the debt or
selling assets.</p>
<p>No Stotler & Co. customers have lost money as a result of
its financial difficulties, the company said. In a frantic
attempt to shift accounts off its books and thereby reduce
the capital cushion it needed to support those accounts,
Stotler by last week had transferred two-thirds of its
accounts, or nearly $200 million in customer funds, to other
brokerage firms. The effort was too little, too late, and
Stotler said it would have to exit the futures brokerage
business. The rest of the accounts are expected to be
transferred within days.</p>
