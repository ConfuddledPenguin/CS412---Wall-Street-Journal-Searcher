	<p class="article-leader">RICHARDSON, Texas -- Micrografx Inc. is "real comfortable"
with analysts' estimates that it will report net income of
$430,000, or 11 cents a share, for its first quarter, ended
June 30, said J. Paul Grayson, chairman.
   Micrografx, which designs and sells personal computer
graphics software, had profit of $270,000, or seven cents a
share, a year earlier. Analysts expect sales to reach $5
million in this quarter, compared with $3.9 million in the
1989 period. The earnings report will be the first since
Micrografx went public June 19.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Mr. Grayson said Micrografx owes its success to Microsoft
Corp.'s successful Windows 3.0 -- a graphics package that put
a friendlier face on the Microsoft's ubiquitous MS-DOS
personal computer operating system. Mr. Grayson and his
brother George, Micrografx's president, were among the first
to design software based on Windows. That was in 1985, when
the Microsoft package was scorned as a pale imitation of
Apple Computer Corp. graphics.</p>
<p>Now, WorkGroup Technologies, a Hampton, N.H., market
research company, expects Microsoft to ship 1.8 million
copies of Windows by year's end. "A year ago it was starting
to look like we were geniuses," Mr. Grayson joked. "This year
people decided we could predict the future."</p>
<p>As users shop for software compatible with Windows, said
David Bayer, an analyst with Montgomery Securities in San
Francisco, "the strongest single-product category next year
will be Windows application software."</p>
<p>Micrografx cut staff and overhead as its annual sales
growth fell from 100% to 60% in fiscal 1990, ended March 31,
and its margins tightened. Analysts forecast fiscal 1991
sales growth of about 60%.</p>
<p>Even so, investors enthusiastically embraced the company's
initial public offering. Underwriters estimated an offering
price of $11 to $13, but the stock opened at $16 a share and
traded up to its present level of around $23.</p>
