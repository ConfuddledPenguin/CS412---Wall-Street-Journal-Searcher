	<p class="article-leader">Congress is treating the defense budget as if this is
1928. That's the year the world outlawed war.
   Senator Sam Nunn, putative heir to Scoop Jackson, has cut
President Bush's $307 billion fiscal 1991 budget request by
$18 billion, murdered the Milstar communications satellite,
and intends to kill strategic defense. Les Aspin, ringmaster
at the House Armed Services circus, wants to raise the cuts
to $24 billion. He's also now signed up with the strategic
tag team of Ron Dellums (D., Calif.) and John Kasich (R.,
Ohio) to kill the B-2 Stealth bomber.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Clearly, the 1980s defense buildup accomplished its
purpose and we can now afford to spend less. Defense
Secretary Dick Cheney's budget would gradually cut defense by
2% a year to a 4% share of the economy by 1995 -- the lowest
share in 50 years. Yet Congress wants a free fall.</p>
<p>Someone ought to take a moment to notice that while the
Soviets are in retreat in Eastern Europe they retain troops
there. Even more to the point, their undiminished strategic
arsenal still represents the principal threat to U.S.
security. Meanwhile, the Soviet Union is in an increasingly
revolutionary situtation, with great promise but also the
risk of finding its own Bonaparte. And even if all goes well
with the Soviets, someone should look at a map of the Persian
Gulf, where the U.S. Navy went on alert after Iraq's Saddam
Hussein moved 30,000 troops to the Kuwait border, threatening
a new war in the Achilles heel of Western interests.</p>
<p>But Congress is putting its own priorities on display. Its
supposed military masterminds, Rep. Aspin and Sen. Nunn, are
threatening precisely the programs best suited to the most
likely threat in the year 2000. To take military action
against some future Saddam Hussein, or to hold the kind of
plausible threat that might deter him, you would ask
precisely for an invisible long-range bomber, and for a
shield to protect the U.S. from the small force of
intercontinental ballistic missiles he may by then possess.</p>
<p>The B-2 was designed as a strategic nuclear-armed bomber,
and it does instantly degrade the Soviets' $350 billion air
defense system. But it's even better as a weapon for the
post-Cold War era. It can project power as far as 10,000
miles (with one refueling), a critical need as U.S. bases
fold up overseas and aircraft carriers become scarcer and
more vulnerable. Unlike cruise missiles, the B-2 is reusable.
Because it's difficult for radar to detect, it can perform a
mission with minimal losses. In its Libyan raid, the U.S.
lost two crewmen who probably would have survived in stealth
aircraft; how many future pilots will Congress vote to kill
this week?</p>
<p>Mr. Aspin says we'd never use so expensive a weapon
against a Libya, though the F-111s we did use cost $36
million apiece and one was lost. The U.S. also used B-52s in
Vietnam. It's true the B-2 is absurdly expensive ($63 billion
for 75 planes), but $35 billion already has been spent on
R&D. Mr. Aspin would throw that investment down the sinkhole.</p>
<p>Mr. Nunn promises to try to keep the B-2, but he hopes to
kill SDI. He plans to support an amendment that would gut
spending for Brilliant Pebbles, the promising little gizmos
that might one day intercept missiles in space. This would
foreclose any chance of deploying a space defense in the
1990s, though the CIA says 15 countries will have ballistic
missiles by the year 2000. Brilliant Pebbles also might
function as "brilliant eyes," satellites that would help all
kinds of U.S. weaponry on the ground and at sea. In any case,
the Soviets continue to roll out SS-24 and SS-25 nuclear
missiles -- targeted at the U.S. The current political
movement in the Soviet Union is in large part a result of the
challenge represented by SDI and stealth technologies, and
this is precisely where the U.S. could keep a technological
edge in the future.</p>
<p>Lest we be unfair, Congressmen will vote to continue one
kind of defense spending. In killing Brilliant Pebbles,
Senator Nunn would earmark much of the remaining SDI money to
projects in Alabama and New Mexico, the home of colleagues
Richard Shelby and Jeff Bingaman. Last January Mr. Cheney
proposed closing 35 military bases and reducing forces at 20
more, but Mr. Aspin and colleague Pat Schroeder are resisting
like Texans at the Alamo. Strategy may go, but pork remains.
The Cold War may be over, but taxpayers will never know.</p>
<p>President Bush gave a thoughtful speech the other day
about the need for "peacetime engagement" with the world, an
engagement that requires military strength. But with Congress
bent on irresponsibility, the commander in chief is going to
have to decide if he was elected to preside over American
disarmament.</p>
