	<p class="article-leader">In reply to Prof. Donald A. Coffin's interesting
mathematical dissertation (Letters, June 22) on the sale of
Renoir's "Au Moulin de la Galette" (Leisure & Arts article,
May 24), no consideration was given to the value of the
pleasure the owner enjoyed for the many years of ownership of
this great painting.
   While this cannot be expressed monetarily, it is obvious
to many collectors that the sheer joy of living with this
great work would be a reward in itself.</p>
