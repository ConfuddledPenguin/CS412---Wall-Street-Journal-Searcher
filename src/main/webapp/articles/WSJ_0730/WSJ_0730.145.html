	<p class="article-leader">So you think you've got problems? Compare yourself with
the unfortunate folks at the Resolution Trust Corp., and
you're bound to feel better. Their task, which might have
made even Mr. Phelps of "Mission Impossible" flinch, is to
dispose of the $15 billion (rising eventually to about $100
billion) of properties that have fallen into the government's
hands from failed savings and loans.
   The RTC finds itself walking a tightrope. It would like to
move quickly to shrink the huge number of unsold properties
hanging over the real-estate market and feeding an atmosphere
of uncertainty -- especially in areas such as Texas where its
holdings are concentrated. At the same time, however, the
agency is trying to avoid selling so fast and cheap as to
trigger a real-estate recession.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The Wall Street Journal sought the advice of real-estate
specialists, marketers and other interested parties around
the country on how the RTC should approach its dilemma. Their
suggestions follow.</p>
<p>MOVE THE GOODS FAST</p>
<p>"The only answer" is for the government to sell the real
estate as quickly as possible, says Minneapolis investor
Irwin Jacobs. "The problem is there, and we've got to get rid
of it. It won't get better with age."</p>
<p>Mr. Jacobs suggests a sealed auction, with uniform bidding
rules throughout the country. "They have got quality pieces
of property out there, and they have got to create a basic
format for selling." At present, he says, prospective buyers
face a plethora of confusing rules and requirements.</p>
<p>The government's concern that some buyers will profit too
heavily is "just foolishness," he says. Even if a buyer isn't
willing to pay what the government wants, it is still wiser
to get the real estate "in stronger hands" than to let it sit
idle. Then, he says, the government can at least begin to
collect taxes on the property, and real-estate prices in
depressed areas "will begin to level off."</p>
<p>PROCEED WITH CAUTION</p>
<p>The government would save billions of dollars by
consolidating all the properties and hiring professional
managers to operate them and sell them off over time, says
Gerald Barton, president, chairman and chief executive of
Landmark Land Co., a Carmel, Calif., savings and loan holding
company that has managed 21 failed thrifts for the government
over the past several years.</p>
<p>"What they {should} do is put it all together, cut it up
into manageable pieces, and hire the best person to manage
and sell them in an orderly fashion. I would take all the
{government-owned} apartments in Houston and hire the best
apartment manager in Houston to manage and sell them. You're
looking at an enormous increase in loss in liquidating over
managing the thing out.</p>
<p>"You can't treat government real estate any differently
from how you treat personal real estate. What does a well-run
bank do when it forecloses? Does it immediately put it up for
sale? No, they hold on. You want to shine the apple before
you sell it."</p>
<p>`CREATE A MYSTIQUE'</p>
<p>"The RTC has two basic problems -- they want to sell as
quickly as they can, and they haven't created an image of
desirability," says David Liederman, founder of David's
Cookies. "The feds are going 180 degrees in the wrong
direction. This reeks of a fire sale."</p>
<p>Mr. Liederman cites an apartment building in Manhattan
where he says units are going for about one-fifth of their
original asking price. "If I controlled the sale, I'd
definitely hold the properties and have an orderly sale," he
says. He would price units at perhaps 80% of their original
price "and tell people what a bargain they were getting in
such a fine building.</p>
<p>"I'd try to create an aura of once-in-a-lifetime bargains.
I'd create a mystique of desirability for these properties."</p>
<p>PUBLICIZE APPRAISALS</p>
<p>"They've got a real dilemma," says George Mitchell,
chairman and president of Mitchell Energy & Development
Corp., which handles oil, gas and real estate. "If they push
too hard, they could jeopardize the recovery in some parts of
the country.</p>
<p>"They ought to screen through the private investors first,
then package what's left and {quickly sell} it. I would
publicize various sites and what they think they have as
appraisals. A lot of people would step up to pay 80% or 90%
of appraised value if they knew exactly what they were. . . .
They should let people pick {the properties} over, get some
really good deals, then increase the velocity gradually." At
Mitchell Energy, "we've already bought property" from the
RTC.
</p>
<p>DEVELOP COMPUTER PROFILES</p>
<p>"The government has to identify all of the property it
owns and develop profiles to be placed in a computer data
base," says entrepreneur H. Ross Perot. "A real-estate agent
or investor sitting down at a computer terminal would be
limited only by his own creativity. The government should
also go into these markets with brochures and booklets and
say, `OK, fellows, here's what we have, here's the price and
here it is on a map.'</p>
<p>"Congress should change the tax laws just for these
properties so buyers can go back to the old depreciation
schedules and the old rules for deducting losses. There
should be a clear understanding that the rules change as soon
as we clear out the backlog. This way, we create an incentive
to act now. Finally, the government should create an
environment that allows banks to lend money for the
acquisition of real estate. These must be prudent loans
requiring the buyer to put in significant capital."</p>
<p>TARGET FOREIGN BUYERS</p>
<p>"I think we need to show some real creative marketing,"
says Michael L. McNair, the top salesman for nine of the past
10 years at Hi-Fi Buys, his Atlanta home-electronics chain.
"We can advertise in foreign newspapers and get some foreign
investors in here. Tell them: `You can take advantage of this
and invest in the U.S.A.' We could possibly turn this to our
advantage, and take some of those dollars that are flowing
out of the U.S. and bring them back."</p>
<p>GIVE TAXPAYERS A BREAK</p>
<p>"This is a case in which there is a clear implication that
the taxpayers' money has been wasted in scandalous fashion,"
says Carl Spielvogel, chairman and chief executive officer of
advertising agency Backer Spielvogel Bates Worldwide Inc. "My
approach would be that this property should be put up for
public auction to be available to those people -- taxpayers
in this country -- who suffered because of the unbusinesslike
practices of the people who got this country into this mess.</p>
<p>"I would advertise these properties in a way that the
information becomes readily available to people. I would
suggest using a media like C-Span for that purpose and say
that at 8 at night in a given region we will show you
property that is going to be available in this dispersal
program."</p>
<p>CALL ON INSTITUTIONAL BUYERS</p>
<p>"They aren't marketing the properties to substantial
buyers," Eli Broad, chairman and chief executive of Broad
Inc., a Los Angeles-based financial services firm with assets
of $10 billion, and founder and chairman of Kaufman & Broad
Home Corp. "They treat everyone the same. They came out with
these huge lists and big books they're very proud of. If I
were running it, I would go out and call on the senior
management of institutions that have the ability to write
checks. They aren't doing that.</p>
<p>"The people who have the real resources to buy the
properties, like we do and others, don't want the hassle of
dealing with the bureaucracy and the red tape. I would make
sure I had people that were dealing with the largest, most
substantial buyers on a service-oriented, quick-answer
basis."</p>
<p>TAKE TIME TO DO GOOD DEALS</p>
<p>"One thing I would not do is panic and sell it all in an
auction overnight," says Douglas Danforth, chairman of the
Pittsburgh Pirates and retired chairman of Westinghouse
Electric Corp. Doing so, he says, would mean not getting the
best value for the property. An auction "is an instant sale
and not the best sale. If you take the time to work out
selling the property, often you get good value for it."</p>
<p>`BUY OF A LIFETIME'</p>
<p>"If I were in charge of all that real estate," says
comedian Phyllis Diller, "I would check into a sanitarium."</p>
<p>Assuming she had to take the job, Ms. Diller says, "I
would advertise in all the major Japanese newspapers. That
way they could siphon off some of the money into
out-of-the-way places instead of buying any more landmarks."</p>
<p>Her ads would say, "Buy of a lifetime] Take advantage of
America's goof] This is a great advantage for you] We goofed
and we're caught]" Of course, she adds, "they might see
through that."</p>
<p>Johnny Carson, longtime host of "The Tonight Show," says,
"I would put them up for sale on the Home Shopping Network.
That audience will buy anything."</p>
<p>`STOP TIPTOEING AROUND'</p>
<p>"I think I'd probably sell {the properties} two-for-one,
sell them fast, get the money, and go on down the road," says
Jim McIngvale, owner of Gallery Furniture in Houston. "When
you've got a loser, the best thing you can do is to get rid
of it as fast as possible. Otherwise, all it does is continue
the mess. I'd just have a giant auction and sell them off.</p>
<p>"We should put an end to all this regulation and these
thousands of people. The whole thing is a mess; they ought to
admit it and stop tiptoeing around."</p>
<p>There's nothing wrong with selling for low prices, Mr.
McIngvale says. "They're losing money every month keeping
those things. If I've got a bad piece of furniture, I sell it
at a fire-sale price and get something I can make some money
on. How can they say {a property is} worth something when all
it's ever done is hemorrhage money? A piece of property may
be worth $1 million in the year 2000, but it's worth $100
now, so lose it."</p>
<p>ENSURE MARKET PRICES
</p>
<p>"We would get the property into the hands of
private-sector real-estate professionals who have the
experience necessary to assemble packages of properties . . .
by product type, by geographical market, and in $10 million
to $50 million blocks {to} be sold at public auction," says
Gerald D. Hines, chairman of Hines Holdings Inc., a big
developer based in Houston. "Only by selling at auction will
the public be assured that actual market price was obtained.
The bidding process circumvents the fiction of appraised
value.</p>
<p>"Once it becomes public that the government will be
putting the property in the hands of private-sector
professionals, Wall Street will package blocks for smaller
investors, and larger investors will bid against Wall
Street."</p>
<p>Mr. Hines adds that it ought to be done quickly. "The
effect of having this much inventory is already being felt."</p>
<p>LEND THE POOR A HAND</p>
<p>"They ought to be making a lot of that housing available
for low-income people," says James Rouse, chairman of
Enterprise Development Co. and the Enterprise Foundation,
which raises funds and provides consulting for affordable
housing. Under the act that established the RTC, he says, "a
preference was to be given to nonprofit corporations working
with low-income people. They were authorized to finance the
sale of that property by taking back mortgages and to give a
discount on their appraisals in order to facilitate housing
for low-income people.</p>
<p>"It was evident to Congress and the country to use this
disastrous situation to help house low-income people, not by
slashing prices, but in an orderly way. There are a lot of
nonprofits ready to buy the properties and, if necessary,
establish an organization to do the marketing. But I don't
think that will be necessary."</p>
<p>Overall, he says, the RTC must sell the properties "in a
responsible and orderly fashion that respects the fact that
they have within their hands the possibility of causing
tremendous damage to the financial strength of banks,
insurance companies and other financial institutions."</p>
<p>SHRINK THE RTC'S ROLE</p>
<p>"It's just like used cars," says Tony Meredith, a salesman
at Gene Evans Ford Inc. and one of the top three Ford
salespeople in Atlanta. "You shouldn't try to sell {all the
real estate} at once -- you just flood the market. It might
take you longer to recoup your money, but at least the
property is there to help you {recoup}. Anything will sell if
you give it time.</p>
<p>"I'd give all the property to real-estate companies and
let them try to sell it. That would probably bring in more
money. Anytime the government gets involved, you end up
losing money."</p>
<p>LEAVE IT TO THE PROS</p>
<p>"The government should catalog the properties, do whatever
cosmetic upgrading is necessary to prepare them for market
and supervise the sale, but should leave the actual marketing
and sale in the hands of professional real-estate people,"
says Sheldon Good, chairman of Sheldon Good & Co., one of the
nation's largest real-estate auction firms. If the government
insists on administering the sales itself, as it is doing
now, "it will take 35 years to get all these properties
sold," he says.</p>
<p>Mr. Good scoffs at the provision allowing community groups
working with low-income people first crack at acquiring some
properties. "These properties could sit there for five years
while they decide who gets them. In the meantime, who will be
paying taxes on them? That's the kind of thing you get when
the government gets into the real-estate business."</p>
<p>The government seems to be worried that investors might
get too good of a buy. "Congress seems to have the attitude
that if you buy one of these properties for a certain price
and sell it for a $50,000 profit two years later, there's
something wrong with that. But nobody is going to buy real
estate unless they think it's a good buy."</p>
