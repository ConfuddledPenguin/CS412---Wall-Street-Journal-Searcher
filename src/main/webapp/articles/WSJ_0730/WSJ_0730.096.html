	<p class="article-leader">Qintex Entertainment Inc. said it reached a $4 million
settlement involving the film company's officers and
directors, their insurer and shareholders in a class-action
suit brought following Qintex's Chapter 11 bankruptcy-law
filing last October.
   Under terms of the settlement, the insurance company will
deposit $4 million for payment of claims, and plaintiffs will
release all claims against Qintex and its officers and
directors. The Beverly Hills, Calif., company, which said its
officers and directors deny any liability or wrongdoing, said
they reached the agreement to avoid the expense and time of
protracted legal proceedings.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The settlement agreement is contingent upon court
approval. Under Chapter 11 bankruptcy, a company is protected
by the court from its creditors while it works out a plan to
pay off its debt.</p>
