	<p class="article-leader">Shell Oil Co. reported that second-quarter earnings fell
63% to $161 million from $440 million a year earlier.
   Revenue declined to $5.17 billion from $5.87 billion.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Shell said a major factor in the profit decline was a
decision to write off some of the investment in certain oil
and gas properties offshore California because of continuing
delays in securing development permits.</p>
<p>Shell Oil, a subsidiary of the Royal Dutch/Shell Group,
said the write-offs applying to offshore California and the
Beaufort Sea amounted to $76 million. The benefit of a tax
adjustment applicable to prior years partly offset the
write-offs, the company said.</p>
<p>The company also attributed the earnings decline to lower
production volumes. Crude oil prices were significantly lower
in the second quarter but slightly improved in the first
half.</p>
