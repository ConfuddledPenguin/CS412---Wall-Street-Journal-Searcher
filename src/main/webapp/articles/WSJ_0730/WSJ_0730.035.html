	<p class="article-leader">CARLETONVILLE, South Africa -- The metal door clangs shut
and the huge iron cage, packed with miners, begins a journey
to the center of the Earth.
   Down and down it plummets into the Western Deep gold mine,
slicing through the dark at 30 miles per hour. Ears pop. Air
rushes by. After a mile and a half, the cage shimmies to a
stop. The door clangs open and the miners step out into a
honeycomb of damp and narrow tunnels. Surely, if there is one
place where Anglo American Corp., South Africa's mining
colossus and corporate anti-apartheid crusader, can take
refuge from the hurricane of change buffeting its empire
above, this is it.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>But even here, at the bottom of one of the deepest holes
in the world, there is no escape. "Viva ANC," proclaims a
splash of red grafitti spray-painted on a jagged rock wall by
a miner hailing the African National Congress, the recently
unbanned black liberation movement. Elsewhere, someone has
painted "AWB," the initials of the Afrikaner
Weerstandsbeweging, a white supremacist group.</p>
<p>"Politics has no place down here," growls Humphrey Hobday,
the mine manager at Western Deep's south shaft. His work
these days is consumed by efforts to keep the political
emotions of his miners from clashing underground. He switches
on the lamp attached to his hard hat and crawls down a tunnel
to where a team of miners -- black and white, ANC and AWB --
are blasting away at a vein of gold. The shift boss reports
they are approaching a monthly production record. Mr. Hobday
beams; business, for now, prevails.</p>
<p>"The survival of the industry should be more important
than any political beliefs," he says. "We can't afford to be
saving the country down here."</p>
<p>Here is an irony richer than any chunk of gold: Anglo
American, which has sought to save South Africa from
apartheid, is now hunkering down to save itself. For many
years, Anglo and other South African corporations went beyond
the usual realm of business, challenging the government to
scrap racial segregation and white minority rule in favor of
power sharing with the black majority. Now that the
government has moved boldly in this direction by unbanning
the ANC, the Communist Party and other groups and by engaging
them in negotiations, the company that so ardently promoted
change is scrambling to protect itself from the fallout.</p>
<p>At its mines and factories, Anglo is wrestling to contain
the heightened political tensions of a polarized work force;
already, several clashes between white and black miners have
disrupted gold production in the Orange Free State. And in
the board room, Anglo is circling the wagons against threats
from the newly legal political organizations to nationalize
or break up the company as a means of dismantling the greater
white economic monopoly. In the new politics of correcting
the inequities of apartheid, Anglo is the fattened calf.</p>
<p>"Anglo reflects the concentration of economic power within
a minority of a white minority," says Tito Mboweni, an ANC
economist. "Clearly, a future government will have to deal
with this."</p>
<p>Anglo towers over the South African economy from the top
of a pyramid of interlocking corporate holdings. With an
asset base exceeding $14 billion, Anglo controls at least
one-third of the total capitalization of the Johannesburg
Stock Exchange. In addition to being the world's largest gold
producer, Anglo is a partner in the diamond cartel with its
cousin, De Beers Consolidated Mines Ltd., which showed its
reach last week by signing a $5 billion deal to market the
Soviet Union's diamonds. Anglo is also involved in breweries
and banks, cars and chemicals, steel and sugar, wine and
watermelon.</p>
<p>At the pyramid's pinnacle is an all-white, all-male
executive committee -- they call themselves a "band of
brothers" -- that operates from a squat three-story building
in downtown Johannesburg known simply as 44 Main Street.</p>
<p>Anglo always reckoned that it would have the most to gain
from an economy freed from segregation: An end to apartheid
would end South Africa's isolation and allow Anglo to give
rein to its ambitions to expand abroad. But, in the perilous
transition to a post-apartheid economy, Anglo may also have
the most to lose.</p>
<p>Anglo has been a symbol of dominance ever since Ernest
Oppenheimer opened for business in 1917. While the
pro-government Afrikaans press caricatured Mr. Oppenheimer as
the cigar-chomping "Hoggenheimer" out to subvert
Afrikanerdom, the left-wing press portrayed Anglo as the
bowler-hatted robber barons of apartheid, prospering from
cheap black labor. In the 1960s, the ruling Afrikaners, wary
of Anglo's increasing financial power, even discussed
nationalizing the gold mines. Anglo nipped that threat by
spinning off one of its mining holdings to Afrikaner control.</p>
<p>But the clamor today is different. The ANC and others
aren't talking about a few crumbs but about an economic
restructuring to match the political overhaul currently in
progress. While Anglo, along with most of the business
community, agrees with the need to redistribute wealth, it is
having trouble coming up with ways to let go. Having spun an
elaborate web of possession and control, the spider now seems
to be caught in its own design.</p>
<p>"We can't make ourselves smaller," says Julian Ogilvie
Thompson, Anglo's chairman. Vulnerability hangs with the
cigar smoke in his regally appointed office. Exasperation
taints his Oxford accent. "I mean, that isn't going to make
sense. Any company has got to grow to stay alive."</p>
<p>He talks about the virtues of capitalism and its triumph
over socialism. He notes the misery in the rest of Africa,
aggravated by Marxism and mismanagement. He cites Anglo's
anti-apartheid credentials: the main donor to white, liberal
opposition politics, the first company to recognize black
unions, the huge spending -- now more than $20 million a year
-- on black education, training and housing.</p>
<p>But in a country where many blacks equate capitalism with
apartheid -- and both with Anglo American -- this isn't
enough. What more, Mr. Thompson wonders, can a company do
without sacrificing its business? "I'm afraid we have no
quick fix," he says. He beseeches a visitor: "Have you some
ideas?"</p>
<p>Such groping is rare at 44 Main. When he founded Anglo
(partly with capital from Newmont Mining and the J.P. Morgan
bank in the U.S., hence the "American" in Anglo American),
Ernest Oppenheimer created not just a mining company but a
mining finance house, with all the capital and technical
skills he needed assembled under one roof. Soon, he was
acquiring diamond concessions to go with the gold and
parlaying these holdings into a world-wide cartel of diamond
producers that would regulate the gem's marketing and,
ultimately, its price.</p>
<p>Since mining needed a certain amount of civil engineering
and building, Mr. Oppenheimer founded what has become one of
the country's major construction groups; likewise, mining's
need for explosives prompted him to create a chemicals
company, today the country's largest. As mining brought the
industrial revolution to South Africa, Anglo pushed into
steel and paper. And what it didn't start, it bought --
interests in insurance, banking, property, publishing,
retailing and auto manufacturing. With little competition,
Anglo just kept growing as the country itself grew into the
most developed in Africa.</p>
<p>"Our policy," says former Anglo Chairman Gavin Relly, "is
based on making things happen and not waiting for them to
happen to us."</p>
<p>This philosophy -- possession begets control, control
begets stability -- is reflected in Anglo's vast holdings,
which for the fiscal year ended March 31 produced net income
of about $720 million; the retained earnings of its
associated companies raises that profit to above $1.2
billion. At the core is a dizzying circle of cross-holdings
among Anglo, De Beers and Anglo American Investment Trust
(Anamint), which protects the trio from hostile takeover:
Anglo owns 7% of De Beers, which owns 38% of Anglo; Anglo
owns 52% of Anamint, which owns 26% of De Beers, which owns
10% of Anamint. Behind this web lies the influence of
81-year-old Harry Oppenheimer, Ernest's son, who controls the
family's 8% stake in Anglo.</p>
<p>From this circle of control spins the financing to sustain
chains that reach far into the country's economy. For
example: Anglo holds 40% in mining house Johannesburg
Consolidated Investments Ltd. (JCI), which holds 37% of
publisher Argus Group Ltd., which holds 38% of another
publisher, Times Media Ltd.; for good measure, Anglo directly
holds 15% of Argus, and JCI has a direct 27% stake in Times
Media. In the end, Anglo effectively controls the country's
two main English-language publishing houses and most of the
English-language newspapers.</p>
<p>Anglo executives have been exploring ways to untangle this
web, but mining analysts say inertia has set in. In 1987,
Anglo initiated an employee share ownership plan, but so far
it involves less than 1% of issued shares. Partnerships with
black entrepreneurs on supply contracts are in their infancy;
management buy-outs or spinning off companies to employees
apparently aren't being considered.</p>
<p>"The people at the top just aren't thinking radically
enough," says Duncan Innes, a professor of industrial
sociology at Johannesburg's University of the Witwatersrand.
"And in South Africa today, you have to think radically."</p>
<p>Instead, Anglo has turned conservative. "I don't think
this is the time to come out with great undertakings one way
or the other," says Mr. Relly, who is still an Anglo
director. Sitting beside Nelson Mandela at a press conference
following a recent meeting between the ANC and business
leaders, Mr. Relly testily said he wouldn't join in any
"fatuous" discussions about the breakup of Anglo.</p>
<p>Not fatuous to everyone. Having studied economics in
Lesotho and England during his 10 years in exile, the ANC's
Mr. Mboweni now works behind a second-hand desk surrounded by
peeling wallpaper in a downtown Johannesburg office. Bigness,
he argues, concentrates investment decisions in too few hands
-- almost all of them white -- and stifles competition as
well as black economic empowerment.</p>
<p>"Just look at this. It's like a giant octopus," he says,
waving a chart of Anglo's corporate holdings. He picks up a
pen, and, like a surgeon making an incision, draws a big X
over the line linking Anglo to First National Bank of South
Africa and another X over the line to Southern Life
Association, a big insurer. Slicing off these operations, he
says, should take care of Anglo's reach over the finance
industry.</p>
<p>The ANC calls this "clipping the wings" of the
conglomerates. At the moment, says Mr. Mboweni, the ANC
favors antitrust legislation, rather than nationalization, to
do the clipping. "The conglomerates reflect the nature of our
society," he says. "What good is breaking up the whites'
political monopoly if the economic monopoly remains?"</p>
<p>Mr. Relly cringes at such logic; he has tried hard to
change it. In 1985, he led a small delegation of businessmen
to the ANC's exile headquarters in Lusaka, Zambia, for the
first-ever talks between the two groups. Since then, Anglo
officials have met regularly with ANC members around the
world. One even visited Mr. Mandela in prison. And when Mr.
Mandela was released in February after 27 years in jail, Mr.
Relly was the first prominent white businessman to stop by
his home.</p>
<p>Still, the image of Anglo as a robber baron persists in
the minds of many ANC officials and black South Africans.
"One of the things one has come to understand is the
enormously long lead time which is necessary to change these
fundamental attitudes," Mr. Relly says. "All you can say is
that we're trying."</p>
<p>So, the once-secretive company is pinning its salvation on
communication. Rather than restructuring itself, Anglo hopes
to restructure its corporate image.</p>
<p>In the mines, Anglo is trying to repair its image with the
National Union of Mineworkers, a staunch ANC ally and Anglo's
chief adversary during a miners' strike in 1987. Mr. Hobday,
the mine manager at Western Deeps, has initiated a series of
sensitivity seminars, a first in the macho mining industry.
Every day, a different group of 50 black miners gets a chance
to speak their minds with management. Asked to list five
areas of discrimination in the mines, the miners usually come
up with 10 or more. Topping the list one day is: "When we get
into the cages (elevators) with whites we are called
`kaffirs.'" Kaffir is the equivalent of "nigger."</p>
<p>Though the program is only a few weeks old, miner Mtatale
Mamokheli notices a little improvement underground. "The
supervisors are being more accommodating," he says, a light
shining from his hard-hat. "Before, we weren't looked upon as
being people."</p>
<p>Back at 44 Main, there is talk of shaping a "national
attitude" where big isn't necessarily seen as bad. "We'll
have to go on pressing ahead, persuading people that we're
fair and constructive to employees," says Mr. Thompson.</p>
<p>Communication is key, he says. Later, in an office down
the hall, the telephone rings. It is the ANC's Mr. Mboweni.
He has read in the newspapers that Anglo's annual report is
out. Can he have a copy?</p>
<p>Certainly, he is told, it will be on his desk soon. Hand
delivered.</p>
