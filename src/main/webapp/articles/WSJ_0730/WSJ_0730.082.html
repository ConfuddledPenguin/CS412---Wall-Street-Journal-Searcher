	<p class="article-leader">Landsing Pacific Fund said its board adopted a stock
rights offering plan, in part to "prevent abusive takeover
tactics."
   Landsing, a Menlo Park, Calif., real estate investment
trust, said the so-called poison pill plan wasn't in response
to any specific takeover effort, but acknowledged that it
recently received "an unfinanced expression of interest" in a
possibile acquisition.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Landsing didn't elaborate and didn't disclose the
interested party; however, a group including Independent
Holdings Inc. said in June that it raised its stake in
Landsing to 6.25% and that it might seek to enter discussions
with management over the direction of the company. The rights
offering would make any unwanted takeover bid much more
expensive. Independent Holdings couldn't be reached to
comment.</p>
<p>In American Stock Exchange trading Friday, Landsing closed
at $8.125, unchanged.</p>
