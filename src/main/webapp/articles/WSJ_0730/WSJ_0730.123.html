	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- On issues affecting business and consumers,
Judge David Souter's court decisions have been classically
conservative -- reluctant to expand business liability and
deferential to state regulatory officials.
   But in his nearly seven years on the New Hampshire Supreme
Court, Judge Souter -- President Bush's U.S. Supreme Court
nominee -- had little or no experience with some of the major
business issues being raised at the state level: regulation
of securities, antitrust enforcement, and limits on punitive
damage awards.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Many of the business-related rulings among Judge Souter's
221 New Hampshire Supreme Court decisions involve disputes of
a type that are rarely if ever decided by the U.S. Supreme
Court. Many involve disputes over contracts, local tax
assessments and zoning. A handful of his rulings written for
the five-member court, however, shed some light on his
approach.</p>
<p>One apparent theme is an unwillingness to create theories
of liability for businesses or to recognize new rights to sue
for damages.</p>
<p>In a 1986 decision written by Judge Souter, the court
refused to impose the toughest standard of liability on a
local developer in Grantham, N.H., for contaminating the land
and groundwater of a homeowner with gasoline and grease that
leaked from a storage tank. The homeowner argued that the
developer's action was so hazardous that the developer should
be liable even if there wasn't any evidence of negligence.
But Judge Souter rejected the argument as imposing too tough
a standard.</p>
<p>And in a medical malpractice decision in 1987, Judge
Souter threw out a lawsuit against a hospital in Dover, N.H.
The lawsuit, filed by a woman who suffered nerve damage in
her arm when a blood sample was taken, charged that the
hospital failed to train the technician properly or to
provide a proper chair for the patient. Judge Souter said the
patient didn't prove any fault by the hospital.</p>
<p>Bruce Fein, a Washington lawyer and conservative
columnist, says these and other cases show a reluctance by
Judge Souter to impose liability based on what Mr. Fein calls
"some avant-garde, or stretching, theory of law." But, Mr.
Fein says, Judge Souter's record is too thin "to reach any
conclusions about a pronounced approach in the area of
business law."</p>
<p>Robert Viles, dean of Franklin Pierce Law Center in
Concord, N.H., agrees there isn't much evidence from which to
evaluate the record. But on business cases, he says, Judge
Souter "has his own mind and sometimes applies it to come up
with a rather unusual analysis of the law."</p>
<p>Judge Souter doesn't shy away from finding violations of
the constitution -- the state constitution, that is -- but he
is loathe to find new constitutional rights. In 1985, he
ruled that the state's meal tax was unconstitutional because
operators of vending machines that sold candy and soda were
required to pay the tax, while proprietors of supermarkets
who sold the same items on their shelves were exempt.</p>
<p>But in a 1986 case, Judge Souter ruled that a group of
homeowners in Conway, N.H., didn't have the right to sue for
damages over alleged discrimination in violation of the state
constitution. The homeowners alleged that local officials
refused to build roads for them, in part because they were
only seasonal residents. Allowing the lawsuit, Judge Souter
wrote, "would inevitably lead to the conversion of every road
dispute into a constitutional . . . action."</p>
<p>The 50-year-old Judge Souter's business decisions
occasionally display a bit of a conservative judicial
philosophy -- one that sees a limited role for the courts.
When the court in 1985 struck down a contract that Laconia,
N.H., had awarded after receiving bids, Judge Souter wrote a
lone dissent. The court, he noted, concluded that the ruling
might benefit the city by improving the bidding system. "I
can only say that the public has the power to obtain that
benefit by statute or city ordinance," he wrote.</p>
<p>In numerous decisions, Judge Souter's opinions called for
deference to state regulatory agencies or government
officials responsible for making decisions. One example was a
1985 ruling upholding the state utility commission's setting
of tolls for a privately owned bridge across the Connecticut
River between Charlestown, N.H., and Springfield, Vt.</p>
<p>And his decisions contain some discussion of the role of
precedent. In a 1987 dissent, he chastised the court for
abandoning a state banking law precedent in a 3-2 vote in
which one lower court judge temporarily took the place of one
of the justices who had been disqualified from the case. He
disagreed with the ruling and questioned its value as a
precedent because it had the support of only two justices.</p>
<p>As with other aspects of Judge Souter's record, however,
there may be more uncertainties than answers. Alan Slobodin
of the Washington Legal Foundation, a conservative
public-interest firm, says he viewed retiring Justice William
Brennan as an ally in ruling that the First Amendment
protects advertising and other "commercial" speech and in
expressing concerns about too much jury discretion in
awarding punitive damages. "Brennan was a very important vote
for us on those issues, and we don't know about Souter," he
said.</p>
