	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Liz Claiborne Inc. will raise its standard
discount to stores on its shipments of women's apparel in a
move calculated to earn the good will of department store
retailers -- and additional market share.
   Liz Claiborne, already the dominant women's wear resource
in most of the nation's department stores, said it will
increase the discount to 10% from 8% to "help our retail
partners overcome some of the increased costs of business . .
. in a way that does not increase prices to consumers." The
company said it will absorb the additional discount through
cost cutting and the anticipated gains in market share.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The discount will apply to spring shipments that will
arrive in stores later this year. It affects about 70% of Liz
Claiborne's total business and excludes men's apparel,
cosmetics and accessories.</p>
<p>As a rule, apparel makers give retailers an 8% discount on
merchandise providing that bills are paid within the first 10
days of the month following delivery.</p>
<p>Deborah Bronston, an apparel analyst at Prudential-Bache
Securities Inc., estimated the discount will cost Liz
Claiborne about $25 million in annual earnings. But Ms.
Bronston stressed that because the company will absorb most
of the additional expense through cost cutting, "they can do
this without impacting their earnings while looking like a
greater hero to their retail customers."</p>
<p>Industry experts generally praised the move, predicting
that it will give the apparel maker a competitive edge. The
discount "will be the shoehorn that will insure a very smooth
cash flow, because they know they will now get paid first,"
said Alan Millstein, a New York retail industry consultant.</p>
<p>But industry experts believe that few of Liz Claiborne's
rivals will follow suit. On Friday, Bernard Chaus Inc. and
Leslie Fay Cos. said that they wouldn't match the discount.
Many small and medium-sized apparel makers, which are already
under pressure from retailers that consistently dispute their
bills and pay them late, are even less likely to match the
discount.</p>
<p>"There aren't a helluva lot of resources who can afford to
do this," said Lee Abraham, chairman of Associated
Merchandising Corp., a New York buying office and consultant
for many department stores.</p>
<p>The big department store chains, which have been plagued
by eroding profit margins as retail sales remain sluggish,
also reacted enthusiastically to the news.</p>
<p>"I'm certain this type of opportunity for our company will
cause us to buy more from Liz Claiborne," said James
Zimmerman, president and chief operating officer of Federated
Department Stores Inc. and Allied Stores Corp., which have
been operating under Chapter 11 bankruptcy law protection
since last January. David C. Farrell, chairman of May
Department Stores, termed the decision "excellent" and "very
constructive."</p>
