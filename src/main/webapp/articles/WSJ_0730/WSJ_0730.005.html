	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- Interstate truckers and bus drivers would be
barred from using radar detectors under federal rules
proposed in a more than $28 billion Senate transportation
bill incorporating major increases in funding for the
Northeast rail corridor in fiscal 1991.
   The Transportation Department would retain discretion to
draft the proposed rules, but the spending measure virtually
dictates that the ban take effect within a year unless
Transportation Secretary Samuel Skinner determines that the
prohibition wouldn't improve highway safety.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Radar detectors already are prohibited by a few states,
including Connecticut and Virginia. But the proposed federal
ban would be far more sweeping and would apply to all drivers
of commercial motor vehicles. The proposed rules would take
the form of amendments to federal motor carrier regulations,
and violators would be subject to civil fines or criminal
penalties, according to a legislative report filed by the
Senate Appropriations Committee.</p>
<p>The underlying measure, approved by the full committee
last week, rejects proposed cuts in rail and mass transit and
represents a nearly 5% increase from the Bush
administration's transportation budget for the fiscal year
beginning Oct. 1. While trimming the larger House-passed
bill, New York and New Jersey senators added almost $150
million for the Northeast rail corridor, and the total
figure, $165 million, represents a more than sixfold increase
in current aid.</p>
<p>Coast Guard acquisition and construction accounts would be
increased by $40.4 million from the House-passed level. And
while cutting the projects of House lawmakers, senators
salted away hundreds of millions for endeavors of their own.
More than $160 million -- none of which was in the
administration's budget -- was secured for highways backed by
Senate Appropriations Committee Chairman Robert Byrd (D.,
W.Va.).</p>
<p>The proposed Coast Guard budget relies on the transfer of
$300 million from the Pentagon, and the military's fights
over weapon contracts can spill over into Coast Guard
decisions on buying its equipment.</p>
<p>General Motors Corp.'s Allison Gas Turbine division and
Turbomeca Engine Corp., a Texas unit of Labinal Corp. of
France, have a competing interest in building replacement
engines for the Coast Guard's HH-65 Dolphin helicopter, for
example. The dispute is driven partly by Allison's stake in
the development of its T-800 engine for the Army's costly new
light helicopter.</p>
