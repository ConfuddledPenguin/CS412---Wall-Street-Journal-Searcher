	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- To highlight the true size of the budget
deficit, the government shouldn't count the growing Social
Security surplus in deficit-reduction targets, a federal
advisory panel said.
   The panel, the Advisory Council on Social Security, also
warned against reducing Social Security taxes as the surplus
builds.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The Social Security surplus is expected to be about $63
billion in the fiscal year ending Sept. 30. Excluding this
surplus from budget calculations would increase this year's
deficit to about $224 billion from the current estimate of
$161.3 billion and intensify the difficulty of balancing the
budget.</p>
<p>"The council believes that the growing Social Security
reserves shouldn't routinely be used simply to offset large
operating deficits in the rest of the federal budget," the
panel said in an interim report. The secretary of Health and
Human Services appoints such a council every four years to
review the soundness of the Social Security and Medicare
trust funds.</p>
<p>The panel said it's appropriate for the Social Security
trust fund to be building a surplus in anticipation of the
retirement of the large baby-boom generation starting around
2010. It cautioned against reducing the current payroll tax
rate of 6.2%, which is paid both by workers and employers on
income of up to $51,300 this year, as suggested by Sen.
Daniel Patrick Moynihan (D., N.Y.).</p>
<p>The council said the long-term health of the Social
Security system depends on boosting the nation's
productivity, or output per hour worked. The nation should
strive to eliminate the budget deficit -- and ultimately to
run a budget surplus -- to boost savings and investment, the
foundation of higher productivity, the advisory council
recommended.</p>
<p>This long-term goal is widely shared, although successive
Congresses and presidents haven't yet shown the political
will to achieve it. However, the current budget summit is
likely to take the Social Security surplus out of the deficit
calculations.</p>
<p>Negotiators at the budget summit talks, meanwhile,
continued to be more preoccupied with partisan maneuvering
and tactics than with reaching a deficit-reduction
compromise. Republicans -- stung by publicity and criticism
surrounding a draft deficit-reduction plan they haven't
offered to Democrats yet -- are now threatening to block the
start of the congressional recess unless Democrats put
forward a proposal next week, congressional aides said.</p>
<p>Democrats haven't decided how to respond yet. But
negotiators said any plan they put forward at this stage is
likely to rely more on deep cuts in defense spending than on
cuts in benefit programs and also will call for increasing
taxes on upper-income taxpayers. One possibility being
considered by Democrats is to impose a new tax on luxury
items.</p>
<p>As previously reported, the draft Republican plan would
raise taxes on beer, wine and liquor and limit the deduction
for state and local income taxes to $10,000; it also would
cut defense spending about $7 billion and reduce spending on
government benefits programs $16 billion. Republican aides
cautioned that the plan may change before it is formally
offered.</p>
<p>President Bush is expected to meet again today with top
congressional leaders. The timetable for the budget talks is
likely be the main item on the agenda. Democrats last week
proposed to call the summit negotiators back early from the
August recess to try to complete a package, but the White
House rejected that. One possibility that both Republicans
and Democrats are discussing is for the entire Congress to
vote on firm deadlines for the budget negotiators before
leaving town -- perhaps in the resolution that begins the
recess.</p>
