	<p class="article-leader">BETHPAGE, N.Y. -- Grumman Corp.'s second-quarter earnings
sharply exceeded analysts' expectations, and profit in the
second half should be "significantly" higher than a year
earlier, Renso L. Caporali, chairman, said.
   In an interview, Mr. Caporali said that when Grumman
reports second-quarter results this week, probably Wednesday,
the figures will show that net income rose at least 28% to
between $25 million and $30 million, or 75 to 80 cents a
share.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>In the year-earlier period, Grumman earned $19.5 million,
or 56 cents a share.</p>
<p>Grumman this year has taken a number of steps to handle
the expected decline in U.S. defense contracts, including
offering early retirement to several thousand employees. But
even if the early retirement program is a success, Mr.
Caporali said, further layoffs may be necessary.</p>
<p>Securities analysts who follow the company have predicted
Grumman's second-quarter earnings will be about unchanged at
between 50 and 60 cents a share.</p>
<p>Second-quarter sales rose about 20% from $881 million a
year earlier, Mr. Caporali said, indicating sales in the area
of $1 billion.</p>
<p>Mr. Caporali attributed the improvement primarily to the
beginning of full production of the F-14D fighter for the
Navy this year. "We're pretty much in full swing" with the
assembly of the plane, he said.</p>
<p>The second-quarter earnings growth also stemmed from
increased sales of aircraft parts to Boeing Co. as a result
of Boeing's own sales boom, higher revenue and profit in
Grumman's data systems business, and improved margins in the
production of delivery vehicles for the U.S. Postal Service,
Mr. Caporali said. He said he believes the higher margins in
the postal vehicle business were linked to an employee
profit-sharing plan begun in that operation. "We're going to
try to look at applying it elsewhere" in the company, he
said.</p>
<p>In addition, Mr. Caporali said interest expense fell $3
million in the first six months from the 1989 first half,
with the decrease coming primarily in the second quarter.
Debt outstanding dropped to $890 million as of June 30 from
$950 million at the end of 1989.</p>
<p>Receivables and inventories fell to $1.6 billion June 30
from $1.78 billion at the end of the year, he said.</p>
<p>The backlog fell to $7 billion at June 30 from $7.4
billion a year earlier, mainly because of the delivery of
postal vehicles as part of a five-year, $1 billion order for
almost 100,000 vehicles.</p>
<p>Mr. Caporali, formerly Grumman's vice chairman,
technology, took over the duties of chairman, president and
chief executive recently after the resignation of John
O'Brien. The company's board is searching for candidates to
fill those positions; Mr. Caporali is among those being
considered.</p>
<p>Mr. O'Brien resigned amid reports that his name had arisen
in a federal grand jury investigation of Pentagon procurement
fraud. Mr. Caporali has declined to discuss those reports,
but in the interview he said Grumman has been told the
company isn't a target of the investigation. Mr. O'Brien
wasn't available for comment.</p>
