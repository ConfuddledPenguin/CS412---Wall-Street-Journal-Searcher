	<p class="article-leader">LEXINGTON, Ky. -- In the cool shade of a maple tree, the
man in blue Nike sneakers eyes the chestnut horse, one of
champion Secretariat's last fillies.
   Nearby, the horse's owner, Tom Gentry, paces nervously.
The horse breeder, who has sought protection from his
creditors through Chapter 11 bankruptcy-law proceedings,
hopes this guy isn't just window-shopping. Much like a
candidate seeking office, Mr. Gentry offers the visitor's
entourage free calculators, yardsticks and watches. A
farmhand mingles, bearing a round of yellow slushy drinks.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Southern hospitality counts here -- the visitor is Sheik
Hamdan bin Rashid al Maktoum, Dubai's minister of finance and
industry, whose oil-rich family spends millions for
thoroughbreds. "They control the market," Mr. Gentry says.
"Without them, where would we be?"</p>
<p>Foreign money now dominates the thoroughbred market, as
seen at Keeneland's July selected yearlings sale, the
premiere thoroughbred auction. On the first two days last
week, foreign buyers purchased 116 horses for about $51
million, more than half the $82.4 million total sold.</p>
<p>While the beleaguered thoroughbred market welcomes these
buyers, the foreign spending spree sparks concern that the
Bluegrass State could lose its crown as the thoroughbred
capital of the world. "There will be a day when Japanese
horses will be like Japanese cars," predicts Patrick Barbe,
the agent who buys horses for the Yoshida family, prominent
Japanese horse breeders. "There's already a Toyota factory in
Kentucky. There may be Japanese stallions standing here soon,
too."</p>
<p>Seven groups of Japanese buyers bought horses at
Keeneland, with Tomonori Tsurumaki spending $4.9 million for
two colts. Mr. Tsurumaki, the developer of Autopolis, a
Japanese leisure center built around an auto racetrack,
outbid D. Wayne Lukas, the leading U.S. horse trainer, on
both horses.</p>
<p>Some U.S. breeders scoff at the notion that the U.S. will
ever lose its edge in this industry, although England and
Ireland both turn out some high-quality thoroughbreds. It
isn't like assembling cars or televisions, they suggest:
There's no place like central Kentucky and its home-grown
stock to produce champions.</p>
<p>But many aren't so confident, with the industry still
recovering from a serious fall in prices from its peak in
1984. Prices last week were off 41% from six years ago and
11% from last year's sale.</p>
<p>Keeneland's sales director, W.B. Rogers Beasley Jr.,
misses the U.S. buyers from the Southwest who had money to
spend during the oil boom of the early 1980s. "When that
dried up, we lost a tremendous source of revenue," he says.
Then changes in the tax laws didn't help much either. "The
Americans are here at the sales, but they haven't been
spending," he says.</p>
<p>New signs of a weakening economy, such as the troubled
real estate market, could prompt even more U.S. buyers to
drop out. "I'm worried about the overall condition of the
economy. It's very soft," says C. Timothy Cone, president of
Fasig-Tipton Co., which hosts New York's Saratoga sale next
week.</p>
<p>One signal, he says, is an increase in loans outstanding
at Fasig-Tipton's finance company. Buyers choose that
financing route when banks tighten their collateral
requirements and spending on horse loans. "If the banks draw
in further, that will shorten the money supply at the sales,"
Mr. Cone says.</p>
<p>In addition, the tax law changes of 1986 took away much of
the passive-investment advantage of owning a horse.</p>
<p>John T.L. Jones Jr., owner of Walmac Farm in Lexington,
says: "Horses are bought with discretionary income. People
just don't have it."</p>
<p>That's not true, of course, if your family happens to
control a country in the Persian Gulf -- or if you're a
billionaire Japanese industrialist. Eager to woo such buyers,
Fasig-Tipton and Keeneland officials have made numerous trips
to Japan and elsewhere this year to promote and advertise the
summer and fall thoroughbred sales.</p>
<p>Keeneland this summer translated portions of its sales
catalog, as well as requests for credit or seats in the sales
arena, into Arabic, French and Japanese. Fasig-Tipton next
week will provide chauffeurs and interpreters for Japanese
buyers at the Saratoga sales.</p>
<p>At the Keeneland select sales, the Maktoums enjoy their
royal status in a private room, cloistered from the common
folk in the sales arena. Keeneland assigns a bid spotter to
the room so they can vie for horses without being seen by
others -- fitting treatment considering they forked over
about $427.4 million between 1980 and 1989 at the summer
horse sales, not to mention the private buying done outside
the auction rings or at other sales.</p>
<p>In the first two days of the Keeneland sale, the Maktoums
spent about $33.6 million for 63 horses.</p>
<p>Even though they're not visible, the tote board quickly
shows which horses the Maktoums want. The price on the first
horse in the Keeneland ring, a bay filly by Danzig, a leading
sire, quickly soared to $700,000. The buyer: Sheik Hamdan's
Shadwell Estate Co.</p>
<p>Japanese buyers are becoming more interested and
aggressive. "The economy in Japan is good, and racing is very
popular," says Teruya Yoshida, who breeds horses with his
father. "If a horse is worth $5 million, we'll pay it."</p>
<p>Last year, the Yoshidas bought the highest-priced yearling
of 1989 when they paid $2.8 million for a son of Northern
Dancer, a champion stallion. The colt, Northern Park, is in
training and should race in September, Mr. Barbe says.</p>
<p>On the opening day of the sales, the crowd was silent when
horse No. 136 entered the ring and a bidding war erupted
between the Maktoums and Yoshidas. In the end, the Maktoums
prevailed and paid $1,050,000 for the bay colt.</p>
<p>Some U.S. buyers say there are plenty of horses to go
around and that they're happy to pick up the leftovers.
Besides, they too eventually sell their stock to foreign
buyers. Allen E. Paulson, chairman and chief executive
officer of Gulfstream Aerospace, is happy to see so many
Japanese buyers at this year's sales. For the first time,
he's a seller rather than just a buyer of yearlings. "Foreign
people are wealthier than Americans, so it's healthy to see
them here," he says.</p>
<p>Carl Icahn, best known for his spending spree on USX Corp.
stock, is another buyer who's undaunted by the competition.
Mr. Icahn's stables have swelled to 200 horses from just 10
three years ago, says Rob Whiteley, director of Foxfield, Mr.
Icahn's horse operations.</p>
<p>Foreign buyers "look for the best and pay for the best,"
Mr. Whiteley says. "But there are still a lot a notch below
that." Mr. Icahn sold several yearlings to the Maktoums last
year at Saratoga.</p>
<p>And some U.S. buyers prove they can keep up with the
Maktoums. Despite their keen interest and bidding for Mr.
Gentry's filly, the Maktoums didn't get her. Mr. Lukas was
the high bidder, paying $2.1 million, the highest price paid
for a filly at the sale.</p>
<p>He suggests that one day the foreign buyers will stop
showing up for the sales. "The Arabs will feel saturated at
some point," he says. Many of the best bloodlines are now in
Europe and England, where the Maktoums and others have farms.
Eventually, those buyers "won't have to come to our markets
to establish themselves," says Dan Galbreath, owner of Darby
Dan farm in Lexington.</p>
<p>That would mark a return to the days before World War II,
when the best breeds came from European farms. "I'd hate to
think the world's best horses won't continue to be in the
U.S. But it's possible," says Preston Madden, a Lexington
horse breeder. "At least we're performing our patriotic duty
in Kentucky and creating a more favorable balance of trade."</p>
