	<p class="article-leader">TRENTON, N.J. -- Democratic Gov. Jim Florio has rung up
more legislative victories in his first six months in office
than most governors accomplish in an entire career.
   But in the process he's suffered a stunning political
defeat.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"He's lost his credibility," says Stephen Salmore, a
Rutgers University political scientist, "and next year he may
lose control of the state Assembly."</p>
<p>The problem, basically, is that the 52-year-old Mr. Florio
rammed the biggest and most complicated tax increase in the
state's history through a thoroughly cowed Democratic
legislature and failed to convince confused voters he needed
the money.</p>
<p>Now he faces a full-scale rebellion, fueled by
sensation-seeking editors at the tabloid daily, the
Trentonian, and rowdy voices in call-in shows at WKXW-FM, the
No. 1 radio station in central New Jersey. Other newspapers
around the state, including the 470,000-circulation Newark
Star Ledger, have questioned on their editorial pages whether
Gov. Florio's tax program will truly benefit the middle
class, as he contends it will.</p>
<p>More than 400,000 voters reportedly have signed petitions
demanding repeal of the new taxes and passage of legislation
giving them the right to recall elected officeholders. On
July 1, more than 6,000 angry voters surrounded the
Statehouse here in an anti-tax rally.</p>
<p>"They (the governor and his advisers) miscalculated on the
amount of heat they would have to take," says H.L. "Sandy"
Schwartz III, the Trentonian's publisher. Mr. Schwartz, who
arrived in Trenton early in 1989, dates the emergence of a
new, feistier Trentonian to stories the paper ran last year
about a severed human head found in neighboring Hopewell. The
page-one headline on one of the stories said: "Head had
AIDS." Mr. Schwartz framed the page and hung it in his
office.</p>
<p>With bizarre headlines like that, and with its unrelenting
attacks on Mr. Florio ("Another Florio Flimflam," screamed
last Tuesday's page-one headline), the paper's circulation
has grown to 72,000 from from 68,000.</p>
<p>Liberal and conservative commentators, floating high above
the roar of the crowd, have painted what's happening here as
a test for liberal, activist government in the post-Reagan
era. If Gov. Florio can succeed, they say, there is new hope
for liberals.</p>
<p>Mr. Florio, an eight-term congressman before he was
elected governor with 62% of the vote last November in a
campaign in which he said he didn't think New Jersey needed
new taxes, doesn't see it that way. He says he's just trying
to get New Jersey back on track by balancing his budget and
by making the property tax and school funding more equitable.
"It took eight years (under GOP Gov. Thomas Kean) to get
things this screwed up," he says. "I've been in office six
months. Give me a chance."</p>
<p>He's done two things. For the short run, he increased the
sales tax to 7% from 6% and expanded its base to include such
things as toilet paper and soap. He says he needed that money
-- about $1.1 billion -- to balance the 1990 budget. At the
same time, he figures he cut about $2 billion from the budget
he inherited from his predecessor, Mr. Kean. He sold off more
than 1,000 state cars, whacked $13 million from the state's
arts council and cut back on state agencies hiring outside
lawyers. He brought in, finally, a budget that showed almost
no increase from Mr. Kean's last budget.</p>
<p>"I've got to get the message out," the governor says,
"We're the cost-cutters."</p>
<p>The state's Standard & Poor's credit rating, which had
been put on a special "watch," has been restored to the full
triple-A.</p>
<p>He could have stopped there -- some of his colleagues now
wish he had. "But we couldn't just do 50% of the job," says
Douglas Berman, the aggressive 37-year-old state treasurer
and a principal architect of the Florio program. "We had to
get New Jersey off the fiscal roller coaster. We had been
living with too much reliance on the property tax and we were
facing a (state) supreme court ruling we expected would force
us to change the school-funding system."</p>
<p>Mr. Florio, a high-school dropout who eventually got his
diploma by taking a correspondence course (and going on from
there to college and law school), wanted to change the way
education was financed in the state. "He felt it in his gut,"
says Mr. Berman.</p>
<p>And so Mr. Florio, with Mr. Berman at his side, plunged
into what turned out to be a deep political thicket, from
which neither one has yet emerged.</p>
<p>They acted on the premise that schools weren't equal in
New Jersey -- a curious state with large rural areas and
unusually wide swings between wealthy, manicured suburbs and
poor, rubble-strewn cities. They believed -- correctly, as it
turned out -- the state supreme court would come to the same
conclusion.</p>
<p>Their solution: Shift resources from the wealthy districts
to the poorer ones, and impose a tougher, more progressive
income tax to pay for the improvements. This proposal will
bring in an additional $1.3 billion a year -- $600 million
for schools, $400 million in property-tax rebates and $300
million to pay for social-welfare services formerly picked up
by county and municipal governments.</p>
<p>Ultimately, under the new legislation, 146 of the state's
578 school districts -- the wealthiest of the lot -- will be
cut adrift without state aid. Of the rest, 362 will get more
aid and 70 will get about the same. To maintain educational
services at levels they have long expected, the 146 wealthy
districts, educating about 15% of the state's students,
probably will have to raise their property taxes. Gov.
Florio's experts hope some of them will find ways to cut
costs -- by consolidation, for example. Some high schools in
wealthy districts have fewer than 300 students.</p>
<p>Parts of the program won't lock in completely until 1995,
and no changes in school funding will be made at all next
year.</p>
<p>The $400 million for property-tax rebates is aimed at
alleviating what Mr. Florio and his advisers see as another
inequality. They point to a typical situation in which a
couple that bought a house 20 years ago for $30,000 is living
next door to a couple that bought a similar house two years
ago for $250,000. The longtime residents can't pay their
taxes; the newcomers can. Under the Florio plan, anyone
paying more than 5% of their household income in property
taxes gets a rebate, starting at $100 and rising to $500. But
the checks won't begin appearing until late next year.</p>
<p>"That's one of the problems," says Mary Segers, a Rutgers
political scientist. "Nobody believes they really are going
to get any benefits."</p>
<p>"We are helping the middle class," insists Gov. Florio,
conceding at the same time that the message hasn't gotten
through. The ultimate frustration for Mr. Florio and his
allies is that the people who seem to be the angriest --
working-class and moderate-income voters -- are precisely the
people he hoped to assist.</p>
<p>But there was still more tinkering. To get enough money to
the poorer districts to make a difference, Mr. Florio
proposed raising the income tax for "wealthy" individuals and
couples. The top rate was doubled to 7% and it arbitrarily
locked in for individuals making $75,000 a year and couples
making $150,000. The governor's advisers say 90% of the new
income-tax revenue will come from individuals and couples
making more than $100,000 a year. Yet, individuals making
more than $35,000 a year and couples reporting more than
$70,000 a year also will be paying more.</p>
<p>Hardly anyone in New Jersey understands how it works.</p>
<p>"Are you telling me a couple making $70,000 a year, with
kids in college, with auto insurance to pay, with the new
sales tax, is wealthy?" asks Garabed "Chuck" Haytaian, the
Assembly's minority leader. "How much have you got left to
eat on?"</p>
<p>But, the governor's aides insist, Mr. Haytaian's couple
won't be paying the full rate. Couples making between $70,000
and $80,000 will pay 5%, up from 3.5%. Those making between
$80,000 and $150,000 will pay 6.5%. And, over $150,000, the
top 7% rate kicks in.</p>
<p>Gov. Florio knows he faces an immense challenge in selling
his program to New Jersey's angry voters. "I've got to get
through to the voters over the clatter of the Trentonian and
the shrill voices at the radio station," he says. "But as we
explain what we're doing, as we point out we're the ones
correcting the oppressive costs that have been visited upon
the people of New Jersey over the last eight years, that as
the tangible results start to play out, people will be
supportive. Middle-income people -- the vast majority of the
people in New Jersey -- will see the virtues of what this has
been all about."</p>
