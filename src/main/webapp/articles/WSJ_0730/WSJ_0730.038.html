	<div class="article-body"><p>Albania is holding talks with the Soviet Union on renewing
diplomatic ties, the Albanian news agency ATA reported yes
terday.</p>
<p>The agency said a Soviet foreign-ministry delegation
arrived in Tirana Satur day to discuss the normalization of
rela tions between the two countries.</p>
<p>The Soviet Union broke off diplomatic relations with
Albania in 1961 as a result of a split with China, which then
became Albania's chief communist ally. Albania, the last
hard-line communist state in Europe, also has no relations
with the U.S.</p>
<p>In Albania, the government proposed that agricultural
workers be given larger plots of land to farm individually,
the ATA news agency reported. Plans to allow a measure of
private farming were announced several weeks ago, but the ATA
report was the first to contain details.</p>
<p>FOREIGN INVESTMENT IN VIETNAM</p>
<p>Oil and gas projects accounted for most of the $245.6
million in new investment in Vietnam in the first six months
of this year, the official Vietnam News Agency said; of that
total, $197 million came from abroad. The report said Vietnam
granted licenses for 54 foreign-investment projects in the
first half of the year. Four projects involved oil and gas,
but they accounted for 73% of the capital. Other projects
involved tourism, services, fishing, agricultural processing
and consumer goods, the report said.</p>
<p>NERVOUS NORWAY</p>
<p>Norway's Environment Minister Kristin Hille Valla urged
West Germany, the Netherlands and Spain to refrain from
exporting their radioactive waste to a disposal and
reprocessing site at Dounreay, Scotland. She said a radiation
leak from the northern Scotland site could contaminate
Norway, neighboring countries and fish stocks. She cited a
1987 United Nations report urging nations using nuclear power
to dispose of waste within their own boundaries. The Dounreay
plant reprocessed such nuclear fuels as enriched uranium
until the early 1970s. It is due to reopen and possibly
expand, said a Norwegian Environment Ministry official.</p>
<p>THAILAND'S EXPORT GROWTH</p>
<p>Led by strong growth in industrial products, Thai exports
in the first half of 1990 were 15.5% higher than the same
period last year, an official of the Department of Business
Economics said. A report from the department said the
strongest industrial exports were computers, integrated
circuits, shoes and garments. The report projected that
exports would total $23.9 billion for the year, compared with
last year's $20.2 billion.</p>
<p>NINJA TURTLES ABROAD</p>
<p>The Beecroft Public School in Sydney, Australia, has
banned games or play related to "Teenage Mutant Ninja
Turtles." "The children have been fighting in the playground
and picking up sticks to use," a school official said. "When
you ask them what they are doing, they say they are just
doing Ninja Turtles." And in Leeds, England, two firemen had
to be rescued from a sewer Friday after trudging through
water in search of children imitating the Ninja Turtles. The
children were already above ground by the time their
exhausted would-be rescuers radioed a colleague to come and
get them.</p>
<p>THEFT IN THE PHILIPPINES</p>
<p>Philippine Defense Secretary Fidel Ramos accused
politicians of stealing relief goods intended for victims of
the July 16 earthquake. Canned milk, sardines and blankets
sent by foreign donors were not reaching victims of the quake
and were being diverted to supporters of local politicians in
areas unaffected by the quake, Mr. Ramos said. Two truckloads
of relief goods were stolen before they could reach the
northern city of San Jose in the devastated province of Nueva
Ecija, rescue officials said.</p>
<p>KEEPING POLAND POLISH</p>
<p>A motion to bar sale of Polish government-owned real
estate to non-Poles was approved by a 224-136 vote with seven
abstentions in the lower house of Parliament.</p>
<p>There is widespread concern among Poles that their country
will be "bought out" by Westerners -- particularly Germans --
seeking relatively inexpensive properties in Eastern Europe.</p>
<p>The law doesn't apply to privately owned land, which
currently can be sold to foreigners with the permission of
the Interior Ministry. Such sales were strictly limited under
the former communist regime and are still infrequent, with
80% of the approvals going to foreigners of Polish origin,
Interior Minister Krzysztof Kozlowski told Parliament.</p>
<p>Last week, the Polish Senate gave final approval to
legislation that would permit transferring 80% of the
nation's state-owned industry to private investors.</p>
<p>POSTSCRIPTS . . .</p>
<p>The Soviet Union plans to abolish its censorship
organization, Glavlit, which for decades was the guardian of
the Communist Party line in literature and the arts, a Soviet
newspaper said. Komsomolskaya Pravda said Glavlit will be
replaced by Guot, an organization concerned with guarding
state secrets. . . . In Britain, Queen Elizabeth II won a
high court injunction banning publication of "Courting
Disaster," a book by a former royal clerk. The book
reportedly describes heavy drinking and illicit sex among
royal employees and includes a picture of the queen in bed.</p>
