	<p class="article-leader">CHICAGO -- In a setback for the federal crackdown on
computer "hackers," prosecutors dropped felony charges
against a computer whiz accused of conspiring to steal a
sensitive document from a BellSouth Corp. subsidiary.
   The closely watched trial, which began here last week, had
been seen by some as a test of First Amendment rights of
operators of electronic "bulletin boards," computers that
store and forward text over phone lines.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>But the case was dropped after testimony showed the
document wasn't the potentially dangerous and proprietary
information that the government had said it was, said Sheldon
Zenner, attorney for the defendant, 20-year-old Craig
Neidorf, of Chesterfield, Mo.</p>
<p>Mr. Neidorf was charged with conspiring with three Georgia
men who admitted breaking into Southern Bell Telephone Co.'s
computer systems. The three pleaded guilty to computer fraud
last month and are scheduled to be sentenced in September.</p>
<p>Mr. Neidorf's case differed from the Georgia cases in that
he wasn't accused of "hacking," or illegally entering the
Southern Bell computers. Prosecutors instead focused on his
role as an operator of the electronic bulletin board on which
the document had appeared.</p>
<p>The focus of the case was a Southern Bell document
describing the administration of its emergency 911 telephone
system. The government alleged that electronic publication of
the document by Mr. Neidorf could have led to a disruption of
the system. But the defense showed that the document
contained information commonly available and could not have
been used to endanger the 911 system.</p>
<p>A spokeswoman for the prosecutor, Assistant U.S. Attorney
William Cook, said, "We received information during the
course of the trial that changed our case drastically, and we
no longer felt that felony charges were appropriate." She
said the defendant agreed to submit to pre-trial diversion, a
form of court supervision similar to probation. "If he keeps
his nose clean for a period of time, he won't have a criminal
record," the spokeswoman said. She added that "the trial
never got to the First Amendment issues."</p>
