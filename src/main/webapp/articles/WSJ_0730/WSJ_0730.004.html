	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- As federal officials work to sort out the
financial problems of a large guarantor of student loans, the
government is studying ways to tighten up the program, which
will make nearly $18 billion of education loans this fiscal
year.
   "We're going to have to be much tougher," Sen. Nancy
Kassebaum (R., Kan.) said at a Senate Banking Committee
hearing on the implications of the troubles facing the Higher
Education Assistance Foundation, the guarantee agency plagued
by losses.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The Bush administration is considering changes in the
program, a major financing source for college and vocational
education. No decisions have been made yet, but officials are
discussing the possibility of requiring co-signers on loans,
credit checks on borrowers, linking some loans to high school
performance and increasing incentives for lenders to weed out
credit risks. The administration will propose the changes
next year.</p>
<p>Committee members criticized the Education Department for
not moving aggressively enough to curb loan defaults, which
are expected to total about $2.3 billion this fiscal year.
"We will be back to you and asking for other types of
authority" to reduce losses, Ted Sanders, undersecretary of
education, promised the panel.</p>
<p>During the weekend officials from the Education Department
and the Office of Management and Budget studied the financial
condition of the Higher Education Assistance Foundation, and
reviewed options for transferring HEAF's operations and
nearly $9 billion loan portfolio to another agency.</p>
<p>Education Department officials are talking with United
Student Aid Funds, another large nonprofit guarantee agency;
the Student Loan Marketing Association, the federally
chartered, stockholder-owned corporation that is the nation's
largest holder of student loans, and state guarantee
agencies, including the Massachusetts Higher Education
Assistance Corp. The government, which is operating with the
help of private financial consultants, isn't likely to settle
HEAF's fate until the end of this week, officials said.</p>
<p>At the hearing, Mr. Sanders repeated earlier assertions
that HEAF's problems shouldn't hurt students who are trying
to get loans for school this fall, the financial institutions
that make the loans, or the nation's 54 other guarantee
agencies. In addition, he estimated that it would cost the
government less than $100 million to resolve's HEAF's
problems by transferring HEAF's assets to another agency.
Under all the plans the government is considering, HEAF, a
nonprofit corporation based in Overland Park, Kan., would go
out of business.</p>
<p>Lawrence Hough, the new president of the Student Loan
Marketing Association, which owns $2.4 billion of loans
guaranteed by HEAF, expressed confidence at the hearing that
"HEAF's financial condition poses no material risk of loss to
Sallie Mae." He noted that the loans are reinsured by the
Education Department. Sallie Mae has also made about $800
million of collateralized loans to HEAF and its affiliates.
Mr. Hough said Sallie Mae's stock fell sharply last week
because "the market doesn't understand that in this instance
we're fully collateralized."</p>
<p>Mr. Hough also expressed confidence that Sallie Mae would
be able to take over HEAF's operations and portfolio without
jeopardizing its top credit rating. If the government were to
accept Sallie Mae's proposal, "we would bring additional
focus and additional competitive levels of service" to the
student loan guarantee field, he said.</p>
<p>However, other loan industry officials and some government
officials fear that letting Sallie Mae into the guarantee
business would eventually snuff out competition. Sallie Mae,
which was established by the government to help establish a
resale market in student loans, currently owns $13.5 billion
of the $51 billion in guaranteed student loans outstanding.</p>
