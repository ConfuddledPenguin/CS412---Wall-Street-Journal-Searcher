	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- The pummeling of many growth stocks during
this current spate of earnings reports has been ugly to
behold. But not all money managers are aghast.
   Many companies whose stocks were beaten down long ago to
cheap multiples of annual per-share profit are surprising
investors with better-than-expected second-quarter earnings.
To see such "low P/E" industry groups as aluminum and
insurance earn more than analysts predicted is enough to
bring tears of joy to value investors' eyes. With earnings
expectations driving the stock market this year, these
forlorn owners of stocks that usually respond to healthy
economic growth have watched their portfolios lag the market,
while portfolios filled with blue-chip shares of
tried-and-true growth companies raced ahead.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Now, however, the tables may be turning. Last Monday,
investors said enough to hyped-up earnings expectations and
took two steps back from the market. The Dow Jones Industrial
Average tumbled 105 points in about an hour, then recovered
to post a 56.44-point loss. There's no question that earnings
growth is still the stock market's motor. But what may be
changing is the kind of stocks investors are looking to for
growth.</p>
<p>Whether money managers begin paring back positions in such
double-digit earnings growers as Coca-Cola and Wal-Mart
Stores and begin reaching down to cheaper, neglected shares
of slower-growing companies depends largely on their economic
outlook.</p>
<p>Data released Friday morning showed the economy growing at
a annual rate of 1.2%. That report shook up the stock market,
contributing 22.28 points to the Dow industrials' loss of
62.63 points for the week. If anything, this
weaker-than-expected growth bolstered the convictions of
growth stock managers, who are betting that the companies in
which they own stakes will increase profits faster than those
whose fortunes are tied to the economic cycle.</p>
<p>But economic growth between 1% and 2% is turning out
stronger-than-expected earnings in many neglected sectors of
the stock market. If the economy can sustain this
slow-but-steady pace, investors may begin to look at some
cheap stocks that are entering stronger earnings cycles.</p>
<p>Copper and aluminum stocks, for example, which fall into
the nonferrous metals industry group, earned more in the
second quarter than analysts expected. "Better product
pricing is materializing despite economic weakness," said
Joseph J. McAlinden, director of research at Dillon, Read &
Co. The coal industry also beat analysts' earnings
expectations.</p>
<p>If the economy does slow further, some strategists think
the Federal Reserve will take its foot off the monetary
brakes and drive interest rates lower to avoid recession.
Reflation, as this policy is called in some quarters, is an
emerging theme in the stock market these days, possibly
because it's essential to the case of investors who foresee
stepped-up earnings growth for many cyclical companies.</p>
<p>"To the extent that the Federal Reserve stimulates more,
you have tremendous upside potential" in cyclical shares,
said Stefan Abrams, chief investment strategist at Kidder,
Peabody & Co. "Nobody is valuing these shares for reflation"
-- at least not yet.</p>
<p>If the economy lapses into a recession, which many
strategists think is possible, high-flying growth stocks may
be hurt more than cyclical shares. For all their talk about
global earnings power, investors have been digging into
earnings reports to see how much came from the U.S. -- and
shivered. It was McDonald's disappointing performance in U.S.
stores that caused the stock to drop 12% in two days last
week. Meanwhile, many cyclical stocks are already trading at
prices that appear to anticipate a recession.</p>
<p>Positive and negative earnings surprises reflect analysts'
exaggerated fears and hopes. So far in this period of profit
reports, negative earnings surprises, on average, were 61.6%
below the average estimate of at least three analysts.
Positive surprises averaged 28% better than the forecasts.</p>
<p>Zacks Investment Research said the overall earnings
disappointment for the 750 companies that are in the Dow
Jones Equity Market Index was 4.5% in the second quarter,
compared with 3% in the first quarter. However, the number of
negative surprises dropped to 51.5% in the second quarter
from 54% in the first quarter, said Ben Zacks, executive vice
president.</p>
<p>For a value investor, the trick is to find stocks that are
at the trough of their earnings cycle, just before results
start heading up again.</p>
<p>Positive earnings surprises in aerospace, securities
brokers, and container makers don't reflect a profit
turnaround, analysts say. Defense contracts will get slimmer;
Wall Street is still weathering a drought in investment
banking fees, and the paper packaging industry can still
produce more than it can sell, analysts say.</p>
<p>But the positive surprises in the insurance, nonferrous
metals, oil and food industry groups may portend accelerating
earnings growth.</p>
<p>Life insurance firms seem headed toward higher earnings
again by cutting back on sales incentives and keeping more
investment income for themselves. "A value investor with some
degree of patience should be accumulating" insurance stocks,
said Denis Callaghan, managing director at Alex. Brown &
Sons. Earnings aren't rising yet, he cautioned, but the rate
wars are over, and earnings should be climbing unmistakably
by late 1991. He recommends Chubb and Marsh & McLennan.</p>
<p>Earnings of food retailers should also be stable to
better, said Edward Comeau, analyst at Oppenheimer & Co. "You
have a whole array of highly leveraged companies out there.
It is not in their best interest to get aggressive" and cut
prices, Mr. Comeau said.</p>
<p>Among metals stocks, Phelps Dodge's second-quarter
earnings of $3.30 a share beat analysts' expectations by
nearly 15%. Analysts figured that slow economic growth would
drive the average price of copper below $1 a pound this year,
but prices have averaged above $1.</p>
<p>"The economy is expanding fast enough to create an
environment where copper, aluminum and insurance companies
are able to raise prices," said Mr. McAlinden. Inflation
remains stuck between 4% and 5%, even though economic growth
is slow, because the unusually long eight-year expansion has
created shortages in labor and other resources, he added.</p>
<p>Said Kidder's Mr. Abrams, "If investors come to believe
that we are in a recession, these {cyclical} stocks don't
have much downside {risk}, and they will be good performers
because step A is recession, and step B is reflation" by the
Fed.</p>
<p>But without renewed inflation to help boost product
prices, many of these stocks may just muddle along with
mediocre earnings in a 1% to 2% growth economy, Mr. Abrams
cautioned. For now, he recommends that investors stick with a
portfolio that's two-thirds growth stocks. "For the very long
term, that's where the big money has always been made," he
said. "Sam Walton {chairman of Wal-Mart} didn't get rich
trading the cyclicals."</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>Friday Market Activity</p>
<p>The Dow Jones Industrial Average tumbled 22.28 to 2898.51,
largely because of weaker-than-expected second-quarter
economic growth and increased recession fears. Volume on the
New York Stock Exchange was a moderate 149,070,000 shares.</p>
<p>The industrial average's loss for the week, which started
with a 56-point drop Monday, was 62.63, or 2.1%. Standard &
Poor's 500-stock index fell 2.3% for the week, while the Big
Board's composite index lost 2.2% and the Dow Jones Equity
Market Index dropped 2.4%. A steady stream of disappointing
second-quarter earnings reports was the main influence.</p>
<p>Friday's preliminary report on second-quarter gross
national product -- the nation's output of goods and services
-- reinforced the notion that the economy may be slowing too
much. Investors were concerned not just because GNP growth
was less than consensus expectations -- 1.2% as opposed to
1.8% -- but also because the figure included a decline in
consumption and a rise in inventories. Many consumer stocks
were hit especially hard.</p>
<p>Investors clearly are refocusing on how weak economic
growth might hurt profitability, rather than on how it might
lead to lower interest rates, which can help corporate
profits, said David Bostian, chief investment strategist at
Jesup, Josephthal.</p>
<p>Walt Disney added to investors' anxiety about earnings.
The company's second-quarter profit rose 23%, which was
slightly lower than analysts' expectations. The stock dropped
5 to 116.</p>
<p>McDonald's, which started the week with an
earnings-related sell-off, lost 7/8 to 31 3/4.</p>
<p>Philip Morris continued to stumble on news earlier last
week suggesting tobacco companies aren't immune to
product-liability lawsuits. The stock fell 5/8 to 46 5/8.</p>
<p>Wal-Mart Stores dropped 1 to 31 5/8. Elsewhere in the
consumer sector, Anheuser-Busch dropped 1 1/2 to 42 3/8;
Johnson & Johnson fell 1 to 72 3/8; Procter & Gamble slid 3/4
to 86 1/8; Woolworth lost 3/4 to 31 1/2, and Toys "R" Us fell
1 3/8 to 29 3/8.</p>
<p>International Business Machines fell 1 3/4 to 111 3/8.
SoundView Financial Group downgraded the stock's investment
rating to "sell" from "hold" and lowered its 1991 earnings
estimate, saying it expects IBM will have problems making the
transition to a new line of mainframe computers in the fourth
quarter.</p>
<p>Other technology issues also declined: Compaq Computer
fell 2 1/8 to 55 3/4; Digital Equipment lost 1 1/4 to 74 7/8;
Unisys slid 3/4 to 11 1/8; Cray Research slipped 7/8 to 43;
and Hewlett-Packard fell 5/8 to 44 1/8.</p>
<p>Oil stocks, on the other hand, generally held firm amid
news that the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries
agreed on a target price of $21 a barrel, up from $18, for
crude oil. Exxon rose 3/8 to 49 1/4, Chevron rose 1/4 to 77
1/4, and Amoco rose 7/8 to 54 1/4.</p>
<p>Dividend-related trades swelled volume in the two most
active Big Board issues: Merrill Lynch, which fell 1/8 to 23
1/2 on 3.2 million shares, and Citicorp, which declined 1/2
to 20 3/8 on 2.9 million shares.</p>
<p>Boeing advanced 1/8 to 59 1/4 on a better-than-expected
earnings report.</p>
<p>Mylan Laboratories skidded 2 1/2 to 19, extending its
slide in the wake of a weaker-than-expected quarterly
earnings report.</p>
<p>Pfizer added 1/4 to 74 3/8 on news that a Food and Drug
Administration panel set a tentative date for review of
Sertraline, the company's anti-depressant drug.</p>
<p>Northrop fell 1 3/8 to 14 1/8 amid reports of a Justice
Department recommendation that the company be barred from
making weapons for the U.S. military. Northrop has pleaded
guilty to fraud charges.</p>
<p>Grumman gained 3/4 to 15 1/2 on a report that the company
expects to report strong quarterly earnings.</p>
<p>Milton Roy advanced 1 3/4 to 28 5/8 after its board agreed
to hold discussions with Sundstrand, which holds a 15% stake
in the company and has offered $28 a share for the rest.</p>
<p>The American Stock Exchange Market Value Index slid 0.84
to 355.49, extending its loss for the week to 1.4%.</p>
<p>Air & Water Technologies Class A tumbled 3 1/8 to 24 3/4.
Alex. Brown & Sons and Kidder Peabody both lowered investment
ratings and cut earnings estimates on the company's 83%-owned
Metcalf & Eddy unit. On the over-the-counter market, Metcalf
& Eddy fell 5 1/2 to 20 1/2.</p>
