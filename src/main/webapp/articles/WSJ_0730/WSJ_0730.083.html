	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- The Senate Judiciary Committee set Sept. 13
as the start of the hearings on the nomination of Judge David
Souter for the U.S. Supreme Court.
   That makes it unlikely that Judge Souter, if confirmed by
the Senate, would be sworn in before the high court's
closed-door conference the week of Sept. 24, when the
justices vote on whether to hear or reject around 1,000
cases. And it would take a quick timetable for Judge Souter
to be sworn in by Oct. 1, when the court term opens with two
weeks of oral arguments.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>In announcing the date, Sen. Joseph Biden (D., Del.), the
committee chairman, said he doesn't know how long the
confirmation process will take.</p>
