	<p class="article-leader">Lots of professional money managers are bearish on bonds
these days -- and that could be a signal for individual
investors to think about buying bonds next month at the
Treasury's big quarterly sale.
   Bearish sentiment has grown over the past month, mainly
because of inflation fears. Some investment advisers are
especially apprehensive because of the government's huge
borrowing needs to pay its bills. Another wave of borrowing
will be announced Wednesday afternoon, when the Treasury
discloses details of its multibillion-dollar August
refunding.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>A survey of some 50 fixed-income investment managers by
C.J. Lawrence, Morgan Grenfell Inc. last week found that 13%
considered themselves bearish, up sharply from just 4%
earlier in the month. Only 35% of those surveyed by the New
York investment firm were bullish, down from 53%.</p>
<p>A separate survey of about 70 analysts and market advisers
by Hadady Corp., Pasadena, Calif., produced a similar
finding: Hadady's Bullish Consensus fell to 56 from its
recent high of 61 only two weeks before.</p>
<p>But gloom can be a bullish cue. Going against the herd is
a strategy that's well known in the stock market. Over the
past year or two, it has proved to be a remarkably successful
bond-market strategy.</p>
<p>Last Christmas, for instance, several surveys showed an
unusually large increase in bullish sentiment among
bond-market professionals. Shortly thereafter, bond prices
tumbled and yields rose. Even more striking was the high
level of bearishness in March 1989, just before bond prices
took off and yields declined.</p>
<p>Now, if the bond-market "sentiment indicator" is right
this time, prices are again set to rise and yields to ease.
That could make the coming Treasury auction a great
opportunity for individual investors to lock in attractive
yields.</p>
<p>Treasury notes and bonds, which pay interest free from all
state and local income taxes, currently offer yields from 8%
to just over 8.5%, depending on maturity. That's well above
the 7.80% national average yield on two-year bank
certificates of deposit and the 7.88% average seven-day
compound yield on money-market mutual funds.</p>
<p>The yields available on risk-free Treasurys aren't that
much lower than the stock market's long-term return of 10%.
With stock prices near their all-time highs, several
market-watchers say stocks are probably headed for several
years of sub-par returns -- especially if the long-feared
recession finally arrives.</p>
<p>Also, Treasury yields typically rise a bit in the days
before the quarterly refundings.</p>
<p>Using surveys to gauge the sentiment of market pros and
then doing the opposite can be a risky strategy for
investors. Several finance professors who have studied
stock-market sentiment surveys contend these polls are
largely useless as contrary market indicators because they
emit too many wrong signals.</p>
<p>Critics also say it's often difficult to gauge precisely
when investor sentiment has reached an extreme stage that
justifies taking action. "You often can't know until it's too
late," says Donald J. Fine, chief market analyst at Chase
Manhattan Bank.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, the C.J. Lawrence survey, which began in
mid-1988, is beginning to look like a promising contrary
indicator of bond prices. "It's too early to say for sure,
but it seems to be building a nice track record, and it may
be a good contrary indicator," says Nancy Lazar, a senior
vice president at C.J. Lawrence.</p>
<p>Richard Ishida, vice president, research, at Hadady's,
thinks the message from his firm's survey is clear: "It's
saying we are getting close to a good time to buy."</p>
<p>The bond bears' big concern is inflation. The bears fear
the Federal Reserve isn't being tough enough in fighting
inflation, and they worry about pressure from the White House
and Congress to reflate the economy.</p>
<p>Some bears bolster their argument by pointing to the
"yield curve," which measures the difference between
short-term and long-term interest rates. Lately, the yield
curve has "steepened," as short-term rates have fallen more
than long-term yields, widening the gap between short-term
and long-term rates.</p>
<p>This steeper yield curve "has signaled the market's
displeasure" with the Fed's move, according to Gary
Schlossberg, economist at Wells Fargo Bank in San Francisco.
The steepening yield curve also could mean trouble for bonds
in the near future, several analysts say.</p>
<p>But others think such fears are unfounded. Ms. Lazar and
colleague Edward S. Hyman at C.J. Lawrence say that although
the yield curve has steepened, it is still considerably
flatter than it has been historically. They also note that
the curve is actually flatter than it was at the beginning of
the 1984 bond rally, and thus represents another signal that
bonds are a good buy.</p>
<p>Several investment advisers argue that anemic money-supply
growth and sluggish economic performance should spell lower
inflation over the next six months. "I expect inflation to
moderate," allowing the Fed to cut interest rates further,
says Chase's Mr. Fine.</p>
<p>To be on the safe side, he suggests that investors stick
with three-year Treasury notes, rather than locking up their
money for longer periods, in 10-year notes or 30-year bonds.
The prices of shorter-term securities are also less volatile
in the "secondary," or resale market.</p>
<p>Buying Treasury securities at the quarterly refundings
allows investors to deal directly with the government, rather
than going through a brokerage firm or other intermediary.
That saves money, because there aren't any commissions or
fees.</p>
<p>The next refunding is tentatively slated for next week.
But the exact timing will depend on when Congress finally
gets around to raising the nation's debt ceiling, and that's
still anybody's guess.</p>
<p>As usual, the sale is expected to include three-year notes
(which were yielding about 8.1% on Friday), 10-year notes
(yielding about 8.4% Friday) and 30-year bonds (yielding
nearly 8.5% Friday).</p>
<p>Investors who want to buy at the refunding should contact
the nearest office of the Federal Reserve and ask for
information on the "Treasury Direct" system. Three-year
Treasury notes are sold in multiples of $5,000, while
longer-term Treasurys require investors to put up as little
as $1,000.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>Friday's Market Activity</p>
<p>Bonds posted moderate gains after the government reported
weak economic data and a top Federal Reserve official
suggested that the nation's central bank will keep credit
policy steady.</p>
<p>The bond market started to climb as soon as the market
opened, on news that inflation-adjusted gross national
product advanced at an anemic 1.2% annual rate in second
quarter. The gain was weaker than many economists had
projected.</p>
<p>Market participants were also heartened by news that the
GNP price deflator, a broad measure of inflation, posted a
modest decline.</p>
<p>"The GNP figures clearly washed out any lingering
expectations of economic strength," said Elliott Platt, a
senior vice president at Donaldson Lufkin & Jenrette
Securities Corp. "The inflation figures clearly lessened
fears in the marketplace about runaway inflation."</p>
<p>Bond prices climbed further following reports that Federal
Reserve Board Governor David Mullins suggested that current
monetary policy was sufficient to sustain moderate economic
growth.</p>
<p>When trading ended, the Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond
had risen nearly 5/8 point, or about $6.25 for a bond with a
$1,000 face amount. The issue's yield, which moves in the
opposite direction from its price, eased to 8.48%.</p>
<p>Yields on two-year notes ended at 7.98%, the first time
that yields on the securities ended below 8% in several
months.</p>
<p>The decline in rates produced a flurry of corporate bond
offerings as corporate treasurers jumped at the chance to
refinance commercial paper with short-term and medium-term
debt.</p>
<p>The biggest such deal on Friday was $250 million of
five-year notes issued by Johnson & Johnson. The 8.5%
noncallable notes were priced at par to yield 8.50%.</p>
<p>Tax-exempt municipal bonds finished the week unchanged to
1/8 point higher in moderate trading. Ahead on the municipal
calendar, only $321 million of bonds are expected to be
priced this week, down from $1.6 billion priced last week.</p>
