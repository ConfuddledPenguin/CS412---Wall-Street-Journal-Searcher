	<p class="article-leader">MOBILE, Ala. -- The nation's governors, always skeptical
of Washington, came together for their annual meeting here
with an unusually harsh and pervasive sense of resentment
toward the federal government's handling of the thrift
crisis.
   The executive committee of the National Governors'
Association approved a resolution to create a committee to
examine the causes of the S&L crisis and to recommend ways to
"stop the drain on the taxpayers' money." The resolution,
which is expected to win approval by the entire group of
governors, calls for a review of the "regulatory failures
that caused this unprecedented disaster." The resolution also
asks for "decisive action" to prevent a repetition of this
crisis.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Underlying the anger is a strong regional division, with
leaders of farm states expressing hostility over the prospect
of helping to underwrite the thrift bailout just a few years
after a farm-credit crisis left their states economically
devastated.</p>
<p>"We didn't have any S&Ls that went broke in our state, but
we led the nation in farm bankruptcies in 1986," said
Republican Gov. George Mickelson of South Dakota. "Nobody
bailed us out."</p>
<p>And though the governors divided along predictable lines
over whether the entire nation should bare the burden of the
thrift bailout, there was virtually unanimous sentiment that
the S&L problem was skewing priorities and diverting money.</p>
<p>"We're looking at resources that we desperately need and
see them being dished out to deal with this problem -- with
no real sense that we have a tourniquet to stop the
hemorrhaging," said Democratic Gov. Richard Celeste of Ohio,
who had his own thrift crisis in the 1980s and who is a
leading voice of resentment against Washington now. "Part of
this feeling is regional sentiment, but there's a real sense
that Head Start and other programs for children and the poor
will pay for this."</p>
<p>The governors acknowledge that, like many initiatives
pressed at conferences such as this, any action they take
would have little effect and in any case would be binding on
no one.</p>
<p>"There is not a lot we can do as governors," said GOP Gov.
Stan Stephens of Montana. "The fate of these kinds of
resolutions is well known. Nothing much happens."</p>
<p>Republican Gov. Garrey Carruthers of New Mexico dismissed
the resolution as a "feel-good" gesture, but Democratic Gov.
James Blanchard of Michigan characterized it as a "vote of no
confidence on federal action thus far."</p>
<p>One of the major concerns of the governors is to have some
voice over whatever proceeds are reaped, now or in the
future, from the costly efforts to get the thrift industry
back on its feet.</p>
<p>"Maybe we can generate some money that will go back and
pay for some of this," said Gov. Bill Clinton of Arkansas,
president of the Democratic Governors' Association. Mr.
Clinton's state, like many in the South, was hit particularly
hard by the thrift crisis. But he argues that Arkansas and
others were "just hit-and-run victims" rather than the
perpetrators of the crisis.</p>
<p>That argument hasn't mollified farm-state governors, who,
despite congressional action to ease the farm credit crisis
of the 1980s, still are resentful over what they consider a
lack of national resolve over their problem.</p>
<p>"This farm-state governor is madder than hell to be asked
to pay for this," GOP Gov. Terry Branstad of Iowa said of the
thrift bailout. "I don't like the idea of paying the bills
for the extravagance of people involved in the S&L crisis.
We've been asked to pay the bill for people who make stupid
decisions."</p>
<p>Mr. Branstad's remark stoked the issue, which other
Republicans hoped would remain under the surface and not
flare into a public disruption. But some Democrats considered
Mr. Branstad's arguments partisan in their own right. "The
Branstad comments," said Democratic Gov. Clinton, "will be
good politics in an election year in Iowa."</p>
