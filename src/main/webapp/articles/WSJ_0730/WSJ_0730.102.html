	<p class="article-leader">BOSTON -- Standard & Poor's Corp. said it lowered its
rating on BayBanks Inc.'s senior debt to double-B-plus from
triple-B-minus, citing the bank holding company's increase in
nonperforming assets.
   The rating concern also downgraded certificates of deposit
of the BayBank Middlesex unit to triple-B-minus/single-A-3
from triple-B/single-A-2.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The moves affect about $50 million of debt, S&P said.</p>
<p>BayBanks' recent announcement of an increase in
nonperforming assets in the second quarter "evidences the
continued steep decline in New England real estate sectors,"
S&P said. "Nonperforming asset levels are high relative to
the firm's low reserve levels and to its equity base."
Nonperforming assets include foreclosed loans and loans for
which interest payments are 90 days past due.</p>
<p>S&P said it expects BayBanks to have "high charge-offs
over the next few quarters" and further provisions for loan
losses, lowering its profitability. But the rating concern
added that BayBanks has good liquidity and less exposure to
commercial real estate loans than many other New England
banks.</p>
<p>A BayBanks spokesman declined to comment on the S&P
action.</p>
<p>BayBanks had a second-quarter net loss of $11.5 million,
or 72 cents a share, after a loan-loss provision of $63.5
million, and it cut its dividend by one-third. Loan-loss
reserves as of June 30 were $145 million, or 55% of
nonperforming loans, compared with $57.3 million, or 65.6% of
nonperforming loans a year earlier. Nonperforming loans rose
to $265 million as of June 30, compared with $237 million at
the end of the previous quarter and $87.4 million a year
earlier.</p>
