	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- As investors grow more nervous about the
banking industry's health, many banks are cutting back their
borrowing in the commercial paper market.
   While banks apparently have been able to line up alternate
sources of money without disruption, the fact that the
world's largest market for short-term money is less
hospitable to some banks is another sign of the increasingly
difficult environment banks are facing, analysts say.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Commercial paper, which plays a relatively minor role in
bank funding, is basically an unsecured corporate IOU that is
supposed to be repaid within a short period of time,
typically before 90 days. The popularity of commercial paper
issued by corporations to meet short-term borrowing needs
surged in the 1980s; currently, more than $550 billion of
commercial paper from all types of borrowers is outstanding.</p>
<p>Money market mutual funds are the biggest holders; by some
estimates, money funds hold about 40% of the total amount
outstanding.</p>
<p>But many banks increasingly are concerned that sales of
commercial paper could dry up on short notice, leaving them
scrambling to raise funds elsewhere. That danger has
increased, analysts say, as credit-rating agencies have
downgraded the ratings on many banks' debt. "Commercial paper
buyers can cut and run at any time," says Joseph Spalluto,
senior vice president for fixed-income sales at Keefe,
Bruyette & Woods Inc., a securities firm.</p>
<p>"Banks are reducing their dependence on commercial paper,
and one reason is a major buyer of commercial paper -- the
money market funds -- are limiting their purchases" to
top-rated paper, says Stephen W. Joynt, executive managing
director at Fitch Investors Service Inc., a rating agency.
Even among top-rated commercial paper, money funds are being
"more selective" about what they buy, he adds.</p>
<p>Citicorp, which had its debt rating downgraded by Moody's
Investors Service Inc. this spring, cut its average
commercial paper borrowings in the first quarter 30% to about
$6.9 billion from $9.9 billion a year earlier. The U.S.'s
biggest banking company says it has gathered more consumer
deposits, usually a cheaper source of funding, to reduce its
appetite for commercial paper.</p>
<p>Edison, N.J.-based Midlantic Corp. has sliced its
commercial paper borrowing to $170 million from a peak of
about $225 million. Donald Ebbert, a senior vice president,
says, "We are very clearly trying to reduce our commercial
paper outstandings to zero over the next 60 days."</p>
<p>Privately, banking regulators, including the Federal
Reserve, have encouraged banks to reduce commercial paper
borrowings, according to individuals close to banks, in favor
of longer-term and less-volatile sources of money like
consumer deposits or the sale of long-term bonds.</p>
<p>The movement away from commercial paper is part of a
broader trend among banks in favor of longer-term funding
that can't disappear on short notice and of keeping greater
amounts of cash on hand.</p>
<p>In January 1989, the Federal Reserve quietly stopped
publishing data on banks' commercial paper outstanding.
However, in December 1988, bank commercial paper outstanding
stood at $44.4 billion. According to statistics compiled by
Moody's, commercial paper outstanding among a group of the
U.S.'s largest banks fell to about $22.7 billion at the end
of March from $30.8 billion a year earlier.</p>
<p>Banks issue commercial paper at the parent holding-company
level, not the bank, usually to fund nonbank subsidiaries.
Bank commercial paper isn't covered by federal deposit
insurance.</p>
<p>Commercial paper defaults are rare, but when they hit,
they can send shock waves throughout the financial markets.
Many investors still recall vividly the financial wreck in
1970 of Penn Central Transportation Co. The company ran out
of cash and defaulted on its commercial paper borrowings,
frightening many investors away from the market.</p>
<p>Prices have also been a factor in some banks' retreat from
the commercial paper market. Since March, when banks reported
generally poor results, the differential in commercial paper
rates paid by top-rated banks and lower-rated banks has
widened to 0.30 percentage point. That compares to a 0.15
differential between top-rated and lower-rated industrial
issuers. This is a sign that lower-rated banks are having
more difficulty raising funds cheaply in the paper market.</p>
<p>Indeed, says Mr. Spalluto of Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, "The
concerns of the commercial paper market are filtering over to
longer-term debt issues. People are keenly aware of the role
that commercial paper plays in liquidity."</p>
<p>So far, banks have been able replace their commercial
paper borrowings by several means. Midlantic has agreed to
sell its leasing subsidiary, thereby eliminating its need for
commercial paper. Others, like Baltimore-based MNC Financial
Corp., have bundled portfolios of credit-card loans into
securities that were sold, thereby reducing the amount of
assets that need funding.</p>
<p>Depositors of beleaguered savings and loan associations
apparently have been a source of replacement funding. Federal
Reserve figures show that in 1989, time deposits of less than
$100,000 at commercial banks grew 17.7%, far faster than
other types of bank liabilities.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, banks like Citicorp don't intend to drop out
of the commercial paper market entirely. "We like to keep our
options open," said a spokesman. Commercial paper provides
banks with a quick source of relatively inexpensive funds.
Top-rated Banc One Corp. earlier this year sold $700 million
in commercial paper without any snags to fund its acquisition
of a Texas bank. Banc One, based in Columbus, Ohio, has since
replaced the paper with long-term funding through sales of
stock and bonds.</p>
<p>George R.L. Meiling, Banc One's treasurer, said:
"Commercial paper is an accordion that expands and contracts
with our needs. We use it as filler to tide us over lumps in
funding."</p>
