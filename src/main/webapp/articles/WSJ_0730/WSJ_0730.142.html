	<p class="article-leader">WHIPPANY, N.J. -- Isomedix Inc. expects to report
second-quarter net income about in line with analyst
estimates, indicating a 30% earnings rise on 28% higher
revenue.
   John Masefield, chairman, president and chief executive
officer, said the sterilization-services company's net was
close to estimates of $1.2 million, or 18 cents a share,
compared with $919,303, or 18 cents a share, in the
year-earlier period. Isomedix completed a public offering of
1.3 million shares at $8.75 each last September. Revenue was
around $6.6 million, compared with $5.1 million, the
executive said in an interview.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>For the six months, earnings were near estimates of $2.2
million, or 32 cents a share, up 33% from $1.6 million, or 31
cents a share. Revenue grew about 24% to $12.4 million from
$10 million, Isomedix indicated.</p>
<p>"Earnings are about as predicted. Gamma (radiation
services) in medical devices are a little softer than we'd
hoped for," Mr. Masefield said. The company sterilizes a
variety of products using gamma rays and is building its
ability to sterilize using ethylene oxide gas.</p>
<p>He said medical-supply companies have been importing
already-sterilized gloves and saline solutions, hurting
Isomedix's revenue. As a result, "I'm not so sanguine about
the second half that we'll be right on target" with earnings
estimates, Mr. Masefield said. Analysts put Isomedix's
earnings for 1990 around 74 cents a share, compared with 62
cents a share in 1989.</p>
<p>To counter the softness, the company is spreading its
service base, increasingly emphasizing consumer products and
food packaging, Mr. Masefield said. Consumerproduct
sterilization now accounts for 15% to 20% of revenue,
compared with 10% a year ago.</p>
