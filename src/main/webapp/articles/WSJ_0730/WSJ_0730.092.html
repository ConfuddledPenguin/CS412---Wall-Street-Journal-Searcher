	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- A union representing producers, news writers,
engineers and technicians at National Broadcasting Co.
overwhelmingly rejected a four-year contract for the second
time since April.
   A spokesman for the union, the National Association of
Broadcast Employees and Technicians, said it hoped to have
further negotiations with NBC, a unit of General Electric Co.
NBC had no immediate comment.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The vote was 1,290 to 516 to reject NBC's latest offer.
The previous contract expired March 30. No strike vote has
been taken. The union went on a 17-week strike against NBC in
1987. The main issue involves jurisdiction over people hired
by the day rather than on a full-time basis.</p>
