	<p class="article-leader">Thank you for the interview with Saddam Hussein, president
of Iraq ("Dictator Speaks," page one, June 28). It provided
Arab insights into the Middle East situation that are usually
not carried by other major American newspapers. You are to be
commended for providing readers with the other side of the
story.
   President Hussein's suggestion that the U.S. lend atomic
weapons to Iraq is of interest. Mutually assured destruction
may be the only effective way to prevent aggression in that
part of the world.</p>
