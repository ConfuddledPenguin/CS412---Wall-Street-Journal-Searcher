	<p class="article-leader">Citizens First Bancorp Inc., Glen Rock, N.J., reported a
$34.5 million second-quarter loss and predicted a $15 million
to $17 million deficit for the year because of a large
increase in its reserve for possible losses on bad loans.
   The quarterly loss equals $1.61 a share. It had net income
of $9.2 million, or 43 cents a share, a year earlier.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>For all of 1989, the banking concern earned $37.2 million,
or $1.73 a share. Citizens expects to return to profitability
in 1991, Chairman Richard G. Kelley said.</p>
<p>The $70 million increase in the loan-loss reserve was
required after a routine examination by the comptroller of
the currency, Mr. Kelley said.</p>
<p>"The increasingly stringent regulatory banking environment
nationwide is now penetrating our region, requiring banks to
add to loan-loss reserves because of the widespread downturn
in the real estate industry," he said. But Mr. Kelley
described Citizens' loan portfolio and cash flows as "very
strong."</p>
<p>In American Stock Exchange composite trading Friday,
Citizens closed at $8.75, up 12.5 cents.</p>
