	<p class="article-leader">Thorn EMI PLC of Britain, a music, home-appliance rental
and lighting concern, is being hurt by soft domestic consumer
demand and stiff competition in some product areas world-wide
and expects weak first-half earnings, Colin Southgate,
chairman and chief executive officer, said.
   But Mr. Southgate told shareholders at the annual meeting
that Thorn should show improved earnings for fiscal 1991. For
the year ended March 31, Thorn had pretax profit of #318
million ($576.9 million), up 9.8% from a year earlier.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Thorn has been selling interests that it considers to be
outside its mainstream businesses. Thorn recently said it is
holding talks to sell its Holophane S.A. pressed glass
subsidiary and in May said it was negotiating the sale of its
lighting unit to GTE Corp., Stamford, Conn.</p>
<p>Both of Thorn's two main businesses, recorded music and
appliance rentals, "are performing well on a world-wide basis
and in line with plan," Mr. Southgate said.</p>
