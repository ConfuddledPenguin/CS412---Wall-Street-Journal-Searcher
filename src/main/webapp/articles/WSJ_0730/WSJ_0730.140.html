	<p class="article-leader">JAKARTA, Indonesia -- America's Southeast Asian allies
were publicly critical when the U.S. decided to begin talks
with Vietnam on Cambodia, but privately most favor the
dialogue and hope it will be expanded.
   As they watch the sweeping changes taking place across the
world, the six members of the Association of Southeast Asian
Nations, or Asean, ending their annual meeting here, believe
that their long-term stability will be served best by a
permanent U.S. diplomatic and security presence in the
region. This consensus view emerged in a series of interviews
with Asean delegates, who spoke on the condition that they
not be identified. They see the talks as a test of the Bush
administration's willingness to become actively engaged in
solving Southeast Asia's problems.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Although Asean members were angered by the shift in U.S.
policy, announced earlier this month, they recognize that a
U.S.-Vietnamese dialogue is a necessary element for ending
the conflict in Cambodia. And if the dialogue were widened,
it also could help resolve the equally nettlesome problem of
the refugees streaming into Asean states from Vietnam and
Cambodia.</p>
<p>This sentiment was underscored by Indonesia's foreign
minister, Ali Alatas. Mr. Alatas was asked by reporters
whether he favored the expansion of U.S.-Vietnamese talks on
Cambodia into a more comprehensive dialogue. He replied,
"That would be fine. If it is positive, why not?"</p>
<p>The U.S. opposes the involuntary return of the boat people
who have fled Vietnam; the Asean states want to return the
increasing numbers who left to seek better economic
opportunities and therefore aren't political refugees fleeing
persecution. The Asean ministers, in a joint statement, said
that they "deeply regretted" that both the U.S. and Vietnam
oppose involuntary repatriation without providing
satisfactory alternatives.</p>
<p>But beyond solving these two immediate problems, which
dominated last week's meeting, most Asean members were
encouraged by the U.S. policy shift because they believe the
U.S. ultimately must normalize its relations with Vietnam if
it is to help reduce regional tensions that have existed
since the end of the Vietnam War.</p>
<p>Secretary of State James Baker, at Asean's closing news
conference, said normalization of U.S. relations with Vietnam
won't happen soon. But he assured Asean that the U.S. "has
been, and we certainly intend to remain, fully engaged as a
partner in the Pacific working with our friends and allies to
expand our common interests here."</p>
<p>By working collectively, the 23-year-old Asean
association, made up of the "dominoes" that the U.S. once
feared would fall to communist aggression, has succeeded in
getting the world's attention on such problems as Cambodia
and the Vietnamese boat people. Now, however, Asean is
concerned that it is being overshadowed by the transformation
under way in Eastern Europe that has preoccupied Washington
and the West. The Asean nations -- Thailand, Indonesia,
Malaysia, Singapore, Brunei and the Philippines -- want the
West's continuing attention both for economic and security
reasons.</p>
<p>In remarks welcoming the U.S. and other industrialized
nations to a meeting that customarily follows the Asean
members' session, Mr. Alatas, the Indonesian foreign
minister, voiced the association's "genuine and justified
apprehension that financial, investment and trade flows of
considerable magnitude from the developed West might now be
rechanneled to Eastern Europe."</p>
<p>And although the superpower confrontation is diminishing,
Asean nations still have deep concerns about regional
rivalries. According to a delegate from one of the
industrialized nations attending the session, in an unusual
outburst during a closed meeting on security issues,
Malaysia's foreign minister expressed fear that Japan would
replace the Soviet Union as a major threat to the region. A
senior Asean official separately said that the group's
members are worried that a preoccupied America might make
Japan its "proxy" in the area.</p>
<p>In meetings here, according to an Indonesian Asean
delegate, Mr. Baker gave Asean members the impression that if
Hanoi cooperates, the U.S.-Vietnam dialogue would be
"irreversible." A senior State Department official added that
the Asean representatives recognized that "the overture to
Vietnam, if the Vietnamese respond positively, creates some
interesting possibilities for dealing with the larger
problems in Indochina."</p>
<p>But Asean members still aren't sure about a long-term U.S.
commitment. One delegate expressed concern that U.S. policy
is "fickle," often reflecting short-term U.S. domestic
considerations. They say the decision to begin talking to
Hanoi and to drop support at the United Nations for an
Asean-backed coalition that includes the Khmer Rouge, which
slaughtered one million people when it ruled Cambodia, was
driven largely by mounting congressional opposition.</p>
<p>Secretary Baker appeared to assuage much of the anger here
about the Cambodia decision by emphasizing that the U.S. and
Asean share the same goals. But he was less successful in
winning support for the U.S. refugee policy.</p>
<p>Mr. Baker noted during the meeting here that the U.S.
underwrites a substantial part of the cost of maintaining the
refugees and is pledged to allow half the refugees into the
U.S. He warned that "critical finger-pointing" would only
jeopardize these cooperative arrangements.</p>
<p>Mr. Baker also announced that the U.S. would accept a
U.N.-proposed, somewhat vague, new category of returnees. But
a State Department aide conceded that, despite lengthy
discussions during several days of meetings here, the problem
"remains a very difficult issue."</p>
