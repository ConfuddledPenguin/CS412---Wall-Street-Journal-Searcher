	<p class="article-leader">My brother and I run a small manufacturing company. Last
year we started looking for another small company to acquire
to complement our product line. It sounded easy enough. And
as we entered the world of corporate takeovers, exciting
imagery beckoned.
   There would surely be streams of phone calls from
impeccably credentialed professionals giving us first crack
at the very best deals, all with a decade or more of
carefully audited financial statements. We would soon find
the perfect company at an attractive price. And, after a few
hours of cordial negotiations, there would be boatloads of
cash for us to divide up through the cigar smoke when the
deal was done. We also envisioned getting great mileage at
cocktail parties by mentioning, "Well, right now we're
working on a deal to acquire another company." That's more
impressive than "Well, right now we're repaving the parking
lot."</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>But as we reluctantly suspected, reality doesn't quite
jibe with expectations when one tries to find a small company
to buy. What follows is a travelogue of some of the fun we've
had along the way.</p>
<p>So-called business brokers are an unavoidable pothole in
the road to buying a small business. Many of these characters
have apparently gone through a rigorous training program
comparable in scope to a notary public. Put a silk tie on a
used car salesman, and you have a business broker. My
favorite sales pitch from a broker is the "you can easily
double sales" routine. It goes something like this:</p>
<p>The owner was happy with the level of business he had, and
could have expanded the business with very little effort but
he simply didn't want to. Therefore, a buyer can come in and
easily double sales. Naturally, the lazy owner fully expects
you to compensate him for the work he didn't do, so the
asking price reflects the doubling of sales.</p>
<p>These deals get a quick, "No, thanks." If I want to easily
double my investment, I go to the stock market. Or the
commodities market, where I can easily triple my investment.</p>
<p>Some business brokers require a potential buyer to put up
a cash "deposit" before he is permitted to dig through
financial statements. The broker keeps the money in escrow
and if anything is later found to reduce the value of the
business below the asking price (perish the thought), the
buyer theoretically will get some money back. This is
probably a screening method so brokers can be assured of
dealing with buyers who are more stupid than they are.</p>
<p>Imagine if this were done in other industries. Looking at
houses? Hand the realtor a cashier's check before you walk
through that door. A car? Cash up front before the test
drive. Don't worry, we'll keep your money in a real safe
place.</p>
<p>Business brokers have also taught us a curious definition
of "net cash flow." This usually turns out to be earnings
before interest, taxes, depreciation and all of the owner's
and family members' salary and benefits. Not much of anything
is netted out, actually. This means that if you work for
free, pay no taxes and secure an acquisition loan at 0%
interest, you will pocket 100 grand. But in the real world,
darn it, inconveniences like salaries, taxes and interest
expenses tend to occur. One broker told me that ideally we
would buy a company with money we already had so we could
save the interest costs of a loan. Hey, why didn't I think of
that?</p>
<p>Frequently one gets to deal directly with the owner of a
small business, which can be even worse than working with a
broker. With these opportunities (and the term is used
loosely) about the most one can hope for in a financial
statement is that the balance sheet addition is correct.
Sometimes for the buyer's edification there is also an income
statement in the form of a one- or two-year-old handwritten
tax return. CPAs? Forget it. These statements are usually
cranked out by a "preparer," outside bookkeeper or owner's
spouse who's good at ciphering.</p>
<p>Small business owners often like to use the "MMM" method
of business valuation. MMM, or Make Me a Millionaire,
determines the asking price of a business by multiplying the
number of owners by $1 million. Some astute sellers use the
more complex COMBAT method (Clear One Million Bucks After
Tax), in which the asking price is grossed up by capital
gains taxes, commissions and whatnot so the lucky seller will
indeed pocket a million big ones after the sale. Any
correlation between the MMM and COMBAT methods and actual
value is purely coincidental.</p>
<p>Sometimes a seller will try to justify an exorbitant
asking price by the more-than-meets-the-eye approach. With a
sincere look, the owner will confide that the business really
makes a lot more money than what is shown on the statements,
but he or she wants to keep taxes down so not everything gets
reported. "You see, I lie to the IRS, but you're my friend
and I'm telling you the truth," says the person you just met
30 minutes ago.</p>
<p>The two-other-people negotiating ploy is another whopper
used by business owner/sellers. Without fail, every time we
look at a company we are informed that two other people are
also looking at the deal. In other words, we'd better hurry
up and buy it because one of those two people might snap it
up first. I'm getting the suspicion that those two other
people we keep hearing about are actually the same two people
each time -- professional window shoppers whose very presence
makes buyers across the land whip out their checkbooks.</p>
<p>We haven't found the right deal yet. Still, we continue to
look, like the proverbial optimistic boy who digs in the pile
of manure convinced that there's a pony in there somewhere.
So for now, it's back to work. At least we still get to tell
people "Well, right now we're working on this acquisition
deal . . ."</p>
