	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- Until now, the world trade negotiations
involving 105 nations in Geneva have been uneventful.
   And negotiators, working under a Dec. 3 deadline, haven't
yet tackled the many issues concerning the future shape of
the world's trading system.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Instead, in Geneva and elsewhere, officials of major
trading nations and others have been playing what Arthur
Dunkel, the director-general of the General Agreement on
Tariffs and Trade calls a game of "hide-and-seek."</p>
<p>At the conclusion of a meeting of trade negotiators
Thursday, Mr. Dunkel warned that such tactics pose a serious
risk that the Uruguay Round of world trade talks, launched in
Uruguay nearly four years ago, might fail.</p>
<p>"None of us can afford the disruption in the flow of
goods, services and investment that failure would entail,"
said the former Swiss diplomat, who isn't given to
exaggerated comments on trade issues.</p>
<p>"We must," he said, "have a radically changed and more
urgent approach to the task before us."</p>
<p>The reports of negotiating groups in many different
sectors of the trade talks represent a "compendium of
positions, rather than draft agreements," Mr. Dunkel told
high-level representatives of GATT member countries, in
proposing a series of deadlines for resolving differences
over the next four months.</p>
<p>There are, said Mr. Dunkel, only about 15 "working weeks"
remaining to wrap up agreements on a new set of international
trade rules covering agriculture, services, textiles, GATT
disputes-settlement mechanisms and many other issues.</p>
<p>By late September or early October, the most ambitious
effort since the end of World War II to write new
international trade rules may have to be scaled back in order
for trade ministers to proclaim the Uruguay Round a "success"
late this year.</p>
<p>In Geneva last week, there had appeared to be a strong and
growing sense of frustration about the current state of
affairs in the Uruguay Round talks, yet not enough
hand-wringing to upset the traditional August vacations of
government officials in many countries.</p>
<p>The U.S., the European Community and other participants in
the world trade talks are slated to resume negotiations in
the week of Aug. 27 on the toughest unresolved problem,
agricultural reforms. But a senior U.S. official predicted
the "big fight" on that could come in Geneva during the month
of September.</p>
<p>Without an agreement on agriculture, involving commitments
by the industrial nations to reduce their farm-export
subsidies and open markets, the prospects are that many other
commodity-exporting countries will conclude that the Uruguay
Round was a failure.</p>
<p>Some representatives of developing nations had anticipated
that this "big fight" would take place last week in Geneva,
with hard bargaining and "real results." Rubens Ricupero, of
Brazil, complained that last week's meeting in Geneva was
largely a waste of time, with delegates representing Third
World nations having "nothing to do but stand around."</p>
<p>Despite the uncertain prospects for the world trade talks,
some veterans in the international trade bureaucracy say it
isn't unusual for the situation to look pretty grim several
months before the wind-up of such negotiations.</p>
<p>Almost everything will fall in place, they predict, in the
last few weeks of the negotiations in Geneva or during the
windup meeting of trade ministers in Brussels in early
December.</p>
