	<p class="article-leader">Lloyds Bank PLC posted first-half pretax profit of #408
million ($740 million), nearly five times that of the
year-earlier period, when profit was curbed by extensive
Third World loan provisions.
   Pretax profit for first half of 1989 was #93 million,
largely reflecting the British bank's #483 million charge to
cover loans to less developed countries.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>In the latest half, Lloyds reduced such charges to #66
million. The latest charges, the bank said, were used to
cover unpaid interest on loans, primarily to Brazil and
Argentina.</p>
