	<p class="article-leader">Machine tool orders placed with U.S. producers rebounded
in June from weak May levels and were 9.1% above June 1989,
as durable-goods makers continue to buy machinery to improve
their productivity.
   U.S. machine tool plants received $262.7 million of orders
last month, up from $240.7 million a year earlier, according
to NMTBA -- The Association for Manufacturing Technology, a
McLean, Va., trade group. May bookings had dropped to $206.5
million, but industry executives said then that underlying
demand appeared to be stronger than that figure indicated.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>For the second quarter, orders were up 10% from a year
earlier and 15% from the first period, according to NMTBA
figures.</p>
<p>Machine tool distributors, who sell imported as well as
domestic machines, had an 11% order decline in June from a
year earlier, according to the American Machine Tool
Distributors' Association in Rockville, Md. However,
distributor orders this year have bounced around from month
to month. As May orders were unusually high, it's unlikely
that the June drop is the start of a basic trend.</p>
<p>"Spending on machine tools is still strong," said Robert
A. Gale, AMTDA president. However, demand varies widely among
industry groups and geographic regions, he said.</p>
<p>Machine tools are sophisticated partsmaking machines,
including machining centers, lathes and metal-forming
presses, and are bought mainly by factories that produce
autos, aircraft, machinery and other durable goods.</p>
<p>Producers of commercial aircraft and machinery have been
major purchasers this year, but a range of other
manufacturers are ordering also. One Midwestern producer, for
instance, reports that it recently received sizable orders
from makers of air-conditioning compressors.</p>
<p>Machine tool orders have slowed in July, some producers
report, but they note that July normally is a weak month for
the industry. Many machine tool plants close for two weeks of
vacation in July, as do the factories of some customers. Even
at plants that don't close, many executives take vacations
and decisions on orders aren't made.</p>
<p>Orders have slowed for both lathes and machining centers,
says Robert J. Siewert, president and chief executive officer
of Monarch Machine Tool Co., Sidney, Ohio. "We're hoping it's
only temporary, but we'll have to wait a while to find out."</p>
<p>Machine tool makers that depend heavily on the auto
industry report that automotive spending programs are being
deferred, but few are being canceled. The auto makers
reported sharply lower second-quarter profits, mainly because
of lower volume. Uncertainty about which models to produce in
light of tightening government regulations on air pollution
and fuel economy is another reason for delay.</p>
<p>Impending labor negotiations in the auto industry also
have contributed to the uncertainty. Auto makers don't want
to buy a lot of machinery just before a strike.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the auto companies will use the promise of
additional investment as a lever in local plant bargaining,
says one machinery producer. Local union officers will be
told that the plant that is the most accommodating on work
rules and other local issues will have the best chance to get
new equipment and the production jobs that go with it.</p>
<p>"Automotive orders have been weak lately, but quoting
activity is very high," says one machine tool executive who
sells mainly to the auto industry. "We aren't extremely
concerned," he says, because there appears to be a lot of
business to be placed once labor contracts are signed.</p>
<p>The auto makers are ordering some machinery, of course.
Masco Machine Inc., Cleveland, says its orders are running
about the same as a year ago, with demand for both Masco's
specialized flexible machining systems and its precision
finishing equipment holding up well. "This is unique
equipment used for automatic transmissions and other
automotive parts," says John W. Fedor, president, adding that
General Motors Corp., Ford Motor Co. and Chrysler Corp. all
have placed orders recently.</p>
<p>June orders for lathes, grinders, milling machines,
machining centers, boring mills and other machines to shape
metal by cutting were $186 million, the NMTBA said, up 17%
from $158.9 million a year earlier. They jumped 35% from
May's poor total of $137.8 million.</p>
<p>Domestic producers of metal-forming presses and other
machines to shape metal with pressure received $76.7 million
of orders in June, which was down 6.4% from $81.9 million a
year earlier but 12% higher than May's $68.7 million.</p>
<p>Machine tool shipments by U.S. plants totaled $350.2
million last month, up 6.9% from $327.6 million a year
earlier, the NMTBA said. The industry's backlog of unfilled
orders at the end of June totaled $1.56 billion, the NMTBA
said, down 14% from the first of the year.</p>
