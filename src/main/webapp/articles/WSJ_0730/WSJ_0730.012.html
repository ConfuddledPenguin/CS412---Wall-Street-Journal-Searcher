	<p class="article-leader">IRVINE, Calif. -- Western Digital Corp.'s net income more
than doubled in the fourth quarter ended June 30 to $9.5
million, or 32 cents a share, from $4.3 million, or 15 cents
a share, a year earlier.
   Revenue rose 21% to $293.9 million from $243.5 million.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Western Digital said the improved results were spurred by
a large order for disk drives in its storage products
division.</p>
<p>For the year, net fell 29% to $24.2 million, or 82 cents a
share, from $34.3 million, or $1.18 a share, in fiscal 1989.
Revenue rose 8% to $1.07 billion from $992.1 million.</p>
<p>Roger W. Johnson, Western Digital chairman, president and
chief executive officer, attributed the year to year drop to
poor first-quarter results. He said results in the quarter
were hurt by hurricane damage to a company plant in Puerto
Rico, as well as a rapid change in graphics technology that
damped sales of the company's graphic boards when
accompanying new monitors were in short supply.</p>
<p>The company's storage products unit, which represents
about 75% of Western Digital's business, has helped bring
earnings back up. The unit, which manufactures storage
controllers, chips, and disk drives, secured a $38 million
order for intelligent disk drives -- its largest ever for
those drives -- in the fourth quarter.</p>
<p>Western Digital also reached development agreements with
International Business Machines Corp., Mr. Johnson said.
Terms of the agreements weren't disclosed.</p>
<p>Separately, Western Digital named Kathryn A. Braun,
formerly senior vice president and general manager of storage
products, executive vice president.</p>
<p>In her new post, Ms. Braun, 39 years old, will oversee the
company's move toward so-called "interarchitecture" --
designing, developing and marketing complete packages of
storage and microprocessor products.</p>
