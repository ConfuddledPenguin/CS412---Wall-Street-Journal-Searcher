	<p class="article-leader">World oil prices surged again on panic and some
speculative buying that began in Asia and Europe and spread
to the U.S.
   The price increase, sparked by growing pessimism over the
Persian Gulf crisis and the petroleum supply outlook for
winter, bounced some crude prices beyond $31 a barrel. The
higher prices helped some oil company stocks but contributed
to declines in U.S. stock and bond markets.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The steep rise in petroleum prices -- more than $1 a
barrel for most crudes -- came even as some small oil
exporters planned to try to follow leading members of the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries in raising
output. Trinidad, Malaysia and others were said yesterday to
be among those planning to increase output, to add to the
higher volumes already being produced by Saudi Arabia,
Venezuela and some other OPEC nations.</p>
<p>Also yesterday, Mexico said its extra 100,000 barrels a
day of oil exports will continue until the end of the year,
rather than the end of this month as originally pledged.</p>
<p>However, most non-OPEC oil producers already are believed
to be running flat out. There is considerable skepticism
whether any of them can produce much more oil, even in modest
increments. Also, there is doubt the new OPEC supplies can
replace all the oil lost from the embargo against Iraq -- or
can reach the oil market in time to fill the gap left by the
4.3 million barrels a day of former Iraqi and Kuwaiti
exports.</p>
<p>"Temporarily, there is a lag between the cutoffs {of Iraqi
and Kuwaiti oil} and the increased production," said Roger W.
Gale, president of the Washington International Energy Group,
a consulting firm. That gap is going to be showing up, he
said, in reductions in volume in the oil market, where demand
already is rising seasonally.</p>
<p>The main concern among energy watchdogs for major
oil-consuming nations, such as the Paris-based International
Energy Agency and the U.S. Department of Energy, is that the
biggest potential for tight supplies, and possibly shortages,
will be during the winter peak-use period. It could start as
early as November as the heating-oil season gets under way in
colder climates.</p>
<p>Heating oil, in fact, set yesterday's pricing pace. In
heavy U.S. futures trading, heating oil for October delivery
rose 4.87 cents a gallon to settle at 88.24 cents. Unleaded
gasoline for October delivery settled at 95.07 cents, up 2.8
cents a gallon.</p>
<p>The crude traded on the New York Mercantile Exchange,
which is similar to the benchmark West Texas Intermediate,
jumped $1.66 a barrel to settle at $31.43 for October
delivery.</p>
<p>Another wave of higher price postings swept through the
oil fields, meanwhile, with refiners generally raising the
prices they pay for West Texas Intermediate by $1.75 a
barrel, to as much as $30.</p>
<p>The gains in U.S. prices followed jumps in Asia and
Europe. Spot prices of Europe's North Sea crudes were up by
$1 to $1.20 a barrel. Some trading officials said this
underscores a shift from U.S. pricing leadership.</p>
<p>"The driving force in the markets today is in Europe and
in the Far East," said Peter Gignoux, London-based manager of
the Shearson Lehman Hutton international energy desk. He said
strong European currencies and a weak U.S. dollar -- the
currency used to price and pay for oil -- make up one reason.
Another, he said, is that European and Asian buyers expect
supply disruptions by the fourth quarter.</p>
<p>Many traders expressed surprise, nevertheless, at the high
levels oil prices are again reaching. Some look for a major
pullback, possibly as soon as today, similar to the
$4-a-barrel drop that followed the August price surge kicked
off by Iraq's invasion of Kuwait and the resulting U.S.-Iraq
armed faceoff in the Gulf region.</p>
<p>Price corrections are sure to come if supplies prove
adequate after all the talk of possible shortages. And the
higher prices are helping to bring on new supplies. Mexico
will continue its increased oil exports for the remainder of
the year "to take advantage of rising prices," Petroleos de
Mexicanos said in its announcement yesterday.</p>
<p>Charles A. Gargano, U.S. ambassador to Trinidad, said in
an interview that Trinidad is considering a 5% to 10%
increase in its production of some 150,000 barrels a day
after his request to government oil authorities.</p>
<p>"We have asked all our friends who are oil producers to
help out the situation now," he said. Any output increase
there "may be small," he said, "but it's symbolic they are
willing to try to help."</p>
