crisis and the outlook for winter supplies. Speculative
buying helped push some crude prices beyond $31 a barrel. The
jump came even as some small producers planned to follow OPEC
in raising output. Stocks fell, with the Dow Jones
industrials drop ping 31.93 points to 2596.29. Tokyo and
London shares declined as well.
