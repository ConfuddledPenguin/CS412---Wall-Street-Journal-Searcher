	<p class="article-leader">PARIS -- Rhone-Poulenc S.A. and Lafarge Coppee S.A. said
their joint subsidiary, Clause S.A., sold its wholly owned
Truffaut S.A. unit to the French trading and distribution
concern Cora-Revillon S.A.
   Terms weren't disclosed, but people close to the two
companies said the purchase price was roughly equivalent to
one year's revenue for Truffaut, or about 700 million francs
($133.9 million).</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Truffaut has a chain of garden centers throughout France
and is the leader in its sector.</p>
<p>A spokesman for Lafarge, Europe's biggest cement producer,
said the sale was in line with the stated intention of
Rhone-Poulenc and Lafarge to spin off Clause's assets that
weren't directly related to its core activity of seed
production.</p>
<p>Separately, state-owned Rhone-Poulenc said it intends to
sell its polyvinyl chloride operations in Spain to Atochem
S.A., a unit of the French state-controlled oil company
Societe Nationale Elf Aquitaine.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, Rhone-Poulenc said its first-half group
profit fell 14% because of the strength of the French franc
and economic austerity in Brazil.</p>
