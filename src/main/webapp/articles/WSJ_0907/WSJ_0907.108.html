	<h3>Oil Industry Maps Strategy to Combat Spills, Leaving Alaska Out of the Picture</h3>

	<p class="article-leader">After a year of study, the oil industry yesterday unveiled
a detailed $800 million, five-year program to improve its
ability to fight catastrophic oil spills off the U.S. coast.
   But the plan, which will create five regional response
centers nationwide, doesn't provide for such a center in
Alaska, the site of the worst oil spill in U.S. waters. And
that leaves Alaskan officials cold. "It's ludicrous not to
locate one of the primary response centers in Alaska," said
Terence O'Malley, spokesman for Alaska Gov. Steve Cowper.
"Alaska, which provides 25% of U.S. oil production, has more
coastline than the rest of the U.S. combined."</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The program creates two organizations. The Marine Spill
Response Corp., a privately financed non-profit group, will
be responsible for cleaning up any huge oil spills occurring
in the lower 48 states. The Marine Preservation Association,
composed of twenty oil companies and a pipeline company, will
use the services of the Response Corp. and provide the
funding for the organization. The cost to the membership,
which is expected to grow to include terminal and shipping
operators, will be based on the quantities of oil they handle
in the waters covered by the plan.</p>
<p>The newly created agencies replace the Petroleum Industry
Response Organization, formed by the industry several months
after the tanker Exxon Valdez rammed an underwater reef in
Alaskan waters last year, causing the largest oil spill in
U.S. history. At that time, the industry had projected that
creation of a nationwide response network would cost $250
million and take about a year. Officials of the Response
Corp. now project it will take about 30 months to get the
centers established and equipment in place.</p>
<p>The new estimates project sharply higher costs to get the
new program off the ground, because "the industry initially
reacted in crisis mode," said G. Stephen Duca, vice president
of readiness for the Response Corp. "It hadn't had the
opportunity to check the prices of things when it made the
projection."</p>
<p>For example, Mr. Duca said, the industry had originally
assumed that there were enough existing vessels and barges
for their needs. However, when they checked, they found that
few were available for charter or lease, so 16 vessels and 22
barges will have to be built. Of the $800 million allotted,
$315 million will go toward the construction of boats and
purchase of equipment.</p>
<p>The Response Corp., which will employ nearly 400 people
and be based in Washington, is being designed to manage large
spills of as much as 216,000 barrels. It would not respond to
small spills unless local contractors and cooperatives
responsible for handling them are unable to.</p>
<p>The plan puts regional centers in the New York-New Jersey
area; Port Everglades, Fla.; Lake Charles, La.; Port Heuneme,
Calif.; and Seattle. Each regional center will have four to
six areas where equipment and sometimes vessels and personnel
will be located.</p>
<p>Alaskan officials say the plan is exactly what's needed to
combat huge spills, and with Alaska's vast coastline, those
officials want to be part of that program. But, according to
Mr. Duca, some state regulations passed earlier this year
stand in the way of a regional center in Alaska.</p>
<p>Mr. Duca said that the industry found the liability issue
in Alaska especially troubling. Alaska's oil-spill laws now
have a clause that provides for damage claims without proof
of gross negligence. It also demands that cleanup crews be
able to respond within 72 hours to spills 50% bigger than the
Exxon Valdez, he said. "Nobody can reasonably meet a 72-hour
deadline for a 300,000-barrel spill," Mr. Duca said.</p>
<p>In an announcement, officials of the Response Corp. said
that they intend to have "an appropriate response and cleanup
role in Alaska." But they added that the role "is not yet
fully defined."</p>
<p>Recently passed federal oil spill legislation limits
liability but doesn't pre-empt some state laws -- including
Alaska's -- that don't limit liability. Mr. Duca said the new
corporation is currently holding talks with some of these
states in efforts to have them adjust their regulations to
the new federal standard. "We need constructive dialogue," he
said.</p>
<p>Currently, Alaska must depend on cleanup plans implemented
by Alyeska Pipeline Co. And in case of a severe crisis, the
state could get additional assistance from the regional
center to be established near Seattle. But "Seattle is pretty
far from Prince William Sound," said Gary Hayden, deputy
commissioner of the Alaska Department of Environmental
Conservation.</p>
<p>Alyeska, which is responsible for handling spills in
Prince William Sound only, has beefed up its response
capability since its poor performance during the Exxon Valdez
disaster. But asked whether Alyeska's ability to respond to a
giant spill is now sufficient, Mr. Hayden said, "Not today,
it isn't."</p>
