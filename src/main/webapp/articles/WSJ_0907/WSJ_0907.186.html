	<p class="article-leader">Football season is upon us again, so brace for the
familiar cliches. We will hear of players who "give 110%" and
others who have a "nose for the football." There will be
quarterbacks with "guns for arms" throwing to receivers who
aren't afraid to "go into traffic" (watch that taxi]). We
will meet coaches who "know their X's and O's" better than
some of their players know their ABCs.
   One cliche, however, deserves more careful consideration.
When we are told that today's players are "bigger, faster and
stronger" than those of any previous era, we should nod our
heads affirmatively, and sadly.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The "bigger" part of that proposition should be obvious to
anyone who has watched the TV player introductions during
recent-year autumn Saturday or Sunday afternoons, but one
group has seen fit to quantify it. The College Football
Association, a frankly named assemblage of institutions that
have banded together to promote their interests in the sport,
surveyed the rosters of eight major football factories, uh,
schools, at 10-year intervals and found, among other things,
that their linemen grew from an average of 72.9 inches tall
and 201 pounds in 1959 to 75.3 inches and 253 pounds in 1989.</p>
<p>National Football League figures show that the average
size of all its players increased to 6-foot-2 and 231 pounds
last year from 6-1 1/2 and 216 in 1958. But they contained no
breakdown by positions, so to focus on offensive linemen, the
true big 'uns, I phoned the Chicago Bears, my friendly,
neighborhood team.</p>
<p>They couldn't find their rosters from 1958 or 1959, but
came up with one for 1960, which I thought was close enough.
It showed that Bear offensive linemen that year weighed an
average of 239 pounds, against 275 for members of last year's
squad. The biggest fella on the 1960 Chicago line weighed 255
pounds. The smallest of his 1989 counterparts tipped the
scales at 260.</p>
<p>For the "faster-stronger" part, as well as an explanation
of what's behind the quantum-leap weight boost of the
linemen, et al., I spoke with Frank Katch, professor of
exercise science at the University of Massachusetts at
Amherst. He's eminently qualified to comment on these
matters, having studied, and served as a fitness consultant
to, various NFL teams over the years.</p>
<p>Katch had two things to say in preamble. One was that most
football players he knew were "real athletes," unlike some
others he could name. "I was in a group that studied the
Boston Red Sox baseball team in the early 1980s," he says. "I
was in my 40s, but I could do more situps than anyone on the
entire Sox pitching staff."</p>
<p>His other view, expressed wryly, was that human evolution
has not advanced sufficiently in the last couple dozen years
to account for the football players' weight gains. "Intensive
weight lifting, increased food intake, and, in some cases,
steroid use, starting at the high school level, account for
it," says he.</p>
<p>He adds: "I've heard about the steroid testing programs in
the colleges and pros, but I'm not convinced they're
effective. I'll believe it when I see the weight and strength
figures coming down."</p>
<p>Katch's Exhibit A in the faster-stronger category is
Renaldo Turnbull, a 6-foot-5, 255-pound rookie outside
linebacker for the NFL New Orleans Saints, who, the professor
notes, isn't a steroid user as far as he knows. Before the
1990 draft, in which Turnbull was a first-round choice, Katch
subjected the former U. of West Virginia athlete to a number
of strength tests, including vertical leaps off of a
computerized force plate. He found Turnbull's performance to
be "off the charts" in comparison with past footballers.</p>
<p>Then he weighed Turnbull in a water tank, and found his
"lean-body weight," defined as muscle and bone minus fat, to
be 225 pounds. That, he says, was four pounds heavier than
the average total weight of the seven linebackers from the
1979 Dallas Cowboys, who, incidentally, won the NFC's Eastern
Division title.</p>
<p>"Ten years ago, there was no way anyone weighing 255
pounds could be an outside linebacker in the NFL," Katch
declares. "We're talking about an awesome change here -- it
would be like seeing a 6-foot-4 female gymnast. The explosive
power of guys like Turnbull is unprecedented."</p>
<p>And that, in turn, brings us to the sad part, the wear and
tear caused by -- and to -- these bigger, stronger, faster
footballers. "Football has always been tough physically, but
the conditions of today's game are making it tougher," says
former player Ron Mix. "I'm afraid that a lot of the players
will be paying a price for their participation many years
down the road."</p>
<p>Mix was an NFL offensive lineman for 12 seasons ending in
1971, and performed well enough to be elected to the league's
Hall of Fame. Now he's a San Diego lawyer, and part of his
practice is representing retired players in workmen's
compensation claims for athletics-related injuries. He
reports that 50% disabilities for things like back, hip,
knee, neck and shoulder injuries are common in the group, and
that total disability for physical work "isn't rare."</p>
<p>And that might not be the worst of it. Mix, 52, says that
while there are insufficient numbers for proper statistics,
anecdotal information suggests that football veterans might
lose as many as 10 years off their normal life expectancies.
"Too many ex-players are dying in their 40s and 50s for it to
be accidental," he says. "It's pretty scary."</p>
<p>He continues: "There's no mystery what's behind it. You've
got men who are too heavy for their bodies playing a
much-longer schedule than in the past, in hotter weather, and
on a lot of artificial turf, which is just a sheet of plastic
over concrete. And unless things have changed that I don't
know about, you've still got widespread steroid use, with all
its health dangers. It's not a good prescription for
longevity.</p>
<p>"You can blame the clubs for creating the conditions, or
the players for allowing them," he concludes. "Either way,
it's nothing to cheer about."</p>
