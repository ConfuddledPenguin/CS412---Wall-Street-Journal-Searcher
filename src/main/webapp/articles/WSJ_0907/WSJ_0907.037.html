	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- Fitchburg Gas & Electric Light Co. said its
board authorized the company's management to explore several
alternatives to a proposed buy-out by Eastern Utilities
Associates, including a merger or business combination with a
third party.
   In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission,
the Fitchburg, Mass.-based company said it may engage in
discussions with third parties. These discussions could lead
to negotiations with respect to a merger, leveraged buy-out,
recapitalization, restructuring, the sale of debt or equity,
or a major acquisition, the company said.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The board's decision came at a Sept. 5 meeting, after
Fitchburg's independent committee reaffirmed its earlier
decision to reject Eastern Utilities's offer. Eastern
Utilities earlier offered $36 a share for Fitchburg, and $40
a share for Unitil Corp., which agreed to merge with
Fitchburg last year.</p>
<p>The committee concluded that greater value would be
realized by remaining independent or pursuing a merger, the
company said.</p>
<p>A spokesman for Fitchburg said the latest filing will
allow the company more "flexibility" and "options" not
previously available. Fitchburg Gas & Electric Light said it
has had Merrill Lynch Capital Markets as its financial
advisor since announcing its merger agreement with Unitil
Corp. last year.</p>
