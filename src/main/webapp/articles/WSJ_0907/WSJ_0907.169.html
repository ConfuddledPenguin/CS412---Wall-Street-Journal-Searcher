	<p class="article-leader">Apple Computer Inc.'s USA division said it slashed prices
as much as 20% effective yesterday on its popular Macintosh
IIci personal computer.
   The price reduction is tied to the Cupertino, Calif.,
company's Oct. 15 introduction of three new lower-priced
personal computer models, said analyst Bruce M. Lupatkin of
Hambrecht and Quist in San Francisco.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"It's basically product positioning," Lupatkin said.</p>
<p>Apple officials denied this was the case, saying they were
simply following up on a successful marketing program two
months ago under which dealers were given flexibility in
offering discounts on the product.</p>
<p>"Since then we've seen sales of the IIci take off," said
Bob Puette, president of Apple USA.</p>
<p>The prices were slashed $1,500 on Apple's four system
configurations for the Macintosh IIci. The highest-priced
model with a 4MB RAM/SuperDrive floppy, for instance, was cut
to $5,969 from $7,469. The Macintosh IIci was introduced in
September 1989 and is considered in the middle of the
company's Macintosh line.</p>
<p>Apple Computer shares closed at $35.75, down 25 cents, in
national over-the-counter trading yesterday.</p>
