	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- A dissident group led by David C. Walentas
said it has asked the Securities and Exchange Commission to
investigate information it says casts doubt on the legitimacy
of a proposal for a business combination between Builders
Transport Inc. and Comcar Industries Inc.
   In a letter to the SEC, Mr. Walentas said a trucking
industry executive told him that he learned from a Comcar
executive that the February letter of intent between the two
companies was signed by Comcar as a favor to Charles C. Gay
Sr., chairman of Builders Transport at the time.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Mr. Walentas said in an interview that Builders Transport,
a truckload carrier based in Camden, S.C., was "trying to
repel" his group's December proposal to acquire the company
at $13 a share, or $54.6 million, which he said the company
"rejected out of hand without speaking to us."</p>
<p>Following the announcement of the Comcar proposal,
Builders Transport's common stock rose from $9.75 a share to
$13.25 a share. Builders Transport said in June that Comcar
wasn't willing to proceed with the transaction.</p>
<p>Robert Garner, general counsel of Builders Transport,
denied Mr. Walentas's allegations. "We never would have
entered into an agreement with Comcar if we had any reason to
doubt the legitimacy . . . of (Comcar's) offer," Mr. Garner
said.</p>
<p>Mr. Garner said Builders Transport is continuing
discussions with another suitor, Trism Inc., which it said is
pursuing financing for an offer.</p>
