	<p class="article-leader">TOKYO -- Japan's Kawasaki Heavy Industries Co. will
produce part of the A-321 passenger jet being developed by
European airplane manufacturing consortium Airbus Industrie,
a Kawasaki official said.
   An official contract will be signed in mid-October between
Kawasaki and British Aerospace PLC, one of Airbus Industrie's
parent companies which makes bodies for Airbus airplanes.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The A-321 jet, a long-bodied passenger jet still under
development, is scheduled for test flight in the spring of
1993 and marketing in the spring of 1994. There are more than
100 orders for the new jet so far, according to the official.</p>
<p>The new plane, with a capacity of 180 passengers, will be
made by extending the body of the company's A-320 jet on both
ends by a total of 7 meters.</p>
<p>Kawasaki will be the sole producer of skin panels to be
attached to the A-320's tail end.</p>
<p>Details of the agreement are under negotiation, the
official said.</p>
<p>The latest agreement is part of Kawasaki's business
strategy aimed at increasing sales in its private sector
division to reduce the company's dependency on the
Self-Defense Agency of Japan.</p>
<p>Demand by the agency is expected to decline in coming
years due to a world-wide trend toward disarmament. Orders
for Kawasaki's P3C anti-submarine patrol planes, for example,
are likely to fall more than 30% in the next fiscal year, the
official said.</p>
