	<p class="article-leader">U.S. property/casualty insurers saw net income plunge 21%
to $5.2 billion during the first half of 1990 as lower
premium rates and higher underwriting losses continued to
plague the industry.
   Because of the price war that has gripped the
property/casualty industry for nearly four years now,
premiums grew just 3.8% in the first half to $105.3 billion.
However, underwriting losses jumped 29% to $10.6 billion from
$8.2 billion in the 1989 first half.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Pretax operating profit fell 23% to $5.1 billion from $6.7
billion a year earlier.</p>
<p>Sean Mooney, an economist with the Insurance Information
Institute, said the financial results for the
property/casualty insurers deserve a "C-minus" because of
decreasing after-tax profits and relatively low rate of
return. "The industry continues to muddle along, with no
clear sign of a financial upturn."</p>
<p>He said the second-quarter results were pretty telling,
when net fell 3.6% to $2.7 billion for the industry. Relative
to premiums, after-tax earnings in the second quarter stood
at 5.1%. That means that for every premium dollar, the
industry's profit was five cents. Mr. Mooney noted that such
results were lower than the profit margin for most industries
of seven cents on the sales dollar.</p>
<p>The industry data, compiled by the Insurance Services
Office and the National Association of Independent Insurers,
includes results for 96% of the property/casualty companies
in the country.</p>
