	<p class="article-leader">The New York Consumer Protection Board is asking state
regulators to cut the rates of Nynex Corp.'s New York
Telephone unit by $395 million and to extend the
investigation into phone company overpayments on purchases
made through other Nynex companies.
   At the same time, the New York attorney general is urging
the Public Service Commission to reject the company's request
for a rate increase of about $825 million that would go into
effect in January 1991. Attorney General Robert Abrams also
wants New York Telephone penalized for "poor service and
inadequate maintenance" and urged the PSC to cut current
rates by at least $9.8 million, reflecting improper charges
to customers for charitable contributions. New York
Telephone's actual rate increase request has been estimated
at as much as $1.4 billion over the next three years.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The recommendations from the consumer agency and the
attorney general were made in briefs filed as part of a rate
case that began earlier this year. A New York Telephone
spokesman called the Consumer Protection Board recommendation
"out of touch with reality."</p>
<p>Since New York Telephone agreed to a rate moratorium four
years ago, rates have declined $467 million, the spokesman
said. Given the worsening economic conditions in the state
and increasing needs for improvements in the phone network, a
rate cut could hurt consumers and the company, he said. New
York Telephone will submit a brief today defending its rate
request.</p>
<p>Richard Kessel, executive director of the consumer agency,
urged a rate reduction of $231 million and a refund for New
York Telephone customers of $164 million. The PSC staff
earlier had recommended an $81 million rate cut.</p>
<p>The Consumer Protection Board also is seeking a management
audit by outside auditors and a self-assessment program for
New York Telephone's management as a way to "meet the
obligations of a regulated company to hold down the cost of
its monopoly services and the obligation of a competitive
firm to compete fairly in the marketplace."</p>
<p>Mr. Kessel also asked the commission to investigate New
York Telephone's construction program, saying that testimony
during recent hearings on the rate increase request "showed
that many New York Telephone construction projects are
unnecessary, overdesigned or unduly risky."</p>
<p>He further called for an extension of the investigation
into transactions involving the phone company and other Nynex
units, particularly Materiel Enterprises Co. The purchasing
unit was cited earlier this year by federal regulators for
overcharging Nynex's two phone companies for goods and
services it had provided. More recently, the rate case
brought to light a series of bawdy annual parties arranged by
a Materiel Enterprises executive, who was fired two years ago
for organizing the gatherings. The parties, nicknamed pervert
conventions, included several Materiel Enterprises managers,
employees of about 30 Nynex suppliers and prostitutes.</p>
