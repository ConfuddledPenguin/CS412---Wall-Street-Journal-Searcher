	<p class="article-leader">SEOUL, South Korea -- Senior officials from the Group of
Seven industrialized countries will meet in Paris Monday and
Tuesday to discuss the dollar's recent decline and to review
developments in the world economy, a U.S. Treasury official
said.
   The meeting comes at a time when the economic slowdown in
the U.S. has pushed the value of the dollar down sharply
against foreign currencies. The dollar-yen exchange rate, for
instance, is at its lowest level this year. The officials
will have to decide whether any action is needed to stem the
dollar's decline.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Such a gathering of the G-7 deputies is usually held prior
to the annual meetings of the International Monetary Fund and
World Bank, which this year are scheduled to take place in
Washington in late September.</p>
<p>The G-7 officials also will attend so-called "working
party three" meetings of the Paris-based Organization for
Economic Cooperation and Development, a group of 24 rich
nations, the Treasury official said. The OECD working group
meets regularly to discuss the international economy.</p>
<p>During the two sets of Paris meetings, officials are
expected to review the impact of Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion of
Kuwait on oil prices and other recent economic developments.</p>
<p>Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady is here leading a U.S.
delegation on a whistlestop to raise contributions in support
of the American-led military effort in the Persian Gulf and
for Mideast countries -- particularly Egypt, Jordan and
Turkey -- whose economies have been badly harmed by the
Persian Gulf crisis. Western officials say the United Nations
trade embargo against Iraq will be more effective if those
three countries get $3.5 billion of economic assistance.</p>
<p>The G-7 countries are the U.S., Japan, West Germany,
Britain, France, Italy and Canada.</p>
