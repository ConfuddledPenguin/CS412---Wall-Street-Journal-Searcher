	<p class="article-leader">ATLANTA -- The Centers for Disease Control said several
state health agencies have detected "unusually early and high
levels" of mosquitoes carrying viruses that cause
encephalitis, indicating "a potential risk for epidemic
transmission" to people.
   The CDC said surveillance conducted in Texas, Florida,
Massachusetts, New Jersey and New York of birds and
mosquitoes that are involved in the cyclical transmission of
the viruses signals a potential for a higher incidence of
encephalitis in humans.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"We don't want to alarm people unnecessarily," said Dr.
Ted Tsai, assistant director for science at the CDC division
of vector-borne infectious diseases in Atlanta. "To be
conservative, what we'd like to say is there is more of the
virus being transmitted in nature than is usual, so there's a
potential, or possibility, that it could lead to a higher
occurrence in people than usual."</p>
<p>The CDC said St. Louis Encephalitis, the more common type
transmitted by the mosquito vectors, is the leading cause of
epidemic encephalitis in the U.S. The last major outbreak, in
1975, resulted in nearly 3,000 cases of the disease, which
has a 7% fatality rate.</p>
<p>The CDC said various states, including Massachusetts, New
York and Florida, have already stepped up mosquito-control
efforts to battle the spread of the viruses.</p>
