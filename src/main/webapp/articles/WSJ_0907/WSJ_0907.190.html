	<p class="article-leader">LAS VEGAS, Nev. -- United Gaming Inc. reported substantial
profit declines for the fiscal fourth quarter and year, and
said it named two new senior executives as part of the
expansion of its casino and gaming-machine route businesses.
   For the fiscal fourth quarter ended June 30, the company
reported net income of $72,000, or one cent a share, compared
with $1,449,000, or 17 cents a share, a year earlier. Revenue
was $25,894,000, vs. $18,010,000 a year ago.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The quarter included $1,665,000 in charges that stemmed
from several unexpected events, including a customer's
involuntary bankruptcy filing that resulted in a charge of
$667,000 and the withdrawal from another casino project that
resulted in a charge of $630,000. The company also scrapped a
planned public financing because of poor market conditions.</p>
<p>For fiscal 1990, the company posted net of $3,895,000, or
45 cents a share, vs. $5,779,000 or 70 cents a share for the
prior fiscal year. Revenues was $90,205,000 compared with
$65,389,000 a year earlier. The company said it expects 1991
fiscal firstquarter results to be affected by lower revenue
at one casino that is being remodeled, employee severance
costs, and the elimination of some stops on its gamingmachine
route.</p>
<p>Also, Carole A. Carter, vice president, was named
president and chief operating officer. She succeeds David A.
Scheinman as president, who remains a director and
consultant. John W. Alderfer, former chief financial officer
of the Bicycle Club in Los Angeles, was named vice president
of finance and chief financial officer. He succeeds Robert E.
Huggins, who continues to head operations at the Plantation
and Mizpah sites.</p>
