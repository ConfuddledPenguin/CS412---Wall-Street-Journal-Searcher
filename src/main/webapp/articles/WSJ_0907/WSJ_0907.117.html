	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- For the first time in eleven months, the
dollar fell below 141 yen and stayed there.
   The greenback was quoted in late New York trading at
140.70 yen, off one yen from late Wednesday and its worst
North American close since Oct. 2, 1989, when it ended at
139.70 yen. Until yesterday, Wednesday's New York close had
been the dollar's lowest for 1990.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>In early trading in Tokyo Friday, the dollar was quoted at
140.45 yen, down from 141.65 yen at the close there Thursday.
Meanwhile, the U.S. currency was trading at about 1.5558
marks, down from Thursday's Tokyo close of 1.5566 marks.</p>
<p>"The bottom just dropped out of" the dollar, said Javier
Santalla, a New York trader for Nippon Credit Bank. "There
was very little fanfare."</p>
<p>Mr. Santalla and others insisted that the day's activity
was yen-based and not dollar-based. Though some speculators
got a head start on the dollar-selling they expect to be
spurred by a weak U.S. employment report today, the dollar
fell only slightly against the mark. It actually gained
against recent strong performers, such as the Swiss franc and
Canadian dollar.</p>
<p>The U.S. currency was changing hands in late New York
trading at 1.5550 marks, down from 1.5585 marks late
Wednesday in New York. It climbed to 1.2975 Swiss francs from
1.2960 francs. Sterling was trading at $1.9125, up from
$1.9043.</p>
<p>The U.S. and Japanese currencies are moving in opposite
directions along the lines of each nation's interest rates.</p>
<p>The cost of Japanese funds, especially at the long end of
the yield curve, has continued to rise following the Bank of
Japan's decision last Thursday to raise its discount rate to
6% from 5.25%. Though at the time Bank of Japan Gov. Yasushi
Mieno said the market shouldn't expect another tightening in
the near future, the central bank's refusal since then to add
enough liquidity to keep rates down has fueled doubts.</p>
<p>The result, Mr. Santalla said, is "a very strong case to
be in yen."</p>
<p>U.S. rate watchers, meanwhile, are already counting on one
round of easing by the U.S Federal Reserve and think a second
may follow right on its heels if today's jobs report is
particularly lame.</p>
<p>Already incorporated in dollar rates, said William
Sterling, an economist at Merrill Lynch, is a Fed move to
push the federal funds target rate down a quarter point to 7
3/4% from the currently assumed target of 8%. The only
question is one of timing. A weaker-than-expected report
could provoke an immediate response, he said.</p>
<p>A really bad number, Mr. Sterling said, could launch "the
beginning of a series of moves" to ease credit. That, in
turn, would "heighten concern that the U.S. is willing to
pursue a policy of dollar depreciation to invigorate the
economy."</p>
<p>Another cloud over the dollar is the federal budget
deficit. At a rally in Topeka, Kansas, yesterday, President
Bush pledged to eliminate the budget gap in five years -- or
two years later than the time frame set by the
Gramm-Rudman-Hollings law.</p>
<p>After breaking below 141 yen in early European trading,
the dollar rose above that level as New York began trading
before declining again.</p>
<p>Technical charts signaled a dollar-buying opportunity at
140.60 yen, and kept the greenback from falling further, said
Susan Stearns, a senior corporate advisor in New York for
Chicago's Harris Trust & Savings Bank.</p>
<p>Though yen-buying dominated the day, the Japanese currency
rose only marginally against its German counterpart. Less in
favor than the yen, the mark is nevertheless being supported
by a psychological floor at 90 yen and expectations that the
Bundesbank will match the recent Japanese rate increase.</p>
<p>The mark closed New York trading at 90.482 yen, down from
90.921 yen late Wednesday.</p>
<p>The Canadian dollar suffered from expectations of
interest-rate easing in its home country, falling to 86.48
U.S. cents in New York from 86.77 cents Wednesday.</p>
<p>In Europe yesterday, the dollar ended little changed from
where it began the European trading day, as dealers said
participants awaited developments on several fronts.</p>
<p>In Asia, the dollar ended active dealings mostly lower as
a brief flurry of covering short dollar positions was
overcome by bearish sentiment toward the U.S. economy. The
U.S. currency finished Thursday in Tokyo at 141.65 yen, below
142.30 yen late Wednesday.</p>
<p>News about an American in Kuwait being shot added momentum
to a round of short-covering that had gotten under way after
the dollar dropped to 141.25 yen in early Asian trading.</p>
<p>But after the wave of short-covering lifted the dollar as
high as 142.45 yen, continued pessimism about the U.S.
economy helped prompt dollar sales by life insurance
companies and other institutional investors, pushing the U.S.
currency back down.</p>
<p>Separately, on the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold
for current delivery settled at $389.70 an ounce, up $3.60.
Estimated volume was a moderate 3.7 million ounces.</p>
<p>In Hong Kong Friday, gold was quoted at $390.25 an ounce.</p>
