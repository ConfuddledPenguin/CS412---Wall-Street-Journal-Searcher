	<p class="article-leader">LOS ANGELES -- Athletic-shoe maker L.A. Gear Inc.,
breaking its recent silence on financial matters, said that
net income in its fiscal third quarter ended Aug. 31 was
lower than a year ago, despite a 40% sales rise to about $300
million.
   In the year-earlier quarter, L.A. Gear posted record
profit of $22 million, or $1.21 a share, on sales of $215
million.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>While the announcement apparently didn't contain any
surprises, analysts said they were relieved to get some hard
information. "There hasn't been much guidance on sales trends
during the quarter and estimates have varied dramatically,"
said Alice M. Ruth at Montgomery Securities Inc. in San
Francisco.</p>
<p>Analysts have slashed their profit and sales forecasts
since L.A. Gear surprised Wall Street with a 36% drop in
second-quarter profit. On June 1, the highflying shares
plunged $8.50, or 22%, on volume of 6.6 million shares after
L.A. Gear indicated that it would have its first quarterly
drop in net income in three years.</p>
<p>Kevin J. Ventrudo, chief financial officer, said the
company wanted to put out its third-quarter sales figures as
soon as they were available so that "everybody would be
working off the same page of the playbook." L.A. Gear has
been inundated recently with inquiries about sales, he said.</p>
<p>Gross incoming orders in the quarter reached $240 million,
a 15% increase over the year-ago period, L.A. Gear said. The
gross profit margin is "anticipated to be higher than in the
second quarter" when it was 34.8% "It's too early to tell" by
how much, Mr. Ventrudo said. There won't be any extraordinary
items in the quarter, he added.</p>
<p>Mr. Ventrudo said he doubted that the announcement would
significantly affect Wall Street forecasts. He said that
analysts' third-quarter sales estimates range from about $290
million to $330 million. For the full fiscal year, per-share
estimates range from about $2.30 to $3.50.</p>
<p>Gary M. Jacobson, an analyst at Kidder, Peabody & Co.,
predicted heavy volume in L.A. Gear's shares today but little
price movement. "Expectations are quite low right now and
this doesn't disappoint those low expectations," he said.</p>
<p>In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday,
L.A. Gear shares closed down 37.5 cents at $16.50. The sales
figures were released after the close of trading.</p>
<p>Mr. Jacobson said that earlier this year L.A. Gear "got
caught with too much product" as it began to lose its appeal
with customers. L.A. Gear has had to cut prices on these
older footwear styles, thereby eroding its margins.</p>
<p>L.A. Gear's newer basketball sneakers and other
"performance" shoes that compete directly with offerings from
Nike Inc. and Reebok International Ltd. haven't caught on
quickly, some analysts said. A new line advertised by singer
Michael Jackson "has been receiving mixed reviews," Mr.
Jacobson said. "The jury is still out," countered Mr.
Ventrudo.</p>
