	<p class="article-leader">Struggling Tektronix Inc. showed an earnings turnaround
during its fiscal first quarter, after reporting losses or
declining earnings since 1985.
   The Beaverton, Ore., electronics testing and measurement
concern said it earned $9.4 million, or 32 cents a share, for
the quarter ended Aug. 18, compared with a loss of $1.9
million, or six cents a share, in the year-earlier period.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The upswing comes after the concern took several
cost-cutting steps this year, including closing its
facilities in Clark County, Wash.; shutting down a plant in
Guernsey, one of the U.K.'s Channel islands, and laying off
10% of its 13,000-member work force.</p>
<p>Sales climbed 3% to $302.5 million from $294.1 million.</p>
<p>The company's shares closed yesterday at $15, up 62.5
cents, in New York Stock Exchange composite trading.</p>
