	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- The over-the-counter market sank further as
oil prices surged back above $30 a barrel.
   Traders say OTC share prices started out weak following
reports that an American hostage in Kuwait had been shot by
Iraqi forces and continued lower amid oil's implacable rise.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>On the New York Mercantile Exchange, the October futures
contract for a barrel of light sweet crude oil gained $1.66
to close at $31.43.</p>
<p>"Oil is dictating which way this market goes," says Lance
Zipper, manager of OTC trading at Kidder, Peabody & Co.</p>
<p>The Nasdaq Composite Index ended with a 3.66 point loss,
down 0.96% to 378.78. The New York Stock Exchange Composite
Index slipped more than 1%.</p>
<p>The rise in oil prices has revived some of the OTC
market's energy stocks.</p>
<p>U.S. Energy rose 1 1/8 to 10 3/8 and Hamilton Oil added 1
7/8 to 42 3/8.</p>
<p>But rising stocks were hard to find yesterday. OTC
advancers trailed decliners, 719 to 1,060. Volume rose to
98.7 million shares from Wednesday's 89 million shares.</p>
<p>Jim Bellini, director of equity trading at Dain Bosworth,
says that the selling pressure remains light, as most
investors are sitting tight with their current stock
positions.</p>
<p>But some of the big securities firms are now unabashedly
calling this a bear market, and are cautioning clients that
stock prices may slide beyond their lows hit at the end of
August.</p>
<p>Robert Salomon Jr., managing director at Salomon Brothers
Inc., says that stock prices are still too high given the
outlook for corporate profits.</p>
<p>"We anticipate a decline of 7% in S&P 500 earnings in
1991," Mr. Salomon says, with the worst of that decline
coming early in 1991 following the onset of a recession in
the fourth quarter of this year.</p>
<p>While he believes profits should snap back later in 1991,
"the earnings rebound is too far away and too tenuous to
support stock prices today," he says.</p>
<p>Mr. Salomon says he is looking for the S&P 500 Index to
fall to around the 260 level, while the Dow Jones Industrial
Average could drop as low as 2,100.</p>
<p>The S&P 500 Index fell 3.93 yesterday to 320.46, while the
the industrial average fell 31.93 to 2,596.29.</p>
<p>While Salomon Brothers doesn't have a specific outlook for
the over-the-counter market, the firm is advising its clients
to stay in the more liquid stocks.</p>
<p>JLG Industries managed to attract buyers following a
strong earnings statement. The stock rose 1 3/4 to 14 after
JLG reported fiscal fourth quarter profit of 77 cents a
share, up from 58 cents a share last year.</p>
<p>Mack Trucks added 3/8 to 6 1/8 after France's Renault
raised its tender offer price for Mack Trucks' shares to
$6.25 each from its earlier offer of $6 a share.</p>
