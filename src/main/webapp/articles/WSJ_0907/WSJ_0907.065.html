	<p class="article-leader">Shortly after Saddam Hussein invaded Kuwait, a senior U.S.
official visiting Moscow was startled to hear a Soviet
counterpart say, "This guy is another Hitler. You have to do
something about him."
   You? At this weekend's Bush-Gorbachev summit in Helsinki,
we may all learn the Soviet asking price for letting us do
something.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Nobody's talking for the record, but outlines of a
potential post-Cold War deal are apparent: Mr. Gorbachev
pulls his military advisers out of Iraq, joins the U.N.
military blockade and privately suggests he'd look the other
way if George Bush acts militarily against Saddam Hussein.</p>
<p>In a cash-pro-quo, Mr. Bush drops his objections to direct
Western aid and government credit guarantees for Moscow and
to the Soviets joining the International Monetary Fund and
World Bank. Secretary of State Baker and Commerce Secretary
Mosbacher then fly into Moscow, 15 U.S. business leaders in
tow, to symbolize George Bush's support for Mr. Gorbachev.</p>
<p>Far-fetched? Marlin Fitzwater, the White House spokesman,
tipped the U.S. handout Wednesday, saying that "Soviet
cooperation in the Gulf has impressed us to the point where
we are even more interested in being supportive economically
if we can be." This is the pre-summit carrot; let's hope the
stick will come in private Helsinki discussions.</p>
<p>Because so far, despite fulsome U.S. praise, the Soviets
are having their vodka and drinking it too. They want to join
the civilized world, but can't totally kick 40 years of Cold
War habits. They've helped by signing onto five U.N.
resolutions, but dragged their feet on using force to enforce
the embargo. Mr. Gorbachev stiffed Iraqi's smooth-talking
foreign minister on a visit to Moscow Wednesday, but a day
earlier Soviet foreign minister Shevardnadze resurrected that
diplomatic zombie, an "international conference" on Palestine
and Israel. This is sand in the gears of anti-Iraq pressure.</p>
<p>Some 1,000 Soviet military advisers -- the widely cited
figure of 200 is Soviet lowballing -- are still greasing the
Iraqi war machine to kill Americans. The Soviet excuse that
they can't leave without jeopardizing 6,000 other Russians in
Iraq is playing the Kurt Waldheim game -- every country with
hostages for itself. Even Maine Senator William Cohen, hardly
a Cold Warrior, calls it a "fig leaf."</p>
<p>"They have a real difference of opinion over there,"
explain State's Gorbapologists, plausibly enough. Pravda,
representing the Stalinist apparat, is fighting in public
with Izvestia, which speaks for Gorby. Soviet bureaucrats,
elements in the military and Arabists don't want to repudiate
decades of close ties (and weapons sales) to Iraq so easily.</p>
<p>But Stephen Sestanovich, a Sovietologist
right-from-the-start about Mr. Gorbachev, is more incisive:
"This has been the pattern of Soviet behavior under
Gorbachev. They see what the traffic will bear. Why apologize
for them?"</p>
<p>No one doubts that Mr. Gorbachev will come asking for U.S.
aid. He's desperate. He made a previous pitch before the July
economic summit in Houston, but President Bush held firm
against the Kohl-Mitterrand-Gorby pressure. Since then, bread
lines have formed in Moscow, and Boris Yeltsin is lapping his
half-reforms as the elected head of the Russian Republic.
President Gorbachev, never having run for office, badly needs
a victory in the one area he still comfortably controls --
foreign policy.</p>
<p>Mr. Gorbachev will also play his "Shatalin" card -- named
for Stanislav Shatalin, the Yeltsin ally who is offering a
500-day private-property economic cure. Gorby will tell Mr.
Bush he's committing to this radical surgery this coming
week, even though it's Mr. Yeltsin's initiative. Mr. Shatalin
has long argued that Western aid is critical to provide
consumer goods to help ease the pain caused by freeing prices
and ending subsidies. Gorby may even speak approvingly of an
ongoing IMF study of the Soviet economy -- a study sure to be
highly critical.</p>
<p>"His main argument will be that his country is getting
committed to a real move to capitalism," adds one U.S.
official and long-time Gorbo-skeptic. "This will weaken the
money-down-the-rathole argument."</p>
<p>The Soviet leader also knows that other countries have
already tapped into the anti-Iraq cash pipeline. The West
quietly came up with $2 billion for Turkey on short notice.
Egypt will get a $7 billion loan write-off. The Saudis are
receiving the latest-model U.S. tanks and planes. Mikhail the
Mendicant will ask why he can't join the queue.</p>
<p>If anyone should have an asking price on Iraq, in short,
it's George Bush, not Mikhail Gorbachev. Helsinki illustrates
the assymetry of the new summitry: The U.S. is the only
superpower, and the U.S.S.R. is along for the ride. The
Soviets can obstruct, but only at the cost of jeopardizing
their links to the West. In a sense, Mr. Bush is doing Mr.
Gorbachev a favor even by treating him as seriously as he is
with this summit.</p>
<p>So if the Soviets are serious about establishing a
post-Cold War order, they should have to choose: The West or
Saddam, the civilized world or the Butcher of Baghdad. Even a
half-friend of our enemy is no friend of ours. If U.S.
taxpayers are to help Soviet mothers buy bread, why shouldn't
Soviet boys be ready to fight with Americans in the sands of
Kuwait?</p>
