	<p class="article-leader">Financially-troubled Tucson Electric Power Co. said it
plans to ask the Arizona Corporation Commission later this
month for an 18-month surcharge of 2% in addition to a 10% to
12% increase in base electricity rates.
   The Tucson-based utility said it also will ask the
regulatory commission for permission to phase into its rate
base recovery of certain costs related to Unit 2 of the
Springerville Generating Station, which began operations in
June.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The commission previously has indicated that the plant
shouldn't be included in the utility's rate base because the
plant's power capacity isn't needed, a Tucson Electric
spokesman said, adding: "We think it is needed and we are
using some power from it."</p>
<p>Tucson Electric said its most recent rate increase,
11.85%, went into effect last October. The utility had
requested about a 20% increase. The previous increase was in
October 1983. Tucson Electric serves about 750,000 people in
the Tucson area.</p>
