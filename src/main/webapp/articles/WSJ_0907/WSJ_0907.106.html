	<p class="article-leader">SEOUL, South Korea -- The high-level government meetings
between North and South Korea, the most talking the two
nations have ever done, ended with no real agreement
yesterday. But the talks were labeled a success anyway.
   "If it was anything less than a food fight at the end, it
is a great success," one analyst said.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The talks were never billed as a prelude to German-style
reunification. The South Koreans and their allies had low
expectations going into the meeting, mainly because North
Korea has tried to avoid contact with the Seoul government.
It was the first time that the isolated and totalitarian
North Korea agreed to wide-ranging, high-level discussions
with South Korea, a nation it invaded 40 years ago and which
it still considers illegitimate.</p>
<p>North Korean government spokesman Ahn Pyong Su told
reporters, "Despite the lack of remarkable agreements, the
two sides laid the foundation for expanded dialogue by fully
presenting their positions." And President Roh Tae Woo asked
the visiting North Korean premier, Yon Hyong Muk, to carry
back the South Korean leader's request for a summit meeting
with North Korean leader Kim Il Sung to set the stage for
reunification before the end of the century.</p>
<p>"Korea cannot remain the last divided nation on Earth,
separated by cold war," the president said.</p>
<p>The meetings brought no change in the basic positions of
either side. But participants did agree in principle to
resume Red Cross talks on allowing cross-border visits by
members of families separated since the Korean War. The talks
have been suspended since December 1985.</p>
<p>In another significant move, South Korea agreed to delay
its request for its admission to the United Nations this
year, while the two sides form a panel to discuss alternative
plans for U.N. entry. Pyongyang wants the two Koreas to
occupy one seat in the U.N., alternating it between North and
South. The South considers that impractical and wants the two
countries to enter simultaneously.</p>
<p>And, in separate statements that summed up the tone for
the meetings, officials of the two sides said they also had
agreed to stop slandering each other, to recognize each
other's sovereignty, and to work toward disarming the heavily
militarized Korean peninsula.</p>
<p>The North Korean premier and a retinue of about 80 aides
and reporters were to return to Pyongyang Friday morning.</p>
<p>South Korean officials are to travel to that North Korean
capital next month for a second round of talks.</p>
<p>But despite the broad agreement to continue talking, no
one is certain that further discussions will actually take
place. Most analysts had said that North Korea came to the
talks only because the Soviet Union, its major ally,
pressured it to. And while in Seoul, the North Korean side
tried frequently to irritate the South Korean government.</p>
<p>Northern negotiators insisted on such issues as a single
U.N. seat, the removal of anti-tank barriers in the
demilitarized zone between the two countries, an end to
Seoul's joint military maneuvers with the U.S. and the
freeing of dissidents who were jailed after visiting North
Korea without South Korean government approval. "It was
almost a face-saving device on the North Koreans' part," said
Han Sung Joo, chairman of the political science department of
Korea University in Seoul.</p>
<p>The South failed to get the North to agree to greater
contact between both sides; Seoul had hoped that bringing
North Korea out of its self-imposed isolation would hasten
change there.</p>
<p>That isolation was apparent during the two days of talks.
A North Korean told a South Korean professor, who had visited
Pyongyang several times, that he was surprised by the lack of
cars and people in Seoul, an unusual observation in this city
of 15 million people and monumental traffic jams. "They were
trying hard to show they weren't impressed," said Prof. Han.
"If it was an eye-opener, they tried not to show it."</p>
