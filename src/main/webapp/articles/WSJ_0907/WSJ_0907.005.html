	<p class="article-leader">The U.S. subsidiary of Japan's Daiwa Securities Co. said
it named John H. Carlson, former president and chief
executive of Security Pacific Corp.'s securities unit, as an
executive vice president and head of a new asset-backed
securities unit.
   Asset-backed securities are fixed-income securities whose
principal and interest payments are supported by assets such
as mortgages and credit cards.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>In the past few years, the market has grown at breakneck
speed, particularly as commercial banks and finance companies
have sought to unload assets to profit quickly from loans
they have written, free up funds for other uses and meet new
international capital guidelines. The mortgage-backed
securities market totals more than $800 billion. By the end
of last year, the global market for non-mortgage asset-backed
securities had grown to $62 billion from a negligible amount
in 1985, according to IDD Information Services.</p>
<p>Saying that Mr. Carlson was always his prime candidate for
the asset-securitization job, Stephen W. Bradley, co-head of
Daiwa's capital markets operations, added, "John has intimate
knowledge of the product, from the origination point through
the structuring and analytical stages to actual sales."</p>
<p>Mr. Carlson, 40 years old, said he enjoyed working at
Security Pacific, which he joined in 1987 from Merrill Lynch
& Co. "However," he said, "my background is in the securities
business; I came to SecPac in anticipation of significant
Glass-Steagall reform which hasn't materialized, and Daiwa is
a global securities firm." For years, big money-center banks
have tried to persuade Congress to abandon or change the
Glass-Steagall Act separating commercial and investment
banking.</p>
<p>At Security Pacific, Mr. Carlson was jointly responsible
for a unit with $100 million in capital and more than $300
million in annual revenue. His unit also co-managed the
bank's first residential collateralized mortgage obligation
and a $750 million credit-card-backed transaction.</p>
<p>Mr. Carlson said he was attracted by the chance to work
for Mr. Bradley, with whom he had worked at Merrill Lynch,
and by Daiwa's reputation. "My intent is to develop an
asset-securitization business leveraging off Daiwa's strong
reputation and market share in Europe and the Far East," he
said.</p>
<p>He said he plans to begin originating asset-backed
securities both in the U.S. and overseas as well as using
securitization techniques in helping Daiwa's corporate
clients to restructure their balance sheets by reducing their
debt-service payments.</p>
<p>In jumping into asset-backed securities, Daiwa, to some
extent, is playing catch-up with big U.S. firms. While Daiwa
has distributed these securities and advised clients in the
U.S., Europe and Japan on issuing them, it hasn't yet
originated any.</p>
<p>In Mr. Carlson, Daiwa is hiring someone with an eclectic
background that includes graduate studies in meteorology,
competitive sailing and a bit of entrepreneurship.</p>
<p>He nearly completed a doctorate in meteorology at
Massachusetts Institute of Technology. "I wrote seven of 10
chapters on the genesis and persistence of droughts in the
continental U.S. and left for the Street," he said. At MIT,
Mr. Carlson sold long-term weather forecasts to commodity
firms and a "permafrost model to the U.S. Army for
cold-regions research engineering laboratories." That, he
added, was "to keep from starving in graduate school."</p>
<p>An avid sailor, Mr. Carlson recalls a race from Bermuda to
Marblehead, Mass., in which his boat, after losing its
drinking water, confronted 20-foot waves and 40-knot winds.
"It was a good preparation for Wall Street," he said. "It was
when I was a kid and didn't know any better."</p>
