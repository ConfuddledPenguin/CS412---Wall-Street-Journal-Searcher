	<p class="article-leader">A group of senior executives have completed a buy-out of
Prudential California Realty from its parent, Prudential
Insurance Co. of America. Terms of the sale weren't
disclosed.
   Prudential California Realty was originally part of
Merrill Lynch's real estate business, which Prudential
Insurance acquired a year ago. Since the acquisition, the
Newark, N.J.-based insurance company has been selling blocks
of the residential realty offices to local management because
it believes that the residential real estate business is best
managed at the local level.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Prudential California will be the largest independently
owned real estate firm in the state, with 78 offices
extending from the San Francisco Bay area to San Diego and a
sales force of more than 4,200.</p>
<p>George Rathman, who was chairman of the Prudential
Insurance unit, will serve as chairman and chief executive
officer of the newly independent company. Rick Merrill,
formerly a regional president, was named president and chief
operating officer, and Robert LeFever, another regional
president, will serve as executive vice president. Four
regional directors will serve as limited partners: Joseph
Balla, Rolinda Smith, Roger Ewing and Robert Foster. Steve
Games will continue as president of the company's San Diego
office.</p>
