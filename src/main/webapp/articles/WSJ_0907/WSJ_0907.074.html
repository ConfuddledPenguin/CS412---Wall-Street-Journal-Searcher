	<p class="article-leader">CAMBRIDGE, Mass. -- Lotus Development Corp. is upgrading
its 1-2-3 software -- again.
   Monday, Lotus will start selling 1-2-3 Release 3.1, which
many analysts say is the product it should have introduced 15
months ago when it shipped Release 3.0. Many customers
rejected the upgrade to Release 3.0, contributing to Lotus's
earnings woes and apparently costing it sales to competitors.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The lastest revision "is certainly an important step in
the right direction," said Scott Smith, an analyst with
Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette Securities. But, "They've lost
momentum. The product is going to have to prove itself in an
increasingly competitive world."</p>
<p>Lotus could use some rejuventaion. Its stock has fallen
from $34 as recently as July 17 to $18, down 25 cents, in
national over-the-counter trading yesterday. In July it
startled investors by disclosing that third-quarter results
would trail year-earlier earnings rather than rising as
expected.</p>
<p>The latest upgrade comes at a time when Lotus is facing
tougher competition than ever in the spreadsheet market that
it has dominated since introducing 1-2-3. Lotus 1-2-3
generates about two-thirds of Lotus's revenue and is used by
about 6.5 million people. But software giant Microsoft Inc.,
Redmond, Wash., and the smaller Borland International, Scotts
Valley, Calif., both have been pushing their own spreadsheets
hard for the last two years and they are hurting Lotus,
analysts say. Spreadsheets are software programs often used
to perform financial calculations.</p>
<p>While spreadsheet market-share estimates are inexact,
several analysts said that Lotus's share has fallen from more
than 70% a year ago to between 60% and 65% today. Lotus
maintains its share of the PC spreadsheet market has slipped
slightly but remains over 70%.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, Lotus promises to strike back hard. "Every
indication I have is that customers think the (latest)
product is great," said Donald Casey, vice president,
spreadsheet division. In addition to Release 3.0's key
features of three-dimensional spreadsheets and access to
corporate databases, Release 3.1 provides high-quality
printing capabilities. It also works in conjunction with
Microsoft's increasingly popular Windows software, although
it doesn't take advantgae of all Windows features. Yet
another version, expected next year, will do that.</p>
<p>Lotus plans an unusually aggressive marketing campaign to
build momentum for the new version. Mr. Casey said it will
spend "several million dollars" on advertising. In addition,
it is sending out 1.7 million pieces of direct mail with
product comparisons.</p>
<p>Release 3.1 has a list price of $595, the same as Release
3.0, but $100 more than older versions. People who have
Release 3.0 can upgrade for $35; those who have the year-old
Release 2.2 can upgrade for $75. And users with older version
can upgrade for $150. However, in a change from past policy,
Lotus will let old users upgrade at some retail computer
stores. Egghead Discount Software, a software chain, plans a
major promotion under which users will be able to upgrade
from older versions at the store for $99.</p>
<p>Analysts said the shipment of Release 3.1 comes too late
in the third quarter to have much impact, but they said it
should help fourth-quarter results. David Readerman, an
analyst with Shearson Lehman Hutton, said he expects Lotus to
report third-quarter net income of about 25 cents a share,
down from $23 million, or 54 cents a share, a year earlier.
He said revenue will decline to about $152 million from
$153.9 million. Mr. Readerman said that he expects about 45%
of Lotus's revenue will go for sales and marketing, up from
40% in the year-earlier period.</p>
<p>"The big wildcard is how well is Release 3.1 going to be
accepted, given that the market is standardizing on Windows,"
said Richard Sherlund, an analyst with Goldman Sachs & Co.
Microsoft, which is expected to introduce an upgraded version
of its Excel spreadsheet in November or December, is
trumpeting the advantages of Windows for moving information
among several different programs at once. Peter Higgins, who
heads Microsoft's Excel marketing, said, "A lot of customers
have bought Windows and said, "maybe I should get some real
Windows applications. Lotus 1-2-3 doesn't take advantage of
what Windows has to offer."</p>
<p>However, many customers who aren't in the Windows fold
said Release 3.1 is just what they need. Brian Cole, computer
systems analyst at the National Institutes of Health,
Bethesda, Md., said many of the 5,000 users he helps advise
haven't upgraded 1-2-3 because past upgrades didn't provide
much benefit. However, release 3.1 "will be of interest. It's
what I would recommend," he said.</p>
