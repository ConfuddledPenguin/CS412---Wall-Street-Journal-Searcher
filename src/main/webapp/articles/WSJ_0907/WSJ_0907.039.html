	<p class="article-leader">I was fascinated to read Reps. Howard Wolpe (D., Mich.)
and Frank Horton (R., N.Y.) bemoaning the "transfer of
wealth" from the Northeast and Midwest to the Southwest,
which they perceive taking place as a result of the federal
bailout of the S&L mess ("The S&L Bailout: Looting the North
for Texas' Benefit," editorial page, Aug. 14). Apparently
they believe in the integrity of the union only in those
cases when their respective constituencies stand on the plus
side of the federal ledger.
   If Messrs. Wolpe and Horton are truly concerned with
balancing these types of regional transfers, perhaps their
analysis should begin with their regions repaying the
Southwest the tens (if not hundreds) of billions of dollars
that flowed to the Northeast and Midwest by virtue of federal
price controls on oil (1973-80) and natural gas
(1954-present). These misguided regulations not only
encourage a massive waste of valuable and nonrenewable
natural resources and subsidized imported oil, but also
represent a "transfer of wealth" as real as any government
insurance or transfer-payment program.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>It is highly unlikely that Congress had any regional bias
in mind when it handed the keys to the federal treasury to
the hustlers and con men by so liberalizing our banking laws.
Therefore, its members should not now be heard to complain
that their respective states didn't attract their share of
crooks.</p>
<p>At least in that one regard federal price controls differ
from the S&L bailout: Price controls were designed to loot
one region of the country for the benefit of the others.</p>

<p>Texas may indeed be the barn door through which the
majority of S&L dollars have flown, but the door was unlocked
and opened wide by ill-conceived legislation sponsored and
passed by Messrs. Wolpe and Horton's fellow wise men in
Washington.</p>

<p>The authors assume a loss -- looting and benefit that may
be misplaced -- while overlooking another under their noses.</p>
<p>Taxpayers are, to be sure, paying for losses at today's
depressed price levels, and are asked to finance those losses
over 30 to 40 years. But the true wealth transfer may well
belong to asset buyers who benefit from cyclical recoveries
in asset values. This is attributable to Texas only if the
buyers are from Texas.</p>
<p>The Commerce Department report on Texas's resurgence
during the 1990s, to which the authors refer, suggests that
the "glut" of property dampening real-estate values today is
setting the stage for a large wealth transfer to buyers to be
realized tomorrow. But it is in the nature of Washington
politics to be mesmerized by yesterday's problems.</p>

<p>I think the situation will be healthy for Northeastern
states in the long run. The Northeast is so socialistic,
backward and crime-infested that like Russia it will have to
go completely broke before returning to normal capitalism and
some semblance of social order. (Been to New York City
lately?) So perhaps Texas is doing the Northeast a favor by
drawing money away and helping to speed up that "going broke"
process that will lead to true Northeastern economic and
social reform. Bitter medicine but necessary. Bravo for
Texas.</p>
