	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- A planned late-night series created by
producer Norman Lear for CBS Inc.'s television network has
been scrapped one month before it was scheduled to premiere.
   The half-hour program, "Jody Gordon and the News," was to
have been two 15-minute shows woven together and was to have
marked the return to television of Mr. Lear, who created such
CBS hits as "All in the Family," "One Day At a Time" and
"Maude."</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>A CBS spokeswoman said Mr. Lear asked to be let out of his
contract so he could concentrate on "Sunday Dinner," a
prime-time series he is developing. The late-night show was
to air at 12:40 a.m., following reruns of "Wiseguy" and "21
Jump Street."</p>
<p>CBS hasn't succeeded in gaining a foothold in the
late-night time period, most recently failing with the "Pat
Sajak Show." As previously reported, CBS is considering a new
half-hour news show for the 11:30 p.m. slot, to be anchored
by CBS News correspondents Charles Kuralt and Lesley Stahl.</p>
