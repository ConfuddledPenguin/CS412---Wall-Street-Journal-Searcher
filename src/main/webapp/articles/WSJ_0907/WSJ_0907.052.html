	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- The Fox television network signed an agreement
with cable-system operator Tele-Communications Inc. that will
establish a new kind of Fox affiliate station on small cable
systems where the upstart network doesn't have a presence.
   The pact between Fox Broadcasting Co., a unit of News
Corp.'s Fox Inc., and Tele-Communication marks the first time
a broadcaster and a cable operator, traditional rivals for
viewers, have cooperated to form cable-based affiliates of
the network. It could eventually let Fox expand its reach to
an additional 800,000 homes now covered by
Tele-Communications's cable systems, which reach a total of
more than 11 million homes when minority partnership are
included.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Fox, which is about to expand its three-night lineup to
five nights a week of prime-time programming, now covers only
91% of all U.S. homes with television sets, compared with 99%
coverage by its Big Three rivals. Fox officials hope the
reach could grow to perhaps 95% in a few years by signing up
additional cable operators to similar arrangements.</p>
<p>"The same reasons that Tele-Communications would want to
do this hold true of all cable operators in the industry,"
said Fox Broadcasting President Jamie Kellner. He said it
would take perhaps six months to get the new Fox cable plan
"up and running."</p>
<p>Expanding Fox's coverage could be lucrative. The fledgling
network took in an estimated $550 million in orders for
commercials in the recent "up-front" market and may top $600
million in total revenue for the coming year. If Fox can
widen its reach by, say, 5%, its ad sales could rise by a
similar amount, taking in another $30 million.</p>
<p>Neither partner in the pact would disclose how much money
it would cost Fox to start the new cable affiliates, or how
much in total fees Tele-Communications may pay to Fox to
carry the programming. Fox will have the option of selling
local commercials for some systems. In others,
Tele-Communications will sell local ads and pay Fox a monthly
fee of six cents per household for the programming.</p>
<p>By some estimates Fox may have to pay a few million
dollars extra to beam the programming to cable operators. Fox
officials are hopeful that the local ads that Fox sells on
the local cable systems will be enough to offset the extra
costs, and that fees collected from Tele-Communications
systems would be all profit.</p>
<p>Broadcasters often shun ties to cable operators, in part
because the proliferation of channels has cut heavily into
the big networks' nightly audience. But cable has been
critical to the emergence of Fox as a fourth network. Over
80% of Fox's 117 stations can be found in snowy UHF country,
on channels in the 20s, 30s and 40s. Cable systems give Fox's
UHF stations far better reception.</p>
<p>Fox research vice president Andrew Fessel spotted cable
early on as a potential ally. His prodding made Fox a
"cable-friendly" entity and prompted the search for
arrangements like the Tele-Communications agreement, said
Fox's Mr. Kellner.</p>
<p>Network affiliates normally might be expected to oppose
establishing new stations on cable systems. But the Fox
affiliate board has endorsed the new plan because it would
create cable-based Fox channels only in markets that are too
tiny to support the establishment of a fourth over-the-air
television channel. If a would-be Fox station does start up
in one of the small markets, the cable-based affiliate would
drop the Fox programming to avoid draining viewers, said
Robert Thomson, a Tele-Communications vice president.</p>
