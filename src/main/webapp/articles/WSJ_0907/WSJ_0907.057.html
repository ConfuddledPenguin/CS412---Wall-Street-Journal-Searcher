	<p class="article-leader">FARNBOROUGH, England -- Juergen E. Schrempp, the
45-year-old chairman of Daimler-Benz AG's Deutsche Aerospace
AG unit, has spent eight months stitching four disparate West
German aerospace companies into a cohesive whole.
   Now, his handiwork is on display to the world.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Deutsche Aerospace is here at the big biennial show taking
up at least half the space in the German pavilion with its
airplanes and a plush hospitality chalet.</p>
<p>It is a heady time for the four companies involved, each
of which is at least 50%-owned by Deutsche Aerospace, which
was establshed in May 1989 to embrace Daimler's aerospace
activities. Placed together, Deutsche Aerospace's product
range is vast and its potential appears enormous.</p>
<p>The four companies involved are: Dornier G.m.b.H., a maker
of small aircraft; Motoren & Turbinen-Union G.m.b.H., known
as MTU, which makes engines; defense contractor
Messerschmitt-Boelkow-Blohm G.m.b.H., known as MBB; and
Telefunken Systemtechnik G.m.b.H., a maker of defense
electronics gear.</p>
<p>Deutsche Aerospace is participating in the building of
Airbus Industrie jetliners, engines from United Technologies
Corp.'s Pratt & Whitney unit in the U.S., a proposed
Eurofighter project, radar systems, the Tornado fighter,
medical systems and helicopters. Besides MBB, Airbus
Industrie's partners are Aerospatiale of France, British
Aerospace PLC and Construcciones Aeronauticas S.A. of Spain.</p>
<p>"If you're not one who can say, `I can do everything,' you
don't get the juicy piece of the steak," Mr. Schrempp says.</p>
<p>But the banquet hasn't quite begun. Although mighty
Daimler-Benz has made progress in reorganizing its new
aerospace acquisitions, the project is far from complete.
Until it is, Deutsche Aerospace will find it difficult to
bite into the meaty military, airliner and helicopter
projects the world's aerospace concerns are increasingly
doing in partnerships.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, Mr. Schrempp says, the continuing work means
"we are bringing much more to the table" than when the four
companies were small, lacking in resources and participating
in industrial ventures only on an ad hoc basis.</p>
<p>Today, "there is no company in the world that is going to
make a plane on its own," he says. "But we want to take a
lead" in such partnerships. And only as the larger, richer
and more-focused Deutsche Aerospace can German industry
approach such ventures as equals of U.S. defense companies
or, closer to home, of British Aerospace, Aerospatiale S.A.
and Aeritalia S.p.A.</p>
<p>Hence the announcements at the show that Deutsche
Aerospace is talking to partners about joint helicopter
projects in Europe and the U.S. and about a European regional
jetliner. The company also reiterated that its wide-ranging
discussions with the Mitsubishi Group of Japan are
continuing.</p>
<p>But it is a big job to amalgamate four companies and to
strive for synergies with Daimler-Benz, which itself has been
reorganized. "We have made a good start but we aren't
finished," Mr. Schrempp says. "At some levels, we are very
thin. Elsewhere, we have to reduce the bureaucracy. We have
to restructure the production side. Dornier and MBB were
fierce competitors. Now, they have to be friends."</p>
<p>On the organizational chart, the plan is to regroup
activities among the four companies by functions. Thus,
Dornier's airplanes and MBB's participation in Airbus will be
grouped into the aircraft division, while pieces of various
companies' satellite and space activities will be funneled
into the space division. The other two divisions are defense
systems and propulsion systems.</p>
<p>The cleanup exercise also means minority holdings in two
Deutsche Aerospace companies must be sorted out. The state of
Hamburg recently swapped its 7% stake in MBB for a piece of
Deutsche Aerospace, Mr. Schrempp said. But Bremen and Bavaria
still hold 24% of MBB. Bremen has said it wants to sell its
shares, but a sale or swap will have to be organized with
Bavaria. Likewise, Deutsche Aerospace is in talks with
members of the Dornier family -- who hold 18% of the voting
rights and 46% of equity in Dornier -- to win the freedom to
manage the company.</p>
<p>There are other details to attend to. At the end of 1996,
Deutsche Aerospace must buy Bonn's 20% stake in Deutsche
Airbus, the MBB unit that participates in Airbus Industrie.
But that sale is conditional on a number of things, including
Airbus becoming a corporation instead of a murky grouping of
industrial interests.</p>
