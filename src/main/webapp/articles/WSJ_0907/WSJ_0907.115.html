	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- Americans don't share President Bush's
reluctance to allow the Soviets to act as go-betweens in the
Middle East crisis, the latest Wall Street Journal/NBC News
poll finds.
   Two-thirds of the voters surveyed said they would trust
Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev to represent U.S. interests
in negotiating peace with Iraq. Only 27% said they couldn't
trust him.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>President Bush meets with Mr. Gorbachev this weekend in
Helsinki, Finland, for what Mr. Bush's aides say will be an
"unstructured" session to shore up the growing U.S.-Soviet
alliance in the wake of Iraq's invasion of Kuwait. While Mr.
Bush has repeatedly expressed gratitude for the Soviets'
support so far against their former ally, Bush administration
officials reject Moscow's suggestion to call an international
conference to discuss Middle East problems, including Iraq
and the Israeli-Palestinian issue. Mr. Bush has made clear
that the U.S. doesn't want Moscow playing a mediating role in
the Mideast and that he doesn't think the Soviets want to
play such a role.</p>
<p>Although U.S. voters overall like Mr. Gorbachev as a
mediator, women and blacks are more inclined to share Mr.
Bush's skepticism about giving him such a role: only 60% of
women compared with 72% of men say they could trust Mr.
Gorbachev to represent U.S. interests. Only a third of black
voters trust Mr. Gorbachev as a mediator, vs. 70% of whites.</p>
