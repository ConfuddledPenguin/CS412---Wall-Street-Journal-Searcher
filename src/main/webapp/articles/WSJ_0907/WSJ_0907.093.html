	<p class="article-leader">LEIPZIG, East Germany -- Like East Germany itself, the
Leipzig Trade Fair faces an identity crisis.
   Until the Berlin Wall collapsed, the biannual event was by
far the most important meeting place for business between
East and West -- and a convenient stage for East Germany to
flex its economic muscle before the eyes of the world. But
now, with East Germany a month away from a full merger with
capitalist West Germany and its own economy in shambles, the
fair is losing its special status.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Under the Communists, foreign trade was jealously
controlled by central planners, so having a booth in Leipzig
was considered one of the few chances a Western company might
have to make contact with potential partners. "You had to be
in Leipzig if you wanted to get your foot in the door," says
Johannes von Thadden, an economist with the West German
Chambers of Commerce and Industry. Now, he says, "Leipzig
will be just another big fair in a united Germany, and it
will have to compete to survive."</p>
<p>East German companies will have to follow the same advice.
This fall's trade fair is taking place against a background
of deepening economic turmoil in this once staunchly
communist country, and some wonder whether the East Germany's
flabby firms will survive. Many East bloc companies which
once proudly displayed their products here as evidence of
"socialist efficiency" are now using the fair like a giant
fire sale -- perhaps their last chance to find Western
partners who can help them make the difficult transition to
the market economy. "We talked about our own success for so
long, we started to believe in it," says a spokesman for one
East German chemical company, who asked not to be named.</p>
<p>Still, Leipzig is still Leipzig, and the Germans no doubt
will get some good news out of it. The trade fair is
traditionally a time when firms announce new ventures.</p>
<p>Right on schedule, Daimler-Benz AG let the news leak out
that it intends to pour one billion German marks ($634
million) into a truck plant in the East German town of
Ludwigsfelde. The plant is expected to start producing 6,000
medium-weight trucks by next year, with an annual production
target of 40,000 trucks by the middle of the decade.</p>
<p>And the fair is fully booked, as usual, with 6,000 firms
represented from 54 countries -- including North Korea and
Cuba. But the number of East German companies present has
plunged from 1,800 to 1,000 this year, while Western firms
booked twice as much space as in 1989. Ironically, last
year's fall fair didn't allow the usual number of Western
firms because Communist authorities worried that bad
publicity might arise from the protest movement that was
centered in Leipzig.</p>
<p>Many German politicians are hoping this fall's trade fair
will mark the economic turning point they've long awaited.
Last week, the two Germanys signed a treaty clearing the last
hurdles to unification on Oct. 3. The document covers many
issues crucial to business, including how East Germany will
handle land claims from former owners.</p>
<p>The treaty was the favorite topic for politicians from
both Germanys who descended on Leipzig earlier this week to
open the week-long fair. West German Economics Minister
Helmut Haussmann dubbed the treaty a "major breakthrough" for
investors, adding that he was hoping to see indications of
this in Leipzig. East German Prime Minister Lothar de
Maiziere went so far as to say Leipzig was now ripe to become
an "investment fair."</p>
<p>But despite such high hopes, Mr. de Maiziere got precious
little encouragement during a morning stroll through the
fair's sprawling grounds. Representatives from Japan's Juki
Corp., a leading producer of sewing machines, greeted the
East German warmly. But when asked by Mr. de Maiziere whether
the Japanese firm planned any investments in East Germany,
company officials gave a polite but clear, "No."</p>
<p>While the likes of Daimler-Benz may be forging ahead with
investments in East Germany, the question in Leipzig is
whether smaller West German firms are ready to follow suit.
"In the long run," says Mr. von Thadden, the West German
economist, "getting the smaller firms is more important,
because it shows that there are good business opportunities
even for those without special muscle."</p>
<p>Against this background, many German officials say Leipzig
will continue to play an important -- though not a
monopolisticrole in East-West trade. Mr. Haussmann, speaking
after a quick visit to the fair, said it would be wrong to
suddenly detach East Germany from its traditional trading
partners in the East. He admitted, however, that Leipzig
needs to work on its "concept" as a trade fair center inside
a new Germany.</p>
<p>Indeed, East German organizers have already launched a
frenzied effort to strengthen the Leipzig tradition. They are
setting up a series of specialized fairs, focusing on
industries such as construction and tourism, to run parallel
to the more famous spring and fall events.</p>
<p>Even if the effort fails, it will be a long time before
the legacy of Leipzig is forgotten. With a history as a trade
center dating back eight centuries, many Leipzigers consider
big trade fairs part of their identity. Elmar Pieroth, a
leading member of West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl's
Christian Democrats, remembers coming to Leipzig in 1988,
when he was an honored guest of East German party boss Erich
Honecker at a reception in the town's government guest house.
This year, Mr. Pieroth hosted an informal lunch in the same
setting. "It looks like Leipzig, but it feels totally
different," he said.</p>
<p>Of course, many would like to forget some of the details
of Leipzig's past. Under the Communists, Leipzig's spring
fair sported such oddities as hundreds of Erich Honecker
posters and a booth devoted to the Palestine Liberation
Organization. A spokeswoman for the fair says she's not sure
whether the PLO will come next spring, since the deadline for
applications has not yet passed. "Of course," she says,
"everyone is welcome in Leipzig who wants to come."</p>
