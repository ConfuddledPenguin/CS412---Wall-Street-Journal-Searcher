	<p class="article-leader">MONTREAL -- Canadian production of market pulp in July
dropped 10% from a year earlier, as the industry operated at
87% of capacity.
   The Canadian Pulp and Paper Association, an industry
group, said Canadian mills produced 566,000 metric tons of
market pulp in July, compared with 629,000 metric tons a year
earlier. A metric ton equals about 2,204.62 pounds.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The July operating rate was up from 80% in June but down
from 99% a year earlier.</p>
<p>For this year through July, Canadian mills produced
3,818,000 metric tons of market pulp, down 9.2% from
4,207,000 metric tons a year earlier. For the first seven
months, the industry operated at 86% of capacity, down from

<p>Market pulp is wood pulp sold on the open market to
producers of paper, sanitary and other products. The
statistics exclude pulp consumed at the producing mill or
shipped to another mill that is affiliated with the producing
mill. Canada is the world's largest producer of market pulp.</p>
