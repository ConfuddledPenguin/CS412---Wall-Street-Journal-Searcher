	<p class="article-leader">Annandale-on-Hudson, N.Y. -- Say Brahms and most people
will conjure up a stuffy, grumpy, bearded old musical
conservative, a composer of dense and darkly pensive music.
But it is, nonetheless, with Brahms that Bard College has
launched an ambitious and lively new summer music festival
here beside the glowing mystical beauty of the Hudson River
Valley.
   Held during the last two weekends of August, and taking
place in the handsome, inviting 350-seat Olin Auditorium or
an uninviting 600-seat vinyl tent -- where late August heat,
stifling humidity and armies of bugs tested the most devoted
Brahmsian -- the festival invited audiences to "rediscover"
works as overly familiar as Brahms's First Piano Concerto and
Fourth Symphony and the First Piano Trio. That it succeeded
as well as it did was an accomplishment surprising, it
seemed, only to those not acquainted with Leon Botstein.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"Rediscovering Brahms" was, in many ways, the Leon
Botstein show. Mr. Botstein is president of Bard College, a
professor of history and music, principal conductor of the
Hudson Valley Philharmonic Chamber Orchestra, author of a
forever forthcoming book on "fin de siecle" Vienna and a
sometime music critic. As the festival's music director, Mr.
Botstein served as conductor, musical sleuth (uncovering a
number of works by forgotten contemporaries of Brahms as well
as oddball editions of well-known Brahms scores), astute
essayist (in a companion book to the festival, "Brahms and
His World," published by Princeton), program annotator,
virtuoso pre-concert speaker (where he could spew P.T. Barnum
baloney and offer genuine musical insight in the same
ardently delivered sentence) and page turner.</p>
<p>Unlike most summer festivals devoted to a single composer,
such as the popular Mostly Mozart Festival at Lincoln Center,
Bard's was not content to simply put on stellar performances
of the featured composer and a few of his contemporaries. Mr.
Botstein's intention was, instead, to present Brahms in the
light of the composer's Vienna so that we might hear Brahms
differently.</p>
<p>So familiar Brahms scores were heard in unfamiliar
versions; works by forgotten Brahms contemporaries were
dusted off, some not having been performed this century;
noted Brahms authorities introduced concerts; and a "Great
Piano Debate" was held that was no debate at all but rather
an enlightening introduction to the kinds of pianos Brahms
knew and to the performing style of his time.</p>
<p>The view of Brahms that emerged from all this was a
revisionist one, namely that Brahms, for all his stubborn
classicism, was really a modernist. This is not exactly a new
notion; both Schoenberg and Charles Ives (probably the two
most daringly innovative composers of the early 20th century)
were profoundly influenced by Brahms, and Schoenberg often
complained that Brahms should really be the one credited with
(or blamed for) destroying tonality.</p>
<p>But the Bard festival displayed Brahms's modernism in a
novel way by demonstrating just how much greater was Brahms's
compositional reach than other admired composers around him.
One need, for instance, only hear Joachim's long-winded
"Hungarian" Violin Concerto from 1861 to appreciate the sheer
originality of the Brahms First Piano Concerto, written in
the same key (D minor) and around the same period. Brahms's
friend may have been a great violinist, but his 45-minute
concerto, for all its spectacular solo writing, removes the
folk flare from its Hungarian themes as it develops them with
sober Teutonic conventionality.</p>
<p>Joachim's compositional stodginess was also felt in the
version of Brahms's Fourth Symphony that Botstein conducted.
The violinist apparently had encouraged Brahms to add four
bland opening bars to the symphony, thus placing that
extraordinarily expressive opening in the most commonplace
frame.</p>
<p>In fact, of all the forgotten works that the festival
exhumed -- including an amiable but blandly academic string
quartet by Robert Fuchs; a couple of moody, atmospheric
overtures to Shakespeare plays by Joachim and Robert
Volkmann; and some well-wrought but not distinctive songs by
Clara Schumann -- only one proved really memorable. The
massive Piano Sonata, Op. 10, by Eugen d'Albert, written in
1893, had a kind of flamboyant Lisztian rhetoric but with
Brahms's rich harmonies, and it ended with one of the biggest
and most impressive triple fugues in 19th-century piano
music.</p>
<p>But if so much second-rate music -- or second-rate Brahms,
such as the clunky original version of the First Piano Trio
rather than the eloquent revision that is normally played --
sounds like it might have been tiresome, it never was. Mr.
Botstein programmed the music in ways that always proved
illuminating, especially by offering the Joachim and Brahms
D-minor concertos on succeeding evenings, or pairing the
Fuchs quartet with Brahms's late Second String Quintet. And
he talked the music up so well that he created a real sense
of anticipation for hearing it.</p>
<p>Most important, however, is that Mr. Botstein's enthusiasm
spread to the performances. The festival made use of fine
local talent, an orchestra of excellent New York
free-lancers, and a handful of imported soloists. Two
soloists were major discoveries. Todd Crow, a pianist who
teaches at Vassar, performed the d'Albert sonata and Brahms's
"Handel" Variations with stunning control and a wonderful
sense of musical architecture. Milagro Vargas, an American
mezzo-soprano who was until recently a member of the
Stuttgart Opera, gave an alluring recital that included
comparative text settings by Brahms and other composers.</p>
<p>Mr. Botstein's performances, notably of the Joachim and
Brahms concertos and Brahms's Fourth Symphony, were solid and
spirited. He is not a particularly supple conductor, but he
has plenty of drive and he achieved interesting orchestral
balances from a Brahms-sized orchestra of about 60. The
concerto soloists were flashy virtuosos -- the violinist
Elmar Oliveira in the Joachim, the pianist Yefim Bronfman in
the Brahms -- and both played spectacularly.</p>
<p>In his introduction to the festival, Mr. Botstein
suggested that Brahms and Robert Schumann's wife, Clara, were
so close that their relationship must have been consummated.
There is no evidence for this view, and Clara Schumann's
biographer, Nancy Reich, dismissed it at another pre-concert
talk. But happily Mr. Botstein projected his vital image of a
flesh-and-blood Brahms onto his festival's performances.</p>
