	<p class="article-leader">MADRID -- Banco Hispano Americano said it plans to launch
an industrial investment firm in Spain with Dillon, Read Ltd.
of London and the Rockefeller family investment arm,
Rockefeller & Co.
   The firm will have an initial capital of six billion
pesetas ($61.2 million) and will invest in quoted and
non-quoted Spanish companies, with a view to realizing
capital gains over a three-to-five-year period.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Holdings will be evenly divided between Spanish partners,
led by Hispano, and non-Spanish partners, led by Rockefeller.</p>
<p>Rockefeller will take a 30% stake alongside an undisclosed
non-Spanish partner, while Dillon Read, a unit of Dillon,
Read & Co., will split 20% with another non-Spanish partner.</p>
<p>On the Spanish side, Hispano will share a 50% holding with
construction firm Ferrovial S.A., family-controlled
investment firm Abengoa S.A. and a possible fourth partner.</p>
<p>Ferrovial chairman Rafael del Pino and Abengoa chairman
Javier Benjumea are Hispano's two largest individual holders,
with a combined holding of about 6%.</p>
<p>According to a Dillon Read official in London, the new
company will debut in "a few weeks" and list on the Madrid
stock exchange "in due course." According to this official,
the recent plunge in prices on the Madrid stock exchange
hasn't upset the group's investment plans.</p>
<p>"It's a very opportune moment to start making
investments," he said. "We find lower prices a plus . . .
we're not dealing with an overheated market any more."</p>
<p>The new firm's management team has been culled from
investment firm Bestinver, controlled by one of Ferrovial's
principal competitors, Jose-Maria Entrecanales, the owner of
construction firm Entrecanales & Tavora S.A.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, Entrecanales and Ferrovial were at
loggerheads over Ferrovial's bid to take over a third
construction firm, Cubiertas & Mzov S.A., in which
Entrecanales has a stake. The dispute was finally settled
amicably, with Ferrovial selling the holding which it had
built up in Cubiertas.</p>
<p>Jose-Ignacio Benjumea, who as Bestinver's managing
director was one of the participants in the Cubiertas
struggle, will run the new company. He will be assisted by
Carlos Prado, formerly Bestinver's industrial specialist, and
Santos MartinezConde, formerly head of Bestinver's research
department. Mr. Benjumea is a nephew of Javier Benjumea, the
Abengoa chairman.</p>
