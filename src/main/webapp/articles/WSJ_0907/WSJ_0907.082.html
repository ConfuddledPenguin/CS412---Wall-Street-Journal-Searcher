	<p class="article-leader">As George Bush sits down in Helsinki with Mikhail
Gorbachev this Sunday, the world's focus will be on the two
large and difficult subjects on his agenda: Saddam Hussein's
threat to the Persian Gulf and the potential economic
collapse of the Soviet Union. But if you stand back from the
details, what you see is quite remarkable: The United States
in a position of unchallenged world leadership.
   It is clear to everyone that the U.S. President is going
into his meeting in Helsinki with the stronger hand. And for
once the two men have something serious to talk about.
Indeed, only 10 months after the Berlin Wall came down, it
appears that a healthy sense of reality about the world and
the ordering of its politics is setting in.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>We are not suggesting here any sort of American
triumphalism in world affairs. The point is that what we are
witnessing now in America's leadership role in assembling a
force to stop Saddam Hussein and George Bush's largely
successful world-wide efforts to collect support for that
effort is a concrete recognition of the way the world
actually works. Since at least the end of the Vietnam War,
there has been a strain of thinking among intellectuals and
pundits which propounded the view that the U.S.'s prominent
role in the world's affairs was clumsy, overextended or
insensitive to "local" realities. Until recently, this view
found its most explicit outlet in the policy initiatives of
congressional Democrats and their orbit of advisory
satellites.</p>
<p>The basic flaw in this world view (and one interestingly
now finding an echo among some conservatives) is the belief
that nations are essentially isolated, island-like actors,
responding mostly to internal interests and forces, which are
somehow unbalanced or thwarted by the "presence" of the
United States. But this is a perception of national
relationships that, at least in economic terms, has never
been true and in our time has been proven politically invalid
as well.</p>
<p>Like it or not, the world's politics are now bound
together -- by trade, by money and by electronics. Our
friends on the right are suspicious of relationships with the
world's heterogeneous peoples. Both they and their
counterparts on the left seem bored with the dry details of
how an interconnected world actually succeeds or fails -- the
destructive disequilibrium in exchange rates, the need to
negotiate a more liberal system of international trade (a
"combat zone" in some views), and the necessity to let
immigrant labor move freely toward economic opportunities.
But these details determine whether people in the U.S. and
elsewhere have jobs, prosper and improve themselves.</p>
<p>In a world of sovereign nations, none of these matters
simply resolve themselves. As always in history, they require
leadership. And again, like it or not, one nation is going to
do the leading. For the foreseeable future, that nation is
the United States.</p>
<p>In his statement to the House Foreign Affairs Committee
this week, Secretary of State Baker stated well the Bush
administration's recognition of the post Cold War realities.
"Amidst the revolutions sweeping the globe and the
transformation of East-West relations, I think we stand at a
critical juncture in history," Mr. Baker said. "While the
rules of the road developed during the Cold War did in the
end preserve peace, the task now is to build an enduring
peace that is global in scope and not limited just to
Europe."</p>
<p>Without question there could be serious missteps between
the enunciation and execution of this goal in the Persian
Gulf. Worries persist that Mr. Bush might settle for an Iraqi
withdrawal from Kuwait, leaving the pirate regime of Saddam
Hussein in place and dangerous. But the overwhelming logic of
the situation argues against such an outcome as does, we
might point out, the slow but inexorable build-up of U.S.
forces there.</p>
<p>If there is a show-stopper in this undertaking it isn't
likely to be George Bush's will but instead a traditional
Soviet threat to draw a line in the sand around Baghdad. Most
probably, Mr. Bush will be in Helsinki seeking some signal of
the Soviet Union's intentions and desires on this crucial
matter.</p>
<p>The Soviet military establishment's interests aside, it
seems clear that the peoples of the 15 Soviet republics are
now more intent on participating in the world's future
progress than in propping up the Saddam Husseins of the
world. In some nominal sense Mikhail Gorbachev is in Helsinki
as their leader, and in time we'll know whether he defines
leadership as representing their expressed interests.</p>
<p>The paradox of Helsinki is that Soviet military might and
economic weakness have combined to make Mr. Gorbachev's
meeting with the American President a necessity. Mr. Bush
will be there to represent U.S. interests but just as clearly
he is representing all those who have an interest in
achieving a post Cold War order in which people are free to
produce, trade their goods and enjoy the fruits of those
labors. It is a simply stated goal, but it will not be
achieved in our time without American leadership.</p>
