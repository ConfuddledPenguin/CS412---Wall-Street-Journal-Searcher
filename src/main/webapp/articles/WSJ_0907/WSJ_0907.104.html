	<p class="article-leader">ALLENTOWN, Pa. (AP) -- Financially troubled Mack Trucks
Inc. said it approved an $81 million buy-out by Renault
Vehicules Industriels S.A.
   Mack said the agreement, which calls for the Paris-based
Renault to pay $6.25 a share, was reached earlier in the
week.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Renault started the week with 44.5% of Mack's 29 million
shares. On Wednesday, the French firm purchased 4.5% more.</p>
<p>The French firm hopes to buy the rest of the stock by
Sept. 20, said a Renault spokesman.</p>
<p>Renault has been trying to buy out Allentown-based Mack
for several months, saying it was making the offer "because
of the continuing deterioration of the financial condition of
Mack" and the need to restructure the company's debt.</p>
<p>Mack had a record loss of $185.4 million last year and a
loss of $97.2 million in the six months ending June 30. Net
sales for the first half of 1990 were $793.9 million, a 22%
decrease from $1 billion a year earlier.</p>
<p>The company's five-year financial plan in July projected a
net loss of about $130 million for this year. At the time,
Mack officials said they did not expect the company to show a
profit before 1992.</p>
<p>In the past year, Mack has tried to reduce business costs
and conserve cash amid a slowing market for heavy trucks.</p>
<p>Mack's financial adviser, BT Securities Corp., called the
$6.25-a-share offer fair.</p>
<p>A Mack spokesman said the merger would have no immediate
effect on the firm's employees. "This just reflects a
corporate change," he said.</p>
<p>The Renault spokesman said it was too early to predict any
changes. "This is still in the preliminary stages," he said.</p>
<p>Mack is one of North America's largest producers of
heavy-duty diesel trucks. Mack also markets a line of
medium-duty diesel trucks throughout North America and parts
of Central America, Australia and New Zealand.</p>
