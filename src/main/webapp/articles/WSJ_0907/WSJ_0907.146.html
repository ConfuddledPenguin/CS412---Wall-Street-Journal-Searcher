	<p class="article-leader">Charles H. Howard III, former director and first vice
president of defunct Thomson McKinnon Securities Inc., was
indicted by a federal grand jury on conspiracy, obstruction
and perjury charges in connection with a broad Securities and
Exchange Commission investigation of insider trading in New
England thrift stocks.
   Mr. Howard, 45 years old, was once a star performer for
the firm and a key player in the hot market for New England
thrift stocks in the mid-1980s. Thomson McKinnon Securities
filed for bankruptcy-court protection last year.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The Justice Department said the charges are related to the
SEC's 1987 investigation of alleged insider trading in
connection with the public announcement that Suffield Savings
Bank, Suffield, Conn., planned to acquire Coastal Savings
Bank of Portland, Maine.</p>
<p>The investigation touched off a broad probe of insider
trading in New England bank stocks, and resulted in
additional charges of securities violations by Thomson
McKinnon Securities. The firm paid $320,000 in fines last
year to four New England states to settle charges that Mr.
Howard and others sold securities without licenses.</p>
<p>The investigations also led to a blizzard of lawsuits and
to the conviction in New Haven of Robert C. DiGennaro,
Suffield's former chairman and chief executive, on insider
trading and other charges.</p>
<p>According to the indictment of Mr. Howard, announced by
U.S. Attorney Wayne A. Budd in Boston, Mr. Howard conspired
with others to conceal that investors had purchased Coastal
stock prior to the announcement of the merger on the basis of
inside knowledge. The indictment also charges that he tried
to obstruct the SEC's investigation and perjured himself in
testimony before commission investigators.</p>
<p>Mr. Howard made his name mainly as a financial adviser to
small New England savings banks, many of which converted from
mutual to public ownership in the mid-1980s. During much of
the bull market, New England thrift stocks were star
performers, and Mr. Howard was their most visible and
flamboyant advocate.</p>
<p>He not only helped the fledgling public companies drum up
interest in their shares, he helped invest the capital they
raised in the public offerings. In many cases, the banks he
advised invested large amounts in each other.</p>
<p>But things began to sour two years ago, as federal and
state investigators poked into irregular trading in New
England bank stocks and many of the banks sustained steep
portfolio losses.</p>
<p>Mr. Howard couldn't be reached for comment. But his
attorney, Steven M. Gordon, said Mr. Howard "has known that
he was a target of a federal investigation for a number of
years." He said that Mr. Howard is "in some respects relieved
that he will now be provided with the specifics of the
allegations against him and be permitted to fully contest the
charges." He declined to comment further.</p>

<p>NEW CHARGES are filed in Combustion Engineering
insider-trading case.</p>
<p>The Securities and Exchange Commission filed an amended
civil suit making new allegations in the case involving Asea
Brown Boveri Group Ltd.'s takeover last year of Combustion
Engineering. The amended complaint, filed in federal court in
Manhattan, names Christian Norgren, a former director of ABB,
as a defendant and accuses him of tipping off a friend and a
business associate about plans for the $1.6 billion takeover.</p>
<p>Mr. Norgren, a Swedish citizen living in Liechtenstein,
resigned as a director of ABB, a Swedish-Swiss
power-generation company, last November, a few days after the
initial SEC suit was filed in the case. Mr. Norgren also was
fired as president of Bank in Liechtenstein. He is part owner
of Finacor Anstalt, a Liechtenstein financial-services firm
charged in the SEC suit of making illegal profits of $2.5
million on the alleged insider trading.</p>
<p>The SEC accused Mr. Norgren of purchasing Combustion
Engineering common stock and call-option contracts through
Finacor just days before the $40-a-share offer was announced
on Nov. 13. In the amended suit, the SEC said Mr. Norgren
recommended the stock to a friend as "the chance of a
lifetime." In the suit, the SEC said that the friend sold the
securities at a small loss the next day after he learned from
Mr. Norgren that the recommendation was based on inside
information. The SEC said the friend warned Mr. Norgren that
trading on such information is illegal in the U.S.</p>
<p>Mr. Norgren couldn't be reached for comment. Finacor said
the amended complaint "represents an unwarranted effort to
expand the charges in this case." Finacor's attorney, Thomas
E. Engel of New York, said that the SEC had "frustrated"
Finacor's efforts to rescind the trades and has "refused to
consider any reasonable resolution" of the matter.</p>
<p>In connection with the alleged insider-trading scheme, the
SEC also filed a civil suit yesterday against Howard
Marguleas, a businessman in Rancho Mirage, Calif. Mr.
Marguleas agreed to settle the suit, without admitting or
denying the allegations, by instructing his brokerage house
to turn over to the SEC $229,000, which the SEC said was
illegal profits from the alleged insider trading. The money
was held by the brokerage house after Mr. Marguleas tried to
reverse the transactions.</p>
<p>The SEC alleged that Mr. Norgren told Mr. Marguleas about
ABB's planned offer during a business meeting in New York on
Nov. 7, 1989. The SEC said in the suit that Mr. Marguleas
agreed to buy the securities on Mr. Norgren's behalf, but
then tried to reverse the transactions after the takeover was
announced.</p>
<p>Mr. Marguleas said he tried to reverse the transaction
after having second thoughts about its legality. He said he
voluntarily reported the trading to the SEC and that he has
cooperated fully with its investigation. The SEC sought no
fines or injunctions against Mr. Marguleas.</p>

<p>JUDGE REFUSES TO DISMISS obscenity charges in Mapplethorpe
exhibit case.</p>
<p>Cincinnati's Contemporary Arts Center and its director,
Dennis Barrie, previously were indicted on charges of
violating Ohio's obscenity law in April by displaying
sexually graphic photographs in an exhibition of works by the
late photographer Robert Mapplethorpe. They sought dismissal
of the charges on grounds the material isn't obscene as
defined under constitutional law.</p>
<p>But Hamilton County Municipal Judge F. David J. Albanese
rejected the argument, saying it is up to a jury to decide
the obscenity issue. He ordered the defendants to stand trial
Sept. 24, the same day they will be tried on a related
misdemeanor charge stemming from the Mapplethorpe exhibit.</p>
<p>Judge Albanese also upheld a prosecutors' motion to limit
the evidence in the obscenity case to five photographs
described in the indictment. The defendants had contended
that the five pictures must be considered in the context of
the entire exhibit, which included photographs that weren't
sexually oriented. But Judge Albanese ruled that "each
photograph has a separate identity."</p>
<p>Marc Mezibov, an attorney in Cincinnati for the
defendants, said, "We're certainly not pleased" with the
ruling.</p>
<p>He said the judge is expected to issue guidelines
clarifying his opinion and that a decision on whether to
appeal won't be made until then.</p>

<p>CARPENTERS UNION in New York is sued for alleged ties to
organized crime.</p>
<p>The U.S. Attorney's office in Manhattan filed a civil
lawsuit under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt
Organizations Act accusing the leaders of the carpenters
union of running a protection racket that collected payoffs
from contractors.</p>
<p>The suit claims that union leaders and organized-crime
families extorted the payments in exchange for guaranteeing
labor peace. The suit, the result of a joint federal, state,
and city investigation, says some contractors were allowed to
get around union work and safety rules in return for the
payoffs.</p>
<p>The suit asks that an independent trustee be appointed to
run the 30,000 member union, the largest construction union
in New York City.</p>
<p>"Union members' rights have been systematically traded for
secret payoffs," says the suit, filed in federal court in
Manhattan. "Those who opposed this corrupt state of affairs
-- whether employees or union members -- have been
intimidated into silence by violence, threats, economic
coercion, and the known ties between corrupt union officers
and organized crime."</p>
<p>The defendants include the governing body of the union,
four union officials and six alleged members of the Genovese
organized-crime family. The suit doesn't specify how much the
union leaders and the mob allegedly received from
contractors.</p>
<p>A spokesman for the union declined to comment on the
allegations.</p>

<p>DISTRIBUTOR WINS $6 million in damages in a vertical
price-fixing verdict.</p>
<p>A federal jury in Atlanta awarded $2 million in damages,
to be trebled under antitrust law, to DeLong Equipment Co.,
an Atlanta distributor of metal-polishing agents, in a
price-fixing case. DeLong alleged that it was terminated as a
distributor of a polishing agent made by Washington Mills
Abrasive Co., North Grafton, Mass., because DeLong wouldn't
join in a scheme to fix the price of the material sold to the
Pratt & Whitney Aircraft division of United Technologies
Corp. Pratt & Whitney used the material in making jet-engine
parts for the U.S. military and others.</p>
<p>DeLong alleged that Washington Mills relabeled generic
polishing material as "special" and doubled its price.</p>
<p>An attorney for Washington Mills said the company will ask
the judge to set aside the jury verdict.</p>
