	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- Thrift regulators said they amended civil
charges against Thomas Spiegel, seeking an unspecified amount
of additional restitution from the former executive of
Columbia Savings & Loan Association.
   The new charges by the Office of Thrift Supervision accuse
Mr. Spiegel of causing the thrift to incur an additional loss
of $29.2 million by building lavish new corporate
headquarters in Beverly Hills, Calif. The building, according
to the regulators, was built without regard to cost, and
included a multilevel gymnasium, "survival chamber" bathrooms
with bullet-proof glass, and an independent air and food
supply.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>In July, the OTS filed civil charges against Mr. Spiegel,
accusing him of using thrift funds for such acquisitions as a
huge gun collection, aircraft and $7,000 in Michael Jackson
concert tickets. The agency sought $24 million in restitution
and penalties at that time. Mr. Spiegel denied all charges.</p>
<p>Contrary to past practice, the hearing for Mr. Spiegel
will be public, the regulators said, as will an
administrative hearing of civil charges against Charles
Keating, former chairman of the parent of Lincoln Savings &
Loan Association, Irvine, Calif. Neither hearing date has
been set.</p>
