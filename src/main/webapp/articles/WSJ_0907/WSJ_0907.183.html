	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- Americans are hardening their line toward
Iraq and are increasingly optimistic about eventual U.S.
success in the Persian Gulf but believe that the conflict
will be protracted, according to a Wall Street Journal/NBC
News poll.
   The survey, conducted Tuesday and Wednesday, found that
68% of the 800 persons polled believe the U.S. has the upper
hand in the conflict, an increase from a Journal/NBC poll 2
1/2 weeks earlier, when 52% said the U.S. held the upper
hand.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>In the earlier poll, those polled were almost evenly
divided over whether the U.S. will be able to obtain its
objectives without a shooting war. They now say by a margin
of 52% to 36% that the U.S. will prevail without a war.</p>
<p>Some 84% of those surveyed say the U.S. should respond
militarily if Iraq attacks Saudi Arabia, up from 74% in the
earlier poll; 56%, up from 43%, support military action if
Iraq fails to withdraw from Kuwait. And 72% believe the U.S.
should take military action if hostages are harmed.</p>
<p>"Resolve and support for the U.S. action is a little
stronger than it was two weeks ago," say pollsters Peter
Hart, a Democrat, and Robert Teeter, a Republican, who
conducted the poll for the Journal and NBC. They ascribe this
to the fact that "all our pieces are now in place in the
Middle East, and there hasn't been some unforeseen blow-up,"
such as a terrorist attack on U.S. targets.</p>
<p>Those polled don't expect a rapid conclusion to the
crisis. Nearly two out of three believe U.S. troops will be
in Saudi Arabia for at least six months, and four in 10
believe the troops will stay more than a year.</p>
<p>Only 15% think the mission of the U.S. and its allies
should be limited to protecting Saudi Arabia; 43% say the
U.S. should also regain control in Kuwait, and 31% say the
U.S. should invade Iraq to overthrow Saddam Hussein.</p>
<p>Some 50% of those polled say the most important reason the
U.S. is in Saudi Arabia is to protect the world's oil supply.
But they remain strongly opposed to the use of force to
achieve economic goals. Asked whether they support the use of
force if the U.S. develops a shortage that raises gasoline
prices to more than $2 a gallon, 71% say no, up from 64% last
month. And 57%, up from 50%, oppose the use of force even if
oil shortages threaten a major recession and close down some
factories.</p>
<p>Despite perception that the U.S. will prevail without a
shooting war, two-thirds of those polled believe the worst is
still ahead for the U.S., and they are still closely split on
the question of whether economic sanctions and a blockade
will achieve the nation's objectives. Overall, the poll found
76% support for the deployment of troops to Saudi Arabia and
75% approval of President Bush's handling of the crisis,
small increases from the earlier survey.</p>
<p>Support for the U.S. action remains strong among
practically all demographic groups. The only exception is
that black voters remain consistently more skeptical of U.S.
action in the Gulf than whites.</p>
<p>The generally increasing optimism in the poll on the
Mideast didn't extend to the U.S.'s domestic circumstances.
About 58% of those surveyed believe the U.S. is headed for a
recession in the next 12 months, unchanged from last month's
survey, when recession fears sharply increased for the first
time this year.</p>
<p>By a 45% to 40% margin, voters said things in the U.S. are
generally going in the right direction. That is similar to
the results of a July Journal/NBC poll, but represents a
significant decline in optimism from earlier in the year.</p>
<p>The poll found no consensus on how to pay for sending U.S.
troops to the Middle East. The most popular option, backed by
38% of voters, is to let the federal budget deficit increase
until the crisis ends. Some 27% say domestic spending should
be cut, and 18% endorse a temporary tax increase. (However,
three in 10 of those favoring spending cuts don't think they
could be big enough to pay for the increased military costs.)</p>
<p>On the question of defense spending, 61% support keeping
such spending at about the same level, with the remaining
respondents about evenly split between cutting and increasing
defense spending. In a slightly different question asked last
November, 59% of voters supported keeping defense spending
about the same, while 28% favored cutting it and 10% favored
an increase.</p>

<p>`Which of the following do you think will be the ultimate
result of our actions in the Middle East?'</p>

<p>America will end up in a war</p>
