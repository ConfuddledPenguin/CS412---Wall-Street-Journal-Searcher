	<p class="article-leader">FALL RIVER, Mass. -- "Do voters really want a governor
angrier than they are?" asks state Rep. Joan Menard, one of a
score of Democratic politicians attending Mayor Carl
Viveiros's 20th annual picnic at Dave's Beach here.
   It's hardly an idle question, for the key figure in this
year's governor's race is John Silber, the 63-year-old
president of Boston University. And Mr. Silber is an angry
man. "He's angry all the time," says Louis DiNatale, senior
fellow at the University of Massachusetts's John McCormack
Institute of Public Affairs. "Now he's got two weeks and a
million dollars to prove he's a moderate and not a maniac."</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The conservative Mr. Silber is the magnetic pole in a
three-way race in the Sept. 18 Democratic primary to choose a
candidate to succeed retiring Gov. Michael Dukakis, who may
qualify as the most unpopular incumbent in the nation. Only
two years ago, Mr. Dukakis ran for president boasting of the
Massachusetts Miracle. That economic bubble has burst, with
the state's economy heading down at the same time taxes are
moving up. The voters feel betrayed.</p>
<p>The three-way race offers standard Democratic stereotypes
with astonishing fidelity. The leader in the polls is former
state Attorney General Francis X. Bellotti, a genial
old-style politician who ran twice before for governor,
losing in 1964 and 1970. He represents the loyal, ethnic,
mostly urban roots of the party so grandly personified by
Killer Kowalski, the former wrestling champion who spoke up
for Mr. Bellotti at Mayor Viveiros's picnic. He is also the
unlikely champion for pragmatic liberals desperate to stop
Mr. Silber, despite the fact that many of those same liberals
aimed elitist barbs and dirty ploys at him in previous
campaigns.</p>
<p>Mr. Silber, on leave from his $275,000-a-year job at BU,
is a transplanted Texan -- one of his oldest friends is
former House Speaker James Wright -- who heaps abuse on
status quo politics and free-spending politicians, especially
Gov. Dukakis. He voted for Ronald Reagan and George Bush, and
he appeals to suburban independents and disenchanted
Democrats -- but is hampered by a widespread feeling that he
is poorly suited by character and temperament to be governor.</p>
<p>Also in the race, struggling to raise enough cash to be
competitive, is Lt. Gov. Evelyn Murphy, a 50-year-old
feminist and environmentalist, who maintains a following
among voters Mr. DiNatale derisively calls the "brie and
save-the-whales folks."</p>
<p>The pragmatic liberals wish Lt. Gov. Murphy would pull out
of the race and throw her support to Mr. Bellotti; she says
she won't, and instead has gone on the air with a new
television commercial that effectively lambastes Mr. Bellotti
and Mr. Silber for running dirty campaigns. It opens with
shots of oozing, bubbling mud. ("Boston Harbor?" asks the
voice in the commercial. "No, it's the governor's race.") And
then, earlier this week, the lieutenant governor threatened
to seize control of the state as soon as Gov. Dukakis left on
a scheduled foreign trade mission, so she could put through
her own proposals to cure the state's fiscal crisis. The
governor briefly postponed his trip, but he departed
yesterday after receiving assurances that Lt. Gov. Murphy
would act responsibly in his absence.</p>
<p>Dirty this race has been. And it's no wonder: Mr. Bellotti
and Mr. Silber despise one another.</p>
<p>Mr. Bellotti on Mr. Silber: "He's sleazy and he's running
low-ball ads. He's an extremely arrogant, elitist guy."</p>
<p>Mr. Silber on Mr. Bellotti: "He's not really running for
governor. He's running for redemption. He's got lots of
political baggage. His record in prosecuting politicians was
dismal. He was in government 12 years and never did anything.
Bellotti and Dukakis. I keep confusing the two."</p>
<p>"What we have here," says Paul Kirk, a former Democratic
national chairman, "is almost a unique situation of anger and
frustration among the voters. If that translates to an
attitude -- oh, to hell with it -- Bellotti probably will
win. But if Democrats and independents decide they want to
send a message and turn out in big numbers, look out for
Silber." Independents are eligible to vote in party primaries
in Massachusetts.</p>
<p>The Republicans are holding a quiet primary in which state
Rep. Steven Pierce is leading former U.S. Attorney William
Weld. Mr. Pierce is running on an anti-abortion, anti-tax
platform; Mr. Weld is running as a moderate and has been
making some headway lately in the polls. A poll by the Boston
Globe and WBZ-TV suggests that either of them could beat any
of the Democratic candidates, but most voters are unaware of
where the two GOP candidates stand on most issues, including
abortion.</p>
<p>Mr. Silber boasts that he's an outsider, free of ties to
old-style politicians. But Bellotti aides like to point out
that Silber supporters include such insiders as state Senate
President Billy Bulger and former Boston Mayor Kevin White.
Mr. Silber insists he is under no obligation to any of them
and that, in fact, the controversial Mr. Bulger, a
deal-making political boss, "is as high-minded a politician
as I've ever known."</p>
<p>And while Mr. Silber belabors Mr. Dukakis's performance at
every turn, he has hired several Dukakis aides for his
campaign. They include Jack Weeks, who came up with the idea
during the presidential campaign of putting the governor in
an M-1 tank wearing a helmet, a notion that even Kitty
Dukakis says turned out to be humiliating.</p>
<p>Given the high state of outrage among the voters here, Mr.
Silber ought to be running well ahead of Mr. Bellotti and Lt.
Gov. Murphy, both of whom have ties with the discredited Mr.
Dukakis. Mr. Silber may still win -- some observers believe
his vote is undercounted in the polls -- but if he does it's
going to be closer than it might have been because he tends
to commit political gaffes.</p>
<p>"He's made so many of them," says Mr. Bellotti, "that
voters don't think he's funny any more. He's not wearing
well."</p>
<p>Perhaps Mr. Silber's most celebrated gaffe was his offhand
attempt in a healthcare forum to quote Shakespeare:
"`Ripeness is all,'" he said. "When you've had a long life
and you're ripe, then it's time to go."</p>
<p>Mr. Bellotti's handlers, led by TV consultant Ray
Strother, saw an opening, and barged through it with a
commercial charging that "John Silber wants to ration health
care for the elderly," as the screen fills with scenes of
happy, healthy older folks working in the garden, playing
handball and reading to their grandchildren. "Time to go?"
asks the voice in the commercial, as the screen shows
close-ups of the smiling faces of these older folks. As
governor, the commercial concludes, "Frank Bellotti will
never desert the elderly. Never. Never. Never."</p>
<p>Outrageous, says Mr. Silber. "I was talking about
terminally ill people, connected to tubes, gasping for
breath. He {Bellotti} alleges I want to ration health care to
those beautiful, healthy people that appeared in the ads.
It's not true. I have a 95-year-old mother who lives with me
most of the time."</p>
<p>"Baloney," says Mr. Bellotti. "I know what he said. He
wants to ration health care."</p>
<p>Mr. Silber's handlers, led by consultant Robert Squier,
struck back with a TV spot that has now become something of a
classic among the cognoscenti who follow nasty negative
advertising. It shows the headline of a Boston Globe story
that analyzed Mr. Bellotti's tepid record as attorney general
in prosecuting political corruption, and neatly turns it into
a suggestion that Mr. Bellotti might be personally corrupt.</p>
<p>"Questions Linger Over Bellotti's Corruption Record," the
headline reads. "So who do we turn to?" asks the voice in the
commercial, as the ad zeroes in on the word "corruption."
"Bellotti, plagued by questions about his corruption record?"
And then the kicker: "Corruption, the oldest word in the
politics of the past."</p>
<p>"He {Mr. Silber} took words out of a headline and drew the
inference I was corrupt," says Mr. Bellotti. "It's pure
deception. It's sleazy."</p>
<p>To counter the ad, Mr. Bellotti held a crowded news
conference at which he produced five live attorneys general,
one from as far away as Michigan, to attest to his
incorruptibility. Others sent their regards.</p>
<p>Mr. Bellotti's supporters note that the corruption ad is
played out against the fact that Mr. Bellotti's ethnic stock
is Italian, and that there might be a hidden message that he
has mob connections.</p>
<p>Nonsense, says Mr. Silber. "When I think of Italians, I
think of Rossini, Michelangelo, Marconi, Guardini, Virgil."</p>
