	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Prodigy announced several improvements to its
videotext service, including the availability of an
electronic encyclopedia and very fast updating of sports
scores.
   The joint venture between International Business Machines
Corp. and Sears, Roebuck & Co. also has speeded up the
service, which people use to shop, gather information and
communicate through personal computers connected to the
Prodigy service over phone lines. One of the main criticisms
of Prodigy over the past two years has been that it took too
long for the system to respond.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Prodigy, which now has 460,000 users in 270,000
households, said it expects that number to continue to grow
rapidly, to more than one million users by the end of next
year. Among other reasons, Prodigy said it has completed its
rollout of the service, so that it's now available
nationwide.</p>
<p>Still, market researchers have said Prodigy needs millions
of users before it can start to turn a profit. Estimates of
IBM's and Sears's spending on Prodigy thus far range into
many hundreds of millions of dollars.</p>
<p>Prodigy executives, who acknowledged that users have
bought fewer items through the service than had been
expected, remain optimistic that consumers will eventually
get used to shopping electronically.</p>
