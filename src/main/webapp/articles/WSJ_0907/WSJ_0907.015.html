	<p class="article-leader">PARSIPPANY, N.J. -- Armco Inc. said it extended to next
Wednesday from yesterday the expiration date of its consent
solicitation and offer to purchase its 13.5% senior notes,
due 1994.
   The steelmaker said that, as of last Wednesday, it had
received consents representing about $29.3 million principal
amount of the notes outstanding; those holders have agreed to
Armco's amendment to pay a dividend of 10 cents a common
share. Armco needs approval from a majority of the notes to
pay the dividend. The company has $164 million in notes
outstanding.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Armco said about $9.8 million principal amount of the
$29.3 million of notes have been tendered and deposited.
Armco previously said it would buy back as much as 30% of the
notes for $1,070 plus interest for each $1,000 of notes.</p>
<p>Armco said it is considering amending the solicitation and
offer. If the amendment is made, the solicitation and offer
will be extended further.</p>
