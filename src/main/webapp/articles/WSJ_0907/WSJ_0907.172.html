	<p class="article-leader">Worthen Banking Corp., Little Rock, Ark., said a federal
appeals court refused a last-ditch effort by Arkansas banking
regulators to halt the bank-holding company's planned
purchase of an insolvent thrift from the Resolution Trust
Corp.
   The ruling by the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in St.
Louis upheld an earlier decision by a three-member panel of
the court that the RTC has the power to override state
banking laws to sell insolvent thrifts and their branches to
banks.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The Arkansas banking commissioner had requested the full
court to stay the decision, which reversed an opinion by a
district court judge. Worthen said it is working with the RTC
to coordinate a closing of its purchase of certain assets and
liabilities of Independence Federal Bank FSB of Batesville,
Ark.</p>
<p>Arkansas banking officials couldn't be reached for
comment.</p>
