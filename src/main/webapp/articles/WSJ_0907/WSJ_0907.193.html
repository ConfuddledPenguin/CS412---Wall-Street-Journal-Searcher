	<p class="article-leader">DETROIT -- General Motors Corp. said it will shut the
assembly plant that builds the Buick Reatta for an additional
two weeks because of slow sales. The plant was to have
reopened this past Tuesday after a seven week shutdown. About
600 workers will be laid off temporarily.
   As of July 31, GM had a 97-day supply of Reatta cars,
according to Ward's Automotive Reports, a trade journal. This
level is considerably higher than the 65-to-70 day range
regarded as optimal.</p>
