	<p class="article-leader">Getty Petroleum Corp., a major independent gasoline
marketer, reported a fiscal second-quarter loss of $1.9
million, or 14 cents a share, after an inventory-related
charge of $3.3 million.
   At the same time, Getty said directors authorized the
purchase of as many as an additional 500,000 of its shares.
Under a 500,000-share authorization made in June 1989, Getty
has bought back 413,073 shares.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The net loss in the quarter ended July 31 compares with
net income of $1.9 million, or 14 cents a share, in the
year-earlier period. Revenue rose 7.9% to $320.6 million from
$297.1 million, largely because of higher merchandise sales
at Getty's convenience stores and higher sales of gasoline to
wholesalers.</p>
<p>But earnings were hurt, Getty said, because of volatility
in its product costs and because "the significant increase in
petroleum prices during the second quarter could not be
passed along" to customers "because of competitive marketing
conditions."</p>
