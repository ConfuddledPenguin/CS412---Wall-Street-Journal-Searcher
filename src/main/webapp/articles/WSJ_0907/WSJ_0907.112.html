	<p class="article-leader">PITTSBURGH -- In the middle of an interview in Alan S.
Fellheimer's office here, a reporter scribbles "volatile" in
his notebook. From across the walnut table, the chairman of
troubled Equimark Corp. booms: "Damn right I'm volatile] And
I read upside-down, too]"
   Yesterday, Mr. Fellheimer showed he can also read the
writing on the wall. He resigned.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>For the past year, the bank holding company has stumbled
from one miscue to the next. It has been spilling red ink
from an overly ambitious growth strategy. It announced last
week that it is suspending its quarterly dividend, prompting
speculation that the company's outlook is bleaker than
thought.</p>
<p>Federal regulators are reviewing expenses Equimark
incurred while running an insolvent Texas bank. Some top
executives have been fired. The brusque, controversial Mr.
Fellheimer has been accused of self-enrichment and nepotism.</p>
<p>The multibillionaire Tisch family disclosed last week that
a family company, FLF Associates, has built a 6.8% stake in
Equimark. The Tisches, who have a reputation for savvy
investing, aren't talking, but they may have been betting
that Mr. Fellheimer would quit, allowing the company to win
back investors who had lost patience with what they saw as
Mr. Fellheimer's rocky management, flamboyant life style --
and, mostly, the firm's recent poor performance.</p>
<p>The 47-year-old Mr. Fellheimer announced his resignation
late yesterday afternoon after failing to persuade this
newspaper to delay an article reporting that he was about to
leave.</p>
<p>In a telephone interview, Mr. Fellheimer insisted he
hadn't been pressured to go. "The company needs stable
hands-on management," he said, "and I'm a turnaround
builder." He said he will remain on Equimark's board and has
"no current intention" of selling his 8% stake, the second
largest holding in the company. (The biggest holder is FMR
Corp. of Boston, the holding company for the Fidelity group
of mutual funds.)</p>
<p>Mr. Fellheimer had been on thin ice at Equimark for
months. The board deliberated for more than six hours in May
before voting to keep him, and in recent weeks it met again
to weigh his fate, people familiar with the situation say.</p>
<p>His departure marks the end of a turbulent five-year
reign. Once a take-no-prisoners loan collector known for his
volcanic temper, he ruled Equimark with autocratic zeal --
whether forcing other people off elevators so they wouldn't
stop at other floors or ripping film from the camera of a
photographer he felt had slighted him. Directors, most of
whom he appointed, tolerated his behavior as long as the bank
produced.</p>
<p>One of his bolder moves was promoting his wife, Judith, to
vice chairman of Equimark's main bank unit, Equibank, in
February of this year. But in June, under pressure from
directors, he dismissed her.</p>
<p>As that move demonstrated, the board's patience for Mr.
Fellheimer dissipated as Equimark's financial condition
declined. Critics claimed that the bank was battered by Mr.
Fellheimer's outsized ambitions.</p>
<p>A lawyer by training, he joined Equimark as a consultant
in 1984, when federal regulators were threatening to shut the
bank because it had lost $80 million the previous four years
and desperately needed fresh capital.</p>
<p>Mr. Fellheimer was named chairman in 1985. Over the years,
he bolstered Equimark's balance sheet by cutting costs,
selling assets such as the credit-card business, marketing
aggressively to consumers and small businesses, and
collecting loans.</p>
<p>He played a big role initially in raising $100 million for
Equimark and collecting $250 million in bad loans. He once
said the hardest part of collecting from delinquent borrowers
"is trying to figure out when to punch them in the nose and
when to lift them up by the elbow."</p>
<p>His methods included hiring a former Israeli tank
commander to pursue delinquent Third World borrowers.</p>
<p>In 1985, the year Mr. Fellheimer took over, Equimark lost
$18.5 million before non-recurring items. The following year,
it chalked up $4.2 million in profits before one-time items
by collecting problem loans and increasing the bank's loan
portfolio.</p>
<p>Profit growth continued for the next three years, with
Equimark earning $22.3 million in 1989. During these years,
it also benefited from its Equimanagement consulting unit,
which worked at ailing banks and evidently convinced Mr.
Fellheimer he could turn around any sick institution.</p>
<p>Assets jumped to $3.8 billion at the end of 1989 from $2.2
billion in 1985. Meantime, Equimark provided some good
consumer products; its automatic teller machines even provide
postage stamps.</p>
<p>Mr. Fellheimer went on an acquisition binge into far-flung
places. He believed he could go anywhere in the country to
fix or acquire ailing banks, once comparing his strategy to
MacArthur conquering the South Pacific.</p>
<p>Equimark bought Liberty Savings Bank in Philadelphia,
Treasure Valley Bank in Boise, Idaho, a minority interest in
a small money-losing thrift in Cheyenne, Wyo., and two
profitable financing companies in Tampa, Fla.</p>
<p>During the good years, former company executives now say,
they worried that Equimark's acquistion strategy was too much
to handle for a relatively small bank.</p>
<p>Liberty Savings was losing money when Equimark bought it
in 1987; last year, plagued by bad real-estate loans, it lost
another $1.8 million. Treasure Valley was also a losing bank
when Equimark bought it, and still is. And aside from the
monetary losses, those acquisitions and others increasingly
drained Equimark's resources from a reasonably strong
Pittsburgh operation.</p>
<p>Company executives also worried about aggressive lending,
which Mr. Fellheimer used to boost the bank while the economy
was good. When the Northeast real estate and consumer credit
markets soured, his inexperience caught up with him.</p>
<p>In one instance, according to company employees, the
Equibank unit lent $11 million to a Pittsburgh developer who
wanted to transform a one-time boxing arena into a fancy
shopping mall. The development, called Motor Square Garden,
opened in 1988, but closed about 20 months later. With only
one restaurant and no nightclubs, the mall never drew enough
customers to support the pricey boutiques.</p>
<p>Motor Square Garden now has only one tenant: an Equibank
branch. The building is for sale for $5.9 million, and
company employees say the bank has written off part of the
loan.</p>
<p>With such problems, Equimark posted a first-half loss of
$45.2 million before one-time gains this year. The stock
price has fallen steadily for more than a year. The stock
closed at 4 7/8 yesterday, unchanged, before Mr. Fellheimer's
announcement.</p>
<p>Mr. Fellheimer's biggest disappointment came in San
Antonio, where Equimark was thwarted in its efforts to buy
National Bancshares Corp. of Texas in a federally assisted
$116 million buy-out.</p>
<p>National Bancshares was to have been the linchpin of
Equimark's future growth. When Equimark decided to buy the
bank, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. allowed Mr.
Fellheimer and his troops to move in and manage it until the
expected sale went through.</p>
<p>Mr. Fellheimer drove around recession-weary San Antonio in
a black Rolls-Royce, joined an expensive country club and
lived in a $445,000 company-paid condominium, with tennis
courts, a swimming pool and putting green.</p>
<p>"It was a cultural train wreck from day one," says Mike
Molak, a commercial lending officer at Bank One of San
Antonio who worked at National Bancshares while Mr.
Fellheimer was in charge. "They did a lot of screaming into
the telephone with career bankers who'd been here 20 years
and didn't have any blood on their hands. It was a slap in
the face."</p>
<p>Pradeep Bhargava, a former senior vice president at
National Bancshares, recalls senior management meetings in
which Mr. Fellheimer and other Equimark executives would
dismiss bank personnel's budget plans out of hand. "Everyone
was just totally shellshocked," he says. "I think they just
wanted to come in and say, `We are in control.'"</p>
<p>Mr. Bhargava says Mr. Fellheimer didn't tolerate dissent
-- an observation many former colleagues make. "If he's in
charge you feel like you have to shut up or go away from
him," says Mr. Bhargava, who now works for Sears Financial
Network in Chicago. "If you say something that he doesn't
like, you could be in deep trouble."</p>
<p>Adds Matt Ralls, a former lending officer at National
Bancshares, which has since been acquired by NCNB Corp. of
Charlotte, N.C., "I'd tell Alan he would scare people when he
would come out of his chair. He'd say, `That's because I'm a
scary guy.'"</p>
<p>In past interviews, Mr. Fellheimer said he was well
received in San Antonio, had collected $100 million in bad
loans and was bringing business back to the bank. He said he
used the country club and the condo to entertain customers.
"What do you want me to do, live in a hovel?" he asked.</p>
<p>The National Bancshares deal collapsed when creditors held
out for more money and federal regulators wouldn't allow Mr.
Fellheimer to sweeten Equimark's offer. But during the nine
months that Equimark managed National Bancshares, it ran up a
bill for more than $10 million, which was charged to the
government.</p>
<p>The FDIC says it is reviewing how the money was spent and
will ask for at least partial reimbursement. Among the
alleged expenses is a $1,400 bill for transporting Mr.
Fellheimer's Rolls-Royce to San Antonio from Pittsburgh. Mr.
Fellheimer says he personally paid the transportation costs
and denies any misuse of money.</p>
<p>Regulators are also examining travel and lodging expenses.</p>
<p>Mr. Fellheimer has his supporters, who admire his
street-smart savvy and his willingness to roil the staid
banking community. But critics charge that he enriched
himself and his family while delivering harsh medicine to
turn around Equimark. In 1986, he instituted an
across-the-board 10% pay cut, which was eventually restored.</p>
<p>Mr. Fellheimer's base salary was $495,000, but he had a
lucrative bonus package. Last year, he earned $1.2 million;
that made him the only executive at banks with less than $5
billion in assets to make more than $1 million, according to
SNL Securities, a bank research firm in Charlottesville, Va.</p>
<p>The Fellheimers' home in Sewickley, a wealthy Pittsburgh
suburb, is on a sprawling tree-lined estate with a
cobblestone drive, lighted tennis courts, swimming pool,
fountains and three-car garage. They also own a house in Boca
Raton, Fla.</p>
<p>A nervous man who once had his office swept for computer
bugs, Mr. Fellheimer was never shy about his ambitions. "I
like to build and I like to fix," he said this summer from
his office, the outside walls lined with framed newspaper
articles about himself. "I like to make money. I want respect
and I want recognition just like the next guy, maybe more
so."</p>
<p>While he drove his subordinates hard, Mr. Fellheimer
hasn't liked sharing the limelight. He once exposed a Forbes
photographer's film because, the magazine reported, the
photographer was shooting another executive without him in
the picture.</p>
<p>His wife, Judith, herself a very tough executive with a
sharp tongue, rose through Equimark's ranks until she was the
fourth-highest-paid executive, earning $320,000 last year.
Her ascension rankled some board members and created
resentment among some employees.</p>
<p>Mr. Fellheimer said his wife, also a lawyer who served as
chairman of the Equimanagement consulting unit, made a lot of
money for the company.</p>
<p>But her ability was called into question as her efforts to
turn around Treasure Valley Bank in Boise, which Equimark
bought in 1989, didn't pan out. (Her son from a previous
marriage, Lee Eichen, was in charge of all eight branches of
the bank until last month. Though he had no bank management
experience, the 23-year-old Mr. Eichen was hired last year
right after he graduated with honors in economics from
Harvard University.)</p>
<p>The small bank lost $203,000 last year, according to
Sheshunoff Information Services Inc., a consulting concern.
Mr. Fellheimer said he expects the bank to break even this
year.</p>
<p>Mrs. Fellheimer, 47 years old, won't comment.</p>
<p>Mr. Fellheimer has fiercely denied any charge of nepotism.
He says that promoting or hiring family members is in the
best tradition of American business, citing the Rockefellers,
the Fords and the Mellons. Besides, he says, it's been his
right to run the company as he saw fit.</p>
<p>"I'm not some hired hand]" he fumes. "I've invested $11.5
million of my money in this company. This is a company that I
took from nothing and built from nothing."</p>
<p>The most widely discussed possible successor to Mr.
Fellheimer is James C. Roddey, a director who runs a local
money management firm. Mr. Roddey won't comment.</p>
<p>Where the Tisches fit in is unclear. More than half the
Equimark shares they acquired were bought in July and August
at $3.375 to $5.625 apiece, well below its 52-week high of
15. They maintain they're passive long-term investors,
although it's thought likely they'll play some role in
deciding the future direction of the bank.</p>
<p>Opinions vary on Equimark's long-term prospects. But most
observers say it has a strong franchise in Western
Pennsylvania, and if it returns to its roots -- a niche bank
for small businesses and consumers -- it could prosper.</p>
<p>As for Mr. Fellheimer, several months ago, during the
interview in his office, he took comfort in at least one
thought: "Even if I lose everything," he said, "Judy and I
can always go back to practicing law."</p>
<p>And yesterday he said that's exactly what he plans to do.</p>
