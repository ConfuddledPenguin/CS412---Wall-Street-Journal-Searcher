	<p class="article-leader">Marathon Oil Co., a unit of Pittsburgh-based USX Corp.,
said it will install a drilling and production platform in
the Gulf of Mexico.
   The platform, located at a site called South Pass Block
86, will be used to develop more than 50 million equivalent
barrels of hydrocarbon liquids discovered in 1988. The well
tested at a rate of 9.6 million cubic feet of gas per day and
1,270 barrels of condensate per day.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The offshore Louisiana field was further delineated by a
second well, which tested at a rate of 3,666 barrels of oil
per day and 4.3 million cubic feet of gas per day.</p>
<p>The platform is being designed to handle production of
20,000 barrels of oil per day, with an initial gas handling
capacity of 100 million cubic feet per day. Installation is
set for early 1992.</p>
<p>Other partners in the development are Amerada Hess Corp.,
the Louisiana Land & Exploration Co. and OKC Limited
Partnership. Each owns 25% of South Pass Block 86.</p>
