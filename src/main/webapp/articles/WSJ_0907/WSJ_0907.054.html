	<p class="article-leader">BOSTON -- Researchers here reported the discovery of a
faulty gene that causes an inherited form of cardiomyopathy,
a disease that thickens the walls of the heart and can cause
sudden death.
   Cardiomyopathy recently came to national attention when it
caused the death of Loyola Marymount University basketball
star Hank Gathers, who collapsed March 4 during a game. The
disease, which can stem from viral infection, alcohol abuse
and other factors besides faulty genes, can cause irregular
heartbeat, decreased cardiac pumping power and heart failure.
The cause of Mr. Gathers's cardiomyopathy hasn't been
identified.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The latest finding pinpointed the gene behind a rare,
inherited form of the disease and should enable scientists to
develop a genetic test to diagnose it early in such cases.
That may enable doctors to mitigate the disease with drugs --
there presently is no cure for it. Researchers also hope the
finding eventually will help them develop better treatments
for cardiomyopathy.</p>
<p>An international team of scientists led by Harvard Medical
School researchers Christine and Jonathan Seidman reported
that the gene responsible for the inherited cardiomyopathy
produces a heart muscle protein called the myosin heavy
chain. Myosin plays a central role in muscle tissue's ability
to contract. "It was very much a surprise that the myosin
gene" was involved in the disease, said Christine Seidman, a
cardiologist. "One doubted that a molecule as critical as
that (could be faulty) and still permit survival."</p>
<p>The researchers, who reported their discovery in today's
issue of the journal Cell, found that different families in
which inherited cardiomyopathy occurs have different defects
in the myosin gene. The genetic basis of the disease is
further complicated by recent findings that show genetic
defects not involving myosin can also cause cardiomyopathy,
Dr. Seidman said.</p>
