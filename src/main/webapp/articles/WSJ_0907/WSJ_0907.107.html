	<p class="article-leader">Niagara Exchange Corp. said Riedman Corp., ending its
proxy fight with the insurance company, agreed to buy 978,000
shares of Niagara preferred for $8.25 a share, or about $8
million.
   Niagara, of Buffalo, N.Y., has also agreed to expand its
board to nine members from seven to include two Riedman
representatives.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Riedman, which owns about 14% of Niagara's 1.8 million
common shares outstanding, had launched a proxy fight to win
the board seats. This accord ends the proxy fight and certain
litigation arising from Niagara's previous plans to sell
preferred stock to another investor.</p>
<p>Riedman is a Rochester, N.Y., insurance agency.</p>
<p>Niagara said it will use most of the proceeds from the
sale of the Series C cumulative convertible preferred stock
to replenish funds in its Exchange Insurance Co. subsidiary,
which was hit by claims following Hurricane Hugo.</p>
