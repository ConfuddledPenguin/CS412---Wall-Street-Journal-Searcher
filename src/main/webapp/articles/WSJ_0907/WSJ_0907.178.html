	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- In its heyday in the late 1980s, the leveraged
buy-out team of Fred Adler and Leonard Shaykin made headlines
by carrying out $2.5 billion of acquisitions.
   Their small firm, Adler & Shaykin, bought mining equipment
maker Joy Manufacturing Co., catalog retailer Best Products
Inc. and the Chicago Sun-Times newspaper, usually positioning
itself as a "white knight" that helped managements ward off
corporate raiders. Adler & Shaykin also nearly bought Revlon
Inc.'s beauty business in 1985, but was outmuscled by Ronald
Perelman.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>But now, Adler & Shaykin seems a case study of how the LBO
bonanza of the 1980s has petered out. Adler & Shaykin's
offices in Manhattan's Seagrams Building have become a
financial ghost town. The firm hasn't announced an
acquisition bid since late 1988. Excluding support staff,
only Mr. Shaykin and an associate a year out of business
school currently work full time at the headquarters. Visitors
aren't allowed past the 14th floor reception area, from which
they can glimpse a long row of empty offices.</p>
<p>Adler & Shaykin's investment portfolio is a mixed bag now.
The firm's biggest likely winner is Joy, which has robust
operating profit that is 2 1/2 times its interest bill. Best
Products, however, posted a $26.3 million loss for the
quarter ended May 5, and is competing in the difficult
Northeast retailing market. The Chicago Sun-Times doesn't
report financial figures, but Mr. Shaykin says it has been
affected by a nationwide downturn in newspaper advertising.</p>
<p>In the past 15 months, three of the six general partners
of Adler & Shaykin have quit, leaving only Messrs. Adler and
Shaykin and turnaround specialist Jerry Goldress. Several
junior "associates" also have left, and this past month two
midlevel "principals" walked out, too.</p>
<p>Mr. Shaykin insists everything is fine. "We anticipated a
downturn in the LBO business, and we've managed our staffing
level accordingly," he says. Adler & Shaykin is changing its
strategy, he adds, to focus on investing in "undermanaged"
companies that can improve their fundamental operations.</p>
<p>Still, many on Wall Street wonder if Adler & Shaykin can
revive itself. Opportunities for big buy-outs have withered
in the past year, as a collapsing junk-bond market, high
stock prices and widespread aversion to the financial
excesses of the 1980s have made LBOs less attractive to
financial backers and corporate executives.</p>
<p>"Business is slow," says John Miller, an executive vice
president at Equitable Capital Management Corp., which
invests with Adler & Shaykin. "It's probably a good thing
that Adler & Shaykin is smaller now."</p>
<p>As its people depart, Adler & Shaykin has managed to
invest only 3% of the $178 million buy-out fund that the firm
raised in 1988 from banks, pension funds and insurance
companies. That, too, is according to strategy, Mr. Shaykin
maintains. He says he plans to take a "patient" approach in
investing the fund. Some institutional backers such as
Equitable say that in the current tough business climate,
that's fine.</p>
<p>However, several commercial bank investors are more
anxious about the buy-out fund, which still generates more
than $2 million a year in management fees for Adler &
Shaykin, even if none of the money gets invested. The fund
has nearly nine years left to run.</p>
<p>Not all Adler & Shaykin's problems can be traced to the
LBO slump, former employees of the firm say. People who have
worked with Mr. Shaykin describe him as a combative person
who has been reluctant to share much of the firm's equity
with other partners. Says Mr. Shaykin: "We never tried to
build up a big staff. We wanted people who shared our
values."</p>
<p>Frictions also have arisen with now-departed staffers over
the role of the 66-year-old Mr. Adler, a well-known venture
capitalist and New York lawyer. Mr. Adler retains a large
ownership stake in Adler & Shaykin though he doesn't work
there on a daily basis. Mr. Adler says he still gives Adler &
Shaykin 50% of his time.</p>
<p>For a nearly a year, executive recruiters at
Russell-Reynolds Associates Inc. have tried to fill vacancies
at Adler & Shaykin. So far, the recruiters have been stumped.
Says one New York LBO specialist who was approached earlier
this year about joining Adler & Shaykin: "Leonard has trouble
keeping people."</p>
<p>Of the firm's five former partners, John Quigley left late
last year to pursue a doctorate at Columbia University;
Philip Behr left to set up his own small LBO shop; and
Michael Bruce quit to start a money-management boutique.
Messrs. Quigley and Bruce declined to comment; Mr. Behr
didn't return phone calls.</p>
<p>Mr. Shaykin still has his fans. "In good times, he's a
treat to work for," says Mark Wray, chief executive officer
of Joy. "He speaks carefully and thoughtfully." Hamilton
James III, a top investment banker at Donaldson Lufkin
Jenrette Securities Corp., adds that Mr. Shaykin "has a good
real world perspective. He has a good instinctive feel
whether an acquisition makes sense."</p>
<p>Adler & Shaykin has been willing to grow some of its
portfolio companies by acquisitions, helping the Chicago
SunTimes expand by acquiring suburban Chicago newspapers, for
example. But Mr. Shaykin has been tough on chief executive
officers -- ousting the original chief executives at all four
of Adler & Shaykin's biggest companies in favor of newcomers
he helped to choose.</p>
<p>In trying to rebuild Adler & Shaykin, Mr. Shaykin last
year elevated Mr. Goldress, the turnaround specialist, to be
a managing general partner. Mr. Goldress, 60, is chairman of
Best and Wherehouse Entertainment; he lives in Incline
Village, Nev.</p>
<p>Asked if there's any chance that Adler & Shaykin might
close up shop and let its investors reclaim the money they
have committed to the buy-out fund, the 46-year-old Mr.
Shaykin says: "No. That's silliness. There will be major
buying opportunities in the next 24 months."</p>
<p>The recent flurry of personnel departures really shouldn't
be seen as worrisome, Mr. Shaykin adds. "We're all
replaceable," he contends. "Even I am."</p>
