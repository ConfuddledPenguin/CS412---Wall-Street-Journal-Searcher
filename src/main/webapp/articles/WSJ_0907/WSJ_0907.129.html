	<p class="article-leader">Toro Co., Minneapolis, said it expects to post a "small
loss" for its first quarter ending Oct. 26, citing an
anticipated decline in sales of snow throwers.
   In the year-earlier fiscal first quarter, the maker of
outdoor maintenance and irrigation equipment earned $2.6
million, or 24 cents a share, on sales of $137 million.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The company also said it expects that per-share earnings
for fiscal 1991 will be in the range of $2.20 to $2.40,
compared with year-earlier profit of $16.6 million, or $1.55
a share. Toro said Lawn-Boy Inc., the lawn-mower maker it
acquired last year from Outboard Marine Corp., should show a
profit in fiscal 1991, reversing a substantial loss that
reduced fiscal 1990 earnings.</p>
