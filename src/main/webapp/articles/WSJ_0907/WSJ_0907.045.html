	<p class="article-leader">Please tell me whose side you are on in your story "Many
Americans Trapped in Kuwait Escape Detection" (Aug. 22).
   You did your best to "finger" all Americans who so far
have managed to avoid capture. You gave every indication of
aiding and abetting the enemy. Surely, nobody else stood to
gain from the facts in this report. But the Americans have
their lives to lose.</p>
