	<p class="article-leader">NEW ORLEANS -- Ramsay Health Care Inc. expects to report
net income of two cents or three cents a share for its fiscal
fourth quarter after a 12-cent-a-share refinancing charge.
   The company, an operator of psychiatric hospitals, is
already seeing some "real savings in interest" because of the
debt restructuring completed during its fourth quarter ended
June 30, Bradley J. Velie, Ramsay's chief financial officer,
said in an interview.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>In addition to the refinancing charge, the fourth-quarter
earnings of $300,000 to $400,000 also includes an operating
loss carry-forward roughly equal to the net income. Revenue
for the quarter rose to about $40 million. In the
year-earlier quarter, Ramsay earned $1.6 million, or 11 cents
a share, on revenue of $38.8 million.</p>
<p>For the year, Ramsay expects to report net income of
between $4.9 million and $5.1 million, or about 33 cents to
34 cents a share, on revenue of about $153 million. In fiscal
1989, the company earned $3.7 million, or 26 cents a share,
on revenue of $147.7 million.</p>
<p>Under the refinancing, Ramsay converted most of its
floating debt to fixed and capped the rest. Mr. Velie said
the new debt package also allows the company to defer certain
principal payments for up to three years and carries much
less restrictive covenants.</p>
<p>Mr. Velie said Ramsay's pretax profit is a better
indication of the company's financial recovery. For fiscal
1990, pretax profit nearly doubled to $10 million from $5.1
million for the year before, he said. "Cost control measures
have put us in a very good strategic place for future years,"
he said, adding that he expects pretax income to increase by
15% to 20% for the current year.</p>
<p>Ralph Watts, Ramsay's president and chief executive
officer, said in the interview that the industry is going
through a period of consolidation as large chains cut back
and some not-for-profit hospitals fail.</p>
<p>"There will be a lot of things for sale in the next couple
of years," he said. "We believe there will be some bargains
out there." Continuing its debt reduction efforts is a top
priority for Ramsay, Mr. Watts said, but the right
acquisition opportunity wouldn't be ignored.</p>
<p>The company currently has 16 facilities and a total of
1,433 beds. The occupancy rate for its hospitals has
decreased in the past year to about 54.6% from 57.3%, Mr.
Watts said, primarily because of shorter stays by patients
and increased competition in some markets.</p>
<p>The company is also pursuing opportunities in Canada and
in Europe and expects soon to announce its first project
outside the U.S., Mr. Watts said.</p>
