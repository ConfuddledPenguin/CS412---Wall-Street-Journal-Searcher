	<p class="article-leader">VANCOUVER, British Columbia -- Canada's Belzberg family
sold at a loss its 5.16% stake in Britain's Asda Group PLC on
the London Stock Exchange.
   Terms of the sale weren't disclosed, and officials with
Belzberg flagship First City Financial Corp., the
Vancouver-based holding and investment concern through which
the family acquired the Asda stake, weren't available for
comment.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>But the paper loss -- excluding carrying and related
charges, and fluctuations in currency exchange rates -- is
believed to be around US$45 million, based on an analyst's
estimate previously confirmed by First City.</p>
<p>The loss marks the latest in a string of investments that
turned sour for First City, including its 11.7% stake in
Armstrong World Industries Inc., which the company sold May
31 at a net estimated loss of $13.6 million.</p>
<p>Last week, First City reported a first-half loss of 27.7
million Canadian dollars (US$24 million), or 53 Canadian
cents a share, on revenue of C$436 million, compared with
prior-year net before extraordinary items of C$58.9 million,
or C$1.07 a share, on revenue of C$456 million. A special
gain made net last year C$182.6 million, or C$3.32 a share.</p>
<p>First City said that the stake in Asda, a big retailer,
wasn't an "appropriate long-term investment" and it would
like to emphasize its financial services, manufacturing and
real estate operating companies.</p>
<p>First City sold the bulk of its holdings to a group of
institutions, according to brokers in London. At last report,
First City held about 65 million Asda shares.</p>
<p>In London Stock Exchange trading yesterday, Asda's shares
closed at 109 pence (US$2.07) each, down 3.5 pence. First
City acquired its Asda shares at an average price of about
#1.50, according to a report by Toronto's First Marathon
Securities Ltd. that was later confirmed by a First City
executive.</p>
<p>Tony McNeary, an analyst with London's County NatWest
Securities, predicted that with the Belzbergs gone, Asda's
share price "will remain there (at 109 pence) for a while and
probably won't motor back up."</p>
