	<p class="article-leader">Stora Kopparbergs Bergslags AB of Sweden, a pulp and paper
concern, said it shelved the expected sale of non-forestry
operations of Feldmuehle Nobel AG of West Germany until at
least next year.
   Instead, Stora unveiled plans to sell three Swedish units,
probably before year end, to help finance its four billion
mark ($2.56 billion) takeover of Feldmuehle, initially
announced in April.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Stora's share of the purchase price swelled unexpectedly
yesterday, when its board agreed to acquire the 24.9%
Feldmuehle Nobel stake held by AB Investor and AB
Providentia, affiliated holding companies in Sweden's
Wallenberg group. The holding companies, Stora's biggest
shareholders, had joined forces with the forestry giant in
its pursuit of Feldmuehle and had been expected to continue
as minority owners and play key roles in disposing of the
West German concern's non-forestry operations.</p>
<p>Analysts said the withdrawal probably reflects increasing
financial strains within the Wallenberg group, caused by a
flurry of big acquisitions in recent months.</p>
