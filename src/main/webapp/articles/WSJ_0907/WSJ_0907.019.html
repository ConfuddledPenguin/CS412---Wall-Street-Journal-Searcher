	<h3>If He Fails, They Will No Doubt Remember That to Err Is Human</h3>

	<p class="article-leader">Forget tax credits and subsidized loans. In Portsmouth,
Ohio, where about 9.5% of the 22,400 residents are out of
work, the mayor claims he has a new answer to economic
revitalization: forgiveness.
   Forgive thy neighbors. Forgive thyself. And perhaps most
important, says Mayor Franklin T. Gerlach, forgive the major
steel and shoe manufacturers whose departure more than a
decade ago put Portsmouth on the road to hard times.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"If I have ill will against you, it's just like I handcuff
myself to you. Everywhere I go, I drag you with me," Mr.
Gerlach says. "I get ulcers. Until I can make up my mind to
forgive that person, or forgive myself, whichever it may be,
then I'm not free to go forward."</p>
<p>If Portsmouth shrugs off the burden of its depressed past,
it could be destined to be a future center for medicine,
tourism and education, Mr. Gerlach predicts.</p>
<p>But some are skeptical. "I think it's pretty stupid,"
fast-food worker Brian Bender says of the forgiveness
campaign. "I think what we need are some big businesses down
here because downtown is shot."</p>
<p>To prod his citizens toward the belief that forgiveness is
the route to prosperity, Mr. Gerlach has launched a
full-blown media campaign. Billboards about town tout
forgiveness as the "key to a prosperous Portsmouth";
businessmen have written editorials in the local press; and
preachers have plied their flocks with sermons on the
subject.</p>
<p>For an added touch, Mr. Gerlach, a lawyer who owns three
Rolls-Royces, struts about town in a powder-blue mayoral
sash: It's a symbol, he says, that fun times are ahead. (He
only wears it to ceremonies, he says.)</p>
<p>But symbols and words aren't enough. To help speed his
town toward the future, Mr. Gerlach persuaded the Mississippi
Queen river boat to stop in Portsmouth during its trek up the
Ohio River. Wearing his sash and a coat with full tails to
greet the arriving tourists, the mayor kissed all the ladies
as they got off the boat, pressed the flesh with the men and,
in so doing, stumbled across a specialty-steel manufacturer
who might want to move to town.</p>
<p>So far, however, no businesses have made firm commitments
to move in. But the mayor insists that the forgiveness
campaign is working. Citizens are laughing more, he says.
And, he reports, one divorced dry cleaner is considering
forgiving her former husband and remarrying him.</p>
