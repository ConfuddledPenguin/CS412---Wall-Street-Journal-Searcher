	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan
Greenspan said his reading of the Fed's most recent survey of
bank officers is that "a substantial minority" further
tightened lending standards this summer.
   "The tightening was noticeable for medium-sized businesses
but extended as well to large and smaller firms," Mr.
Greenspan said in written replies to questions from the
Senate Banking Committee.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The Fed released the results of its regular survey of
senior loan officers at the end of August, but Mr. Greenspan
hadn't commented on them publicly before. The Fed chairman
described the survey as "a reliable indicator of current
thinking at large commercial banks."</p>
<p>When the Fed nudged down short-term interest rates in
July, Mr. Greenspan told the banking committee that the Fed
was trying to offset the effects of the credit crunch. He
said the Fed might ease them again if it saw evidence that
the credit crunch was worsening.</p>
<p>Fed officials said late last month that they lean toward
further easing, but are reluctant to move until financial
markets, roiled by the Persian Gulf crisis, calm down.</p>
<p>As previously reported, 43% of the domestic banks surveyed
in August said they had raised the hurdles for lending to
medium-size companies since May. More than a third reported
more stringent standards for large and small borrowers.</p>
