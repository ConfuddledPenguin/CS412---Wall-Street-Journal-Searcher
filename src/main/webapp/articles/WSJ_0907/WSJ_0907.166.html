	<p class="article-leader">CMS Enhancements Inc. said it had a net loss for the
fourth quarter, ended June 30, of $1.7 million, or 55 cents a
share, compared with year-earlier net income of $1.2 million,
or 48 cents a share, restated to reflect a 1-for-4 reverse
stock split Dec. 5.
   In the latest quarter the Tustin, Calif., company had 3.2
million shares outstanding, up 24% from the year-earlier
restated 2.6 million shares. Revenue in the quarter dropped
22%, to $33.6 million from $42.8 million.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>CMS makes and markets mass-data storage devices and
accessories for most major brands of personal and laptop
computers. Jim Farooquee, president, said the fourth-quarter
loss is mainly the result of a $5 million write-down of the
company's tape backup subsystem inventory. Revenue dropped
because of increased competition, he added. The executive
said the company looks at fiscal 1991 with "cautious
optimism."</p>
