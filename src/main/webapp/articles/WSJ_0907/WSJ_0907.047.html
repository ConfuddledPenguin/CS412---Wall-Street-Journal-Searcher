	<p class="article-leader">Allen Neuharth, the combative former chairman of Gannett
Co., denied yesterday's report in the Washington Post that
the Gannett Foundation purchased copies of his book,
"Confessions of an S.O.B.," in a campaign to move it up the
best-seller list.
   Gannett Foundation President and Chief Executive Charles
Overby yesterday acknowledged that the foundation bought
2,000 copies of the book, but said the purchase "was
consistent with our mission of teaching young journalists and
other young people how to succeed in life."</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Ben Bradlee, executive editor of the Post, said, "The
story speaks for itself wonderfully. The reporter did a lot
of work."</p>
<p>In the same statement with Mr. Overby, Mr. Neuharth,
chairman of the Gannett Foundation since retiring from the
company 17 months ago, took a swipe at the Post and Mr.
Bradlee. He said the story proved the Post was "the most
overrated newspaper in the U.S.A." and he was proud to be "so
prominent on Bradlee's and the Post's enemy list." Mr.
Neuharth was the founder of USA Today.</p>
<p>In its story, the Post said the foundation, which is based
in Arlington, Va., used $40,000 of its funds to buy about
2,000 copies of the Neuharth book upon its publication last
fall. The Post story said Gannett Co. editors were asked to
purchase several copies of the book at retail price in their
local communities around the country. They were asked to send
the books to the foundation, which donated them to college
libraries and journalism schools and then reimbursed editors
for the books.</p>
<p>Zach Binkley, executive editor of the Huntington (W.Va.)
Herald-Dispatch, confirmed in an interview that Mr. Overby
asked him to buy "a few" copies of Mr. Neuharth's book. "When
Overby called, I didn't say yes or no," Mr. Binkley said.
"Only later, when I thought about it, I decided I wouldn't
and wrote him a note. I never got the idea he was doing this
for the foundation. I thought it was just on the personal
level."</p>
<p>Mr. Neuharth will get another shot at a best-seller list.
On Oct. 25, New American Library will publish "S.O.B." in
paperback in a printing of more than 100,000. In hardcover,
for Doubleday Inc., Mr. Neuharth's book made the fall
nonfiction bestsellers list, selling 160,000 copies between
September 1989 and the end of 1989.</p>
<p>In Washington, the Internal Revenue Service declined to
comment on the Neuharth-book situation. But a spokesman said
that if a charitable organization is found to have benefited
an individual, it could be in violation of the tax laws.</p>
