	<p class="article-leader">New Hollywood Wave
   Of Black Artists</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>MORE BLACK film makers have made deals with major studios
this year than at any other time since the heyday of the
"blacksploitation" films of the 1970s.</p>
<p>Mike Medavoy, chairman of Tri-Star Pictures, a unit of
Sony Corp.'s Columbia Pictures Entertainment Inc., told the
convention of journalists in Los Angeles about his production
deal with Warrington and Reginald Hudlin, whose "House Party"
grossed over $25 million this spring. Jeffrey Katzenberg, the
chairman of Walt Disney Studios, reported on his new deal
with critically acclaimed director Charles Lane ("Sidewalk
Stories").</p>
<p>Actors Denzel Washington and Danny Glover also have new
production deals, along with several black directors and
writers who have been waiting in the wings for years.</p>
<p>The pacts could lead to a small flood of movies that would
answer black demands for more black films. But Hollywood
deals don't always result in films, warns George Jackson,
co-producer of two successful youth-oriented films, "Krush
Groove" and "Disorderlies." Mr. Jackson, a former executive
with Richard Pryor's film company, noted that not one film
was completed under the comedian's $40 million deal with
Columbia in the late 1980s.</p>
<p>A torrent of low-budget, low-quality "black" films --
mostly produced by whites -- almost killed the market by the
end of the 1970s, said Doug McHenry, who with Mr. Jackson has
produced the soon-to-be-released "New Jack City." He said the
key to sustaining the new boom is improved production values,
not quantity.</p>
<p>Black Writers Duel</p>
<p>Over Racial Labels</p>
<p>WHO'S BLACK, and who's not?</p>
<p>That was the issue hotly debated by a panel at the annual
convention of the National Association of Black Journalists
in Los Angeles recently.</p>
<p>The session took its title from an Ebony magazine article
that blasted what it saw as a trend among young celebrities
of color to identify themselves as some combination of
ethnicities -- or simply "mixed race" -- instead of black or
African-American. "Whoever is a descendant of Africa is
black," Ebony writer Lynn Norment declared on the panel.</p>
<p>But Velina Hasu Houston, whose mother is Japanese and
paternal grandparents were African-American and Native
American, says blacks with Ms. Norment's view want to "annex
communities that might have a drop of African blood in them
for their political needs. It's very selfish, and it is
tyranny." Ms. Houston, a playwright, is an activist in a
growing movement advocating a multiracial designation, both
socially and in the national census.</p>
<p>The push for a new census category was defeated in
Congress last year, but the campaign is likely to gather
steam by the next census. Experts estimate that some 80% of
"blacks" could now check a "mixed-race" box.</p>
<p>A mixed-race category could complicate emerging efforts to
manage diversity in corporate work forces. "But even if
(categories) changed radically, it wouldn't deny the value of
seizing diversity in the marketplace as a business
advantage," says Ira Jackson, a spokesman for Bank of Boston.</p>
<p>But black elected officials have strongly opposed the
mixed-race category, because it might dilute black voting
strength and government aid now apportioned under existing
notions of race.</p>
<p>Navahos' Big Role</p>
<p>In Potato-Chip World</p>
<p>THE NAVAHO nation is keeping this country in the chips.</p>
<p>The Navaho reservation, the nation's largest, is probably
the biggest supplier of potatoes to the potato-chip industry,
says Albert Keller, who runs Navaho Agricultural Products
Industry.</p>
<p>The Navahos' high-tech farm covers 55,000 acres around
Farmington, N.M. The 5,000 acres of potatoes yield 230
million pounds of spuds a year, of which 130 million go to
chip makers. The Navahos are the largest potato supplier to
chip-industry leader Frito-Lay Inc., which bought 30 million
pounds last year.</p>
<p>"They are one of our most quality suppliers," says a Frito
spokeswoman. Frito purchased about 8% of all its supplies
from minority-owned firms last year. "They've been able to
help us when we've had potato shortages," the spokeswoman
says.</p>
<p>Navaho Agricultural is one of several Navaho enterprises
run like a corporation under a tribe-appointed board. Despite
its successes, Mr. Keller says, the reservation, with a
population of about 215,000, still suffers from high
unemployment and poverty.</p>
<p>Odds and Ends
</p>
<p>THE NUMBER of black CPAs has mushroomed to about 2,500
today from 450 in 1976, according to a study by Bert Mitchell
of Mitchell/Titus & Co., the largest black-owned accounting
firm. But that's still only 0.6% of the nation's CPAs. The
market would supply more black CPAs if industry demanded
more, the study suggests. Only seven of 150 large CPA firms
responding to the survey actively recruit on black college
campuses. And just half of the firms had black professionals
on staff, with 86% of those blacks at just four firms. . . .
Barbie doll maker Mattel Inc. plans this fall to start
promoting the Hispanic, Asian and black versions of the doll
it has quietly sold for years, in hopes of raising minority
market share. But at the same time competitor Matchbox Toys,
a unit of Universal Matchbox Group Ltd., is also taking aim
with a new crew of dolls based on real models, including
Beverly Johnson, one of the first black superstar models.</p>
