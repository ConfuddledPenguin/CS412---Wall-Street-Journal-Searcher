	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- Assets of the nation's 520 money-market
funds decreased $770 million to $406.55 billion in the week
ended Wednesday, according to the Investment Company
Institute, a Washington-based trade association.
   Assets of 255 general-purpose funds rose $422.6 million to
$143.69 billion, and assets of 105 broker-dealer funds fell
$410.9 million to $164.96 billion. Assets of 160
institutional funds fell $781.7 million to $97.9 billion.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"Relative stability of stock and bond prices in the last
two weeks has found its reflection in the moderation of
weekly changes in the level of money market fund assets,"
said Jacob Dreyer, chief economist at the institute. He cited
a $25 billion rise in these assets over seven weeks prior to
the recent leveling.</p>
<p>Mutual-fund assets in the previous week were revised to
$407.32 billion, a revised increase of $679.3 million.</p>
