	<p class="article-leader">FARNBOROUGH, England -- Despite worries about the Mideast,
shrinking defense budgets and a possible U.S. recession, the
Farnborough Air Show nevertheless is a hit, as usual.
   Nearly 800 exhibitors, from AABE Fabrieken to Carl Zeiss,
are occupying record amounts of space at the biennial show,
which runs through Sunday at this airfield southwest of
London. Harrier jump jets and MiG-29 fighters are thrilling
the crowds. Huge aircraft orders are being announced, and
millions of pounds are being spent on catering in the posh
hospitality chalets where the backslapping and bartering
occur.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"But this Iraqi business has affected the number of VIP
visitors," concedes Dan Honley, spokesman for the Society of
British Aerospace Companies, the show's organizer. "Airline
people are here in force, but the defense procurement people
from the Middle East are down. They don't want to leave their
operations rooms."</p>
<p>Undertones of concern are hard to miss. General Electric
Co., the U.S. engine maker, concedes that it is facing
cutbacks in its military programs. Roland Smith, the chairman
of British Aerospace PLC, allows as how the shape of the
defense industry is being re-examined in light of the Gulf
crisis. Officials of Boeing Co. and McDonnell Douglas Corp.
say the Mideast situation and fears of recession are causing
some airlines to hang back on ordering.</p>
<p>But Daniel M. Tellep, chairman of U.S. defense contractor
Lockheed Corp., is looking on the bright side, despite world
overcapacity for fighter-aircraft production. "The Mideast
thing has certainly shown that we need airlift," he says.
"And we will continue to rely on our strategic deterrent."</p>
<p>Here's what's up at the show:</p>
<p>Explosive lost-and-found: Security is tighter than usual
at this year's show. Officials say undercover agents, sniffer
dogs and "several hundred" Ministry of Defense police are
patrolling, guided by intelligence reports from Scotland Yard
and foreign governments. Briefcases are routinely checked at
chalet entrances and the undercarriages of cars are inspected
on the way in. Woe to visitors who turn their backs on their
bags; police will blow them up in short order. A salesman
lost his samples that way earlier this week.</p>
<p>Live demonstrations: Farnborough may be big and
well-known, but the newish Dubai Air Show, the next of which
is scheduled for Jan. 27-31, will offer manufacturers the
chance to really strut their stuff. The United Arab Emirates
Ministry of Defense will open a military base for live
demonstrations of missiles, tanks, armored personnel carriers
and the like. Organizers say the expanded show already has
attracted 400 exhibitors from 40 countries. "Manufacturers
are crowding in," says a spokesman for the show. Due to the
Gulf situation, "there is a major rush to get in."</p>
<p>Hungarian Generosity: Responding to pleas from Britain's
Royal Air Force Benevolent Fund, Hungary's air force donated
a mothballed MiG-21 PF fighter to the charity for its Battle
of Britain Auction next Thursday. Also to be auctioned to
raise money for RAF widows and orphans are a 1909 Bleriot
biplane, rides on Spitfires and World War II uniforms. The
Hungarian MiG was to be handed over to the U.K. air force
yesterday at the air show.</p>
<p>Boys at play: The Rediffusion Simulation stand at the show
is crowded, but not necessarily with people interesting in
buying a jetliner simulator. Men in suits and ties line up
each day to "fly" the Boeing 737-300.</p>
<p>Invisible Stealth: There had been much speculation that
the U.S. Air Force would trot out one of its radar-eluding
F-117A Stealth fighters. But no luck, even though the sleek
black bird has been displayed at other air shows. But builder
Lockheed, back after an eight-year absence, offers visitors
the next best thing -- black plastic Stealth lapel pins.</p>
<p>Magnetic attraction: Speaking of giveaways, Airbus
Industrie came up with a novel gift -- a set of refrigerator
magnets in the shapes and colors of all its aircraft.</p>
<p>Profit prophets: Margaret Thatcher, visiting the Airbus
pavilion, got the good news from Airbus Managing Director
Jean Pierson that the European jetliner consortium is poised
to make its first profit ever this year. The prime minister
tartly replied, "It's about time, too." British Aerospace
owns 20% of largely government-financed Airbus.</p>
<p>Sexual equality: For the first time in 29 Farnborough
shows, two female pilots are participating in the flying
display. One is Natalya Sergeeva, a young Russian who pilots
a Sukhoi Su-26MX aerobatic plane. Ms. Sergeeva, the current
women's world aerobatic champion, wins gasps of approval from
the knowledgeable, critical -- and mostly male -- audience
for her speedy, precise flips and loops.</p>
<p>Supersonic washers: Along with his colleagues, Boris
Rakitin, chief designer of the Sukhoi Design Bureau in
Moscow, has had a hand in the design of a number of
impressive Soviet attack planes, including the Su-27 fighter
that wows the crowds here every afternoon. But the Soviet
defense industry, like its counterparts elsewhere, is
changing its focus. Mr. Rakitin says he and his co-workers
are being required to design not only small, turboprop planes
for civilian use, but also washing machines. "It's not so
easy to make a good washing machine," he says. "There are the
hydrodynamic processes. And you have to get the dirt to
separate from the clothes."</p>
<p>Running with the herd: Despite skyrocketing jet kerosene
prices, the fuel-efficient propfan engine is a nonstarter.
General Electric of the U.S., one of the leading developers
of the technology, just couldn't drum up airline interest
when fuel cost 60 cents a gallon, says Robert J. Conboy, a GE
executive involved with the project. Airlines were afraid to
be different, he says, and they figured that if they ordered
what everybody else was buying they would all be in the same
boat even if prices did go up. Now that fuel is at $1 a
gallon and rising, everybody's already ordered planes
outfitted with conventional jet engines. "If we had stayed
the course, the engine would have been certified this year,"
says Mr. Conboy. "We would have been heroes." And airlines
would have cut fuel bills by 30% to 40% on propfan-powered
planes.</p>
<p>Missed opportunity: A search throughout the show's vast
exhibit halls turns up nary a maker of gas masks. Somewhere,
someone must be kicking himself.</p>
