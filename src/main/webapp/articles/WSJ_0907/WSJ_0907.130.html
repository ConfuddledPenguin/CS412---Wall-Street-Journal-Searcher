	<p class="article-leader">PROVIDENCE, R.I. -- Fleet/Norstar Financial Group Inc.
said its New Hampshire and Connecticut bank units have
entered into "memoranda of understanding" with federal
banking regulators concerning lending and management
practices.
   In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission,
Fleet said the memoranda -- a mild form of regulatory
punishment that serves as an acknowlegement of past mistakes
being corrected or since corrected -- include capital
adequacy, loan administration, reserve and charge-off
requirements, and underwriting practices.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>A number of New England banks have faced much harsher
regulatory disciplinary actions. Bank of New England, for
example, was forced to sign a cease-and-desist order in
March, one of the agency's strictest regulatory actions in
its arsenal, while Bank of Boston entered an agreement in
October to review a number of management functions.</p>
<p>Fleet/Norstar's New Hampshire and Connecticut units
comprise about 11% of Fleet's $35 billion in assets.</p>
<p>In the filing, Fleet said that at the request of its
regulators, it will "continue to refine and strengthen
oversight and reporting systems and procedures to permit it
to respond to the current negative economic environment."</p>
