	<p class="article-leader">MADISON, Wis. -- The food fight is over.
   Oscar Mayer Foods Corp. said it agreed to settle the
patent infringement lawsuit it filed in January that accused
Sara Lee Corp. of copying its design for a ready-to-eat
product called "Lunchables."</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Under terms of the agreement, Sara Lee will, among other
things, redesign its own "Lunch 'n Munch" package by Dec. 31,
said Oscar Mayer, a processed meat business of Philip Morris
Cos., New York.</p>
<p>Oscar Mayer said a design change that Sara Lee has already
made wasn't satisfactory.</p>
<p>Oscar Mayer wouldn't disclose the sum that it said Sara
Lee will pay it as a retroactive royalty on the packages that
Sara Lee has already produced.</p>
<p>Oscar Mayer's ready-to-eat "Lunchables" line and the
"Lunch 'n Munch" line sold by Sara Lee contain trays of
cheese, crackers and processed meat.</p>
<p>Oscar Mayer complained that the Sara Lee package was too
similar to its own -- a square see-through box containing a
three-compartment tray.</p>
<p>A Sara Lee spokeswoman said the company wouldn't comment.</p>
