	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Gold futures prices firmed as traders,
watching diplomatic moves fail to settle the Persian Gulf
crisis, concluded that chances of a military confrontation
are rising.
   The most active gold contract, for December, ended near
its high for the day with a gain of $3.20 an ounce at
$396.20. December silver was pulled up by gold and rose 3.3
cents an ounce to $4.87. October platinum was off $2 an ounce
at $482.20.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"Two weeks ago, the world was braced for a military clash
in the Middle East; but when it didn't take place, hope grew
that there would be a diplomatic settlement," said William
O'Neill, senior futures strategist for Merrill Lynch. "Now
that hope, too, is fading away, and traders are becoming
nervous once more."</p>
<p>A major reason that gold isn't reacting more strongly to
the Mideast crisis, Mr. O'Neill said, is that there is little
investor demand for bullion.</p>
<p>"There was very little Far Eastern buying interest for
gold bullion early in the year, but there was a pickup from
Taiwan in August," he said. "Japan wasn't much of a buyer,
even in August, and European demand has been even more
lackluster. Without purchases of bullion in the cash market,
prices have little chance of advancing significantly and,
even if they do, of holding onto their gains."</p>
<p>The continued strength in crude oil was a price-firming
factor in gold, said Greg Klochkoff, vice president of Bank
of Boston in Providence, R.I.</p>
<p>"Traders are also watching the headlines about the Middle
East and the White House reaction to the whole situation," he
said. Mr. Klochkoff said traders who previously sold gold
contracts short in anticipation of falling prices might
decide to cover, or buy back their positions, today so as not
get caught off base by any weekend developments in the Middle
East.</p>
<p>"If anything happens, it would most likely be something
that would make prices go up," he said. "The short-covering
could firm prices, but by late in the day {today} that demand
should fade, and prices could fall back somewhat."</p>
<p>Jeffrey Nichols, president of American Precious Metals
Advisors Inc. in Toronto, said in his latest review of the
precious metals market, released yesterday, that consumer
confidence in the U.S. is dropping. He said a recession in
the U.S. and a slowdown in the world economy could severely
affect buying of gold jewelry -- which is one of the most
discretionary and most postponable of all consumer purchases
but is the backbone of the gold market.</p>
<p>The world jewelry industry last year consumed an estimated
58.2 million ounces of gold, Mr. Nichols said, far exceeding
supplies from Western world mine production of about five
million ounces. The jewelry demand also absorbed more than
70% of all supplies entering the market from scrap and from
sales by Communist nations as well as from forward sales and
gold borrowings by mining companies, he said.</p>
<p>"Since the lion's share of jewelry sales occur during the
fourth-quarter holiday shopping spree, the state of the
consumer during the next few months will have a
disproportionately large bearing on how the year shapes up
for jewelry manufacturers," Mr. Nichols said.</p>
<p>As for the price of gold itself, it has "performed so
poorly for so long that Western investors will need to see
evidence of a sustainable bull market before returning with
confidence," he said.</p>
<p>In other commodity markets yesterday:</p>
<p>GRAINS and SOYBEANS: Prices gained ground for a second
consecutive day on rumors that the Soviet Union will be
granted emergency export credits after the Bush-Gorbachev
summit meeting this weekend. The Bush administration so far
hasn't given any indication whether such credits are in the
cards. The latest six-to-10-day forecast from the National
Weather Service, which calls for hot, dry weather across most
Midwestern and Southern growing regions, also is likely to
lend support to futures prices, analysts said. Soybean
futures for November delivery advanced 5.25 cents a bushel to
close at $6.3175. December corn futures gained 1.75 cents a
bushel to close at $2.3775, and December wheat futures rose
1.75 cents a bushel to close at $2.825.</p>
<p>SUGAR: Futures prices rose. The October contract advanced
0.47 cent a pound to 11.24 cents. A price-firming factor was
an announcement by Brazil late Wednesday that it would export
only 550,000 tons of raw sugar this season, according to
Judith Ganes, analyst for Merrill Lynch. That amount is down
from expectations in the sugar business that Brazilian
exports would be around 650,000 tons, and from its exports
last year of more than 700,000 tons, Ms. Ganes said. Brazil's
sugar season runs from June to May. Brazil appears to be
holding back some cane supplies as a precaution so it can use
them to make alcohol fuel for automobiles to help combat the
crude oil price surge triggered by the Mideast crisis, Ms.
Ganes said. Also, there is concern about immediately
available supplies of raw sugar in the world market, she
said. The present time represents a lull in the market before
the receipt of supplies from major growers such as Europe,
where the harvest is in progress, and Thailand, where
harvesting will reach its peak in December, according to Ms.
Ganes. Another possible price-firming factor was speculation
that the U.S. import quota may be raised next week, she said.
Currently the quota for the 21 months ending Sept. 30 is 3.2
million tons.</p>
<p>COPPER: Futures prices again advanced. The December
contract was up 1.20 cents a pound to $1.2340. Buying was
mostly technical, according to one analyst, who said the New
York market was also reflecting gains in London that were
prompted by production problems in Zambia, a major copper
supplier to Europe. The miners' strike in Peru, which was in
its 21st day, was also a price-firming factor, the analyst
said.</p>
