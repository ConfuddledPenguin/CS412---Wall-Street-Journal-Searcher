	<p class="article-leader">The Office of Thrift Supervision regained control of
Franklin Savings Association -- at least for the time being.
   The regulatory agency said a federal appellate court in
Denver issued a temporary order late yesterday blocking the
return of the thrift to management. The order came just a day
after a federal judge in Topeka, Kan., ordered the
institution returned, ruling that the agency had been
"arbitrary and capricious" in placing Franklin under the
conservatorship of the Resolution Trust Corp. in February.
The ruling cut short a celebration among employees and
managers of the Ottawa, Kan., thrift over the return of
company founder and chairman Ernest M. Fleischer.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>An OTS spokesman said he didn't know how long the
temporary stay would remain in effect, but that the RTC would
resume its conservatorship of Franklin immediately, pending a
ruling on its formal appeal, also filed yesterday.</p>
<p>Roger Stanton, an attorney for Franklin Savings, called
the order a procedural matter, granted to give the three
judges on the appellate court panel, who live in different
states, time to read the trial court's ruling. "It has
nothing to do with any substantive point," he said, adding
that if the appeals panel doesn't rule on the validity of the
judge's order within a week or two he will file a motion
asking the panel to speed its deliberations.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, U.S. District Judge Dale E. Saffels ordered
the agency to return the reins of the institution to Mr.
Fleischer, a decision that raised questions about federal
regulators' interpretation of the powers granted them under
last year's massive thrift reform package. If the decision
ultimately stands, it could embolden other thrifts to
challenge forced write-downs or regulatory takeovers.</p>
<p>The OTS originally placed Franklin in conservatorship
after the enactment of rigid new accounting standards for
thrifts. Under the new rules, the agency decided that
Franklin could no longer defer losses of $119 million on
futures contracts purchased to hedge against possible losses
in its unusual investment portfolio, which consisted
primarily of mortgage-backed securities. By forcing an
immediate write-down of those losses and others, Franklin's
capital fell below regulatory standards.</p>
<p>The hedging strategy was the underpinning of Mr.
Fleischer's much-ballyhooed plan to build a far-reaching
financial institution. He eschewed traditional mortgage
lending and short-term savings deposits to avoid the
interest-rate squeeze that trapped many thrifts. Of the
thrift's $11.4 billion in assets, more than 90% was invested
in mortgage-backed securities. To regulators, that strategy
was a high-risk bet on volatile investment instruments.</p>
<p>The OTS spokesman said the agency was confident it had
acted properly. In anticipation of the appellate court's
order, he said, the agency had taken a number of steps
earlier in the day to "control the situation down there." In
a letter from OTS director Timothy Ryan to Mr. Fleischer,
delivered yesterday, Franklin Savings management was ordered
to abide by current capital standards and to obtain prior
approval from OTS for any increase in salaries or payment of
bonuses to any officer or director. The letter also ordered
the thrift to get prior approval before purchasing any
high-risk mortgage-derivative product or reversing any
accounting entries made by the conservator.</p>
<p>The court's action won't sit well with Franklin employees,
who were glad to see the RTC go, even if it was only
temporary. Employees at the thrift's operations center in
Lenexa, Kan., already had posted a handmade sign that made
their feelings clear: The acronym RTC was circled and marked
out with a slash; around that, someone had written, "don't go
away mad, just go away."</p>
<p>For a time yesterday, it seemed that Judge Saffels's order
to return the thrift to management would hold up. Judge
Saffels refused to delay the order, which left lawyers for
the OTS scrambling to get a ruling from the Denver court. The
appellate court has been slow to act on such requests in the
past. OTS director Timothy Ryan removed Franklin from
conservatorship before the judge's 10 a.m. deadline and RTC
employees vacated the thrift's headquarters and eight
branches.</p>
<p>The news even reached the stock market, which reacted
positively. Franklin Savings's long-depressed stock rose in
over-the-counter "pink sheet" trading. That refers to the
colored paper on which prices are listed for non-Nasdaq,
over-the-counter stocks. Franklin's stock had been delisted
in April for having fallen below the NASD's minimum capital
and surplus requirements. By the time the appellate court
returned control to the RTC, the markets were closed.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Franklin Savings officials, some of whom seemed
stunned to be back in their offices after six and a half
months in exile, barely began the laborious task of assessing
what impact RTC supervision had on the institution's
financial condition. The institution's $4 billion in
deposits, which it had when the conservatorship was imposed
in February, had fallen by about $400 million to $500
million. "What I want to do is look at the securities
portfolio and see what's there, what's been sold and what our
hedges are," said Franklin Savings' president John Scowcroft.</p>
<p>He didn't get much of a chance before being evicted again,
and probably won't, at least until the appeals court rules on
the dispute.</p>
<p>For a few hours, though, Mr. Fleischer was a king again.
He embarked on a triumphant tour of Franklin operations,
where he was greeted by cheers and applause. "It's just great
to have Ernie back," said Rene Chamberlain, a manager at the
operations center in Lenexa.</p>
<p>Later, at the Olathe, Kan., branch, Mr. Fleischer accepted
several rounds of congratulations, then led the applause for
an unsuspecting young man who wandered in to open an account.
Kevin Spears, the Olathe branch manager, presented the
chairman with a token of appreciation, a baseball cap bearing
the slogan: "I think, therefore I am the boss."</p>
