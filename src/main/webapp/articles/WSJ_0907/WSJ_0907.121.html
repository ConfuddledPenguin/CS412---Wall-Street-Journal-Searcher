	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Stock prices tumbled, dragged down by the
latest surge in oil prices and concerns about the potential
escalation of tensions in the Middle East.
   Retailing issues were hit especially hard amid the release
of weak August sales reports, evidence of consumers'
nervousness about the state of the economy and the Mideast
crisis. Investors also dumped Motorola's stock after analysts
lowered their earnings expectations.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The Dow Jones Industrial Average, which has closed within
a trading range of about 40 points since the start of last
week, approached the low end of that range by tumbling 31.93
to 2596.29.</p>
<p>Among broader indexes, Standard & Poor's 500-Stock Index
dropped 3.93 to 320.46, the New York Stock Exchange Composite
Index dropped 1.87 to 176.06 and the Dow Jones Equity Market
Index fell 3.43 to 296.92.</p>
<p>Declining issues routed advancers by 960 to 511 on the Big
Board. Trading activity remained slow; volume totaled
125,620,000 shares, up slightly from 120,610,000 Wednesday.</p>
<p>Stocks headed lower from the opening bell, and the
sell-off gained momentum as the price of oil rallied above
$30 a barrel -- a level reached two weeks ago for the first
time since the early 1980s -- and then broke through the
$31-a-barrel mark. October crude-oil futures closed in New
York at $31.43 a barrel, up $1.66.</p>
<p>Reports that a U.S. citizen had been shot and wounded by
an Iraqi soldier in Kuwait and that the U.S. government is
telling Americans still in Kuwait to prepare for an
evacuation unsettled the market, traders said, as did rumors
of other shootings of Americans.</p>
<p>"The market's an emotional nightmare," said Thomas
Gallagher, managing director in charge of capital commitment
at Oppenheimer & Co., and will remain that way until
"something concrete comes out" to produce a resolution of the
Middle East crisis.</p>
<p>"The longer this goes on, the more concerned people
become," he says, and the worries are leading investors to
either walk away from the market or focus only on "very safe
stocks."</p>
<p>Limited Inc., which reported that sales for stores open at
least one year went up just 1% in August, tumbled 1 1/8 to 15
5/8 as more than 1.9 million shares changed hands.</p>
<p>Two other retailing stocks finished right behind Limited
on the most actives list Wal-Mart Stores went down 7/8 to 27
1/2 as 1.9 million shares were traded, while Toys "R" Us fell
3/4 to 23 3/4 on 1.8 million shares.</p>
<p>Sears Roebuck, which reported a 4.1% August sales gain for
stores open at least a year, retreated 1/2 to 29. As for
other major retailers, K mart dropped 3/8 to 27 1/8, J.C.
Penney skidded 1 to 45 7/8, Dayton Hudson fell 1 to 57 1/4,
Woolworth dipped 7/8 to 24 1/2 and Gap Inc. lost 1 7/8 to 53
1/8.</p>
<p>Carmine Grigoli, chief equity portfolio strategist at
First Boston, said retail sales are likely to weaken further
over the next few months, since consumers haven't yet felt
the full impact of rising oil prices.</p>
<p>"As that filters through, you can logically expect
spending to be cut back further, and that will weaken overall
economic activity," Mr. Grigoli said. "The economy seems to
be moving to the point of no return, and a recession appears
more likely."</p>
<p>Against that backdrop, he said, further disappointments in
corporate earnings can be expected in the third and fourth
quarters of this year -- "something that will certainly weigh
heavily on equity investors."</p>
<p>Motorola plunged 7 5/8 to 61 1/2 on 2.3 million shares
after analysts at a number of brokerage firms lowered
earnings estimates in response to concerns about the strength
of the company's business in a weakening economic
environment.</p>
<p>Smith Barney, Harris Upham lowered its investment rating
on Motorola to "avoid" from "hold." Analyst James L. Barlage,
noting that he had lowered estimates on the company and other
chipmakers more than a month ago, told Dow Jones Professional
Investor Report the company has been developing "structural
weaknesses," citing softness in its communications business
and continuing losses in its computer business.</p>
<p>Paramount Communications dropped 5/8 to 34 7/8. Chairman
Martin S. Davis said earnings for the fiscal year ending in
October will be "at the lower end" of the company's
forecasted range of $2.10 to $2.60 a share.</p>
<p>Fedders, which said it expects to report losses for the
third and fourth quarters as a result of weak sales,
retreated 1 3/4 to 7 3/8.</p>
<p>Goodyear Tire & Rubber fell 7/8 to 22 1/4 after
forecasting a third-quarter loss of about $65 million,
reflecting planned charges of about $51 million for
additional restructuring of its tire operations and
environmental cleanup work.</p>
<p>MNC Financial lost 3/4 to 5 7/8 on nearly one million
shares. Rumors that Alfred Lerner, an MNC director, might
back out of an agreement to boost the bank holding company's
capital through the purchase of $180 million in preferred
stock fueled the stock's downturn, according to the Dow Jones
investor report. The company said it wasn't aware of any
change of heart by Mr. Lerner, who couldn't be reached for
comment.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, major oil stocks closed mixed despite the
latest surge in oil prices.</p>
<p>Exxon fell 1/2 to 50 3/8 on 1.8 million shares, while
Chevron went up 1/8 to 77 3/4, Texaco rose 1/4 to 64, Mobil
added 1/2 to 66 1/4, Amoco ended unchanged at 57 3/4 and
Atlantic Richfield closed unchanged at 138 3/4.</p>
<p>Other energy issues fared better, with shares of several
gas-pipeline companies among the standouts. Enron climbed 3
3/8 to 55 3/8, Arkla added 1/2 to 19 7/8, Transco Energy rose
1 3/8 to 45 3/8 and Coastal rose 5/8 to 37.</p>
<p>Edison Brothers Stores, bucking the drop among retailers,
gained 1 1/4 to 26 3/4. The company reported that its fiscal
second-quarter earnings were up 25.9% from a year earlier and
its August sales were up 17.5% overall. Also, its board
approved the repurchase of as many as one million common
shares, or about 4.7% of its shares outstanding.</p>
<p>The American Stock Exchange Market Value Index fell 0.91
to 324.50. Volume totaled 10,560,000 shares.</p>
