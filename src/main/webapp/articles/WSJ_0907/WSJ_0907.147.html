	<p class="article-leader">PARIS -- Skis Rossignol S.A., plagued by mounting losses
after three winters of poor snow conditions, plans to buy a
U.S. golf company in an effort to pull itself out of the red
through greater diversification.
   Rossignol General Manager Jean-Jacques Bompard said in an
interview that the company hopes to present to the annual
meeting Sept. 19 a finalized agreement to buy a small but
aggressive U.S. golf concern for about 100 million francs
($19.1 million) to balance its ski-based product line.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>He said the unidentified target isn't yet a major player
in the U.S. golf market, but that Rossignol thinks its
technical and marketing acumen can propel it into the big
leagues. "The talks are well under way. I expect a decision
in the next 10 days," said Mr. Bompard, noting that Rossignol
was attracted to the company because of its "very competitive
line of high-quality equipment."</p>
<p>This would represent an initial step by the world's
leading ski maker to face up to anticipated losses of 85
million francs for the fiscal year ending March 31, 1991,
following a 9.3 million franc deficit in fiscal 1990.
Revenue, meanwhile, is expected to slip to 1.39 billion
francs in fiscal 1991 from 1.47 billion francs a year
earlier.</p>
<p>A lack of snow in the Alps and the western U.S. for three
consecutive seasons, combined with the French franc's recent
strength against the yen and the dollar, has caused most of
the damage.</p>
<p>Grenoble-based Rossignol has begun a three-year, 100
million-franc modernization program at two main ski factories
to try to cut costs and improve quality. The plants have
combined annual production capacity of one million pairs of
skis.</p>
<p>Mr. Bompard said both programs will be self-financed,
drawing in part on resources derived from a 100 million franc
capital boost in November 1989 that helped reduced the
group's debt-to-capital ratio to 47.5% from 95% two years
ago.</p>
<p>However, doubts about Rossignol remain in the French
investment community. Stock analysts aren't confident about
management's plans to expand summer-sports activities beyond
the minor tennis operations that currently account for about
6% of revenue.</p>
<p>Rossignol has made tennis rackets that carry its name
since 1977 and sells an average 350,000 rackets a year, well
below sales of leading brands Dunlop, Kennex, Prince, Wilson
and Head.</p>
<p>Analysts question to what extent the company's balance
sheet will benefit, citing the example of sporting goods
counterpart Salomon S.A., which gets 28% of its revenue from
its Taylor-Made golf operations. Salomon had a loss of 91
million francs in the fiscal year ended March 31, prompting
work force cutbacks scheduled to start this month. Even
though golf sales grew 45% in the quarter ended June 30, its
total revenue was off 26%.</p>
<p>But golf or no golf, analysts say, Rossignol will remain
hostage to the foreign-exchange market. As long as the franc
holds firm, sales figures will suffer.</p>
