	<p class="article-leader">Prince Holdings Inc., the maker of tennis rackets and
other sports-related products, said it agreed to be acquired
by Edizione Holding S.p.A. of Italy, which controls apparel
maker Benetton and ski-equipment maker Nordica.
   Terms weren't disclosed. Prince said its senior management
would be retained by Edizione, and that Prince managers would
maintain a small stake in the company.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The Princeton, N.J., company said it expected to report
sales of about $185 million for fiscal 1990, ending Sept. 30.
In 1989, the company reported operating profit of $18 million
on revenue of $158 million.</p>
<p>Prince said the transaction will provide much needed
capital for the company's plans to enter into other sporting
goods businesses such as golfing equipment and sports
apparel. In addition, the company said it decided to sell so
it could expand its world-wide sales efforts. "This sale will
enable Prince to continue its growth and development," said
John M. Sullivan, chairman of Prince Holdings.</p>
<p>Prince was acquired in 1987 in a leveraged buy-out led by
senior management and Brentwood Associates, a Los
Angeles-based investment firm, from ChesebroughPonds Inc., a
unit of Unilever Group. In October 1988, it acquired Ektelon,
maker of racquetball equipment, from Browning, a unit of
Fabrique Nationale Herstal S.A. of Belgium.</p>
