	<p class="article-leader">HOUSTON -- An oil-industry consortium has quietly stepped
up development work on a possible giant offshore platform in
the Gulf of Mexico at which supertankers would unload far
from beaches and crowded ports.
   Advocates of the facility say it could substantially cut
chances of shoreline damage from oil spills. But the project
has sparked criticism from some quarters on the grounds that
it may thwart a movement toward double-hulled tankers, which
are also aimed at reducing spills.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The system, called TexPort, would become only the second
such offshore unloading facility in the U.S. and would cost
from $600 million to $1.3 billion, depending on its capacity.
A decision on whether to go ahead with construction is
expected in about six months. The only similar facility is
the Louisiana Offshore Oil Port, or LOOP.</p>
<p>In its more than eight years of operation LOOP claims it
has never had a significant oil spill. "We haven't {had any
spills}, and you shouldn't from a deep-water port," says
William C. Foster, a Washington lobbyist for LOOP.</p>
<p>If constructed at its largest size, the platform under
consideration would be able to unload and send ashore by
pipeline as much as two million barrels of crude oil a day.
That's about one-third of all such U.S. imports. Taken
together, TexPort and LOOP at full capacity could unload more
than half the crude the U.S. buys right now.</p>
<p>The possible venture has widespread environmental support
along the Gulf Coast. "In the past year Texans have had to
watch almost helplessly as more than five million gallons of
crude oil or petroleum products have been spilled along the
Texas Gulf Coast," says Texas Railroad Commissioner John
Sharp. A project like TexPort "could eliminate the potential
for harbor accidents and resulting harmful spills," he
contends.</p>
<p>"You've got improved odds," agrees Charlie Mast, vice
president of crude-oil supply for Amoco Corp., which has
expressed "definite interest" in the project. The
environmental attractiveness gives TexPort "a plus" in
planners' minds and regulators who would have to approve any
such project, he says.</p>
<p>At a closed-door meeting earlier this week, the industry
group, including representatives from Exxon Corp., Mobil
Corp., Atlantic Richfield Co. and the Shell Oil Co. unit of
Royal Dutch/Shell Group, agreed to go ahead with Phase Two of
the project, which includes a marketing study and examination
of regulatory hurdles.</p>
<p>Planners say the TexPort platform would sit off of
Freeport, Texas, in about 110 feet of water, deep enough to
accommodate almost all of the world's giant oil tankers.
Incoming vessels would tie up to buoys and connect to hoses
that run from them to the sea floor. A pipeline under the sea
bottom would then take the oil to the central pumping and
control platform. From there, two larger undersea pipelines
would move crude ashore and five miles inland to a "tank
farm" that could store as much as 24 million barrels.</p>
<p>From the storage facility, the oil could move through any
part of a spiderweb of existing pipelines that serve the
scores of refining and petrochemical plants near the Texas
coast. It could also move north through some commercial
pipelines.</p>
<p>Engineering, cost and economic studies have already
declared the project is viable, says Jim Stephens, a manager
for Phillips Petroleum Co., which has been acting as the
consortium's lead company. He says the group now consists of
18 concerns, though some could leave the project at any time.
If a decision is made to build the facility, construction and
approvals necessary for full operation could take five years,
those involved say.</p>
<p>Others including Phillips have considered building
deep-water ports in the past. Coastal Corp. even received
government approval for an offshore terminal in 1981, but
never built one because it couldn't round up enough partners.
However, "The environmental concern was not a big factor back
then," recalls a Coastal official.</p>
<p>The logistics of moving a growing stream of Middle East
oil through a clogged U.S. distribution infrastructure were
behind construction of LOOP in the late 1970s. "The large
tankers couldn't come to shore," explains a spokesman for
Ashland Oil Inc., one of the five oil companies that own
LOOP.</p>
<p>Similar concerns are now a big factor in TexPort. Imports
account for 50% of domestic oil consumption, and more and
more Middle East oil is expected in the years ahead. The most
economic way to ship oil to the U.S. from there is on
supertankers too big to dock at any domestic onshore ports.
Such ships can either unload at LOOP or anchor and pump their
cargo into several smaller vessels in a process called
lightering. "We don't know if ports on the Texas coast can
accommodate all the traffic" that process could generate,
says Mr. Stephens of Phillips.</p>
<p>"Eventually we'll need {TexPort}," says Bernard Picchi, an
analyst at Salomon Brothers Inc. But he wonders about the
timing. In the early '80s, just as LOOP was coming on line,
conservation efforts and other factors in the U.S. led to a
drop in Mideast imports. As a result, LOOP didn't make a dime
until last year.</p>
