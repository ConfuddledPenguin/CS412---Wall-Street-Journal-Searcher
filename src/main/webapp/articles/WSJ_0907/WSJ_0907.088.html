	<p class="article-leader">SYDNEY, Australia -- Qantas Airways might court major
foreign carriers as shareholders, Chairman Bill Dix said. The
Australian government, which owns Qantas, is considering the
sale of at least part of the international airline.
   "In the context of consolidation in world aviation, I
wouldn't be at all surprised to see Qantas taking additional
equity stakes in smaller carriers, like those we already hold
in Air New Zealand and Air Pacific," Mr. Dix said at a
tourism seminar. "Furthermore, I wouldn't rule out the
acquisition of a stake in Qantas by some of the major
carriers with which we do and will be doing business. Japan
Air Lines, {AMR Corp.'s} American, British Airways and
Lufthansa {German Airlines} come to mind as carriers we'll be
working with closely."</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The Australian government's cabinet yesterday decided to
sell stakes in Qantas and Australian Airlines, one of two
major domestic airlines. The cabinet also decided in
principle to expose the government-owned monopoly telephone
company to competition.</p>
<p>Prime Minister Bob Hawke didn't say how much of the
airlines' share capital the government might sell. Analysts
speculated that stakes of at least 49% might be put on the
market. The Labor Party still must approve the sales.</p>
<p>Mr. Dix said that "without access to the necessary capital
funds, both debt and equity, Qantas will be unable to
maintain the growth needed to service Australia's expanding
tourism industry."</p>
