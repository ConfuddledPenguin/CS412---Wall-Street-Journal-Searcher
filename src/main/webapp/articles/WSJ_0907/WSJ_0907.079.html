	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- Bruised by weakening consumer demand and
deteriorating profits, U.S. businesses are continuing to pare
their capital-spending plans, a Commerce Department survey
shows.
   Responding to questions in July and early August,
businesses said they planned to raise capital spending 5.4%
this year. That compares with the 6.8% increase projected
when they were last asked about their plans, in April and
May, and the 8.1% rise they forecast at the beginning of the
year.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The results reflect growing concern about the economy,
which has made businesses increasingly reluctant to commit to
big investments.</p>
<p>The cutbacks could be sowing the seeds of problems beyond
the capital-goods industries. Economists say curbing
expenditures on new plant and equipment now will impede
future economic growth and efficiency.</p>
<p>"If we curtail capital spending, we won't be building the
productivity enhancement and the technology to improve
international competitiveness," said Joseph Duncan, chief
economist at Dun & Bradstreet in New York. "I worry we'll
lose that international edge if businesses cut back
investment."</p>
<p>If businesses follow through on the plans reported on the
survey, 1990 will see a sharp slowdown in capital spending
from recent years' levels.</p>
<p>U.S. businesses have gone through something of a
capital-spending boom over the past two years. In 1989,
despite evidence of a slowing economy, they bolstered capital
spending by 11.4%; in 1988, the increase was 11%.</p>
<p>After adjusting for inflation, the planned rise in capital
spending this year would amount to a 5.1% increase from last
year, compared with gains of 10.4% in 1989 and 9.5% in 1988.</p>
<p>Several important industries are planning actual decreases
in capital spending this year, according to the report,
including the auto industry and makers of nonelectrical
machinery, a category that includes computers.</p>
<p>But auto makers aren't planning nearly as big a cut as
they were at the start of the year. In the July-August
survey, car manufacturers expected spending on new plant and
equipment to slip just 0.6% this year, compared with planned
declines of 6% in the April-May survey and 11.2% in the
January-March survey.</p>
<p>The industries planning the biggest increases are paper,
electrical machinery and nonferrous metals.</p>
<p>The Commerce Department surveys were mailed to businesses
June 30 with an Aug. 1 due date. Although some weren't
returned until mid-August, most of the responses were made
before Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait, which has threatened
the economy by driving up world oil prices.</p>
<p>Surveys are already showing that consumer confidence has
plummeted in the wake of spiraling oil prices. Some analysts
believe businesses also may become increasingly nervous about
the economic outlook, and that could curb capital spending
further.</p>
<p>Here is the breakdown by major industries of capital
spending results for past periods and estimates for current
and future periods. For comparability with annual totals, the
quarterly figures are at seasonally adjusted annual rates, in
billions of dollars:</p>
