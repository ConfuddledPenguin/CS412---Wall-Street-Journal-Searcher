	<p class="article-leader">CHICAGO -- Santa Fe Pacific Corp. said its SFP Pipeline
Holdings Inc. unit is offering $219 million of variable-rate
exchangeable debentures, due 2010, at a price of 92% of face
amount.
   Santa Fe, a transportation and natural resources concern,
said the unit will use about half of the net proceeds to pay
a dividend to Santa Fe and will lend the remainder to Santa
Fe.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>In July, the Santa Fe unit filed a registration statement
covering the offering. Santa Fe said it will use the funds to
pay off part of its 16% redeemable senior subordinated
debentures.</p>
<p>Goldman, Sachs & Co. is the managing underwriter of the
offering, the company said.</p>
