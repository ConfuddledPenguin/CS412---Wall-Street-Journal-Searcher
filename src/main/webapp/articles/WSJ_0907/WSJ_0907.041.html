	<p class="article-leader">If Karen Elliott House is correct in describing Jordan's
King Hussein as "a little organ grinder leading around a
giant gorilla on a leash" (editorial page, Aug. 14), then how
are we to describe the world leaders who played footsie with
Saddam Hussein during and after the Iran-Iraq war?
   I'm amazed that Ms. House failed to mention the $50
billion (and perhaps considerably more) in weapons and
electronics equipment shipped to Iraq by the U.S., West
Germany, France, the Soviet Union and Japan. If Americans get
killed in Saudi Arabia, it won't be with camels made in
Jordan, but with sophisticated military hardware. We were
absolute fools to believe that we could safely build up
Saddam Hussein as a counterweight to Iran without taking
major risks ourselves. We've done the same before with the
likes of Manuel Noriega, and sooner or later the piper must
be paid.</p>

that leaves for the West is that of the little monkeys
begging for favors from the monster it created.</p>
