	<p class="article-leader">PHOENIX, Ariz. -- A Pinnacle West Capital Corp.
shareholder charged the utility holding company and its
directors with entering into a "greenmail" pact with
PacifiCorp "to neutralize PacifiCorp's takeover threat."
   PacifiCorp, a utility company based in Portland, Ore.,
agreed Friday to drop its 10-month pursuit of Pinnacle West
in exchange for seasonal power swaps with Pinnacle West's
Arizona utility unit in an agreement valued at $260 million.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>In a suit filed Wednesday in state court here, the
shareholder alleges that the transaction is a breach of the
defendants' fiduciary duty and was reached by the directors
primarily to entrench themselves and company management.</p>
<p>A Pinnacle West spokesman said he couldn't comment on the
suit because the company hadn't seen it. PacifiCorp, which
wasn't named as a defendant, said it doesn't comment on
litigation.</p>
<p>The suit seeks to block consummation of the power-swap
agreement and unspecified damages if it is completed. The
suit was brought by Moise Katz of New York, who owns 100
Pinnacle West shares, "for the benefit" of the company.</p>
<p>Greenmail is a term usually applied to the practice in
which outsiders buy a company's stock and then entice the
company to buy the shares back at a premium to avoid a
takeover. In the suit, greenmail refers to the power-sharing
agreement being used to avoid a takeover.</p>
<p>Since that agreement was reached, the price of Pinnacle
West shares, which are traded on the New York Stock Exchange,
has dropped $3.125 to $13.</p>
