	<p class="article-leader">REDMOND, Wash. -- Nintendo of America Inc. said it
launched a campaign against video-game pirates by filing
several federal copyright infringement lawsuits against some
retailers and by cooperating with federal customs agents in a
recent "sting" of alleged Nintendo game cartridge
counterfeiters.
   The U.S. unit of Nintendo Co. of Japan said the actions
were necessary to try to halt the "outrageous theft of
Nintendo's valuable intellectual property rights."</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>In its lawsuits, filed in three states and Canada,
Nintendo said it seeks to stop retailers and video-game
rental outlets from selling or renting pirated versions of
its proprietary video-game cartridges. These versions are
so-called multiple game devices that contain as many as 40
counterfeit Nintendo licensed video games, the company said.
Nintendo itself doesn't make multiple game cartridges.</p>
<p>Thus far, according to Nintendo, the counterfeit
cartridges, most of which come from Taiwan, have been found
only in video-game rental outlets or in retail stores that
aren't part of Nintendo's authorized dealer network.</p>
<p>Nintendo said 700 such cartridges were seized in the
recent arrest of a Taiwanese couple and two U.S. citizens in
Wilmington, N.C. The company said the four people offered to
sell the cartridges to undercover U.S. Customs agents for
$60,000.</p>
