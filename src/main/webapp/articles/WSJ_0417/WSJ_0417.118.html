	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- The dollar climbed against all major
currencies yesterday on optimism about the U.S. trade results
for February and with the additional boost of what was
apparently a speculative move in early New York trading.
   The mark surged against its Japanese counterpart,
finishing above the psychologically important 95-yen level in
Tokyo trading. After bobbing above and below 95 yen in New
York, the mark settled at 94.96 yen, above 94.90 yen late
Friday in New York.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Dealers said the mark led the dollar's move up against the
Japanese unit.</p>
<p>With trading in much of Europe, Hong Kong and Australia
closed for the Easter holidays, activity was quiet around the
globe. But dealers said the U.S. unit's advance yesterday,
particularly against the yen, could be a sign of things to
come.</p>
<p>In Tokyo, Katsumi Asako, chief corporate dealer with
Standard Chartered Bank, said the view that Wednesday's U.S.
trade report will be very good is so widespread that many
participants are going long dollars before the report is
released.</p>
<p>The deficit is seen narrowing to a seasonally adjusted
$7.6 billion from January's $9.25 billion deficit, according
to the average of estimates of 15 economists surveyed. But
talk is circulating in the currency markets that the number
could be as low as $4.5 billion to $5 billion, dealers said.</p>
<p>Standard Chartered's Mr. Asako said a big improvement in
the U.S. merchandise trade deficit could probably overcome
strong resistance to the dollar at 160.35 yen, near the U.S.
unit's recent high set April 2 against the Japanese currency.</p>
<p>The U.S. unit got a strong boost in early New York dealing
on what Alexis Egan, a corporate trader at Banque Indosuez in
New York, said was probably some speculative trading by a few
participants taking advantage of the illiquidity in the
market.</p>
<p>The speculators bought dollars, pushing it to levels that
triggered stop-loss buying of more dollars, she said. The
stop-loss buying gave the U.S. currency a ride higher, where
the speculators sold it to take profits, she said.</p>
<p>In late New York trading yesterday, the dollar was quoted
at 1.6775 marks, up from 1.6724 marks late Thursday and
1.6720 marks late Friday, and at 159.30 yen, up from 158.18
yen late Thursday and from 158.70 yen late Friday. Sterling
was quoted at $1.6300, down from $1.6415 Thursday and $1.6368
Friday.</p>
<p>Early Tuesday in Tokyo, the dollar was trading at 159.75
yen, up a bit from Monday's Tokyo close of 159.42 yen.</p>
<p>Banque Indosuez's Ms. Egan said the U.S. unit might also
have strengthened because the Bank of Japan didn't raise the
nation's discount rate. The discount rate is the central
bank's base rate on loans to commercial banks. Such an action
over the weekend had been rumored last week.</p>
<p>Roy Tillenburg, a trader at Connecticut National Bank in
Hartford, said the market is going long dollars not only
because of expectations for a better trade performance, but
also because talks between the U.S. and Japan are expected to
improve the trade picture further.</p>
<p>There is less risk in taking a position on expectations of
a good trade number than on a bad one, Mr. Tillenburg said.</p>
<p>Tom Trettien, vice president for corporate foreign
exchange at Credit Lyonnais in New York, said the dollar is
poised to move higher. He said recent U.S. economic data
suggest that interest rates won't be coming down.</p>
<p>By contrast, the dollar will be contained within narrow
ranges against the mark, said Connecticut National's Mr.
Tillenburg. The market has built the most inflationary
currency exchange rate of one East German mark for one West
German mark into current rates, but the mark could be hurt by
other developments, he said, mentioning the strife between
the Soviet Union and the republic of Lithuania as one
potential reason to buy dollars for marks.</p>
<p>On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for current
delivery settled at $375.20 an ounce, down 70 cents.
Estimated volume was a light 1.6 million ounces.</p>
<p>In Hong Kong Tuesday, gold opened for trading at $374.05
an ounce.</p>
