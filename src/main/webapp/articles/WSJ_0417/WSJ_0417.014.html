	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Big blue-chip stocks outperformed smaller
stocks again yesterday, continuing a trend that has prevailed
for most of the 1980s.
   However, small stocks seem to be starting to catch up to
big stocks, which would be good news for a market that lately
has been led higher by relatively few stocks.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Yet, a number of investors expect big stocks to outpace
smaller shares this year. They say big blue-chip shares
typically do better in a year of economic uncertainty.
Moreover, they expect foreign investors to keep buying the
biggest U.S. stocks this year because the shares are easy to
trade, and companies such as McDonald's Corp. and Coca-Cola
Co. are known world-wide. Also, most of the largest stocks
are in Standard & Poor's 500-stock index, attracting the
buying power of more than $200 billion in investment money
that attempts to duplicate the S&P 500.</p>
<p>Even from a fundamental standpoint, small stocks don't
appear excessively inexpensive, says David Rajala, director
of equity management at One Federal Asset Management, which
typically invests in large stocks. "We are skeptical that
small stocks are getting ready to outperform," he says.</p>
<p>The engine of the stock market over the past year has been
big stocks. New York Stock Exchange stocks with a median
market capitalization of $10 billion had a total return-price
change plus dividends -- of 25.7% in the 12 months ended
March 30, according to Dalton, Greiner, Hartman, Maher & Co.,
a new money management firm. The smallest stocks on the Big
Board, with a median capitalization of $53 million, lost 10%
on a total return basis for the year.</p>
<p>But more recently, small stocks have started to catch the
attention of money managers. For this year, through last
Thursday when trading ended for the week, median returns on
the Big Board's smallest stocks were down 2.6% compared with
a decline of 2.4% for the largest stocks.</p>
<p>Is the long cycle of small-stock underperformance over?
"It appears that the deterioration of small stocks relative
to large stocks has stopped," says James Awad, president of
BMI Capital, a money management firm. He points out that in
the first quarter the biggest stocks still led performance,
but some average-sized stocks lagged the smallest shares.</p>
<p>More investors are thinking of companies in terms of
earnings potential, rather than buy-out value, Mr. Awad says.
And more investors are taking a closer look at younger,
smaller companies whose earnings are growing at rapid rates,
he says. This year, he says, "safety" may not mean owning
stocks of big companies with predictable earnings, but rather
stocks of companies, both large and small, which have strong
franchises and innovative products that assure earnings
strength in a sluggish economy.</p>
<p>"If the general thinking is that small caps are the place
to be, the trend will be in place for several years until
small caps get overvalued," Mr. Awad predicts. He says the
last cycle of small stock outperformance lasted from the
fourth quarter of 1977 to the third quarter of 1983. For 1983
alone, the bottom 20% of all publicly traded companies, based
on market capitalization, gained 39.6% on a total return
basis compared with 22.51% in the S&P 500.</p>
<p>Timothy G. Dalton, Jr., chairman and president of Dalton,
Greiner, is banking on small stocks. Mr. Dalton says 45% of
the $2 billion the firm has under management is invested in
stocks with a capitalization of $2 billion or less. He says
many of these small and medium-sized companies are
manufacturing or technology concerns, which are two sectors
he's bullish on.</p>
<p>"We see an opportunity to capture a double play -- good
fundamentals and earnings growth," says Mr. Dalton. Smaller
companies also tend to be less leveraged and therefore pay
less in interest payments and more to the bottom line.</p>
<p>Kenneth J. Greiner, executive vice president of the firm,
says consumption should begin to decrease as a percentage of
gross national product, while capital expenditures -- from
research and development to refurbishing factories -- should
rise.</p>
