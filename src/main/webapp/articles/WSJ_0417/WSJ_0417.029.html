	<p class="article-leader">PITTSBURGH -- Sony Corp. of Japan is expected to announce
today that it will assemble television sets in a New Stanton,
Pa., factory formerly operated by Volkswagen AG.
   The expected move is a victory for Pennsylvania and its
governor, Robert P. Casey, who has lobbied hard for years to
find a new tenant for the mothballed factory. Gov. Casey is
expected to be here today to announce details of the state's
agreement with Sony. The governor's office declined to
comment.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The new Sony factory initially will employ 1,000 people to
make television sets in the 2.8 million-square-foot plant,
which Volkswagen closed in 1988. Sony employment there is
expected to climb to 2,000.</p>
<p>The plant eventually could produce high-definition
television sets, people close to the negotiations said. Sony
officials declined to comment on their plans.</p>
<p>Sony, which already operates five U.S. plants, makes most
of its television sets for the U.S. market in facilities in
California.</p>
<p>For the expansion, Sony considered sites in Kentucky, Ohio
and other states before selecting the western Pennsylvania
factory. Those states have frequently offered hefty incentive
packages to other Japanese companies, which are eager to
establish U.S. manufacturing sites.</p>
<p>In this instance, Pennsylvania appears to have agreed to
foot at least part of Sony's costs. The package calls for the
state to buy the Volkswagen plant from the West German auto
maker and then lease it to Sony's U.S. division, officials
said.</p>
<p>The state also offered Sony loans for infrastructure
projects, such as sewer and water lines. The incentive
package also includes job training funds, the people familiar
with the situation said.</p>
<p>Sony is expected to assemble the TV sets at the
Pennsylvania site using imported parts from a variety of
international suppliers. Some could come from Sony's own
factories in Asia, as well as other suppliers outside the
U.S.</p>
