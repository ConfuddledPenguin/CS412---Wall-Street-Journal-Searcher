	<p class="article-leader">HOLD ON to company shares, many firms suggest to
executives. Few insist.
   Chrysler Corp. raised some eyebrows a few weeks back by
asking 100 top officers to own their "fair share" of the auto
maker by holding stock equal to a certain percentage of their
pay. Details haven't been disclosed, but Mark Edwards of
consultant Sibson & Co. says Chrysler is probably the first
company to detail its expectations. Most companies award
stock or options to executives as part of long-term incentive
programs, but executives generally sell the shares soon after
any restrictions expire, he says.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>T. Boone Pickens belittles chief executives who don't
invest at least half their net worth in their company's
stock. He says 90% of his assets are sunk in his Mesa L.P.
Bruce Karatz, CEO of Kaufman & Broad Home Corp., asserts
"there's no better way {than stock ownership} to align the
interests of management and shareholders." But though Dow
Chemical Co. would like executives to retain shares "until
their golden years," the company says it's "not inclined to
impose such rules on our people."</p>
<p>At Upjohn Co., "once the stock has been awarded, the
executive can do whatever he or she wants."</p>
<p>CHILD-CARE BILL sleeper clauses would cut benefits for
some parents.</p>
<p>Little-noticed provisions of the House-backed measure
would phase out two tax benefits for families with adjusted
gross incomes of $70,000 or more, notes Henry Saveth of
consultant Foster Higgins. At present, families may set aside
up to $5,000 in pretax dollars with employers to pay for baby
sitters and other dependent care. The House bill would cut
the set-aside $250 for each $1,000 of earnings above $70,000.</p>
<p>The bill, similarly, would curb the dependent-care tax
credit. That credit now is at least 20% of up to $2,400 spent
for one dependent and $4,800 for two or more, reduced by any
money paid under an employer set-aside program. The bill
would reduce the credit one percentage point for each $1,000
of income over $70,000. The changes, Congress figures, could
cost the families $1.5 billion over the next five years. The
outlook, though, is unclear: The Senate would retain the
benefits and the White House threatens a veto over other
provisions.</p>
<p>EASTERN EUROPE: A looming market but where's the talent to
tap it?</p>
<p>General Electric Co. looks to expand by strengthening
businesses already operating there, such as a lighting
venture in Hungary. Borg-Warner Corp. relies on its own staff
and West European corporate "friends who have walked the path
already." ArcherDaniels-Midland Co. gets help from a
50%-owned affiliate in Hamburg.</p>
<p>Few companies seem to be doing much U.S. hiring.
Anheuser-Busch Cos. won't expand East until it reaches a
trademark pact with a Czech brewer. Ball Corp. wants to first
develop a greater presence in West Europe. PepsiCo Inc.,
which recently concluded a major barter deal with the Soviet
Union, says it prefers local executives "who speak the
language and understand the local marketing environment."</p>
<p>Yet U.S. recruiters aggressively promote their services
and compile lists of multilingual talent.</p>
<p>SENIOR EXECUTIVE HIRING eased 3% in the first quarter from
a year before, Korn/Ferry International says. Demand rose for
general managers but declined for marketing and finance
officials.</p>
<p>BUT SOMEBODY is hiring. Executive Recruiter News figures
global revenue of U.S. search firms will top $3 billion this
year, split between recruiters on retainers and those paid
when a placement is made.</p>
<p>A NEW YORK appeals court rules a financial analyst can
bring a discrimination suit against an investment banking
firm that denied him a job because, he alleges, a urine
sample erroneously tested positive for drugs. The
unidentified plaintiff contends another test would have shown
the reading resulted from eating poppy seeds.</p>
<p>SLAM DUNK] John Griffin quits PaineWebber, where he was a
vice president in municipal bond underwriting, to become head
basketball coach at St. Joseph's University in Philadelphia,
where he had played 12 years ago.</p>
<p>UNION MEMBERSHIP could drop to one in 20 workers by
decade's end.</p>
<p>The 15-year plunge in union ranks -- to 12% of
private-sector workers in 1988 from 25% in 1973 -- will
continue its free fall, predict Stephen Bronars of the
University of California at Santa Barbara and Donald Deere of
Texas A&M. "Extrapolating recent trends implies that the
private sector unionization rate could well fall below 5% by
the year 2000," they say.</p>
<p>The economists figure that 5% of the decline in the 1980s
can be laid to a drop in successful union organizing
campaigns. They attribute 65% of the loss to reduced
employment in unionized industries and 30% to increased
employment in nonunionized fields. But this shift, too, may
be laid, at least in small part, at union's door.</p>
<p>It came as a unionized worker's wage premium over a
nonunionized neighbor was widening to 20.4% from 14.6%.</p>
<p>THE CHECKOFF: How's that? A lump-sum pension-plan pay out
that can't be rolled over into an IRA as a "qualified total
distribution" may be rolled over in full as a "partial
distribution," the Research Institute of America explains. .

air fresheners but also take more risks, which may not be so
good, Rensselaer Polytechnic psychologist Robert Baron says.</p>
