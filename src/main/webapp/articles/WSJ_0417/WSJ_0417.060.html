	<p class="article-leader">Washington, D.C. -- Few modern artists are as immediately
seductive and yet as persistently elusive as the French
painter Edouard Vuillard (1868-1940). In his hands, a swatch
of patterned wallpaper, a kitchen sideboard, or a brocaded
skirt under lamplight achieves an almost unbearable
sumptuousness. But who can explain the appeal? Why are his
homely scenes so much more than the sum of their parts?
   Both the rich sensuousness and the quiet mysteries of
Vuillard's art are everywhere evident in a splendid new
exhibition of small oil paintings that originated at the
Museum of Fine Arts in Houston and is now on view at the
Phillips Collection here. "The Intimate Interiors of Edouard
Vuillard" contains some 70 paintings from the 1890s, the
decade in which the young artist blossomed into maturity and
painted many of his greatest works. More than half the works
included are from private collections.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Born in Cuiseaux, some three hundred miles from Paris,
Vuillard was the son of a soldier who turned to tax
collecting when invalided out of the army. The Vuillards
moved to Paris in 1877, and young Edouard, strictly educated
by the Marist fathers, was planning on a military career. "I
could think of nothing else," he recalled in later life, "in
which I could possibly distinguish myself." But by the time
his father died, in 1884, he had begun to dabble in art, and
within a few years had devoted himself to painting with
results that were distinguished indeed.</p>
<p>In the early 1890s, Vuillard became a founding member of
the Nabis, a loose-knit band of artists influenced by Gauguin
and the French symbolists. Other members of the group
included Ker-Xavier Roussel, Maurice Denis, Felix Vallotton
and Pierre Bonnard. Artistically, the Nabis were opposed to
the impressionists' efforts to provide an objective depiction
of the visual world. They aimed instead at an art of
evocation, attempting, as the poet Stephane Mallarme famously
put it, to paint not the object but the effect that it
produces.</p>
<p>The word Nabi is Hebrew for prophet. Some of the Nabis
displayed a marked fondness for quasi-mystical esoterica,
affecting outlandish dress, occult theories, and pretentious
jargon. Vuillard was conspicuously not of their number. As
the critic John Russell noted in his excellent 1971 catalog
essay on the artist, he was "one of the least cranky men who
ever lived." "There was nothing wayward or bohemian about
Vuillard, then or later," Mr. Russell wrote; "he had a great
gift for steadfast application," and his real subject "was
the human comedy as it is lived out in Paris."</p>
<p>Vuillard's professional acquaintance with the human comedy
began with the Parisian theater, for which he designed
programs and painted set decorations. It was while working
for the theater that Vuillard developed his technique of
"peinture a la colle," painting with heated glue into which
pigment had been mixed. Often he painted on unfinished
cardboard. The process helped him achieve the lush surface
and warm colors he loved, but it also proved to be a great
danger for collectors. Attempting to brighten up his
paintings, they not infrequently had them varnished. If the
cardboard had been completely covered with paint, the varnish
did no harm; but if there were any areas exposed, the varnish
would soak into the cardboard, leaving dark brown spots that
disfigured the painting forever.</p>
<p>The current exhibition, as its title suggests, deals with
the private side of Vuillard's art. It begins with a half
dozen early self-portraits, which range from curious trials
in which we sense Vuillard searching for an artistic identity
to the marvelously penetrating oil sketch of 1891.</p>
<p>It is in his domestic scenes, however, that Vuillard
really comes into his own. Portraits of his mother and
sister, depictions of seamstresses at work in his mother's
shop (she had embarked on a career as a corset maker in the
late 1870s), and scenes of luncheons and conversations at the
houses of friends are among his most familiar and deeply felt
works. As this exhibition reminds us, Vuillard was primarily
a painter of silences and atmospheres. Even when painting
people in conversation, he seems to concentrate on the
moments between words, the pauses in which emotions flicker
and shift, in which new thoughts are born.</p>
<p>The "intimate interiors" on view here also mirror an
intimacy and unbridgeable reserve in the artist. For though
Vuillard was by all accounts affable and even gregarious, he
was an intensely private man. The recent publication of his
journals does little to diminish his remoteness. He never
married, and lived with his mother -- whom he referred to as
his "muse" and who is the subject of some of his best
paintings -- until her death in 1928.</p>
<p>Vuillard also served other muses. Misia Natanson, at that
time the wife of Thadee Natanson, the founding editor of the
influential literary and arts journal the Revue Blanche,
doubtless was Madame Vuillard's chief rival. One section of
the exhibition, titled "Homage to Misia," contains several
paintings of Misia, Thadee, and their circle, including two
of the exhibition's most beautiful paintings: "Woman in a
Striped Dress" (1895) and "Interior with Three Lamps" (1898).</p>
<p>Vuillard, if not in love with Misia, certainly was
enchanted. But then the capacity to enchant men seems to have
been prominent among that extraordinary woman's gifts. An
accomplished pianist, she had been a student of Gabriel Faure
and had won high praise from Liszt, who predicted a brilliant
career for her. She was mistress of a brilliant salon.
Mallarme wrote a poem about her. Renoir, Toulouse-Lautrec,
Bonnard and Vuillard all painted her portrait. In Vuillard's
pictures, she emerges as a strong but somewhat melancholy
character, distracted and self-absorbed.</p>
<p>It is difficult to imagine a more hospitable place to see
Vuillard's portraits of her or his other works than the
Phillips Collection. The paintings are thoughtfully
installed, and their intimacy and small scale is perfectly
served by the domestic setting of Duncan Phillips's old
townhouse. The Brooklyn Museum, to which the show travels in
May, will compensate for its more institutional galleries by
offering an expanded version of the exhibition, including two
additional paintings and many works on paper.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>"The Intimate Interiors of Edouard Vuillard" will be on
view at the Phillips Collection until April 29. It opens at
the The Brooklyn Museum on May 17 and will be on view there
until July 30. The exhibition is accompanied by a
disappointing catalog of the same title written by Elizabeth
Easton (The Museum of Fine Arts, Houston, 144 pages, $24.95).</p>
