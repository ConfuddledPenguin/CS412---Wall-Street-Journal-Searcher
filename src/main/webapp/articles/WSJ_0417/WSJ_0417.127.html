	<p class="article-leader">Propelled by brisk sales of its electronic spreadsheet
program, Borland International Inc. said it posted record
profit and revenue for its fourth quarter ended March 31. The
Scotts Valley, Calif., software maker said net income more
than doubled to $4.2 million, or 29 cents a share, on revenue
of $34.8 million. In the year-earlier quarter, Borland had a
profit of $2 million, or 17 cents a share, on revenue of
$25.9 million.
   In the year, Borland said net grew to $11.8 million, or 90
cents a share, compared with a loss of $2.8 million, or 24
cents a share. Revenue rose 25% to $113.3 million from $90.5
million.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Borland attributed the improvement largely to heavy sales
of its Quattro Pro electronic spreadsheet program, which it
began shipping during its third quarter. The company also
said results were aided by continued strong demand for the
latest version of its Paradox database program, which it
introduced a year ago.</p>
