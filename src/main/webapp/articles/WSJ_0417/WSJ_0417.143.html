	<p class="article-leader">A sagging bond market choked off a powerful blue-chip
rally by stocks.
   The Dow Jones Industrial Average still managed to gain
11.26 points to 2763.06. But that was substantially off the
more than 30-point gain the average achieved at midday after
a strong first-quarter earnings report by International
Business Machines energized trading. And broader market
averages were up only fractionally.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Long-term Treasury bonds fell about 3/8 point, or around
$3.75 for each $1,000 of face amount, on reports of heavy
Japanese selling. The dollar rose against most foreign
currencies, although trading was curtailed in Europe for the
continuation of the Easter holiday.</p>
<p>Analysts said IBM's report that it earned $1.81 a share in
the first quarter, up from $1.61 a year earlier, was even
better than optimistic analysts had predicted. Some analysts
had boosted their estimates for the computer concern's first
quarter to $1.71 a share last week, contributing heavily to
last Thursday's 22-point rally in the Dow industrials.</p>
<p>Although IBM retreated slightly from its high for the day,
the stock closed at 110 7/8, up 3 3/4, on 4.1 million shares.
Laszlo Birinyi, a market strategist, said that of the $381
million in money that flowed into the stock market yesterday,
$105 million of it was in IBM. He said that coupled with
previous positive earnings surprises is making investors more
confident that overall first-quarter profits won't be the
debacle that many had expected.</p>
<p>But A.C. Moore, director of research at Argus Research,
said he wasn't surprised that the blue-chip rally faded along
with the bond market. "While IBM was important for the day,
it's not going to prop up the entire market. Overall, the
stock market is dependent on the health of the bond market."
He said the economy remains stagnant, inflation is persisting
and interest rates are too high for stocks to maintain
current prices or go much higher.</p>
<p>In major market action:</p>
<p>Stock prices rose in moderate trading. Volume on the New
York Stock Exchange totaled 142.8 million shares.</p>
<p>Bond prices sank. The yield on the Treasury's benchmark
30-year issue climbed to 8.63%.</p>
<p>The dollar gained. In late New York trading, the currency
was quoted at 1.6775 marks and 159.30 yen, vs. 1.6724 marks
and 158.18 yen late Thursday.</p>
