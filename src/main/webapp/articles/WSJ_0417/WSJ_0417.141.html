	<p class="article-leader">Boise Cascade Corp. said first-quarter net income plunged
57%, largely as a result of depressed prices for its paper
products line.
   The Boise, Idaho, forest products concern posted profit of
$33.6 million, or 79 cents a share, compared with $78.3
million, or $1.74 a share, in the year-earlier quarter.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Revenue declined 3% to $1.07 billion from $1.1 billion.
The fall in both profit and revenue resulted from an 11% drop
in sales from the company's paper and paper products
division, which makes up about half of Boise Cascade's
revenue. The division posted sales of $572.4 million, down
from $643 million; the company blamed sluggish demand and
lower prices for most paper grades, as well as increased
manufacturing costs.</p>
<p>In the latest quarter, the company had an average of 38.1
million shares outstanding, down from 45 million. The company
said the decline reflects a stock buy-back plan.</p>
