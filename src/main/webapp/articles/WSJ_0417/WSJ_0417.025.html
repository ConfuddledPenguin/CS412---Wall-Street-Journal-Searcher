	<p class="article-leader">LEOLA, Pa. -- High on a shiny pole at the crest of Snake
Hill Road, a huge American flag snaps defiantly in the wind.
   The flag and the pole look out of place here. They anchor
the corner of a 70-acre cornfield in a fertile valley that
has been farmed by Old Order Amish and Mennonite families for
more than 250 years. The field's new owner wants to rip open
the ground with explosives and create a quarry. Stone from
the quarry would be used to make asphalt for paving and
concrete block for construction.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Some local people think the quarry is a bad idea. To
protest, a few of them stuck a green flag in the ground
across the road from the corn field. "For all we knew, their
flag could have been a Communist flag," says Donald Brubaker,
treasurer of the quarry company. "These days, everybody is an
opponent of everything."</p>
<p>In reaction, the company erected the 30-foot pole and
unfurled the big Stars and Stripes, as if to proclaim, "This
is America and we can do whatever we want."</p>
<p>Mr. Brubaker vows to keep the flag flying. "All we want to
do is stay in business," he says. "Besides, we're only
talking about a very minute parcel of land."</p>
<p>Size notwithstanding, the parcel has become strategic and
symbolic in an escalating battle. Throughout Lancaster
County, the conflict pits developers determined to expand the
economy against Pennsylvania Dutch farm families and
preservationists anxious to slow the pace of growth and
protect crop land.</p>
<p>It is easy to understand why people get so worked up over
the future of this valley. In early spring, the landscape is
a broad, gently undulating quilt of hazels, dark browns and
pale yellows, dotted with white barns and silver silos. Soon
it will bloom with alfalfa, corn, wheat and peaches.</p>
<p>The soil itself is fluffy and porous. It requires no
irrigation. Geologists and soil scientists describe it as a
rare blend of silt loam on limestone, accumulated over
hundreds of millions of years and managed devoutly in small
plots for nearly three centuries. Acre for acre, it is the
most productive farm land east of the Mississippi and among
the richest in the nation.</p>
<p>"The soil here is too good to hide under a basement," says
Gene Garber, who raises corn and wheat near Elizabethtown.
Adds his father, Henry: "We think good farm land is worth
more than dollars."</p>
<p>To families like the Garbers, these farms aren't just
nutrition factories. They are also what author Wendell Berry
calls "human organisms," part of a pattern of hopes and
values built up over many lifespans. Possession of the land
isn't the point; stewardship is.</p>
<p>For centuries, the people born on these farms have
sustained the land's fertility. Their neatly plowed fields
have a look of balance and proportion. They are the right
size. They are correct.</p>
<p>To the preservationists, they are also worth protecting.
Youngest and spunkiest of the preservation groups is the
Lancaster Farmland Trust, a not-for-profit organization with
a tiny staff and a shoestring budget. Since January 1989, the
trust has shielded 10 farms comprising some 1,288 acres in
the county through the use of deed covenants. The covenants,
granted to the trust by the farms' owners, restrict the use
of the land to agriculture forever.</p>
<p>Lately, the preservationists are using more sophisticated
tactics. They are challenging developers at public hearings,
recruiting donors and members systematically, lobbying for
more extensive agricultural zoning and lining up allies to
capture seats on township boards and local planning
commissions.</p>
<p>Gene Garber, for example, recently won election as a
township supervisor. So did Paul Krantz, a Mennonite who
lives on what folks around Strasburg now call "the Witness
farm." Mr. Krantz challenged an incumbent who was avidly
pro-development. Although a write-in candidate, he won by a
wide margin, with significant help from Amish residents, who
usually stay away from the polls.</p>
<p>"They're trying to infiltrate the political process,"
complains D. Martin Zimmerman, a prominent local developer.
"They want to stop growth wherever they can. Open space, open
space. That's all they can ever talk about."</p>
<p>To help with the talking, the trust has designated a
spokesman: Harrison Ford, star of "Witness," which was filmed
on one of the county's postcard-perfect farms. Says Mr. Ford,
who developed an affection for the county's farm land while
on location here, "This is too important a part of America to
lose by default."</p>
<p>But the preservationists are still losing. Developers far
outnumber them, and the county's agricultural land has been
vanishing at a sharp clip since the late 1960s.</p>
<p>Twenty years ago, more than three-fourths of the county's
600,000 acres were devoted to farming. Today, the proportion
has slipped below two-thirds. Between 1978 and 1987, the U.S.
Census Bureau says, more than 200 farms and 20,000 acres of
crop land disappeared. More recently, county farm land has
gone to development at a rate of about 7,000 acres a year.</p>
<p>Farmers keep selling to developers for many reasons. Some
grow too old to farm and have no able-bodied heirs. Many need
a cushion for health expenses in retirement. Others can't
resist the idea of getting $7,000 to $11,000 an acre for land
that originally cost them little or nothing.</p>
<p>Glenn Wissler of Ephrata talks almost apologetically about
having converted 23 acres into a subdivision with a septic
field a few hundred yards above a creek. "The type of soil in
that field was not very good," Mr. Wissler explains. "And it
was near a small town and a pretty busy road, so we felt it
could be utilized without losing good valuable farm land."</p>
<p>Robert Lefever, 64, gave up his farm near Lititz two years
ago. Now his son is using the 90-acre tract to build about
140 houses that sell for up to $250,000 each. "It was a good
farm, and it would have stayed that way if it had not been
for the other housing developments already next to it," Mr.
Lefever says. "That's the only farm I had. It was a good
life, but at my age, you don't miss it quite as much.
Besides, there is still a lot of ground here."</p>
<p>Taking the place of these farms is a growing stream of
development. For the entire past decade, Lancaster County has
been the fastest-growing metropolitan area in the state. Half
of its 400,000 residents arrived since 1975. Commuters who
work for corporations in the exurbs of Philadelphia have
discovered the county's convenience and charm. Alfalfa fields
have become condominium projects; orchards now are shopping
centers; pastures now are amusement parks and car
dealerships. The county has two new golf courses. Five more
are proposed.</p>
<p>Dutch Wonderland Family Fun Park is here. So are the
National Wax Museum, the Toy Train Museum and the Red Caboose
Motel (where the beds are shaped like cabooses).</p>
<p>Tourism used to account for less than a fourth of the
local economy. Now it exceeds a third. About five million
visitors come annually, many to buy antiques and shoo-fly
pie, most to gawk at the Plain Sect farmers in their
horse-drawn buggies. The tourists leave behind more than $400
million a year, much of it at factory outlet stores of Van
Heusen, Izod, Reebok, Dansk, Bugle Boy and London Fog.</p>
<p>Alan Musselman believes the encroachment has gone far
enough. A big, sturdy man with a deep voice and a firm
handshake, he is executive director of the farmland trust.
These days, he spends much of his time driving the county's
back roads, calling on farmers face-to-face to enlist their
support in his cause.</p>
<p>Already on his side is Mary Schantz, a sprightly
75-year-old widow who raises chickens, pheasants and corn
near Ephrata. She lives alone in a grand old house on a
78-acre farm that was started in about 1750, and she is
determined to see the place permanently preserved. "I don't
mind how much I have to sacrifice," she tells Mr. Musselman,
"but I want to get this done before I die."</p>
<p>During one of his visits, Mr. Musselman admires a trout
stream that meanders across the lower pasture of John and
Helen Farrington's 200-acre appaloosa farm. For some time,
the Farringtons have been thinking about Mr. Musselman's idea
of granting protective covenants.</p>
<p>Mr. Farrington lets the news out casually. "We got these
papers notarized last night," he says, handing them to his
visitor. "We feel good about doing this. I'm sorry it seemed
like it drug on for an awfully long time." Mr. Musselman is
beaming. "This is wonderful," he says, staring at the
documents.</p>
<p>The conversation turns to newborn colts and horse feed and
then to a neighboring developer seeking rights to build a
golf course and hundreds of condos on the hillside above the
trout stream.</p>
<p>"I am against it," Mr. Farrington says. "Is there any way
to buy that land and then break it up into three or four
farms that the Amish could own?"</p>
<p>"We have enough for a down payment in our fund," Mr.
Musselman says, "but we don't have enough to buy it. Maybe we
could get a loan."</p>
<p>"That's just a thought," says Mr. Farrington.</p>
<p>"That's a good one," says Mr. Musselman. "We'll work on
it."</p>
<p>The trust's successes with properties like the Farrington
farm are beginning to supplement those of the county's
Agricultural Preserve Board, a state-subsidized agency that
already holds similar covenants on 67 farms. This year, the
state has allocated about $4 million to the board to help
purchase more covenants.</p>
<p>These covenants can be worth hundreds or thousands of
dollars an acre. The price of the covenant, determined by
appraisal, is the difference between the land's current value
as a farm and its fair market value. Since the owner is
giving up the right to sell to a developer (thus forfeiting
his windfall profit), he gets this payment as compensation.
If he chooses to receive only part of the amount, the rest
can be claimed as an income-tax deduction.</p>
<p>As another option, farmers may decide to take payment in
the form of "forgiveness" of several years of future property
taxes. Some farmers refuse to accept any payments or tax
advantages. They believe that donating covenants should be
done for ethical reasons, not for financial gain.</p>
<p>In contrast to the resources of the county preserve board,
the private farmland trust has only about $80,000 in
operating funds, enough to keep going for about six more
months. "We're getting $15 contributions," says the trust's
Mr. Musselman, "but we need to compete in the bidding at
auctions on $300,000 farms."</p>
<p>A staunch ally of the private trust is the county preserve
board's chairman, Amos H. Funk, 78, a fruit and vegetable
farmer. He has been sounding the alarm about what he calls
"real estate erosion" in the county since the late 1960s.</p>
<p>Mr. Funk favors a growth-management approach that would
allow dense-development clusters, like European villages, in
many parts of the county, while preserving about 250,000
acres of prime crop land. He advocates protecting about 200
farms at pressure points along the perimeter of agricultural
"security zones." Locking up strategic parcels on the fringe,
he reasons, would insulate the land in the center.</p>
<p>His stance draws heavy criticism from developers. "I have
been called a Communist," Mr. Funk says. "But as long as I am
doing what I feel in my heart is right, I don't mind."</p>
<p>Elaine Holden, a new member on the county planning
commission, worries about the heightened tension in the
community. "Divided we fall," she warns. "The growth
pressures are becoming so great here that we need to work
together. I alternate between being excited and being
discouraged. There are some days when I say to myself, `Oh,
Lord, we may never be able to turn this thing around.'"</p>
<p>The turnaround probably can't be accomplished without
greater cooperation from the Plain Sect farmers. They own
about 20% of the county's crop land, and much of it is smack
in the path of development. But that cooperation has been
difficult to win.</p>
<p>"The Amish and the plain Mennonites won't work with my
program," acknowledges Thomas Daniels, director of the
preserve board. "They won't take my money because it's
government money."</p>
<p>The trust, unlike the preserve board, is a private
operation. But so far, the trust hasn't made much headway
with the plain people, either. The only Old Order farmer in
the county who has granted a covenant to the trust offers Mr.
Musselman some insight: "For our people," the gray-bearded
farmer tells him, "it's going to be a little bit slow. We
aren't willing to take any handouts or any welfare."</p>
<p>Mr. Musselman is frustrated because the man misses the
point. "To many of them, land conservation is a government
issue, so it carries negative connotations," he says. "But
I'm convinced that a hard sell is the wrong way to go. We
have to be patient, let the idea become well known. It may
take years. Their church leaders aren't quick to accept
something new, and they don't want to see this issue divide
their community."</p>
<p>At the end of a long day of visiting farms, Mr. Musselman
and Mr. Krantz are invited into the home of one of Mr.
Krantz's Amish neighbors. They sit on metal folding chairs
and talk at length about the trust and how covenants work. It
is clear that the Amishman is skeptical.</p>
<p>Hoping to keep the idea germinating, Mr. Musselman asks
gently if the farmer thinks it might be a good idea to have a
meeting with a few more Amish families to talk about
covenants some more.</p>
<p>"I don't know," says the farmer. But he turns toward his
neighbor, the preservationist Mr. Krantz, and asks, "Paul,
what do you think?"</p>
