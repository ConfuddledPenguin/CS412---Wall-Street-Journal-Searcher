	<div class="article-body"><p>British army counterterrorism experts are helping to train
Philippine President Corazon Aquino's palace guard to protect
her against a possible fresh coup attempt.</p>
<p>Mrs. Aquino told a press conference the small team of
British military personnel has been brought in to train the
Presidential Security Group, an elite force of 3,000 men that
guards her.</p>
<p>The president, who has survived six coup attempts in the
past four years, said the training was being provided free as
part of British assistance to the Philippines. She rejected
as untrue allegations that British mercenaries were involved.</p>
<p>The British Embassy, while confirming the presence of a
team of army trainers, declined to specify their exact role
or how many there were. But Philippine military sources said
the team was made up of about a dozen experts in
anti-terrorism techniques, and that they arrived late last
month. Anti-Aquino army rebels threaten to attack the British
officers if they aren't withdrawn.</p>
<p>JAPANESE ACQUISITIONS ABROAD</p>
<p>Japanese firms purchased 448 foreign companies in the
fiscal year ended March 31, up from 334 in fiscal 1988,
according to a survey by Yamaichi Securities Co. Foreign
firms acquired only 14 Japanese companies in fiscal 1989,
Yamaichi reported.</p>
<p>MEXICAN TRADE</p>
<p>Mexico's new open door trade policy forced 50,000 small
and medium-size businesses to turn to exporting or shut down
in 1989, according to a study by Mexico City's Metropolitan
University. The industries most affected are clothing,
footwear, plastics, electronics, toys, foods and beverages,
the study says. Last year, President Carlos Salinas de
Gortari's government approved new foreign trade rules
lowering duties and lifting restrictions on imports, with the
aim of making Mexican companies more competitive at home and
abroad.</p>
<p>FORTRESS EUROPE?</p>
<p>The U.S. International Trade Commission says U.S. business
still worries that greater unity among West Europeans will
lead to a "Fortress Europe" designed to protect their
companies against U.S. goods and services. American interests
that could be hurt, according to the ITC, range from the sale
of insurance to the showing of U.S. television shows.</p>
<p>JAPANESE TANKER ORDER</p>
<p>Hitachi Zosen Corp., a leading Japanese shipbuilding firm,
received an order for a crude-oil tanker valued at
approximately $82.3 million. According to the Japan Ship
Exporters Association, that's the highest price paid for a
Japanese tanker since 1973, when the world shipbuilding
industry contracted because of soaring oil prices. Hitachi
said it will build the 280,000-grossmetric-ton oil carrier
for Britain-based Lykiardopuro & Co., and deliver the ship in
early 1993.</p>
<p>CRIME IN POLAND</p>
<p>Crime is soaring in post-Communist Poland at a time when
police are short of manpower, money and public trust.</p>
<p>The number of crimes jumped 80% in 1989, to more than
500,000. Nearly a third were property crimes, traceable in
part to the worsening economic situation.</p>
<p>Muggings increased by 26%. The number of reported rapes
rose, while murders remained steady at about 500 a year.</p>
<p>But the police force is shrinking as crime grows. Col.
Wojciech Garstka, spokesman for the Interior Ministry, says
Warsaw alone has 3,200 vacancies. Low pay and public distrust
account for the failure to attract new recruits, despite the
surge in unemployment accompanying economic reform, says Col.
Garstka.</p>
<p>POSTSCRIPTS . . .</p>
<p>Forget the yen, mark and franc. Buy dong. Thanks to a
tough package of economic reforms, the Vietnamese currency
has soared in the past year, strengthening by 50% against the
dollar. . . . Brazil won't build a nuclear bomb, says Jose
Luiz de Carvalho Santana, the new head of that country's
Nuclear Energy Commission. According to U.S. scientists,
Brazil's secret uranium-enrichment plant at Aramar, in Sao
Paulo state, could easily be adapted to make a bomb.</p>
