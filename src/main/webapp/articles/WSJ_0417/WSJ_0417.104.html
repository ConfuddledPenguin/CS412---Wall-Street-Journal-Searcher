	<p class="article-leader">Danny Ortega held a news conference yesterday to sound the
clear message that in Nicaragua it ain't over 'til it's over.
He said that the April 25 inauguration day for
President-elect Violeta Chamorro was by no means a certain
date.
   The voters may have spoken in February, but Mr. Ortega may
not have been listening. No hand-over of power from the
Sandinistas will occur, he said, until the Contras are
totally disarmed. "We are analyzing this situation in order
to find an adequate response to this so critical, so
difficult and so grave situation in Nicaragua," Mr. Ortega
said.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>These threats from Mr. Ortega may have only been his way
of jockeying before negotiations begin this week in Managua
with the Contras. It is also possible, however, that they
could signify something rather more ominous. "We are very
close to peace and very close to war," Mr. Ortega said. In
other words, there is still very good reason that the Contras
are armed.</p>
