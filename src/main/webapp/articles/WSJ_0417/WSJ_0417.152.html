	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Bank of New York Co. escalated its war of
nerves with Northeast Bancorp over the terms of their pending
$400 million merger agreement.
   On one hand, Bank of New York asked the Federal Reserve
Board for permission to buy Northeast Bancorp as part of a
seven-year-old agreement, now that Connecticut has removed
the last legal impediment to the transaction.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>However, at the same time, Bank of New York raised
questions whether the transaction will be completed on the
existing terms. In the filing, the Bank of New York estimated
Shelton, Conn.-based Northeast's book value at $12.31 a
share, compared with Northeast's year-end estimate of $33 a
share.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Bank of New York said in its filing that it
had advised Northeast that it should "seek other bidders."
Earlier this year, Bank of New York said that it would fire
700 Northeast employees if the merger as presently structured
were completed.</p>
<p>Northeast, the parent of Connecticut's third-largest
commercial bank, has said that it will seek to enforce its
merger agreement.</p>
<p>Bank of New York has agreed to pay 250% of Northeast's
book value, provided Northeast's nonperforming assets are no
more than 150% of its peer group of banks. Furthermore, Bank
of New York can cancel the agreement if regulators impose
conditions that would be onerous to Bank of New York
shareholders.</p>
<p>For the first quarter, Northeast posted a $6.5 million
loss, compared to earnings of $8 million a year ago, as loan
quality worsened. A Bank of New York spokesman said that he
didn't know whether Northeast's nonperforming loans now
exceeded 150% of its peer banks' levels.</p>
