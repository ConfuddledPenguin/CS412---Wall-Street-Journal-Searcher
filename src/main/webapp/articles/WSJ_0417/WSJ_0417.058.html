	<p class="article-leader">Naples, Italy -- They call it the Villa of the Chaste
Lovers because, in Pompeii, couples depicted in wall
paintings usually are engaged in more compromising activities
than the exchange of a kiss. Behind a corrugated-iron
partition, locked to keep out the curious, lies the villa,
the only building currently under excavation.
   The rooms of the large three-floor Roman house still are
filled halfway up with crumbling gray ash. On the ground lies
a rusty nail at least 1,900 years old. In what was once a
bedroom, tiny rabbits and birds are delicately painted on the
black and red backgrounds. In the center of each wall, in a
one-square-yard space, the lovers are reclining on their
beds, kissing. Their privacy has not been violated since
these frescoes were buried in 79 A.D. by lava and ash spewing
from Mount Vesuvius all over the towns and villages around
Naples.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>On that blazingly hot dawn in August, what sounded like a
clap of thunder filled the air and the sky seemed to shake.
Mount Vesuvius appeared to split open, and a hail of burning
stones pelted down, followed by ash that filled the eyes,
mouths and lungs of the terrified inhabitants. Within three
hours, the small trading town was completely buried under hot
ash. Very few people escaped, out of a population estimated
at 20,000. Still today, one quarter of the 27-acre site is
buried and may remain so for many years. This is not so much
a pity as a saving grace. As long as the houses stay
blanketed in ash, they are safe from the combined damage
caused by weather, weeds, wanderers and vandals.</p>
<p>"Pompeii is dying," says Baldassare Conticello, the
Palermo-born archaeologist who has directed operations at the
site for the past five years. "I'm engaged in a battle of
wits against time and the various Italian ministries."</p>
<p>Time is the more insidious foe. When the tougher surface
of the wall paintings starts to thin out, the brick-based
pigment blows away like dust.</p>
<p>As for the state, Mr. Conticello says between cigar puffs,
he spends his days trying to extract money from it: "The
Ministry of Cultural Heritage only gets 0.19% of the
country's total annual budget and, out of those two billion
lira a year {$1.6 million}, Pompeii gets only a fraction."
Mr. Conticello estimates that, ideally, Pompeii would need at
least 500 billion lira {$406 million} to save it from
disaster. He may be far from that goal, but he hasn't lost
the fight, he says. "I wouldn't be here if I thought that.
I'm 57 years old and I'm not going to call myself a loser
yet."</p>
<p>Mr. Conticello lives with his wife and small daughter in
an apartment on the edge of the site, working a 12-hour day
to keep the city alive. He doesn't like Naples, and would
rather live in Rome, but he plans to stay. He recently
managed to get a 35 billion lira {$28.4 million} sum out of
the government, and with it, he intends to restore the
buildings, pavements and streets from the Amphitheatre at the
east of the town to the Forum at the west.</p>
<p>As the most recent in a dynasty of archaeologists
inaugurated in 1748 by an abbot from Naples who began digging
near the Temple of Fortune, Mr. Conticello wants to use the
latest scientific methods to restore the site and present the
clearest possible picture of the thriving port city as it
stood. "Most of my colleagues dream of the past in terms of
romantic ruins. I'm much more pragmatic. I like jet planes
and modern architecture. I want to rebuild the houses just
enough to save them, but no more than that. Every time you
work on an ancient site you damage it, and the gamble is to
work out how much you can damage in order to restore."</p>
<p>With assistance from IBM and Fiat, and a subsidy from the
Ministry of Labor, Mr. Conticello has been making a
computerized graphic database of Pompeii over the past two
years. First 160,000 square feet of paintings were digitized.
Then, the 105 archaeologists working on the project, and
various computer experts, cartographers and architects,
turned their attention to the 8,800 papyrus scrolls
discovered in Pompeii, now in the Natural History Library of
Naples. After photography, the gray-on-black lettering was
tinted purple and magnified to make it easier to read.</p>
<p>Such computer models enable restorers to experiment
without fear of damaging the real work. On the site, however,
the workers as often as possible use stone and mortar, wood
and terra-cotta tiles, just as the ancient Romans did.
Earlier restoration techniques using reinforced concrete to
bolster walls and cement to restore paintings were "far too
brutal." The most urgent task, Mr. Conticello believes, is
roofing. "You can't understand architecture if the roofs
aren't there." In the areas near the Amphitheatre and in
Porta Marina near the Forum the roofs are painstakingly being
rebuilt with wooden beams and, whenever possible, the
original tiles.</p>
<p>The sidewalks and streets have been worn down by the feet
of the two million tourists who tramp through Pompeii every
year. Using another ancient method, Mr. Conticello and his
team are rebuilding the sidewalks with "ciccio pisto", a
mixture of crushed terra cotta, mortar and volcanic stone.
"It acts as a sealant, protecting the houses from the
humidity that seeps up from the ground."</p>
<p>Pompeii, as Mr. Conticello sees it, is not to be a
melancholy vision of ruins by Piranesi. He wants the Roman
houses to give visitors some impression of the community that
once lived here and to re-create the former border lines
between houses and gardens. With a botanist who is studying
the pollen and seeds as they were when trapped under the ash
on the day of the eruption, he can re-create the gardens
exactly as they were 19 centuries ago. They already have
replanted several gardens with vineyards and beds of violets
and roses.</p>
<p>Mr. Conticello, who thinks of himself as an
archaeologist-cum-manager, has sworn that all the money gets
from the Italian state will go into restoration. But he would
love to start new digs in Pompeii or Herculaneum, the other
site nearby that was buried under lava, not ash. It covered
most of the ancient town under what is now many feet of hard
rock.</p>
<p>Mr. Conticello is eager to create an international
foundation of businesspeople that would raise the money to
carry out the digs. "A single villa could yield more than 100
statues," he says. "Just imagine the prestige. We could build
a museum, something like the Peggy Guggenheim Foundation in
Venice."</p>
<p>Nowadays, when the night starts to fall, a wailing siren
warns visitors that it's time to leave Pompeii. They don't
need to be urged, says one of the 200 guards who patrols the
grounds. "For those who don't know it, Pompeii is scary at
night. They're afraid of ghosts."</p>
<p>But the living still are very much the masters of Pompeii.
Two men from the small modern village of Pompeii just beyond
the walls amble in and out of the ruins, cutting tender,
edible dandelion leaves with their pen knives, stuffing them
into plastic bags, and singing a Neapolitan love song at the
top of their lungs.</p>
