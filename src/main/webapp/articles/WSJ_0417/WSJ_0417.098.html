	<p class="article-leader">Nikko Securities Co. of Japan plans to introduce a new
type of investment trust fund that includes investment in
U.S. commodity futures markets, a company official said.
   Nikko expects to collect $100 million to $200 million for
the new fund at the end of June through private offerings to
institutions, the official said.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Operation of a commodity fund isn't allowed under Japan's
Ministry of Finance regulations, which limit investment trust
funds' portfolios to securities such as stocks and bonds. The
Nikko official said the firm has received unofficial ministry
approval for the new fund and expects official approval in
May.</p>
<p>About 50% of the total amount of the fund will be invested
in zero-coupon bonds to guarantee its principal. The rest
will be invested in the U.S. futures markets for agricultural
products, energy and precious metals.</p>
