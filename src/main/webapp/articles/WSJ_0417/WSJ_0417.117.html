	<p class="article-leader">National Business Systems Inc. said shareholders approved
a recapitalization plan that includes changing the Toronto
company's name to Consolidated NBS Inc.
   The plan also calls for consolidating the outstanding
common shares on a 1-for-10 basis and creating three new
classes of preferred shares. It didn't give the value of the
new preferred issues.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>At last report, National Business had about 16 million
shares outstanding.</p>
<p>The company said its noteholders will exchange 20 million
Canadian dollars ($17.2 million) of senior subordinated notes
for an equivalent amount of debentures convertible into Class
AAA cumulative participating preferred shares.</p>
<p>The company also plans a rights offering which would allow
shareholders to purchase an additional C$20 million of the
convertible debentures.</p>
<p>Hees International Bancorp Inc., which was retained in
1987 to manage and turn around the troubled credit-card
accessory manufacturing concern, said it will take any
convertible debentures not subscribed for under the offering.</p>
