	<p class="article-leader">If a supertanker moved as slowly as the litigation that
follows after a large oil spill, very little oil would be
spilled in the world. The Amoco Cadiz spill on the Brittany
coast occurred during a violent storm in mid-March of 1978.
The trial on damages began in 1986, the first court decision
came 10 years after the spill in 1988, and a modified
decision is now on appeal. Of course if tankers moved this
slowly, the cost of oil would triple.
   The first lesson of any catastrophe such as a major oil
spill is that one is never fully prepared for it. Early
attempts to cope with it will be characterized by confusion,
conflicts over authority, and outright blunders. That was
true of the Cadiz and the Exxon Valdez and will be at least
partially true in the next great spill.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>I am reminded of an odd letter I once received from the
late Tjalling Koopmans, a great Yale economist, in which he
asked me if I believed that we should use the price system to
evacuate Manhattan if it were bombed. What he was asking was
whether the transport system afforded by the normal economy
-- buses, taxis, and so on -- would be equipped to handle
such catastrophe. I replied that any method of evacuation
would be hopelessly inefficient during the first bombing. As
a true Chicago economist, I added that the price system would
do a fine job of evacuation if the bombings became routine.</p>
<p>The Cadiz had the largest vessel spill in history: 11
million gallons of oil were released when the ship was blown
up by the French navy on the rocks of Brittany. That is six
times the amount of oil spilled by the Valdez in Prince
William Sound. The Cadiz spill, to which I will limit myself,
teaches some important economic lessons. (I was an economic
witness for Amoco in the Cadiz trial in Chicago, and am a
consultant to Exxon on the Valdez spill.)</p>
<p>The variety and magnitude of the claims that arise from a
spill are astounding -- it was almost an oversight, I felt,
that the repainting of the Eiffel Tower was not included in
the French claims. But this cannot be news to the most
litigious nation on earth.</p>
<p>To measure damages with tolerable accuracy we need much
information, and it is seldom available. To measure the loss
of tourism in Brittany in 1978 the French experts used the
amount of flour delivered to the affected areas -- exactly
the way population was estimated in England in 1780] The
early English experts, each using a different commodity to
estimate population, could not agree on whether the
population was rising or falling. Similarly, depending upon
whether one treated flour consumption in April and May of
1978 as normal or abnormal, the decline in tourism was 2.4
million -- or 12.5 million -- nights worth of tourist stays
lost.</p>
<p>In fact, the amount of information needed in a major spill
is truly stupendous. Judge Frank McGarr's decision has
thousands of sentences with about the amount of hard
information present in this instance for a single commune:</p>
<p>"Henvic's miscellaneous claim for the purchase of clothing
and cleanup products is contradicted by the commune's earlier
statements that they did not incur such expenses. It seems
logical to the court, however, that the cleanup actually
would have required some such expenditures."</p>
<p>The judge awarded 1,000 French francs for this purpose. Of
the commune's total request for 475,161 francs, our Solomon
awarded 12,188 francs or 2.5% of the overweight baby, to
Henvic.</p>
<p>Even when the damages are more easily measured, they raise
questions. A hotel, for example, has measured decline in
patronage (putting aside possible effects of bad weather).
One can calculate lost revenues, deduct any savings in costs
with fewer tourists, and thus measure the loss to the hotel.
But notice: Other tourist areas in France will gain much of
the lost business. The offsetting gain is not recognized in
the courtroom.</p>
<p>In the Cadiz cleanup, the military was used extensively.
The extra cost of moving troops to Brittany was clearly a
proper charge against Amoco. Should we add their food and not
just the meager pay of French conscripts but also what they
could have earned as civilians? That was what the French
requested. I argued that these costs should be excluded: It
is a customary duty of the armed services to assist in
national catastrophes. Judge Frank McGarr disagreed and
admitted part of the French claim. I persist in my belief
that military forces have important civilian duties.</p>
<p>Another interesting question arose out of the French claim
for the value of services of many French college students who
volunteered their time in the cleanup during an academic
vacation. There was no intention of paying them -- their
names were unknown -- but it was argued that their
contribution was to France, not to Amoco. Putting aside the
dispute over whether the students were really helpful, I
argued that no payment was needed to make France whole. That
seems to me a good legal argument. One could raise a question
as to whether compensation for the students would have
significantly increased the deterrence to future accidents,
but the costs of a spill to the shipper are already
stupendous.</p>
<p>A more elusive claim can arise for the loss of pleasure to
tourists and residents from the closing and damaging of the
beaches. Economists call "consumer surplus" the amount you
would be willing to pay for something minus the amount you
actually paid. If you would be willing to spend a total of
$2,000 for a week at a resort and actually paid $1,200, you
would be obtaining $800 of consumer surplus.</p>
<p>The French made large claims on behalf of the communes for
lost consumer surplus in 1978 for both residents and tourists
(even those from Belgium and Germany). Judge McGarr ruled
that the communes' claims were not sustainable under French
law. Such claims by tourists and residents will most probably
play a large role in spills under American law.</p>
<p>Lost consumer surplus is called a "use" value because it
refers to some desired services actually lost which would
have been received if there had been no accident. Use-value
can be measured with some accuracy. The same cannot be said
of a new category of "non-use" values that has been emerging
in the economic literature on national resources.</p>
<p>An example: I tell you that the Taj Mahal will soon
collapse unless $10 million is spent upon its repair -- and
this is verified by a bishop of your own choice. These
questions arise: How much would you contribute to its repair
if you were certain you would never visit it? That is called
"existence value." How much would you contribute if you might
visit it someday? That is called "option value." Finally, how
much would you contribute for it to be preserved for future
generations? That is called "bequest value."</p>
<p>How can one possibly measure a thing so subjective as "use
value," let alone "non-use value"? There are in fact clever,
persuasive ways of dealing with use value. Suppose I find
that 2% of the people in town A go annually to a resort,
whereas 5% of those in town B (closer to the resort) visit
the resort because travel costs per family are lower by $200
than costs from A. That gives me a measure of willingness to
pay, and hence a measure of use value.</p>
<p>For non-use value I must resort to hypothetical questions
such as those in my Taj Mahal example. Because the possible
visitor does not actually pay the value he sets on non-use
value, it costs him nothing to set a high value on his
estimate. But his liberality is not so cheap for the
defendant.</p>
<p>Large sums will be paid to the lawyers in litigation over
a large oil spill, and the economists' services will come for
free. One might liken these beneficiaries of oil spills to
the extra business that goes to the glaziers who get to
replace the many windows broken after a hailstorm. We
economists do not believe that either the glaziers or the
lawyers and economists are really beneficiaries of such
surges in demand for their services. The surges (and the
sharp declines) in future demand are taken into account in
our decisions on which occupations to enter.</p>
<p>In any event, lawyers and economists will be well worth
their pay if they help to reach the correct social policy in
oil spills. That policy is to deter spills up to the point
where further deterrence would cost more than the further
reduction in damage. The costs of prevention of spills and
payments for the damage they cause will be paid, not by oil
companies -- they are merely collection agencies -- but by
the consumers of oil products. We cannot eliminate all spills
without eliminating oil from our lives. I for one do not wish
to walk to work.</p>
