	<p class="article-leader">SUNNYVALE, Calif. -- ZyMOS Corp. said it restated its 1988
and 1989 financial results to reflect a change in accounting
for a gain on the sale of equipment and technology to an
affiliate. The microchip maker said proceeds from the sale,
originally booked as a gain, were reclassified as
contributions of capital.
   For the full year ended Dec. 31 1989, ZyMOS said its net
loss was restated to $2.9 million, or nine cents a share,
from $1.9 million, or six cents a share. For 1988, the
restatement resulted in a loss of $3.2 million, or 11 cents a
share, from profit of $189,000, or one cent a share. Net
before restatement included an extraordinary gain of $5.8
million from the early retirement of debt.</p>
