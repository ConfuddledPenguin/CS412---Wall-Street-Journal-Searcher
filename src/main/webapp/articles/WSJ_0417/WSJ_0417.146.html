	<p class="article-leader">Analog Devices Inc. said it has agreed in principle to buy
closely held Precision Monolithics Inc. for $80 million in
cash plus warrants to purchase $1 million of Analog stock at
$12 a share. The purchase is subject to regulatory approval
and the approval of an agreement by the board and Precision's
owners.
   Precision, Santa Clara, Calif., makes linear and
mixed-signal integrated circuits and had 1989 sales of $88
million.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>In a statement, Analog, a maker of electronic parts based
in Norwood, Mass., said it decided to disclose discussions
with Precision so that it could resume the buy-back of Analog
stock on the open market pursuant to its previously
authorized stock buy-back program. Analog's president, Ray
Stata, said that "given the recent decline in the market
price of Analog's stock, we believe it is in the best
interests of Analog and its shareholders to resume the
repurchase program at prices we consider to be attractive."</p>
<p>Analog stock rose 12.5 cents yesterday to close at $7.375
a share in New York Stock Exchange composite trading.</p>
