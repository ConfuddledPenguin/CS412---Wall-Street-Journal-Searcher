Inc. agreed to jointly develop, make and distribute generic
drugs for hospitals and other health-care institutions.
   Ciba-Geigy, the Basel, Switzerland-based pharmaceuticals

10% equity interest in Marsam, which has about 5.6 million
shares outstanding, including 600,000 subject to warrants.
The transaction is subject to the companies' executing a
definitive agreement.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>On the news, Marsam's shares rose $1.50, to close at
$20.50 in national over-the-counter trading yesterday.</p>
<p>Under terms of the 10-year accord, Marsam, Cherry Hill,
N.J., will produce generic injectable drugs; Ciba-Geigy's

Corp., Bristol-Myers brought with it certain products that
put it in competition with Marsam.</p>
