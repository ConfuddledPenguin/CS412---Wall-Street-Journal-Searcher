	<p class="article-leader">Analysts' estimates of a 13% to 18% increase in Imasco
Ltd.'s net income this year are "in the ballpark," said Purdy
Crawford, chairman, president and chief executive.
   The estimates of 1990 per-share net range from 3.25 to
3.40 Canadian dollars (US$2.79-$2.92). In 1989, Imasco
reported net income of C$366.1 million, or C$2.87 a share, on
net revenue of C$4.24 billion. Net revenue excludes sales and
excise taxes collected.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"We expect a good year," Mr. Crawford said in an
interview. "We think there will be growth at each unit." The
Montreal tobacco, financial services, fast food and retailing
concern is 40.4%-owned by Britain's B.A.T Industries PLC.</p>
<p>Earnings at Imasco's Imperial Tobacco unit will grow in
each of the next five years even as cigarette consumption in
Canada continues to decline, Mr. Crawford said. Imasco
expects its U.S. fast-food unit, Hardee's, to post "modest
market-share growth" this year. In 1989, Hardee's had a 9.9%
share of customer traffic in the sandwich category of the
fast-food market.</p>
