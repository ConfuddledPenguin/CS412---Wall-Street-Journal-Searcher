	<p class="article-leader">This year is shaping up as a dangerous time for magazine
publishers.
   Ad pages at many major magazines dropped significantly in
the first quarter, and many industry executives expect a
shakeout in coming months. Underscoring the problem,
publisher Leonard Stern yesterday said he is folding 7 Days,
the weekly magazine he started two years ago for upscale New
Yorkers. According to Magazine Publishers of America,
first-quarter ad pages dropped an average 3.5%.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Significantly, however, many of the magazines that account
for the bulk of ad spending posted much worse declines. And
the plague of falling pages is remarkable for its democratic
sweep.</p>
<p>Not only were red flags raised at magazines that have been
struggling, such as Family Media's Savvy Woman, down 24.3% in
ad pages for the quarter, and Metrocorp's Manhattan, Inc.,
down 17%, but also at perennial powerhouses such as Time
Warner's People, down 18.4%; McGraw-Hill's Business Week,
down 15.2%, and Diamandis Communications' Elle, down 12%.</p>
<p>Commenting on the numbers, the MPA, an industry trade
group, noted "initial softness" in automotive ads, the
largest category for magazines, and a "significant decline"
in tobacco advertising, a major contributor to revenue at
most women's magazines.</p>
<p>Peter Diamandis, chairman of the MPA and president of
Hachette S.A.'s Diamandis Communications, blamed the ad-page
decline on advertisers' reluctance to commit to media budgets
because of concerns about the economy. He also noted that the
leveraged buy-out of RJR Nabisco Inc. led the large food
products and cigarette company to slash its magazine budgets
for 1990.</p>
<p>But Mr. Diamandis added optimistically that second-quarter
spending seems to have picked up. "It's going to be a tough
year, but not as bad as the first quarter indicates," he
said.</p>
<p>Although widely praised for its editorial content, 7 Days
was losing about $5 million a year, according to industry
executives. Mr. Stern, chairman of Hartz Mountain, put the
magazine up for sale last month but was unable to interest
several prospective buyers, including American Express and
New York Times Co. Magazine Group.</p>
<p>In an interview, Mr. Stern called the closing a "tragedy"
but blamed, among other things, the increasingly severe
competition for ad dollars. The sluggish New York economy
also has been a problem for local publications. Mr. Stern
wouldn't say how much he has lost on 7 Days.</p>
<p>Despite some publishers' optimism, there is widespread
concern the downturn will last through 1990 and that a
surprising number of magazines won't make it through the
year. "The marginal, lesser capitalized magazines are going
to get washed out," says Charles Elbaum, president of
Publishing Economics, a New York media consulting company.
"There are too many speculative magazines, which dilutes
advertising so badly that it's more difficult for everyone.
To move forward, we need a shakeout."</p>
<p>In addition to 7 Days, recent casualties include
Psychology Today, which in February suspended publication
until this summer, when owner Owen Lipstein promises it will
reappear. Family Media reduced the publishing frequency of
its fashion magazines Model and Taxi to 10 times a year from
12. Then, in an innovative but last-ditch effort, Family
Media decided to cut costs by doing away with paid
circulation and simply making the magazines available free in
doctors' offices, health clubs and beauty salons.</p>
<p>In the current environment, even the largest of magazines
must assume an entrepreneurial stance. Time Warner's Sports
Illustrated, badly hurt by the auto and cigarette fallout,
recently began a new so-called advertorial section appearing
six times a year aimed at business readers. Entitled "Fast
Track," the section has humorous, off-beat features on
business, appears in about 500,000 subscriber copies and
brings in about $1 million in new advertising dollars.</p>
<p>"It's clear some magazine categories are overcrowded so
you are fighting for every dollar," said Thomas Hickey,
advertising sales director for Sports Illustrated.</p>
<p>In general, group magazine publishers like Time Warner are
in better shape these days. "Publishing magazines standing on
their own is just too expensive, especially with a slowed
down economy," said Mr. Stern, whose only other major
publishing property is the Village Voice, a weekly New York
newspaper. Mr. Stern noted that group publishers have
significant advantages because they can spread some
advertising and circulation costs over several properties.</p>
<p>Mr. Stern, who made millions from pet food and real
estate, added wearily, "magazine publishing is a tough
business."</p>

<p>Ad Notes. . . .</p>
<p>ANTI-SMOKING CAMPAIGN: Los Angeles's KABC-TV has rejected
one of the first ads in the California Department of Health
Services' new $28.6 million anti-smoking campaign, according
to Keye/Donna/Pearlstein, the ad agency that created the
campaign. The ad KABC questioned, called "Industry
Spokesman," depicts cigarette executives discussing ways to
recruit new smokers to replace those who quit or died. "They
felt the `Industry Spokesman' was inflammatory," the ad
agency said. San Francisco's KPIX-TV said it rejected the
entire campaign because the state demanded free
public-service time equal to half of the time it paid for on
the station. The ad agency, however, said it hadn't offered
the spots to KPIX.</p>
