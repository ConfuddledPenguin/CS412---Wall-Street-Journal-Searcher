	<p class="article-leader">VANCOUVER, British Columbia -- Total Energold Corp. said
it completed a private placement of about 4.4 million common
shares, and used the proceeds of $10 million to acquire 12.5%
of a partnership that invests in small resource companies.
   The previously proposed placement, to a wholly owned unit
of Total Cie. Francaise des Petroles, a Paris-based oil
concern, increased the unit's interest in Total Energold's
shares outstanding to about 69%, the company said.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Total Energold, which has interests in oil, natural gas
and gold, said it subsequently acquired 12.5% of Ventures
Trident II Limited Partnership, a professionally managed
limited partnership. Details about the partnership and its
holdings weren't disclosed, and company executives weren't
available to elaborate.</p>
<p>A field geologist with Total Energold said he believes
Ventures Trident's interests include a stake in an Alaskan
gold deposit.</p>
