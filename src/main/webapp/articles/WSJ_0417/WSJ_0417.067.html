	<p class="article-leader">Four major banks reported generally weak earnings,
reflecting varying factors, including lower borrowing levels
for corporate takeovers, mounting bad loans and the absence
of interest payments from Brazil.
   Chase Manhattan Corp., the parent of the nation's
second-largest bank, posted the biggest earnings drop
yesterday -- a decline of 67% -- chiefly because of a $75
million increase in the provision for possible credit losses
on commercial real estate loans.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>An accounting change at J.P. Morgan & Co. more than
doubled quarterly profit, masking continued anemic operating
earnings. Without the change, profit would have been off 6%.</p>
<p>At Manufacturers Hanover Corp., a big drop in loan
syndication fees depressed earnings 7% from the year-earlier
level.</p>
<p>And Banc One Corp.'s 17% rise resulted partly from its
acquisitions of two Texas banks. Excluding the Texas
acquisitions and certain one-time items, after-tax profit was
up 4.7%.</p>
<p>All common stock prices except Banc One's sagged yesterday
in New York Stock Exchange composite trading on the earnings
news. Chase fell $1.625 a share to close at $27.75; Morgan
declined 75 cents to close at $34.75; and Manufacturers'
stock fell 62.5 cents to close at $33.875. Banc One stock
edged up 12.5 cents to close at $29.125 a share.</p>
<p>Chase Manhattan</p>
<p>Today's tougher regulatory environment for banks was
reflected in Chase's decision to increase its provision for
possible loan losses to $225 million, compared with $130
million in last year's fourth quarter.</p>
<p>James J. McDermott, research director at Keefe, Bruyette &
Woods Inc., said: "Here we see the handiwork of the
regulatory examination process. Banks are anticipating
rigorous examinations and are adding to their provisions."</p>
<p>In a statement, Chase said that future provisions will
continue at high levels if the domestic commercial real
estate market deteriorates further.</p>
<p>Despite the higher provision, Chase's nonperforming assets
remained below the levels of a year earlier on both a
relative and absolute basis. Total nonaccruing loans stood at
$4.19 billion, or 3.82% of total assets, compared with $4.2
billion, or 4.08%, a year earlier.</p>
<p>Net charge-offs of bad loans for the quarter totaled $325
million, more than double the $159 million charged in the
same period a year earlier. Commercial real estate
charge-offs were $15 million, up from only $1 million a year
earlier. Charge-offs of domestic consumer loans rose by $23
million, to $83 million, largely because of portfolio growth.</p>
<p>Net interest income totaled $814 million for the quarter,
down 1.8% from $829 million a year earlier. The 1989 interest
figure includes $61 million in Brazilian payments, compared
with none in the latest quarter. Non-interest income for the
period rose 11.4% to $468 million, as consumer banking fees,
trust fees and securities trading posted gains from last
year's period.</p>
<p>J.P. Morgan</p>
<p>While Morgan showed none of the loan-quality problems
bedeviling other banks, it is feeling the slowing pace of the
general economy and corporate finance activity.</p>
<p>Excluding the effect of an accounting change for contracts
hedging interest-rate, currency and commodity risks, Morgan's
first-quarter results showed a drop in earnings to $169
million from $180 million a year earlier. Part of that
decline reflects last year's receipt of $27 million in
Brazilian interest payments; the latest quarter included no
Brazilian payments.</p>
<p>Morgan's "asset quality remains impeccable," said Mr.
McDermott of Keefe Bruyette. "For them, revenue generation is
a key issue, and expenses continue to be high."</p>
<p>Net interest income fell 11% to $266 million from $299
million, as Brazil's de facto debt moratorium and tighter
margins squeezed Morgan's net yield on interestearning assets
to 1.43% from 1.63% a year earlier.</p>
<p>More than making up for that reduction were strong
foreign-exchange and securities-trading results, which both
more than doubled to $73 million and $140 million
respectively. The strong gains in part reflected the U.S.
dollar's rise during the first quarter.</p>
<p>But one of Morgan's mainstays -- fees from advising
corporations on financial matters -- was hurt during the
period by ebbing takeover activity. Those fees fell 30% to
$62 million in the latest period.</p>
<p>Operating expenses climbed 11% from a year earlier, but
dropped 9% from the fourth quarter, when costs related to its
move to new headquarters were especially high.</p>
<p>Manufacturers Hanover</p>
<p>Two factors -- sharply lower fees from arranging loans for
leveraged buy-outs of corporations and the lack of interest
payments by Brazil and Argentina -- detracted from an
otherwise improving picture at Manufacturers.</p>
<p>Chairman John F. McGillicuddy said, "Although earnings
were down, they were nevertheless achieved in a difficult
environment, including a slowdown in corporate finance
activities."</p>
<p>Manufacturers is one the leading arrangers of senior bank
debt for leveraged buy-outs, and the slowdown in that
activity has hurt the bank's results. The latest quarter
included only $11 million in loan syndication fees, down 70%
from $37 million a year ago.</p>
<p>Similarly, the absence of interest payments by certain
Latin American borrowers reduced interest income by $18
million.</p>
<p>Despite those factors, Manufacturers was able to post
gains in both the interest and non-interest categories of
income. Net interest income was $378 million, up slightly
from $373 million a year earlier. And non-interest revenue
also rose a bit, to $326 million from $319 million.</p>
<p>Reflecting improved credit quality, Manufacturers' total
nonperforming assets and net charge-offs, excluding those of
loans to developing countries, dropped during the period.</p>
<p>Banc One</p>
<p>The Columbus, Ohio, bank holding company attributed its
record results to the inclusion of $10.7 million in its net
income by the newly created Bank One unit of Texas. That unit
is made up of the former Deposit Insurance Bridge Bank of
Dallas, whose results were included for the full quarter, as
well as Bright Bank Savings Association of Dallas, whose
results were included from Feb. 2.</p>
<p>As of March 31, Banc One said its nonperforming assets
were 1.5% of total loans, or $277 million, an increase of 7%
over its year-end total of $259 million.</p>
<p>Banc One noted that its assets excluding Bank One of Texas
were $27.2 billion at the quarter's end. The Texas unit had
assets of $14 billion, including $2.4 billion attributable to
certain provisions stemming from its purchase of the once
troubled Texas lenders.</p>
