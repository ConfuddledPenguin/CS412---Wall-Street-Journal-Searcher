	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Primerica Corp., reflecting good performance
in its three principal business segments, posted a 62% jump
in first-quarter profit as revenue rose about 17%.
   Primerica said its Smith Barney, Harris Upham & Co. unit,
despite the tough business climate on Wall Street, performed
well, particularly in retail brokerage, asset management and
investment banking. Smith Barney's results also positively
reflected the acquisition of 16 former offices of Drexel
Burnham Lambert Inc., the former Wall Street powerhouse that
has sought bankruptcy protection.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>In the quarter, Primerica's net soared to $83.2 million,
or 73 cents a share, from $51.4 million, or 53 cents a share,
a year earlier. Revenue at the financial services concern
increased to $1.44 billion from a restated $1.24 billion. The
year-earlier figure was restated to reflect revenue of
Fingerhut's direct-marketing unit, which was classified as
"assets held for sale" a year ago, and thus that revenue
wasn't included in consolidated figures.</p>
<p>The company also noted that the average number of shares
outstanding has been steadily increasing as holders convert
shares they owned before Primerica's acquisition by
Commercial Credit Inc. to new shares following the
transaction. The number of shares averaged 116.9 million in
the latest period, compared with 99.4 million a year ago.</p>
<p>In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange
yesterday, Primerica closed at $30.25, up 75 cents.</p>
<p>The performance of the consumer services, insurance
services and investment services segments showed "continuing
improvement in our marketing and product development as well
as cost management," said Sanford I. Weill, chairman and
chief executive officer.</p>
<p>Profit and revenue of the consumer finance operations both
rose 21% to $33 million and $199.3 million, respectively.
Primerica cited the integration of the consumer lending
business acquired from Barclays American/Financial on March 1
and higher profit from the Fingerhut direct-marketing unit.
In addition, the consumer operations continue to post growth
in quarter-to-quarter receivables and to keep a tight lid on
expenses, Primerica said.</p>
<p>Profit for insurance services rose 37% to $63.2 million on
a 12% increase in revenue to $570.8 million. The results
reflected Primerica's 100% ownership of the A.L. Williams
insurance company unit and the A.L. Williams general agency,
which consisted of its sales force. In November, Primerica
acquired the 30.2% stake of the insurance company unit it
didn't already own and all of the closely held agency.</p>
<p>Investment services, which include Smith Barney, showed a
34% gain to $18.1 million. The results include Primerica's
share of earnings from a minority investment and $3.3 million
in good-will costs and other adjustments related to the
acquisition of Smith Barney. Revenue rose 29% to $441.7
million.</p>
<p>Smith Barney itself earned $13.1 million, up about 15%.
Revenue spurted 32% to $384.4 million.</p>
