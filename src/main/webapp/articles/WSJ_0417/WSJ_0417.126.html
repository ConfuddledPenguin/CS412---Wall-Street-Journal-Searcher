	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- U.S. government bond prices drifted slightly
lower yesterday, partly in reaction to a wave of selling by
Japanese investors.
   Japanese institutions sold especially large amounts of
long-term U.S. government bonds, several traders and analysts
said. Among actively traded issues, prices of 30-year U.S.
Treasury bonds fell about 3/8 point, or $3.75 for each $1,000
face amount.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"There was relatively heavy selling by the Japanese," said
James R. Capra, a senior vice president at Shearson Lehman
Government Securities Inc. He said it was a continuation of
Japanese selling that began Thursday.</p>
<p>Several analysts said the Japanese selling represents the
long-awaited fallout from plunging Japanese stock prices this
year. They said Japanese institutions are selling in order to
raise cash and bolster their own markets. Japanese stock
prices have dropped more than 26% since early January.
Japanese bond prices also have slumped.</p>
<p>But other analysts attributed the Japanese selling merely
to temporary, technical factors. They predicted that Japanese
investors will resume buying U.S. bonds soon because, they
said, the strong U.S. dollar is making U.S. investments look
more attractive to foreigners. A stronger dollar also helps
reduce U.S. inflation pressures, further enhancing the appeal
of U.S. bonds.</p>
<p>Elsewhere in the bond market, prices of municipal issues
generally were unchanged, while corporate bonds finished
mixed. In the corporate junk bond market, prices of some RJR
Nabisco Inc. bonds surged on continued rumors that Kohlberg
Kravis Roberts & Co. has been buying the bonds. Kohlberg
Kravis, a leveraged buy-out firm, took the huge company
private last year in a record $25 billion transaction.</p>
<p>Investors have been focusing especially intently on
Japanese institutions because of concern about a huge wave of
U.S. Treasury borrowing scheduled for next month. The
Treasury's quarterly financing operation is expected to total
about $30 billion of three-year notes, 10-year notes and
30-year bonds. Details will be announced in early May.</p>
<p>Japanese investors have bought massive amounts of Treasury
bonds at these quarterly financings in recent years. If
Japanese institutions cut back this time around because of
turmoil in their own financial markets, that could lead to a
significant increase in U.S. borrowing costs, several
analysts fear.</p>
<p>Rumors of heavy Japanese selling buffeted the U.S. bond
market during Thursday's holiday-shortened session. Rumors
circulated that a Japanese institution sold about $600
million of U.S. bonds due in 30 years. Those rumors
contributed to declines in U.S. Treasury bond prices.</p>
<p>One reason that U.S. Treasury bond prices didn't fall more
than they did yesterday was speculation that several economic
reports today will show moderate inflation and a sluggish
economy in the U.S. last month. Among today's reports are:
March consumer prices, housing starts, industrial production
and capacity utilization.</p>
<p>According to the average forecast of 13 economists polled
by Dow Jones Capital Markets Report, consumer prices rose
only 0.2% last month. That would be a big improvement from
February's 0.5% surge.</p>
<p>The economists also expect only a small increase in
industrial production. The average forecast was a 0.2%
increase, which would be much less than February's 0.6% rise.</p>
<p>"It looks like they should be good numbers" for
bondholders, said Michael J. Moran, a vice president at Daiwa
Securities America Inc. in New York.</p>
<p>Treasury Securities</p>
<p>Treasury bond prices fell slightly after a brief rally
early in the day.</p>
<p>The Treasury's benchmark 30-year bonds fell 11/32 point to
98 18/32 to yield 8.63%. The latest 10-year notes fell about
1/8 point to 98 27/32 to yield 8.66%.</p>
<p>Early in the morning, bond prices inched higher as traders
reacted to Friday's report that producer prices fell 0.2%
last month. Economists generally had expected the report to
show a small increase in producer prices. However, excluding
the highly volatile food and energy sectors, prices rose 0.3%
in March, and many economists insist that inflation remains a
significant threat.</p>
<p>The Treasury bond market was closed Friday in observance
of Good Friday. Most securities firms and major banks closed
their bond trading desks Thursday at 2 p.m. EDT.</p>
<p>Here are details of the government's regular weekly bill
auction yesterday:</p>
<p>Rates are determined by the difference between the
purchase price and face value. Thus, higher bidding narrows
the investor's return while lower bidding widens it. The
percentage rates are calculated on a 360-day year, while the
coupon equivalent yield is based on a 365-day year.</p>
<p>                            13-Week          26-Week</p>
<p>Applications .......... $26,565,790,000  $21,374,705,000</p>
<p>Accepted bids .........  $8,218,150,000   $8,214,975,000</p>
<p>Accepted at low price .             11%              61%</p>
<p>Accepted noncompet'ly .  $1,410,595,000   $1,221,995,000</p>
<p>Average price (Rate) ..  98.051 (7.71%)   96.082 (7.75%)</p>
<p>High price (Rate) .....  98.059 (7.68%)   96.092 (7.73%)</p>
<p>Low price (Rate) ......  98.049 (7.72%)   96.077 (7.76%)</p>
<p>Coupon equivalent .....           7.97%            8.18%</p>
<p>Both issues are dated April 19. The 13-week bills mature
July 19, 1990, and the 26-week bills mature Oct. 18, 1990.</p>
<p>Corporate Issues</p>
<p>Corporate junk bonds, or speculative-grade securities with
low credit ratings or no ratings at all, finished mixed.</p>
<p>Among the star performers were RJR Nabisco payment-in-kind
securities.</p>
<p>In trading yesterday, RJR Nabisco's 13.71% convertible PIK
debentures due in 2009 finished 1 1/2 points higher to close
at 81 1/2 on the New York Stock Exchange. The other widely
held RJR issue, the 13.71% exchangeable PIK debentures
maturing in 2007, ended 2 1/4 points higher at 69 1/2.</p>
<p>High-yield dealers said there was little over-the-counter
trading in the PIK bonds. Buying by arbitragers and equity
investors has fueled the advance in PIK bonds in recent
weeks.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, in the junk bond market, high-yield bonds of
Circle K Corp. slipped after news that the convenience-store
operator has agreed in principle to a financial restructuring
with its senior lenders and a swap offer for its subordinated
debt securities outstanding.</p>
<p>As part of the restructuring, the company said it has been
stopped by its senior bank lenders from making interest
payments on its subordinated debt.</p>
<p>Consequently, the company said, it didn't pay interest due
yesterday on its $125 million principal amount of 12 3/4%
senior subordinated debentures due 1997. On the New York
Stock Exchange, the 12 3/4% debentures lost 3/4 point to
close at 24 1/2 in light trading.</p>
<p>In the investment-grade corporate debt market, actively
traded corporate issues ended the session about 3/8 point
lower.</p>
<p>Municipals</p>
<p>Resisting the downward moves of U.S. Treasurys, tax-exempt
issues were basically unchanged, with a few issues easing 1/8
point.</p>
<p>New Jersey Turnpike Authority 7.20% issue of 2018 was
unchanged on the bid side at 97 1/2 to 97 3/4 to yield 7.39%,
.01 percentage point lower than yields quoted late Thursday.</p>
<p>"Japanese investors do not own municipal securities, they
own Treasurys and that seems to be where the selling pressure
is coming from," one trader said.</p>
<p>More than $192 million in new debt was priced.</p>
<p>Mortgage-, Asset-Backed Securities</p>
<p>Chrysler Financial Corp. plans to sell $609 million of
auto-loan securities as the asset-backed securities market
heats up after a three-week lull.</p>
<p>In addition, Citicorp is scheduled to sell soon $250
million of credit-card securities, and Chemical Banking Corp.
is due to offer about $119 million of securities backed by
loans on recreational vehicles.</p>
<p>The Chrysler offering will be sold as early as today
through Asset-Backed Securities Corp., a First Boston unit.
Chrysler Financial will sell the underlying auto loans to
Asset-Backed Securities Corp., and the auto-loan securities
will be underwritten by First Boston Corp.</p>
<p>The issue is expected to get triple-A ratings based on the
quality of the underlying receivables and a letter of credit
covering 9% of the deal from Credit Suisse.</p>
<p>The issue, with an expected average life of 1.5 years, is
due to be priced at about .75 percentage point above the
Treasury two-year note. The offering will follow a $602
million auto-loan issue by Chrysler Financial last month.</p>
<p>Asset-backed securities volume had been very heavy until
the recent dry spell.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, mortgage securities ended 3/32 to 5/32 lower
after light dealings. Government National Mortgage
Association 9% securities for May delivery ended at 95 22/32,
down 5/32.</p>
<p>Foreign Bonds</p>
<p>Japanese government bond prices slumped again, hurt by the
Japanese yen's continued decline against the U.S. dollar.</p>
<p>Among actively traded issues, Japanese government bonds
due in 1999 fell 0.25 point to 85.79 as of the close of the
Tokyo Stock Exchange. Their yield rose to 7.405%. As recently
as last Thursday, these bonds were trading at a price of
86.39 to yield 7.275%.</p>
<p>Prices of short-term debt issues also fell. For example,
the price of the June futures contract declined 0.21 point to
93.29, while the yield rose to 7.15%.</p>
<p>Dealers said there is speculation that the Finance
Ministry might buy 10-year Japanese government bonds in an
attempt to bolster the sagging yen bond market. The ministry
has conducted seven bond buying operations since Feb. 21.</p>
