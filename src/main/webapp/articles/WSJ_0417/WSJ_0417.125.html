	<p class="article-leader">II-VI Inc. expects to report fiscal third-quarter net
income fell to between 7 cents and 10 cents a share, from 18
cents in the year-earlier period.
   The Pittsburgh-based optical components concern said
revenue for the quarter ended March 31 would total about
$3,850,000, compared with $3,759,000 last year.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The company attributed the lower-than-expected revenue and
earnings to reduced domestic sales to manufacturers, reduced
margins in its infrared materials business, and the slow
start-up of its Singapore manufacturing subsidiary. Results
will be reported within a week.</p>
