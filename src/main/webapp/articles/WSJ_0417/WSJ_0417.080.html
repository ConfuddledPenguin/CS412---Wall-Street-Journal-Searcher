	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- For the fifth consecutive year, NBC finished
as the No. 1 rated network in prime time, although its
audience was down 9% from last year and "The Cosby Show," the
cornerstone of its success, was no longer the top-ranked
program.
   In figures expected to be released today, National
Broadcasting Co., a unit of General Electric Co., was rated
No. 1 for the 30-week 1989-90 season with a 14.6 rating,
followed by Capital Cities/ABC Inc.'s network with a 12.9
rating. CBS Inc.'s TV network was third for the third
consecutive year with a 12.2 rating. A rating point equals
921,000 households with televisions.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Last year, NBC finished first with a rating of 16, ABC was
second with 12.9 and CBS was last with 12.2.</p>
<p>Overall, the three major networks attracted 65% of the
available audience, down 2% from last year. The networks
continue to lose viewers to alternatives such as cable
networks and News Corp.'s Fox Broadcasting Co., which has
only eight hours of prime-time programming weekly and isn't a
full-scale network.</p>
<p>ABC, which enjoyed prime-time supremacy in the late
1970's, showed significant improvement against NBC in the
1989-90 season, which ended Sunday. For instance, "Roseanne"
was the top-rated show, unseating "The Cosby Show," albeit by
two-tenths of a rating point.</p>
<p>ABC also posted crucial gains in two difficult time
periods: Sundays at 8 p.m., with "America's Funniest Home
Videos," which began in January and landed in fourth place,
and Thursdays at 9 p.m., with its new dramatic series "Twin
Peaks." Last week, in the first broadcast as a one-hour
series, "Twin Peaks" gave ABC its best ratings in that time
period in four years. It is up against NBC's popular "Cheers"
in the first half-hour.</p>
<p>Network executives conceded yesterday that of the 23
series introduced last September, virtually none were
considered a hit, although ABC said it is pleased with
"Doogie Howser, M.D.," a half-hour show about a teen-age
doctor. Each network had its own disappointment: CBS bombed
with its highly touted "Famous Teddy Z," about a mailroom
clerk-turned-Hollywood talent agent; NBC lost with "Nutt
House," created by movie screenwriter and director Mel
Brooks, and ABC failed with comedian Jackie Mason's "Chicken
Soup."</p>
<p>CBS made inroads in the critical 8 p.m. time period on
Mondays with the half-hour comedy "Major Dad" and on Tuesdays
with the one-hour reality-based series "Rescue: 911."</p>
<p>As previously reported, NBC saw an erosion of 13% in every
key demographic group that advertisers want to attract,
including the highly sought-after group of women from 18 to
49 years old. In comparison, CBS's viewing groups were down
an average of 7% and ABC was flat from year to year.</p>
<p>"We feel comfortable that we're poised for next year,"
said Alan Wurtzel, ABC's senior vice president of research.
In a news conference last week, ABC Entertainment President
Robert A. Iger declined to speculate on whether ABC would
overtake NBC next season. ABC hasn't been No. 1 since the
1979-80 season when it tied with CBS.</p>
<p>"The lesson this year," said Bob Niles, vice president of
research at NBC, "was dare to be different."</p>
<p>Such a philosophy led to success with ABC's "America's
Funniest Home Videos" and so far with "Twin Peaks" and with
Fox's "The Simpsons."</p>
<p>Mr. Niles said some series introduced by NBC late in the
season, including "Carol & Company" starring Carol Burnett,
show promise. In its first outing in its regular Saturday 10
p.m. time slot, the show won its time period.</p>
