	<p class="article-leader">International Business Machines Corp. reported a 9.2%
increase in first-quarter earnings, a surprisingly strong
performance that included the company's best results in years
in the U.S.
   The report sent IBM stock surging $3.75 to $110.875 in
composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange and helped
the whole market gain.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Some securities analysts cautioned that the results don't
mean IBM is out of the woods as far as the full year is
concerned. It must manage the delicate transition from its
current line of mainframes to a new one, and there have been
indications that it is hitting some snags. Still, analysts
generally said they were impressed by IBM's across-the-board
strength and said the stock, which has risen from $93 in
December, could continue to do well for at least the next
couple of months.</p>
<p>"It was a good quarter. It really was," said Daniel
Mandresh, an analyst at Merrill Lynch & Co.</p>
<p>Securities analysts said IBM, which showed 11% revenue
growth world-wide, had a double-digit revenue increase in the
U.S. That was apparently the first time that had happened
since 1984 and was especially impressive given that many
computer companies have said they still find the U.S. market
sluggish. IBM wouldn't comment on this assessment but did say
results were pretty well balanced between the U.S. and
overseas.</p>
<p>IBM had been expected to have good gains in mainframes and
high-end disk drives because a manufacturing problem had
limited mainframe sales a year earlier and demand for the
disk drives had been dwindling last year as they neared the
end of their product cycle. Still, IBM did even better than
expected in those areas.</p>
<p>Largely as a result, earnings rose to $1.04 billion, or
$1.81 a share, from $950 million, or $1.61 a share, a year
earlier. The per-share figure rose more than the total dollar
amount because a continuing stock-repurchase program cut the
number of shares outstanding to 574 million from 588 million.
Analysts had been raising their estimates toward the end of
the quarter; still, few expected more than $1.65 to $1.70 a
share.</p>
<p>Revenue increased to $14.19 billion from $12.73 billion.</p>
<p>IBM said it was "encouraged" by the quarter, which
represents a much more upbeat assessment than the company has
offered in recent quarters. A spokesman in Armonk, N.Y.,
added that most of the cost savings tied to the $2.4 billion
write-off IBM took late last year won't kick in until the
second half.</p>
<p>IBM could, in fact, have shown even stronger results
except that it has been leasing more machines to customers --
meaning that the revenue from a shipment is deferred over a
few years rather than appearing immediately. Rentals and
financing -- mainly leasing -- jumped 35% in the quarter to
$894 million. Jay Stevens, an analyst at Dean Witter, also
said that IBM's tax rate was at the high end of expectations
and that IBM had more shares outstanding than he had
expected.</p>
<p>"So it's not only $1.81 {a share}, higher than expected"
for the quarter, said Mr. Stevens. "It's a very high-quality
$1.81."</p>
<p>Besides the strong growth at the high end of the product
line, IBM also has indicated that its personal-computer
business is doing well, with percentage growth at least in
the mid-teens. Although IBM doesn't break out quarterly
results by product line, IBM told analysts that the AS/400
minicomputer was the only hardware line that didn't keep
pace. And that had been expected, because the two-year-old
machine has already gone through its biggest growth spurt.</p>
<p>The only real bad news was that software grew just 6.7%,
to $2.07 billion. That is apparently because IBM is offering
deals on software to get customers to buy the hardware.
Service -- mainly maintenance -- also was at the low end of
expectations, increasing 7.5% to $2.39 billion.</p>
<p>There was also one odd item in the earnings report:
Interest expense more than tripled, to $504 million from $153
million. In a conference call with analysts -- which finally
occurred in the early afternoon, after the technology failed
to work right during two attempts to have a call in the
morning -- IBM cited some borrowing to hedge against
hyperinflation, mainly in Brazil and Argentina. But some
analysts said they worried that interest expenses might stay
high.</p>
<p>As the year progresses, IBM will benefit from its recent
introduction of its RS/ 6000 workstation line, a hot series
of machines that has generated considerable initial interest.
IBM should also benefit from the introduction, possibly this
quarter, of a successor to its big-selling 4381 minicomputer.
The machine, which IBM has been slow to produce, is expected
to be available in volume late in the year.</p>
<p>The one outstanding question concerns mainframes, which
still account for nearly half IBM's revenue and more than
half of its earnings. Some consultants, customers and
industry executives have said that IBM apparently won't be
able to introduce its next generation, known as Summit, until
toward the end of next year and won't be able to provide any
significant performance boosts in the interim. That would
pose a problem because customers expect such boosts every
year or so, and IBM's competitors have impressive machines
that they apparently will be able to announce ahead of IBM.</p>
<p>While IBM has declined to comment on the subject, other
analysts have countered that they think IBM will be able to
keep customers from defecting either by using some stopgap
marketing tactics or by bringing Summit out early. The
question probably won't be fully answered until the fall or
even next winter.</p>
<p>"People might be disappointed as they start focusing on
the second half of this year and on next year," said Steve
Cohen, an analyst at SoundView Financial Group Inc. Mr. Cohen
was at the high end of first-quarter expectations, with his
prediction of $1.75 a share, but he also has been a major
proponent of the argument that IBM has mainframe problems
ahead. "IBM will be under very severe competitive pressure,"
he said.</p>
