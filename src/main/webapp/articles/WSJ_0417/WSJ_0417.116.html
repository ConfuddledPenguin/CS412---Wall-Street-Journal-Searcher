	<p class="article-leader">Golden Nugget Inc., reflecting strong business at its new
Mirage resort, said first-quarter net income jumped 71% to
$17.3 million, or 92 cents a share, from $10.1 million, or 55
cents a share, a year earlier.
   Operating revenue rose to $208.1 million from $49.9
million.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Stephen Wynn, chairman, said the Mirage had operating
profit of $44.3 million in the quarter. He said the resort's
expenses, which were scaled back following a late November
opening, total about $1.1 million a day. Non-casino revenues
are running about $800,000 a day, he said.</p>
<p>Mr. Wynn said the company's downtown casino reported an
86% increase in earnings despite the publicity generated by
the Mirage. The downtown casino reported $13.5 million in
operating profit, which Mr. Wynn said was a record
first-quarter performance for the property. The Laughlin
casino, which is under expansion, reported $810,000 in
operating profit.</p>
<p>The results were stronger than most analysts expected.</p>
