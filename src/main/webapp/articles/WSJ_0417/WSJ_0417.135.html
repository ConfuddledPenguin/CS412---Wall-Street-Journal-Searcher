	<p class="article-leader">Environmental Power Corp., Boston, reported its second
consecutive year of big losses and said its auditors raised
questions about its ability to "continue as a going concern."
   The developer of plants that turn waste coal and trash
into electrical power reported a net loss of $4.2 million, or
55 cents a share, compared with a loss of $4.7 million, or 61
cents a share, for 1989. Revenue rose to $583,026 from
$514,341.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The company said the loss was partly due to $2.5 million
in reserves related to a former unit that is developing a
waste-to-energy plant in Galveston, Texas.</p>
<p>Environmental Power's auditors, Ernst & Young, said in
their opinion that the company's ability to continue may
depend on completing financing of its current projects on
schedule or else finding alternative financing.</p>
<p>Environmental Power said it believes its "arrangements
will be sufficient," but added that there isn't any assurance
the financing will be completed on time or on favorable
terms.</p>
