	<p class="article-leader">Eli Lilly & Co. said first-quarter net income surged 20%
and that it plans to spend as much as $1 billion to buy back
stock and certain convertible warrants.
   The Indianapolis pharmaceuticals giant said net was aided
by continued rapid growth of its Prozac anti-depressant and
other recent products. Profit was $340.8 million, or $1.16 a
share, up from the year-earlier $284.7 million, or 99 cents a
share. The year-earlier per-share figure reflects a 2-for-1
stock split a year ago. Sales climbed 18% to $1.24 billion
from a restated $1.05 billion.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>While the results marked the latest in a recent string of
excellent quarterly earnings for Lilly, the results fell
slightly short of some analysts' projections.</p>
<p>In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday,
Lilly dropped as much as $1.50 on heavy trading; the stock
edged up to close off $1.25, at $67.25. Volume was 1.4
million shares.</p>
<p>As in recent quarters, Lilly cited surging sales of
Prozac, as well as contributions from the Axid anti-ulcer
drug, Ceclor antibiotic, and the company's human growth
hormone product. Lilly's medical instrument systems segment
also showed solid growth, the company said; in that segment,
the company's Advanced Cardiovascular Systems unit is seen by
analysts as benefiting from regulatory difficulties a major
competitor has encountered.</p>
<p>Late in the trading day, Lilly said directors had approved
spending as much as $1 billion to buy back common stock as
well as "a portion" of the warrants outstanding.</p>
<p>The company currently has 279 million common shares
outstanding; in addition, there are 13 million warrants that,
for an exercise price of $75.98, can each be converted into
two Lilly common shares. In Big Board composite trading
yesterday, the warrants, issued in conjunction with Lilly's
1986 acquisition of what is now the company's Hybritech Inc.
unit, fell $1.875 to $60.625.</p>
<p>Lilly said any stock bought back will be used to "satisfy,
in part," its obligation to issue shares as the warrants are
exercised.</p>
<p>In late 1987, the company authorized a buy-back of as much
as $1 billion; the company has used about $500 million of
that program for largely anti-dilutive measures related to
various stock plans and note-conversion obligations.</p>
<p>Separately, Upjohn Co. said first-quarter earnings rose
11% to $114.3 million, or 61 cents a share, from $103
million, or 55 cents a share. Sales increased 3.7% to $772.9
million from $745.1 million. The year-ago results were
restated to reflect discontinued operations.</p>
<p>The company said the cost-control measures it undertook
last year were responsible for most of the earnings gain.</p>
<p>U.S. sales were $485 million, up 6%, in part reflecting
price increases on some products in March. Foreign sales,
which were 37% of consolidated sales, were flat at $288
million. Rogain, the treatment for baldness, and Motrin IB, a
nonprescription internal analgesic introduced in June,
contributed significantly to U.S. growth, Upjohn said.</p>
