	<p class="article-leader">LITHUANIA CALLED for talks with Gorbachev about Moscow's
economic threats.
   Amid reports that the Baltic republic was prepared to
compromise on certain independence-related issues, Lithuania
appealed in a telegram for a meeting with the Soviet leader
to discuss details of the Kremlin's threatened economic
sanctions. The move followed a meeting of the republic's
leadership. Gorbachev, in an ultimatum issued Friday, gave
Lithuania 48 hours to end its secession bid or face a cutoff
of crucial products. Moscow apparently hasn't taken any
action.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Vilnius Radio reported that "political decisions" about
Gorbachev's ultimatum would be addressed during a meeting
today of Lithuania's parliament.</p>

<p>NEPAL'S KING ASKED the once-banned opposition to form an
interim government.</p>
<p>Bowing to demands for further democratic change, King
Birendra asked the Nepali Congress Party to form a government
to rule until the country's first free elections in nearly
three decades are held. The opposition party and the
seven-party United Left Front led nationwide pro-democracy
protests that began in February. The move came after the
monarch dissolved the nonpartisan national assembly and
announced the resignation of the prime minister.</p>
<p>The concessions followed the king's April 8 decision to
lift a 29-year-old ban on political parties in an effort to
end the protests in the Himalayan nation.</p>

<p>The Supreme Court refused to hear the appeal of Dalton
Prejean, a retarded man scheduled to be executed in Louisiana
last November for the shooting death of a state trooper.

violated because he is black but was convicted by a jury from
which blacks were excluded.</p>

<p>A leaking gas cylinder exploded aboard a moving commuter
train in northeastern India, killing at least 80 people and
injuring 65 others, authorities said. The number of
passengers wasn't known, and the casualty toll is expected to
rise. Fire swept through the 16-car train as it traveled in
Bihar state, about 500 miles southeast of New Delhi.</p>
<p>India's government banned eight militant Moslem groups in
Kashmir and closed two newspapers in its latest effort to
control unrest in the disputed territory. At least 270 people
have been killed in a three-month-old independence drive in
the region.</p>

<p>Nicaragua's Ortega raised the possibility that the April
25 inauguration of President-elect Violeta Chamorro could be
postponed if the Contra rebels aren't disarmed by that date.
In Washington, Bush suggested that a congressional delay on a
Nicaraguan aid package would be an affront to Chamorro.</p>

<p>Election returns in Yugoslavia showed that a center-right
coalition won a legislative majority in Slovenia's April 8
multiparty balloting. The final results will allow the
six-party alliance in the northern republic to form the
nation's first non-Communist regional government in 45 years.</p>

<p>Delegates from 17 nations gathered for a White

implications.</p>

<p>The U.S. and Soviet Union were urged in a National Academy

<p>Mandela attended a rock concert at London's Wembley
Stadium and, in an address to the crowd of about 72,000

Africa. Prime Minister Thatcher already has eased such curbs.</p>
