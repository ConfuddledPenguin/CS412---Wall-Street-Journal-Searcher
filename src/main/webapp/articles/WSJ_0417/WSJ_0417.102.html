	<p class="article-leader">Temple-Inland Inc. reported first-quarter earnings
increased 14% because of a reduced tax rate. Pretax operating
results declined by about 4.7% due to lower margins in its
paper and building products divisions and in spite of
improved results in its financial services and bleached paper
operations.
   The Diboll, Texas, company reported that earnings declined
in its building products group because of "softness in
building activity." Earnings in the company's container and
containerboard businesses also declined, the result of price
declines and increased costs. The company said its building
products earnings have begun improving in the second quarter,
but it expects continued "margin erosion" in its paper
products businesses for the rest of the year.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>For the first quarter, the company reported earnings of
$62.2 million, or $1.12 a share, compared with $54.5 million,
or 98 cents a share, a year earlier. Revenue increased about
25% to $591.2 million from $473.5 million, while
manufacturing sales increased 3% to $477 million from $462.6
million.</p>
