	<p class="article-leader">TOKYO -- Japanese companies were involved in 740 mergers
and acquisitions in the fiscal year ended March 31, up from
556 a year earlier, a Yamaichi Securities Co. survey found.
   The survey included mergers and acquisitions by Japanese
corporations domestically and overseas, as well as those of
Japanese concerns by foreign companies. Officially announced
mergers and acquisitions activities in the latest fiscal
year, 400 cases of the total, had a total value of 3.672
trillion yen ($23.2 billion).</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Japanese purchases of foreign concerns increased to 448
from 334, Yamaichi said. Foreign concerns acquired or merged
with only 14 Japanese companies in fiscal 1990. Mergers and
acquisitions between Japanese companies totaled 14.</p>
<p>European companies were a focus of Japanese mergers and
acquisitions, which doubled to 114. Japanese companies are
pursuing entry to the region ahead of the creation of a
unified market in the European Community at the end of 1992.</p>
<p>Of the total cases, 226 involved U.S. companies, up from
163 a year earlier.</p>
