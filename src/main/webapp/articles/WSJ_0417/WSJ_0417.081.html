	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- Don't expect international commercial banks
to take the lead in financing economic reconstruction in
Eastern Europe, a bank-supported research group warned.
   The Institute of International Finance said banks will be
"cautious" about making new long-term loans to governments
and government-owned enterprises in Eastern Europe because
they fear a repeat of the large loan losses they had in Latin
America and other Third World nations.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>In a report released yesterday, the institute said banks
are likely to confine themselves for the most part to
financing trade and specific development projects in Eastern
Europe. Such loans generally are for short periods and are
better-collateralized than "sovereign risk" loans, which are
backed by borrowing governments.</p>
<p>The institute acknowledged that its assessment of Eastern
Europe's prospects is partly intended to lower expectations
of the region's capacity to be rapidly integrated with the
West. "There's a grave danger that all this hype about
Eastern Europe can give an impression of economic strength
that isn't there," an institute spokesman said.</p>
<p>The report urged Western governments and multilateral
financial institutions, including the newly created European
Bank for Reconstruction and Development, to accept most of
the burden of aiding Eastern Europe. "The banks aren't in the
business of conducting foreign economic policy," said Horst
Schulmann, the institute's managing director.</p>
<p>The report noted that countries in Eastern Europe are
still poorly integrated into the world economy and have large
debt burdens. At the end of last year, seven East and Central
European countries collectively owed the West $116.8 billion;
that doesn't count those countries' debts to the Soviet Union
and its allies, which aren't convertible into other
currencies.</p>
<p>The report said Hungary and Poland are moving ahead of
their neighbors in adopting market-oriented policies, while
Romania and Bulgaria are lagging far behind. It added that
East Germany, Czechoslovakia and Hungary have the best
chances of obtaining fresh financing because of their
debt-service record, close ties with the West and the
relative strength of their reform governments.</p>
<p>The institute suggested that East European countries need
to attract more private investment before they can obtain
substantial new bank lending. Banks won't step up their
lending until they see a "better balance between debt and
equity" in the region's capital supply, said Mr. Schulmann.
By attracting more long-term capital, Eastern Europe can
avoid a debt crisis such as occurred in many Latin American
countries in the early 1980s, he asserted.</p>
<p>The report said East European countries can best help
themselves by abandoning rigid price controls, releasing
state enterprises to the private sector, liberalizing trade
and investment rules and moving toward a system of freely
convertible currencies. At the same time, it said, these
countries can make their markets more attractive to foreign
investors by establishing property rights, improving their
judicial systems and promoting uniform accounting standards.</p>
<p>Mr. Schulmann added that Western banks will have more
incentive to do business in the region if they are allowed to
open branches and provide general banking services there.
Currently, the opportunities for Western banks to provide
such services are limited.</p>
