	<p class="article-leader">PARIS -- Cie. des Machines Bull will pay $15 million to
Zenith Electronics Corp. to end a two-year dispute and
complete its acquisition of Zenith's personal-computer
business.
   In Glenview, Ill., Zenith said it will take a charge of
about $11 million in the first quarter because the negotiated
final payment was less than the net receivable for the sold
business that it had recorded on its books at year end.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Bull agreed to the purchase for $635 million last October.
The sale was subject to approval by Zenith stockholders. By
the time the stockholders approved the deal in December, Bull
officials asserted that the assets of Zenith's once
fast-growing personal computer division had deteriorated, and
they paid Zenith $496.4 million.</p>
<p>Bull remained dissatisfied even at that lower price and
demanded a refund of $49 million after a review of Zenith's
books. In March Zenith not only rejected that claim but
declared it was entitled to an additional $49 million.</p>
<p>To resolve the matter, both companies have agreed that
Bull should pay Zenith $15 million, bringing the price to
$511.4 million.</p>
<p>With the Zenith acquisition, Bull hopes to enter the
personal-computer big leagues. It more than doubles the size
of the French computer maker's personal-computer business.</p>
