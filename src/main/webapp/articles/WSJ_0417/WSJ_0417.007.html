	<p class="article-leader">PITTSBURGH -- Aluminum Co. of America reported a 46%
decline in first-quarter earnings as the No. 1 aluminum maker
lost market share in its core beverage container business.
   Net income in the period fell to $148.6 million, or $1.69
a share, from $276 million, or $3.12 a share, a year earlier.
Sales were flat at $2.64 billion.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The earnings, which were consistent with analysts'
expectations, reflect generally weak demand for aluminum and
a consequent decline in metal prices. They also reflect a
$4.1 million, or five cent a share, unfavorable adjustment
for foreign currencies as well as the unfavorable impact of
government measures to control inflation on Alcoa's
operations in Brazil, which broke even in the quarter.</p>
<p>The latest results were also adversely affected by a
controversial pricing strategy initiated last November. As
part of the strategy, which was directed by Alcoa Chairman
Paul O'Neill, Alcoa at first refused to match the price
discounting of its rivals in the beverage-container market.
Since then Alcoa has lost perhaps $100 million of sales and
several percentage points of can-market share.</p>
<p>Alcoa took that stand, Mr. O'Neill asserts, to maintain
pricing integrity for fabricated aluminum products. He argues
that prices for can sheet shouldn't be lowered simply because
of falling prices for ingot, the raw metal from which
container sheet is made. And the executive says Alcoa has
already regained some customers and will win back even more
as the year progresses and can-sheet supplies tighten.</p>
<p>The first-quarter results, though, show the penalty of
that strategy. Because of fewer orders for can sheet, Alcoa
sold 42% of its 634,000 metric tons in shipments as raw ingot
in the quarter, up from 34% a year earlier. Ingot, the
primary form of aluminum, commands less profit than
fabricated products like can sheet.</p>
<p>The high ingot-to-shipment ratio "is an indication of
Alcoa having lost market share in the container business" in
the first quarter, says analyst Peter Anker of First Boston.</p>
<p>Still, Mr. Anker and others believe the first quarter will
be the trough for Alcoa. He expects the company to do better
in subsequent quarters. Overall, he predicts Alcoa will earn
$7.50 a share this year, down from a record $10.67 in 1989.</p>
<p>Mr. O'Neill, who dislikes forecasting earnings, suggested
as much in his statement. "Alcoa's order rates in March were
better than in recent months," the executive said.</p>
