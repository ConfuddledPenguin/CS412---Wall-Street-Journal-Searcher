	<p class="article-leader">Sceptre Resources Ltd. said it will offer for sale a group
of Canadian oil and gas properties, which in aggregate
produce about 700 barrels of oil or gas liquids, and 21
million cubic feet of natural gas a day.
   Sceptre, in Calgary, Alberta, didn't estimate a value for
the properties, but an analyst said they could fetch about 50
million Canadian dollars (US$43 million).</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The estimate is in line with previous company figures,
which called for the sale of about C$60 million of
"non-strategic" oil and gas assets as part of a
debt-reduction program. Sceptre has already agreed to sell a
package of U.S. assets for US$11.5 million.</p>
<p>Sceptre's long-term bank debt, which totaled C$305.9
million on Dec. 31, shrank to about C$208.8 million after an
issue of common shares was completed in February, said a
company executive.</p>
<p>Sceptre's debt swelled with its C$273 million purchase of
Oakwood Petroleums Ltd. early last year. Based on 1989
results, the Canadian assets Sceptre plans to sell equal
about 13% of the company's gas output, and 4.3% of oil or gas
liquids production.</p>
