	<p class="article-leader">AmVestors Financial Corp. said it had a net loss of $7.9
million, or 55 cents a share, for the fourth quarter ended
Dec. 31, largely because of losses related to junk bonds.
   In the fourth quarter of 1988, the Topeka, Kan.-based life
insurance concern had net income of about $2 million, or 15
cents a share.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>AmVestors said its fourth-quarter results include $16.3
million in investment losses, most of which were related to
high-yield bonds issued by real-estate concerns. In the
fourth quarter of 1988, it had investment losses of $930,158.</p>
<p>The company said it stopped purchasing high-yield bonds at
year end, and is now trying to reduce its junk-bond holdings
to less than 20% of assets by the end of 1990, from about 30%
of assets at Dec. 31.</p>
<p>The fourth quarter also included a $6.1 million after-tax
gain related to a co-insurance agreement in which AmVestors
ceded 90% of the risk of its single-premium, whole-life
policies written before 1989.</p>
<p>For the year, AmVestors had a net loss of $4.5 million, or
31 cents a share, after investment losses of $18.7 million.
In 1988, AmVestors had net income of $6.6 million, or 58
cents a share, after investment losses of $579,428.</p>
