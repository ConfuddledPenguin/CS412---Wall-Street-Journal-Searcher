	<p class="article-leader">How badly does Time Warner Inc. want readers for
Entertainment Weekly? This badly:
   Time Warner has released a blizzard of direct mail to
solicit readers. Those who don't respond to the initial
mailing quickly get a follow-up offering a shorter
subscription option. To those who still don't want to commit
themselves, Time Warner will send four free copies. Bite on
any of that, and you could receive a "welcome" gift: a box of
goodies including coupons for movies and records, a
refrigerator magnet (with the Entertainment Weekly logo) and
microwave popcorn.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Time Warner executives had always planned a hard sell for
Entertainment Weekly, the company's first major magazine
launch since the ill-fated TV-Cable Week in 1983, which left
Time with a $54 million write-off. With expensive hype
surrounding the magazine's debut, Entertainment Weekly's
advertising sales and subscription numbers so far show
promise. But the publication, not quite three months old,
already is in need of fixing: It is being redesigned after
complaints from advertisers and readers that it is simply too
hard to read.</p>
<p>Time Warner executives admit some mistakes but say they
aren't retreating from their commitment to the magazine.
"After the excitement of the launch, every magazine runs into
the first-inning blues," says Reginald Brack, president of
Time Inc. Magazines. "The concept of the magazine is simple,
and we are committed to it. Now we are just working on the
execution." He says Time is spending "under $50 million" to
launch the magazine and expects it to be profitable by about
1994.</p>
<p>Before its merger with Warner Communications Inc. last
year, Time showed plenty of patience with new publications:
It stuck with Sports Illustrated for eight years before it
turned a profit, and People had lean years after its launch
in 1974. But Time Warner, saddled with $10.6 billion in debt,
is a different company today. It needs new publications that
look like guaranteed successes and that can make major
contributions to cash flow.</p>
<p>Moreover, Entertainment Weekly is being launched in a far
more perilous era for the magazine industry in general.
"Entertainment Weekly is dealing with a very soft magazine
market," says Bob Zach, vice president, media director,
Chiat/Day/Mojo Inc. ad agency. "There are more magazines out
there chasing ad pages than there are ad pages available. The
supply and demand is absolutely in favor of the advertiser."</p>
<p>Time knows that only too well. In the first quarter, the
company's flagship weekly publications, Time, People and
Sports Illustrated, saw ad pages drop 12.4%, 18.4% and 17.8%,
respectively, from a year earlier. Other publishers' weeklies
also are hurting, including Washington Post Co.'s Newsweek,
U.S. News & World Report and News Corp.'s TV Guide.</p>
<p>Publishers blame the slump largely on major cuts in
spending by tobacco companies and domestic auto makers. The
tobacco companies face growing legislative pressure from
Washington. Detroit's auto sales have stalled, as have the
number of new-car introductions. In this year's first three
months, revenue from auto ads in U.S. consumer magazines
dropped 7.5%; that from cigarette and tobacco products fell
25%.</p>
<p>Even Time's vaunted Max-Plan, which offers big advertisers
discounts on future purchases, hasn't provided much help.
"Max-Plan will help us this year, but it won't change things
around," says Donald M. Elliman Jr., executive vice president
at Time. "All I can say now is the first quarter does not the
year make." Entertainment Weekly has been added to Max-Plan,
joining such titles such as Life, People, and Time.</p>
<p>Entertainment Weekly was supposed to hit the ground
running. A guide to what's hot in television, movies, video,
recorded music, and books, the magazine was conceived as a
buying guide for well-paid, well-educated yuppies. After an
aggressive subscription campaign before its launch in early
February, Entertainment Weekly had about 800,000
subscriptions or requests for sample issues. About 160
advertisers agreed to run multiple ads in the first two
years, many enticed by a charter discount plan.</p>
<p>Since its debut, however, Entertainment Weekly has been
greeted with noticeable disappointment. The magazine's "au
courant" type style and design make it crowded, busy and hard
to read, critics say. They also say the reviews, the
magazine's backbone, come off as too cute and smart-alecky.
And all this costs $51.48 a year by subscription -- less than
the $1.95 cover price, but still a hefty price at a time when
most publishers offer deep discounts on subscriptions.</p>
<p>"I didn't expect what I first saw. There was too much of
it, and it was a real eye strain to read," says Paul
DuCharme, media director for Grey Advertising. "Our
expectations were very high at the launch. There was a
letdown, but the editors are responding to it quickly and
making changes. They are responding to the advertising
community."</p>
<p>Though Entertainment Weekly was in the planning stages for
five years and Time conducted extensive direct-mail tests to
gauge the potential audience, Publisher Michael Klingensmith
says the company anticipated that it would have to make
changes in design and story choices, even so soon after
launch. "We always expected the magazine to evolve and to
make changes as we went," he says. "No magazine is perfect
from the start."</p>
<p>Some improvements are simply coming with time. Editor Jeff
Jarvis says the magazine is now getting "better" photographs
from movie studios for coming films, and is landing
celebrities such as directors Spike Lee and David Lynch and
comedian Jay Leno to pose for covers. Spurred by responses
from readers, Mr. Jarvis says he will increase the number of
movie capsule reviews and reorganize the TV capsule reviews.
He has already elevated the "Kids" section on entertainment
products to the status of a major department.</p>
<p>After a redesign within the next eight weeks,
Entertainment Weekly "will get a noticeably different look,"
says Mr. Klingensmith. "The pages will be cleaner, less
packed with things, and organization will be tighter."</p>
<p>Through eight issues, Entertainment Weekly has pulled in
175 ad pages, or about 22 pages an issue, regarded as a
moderate success. "That's well above what we projected," says
Mr. Klingensmith. In contrast to Time's other magazines
recently, Entertainment Weekly has been able to attract a
fair share of tobacco and auto advertising. Tobacco ads
account for 10% of the magazine's ad revenues. But ad rates
in the magazine are a mere $19,000 for a full page, while a
page in Time magazine costs about $100,000.</p>
<p>The biggest challenge appears to be building circulation.
During the first five weeks of publication, Entertainment
Weekly's circulation ballooned as high as 1.1 million. That
included paid subscribers and those who had taken Time Warner
up on its offer of four free issues. After the large number
of initial giveaways, Entertainment Weekly's circulation has
settled at about 600,000, including paid subscribers and
copies sold on newsstands.</p>
<p>But some media specialists say Time Warner's target
audience will be hard to convert into paying customers,
regardless of how many "welcome" baskets go out. "We think
Entertainment Weekly will have the toughest time finding
readers in the largest, metropolitan markets where there are
already good local magazines and newspaper sections with
reviews on entertainment," says Chiat's Mr. Zach. "We still
aren't sure who the reader will turn out to be and whether
that will be a strong audience for advertisers."</p>
