	<p class="article-leader">FLAT ROCK, Mich. -- Mazda Motor Corp's. sprawling assembly
plant here was supposed to show the world that Japanese
management and experienced U.S. auto workers from the heart
of union country could be a profitable mix.
   But 2 1/2 years after Mazda began building cars just 15
miles south of Detroit, the mix is turning sour.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Four top U.S. managers have quit the company since 1988,
and now Japanese executives have taken the senior posts that
Americans once held. The company is on its fourth director of
labor relations since hiring began in 1986. Unionized workers
are boycotting Mazda's suggestion box, a cornerstone of
Japanese-style management.</p>
<p>What's more, union leaders here curry favor among
rank-and-file workers by taking pot-shots at Japanese
managers. Mazda executives, in turn, grouse about the
Americans' poor work attendance. Overall, industry experts
say, Mazda's relations with its American workers, both blue-
and white-collar, are worse than at any of the seven other
Japanese-owned or operated U.S. auto plants.</p>
<p>As more Japanese companies set up shop in the U.S.,
relations between Japanese bosses and American workers are
shaping up to be a work place issue of the 1990s. Most
Japanese companies are loath to acknowledge any problems. But
experts say Mazda isn't the only one having trouble.</p>
<p>"What's happening in Flat Rock isn't unique, it's just
that the union situation makes problems there public," says
Robert Cole, a University of Michigan professor who studies
Japanese companies in the U.S. "Americans feel as if they're
left out of the information network" in many Japanese-run
operations, he adds, and American managers "feel that the top
spots are blocked." Increasingly, as at Mazda, the results
are high turnover among American executives, and resentment
among bluecollar workers.</p>
<p>This isn't how Mazda officials envisioned it would be in
1984. That's when they bowed to pressure from Ford Motor Co.,
which owns 25% of Mazda, and declared they would become the
first -- and so far only -- Japanese auto maker to build cars
in Michigan.</p>
<p>UAW leaders wanted smooth labor relations at Mazda. That,
they reasoned, would give them "a chance to be more
successful in organizing the other Japanese plants" in the
U.S., says William Judson, the top UAW official at the Flat
Rock plant before he was ousted in an election last year.</p>
<p>But UAW higher-ups lost control of events at Flat Rock.
They got blind-sided when hard-line activists unseated local
leaders, such as Mr. Judson, who espoused a more cooperative
line. Now, the trouble at Mazda is bolstering the resolve of
other Japanese auto makers to fight the union.</p>
<p>"In my opinion, the work ethic is stronger down here"
without a union, says Jerry Benefield, plant manager of
Nissan Motor Co.'s assembly plant in Smyrna, Tenn. In a
bitter campaign, Nissan rebuffed a UAW organizing drive at
Smyrna last year. So far, the UAW has organized only those
Japanese plants where the company agreed to the idea before
operations began.</p>
<p>Mazda did just that, but tried to weed out any
rabble-rousers when it screened 100,000 candidates for plant
jobs. The company got a work force more educated and nearly a
generation younger than the oldline UAW workers at most Big
Three plants. But it didn't keep out people like Mildred
Willis, a dedicated labor activist whose father founded a
chapter of the plumbers union.</p>
<p>Ms. Willis, an outspoken 32-year-old, shares with older
UAW members a distaste for things Japanese. She drives a
Chevrolet, not a Mazda. And as a representative for Mazda's
night-shift workers, she's quick to criticize the Japanese
managers.</p>
<p>"I think they need to listen a little bit more," she says.
"I like to see that an employee's word is being taken." Ms.
Willis is now a thorn in Mazda's side, distributing
anti-management leaflets at the plant gate and fighting to
allow workers to get treatment for sore elbows and other
minor injuries on company time.</p>
<p>It hasn't helped that U.S. consumers aren't exactly
clamoring for the cars the Flat Rock plant builds. Slow sales
have forced Mazda to cut Flat Rock's production by 11% this
year.</p>
<p>As production slowed, Mazda kept a promise not to lay off
any of its 2,900 fulltime UAW workers -- in contrast to
normal practice at Big Three plants. But Mazda has laid off
some UAW members who it hired as "temporary" workers. Mazda
has the right to hire temporary workers, who earn less than
full-timers, under an unusual arrangement with the UAW, which
traditionally has opposed schemes that create two classes of
workers in the same factory.</p>
<p>Masahiro Uchida, who runs Mazda's U.S. manufacturing
operations, says UAW members should be grateful that the
temporary workers act as a buffer protecting their paychecks.
But UAW leaders want to curtail the practice, particularly in
light of hints from Ford officials that they'd like to use
temporary workers, too, and may raise the issue during
contract talks this summer.</p>
<p>Underlying the tension over specific issues are deeper
cultural divides. Even before Flat Rock opened, Mazda
executives wondered aloud if U.S. workers could hustle the
way Japanese workers do. Then came Osamu Nobuto, former chief
of Mazda's U.S. operations. Unusually blunt for a Japanese
executive, Mr. Nobuto publicly lambasted U.S. workers for
lacking dedication.</p>
<p>"Mr. Nobuto didn't understand us and we didn't understand
him," says Greg Drudi, the top UAW official in the plant.</p>
<p>Mr. Uchida, who recently succeeded Mr. Nobuto, says he
won't be so outspoken. He's quick to say that Mazda cars
built at Flat Rock are just as good as those built in Japan.
(Independant experts also give Flat Rock high marks for
quality.)</p>
<p>But Mr. Uchida's arrival hasn't changed the kaizen, or
continuous improvement, management philosophy that Mr. Nobuto
put in place. In practice, kaizen translates into a
never-ending push to cut the number of worker-hours spent
building each car, reduce assembly defects, and simplify
factory processes. Mazda swears by kaizen. Mazda's U.S.
workers swear at it. To some union members, kaizen is only a
Japanese word for the old Detroit practice of speeding up the
assembly line.</p>
<p>Mazda and its union also are scuffling over charges that
the company is being unreasonable about absenteeism, sick
leave, and worker compensation requests.</p>
<p>"If you get injured at work, you better have a witness and
you better have gotten hit by a car," says Penelope Dawkins,
who coordinates benefits for union workers at the plant.</p>
<p>The company admits to toughening its policy for sick pay,
but it denies stiffening its worker's compensation policy.
The union counters that Mazda has denied nine of 10 filings
for injury compensation since Jan. 1.</p>
<p>Mazda's efforts to cut absenteeism have caused even more
trouble. On an average day, about 3% of Mazda workers simply
don't show up for work, and an additional 7% are out on sick
days, vacations and the like. That 10% absentee rate is lower
than General Motors Corp.'s, but higher than other Japanese
plants in the U.S.</p>
<p>Last fall, Mazda's top ranking U.S. executives tried
applying their own ideas to fix the absenteeism problem.
Their plan: boost the annual bonus for perfect attendance to
$1,500 from $500. In return, the company got a union
concession making it easier to fire workers who were absent
more than 15 days.</p>
<p>But the day after the union approved the agreement, the
two senior U.S.managers who negotiated the deal abruptly
resigned. A Mazda spokesman said the Americans quit because
their Japanese superiors weren't happy with the negotiations.</p>
<p>The incident illustrates how little latitude Mazda's U.S.
managers have to make their own decisions, says Robert
Fucini, who has co-written a book on the plant. Each morning,
for instance, U.S. managers at Mazda get a "grocery list"
from their Japanese "adviser" that tells them just what they
are supposed to do that day.</p>
<p>Mr. Uchida concedes that Mazda's practice of making
decisions by consensus often gives the appearance of keeping
authority away from its U.S. executives. But despite such
problems, he insists that Flat Rock will be a success. "I
don't think there's anything that has hurt the future of our
company," he says.</p>
<p>Does that mean Mazda would build cars in Michigan if it
could start all over again? Mr. Uchida just breaks into a
broad grin and laughs.</p>
