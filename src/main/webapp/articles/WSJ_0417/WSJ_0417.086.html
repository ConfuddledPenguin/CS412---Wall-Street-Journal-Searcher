	<p class="article-leader">In his March 20 Business World column on the seizure of
Franklin Savings Association, Tim W. Ferguson reports that
the Office of Thrift Supervision district chief ". . .
maintains that Franklin's dealings aren't as arcane as
they've been made out to be." While they may not be arcane,
they are analytically sophisticated, and I doubt that many
federal regulators have the refinement to understand them or
to differentiate between risk-reducing and risk-increasing
strategies using mortgage derivatives.
   So I agree with Mr. Ferguson that this kind of
"experimentation" does not belong in institutions that
receive taxpayer guarantees and require regulatory oversight.
By the same token, the traditional practice of making 30-year
loans while issuing short-term deposits -- or as Ernest
Fleischer of Franklin aptly labels it, "shorting an option"
-- doesn't belong there either.</p>
