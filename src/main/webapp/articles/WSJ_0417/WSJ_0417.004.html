	<p class="article-leader">WARSAW -- Solidarity begins its second national congress
Thursday in the same Gdansk hall where its first congress
took place in September 1981. With Solidarity running Poland
now, and the country in economic detoxification, it is bound
to be an occasion of high rhetoric and calls for renewed
sacrifice. But the agenda makes no note of the biggest issue
the delegates face: Lech Walesa's ego.
   Poland's revolution has been hard on Mr. Walesa. A year
ago he was the uncontested leader of the Polish nation.
Today, he chairs a fairly ineffectual trade union with 2.2
million members. The delegates will surely re-elect him to
that post, but Mr. Walesa wants more. He wants to be Poland's
president, and may expect the congress to endorse him. The
leaders of Solidarity's government, on the other hand, would
rather he stayed in Gdansk.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"This is a time for diplomats and professional
politicians," a Solidarity deputy says. "He isn't a diplomat,
and he's a great politician, but not a professional."</p>
<p>Mr. Walesa has stood petulantly by while Tadeusz
Mazowiecki, the quiet man he anointed as prime minister last
summer, has crept ahead of him in the popularity polls. And
he has endured the sight of Czechoslovakia's unprofessional
new president, playwright Vlaclav Havel, barnstorming the
world. The Czechoslovaks, Mr. Walesa said recently, "naively
think that if someone was at a rally and the next minute he
was president, then he can only make good moves."</p>
<p>"There's a testiness to his tone," a diplomat says. "He's
not in the loop. He's a public figure, but day-to-day he
isn't involved. There's an element of frustration."</p>
<p>No one could irk Mr. Walesa more than the current occupant
of Poland's presidential palace. Gen. Wojciech Jaruzelski,
Solidarity's one-time persecutor, no longer seems such a
villain. He got his job before convulsions elsewhere in
Eastern Europe made compromise with Communists unnecessary,
yet he has become the kind of detached, pliant president
Solidarity's government wants. Moreover, his ties with Moscow
and the old Communist elite have helped him.</p>
<p>"Mazowiecki is happy to have a weak president. At the same
time, the two have a working relationship," says commentator
Kostek Gebert. "Apart from Walesa and his men, nobody really
wants Jaruzelski out."</p>
<p>Mr. Walesa chose to publicize his ambitions last week,
just before the Solidarity congress, going out of his way to
make them known while cryptically denying them at the same
time. It was also the week Mr. Jaruzelski saw Mikhail S.
Gorbachev in Moscow and came home with a Soviet admission of
guilt for the mass murder of Poland's officer corps in World
War II. Yet Mr. Walesa's timing was more than a ploy to
upstage the general. It reflects a keen politician's reading
of the public mood.</p>
<p>If Mr. Walesa is frustrated now, the Poles soon will be.
As the living standard collapses and unemployment bites, he
senses, the popular thirst for revenge will rise. Last month,
Mr. Walesa demanded a "speeding up" of reform -- not of
free-market reform, apparently, but a quicker end to the
outdated deal that keeps people like Gen. Jaruzelski in
office. He demanded special tribunals and decrees to trap
Communist kingpins who escaped unpunished by the revolution
and who now, he said, profit shadily from the mess they left.</p>
<p>"I am regarded as undemocratic," he said, "but I am
effectively the most democratic man in this land. First of
all, democracy must not get in the way of your work."</p>
<p>Solidarity's government sympathizers expect to be beaten
with this stick in Gdansk. "There will be a vast populistic
explosion," Mr. Gebert predicted. And the union's leaders can
look forward to a whipping for their passive acceptance of
heartless austerity. The result will further sap the
government-wing's weakening influence over the drift of
Polish politics, he said.</p>
<p>At the end of March, Mr. Walesa inserted his own man as
head of Solidarity's main civic committee. The committee
network, which grew out of last June's election, composes the
country's best-organized political machine. Another Walesa
loyalist and his chief promoter, Jaroslow Kaczynski, aims to
use the committees as a springboard for a center-right,
church-oriented political party.</p>
<p>While the party would stay in the democratic fold, it
could also put Poland in the camp of old-style European
nationalists like the winners of the recent election in
Hungary. A Walesa presidency, it seems, would suit it nicely.</p>
<p>The Solidarity newspaper that sides with the government
took a sample last week of public opinion on Mr. Walesa's
ambitions. Those in favor supported his pledge to speed
democracy and slow the government's austerity plan. Those
opposed called him authoritarian and capricious. The paper,
Gazeta Wyborcza, ran a picture of Mr. Walesa standing with a
hand in his coat, looking Napoleonic, but its jibes aren't
likely to cramp his style.</p>
<p>No one expects Mr. Jaruzelski to hang on until his term
expires in 1995; the general is tired. With national
elections due in a year or sooner, the government would like
to see him stay remain in office until Poland is on its way
to capitalism. By then, Mr. Mazowiecki might be poised to
take his place.</p>
<p>But in the meantime, the general might not endure an
insult -- a call at Solidarity's congress, for instance, that
he be ousted. Mr. Jaruzelski might take that as a cue to
retire, and Mr. Walesa could then ascend to the palace.</p>
