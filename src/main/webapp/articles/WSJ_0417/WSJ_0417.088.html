	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- The World Bank approved a $400 million loan
to Yugoslavia to help the country adopt market-related
reforms and expand imports, bank officials said.
   The bank said the Yugoslavian government will use the
credit to promote private-sector initiatives, seek to correct
price distortions in its economy, and "improve the allocation
and use of resources."</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Referring to the country's reform efforts, it added,
"Interest rates will be set at positive levels, a market for
foreign exchange will be established and foreign-trade and
domestic pricing regimes will be liberalized."</p>
<p>The bank also is expected to approve a $200 million credit
to Hungary by midyear. The International Monetary Fund
previously approved a $598 million loan to Yugoslavia and a
$206 million loan to Hungary.</p>
<p>The World Bank's loan to Yugoslavia, to be repaid in 15
years, will carry a variable interest rate, currently 7.75%.</p>
