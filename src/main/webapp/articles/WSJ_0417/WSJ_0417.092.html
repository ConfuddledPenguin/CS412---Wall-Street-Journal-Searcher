	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Metromedia Co., the closely held partnership
controlled by billionaire John W. Kluge, said it formed the
Kluge & Co. division to succeed Kluge Subotnick Perkowski, a
now-dissolved leveraged buy-out firm.
   The new operation is a merger-and-acquisitions advisory
group, Metromedia said. It will focus on Metromedia's
investment portfolio and seek out acquisitions beyond
Metromedia's core businesses, the company said.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Metromedia owns, among other things, telecommunications,
robotic-painting and computer-software operations. It also
holds a majority interest in Orion Pictures.</p>
