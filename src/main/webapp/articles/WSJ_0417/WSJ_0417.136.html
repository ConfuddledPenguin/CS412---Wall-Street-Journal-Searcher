	<p class="article-leader">McLEAN, Va. -- Iverson Technology Corp. said it will
report lower sales and a loss for the first quarter of 1990,
resulting from a business slowdown related to the "thawing of
the Cold War." Second-quarter sales are expected to
"significantly" exceed those of the first quarter.
   During the 1989 first quarter, Iverson had net income of
$92,000, or two cents a share, on revenue of $11.2 million.
The company, which designs computers and computer security
systems, has reduced the number of its employees. And it is
expanding sales of commercial computers to government
agencies not involved in defense or security.</p>
