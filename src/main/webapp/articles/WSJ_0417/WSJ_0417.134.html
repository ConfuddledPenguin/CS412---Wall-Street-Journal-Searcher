	<p class="article-leader">Struggling Financial Corp. of Santa Barbara posted a wider
loss for the fourth quarter of $37.9 million, or $6.28 a
share, after taking write-downs and increasing reserves
associated with new federal thrift capital requirements. In
the year earlier, the company had a loss of $9.5 million, or
$1.57 a share.
   The Santa Barbara, Calif., thrift holding concern also
disclosed that it had fired its auditor, Deloitte & Touche,
over a wide range of disagreements including an auditor's
report questioning the "adequacy of the company's system of
internal controls." The auditing concern couldn't be reached
for comment.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>For the year, Financial Corp. had a loss of $60.3 million,
or $10.01 a share, compared with a loss of $7.1 million, or
$1.24 a share, for 1988.</p>
<p>Financial Corp., which is under regulatory orders
prohibiting it from making new loans, said the 1989 loss
reflected a write-down of about $12.1 million on the value of
preferred stock of a subsidiary and a write-down of $10.1
million of goodwill. The thrift said it also took reserves of
$12.3 million to cover write-downs associated with its
corporate bond portfolio.</p>
