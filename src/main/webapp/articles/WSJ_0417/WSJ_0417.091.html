	<p class="article-leader">In the seven years since Portland, Ore., plumber Gary
Hansen was elected to a regional board that oversees
landfills, he has weathered occasional controversy. A
decision to haul trash 140 miles through the Columbia Gorge
upset some people. But Mr. Hansen says nothing has excited
constituents more than his diaper abatement proposal.
   Across the nation, in fact, disposable diapers make a
tempting environmental target. Though they're usually
estimated to comprise less than 2% of the load at U.S. dump
sites, they stick out as symbols of a wasteful age. In this
week of elegies to Earth, the little one's loincloth ranks
among the mainstays of modern life that we're told need
changing.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>But in picking this fight, is the green movement risking a
break with its young-adult loyalists of baby-bearing bent?
Mr. Hansen doesn't think so. The service-district board
Thursday passed his resolution to "encourage" new parents to
choose traditional cloth diapers and producers of disposables
to draw up special collection procedures so their used goods
can be turned into compost for the local Christmas-tree crop.</p>
<p>Yet the advisory nature of the Hansen measure reflects the
limits on anti-disposable action across the country.
Nebraska's gone as far as any state, including diapers on a
laundry list of products it may require to be sold in
"biodegradable" form using cornstarch (you can surmise that
ecology wasn't what was driving that legislation). But the
ban on existing items wouldn't be triggered unless the state
environmental czars report in late 1992 that alternatives are
available at comparable price and quality.</p>
<p>In Vermont, Gov. Madeleine Kunin laid a stork's egg in a
bid to outlaw disposables. Even some environmentalist allies,
sensing it best to crawl before taking a big step, sang her
baby to sleep. Wisconsin greens thought they'd found a middle
ground in a penny-per-diaper tax on disposables. But
Kimberly-Clark Corp., whose Huggies is the No. 1 brand of
disposables, drummed up phone calls by young parents. Reports
vary on how the calls split, but both sides agree there were
lots and the Legislature settled for passing minor incentives
for use of cloth.</p>
<p>Does the thirty-something generation insist, in this case,
on being pampered even if it means some ground raising? Three
out of five young parents in one survey for industry said
they'd have great difficulty doing without throwaway toddler
togs. Some with infants say the disposables, because they're
more absorbent, are especially helpful during the early
months or when a baby is sleeping.</p>
<p>Evidently, however, a potent minority thinks the old ways
are best. One market indicator of this is a resurgence of
diaper services, especially to serve the affluent young in
urban centers. But despite considerable recent publicity,
these outfits aren't even a blip on the screen of Bonita
Austin, who analyzes the industry for the securities firm
Wertheim Schroeder & Co. Disposables hold more than 85% of
the market, and Ms. Austin says their flat sales are more a
function of birth.</p>
<p>Some who use disposables say they feel guilty, likely
because of the popular notion that a convenience-crazed
society is overflowing the landfills. Certainly some crowded
areas have trouble finding nearby resting places for garbage,
but a University of Arizona specialist, William Rathje,
questioned the trash-crisis consensus in a keeper article in
the December 1989 issue of Atlantic Monthly. Meanwhile,
Robert Samuelson, another independent thinker, has been
calling foes of disposables all wet in his Newsweek column.</p>
<p>A market solution to garbage would insist that those who
generate it should pay the full and true cost of disposing of
it, from pickup through transport to land acquisition (and
proper containment) for burial. Gradually, we're getting
there. But that is not enough for the environmentos. Some of
them argue -- and disinterested analysts seem to dispute --
that diapers at the dump pose a special problem because of
fecal matter. Better alert the pet-owner lobby to this]</p>
<p>Once beyond the usual shrapnel of scary figures (how do we
know it takes a disposable diaper 500 years to decompose?),
the basic arsenal of the green guerrillas is apparent: This
is a conspicuous and bulky consumer good -- although it's
been halved in size since introduced 25 years ago -- that
conscientious people just don't need. Low-tech can serve as
well, if we'll take the time and trouble that mama used to.
(Presumably tampons made of similar material are exempt.)</p>
<p>Of course, the old ways have their costs: Power plants to
superheat the water to wash cloth diapers, for example,
though ironically, detergent advances may allow cold water to
suffice. And paper, such as in telephone directories or
newspapers, is a much bigger component of the nation's
garbage. Eric Mood, an environmental engineer at Yale's
School of Public Health and a skeptic of the diaper fuss,
says, "We may find there's more of a problem with the New
York Times, particularly the Sunday edition." He says the
London Sunday Times gives him just as much copy with half the
paper, and suggests limits on advertising.</p>
<p>Jeanne Wirka of the Environmental Action Foundation
responds that newspapers and other big trash sources have
recycling possibilities that diapers don't. Yet other greens,
and the business sector that works to placate or profit by
them, are aiming at that kind of diversion for diapers
instead of a ban. Procter & Gamble, the biggest producer, has
a pilot effort under way in Seattle.</p>
<p>Some writers have noticed that class enters into this
issue. Portland's Mr. Hansen brings that home when, in
discussing ways to induce a shift from disposables, he notes
that the public-housing authority would be a good place to
begin a program. Almost all of its tenant mothers, he says,
use disposables; because of all their troubles, he suggests,
they "are not good at calling ahead to a diaper service."
Environmentalism is hardly limited to the rich these days,
and Mr. Hansen sounds compassionate to a fault, but anyone
attacking use patterns must consider the sociology. And while
we're on the poor, let's not forget the elderly: About 3% of
"diapers" go to incontinent adults, a growing market.</p>
<p>One busy battleground is at child-care centers. Some of
them bar cloth-diapered charges, and lawmakers are aiming to
stop that. In Maine, however, it was the state that did the
barring, supposedly for health reasons. But legislators just
rescinded the restriction. Now parents will choose among
day-care policies.</p>
<p>With nearly half the states having dabbled in disposable
diapers already, the political salience of the issue is
spreading. An indirect test may come in Portland on May 15,
when our friend Mr. Hansen seeks an open county commission
seat.</p>
