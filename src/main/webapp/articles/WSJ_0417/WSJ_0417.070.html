	<p class="article-leader">BOSTON -- Bank of New England Corp. will set up a new
entity to take over much of its troubled real estate assets,
according to banking industry officials.
   While details of the plan remain sketchy, the officials
said it could resemble so-called good bank/bad bank programs
set up in recent years by Mellon Bank Corp. and other banking
companies. Bank of New England's new entity is likely to take
on at least $1 billion of the roughly $3.2 billion in assets
that were classified as nonperforming or as potential
problems at Dec. 31.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Steven Wheeler will be named to head Bank of New England's
program, the officials said. Mr. Wheeler, 43 years old, is
former co-head of Morgan Stanley & Co.'s Morgan Stanley
Realty unit. For about the past year he has run a financial
consulting firm in Boston specializing in restructuring of
real estate loans.</p>
<p>A Bank of New England spokesman declined to comment on the
reported plan. But an announcement could come this week, when
Bank of New England Chairman Lawrence Fish is expected to
outline the company's strategy for recovering from the $1.1
billion loss it suffered last year and for working off its
troubled loans.</p>
<p>The officials said the final shape of the new entity
remains to be determined. It could simply be an
administrative division within the existing bank, devoted to
handling bad assets. But the officials said Bank of New
England hopes to be able to raise funds from outside
investors to set up a separately capitalized unit akin to
Mellon's Grant Street National Bank.</p>
<p>By setting up such a "bad bank" -- also known, within the
industry, as a "collecting bank" -- Bank of New England would
be able to remove the troubled assets from its balance sheet.
That would improve the financial health of the original bank,
and presumably enable it to attract deposits at lower rates.</p>
<p>But that approach would depend on how much investor
appetite there is for the assets -- mainly in New England
commercial real estate -- that the entity would have to
offer. With hundreds of billions of dollars in real estate
assets from insolvent thrift institutions expected to be sold
by the U.S. government in the next few years, there will be
plenty of competition for investors' attention.</p>
<p>To be sure, the thrift industry properties are
concentrated primarily in the Southwest. But Bank of New
England will also have to deal with investor worries about
the clouded outlook for the New England economy.</p>
<p>William Bahrenburg Jr., chairman of Morgan Stanley Realty
and a former colleague of Mr. Wheeler, said Mr. Wheeler's
broad background in real estate and finance is likely to come
in useful in his new post. Mr. Wheeler has worked in Morgan
Stanley's securities and corporate finance divisions.
According to Mr. Bahrenburg, Mr. Wheeler "was very much
involved" in several "significant corporate restructurings,"
including one at May Department Stores Co. in 1988.</p>
<p>Mr. Wheeler was president of First Winthrop Corp., a
Boston-based real estate syndication and investment firm,
during the mid-1980s. Mr. Wheeler and Mr. Fish, who was then
an executive with Bank of Boston Corp., became acquainted
during that period and got to be "squash buddies," Mr.
Bahrenburg said.</p>
<p>Mr. Wheeler's operation at Bank of New England will work
in tandem with the bank's controlled loan division, which is
in charge of problem loans. Officials at Bank of New England
have indicated that division is being expanded, despite sharp
cutbacks in staffing elsewhere in the company. Richard
Stover, a former officer of Mellon Bank's Grant Street unit
who joined Bank of New England late last year, is expected to
head the expanded division.</p>
<p>Whatever plans Mr. Wheeler and Mr. Fish develop for
separating the bad assets from the good will have to be
approved by federal regulators, who are closely monitoring
Bank of New England's operations. Thomas Cimeno, senior vice
president for bank supervision at the Federal Reserve Bank of
Boston, acknowledged that Bank of New England has discussed
the general concept of segregating bad assets. But he said
the agency has yet to take a formal position on any plan by
the bank.</p>
<p>Bank of New England currently has about $25 billion in
total assets, down from more than $31 billion before its
massive loan problems became apparent late last year.</p>
<p>In composite trading yesterday on the New York Stock
Exchange, Bank of New England closed at $3.75, down 12.5
cents.</p>
