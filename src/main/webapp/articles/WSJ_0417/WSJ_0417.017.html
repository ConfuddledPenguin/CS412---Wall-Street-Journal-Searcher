	<h3>Lawyers' and Journalists' Groups Have No Plans for Similar Studies</h3>

	<p class="article-leader">Even the most mild-mannered corporate employees may
sometimes have a few choice names for their internal
auditors.
   Now, with all the thoroughness of the profession, an
auditors' trade group has compiled a list of the 180 insults
that auditors dislike most -- names such as "auditor weenie,"
"corporate goon" and -- getting personal -- "scum of the
earth."</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The study ventures that the insults, compiled from a
survey of auditors as part of a 137-page report on "Roles and
Relationships in Internal Auditing," "reveal tension between
{auditors} and others."</p>
<p>The Institute of Internal Auditors commissioned the report
to assess the profession's standing -- not so hot -- and see
what can be done about it. Donna Wood, a business professor
at the University of Pittsburgh and a co-author of the study,
suggests that the group's 34,000 members -- who generally
monitor a company's internal financial controls -- might try
calling themselves internal consultants instead.</p>
<p>"Auditors often get called bad names, although I hadn't
heard some of these before," Ms. Wood says. Such as "snake,"
"back stabber" and "SS troops." Or "company sneak" and
"audigator." All made the list, along with many unfit to
print.</p>
<p>Some accountants call the list disclosure overkill. "This
study doesn't help the stature of auditors," says Jonathan
Schiff, an accounting professor at Fairleigh Dickinson
University, Teaneck, N.J. "A few examples would have
sufficed. People who have bad experiences with lawyers,
doctors or salesmen can be just as vicious."</p>
<p>Even Herbert Miller, the institute's current chairman, is
taken aback. "These are wild terms to refer to any
professional group," says Mr. Miller, general auditor of
Williams Cos., Tulsa, Okla. "I don't recall anyone calling
auditors these names."</p>
<p>But Jack McGill, general auditor of Chase Manhattan Bank
and an official with the Altamonte Springs, Fla., trade
group, concedes that people say nasty things about auditors.
"Like, `Auditors enjoy bayoneting the wounded after battle,'
" he says. As for the list, "when we engage researchers, we
don't tell them how to do their report."</p>
<p>Has the list helped the institute sell the study ($15 to
members and $30 to nonmembers)? Not much. The group has sold
just 111 copies since the study appeared last year -- a
fraction of the sales for monographs on such hot topics as
"persuasion and negotiation," "presentation skills" and "the
impact of technology on auditing."</p>
