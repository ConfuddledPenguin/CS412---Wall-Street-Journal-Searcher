	<p class="article-leader">Saudi Arabia warned the Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries to cut excess production to stop the fall
in oil prices.
   In a strongly worded official statement, Hisham Nazer, the
Saudi oil minister, called OPEC's need to discipline output
through "adherence to production ceiling and quotas. . . an
extremely crucial matter."</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Mr. Nazer said the current situation, in which oil prices
have fallen by $2 to $3 a barrel from the start of the month,
not only hurts producers but also weakens chances of a price
recovery in the year's second half. He said Saudi Arabia's
government "is making necessary contacts with other members
of OPEC to bring production back to the determined ceiling"
of 22 million barrels a day.</p>
<p>The kingdom announced separately that Mr. Nazer will meet
today in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, with the oil ministers of
Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates. Kuwait and the UAE are
blamed for much of the two million barrels a day in
overproduction that has pushed OPEC output to an eight-year
high of 24 million barrels a day.</p>
<p>It was known that Saudi Arabia, the world's largest oil
exporter, has been worried by the April price slide. But, in
contrast to other times when over-quota output eroded prices,
the kingdom had remained uncharacteristically quiet until
yesterday.</p>
<p>Whether the Saudi moves will curb OPEC's overproduction or
not, they already have had an impact on world oil markets.
Many markets were closed yesterday in an extended Easter
weekend. But prices rose, if only temporarily, in U.S.
futures and spot markets after the Saudi announcements.</p>
<p>On the New York Mercantile Exchange, West Texas
Intermediate crude for May delivery briefly broke above the
psychologically-important level of $18 a barrel. It then fell
back to settle at $17.85 a barrel, still up seven cents for
the day. June WTI rose 16 cents to $18.67 a barrel on the New
York Mercantile Exchange, and other petroleum futures were
higher for the day.</p>
<p>Not everyone gave the Saudis credit for the rally. "This
was purely a technical bounce; the market clearly was
oversold," said Shahrokh Nikkhah, senior vice president,
futures investments, at Prudential-Bache Securities Inc.</p>
<p>Still, the Saudi announcements contributed further to a
theory held by a number of industry officials that
$15-a-barrel oil is the trigger for OPEC action when oil
prices are falling. Once certain prices threaten to drop
through that level, leading producers begin taking steps to
stop the slide, the theory holds.</p>
<p>A premium crude such as West Texas Intermediate still is
well above $15. But the average of the OPEC basket of seven
crudes fell to around $15.30 late last week. This is the
basket that OPEC uses to measure against its targeted minimum
reference price of $18 a barrel. Significantly, too, spot
prices of Dubai, an important Middle East crude produced in
the United Arab Emirates, have neared $14 a barrel in recent
days.</p>
<p>More people than the Saudi oil minister are alarmed by the
declines, of course. Several other ministers -- including
Sadek Boussena of Algeria, acting president of OPEC -- have
suggested that an emergency ministerial meeting might be
necessary if prices continued to fall.</p>
<p>But such a special meeting is doubtful because the
ministers already are scheduled to hold their regular midyear
conference May 25. It's understood Middle East producers
don't want to see a special meeting of all the ministers held
before then.</p>
<p>Meantime, most of the oil ministers are stepping up their
contacts with each other, in informal face-to-face meetings
such as the one that will take place in Saudi Arabia today,
and over the telephone. The "telephone dialogues" are needed
to reverse "the present downward trend of prices in the world
market," said Ginandjar Kartasasmita, Indonesia's oil
minister.</p>
