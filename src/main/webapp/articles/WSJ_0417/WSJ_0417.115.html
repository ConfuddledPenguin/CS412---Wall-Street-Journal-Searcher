	<p class="article-leader">Torchmark Corp., Birmingham, Ala., reported that net
income, excluding realized investment gains, rose 13% in the
first quarter due in part to improved margins in insurance
operations and higher investment income.
   Net increased to $57.9 million from $51.1 million.</p>

fight to install its own slate of five independent nominees

$2.5 million, or four cents a share, compared with $492,000,
