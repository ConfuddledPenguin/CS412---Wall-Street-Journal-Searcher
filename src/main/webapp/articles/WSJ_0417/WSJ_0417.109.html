	<p class="article-leader">Swiss Bank Corp., the Basel-based banking giant, selected
Brown Brothers Harriman & Co., a private banking firm based
in New York, as its U.S. securities custodian.
   When foreign banks invest funds in the U.S., "It's
impractical to ship the securities back and forth across the
Atlantic," said Laurence F. Whittemore, a general partner at
Brown Brothers. Foreign banks thus hire U.S. banks to keep
custody of the securities. Swiss Bank said last month that it
was ending its own U.S. securities-custody business.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Brown Brothers also said it was selected by the State of
Alaska Permanent Fund as the global custodian for the pension
fund's international securities portfolio. In this case, Mr.
Whittemore said, the law requires U.S. pension funds to
retain U.S. custodians. Brown Brothers will be custodian for
the pension fund's international portfolio, though it will
act through a network of subcustodians overseas, he said.</p>
