	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- House Budget Committee Chairman Leon Panetta
plans to propose cutting military spending by $11.5 billion
and raising taxes by $13.9 billion to meet the Gramm-Rudman
deficit target of $64 billion in fiscal 1991.
   According to congressional staffers, the panel is to begin
drafting its budget resolution tomorrow and will try to
complete its work on Thursday. Its starting point will be
Rep. Panetta's recommendations, which are being floated
privately on Capitol Hill but won't be officially released
until the drafting session.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The panel's task is to come up with a plan that would
reduce the projected fiscal 1991 deficit of $100.5 billion to
no more than $64 billion. Among other cuts, Mr. Panetta is
expected to suggest trimming projected entitlement programs
such as Medicare by about $4 billion, to cut nonmilitary
discretionary programs by about $1 billion and to save about
$1.4 billion in interest payments on the national debt, aides
said.</p>
<p>The Panetta plan won't just cut, however. It also includes
$5 billion to $6 billion in "initiatives," meaning spending
increases, for such projects as AIDS research, education,
space exploration and ground transportation.</p>
<p>The most contentious number is the reduction in projected
military spending. Aides said the California Democrat intends
to suggest trimming military outlays by $11.5 billion from
the $306.9 billion projected for the year starting Oct. 1.
These reductions are smaller than committee liberals were
hoping for, close to the moderates' wishes, but far larger
than the roughly $3 billion in cuts that President Bush
suggested.</p>
<p>Mr. Panetta may try to placate the liberals on his panel
by recommending deeper cuts in military spending authority,
which is a separate fiscal category from outlays.</p>
<p>Reducing outlays -- the actual cash spent in a given year
-- is aimed at avoiding across-the-board spending cuts this
fall if the Gramm-Rudman deficit target isn't met. Cuts in
spending authority, akin to the balance in the Pentagon's
checkbook, would yield lower outlays in future years.</p>
<p>In the Senate, Budget Committee Democrats have had trouble
agreeing on a defense number. Committee Chairman James Sasser
(D., Tenn.) recently proposed a $15.2 billion reduction in
outlays for fiscal 1991. But some other committee Democrats
aren't willing to go that low. Some are still waiting for
cues from Sen. Sam Nunn (D., Ga.), chairman of the Armed
Services Committee.</p>
<p>The $13.9 billion in tax increases is the amount that Mr.
Panetta contends President Bush has recommended in his own
budget. The president himself lists that number as closer to
$9 billion. In addition, the Panetta plan is likely to
include about $4.5 billion in fees and collections that he
doesn't classify as tax increases although Republican critics
surely will.</p>
<p>In any case, the Panetta plan isn't expected to suggest
any specific ways to raise taxes and will leave that decision
to the House Ways and Means Committee.</p>
<p>Congress's budget resolution is the nonbinding blueprint
for fiscal legislation. The president doesn't sign the
measure, but his position on it is often pivotal to the
success of the legislation that comes along later to carry
out its instructions. Few if any Republicans are likely to
back Mr. Panetta's budget resolution, which can serve, at
best, only as a starting point for negotiations with the
White House.</p>
