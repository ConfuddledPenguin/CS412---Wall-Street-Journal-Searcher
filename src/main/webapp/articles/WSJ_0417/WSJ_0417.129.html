	<p class="article-leader">Pittston Co., Greenwich, Conn., reduced its first-quarter
loss estimate to 27 cents a share from 35 cents, citing
strong results in March.
   The coal, security and transportation concern had 1989
first-quarter profit of $15 million, or 40 cents a share,
including a credit of $4 million, or 11 cents a share, from a
tax-loss carry-forward.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The latest month's performance showed a turnaround from
heavy losses in the first two months of 1990, the company
said. Pittston noted an especially strong showing by its
Brink's and Brink's Home Security operations, healthy
American Eagle and Pyxis coal profit centers, and a $1.3
million gain on a small sale of reserves in its coal group.
Pittson also said its Burlington Air Express unit is
benefiting from cost-control programs.</p>
<p>The company said final results for the latest quarter will
be released in about a week.</p>
