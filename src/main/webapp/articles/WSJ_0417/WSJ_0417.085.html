	<div class="article-body"><p>Many people worry a lot about whether they've got enough
life insurance, but hardly give disability coverage a second
thought -- especially if their employer has a group
disability plan.</p>
<p>But the chance of becoming disabled for more than three
months is far greater than the chance of dying before
retirement, actuaries say. Accidents, heart attacks,
complicated pregnancies, cancer and even "stress" (which can
translate into alcoholism and mental disorders) all take
their toll on people's ability to carry on with their normal
work lives.</p>
<p>While most employers do provide short-term disability
coverage that pays 100% of salary, things can get tough after
it runs out in three to six months. Many employers'
longer-term group disability plans are difficult to qualify
for, pay little and limit benefit payments to only a few
years. Social Security and state disability payments don't go
very far for formerly well-paid professionals.</p>
<p>The answer may be supplemental coverage. "It's a coverage
that's so much more needed than life insurance, but people
don't buy it," says Michael Murray, a professor of insurance
at Drake University in Des Moines, Iowa.</p>
<p>Though these disability contracts are costly and complex,
there are ways to make the process easier, and new ways to
cut costs significantly.</p>
<p>The first step is to take a look at your group coverage.
Most plans pay 60% of base salary while the employee is
disabled. But since that doesn't include things like bonuses
and profit sharing, the actual benefit may be 40% or less of
an employee's total compensation. In addition, many group
policies don't provide coverage for longer than two to five
years and don't provide for cost-of-living increases.
Benefits are almost always taxable.</p>
<p>Many group plans also have strict definitions of
"disability," which would reduce the chance of qualifying.
Typically, employees are considered disabled only if they
can't perform the "main functions" of their regular
occupations. Some plans are even stricter: After two years,
they consider employees disabled only if they can't perform
any occupation for which they "may be suited by education or
training." The more subjective the criteria, the more control
the employer has over payouts.</p>
<p>Even if your group plan seems adequate, it may make sense
to look into individual policies anyway. In an environment of
mergers and buy-outs, "executives who change jobs, or get
smitten with the entrepreneurial bug" need individual
policies, says Andrew Reid of R&D Insurance Services in Palo
Alto, Calif.</p>
<p>If you decide to buy supplemental coverage, start by
looking for policies that aren't cancellable and guaranteed
renewable, which means that the insurance company can't raise
the premiums or cancel the coverage. Also, look for those
that provide coverage until age 65 or longer.</p>
<p>Next, choose options that tailor the policy to your needs,
says Lawrence Mintzer, president of Mintzer Insurance
Services, an insurance consulting firm in Newton, Mass. The
two most important riders, he says, are a cost-of-living
option, which would increase benefits with inflation, and an
option to increase coverage as income rises -- without a
medical examination.</p>
<p>One of Mr. Mintzer's clients is a patent attorney who
purchased an individual policy with an option to increase
benefits without taking a medical exam. Soon after that, he
had back problems that required surgery. Though he wasn't out
of work long enough to collect disability, his insurability
would have been crippled if he didn't already have the
policy. "It's unlikely that he would have been able to get an
individual policy after this," says Mr. Mintzer.</p>
<p>It's also a good idea to select a policy with a "residual
benefit" option. This pays a partial benefit that would
supplement your income if you could return to work, but were
unable to earn as much as you had been making before becoming
disabled.</p>
<p>How much supplemental coverage you need depends on several
factors, including the other resources you have to fall back
on -- things like retirement savings plans, investment income
and income from a working spouse. Keep in mind that benefits
from individual disability policies will go further than
those from company-paid plans because they are tax-free.</p>
<p>Insurance agents will work with you to arrive at an
appropriate supplemental amount. But insurers make it
difficult to get coverage for more than 70% of one's salary,
since they feel that paying more would encourage malingerers.</p>
<p>The first thing they look at is the benefit limit in an
employee's group policy. Consider an executive with a base
salary of $100,000 and a bonus of $50,000. Assuming her group
plan pays a maximum benefit equal to 60% of base pay, she
would receive $5,000 a month from it. In her case, an issuer
might write a policy that would pay $2,440 a month, which
combined with the group coverage would bring the total
monthly benefit to $7,440, or 60% of the executive's total
compensation.</p>
<p>Peace of mind like that doesn't come cheap, however.
Fortunately, there are ways to lower premiums.</p>
<p>Most insurers offer discounts of 10% to 15% for people who
don't smoke. Choosing a longer period before receiving
benefits also will save money. If you're coordinating
coverage with your group plan, you might choose to wait as
long as one to two years.</p>
<p>Some companies now offer "adjustable-rate disability
insurance," which costs less than ordinary "level premium"
policies in the early years. With adjustable-rate policies,
the premium increases 8% to 10% a year until it reaches the
level-premium rate in seven years or more. At that time, it
can be converted to a level-premium policy.</p>
<p>Another way to lower premiums is to get a policy from one
of the few mutual insurance companies that pay dividends on
disability insurance. (A mutual insurance company, unlike a
publicly traded one that distributes dividends to
stockholders, distributes its excess earnings in the form of
dividends to policy holders.)</p>
<p>These dividends may reduce premiums significantly.
Northwestern Mutual Life Insurance Co., Milwaukee, for
example, reduces premiums by 10% on policies that have been
held for two years, and can make subsequent reductions of 1%
a year.</p>
<p>Saving money also depends on not buying coverage you don't
need. One of the most popular options is the "own-occupation"
rider. This will pay full benefits if you can't perform your
stated occupation, but are still able to work at a related,
though lower-paying job. For example, a surgeon who cannot
perform surgery could work as a general practitioner and
still receive full benefits.</p>
<p>That sounds good, but it may not be worth the extra cost
for most white-collar professionals, says Richard Kirtland,
director of marketing at General American Life Insurance Co.,
St. Louis. The residual rider would probably cover the loss
of income, he says. The own-occupation rider is "really a
marketing-driven thing."</p>

guarnateed renewable and noncancelable until age 65. These
policies also include cost-of-living benefit increases, pay
benefits if insured returns to work but suffers a drop in
income, give policyholders the right to increase benefits
later without a medical exam.</p>
