	<p class="article-leader">Readers feeling the bite fo this week's tax deadline may
be interested to know that the Tax Foundation has come up
with an ingenious way to quantify their pain. The
Washington-based group has calculated the number of days in
the working year the average American must work to pay off
the government. This year, Tax Freedom Day comes on May 5 --
that is, the average American will work 125 days, the
equivalent of Jan. 1 to May 5, before he is free of all
federal, state, and local tax obligations. And Tax Freedom
Day comes later every year; you have to go as far back as
1965 to find the time when Tax Freedom Day coincided with our
current tax deadline, April 15.
   For masochists, the Tax Foundation has gone an additional
step and listed Tax Freedom Days for individual states.
Citizens of the District of Columbia and New York will find
their suspicions confirmed; with the Tax Freedom Dates of May
23, these spots earn first and second place for inflicting
the highest average of federal, state, and local taxes on
their citizens. By the Tax Foundation count, New York lags
the District of Columbia by less than a minute; Gov. Mario
Cuomo's plan to postpone a tax cut means the Empire state may
soon nose into first place. Envy the lucky New Hampshireite,
who completes his obligation as early as April 19.</p>
