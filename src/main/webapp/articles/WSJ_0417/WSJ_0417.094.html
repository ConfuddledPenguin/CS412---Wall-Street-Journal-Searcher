	<p class="article-leader">PORTLAND, Ore. -- Benj. Franklin Federal Savings & Loan
Associationd said write-offs associated with new federal
capital requirements resulted in a loss of $377.1 million for
1989. The loss had been anticipated under a previously
announced restructuring program.
   The ailing thrift was placed into conservatorship of the
Resolution Trust Corp. in February but continues retail
operations while the RTC negotiates a resolution of its
problems. Benj. Franklin said its loss resulted largely from
the write-off of $282.7 million of good will accumulated from
previous acquisitions.</p>
