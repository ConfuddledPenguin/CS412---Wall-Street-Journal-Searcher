	<p class="article-leader">Canonie Environmental Services Corp., Porter, Ind., said
it expects to report a loss of about 10 to 12 cents a share
for its fourth quarter ended Feb. 28.
   In the year-earlier period, the hazardous-waste management
concern had net income of $731,000, or 13 cents a share, on
revenue of $9 million.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Regarding the deficit for the latest period, the company
cited additional expenses associated with a major project,
"continued losses" in its laboratory operation, and employee
severance costs.</p>
<p>The quarterly loss will trim Canonie's earnings for fiscal
1990 to about eight to 10 cents a share, the company said. In
fiscal 1989, Canonie earned $5.4 million, or 96 cents a
share, on revenue of $48 million.</p>
