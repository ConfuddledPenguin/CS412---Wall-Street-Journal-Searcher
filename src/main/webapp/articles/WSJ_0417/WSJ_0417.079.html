	<p class="article-leader">BALTIMORE -- New research found that large daily doses of
ibuprofen, a commonly used pain relief product, can cause
serious kidney damage for those people who already have mild
kidney problems.
   A report of the research, published in the current issue
of the Annals of Internal Medicine, suggests that
nonprescription versions of ibuprofen should contain specific
warnings about the kidney risk.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>But makers of the ibuprofen product brands, which include
Advil, Nuprin and Motrin IB, sharply criticized the research,
arguing that the products already contain adequate warnings.</p>
<p>In the study, researchers at Johns Hopkins University
School of Medicine administered the equivalent of about 12
ibuprofen pills a day for eight days to 12 women with
chronic, but mild, kidney problems. After at least eight
days, all the women showed signs of kidney failure. Their
problem was reversed when the drug's use was stopped.</p>
<p>In New York, American Home Products Corp., which makes
Advil, said the study "doesn't reflect the true safety record
of nonprescription ibuprofen." The company said the product's
label already warns users to consult with doctors before
using the drug if they are under doctors' care, or if they
experience additional symptoms after taking the drug.</p>
<p>Officials at Bristol-Myers Squibb Corp., which sells
Nuprin, and at Upjohn Co., which sells Motrin IB, took
similar positions. Ibuprofen was approved for
over-the-counter sale in 1983.</p>
