	<p class="article-leader">NEW HAVEN, Conn. -- The gloss is off New Haven's Science
Park, which promised to help revive this aging city.
   Since the park opened in 1983, it has welcomed more than
170 start-ups. About 100 of those businesses survive,
providing about 1,200 jobs. The park also has created a core
of new technology businesses in a city long ravaged by
economic decline and corporate flight. Nevertheless, the $50
million project is losing more than $1 million a year, and
it's losing support.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The park's four sponsors -- the state of Connecticut, the
city of New Haven, Yale University and Olin Corp., a chemical
maker based in nearby Stamford -- provided the capital and
land for the park. Most of the sponsors say they don't want
to invest much more, because the park hasn't revitalized its
inner-city neighborhood or provided jobs for large numbers of
unemployed workers.</p>
<p>"The results the sponsors expected haven't materialized,"
says Benno Schmidt Jr., president of Yale. With the
university hard pressed to finance its own needs, "we don't
want to be seen as the only supporters of the park," he says.</p>
<p>William Ginsberg, chief executive officer of Science Park
Development Corp., the not-for-profit developer of the park,
says: "Achieving our ambitious, original goals is still very
much within our reach." But he concedes that the existing
commitments aren't enough. "We need more time from our
lenders, more capital from the state and more scientific
interaction with Yale to reach the goals we set out to
achieve," he says.</p>
<p>The experience of New Haven's park exemplifies the
predicament that many of the nation's 110 or so science and
technology parks face today. Once touted as quick fixes for
economically troubled communities, the parks have been slow
in delivering the promised cures. Now, many of their backers
-- state and local governments, universities and corporations
-- are themselves in financial trouble.</p>
<p>The disillusionment threatens the growth -- and even
existence -- of projects such as New Haven's Science Park.
"The disillusionment is spreading," says Bruce Merrifield, a
professor of management at the University of Pennsylvania's
Wharton School.</p>
<p>Under pressure to reduce budgets, every level of
government is cutting back support for these centers, which
have been a vital source of small-business development by
providing low-cost space and a plethora of inexpensive
services. Disenchanted sponsors "are selectively starving the
very centers of innovation we need to be competitive
globally," according to Mr. Merrifield.</p>
<p>The Science Park here was aggressively promoted as the
solution to local joblessness, says Douglas Rae, chief
administrative officer for this city of 126,000. But most of
the 1,200 new jobs have been filled by professionals and
skilled high-technology workers, instead of by local workers,
many of whom are minorities and unskilled. The park, formerly
home to an Olin manufacturing complex with more than 10,000
industrial and research employees, "hasn't solved" the area's
unemployment problem, Mr. Rae says.</p>
<p>Officials in Connecticut, which suffered a deficit of more
than $220 million last year on a $7 billion budget, say the
park can't play as large a role in its economic-development
strategy as in the past. "It's worked well on the incubator
side, but no one is entirely satisfied with its impact on New
Haven's economy," says Stephen Heintz, Connecticut's
commissioner of economic development. "We have to begin
exploring a variety of development strategies for faster
solutions."</p>
<p>If the major sponsors back away, "the ability of the park
to deliver the services entrepreneurs need is sure to be
affected," says George Leka, president of Jule Inc., a maker
of biomedical products and a tenant of Science Park.</p>
<p>Development experts say that New Haven's Science Park is a
victim of planners' inability to understand the nature of
technology-based development. "Technology parks are a
long-term building process," contends Tripp Peake, a managing
partner of Science Park Associates, a business development
consultant.</p>
<p>"Too many planners expected the parks to be instant
cure-alls for economic ills," says Ian MacMillan, executive
director of the University of Pennsylvania's Sol C. Snyder
Entrepreneurial Center. "They got disillusioned when the
parks didn't provide quick fixes."</p>
<p>Initially, New Haven's Science Park received extensive
support. Olin contributed existing buildings and the park's
40-acre location. The state and the city provided over $7
million in grants and loans. Yale chipped in another $2.5
million.</p>
<p>From the very beginning, the park proved extremely
successful in attracting and supporting small businesses and
small units of big companies, including Eastman Kodak Co.'s
International Biotechnologies unit. and supercomputer maker
Visionary Systems Inc., a spinoff of ITT Corp.'s Advanced
Technologies Center.</p>
<p>But the park has failed to attract big-business tenants
that can employ large numbers of local workers and provide
the fledgling space with some stability. It also has failed
to persuade big Connecticut venture capital firms to finance
the growth and expansion of the park's fast-growing tenants.
Complains Mr. Leka of Jule: "We haven't gotten the support of
local venture capitalists."</p>
<p>Mr. Ginsberg contends that the park has succeeded as an
incubator. "We've been more successful than most other
projects like this," he says. But to achieve its broader
goals, it needs more capital and more support from its
sponsors, he says.</p>
<p>The capital is needed to improve the infrastructure so the
park can attract major companies. "We also need to work more
closely with Yale to sell the park to the big technology
concerns," he adds.</p>
