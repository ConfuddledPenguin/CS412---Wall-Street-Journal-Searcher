	<p class="article-leader">PHOENIX, Ariz. -- Circle K Corp. disclosed details of a
preliminary accord with senior creditors and its largest
shareholder, engineered earlier this month to stave off
bankruptcy-law proceedings.
   The convenience-store operator said it plans swap offers
for $510 million face amount of its debt outstanding, issuing
new senior subordinated convertible debentures "in a
principal amount that approximates the market value of the
outstanding debt securities."</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The new debentures would be convertible into "at least a
majority of the company's fully diluted common equity,"
Circle K said. Debt holders also would be given the option to
receive cash for their securities.</p>
<p>If holders of all $510 million of debt opted to take cash,
Circle K would need to pay out about $100 million, given that
the debentures have a current market value of between 18
cents and 20 cents on the dollar. Circle K said its largest
shareholder, American Financial Corp., has issued a
conditional standby commitment to buy as much as $100 million
market value of the debentures. American Financial,
controlled by Cincinnati financier Carl Lindner, holds a 38%
stake in Circle K and is a substantial creditor. Mr. Lindner
also is a longtime business associate of Karl Eller, Circle
K's chairman.</p>
<p>Debt issues included in the swap would be Circle K's 12
3/4% senior subordinated debentures due 1997, 7 1/4%
convertible subordinated debentures due 2006, 8 1/4%
convertible subordinated debentures due 2005, 13% junior
subordinated debentures due 1997, and closely held
subordinated notes.</p>
<p>The swap offer probably would be conditioned on at least
90% of the debt securities outstanding being swapped or
purchased, Circle K said. Exact terms of the proposed swap
offer haven't been fully determined, and Circle K said it
plans to file swap offer materials with the Securities and
Exchange Commission prior to May 15.</p>
<p>As part of the agreement Circle K reached with senior
creditors earlier this month, the company placed a
seven-month moratorium on debt and interest payments,
narrowly averting default on part of its debt. Yesterday,
Circle K said that it didn't pay the $7.9 million interest
due on the $125 million principal amount of 12 3/4% senior
subordinated debentures.</p>
<p>"While interest payments are not permitted on the
subordinated debt, the company believes it will have
sufficient cash liquidity for its trade obligations during
the course of the financial restructuring," Circle K added.</p>
<p>Prior to the announcement of the proposed restructuring,
Circle K had said that it was considering filing for
protection from creditors under Chapter 11 of the federal
Bankruptcy Code. Circle K has found itself buckling under a
heavy load of high-yield debt resulting from rapid expansion.
Under Mr. Eller's management, the once-sleepy chain grew to
4,700 outlets at Dec. 31 from 1,300 stores in 1983.</p>
<p>The restructuring plan is conditional on all sides signing
a definitive standstill agreement that would hold through the
earlier of Oct. 31 or completion of the financial
rearrangements.</p>
<p>In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday,
Circle K shares closed at $1.625, off 25 cents.</p>
