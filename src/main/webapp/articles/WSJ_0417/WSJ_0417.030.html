	<p class="article-leader">The State Department is reporting to Congress today on the
advisability of rejoining UNESCO, the United Nations cultural
organization from which the U.S. and Britain withdrew in
1984. The following is an excerpt from the report's
conclusion:</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>It is obvious that the time is not yet ripe to reopen the
question of renewing United States membership in UNESCO.
United States strategy since our withdrawal has been clear
and consistent -- we have sought to work actively from
outside the organization with those who share our objective
of restoring UNESCO as a well-run international organization
with an effective program of work, limited to its fields of
competence. While United States non-membership has spurred
some reform activity at UNESCO, there is much more that needs
to be accomplished in order for UNESCO to be considered as
the organization intended by its founders. The recently
announced decision of the United Kingdom not to seek re-entry
demonstrates that their thinking on the subject remains
essentially the same as ours.</p>
<p>A renewal of United States membership at this time would
require that we accept promises of change in lieu of real
reform. . . . The following issues are illustrative of our
continuing concerns with respect to activities at UNESCO:</p>
<p>Communications. We remain deeply concerned about the
palpable similarities which exist between the current text on
communications and those which preceded it over the last
fifteen years. Despite the additional references which have
been inserted regarding freedom and independence of the
press, it is undeniable that the critical elements to which
the United States most strongly objected in the past are
still present. The program remains one in which freedom of
the press and freedom of expression are "balanced" against
the desires of governments to control the flow of information
to and from their citizens. Moreover, the so-called New World
Information and Communication Order is still perceived by
Third World UNESCO delegates as an "article of faith" with
them and as "a continuous and evolving process."</p>
<p>The PLO. In UNESCO, resolutions heavily biased against
Israel, and often based on false accusations, have continued
to be adopted up to the present. Although the PLO membership
question has been deferred until 1991, the PLO observer will
be able to make direct requests for UNESCO participation
program assistance, thereby possibly gaining increased
control of aid flows to people in the occupied territories.
The Director General's recent appointment in UNESCO of a
high-level "Coordinator for Cooperation with Palestine" also
gives the PLO a special status in UNESCO's program of work
exceeding that of any member state.</p>
<p>Management and personnel. Despite the recommendations
received from two independent consulting groups (the
Hammarskjold Commission and the Wilenski Panel) which urged
that "critical reforms" be instituted "as a matter of
urgency," Director General Mayor has proposed a restructuring
plan which has generated enormous controversy at UNESCO and
plunged the organization into its worst crisis since the
departure of the United States, the United Kingdom, and
Singapore. Rather than the cuts which the Director General
had led us to expect, his proposal would create, by our
count, some 33 new posts (which could cost as much as $6
million according to one Secretariat estimate). There was no
open recruitment of the persons named to fill any of the
newly-created posts, nor did Director General Mayor consult
with the Executive Board, as required by UNESCO's rules.</p>
<p>Budgetary restraint. There has been no progress at UNESCO
in moving towards the formal establishment of a budgetary
decision-making process which would give adequate weight to
the views of major donors. The Director General himself has
demonstrated a reluctance to propose efficiency measures or
concentration of the program. While he has often indicated
that his hands are tied by the lack of resources at UNESCO,
he has been able to find in every budgetary period
substantial sums for travel, consultants, and a variety of
activities not specifically authorized by the General
Conference. And although the Director General has boasted of
reducing the number of pages in the Medium-Term Plan and
Program and Budget, our concern is that this simply reduces
the amount of information available to member governments.</p>
<p>Decentralization and program concentration. Unesco's newly
adopted program of work retains virtually all the activities
undertaken in the past. The organization's programs remain
diffuse and unfocused. Concentration in a few key areas as
urged by the United States and major donors has eluded the
Director General. Although Director General Mayor has pledged
to increase the portion of his budget spent in the field
instead of at headquarters, it is unclear how he will do
this. His proposal for an across-the-board "decentralization"
of the budget at a fixed percentage without reference to the
content of specific programs represents an abdication of
responsible management rather than a redress for a
long-standing problem at UNESCO.</p>
<p>Finally, the United States must assess what it stands to
gain through renewed membership in UNESCO and what it stands
to lose. Our withdrawal did not alter our policy of strong
support for international cooperation in educational,
scientific and cultural and communication activities. Our
ability to protect important political interests within
UNESCO remains substantial, as evidenced by the deferral of
consideration of the PLO request for membership in UNESCO.
The leverage we retain as a sought-after non-member in some
instances is greater than we would wield simply by being one
vote among 161 others.</p>
<p>Membership in UNESCO would cost the United States about
$50 million annually. Before being able to advocate re-entry,
the President would have to able to assure the United States
Congress and the American taxpayers that this would be money
spent on programs within UNESCO's mandate which bring direct
benefit to mankind. Regrettably, UNESCO at this stage does
not possess the characteristics of a well-managed and focused
organization that would enable the President to give such
assurances.</p>
