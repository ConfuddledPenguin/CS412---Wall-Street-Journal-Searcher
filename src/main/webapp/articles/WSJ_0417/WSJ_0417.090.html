	<p class="article-leader">Michael Gartner's March 15 Viewpoint, "The Scarlet Letter
of Rape: A Courageous Victim Fights Back," stated that Iowans
deemed Nancy Ziegenmeyer (the rape victim) a "hero" for
coming forward with her story. While she is, indeed, heroic,
there are thousands of rape victims who are also heroes for
surviving a violent sexual assault, for rehabilitating
themselves and putting their lives back together without
publicly proclaiming their victimization.
   In a rape, the victim loses control and choice over her
actions. What Mr. Gartner suggests is putting the "control"
concerning the publicizing of names and addresses of rape
victims in the hands of the news media vs. where it belongs
-- with the innocent victim who was violated. Victims who
come forward with their stories choose to do so, and more
power to them. Those who choose to remain silent are no less
heroic.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Often, rape victims are also the sole witnesses to the
violent sexual assault. One must consider the personal safety
of that victim -- if the news media print and broadcast rape
victims' names and addresses, the offender knows exactly
where to go to intimidate, threaten, harass, harm or even
kill that victim.</p>
<p>No two rape victims are alike. To assume that all rape
victims should come forward with their tragic stories, or to
assume that all such victims should want to disclose publicly
their painful stories, is not realistic. The healing process
varies from victim to victim. Many find disclosing their
stories rehabilitating, while others choose to deal with
their tragedy privately. The wishes of both should be
respected.</p>
<p>The "strong sunlight needed to wilt the sour blight of
prejudice" is not forcing humiliating public disclosure of
violent rapes on unwilling victims. The sunlight needed is
public education: that rape is a violent, senseless act
against innocent victims; that it is the offender who should
be blamed rather than the innocent victim.</p>

<p>Mr. Gartner failed to address the most obvious deterrent
to rape -- a .38 revolver or similar concealed heavy-caliber
firearm. If Bobby Lee Smith had been looking down the barrel
of a .38 when he shoved Nancy Ziegenmeyer aside and took her
off to rape her, you can be sure the result would have been
entirely different.</p>
<p>Women as a matter of right should be entitled to carry
concealed firearms and have an absolute right of self-defense
against rape or bodily injury or death by marauding males.
The law, enacted by men, encourages rape. By prohibiting
women from carrying concealed firearms and by not granting
them the absolute right of self-defense it in effect says to
the scum who commit rapes, "Go ahead, help yourself." Rape
flourishes because rapists get away with it, compliments of
the law.</p>

<p>While Mr. Gartner raises many excellent points, I am not
sure that he can fully appreciate the position of a woman who
has been raped. To us men, this act can only seem traumatic.
We can never know the feeling of physical violation that
haunts a woman after rape.</p>
<p>For him to suggest that the press, as a means of public
expression, should openly announce the names of the women who
have undergone this trauma is unreasonable. It took time for
Nancy Ziegenmeyer to confront her rape openly. Shouldn't all
women be afforded the time to do so? Why is it the place of
The Press to make such a decision?</p>
<p>Mr. Gartner does make a good point in suggesting
publication of the names of the rapists. These are the people
who should suffer openly the scorn of the public.</p>

<p>Give me a break] It wasn't really about a poor girl
suffering from a heinous crime. Mr. Gartner is trying to
further the idea that the media has a right to print anything
about anybody.</p>
<p>My view is that the media do not have a right to all
information about everyone; rather, that everyone has a right
to privacy. A person suffering from rape might not want to
share the experience with every stranger in the world. Mr.
Gartner assumes the role of psychiatrist by saying "that the
stigma attached to rape victims won't disappear until
newspapers routinely print names of victims." Perhaps he
should spend an evening watching the movie "Absence of
Malice" for a more realistic perspective about how the media
can affect someone's life.</p>
<p>I not only think Mr. Gartner is wrong, but I also resent
his purported intrusion into the lives of people who want to
be left alone. The recent Supreme Court case of the
journalist who wanted access to the FBI files on every
American is a prime example of the selfishness of some
journalists. Can you imagine having your personal records
printed in the daily news?</p>

<p>I would like to sharpen one of Mr. Gartner's statements:
"The sooner the public realizes that rape is vicious and
rapists are thugs, the sooner we'll be able to get these
terrors off the streets."</p>
<p>I believe women have no trouble at all in realizing the
brutality of rape and how dangerous not only our streets are,
but also our homes. (Most assaults on women occur in their
homes.) Rather, it is we men who need to realize how our
violence is affecting women. Men need to find a way to
confront and hold one another more accountable for our abuse
of women along the entire continuum of violence -- from
murder and rape, to sexual harassment and verbal put-downs,
to more subtle, institutional discrimination against women.</p>
