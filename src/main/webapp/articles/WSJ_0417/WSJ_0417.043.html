	<p class="article-leader">ROWAYTON, Conn. -- Baldwin Technology Corp. plans to
expand its printing-equipment manufacturing operations by
acquiring two subsidiaries of Dyson-Kissner-Moran Corp. for
$44 million.
   The two subsidiaries, Misomex AB of Stockholm and Misomex
of North America Inc., Chicago, manufacture so-called
prepress equipment -- machines that, among other things,
impose images onto printing plates.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The acquisition would expand Baldwin's lines of equipment
for the pressroom -- including presses -- and for post-press
processes, including machines for labeling, inserting,
stacking and bundling, said Kenneth W. Reynolds, Baldwin's
chief financial officer.</p>
<p>For the year ended Dec. 31, 1989, for Misomex AB and Jan.
31, 1990, for Misomex of North America, the companies had
combined net income of more than $4 million on $40 million of
sales. For the six months ended Dec. 31, Baldwin earned $5.3
million, or 32 cents a share, on $83.4 million of sales.</p>
<p>Dyson-Kissner-Moran, a closely held New York investment
firm, recently sold its printing-press business to a
subsidiary of an East German company, said John H.
FitzSimons, DKM's secretary and general counsel. "Misomex is
more valuable to a company like Baldwin, which is in related
businesses," he said. DKM has a number of remaining
interests, including real estate, oil and gas, and insurance.</p>
<p>The transaction is subject to clearance by the Swedish
government and by U.S. regulators.</p>
<p>In American Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday,
Baldwin's shares rose 12.5 cents to close at $8.625.</p>
