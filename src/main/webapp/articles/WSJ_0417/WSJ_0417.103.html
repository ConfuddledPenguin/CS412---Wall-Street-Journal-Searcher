	<p class="article-leader">Man is still trying to communicate with dolphins, but
neither species has reason to sound enthusiasm for last
week's move by the big sellers of tuna in the U.S. Led by
H.J. Heinz Co. (Starkist brand), three canners with a huge
share of the market capitulated to environmentalists who
demanded they quit netting the big tuna that often swim under
the lovable water mammals.
   Greenpeace and its cohorts had launched a boycott of tuna
to protest the deaths of dolphins caught up in the fishing
boats' nets. Heinz, after what it called marketing studies,
said its customers would be willing to pay extra for younger
yellowfin, which don't frolic with dolphins, or for bigger
tuna caught in oceans where the mysterious symbiosis isn't
observed.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>In line with its newfound consciousness, Heinz now wants
the government to put a lid on imported tuna ruled
"dolphin-unsafe." Hmmm. Protectionist the dolphins.</p>
<p>Come to think of it, even without the lid on imports, the
instant consensus among competitors to offer only more costly
tuna might excite some curiosity among the reinvigorated
trustbusters at the Federal Trade Commission. After all, even
consumers who haven't turned green will be laying out the
green.</p>
<p>One group that has more than curiosity at stake is the
U.S. tuna fleet, which mostly sails out of San Diego. It
unloads the bulk of its catch in Puerto Rico and American
Samoa. If fishermen can't find an economic way to make a
living under the new rules -- and their spokesmen say they
may not be able to, given how the loss of nets will cut the
catch in what is already a difficult business -- it's going
to further shrink a fleet that's already diminished by
two-thirds since 1981. How many workers will now suffer at
Heinz's clean hands is a guess.</p>
<p>Many Americans may care more about porpoises than
fishermen. If so, then they especially should realize the
magnitude of progress in tuna-netting practices, gains that
may be stalled or lost by last week's action. Since the
Journal's Roy Harris Jr. detailed the development of
dolphin-sparing tuna techniques in a front-page article 13
years ago, the kill rate has been about halved. Last year the
toll in the U.S.-fished region was under 13,000. Half the
time the boats drop one of their purse-like nets, they kill
none of the average 650 dolphins swept up. The Marine Mammal
Protection Act of 1972, combined with the fact that dolphin
kills only detract from tuna yields, has spurred the U.S. to
remarkable achievements.</p>
<p>In the international marketplace, love for Flipper isn't
universal. Greenpeace is not usually so effective when it
goes calling on Mexico City or Seoul. So now the Pacific
region off the Americas may belong to foreign fishing
vessels, who are likely to kill more dolphins than the San
Diego boats they replace.</p>
<p>If the industry is correct in saying that younger tuna
will now be fished out before they can reproduce, the
agreement will also be bad for the tuna. We might face a
depletion scare such as one that prompted tuna-conservation
controls on the West Coast fleet 20 years ago. Saving the
tuna will come second to saving the dolphin, but it will
come, and kids may then be condemned to cheese sandwiches. We
wonder what cows would think of that.</p>
