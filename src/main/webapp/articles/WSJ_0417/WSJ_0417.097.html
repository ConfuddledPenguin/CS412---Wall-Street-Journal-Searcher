	<p class="article-leader">Congressional liberals continue to demand tax increases,
claiming there's nowhere to cut spending except the Pentagon.
To test the claim, take just one area, say farm subsidies.
Here spending cuts would perform the neat hat trick of
reducing the deficit without higher taxes while lowering food
prices for the poor. So what does Congress do?
   The House agriculture subcommittees are in a feeding
frenzy to see who can bust the budget the most. They've so
far raised the projected five-year cost of the pending farm
bill by $42 billion over President Bush's request, up to a
total of $180 billion.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>That's bad enough, but history teaches that projected
costs of these five-year plans never add up quite right. In
1981, the Agriculture Department said the farm bill would
cost $12 billion over four years. It cost $60 billion. In
1985, Agriculture said the current farm bill would cost $52
billion over five years. It has cost $110 billion -- so far.</p>
<p>One reason the farm lobby can make such massive raids on
the Treasury is that few people realize the full costs.
Farmers tell us that if people knew by how much farm
subsidies raise prices, there would be uprisings at
supermarket checkout lines. Another reason there is no revolt
is that most Americans have come to more or less accept
several myths propounded by the farm lobby:</p>
<p>Without subsidies, the family farm would disappear.</p>
<p>Current subsidy programs compel farmers to increase their
yields rather than control costs. This gives an advantage to
large, wealthy farmers who can afford the huge combines that
allow them to outproduce small farmers. Dennis Avery, a
former government agriculture analyst, says, "Farm programs
have led to an overcapitalization of agriculture with less
actual employment than what it would otherwise have." As it
is, the big growth in farm employment is at the Agriculture
Department, which now has one bureaucrat for every six
full-time farmers.
</p>
<p>Farm programs are designed to help the family farmer.</p>
<p>In fact, most subsidies flow to large corporate farms or
part-time "gentleman" farmers. The USDA counts anyone who
sells more than $1,000 in commodities in a year as a farmer.
The number of full-time farmers has gone up since 1980, and
their average net worth is now more than $1 million. Since
1985, the USDA has spent more than $1 million on each
full-time rice and sugar grower.</p>
<p>Subsidies are available to most farmers, and are
universally supported by those who receive them.</p>
<p>Farm subsidies help only selected growers. Almost half of
U.S. farmers produce meat, vegetables or specialty crops that
receive no federal price supports. The bankruptcy rate of
these farmers is below that of farmers who receive federal
help.</p>
<p>Farm programs are now so generous that even the most
self-reliant farmers have become yoked to them. A 1988 poll
in Iowa found more than one out of four farmers who received
subsidies were in favor of ending all support programs within
five years. GOP Rep. Dick Armey and Democratic Rep. Charles
Schumer have a plan to weed out wealthy recipients of farm
subsidies. They would stop payments of any kind to farmers
who earn $100,000 or more a year. Shifting farm programs from
price supports to welfare payments aimed at needy farmers
could cut the cost of farm subsidies by two-thirds.</p>
<p>So far, this sensible idea is going nowhere in Congress.
We note that several well-off Members of Congress themselves
receive federal farm subsidies. Since 1984, Rep. Charles
Stenholm (D., Texas) has collected between $5,000 and $15,000
a year for producing cotton for which he helped legislate
subsidies on the Cotton, Rice and Sugar Subcommittee. If
executive-branch employees netted such a windfall they would
face immediate investigation by a special prosecutor.
Congress has exempted itself from the conflict-of-interest
provisions of the Ethics in Government Act.</p>
<p>The subsidy lobby's basic calculation is that President
Bush would't dare veto a farm bill, no matter how expensive,
if it's passed just before the November elections. The best
bet for containing the subsidies may be the next round of
talks on the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, due to
end in December. Negotiators hope to agree on a world-wide
reduction of farm subsidies, and presumably Congress would
have to write a cheaper farm bill.</p>
<p>As of now, though, Members of Congress seem bent on
continuing their annual farm pig-out, all the while screaming
at the President and the electorate for not raising taxes.</p>
