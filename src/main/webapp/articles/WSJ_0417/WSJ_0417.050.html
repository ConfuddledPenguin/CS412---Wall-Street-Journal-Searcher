	<p class="article-leader">TOKYO -- Whatever happened to the Pacific Rim?
Geographically it's where it always was, of course, but the
Pacific wave of the future seems to have hit political and
economic breakwaters.
   China is frozen in repression, casting an icy pall over
the jewel of Hong Kong. All of the five Tigers seem to be
suffering various kinds of molt. Ghastly tales seep out of
the usual hell-holes. And even mighty Japan finds itself with
a collapsing stock market, sinking yen and political crisis.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Perhaps not too much should be made of the momentary
reflections of a visiting editor, even if buttressed by chats
with the real experts at The Asian Wall Street Journal.
Still, particularly given the recent euphoria over the trend
of the world, the picture on this continent is a disturbing
one. If 1989 was a miracle year in Eastern Europe, it was the
year that the Asian miracle at least momentarily lost its
glow.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>This is felt most acutely -- laying aside China itself --
in Hong Kong. Its still-bustling streets befit the world's
largest and most impressive shopping mall. But almost any
conversation echoes a "fin de siecle" mood. China has just
announced the so-called "basic law" under which is will
govern the colony after 1997, proclaiming many high-sounding
freedoms. The Asian Journal compared these promises with
China's present constitution, for example, "Citizens of the
People's Republic of China enjoy freedom of speech, of the
press, of assembly, of association, or procession and of
demonstration." These words did not stop the People's
Liberation Army from beating monks to death in Tibet or
shooting students in Tiananmen Square.</p>
<p>The Thatcher government also has just proposed its
"nationalities law," to distribute passports to 50,000 heads
of household among an expected 750,000 applicants. The
governor will pick 500 favored "entrepreneurs," and 6,300
slots go to people in "sensitive jobs." With individuals
judged by an 800-point formula, there will be 323 lawyers,
1,615 accountants and auditors, 2,907 school teachers and so
on. Some less jaded century might be appalled by this traffic
in human lives.</p>
<p>Singapore, another basically Chinese city-state, would
seem the most logical destination for Hong Kong's refugees.
And indeed, in a national day speech in August, Prime
Minister Lee Kuan Yew explained that Singapore must seek
immigrants to offset its own brain drain. He said that some
4,700 families "from our top 25%" had left the previous year.
Adjusted for population, one report calculated, this
approaches the pre-Tiananmen flight from Hong Kong. Premier
Lee's best and brightest are voting with their feet against
his thinly veiled autocracy, also the root of his arguments
with the Asian Journal.</p>
<p>At the same time, there is another problem of people
fleeing into Hong Kong. Boat people, arriving in leaky
vessels over pirate-ridden seas, are being confined in
desolate camps and even sent back to the Vietnam that once
vanquished the United States. If you ask why the Hong Kong
Chinese cheer repatriation of the boat people, they ask, why
not? Their own relatives escaping from China are every day
summarily put back across the border.</p>
<p>There is also new fighting as the Vietnamese profess to
withdraw from Cambodia and Laos. In Cambodia statesmen
debate, whither the successors of Pol Pot? Taiwan has made
remarkable progress, but its future remains clouded by the
one-China problem. South Korea has stumbled with labor
strife, and in Thailand military influence in government
seems to be growing. The Philippine "model" has turned into a
joke as observers lose count of the coup attempts, President
Corazon Aquino refuses to see the secretary of defense whose
planes kept her in office and some forgettable minister
accuses our distinguished correspondent, among others, of
being "on the take."</p>
<p>From Burma, whose latest government now asks us to call it
Myanmar (or was it Manmyar or Marmyan?), come reports of what
sounds like a new killing fields. A "resettlement policy" has
moved 200,000 people, or more probably 500,000 people, from
restive cities to barely existent rural settlements. Few in
the West have even heard of this horror. Gen. Saw Mung, like
Lee Kuan Yew, complains that Western media are interfering in
his country's internal affairs.</p>
<p>The lingering and even growing miseries of Asia somehow
escape attention or even notice. As Eastern Europeans break
for freedom, those who can testify that evil still lurks in
the world are yellow and brown. Or black; in sub-Saharan
Africa freedom means the right to be ruled by a tyrant of
your own skin color.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>Japan, pre-eminently a member of the first world, is
understandably confused. The Japanese are proud, they guess,
to have concluded a new trade agreement with the inscrutable
Americans. But what, they wonder, will come next?</p>
<p>The same Americans who browbeat us into changing our
retail trade laws, the Japanese are too polite to say, say we
have become too powerful. The Americans complain if we sell
them cheap products, and they complain if we send them our
investment money. And they claim that we are not true
capitalists.</p>
<p>Japan, some Americans even say, is now number one. Well,
we can leave bicycles unchained on the Ginza, but what do we
get out of this moral superiority? How come we measure
apartments by mat-squares and have to commute through Tokyo,
with the distances of Los Angeles and the densities of
Manhattan?</p>
<p>After the miracle year of 1989, a short visit to the
vaunted Pacific Rim is a sobering experience. The lesson is
that there remains a great deal of work to do in the world,
and a great vacuum of leadership. And the visitor returns to
the canyons of Wall Street thinking that if there is blame to
levy, no little of it should rest on the Pacific Rim's
eastern edge. There a nervous giant feigns weakness to avoid
shouldering the responsibility of the strong.</p>
