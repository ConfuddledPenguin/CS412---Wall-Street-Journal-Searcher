	<p class="article-leader">Tyler Corp. said it set a special meeting May 14 for
shareholders to vote on the proposed sale of its Atlas Powder
unit to Imperial Chemical Industries PLC, London.
   The company said terms call for all of its assets and
liabilities except Atlas Powder and bank debt estimated at
$63 million to be transferred to a new Tyler Corp. Current
Tyler shareholders will receive a dividend of one share of
the new Tyler and will swap their old Tyler shares for about
$120 million of stock in Imperial.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Previously, Tyler said Imperial would offer about $128
million of new stock for the old Tyler shares and would
assume $55 million in bank debt. Tyler, a holding company
that will be left with a pipe and fittings company when the
transaction is completed, said a conversion rate of Imperial
stock for old Tyler shares hasn't been set yet because the
bank debt to be assumed is subject to change.</p>
<p>However, based on the current estimates and Tyler's 21.3
million shares outstanding, holders of old Tyler stock would
receive Imperial stock equal to about $5.63 a share. In
addition, $9.9 million in Imperial stock could be paid later
to Tyler holders, subject to certain conditions.</p>
