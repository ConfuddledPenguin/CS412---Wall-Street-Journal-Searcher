	<p class="article-leader">Indiana utility regulators rejected a proposed three-year
rate freeze for Public Service Indiana and instead ordered a
4.25% rate reduction.
   The Plainfield, Ind., company said that as a result, it
faces higher potential costs associated with anticipated
clean-air legislation. Nonetheless, the unit of PSI Hold ings
Inc. said it doesn't plan to appeal yesterday's Indiana
Utility Regulatory Commission ruling, which allows it a
15.76% return on equity, which as of last Dec. 31 totaled
$560.5 million.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The rate reduction will cost the utility about $37.3
million in revenue a year, the company said. A spokesman said
Public Service Indiana hadn't yet determined when the rate
decrease would go into effect.</p>
<p>PSI Holdings shares rose 75 cents to close at $17.25 a
share yesterday, in New York Stock Exchange composite
trading.</p>
