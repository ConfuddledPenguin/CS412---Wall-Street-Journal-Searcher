	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- Two House members unveiled a bill to merge
stock and futures regulation into a single agency, hoping to
replace what they called "an archaic way of regulating
financial instruments."
   The legislation, introduced by Reps. Dan Glickman (D.,
Kan.) and Dennis Eckart (D., Ohio), is the most sweeping
proposal in the debate over who should supervise financial
futures.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The congressmen said they would need strong Bush
administration support to move this bill through. "This
depends on what the administration decides to do," said Mr.
Glickman, a member of the Agriculture Committee. The Treasury
Department has supported a merger as one of several solutions
to what it calls the "regulatory bifurcation."</p>
<p>The Commodity Futures Trading Commission currently
monitors financial futures, as well as the rest of the
futures industry. But the structure has come under attack
from within the Bush administration, including the Securities
and Exchange Commission, which regulates the stock and
options markets, for creating stock-market volatility and
hindering enforcement efforts.</p>
<p>Until now, most discussion about the regulatory split has
focused on moving the monitoring of stock-index futures to
the SEC. Stock-index futures, which are controversial because
they can be used in program-trading strategies, allow
investors to bet on the direction of a basket of stocks
without buying the actual securities.</p>
<p>The Glickman-Eckart bill would create a single agency,
called the Markets and Trading Commission, that would oversee
most of the U.S. financial markets. The congressmen contend
that merging the agencies could avoid one pitfall that some
have feared, the weakening of the CFTC, which could occur if
oversight of index futures were shifted to the SEC.</p>
<p>The agency also would control stock margins, which are
currently set by the Federal Reserve Board. Futures margins
would remain in the hands of the commodities exchanges, but a
floor would be set. Margins are the good-faith deposits
required for trades.</p>
<p>Chicago Board of Trade President Thomas Donovan has called
the merger proposal "worth studying" and said that it's
preferable to giving the SEC regulatory control over index
futures. Chicago Mercantile Exchange officials have echoed
Mr. Donovan's remarks.</p>
<p>A CFTC spokesman immediately attacked the bill, arguing
that "we fail to see any need for merging the two agencies."</p>
<p>SEC Chairman Richard Breeden said the agency "wouldn't
oppose the merger approach if that's the way Congress
determines to deal with the problem of split jurisdiction."
But he added that "a merger, while desirable from many
perspectives, isn't absolutely necessary to solve the worst
problems" of the regulatory division.</p>
