	<p class="article-leader">When Hotels Replace
   Hospitals, What a Lift</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>COSMETIC-SURGERY patients may sleep better knowing their
overnight stay won't cost a fortune.</p>
<p>In some cities, surgeons reject the convenience and
resources of hospitals and instead put their patients up in
first-class hotels nearby -- at substantial savings.</p>
<p>After surgery, when patients ought to be near a hospital
but don't need to be in one, Richard Caleel, a cosmetic
surgeon in Chicago, uses small, European-style hotels close
to his downtown office and surgical center. Nightly rates at
the Talbot and Tremont, for example, range from $135 to $205.</p>
<p>Insurers generally won't pay for elective surgery, so
patients can even splurge on the Ritz and still come out
ahead. Some Chicago hospitals charge $1,000 or more a night.
"A hotel room is more comfortable," says Dr. Caleel, "and the
food is better."</p>
<p>At the Latham Hotel in Philadelphia, Julius Newman gets a
special rate well below $100 for his patients because he
typically refers more than 200 of them a year. Dr. Newman,
president of the American Board of Cosmetic Surgery, does all
his work at Graduate Hospital, about six blocks from the
Latham. Graduate Hospital charges $785 a night for a
semi-private room.</p>
<p>Nurses drive Dr. Newman's patients to the hotel and stay
with them until about midnight if family members can't. The
doctor visits his patients at the hotel in the evening and
again the next morning before releasing them. "These patients
don't require intravenous fluids or other special support,"
Dr. Newman says.</p>
<p>Larry Schoenrock, a plastic surgeon, puts his Santa Rosa,
Calif., patients in an English cottage guest house next to
his operating facility. They get private baths, fresh flowers
and vintage wines. Even with a bill of $295 for 24 hours of
private-duty nursing care, patients still save.</p>
<p>For San Francisco patients, Dr. Schoenrock arranges
lodging for about $285 a night in quaint Victorian homes he
doesn't own. "Compared to the fee for a San Francisco
hospital room," he says, "that's only about half."</p>
<p>Some HMOs Dock Docs'</p>
<p>Pay for Stinginess</p>
<p>HOLDING DOWN costs too much can backfire. U.S. Healthcare
Inc., a Blue Bell, Pa., company that runs health maintenance
organizations, uses membership surveys to ask whether members
have trouble getting referrals to specialists. The company
also checks records on hospital admissions to see whether
they fall below the norm. How doctors fare by these criteria
affects adjustments in their per-member payments.</p>
<p>"Offices that are underutilizing have had decreases in
their compensation," says Michael Stocker, an executive in
the company's quality assurance program.</p>
<p>Incentives to spend more rather than less contrast with
the traditional HMO impetus to guard against unnecessary use.
But the trend may gather strength. Balanced incentives can
help HMOs improve relations with doctors and protect both
from malpractice suits. HMOs feel emboldened to tie ratings
of doctors to compensation because of the growing data about
practice patterns.</p>
<p>Av-Med Health Plan Inc., Miami, uses criteria like U.S.
Healthcare's to help determine which doctors get bonuses. At
Cigna Health Plan Inc., too, bonuses reflect quality as well
as economy. "If we get a doctor who's leading the pack in
cost containment, but his patients aren't satisfied, he's not
a star," says Michael Soper, the medical director.</p>
<p>HMOs still stress that high costs don't necessarily mean
high quality, and finding the right balance of incentives
still involves educated guesswork. "This isn't physics," Dr.
Stocker says.</p>
<p>Lots of Hospitals Don't</p>
<p>Add Up to Lower Prices</p>
<p>COMPETITION doesn't drive down hospital costs. It actually
jacks them up.</p>
<p>A recent study of about half the community hospitals in
the U.S. found that patient costs were 11% higher in the most
competitive markets than in cities with only moderate
competition and 17% higher than in single-hospital
communities. Similarly, patients' bills in the most
competitive markets were 14% higher than in moderately
competitive cities and 24% higher than in the least
competitive communities.</p>
<p>The study, conducted by Health Care Investment Analysts
Inc., Baltimore, evaluated more than 2,000 hospitals, each
with between 100 and 400 beds in use, for the years 1984
through 1988. Data were standardized to correct for such
variables as wage scales and complexity of patient mix. The
cost differences persisted despite higher occupancy rates in
the most competitive markets.</p>
<p>In 1988, the median charge per patient was $4,337 in
markets with four or more hospitals. In contrast, the median
charge was $3,798 in communities served by two or three
hospitals and only $3,488 in single-hospital markets.</p>
<p>In larger communities, "the facilities end up competing
with each other based not on price but on amenity levels --
who has the most sophisticated services, the fanciest
equipment," says George D. Pillari, president of the research
firm. "In effect, the hospitals start an arms race."</p>
<p>Odds and Ends</p>
<p>FOR EVERY tax dollar spent on contraceptive services, more
than four tax dollars are saved in health and welfare costs,
the Alan Guttmacher Institute, a New York research group,
estimates. . . . "Cost containment" is now the chief reason
employers give for using flexible-benefit programs, A. Foster
Higgins & Co. finds. Companies used to cite "the ability to
meet diverse employee needs."</p>
