	<h3>Marketing: Car Makers Try Offbeat Lures In Iffy Market</h3>

	<p class="article-leader">DETROIT -- Buy a car, get a Caribbean cruise -- or a
cellular phone or a free dinner or a weekend at the beach.
   Such are the lures auto makers and dealers are dangling
before reluctant consumers as the traditional spring selling
season gets off to a bumpy start.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>U.S. sales of domestic vehicles in late March rose 2.9%
from a year ago, helping pull sales of all imported and
domestic cars and trucks for the month to 2.9% below March
1989. That was some improvement from the industry's February
results, when sales of all vehicles fell 4.7% below a year
ago and domestic auto makers recorded their worst February
for car sales in seven years.</p>
<p>The recent uptick in deliveries, caused partly by the
unusual incentives -- and some hefty cash rebates -- has
sparked optimism among auto makers. Chrysler Corp. now is
predicting total auto industry sales will come in around 14.5
million vehicles, about even with 1989 and higher than
Chrysler's earlier estimate of 14.2 million.</p>
<p>Still, an uncertain economy and the prospect of higher
interest rates does worry auto makers, many of whom are
adopting unusual marketing programs to ensure that they will
enjoy at least a spring selling boomlet. Cadillac is kicking
off a new campaign today that includes rebates of up to
$2,000, special lease rates and an offer in which consumers
who test drive any Cadillac next week get a free weekend
rental of a Cadillac through Avis.</p>
<p>The deal "helps us get prospects into our cars for an
extended period of time," says Peter Levin, director of
advertising for the General Motors Corp. division. In turn,
Avis gets some "high demographic people who use rental cars a
lot and travel a lot."</p>
<p>Some of the incentives might sound counterproductive.
Nissan Motor Co. has been heavily advertising the "Stanza
Challenge," a Feb. 12 to April 30 program that gives $100 to
customers who test-drive the restyled Stanza compact car, but
still choose to buy a Toyota Camry or Honda Accord within
seven days.</p>
<p>So far Nissan has handed out more than 190 checks, says a
company spokesman, but Stanza sales last month also jumped
almost 86% to 6,689 cars, compared with February's 3,603
total. "We've said all along once we get people into the car,
we can get them to buy it," the spokesman said.</p>
<p>Dealers have been getting into the act, too. In addition
to $1,000 rebates from Mazda Motor Corp., Courtesy Mazda in
Memphis, Tenn., offered some March buyers of 626 and B2200
trucks four days and three nights at an Orlando, Fla., hotel.
In addition to the room, customers got a "welcome split of
champagne" and "complimentary greens fees daily," the
dealership's newspaper ads said.</p>
<p>Rick Lepowsky, new car manager at Camelback Toyota in
Phoenix, Arizona, said the no-charge mobile phones his
dealership is giving away have helped close some sales. And
Wallace Ford-Subaru in Delray Beach, Fla., had "a decent
month of March in an extremely tough environment," partly by
offering cruises to the Bahamas for customers taking delivery
of a new or used vehicle last month, says President Bill
Wallace. He said the cruises were part of "the most
aggressive promotional activity we've ever done."</p>
<p>Still, the biggest lure seems to be cash. Ford Motor Co.
is offering $500 on several of its models to anyone who
hasn't bought a new vehicle before. It is also offering
low-interest finance rates and rebates. The Escort
subcompact, which Ford is replacing later this month with a
new Mazda-designed version, gets some of the most generous
incentives.</p>
<p>GM's Oldsmobile division recently doubled the rebate on
its Cutlass Supreme to $2,000, if dealers contribute $500.
Chrysler also is offering $2,000 on certain Dodge Dakota
pickups. And special, low lease-rates are blossoming like
tulips on luxury-car lots. Volvo AB's U.S. sales arm is
advertising 60-month leases with $256.04 monthly payments on
its 740 GL cars, if lessees are willing to ante up $3,000.
Ford turns the tables, giving lessees of some Lincolns up to
$900 cash, which the consumer can give back to the dealer to
reduce monthly payments on a two-year lease.</p>
<p>Bayerische Motoren Werke AG has a two-year lease rate on
its 3-series cars that cuts monthly payments on the 325i
two-door and four-door models to $399, 17.5% below the level
of just a month ago. "The competition in {the luxury car}
segment is real tough and most of the competitors are using
lots of incentives," says a BMW spokesman.</p>
<p>And how have all these programs affected sales? Sales of
all Mazda cars, spurred by factory rebates and dealer
programs, rose 26.9% last month to 30,258 cars after falling
4.3% in February. BMW sales fell 10.2% to 5,416 cars, but
that was still better than February's 28.3% drop.</p>
<p>Toyota Motor Corp. turned in an especially strong month,
with car sales up 43.9% to 79,320 Toyota and Lexus cars. That
was enough to give the Japanese auto maker a 9.2% share of
U.S. car sales in March, beating Chrysler, which recorded an
8.2% share. Honda Motor Co. also edged Chrysler, with an 8.3%
car share.</p>
<p>Chrysler handily beat both in total market share, however,
with an 11.3% share of all cars and trucks compared with 7.5%
for Toyota and 5.6% for Honda, which doesn't sell trucks in
the U.S.</p>
<p>Strong sales from GM's Chevrolet Division, particularly
among its Geo models, helped boost GM's U.S. car market share
to 35.1% for the month from 34.9% a year ago. Ford's car
share, meanwhile, fell to 21.1% from 22.6%.</p>
<p>Ford said it expects to rebound when it introduces later
this month the new Escort and the Explorer, which replaces
the Bronco II sport utility vehicle. "By year end, we are
confident that our share of both the car and truck market
will be above the 1989" levels of 22.3% for cars and 28.8%
for trucks, said Vice President Robert L. Rewey.</p>
<p>During the last 10 selling days of March, U.S. car sales
came in at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 7.2 million
units, the best 10-day rate since early February. Poor sales
earlier in the month, however, dragged the rate for all of
March down to 6.6 million, the lowest since December's 6.5
million rate.</p>
