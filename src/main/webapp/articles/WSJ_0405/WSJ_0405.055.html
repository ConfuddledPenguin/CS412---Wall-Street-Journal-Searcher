	<p class="article-leader">The people of Buffalo, N.Y., are bewildered. They woke up
Monday to discover that their modern mass-transit system was
dead in its tracks -- flat broke, shut down. There is a
lesson here for every significant city in America.
   Only five years ago, Buffalo opened a $600 million subway
paid for almost entirely by federal and state dollars. The
easy lure of federal grants has prompted dozens of cities
such as Buffalo to build transit systems they can't afford to
maintain.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The transit authority shut down the system in what Mayor
James Griffin called a form of "brinksmanship" to force
higher taxes. The authority turned down $2 million in stopgap
funding and an offer from County Executive Dennis Gorski to
turn over management to a private firm. After a two-day
shutdown, county officials cried uncle and imposed a real
estate sales tax to support the system. Its long-term future,
however, is dim.</p>
<p>Washington helped create Buffalo's mass-transit crisis
when in the 1970s it began paying for 80% of the cost of new
transit projects and up to half the cost of operating
budgets. Combined with state funding, this made new systems
"free" to cities. They began to mortgage their municipal
futures by pushing white-elephant projects no city would have
contemplated building with local tax money. Miami's train
system ended up attracting 15% of the number of projected
passengers; Buffalo's only a third. When federal subsidies
declined in the 1980s, both cities were trapped into
operating a network of bus lines that fed into truncated rail
lines that no one wanted to use.</p>
<p>Mass transit today is still based on the theory that most
commutes are from suburbs into downtown business districts.
But the traditional suburb-to-center-city commute is now
third in size among traffic flows. Twice as many people now
commute from suburb to suburb.</p>
<p>Over 180,000 people now work in the transit-starved New
Jersey Meadowlands, across the river from New York City, yet
local commuter services still operate on the assumption that
people will always work in Manhattan. Traditional public
transit can't hope to keep up with this dynamic growth and
movement of jobs. In Buffalo, for instance, the subway serves
neither the football stadium nor the main campus of the state
university, which is the area's largest employer.</p>
<p>Still, Congress persists in funding projects that rely on
discredited transit models. Just last week, the House
approved $2 billion in federal funding to extend Washington,
D.C.'s Metro subway. Lawmakers justified rolling this pork
barrel further by calling the system "America's Subway,"
though it's unclear how much a tourist from Des Moines will
use the new suburban lines. They also won't help many
commuters. More people work at Tysons Corner in suburban
Virginia than in downtown Denver, yet no Metro station is
planned there. Metro has so far cost $7 billion just to
build.</p>
<p>There are alternatives to the present transit mess. Denver
has contracted out many bus routes to private firms, allowing
route changes politicians had long blocked. Mexican immigrant
Alfredo Santos is suing the city of Houston to allow him to
use jitneys to transport poor people who are badly served by
local bus routes. Other cities have deregulated taxis, making
them affordable for short trips. Private toll roads that
allow commuters to use pre-paid, bar-coded stickers to speed
through collection points are being built in Texas,
California and Virginia.</p>
<p>It's time to admit that conventional theories of mass
transit no longer fit the fast-changing American economy. No
bureaucrat can guess where new jobs and economic growth will
create transit needs. Any attempt to do so will, as in
Buffalo, lead to systems that are inflexible, outdated the
day they open, and certain to keep the local community on a
financial treadmill that never ends.</p>
