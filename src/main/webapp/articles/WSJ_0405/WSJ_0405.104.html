	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- The most important thing the government can
do to increase the international competitiveness of U.S.
banks is to reduce their cost of capital, Federal Reserve
Board Chairman Alan Greenspan said.
   Testifying before a House Banking Committee task force on
international competitiveness, Mr. Greenspan also urged once
again that Congress lift restrictions on the ability of banks
to deal in securities and engage in other nonbanking
activities.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The Fed chairman also repeated a call to repeal
legislation restricting the ability of banks to operate
across state lines.</p>
<p>"There is reason to believe that the opportunity for a
bank to diversify the products or services it offers or to
diversify geographically may in some cases raise its rate of
return and lower its risk," he said.</p>
<p>Most other countries, but not Japan, allow banks to engage
in a broad range of financial activities. Mr. Greenspan has
been arguing for some time that the U.S. should do the same
in order to compete internationally.</p>
