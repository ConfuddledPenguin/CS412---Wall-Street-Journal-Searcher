	<p class="article-leader">Baxter International Inc. said it will take a $566 million
first-quarter charge to cover the costs of plant closings,
trimming its 64,300-person work force 10% and shedding
several "marginal" lines.
   The charge is expected to nearly wipe out the health-care
products and services company's earnings for the year.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The company also disclosed that it is considering the
future sale, through a public offering, of a minority stake
in its $1.4 billion diagnostics-products business.</p>
<p>The moves announced yesterday were largely in line with
what analysts predicted following Baxter's statement in
January that it was evaluating "structural alternatives" and
would announce its decisions by the end of the quarter.</p>
<p>In composite New York Stock Exchange trading yesterday,
Baxter shares were down 25 cents to close at $24.625,
although volume was nearly two million shares.</p>
<p>Like its competitors, Baxter has been under pressure as a
result of increasingly cost-conscious hospitals and changes
in the government's health-care fee schedules.</p>
<p>In addition, however, the company has been widely
criticized for the slowness with which expected savings from
its $3.7 billion acquisition of American Hospital Supply
Corp. in late 1985 have materialized. In particular, analysts
have objected to what they consider a bloated work force, and
lower-than-anticipated cash flow.</p>
<p>"A lot of what they're doing is what they should have done
five years ago," said Salomon Brothers Inc. analyst Lorraine
Schwarz. The moves are "hopeful in the sense that {Baxter is}
finally biting the bullet," she said, but "you still have to
question the attractiveness of the businesses they're in."</p>
<p>Lucy Olwell of Merrill Lynch Research said that while the
company's move promises "the quality of earnings will
improve," it indicates management "finally reacted to the
fact they hadn't successfully derived the synergies between
Baxter and American that were anticipated" when the deal
closed. "They should have done it sooner."</p>
<p>In an interview, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
Vernon R. Loucks Jr. disputed that interpretation, contending
that the expected savings have been "pretty well realized,"
but have been masked by industry pricing trends. The company
didn't move sooner, he said, because management, in "trying
to build long-term," felt "we had to understand what we had."</p>
<p>Baxter declined to say which of its world-wide plants it
intends to shutter or consolidate under its "carefully
considered redeployment of human and capital resources,"
although it noted that the approximately 6,400 jobs to be cut
will include some administrative staff. It also declined to
identify the businesses -- with total annual sales of about
$140 million -- it plans to shed.</p>
<p>The revamping will generate annual pretax savings of about
$275 million by 1993, Baxter said, and will allow the company
to increase outlays for alternate-site health care "and other
high-growth businesses," and to boost research expenditures.
Baxter also expects increased operating income and cash flow.</p>
<p>But the company expects the charges to result in a loss of
about $1.50 a share for the first quarter. In all of 1989, it
had net income of $446 million, or $1.50 a share, on sales of
$7.4 billion.</p>
<p>Although "the magnitude of Baxter's restructuring charge
is expected to nearly eliminate any net income for the full
year 1990," Moody's Investors Service said yesterday, the
rating agency confirmed its ratings on Baxter's approximately
$2.4 billion in debt. Moody's said it expects the program
"will have strong positive effects on future corporate
efficiency, profitability and cash flows." The rating company
added that it expects "substantially enhanced growth and
returns in the years ahead" for Baxter.</p>
<p>Baxter also yesterday announced plans to establish a
separate subsidiary for its diagnostics-products business.
While it is "committed to diagnostics for the long term," the
company said, it has retained First Boston Corp. to help it
evaluate ways to enhance the business's "contribution to
shareholder value."</p>
<p>One option, the company said, might be a public offering
of a minority interest in the new subsidiary, although Mr.
Loucks cautioned that no decision is imminent.</p>
