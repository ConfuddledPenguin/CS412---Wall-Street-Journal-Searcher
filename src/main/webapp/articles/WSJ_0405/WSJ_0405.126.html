	<p class="article-leader">TEXAS INSTRUMENTS Inc. (Dallas) -- Moody's Investors
Service Inc., citing intense competition in the semiconductor
business and reduced growth in the defense arena, said it
downgraded the debt ratings of this big electronics concern,
affecting about $1.14 billion in debt. The rating concern
said that it cut the rating because it believes the company's
cash flows and profit margins will be lower "over the
intermediate term." Further, it said that joint ventures and
customer alliances, along with higher royalty payments, won't
be enough to offset the huge capital requirements of the
company's semiconductor business. Moody's said it cut Texas
Instruments' senior debt rating to single-A-2 from
single-A-1, its subordinated debt rating to single-A-3 from
single-A-2 and its preferred stock rating to single-A-3 from
single-A-2. A Texas Instruments spokesman said the company,
which had more than $600 million in cash and short-term
investments at year end, has a strong balance sheet and
believes its overall financial situation will remain strong.</p>
